Wassup party peoples

Tonight marks a new stage in my life.. my girlfriend turned 21 and now I can 
party like a rockstar again.

I am definitely going to Sen-Sei's Birthday bash with Jeno and sensei and 
Colemen  at Sno-Drift, the Orgy Crew's no cover party at the Shadow Lounge, 
Mark Farina at Ruby Skye, and Release at 1015 to see Eric Morillo (Ministry 
of Sound uk).

I am bringing three different outfits so don't expect to see me in the same 
gear twice.. hope to run into some peeps from the list (OSBY!!).

Have an incredible and safe night!

Ranger

WoW! Where are these parties? The most I have ever been offered e is once! (except cool world (hey, I was helping a friend who was performing, it's not like I PAID or anything! and it was fun) =and mabe you remember the yellow shades house party at tlhitb, back at the end of "the DAY" Where that little tiny girl who had the face of a 40 year old and the body of a 16 year old with cheap fake boobs was running around going "anybody want to buy some K?" LOUD about every 30 seconds. (If you are reading this I am not apologizing - you are a poster child for the rave act, and you are spoiling it for the rest of us.) SHE asked me 3 times if I wanted K, all by herself, and wouldn't respect "no, thanks" "NO" or "Fuck, NO! keep your goddam cat tranqualizers to yourself and stop asking me." and then she obviously forgot and asked me about a dozen more times! For the record, if you see me at a party, I DON'T WANT TO BUY YOUR DRUGS! I'm not saying wether or not I do illicit drugs ( those of you who know of my reaction to caffene know I do legal ones) But if I did, I wouldn't get them from some tweaker who has no concept of subtlety that I have never seen before. But my point was, I wouldn't go to a party where I was offered (the same) drugs constantly by different people! That is a sign that nobody knows each other, not a lot of PLURR there, just greed. 
 
>not quite..... the law says that promoters must reasonabaly know that 
there
will be drugs there.. and the state (and feds) wouldnt waste money on 
big
parties where everyone is searched before entereing... and where proper
permits are obtained.. they are going to go after the parties that I've 
been
to where I'm offered E by three diffrent people the second I get in..

Subject: NRR: Crossfader replacement help...

--part1_79.1241fef2.2c0bf46e_boundary
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hey,
  I have a Vestax PMC 170A (the 3 channel mixer with kill switches) that 
needs a new crossafader (had it for 3 years).  Can I replace the crossfader with 
the new PVC faders instead of the standard CF-RUS crossfader ?  
  I asked Pro Sound and they said I needed the old CF-RUS.  But I think I can 
replace it with a PVC fader since the PMC 170A and PVC 175A are the same 
mixers.
                                                                              
              Thanks

so, i am taking big risks right now....ooooooooooooooooo, big risks...also, when you are popular, the best thing you can do to spread the love is just start pointing a whole lot...like just make a "hey there" expression...leave it in place, and the just point at will. :)

Heh heh. I don't think they were going to let the party keep going.

I was up the hill, on the tracks, and taking a leisurely stroll the fuck
out the second I saw flashlights.

Supposedly things didn't get too bad. But, you know.

Better evasive than tied to a metal chair in some terrible underground
vault while men with tentacled faces carve masonic glyphs in your
forehead.

Or whatever.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] BSP :: ASR Gemini :: TONIGHT! :: FREE Outdoor party

Well all I have to say is that I had a blast playing outside again and
doing something completely illegal dammit!

Damn poo-poo's had to come out and break up a good thing - and I have
the feeling that had the party been allowed to continue, it would have
gained legendary status in many of those who attended.  

DJ M tore it up and sadly the fun was over by the time I was about to
play one of my last records...  Gar!  

But if anyone was at the after party - there was some good stuff being
thrown down during my short stay.  I think I even moved my butt & feet a
little bit.

Well props to Jeremy & Mook & the rest of the gang for trying to do
something that just felt GOOD!  

And as for Jonas and his OLDNESS! - You're still younger than me bud, so
there's no reason to quit partying - at least until I do!!!   LOL

Until next time...

; )

Well, I think it depends, not only on which parties you go to (And you DO go to
different parties than me usually, after all.), but also it varies greatly from
person to person.  Though, for the life of me, I don't know why YOU don't
attract your fair share as well.

But it seems like whenever I leave the house, I'm a magnet for drug dealers. 
I'll have friends bitch to me about not being able to find a pill the whole
night, when the first three people who talked to ME when I got in the door were
offering me pills, and the next person to talk to me AFTER my friend, will be
trying to sell to me too.

This even happens to me, every so often, when I'm just walking down the street!
 Wandering down Haight street, all those random hippys with weed, or shrooms
they picked in Golden Gate Park, who USUALLY wander around muttering "buds...
shrooms" to EVERYONE... they ignore me.  But the ONE person on the whole bloody
street who has E, will home in on me, and try to sell me pills.`

Not infrequently as well, random people seem to assume that *I* am a dealer. 
And I've never sold (illegal) drugs in my life!  (I did used to tend bar tho,
which is morally equivelent to any E dealer.  Alcohol *IS* a drug, no matter
what the republicans and their uniformed minions tell you.)  And even AFTER
people get the clue that *I*'m not a dealer, they STILL expect me to be able to
"hook them up".

I don't know what it is about me...  But SOMETHING just seems to broadcast:

Subject: RE: [sfraves] e bust, blah, blah, blah...

I hear ya,  for me it's not so much people offering, but I can't go to
most clubs on a weekend with at least 30 people trying to buy from me.
Rarely am I offered, I must just have that already f$cked up look about
me that I get from the music.  I've almost been dragged off the floor by
security because they thought I was high as a kite and about to collapse
until I informed them I hadn't even had a drop of alcohol and wasn't
leaving the front of the crowd to cool down and by state law they have
to bring me water.  So they did :)

(don't get me wrong, I am by no means sober all the time, just rarely at
parties am I on anything and depending on the club I'm usually sober
too.  I like to do everything elsewhere.)

I always get hammered when I go to a club(hammered meaning weed and 
alcohol).  Anyway, when 5am rolls around and I am a dancing sweaty mess, 
EVERY time I sit down in the back I have about 10-15 people ask me if I am 
OK.  WTF?!  I mean, not to be rude, I think its cool that they care for my 
well being, but, its 5am!  You should expect that I look like shit!  If my 
eyes are open and I am breathing and dancing, then stop asking me if I am 
OK!!

> Do you have a demo tape that you would like to have digitally

Considering that casettes are an analog medium and CDs are a digital medium,
any transfer from one medium to the other is a de facto "digital
remastering."  There's no such thing as an analog CD.  Can you please
describe exactly what your "remastering" process is and what equipment you
use in the process?  Is there processing applied to the "remaster?"  What
distinguishes your (fairly expensive) service from a simple "transfer" where
the contents of the program material on the casette are simply recorded onto
a CD?

Subject: ASR Gemini: WTF happened? (aftermath)

All,
I had fun at Gemini too, dancing beside friends and enjoying the vibe/music, but
I really need to know what happened (the aftermath).

I have a terrible memory of Jeremy sitting on the steps above the RR tracks,
with a cop nearby, monitoring his actions. I did not know if he was being
arrested or just receiving a citation. Regardless it was disconcerting because
earlier in the night I had given him a big hug and I did not know how to react
to this frightening situation.

Also, I gave a donation to the "sound fund," especially when someone mentioned
Marshall's name, because I always appreciate his efforts at renegades,
undergrounds, and other parties. Please reassure me that the donations were used
appropriately (even if it was for someone'e bail or whatever). I understand that
given the situation, the proceeds might need to be redistributed.

About the renegade sound system, the cops did not seem to be concerned about
confiscating equipment, but I wonder happened. Did everything turn out all right
in the end? I vaguely remember Jeremy saying something to the cop about "wanting
to make sure that the mess is cleaned up" and the cop said something about "they
just want you out of here."

It was a very confusing night. I don't know why people are writing glowing
reviews. Yeah, I enjoyed the music too but I feel really "put down" by the
authorities with the big flashlights.

Finally, I offered to take Osby home (since he was stranded), and while we were
walking to my car, DragnFly mentioned an after-party at Ryan's place, and I was
wondering how that turned out.

That's all, just wondering what's up and if Jeremy (and other ASR crew members)
are OK.

Greg VP

I don't think 15 bucks is hardly expensive for someone to transfer something
from tape to cd and master it. Yall need to quit your hating and find
something productive to do with your life ;)

why wouldn't you just record from the tape into sound forge, remaster it and
then pay one of the many cd duplication places to make you 100 for $100????

The guy was simply saying if you had a demo that was only on tape he would
transfer it. Like I know you can only get allot of Michael Liu's stuff on
tape. And I would love to have that shit on cd.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] ASR Gemini: WTF happened? (aftermath)

i spoke to the cop up top while we were waiting to go back down and help
pull stuff out, and he seemed nice, i'm not sure what kind of run in they
had with jeremy, but i hope he got out ok, as well as everyone else
including the people who brought sound.

it was a surprising night in berkeley, the people in the ghetto liquor store
we went to were polite, even said 'excuse me', and the police officer who
busted the party was chatting with us and seemed to be friendly, he simply
said (at least to me) "they just want you guys out of there". fair enough.

Subject: Demo Tape s to CDs!! If your still wondering



We're actually improving the sound quality from the cassette by running it 
through a digital soundboard (Yamaha MD4S) and adjusting the eq levels for 
optimal clarity. It's not the the same as if you used a burnner on your 
computer.
You'd be surprised how many sorry souls out there still have mix tapes.
peace

Tom

PS: this whole process takes well over an hour for each tape. I don't 
suggest buying 100 copies. You can get them elsewhere for less (obviously).

Subject: Re: [sfraves] DJs: Remaster Your Demo Tape to CD

How is questioning the value of someone's service based on its technical
merits "hating?"  I was merely saying that there were certain aspects of the
original post/advertisement/spam that seemed to be misleading, and asking
what it was about the service that made it so expensive.  You're absolutely
correct, though, that 15 dollars MIGHT not be expensive for a Tape --> CD
transfer, depending on what sort of equipment is used in the transfer and
what sort of mastering is applied afterwards.  If he's got a Nakamichi tape
deck connected to an Avalon A/D converter and is then processing through
Massenburg and Drawmer plugins in ProTools, then no, it's not expensive at
all.  If, however, he's running a Teac tape deck into the back of his
Soundblaster card and hitting "Normalize" in Sound Forge, then, you know, I
think 15 dollars is a bit much.

Personally, I think it's a bit silly to be transferring things from casette
tape, a lo-fi medium, to CD, a much higher fidelity medium, because you're
never going to get MORE out of the CD than you got out of the tape.  This is
why I quibbled with the phrase "digital remastering" in this context, as it
is generally applied to situations where original, archival masters that
have been carefully preserved are remastered for the CD medium.

Well, in that case, I'd have to say that you are indeed "digitally
remastering" (albeit from a shitty source medium) and that $15 dollars is a
perfectly reasonable fee for your services.  My sincere apologies for
"hating."

Peace,
Jonathan

berkeley police are by far the nicest police, they
always tend to treat people fairly.  sure, we were
"breaking the law" but no harm was being done so they
just wanted to "enforce the law".

not sure what happened though, since i live just a few
blocks north of the location i walked down and i
couldn't hear anything until i hit dwight.  my guess
is that a security guard at bayer called to complain
since there's no houses within earshot.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] BSP :: ASR Gemini :: TONIGHT! :: FREE Outdoor party

My guess? I saw a lot of people wandering up by the train tracks thoughout
the night. It seemed like there was a rather large turnout and a lot of cars
nearby. I wouldn't be surprised if a cop merely drove by the street with the
cars and saw people crossing the train tracks into the park. I really doubt
that the party was busted due to posts to SFR. Had that been the case the
party wouldn't have gone on as long as it did. When I got searched by police
there was no mention of getting the infoline. It seemed like a very chance
occurance. Of course I was a bit too trashed at this point so things were
rather a blur until getting back to my house.

I do want to say that the party was great up until the bust. Even then it
was handled in a friendly manner. The woman that searched me was really cool
and didn't screw with me at all. Even when I couldn't find my id and she had
to search me to get it she was still cool. Made me pour out my NewCastle. =(

Things continued at my house all night and into the morning. That was a
rather wild time and I can't believe I didn't hear about it from my
neighbors. I had a great time and it's great to hear everyone respond in a
positive manner.

i am trying like everyone else to make wise food choices, but also, i can't stop eating everything that i want. this is a common thing that people do in america. they eat whatever they want to whenever they want to, or rather, when time permits, because also, people are in control of when you eat sometimes, what you eat, and also, how you will eat it. i like to be in control of the kitchen sometimes, but lots of times, i am too tired or just bored of it, or just don't remember what it was that i wanted to make to share, so that is good for people  who don't want to eat my cooking, but who WILL eat my cooking, because if i took the time out to cook, it WILL be eaten. just kidding. i am not that much of a brat or anything like that. i like cooking for people, because i always wait in life until the one that wants to eat will just be doing it. anyway, this brings me back to the fact that i feel like eating, and while nutrition is important, i really like hostess cupcakes, and the last time i ate them, they just looked so velvety smooth on top (i picked the perrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrfect pack), and also, if i were in the middle east, for example, maybe one of the reasons i would be uninterested in anything else is that maybe i wouldn't know about those cupcakes, but i do. i know lots of things. :)

Subject: The Fool and SWAT UG Loft Party

--=====================_17633474==_.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

The underground certainly seems to be heating up these days, and I expect 
in the next few months the creative pot is going to boil over.  Just as in 
the early nineties, folks are tired of the lack of diversity and family 
vibe in the clubs and have begun seeking the freedom (that lovely TAZ), 
musical and social experimentation, and community bonding that only the 
underground can offer.

For a long time it was hard to find a house music ug, but that is 
changing.  On Saturday night The Fool and S.W.A.T. threw an event at the 
same loft location as Sticky a few weeks back.  At The Fool I picked up 
several fliers for future house ugs including "Houseplant" that goes down 
June 14th.

The email for The Fools party  warned : "ARRIVE EARLY, VERY LIMITED 
CAPACITY. WHEN THE SPOT'S FULL, THE DOORS WILL BE CLOSED."   When I checked 
the voicemail and discovered the venue was the Sticky location (one room 
dance floor with a rooftop that holds not more than 200 comfortably) we 
decided to go early and arrived at the sobering hour of ten -- for us, at 
least.  I haven't arrived at a party where I wasn't on crew before midnight 
in years.

I'm happy we decided to roll in before the witching hour.  We had a chance 
to relax, look at the art show that was part of the event, and say goodbye 
to Milo, a good friend who worked at Housewares for years, who is leaving 
the City.

Everything was rockin' at the event until around 2:30 am or so, when the 
crew began, IMHO, to lose control.  I really enjoyed Andrew Kelsey's set, 
the dance floor and the crowd vibe until -- the crew failed to keep their 
promise to close the doors when capacity was reached.  The peeps poured in 
and as far as I could see there was no effort to limit the attendance 
numbers.  Must have been over 400 folks packed into that small place.

My own personal drama quest began during Rasoul's set.  I had been dancing 
in sweaty oblivion for quite some time when I realized I had better hit the 
bathroom.  Well, this place has two bathrooms, barely adequate for 
200.  The facility on the main floor had a line backed up into the narrow 
hallway causing gridlock -- same with the toilet on the small second 
floor.  We had hand stamps so we figured after fighting the through the 
masses for about twenty minutes that we would go outside and hit the 
alley.  Apparently this was on many minds, because another 
impenetrable  crowd was building at the exit and we were told ins-and-outs 
were canceled.  Ah.  The pressure on both the bladder and mind 
increases.  What to do.  The roof.

So we head for the steps (yes, they replaced the ladder) and there is chaos 
again here.  Folks trying to come down, go up, long lines and the 
beginnings of aggression on all sides.  The crew managed some control here 
and we finally got to the top and searched for a corner or 
somethin'.  There was a roped off section and we head into this empty space 
at a gallop only to be told by crew that we should feel free to smoke our 
weed in the crowd.  Misinterpreted intentions.  Out we go, and then there 
is a rush into the same forbidden are by guys in similar bladder 
crises.  At this point, shame is overridden by panic and I blast my way to 
a corner on the roof and let loose.

Relieved and ready to dance again, even in this over-packed venue, we plow 
downstairs and back on the dance floor for Jeno's set.   I understand there 
was some conflict with the venue owner who was freaked at the over-sold 
conditions.  He turns up all the house lights.  The music goes on, but from 
three to four the house lights kept going up and down.  Industrial lights 
were left on in the middle of the dance floor.  Rasoul seemed to be having 
some problems with the turntables.  Jeno didn't come on at the scheduled 
time.  And then, finally, the music went down, the lights went up, and we 
were all told to stand in silence for a what seemed like an eternity so 
that the party could continue.

When the music came back up we decided we had enough of this and left a bit 
after four.  I hear Jeno's set was smokin'.  Sorry we missed it, but my 
vibe was broken by the crowd issues and the blinding house lights going up 
and down.

Now, I like the people who threw this party but....  When you throw a ug in 
an "intimate' space you do PRESALES and a map point.  It is really absurd 
to post a BSP with a voicemail that motivates peeps to show up at the venue 
doorstep when one has very limited capacity.  Hard to turn them away.  One 
has crowds building outside.  Greed can motivate some to imprudently take 
in the bucks.  This venue was not designed for 400;  the crew was not 
prepared to manage this number.

The other side of the coin here is that I genuinely believe the crew did 
not anticipate the interest generated by this ug.  Dancers were still 
showing up when we left.  There is a growing appetite for the underground 
again in the Bay Area.  All the more reason to throw more events -- but 
events that are governed by some of the old rules:  selective presales, map 
point controls, and a break-even-at-best motivation.

Love,

Apollo

That would be my guess. Afterwards I heard first-hand accounts of a Bayer
security guard on premises with a golf cart, watching us all sneak into
the brush.

Should have bribed him with some pizza, or a stripper ;-)

i concur with this hypothesis.  if it were an organized operation, they would have been waiting
there by 11:30.    as i approached along the requested route, the bayer security guard in his
security-guard-toting-mobile turned a corner, stopped, and looked directly at me.  i didn't respond
and continued walking but i had a bad feeling about it.  2 hours later it was on.  judging by the
guards sheer mass, i think the pizza would have done the trick.

LOL! John you're right! I guess I don't get offered drugs as much because I can't pay for parties, so I go to ones where I can show my art, and get in as part of the deco crew, so everybody knows me, But on the street, non ravers always think I can get them pills, one time this gansta lookin guy in Oakland was flirting with a girlfreind and me, so I gave him a flyer for my ART SHOW. (it was an honest to god opening, with wine and jazz) He thought it was a ug rave flyer and he jumped up in the air, clicked his heels, and exclaimed " I'm Gonna go get my friends and get me some extacy pills!" he ran off before I could explain to him that he wasn't going to find anything stronger than cheap wine and cloves!  And people on bart or the street or at work love to ask me for E, I use it as a chance to educate them that not everybody who looks like me does drugs, or knows where to find them. Of course this doesn't work as well if I am with say...Scooby. Then they just think I think they are cops.

Subject: DAMN and Dorkbot

 Just a reminder for dorkbot on wednesday.
http://dorkbot.org/dorkbotsf/ , it is the one year
anniversary, so somewhat of a celebration (not a party
by any party kid standards) 

 Also we're doing DAMN (Dinner Alcohol Movie Night)
again, but this time it's on Tuesday to make room for
dorkbot on wednesday. Were going to watch a good copy
of Matrix II and probably caddy shack. Drop me a line
off list (without 'sfraves' in the subject line), if
you want an evite.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] DJs: Remaster Your Demo Tape to CD (BSP)

Well,

I will throw my info out there. I have a nice page detailing the DJ 
compilation remastering service I offer here:
http://audio.egregious.net/dj-remastering.html

It isn't all fud though; it explains my process clearly and there also is a 
nice section on recording tips that should come in handy for anyone 
recording a mix comp.

This service is mainly for sets recorded digitally (computer, etc.), but 
can also be applied to a transfer of a tape or a heavily degraded 
source;  you would be surprised what you can bring back to life!

If you are an aspiring techno DJ or simply are getting into music that is 
not following the herd hit me up and chances are I'll give you a discount 
if I like what I hear!


I am just getting my first vinyl pressed soon and once I QC the results and 
they pass my ear I'll post a sweet deal for those producing tracks, but 
haven't quite managed to get anything on vinyl yet.

Best,
--Mike

Subject: Expatriot sale

 I'm fleeing the country to south america for some

dorkbot and DAMN while you still can)

use, has 3 levels of effects, controlled by BPM, has
an isolator: $200 obo
yamaha dd-55 digital percussion set, 7 Pads, 2 pedals,

--

Adversity draws men together and produces beauty and harmony in life's
                       relationships, just as the cold of winter produces ice flowers on the window
                       panes, which vanish with the warmth. - Søren Aaby Kierkegaard

WELL, IT IS FINALLY SWIMSUIT SEASON AGAIN, AND I KNOW THAT WE ALL HAVE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO IT. I KNOW I DO EVERY SINGLE YEAR WITHOUT FAIL, ESPECIALLY SINCE I KNOW THAT STRING BIKINIS ARE THE PERFECT UNISEX PIECE OF CLOTHING. WE ALL HAVE PERMISSION TO BE WHO WE ARE IN A STRING BIKINI, AND SINCE THEY ARE STRING, THEY ARE ADJUSTABLE, MEANING WE CAN ALL WEAR ONE. :)

C.

PS - I'm the Epsilon guy.  If you detest my normal foo-foo, fear not.

_________________________________________________________

A unique experience at elastiq this Wednesday, as we'll
have zero residents playing --- it's a 100% pure guest dj
night! Traipse on by to taste-test three distinct stylistic
genres through three diverse individuals. It's going be
*yummy*.

_ FEATURED MP3 SET DOWNLOAD ________________________

Our MP3 set of the week goes to the incredibly smooth
techhouse/house set by The Oracle, who played for us
last week.  Incredible taste in music and clean mixing are
guaranteed to take you on a journey.

82MB | 1hr:25min @ 128 Kbps hi:fi
http://technostate.com/~zeel/audio/others/2003_05_28__oracle@elastiq-sf.mp3

_ KI _____________________________________________________

Influenced by Industrial music of the 80's & 90's, Ki
ventured to the realm of djing in early 1997 after
moving to SF. Shortly thereafter, he purchased his first
techno album which began his deep love for all things
techno.  In 2000 he began his first residency at a techno
monthly which brought in top producers such as John
Selway and Theorem.

Though he is currently focusing on music production,
he can still get the dance floor going with his mature
and impeccable taste. His sets range from tech-house to
tribal to hard techno with the intent of never ending
where he began.

_ EPSILON _______________________________________________

Epsilon was first exposed to DJing at the climactic UNITY
campout in August 2002. Since then he has shared his love
of progressive and epic trance at several events, playing as
a resident for Preserve and Deciblast.org.  Since last playing
at Elastiq, he has flirted with the dark side, exploring the
deep, exotic realm of progressive psytrance, but keeping
the light of trance melodies ready in case of an emergency.

_ GRETSKI _______________________________________________

DJ Gretski: "Music has always been a big part of my life.
I started mixing about a year ago, but I didn't start playing
progressive until last November.  When I bought my first
progressive house record, I knew that i had found my
groove.  Paul, a.k.a Paul the Fanman, has played an
influential role in my dj'ing."

Yo yo yo...

Here's 14 hours of new streaming DNB for y'all to check out, a la =
Dirtbox.  The new recording box has been a bit of a bugger, and so the =
recordings are distorted at points, but good listening nonetheless:)  =
Hope y'all enjoy 'em...

i am so glad that i don't have to take on any new clientelle or anything even remotely similar. it's a good day. in great need of coffee though. you know something? no, really, you know something? i have been hearing all sorts of reports about coffee and beef. i like coffee and i like beef, also, i here these things are just rotten for a person, or at least for the cows, i am sure. gosh, i am sort of dissappointed with the lack of quality people, by the way. i am sure many are too. hey, you have my support, but at least i am not tempted ot eat them or anything like that. isn't there anyone out there who really knows what's up? hahahahhaha. oh my gosh, the internet has completely changed my health for the better. thanks, from the bottom of our hearts. :)

Oneiromancy Productions Presents
"Quantum Singularity"

Join us as we try to warp spacetime to a taste of what SF was like when names 
like "Frequency 8" or "Skills" were still young, and trance parties were still 
mystical journies that could change lives.

Featuring:

Axis Mundi (Nashville, TN)
One of the East Coast's up & coming Psytrance DJs, Axis Mundi has been turning 
on dancefloors all over the US, Canada, and Southern America to the magic of 
Psy. Combining years of mixing experience with an array of Live PA synths, 
drum machines, and samplers, Axis Mundi blends on-the-fly production into each 
of his sets, creating an unforgettable perfomance.

DO NOT CROSSPOST

You graduated finally and in advertising no less. Good god girl will you
ever learn?

side note - if you're going to be a promoter and want to *look* halfway
decent then format you bsp's so it's not a jumbled mess of copy and pasted
text. That bsp reads like a candy kid wrote it on 4 pills.

Hey guys!

I'm in desperate need of a pair of CD Decks.  Does anyone have a pair that I could borrow or even rent for a day?  I have a wedding that a friend has asked me to do the lineup for, and the headliner won't play without CD Decks.

Thanks everybody!

June 13, 2003

HIGH OCTANE <~~mini-MASSIVE

============================

 

LOCK N LOAD

The Lock N' Load project consists of two Dutch producers / DJs: Frank van Rooijen and Niels Pijpers. One fine day the Club Caviar boys came to visit the Lock N' Load studio, heard the old version of a song and offered to do a remix of it. In collaboration with Lock N' Load they delivered this stunning result and Niels decided to release "Blow Ya Mind". After all on Blue White Records, within a period of three weeks, it became the No. 1 club record in the Netherlands, and Europe followed soon after that, the United Kingdom was ready to be conquered. Through no. 1 positions in both the UK Club and UK Dance chart it had an amazing entry at 6. Help us welcome Lock N' Load to Sacramento.

Chris C.

Now firmly established as one of the Biggest and most popular DJ / Producers on the UK Hard House/NRG scene, Chris has masterminded the emergence and rapid success of his 3 Labels, Mohawk, Aztec and Nile. Positioning the former today as one of the genres top 5 marques. With over 30 single releases and 2 Albums to his name on various labels including Tidy Trax, Tinrib, Eve, Honeypot, Phoenix Rising, GBT, Bulletproof, etc...Chris' reputation as one of Britain's finest exponent of Hard House, both behind the decks and in the studio, continues to grow.

Whistler

Victor Cape a.k.a. Whistler shines as a highly respected DJ on the Pacific Northwest dance scene. Known for his tight mixing skills and uplifting personality behind the decks, Whistler blends energy and emotion from Hard Melodic Trance, Epic Anthems and Hard House to take his listeners on a dance floor rollercoaster ride. If being a DJ wasn't enough, he also manages Lovetribe which has quickly become one of the most well respected event productions in Seattle. It's been over a year and a half since Whistler's last performance in Northern California. So we're excited to bring him out for his first Sacramento performance!

Dragnfly Vs. Scepter

Sex in the Matrix

By Annalee Newitz, AlterNet
June 4, 2003

A lot of people seem troubled by the amount of sex in "The Matrix=20
Reloaded." This summer's sequel to 2000's science fiction smash hit "The=20
Matrix" is the ultimate cyberaction flick, complete with hackers, exploding=
=20
trucks, and fight sequences as visceral as the ones in a first-person=20
shooter. But much to the confusion of audiences used to S.F. films full of=
=20
burly but virginal astronauts, "The Matrix Reloaded" is also punctuated by=
=20
two graphic, extended sex sequences.

No "kiss and cut away" Star Wars-style moments here =96 we get full-blown=20
R-rated smut. One scene is a six-minute rave-orgy, the other a regrettable=
=20
depiction of a computer code-induced clitoral orgasm. There are other=20
seemingly gratuitous erotic moments, too: hero Neo makes out hungrily with=
=20
hacker grrrl Trinity in an elevator; evil Persephone helps Neo find the=20
valuable Keymaker in exchange for an intense,=20
tight-close-up-on-the-spit-covered-lips kiss.

So what's the deal with all this sexiness in a movie whose premise is that=
=20
we can transcend our bodies using computers? After all, most of us went to=
=20
see it for another taste of the eponymous virtual world where Neo can fly,=
=20
Trinity can leap across tall buildings in a single bound, and ship captain=
=20
Morpheus has to battle albino vampire bodyguards who can dematerialize at=20
will.

Adding insult to injury, sex in the matrix is pretty lame. The rave scene,=
=20
with its sweaty, half-naked bodies and trying-to-be-hip jungle beats, feels=
=20
hopelessly dated already. And the orgasm sequence =96 well, let's just say=
=20
that combining the "scary grid" special effects from Disney's Black Hole=20
with female genital anatomy wasn't such a great idea. You can tell the=20
Wachowski brothers grew up jacking off to ASCII p0rn. That's nice, but=20
nobody really wants to think of her clitoris as a glowing dot on a graph,=20
OK, boys?

Yet the more I thought about Reloaded, the more I realized that the sex, as=
=20
cartoony as it might be, is one of the most innovative parts of the movie.=
=20
Think about it: When was the last time you saw a special-effects=20
blockbuster with hot, sweaty sex in it? Especially multiracial,=20
multipartner, out-of-wedlock sex that didn't spell doom for its=20
practitioners? The heroes in Reloaded are frankly sexual, with no apologies.

None of this would matter outside of the hotel bars at science fiction=20
conventions if it weren't for the extraordinary popularity of the "Matrix"=
=20
trilogy (the third movie comes out in November). Joel Silver, who produced=
=20
"Reloaded," told Entertainment Weekly that audience tracking by the=20
National Research Group revealed the movie was the top choice for 43=20
percent of people polled =96 an extremely high number in the industry.=
 Ticket=20
sales have been astronomical too. It grossed $365 million worldwide in its=
=20
first two weekends.

What those numbers mean is that "Reloaded" has saturated our culture as=20
much as, if not more than, political propaganda coming from the Bush=20
administration. People are watching Neo and Trinity grope each other with=20
more relish than they are Attorney General John Ashcroft's latest salvo on=
=20
the evils of Internet pornography. It's very possible that the war for=20
human liberation in Reloaded has garnered higher audience awareness than=20
the war for Iraqi freedom.

As if in a kind of corollary to its sexual openness, the "Matrix" movies=20
are self-consciously multicultural. Their human heroes are fighting against=
=20
machines who have enslaved most of the human race, and it's hard to avoid=20
comparing our heroes' rebellion to that of colonized peoples all over the=20
world. As if to drive this point home, one of the outspoken members of the=
=20
liberated human city Zion is played by progressive, antiracist intellectual=
=20
Cornel West. Tellingly, most of our heroes are people of color and racially=
=20
mixed. The "bad guys" are all white men in suits. More startling still,=20
Zion is a city both pious and sexually liberated: The rave-orgy scene is a=
=20
public celebration that follows a group prayer.

What does it mean that "Reloaded" has become so mind-bendingly popular=20
during one of the most politically conservative periods in the history of=20
the United States? We've fallen in love with an epic of multicultural=20
rebellion during an era of "homeland security" with more than a few racist=
=20
overtones. And in a time of hysteria over everything from erotic cartoons=20
on the Web to the ensoulment of stem cells, people are drinking in images=20
of women having remote-controlled clitoral orgasms.

Is "Reloaded" all the liberation we'll get this decade? Or are our=20
preferences for progressive fantasies a hint of political preferences to=
 come?

Annalee Newitz (rabbithole@techsploitation.com) is a surly media nerd who=20
was glad to see that nmap works much faster inside the matrix. Her column=20
also appears in Metro, Silicon Valley's weekly newspaper.

mixed. The "bad guys" are all white men in suits. More startling still,
Zion is a city both pious and sexually liberated: The rave-orgy scene is a
public celebration that follows a group prayer.

What does it mean that "Reloaded" has become so mind-bendingly popular
during one of the most politically conservative periods in the history of
the United States? We've fallen in love with an epic of multicultural
rebellion during an era of "homeland security" with more than a few racist
overtones. And in a time of hysteria over everything from erotic cartoons
on the Web to the ensoulment of stem cells, people are drinking in images
of women having remote-controlled clitoral orgasms.

Is "Reloaded" all the liberation we'll get this decade? Or are our
preferences for progressive fantasies a hint of political preferences to
come?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR:  Sex in the Matrix

This piece is pretty funny. But it's kinda weird how
she's all snooty about the "hopelessly dated" beats in
the rave scene, and then she says they're jungle. I
recall those beats as house, not jungle, and I could
swear there was a difference.

(Altho to be fair those beats, whatever they turn out
to have been, sure were cheesy.)

I thought the sex scene with Neo & Trinity was a bit
creepy, and the gratuitous tits in the "rave" thing
kinda cheese, and yeah the Persephone bit made no
sense at all -- but the bit with the orgasm cake
program was funny! plus, I liked it because the guys
who made that movie were always horny bastids. check
out the first Wachowski brothers movie, "Bound." a
lesbian mobster flick named after its bondage scene.

("Bound" is visually stunning and lots of fun but it
probably has very little connection to real-life
lesbians -- at least I don't think I've ever met any
real-life lesbians who killed mobsters and took their
money, but maybe that just means I have a boring life.
or, perhaps, that I don't ask the right questions of
the lesbians I do meet.)

years ago, I thought it would be cool to set up a
business to create pornos with Matrix effects. I got
bored of the idea but it's still kinda neat to see the
Matrix with porno effects. makes me think I saw the
future coming or something.

(the amazing Giles Bowkett! capable of turning any
thread into a discussion of himself! watch his ego fly
to the spotlight of discussion, gigantic and
simultaneously mothlike -- like it was Mothra!)

blah, blah, blah.

That's right.  PURE brainfood is in store this morning, and what better
way is there to start the day.  Your chef this morning is AndyW, serving
up hot buttered beats of the crunchy variety.  Straight up 110% of your
RDA.  It all goes down starting at 9a this morning on 90.1 FM in the bay
area, or online at http://kzsulive.stanford.edu and wraps up at noon.
Do listen in.  We've got plenty of ticket giveaways also, including
passes to The Braintree tonight, and the Velvet Shop grand reopening
tonight at the new Zoe nightclub in San Jose with Jeno & Julias Papp.

Be talking with ya.
Peace.

sfr-landers-

ok, so i just made a lame ass webpage and uploaded a recent breakbeat mix of 
mine.  why?  because i love you and i want you all to listen to this mix 
(but only if you like breaks.  if you don't, it might make your ears bleed)

well, enough of that.  i hope the 2 people out there that actually download 
and listen to the mix thoroughly enjoy it.

and, oh yeah, none of the links on that page work.  hey, i'm still working 
on it!  i maybe unemployed, but i've got lots of other important things to 
do.

Subject: Anybody lose a big men's jacket at Popsicle?

Hi, rest assured I'm not someone who steals clothes that people stash away at parties. However, at Popsicle, I was one of the last people out of one of the bigger rooms, and if I didn't pick up this jacket, it would have gotten taken by Security or even thrown away. 
It's too big for me -- XXXL -- and I was planning to donate to "Out of the Closet," a thrift store in Berkeley that donates to AIDS charities. It's a pretty nice jacket, though, and a friend was urging me to tell some people before donating it. 
So ... if you're a XXXL kinda guy, and you lost a jacket at Popsicle, let me know what kind of jacket (brand, color, etc). I don't want to spend money to ship it anywhere, cuz it's heavy, but you could pick it up in Berkeley. 
Peace -
John

there's a lot of ways to get funds, and a lot of ways to get staff, but a never seen what i just saw recently before. i think the best way to do business is to be as cute about it as possible, but, of course, everyone has their preferences, and that is why you can be ugly to. you can even smell as bad as you want to, and someone will always pay you or give you whatever it is that you want. you can also apply this principle to art and events. you can have fun, or you can have a really smelly time. it's okay to like the smell of your farts. other people might appreciate them too. i, personally, occasionally will tolerate it, but i won't say a word, i will, HOWEVER, change your diet, but don't worry, because, chances are, you aren't going to be eating my food, and that is also a personal preference thing, so get back to your smokes and that bag of chips. :)

Subject: [StudioZ-announce] 11th & Folsom Street Businesses Need Your Help!

Once again, nightlife and businesses in San Francisco are being attacked.
Please pass this message on to all your friends.

This THURSDAY, June 5th @ approx 6:30pm, there is going to be a
DISCRETIONARY REVIEW HEARING at City Hall, ROOM 400. Please join us and sho=
w
your support in this matter.

The owner of 1525 Folsom St. has evicted the business from that location an=
d
is attempting to convert the space into a residential dwelling unit. The
location of this space is above the Holy Cow Bar and V Caf=E9. 1525 Folsom =
is
also situated between the StudioZ.tv "B Space" and the Wish Bar.

Here is a crude overhead drawing of the layout of the business in the
immediate area.

                ------------------.  |   |
                |  S      |   |   |  |   |
            11  |-----| S |   |   | N|   |
                |  P  |   | V | H |  | W |
                L_________________.  .___.
                           F

11 =3D 11th Street
N =3D Norfolk Alley
F =3D Folsom St.
S =3D StudioZ.tv
P =3D Paradise Lounge
V =3D V Caf=E9
H =3D Holy Cow
W =3D Wish

Again, the proposed plan is to put a dwelling unit above the V Caf=E9 and t=
he
Holy Cow bar.

You might be aware that nightlife in San Francisco typically needs to work
with residential neighbors in order to peacefully co-exist. For example, th=
e
San Francisco Late Night Coalition was originally formed to help give
existing neighbors and nightlife business a means to communicate peacefully
and productively. This process has worked quite well for cases of existing
neighbors and business conflicts.

Now, we are in a situation where someone wants to construct a dwelling unit
right on top of known late night entertainment businesses and this is our
chance to stop it before it is too late.

The reality is that no amount of expensive sound proofing is going to
prevent residents in this location from being in conflict with the existing
businesses. The building is quite old and we have been told by architects
that the entire building would need to be torn down and rebuilt with modern
materials in order to have even close to adequate sound attenuation. There
is no known plan by the owner to do this.

If we or other establishments go out of business because of this, it will
affect the business-ecosystem which exists on 11th Street. In other words,
we all depend on each other, the more businesses on 11th Street the better
for everyone. This is hard economic times, let's not make it worse with
problems that can be easily mitigated.

This THURSDAY, June 5th @ approx 6:30pm, there is going to be a
DISCRETIONARY REVIEW HEARING at City Hall, ROOM 400. Please join us and sho=
w
your support in this matter.

Here is the information about the hearing from the SF Planning website:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------=
-
http://sfgov.org/site/planning_page.asp?id=3D17743

14. 2003.0293D (D. SIDER: (415) 558-6697)

1525 FOLSOM STREET - east side between Norfolk and 11th Streets, Lot 053 in
Assessor's Block 3521 - Mandatory Discretionary Review of Building Permit
Application Number 2003.02.05.6758, a proposal to convert the second story
of an existing two story building from that of storage into a dwelling unit=
=2E
The construction of a new rear deck, stairs, and garage are also proposed.
The property is located in an SLR (Service / Light Industrial / Residential=
)
Zoning District, the IPZ (Industrial Protection Zone) as set forth in
Planning Commission Resolution Number 16202, and a 50-X Height and Bulk
District.

Preliminary Recommendation: Take Discretionary Review to approve the projec=
t
with conditions.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------=
-

We need your help to change the preliminary recommendation to not allow thi=
s
to happen at all. No amount of conditions will prevent noise problems with
these neighbors. Please come to the hearing and show your support!

Thank you for your support in this pressing matter! Please pass this messag=
e
on to all your friends.

Subject: (nrr) Quote of the Day (Thu)

Sorry it's so late today, I know you've all gone home for the day from work and now only the true, honest 
to god computer geeks are online right now.  

It's really muggy here today, how is the weather in SF?  I haven't been to the Weather Channel to check.  I 
remember when I used to live in the EBF house Bekki commented that I would constantly watch channels 
like that, and news programs like CNN and ABC-7, which, by the way, is owned by ABC, which is owned 
by Disney, and has the exact same logo, look, and plastic look and feel in the Chicago market (and I think in 
the New York market).  

And speaking of that, thank goodness that they passed that thing lifting restrictions on how many media 
outlets you can own in a market.  Now, the circle is complete.  Eh?  ;]

Now here's a quote that I think Geri Dahl would just be aligned 100% with.  =]  Oh, kick me in the shins, 
someone!

If only they would play a live set together, but that would be too damn cool. 21+ (sorry to those that aren't yet). If you haven't heard or seen Hybrid do so. They have a new cd coming out soon and I would expect to hear a lot of new tracks from them...

DEA Uses RAVE Act Threats to Block Montana NORML/SSDP Benefit

An agent of the federal Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) used threats 
of RAVE Act prosecutions to intimidate the owners of a Billings, Montana, 
venue into a canceling a combined benefit for the Montana chapter of the 
National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws 
(http://www.norml.org) and Students for Sensible Drug Policy 
(http://www.ssdp.org) last week.

The RAVE Act, now known officially as the Illicit Drug Anti-Proliferation 
Act, championed by Sen. Joe Biden (D-DE), was ostensibly aimed at so-called 
raves, the large electronic music concerts often associated with open drug 
use, but was so broadly written that opponents argued it could be applied 
against any event or venue where owners or organizers did not take 
sufficiently repressive steps to prevent drug use. Opposition to the bill 
stalled it in the Senate last year, but this year Biden stealthily inserted 
it into the enormously popular Amber Alert Bill, which passed last month 
and was signed into law by President Bush.

While the Billings event was advertised as a benefit concert for two local 
groups interested in drug law reform -- not as a drug-taking orgy -- it 
still attracted the attention of the DEA. On May 30, the day the event was 
set to take place, a Billings-based DEA agent showed up at the Eagle Lodge, 
which had booked the concert. Waving a copy of the RAVE Act in one hand, 
the agent warned that the lodge could face a fine of $250,000 if someone 
smoked a joint during the benefit, according to Eagle Lodge manager Kelly, 
who asked that her last name not be used.

"He freaked me out," Kelly told DRCNet. "He didn't tell us we couldn't have 
the event, but he showed me the law and told us what could happen if we 
did. I talked to our trustees, they talked to our lawyers, and our lawyers 
said not to risk it, so we canceled," she said. "I felt bad. I knew the 
guys in the bands."

Primary event organizer Adam Jones was unavailable for comment, having been 
arrested and jailed by his probation officer for switching work-study jobs 
at Montana State University-Billings without first informing him. He is on 
probation for possession of psychedelic mushrooms. It has been speculated, 
but not yet confirmed, that the probation officer, described in unprintable 
terms by several local sources, was responsible for siccing the DEA on the 
benefit.

"The DEA guy kept talking about Adam Jones," Kelly said. Jones apparently 
got the hint. In a message relayed from jail, Jones announced that we was 
resigning from SSDP and NORML and foregoing further drug reform efforts 
until he is free from the clutches of the state. That probably spells the 
temporary demise of Teachers Against Prohibition 
(http://www.teachersagainstprohibition.org), a group that education major 
Jones founded after having run smack up against drug war reality with his 
arrest (http://www.drcnet.org/wol/278.html#teachersagainstprohibition).

DEA Denver regional office spokesman Bill Wyman confirmed to DRCNet that an 
agent had visited the Eagle Lodge to warn of possible RAVE Act violations 
and their consequences, but deferred a more detailed response to Special 
Agent in Charge Jeff Sweet, whom Wyman promised would call back shortly. 
We're stilling waiting for that call.

"This confirms all our fears about the RAVE Act," said Bill Piper of the 
Drug Policy Alliance (http://www.drugpolicy.org), which spearheaded 
opposition to the bill, succeeding in blocking it last year. "This isn't 
about drug parties or raves, it's about having a club to hold over people's 
heads, whether its hemp festivals, circuit parties, dances, whatever. The 
RAVE Act is being used to suppress political speech. This is exactly what 
Sen. Biden said would not happen, and now it's happening," he told DRCNet.

Biden's office did not respond to repeated DRCNet inquiries about whether 
the Montana intimidation effort was what he intended the act to accomplish. 
But Biden wasn't alone in his silence. None of the three members of the 
Montana congressional delegation, Sens. Max Baucus (D) and Conrad Burns 
(R), and Rep. Dennis Rehberg (R), responded to DRCNet inquiries either.

Other national drug reform organizations also expressed shock and outrage. 
"This looks like the first application of the RAVE Act, and this is a very 
scary precedent, said NORML Foundation head Allen St. Pierre. "Preemptively 
shutting down a First Amendment-protected event is something that just 
doesn't happen in America," he told DRCNet. "This is absolutely what we 
feared and predicted would happen if the RAVE Act passed. Isn't Montana 
known for being resistant to federal encroachment? This should make them 
mighty uneasy."

"This is just more evidence that the current administration is engaged in a 
culture war targeting medical marijuana patients, glass blowers, festival 
goers and young people," said SSDP national director Shawn Heller.

"Wow," said Marijuana Policy Project communications director Bruce Mirken. 
"This appears to be a clear violation of the purpose and intent of the law. 
The RAVE Act's sponsors said repeatedly it was to crack down on people 
knowingly allowing open drug use," he told DRCNet. "To use it to crack down 
on reform organizations is an outrageous First Amendment violation. If 
laws, no matter how wrongheaded, aimed at drug use and distribution are 
used to intimidate efforts to discuss reform or raise money for reform, we 
are getting really Orwellian. I really hope the folks up there sue and sue 
hard."

Montana activists are also worried but undaunted. Missoula Hempfest 
organizer and Montana NORML spokesman John Masterson told DRCNet the threat 
of RAVE Act prosecutions was being carefully considered. "The Hempfest 
committee just spent most of our last meeting talking about this," he said. 
"We have more than 5,000 people each year in a Missoula city park. Is the 
DEA going to come after the city? We are meeting with local attorneys to 
discuss this, but we're not talking about canceling Hempfest. Screw that."

And the drug reformers are mobilizing. A conference call among NORML, SSDP, 
MPP, Montana NORML and the Montana ACLU was set for Thursday night or this 
morning. "We may have a coalition up to fight this by the end of the day," 
St. Pierre said Thursday. "The Drug Policy Alliance warned us the RAVE Act 
would be used to suppress free speech, and they haven't been proven wrong. 
Looks like we have our first case."

Content-Type: text/plain;

Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

**not my views, or quotes....just sharing... jt*

Someone recently sent me an email titled 26 things a perfect guy would =
do. I thought "hmm, nobody could possibly send me anything so stupid, it =
can't possibly be as dumb as it sounds." I stand corrected. The email =
was just as advertised: a wish list of how women supposedly want men to =
act, as if men in this country weren't already an episode of Friends =
away from turning into giant walking vaginas.=20

I never thought I'd ever read anything that would induce my gag reflex =
so quickly, and this is after having read the details of an anal =
prolapse that a friend sent me tonight. Here is the abridged list =
(because the full list might literally cause you to barf on your =
keyboard, and frankly, it's not worth reading), followed by my response =
to each "thing" that a "perfect guy would do:"=20

1. Know how to make you smile when you are down!=20
When will women realize that they don't live on the set of a romantic =
comedy? Unless making you smile involves me playing video games while =
you cook me a steak, you're in for a disappointment. You don't think =
guys ever feel "down?" The door swings both ways, bitch.=20

2. Try to secretly smell your hair, but you always notice.=20
What? Why the hell would I want to smell a woman's hair? It smells bad =
enough with all the sprays and perfume they use. Enough with the =
conditioners, sprays, and cream already; that shit makes my eyes water. =
What the hell is conditioner anyway?=20

3. Stick up for you, but still respects your independence.=20
Translation: bail you out when you fail at life, but never bring it up =
during conversations.=20

4. Give you the remote control during the game.=20
This one is inherently stupid because it implies that all guys like to =
watch "the game." Since I'd rather be shot in the chest with projectile =
diarrhea than watch "the game," I'll assume the author meant something =
worthy of watching, such as Ren & Stimpy, in which case you need to put =
the bitch down if she touches your remote.=20

5. Come up behind you and put his arms around you.=20
LAME. Who has time for this? Sounds like something out of a herpes =
commercial where some lady is rock climbing or doing something else =
which symbolizes her independence, then out of nowhere she blurts out "I =
HAVE HERPES." The music gets all serious and you hear a voice over =
"...there is no cure," cue inspirational music "but treatment is =
available." Then it cuts to a shot of the bitch on a beach and a guy =
runs up behind her and puts his arms around her. Good job dumbass, =
you're dating a skank with herpes.=20

6. Play with your hair.=20
Again with the hair? Women never play with the hair on my back, why the =
double standard?=20

7. His hands always find yours.=20
This is one of those things women read and say "AWW HOW ROMANTIC." I =
have news for you: holding hands is stupid. Women don't know the first =
thing about being romantic. Only lesbians hold hands anyway; allow me to =
explain. The only time it's acceptable to hold hands with anyone is if =
you're at a peace vigil. Guys don't go to peace vigils, period. If you =
do, you have to surrender your balls and get a sex transplant because =
you're a bitch; in either case, you're a woman, and when two women hold =
hands it can only lead to one thing as far as I'm concerned.=20

8. Be cute when he really wants something.=20
Bullshit. When I want something, I yell. If she can't hear me in the =
kitchen, sometimes I'll threaten beatings if I'm sober.=20

9. Offer you plenty of massages.=20
For your boobs maybe. I happen to have the uncanny ability to massage =
breasts. With my mouth.=20

10. Dance with you, even if he feels like a dork.=20
Let's face it: there are few things in this world more stupid than =
dancing. Except break dancing, which pirates and lumber jacks would =
agree is awesome. Other than that, dancing makes me envy cripples.=20

11. React so cutely when you hit him and it actually hurts.=20
See, this is what pisses me off about women: they expect special =
treatment at their discretion. They want equal rights, equal pay, and =
equal treatment for everything EXCEPT when it comes to shit like this, =
then they want you to "react cutely" instead of, say, putting them in a =
head lock and making them eat ants and/or spiders while you give them =
carpet burn. Why don't women react "cutely" when men hit them for a =
change? Oops, I forgot, that's domestic abuse.=20

12. Drive 5 hours just to see you for 1.=20
Any guy who would drive five hours just to see a chick for one is an =
asshole. If every guy drove around for five hours just to spend one with =
their girlfriend, we'd fill up the air with so much pollution that we'd =
all choke on the exhaust, get cancer, and then bake under the sun while =
our lungs rupture and we slowly die from internal bleeding.=20

13. Stare at you.=20
You stupid attention seeking whore, just buy the bitch a mirror, because =
apparently she thinks that you don't have anything better to do than to =
sit around and stare at her. If women ran the world, we'd still be =
searching for the wheel.=20

14. Call for no reason.=20
Oops, this one belongs on the list of "Twenty-six things women do that =
piss men off because they need to fill their otherwise vapid lives with =
something to make them feel like they have a purpose for existing as =
they eventually realize that they're pissing their youth away on stupid =
bullshit like fashion trends."=20

I can't go on, I'm going to go do something less painful like stick my =
dick in the oven.=20

Sunday, June 8TH
COMPRESSION 80's NIGHT : JOHN B & DISCO D
We love em so much, thats why on this night we bring 2 of Compression's 
favorite DJ's together for a night of crazy ass fun...

JOHN B (Beta, Tangent, Nu Electro, Chihuahua, London, UK)
John B is a name synonymous with originality. He has constructed some of the 
most daring Drum & Bass audio experiments of the last five years, and this 
is a consequence of his reluctance to pigeonhole himself under any one 
style. His refusal to conform to traditional methods means that his 
productive streak is ever changing; and so in delving into the timeline of 
John's musical career, some staggeringly contrasting and imaginative vinyl 
pressings can be discovered.

*Recent Music Production:
Bad Dreams (Sleepwalk) - Click here to listen


DISCO D (Tommy Boy, Bootybar.biz, NYC) "a night at the booty bar" cd world 
tour
To the press, he has been dubbed "phenom", "holder of the Ghettotech torch", 
"devastatingly wicked" and "surreally filthy." To his fans, he's no less 
than legendary behind the decks, captivating audiences worldwide with his 
distinguished blend of hard-hitting music and turntablist tricks. To others, 
he's a seasoned entrepreneur, as the founder and head of his second 
successful company. To his mom, he's just Dave Shayman, your friendly 
neighborhood white Jewish kid. No matter who you ask, it's apparent that 
21-year old DJ, producer, and international Ghettotech sex symbol Disco D 
has made quite the impact.

*Recent Music Production:
Booty Bar Anthem - Click here to listen

Suporting tallent:
back again N.A.W, (Not Average Whiteboys) & Sarah Delush

*Free Happy Hour 8pm-10pm:
You go around telling everyone you listen to all different kinds of music. 
BULLSHIT. But don't worry, cuz TEAM HOE is here to edumacate your ass like 
whoa. Playing happy hour exclusively for Compression on June 8th, djs ho-lia 
and pab-ho are down to drop everything from the big hair sound of the 80's 
to the shaggy-mullet sounds of today. So come early to get your swerve 
on...but stay later for the hoes.

Subject: Looking for talented Electronic DJ's in the Bay Area

Content-Type: text/plain;

Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

There is going to be a new web site that has never been done before.  It
will cater to the underground electronic DJ scene in the Bay Area, with
styles of music ranging from House, Trance, NRG, Hard Trance, Hard
House, Jungle, DnB, Ambient, Acid Jazz, Turntablism, etc. (I think you
get the point).  Interested?  Keep reading...
 
Does this fit your description?  An electronic DJ or composer that is
too talented for their own good, but doesn't know how to get themselves
known...
 
...This is where we come in.  
 
If you think you got some killer dj mixes or some tracks you put
together yourself, then we are looking (more specifically, listening)
for you.  We're looking for 25-50 talented DJ's and composers to get the
site launched with fresh, off-the-hook slammin' music.  We're looking
for 160kbps - 192kbps mp3's of your mixes or tracks.  If we like what we
hear, then we'll give you a free 6-month membership to our site.  More
details will be explained once we make contact with you.
 
We are just like you - we are doing this for the music, and for the
electronic community.  This site will cater to the electronic DJ's in
every aspect imaginable.
 
If you are interested, please email djunderground@wctech.net with a link
to where we can listen to your music.  Remember, it can be either a
complete mix, or just a track you created.  If you don't have a link to
your music, still send an email.  If you have to send it to us on a CD
in the mail, so be it.  Whatever it takes for us to hear your music.  If
you're dedicated enough, you'll get it to us.
 
Did I mention this site will be viewed on a daily basis by record labels
and music producers?
 
More information will follow once we do get in contact with you.  Due to
the site being 2-3 weeks away from completion, we can't say much without
some sort of confidentiality.  So shoot us an email to
djunderground@wctech.net so we can start talking.
 
If you're serious about DJ'ing, send us an email.  If you're not, don't
bother.

June 13, 2003
HIGH OCTANE <~~mini-MASSIVE
============================

LOCK N LOAD
The Lock N' Load project consists of two Dutch producers / DJs: Frank van Rooijen and Niels Pijpers.  One fine day the Club Caviar boys came to visit the Lock N' Load studio, heard the old version of a song and offered to do a remix of it.  In collaboration with Lock N' Load they delivered this stunning result and Niels decided to release "Blow Ya Mind".  After all on Blue White Records, within a period of three weeks, it became the No. 1 club record in the Netherlands, and Europe followed soon after that, the United Kingdom was ready to be conquered.  Through no. 1 positions in both the UK Club and UK Dance chart it had an amazing entry at 6.  Help us welcome Lock N' Load to Sacramento.
 
Chris C.
Now firmly established as one of the Biggest and most popular DJ / Producers on the UK Hard House/NRG scene,  Chris has masterminded the emergence and rapid success of his 3 Labels, Mohawk, Aztec and Nile.  Positioning the former today as one of the genres top 5 marques.  With over 30 single releases and 2 Albums to his name on various labels including Tidy Trax, Tinrib, Eve, Honeypot, Phoenix Rising, GBT, Bulletproof, etc...Chris' reputation as one of Britain's finest exponent of Hard House, both behind the decks and in the studio, continues to grow.
 
Whistler
Victor Cape a.k.a. Whistler shines as a highly respected DJ on the Pacific Northwest dance scene.  Known for his tight mixing skills and uplifting personality behind the decks, Whistler blends energy and emotion from Hard Melodic Trance, Epic Anthems and Hard House to take his listeners on a dance floor rollercoaster ride.  If being a DJ wasn't enough, he also manages Lovetribe which has quickly become one of the most well respected event productions in Seattle.  It's been over a year and a half since Whistler's last performance in Northern California.  So we're excited to bring him out for his first Sacramento performance!
 
Dyloot
Arguably  Nor-Cals BIGGEST Trance DJ/Producer watch him work his MAGIC over the crowd.

Tom Slik Vs. Tracer
Two of Nor-Cals Biggest Trance DJs wage war for the first time in Sacramento.
 
Denise Vs.  Paul the Fanman
First ever Teacher vs. Student battle between the establish Denise and the BIG up n comer Paul.  Lets see if he learned some tricks on his own.
 
Dragnfly Vs. Scepter
Shaolins two BIGGEST DJs go head to head to see who really is the SHAOLIN MASTER.
 
Bazooka Joe Vs. Reckless Ryan
Showmanship is the only way to describe the performance these two put on.  Turntablist House at its best.  Watch as these two leave you in a wicky-wick-AWWW!
 
Valerie Sparks vs. The Doctor
Nor Cals Best Hardcore Female DJ goes against this up n coming Junglist.

Subject: (bsp) "DETROIT" night Sundays @Skylark

This week we'll have guest DJ Heartbreaker with some sensual R&B joints and funk nuggets. Plus of course - the regular fix of deep Detroit techno and house, untouchable Motown love, in yo face garage rock, and as always a bit of nasty late night ghettotech booty grindin'. 

also, we got a new website up - replete with a link to some photographs from some past parties. Check it out at http://www.rumpshaker.net/detroit/

The party starts at 9 this Sunday night, June 8, at the Skylark, 3089 16st., San Francisco. This weeks featured DJ's include Baby Daddy (Rob Goppold), 12 Mile (Brian Stein) and special guest DJ Heartbreaker (David Pava).

UFO SYSTEMS  (EARTH ISLAND RECORDINGS, GSPENTERTAINMENT.COM, FL) UFO SYSTEMS (aka David White) has been enlightening crowds with his Euro/Progressive sound for six years now. You can find him blowing up dance floors across the world, capturing the masses with his hypnotic rifts and melodic rhythms. His DJ sets are intended to be a vivid journey through his musical world, which separates him from the rest. David's sets have left crowds speechless and on their feet! Make sure not to miss his sensational performance and come see why people compare him to Paul Van Dyke and Christopher Lawrence! 

DJ KUE (TECHNO MISSIONARIES, MISDIRECTION - TX) DJ Kue, hailing from Texas, is the next rising star in the house scene. Inspired by Richard Humpty Vission and Bad Boy Bill, he displays an arsenal of various scratches, juggles, and other turntablist tricks. Do not miss his first San Francisco showcase and see why he is one of fastest rising DJs in the house scene today. 

THE FUNKIST AKA DJ FLAVE (USCEVENTS.COM, AND ZION'S GATE RECORDS - SEATTLE, WA) After searching the globe we are excited to bring you one of the most talented, cutting edge DJs we have ever seen. The next level of DJs is here! Dj Flave not only scratches with his foot but also has an arsenal of new dj tricks to blow your mind. All the way from Seattle, come see why his last bay area party sold out!

God Bless U!  Love, Your sister in Christ, Tami

Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, Rejoice. Let your gentleness be known to everyone. The Lord is near. Do not worry about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.    Philippians 4:4-7

looking for a sample - vocal sample from a rap song -
complete verse goes like this:

"nobody moves
 nobody gets hurt
 come with the ruckus
 quick to do dirt"

it's from an album that came out around 96 or 97. I
think the guys who did this track also did the one
that Aphrodite turned into a jungle anthem? help much
appreciated...need it for a breaks track.

  contrary to the last 2 posts, i dont believe it is "nobody move" by 
eazy-e that you are looking for.  that came out in 88, and doesnt 
contain those last 2 lines.  unfortunately i dont know who the artist is 
you are looking for, but by what you posted, its not eazy-e.  oh and 
eazy-e died in early 95 anyways, fyi...

Doesn't mean his music was not sampled many people over the years have
sampled his music. Go download the Eazy-E album in question and you will
hear it. Peace

Or the line could be "That means I'm ready to work, and rush a fool to
the dirt"

Song name is "Nobody Move" BTW.

Yo Ren, you're ready to go get this move? 
Believe that, boy 
You're strapped ? 
Yeah, you know it 
Let's go do this, man, I got it all planned out 
Yeah, shoot any motherfucker that moves 

Verse 1: 
This is a stick-up, everybody get face down 
Ren, gag their mouths so they can't make a sound 
Tie'em up for the fact that I'm kickin' ass 
I got my hand on my gat, and I'm tempted to blast 
My name is Eazy, but I go the hard way out 
This ain't personal, but now I'm about 
to commit a crime and go thru with it 
You know what, no need for shakin' because I'm used to it 
Take out the security guard with a slap of my hand 
Yeah, he's wearin' a badge, but he's a ole ass man 
Pump his ass in the head, and take his gun 
so me and the punk can go one on one 
Cover the lens on the TV screen 
you know, so me and my gang just can't be seen 
Lock the doors, and throw away the key 
Close the blinds, so no motherfuckers can see 
and smile, you know, cause I'm controllin' the shit 
and no sucker ass nigga's gonna stop the hit 
Wardrobes and loads, and a ruthless shirt 
That means I'm ready to work, and bum rush a fool to the dirt 
So... 

Chorus: 
Nobody moves, nobody gets hurt (4x) 

Allright, anybody move and I'll blow your fuckin' head off 

Verse 2: 
Allright... 
Empty your pockets, but do it slow 
Take everything you got and lay it on the fuckin' floor 
Don't make me have to set an example today 
and blow one of you crazy motherfuckers away 
I'm in a bank, and it's a little bit funny 
takin' all you stupid motherfuckers' money 
Peepin' at a bitch cause my dick's on hard 
Laughin' at the dumb ass security guard 
who's tied up for the moment, not sayin' a word 
I should have known it before, the motherfucker's a nerd 
But back to the bitches I'm peepin' 
and then untie the ho, so I can start (?briefin') 
Took her to the backroom, about to jack 
Cold trailed the bitch, with a gun in the back 
I said: "Lay down, and unbutton your bra!" 
There was the biggest titties that a nigga ever saw 
I said, "Damn", then the air got thinner 
Only thought in my mind, was goin' up in her 
The suspense was makin' me sick 
She took her panties down and the bitch had a dick! 
I said, "Damn", dropped the gat from my hand 
What I thought was a bitch, was nothing but a man 
Put the gat to his legs, all the way up his skirt 
because this is one faggot that I had to hurt 
So... 

Chorus: 

I said get down. I want you all face-down on the floor 
Anybody moves and I shoot 

Verse 3: 
Stackin' up the money and there's more to collect 
cause I don't give a fuck, I take traveler's checks 
Yo, Ren, peep out the window, and tell me what you see 
[MC Ren: Three motherfuckin' police starin' at me 
What to do now ?] 
Hurry up and get on 
Allright, tell me, who is the motherfuckin' alarm ? 
I'm a give ya a chance, and count to three 
or else five o' ya bitches are comin' with me 
[Police: Allright, Allright, come out niggaz, or we're coming in 
This is the only chance to turn yourself in] 
Fuck you! We got hostages, and plenty of loot 
and don't give a damn and not afraid to shoot 
We're sendin' out the hostages, all except five 
and if you don't meet our demands, they won't stay alive 
We want a 'copter, so we can get away clean 
and take some pussy along, if you know what I mean 
One hostage got brave, and got off the floor 
but I smoked his ass before he got to the door 
[Police: They shot a hostage, they shot a hostage!] 
[MC Ren: You stupid motherfucker tryin' to run 
now you're dead as fuck tryin' to race a gun] 
[Police: Allright, this is the last chance to get off your ass 
or else the tear gas is about to blast] 
I ran to the back and Ren followed behind 
to a hell of a spot that was hard to find 
The bank was fucked up, the shit was smokin' 
with screamin' hostages, runnin' and chokin' 
Gettin' away, but I was suddenly stopped 
at point blank range, by a motherfuckin' cop 
And I hope they don't think that a lesson was taught 
cause a nigga like the E was finally caught 
My gat wouldn't fire, the shit wouldn't work 
So...Y'all know what time it is... 

Chorus: 

Police: Well I'm giving you five seconds to let us thru the gate or 
I'm gonna shoot two of your guards

true, it could be mistaken for that, and also it could be samples from 2 
songs, the 1st being eazy.  either way the song came out way before 96, 
so who knows....

I'm pretty sure the original is "Nobody Move" by
Yellowman, off of the album "Nobody Move". 
 This is the same yellowman that did the cops theme
song, "Bad Boys".

If there is a sin against life, it consists perhaps not so
much in despairing of life as in hoping for another life
& in eluding the implacable grandeur of this life.
-- Albert Camus -- *******************************************
**************************************************************


<Begin Forward>

Burning Man needs a bit of help, and it needs it
fast, so please read on. As you may or may not have heard, the Washoe County
Board of Commissioners have refused Burning Man a permit to use property
they own near Gerlach, from which the event is staged. This staging area is
the ranch from which all operations are run, and where all the gear is
stored. Apparently, if they can't use this land, it will make it nearly
impossible to organize the event.
BM has requested that as many people as possible show up at the county
meeting on June 10th in Reno to voice their opinions, and that those who
can't make it write letters to the Reno Gazette voicing their displeasure. I
figure that a petition wouldn't hurt either, so here's the plan:
We need to get at least 5000 signatures in the next 4 days, so we really
need to move on this. Please go to the petition site at the link below
immediately, sign it, and forward this email to as many sympathetic people
as possible. It would probably work best to simply copy and paste this msg
into a new email rather then forward so as to avoid getting the text all
screwed up, as often happens in forwards.
I'll be informing the BM organizers of the petition in hope that they also
spread the word, and so that they can bring a printout to the meeting.
Again... sorry for the spam, but I figured that this is worth it. The petition
is can be signed here:

Subject: Good records for learning to DJ???

So, a friend of mine just graduated med school, and is moving (hit the road
today) to the east coast to begin his residency.  In the process of cleaning
out his stuff and deciding what NOT to take east with him, he gave me an old
pair of his turntables, and an old mixer.

They're just belt-drive Numarks and a VERY basic mixer.  But I'm not one to
look a gift horse in the mouth.  And this finally gives me the chance to see if
I can develop any kind of skills without dropping >$1,500 (which I don't have)
on 1200s and a high-end mixer.

So I was wondering if anyone could recommend a few (3 or 4) records that would
be good for a total beginner (I've read a few DJ howto's, and understand the
principles of what you're SUPPOSED to do, I have just never had the opportunity
to try before) to start learning basic techniques on.

Cheapness, availability, and good learning techniques are my priority here.  I
don't want to be asking Skills or F8 to special-order anything expensive or
hard to get here, and since I'll be LEARNING on these, I don't want to to be a
big deal if said records get beat to shit in the process (IOW, no
collectibles).  Since I'm more concerned about being able to LEARN with these,
than them being my favorite music, genre doesn't matter that much.  I would,
though, like it to be an enjoyable experience, so I AM looking for something
faster than plain old house, and not as obnoxious as jungle...  perhaps
something in the hard house or NRG or hard trance or acid techno areas.

Any recommendations?

Oh, and I'll also need a pair of cheap, but useable, headphones.  Again, I'm
definately not looking for anything top-flight.  Just useable, and hopefully
useful for just LISTENING to music if I do turn out to be 100% useless behind
the decks.

Any help there too?

Thanks a bunch!


cya,
john

Subject: Missed opportunities...

So yesterday I was cleaning out a bunch of my crap, and happened across a big
stack of flyers from a couple of years ago.  Me being the obnoxiously organized
QA engineer at the time, they were sorted by date, and how bad I wanted to go
to each.  I had even included (and sorted) printouts of emails and BSPs about
parties I didn't HAVE flyers for.

Two stuck in my head:  Dave's first Herbonium, and Sarah and David Diez (well,
Sarah was still Backes, at the time) party: Phonosynthesis.  Both were on 4/20
of that year.  I remember these because I WANTED to go to both, and was having
a hellacious time deciding which to attend.  I wound up putting said decision
off (and buying a tixket for either) so long, that I was eventually COMMANDED
to attend a 4/20 party being but on by one of my dotcommer friends.

Now, I don't regret going to the dotcom party.  It was a night of excess and
debauchery and a good time was had by all.  But it's weird to think of all the
people I'm good friends with NOW, but I didn't know at the time.  If I had gone
to either Herbonium or Phonosynthesis, I would have met some of these a good
three or six months, or even a whole YEAR before I eventually did!

It's strange how things work out like that...  Sometimes when comparing old
parties with your friends you even find out that you were at a LOT of the same
parties, without EVER meeting each other, until much later.  It's a shame. 
There are a lot of people I know now that I REALLY wish I had met a lot earlier
than I did.


cya,
john

Subject: BSP Jason Philips Hot August Tour

	I am looking of for a few dates in the San Francisco area during
August 17th thru the 20th. If anyone has a show going on at that time
and would like to consider having me on their lineup contact me at
JasonPhilips@Compos-Mentis.Org prices are negotiable since I will be in
the area on my way south. If you need to hear my mix go to
http://www.flavoredclubbing.com/strawberry/ohmix2.ram and for my fairly
complete bio go to
http://www.compos-mentis.org/portal/modules/cdbase/index.php?id_art=11 

This is a chance to not have to pay travel costs and have a decent out
of town dj on your lineup. I have eight years of experience on the decks
and spin all kinds of house mostly dubby and deep. So what are you
waiting for get in touch. Peace

Subject: [nrr] bad english?

i noticed john does the same thing as me, he sometimes starts out his
sentences with 'so', such as:

so the other day i was licking some blotter when...

and so on. is that proper english? i'd hate to imagine we're falling into
some sort of faux-intellectual structure of writing. guidance is needed.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Good records for learning to DJ???

that is a tuff question, if i were you i would just head down to AMOEBA and
dig thru the bargain bins...look for 2 copies of something, just dont spend
too much, take them home and have at it! you can also look for Twitch or
Ultamix records, they have the bpms right on them plus what key they are in,
but they will cost you more money, usually $20 but they come in a double
pack which means you can start mixing right away. you should have no problem
finding records to play, and there are plenty of ppl in the bay who will
help you out with the basics.

Yes kiddies, it's time for the old man to get out of the party Bess.
So now you have a chance to get into the underground party business for yourself.
 I have a 4000 watt Coleman power mate for powering up your Full moon, park or Burning man theme camp for only $250 bucks. This will power power up to 1000 watts of sound plus turn tables,mixer,CD burner and a few lights, without cutting out. It runs great.
Also I steal have my two black lights banners as well as the black lights
I was asking $300 each for them but I will part with them for $250 each or both for $450 plus I will throw in the black lights and polls to boot.
Now as for the records. there are to many to wright down. But after 10years of collecting, reserving and buying records. I would say I have way to many. Mostly triable house, trip hop and dance hall. As well as some hip hop and old jazz. Oh even some German space rock.
 If you are interested in any of these items please e-mail me and I will send you more info and jpg's of my artwork.
Thank you

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Good records for learning to DJ???

Picking up some used records at Amoeba is not a bad idea.  And 
getting some Twitch or Ultimix or whatever "DJ-only" comps is also a 
good idea.  One thing I would recommend against is buying any 
breakbeat, jungle, 2-step, etc.  To start with you want to find stuff 
that is really simple percussion-wise with a very steady 4/4 beat. 
House with a lot of shuffle and funky syncopated hi-hat patterns can 
also throw you off.  I learned with New Order's "Blue Monday" and 
"Perfect Kiss" which are both about the same BPM and they're both 
fairly dj-friendly.  Don't try to mix stuff that is really far apart 
BPM-wise or style-wise, at least not while you're learning.  Also 
keep in mind that the belt-drive tables will work for basic 
beat-matching, but don't drive yourself crazy trying to learn 
turntablist tricks with them.

I have 400-500 old records that are both house and trance. All are new to 
great shape. I'm selling them for cheap. If your interested reply to 
gianni3333@aol.com and we'll chat. What ever you do I would recommend not spending a lot 
of cash on new records because at first your not really sure of what style you 
like. Records are expensive so get the mixing part down then slowly build up 
you personal collection of favorites. Goodluck!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] [nrr] bad english?

Samples of "Conjunctions"

From: http://www.getitwriteonline.com/archive/032601.htm

"...The word "but" [and "so"] is one of the seven coordinating
conjunctions:

and
but
or
nor
for
so
yet

Coordinating conjunctions are used to join words, phrases, and clauses
that are balanced as logical equals:

Mary AND I went to the meeting. [joins two subjects]

We were tired YET exhilarated by the end of our first day hiking up Mt.
Everest. [joins two adjectives]

We swam all morning BUT fished in the afternoon. [joins two verbs]

Often these conjunctions are used to coordinate two independent clauses
(groups of words that can stand alone as sentences). Here are two
examples, with the independent clauses in brackets:

[We started to go home], but [we had run out of gas].

[She was a good leader], for [she could delegate well].

--------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Most likely, many people believe they should not start a sentence with a
coordinating conjunction because their grammar teachers in grade school
discouraged them from doing so. Yet such a rule is completely
unjustifiable. When grammar teachers teach youngsters the essentials of
sentence structure, they most likely explain that coordinating
conjunctions are used to hold together elements within a sentence.
Therefore, they may discourage students from starting sentences with
coordinating conjunctions because they are trying not only to explain
conjunctions but also to help their students learn to avoid sentence
fragments like this one:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------

She was a nice girl. And smart, too.

In this example, using "and" after the period is wrong because the second
"sentence" is not really a sentence at all: it has neither a subject nor a
verb.

Thus, youngsters carry forward into adulthood the notion that a sentence
should never begin with a coordinating conjunction, especially not with
"and" or "but." In fact, however, professional writers have started
sentences with coordinating conjunctions throughout history.

Starting virtually every sentence with a conjunction would, of course,
make your writing thoroughly monotonous. And one would probably not want
to use such a construction in very formal contexts. For every coordinating
conjunction, there is a conjunctive adverb (however, nevertheless,
moreover, furthermore, etc.) that holds the same meaning but represents a
somewhat higher level of diction..."
--------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------

In the case of formal diction, cutting down on the number of "So"s in your
sentence helps. In the case of email, which is usually less than formal,
it is not always necessary to be bound to traditional diction and grammar
rules (see above).

Regards,
K

At this point I'll make a couple of beginner suggestions.

First - to learn to beatmix, talk to a friend who's a DJ and ask them to
help you out. It's easy.

2nd - as a total beginner,the best way to learn how to "drop a beat" and
"match beats" is to buy two copies of the exact same record. It can be
anything you want, but make sure that the record starts with a kickdrum. No
syth buildups, just a "thump" right at the beginning. The simpler the
better. Make sure there's no weird changes too early. Have two copies of
this and work back and forth with them.

As for building a library, you're best off buying "compilations" to get
yourself a collection without breaking your bank. These may seem to be more
expensive ($20-30 each) but they have lots of songs and give you a lot to
play with.

Finally, I'd suggest you learn the BPM (beats per minute) of your favorite
songs. You can get a beat-count tapper for your PC (record plays, you tap o=
n
the beat for 30 seconds, it tells your BPM.) Then, write down the BPM of
your record on a piece of masking tape and stick it to the inside edge of
your record sleeve. Why? You'll find it's easier to mix songs that are
closer in BPM.



That's it. You experience will be fun initially, but Numarks are very
frustrating. Simply not the same experience, but a good rough intro.

Thanks to everyone who came out last nite for the return of the 'Subz
crew. What more could we ask for? Dnb music under the stars, with an
amazing crowd of regulars, new faces and the rockers from downstairs!
Big thanks to the Wave staff and the promoters, the dancers, the
drinkers and anyone else I've forgotten. I'm looking forward to next
week and the rest of the summer.

Big up the Southbay massive! See you next week!

As soon as the dvd was on the net a few weeks back I made sure to track it
down and watch it over and over again. The 4 segments that were on the
Animatrix website were NOT enough! I think it's number 6 that I like the
most because of it's whimsical nature. It's the one with the girl that has a
star on her face and is looking for her cat. Very dreamy. Second Renaissance
I+II, come in second because they show you the history of the Matrix and
it's formation. Flight of Osirus is somewhat critical to the background of
the current Reloaded movie and if you didn't see that prior to watching
Reloaded you're missing a chunk of story. Detective Story with animation
done by the Cowboy Bebop people is a style/segment I would love to see more
of. *GREAT* soundtrack. I will be buying both the movie and the
soundtrack(which wasn't in tower this weekend - wtf??). Meat Beat Manifesto,
Layo and Bushwacka, Juno Reactor, and more.

I can't tell you just how much better the Animatrix is compared to the
theatrical release of Reloaded. Reloaded is a crying mess that used too much
soy filler in the form of action segments while the Animatrix is pure meat.
It's the best <$20 you can spend on a movie right now.

Subject: SS last night: review

Secret Society, the weekly party held in Santa Clara, really got me moving last
night. The fun depends on your concept of a good time, because people kept
saying its really dead tonight.

Nevertheless, I believe that whenever two or three people gather together with
good music, there can be a spirit of happiness. I know that I was dancing hard
and smiling big from the vibes thrown down by Science and Justin Hale.

I forgot how much fun house music could be when handled by experienced DJs. You
guys really missed some great sets. Later, Science told me that he personally
selected old school tracks from 1993-1994 as his criteria for the night, and it
was great music.

In addition, Justin was just getting me going with too many tracks to name here.
Overall, it was a good night. I think many people chose drum & bass for their
evening, elsewhere in San Jose (KillaSubz), but if you want a good time with
room to dance in a nice setting, be sure to visit the Secret Society weekly
party (generally held every Monday night). The visuals are also great,
especially since Terry E. from SFRaves does them (Viberation). If there is no
one to dance with, you can just watch the video monitors while moving your body,
and forget about the outside world.

Disclaimer: I am not affiliated with the crew. I just like to dance.

things are so perfect that lots of times i think it would be just great to just go and relive it all again and enjoy every moment of perfection as it came to pass....just relish it all, take it all to heart, you know what i mean? been watching doctor phil again...nothing like watching people lie to themselves on national t.v....nothing like it all....anyone want to start a cult out there? just kidding...i am actually meloncholy (sp?) should anyone need to know the general feeling, but it flits, really, because, i also feel just a ton of love and relief and total caution too, and i am so grateful to the single person who started the internet who is incharge of god, creativity and the only rules that everyone understands under the ruling monolith. i am also still not looking forward to it, but looking forward to escape and also to someone else taking care of it. i think that is the definition of success. also, i would like to say nothing of it to the individuals who occasionally run in
 a couple or a gang and get it done. wow. like thanks for enhancing your imagination. it all almost seems so real when you bring other writers into the experience, say it outloud to one another, put it on paper, record it at some sort of agency and then all agree for 2.2 seconds. no one wants to be a sick fuck all alone :)

As some of you may, or may not be aware, I solicited the opinion of =
fellow SF Rave'ers to gather data on the Shure Whitelabel series of =
needles...I received an overwhelming positive response that, yes, these =
were damn fine needles. So, I bought a set.

After about 3 hours of play on one of the needles, and a very good =
initial experience in not only the new design but the overall boost in =
sound quality, all of a sudden it wouldn't grab the groove of the vinyl =
and was literally sliding across the whole record...not a very good =
impression, especially since I had already sold my Nightclubs'...

So I emailed a fellow from shure on the www.needlz.com website. He told =
me to ship the entire unit to him, he would take a look at it and get =
back to me. So I sent him the whole unit, and let him know that without =
needles I can't play, so please be quick about it. As soon as he =
received the tracking number, not the actual shipment, he "FedEx =
Priority Overnight" shipped me a whole new unit and extra stylus, for my =
troubles he said. I received a replacement in less than 10 hours.=20

I am writing to share this because I am completely flattered in the =
attention I received from the shure corporation and the integrity they =
showed in standing behind their product...It turned out nothing was =
wrong with the needle...I had it adjusted the wrong way at 49 mm, not =
the recommended 52 mm, and the wires were hitting the record. Regardless =
of my "stupidity" in not noticing this, I often find that there are =
those in this industry that are scammers, liars, purveyors of false =
promises, and overall real shitheads when it comes to getting product =
support. I believe shure stands apart from these characters and they now =
have a customer for life. [applause]

  Marijuana Reform

--=====================_12703430==_.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

** DEA Uses RAVE Act to Stop a Benefit to Raise Money for Marijuana Reform


**Fax the DEA and Tell Acting Administrator William Simpkins to Stop Using 
the RAVE Act Against Political Events 
http://actioncenter.drugpolicy.org/ctt.asp?u=488&l=2008


Only two months after the RAVE Act was passed by Congress it has been used 
by the federal Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to intimidate the 
owners of a Billings, Montana, venue into canceling a combined benefit for 
the Montana chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of 
Marijuana Laws (NORML) and Students for Sensible Drug Policy (SSDP). One of 
the biggest reasons the Drug Policy Alliance waged a national campaign to 
stop the RAVE Act was that we feared it would be used to shut down 
political events like this.


On the day the fundraiser was set to take place a Billings-based DEA agent 
presented the venue owners with a copy of the RAVE Act warning them that 
they could face a fine of $250,000 if illicit drugs were found in the 
premises. The bands - most of which regularly played at the venue - were 
also approached and warned that their participation in the event could 
result in a fine.


Rather than risk the possibility of enormous fines, the venue decided to 
cancel the event. This blatant intimidation by the DEA was obviously 
designed to shut down the marijuana reform fundraiser. Unless the American 
people speak out against this attack on free speech, the DEA will be 
emboldened to use the law against other events they do not like, such as 
all-night dance parties, hip hop concerts, hemp festivals, and circuit parties.


Join the Drug Policy Alliance, National Organization for the Reform of 
Marijuana Laws, Students for Sensible Drug Policy, and numerous other 
organizations in our campaign to pressure the DEA to stop using the RAVE 
Act to shut down political events.


ACTIONS TO TAKE


1) Fax the DEA. Urge Acting Administrator William Simpkins to stop using 
the RAVE Act to harass innocent business owners and stifle free speech.
http://actioncenter.drugpolicy.org/ctt.asp?u=488&l=2008


2) Forward this alert to friends and family. Send it to e-mail lists and 
post it in chat rooms.

BACKGROUND


Sponsored by Senator Biden (D-DE), the RAVE Act (also known as the Illicit 
Drug Anti-Proliferation Act) was first introduced last year. It proved so 
controversial then that two of its original co-sponsors withdrew their 
support because they feared it would send innocent business owners to jail. 
Business owners collected over 20,000 signatures in opposition to the 
bill.   Protests against it were held around the country and tens of 
thousands of voters urged their elected official to oppose it. Controversy 
over the bill stalled it last year, but Senator Biden attached it to the 
popular "Amber Alert" bill without public debate or a vote of Congress 
earlier this year and snuck it into law.


The RAVE Act expands federal law to make it easier to jail and imprison 
event organizers and property owners that fail to stop drug offenses from 
occurring on their property - even in cases when they take serious steps to 
reduce drug offenses. It applies to "any place", including bars and 
nightclubs, hotels, apartment buildings, and homes. Legal experts warned 
that the law was so broad that it could be used to shut down not only raves 
and electronic music events, but also Hip Hop, rock, and country music 
concerts, sporting events, gay and lesbian fundraisers, political protests, 
and any other event federal agents do not like.

On May 30th an agent of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) told 
managers of the Eagle Lodge in Billings, Montana that the Lodge could be 
fined $250,000 if anyone smoked marijuana during a planned benefit to raise 
money for a campaign to change Montana's medical marijuana law. After 
consulting their attorneys, the Eagle Lodge canceled the event.

what the heck is APT ?  surely it's not a thread about solication for a new domicile, and it's not
ATP, which is another acronym that escapes me...  obviously having no correlation with All Tomorrows
Parties, even if it's All Parties Tomorrow ! haha

so what gives ?  guess i missed the "memo."

well, back to those TPS reports...

Zeel is one alias for him and Polyvinyl is his production alias.  I
think he's playing original stuff - hence the Polyvinyl alias.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] [NRR] Space Girl (2002 Metropolis DJ)

Spacegirl is one person. She performs live only last time I knew but I
could be wrong. She tends to make beats a little on the hard trance side
of the field almost a little like NY Hard house but it depends on the
ear. I am not sure about a website she used to be represented by Grey
Multimedia but she is not listed on their site anymore. Peace and good
luck

Hip Hop Activism Buds Beautifully

By Opio Lumumba Sokoni, J.D., AlterNet
June 10, 2003

Harry Belafonte stated to me in an interview that entertainers have the=20
responsibility to speak out on issues concerning the community. He also=20
said that entertainers are so often used to take people's minds off real=20
issues and that entertainers who do not act are part of the problem. In a=20
recent Wall Street Journal article entitled, "Mean Street Theater," written=
=20
by John McWhorter, he called social and political contributions to the=20
community made by rapper's "sideline donations." About the recently slain=20
rap artist Camoflauge, McWhorter writes, "Despite his searingly profane,=20
violent lyrics, [he] was regularly invited to speak at Savannah high=20
schools." This article could have been more appropriately titled, "Mean=20
Muggin' Hip Hop."

There's more. The article went on to run off other artists, i.e. Tupac,=20
Biggie, and Jam Master Jay as products of the genre. Never mind the=20
failings of law enforcement who have yet to find the killers of any of=20
these men. But, they could find any small-time hustlers in the hood and=20
lock them up for years and years for a nonviolent offense, i.e. drug=20
possession.

This brings me to the most appealing part of the piece. While the author=20
gave credit to Russell Simmons' Hip Hop Action Network for setting a goal=20
to register millions of hip hop voters for the 2004 elections, he asked a=20
poignant question. "What does the organization want the hip-hop generation=
=20
to vote for?" If for nothing else, his article should have been printed for=
=20
this query.

It is true that Hip Hop has to have a political issue or issues to mobilize=
=20
around. And we got issues; no doubt about that. Well, Russell Simmons, P=20
Diddy, Jay Z and many other hip hoppers are right on point in their effort=
=20
to address what should be the number one issue to focus hip hop activism =96=
=20
fighting against the failed war on drugs. These celebrities are doing=20
exactly what Mr. Belafonte says is expected of them.

This is a perfect issue for hip hop activism because the lives affected the=
=20
greatest are in the same communities that Hip Hop most represents. In=20
addition, the unchecked drug war is now devastating lives in white=20
communities as well. But what makes this an even greater issue for the hip=
=20
hop generation is the fact that it is The Issue of our time.

No other cause has as many moving parts as the issues associated with the=20
failed drug war. First, the war on drugs has created a prison population=20
that should be an embarrassment to any rational person. I do not know any=20
African-American that does not have a personal connection to someone in=20
jail for a drug crime. Most of the over two million people in jail are=20
non-violent, low-level drug offenders who would be better in treatment,=20
therapy, job training and/or on a job than in jail. But instead, the war on=
=20
drugs has delivered young bodies to jails that are used to support the=20
heartbreaking reality of the prison industrial complex.

Second, our babies are in foster care in high numbers because their parents=
=20
have been given long sentences, usually for minor use or possession=20
charges. In Washington, DC, an estimated 70% of the children who are in=20
foster care are there directly or indirectly due to drug addiction. There=20
are no studies that show prison as being better than treatment for a parent.

Finally, aside from the other civil and human rights problems related to=20
the war on drugs, i.e. a person losing the right to vote or a person being=
=20
denied financial aid for college, there is the matter of racism. The=20
fallout from the drug war has been more devastating than the KKK lynchings=
=20
of the 1920s. Young people are racially targeted, set up, captured,=20
convicted, sentenced and jailed at a staggering rate.

A 2000 Human Rights Watch report confirms that in Wisconsin a black man is=
=20
53 times more likely to go to prison on a drug charge than a white man.=20
This rate is reported to be the second highest in the country and more than=
=20
4 times the national average. Only Illinois ranked higher - there, a black=
=20
man is 57 times more likely to go to prison on a drug charge.

In New York, 94% of the people sentenced under the Rockefeller drug laws=20
are from Black and Latino communities. That's right, 94 percent. Debra=20
Small, who works for Drug Policy Alliance, says that the Rockefeller drug=20
laws are the granddaddy of the federal mandatory sentencing laws. A=20
low-level drug offender can be sentenced to 15 years to life if convicted.

I recently met a victim of the Rockefeller drug laws named Anthony Papa who=
=20
is the painter of "15 Years to Life: Self Portrait". Anthony, spent twelve=
=20
years in a maximum-security prison for passing an envelope containing 4=20
ounces of cocaine. When asked about this law, he says, "The millions of=20
dollars being spent to house non-violent persons can be used to feed the=20
hungry, put shoes on children's feet and spent on education."

Russell Simmons' Hip Hop Action Network has decided to work with Mothers of=
=20
the New York Disappeared and other activists, celebrities and organizations=
=20
to change these laws. A victory in New York could have a domino affect=20
among other states that have adopted similar drug policies. Further, this=20
may be the catalyst to make drug policy reform front and center in the 2004=
=20
elections.

Hip Hop is coming into political maturity and can work to change some of=20
the realities that are reported so vividly in rap lyrics. It is so=20
fascinating how music has always been a part of social action in the black=
=20
community. During slavery, coded songs were used to take persons to=20
freedom. In the civil rights movement, marchers sang songs like, "Ain't=20
Gonna Let Nobody Turn Me Round." Now, there is an entire genre that is=20
budding into full political awareness. How beautiful. And, it does not look=
=20
like a mere "sideline donation" to me.

Subject: BSP Jason Philips Hot August Tour

	I am looking of for a few dates in the San Francisco area during
August 17th thru the 20th. If anyone has a show going on at that time
and would like to consider having me on their lineup contact me at
JasonPhilips@Compos-Mentis.Org prices are negotiable since I will be in
the area on my way south. If you need to hear my mix go to
http://www.flavoredclubbing.com/strawberry/ohmix2.ram and for my fairly
complete bio go to
http://www.compos-mentis.org/portal/modules/cdbase/index.php?id_art=11  

This is a chance to not have to pay travel costs and have a decent out
of town dj on your lineup. I have eight years of experience on the decks
and spin all kinds of house mostly dubby and deep. So what are you
waiting for get in touch. Peace

	Really if you have issues with me speak to me instead of trying
to put it in front of a panel. I promote myself here because I used to
live in the bay area and love to keep up with events and happening down
that way. If you feel it is spam don't open the email. I take part in a
lot of discussions on this list and try to be an active member to say
all I do is spam the list is wrong. I am sorry your bookings are not
going so well but that is life at least I am taking initiative that is
how you succeed in this world be it djing or just everyday life. Sorry I
try to limit any mail asking for bookings and think I have done very
well. I will be in the bay area around the time mentioned to visit
family and thought it appropriate to see if I could hook up a booking or
two before heading down to LA. Peace

Subject: RE: [sfraves] BSP Jason Philips Hot August Tour - Jack Triumph joins in.

It is true Jason has contributed to this list over the past couple of months 
  that I have seen.

And it does not hurt to BSP your goods to the list..

However my experience as a DJ/promoter in this area for the past 6 years has 
been. If you are an out of town DJ Most likely you will not get booked in SF 
Unless there are 2 factors.

1.) You have records out on a fairly decent label and are somewhat known
2.) You know the promoter personally.


There are those rare cases where a promoter takes a chance on what some 
might consider a fairly popular DJ in another state/area.. But that is 
pretty few and far between (IMO)

I mean why book some "Knowbody" from another state when you can call up 
Jeno,Garth,Mark Farina,Mars,Mystre etc... and Just book them.. We have some 
of the best and well know Producer/DJ's in the world right here in our own 
hometown. And if your party is small enough alot of those jocks will play 
for a decent rate.

Thats just my 50cent   ;)

	I do understand how hard it can be to be a smaller dj and try to
get bookings in another city but it doesn't hurt to try. I believe in
hard work and its payouts. I appreciate the feedback from all of you and
please if you have more keep it coming I do listen to the comments and
take as much as I can constructively. Peace

joins in.

It is true Jason has contributed to this list over the past couple of
months 
  that I have seen.

And it does not hurt to BSP your goods to the list..

However my experience as a DJ/promoter in this area for the past 6 years
has 
been. If you are an out of town DJ Most likely you will not get booked
in SF 
Unless there are 2 factors.

1.) You have records out on a fairly decent label and are somewhat known
2.) You know the promoter personally.


There are those rare cases where a promoter takes a chance on what some 
might consider a fairly popular DJ in another state/area.. But that is 
pretty few and far between (IMO)

I mean why book some "Knowbody" from another state when you can call up 
Jeno,Garth,Mark Farina,Mars,Mystre etc... and Just book them.. We have
some 
of the best and well know Producer/DJ's in the world right here in our
own 
hometown. And if your party is small enough alot of those jocks will
play 
for a decent rate.

Thats just my 50cent   ;)

he posted what he posted in respose to what U posted Dude... but he was jus' 
like well.... U posted the same post about gettin' Bay Area gigs 4 a while 
now... isn't this like your 4th or 5th post like in a week?  Hello 2day, & 
like after reading your respose 2 Jack... I haven't seen you really partake 
any discussions on this list really!  I have seen you promote yourself a few 
times la la la.... & yeah... speaking of the list.... you'd know who the 
promoters are & email them directly instead of spamming the whole list, 
right?  Or atleast email a promoter & ask them 2 direct U in the right 
direction atleast.... or maybe do a yahoo search & find out where hmmmmmm... 
I dunno....

I'm sorry 4 jumping on your caser like this Dude, but I dunno... it seems 
unfair that U made that post! Fee is negotiable???? WTF is that about???  I

Atleast if U do it that way, U won't resttrict or limit yourself to 1 or 2 
gigs!  Fee...lololololololololol.... my ass!  The SF market is hard 2 break 
in & U should know that!! =)

I'm not discrediting you on where you've spun 'cause I did look @ your 
profile thingie & U have like totally spun @ Mondo events!  I mean... it's 
totally impressive 2 B a Local hero according 2 your profile =)  BUt if U 
keep up w/ events here like U say in your email... then U would totally know 
who 2 email in terms of getting a gig then spamming a whole list!!!  I 
mean... if U've been on SFR this long... then U'd have 2 of made other 
contacts by now... right?  I mean... breaking in2 the SF Night life scene is 
a hard thing 2 do & I've seen many unknown DJs from outta town play @ events 
here in SF!!  LIke when Jade Bassiz & Kid Wikkid from PDX (where you're 
from, right?) came in2 town... they came in via the SisterSF connection & 
spun like @ 3-4 gigs!  Or like when Jacob Cino came from Canada, I know 4 a 
fact his manager, Meagan,  got in contact w/ some1 who contacted other 
promoters & that's how he spun out here!  Then like Jacob Cino got 2 spin @ 
like 3 events while he was here....

Oh Gosh... I sound like a total jerk & this is kinda unlike me 2 email some1

You know I was going to write some big reply but I figure I am not that
petty. Say all you want I am happy in my bookings and enjoy them. I have
spun next to some great talent big and small. I find it noble that you
defend your boys. I actually have spoken to Jack off the list and we
discussed everything and all is well. So have a good day move on to
someone else because today your words fall on deaf ears. Peace

My brother being the big guy he is got all teary eyed and said on the way out of the service to me sis, I don't no what all of the fuss is about I only did my job.  I looked up at him(just because he's younger he's alot taller at 6'5) and said well bro, you troops have so many people that want to thank you for what you've done.  There are alot of us that support all of you that have been there and those that remain.  We both cried and he said well I'm glad I was able to do it, but I was just doing my job.  The troops see what they are doing as their job, but they will always hold a special place in alot of our hearts.  My brother is a hero, and my boyfriend who is still in Iraq is a hero, as well as the loved ones each of you have had over there or are still over there are all heroes.  Most importantly those that didn't make it back will be heroes and shall never be forgotten.  I want to say thank you to the troops for their service for our country!

I'm looking for a set of Sony V700's (silver headphones) that have =
broken like 90% of them do. They're going to be dismantled so it doesn't =
matter if the headband part has cracked and the headphone cup has fallen =
out. Depending on the condition of them I'll pay up to $30. Figure =
that's a $30 discount off a new pair for you!

how many times have i seen or made posts on sfr that ask for something random, and you get like 5 
responses online and maybe a few offline?  it's a great thing, but it just makes me think ... 

what is the most random thing you've ever seen asked for on sfraves?  

what is the most random thing you could think of to ask the sfr community to give you guidance on?  
portable manicures, perhaps?  maybe something even more random?!

*BARF*!

However touching it may be to you, it is NOT relevant for the majority
of the people here. Please, keep this jingoistic crap off our list, or
at least have the decency to prefix the subject with "NRR" so we know to
just trash it.

Or if you are cheap and a crazy DIY type:

Go to Home Depot, pick up some vinyl -- all construction workers use it.
You may get more than you need so get some scissors and cut the size you
want, grab a couple sprockets so you can punch holes in the vinyl where
you want to hang it. Also get a couple cans of spray paint, make sure to
get white as the base, a couple rolls of shelf lining and an exacto
blade and do it yourself.

Total price will be about 10 bux and maybe 3 hours labor depending on
the intricacies of your banner.

Well, I certainly didn't expect the kind of backlash I've received thus
far, but allow me to elaborate a bit further as to why I feel this type
of content doesn't belong on sfraves:

This looks to me like one of those emails that somebody either wrote
honestly (or worse, made up), then sent out to everyone they possibly
could. Shiny happy Americans around the country got it, thought it was
nice, and forwarded it to all their friends. The message is attributed
to:

Imhere4u478 <imhere4u478@aol.com>

...who appares to have originally sent it (CC'ing him/herself, so we'll
have to also assume that he/she BCC'd a bunch of other people at the
same time) to "militaryfamilyus@groups.aol.com", which is, presumably,
an online support group for families with members in the military.
We don't know if it's genuine. If the person that posted it to this
list appeared to have had some personal connection to the subject(s),
then I would've given him/her some slack, but c'mon... Basically, it's
just patriotic spam from somebody with a family member in the military.

No regard for the thousands dead and still dying in Iraq; no regret for
having supported a military force that tore a country to shreds under
false pretenses; just thankfulness that their baby got home in one piece
so they could "attend church" together. That's American jingoism at its
best.

Look, I'm sorry if my response offended anyone, but I feel very strongly
that this crap does not belong here. I'll be happy to belate the point
further offlist, if anyone's interested :)

so like my son asked me to read the instructions on a web-game he's playing
on cartoonnetwork.com ...  he's only 7 and he didn't know some of the words...
i was surprised by what words they were using and the "plot" of the game.

Subject: BSP: Jack Triumph on An Epiphany Of Sound tomorrow

Join us Thursday morning as we have a secured a 3 hour progressive baptism
for all. Jack Triumph will be in rare form for a 3 hour appearance in
support of his new monthly event, "Sacred Institution" and the August 2003
release of his Progressive/Breaks Double Disc, entitled, "Empire". Tune in @
9am as DJ Triumph will spin an assortment of progressive / tribal house
cuts. We will be giving away 10 spots on the guest list for the June 15th
event, "Sacred Institution", and listeners who call in will have also have a
chance to win a copy of either of his released mixset albums, "Paganism", or
"Regressive Progressive: Evolution of the Dirty Beat".

Over the past 2 1/2 years DJ Triumph has become obsessed with spreading his
ideology of music and obtaining performances. He has been very fortunate to
play countless house parties, bar gatherings and other <100 person events.
Spinning a wicked assortment of dark, tribal influenced, tech/progressive
beats, he shuns all popular opinion in exchange for musical freedom. He has
played the Annual Boardstock event 3 years running, is a repeat guest on
KZSU Radio and held down a year long "downtempo" residency at the Paragon
lounge, located in the Claremont Hotel. In March 2003, he was selected to
play the Qoöl "Wednesday Night Happy Hour", at the 111 Minna Street Gallery,
where he shared the decks with Spesh, Scott Carrelli and Gee Moore. His has
been selected to make a repeat appearance at Qoöl on July 30th, 2003.

Jack feel's very positive about the impact that he can make in exposing the
masses to the dark tribal beat. "Right now I am focusing on obtaining more
shows, and becoming aligned with similar minded people who share my passion.
Whether that opportunity comes from a record label, or a small crew of DJ's,
it doesn't matter to me." He added, "Moving forward, I am not concerned with
people perceiving me as not being 'underground' enough," he said. "What
concerns me is to deliver and maintain the integrity of this art form, in a
balance act that will allow me to stay loyal to myself and still deliver
driving bass to the masses every time. In essence," he added, "to unleash my
reality of paganism."

--=====================_14741351==_.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

Fifth Estate, the oldest anarchist publication in the USA, has just 
published an article by me titled  "Electronic Dance Music & Social 
Liberation:  Sacred, Sweet, Wicked Ecstasy"  (Summer 2003, Vol. 38 #2, 
361).  The piece appears in FS's Music and Dance Issue.  Much of "Sweet 
Ecstasy" comes from "House Music 101."

Fifth Estate has no paid staff or copyright, so I am reproducing the 
article below since it is timely and a reaction to the RAVE Act.  FS is 
funded solely by subscription and purchases so I hope some of you pick up a 
copy.  I know Bound Together Book Store on the Haight carries it.

Much love,

Apollo

_______________________________________________________

Editors' note: Thanks to some typically sleazy last-minute conniving by 
Democratic Party Senator Joseph Biden, the "Reducing Americans' 
Vulnerability to Ecstasy" (R.A.V.E.) Act was signed into Federal law by 
Bush on April 30, 2003. The bill's introduction says in no uncertain terms 
that raves are "drug dens" where promoters sell illegal drugs and charge 
exorbitant prices for Ecstasy paraphernalia, such as bottled water, massage 
oil, and glow sticks. Under the law's measures, property 
owners/renters/leasers and event promoters are criminally liable for drug 
use on their premises and may be fined up to $250,000 and nine years in 
prison. The effect, of course, is to discourage the execution of any 
electronic music events since the actions of just one dancer could result 
in jail time for event organizers.

The rationale for the R.A.V.E. Act (and similar state and municipal 
anti-rave laws) is allegedly to open up another front in the ludicrous War 
on [some] Drugs. But it appears that Ecstasy is mentioned by name in the 
law only in the interest of a cutesy acronym logo, as cops and prosecutors 
have said explicitly that they are looking to go after crank and pot users 
as well. However, in the following article, Apollo offers a deeper look 
into anti-rave legislation. This is an excerpt of a much longer work by 
Apollo on the social history of underground dance and the evolution of 
electronic dance music in the US.  The work is being rewritten for 
publication at a later date.  Apollo is a rave producer, founder of the 
Moksha Tribe collective, a house music DJ, and has been involved with dance 
culture for over thirty years.  He lives in San Francisco.


Sacred, Sweet, Wicked Ecstasy
by Apollo


Those who believe that the current oppression of raves (and dance culture 
in general) is based entirely on a desire to stop the spread of the drug 
Ecstasy are missing the broader context. Crucial to understanding this 
atmosphere of police and governmental oppression is our culture's long 
historical fear of the union of body and soul represented by dance. If we 
are to fight this new wave of repression effectively, we must first 
understand something about the hate, fears, and prejudice of what really 
drives it beyond anti-drug rhetoric.

The house and modern electronic dance music scenes grew out of an oppressed 
peoples' need to build alternative communities in which they find refuge 
from the bigotry and racism of mainstream culture. The new dance culture 
arose, as did prior musical and dance movements in this country, from 
underground subcultures, evolving spiritually and aesthetically in the US 
out of the need for African-Americans, gays, lesbians and Latinos to build 
a community through dance.

Before the Stonewall bar uprising in Greenwich Village in 1969, the gay 
subculture was really an underground, secret society: all states outlawed 
gay sex by prohibiting sodomy and related non-standard sexual practices 
(some still have sodomy laws on the books).

Further, same-sex dancing was prohibited. And these laws were enforced: 
police regularly raided gay clubs and other meeting places, packed the 
participants off to jail, charged them with a variety of morals related 
offenses and, the worst part for most, published their names in local 
newspapers, all of which gave most pre-'69 gay dance clubs the clandestine 
feel of underground raves or of  speakeasies during Prohibition.

In the years after Stonewall and before AIDS, tens of hundreds of 
oppressed, abused, rejected gay kids who had experienced the worst kind of 
mind-fucking while growing up in rural and suburban American poured into 
NYC to express themselves freely as sexual beings for the first time. Some 
had never actually seen a room full of people like themselves. They 
certainly had no support groups or community to grow into.

For them, this was the fulfillment of a secret and distant dream: life for 
the first time. They wanted to build a world that accepted them, where they 
could have sexual relationships without punishing guilt, self-hatred or 
suicidal thoughts. Among other things, these sexual rebels started to build 
a new paradigm for social interactions on the dance floor, intuitively 
based on ancient rituals. Instinctively they seemed to know that dance 
would help make them whole-- dance would exalt both their bodies and souls. 
They would be FREE for the first time, and they would be freed from 
oppression, in part, through the power of communal dance.


Dancing is the Devil's Work

It is the body, of course, which is the vehicle of dance, meaning that 
people's attitudes towards dance are shaped by cultural and religious 
beliefs about the body and its uses. From its start, Christianity developed 
a complex love-hate relationship with the body for a variety reasons. For 
one, early Christians wished to disassociate themselves from pagan beliefs.

Linked to this was the influence of Neo-Platonist philosophy-- there's no 
need to get into a detailed discussion of philosophy here except to say 
that early Christian thought was fueled by the Neo-Platonic teaching that 
flesh was inferior to the intellect and the spirit. (This has always been a 
paradox to me, for the core belief of Christianity, the incarnation, seems 
to be a powerful metaphor for the need to redeem the soul through the 
flesh.) From this we arrive at the dreadful bifurcation of the body and the 
soul and the origin of much unhappiness in our culture.

  It may have been Increase Mather who defined the American Puritan 
attitude towards dance in 1685 with his tract against "Mixed or Promiscuous 
Dancing" : "sober and grave Dancing of Men with Men, or of Women with 
Women" was okay "in due season and with moderation," but "wanton" (that it 
is to say, "pleasurable") dancing, especially "Gynecandrical Dancing," was 
literally considered evil. When one recalls that US Attorney-General John 
Ashcroft adheres to a Christian sect that forbids dancing, we can see how 
little has really changed in three hundred years.

Puritanism remains as powerful a force in politics and culture as ever. 
Work, the Puritan focal point, is the centerpiece of our daily lives, and 
pleasure is still suspect. Anything that is perceived to interfere with 
productivity of the individual is damned. In Mather's day, the controllers 
used hell-fire sermons as the vehicle of social control; now it's anti-drug 
pseudo-science.

Dance culture has always been under very heavy fire in this country. My 
grandmother was arrested repeatedly during Prohibition when she went 
dancing at jazz clubs in the twenties, not because she was drinking the 
devil's brew, but because she was dancing the devil's dance.

Dancing to rock 'n' roll was bitterly opposed because it was believed that 
this passionate "Negro" music (facilitated by "reefer madness") would lead 
to teenage promiscuity and social chaos.

For a few brief years in the seventies, everyone, even the elite white man, 
was disco dancing, but this came to an end in the Reagan years when we were 
all reminded of the Puritan dictum that playing too hard can lead to 
unhappiness, and making money was a far more acceptable and righteous way 
to spend one's time.

No, things haven't changed that much. Good, righteous mainstream Americans 
don't dance all night long to tribal beats of the devil's music because it 
may reduce productivity and undermine the Gross National Product.

Pagan beats --those of house music, in particular, given its evocative 
fleshy-spiritual dimensions--  unleash all those disorderly pagan 
connections between the body and soul, and we can't have that in this 
rigidly controlled, work- and money-oriented Puritan society that we all 
seem to accept without question. Puritans, after all, are suspicious of 
pleasure, especially pleasures of the flesh.


The Ancient Rites of House Music

It's got something to do with the speed of the beats. It's hypnotic, 
tribal, and primal. That particular speed has worked for thousands of 
years, which is why you can spin in Arab music, Bhangra music, Aboriginal 
music... You can take all these different cultures and find the same beat, 
between 125-130 bpm. It's there in ecstatic, trance music, where people 
shake and spin until they reach a state of hyperventilation and psychedelic 
alpha-wave experience. In a sense (house) is regressive music. You're going 
back to the roots of why music was invented: to reach ecstatic and 
visionary states, in a communal tribal celebration.

                                                         Simon Reynolds, 
"Where 'now' lasts longer,"
                                                                 in Blissed 
Out (London: Serpent's Tail, 1990)

The belief that individuals can achieve spiritual liberation through 
communal dance and sexuality is nothing new. The concept of salvation 
through music, dance and eroticism is ancient and can be found in both 
Eastern and Western cultures. Many specifically religious rituals were, and 
still are, constructed around communal dance -- often with a sexual component.

It is primarily in the West, however, that one encounters the total divorce 
of body and soul. This distinction between the sacred and secular, the 
spirit and the flesh, is part of the Judeo-Christian tradition but has 
little currency in non-Western cultures. In pre-Christian Polynesia, for 
example, communal dance and sexuality were integrated into daily life. The 
arioi (a troupe of dancers-actors) would go from island to island to 
celebrate the cult of Oro, god of rain and fertility.

The core of their performance was sacred dance where the men would wear 
mock phalluses made from animal bladders and simulate sexual intercourse. 
On Tahiti, men and women danced day and night to praise their gods, 
celebrate the completion of various communal projects, honor the chiefs, 
and for the sheer fun of it.

  Dance was also an extremely important feature of many American Indian 
religious rituals. The Hopi calendar revolved around a sacred dance cycle, 
and they used dance to connect with the very forces that they believed 
governed the universe, such as the Snake Dance held in late summer to 
summon life-giving rain. The gods dance in India, and Shiva, the god of 
creation and destruction, is represented as Nataraja, Lord of Dance. Shiva 
is depicted as a four-armed deity, shown in a dancing mode, his raised left 
leg signifying that one of the blessings of dance is to free the dancer 
from worldly cares. The Yoruba of southwestern Nigeria believe dance opens 
direct channels to the gods, and speak of actually being "mounted" by a god 
during a sacred dance in which the dancer actually makes the god within his 
or her body while in a deep trancelike state.

  One could cite many other examples of non-Western traditions where dance 
plays a crucial role in ritual and worship. In the West, however, there is 
much ambivalence about dancing in any context, and especially the religious.

  Judeo-Christian culture embraced the notion of the bifurcation of body 
and soul, adopted a fearful attitude towards dance that aroused bodily 
passion, especially in a spiritual context and, for the most part, confined 
dancing to a strictly secular activity. Although the Hasidic movement of 
the eighteenth century and some visionary Protestant sects like the Shakers 
incorporated ecstatic dance into worship, mainstream Western 
Judeo-Christian societies from the Renaissance onward severed dancing from 
any spiritual content.

While I have always felt that the best communal dance experiences were 
transformative events where body and soul, sexuality and spirituality, 
worked together to produce a very valuable altered state of consciousness, 
it was not until I studied non-Western cultures that I came to understand 
that what I once thought was addictive behavior was actually an ancient and 
very natural part of life.

This ecstatic dance was the glue that bonded many of the world's tribal and 
other communities, and it was the source of energy and validation of the 
self and soul in the intentional communities in which I lived most fully. 
 From African priests to Korean shamans, there was and still is the belief 
that dance and music can open communication with intangible powers and 
produce tangible benefits for the communities involved: self-knowledge, 
fuller understanding of the natural world, good health, and a sense of 
belonging to a supportive group in an often dark and hostile but ultimately 
understandable universe.

The exquisite integration of the erotic and the spiritual in early house 
music partly derives, I believe, from primarily non-Western traditions of 
salvation and release through communal music and dance.

It's not at all surprising that African-American culture gave birth to the 
modern yet ecstatic, erotic yet spiritual dance experiences and music in 
underground gay venues like the Paradise Garage and the Warehouse. The vibe 
of these parties was intensely pagan, non-Western, and exuberantly 
non-Puritan.

The dancers were people who were all about loss of control and of giving 
oneself over to a collective eroticism, a movement into an altered state of 
consciousness resembling that spoken by the ancients when they describe 
possession by spirits. I believe that all of us who were passionate about 
this new dance experience knew intuitively at the time that what we were 
doing was something far more ambitious than throwing parties. This was 
about liberation of the loins and the soul through music and dance.

That said, though, I want to be clear that I am in no way suggesting that 
the form and content of house music was intentionally designed to resurrect 
some pagan tribal rituals. This desire was, I believe, bubbling below the 
surface as part of some natural need that is consciously suppressed in the 
West. The context in which house was born --oppression, mortality connected 
to sexuality, the need for redemption and release through communal dance-- 
brought these needs and ancient rites to the surface, and the body and soul 
were once again united in music and dance. Much of the early rave community 
was well aware of these pagan erotic, spiritual ecstatic trance dance 
experiences, and this may explain why the spiritual symbols used at early 
raves were intentionally non-Western and most often evoked Eastern and 
Hindu erotic-spiritual dance traditions. To this day, these intentions are 
still clearly evident at many electronic dance music events, especially 
those given by the psytrance community, where the connections are more 
explicit.

  With these issues underlying and informing the electronic dance 
experience, it is no wonder that dance culture is again a source of moral 
panic for a full spectrum of cultural authorities. The language of these 
crackdowns always comes wrapped in the codes of law enforcement and public 
safety-- after its investigation of electronic dance music subcultures, 
Congress declared that "raves have become little more than a way to exploit 
American youth."

And though anti-rave bills are most commonly associated with Ecstasy, it is 
not the drug and drug dealers that are really the issue, but rather the 
ecstasies of the dance. The Puritanical terror of the ecstatic movement of 
bodies has been drafted into the Drug War, and unless we work to subvert 
the Puritan paradigm and fundamentally change this culture's anxieties over 
unruly flesh and mind, more of this kind oppression should be expected.

the credits music on that is something I have but I

it's kinda like an object lesson in the ups and downs
of Hollywood. if you make a hit movie, you get the
option of releasing an anime DVD in America and
selling it to a mass audience -- pretty unusual, and
pretty cool. not something everybody gets to do!

but the downside is, you *have* to make a sequel, and
you *have* to work with six times the budget of your
first movie, and you *have* to deal with twenty times
as many people breathing down your neck about it and
endlessly "improving" your script.

but that's sequels. I can only think of three sequels
that were better than the original movies, and two out
of those three were by Jim Cameron. legendary
filmmaker, legendary asshole too. I read somewhere
that people in LA have t-shirts that say "You can't
scare me, I've worked with Jim Cameron."

Peace Orchestra - Who Am I is the credits track, but the soundtrack version
is slightly different with Animatrix samples. I've heard it somewhere else
before and feel like I have that track too. Can't figure out where though...

how does making it a realplayer file enable everyone to listen? i'd imagine
that would hinder most people's abilities to listen to the file now. if you
want maximum exposure mp3 is the way to go, there's free players available
for every platform, and the sound quality, even at low bit-rates, is leaps
and bounds beyond that of realplayer.

STOP THE INSANITY, REALAUDIO IS DEAD.

June 13, 2003

HIGH OCTANE <~~mini-MASSIVE

============================

 

LOCK N LOAD

The Lock N' Load project consists of two Dutch producers / DJs: Frank van Rooijen and Niels Pijpers. One fine day the Club Caviar boys came to visit the Lock N' Load studio, heard the old version of a song and offered to do a remix of it. In collaboration with Lock N' Load they delivered this stunning result and Niels decided to release "Blow Ya Mind". After all on Blue White Records, within a period of three weeks, it became the No. 1 club record in the Netherlands, and Europe followed soon after that, the United Kingdom was ready to be conquered. Through no. 1 positions in both the UK Club and UK Dance chart it had an amazing entry at 6. Help us welcome Lock N' Load to Sacramento.

Chris C.

Now firmly established as one of the Biggest and most popular DJ / Producers on the UK Hard House/NRG scene, Chris has masterminded the emergence and rapid success of his 3 Labels, Mohawk, Aztec and Nile. Positioning the former today as one of the genres top 5 marques. With over 30 single releases and 2 Albums to his name on various labels including Tidy Trax, Tinrib, Eve, Honeypot, Phoenix Rising, GBT, Bulletproof, etc...Chris' reputation as one of Britain's finest exponent of Hard House, both behind the decks and in the studio, continues to grow.

Whistler

Victor Cape a.k.a. Whistler shines as a highly respected DJ on the Pacific Northwest dance scene. Known for his tight mixing skills and uplifting personality behind the decks, Whistler blends energy and emotion from Hard Melodic Trance, Epic Anthems and Hard House to take his listeners on a dance floor rollercoaster ride. If being a DJ wasn't enough, he also manages Lovetribe which has quickly become one of the most well respected event productions in Seattle. It's been over a year and a half since Whistler's last performance in Northern California. So we're excited to bring him out for his first Sacramento performance!

The Right to Party

By Neal Pollack, The Brooklyn Rail
June 12, 2003

A few years ago, when I was a reporter in Chicago, I did a story on a=20
phenomenon I called "The New Prohibition." The city, for various reasons,=20
was shutting down neighborhood bars. In poor black neighborhoods, taverns=20
were the targets of moralistic church crusaders. In gentrifying=20
neighborhoods, they were the b=EAte noire of noise-averse yuppies. What was=
=20
wrong with Mayor Daley? I asked. Didn't he want Chicago to be fun anymore?

The article garnered a bit of local attention. I appeared on an episode of=
=20
a nightly public-affairs show. For once, a piece of mine actually got a few=
=20
letters to the editor. And I decided to take it further. I did a local NPR=
=20
radio commentary in which I called, tongue-in-cheekly, for a new political=
=20
party, "The Party Party," that would campaign to make Chicago the=20
freewheeling town I imagined it had once been.

Oh, how na=EFve I was then, and how foolish I feel now! Those little tavern=
=20
raids and precinct vote-dry initiatives were nothing, a little internecine=
=20
tap-dance, compared to the assault on fun currently being waged by the=20
federal government. Our right to party is being attacked by forces far more=
=20
powerful, more sinister, and more organized than Mayor Daley's liquor-law=20
enforcement bureaucracy. Everything fun about America is under serious=
 threat.

Let's review the evidence of the last few months.

In late February, DEA and Department of Justice officials arrested 55=20
people and seized thousands of dollars of drug paraphernalia during=20
"Operation Pipe Dreams." The arrests mainly targeted online bong dealers,=20
who attorney general John Ashcroft claimed had "invaded the homes of=20
families across the country without their knowledge." But also included in=
=20
the arrests were employees of several head shops in Pittsburgh, where the=20
investigation was centered. The feds even raided the California home of=20
Tommy Chong, who in mid-May pleaded guilty to conspiring to sell drug=20
paraphernalia. The most stunning quote from the whole affair came from=20
acting DEA chief John Brown, who said, "People selling drug paraphernalia=20
are in essence no different than drug dealers. They are as much a part of=20
drug trafficking as silencers are a part of criminal homicide.''

The government is equating Tommy Chong with murderous criminals. Perhaps=20
next they'll haul in Rodney Dangerfield and the inflatable pilot from=20
Airplane! Something is wrong. Very wrong.

In March, Senator Joe Biden of Delaware managed to sneak the RAVE act=20
through as an attachment to a bill establishing a national warning system=20
about child abductions. RAVE stands for, amazingly, Reducing Americans'=20
Vulnerability to Ecstasy. But its main targets are concert promoters and=20
club owners, whom the act holds to an absurd standard.

According to the law, it is illegal to "manage or control any place,=20
whether permanently or temporarily, either as an owner, lessee, agent,=20
employee, occupant, or mortgagee, and knowingly and intentionally rent,=20
lease, profit from, or make available for use, with or without=20
compensation, the place for the purpose of unlawfully manufacturing,=20
storing, distributing, or using a controlled substance."

This definition was derived from a 20-year-old federal law that permitted=20
raids on "crackhouses." The law is so broad that you could have 10 people=20
over for dinner, put on some loud music, and you've got yourself a rave. If=
=20
someone lights a joint at your "rave," and the neighbors complain about the=
=20
music, and the police are in a bad mood that night, you face decades in=20
prison. Suddenly everyone is a potential drug criminal and it's doubly=20
dangerous if there's dancing involved.

And this just in: In late May, a DEA agent in Montana threatened a venue=20
owner with a $250,000 fine, under the RAVE Act, if she hosted a joint=20
benefit for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws=20
(NORML) and Students For Sensible Drug Policy. The event was canceled. The=
=20
RAVE Act has officially arrived.

Keep in mind that these are Democrats pushing these laws. This War On Fun=20
is not single-party. That said, the Republicans seem to have a serious=20
problem with sex. The federal government's financial commitment to=20
"abstinence education" reached a new high this year. When I say a new high,=
=20
I mean $120 million. This is not the sex education we received in high=20
school. According to federal guidelines for applying for abstinence=20
education grants, a federally funded program must, among other things,=20
teach "abstinence from sexual activity outside marriage as the expected=20
standard for all school age children," and that "a mutually faithful=20
monogamous relationship in the context of marriage is the expected standard=
=20
of human sexual activity."

 From personal experience, I will agree with certain tenets, such as the=20
fact that "drug use increases vulnerability to sexual advances," and I=20
cannot argue with the fact that "sexual activity outside of the context of=
=20
marriage is likely to have harmful psychological and physical effects," but=
=20
is this really something that needs to be legislated? Can you imagine being=
=20
a teenager today in this context? Teen pregnancy and STDs are a problem,=20
for certain. But is the answer really organizations like Pennsylvania's=20
Silver Ring Thing, which, in exchange for $12 and a pledge of abstinence=20
until marriage, offers high-school students a silver ring and a Bible?=20
Sounds like a bad trade to me. Couldn't they at least throw a couple of=20
condoms into the gift pack, just to make sure?

Lest we think that these phenomena, which seem to be loosely linked, are=20
just the usual mix of anti-drug nonsense and hypocritical fundamentalism,=20
we should think again. Journalist Eric Schlosser, in his excellent new book=
=20
"Reefer Madness," drops the stunning statistic that more than 20,000=20
Americans are in prison for marijuana-related "crimes." But the current=20
trend in policy goes far beyond that. Under the RAVE act, you're guilty by=
=20
association with marijuana smokers.

Abstinence education had a foothold during Bill Clinton's America, too, but=
=20
now there's an extra moral force, and lots more money, behind the=20
preaching. When Pennsylvania Rick Santorum made his controversial remarks=20
in April about not approving of homosexual "acts," he also said, "the idea=
=20
is that the state doesn't have rights to limit individuals' wants and=20
passions. I disagree with that. I think we absolutely have rights because=20
there are consequences to letting people live out whatever wants or=20
passions they desire. And we're seeing it in our society."

What is he talking about? What consequences? As far as I'm concerned, that=
=20
phrase, from a leading Republican Senator, is an official government=20
declaration of a War On Fun. What exactly would be Rick Santorum's idea of=
=20
a good party? One where nobody got drunk or high, where nobody hooked up,=20
and where nobody danced with abandon? Why, that doesn't sound like a party.=
=20
It sounds like church.

I've had enough.

This time, for real, I'm calling for the establishment of a Party Party,=20
or, at the very least, for a Party Party attitude. I'm issuing a call to=20
arms for those of us always in need of, as the great Jeff Spicoli once=20
said, tasty waves and a cool buzz. Of course there are many issues in the=20
world that are more pressing, and we should continue to press them. But=20
Saturday night eventually comes even for the most politically committed.=20
These are tense times. People want to loosen the steam valve a little bit.=
=20
They want to participate in culture outside of the jurisdiction of federal=
=20
"morality" educators. We don't want the government telling us how to spend=
=20
our free time, sussing out and prosecuting casual drug users and harassing=
=20
nightclub owners. And for heaven's sake, give the kids some condoms.

Sex and drugs and live music make life great. These are the kinds of things=
=20
that were outlawed in Taliban-run Afghanistan. If they can't be legal and=20
easy in America, then I don't want to live here anymore. I want to live in=
=20
a place where drugs and sex are tolerated, where the government provides a=
=20
sane level of social services, where religion isn't always threatening to=20
take over the state. Amsterdam. It always comes back to Amsterdam.

Americans, we have to party. It is our right. And we have to fight for that=
=20
right. Yes, you heard me. We have to show the moralizers that they cannot=
 win.

We have to fight for our right to party.

I am so saddened by the passing of Gregory Peck, one of the great actors =
of the past. I will never forget his performance in The Omen, from 1976. =


I mourn today the loss because he was one of America's greatest actors. =
In cinematic history there have been only a handful of men who meet =
legend status, and he was one of those, and he was the last.

With his passing, we close the book on an earlier time in history when =
our only link to the outside were the movies that we got to see on the =
weekend, at 5 cents a pop.=20

Gregory Peck was one of the great ones, along with Cary Grant, John =
Wayne, William Holden, Humphrey Bogart, Peter Lorre, Tyrone Power, Clark =
Gable, Jimmy Stewart, and Henry Fonda. Now there are no more left. These =
great talents were lucky enough to be around to usher us in to the new =
age of filmmaking, and what films could offer. And now they are all =
gone. Their memories and their dreams of what they could be will live on =
forever in their films and in our memories,

I feel very strongly about this, griefstruck, although I know that Mr. =
Peck lived a wonderful life. He was a decent man, and an honest man, and =
I never got the chance to meet him but I will miss him nevertheless.
Gregory Van Pelt

Subject: [downloadable] Mongrel Seed and Noise Kombat


Just uploaded a bunch of new noise.

My live techno set from mongrel seed last weekend:  Something was clipping
at the mixer, but luckily I was recording straight from my CPU.  So, the
recording sounds better (in spots) than it did at the event.

I also put up 9 one minute noise kombat tracks.  These were composed for
the madame chao noise battle, where noise artists go head to head and the
audience votes for the winner.  I made it up three tiers to the final five
(out of 20+) with these beautiful (horrible) waveforms.

All this and my entire music archive can be found here:

http://typhoon.enabled.com/~esc/

You will need an audio player that supports the excellent ogg format.
Winamp3, or macamp are good choices.

Would love to get some feedback.

Subject: [NRR] Friday Poetry.. Lets make this a theme and see our poets out there.

Inside my head, no one sees my tears.
Inside my head, no one sees my fears
Inside my head, no one sees these dreams.
Inside my head, no one hears my screams.
Inside my head, everything makes sense.
Inside my head, life is not past tense.

Outside my head, my smile shines brightly on
Outside my head, nothing seems at all wrong
Outside my head, the world must never know
Outside my head, I will not show sorrow.
Outside my head, nothing makes sense.
Outside my head, I treat the world like a prince.

Mantra of the Altruist

Actually, the program was on from 10:00 AM to 11.  The discussion was a bit 
lop sided (against the legislation) because one of the guests from 
"Drug-free America" or something didn't appear.  You can listen to it now 
at http://tinyurl.com/a95a

The host was Angie Coiro.  Guests were: Jacob Sullum , senior editor of 
Reason magazine and author of "Saying Yes: In Defense of Drug Use" ;   Mark 
Rennie , an attorney who represents San Francisco nightclubs and promoters 
including the End-Up, Paradise Lounge, and AsiaSF  ;  and  Trinka Porrata , 
retired LAPD Narcotic Detective and private consultant on drug issues, 
specializing in designer/club drugs and raves; her clients include the 
California Attorney General's Office and the US Department of Justice.

Ms. Porrata was predictable.  She has made a career out of "uncovering" 
underground rave behaviours and making them identifiable to 
law-enforcement:  things like pacifiers and chill rooms as identifiers of 
illegal drug activity.  For a person who consults on drug issues she seems 
to know very little about actual research and data in the area.

Sullum was more interested in overall WOD issues, I think.  Rennie 
presented a good feel for the chilling effect the RAVE legislation is 
having on local club promoters.

I didn't get to hear all of it.  Interrupted by business.

Love,

Apollo

My turn:


Unrequited

Where do I go from here?
Which fork in the road do I take?
Each path can lead to some terrble fate.
Each road so inviting.
One lead by fear,
One by hope.
I am taught to stay and hang in there
But I am conditioned to run away.
I am surrounded by the results of my past mistakes.
Surrounded by painful reminders and scars.
Living life for its end,
But sometimes seeing more.

Which road will lead to my ultimate dream.
And which to my downfall.
Is what I feel real?
Or is it just what I want to feel?
The world has become so cynical
So pesimistic.
We all know it's not the Brady Bunch,
Or full house.
People die without getting to say goodbye.
People steal and do drugs,
Without getting caught and learning new ways.
Alcoholics 
Stay alcoholics.
And love can forever remain unrequited.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Hybrid boat party!

Hey,

   We were there at that party too and I've been forever bummed
by that show!  See, Hybrid played their remix of Radiohead's
"Everything In It's Right Place" which was unlicensed.  I guess
Radiohead or their label got wind of it and totally wiped that
mix off the Earth, as far as I can tell.
   I mean, their actually a pretty live PA as EDM PA's go, so
I'll never find that exact version, but I could never find *any*
Hybrid mix of that track ever since.  Anyone else have a copy? 
Ryan?  Take care....

--=====================_20232778==_.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

Many of you may remember Ggreg Taylor from Burning Man or his wonderful 
Product parties at 1015 Folsom in the early nineties.  Well, Ggreg is back 
with his own brand of magik this Saturday.


FORGOTTEN OPERA/SF - 6.14.03

San Francisco Opera is sponsoring this one-time-only party, allowing Ggreg 
Taylor (aka Nambla the Clown) to utilize their huge elaborate sets for his 
massive SOMA warehouse dance party to promote opera.  Opera is powerful 
spectacle and art on its own; combined with a wild warehouse party, this 
event will be outrageous.  And you'll only able to see it once.

Saturday, June 14, 2003
@ 44 Tehama Street (2nd St)
10pm-4am

DJ's include Lewis from Sugar opening for Jeno from Wicked's four hour set 
on the main dance floor.  Ouchy the Clown and Pinky Ring spin on the indie 
floor. It's a masked costume ball with opera ticket prizes given out for 
best costumes in four categories.

Advance tickets are available at Cafe Flore (Market @ Noe, SF) and Body 
Body Wear, 535 Castro.

Advance tickets are $20 for costumed, $25 non-costumed, and $30 at the door.

All Forgotten Opera attendees will also get vouchers for two-for-one 
tickets to this summer's opera performances (up to $135 savings).

Subject: NRR: The Tao

Some days I read a passage from the Tao and it fits so well with modern
day life here is the one I read today-


Lesson 30

Whenever you advise a ruler in the way of the Tao,
Counsel him not to use force to conquer the universe.
For this would only cause resistance.
Thorn brushes spring up wherever the army has passed.
Lean years follow in the wake of great war.
Just do what needs to be done.
Never take advantage of power.


Achieve results,
But never glory in them.
Achieve results,
But never boast.
Achieve results,
But never be proud.
Achieve results,
Because this is the natural way.
Achieve results 
But not through violence.


Force is followed by a loss of strength.
This is not the way of the Tao.
That which goes against the Tao comes to an early end.

okay, so it is a BIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIG holiday weekend...today is friday the thirteenth, then tomorrow is flag day and then sunday is FATHER'S DAY.  i have been celebrating FATHER'S DAY since last weekend, when i carried a little orange bear dressed up like a daddy EVERYWHERE I WENT....also, sometimes, if someone doesn't see you for a long, long time, and then the first time they run into you is in the dark, plus you are sort of different or something, then maybe they aren't going to recognize you, but don't despair! i am certain that the chemical attraction is still there. okay, okay. gotta go digest food that there is too much of in my tummy now. :)

the very first rave i ever attended was one of gGreg taylor's
in '89 i think.  it was at this huge warehouse on minna, and
they had trapeze artists performing above the crowd of dancers.

it was the most amazing party i'd ever been to.

every day one would call the info line for the party and it
would say something different.  sometimes they would change it
multiple times a day.  it wouldn't just give info like, "DJs
are tom suck, doh-loot, martian & mystery-e", it would say
stupid witty little things that got you hyped for the party,
pretend conversations between ditzy girls and transvestites,
and other nutty things...

bottom line:  this guy is the SHIT.  if i weren't heading off
to the desert, i'd be at this party no matter what.  :/

Yep, Ggreg is one of the best event producers I've ever met.  He was one of 
the early organizers of Burning Man, many awesome early rave parties, the 
Gay Pride Day event...all mind-bending, creative stuff.  He went to London 
and NYC for awhile.  The guy is also a programmer.

"Many persons have a wrong idea of what constitutes true happiness.  It is 
not attained through self-gratification, but through fidelity to a purpose."
-Helen Keller

"I know what the great cure is:  it is to give up, to relinquish, to

heart of the world."
-Henry Miller

"Loyalty is the realization that America was born of revolt, flourished in 
dissent, became great through experimentation. Our tradition is one of 
protest and revolt, and it is stultifying to celebrate the rebels of the 
past while we silence the rebels of the present."

I'm new to California and I have noticed there are many styles that I
have never heard before.  I prefer Euro-style trance, hard trance, and
progressive.  What clubs or raves tend to have a euro style to it?
Thanks

ravahs,

large trance abounds tonight at the DNA as we welcome back zoo-b from =
krembo and usta records in tel aviv.  zoo-b was one of the first trance =
djs we ever brought to thump back in 1999 and he is one of our favorite =
djs and people - if you've saw him with us at burning man or with M.O.S. =
at the barn, you know that his style and programming is totally unique - =
a result of his access to music that no one else can get for months or =
even years.  he was playing stuff for us 2 years ago that is just being =
released today!  to say that we're stoked to have him back is an =
understatement!

Also, performing live is Jirah - celebrating his debut cd release "Outer =
Access"! + barefoot from orangeage/aranji, psynthetic from =
g.o.a.play/aranji, ATUM of thump radio, and upstairs chilled and =
beautiful beats from todd and DJ field (interchill records) w/the sultry =
vocal stylings of irina, DJ masonic, neal and t.o.b.

http://www.thumpradio.com/thumpparty.cfm

we have a couple guest list and 2for1 spots open if you'd like to join =
us for this evening of trance-en-dance!

email me back if you know what country jirah is from...and you'll win =
tickets!

peace and see you tonight!

Subject: 1st live performance / SCREAM

Greets,

Last week I did my 1st live electronic music performance in Santa Cruz at 
ELectron_SAlon7 (www.elsaproductions.com). It went quite well; the set is 
available at a new section of my site for live sets:
http://catharsis.egregious.net/live/

This performance isn't EDM and more on the "experimental" tip. I used 
custom software I created for the performance along with an amplified and 
heavily processed (analog) violin. I feel it is marginally rave related 
though as the sample sources are 10 people from around the world saying 
"Welcome to the fucking rave." in their native language.

I am working on adding the video of the concert to a DVD that covers my 
early work.

The software environment I am creating is called SCREAM. Introductory 
information can be found here: http://audio.egregious.net/scream/
I will be updating this site soon with much more information as the project 
develops. Soon, modules will be available publicly and eventually a 
developers API to build modules will be released for programmers.

I also collected all the media (audio/visual) links on the Egregious site 
and they can be found here:
http://www.egregious.net/media/

I put up mp3s of Timeless Beginnings and Live @ Minimal Monday for those of 
you that can't handle ogg... at the moment the mp3s for both of these sets 
are on a 640kbps connection, so it may get bogged down...

I suppose I'll be catching up with some of you next week! ;)

Best,
--Mike

------=_NextPart_000_0035_01C332DB.5D4A8FA0
Content-Type: text/plain;
	charset="us-ascii"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

To all the very talented DJ's and Producers out there in the Bay Area:
 
For those who have read this post and have emailed me, thank you.  We
are within the final steps of releasing the site and making it "live".
EVERYONE who has responded will get an email back, if you haven't heard
from me already.
 
There is going to be a new web site that has never been done before.  It
will cater to the underground electronic DJ scene in the Bay Area, with
styles of music ranging from House, Trance, NRG, Hard Trance, Hard
House, Jungle, DnB, Ambient, Acid Jazz, Turntablism, etc. (I think you
get the point).  Interested?  Keep reading...
 
Does this fit your description?  An electronic DJ or composer that is
too talented for their own good, but doesn't know how to get themselves
known...
 
...This is where we come in.  
 
If you think you got some killer dj mixes or some tracks you put
together yourself, then we are looking (more specifically, listening)
for you.  We're looking for 25-50 talented DJ's and composers to get the
site launched with fresh, off-the-hook slammin' music.  We're looking
for 160kbps - 192kbps mp3's of your mixes or tracks.  If we like what we
hear, then we'll give you a free 6-month membership to our site.  More
details will be explained once we make contact with you.
 
We are just like you - we are doing this for the music, and for the
electronic community.  This site will cater to the electronic DJ's in
every aspect imaginable.
 
If you are interested, please email djunderground@wctech.net with a link
to where we can listen to your music.  Remember, it can be either a
complete mix, or just a track you created.  If you don't have a link to
your music, still send an email.  If you have to send it to us on a CD
in the mail, so be it.  Whatever it takes for us to hear your music.  If
you're dedicated enough, you'll get it to us.
 
*** Due to the mass amounts of email I get in regarding this, I am now
only listening to 192kbps mp3's that I am able to download, or CD's that
are sent in the mail.  I've had a lot of people who have sent me a URL
for streaming mp3's and Real Media, but since I lead a very hectic life,
CD's seem to be my only way of taking your mixes with me.  MP3's are
fine, just as long as they are 192kbps.  If you send me a CD, it makes
things easier when I do pick you if you send me two CD's - one with a
single mp3 track, and an audio CD.  I hate to make things complicated,
but it will save us both time if I can get the mixes and tracks in those
mediums.
 
We are also looking for people to help throughout the site as well.
Currently we are looking for people to write articles within the
underground electronic scene, help keep the site up to date with news,
and help us keep up to date with the events that are going on in the bay
area.  If you would like to help, please email to
djunderground@wctech.net.
 
Did I mention this site will be viewed on a daily basis by record labels
and music producers?
 
More information will follow once we do get in contact with you.  The
site is in its final stages and are currently in testing.  We can't say
much without some sort of confidentiality.  So shoot us an email to
djunderground@wctech.net so we can start talking.
 
If you're serious about DJ'ing or producing, send us an email.  If
you're not, don't bother.

Subject: Help! I'm going to Kinkyfunk alone!

Okay, so I haven't posted to SF Raves in like, two years.
But this is important. :) I have two tickets to see Hybrid tonight at
Kinkyfunk (www.electrocelt.com) but only one warm body (mine). Hybrid, live,
on a boat is just TOO DAMN COOL to do alone, so I want to share my extra
ticket with somebody.
I can give you a ride up and back as long as you're not north of SF, since
I'm going to be coming from Mountain View. Cute girls and Hybrid fans get
top billing. ;)

Subject: trance dj link

this is my fav url to get ideas for dj sets.  i use
the charts to find what is popular in europe but i
also use the vinyl area to see what is new before it
becomes popular.  all the media files are full length.
 it's probably the best site to recon the trance scene
with.

Subject: BSP(i guess?): Wanna check out a song i made?

Hi there.  My name is Mateo, i've been on this list
(mostly lurking - unforgivable i know...) off & on for
the past 5/6 years or so.  Recently a song i made got
pressed up on vinyl (woo hoo for me!), and i would
love to hear some feedback from any of you on it.  Its
kinda downtempo, but clocks in @ 120bpm.  Its got live
Sitar, funk guitar and percussion. Recorded in the
Neve room at Expression, and arranged, mixed and
mastered on my little protools computer at home.  The
link is 
http://www.mp3.com/mateo_jones   
Its called "Calm".  Again, i'd love to hear any
feedback at all on it.  And, i guess if anyone like
it, i've got copies on 12" for sale.  

I also recorded a bunch of hip hop tracks with (DJ)
Kwashi & DSavy, those and some of my mixtapes can be
found here: http://mateojones.djcentral.com 

I'm an audio engineer, graduated head of my class from
expression, and have been the head engineer at a rap
studio for about a year.  I've done studio design,
installation, wiring (custom).  I set up & am teaching
a recording class for the Bayview Safehaven kids
program.  Oh, i do club/live sound too (design, setup,
engineering).  If anyone has any questions, please
feel free to e-mail me.  Hope you enjoy it!

OMG ... I went to see Finding Nemo this weekend ... lOl grOOvy!

Then last night I saw Hollywood Homocide, which was boring the first half 
hour, then built up and got pretty good ... for a hollywood movie.  

So, go see them both, or just wait till they come out on video, it doesn't 
matter.  

Besides, everyone's waiting for T3 to come out, right?  

Eh?

Happy Monday ...

Subject: Production question (Pro-Tools)

Hey Guys,

For you ultra efficient skilled gekky producers on the list I have a 
probably very lame question for ya.

(Long story short)
I have my gear setup and my decks setup and I want to record audio into 
pro-tools but can't seem to figure out how to get it to record "Non-Midi" 
data..

Here is the list of what im working with.

Mac G4
Digi 001 (Pro-tools LE)
Behringer 1604A 8 Channel Euro Mixer

If that description is a bit Vague hit me back and I can explain how all my 
cables are running and how I have it setup. I can hear audio when I play my 
records or when I play a track in pro-tools but can't seem to get the audio 
record to pick up the audio coming from my Decks via the Behringer.


Thanks all you skilled producers on the list ;)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Hybrid boat party! - Who went?

Low turnout, sound problems, cool people, low energy, mostly drinking on the
decks during daylight, dj sets that were just *blah*, hybrid not playing a
dj set worthy of their name/history.

Very unfortunate. That wasn't at all like the RedMelon boat party I went to
with Darren Emerson. That was amazing. This was just like *blah* That's the
best way I can sum it up for you. It was *blah* =(

It was gorgeous sunset. It was a wonderful trip around the bay which was
worthwhile, but the party side of things left me dissapointed.

--=====================_2426690==_.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

We understand that many people have concerns about writing to the DEA.  It 
also seems that your faxes have either overloaded the DEA's fax machines or 
the machines have been turned off because your letters are no longer 
getting through. So, we've decided to shake things up at the source. 
Senator Biden (D-DE) - the man behind the RAVE Act - is a national 
political figure considering running for the Democratic nomination for 
President.  He told critics of the law that he expected it to only be 
applied to "rogue" promoters that sold drugs. He needs to know that 
everything voters like you warned would happen has happened. It took less 
than two months for the law to be used against a political fundraiser and 
we're holding him accountable. As a possible Presidential candidate Biden 
needs to know that voters across the country care about this issue and 
won't stop until he repeals or reforms the RAVE Act. You can fax him a 
letter for free from our website
http://actioncenter.drugpolicy.org/ctt.asp?u=488&l=2269. Copies of the fax 
will also go to the Members of Congress who represent your district.


It only takes one minute to fax Senator Biden:
http://actioncenter.drugpolicy.org/ctt.asp?u=488&l=2269


Also, our new action alert is below. Please forward the alert to your 
friends, family, e-mail lists, etc.


You're making the difference!


==============================
*** Tell Senator Biden, "Repeal the RAVE Act"
*** Send a Free Fax:
      http://actioncenter.drugpolicy.org/ctt.asp?u=488&l=2269


Only two months after the RAVE Act was passed by Congress it has been used 
by the federal Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to intimidate the 
owners of a Billings, Montana, venue into canceling a combined benefit for 
the Montana chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of 
Marijuana Laws (NORML) and Students for Sensible Drug Policy (SSDP).


On the day the fundraiser was set to take place a Billings-based DEA agent 
presented the venue owners with a copy of the RAVE Act warning them that 
they could face a fine of $250,000 if illicit drugs were found in the 
premises. The bands - most of which regularly played at the venue - were 
reportedly also approached and warned that their participation in the event 
could result in a fine.


Rather than risk the possibility of enormous fines, the venue decided to 
cancel the event. This blatant intimidation by the DEA was obviously 
designed to shut down the marijuana reform fundraiser. Unless the American 
people speak out against this attack on free speech, the DEA will be 
emboldened to use the law against other events they do not like, such as 
all-night dance parties, hip hop concerts, hemp festivals, and circuit parties.


Join the Drug Policy Alliance, National Organization for the Reform of 
Marijuana Laws, Students for Sensible Drug Policy, and numerous other 
organizations in our campaign to pressure the sponsor of the law to repeal 
or reform it.


ACTIONS TO TAKE


1) Fax Senator Biden: http://actioncenter.drugpolicy.org/ctt.asp?u=488&l=2269
Urge him to repeal the RAVE Act or amend it to better protect innocent 
business owners, public health, and free speech. Copies of the fax will 
also go to the Members of Congress that represent your district.


2) Forward this alert to friends and family. Send it to e-mail lists and 
post it in chat rooms.

BACKGROUND


Sponsored by Senator Biden (D-DE), the RAVE Act (also known as the Illicit 
Drug Anti-Proliferation Act) was first introduced last year. It proved so 
controversial then that two of its original co-sponsors withdrew their 
support because they feared it would send innocent business owners to jail. 
Business owners collected over 20,000 signatures in opposition to the 
bill.   Protests against it were held around the country and tens of 
thousands of voters urged their elected official to oppose it. Controversy 
over the bill stalled it last year, but Senator Biden attached it to the 
popular "Amber Alert" bill without public debate or a vote of Congress 
earlier this year and snuck it into law.


The RAVE Act expands federal law to make it easier to jail and imprison 
event organizers and property owners that fail to stop drug offenses from 
occurring on their property - even in cases when they take serious steps to 
reduce drug offenses. It applies to "any place", including bars and 
nightclubs, hotels, apartment buildings, and homes. Legal experts warned 
that the law was so broad that it could be used to shut down not only raves 
and electronic music events, but also Hip Hop, rock, and country music 
concerts, sporting events, gay and lesbian fundraisers, political protests, 
and any other event federal agents do not like.

On May 30th an agent of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) told 
managers of the Eagle Lodge in Billings, Montana that the Lodge could be 
fined $250,000 if anyone smoked marijuana during a planned benefit to raise 
money for a campaign to change Montana's medical marijuana law. After 
consulting their attorneys, the Eagle Lodge canceled the event.

protest and revolt, and it is stultifying to celebrate the rebels of the 
past while we silence the rebels of the present."
-Henry Steele Commager

Subject: re: parties from july 11-23? (I don't see any techno on the Atlantis lineup)

All those names and not a single techno DJ.  Not even a local one.  The bay
area loves its techno.  Seriously, these guys are all touring the west coast
around that time.

CARI LEKEBUSH - July 25th,26th,27th
BILLY NASTY - July 20th till July 26th
DANILO VIGORITO - August 14th till August 27th
JUSTIN ROBERTSON - August 31st till September 13th
GEATANO PARSIO - September 10th till September 21

Yeah, none of them fall in the 19th, but dude, I'm sure Charly Fusion is
still around isn't he?  His tape with Mark Johns was purty decent.

love always

Funny you mention that cause Charlie happens to be a friend of mine and yes 
he is still around. Believe it or not he is a Mail man.. That was kind of 
funny to see him delivering some mail one day. But he is more focused on 
Dance hall and just working last time I spoke with him.

But yes a good tecno DJ that knows his shit!!

called 2XL. I dont know how much that will help they never used to put the

Alright Party Kidz! Tha time is near and tha party is almost here!  
We've been workin hard to bring you guys a great party with heart N  
some thick a$$ vibes- that ya could cut with a spoon
SO.. With that in mind .. we've made a few changes and added some  
surprises to give this party even more ol' skool flava with a lil taste  
of some fresh new blood!
First though-There's been a few rumors commin through the grape vine  
that this event will be at the "crackhouse" venue in Oakland... THIS IS  
NOT TRUE!! A Summer Dream will be at a 100% Secure- Air Conditioned-  
VIRGIN Location .. that will also feature an outdoor smokin area   
However... the rumor that IS Mos Definatly true.. we'e added a second  
room to tha party to give you kidz even more for your buck! Line up  
TBA!!  Now this is gunna be totally chill status-with two liscensed  
message therapists, to take care of all your aches N pains from tearin  
up tha dance floor!
Your also gunna wana arrive early as we're gunna have free glowsticks  
for the first 100 (0r so ) kidz .. if ya don't though .. I hear ya  
might be able to still find some free CD's and goodies inside too! Now  
if those aren't reason enough... then take a look at what else we have  
in store~
California Dreamz is proud to announce that we will be accepting  
donations for our "raver scholorship" program at our upcomming event.  
In short-this is how it works- we're gunna be asking you all to donate  
whatever you can--if you can-- to put towards a scholorship that will  
be given away at our next event! This will be given to someone based  
on: GPA, application, interview,financial need- and will require that  
the individual is a high school senior, or college freshman, that we  
feel, is bound to someday make a positive difference & contribute to  
society. FYI: The check will be made out to tha school of their  
choosing-sorry guyz-no free lunch!  And u gotta attend our event to  
apply... so - For more information please contact us!
*This is only tha beginning and a hint of whats up our sleeves! So come  
take a glimpse into tha future.. June 27th @ A Summer Dream!

Subject: Another day, another song ID

Hey Bay Area :)

So I haven't written much of anything lately - been far too unmotivated 
to do much more than punch in at work...

Last week I got motivated and went up to Liquid, and the DJ played a 
really supa-supa-funky house track (I mean FUN-KAY) with a lot of mean 
bass.. I asked him what it was and he said "All I know is it says 
'Nebraska' on it - I picked it up at BPM."  So I'm assuming this is 
some sort of white label, but my searches have yielded nothing.

Anyone have any clue what this might be? I'm dyin' here...

Fanx...

Funky how? There was a really free-form jazzy/disco record out a couple

What can we say...we have our own style and it's worked for our fans before...you might not particularly like the lineup, but there are people who are really looking forward to this...it will also be our first TWO room event in almost two years...it will be a blast...promise.
 
You may now continue with your bitter sarcasm boys and girls...we love you for it ;)

Subject: Bodhi is now teknobuddha

 After signing up with Juno, I found out I had two accounts, so I decided
to stick with teknobuddha. So far kinda so good, getting signed up and
downloading their softwere was a pain in the ass, and i'm still waiting
for the disc to get internet connection, but for $10 a month vs $28 for
AOL, I think it's worth all the trouble. If this turns out to be a good
alternative ISP to the high priced ones like AOL and people are looking
for a good cheep one, I'll let you know if this one rocks or suxs.
 Peace, Bodhi ^ _ ^

Subject: Re: [sfraves] ~*PULSE*~ FRIDAY.AUGUST.8th.2003 (*TWO ROOMS* w/13
 DJs)(XTORT)*BSP*

over the years I have commented on this very same point.. And each time the 
Xtort guys nicely explain how and why they do what they do. It obviously 
works and works well for them.. On a small time party scale. At least for me 
personally it burns the shit out of me and gets me frustrated that people 
can be so dumb and fall for the easy cheese lineup/parties and you got 
promoters/DJ's/Producers that go out of there way to bring something 
different and unique to the scene and just have it looked over. That is why 
personally.. Im not doing parties anymore.. Well maybe a few more small club 
things for some friends etc.. ;)  But in terms of full on flyers and putting 
up my 5-10k cash fuck that shit.. It ain't worth it to me.. For a bunch of 
pubscent teens that want to hear the cheese.. And of course people like 
myself and others can take the easy way out and throw cheese parties.. Hell 
I think if I wanted to.. I could be on the level of some of the Mid size 
promoters (With a few parties) and book the mega events I have enough of my 
OWN capital and contacts/connections to do it. But I choose not to.. I would 
rather focus on other things.

I think that is what may burn people up.. Cause you can be a dipshit and 
still come up in the scene like a skills or F-8 you just have to "Market 
your events" accordingly.. doesn't take a genius to do it just a big helping 
of cheese.. mmmmm gouda

thanks for listening to my rant  :)

the solsticehealing one will be the SHIT.

if i know what i think i know, the location is absolutely
beautiful and is one of my favorites, second only to the
moontribe 10-year location (this past weekend).

a good portion of the ambient mafia will be representing, both
on-deck and off-deck for this gathering.  we'll also have some
t-shirts for sale/trade, so hit me up if you see me.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] solstice again..cause I'm dumb ;)

 I will be there for sure! 30+ fucking DJs? 3 days in
the wilderness? 2 stages! non stop party, food, drink,
the best of venues, the best of talent, a venue that
can't be beat, and energy that can't be matched many
where else in the scene. Fuck yes. What better way to
spend the solstice than with mother nature and a ton
of fabulous people.  Me and redstick man chilled at
the same location in the Chai Dome at the top of a
hill till late sunday morning, drinking chai and
sharing bitchen good vibes in the wilderness with a
few dozen other people. Definately one of my favorite
SF party memories.

 I'll be there from beginning till end, dancing
*SOBER* for 3 days (who needs booze or drugs with that
bitchen atmosphere?) . I'm also bringing out my own
dome. So besides the vegitarian friendly food, massage
tent, water, boom boom, breaks, energy and on and on,
there will be 2 domes for your chilling pleasure. 

 SEE YOU THE FUCK THERE!

Subject: [NRR] ::FUNNIE::  Change the Atmosphere Of Your Bedroom

--part1_3d.31202e08.2c203ad6_boundary
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

It's especially good for couples that have been together for a long time to 
create a new atmosphere in an all too familiar bedroom, but you don't have to 
be in a long term relationship to try some of these suggestions. Variety is the 
spice of life. Altered surroundings can turn a routine sex session into a 
night of passion you will remember for the rest of your life. 


Add Some Strange Music

Playing music that you normally wouldn't can profoundly change the feel of a 
room and the sex you have in it. Reggae and jazz are favorites in the bedroom 
for the sense of rhythm they help provide, as well as a lot of dance music 
played in singles bars. 


The Nose Knows

Our sense of smell is one of the most powerful memory queues we have. Scented 
candles and incense are very good for changing the atmosphere of a room. If 
your bedroom smells different your brain will unconsciously think it's a 
different place. Don't just buy one flavor or scent, buy dozens. A wide range of 
scents is much better. 

There is another huge bonus to using a variety of scents over a long period 
of time- even without consciously trying, your mind can associate a particular 
sex session with a unique smell (as long as the smell is unique enough). In 
the distant future it will be easier to reenact a particularly passionate night 
if you burn the same incense fragrance. 

Sometimes a memory association will happen by accident. It's a very cool 
experience to be out shopping and smell a candle and have it remind you of an 
intense orgasm or a particularly kinky sex act. 


New Sheets

New sheets always beg to be broken in. They don't have to be satin or silk, 
but it helps. 


A Black Light

Florescent body paint is really cool with one of these. 


A Disco Ball

Small ones can be purchased at a novelty store. Nothing changes a room quite 
like spots of different colored light all over the ceiling and walls. A 
cheaper substitute is a novelty lampshade. If you can't find a store for those 
they're very easy to make yourself. Any craft shop will help you out. 


Mirrors

It isn't hard or expensive to fix a few panels to the ceiling and it makes a 
very tantalizing addition to the bedroom. They don't have to stay there 
forever and it doesn't have to be a perfect job. Just make sure you have them out 
before you host a Christmas party or find a way to keep your bedroom private. 


Go With A Theme

Ever fantasize about fucking in a jungle? You can have the next best thing 
and not have to worry about twigs and creepy crawly things. Buy a cd with sounds 
of the jungle and move all the plants in your house to the bedroom. 

Want to fuck on a beach without getting sand in your ass? Try playing an 
ocean sounds cd and massage one another with sun tan oil. 


Flood Lights

Many people already own colored floodlights for decorating the outside of 
their house at Christmas. You don't have to wait for December to put them to good 
use. Indoors they make everything in a room their particular color, even your 
partner. Science fiction fans really appreciate fucking under a green light. 
Just make sure you have some good blinds for your windows, you'll be sending a 
colorful beacon out to the entire neighborhood that might be embarrassing to 
explain.

New Law Covers Political Intimidation
by Daniel Forbes

Drug reformers and concert promoters united a year ago to block passage of
Democratic Senator Joe Biden's Rave Act, which would have subjected
promoters and club owners to prohibitive fines for any but the most
incidental drug use at their events. This year, though, Biden--who said the
law was needed to deter drug use and "protect kids"--attached it to the
anti-child abduction AMBER Alert bill, which passed in April.

It took about a month for reformers' fears to be realized. Emphasizing the
possible $250,000 fine, a DEA agent brandished a copy of the law at a
fraternal lodge in Billings, Montana, that was about to host a benefit
concert to raise money to help qualify a medical-marijuana measure for the
state ballot next year, and the event was immediately canceled.

Denver-based Special Agent in Charge Jeff Sweetin, who runs the DEA's Rocky
Mountain Division, said the lodge trustees may not have known what they
were in for because typically such events feature "open air" drug use. It's
the DEA's duty to inform them, he said, so they can beef up security. "The
emphasis was, there were a lot of people coming, and they need to be
prepared," said Sweetin.

Kelly (who declined to give her last name) was the manager on duty at the
Fraternal Order of Eagles Lodge when agent Dan Dunlap showed up on May 30,
several hours before the $5 event, proceeds from which were to go to local
chapters of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws and
Students for a Sensible Drug Policy as well as the medical-marijuana ballot
fight. Kelly said Dunlap made no overt threats but showed her a copy of the
new Illicit Drug Anti-Proliferation Act and informed her that should any
drugs be found on the premises, the lodge might be subject to the $250,000
penalty. He didn't tell the lodge to cancel the event, but just indicated,
Kelly said, "what could happen." Dunlap also told her that undercover DEA
agents or some in "squad cars" might attend. She called her boss.

Lodge chairman Roger Diehl confirmed his meeting with Dunlap, but declined
comment beyond saying it was his decision to cancel the event.

Sweetin acknowledged that Dunlap mentioned the quarter-million-dollar fine
as "one possible ramification of the law." He said, "If they chose to have
the concert, we told them what could happen." Asked about the fine, Sweetin
said, "There is a liability attached if you don't control your patrons."
Sweetin maintained that the DEA is duty-bound to inform the public about
the new law while noting, "It's pretty broad. It's a very aggressive
approach to drug users and people who profit from drug use at events." He
added that the DEA is still seeking guidance from the Department of
Justice. "We don't know how it's going to shake out."

Had the lodge lacked proper security, said Sweetin, "It can turn into
Ecstasy use and marijuana use, and people could have gotten hurt." His
worst fear, he said, is having "to talk to the mother of some girl who was
doped or raped or killed." He added that the DEA actions are likely to be
presented as "the bad narcs trying to stop a fundraiser, but no, that's not
the case."

Scott Proctor, the interim coordinator for the Montana State Green Party,
says that while there might have been some potheads skulking around the
parking lot if the concert had taken place, there would not have been any
open pot smoking. "You'd get nailed for that in Billings. It's a very
conservative town," he said.

Rather than curtailing political speech, Biden staffer Chip Unruh said, the
law "targets people who knowingly and intentionally promote an event for
the purpose of drug use, sales or manufacturing. The law is very clear and
there's a high burden of proof." Paradoxically, Unruh said, "I can't think
of too many instances where someone knowingly promoted an event for the
purpose of drug use. That would be stupid--just another form of dealing drugs."

Bill Piper, associate director of national affairs at the Drug Policy
Alliance, said the incident--not to mention Unruh's statement--proves
opponents' contention that the law would be used as a form of intimidation.
Existing laws, he contended, adequately cover drug dealing by concert
promoters.

Had the concert come off, organizer Adam Jones, a 21-year-old Montana State
student and founder of the local NORML and SSDP chapters, would have
skipped it despite his months of preparation. He was locked up for three
days for failing to inform his probation officer that he'd switched from
his winter to his summer YMCA job, and for a urinalysis described by Pam
Bunke, regional administrator for Montana's Department of Corrections, as
"borderline hot" for marijuana. Having not checked with Jones's job since
January, probation officer Barry Ivanoff did so the day before the concert.
Asked whether this was coincidental, Bunke said, "Coincidence--sure." Bunke
said that Jones came to the authorities' attention for his April 2001
felony possession of 3.7 grams of psychoactive mushrooms. Then a May 2002
search of his home turned up a baggie with some mushroom residue and, said
Bunke, a "bottle of liquid spores"

Bunke said the state crime lab would do a more extensive analysis of
Jones's urine, and should it determine Jones had used marijuana, Jones's
probation could conceivably be revoked, and he could do up to two years in
prison, though a lesser penalty is likely.

The Green Party's Proctor declared Jones a great organizer who has "done
more at age 21 than a lot of people do their whole lives." But more
politics will have to wait. With his probation officer riding herd--and
facing that urinalysis result--Jones said he's resigned his posts because
"There's a real conflict of interest for me to be involved with reform
organizations right now." This despite what he views as "a scary and
complete infringement of my First Amendment rights."

Now, I'm not going to go out of my way to defend anyone. Especially the
kinds of krewes that throw 20, 30 dollar parties.

But why is everyone so afraid of a little cheese?

I'll be the first to admit -- my loves at intelligent d&b and nice, hard,
banging techno. I've never been immensely into the foofoo trance, nor do I
enjoy most house for a party atmosphere. To give you some idea, the
majority of 'lounge house', to me, belongs in a chill room or somethin --
everybody on the dance floor should be jumping up and down and howling
like wild monkeys if they aren't dancing. If they can't dance, they should
just do what I do gnaw on a wild dog for a few hours before a party, and
flail about in a rabid haze.

But you know what? I went to a foofoo cheese trance party the other day.
I distinctly remember a number of washing audial breakdowns. Cheesy
synths. THe occasional boppy, poppy beat. And you know what?

It was actually kinda nice.

No wangsters doing the ah so fresh to deep house. Very few people just
chilling in a back room all night. Those kids danced, and they danced
until about 4 in the morning. If the music hadn't gotten weak, they
probably would have kept dancing.

Sure, the music got cheesy. Yes, I distinctly remember a couple of big
name local trance DJs grinning like fools and totally playing the crowd's
loveyfluffiness and silly optimism.

But don't you guys remember partying 5 years ago, and being the
optimistic, lovey fluffy (albeit occasionally -- benefit of the doubt,
here; occasionally -- etarded) kiddies? Who weren't ashamed of enjoying a
little cheese?

This isn't directed at you, specifically, Macadio -- it's an overall
attitude i've noticed. A certain level of cynicism that underlies a large
portion of the local community, be it at a more subtle level in some than
others. Yeah, sure, it isn't '95 any more. But isn't it being '03 good
enough?

Hey now! Aren't you just supposed to book the same dj's at every single
event? I mean like that really helps the scene go further...
Who wants to take a walk on the wild side and bring out new talent? I mean
shit who would actually care to hear some of the
people who PRODUCE the tracks? </sarcasm>

Subject: RE: [sfraves] ~*PULSE*~ FRIDAY.AUGUST.8th.2003 (*TWO ROOMS* w/13 DJs)(XTORT)*BSP*



Being able to throw a successful string of events on a monthly (or now,
bimonthly) basis for 4 years solid is not an accomplishment that many
small-level, electronic-based event organizers can claim - Xtort can.
The guy must be doing something right and I think he deserves a bit of
respect for what he's done.  Same DJs at every event?  C'mon now, that
doesn't quite work.  Yes, I'll agree that has resorted to a rather
predictable method of putting certain DJs on rotation and trying to
bring in at least one or two new names on the lineup every other event
or so, but hey it works for him and for the people who choose to go to
his shows on a regular basis.  In a day where events are typically $20,
he keeps his tickets close to the $10 mark, desite the annual increase
in overhead - the guy is definitely not in this thing to make the bank.
Throughout the past 4 years, not a single one of his events has ever
been shutdown by the authorities.  As for his musical tastes - the guy
likes trance of all sorts and he tosses in some techno and dnb when it
fits - but to sum up his events as simply cheesefests for "kids" - well
that's a bit of a flawed generalization.  As for who he books - he books
the people that can pull in a crowd.  Remember, this is Sacramento not
San Francisco and experimentation doesn't go so well up here (a sad, but
true phenomenon I've witnessed throughout the years).  His shows are
small and his tickets prices are low = so maybe he doesn't feel in a
position to experiment with DJs that no-one has heard of.  

On a personal note: if the guy was a chode, then there's no way he would
be getting as much support from me for as long as he has.  I've been
invited to play at every single Xtort event since 1999 and have chosen
to play at all with the exception of one.  This support comes from a
well-respected, non-cheese-slinging, 30-something year old DJ who has
played for a most diverse and respected list of event organizers from
all over: from the deep-level underground, to clubs to massives to
events attented to by predominately younger individuals to parties who's
age median is within my own age group.  What is it that some of you see
that I'm missing?  How am I able to maintain a generally non-jaded,
open-minded attitude whilst the world around me melts into a sea of
jaded bitterness?  Perhaps I see each event for what it is and my being
involved in such a diverse pool of organizations has helped me keep a
positive outlook on things.  All I know is that I actually have fun at
Xtort events and this party on Aug. 8th is no exception.  They won't be
around forever, none of this will, so I say enjoy what you can while
it's still there to enjoy and if you can't, then damn, I'm sorry.

Well that's enough ranting from me... Holy smokes!

Subject: CRACK HOUSE LAW BUSY @ WORK: shutting down "unapproved" parties

  I heard of this incident the other day in Montana. But watch out dogs,
this is just cracking! Wait until it really gets bouncing, especially
watch for election year. If theres any other excellent reason to get Bush
out of office, after lying about the WMDs, this should be it. 
 True, a Democrat sponsored the bill, and we need to put our collective
progressive pressure on the (sell out ,"me too!") Democratic party
concerning the drug issue if it wants our vote. But Bush & (neo
conservative aka fascists/US version of religious fundelmentalism)
company will take it to much higher heights of repression. Crack house
law (Democrat), meet Patriot act II (Republican)!!!
  How anyone can be a Bush supporter and claim to be a raver is very s&m
to me!
 Peace, Bodhi ^ _ ^

Sometimes truth is loud, and the other times it is very silent, but no
matter what the truth brings, it is always accompanied by a quiet pain.

This Tresor?

http://www.tresorberlin.de/

Just curious... that label is THE mainland european techno label... so i'm
confused by the trance thing (and my german sucks so I'm having trouble
figuring out if it's what you're talking about or not).

colors are cool things to introduce to people...colors and textures...i want to say more things, but i am being conservative on purpose. i don't like being conservative, but also, heck, why not just be totally conservative sometimes? you know what i mean...think about some colors and then wonder about stuff like does anyone actually drive while they are awake? and do i really want to drive with all of those sleeping people? there's always colors though. you can see those in your sleep too though, contrary to popular rumors. rumors are another distraction and habit of mind, similar to random munching and stuff like that. i couldn't think of a single cool song to post about, so you got this. i am sorry for feeling pleasure at being understood sometimes, because sometimes, i just don't like how i managed to get my point across, because my imagination leads me to believe that the one on the recieving end got hurt or something like that, but then this morning, while listening to the most
 beautiful bird singing with some other cool singing birds, but this one just keeps standing out, i thought about how the one who i thought got hurt really probably got off and wouldn't want me to worry anyway, but also, probably gets off on the general feelings that are aroused and stirred about so the worry is probably the cherry on top, so, yeah, no music for you today. :)

I was there in 2001 and 2002.  I went to a club called
www.lovesterngalaktika.de .  they had about 11 different DJ areas and
about 15,000 people inside.  It was amazing and any club you go to after
that pales by comparison.

ps. not every huge commercial gets rumors spread about them, just the ones

The following is a transcript from orin hatch about his desire to let
record companies nuke and destroy people's computers for copyright
infringement.  If this guy isn't bought and paid for by the RIAA, I
don't know who is.
 
"I'm interested," Hatch interrupted. He said damaging someone's computer
"may be the only way you can teach somebody about copyrights." 
The senator acknowledged Congress would have to enact an exemption for
copyright owners from liability for damaging computers. He endorsed
technology that would twice warn a computer user about illegal online
behavior, "then destroy their computer." 
"If we can find some way to do this without destroying their machines,
we'd be interested in hearing about that," Hatch said. "If that's the
only way, then I'm all for destroying their machines. If you have a few
hundred thousand of those, I think people would realize" the seriousness
of their actions, he said. 
"There's no excuse for anyone violating copyright laws," Hatch said.

 Well... he's kind of right in a way, I mean, right now the US thinks it
rules the world or is trying to rule the world. Walmart, Mc Donalds,
Starbucks, Coors beer and Chevys are all over Canada, so Canada might as
well be part of the US.

If America is such a bad place, how come everyone wants to live here?
go to anywhere on any continent and on a table, place keys to a brand
new Mercedes, a hundred dollar bill, a steak and lobster dinner, and a
green card (all free for the taking) and see which one disappears first.

You seem to be saying that the kinds of products we buy and services we
use is the predominant factor in defining who we are. Do you think that's
true?

Mystic,

not that i am confirming or denying what the rumour is (because for one; i
dont know... and for two; i dont care).... but how does that link you
provided prove anything? the original email inquiring about this rumour
stated that they had lost their original venue, which was the Richmond Civic
Center.... so let me ask again, how does that link prove otherwise?

Some people do.  Take a look at Alissa Quart's "Branded: The Buying and=20
Selling of Teenagers" (Perseus, 2003).  Or...

One Mom's Struggle with Brand Mania

By Nandini Pandya, AlterNet
June 17, 2003

When she was 10 years old, my daughter wanted to buy underwear at Limited=20
Too. I just did not get it. "Why does the brand of your underwear matter?"=
=20
I asked her.

"Because," she said, as if explaining the most obvious fact to a child, "my=
=20
friends can see the name on the band and know that even my underwear is=20
from Limited Too."

I still did not get it. "Why would the top of your underwear show?"

"Mommy, when I sit down, my jeans get pulled down slightly and it shows.=20
Or, when I raise up my arms, my shirt gets pulled up and it can show then=20
too." Of course, this opened another can of worms in my mind. Why is my=20
10-year-old daughter wearing clothes that just barely cover her body? But=20
that, as they say, is another story.

It is now four years later and I think I have learned the motivations=20
behind this brand-name mania. More important, I have learned things about=20
myself and I have learned how to teach her some of the values that I hold=20
dear.

To a teenage girl of today, using brand-name merchandise is like carrying=20
important universally recognized credentials. It tells the world that she=20
can afford this stuff, that she uses only the "best" and that she is way=20
above using ordinary discount store merchandise. (Brand awareness is so=20
pervasive that even teachers are not immune =96 a science problem was worded=
=20
this way: A poor person must decide whether to buy store brand cereal or=20
brand name cereal.)

As a caring, understanding parent I try to provide her with things that are=
=20
considered standard issue. So, her backpack is from L.L. Bean ($55) instead=
=20
of one from Bradlees ($20); her bathing suit is Speedo ($30) instead of one=
=20
from Kmart ($15). Clothes are bought at one of these stores: American=20
Eagle, Abercrombie and Fitch, Gap, Old Navy. If they are bought at stores=20
like JCPenney or Sears, they are not the store brand like Arizona or Canyon=
=20
River Blues =96 they must be L.E.I or Calvin Klein or a comparable=
 well-known=20
label. Shoes must be Nike, Adidas etc. ($50) as opposed to those from=20
Payless ($15). (During the "Back To School" purchasing spree last=20
September, Payless was empty and the store selling brand-name shoes was=20
packed!)

The peer pressure is brutal and relentless. On one occasion, she noted that=
=20
two of her friends were wearing what looked like identical pants.=20
Immediately, one of them said, "but mine are Ralph Lauren." This happened=20
with a group of girls who are her "best friends" or even "BFFs =96 Best=20
Friends Forever. Clearly, when it comes to brand names all other loyalties=
=20
are forgotten. I shudder to think how much worse it gets when she is not=20
with her BFFs. Another time, she admired her friend's pea coat and=20
mentioned that she might buy one at Costco. The comeback? "I doubt it is a=
=20
real pea coat. Mine cost $300!"

Purchasing decisions are governed by how the item will "play" among her=20
friends. She knows that she will be asked, "Where did you buy it?" She has=
=20
paid what I consider exorbitant prices for otherwise ordinary T-shirts just=
=20
because they have a Reebok logo, or a "cute" quip such as "Girls Rule" or=20
"Princess." She bought a metal lunchbox with a 60s-style design for $15 and=
=20
raved to me about how many compliments she gets because of it. The problem=
=20
is that she hardly ever took lunch from home before getting the lunch box=20
and, after buying the lunch box she took lunch from home for only as long=20
as the lunch box was a novelty.

What happens to a child who does not have the requisite brand-name=20
merchandise? Well she is considered a reject, not quite "A List" material.=
=20
Not that the child is aware of all this in any explicit way. All she knows=
=20
is that she "needs" these labels to be taken seriously by her peers. A low=
=20
point was when my daughter was reluctant to go to K-Mart because someone=20
from school might be there. My point that she would not be harmed by being=
=20
seen by someone from school because that someone from school would also=20
have to be shopping at K-Mart was lost on her.

Strategies for Sanity

As a caring, understanding parent I worry about what this slavish devotion=
=20
to brand names does to my pocket book and to her morality. After almost=20
four years of this type of brand-name awareness in our home, I have=20
developed some strategies.

First, she gets a monthly allowance of $20. She must pay for all her=20
discretionary purchases out of this money. That includes paying for=20
lip-gloss, hair accessories and even candy/soda at the movies. This has=20
given birth to an interesting phenomenon. When she wants some knick-knack,=
=20
she tries to convince me to buy it for her. It's like thinking "better if I=
=20
can get it with mom's money than with mine!" After a few false starts, I=20
have learned to be steadfast in my refusal. Then she thinks really hard=20
about getting it. She still buys items that I consider frivolous or=20
extravagant. But now there is an automatic cap on these indulgences and=20
without much aggravation for me.

Second, she gets a mutually agreed-upon budget for clothes at the beginning=
=20
of the school year and she must choose her mix of brand-name/discount brand=
=20
purchases to fit this budget. (We have not been very successful at this=20
because she has "needed" additional clothes throughout the year =96 either=
=20
because they "fell apart," got stains from spills, or she outgrew them.)

Third, I have tried to teach her to ask herself three questions before=20
making a purchase: 1) Do I need it? 2) Can I afford it? 3) Is it worth the=
=20
money?

I cannot say that this last has met with a great deal of success. But, I am=
=20
hopeful that over time it will teach her valuable skills about managing her=
=20
wants and needs.

Finally, I have taught her to keep her guard up even with BFFs when it=20
comes to brand-name mania. It is OK to tell white lies - "I bought it at=20
Bobs" (Bob's is one of the "in" stores); "I don't remember how much I=20
paid"; "It was a gift from an aunt." And, if she feels particularly brave,=
=20
laugh it off and say, "What is it with you and brand names? Jeez! Can we=20
talk about something else?!"

Spending Style

Growing up in Bombay in the 60s and 70s "spending style" was not an issue.=
=20
Kids wore what the parents bought them, took out the hem when pants/skirts=
=20
became too short, sewed on buttons when they fell off, and thought nothing=
=20
of using hand-me-downs. This was because of necessity, of course. But it=20
was also because the culture was one of minimalism =96 why get more when one=
=20
can make do with less?

Also, the pervasive presence of multitudes of people managing with much=20
less and doing it with grace was enough to put an end to any ideas of false=
=20
grandeur and pretense. Another important factor was an understanding of=20
delayed gratification. I knew that I should-would-could allow myself all=20
the indulgences that I might desire when I came into my own =96 after=
 getting=20
a good education, a good job and becoming both financially and emotionally=
=20
autonomous. In fact, to this end, it was very important to do well at=20
school and the good grades that I achieved were my brand!

When I explain all this to my daughter (where I am coming from, so to=20
speak), she tries to understand. And I think she does, in her own way. It=20
took quite a bit of explaining to convince her that my family in India was=
=20
not poor or struggling or cheap. It has taken a lot more explaining to=20
convince her of the need to put in the effort needed to produce brand-name=
=20
quality =96 whether it is doing schoolwork, doing household chores or=
 keeping=20
her room clean.

Yesterday she said to me "If I were you, I would use a Gucci leather purse=
=20
and not this thing that you bought at Sears." I told her that if I had $50=
=20
to buy a purse, I would spend half of that on a purse, save a fourth and=20
give a fourth to charity. She just rolled her eyes.

Nandini Pandya is the publisher of DesiJournal.com, a website about life in=
=20
the Indian Diaspora. She lives in Connecticut with her husband and their=20
two children.

Dood! You're a fucking idiot! Do you really think that classifies Canada as
being part of the US? We have German cars, drink German beer, and learn to
speak German in our AMERICAN schools; does that mean that we "might as well
be part of" Germany?

sadly, this is a concept car from the 99 auto show.  
if it ain't out in 2003, chances are it won't ever come out.

not everyone gets to be in charge. being in charge is a big job. i don't want to be in charge of anyone else, not because i am lazy, but because i am not into that kind of job. regardless of your position, you have to sort of just do what you have to do to get around people who want to be in charge who also think that being in charge means that you know how they feel at every single moment and exactly what words they need in the second, what smells, what foods and everything else they personally require. not everyone in charge is like that, but lots of times, people are after that sort of thing and they think that putting that sort of thing out there will make them feel more powerful or something like that, but really, all they get is madder than they were when you didn't guess their instantaneous needs right the first time. president bush isn't like that, thank god. :)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] ATLANTIS? Rumors - Cancelation - Can Someone Step Up To The Plate?!?

oh, I wasnt tring to prove anything.. he just asked "is this going to be at
the same place as skills. someone told me the flyer says richmond or san
pablo?"

the link just answered his question....

I also thought it was strange for him to claim to know someone who is
promoting for them and then ask a question that could be answered by looking
at the sf-raves calendar

Peace,
Mystic

Subject: help elect a President who is against the Drug War


I'm going to apologize in advance for what might
be considered political spam, but I really think
it's important that the rave communities around
the US become aware of Dennis Kucinich.  Kucinich
is the only major party political candidate for
President who has taken a firm stand against the
War on Drugs.

If the rave communities want a President who will
scale back the War on Drugs, then it is critical
that Dennis Kucinich get the Democratic Party's
nomination for the Presidency in 2004.  One thing
that will help Kucinich achieve this is the support
of an organization called Move On, which will give
a lot of money and exposure to the candidate that
Move On members like the most.

Move On members will be voting on candidates next
week.  I urge you to sign up as a Move On member
(which is free) today, so that you can vote in
Move On's election next week.  You can do this by
going to this URL: http://www.moveon.org/pac/reg/

Here is Kucinich's stand on the War on Drugs:

"A safe, free and just America is undermined, not
bolstered, by the costly and ineffective War on
Drugs.  While well-intentioned, this misguided
policy -- which emphasizes criminalization over
treatment -- has led to increased violent crime,
misdirected resources of law enforcement and
restricted Constitutional liberties.  Despite
billions spent yearly on the drug war, addiction
is up.  Our country must rethink a policy that
produces many casualties, but benefits only the
prison-industrial complex.  Non-violent drug
offenders often receive Draconian sentences,
tearing apart families."

The rest of Kucinich's platform can be summed up
with these 10 key points:

- Universal Health Care with a Single Payer Plan
- Full Social Security Benefits at Age 65
- Withdrawal from NAFTA and WTO
- Repeal of the "Patriot Act"
- Right-to-Choose, Privacy, and Civil Rights
- Balance Between Workers and Corporations
- A Renewed Commitment to Peace and Diplomacy
- Restored Rural Communities and Family Farms
- Environmental Renewal and Clean Energy

These points are talked about in more detail at
this URL:

And *then* they built a concept car called the "Studio E". Honda appears
to have some sort of bizarre DJ/"club culture" fetish:

Geez...
I am not going to re post the whole branding thing cuz it was long, but my response:
WTF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I mean, I love fashion, probably more than most people, but GOD!
My pea Coat from sal. army in brighton mi:$2
MY powerpuff girls tank top: $3.99 big lots
MY KIKwear:$5 at marshals clearance
MY ANT Industrial Design backpack:$10 at sample sale
MY "I'm friendly" shirt: $ 6 at anchor blue clearance
If my kid wanted a $50 backpack it better last them for 10 years, be really, really cool and like handmade by some local designer or FORGET IT!
That girl should get a JOB!
Or better yet LEARN TO SEW.
This branding crap didn't make sence to me in high school and it makes LESS SENCE TO ME NOW. I shopped at DEB and RAVE and "Sally Ann's" and Yard sales and vintage stores and big lots. Now vintage stores have gotten overpriced... dont get me started on that one! Plus I made my own clothes. I haven't been able to do that for a couple years because of a bad shoulder injury.
Anyway, I am really sick. who gave me MONO at QS?

Subject: Re: Who's the parent here?/ solstice again..cause I'm dumb ;)

I'm sorry but that branding article by that lady rubbed me the wrong way. I 
dunno, there was something about her and her daugther that just didn't sit 
well with me.  If you ask me, I think her daughter is just a spoilt little 
brat who gets to have her way.  Someone needs to put there foot down and 
start being a parent.

uhh i actually dont know where the sfraves calendar is and i dont have any ill will intentions as some of you emailed me personally.
 
geez, i thought this list was to be able to ask questions regarding parties and events. 
 
the person i said was my friend is actually more like an associate and i dont hang out with him and we dont talk eveyday.
 
i go to school with his brother and he always tells us whats going on. but he sometimes likes to stratch the truth. so i thought i would ask this list in hopes of getting a good answer.
 
with that i called the venue myself and asked them if i could vend at the party cause i wanted to sell hand blown glass and they tell me there is no party scheduled for july 19th at the richmond civic.
 
so instead of sending me angry player hating emails, why dont you get your facts straight and stop hating on me for trying to get some information from this list.
 
i guess this was the wrong place to ask questions. and sorry i'm not a super raver and dont know where to get info like all you major party heads who are "in the know"
 
what a joke.

at the sf-raves calendar

You have no idea how right you are.....

Sorry about jumping to conclusions.. next time I'll be more careful... It's
just really lame when people try to spread false rumors about big parites..
and also, yeah, I have WAY too much free time.

it would be a good carnival ride...or a simulated dj
car in imagination land in some kids theme park...but
there would be much fighting over who gets to be the
dj...

i mean sure it looks like a dj set up but damn dont
you just want the real thing? Have the passenger spin
some shit while you drive. now there's a concept;)

I hear ya girl.

It's like I always used to say:  I did the bulk of my shopping at Hot Topic. 
But I did most of my BUYING on ebay, from people who shopLIFTED at Hot Topic.

I got most of my "raver clothes" online from ebay, usually complete with tags
and everything!  And I get most of my "normal clothes" from the good old
standby: Ross.  

I mean:  I understand wanting to look nice and all.  And I do keep an eye out
for good looking clothes.  But I favor the right style FAR more than the
"right" designer.  And I've never gotten the whole "in season" thing.  I mean.
god forbid that the khackis that I wear to work, or the cargo pants in which
I'm going to sit on a nasty-ass floor at a rave, are *last* season's style.

I gotta disagree on the backpack tho.  As many el-cheapo
self-destruct-o-backpacks as I went through in elementary and middle school
before I convinced my mom to let me spend my own money on my first Jansport
backpack (which proceeded to last for something like six years, that streach
ending only because it was stolen); I've become quite the believer that, in
SOME, cases, you really DO get what you pay for.  I put a good $30 into my
current backpack; but it has lasted me almost three years now; wheras in
elementary and middle school, I'd go through at least three PER year.

The trick is, of course, figureing out when that extra 50% cost gets you heavy
canvas and quadruple stiches, and when it gets you nothing more than a patch
with a tommy hillfugger logo on it.

Honda already has cars rolling on the streets that are cooler looking than 
that glorified toaster with wheels.  I'm sure we'll have flying cars, but 
they won't be designed anything like that.  Ever heard of coefficient of 
friction?  how about drag / lift?

That is by far the ugliest concept car I've seen to date.  Even the honda 
toaster-mobile with the motorbike storage in the side doors was better.

Subject: BUSH SUPPORTERS: Still sounds like s&m to me!

  I agree, Sadam is, or was a first class thug, but again I have to
remind well meaning "patriotic" people one more time, like they are in
some hypnotic trance and need to wake up from it, that Sadam wouldn't
have been where he was without the USA. We put him in power to counteract
a Leftist government we didn't like, we gave him the WMDs, we gave him
the helicopter to spray the Kurds and knew about it. Back in 90 I think,
or the late 80's, Donald Rumsfeld was sucking up to Sadam. He was our
friend back then (when he was busy brutalizing and gassing his people)
because he was Iran's enemy. We turned against Sadam when he wanted to
nationalize Iraqi oil and when he invaded Kuwait, a Provence of Iraq
stolen from Iraq to set up a puppet regime to have access to oil. Kuwait
was stealing oil from Iraq and the US blocked any efforts for Iraq to get
justice. Why all the concern about him now?
  To be blunt, patriotic Americans and their honest but dumbed down
patriotism have been played on big time by Bush. Bush, along with most of
his neo conservative, religious fundamentalist (religious fascism) or
Ayan Rand's Objectionist (secular fascism)  cronies, nearly all of them
draft dodgers who are so willing to put our troops, most of them kids of
color and poor white kids in so called "wars of liberation" i.e.
"Operation Iraqi Freedom", but when it came for them to show their
patriotism in their youth, had their daddies fix their military
conscription. Bush/Blair fabricated intelligence about Sadam's WMDs and
the truth is coming out. Are you hearing what Blair's former cabinet
ministers are saying? It's interesting to hear what kind of lies they are
telling us to cover their previous lies. 
  Bush and his posy are the real traitors and need to be impeached and
tried as war criminals, right along with Milosivich. If you think the war
is outrageous, thanks to this tax cut (how do you justify millionaires
getting $91,000 and up refunds), the capitalist are doing to America what
they did to Russia when the Soviet Union collapsed. They came in and
cleaned out the country of it's wealth and left the country poor,
starving and controlled by the Mafia. this tax cut is legalized
embezzlement of our, not their wealth.
  Many Americans can't come to grips with the fact that America is not a
divine country, no more blessed than any other country, our prayers and
provocations for god to bless the USA is no more answered that any other
prayer or provocation to a divinity another country may invoke. Our god
is no better than someone else's god. We are so blinded by the red white
and blue that we become bewildered when the rest of the world doesn't
agree with our "divine destiny" illusion and when we act it out in the
world, like a vain girl who can't understand why not everyone thinks
she's not all that.  We become extremely enraged when someone dares to
point out the reality that we are not as pure and holy as we try to
constantly make believe we are with our obsessive and cult like
patriotism. We can't and will not believe we can do no wrong and we
refuse to believe that we can be as brutal and fascist as anyone else.
When we do things that the world condemns us on, it can't be wrong
because the America did it? And since we are so "blessed by god", how can
anything we do be wrong? Listen to dumbed down Americans when they loose
the debate on Bush and faced with the truth about the Iraqi war and it
quickly descends into charges of being unpatriotic and un American, ugly
name calling, threats and character assignation, and the worse of all
when you can't defend Bush and his war anymore; "but we got rid of
Sadam!"  There are two untouchables in America you dare not speak up
against; god (the official version and manipulation of god) and American
Values.  There is a Hitler, Stalin, Sadam, Mugabe, Kim IL potential in
all of us. What is bringing us down to their level is our
pompous/supremist attitude about ourselves and our denial that we can go
and have many times gone that low.
  We may think we "liberated" Iraq, but the only people who believe that
is us. The Iraqis don't think so. We trashed their country to get to a
toothless dictator who was no threat to it's neighbors or especially to
the US, all to get to the oil supply. His WMD's (again, supplied by the
US) was destroyed and verified. We scowled the country and haven't found
a thing. Bush and doggy style Blair said they had evidence and knew where
the WMDs were. Remember the lie about Sadam trying to purchase plutonium
from Africa? Even Sadam's scientist with all the bribes we give them
can't come up with them, neither can the captured government leaders tell
them where something that doesn't exist is. Where are they? What was the
reason to go to war premised on lies?
  Our troops are being ambushed and killed everyday by people who are
telling us that we are not liberators and that they want us out. On the
other hand, reports are coming out about racist attitudes toward Iraqis
and condescending views toward Islam by US troops, house searches where
families are thrown down to the ground with M-16's pointed at their heads
and women being disrespected, that US troops are firing on mostly
peaceful demonstrations, mostly about pay and needed services, and
killing a whole bunch of people for exercising a right we will loose
under Patriot Act II, and much of this is fueling the drive by's on US
troops. Many are saying US troops are beginning to act like Israeli
soldiers in regards to the Palestinians. 
  I don't blame the troops, they are canon fotter and expendable labor
for the rich and powerful. Because most of the NCOs came from shitty
schools in the first place and join the military to get an education,
they are not as educated and this situation being taken advantaged of by
those who give them orders and believe what they are being told by the
draft dodgers back in Washington and the elitist educated military
officers.
  Afghanistan is a disaster. Our puppet leader Karzi only rules Kabul,
nothing much outside of the city limits. The warlords are in control
again, women are getting beaten up again, heroin production is blossoming
again and where is American concern? Where's Afghanistan's liberation? We
say Iran, North Korea, Syria are the axis of evil, what about Myamar
(Burma) and it's brutal military dictatorship who abducts people to work
as slave labor to build roads and resorts for the tourists? What about
Zimbabwe where Mugabe is putting into prison dissidents on the charges of
treason and being responsible for the starvation of millions of his
people? What about Nigeria who guns down protestors by the request of oil
companies like Shell/Texaco who are protesting their land being taken
away and their land and water being poisoned by companies like
Shell/Texaco? Where's the concern for China where much of the products
imported here were made by slave prison labor, where prisoners have their
kidneys and other body parts forcibly taken out to be sold on the organ
donor market? shall I mention what they are doing to Tibet?
  As bad as Sadam was, he was no worse than ruthless people we support
and are not on our axis of evil list. They are not "evil" because we can
exploit and control. Under Sadam, Iraqis had one of the highest standard
of living in the middle east until we started to enforce and embargo, and
killed hundreds of thousands of it's people, mostly children, with hunger
and dysentery. Iraqis had a liberal/secular government that was actually
more free than our friends in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Jordan and Egypt,
with free education and health care to all it's citizens. Women could
vote, get educated, drive a car and choose to wear the berka or not in
Sadam's Iraq. Iraqis remember the better days and wonder how destroying
their country and leaving them in ruins like we did in Afghanistan is
liberating them?
  With schools closing, people loosing their jobs, health care being cut,
our infrastructure falling apart, the rich stealing the country's wealth,
the Anti Rave/Crack house laws, people going to jail for 20 years to life
for growing pot for the sick, our computers being snooped on, me possibly
getting into serious trouble from Ashcroft's Justice Department for this
post, and loosing my citizenship and being deported to Guantanamo Bay for
dissenting under Patriot Act II, in my personal opinion, we need to
liberate ourselves before we become "liberators" of others. Regime change
begins at home first.
  But if Americans continue to believe and stand behind Bush and refuse
to unwrap themselves from the small world of the red, white and blue and
continue to live in "god bless America" denial, then we will get the
government we deserve. I will shed no crocodile tears when fascism comes
to our concerts, clubs and raves, our homes and in our personal lives.
When enough Americans become "losers" in our emerging Darwinian, compete
or be left behind ethos, and loose their jobs and end up living in homes
made up of scrap metal and cardboard boxes like our neighbors in the
south, while the rich with their tax cuts build million dollar homes up
in the hills, maybe we will have an uprising then. But then it may be too
late. 
  This isn't a "left" or "right" issue, this is way beyond names and
labels. This has absolutely nothing to do with being "liberal" or
"conservative", this is all to do about fascism and a government that are
predators, and not only prey on defenseless countries around the world,
but ignorant Americans and patriotism. These people are no more honorable
than the Benny Hinns and Pat Robertsons of fundamentalist Christianity
who prey on the ignorance and fear of good honest people.
  To get our freedom back then may take a lot of blood letting on the
streets and sacrificing, like what women, labor, people of color and gays
did to secure a place in the Bill of Rights and the constitution. But
with our addiction to fear and materialism and with plenty of diversions
to keep us dumb and pacified, we may not be up to the challenge and
become the most pitied people that ever existed.
 To be a Bush supporter and to be a raver still sounds like s&m to me!
 Peace, Bodhi ^ _ ^

Hrm, but of course, George W. Bush is of course the one who put him in 
power, right?

I don't care, we should have finished the job over a decade ago, imo.

I got 4,000 back for a tax refund. I got 3,200 back last year. I made 
about the same amount of money too. I'm kinda happy about the tax cut, 
and I'm not going to complain this year.

Of course, those hundreds of thousands of people he's executed for 
speaking out against his dictatorship, or the thousands of kurds in 
northern iraq he used chemical weapons on don't matter. Or even those 
300 skeletons of kurds found in boxes in southern iraq, all of which 
were executed. Nah, it's cool.

I don't know, I was going to join the military before I got married. I 
remember scoring a 98% on my ASVAB. Hell, I got a 36 on my ACT. I would 
join now if I weren't a single father. West Point looks very good on a 
resume.

I don't agree with about 99% of what you say, but quite frankly, that's 
what makes our country great. I'll continue to support bush and the war 
on iraq.

Anyhow, This is the last time I'm going to respond to this. I hate sound 
like a dick, but I remember subscribing to sfraves@hyperreal.org, not 
ihatebush@hyperreal.org.

Perhaps you should check your Iraqi history.  Saddam came to power
internally through his party.  But then, I don't expect a lefty to do
his research.

  I agree, Sadam is, or was a first class thug, but again I have to
remind well meaning "patriotic" people one more time, like they are in
some hypnotic trance and need to wake up from it, that Sadam wouldn't
have been where he was without the USA. We put him in power to
counteract
a Leftist government we didn't like, we gave him the WMDs, we gave him
the helicopter to spray the Kurds and knew about it. Back in 90 I think,
or the late 80's, Donald Rumsfeld was sucking up to Sadam. He was our
friend back then (when he was busy brutalizing and gassing his people)
because he was Iran's enemy. We turned against Sadam when he wanted to
nationalize Iraqi oil and when he invaded Kuwait, a Provence of Iraq
stolen from Iraq to set up a puppet regime to have access to oil. Kuwait
was stealing oil from Iraq and the US blocked any efforts for Iraq to
get
justice. Why all the concern about him now?
  To be blunt, patriotic Americans and their honest but dumbed down
patriotism have been played on big time by Bush. Bush, along with most
of
his neo conservative, religious fundamentalist (religious fascism) or
Ayan Rand's Objectionist (secular fascism)  cronies, nearly all of them
draft dodgers who are so willing to put our troops, most of them kids of
color and poor white kids in so called "wars of liberation" i.e.
"Operation Iraqi Freedom", but when it came for them to show their
patriotism in their youth, had their daddies fix their military
conscription. Bush/Blair fabricated intelligence about Sadam's WMDs and
the truth is coming out. Are you hearing what Blair's former cabinet
ministers are saying? It's interesting to hear what kind of lies they
are
telling us to cover their previous lies. 
  Bush and his posy are the real traitors and need to be impeached and
tried as war criminals, right along with Milosivich. If you think the
war
is outrageous, thanks to this tax cut (how do you justify millionaires
getting $91,000 and up refunds), the capitalist are doing to America
what
they did to Russia when the Soviet Union collapsed. They came in and
cleaned out the country of it's wealth and left the country poor,
starving and controlled by the Mafia. this tax cut is legalized
embezzlement of our, not their wealth.
  Many Americans can't come to grips with the fact that America is not a
divine country, no more blessed than any other country, our prayers and
provocations for god to bless the USA is no more answered that any other
prayer or provocation to a divinity another country may invoke. Our god
is no better than someone else's god. We are so blinded by the red white
and blue that we become bewildered when the rest of the world doesn't
agree with our "divine destiny" illusion and when we act it out in the
world, like a vain girl who can't understand why not everyone thinks
she's not all that.  We become extremely enraged when someone dares to
point out the reality that we are not as pure and holy as we try to
constantly make believe we are with our obsessive and cult like
patriotism. We can't and will not believe we can do no wrong and we
refuse to believe that we can be as brutal and fascist as anyone else.
When we do things that the world condemns us on, it can't be wrong
because the America did it? And since we are so "blessed by god", how
can
anything we do be wrong? Listen to dumbed down Americans when they loose
the debate on Bush and faced with the truth about the Iraqi war and it
quickly descends into charges of being unpatriotic and un American, ugly
name calling, threats and character assignation, and the worse of all
when you can't defend Bush and his war anymore; "but we got rid of
Sadam!"  There are two untouchables in America you dare not speak up
against; god (the official version and manipulation of god) and American
Values.  There is a Hitler, Stalin, Sadam, Mugabe, Kim IL potential in
all of us. What is bringing us down to their level is our
pompous/supremist attitude about ourselves and our denial that we can go
and have many times gone that low.
  We may think we "liberated" Iraq, but the only people who believe that
is us. The Iraqis don't think so. We trashed their country to get to a
toothless dictator who was no threat to it's neighbors or especially to
the US, all to get to the oil supply. His WMD's (again, supplied by the
US) was destroyed and verified. We scowled the country and haven't found
a thing. Bush and doggy style Blair said they had evidence and knew
where
the WMDs were. Remember the lie about Sadam trying to purchase plutonium
from Africa? Even Sadam's scientist with all the bribes we give them
can't come up with them, neither can the captured government leaders
tell
them where something that doesn't exist is. Where are they? What was the
reason to go to war premised on lies?
  Our troops are being ambushed and killed everyday by people who are
telling us that we are not liberators and that they want us out. On the
other hand, reports are coming out about racist attitudes toward Iraqis
and condescending views toward Islam by US troops, house searches where
families are thrown down to the ground with M-16's pointed at their
heads
and women being disrespected, that US troops are firing on mostly
peaceful demonstrations, mostly about pay and needed services, and
killing a whole bunch of people for exercising a right we will loose
under Patriot Act II, and much of this is fueling the drive by's on US
troops. Many are saying US troops are beginning to act like Israeli
soldiers in regards to the Palestinians. 
  I don't blame the troops, they are canon fotter and expendable labor
for the rich and powerful. Because most of the NCOs came from shitty
schools in the first place and join the military to get an education,
they are not as educated and this situation being taken advantaged of by
those who give them orders and believe what they are being told by the
draft dodgers back in Washington and the elitist educated military
officers.
  Afghanistan is a disaster. Our puppet leader Karzi only rules Kabul,
nothing much outside of the city limits. The warlords are in control
again, women are getting beaten up again, heroin production is
blossoming
again and where is American concern? Where's Afghanistan's liberation?
We
say Iran, North Korea, Syria are the axis of evil, what about Myamar
(Burma) and it's brutal military dictatorship who abducts people to work
as slave labor to build roads and resorts for the tourists? What about
Zimbabwe where Mugabe is putting into prison dissidents on the charges
of
treason and being responsible for the starvation of millions of his
people? What about Nigeria who guns down protestors by the request of
oil
companies like Shell/Texaco who are protesting their land being taken
away and their land and water being poisoned by companies like
Shell/Texaco? Where's the concern for China where much of the products
imported here were made by slave prison labor, where prisoners have
their
kidneys and other body parts forcibly taken out to be sold on the organ
donor market? shall I mention what they are doing to Tibet?
  As bad as Sadam was, he was no worse than ruthless people we support
and are not on our axis of evil list. They are not "evil" because we can
exploit and control. Under Sadam, Iraqis had one of the highest standard
of living in the middle east until we started to enforce and embargo,
and
killed hundreds of thousands of it's people, mostly children, with
hunger
and dysentery. Iraqis had a liberal/secular government that was actually
more free than our friends in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Jordan and Egypt,
with free education and health care to all it's citizens. Women could
vote, get educated, drive a car and choose to wear the berka or not in
Sadam's Iraq. Iraqis remember the better days and wonder how destroying
their country and leaving them in ruins like we did in Afghanistan is
liberating them?
  With schools closing, people loosing their jobs, health care being
cut,
our infrastructure falling apart, the rich stealing the country's
wealth,
the Anti Rave/Crack house laws, people going to jail for 20 years to
life
for growing pot for the sick, our computers being snooped on, me
possibly
getting into serious trouble from Ashcroft's Justice Department for this
post, and loosing my citizenship and being deported to Guantanamo Bay
for
dissenting under Patriot Act II, in my personal opinion, we need to
liberate ourselves before we become "liberators" of others. Regime
change
begins at home first.
  But if Americans continue to believe and stand behind Bush and refuse
to unwrap themselves from the small world of the red, white and blue and
continue to live in "god bless America" denial, then we will get the
government we deserve. I will shed no crocodile tears when fascism comes
to our concerts, clubs and raves, our homes and in our personal lives.
When enough Americans become "losers" in our emerging Darwinian, compete
or be left behind ethos, and loose their jobs and end up living in homes
made up of scrap metal and cardboard boxes like our neighbors in the
south, while the rich with their tax cuts build million dollar homes up
in the hills, maybe we will have an uprising then. But then it may be
too
late. 
  This isn't a "left" or "right" issue, this is way beyond names and
labels. This has absolutely nothing to do with being "liberal" or
"conservative", this is all to do about fascism and a government that
are
predators, and not only prey on defenseless countries around the world,
but ignorant Americans and patriotism. These people are no more
honorable
than the Benny Hinns and Pat Robertsons of fundamentalist Christianity
who prey on the ignorance and fear of good honest people.
  To get our freedom back then may take a lot of blood letting on the
streets and sacrificing, like what women, labor, people of color and
gays
did to secure a place in the Bill of Rights and the constitution. But
with our addiction to fear and materialism and with plenty of diversions
to keep us dumb and pacified, we may not be up to the challenge and
become the most pitied people that ever existed.
 To be a Bush supporter and to be a raver still sounds like s&m to me!
 Peace, Bodhi ^ _ ^

ok... so the Red Stickman asked me to burn some cd's

have been on cds i've given out in the past.

the cds are relatively crude; there are some

quite simple, so please don't expect massive

That wasn't the mandate of the true international coalition that was
created.  Desert Storm was to liberate Kuwait, that's all.  The coalition
did not want to get rid of Sadam.  And back then, we actually cared about
what the international community wanted.

Well great, enjoy that cash now, my friend.  Becuase eventually, all of us
well have to pony up the dough to keep this country running.

Yeah, liberals are tax and spend.  But conservatives are just spend.  
If the Republicans actually cut the services needed to pay for these 
tax cuts, there would be outrage in America.  But instead, they are just
passing the burden off to us, the youth of the nation.  Oh we'll pay.
don't think we won't pay.

America would have never supported a war if Bush billed it as needed
simply to liberate Iraq.  Lets face it, Bush lied to get the country
to War, and thats an impeachable offense if there ever was any.  

If Clinton got impeached for lying about a blowjob, Bush should be to for
lying on why we went to war.

The national media is bought and payed for by the Republicans.  We have to use
whatever means left to get our viewpoint out.  sorry if we made you think.

{yawn}  do some fact checking will you.

Hussein rose quickly through the ranks, known for his
extreme efficiency as a torturer. He was appointed to
be a member of the Baath Regional Command. In 1964,
Hussein was jailed by some "rightist" military
officers who opposed the Baathist takeover. In 1966 he
"escaped" from prison and Saddam's older cousin,
General Ahmad Hassan al-Bakr, appointed him deputy
Secretary-General of the Baathists.

Saddam set up the Baathist internal party security
system known as the Jihaz Haneen. It was to serve as
the vehicle for his rise to power in Iraq. In 1968,
another major upheaval in Iraq gave Hussein the
greatest opportunity for further advancement; his
mentor, Gen. Bakr and the Baathist seized the
government.

Saddam did come to power through the Ba'ath Party and ruthlessness and
many coup attempts.  But this is the same time we were heavily
supporting him because we were aiming to oust Khumeini(sp?) and he's the
one who started the process by trying to steal an iranian waterway that
let up to at least 8 years of war with the US not necessarily at his
side, but helping none the less including the sales and instructions on
how to use chemical weapons.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] BUSH SUPPORTERS: Still sounds like s&m to me!



What exactly is incorrect in that paragraph?

-US gave Sadam all the technology to make WMDs. 
-US gave Sadam American helicopters
-Rumsfeld made numerous visits to Iraq to meet with Sadam in the '80s
-US fully supported Iraq to go to war with Iran (And we helped Iran too,
hence the Iran-Contra scandal)

Please provide references to discredit these facts.. go righty go!

Dude, that is one of the best writings I've seen on our current situation.  Thanks.

I agree, Sadam is, or was a first class thug, but again I have to
remind well meaning "patriotic" people one more time, like they are in
some hypnotic trance and need to wake up from it, that Sadam wouldn't
have been where he was without the USA. We put him in power to counteract
a Leftist government we didn't like, we gave him the WMDs, we gave him
the helicopter to spray the Kurds and knew about it. Back in 90 I think,
or the late 80's, Donald Rumsfeld was sucking up to Sadam. He was our
friend back then (when he was busy brutalizing and gassing his people)
because he was Iran's enemy. We turned against Sadam when he wanted to
nationalize Iraqi oil and when he invaded Kuwait, a Provence of Iraq
stolen from Iraq to set up a puppet regime to have access to oil. Kuwait
was stealing oil from Iraq and the US blocked any efforts for Iraq to get
justice. Why all the concern about him now?
To be blunt, patriotic Americans and their honest but dumbed down
patriotism have been played on big time by Bush. Bush, along with most of
his neo conservative, religious fundamentalist (religious fascism) or
Ayan Rand's Objectionist (secular fascism) cronies, nearly all of them
draft dodgers who are so willing to put our troops, most of them kids of
color and poor white kids in so called "wars of liberation" i.e.
"Operation Iraqi Freedom", but when it came for them to show their
patriotism in their youth, had their daddies fix their military
conscription. Bush/Blair fabricated intelligence about Sadam's WMDs and
the truth is coming out. Are you hearing what Blair's former cabinet
ministers are saying? It's interesting to hear what kind of lies they are
telling us to cover their previous lies. 
Bush and his posy are the real traitors and need to be impeached and
tried as war criminals, right along with Milosivich. If you think the war
is outrageous, thanks to this tax cut (how do you justify millionaires
getting $91,000 and up refunds), the capitalist are doing to America what
they did to Russia when the Soviet Union collapsed. They came in and
cleaned out the country of it's wealth and left the country poor,
starving and controlled by the Mafia. this tax cut is legalized
embezzlement of our, not their wealth.
Many Americans can't come to grips with the fact that America is not a
divine country, no more blessed than any other country, our prayers and
provocations for god to bless the USA is no more answered that any other
prayer or provocation to a divinity another country may invoke. Our god
is no better than someone else's god. We are so blinded by the red white
and blue that we become bewildered when the rest of the world doesn't
agree with our "divine destiny" illusion and when we act it out in the
world, like a vain girl who can't understand why not everyone thinks
she's not all that. We become extremely enraged when someone dares to
point out the reality that we are not as pure and holy as we try to
constantly make believe we are with our obsessive and cult like
patriotism. We can't and will not believe we can do no wrong and we
refuse to believe that we can be as brutal and fascist as anyone else.
When we do things that the world condemns us on, it can't be wrong
because the America did it? And since we are so "blessed by god", how can
anything we do be wrong? Listen to dumbed down Americans when they loose
the debate on Bush and faced with the truth about the Iraqi war and it
quickly descends into charges of being unpatriotic and un American, ugly
name calling, threats and character assignation, and the worse of all
when you can't defend Bush and his war anymore; "but we got rid of
Sadam!" There are two untouchables in America you dare not speak up
against; god (the official version and manipulation of god) and American
Values. There is a Hitler, Stalin, Sadam, Mugabe, Kim IL potential in
all of us. What is bringing us down to their level is our
pompous/supremist attitude about ourselves and our denial that we can go
and have many times gone that low.
We may think we "liberated" Iraq, but the only people who believe that
is us. The Iraqis don't think so. We trashed their country to get to a
toothless dictator who was no threat to it's neighbors or especially to
the US, all to get to the oil supply. His WMD's (again, supplied by the
US) was destroyed and verified. We scowled the country and haven't found
a thing. Bush and doggy style Blair said they had evidence and knew where
the WMDs were. Remember the lie about Sadam trying to purchase plutonium
from Africa? Even Sadam's scientist with all the bribes we give them
can't come up with them, neither can the captured government leaders tell
them where something that doesn't exist is. Where are they? What was the
reason to go to war premised on lies?
Our troops are being ambushed and killed everyday by people who are
telling us that we are not liberators and that they want us out. On the
other hand, reports are coming out about racist attitudes toward Iraqis
and condescending views toward Islam by US troops, house searches where
families are thrown down to the ground with M-16's pointed at their heads
and women being disrespected, that US troops are firing on mostly
peaceful demonstrations, mostly about pay and needed services, and
killing a whole bunch of people for exercising a right we will loose
under Patriot Act II, and much of this is fueling the drive by's on US
troops. Many are saying US troops are beginning to act like Israeli
soldiers in regards to the Palestinians. 
I don't blame the troops, they are canon fotter and expendable labor
for the rich and powerful. Because most of the NCOs came from shitty
schools in the first place and join the military to get an education,
they are not as educated and this situation being taken advantaged of by
those who give them orders and believe what they are being told by the
draft dodgers back in Washington and the elitist educated military
officers.
Afghanistan is a disaster. Our puppet leader Karzi only rules Kabul,
nothing much outside of the city limits. The warlords are in control
again, women are getting beaten up again, heroin production is blossoming
again and where is American concern? Where's Afghanistan's liberation? We
say Iran, North Korea, Syria are the axis of evil, what about Myamar
(Burma) and it's brutal military dictatorship who abducts people to work
as slave labor to build roads and resorts for the tourists? What about
Zimbabwe where Mugabe is putting into prison dissidents on the charges of
treason and being responsible for the starvation of millions of his
people? What about Nigeria who guns down protestors by the request of oil
companies like Shell/Texaco who are protesting their land being taken
away and their land and water being poisoned by companies like
Shell/Texaco? Where's the concern for China where much of the products
imported here were made by slave prison labor, where prisoners have their
kidneys and other body parts forcibly taken out to be sold on the organ
donor market? shall I mention what they are doing to Tibet?
As bad as Sadam was, he was no worse than ruthless people we support
and are not on our axis of evil list. They are not "evil" because we can
exploit and control. Under Sadam, Iraqis had one of the highest standard
of living in the middle east until we started to enforce and embargo, and
killed hundreds of thousands of it's people, mostly children, with hunger
and dysentery. Iraqis had a liberal/secular government that was actually
more free than our friends in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Jordan and Egypt,
with free education and health care to all it's citizens. Women could
vote, get educated, drive a car and choose to wear the berka or not in
Sadam's Iraq. Iraqis remember the better days and wonder how destroying
their country and leaving them in ruins like we did in Afghanistan is
liberating them?
With schools closing, people loosing their jobs, health care being cut,
our infrastructure falling apart, the rich stealing the country's wealth,
the Anti Rave/Crack house laws, people going to jail for 20 years to life
for growing pot for the sick, our computers being snooped on, me possibly
getting into serious trouble from Ashcroft's Justice Department for this
post, and loosing my citizenship and being deported to Guantanamo Bay for
dissenting under Patriot Act II, in my personal opinion, we need to
liberate ourselves before we become "liberators" of others. Regime change
begins at home first.
But if Americans continue to believe and stand behind Bush and refuse
to unwrap themselves from the small world of the red, white and blue and
continue to live in "god bless America" denial, then we will get the
government we deserve. I will shed no crocodile tears when fascism comes
to our concerts, clubs and raves, our homes and in our personal lives.
When enough Americans become "losers" in our emerging Darwinian, compete
or be left behind ethos, and loose their jobs and end up living in homes
made up of scrap metal and cardboard boxes like our neighbors in the
south, while the rich with their tax cuts build million dollar homes up
in the hills, maybe we will have an uprising then. But then it may be too
late. 
This isn't a "left" or "right" issue, this is way beyond names and
labels. This has absolutely nothing to do with being "liberal" or
"conservative", this is all to do about fascism and a government that are
predators, and not only prey on defenseless countries around the world,
but ignorant Americans and patriotism. These people are no more honorable
than the Benny Hinns and Pat Robertsons of fundamentalist Christianity
who prey on the ignorance and fear of good honest people.
To get our freedom back then may take a lot of blood letting on the
streets and sacrificing, like what women, labor, people of color and gays
did to secure a place in the Bill of Rights and the constitution. But
with our addiction to fear and materialism and with plenty of diversions
to keep us dumb and pacified, we may not be up to the challenge and
become the most pitied people that ever existed.
To be a Bush supporter and to be a raver still sounds like s&m to me!
Peace, Bodhi ^ _ ^

I could say a lot about all this, but I think a picture is definitely 
worth a thousand words.

factual source of information. If you really want to make a point, you
should find a more objective source than one that places "Letters to a
Young Conservative" at the top of their recommmended reading list.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] BUSH SUPPORTERS: Still sounds like s&m to me!

We did not give WMD or a helicopter to spray Kurds....we gave things that
were
to be used for non-military purposes and Saddam used them for the purpose of
killing Kurds.

Kuwait is not a province of Iraq.  The world (not just us) turned against
Saddam when he
invaded Kuwait.  Kuwait was not setup by the U.S. as  a puppet country to
get oil.
http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+kw0017)

We did not put Saddam in power, though we helped
him in order to keep the Iran/Iraq war a stalemate.  That isn't the same as
liking the guy
and yelling "ra ra go Hussein go!" from the bleachers.

Iraq's oil was nationalized in 1972....how could we turn against Saddam for
wanting to
nationalize in the 80's or 90's during the Kuwait fiasco?  They'd been
nationalized for a long
long time.  Duh.

Via the history channel..

&word=saddam+rise+to+power

I challenge anyone to post PROOF that the US government in some way
financed his ascension.  

The Ascension of Saddam Hussein 

In 1979, President Bakr resigned, and Saddam Hussein Takriti assumed
control of the government. He immediately purged the Ba'ath party after
an unsuccessful coup, killing leftist members. War between Iran and
Iraq, primarily over the Shatt al Arab waterway, erupted full-scale in
1980 (see Iran-Iraq War). The eight-year war became a series of mutual
attacks and stalemates, as both countries' oil production fell
drastically, the death toll rose, and great mutual destruction was
inflicted. Poison gas was reportedly used by both sides, and by Iraq on
Kurdish villages as the Kurdish rebellion continued. Eventually, a
cease-fire under the auspices of the United Nations led to the war's end
in 1988. Iran and Iraq restored diplomatic relations in 1990.

the exact details on US's support to Sadam isn't the point.

The point is that America often supports the most brutal dictators in the
world.

So to say "The war was justified becuase we ousted an evil dictator!" is
nonsense.  There are far worst dictators we could have ousted if America
is in the liberation business.

But even that isn't really the point.  The point is that War makes some folks
feel good.  makes them feel big and rightous.  They like being on the
winnning team.  To these people, the reasons why we went to war are completely
irrevelent.  The point is, we went to war, we kicked ass, and that means
America is great.

Arguing the details on why we went to war with these people is pointless.

But just remember, the day American leaders can lie their way into war,
and the people don't care, is the day Democracy is dead.

Welcome to the facist state, you'll be feeling the oppression soon enough, just
you wait.

Subject: PINK TRIANGLE PARTY: What day is it?

 I forgot if it's on Friday night or Saturday.  Anyone who is new here
and never been to a Pink Triangle Party, you are in for a sic time!  18th
and Castro near Cala foods is blocked off, and there is teckno up until
4am. Technically not legal, but a SF tradition and the 5-0 leaves it
alone and winks at open container laws as long as it's not too blatent
and things don't get out of hand, but most likely they don't. That's why
they're down with it. The only thing you may see that's funky is some
drunk str8 guy getting head in the Walgreen's parking lot. It's not
anything like the infamous Halloween party in the Castro,  because it
doesn't attract that kind of crowd, very little violence, totally heathen
with just a bunch of queers and open minded str8 people having a good
time. Nothing wrong with that as long as people play safe.
  Peace, Bodhi ^ _ ^

I see your point, however, the details in this case were important.  If
you were following the thread, you would see I was responding to the
lefty meme that the "US put saddam into power".  So the details were
important.

On that note, and since you brought it up.  I'd like to address your
Chomskyesqe "the US supports dictators" remark.  It's easy to paint the
US in a bad light when you take an event out of context.  Yes, the
support of oppressive dictators is bad.  Ever wonder why we did that?
Ever do any research into the facts involved of the assassinations we
carried out?  I bet you haven't.  you're probably satisfied with your
smug self-righteousness so there is no need to know "the details".  I
was idealistic once too and you'll probably grow out of it when you find
out how the real world works.  

I'd rather not waste this techno email server trying to convince someone
too lazy to do his own research outside of listening to Chomsky or the
democratic underground.

Why don't you ask the 2 million Africans that died last year what
oppression is?  If you aren't breaking the law, you won't get arrested.
From what I have seen, as long as a Rave organizer makes a true effort
to keep drugs out, the cops leave them alone.  Of course there will be
mistakes made but so far, I haven't seen many.

Thx for making a great point!!  We are already losing some of our
liberties...  Do I need to remind this list that Dance Music/Raves are
now under attack by such laws as the "Rave Act?"  Isn't that a sign of
oppression?!

How does a "rave organizer" make a true effort to keep drugs out of an 
event, Scarlet?  Strip search?:)

In fact, this law is not in the spirit of true conservatism; rather it is 
an abridgement of first amendment rights.  Civil liberties.  Flinging 
idiotic stereotypical phrases like "democratic underground" (what is that 
-- democrats meeting in old missile silos?) and misinformed "lefties" to my 
mind indicates a sixties political mentality.  The Rave Act in its present 
form was sponsored by "lefty" "underground" Democrats.

Personally, I see that there is not much difference between Islamic 
fundamentalist regimes and the clear direction in which our government is 
moving:  both wish to create theocratic states that fuse law with religious 
beliefs;  neither like dancing, or pleasure for its own sake;  both value 
preserving security and order over freedom.

I'm for freedom.  I believe in the Constitution and the Bill of 
Rights.  What does that make me?  How do you define those who would trade 
freedom for security and theocratically-based government?

Love,

Apollo

I'll be honest.  I've lived outside of America for the past five years
so I haven't heard much about how the RAVE act is actually being
implemented.  I've read a few news articles and I've heard some first
hand stories but I'm hardly an expert on the subject.  What I don't like
is people and their over emotional hyperbole about what is happening to
America when you have no real idea.  You just assume.  It is a
"perception" that I take issue with.  If you were to support your
opinion with facts, I might agree.  E.g. since the implementation of the
RAVE act, X number of parties were shut down when no drugs were involved
resulting in blah blah blah.  But you don't do that.  You just say that
because the RAVE act was passed it is automatically bad and fascist.
All I heard last year was how the US was becoming a police state because
of Ashcroft's desire to arrest terrorist suspects without legal
representation or rights for them.  I haven't heard of any of these mass
arrests that the left predicted.  In fact, I saw many a peace protestor
doing tons of "subversive" acts during the war and still, no mass
arrests.  I'm a show me guy.  Show me or save your breath.  

It is quite obvious when people are doing drugs other than alcohol at
raves.  You make sure people know you run a clean show and have security
escort the pill heads out the door.  Life isn't as fun when you have to
be responsible and follow the laws of the land is it?

Btw.. this is the Dem underground.  Warning: it is a freak show of lefty
idiots.  http://www.democraticunderground.com/

Among the parties that were broken up with no drugs being confiscated were
in New Orleans (FB Society) and Montana (a non profit fundraiser).I think
that allot of the resentment toward the rave act is directed at how it was
passed. The rave act was attached to the bill that passed the Amber Alert
System, not allowing the law to be voted on by itself. This practice in
general infuriates me..... I mean who wouldn't want to protect children
...right?

because the RAVE act was passed it is automatically bad and fascist.
All I heard last year was how the US was becoming a police state because

How does a "rave organizer" make a true effort to keep drugs out of an 
event, Scarlet?  Strip search?:)

In fact, this law is not in the spirit of true conservatism; rather it
is 
an abridgement of first amendment rights.  Civil liberties.  Flinging 
idiotic stereotypical phrases like "democratic underground" (what is
that 
-- democrats meeting in old missile silos?) and misinformed "lefties" to
my 
mind indicates a sixties political mentality.  The Rave Act in its
present 
form was sponsored by "lefty" "underground" Democrats.

Personally, I see that there is not much difference between Islamic 
fundamentalist regimes and the clear direction in which our government
is 
moving:  both wish to create theocratic states that fuse law with
religious 
beliefs;  neither like dancing, or pleasure for its own sake;  both
value 
preserving security and order over freedom.

I'm for freedom.  I believe in the Constitution and the Bill of 
Rights.  What does that make me?  How do you define those who would
trade 
freedom for security and theocratically-based government?

Love,

Apollo

So it's ok to take these people who are on "drugs other than alcohol" 
and send them off to be a driving/pedestrian/bicycling threat to the 
public, just for the sake of avoiding a stiff penalty under a 
poorly-thought out law? C'mon now. How 'bout some harm reduction? How 
'bout some EMTs on sight? I don't want some hophead kicked out of a 
party, only to get in his car (another illegal act) injuring himself, 
his passengers, and whomever he hit, costing us thousands in uncovered 
life support costs. Granted, that's an extreme case, but that's the 
slippery slope being trod upon when simply sweeping problems under the 
rug.

"Captain Scarlet," all I've seen you do thus far is provide support for 
the status quo. Instead of questioning why this law is problematic, you 
seem to apply a "Father Knows Best" attitude of "well if ya don't break 
the law, you've got nothin' to worry about, son."   You know what? In 
Iran, if you don't write bad things about the Ayatollah in your 
newspaper column, they won't throw you in jail and whack you with a 
stick. In China, if you download pictures of naked 
big-breasted-blonde-babes at an internet cafe, it gets shut down and 
the owner locked up. Because that's the damn law. Does that make it 
right?

> Btw.. this is the Dem underground.  Warning: it is a freak show of

Well, since you're so big on empirical "proof," do you have any 
evidence that these lefties are idiots? IQ test results? College 
transcripts? Rejection letters from junior colleges?

Oh, wait, I forgot, the Right will always impatiently ask for immediate 
evidence (see: Blix, Hans), but can't seem to conjure it up when 
they're asked for it (see: Rumsfeld, Donald).  Do I sense a pattern 
here?

those SF protestors broke the law.  they were not arrested for
peacefully protesting.  let's not strip out the context.

don't get me wrong.  i'm not a fan of RAVE or of overbearing police with
a hard on.  however, i hate whiners that say america is going to hell
when they have never truly seen hell.  i have.  i've lived in countries
in asia that have slaves.  they cut their arm or leg off and make them

Well, to be honest I guarantee almost no raves will be shut down by the
race act directly including prison time.  Like has already happened, the
DEA is going to show up at high profile events, show the land
owner/promoter/venue owner what they might face and 9/10 of the people
who own the venue will not allow it to happen on their ground on the
basis that just for renting to someone they may face 250k in fines and
20 years in prison.  Its implementation has just been recent and its
first use was to shut down a NORML fundraiser in Montana after the venue
owners were shown what could happen to them if they let the event go off
and someone might be smokin' a joint.  It costs too much to directly
shut down a party, do the arrests, run the court time etc so most laws
are waved in people's faces as an overbearing warning to spook people
into abiding more by the law even if it is wrong.  In Utah they brew
beer at 2.8% alcohol to stay well under the 3.2% alcohol limit.

Rave act:  1 party threatened about its possible consequences shut down
by owners of venue.  So far its got a 1 for 1 success rate.

And if you happened to miss the mass arrests you should've been down by
where I work, where they were bringing them in by the busload down here
by the base of the bay bridge on embarcadero.  I've also read some scary
livejournals from one of my friends who is a teacher and all of a sudden
one of her Iraqi students had disappeared, family turned up missing, all
approx 2 weeks after their father had disappeared misteriously.  Her
responses from other teachers were even scarier as some of them started
realizing it had happened in their classromes as well but they hadn't
put 2 and 2 together.  Do you honestly think the government wants the
publicity of mass public arrests after running our own concentration
camps for the japanese during WWII?

OK... Maybe you should go on a little "fact-finding mission" then.

So, we have to wait until unconstitutional laws are actually used in
a harmful manner before we can complain about them? That's absolutely
rediculous. Oh wait, nevermind... the RAVE Act's already been used to
stifle *free speech*!

So... you think we should allow our publically elected lawmakers to pass
whatever law they want in good faith that they'll never *implement* it?

Life isn't as fun when the government can tell you what you can or can't
do with *your own body*, or what you can or can't do in *your own home*.
You are aware that the RAVE Act, as it's written, could be used against
you if anyone under the influence of drugs was found in your home,
right?

What is your obsession with left and right? Am I a "lefty" because I
enjoy freedom, or because I feel that nobody should be able to tell me
what I can or can't do with *my* body? Should I pigeonhole you as a
"conservative" because you like telling people how they should live
their lives?

There is an easy remedy for the safety issue.  Simply hand the drugged
person over to the police.

So you call for only enforcing or abiding by the laws you agree with.
Hmm.  Interesting approach.  I believe that is called anarchy.  If you
don't like the law, start a grass roots campaign to get it over turned.
Quit whining about is an do something.  

You bring up the Iranians as an analogy.  That's great.  Because they
are taking matters into their own hands now.  See, they are doing
something.  You aren't.  

China?  You ever been to china?  The people that get shut down for
violating a law didn't pay the police protection money.  LOL.  That is a
poor analogy for this situation.

So it's ok to take these people who are on "drugs other than alcohol" 
and send them off to be a driving/pedestrian/bicycling threat to the 
public, just for the sake of avoiding a stiff penalty under a 
poorly-thought out law? C'mon now. How 'bout some harm reduction? How 
'bout some EMTs on sight? I don't want some hophead kicked out of a 
party, only to get in his car (another illegal act) injuring himself, 
his passengers, and whomever he hit, costing us thousands in uncovered 
life support costs. Granted, that's an extreme case, but that's the 
slippery slope being trod upon when simply sweeping problems under the 
rug.

"Captain Scarlet," all I've seen you do thus far is provide support for 
the status quo. Instead of questioning why this law is problematic, you 
seem to apply a "Father Knows Best" attitude of "well if ya don't break 
the law, you've got nothin' to worry about, son."   You know what? In 
Iran, if you don't write bad things about the Ayatollah in your 
newspaper column, they won't throw you in jail and whack you with a 
stick. In China, if you download pictures of naked 
big-breasted-blonde-babes at an internet cafe, it gets shut down and 
the owner locked up. Because that's the damn law. Does that make it 
right?

> Btw.. this is the Dem underground.  Warning: it is a freak show of

> idiots.  http://www.democraticunderground.com/

Well, since you're so big on empirical "proof," do you have any 
evidence that these lefties are idiots? IQ test results? College 
transcripts? Rejection letters from junior colleges?

Oh, wait, I forgot, the Right will always impatiently ask for immediate 
evidence (see: Blix, Hans), but can't seem to conjure it up when 
they're asked for it (see: Rumsfeld, Donald).  Do I sense a pattern 
here?

Although I cannot stand Ashcroft, there's one thing I cannot stand even
more.  It's
lefties who think that only left is the way to be and it's all about freedom
(this sad and
idiotic transposition that happens in their brain between the words
"liberal" and "freedom")
and that conservative somehow equates to restricted freedom and the KKK and
so on.
UP yours buddy.

One link?  That's it?  One show in Montana gets screwed and now we live
in Iran.  OK.

As for the drugs, you missed my point.  The point is to show the police
that you are taking measures to have a clean party.  You can't possibly
be perfect and using your logic.. since you can't you shouldn't even
try.  Whatever.

I'm not telling anyone how to live their lives.  Far from it.  I'm
telling you that there are consequences to your actions.  Accept
responsibility or pay the price.  You can do whatever you want with your
body as long as you are willing to pay the price.  Rules suck.  If you
don't like them, quit whining and do something about it.  Hell, I'll
join you in getting it overturned or declared unconstitutional.  I'm
just not going to whine about it.

So, we have to wait until unconstitutional laws are actually used in
a harmful manner before we can complain about them? That's absolutely
rediculous. Oh wait, nevermind... the RAVE Act's already been used to
stifle *free speech*!

All political change needs to be started with discourse within the 
population or a community. So what you may label as "whining" could 
very well be the seeds to stir people into doing something about it. 
Airing grievances, whether in a mass protest or on a mailing list is a 
place to start. Bitching and moaning may not solve anything right away, 
but if it makes X number of people think about the issues, then the 
wheels are in motion. Over-idealistic? Perhaps, but silence is far 
worse.

Yeah, horrible analogy. Whereas in China it's a fistful of yuan 
changing hands to keep some people immune from the law, in the states, 
it's performed by giving millions in corporate contributions, or being 
school chums with the right people who ended up on Capitol Hill. So 
yeah, we're better because it happens on a much grander scale. (See: 
Harris, Katherine; Lay, Kenneth.)

FnF doesn't oppose Pride John. I rather resent the grouping of FnF in there
at all because they're SUPPORTING pride. For once I'm going to jump down
your throat a bit and tell you to get your facts straight before you make
assumptions. Show up to FnF and see just how much it supports pride. This is
the same group doing a very similar event to the No on Knight party 3 years
ago. That was to raise money to fight the Knight measure which was rather
anti-gay I'd say.

Those other parties you mention have nothing to do with pride weekend. They
aren't a benefit either. They *pale* in comparison to a group like FnF.

Happy Huggy couldn't even bother to book dj's before putting their names on
a flyer. That shows the idiocy of that group right there. Ugh.

Are you talking about this weekend or next?  The only thing I could find
about a pink triangle event was for the 28th.

 I forgot if it's on Friday night or Saturday.  Anyone who is new here
and never been to a Pink Triangle Party, you are in for a sic time!
18th
and Castro near Cala foods is blocked off, and there is teckno up until
4am. Technically not legal, but a SF tradition and the 5-0 leaves it
alone and winks at open container laws as long as it's not too blatent
and things don't get out of hand, but most likely they don't. That's why
they're down with it. The only thing you may see that's funky is some
drunk str8 guy getting head in the Walgreen's parking lot. It's not
anything like the infamous Halloween party in the Castro,  because it
doesn't attract that kind of crowd, very little violence, totally
heathen
with just a bunch of queers and open minded str8 people having a good
time. Nothing wrong with that as long as people play safe.
  Peace, Bodhi ^ _ ^

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Crazy insane psycho tweaker weekend coming up!!!

Woah there...  I didn't mean to imply that any of said groups were being
deliberately malicious.  In fact, I'd bet that at least one of those I listed
didn't even bother doing their homework and probably didn't KNOW that pride was
that weekend.

My point was that BECAUSE about a dozen or so events scheduled themselves to
oppose each other, it's going to be damn hard (impossible, actually) to make it
out everywhere I'd like to be; not that I hated any of said crews for throwing
their parties.  Fuck, if anything, we need MORE parties...

... but not ALL at the same time!  It's doubly frusterating, because for the
life of me, I haven't found anything THIS weekend that's worth going to... 
Pride weekend, and the weekend of the 4th are covered... but not much for the
REST of July so far...

I would have thought that the subject line I picked would have indicated that I
was being slightly facetious, as well.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] (NRR) BUSH SUPPORTERS: Still sounds like s&m to  me!

And its for those people that we need to fix our sh!t in this country
before we even pretend to liberate other countries and leave them war
torn from a superpower who came to free them with no ability to fully
help build a proper government.  Especially in countries who are not
used to democracy.  They don't know how to pull it off and most don't
want it pulled off.  Some are happy to be a religiously ruled country,
but need help in overthrowing an extremist religious fanatic or just
plain dictator who says its for the good of the country and abiding by
the religion when just being a downright lying bastard.

The SF protestors broke the law.  And they were arrested.  You just said
you saw no mass arrests, but they happened.

I'm not jaded to the fact that we live in a country that makes it easier
for us to live than the rest of the world.  I know there are people
dying everyday from common illnesses and things that can be treated.  I
know there are still slaves in this world that don't know there's
something better out there.  What does this have 1 iota to do with us
using our constitutional right that other people don't have to complain
about our government becoming a police state?  Its now that we need to
pull our heads out of our asses before we do become like those other
countries.  Build ourselves a model that can work then give it to other
countries.  And if you don't think slaves exist in america.  Head down
to any crack neighborhood where women are enslaved to the rock and their
pimps, with (in their mind) no real way to escape from their current
situation like any slave.  Head over to middle america where there are
tons of middle-lower class white girl puddle sluts who don't have any
respectable family figures to look up to and get addicted to meth by the
first friendly dealer who walks along and has some money and 'saves'
them.  Being a slave and forced to cut a limb off is about the same as
being a slave who must perform sexual favors for their fix and a spot of
cash.  And although they may not be slaves by definition, all the
illegal immigrants who work in fields for slave wages they can't live on
here but in poverty, saving whatever they can to send back for the rest
of their family.  They may be happier than where they came from, but
they are still slaves at the beck and whim of who they work for because
if they do one thing wrong, off to the INS with them.  Probably many
more examples but I have to get back to work.

Thanks for bringing this back to the list.  I was just going to debate
with you and save everyone from back and forth rhetoric, cuz we
obviously don't see things the same and won't agree.

Well, to be honest I guarantee almost no raves will be shut down by the
race act directly including prison time.  Like has already happened, the
DEA is going to show up at high profile events, show the land
owner/promoter/venue owner what they might face and 9/10 of the people
who own the venue will not allow it to happen on their ground on the
basis that just for renting to someone they may face 250k in fines and
20 years in prison.  Its implementation has just been recent and its
first use was to shut down a NORML fundraiser in Montana after the venue
owners were shown what could happen to them if they let the event go off
and someone might be smokin' a joint.  It costs too much to directly
shut down a party, do the arrests, run the court time etc so most laws
are waved in people's faces as an overbearing warning to spook people
into abiding more by the law even if it is wrong.  In Utah they brew
beer at 2.8% alcohol to stay well under the 3.2% alcohol limit.

Rave act:  1 party threatened about its possible consequences shut down
by owners of venue.  So far its got a 1 for 1 success rate.

And if you happened to miss the mass arrests you should've been down by
where I work, where they were bringing them in by the busload down here
by the base of the bay bridge on embarcadero.  I've also read some scary
livejournals from one of my friends who is a teacher and all of a sudden
one of her Iraqi students had disappeared, family turned up missing, all
approx 2 weeks after their father had disappeared misteriously.  Her
responses from other teachers were even scarier as some of them started
realizing it had happened in their classromes as well but they hadn't
put 2 and 2 together.  Do you honestly think the government wants the
publicity of mass public arrests after running our own concentration
camps for the japanese during WWII?

I'll be honest.  I've lived outside of America for the past five years
so I haven't heard much about how the RAVE act is actually being
implemented.  I've read a few news articles and I've heard some first
hand stories but I'm hardly an expert on the subject.  What I don't like
is people and their over emotional hyperbole about what is happening to
America when you have no real idea.  You just assume.  It is a
"perception" that I take issue with.  If you were to support your
opinion with facts, I might agree.  E.g. since the implementation of the
RAVE act, X number of parties were shut down when no drugs were involved
resulting in blah blah blah.  But you don't do that.  You just say that
because the RAVE act was passed it is automatically bad and fascist. All
I heard last year was how the US was becoming a police state because of
Ashcroft's desire to arrest terrorist suspects without legal
representation or rights for them.  I haven't heard of any of these mass
arrests that the left predicted.  In fact, I saw many a peace protestor
doing tons of "subversive" acts during the war and still, no mass
arrests.  I'm a show me guy.  Show me or save your breath.  

It is quite obvious when people are doing drugs other than alcohol at
raves.  You make sure people know you run a clean show and have security
escort the pill heads out the door.  Life isn't as fun when you have to
be responsible and follow the laws of the land is it?

Btw.. this is the Dem underground.  Warning: it is a freak show of lefty
idiots.  http://www.democraticunderground.com/

How does a "rave organizer" make a true effort to keep drugs out of an 
event, Scarlet?  Strip search?:)

In fact, this law is not in the spirit of true conservatism; rather it
is 
an abridgement of first amendment rights.  Civil liberties.  Flinging 
idiotic stereotypical phrases like "democratic underground" (what is
that 
-- democrats meeting in old missile silos?) and misinformed "lefties" to
my 
mind indicates a sixties political mentality.  The Rave Act in its
present 
form was sponsored by "lefty" "underground" Democrats.

Personally, I see that there is not much difference between Islamic 
fundamentalist regimes and the clear direction in which our government
is 
moving:  both wish to create theocratic states that fuse law with
religious 
beliefs;  neither like dancing, or pleasure for its own sake;  both
value 
preserving security and order over freedom.

I'm for freedom.  I believe in the Constitution and the Bill of 
Rights.  What does that make me?  How do you define those who would
trade 
freedom for security and theocratically-based government?

Love,

Apollo

Subject: RE: [sfraves] (NRR) BUSH SUPPORTERS: Still sounds like s&m to  me!

Right back atcha for thinking because I love freedom and oppose
restrictive measures on how I live my life as long as I don't harm
someone, I'm a lefty.  I don't feel any need for added security in this
country because I'm sorry, if Israel can't stop terrorism with an army,
what makes us think we can.  Oh right, by making everyone a terrorist
until proven not and sending the milkman over to your house to gather
intel.  I am not a lefty.  I am not a righty.  Extremism leaves you no
room for new ideas because once you have a structure you can't change
anything without denting, chipping or plain breaking it.

Although I cannot stand Ashcroft, there's one thing I cannot stand even
more.  It's lefties who think that only left is the way to be and it's
all about freedom (this sad and idiotic transposition that happens in
their brain between the words "liberal" and "freedom") and that
conservative somehow equates to restricted freedom and the KKK and so
on. UP yours buddy.

DEA Uses RAVE Act to Shut Down Fundraiser
Posted by 033 on 10.06.2003 @ 23:11
Only two months after the RAVE Act was passed by Congress it has been 
used by the federal Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to intimidate 
the owners of a Billings, Montana, venue into canceling a combined 
benefit for the Montana chapter of the National Organization for the 
Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) and Students for Sensible Drug Policy 
(SSDP).

On the day the fundraiser was set to take place a Billings-based DEA 
agent presented the venue owners with a copy of the RAVE Act warning 
them that they could face a fine of $250,000 if illicit drugs were 
found in the premises. Rather than risk the fines, they decided to shut 
the event down.

Also Popsicle had 150 undercovers. If they didn't comply, they'd 
probably cite the RAVE Act. There are more massives that will be the 
same. It will turn our parties into a police state.

the thing i cannot stand the most is dogma.  there is certainly some
evidence that the CIA may have helped organize and finance the baathist
coup in iraq in 1963, and certainly that the US supported iraq in the
80's.  does this mean that  "the US was responsible for saddam's rise to
power?" no.  does this mean the argument stops there?  no.  the truth is
somewhere in the middle of all these clashing dogmas, and we can never
really know for certain what is the most "important" fact or which news
source to believe when they contradict each other.  noam chomsky is no
more 100% correct than rush limbaugh...  

ever hear the one about "arguing on the internet is like running in the
special olympics..."?

this right/left thing is a big scam.  the world is not that simple.

Subject: No one has convinced me yet that being a raver & a Bushite is not s&m

   See what I tell you? They start to loose it and desegregate into name
calling. They're like paper, they burn intensely at first, but because
there is no real fuel to sustain them (their argument), they burn out
fast. So the resorting to name calling, which is verbal violence, the
need and means to bring the "opponent" down, the need to "win", not to
dialogue and have a open mind. That means accepting perhaps the "lefties"
are right this time (and believe it or not, I disagree with the left on
things) and that Bush really is a pathological/socialpath (being brain
dead to empathy) liar and is using his presidency to give his corporate
cronies the opportunity to clean this country out of it's wealth. Hell
no! I will not listen! This is about winning, not dialoguing and
learning. 
  What are they winning? It's about defending something, the archetype
Bush represents, the nostalgia of the dayz of str8 white male domination,
the days of "traditional" white male supremist patriarchy, and the
defence of the social, religious, cultural, and military institutions
that facilitate str8 white male supremacy. It's the archetype Bush
represents of the good 'ole days when men ruled the house with a iron
fist, where the man went to work and "earned" his living, like life is
something you earn, the man ate pussy and men didn't turn into a fag and
his women stayed home and kept his castle clean and took care of his
physical comforts. Children were property and a man could "discipline"
his children, even his disobedient wife without the government intruding
on his rights. It's the archetype Bush represents of pre 1880, before
unions, minimum wages, 40 hour weeks, overtime pay, PTO's, pensions,
unemployment insurance, health insurance, OCSHA, laws against
discrimination and harassment,  all these and other
social/political/sexual benefits we all enjoy today, brought to you by
the blood and lives of "lefties" battling the ones the Bushites adore and
would love to go back in time to,  those good 'ole dayz,  where employers
were the king of their business and government stayed out of his kingdom.
It's the archetype Bush represents when "Christian" values were the law
of the land (Comstock laws regarding sex as an example), before Rhode vs
Wade and birth control, the 1964 voters rights, before gay rights, women
rights, before Madeline O'hair won the right to not have her son
subjected to Christian indoctrination in a public school, before
nonsectarian/moral based sex education and cultural diversity. What are
they desperate to "win" is the battle against those who would be
audacious enough to challenge the superstition that center of the
universe is made up of the mass of str8, white, male, rich, drug free and
(fundamentalist) Christian people and that everything else revolves
around them. This is a serious battle for them, family values, government
intrusion into their lives, but not in those who they oppose,  the
homosexual agenda, partial birth abortion (the most rare of abortion
procedures done only when the mother's life is in danger), and so forth,
are their mortal enemies and has to be brought down any way they can, not
because it's false, but because it challenges the dominating paradigm. So
the closing of the mind begins and name calling forthwith when they start
to pitter out and can't win the debate technique.
  Secondly, I don't give Bushites power to define me. If I'm to call
myself a so called "liberal" or "progressive", I'm the one who takes that
label on me, I will not have it placed on me, like a dirty word, by those
who support a Bush/corporatearcy America. I will not let them get away of
labeling anti-Bushites as liberals and unpatriotic. This isn't about
being left or right, this is about defending democracy and freedom,
rights Bush and company finds as a barrier to going back to those "good
'ole dayz". 
  Why bring this on the list? Because if democracy and freedom hangs on
Bush's gallows, we all, ravers included will hang together! What bush is
doing is VERY rave related. No one has convinced me yet that being a
raver and a bushite isn't a form of s&m.
  Peace, Bodhi ^ _ ^

Both requests are unreasonable!  Give me a break!

Subject: Pearls of Wisdom from the Authors of Last Night a DJ Saved My Life
 (the book silly)


A Quick Blurb from the BBC site...
( http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/dance/reviews/brewster_howtodj.shtml )

'How to DJ (Properly)' has become the bible for anyone wanting to improve
their DJing skills.

So, when co-author Bill Brewster offered to help judge out DJ at
Glastonbury competition we also got him to run down his top ten dos and
don'ts of DJing. Here they are:

DO...
1. Have fun
Everybody is a bloody DJ now and most of them are boring. Don't join them.
Be interesting, take chances and, moreover, enjoy yourself. It's supposed
to be fun, you know.

2. Throw your own parties
Sending tapes to superclubs and waiting to be discovered stopped working
years ago. All the veteran DJs started with their own parties. You should,
too. Forget flyers and trying to get features in DJmag. Invite your mates
down. Persuade any girls and gay friends you might have to join you.
They're the ones that get people on the dancefloor.

3. Play older records
Don't just limit yourself to the latest white labels and promos. There's a
world of recorded music out there at your disposal. It's as much fun
introducing an audience to a great old record as it is the latest upfront
test pressing.

4. Get out of your bedroom as soon as you can
Play at your mum's birthday, your mate's barbecue, the local boozer on a
Sunday afternoon, anywhere theres real people. You'll learn more in two
hours than a whole year locked in your room. A word of warning, though:
leave the drum'n'bass at home for your mum's birthday.

5. Take risks
Seamlessly mixing everything is cool, but it leaves no room for chances or
those truly memorable moments that people remember. Try things that could
possibly go wrong, because if they go right they'll be amazing. No-one
will lose an eye or die if you make a few mistakes.

6. Listen to older DJs
They might be grizzled old acid house bores, but they've also got the
tunes and the experience.

7. Be a collector
Don't just confine yourself to getting promos from Black Market or 3 Beat.
A DJ's real work never stops. Whether you're digging in second hand shops
or simply walking past a charity shop, there's never a time when you don't
think about digging out new and fantastic music.

8. Embrace technology
There's more to DJing than sniffing vinyl 24 hours a day. We're constantly
amazed at well-established DJs who are still fannying about with acetates
and vinyl only when CD-Rs and laptops are opening up new possibilities for
DJs.

9. Learn how to warm-up
Not just the peak-hour. No-one wants to arrive in a club at 10.30pm and be
blasted out of the bar by the hard and fast stuff you've spent three years
perfecting. Ease us in gently, please.

10. Buy our book
Available from all good bookstores (and a few crap ones, too).

DON'T...
1. Worry about perfect mixes
Most young DJs think mixing is the most important aspect of a DJ, when in
fact it's about 10% of the skills required. Yes, it's great that you can
mix two records together or scratch, but pay attention to other things,
too. Having great music and choosing the right tune for the right moment
is much more important.

2. Copy anyone
Having influences is fine - even recommended, we all need someone to
inspire us - but you won't get far if you don't express yourself and try
to be unique. People should know it's you playing, just by the records
you're playing.

3. Get an ego
The best DJs imagine they're down on the dancefloor partying with everyone
else, not hanging out with P Diddy in the enclosed area at Space.

4. Plan a set
DJing is about improvising, about sensing the atmosphere and choosing the
most perfect record for the moment. Don't ever think you can work it all
out beforehand. You're not designing a building, you're trying to capture
individual moments throughout the evening.

5. Stick to one genre
Does anyone really want to listen to 5 hours of gabber?

6. Keep your head down
Look at the dancefloor. Go on, it's not that hard.

7. Obsess about getting on to mailing lists
Lots of the records you'll get sent are crap anyway. Find your own gems.

8. Pay to play
Ignore any ads offering to get you gigs if you send them money. They will
rip you off.

9. Mither about the world not being fair when you can't get a gig
Get out there, be positive, make things happen. Throw your own parties
(see Do #2)!

10. Forget to invite us to your next party
We're handsome, fun and know lots of good-looking girls.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] (NRR) BUSH SUPPORTERS: Still sounds like s&m to  me!

See, that's the problem with your attitude.  Your attitude is dogmatic in
the extreme....
if you don't think like me you must not love freedom and if you don't love
freedom
you must be a republican, etc.  You don't even see the catch-22 you place
anyone who
is *not* a democrat in?  Of course you don't.

Would you care to guestimate how many Israeli's have died in the past 3
years due to
terrorism as oppossed to how many Americans in the past 3 years?  Please,
give it a shot.
You may not feel as if any added security is needed, I do.  Does this mean I
agree with
Ashcroft?  No, although as a lefty if i'm not *with you* I *must* be with
Ashcroft....oh well.

So you're dead in the middle and that can't be leaving you no room for new
ideas, right?  Same
thing.  Don't make the mistake of mapping out left and right like it's a
ruler and there's some
special place on it that makes you right or more right.  Half of what can be
good about anything
in the spectrum is a decision by the person at any given point to do good.
Most of what's wrong
is that the majority at any given point wont do good.

sell any chemicals or helicopters to Saddam with the intent that he'd murder
anyone.
There are things that aren't open to debate, and I wish both the left and
right would
get out of their dogma and put down the cliche banners.  Unfortunately, no
one is
interested in the truth (or a close approximation)...they're interested in
their view being
right and will purport anything as fact that supports that view.

What name calling?  I haven't called anyone a name...yet.  Talk about
typical.  Do something
intentional knowing what response it will generate and then say "see, told
ya how they are!"
I responded to one particular point of his post and I made my point.  If i'd
have intended to reply
to all his points I would have, so don't go second guessing my intentions.
Your entire post is
nothing but a right/republican/bush bash, it's exactly the same crap i was
talking about.  It's exactly
what you claim is being done to the left/dems/etc.  I was trying to put a
spoke in the wheel, you're
just trying to keep it spinning while at the same time complaining about the
spin.  Spin ya later

you know, now I remember why I signed off the sfraves mailing list a few 
months ago. I got tired of hearing about politics, in place of actual 
rave events.
I've recieved 58 emails today, of which, I think maybe 10-15 were 
actually rave-related.
Cmon guys, Quit bitching about it, and DO something. Wasting your time 
bitching doesn't solve shit. Call your congressman, fax them, email them.
TELL THEM, NOT US!!! PREACHING TO CHOIR!!! They don't read rave mailing 
lists (that's the DEA's job :) ).

oh, and one more thing. Tom Daschle (D, South Dakota) reintroduced the

Speak among yourselves :)

Yay! I haven't written a poem in about 10 years!
Last weeks were good!
I'm Going to try to write one but I would like to share with you 
THE WORST POEM EVER!
 
razorblade, razorblade,
shiny and new,
I say one last prayer,
before I join you.
 
Ok, before you get mad at me for being an insensitive cretin for finding this funny, let me assure you that this poem was written in 1989, by someone at my high school, and they are FINE now ( I checked on classmates.com) , it was just normal teenage melodrama, and horrible horrible poetry. In fact, I bet they forgot they even wrote it! I on the other hand am cursed with this dreadful rhyme FOREVER! And yes, I CAN do better! (at least I could back then) I won "Best Poet" honors in my senior class, so yes, I can write better bad poetry!

 I really disagree, it's VRR (very rave related).  As much as we like to
shut that world out and be nihilistic and narcissistic and pretend that
we can dance the reality of our demise away, the larger world beyond
raves (controlled mostly by the Bushites) is crashing in on our party and
wants to brutally enforce it's fun repression on us. Bush being the man's
man, the man that gives American men goose bumps under their hairy chest,
goddamn!!!!  You gotta love that macho copilot entree to make a speech!
The man who makes Republican women's vagina juicy again, the man who
every Log Cabin Republican wants give him head and get fucked by him.
He's the man alright, and to mess with Bush is to mess with 100% American
manhood. But despite his manly sex appeal, he still is an enemy not only
of freedom and democracy, but the right to dance. Yes, a lot of Democrats
are just as guilty, fascism is fascism, both from the left and the right.
But right now, Bush who represents right wing fascism is the one who is
in power now. He's the one leading the charge to criminalize not only
dancing, but freedom and democracy. If he was a Democrat, I'd still speak
up against him. We are dealing with a President who makes Nixon such a
lovable Quaker!
  The punk knew what was up with authority long ago and understood the
value of politics. Dr. Martin Luther King was criticalized by many of his
on people for bringing up politics in the pulpit. "The church is for
spiritual things and politics is NCR" (non church related). But he knew
that what was keeping his people down wasn't that they didn't pray enough
and didn't meekly accept enough, as taking up one's own cross, 3rd class
citizenship in hopes that one day God would answer their prayers and that
the Holy Ghost would descend and upon the George Wallace, Turbans and
Jesse Helms of America and inspire them to take Christian pity on the
"colored people" and give them St class citizenship too. He understood it
was very political, and it meant that the church needed to get off it's
knees and come out of the safety of the church (so they thought until a
church was bombed In Birmingham in '64 by primitive Bushites) and self
righteousness and do some acts of civil disobedience and calling Creaser
by his true name, and this being as spiritual as Friday night prayer
meetings. 
  The hip hop scene is now beginning to discover that you can't hide in
your scene anymore and hope the fun police would ignore you and leave you
alone. The hip hop scene is beginning to realize that politics is a
necessary survival tool in Bush's world that wants to demonize you,
criminal you and put you down, like a real man would. Gotta protect
children, women, the white race, manhood and American values from the
scourge of raving, ganja, sexual pleasure, queer love, alternative
families, tolerance and other people's culture. Hell no, this isn't about
dogma, come on now!!!! It's about freedom a
  O.K... he's not exactly a friend of ravers, punks and hip hoppers and
such minded people. Why don't I just keep it as that? Why do I bring all
the war stuff and his economic policies in the discussion about the right
to dance? Because it shows the kind of man we are dealing with and his
lying and placating good people's patriotism to get us to support his
Iraqi conquest reveals his true character. If we can't trust him to tell
the truth, how can we trust him to protect our right to dance? A man who
will steal from the poor to give to the rich is not a friend to ravers. 
A man who will not think twice about killing thousands of Iraqis and
American soldiers to get the oil for his oil buddies down there in Texas
would not think twice about putting DJ's, promoters and venue owners in
prison for 20 years. How am I to admire a man like that?  I don't think
he's even sexy. I like men, not brutal socialpaths. I think he's too much
of a psycho cowboy for me to consider him a role model of manhood and a
masterbation fantasy! 
  When is the rave scene going to wake up and get political too? It's
almost like trying to wake up someone in a coma. No one want's to leave
the distractions of Disney Land, but you got to face the real world
sooner or latter. The rave scene is in a deep coma of self absorption and
a  "I don't care" attitude, and while everybody else is in the streets
trying to protect their rights, the rave obliviously goes on! Ravers are
not coming to grips to the fact that 20 year prison sentences for raving
are not far away, and yes, all American male Bush is the grand puba of it
all!  Yes, it's VRR! Our right to dance depends on it being VRR!
  Peace, Bodhi ^ _ ^

understand what people are refering to when they describe views as being "left" or 
"right". I'd like to take a moment to explain how I see it and perhaps some of you 
will agree with or correct me. 
     To me, the Right wing of the U.S. seems to be proud of itself and where 
it stands. It sees itself as heroic and of course patriotic. This is the more 
common view of Americans. It is also a common view of non-americans who live 
in other countries or have just migrated here recently. When I talk to 
forenigners about what they think of America, they usually say things about how 
greatful they are and how much better it is here than in their country. How greatful 
they are of our nation to have given them a chance to live a better life. 
     The Left wing, on the other hand (no pun intended!) is very hard on 
itself. It likes to bring up the contraversial and sensative things from the past 
that people just don't want to talk or hear about anymore. It points out it's 
own open cuts and makes itself seem very vulnerable, where the right wings 
like to cover it's tracks and move on. 
     Think of a conservative family sitting around the dinner table having a 
conversation about how great their family is, when little johnny inturupts by 
saying... "I remember one time grandpa boxed my ears because I wouldn't eat my 
brocoli" That kid's a lefty! You see, it may be true, but you just didn't 
want to hear it now did you? The left wing can be sensative, and yet insensative, 
It's insightful and yet it's naive. It seems at first to be jumping to 
conclusions and making false accusations... and yet years later you may realize what 
was said just might be "right" afterall.
     Now I think this Right and Left wing analogy can be related to the right 
and left brain, and also right and left handed people. But actually it's 
confusing because lefty's use the right brain and righty's use the left brain, 
prodominantly. But since the right handed out-number the left handed 10 to 1 in 
population, you will never have any equality in that perspective. 
     Subconciously, right handed people may look to the right wing more 
favorably at first glance, subconciously making that connection of "rightness" that 
is so deeply grooved into their brain. I bet you, that in a survey you may 
find that a large number of left handed people, also consider themselves 
"left-wing" and unfortunately this may be due to a subconcious preference, more so 
than side by side research, pro and con evaluation of the two wings carefully 
deciding which "side" you want to support. Most people, I bet you, do not 
research open mindedly in this mannor, they just blindly support one side or the 
other, based on what is probably a child-hood preference of using your right or 
left hand... or you could be right handed but chose to be different in spite of 
conformity and prefer the left or vise versa. 
     In history Lefties (meaning lefted handed people) were at first looked 
at as disadvantaged. untensils, tools, cars and even desks at school were not 
designed for them to use, and so most of them would have to convert (conform) 
to being right handed, like everyone else. The left hand was even associated 
with the Devil and it was said that Jesus always used his right hand. But in 
more recent history people started to realize that lefties had certian abilities 
that were superior to righties, such as in sports. Notice while 1 in 10 is 
left handed in overall population, nearly half of baseball today is lefties 
including a lot of the all time greats. i.e. Babe Ruth, Bary Bonds, Randy Johnson, 
Ted Williams etc. 
     Nowadays, left has established itself as not disadvantaged but actually 
gifted in some ways. It's sort of symbolically shows that one can defy the 
odds and still come out on top. The left is sort of this "underdog" 
...underground, against the tide, state of mind. It is no longer about being left or right 
handed though. It's about taking the side of the one who is against the odds. 
Hence you will hear a lot of people refer to things as "radical left-wing 
politics" where as what you might think of right wing politics is just simply 
called "politics" with no reference to a "wing". And you will hear the term 
"left-wing nut" much more often then the term "right-wing nut". 
     It seems obvious still, the left, is associated with radicalness, 
creativity, and a naive faith that society is safe without conservative law 
enforcement. For some reason it seems the liberals, environmentalists, hippies and 
most other American sub-cultures have been catagorized into the left side of the 
evolutionary branch of politics. While the Military, Police, and up-standing 
citizens such as doctors, lawyers, and millionare's are catagorized on the 
right. While I suppose the average population is somewhere in the middle and must 
chose for themselves. 
     All this, of course, is just non-sense and we are all just people 
afterall, but while we're slinging these words around such "left" and "right" I like 
to try and find some clarity on what people actually mean by this. 
     I think we can all agree that one wing can not be right or wrong nor 
better or worse. It takes two wings to fly, respectively, and what we should be 
working towards is an <A HREF="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?r=2&q=ambidextrous">ambidextrous</A> America!

i dont think very many crews schedule their events to oppose other crews (it
happens, but very rarely)... and in this situation, i highly doubt they
actually scheduled their events in opposition of the others; it probably
just turned out that way...

Newsbrief: RAVE Act Reverberations

In the wake of the cancellation of a Montana NORML/SSDP benefit by the 
venue's owners after a DEA agent warned them they could face a $250,000 
fine under the RAVE Act if anyone used marijuana at the event 
(http://www.drcnet.org/wol/290.shtml#dearave), organizers of some drug 
reform-related events have begun to cancel events or relocate them to 
friendlier territory. At the same time, national drug reform and civil 
liberties organizations are mobilizing against the RAVE Act, now officially 
known as the Illicit Drug Anti-Proliferation Act.

The Sonoma Health and Harmony Festival (http://www.harmonyfestival.com) in 
California has cancelled plans to have a medical marijuana smoking area due 
to fears of RAVE Act prosecutions, California NORML has reported. And the 
Wisconsin Weedstock festival (http://www.weedstock.com) is relocating 
across the border to Canada -- to Sault, Ontario, where there currently are 
no laws against marijuana possession, let alone anything like the RAVE Act. 
Weedstock will become part of the Planetary Pride Hemp Fest 
(http://www.planetarypride.com/comingsoon.html), an Ontario-based event now 
in its fifth year.

(US citizens thinking of attending but who have an arrest record should 
make sure they can get into Canada. Visit 
http://www.ccra-adrc.gc.ca/customs/individuals/visitors-e.html and go to 
the Citizenship and Immigration Canada's web pages to get more information 
about entry.)

As some groups change plans under RAVE Act prosecution pressures, the drug 
reform movement is mobilizing to roll back the law, which was stalled under 
stiff opposition in the Senate last year, but which passed easily once it 
was stealthily inserted into the popular Amber Alert by RAVE Act sponsor 
Sen. Joe Biden (D-DE). Drug Policy Alliance has made repealing the RAVE Act 
one of its action priorities (http://actioncenter.drugpolicy.org/action/), 
and other major reform and civil liberties groups continue to plot 
strategies to kill the law.

"Security is mostly a superstition.  It does not exist in nature, nor do 
the children of humans as a whole experience it.  Avoiding danger is no 
safer in the long run than outright exposure.  Life is either a daring 
adventure or nothing."
-Helen Keller

"Compassion is not a relationship between the healer and the wounded.  It's 
a relationship between equals.  Only when we know our own darkness well can 
we be present with the darkness of others.  Compassion becomes real when we 
recognize our shared humanity."
-Pema Chodron

"Americans have, for the most part, been exempt from the genuine tragedy of 
war and, as a consequence, seem more ready to accept their myths about war. 
They have never endured the reality against which other nations readily 
measure the cost of combat. And this makes us a very dangerous people. "

No way am I going to repost any of this!
Somebody hurry up and call somebody a NAZI so this will stop!
(OK, for those of you unfamiliar with the "Nazi" rule, it is one of the oldest and most sacred rules on the Internet: as soon as one side calls the other a "Nazi" or Hitler, the side looses. some variations of this rule go as far to say as soon as the word Nazi is posted, the thread is dead. I AM INVOKING "THE NAZI RULE!" not because i think anyone is a Nazi, but this HAS TO STOP NOW.) Let us celebrate the end of this thread by resuming to talk about such important topics as rave goo, candy, fat beats, and parties that "were off DA hook" don't get me wrong, Like any social movement,  politics has its place in raving, but resorting to name calling isn't getting anyone anywhere.

  Let's try it again, it's VRR! Not to be insulting to anyone, but we
need to get out of our e-puddles and get with reality. I know I say
things, that I will stand by, in a deliberately provocative way. I say
what I say about Bush, "American" values, manhood and the war to get
people pissed off. I can't think of any other way to jump start people's
brains that have been dumbed down by our government and the corporate
media. I  want people to relearn critical thinking skills and to not feel
unpatriotic if you question authority, that's democracy, not regurgitate
the "official" line, that's tyranny, and hopefully, as I piss people off
and they are on the warpath to shut me up, that will get people off their
cyber asses, do the work and find out themselves that Bush is not a
conservative, but a neo fascist, and yes it's effecting the right to
dance. 
  I'm not asking people to accept everything I say. I don't know
everything, I'm as dumb as everybody else. But I can tell the difference
between democracy and fascism, and as we say in the ghetto a player from
someone who keeps it real.
  The point that I am making is why is all this Bush stuff VRR? Because
his actions are of a man who is a fascist, and raves, like everything
else that will suffer under fascism, will terribly suffer. If a man will
drop 18,000 bombs on Iraq and kill god knows how many civilians (The US
refuses to do a civilian body count, do you smell something rotten here?)
to get to the oil, what will this man do to, not only the rave community,
but to every music culture? Everyone else is getting it, why are ravers
still a day late and a dollar short on this? Many refuse to see the
connection between him pillaging the country of it's wealth and the right
to dance because many of us do like what he's doing.
  Peace, Bodhi ^ _ ^

I ate a bagel with cream cheese 20 min. ago.  It was very good.  Later I
might call the landscaper a Nazi for no other reason than he
has a leaf blower, and if Hitler were alive today he would find a way to
make leaf blowers the most destructive weapon known to
humanity.

oldest and most sacred rules on the Internet: as soon as one side calls the
other a "Nazi" or Hitler, the side looses. some variations of this rule go
as far to say as soon as the word Nazi is posted, the thread is dead. I AM
INVOKING "THE NAZI RULE!" not because i think anyone is a Nazi, but this HAS
TO STOP NOW.) Let us celebrate the end of this thread by resuming to talk
about such important topics as rave goo, candy, fat beats, and parties that
"were off DA hook" don't get me wrong, Like any social movement,  politics
has its place in raving, but resorting to name calling isn't getting anyone
anywhere.

bodhi, please.  read what you just wrote.  nothing to do with
music, dancing, DJing, etc.  now say, for example, you were
taliking about the rave act and started bashing right-wingers,
i can see that being somewhat rave-related.

but dude, seriously.  you're old enough.  this stuff is NRR. 
tie it in with the dance community, with throwing parties in
general, with the high price of imports, whatever.  but i don't
see anything that has to do with EDM within your post.

take it to a political forum.  yes, it's scary that kids these
days are more right-wing than ever.  but IT IS STILL NRR.

  Prove to me Bush is not  fascist and I will shut up. Prove to me that
fascism won't effect the rave scene and you won't ever hear a peep from
me again about the subject. I'm not one of the masses that goes to
parties just to get way fucked up on drugs and get light shows all night
long. I actualy love electronic music and what raving is all about, a lot
more than about rave goo, phat beats and parties that were off da hook. I
love my right to dance, and people don't seem to get it that rave goo,
phat beats are about to be supressed and that parties that were off da
hook are about to get you 20 years in prision. Who's the Grand Puba of
all of this? I don't sound too Buddhist, but if I have to slap people in
thie faces (figuratively) to get the rave scene out of it's complacency
and lethargy, then I have done a very compassionate act. Censorship won't
stop the truth.
  Danny Picard and Apollo are getting it, why arn't you?

Hi All,
Have you guys/gals read "Last Night a DJ Saved My Life?"  I would strongly recommend it to anyone interested in the history of the 'DJ.'
This book discusses a myriad of genres from Northern Soul to disco to modern techno.  
There's a really cool section that covers all-night ballroom dances that date back to the 30's.
Well, without getting too far into it, I'll just say it's a great read.  
Regards,
chuck

A Quick Blurb from the BBC site...
( http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/dance/reviews/brewster_howtodj.shtml )

'How to DJ (Properly)' has become the bible for anyone wanting to improve
their DJing skills.

So, when co-author Bill Brewster offered to help judge out DJ at
Glastonbury competition we also got him to run down his top ten dos and
don'ts of DJing. Here they are:

DO...
1. Have fun
Everybody is a bloody DJ now and most of them are boring. Don't join them.
Be interesting, take chances and, moreover, enjoy yourself. It's supposed
to be fun, you know.

2. Throw your own parties
Sending tapes to superclubs and waiting to be discovered stopped working
years ago. All the veteran DJs started with their own parties. You should,
too. Forget flyers and trying to get features in DJmag. Invite your mates
down. Persuade any girls and gay friends you might have to join you.
They're the ones that get people on the dancefloor.

3. Play older records
Don't just limit yourself to the latest white labels and promos. There's a
world of recorded music out there at your disposal. It's as much fun
introducing an audience to a great old record as it is the latest upfront
test pressing.

4. Get out of your bedroom as soon as you can
Play at your mum's birthday, your mate's barbecue, the local boozer on a
Sunday afternoon, anywhere theres real people. You'll learn more in two
hours than a whole year locked in your room. A word of warning, though:
leave the drum'n'bass at home for your mum's birthday.

5. Take risks
Seamlessly mixing everything is cool, but it leaves no room for chances or
those truly memorable moments that people remember. Try things that could
possibly go wrong, because if they go right they'll be amazing. No-one
will lose an eye or die if you make a few mistakes.

6. Listen to older DJs
They might be grizzled old acid house bores, but they've also got the
tunes and the experience.

7. Be a collector
Don't just confine yourself to getting promos from Black Market or 3 Beat.
A DJ's real work never stops. Whether you're digging in second hand shops
or simply walking past a charity shop, there's never a time when you don't
think about digging out new and fantastic music.

8. Embrace technology
There's more to DJing than sniffing vinyl 24 hours a day. We're constantly
amazed at well-established DJs who are still fannying about with acetates
and vinyl only when CD-Rs and laptops are opening up new possibilities for
DJs.

9. Learn how to warm-up
Not just the peak-hour. No-one wants to arrive in a club at 10.30pm and be
blasted out of the bar by the hard and fast stuff you've spent three years
perfecting. Ease us in gently, please.

10. Buy our book
Available from all good bookstores (and a few crap ones, too).

DON'T...
1. Worry about perfect mixes
Most young DJs think mixing is the most important aspect of a DJ, when in
fact it's about 10% of the skills required. Yes, it's great that you can
mix two records together or scratch, but pay attention to other things,
too. Having great music and choosing the right tune for the right moment
is much more important.

2. Copy anyone
Having influences is fine - even recommended, we all need someone to
inspire us - but you won't get far if you don't express yourself and try
to be unique. People should know it's you playing, just by the records
you're playing.

3. Get an ego
The best DJs imagine they're down on the dancefloor partying with everyone
else, not hanging out with P Diddy in the enclosed area at Space.

4. Plan a set
DJing is about improvising, about sensing the atmosphere and choosing the
most perfect record for the moment. Don't ever think you can work it all
out beforehand. You're not designing a building, you're trying to capture
individual moments throughout the evening.

5. Stick to one genre
Does anyone really want to listen to 5 hours of gabber?

6. Keep your head down
Look at the dancefloor. Go on, it's not that hard.

7. Obsess about getting on to mailing lists
Lots of the records you'll get sent are crap anyway. Find your own gems.

8. Pay to play
Ignore any ads offering to get you gigs if you send them money. They will
rip you off.

9. Mither about the world not being fair when you can't get a gig
Get out there, be positive, make things happen. Throw your own parties
(see Do #2)!

10. Forget to invite us to your next party
We're handsome, fun and know lots of good-looking girls.

Subject: (bsp) (fwd) Detroit - Sunday Night at Skylark

From: Woodward Posse <woodwardposse@yahoo.com>
Date:  Fri, 20 Jun 2003 15:13:25 -0700 (PDT)


hello again friends-

I'm very excited to continue this ritual weekly plug for the Sunday night we've been doing for a month and some weeks now. The uniquely cohesive soundclash that our "Detroit" night pulls off has been a blast and the word is steadily getting out to the people. Now, with amazing flyers courtesy of Joe Encarnacion, there'll be more of "those who know" and plenty that are rightly curious. (if you'd like to see the flyers yourself, keep a sharp eye out at your favorite clubs and record stores- otherwise pretty soon you'll   have to buy them on Ebay!) 

This   Sunday, as always, we will feature a hot mix of Detroit and Detroit-esque sonic pleasures ranging from Motown to Techno, Hip hop to garage rock, jazz, electro, soul and as always for the nutters (cuz Monday morning is still hours away!) ghetto tech. 

The party starts at 9 this Sunday night, June 22, at the Skylark, 3089 16st., San   Francisco. This weeks featured DJ's are Baby Daddy (Rob Goppold) and 12 Mile (Brian Stein).

thanks - The Woodward Posse

Subject: RE: [sfraves] what's the point of having hair? nrr

As a male who has had every style of hair from shaved to halfway down my
back to mohawk to bowl to whatever... I will say one thing about the
purpose of hair.  And anyone who has not had hair down to their
shoulders is missing out.  To me there's not much greater than long hair
blowing in the wind and tickling the back of the neck.  Its instant
stress relaxation as each little strand gently brushes against your
skin, exciting the hairs and tricking you into thinking you're getting a
massage.  About the only people I can't see liking this are those who
like stress more than being relaxed and people with fybromalgia (sp?)
After chopping all my hair off about 4 years ago I didn't realize how
much I missed it until I started growing it back out again.  Now I don't
think I'll ever cut it back above my shoulders, (although its not there
yet but getting there.)

Oh, and of course for someone else to run their hands through and/or
twirl. :)

what is the point of having hair if it is always having to be either:
 
A. trimmed    OR
 
B. pulled back tight  OR
 
C. shaved    OR
 
D. clipped? what's the point? :) :) :) :) :) i can't wait till
christmas. its' not like the weather is going to be any colder. after
you get to a certain point, it all feels like below zero anyway and you
have to keep wearing the same damned stuff with the same damned

It's all about having long hair, and playing at a really sweaty rave, and
taking off your headphones, and having them get tangled up in your hair.
This happened more than once by the time I decided to de-hippie myself.

Ok, so maybe the headphones thing can be a hassle (that and brushing my 
hair out of my face constantly while looking down on the decks) but 
there's nothing more relieving than being in a hot sweaty one, then 
stepping outside for a minute and letting some cold-ass wind blow 
through that hair. Nothing short of miraculous, i tell ya :)

sometimes, you might walk on a kitty litter grain with your bare foot, and OUCH! that was kind of uncomfortable, but then, just when you thought it was over, you take two steps and OUCH, there are two more kitty litter grains...one in the center of your foot and one on the heel. :)

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Damn, I love having long hair, I was a short hair person my whole life until a student hairdresser went to far and i stopped cutting it. It's too hot to wear it down at raves though. So its all about pigtails, when I first started raving I did a princess leia thing, now I do pigtails or braids, it was great one time this drunk kid in berzerklly fell in love with me cause i looked like princess leia, but my husband said it was only sexy in the ironic sence, so i stopped, it also took forever. I want to learn how to do french pigtails, but cant seem to get it. The best part about being a girl with long hair at psytrance parties in particular is the stuff you can stick in there, i have signature blacklight reactive mushrooms, and I usally put some flowers in too. I have some pipe cleaners that glow in blacklight, and I have these Giant Sparkly Balls I got for 50 cents at Big LOts! I knew i had struck candy kid gold when a 4 year old comlimented me on my pigtails. God I love hair deelies
 so much, like if i have a choice between spending $20 on a pill and buying 15 packages of hair deelies, its a no brainer... Hair deelies win.

Subject: Sunset Party on Sunday: roll call & traffic question

Hey everyone,
Who is going to the SUNSET Summer Solstice Celebration (outdoor day =
party) on Sunday in Marin county? They always have a good groove going. =
I've only been once, back in 2001, but it was so much fun that I thought =
I would check out this one, and I want to hear Galen & Solar spin. They =
were great at the SFraves 10-year party in McLaren park last year.

Anyway, I heard on the news that hundreds of thousands of NASCAR racing =
fans would be hitting the roads in North Bay on Sunday, so now I am =
wondering about traffic patterns. I sure don't want to be caught in a =
bottleneck on Sunday.=20

Does anyone have any advice (esp. if you live up in Marin Cty). 101 =
North is supposed to be pretty bad tomorrow. Just where the hell is =
Sears Point (the Infineon Raceway)? Do you think this will really cause =
a problem for the trip to and from Novato? I live in the East Bay. I =
guess I should avoid Highways 37 or 121, like they said on the news, but =
doesn't 101 go near those roads? I guess I better dig out my Bay Area =
map.

Thanks,
Greg

If you take the richmond bridge from the east bay to 101 north to Novato you 
should be able to miss most of the traffic from sears point.  don't go on 37 
if you want to get to the party before dark, Nascar traffic is Hell!

Subject: SRR:  Free Cash for "Hipster" Parties

--=====================_17792045==.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

I had hoped to go to the Sunset party this afternoon, but my partner came 
down with a serious infection.  So instead I spent this morning reading the 
New York Times.  In the NRT Magazine I came across an article by Rob Walker 
of "Slate" titled "The Marketing of No Marketing."

There are many theories about capturing the "souls" of today's cool, 
anit-establishment youth through various marketing techniques.  One can 
hire hip kids, give them a new product, and have them show up at trendoid 
events "undercover" as it were.  They alert their friends to the new deal 
in self-validation, and away you go:  viral marketing.

Then there's "organic" marketing or Plan B, as Alex Wipperfurth (with an 
umlaut) of SF's youth marketing firm "Plan B" calls this tactic.  Take a 
dying, underdog brand, and facilitate its acceptance by "lifestyle as 
dissent" constituencies who view consumption as protest.  These people are 
all about, as Alex says, "freedom and rejecting middle-class mores."

Yes.

So we have Pabst Blue Ribbon beer.  My dad used to drink the stuff.  I 
thought they went out of business years ago.  But lo and behold, Pabst, or 
"PBR," recently appeared in the "Hipster's Handbook" and has been adopted 
by hipsters in trendy bars from the Mission District here to the Lower East 
Side in NYC.

Portland, that bastion of the alternative, is sucking this "retro-chic" 
liquid down the pierced gullets.  As 28-year-old Phil Barnes, who just had 
a PBR logo burned into his back says:  "Pabst is part of my 
subculture.  It's the only beer I think about."  Phil is a skate-boarder 
and punk rocker.

Good to see people with passionate beliefs.

Me...I guess I'm tragically unhip these days.  Without a consumer belief 
system. You see, I still wear cargo pants.  Wore them before they became 
trendy and wear them now, even though a couple of years ago --  it seemed 
to happen over night -- all my hip friends started to wear denim jeans.  I 
just couldn't part with all the pockets for cigs, weed, CDs and the 
like.  So uncool.  So no one is approaching me with organic marketing.

But Liquid Marketing from Chicago is seeking reps who live uber cool 
locales and know the hipsters at the local tattoo parlors and record 
stores.  These organic marketing reps have cash.  For the right hipsters.

Recently PBR funded a day party for cigarette-smoking, 
testosterone-charged, tattooed, pierced bike messengers in 
Portland.  $1,750.00.  Ummm.

The challenge:  you have to prove you are involved in a hipster 
subculture.  Is raving still hip?  My advice for promoters.  Get in touch 
with Neal Stewart, the divisional marketing manager at Pabst.  For the 
face-to-face with Neal or one of his local organic reps you should send 
someone with ample facial hardware and body art.  Take it from there.  Who 
knows, in a few weeks we might see a BSP for "PBR -- the hipster ug."

Good luck.

Love,

Apollo

"Security is mostly a superstition.  It does not exist in nature, nor do 
the children of humans as a whole experience it.  Avoiding danger is no 
safer in the long run than outright exposure.  Life is either a daring 
adventure or nothing."
-Helen Keller

"Compassion is not a relationship between the healer and the wounded.  It's 
a relationship between equals.  Only when we know our own darkness well can 
we be present with the darkness of others.  Compassion becomes real when we 
recognize our shared humanity."
-Pema Chodron

"Americans have, for the most part, been exempt from the genuine tragedy of 
war and, as a consequence, seem more ready to accept their myths about war. 
They have never endured the reality against which other nations readily 
measure the cost of combat. And this makes us a very dangerous people. "

Subject: Re: [sfraves] SRR:  Free Cash for "Hipster" Parties

Babst does have one thing going for it besides its brand though: It's
cheap. I don't think what these marketers are doing is anything new, it's
just that they have to be much more subtle and creative about it nowadays.
Today's youth are so used to being manipulated and marketed to that they
are much more resistant to it and it takes a lot more effort to get
through to them.

Another funny thing about Pabst, and its parent company Miller Brewing:
Miller was sold by its parent Phillip Morris to South African Breweries
last year. So Pabst Blue Ribbon, the classic American brand, is now owned
by a South African conglomerate.

You're probably subscribed with a different address than the one you are
trying to unsubscribe from. Look at the full headers of one of the list
messages. Since you are using pine to read your mail, the command is "h".
Then look at the "Return-Path:" header, it will have the address you are
subscribed with encoded in it. Send a message to
sfraves-help@hyperreal.org for instructions on how to unsubscribe and
address that is different from your current one.

Yep, you're definitely not subscribed as prague@helsinki.cc.gatech.edu if
you are still geting list messages, since that address bounces.

Blue Tattoo is a chain...  locations in San Diego, San Ramon, and that 
nightlife hub known as Modesto  ;)  I wasn't too impressed by their 
scene, but they do get some good talent on occasion.

I'm just waiting for a Moose McGillicudy's to open up in SoMa. Then we 
can ready a toe tag for club culture in SF!

all the shops i used to have some luck in on haight street, in the castro,

Hello,

   I used to buy *all* of my stuff at various Ross stores! They
have the bets prices, 50% off or more, and always had a decent
selection of JNCO, KikWear n Menace.  Take care...

Denim, denim everywhere....  Have you tried Distractions on the upper 
Haight?  These days I get cargo pants cheaply by visiting Ross 
outlets.  They sometimes carry remaindered phat pants also.  Then there is 
Ragz.  I know the one at the Stonestown Mall used to carry Kikwear and 
similar products.

Love,

Apollo

a relationship between equals.  Only when we know our own darkness well can 
we be present with the darkness of others.  Compassion becomes real when we 
recognize our shared humanity."
-Pema Chodron

"It's taken me all my life to learn what not to play."

You want a kitten?
http://www.craigslist.org/nby/pet/12738006.html
Lots of kitties need homes this time of year,
I got the cutest kitty 3 years ago while running in downtown sunnyvale, she was feral, and she bit me 5 times...I saved her from a life on the streets, but does she love me? It's Alex, my husband the cat whisperer that she loves, I feed her and clean her litter box and vaccumm up her hair, but it's alex she loves...

Weird! I found one there a few years ago too. Little bitty kitten. He's 
now monstrously huge and lives in my friend's apartment. We named him 
Fibbar, after the bar we found him in front of. Our big, fat Irish 
kitty.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] kitty litter grains: sujet du jour nrr

the number one thing you need to look for in a kitten
is the ability to talk. while this might not seem as
important as cute fur or pretty eyes, sooner or later
it is bound to come in handy.

the surprising thing is that many people who own
kittens and cats that can talk are totally unaware of
the fact. cats have oddly-shaped vocal chords, which
makes their utterances often seem devoid of meaning to
the average listener.

cats were actually created by the insane wizard Murp,
when he decided that the perfect animal would be half
owl and half monkey. however, cats are in denial of
the monkey side of their natures, which is why they
will say, if you ever ask them about it, "me owl."

not to interupt, but i forgot about hamburger mary's. i don't know if they are opened anymore. i guess, probably yes. that is one of the best places to go if you are drunk and want food and cute girls in an old beatup sort of environment. big burgers, big plate of fries. :)

Subject: (NRR) a request from the east side of the bay

sorry to send this to the list but, this is aimed to
those that i know whose e-mail addresses i no longer
have and those that i don't know but can help...

the events of the weekend that i reference i'll
probably post to the list once i can gather all the
thoughts floating around in my head and make a clear
statement about them but, to paraphrase the weekend: 3
days/2 nights at angels camp with many, many beautiful
souls and one wonderful spirit of a woman whom i had
many lovely conversations with without using words...

----

due to the events and experiences of this weekend i
refuse to be defeated by the bay area and move to
florida so i'm asking you all for some help.  if you
could please inform me of any and all jobs that you
know of or come across i would appreciate it.  also,
please take a look at my resume
http://www.xp12.com/gkfrazee/resume/Gabriel_Frazee-Resume.txt,
http://www.xp12.com/gkfrazee/resume/Gabriel_Frazee-Resume.DOC
and
http://www.xp12.com/gkfrazee/resume/Gabriel_Frazee-Resume.pdf)and
keep me in mind.

i am not necessarily looking for IS/IT jobs, though
that would be preferred, but anything.  i've applied
to everything job that i am remotely qualified for but
with not luck as of now.  since i do not have a car it
would need to be accessible via public transit and i
would prefer the east bay.

i'm also in dire need of couches to sleep on that are
close to bart and preferably in the east bay as i am
without a place to stay at the moment; a place with
reliable internet access would be prefered as well.
the easiest way to get in touch with me is via e-mail
as i am unsure as to where i am staying next though i
will be updating my resume with my current contact
information once i know what it is.

thank you all, and i will try to stay in better touch
with you all once things in my life are more stable.

HIGHTOWER: The Stupidity of Federal Drug Policy

By Jim Hightower, AlterNet
June 23, 2003

Let's hear it for Ed Rosenthal!

He's a marijuana grower  but before you can say "drug dealer," let me say 
that he grows his marijuana to be sold for medical purposes, supplying 
patients under doctor supervision and who need the medicine to treat severe 
and chronic pain, cancer-induced nausea, and other ailments.

Providing medical marijuana for these patients, many of whom are terminally 
ill and have no other medicine to ease their agonies, is not only humane 
and medically sound, but it's also perfectly legal  in 1996, the people of 
California voted to OK this use of the cannabis plant.

In 2001, however, George W chose John "Mad Dog" Ashcroft to be the U.S. 
attorney general, and this super-pious, right-wing extremist has zero 
respect for the will of the people. Asserting his personal bias over 
states' rights and democratic choice, the authoritarian Ashcroft is on a 
prosecutorial crusade against California and the eight other states that 
have passed medical marijuana laws.

Saying that his views and the federal law pre-empt state law, Ashcroft's 
agents have been going after people like Rosenthal with a vengeance. In a 
perverse, Orwellian twist of justice, the Feds convicted Ed by refusing to 
allow him to tell jurors that he was operating within state law. Jurors 
later angrily said they would've acquitted him had they known this.

Now the good news: Instead of 100 years in prison and a $4.5 million fine, 
as the absurd federal law allows, the judge only assessed a thousand dollar 
fine and one day in prison for Ed. Rosenthal will now appeal the silly 
conviction itself, and his case has become a rallying point for all of us 
who think this federal law is an anti-American assault on our basic 
liberties. Yet Ashcroft is as arrogant and autocratic as ever  as one of 
his agents said of Ed and us supporters of common sense: "We are not 
listening to them."

And that's exactly what's wrong with national drug policy.

the children of humans as a whole experience it.  Avoiding danger is no 
safer in the long run than outright exposure.  Life is either a daring 
adventure or nothing."
-Helen Keller

"Compassion is not a relationship between the healer and the wounded.  It's 
a relationship between equals.  Only when we know our own darkness well can 
we be present with the darkness of others.  Compassion becomes real when we 
recognize our shared humanity."

sometimes, you mightn't feel very motivated OR you might just have a few free seconds on your hands here and there to make some sort of leap into powerplay or something like that. i was rather lost for words, or rather, thinking that there wouldn't be anything worth reading or saying today, but now you might be sort of awake on your second or two of semi-alertness. just so you are aware, just in case your not already, you have to sort of make an effort in life. :)

this is utterly specious.  you'd think that someone who, as Hightower did, 
has actuall worked in state government, would have come to understand that 
under federal law, a given federal law pre-empts (that's the legal term) any 
conflicting state law on the same subject.  that's how legalized segregation 
was eliminated.  that's the law of the land, like it or not.  and as such, 
whether Rosenthal--or anyone else--was acting under state law is totally 
legally irrelevant to the federal case.

Subject: NRR: SFLNC and housing in the mission?

I'm taking a summer urban studies course, and I'm thinking about some
rumblings I remember hearing about regarding developers wanting to put
apartment buildings in a san francisco club district.

The paper I need to write is on conflict over land use.

Anyone from the SFLNC maybe want to correspond over this?

Thanks:)

Sorry I have missed a few days.  

Back in the day, I used to go to this tiny restaurant for breakfast in San 
Carlos, and it was decently ok greasy breakfast, only thing was you never 
knew when he would be open for business.  Sometimes I don't know when I'll 
have a reliable internet connection.  

eh?

Yes...I bought my house records there for many years when it was 
Housewares.  Knew the staff.  The place was like a second home to me.  I 
felt that when they were purchased by ESDJCO their days were numbered.  The 
selection of vinyl declined and the concentration seemed to be on clothes 
and other gear.

Love,

Apollo

Housewares was bought out by ESDJCO?

Is nothing sacred?

This would be a perfect time to cook up a few doomsday
predictions for the Bay Area rave scene, especially
given that Compound went on its way too, but look what
happened with that crew. Sage is doing CDs for
Moonshine now and Abstract is producing breaks in
London. Not all change is bad.

Blah blah blah.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Remembering Relic....

Relic was a cool party. No I'm not biased because I helped throw it. It was
just a really fun, intimate party and the last party ever thrown at
Overworld (predecesor to the now Otherworld). There was a lot of work put
into that party. The most we have every done for a party come to think of
it. Personally I really liked Amalgamation more. It was nutso-chaotic and
full of energy. Relic seemed a lot more social and chill as I recall. Either
way both parties were a lot of fun. =)

My top party is a toss up between Cloudfactory 6yr and FnF Campout 2000.

woah - I had forgotten that, but the weird thing is,
that reminds me, I keep dreaming that I'm pregnant.
I've had like fifty dreams about being pregnant in the
last two months. if I was a chick, I'd go take a
pregnancy test. I might even take a pregnancy test
anyway, just to be safe.

anyway, yes, egg. check. cheers!

WORD... RITM!!!! But Damn 1015 is way to small for RITM.. With there full on 
pyrotechnics show!!

But they haven't been here at least as far as I know since like Analog put 
on by Space Children like 4 years ago??..

WORD OF ADVICE FOR YOU BIG LEVEL PROMOTERS: BRING OUT RITM FOR A RAVE.. I 
KNOW THEY MIGHT BE A BIT EXPENSIVE BUT GET OFF YOUR MONEY$$ MAKING ASSES AND 
SPEND A LIL.
You can See DJ Dan almost anytime or Mark Farina or Jeno etc... (Granted 
these are excellent DJ's) but you can still see them any ol day of the week. 
Why have them as your headliners for your Mega rave??

I would personally go to a cheese Candy coated rave just to see RITM.


see some of ya at 1015.. I will be the guy with the glow in the dark RITM 
long sleeve shirt ;)

I second that.  I've lived in the Bay Area now for 3 and a half years
expecting them to have been brought out by now.  I missed them just
barely at Red Rocks and one of their latest in New York and I have never
heard anyone say they've seen many better stage performances as far as
visuals and sound go.

WORD... RITM!!!! But Damn 1015 is way to small for RITM.. With there
full on 
pyrotechnics show!!

But they haven't been here at least as far as I know since like Analog
put 
on by Space Children like 4 years ago??..

WORD OF ADVICE FOR YOU BIG LEVEL PROMOTERS: BRING OUT RITM FOR A RAVE..
I 
KNOW THEY MIGHT BE A BIT EXPENSIVE BUT GET OFF YOUR MONEY$$ MAKING ASSES
AND 
SPEND A LIL.
You can See DJ Dan almost anytime or Mark Farina or Jeno etc... (Granted

these are excellent DJ's) but you can still see them any ol day of the
week. 
Why have them as your headliners for your Mega rave??

I would personally go to a cheese Candy coated rave just to see RITM.


see some of ya at 1015.. I will be the guy with the glow in the dark
RITM 
long sleeve shirt ;)

That sounds good to me!  I'm really thinking about where I wanna go with
my music and electro and 80's style synthpop are two of the routes I
really wanna go :)  In reality I wanna be the next Robert Smith... I
just don't wanna learn guitar.

TECHSPLOITATION: What is the Internet?

By Annalee Newitz, AlterNet
June 23, 2003

Several things in the past few weeks have driven me into a Hulk-like frenzy 
of geek fury. One of those things was the new Hulk flick, but we'll let 
that one slide for now. You'll just have to banish Ang Lee's misguided 
movie from your mind as you imagine me getting greener and greener, madder 
and madder, until I'm finally several yards tall, the glasses have popped 
off my distended face, and I'm punching the Windows 98 boxes that litter my 
office, screaming, "NERD ANGRY!!! NERD SMASH!!!"

It all started, like so many geek rampages recently have, with a stupid 
Microsoft puppet company called the Santa Cruz Operation. My devious hacker 
friend Mason kept sending me links about SCO that he'd ripped off from 
Slashdot, which he would follow up with a phone call. "What have you done 
to hurt SCO today?" he'd ask. When I admitted I'd done nothing more than 
read the SCO story told using characters from "The Dukes of Hazzard", he 
would giggle evilly and say, "I've been crank calling them all morning on 
their 800 number! Mwah, mwah, mwah!"

Great. I'm not cool enough to crank call SCO and ask why its network has 
mysteriously crashed yet again. Unix vendor SCO has been having strange 
problems with its office computers ever since it decided to sue IBM for $3 
billion.

You may be asking, What the hell is insignificant little SCO doing in a 
lawsuit like that? Well, SCO claims IBM yanked some proprietary 
intellectual property (i.e., lines of code) out of Unix (which SCO owns by 
virtue of some buyout shenanigans during the wild and woolly 1990s) and 
tossed it over to Linus Torvalds (the engineer responsible for creating 
Linux), who apparently smuggled that code into his dirty little operating 
system. Meanwhile, in a most amusing move, SCO has declined to identify 
exactly which pieces of the code in Linux were stolen from it.

Early in this whole shitstorm, Microsoft licensed SCO's Unix technology, 
thereby giving a hot cash injection to the flagging company and implicitly 
supporting its claim.

Basically, the whole damn circus is a plot to undermine the credibility of 
Linux, an operating system that Microsoft considers one of the greatest 
threats to its empire. And yet there might be some dangerous precedents set 
once the FUD vapor clears. SCO's high-powered lawyer, David Boies (who 
represented the federal government in its antitrust suit against 
Microsoft), intends to argue that SCO owns copyrights to parts of the Unix 
operating system, which would set all kinds of dangerous precedents in 
future litigation because so many operating systems have bits of Unix and 
Unix-like code in them. You see why Microsoft might be excited about this 
idea. It would lead to more lawsuits and could ultimately make it a lot 
harder for companies without deep pockets to adopt open-source systems 
based on Unix or Linux.

Musing disgustedly on all of this, I was interrupted by a call on my cell. 
"Is this Annalee Newitz?" an unfamiliar voice asked. Fuck if I wasn't 
getting a goddamn telemarketing pitch on my previously spam-free cell 
phone: "Hi, I'm Puke Licker from Comcast, and we're wondering if you'd like 
to sign up for our new digital Internet service for a special rate this 
month."
After a long pause, I asked, "What is the Internet?"

This question obviously wasn't on his script. "Well, it's like computers," 
he helpfully explained. "Do you use computers in your home?"

"Oh no, we don't do that at my house. Sorry," I replied, clicking off.

So there you have it, boys and girls, right from the mouth of some 
technoplebe at Comcast: the Internet is like computers. See, no matter what 
SCO says or what the courts decide or whose asshole Microsoft is ramming 
full of its giant splintery dildo this month, the people have spoken. The 
Internet, whose software infrastructure is almost entirely based on Unix, 
is computers. Can any single corporate entity claim copyright on computers? 
Nope. I mean, what are computers, after all? I'll bet they're like the 
Internet. And nobody owns that, right?

Yeah, right. This is one of those moments when I wish there were an 
emoticon for sarcasm.

Annalee Newitz (bleah@techsploitation.com) is a surly media nerd who 
finally did something to hurt SCO today. Her column also appears in Metro, 
Silicon Valley's weekly newspaper.

Kick me in the crotch repeatedly and I can probably do a decent Annie
Lennox or Martin Gore impression.  I won't want to sing any happy lyrics
though.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Portland omgwtf!

I am here email me off list and we'll meet up. Tonight; Wednesday if you
want come on down to the Cobalt Lounge at SW 3rd and Couch in Downtown.

Ok, but do we have to wear robes?

I think we'd all look better in white jumpsuits with lots of 
rhinestones.

And dayglo facepaint!!

even if you are on some sort of a diet, you have to eat, and you have to eat a lot. you need to feed your body with nutrients so that the bones, the muscle and, yes the necessary fat (everyone needs fat for body heat and some cushion against falling, accidents and to prevent things like breaking bones in small falls which will happen from time to time). so, you have to eat. if you look in the mirror and think there is too much of you, you are not the only one. sometimes, people think there is too much of them when there is hardly anything there. that happens sometimes and is simply an example of perception. perceiving is healthy, not eating isn't. please always eat and learn about nutrition, and if you think there is too much of you when everyone is also telling you that there isn't, then make sure you remember that and eat healthy foods everyday and read about nutrition. thank you. :)

Subject: DJ @ SNWMF sat nite in tent

Hey, not sure if there are many world music/ reggae
fans on this list, but was wondering if anyone was at
the Sierra Nevada world music festival and/or happened
to know who the DJ was that was spinning in the rugged
tent on saturday night.  It was a fantastic mix of
reggae and edm.  He was great and had people bumping
for hours.  
But... I never got a chance to get his name, and they
don't have it listed on their web site.

Subject: SRR: BSB: Altered States and the Spiritual Awakening

--0-990699056-1056651987=:5114
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Hi, There is this conference I am working on, well actualy I was hired to make presenter's gifts and sort of got sucked in because it was really interesting, and guess what! The person who is putting on the conference went to the same school as my husband! , Anyway, for those of you into the spiritual side of raving this would be a fun thing to check out. I put SRR instead of NRR because there is an optional  party for the participants of the conference, (not at the same location, but walkable) I have been to both locations and they are FANTASTIC (IMHO), and have a really good vibe. Please respect the disclaimer that this is a "substance free" event. It's ok to post to other lists as long as you include the disclaimer.
 
7/11-7/13 Altered States and the Spiritual Awakening [SF]
A cross generational conference with Lectures and Workshops exploring Parapsychology, Transpersonal Psychology, and Entheogens. Opening and closing ceremonies, morning yoga, catered meals included. Weekend pass: $85 regular, $55 students. For more information on ASSA visit: http://www.assacon.com


Altered States and the Spiritual Awakening aims to create a uniquely interactive meeting of the minds. We are gathering together pioneers in the field of consciousness luminaries who have shown how to deepen the completeness of the human spirit and connections between souls and encouraging them to share their discoveries with those who wish to learn.

One of the primary goals of this conference is to bring together experts in multiple forms of altered states. We seek to cover three main spheres of knowledge: transpersonal and para-psychology, entheogens, and counsciousness exploration through external (technological) means. While all of the fields share certain commonalities, they all provide unique insights into how we can enrich the human psyche and deepen understanding of our existence.

The time is ripe to have a meeting like the one were organizing. Many youth today are actively searching to fill gaps of meaning and connection in their lives. All too often, young people turn to the underground cultures mind-altering substances to quickly numb themselves and deaden the sensations of spiritual longing. The value of spiritual awakening via altered states that was discovered by older generations has faded out of view. This conference is an attempt to bridge the gap between multiple generations of the same community and help gurus pass their wisdom to students.

In order to succeed at introducing a new generation of people to this type of wisdom, we are conducting this gathering differently than an average conference. First of all, we are deliberately setting the entrance fee at a point that will make it much more accessible to young people. False Profit, the group hosting the event, is predicated on emphasizing human value over financial value, and will turn no profit from the enterprise.

Moreover, this conference will take a different approach to communication than most others. We will go beyond a formal lecture-and-listen model and encourage a more personal learning process. Our loft space is conducive to establishing the intimate milieu we are aiming for. Overall, we aim to create a comfortable set and setting that will allow people to share openly in the event.

you may remember that after the filming of the last harry potter movie
(chamber of secrets) that the actor who played Dumbledor (sp?), aka the old
guy, died (in real life). now this poses a major problem in making more of
the movies in the series since he was a major character. so how would they
keep making the movies without Dumbledor (sp?)? well, if he didnt exist
anymore; or should i say, if he died...

Replace him with the guy who plays Gandolf in LOTR. That's what I would do
and given that this book was started before the other guys death I highly
doubt that's who dies. I'm not going to speculate. I'll just read that damn
thing at some point. =)

Well I guess we will have to put a heater in our "chill" room at the next 
Moksha party.  This is all so absurd.........


Court: Government Can Ban Glow Sticks

Weds, June 25, 2003


In a blow to free speech and public health, the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of 
Appeals overturned a federal judge's ruling that prohibited the government 
from banning glow sticks, pacifiers, and air-conditioned "chill out" rooms 
at a New Orleans nightclub. The Court of Appeals ruled that U.S. District 
Judge Thomas Porteous overstepped his bounds by blocking the government's 
ban on glow sticks and pacifiers during raves at the club. The appeals 
court tossed out the decision saying that the judge can't stop federal 
prosecutors from enforcing a condition of a plea bargain made in the 
criminal case against a promoter at the club.

The plea bargain deal was reached in a criminal case against a promoter at 
the State Palace Theater in New Orleans. Barbecue of New Orleans, which 
promotes events at the State Palace Theater, was charged with violating the 
federal "crack-house" law - a federal law created to arrest owners of 
property used primarily for drug offenses. The federal government sought to 
send the promoter to jail even though he was not involved in drugs and took 
active steps to keep drugs out of the club. In a plea agreement, the 
company was fined $100,000 and put on probation for five years. Robert 
Brunet, president of Barbecue of New Orleans, also agreed to ban glow 
sticks, vapor rub, pacifiers, dust masks, and other legal items from future 
parties, as well as to eliminate air-conditioned "chill out" rooms where 
patrons could cool off in after dancing to avoid over-heating.

The ban caught the attention of the ACLU, which filed a civil lawsuit 
against the government on behalf of several patrons of the club. The suit 
claimed that the ban violated the First Amendment rights of club attendees. 
Judge Porteous sided with the ACLU and ruled that federal prosecutors could 
not enforce the prohibition as part of the plea bargain. In his ruling, 
Porteous said, "The government cannot keep legal items out of places 
because of illegal activities they associate with those items."

The federal government appealed this decision and the 5th Circuit Court of 
Appeals ruled that third-parties do not have the right to challenge the 
constitutionality of a plea agreement that they are not a part of, even if 
it affects them. The plea agreement's ban on glow sticks and other legal 
items was reinstated. The Court of Appeals, however, did not rule on 
whether or not the federal government could force defendants to accept such 
bans as part of a plea agreement to avoid jail time. This leaves open the 
possibility of legal challenges to such bans in future cases.

The ruling also opens the door to the federal government using the Illicit 
Drug Anti-Proliferation Act (more commonly known as the RAVE Act) to coerce 
nightclub owners and event organizers into banning glow sticks and other 
legal items at their events. The Drug Policy Alliance, which not only 
fought the legislation in Congress, worked to overturn the New Orleans ban 
and will continue to work to repeal or reform the law and protect the free 
speech rights and well being of all Americans.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Court: Government Can Ban Glow Sticks

I personally think dancing with glows sticks is gay.  However, for the
government to ban this is even gayer.  WTF?  I could understand if a
club banned them voluntarily but for the government to interfere is
ridiculous.  I can't wait to move back to Europe.  No glow sticks and no
RAVE act.

Court: Government Can Ban Glow Sticks

Weds, June 25, 2003


In a blow to free speech and public health, the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court
of 
Appeals overturned a federal judge's ruling that prohibited the
government 
from banning glow sticks, pacifiers, and air-conditioned "chill out"
rooms 
at a New Orleans nightclub. The Court of Appeals ruled that U.S.
District 
Judge Thomas Porteous overstepped his bounds by blocking the
government's 
ban on glow sticks and pacifiers during raves at the club. The appeals 
court tossed out the decision saying that the judge can't stop federal 
prosecutors from enforcing a condition of a plea bargain made in the 
criminal case against a promoter at the club.

The plea bargain deal was reached in a criminal case against a promoter
at 
the State Palace Theater in New Orleans. Barbecue of New Orleans, which 
promotes events at the State Palace Theater, was charged with violating
the 
federal "crack-house" law - a federal law created to arrest owners of 
property used primarily for drug offenses. The federal government sought
to 
send the promoter to jail even though he was not involved in drugs and
took 
active steps to keep drugs out of the club. In a plea agreement, the 
company was fined $100,000 and put on probation for five years. Robert 
Brunet, president of Barbecue of New Orleans, also agreed to ban glow 
sticks, vapor rub, pacifiers, dust masks, and other legal items from
future 
parties, as well as to eliminate air-conditioned "chill out" rooms where

patrons could cool off in after dancing to avoid over-heating.

The ban caught the attention of the ACLU, which filed a civil lawsuit 
against the government on behalf of several patrons of the club. The
suit 
claimed that the ban violated the First Amendment rights of club
attendees. 
Judge Porteous sided with the ACLU and ruled that federal prosecutors
could 
not enforce the prohibition as part of the plea bargain. In his ruling, 
Porteous said, "The government cannot keep legal items out of places 
because of illegal activities they associate with those items."

The federal government appealed this decision and the 5th Circuit Court
of 
Appeals ruled that third-parties do not have the right to challenge the 
constitutionality of a plea agreement that they are not a part of, even
if 
it affects them. The plea agreement's ban on glow sticks and other legal

items was reinstated. The Court of Appeals, however, did not rule on 
whether or not the federal government could force defendants to accept
such 
bans as part of a plea agreement to avoid jail time. This leaves open
the 
possibility of legal challenges to such bans in future cases.

The ruling also opens the door to the federal government using the
Illicit 
Drug Anti-Proliferation Act (more commonly known as the RAVE Act) to
coerce 
nightclub owners and event organizers into banning glow sticks and other

legal items at their events. The Drug Policy Alliance, which not only 
fought the legislation in Congress, worked to overturn the New Orleans
ban 
and will continue to work to repeal or reform the law and protect the
free 
speech rights and well being of all Americans.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Court: Government Can Ban Glow Sticks

Umm, I think you're kind of mis-construing what this article is saying,
Apollo.  The court did not say that the government could ban glowsticks.
The judge's ruling was purely procedural.  Read:

"The appeals
court tossed out the decision saying that the judge can't stop federal
prosecutors from enforcing a condition of a plea bargain made in the
criminal case against a promoter at the club."

"The federal government appealed this decision and the 5th Circuit Court of
Appeals ruled that third-parties do not have the right to challenge the
constitutionality of a plea agreement that they are not a part of, even if
it affects them."

This is a decision about plea bargains and the ability of third parties to
contest them; not about glowsticks or raves or anything like that.

So don't worry - no heater needed for your chill room.

I'd comment on that, but considering my ethnic background and the fact 
that I don't like to be locked up in black-hole facilities like 
Guantanamo Bay, I'll refrain.

You hear that, Asscroft, you got nothin on me! Nothin!!!

All I can say without being hauled off by jack-booted thugs is this: 
get out there and vote these people out. I know it's hard to get a vote 
in edgewise these days, but it's time to mobilize. Clear the beltway. 
Get involved. I thought for sure all the rumblings about the RAVE act 
(before it was passed) would charge up the EDM community and get 
everyone involved, but it seems like after GWII was "won" everyone's 
been sheepishly silenced.  And I don't blame anyone - it's hard going 
up against popularity - but I have a feeling that most of us have been 
doing that since an early age.

Personally, I'm still trying to find a way to get people riled up 
again.. :)

Now, back to your regularly scheduled pumping techno party music, 
glo-sticks, and dust masks.

Time for another Summer of Love eh? I do believe that
at some point this whole move to the right has got to
give. It started with Nixon in the 70's, continued
with 4 years of mild rollbacks to the center in the
Carter admin. Then came the black twelve years with
Reagan/Bush and another respite with Clinton for the
next 8.  But this is different. It's like we're going
up a steep hill, something has to happen. We have to
come down the other side. 

The problem is, I don't want to wait. By the time it
comes around, I'm going to be too old. Can SFR and
other tribes (i.e. Friends N Family, Skills etc.) Get
some serious response to the RAVE ACT this time? There
is a National Day of Action coming. Make sure it's on 
a Saturday, announce it here. And show up on the
Federal Court House Steps with all the sound you can
bring! We have got to stand up or soon there will be
no one who can. 

As a post script, did anyone besides me get the most
non-committal, nonresponsive letter back from Boxer's
office stating essentially "oh well, it's
law...there's nothing we can do?" That made me mad. So
I am in the process of writing back. Did anyone else?

The full text of the decision is

In the plea bargain the defendants agreed to eliminate glow sticks, chill 
rooms and other "evidence" of MDMA use from their parties.  A court 
overturned this element of the plea bargain -- and the new ruling 
reinstates these conditions, ie, that the glow sticks, etc. can be banned 
from further parties as a part of the plea bargain.  This is how I 
understand it.  Although this may be procedural, it reopens the whole issue 
that certain cultural artifacts of the rave subculture can be used to 
prosecute promoters and venue owners.  At least, this is how I understand it.

Love,

Apollo

What we need to do is take this scene back to '93. They can have their glow
sticks, Vicks, and "Crack Houses". Its time to get the 'ol generator and get
our asses down to Bonnie Dunes and have us a good ol fashion Full Moon Party
!!  You guys call the Wicked Crew, I will call Ameba Mark, No one call the
fuzz and we will go back to Charter Oak's for the afta partay. O wait its
2003 not 1993. Shit...I guess I'll see you at Cyberfest.. :(

Time for another Summer of Love eh? I do believe that
at some point this whole move to the right has got to
give. It started with Nixon in the 70's, continued
with 4 years of mild rollbacks to the center in the
Carter admin. Then came the black twelve years with
Reagan/Bush and another respite with Clinton for the
next 8.  But this is different. It's like we're going
up a steep hill, something has to happen. We have to
come down the other side. 

The problem is, I don't want to wait. By the time it
comes around, I'm going to be too old. Can SFR and
other tribes (i.e. Friends N Family, Skills etc.) Get
some serious response to the RAVE ACT this time? There
is a National Day of Action coming. Make sure it's on 
a Saturday, announce it here. And show up on the
Federal Court House Steps with all the sound you can
bring! We have got to stand up or soon there will be
no one who can. 

As a post script, did anyone besides me get the most
non-committal, nonresponsive letter back from Boxer's
office stating essentially "oh well, it's
law...there's nothing we can do?" That made me mad. So
I am in the process of writing back. Did anyone else?

I think that's beginning to happen.  I was waiting in the doctor's office 
yesterday, and I picked up a "Time" magazine to kill the time, as it 
were.  Now Time was always to the "right" of Newsweek, as I recall, though 
I rarely read either these days.  There were several articles about "Where 
Are the WMD?" of course.  But there was also an editorial very critical of 
the tax cuts -- taking the position they benefit the wealthy.  Then there 
was a piece about some minister who said, essentially, that the message of 
Christ did not concern things like sexual behavior and drug use.  Christ 
was much more focused in greed, and greed seems to have become a virtue in 
modern America.  Interesting.

As things become progressively darker on the economic front, people will 
want to party --  that is, feel human for a few hours a week.  If they have 
to go underground to do it, they will.  Always have.  Things in general are 
heating up.  Everyone has some limit to the bullshit they can eat and the 
oppression they can endure.

only in the case referred to; what the decision says is that after a final 
plea bargain and criminal judgement, the court can't go back and change the 
result absent a valid appeal, and it also affirms the principle that third 
parties (the people who sued to have the restrictions overturned, who were 
not parties to the original New Orleans criminal case) cannot appeal 
criminal judgements in cases with which they are not personally involved.

Anyone else find the irony that yesterday was George Orwells 100th

It seems his spirit still lives on....

On the news yesterday...
1. UK moves to register DNA of all babies "for future health care needs"
(NPR)
2. Internet providers will submit user information to record industry,
so they can search and prosecute "large file sharers." (NPR, CNN, KRON4)
3. In Santa Cruz, Pacific Mall lists and bans ex-convicts from entering
and shopping on the mall premises. (KRON-4)

Let's not forget talks of the Glow Stick ban.

Have a good day, comrade.

I saw Erasure at the Detroit Opra house before they were done resoring it! I was grounded when the tickets went on sale so I ended up in 3rd balcony where they hadn't fixed the seats yet! It was " the phantasmagorical entertainment" to this day it is the best show I have ever seen. I love Andy Bell sooo much. All the other girls my age were into New Kids...
Omid, Our cats are related and we go to the same concerts ... I'm your long lost twin!

eek!  september is the WORST!  in addition to it being hot as hell, it gets
HUMID. the thunderstorms are pretty cool though.

i lived in phoenix and did quite a few parties with the Desert Trance
Society kids, in addition to doing one of my own with a bunch of SF dj's.
:-)

maybe it's time for another SF-AZ party. let me know if you're serious about
doing one - we could get a big SF contingent out there with some planning.

Perfect! Then we can see if our cats are long lost twins.

What musical preference does your cat have? While my cat right here is fond
of house and breaks, the twin (at my friend's place) seems to be a huge fan
of synth-pop and mid-90's post-grunge... Seriously.

Neither have been seen waving any glo-sticks go. (Much to my relief.)

This is cool.. I now have an ex, a cousin, and a long-lost twin named Sarah.
Maybe I should rename my cat so I have the whole set!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Court: Government Can Ban Glow Sticks

Hb is absolutely right.  The ruling relates to a plea bargain that the
defendants in New Orleans made with the government, and a plea bargain is
not the law.

This is not to say that the current regime in this country is not arrayed
against us, but when we jump to conclusions and mis-state things, it only
makes us look foolish.  There's lots of really really important things to
get upset about (the aforementioned black hole of Guantanamo Bay being one
of them), but a single plea bargain banning glowsticks at one single venue
is not one of them.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Court: Government Can Ban Glow Sticks

You guys are paranoid.. they arent going to ban glowsticks if they cant ban
bongs.. and even if they make it illegal to have glow sticks in clubs, they
cant stop every one-time nightly party.. maybe just the big ones that post
adds on freeway underpases and littered in the streets of SF...

Peace,
Mystic

2) Who can give one?

See you all on Monday!

I would like to put streaming music on my web site. I
know that it has to be compressed or it will be a huge
file. 
My question is what is the best way to save the file?
What are some good programs that would allow me to do
this? 
This is new to me, so any help would be great.

See, there's a little problem with that.

'Last time around, I *DID* get out and vote.  And a bloody lot of good voting
did, eh?  We never voted these people IN, in the first place.  The shrub
demonstrated pretty clearly that there are only nine people in the country
whose votes actually count.  And THOSE people are a worthlessly corrupt bunch
of assholes, many of those whom were put into power by either shrub the FIRST,
or its immediate predecessor.

My own inclination is running more and more along the lines of figureing out a
good way to get the hell OUT of here.

john

Let me tell you, this CD is amazing!  It has hints of hiphop, drum and bass,

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Court: Government Can Ban Glow Sticks

I was thinking more along the lines of that comet from "Deep Impact".  The way
I see it, it needs to break into THREE pieces tho... one for EACH washington,
and one for texas.  Between them, that'd solve most of the country's problems
in one fell swoop.

Failing that, I wonder if the British would be intrested in having the eastern
seaboard back?  They could burn down washington again, and the only request I'd
have is that they lock all of the republicans *IN* the government buildings
when they burn them this time around.  Take care of texas by giving it back to
Mexico; and all you're left is with the OTHER washington.  I'm NOT sure how the
British would deal with the microsoft problem tho.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Court: Government Can Ban Glow Sticks

Hell... Time magazine?  That's nothing.

Even Warren Buffett, founder and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, and (usually) the
second richest person in the world has condemned the shrub's tax cut package to
be nothing more than a bullshit payoff to the uber-rich!

He put it more eloquently than me, of course, in an editorial he wrote for the
Washingtom Post; in which he describes the way the shrub's tax cut plan gives
him a $310 million tax-free payout, and pushes HIS effective tax rate down to
about 3%; while leaving his receptionist's (his example) rate at about 30%!  He
then goes on to compare the idea that this will "stimulate the economy" to
"voodoo economics" the term first coined by the shrub's own father to criticize
reagan's plans to create money out of nothingness, by cutting taxes and raising
military spending.

i know some things that you don't know, and also, even though i love to help and to make people just beam with pride, i am going to hold it all in in the name of pride, which incidentally, is coming up this weekend, i believe, in s.f....also, just in case you are totally scared or totally lost in it, just because a man dresses as a woman doesn't necesssarily mean that he is gay. kind of like a person who eats lollipops for fun, and a raver who does it for hydration and sugars so that they don't die. i just wanted you to be clear on that, so that if you are afraid of appearing to be gay, as many people are, you will still partake in the fine clothing. you can do this without running the risk of whatever it is that is freaking you out about all those people who don't want a relationship with you anyway, who aren't even noticing you unless they are just trying to squeeze past you on a crowded sidewalk...who also would have prefered not to walk by you in the first place. do you know what
 i mean? i am certain you do. kind of like california is about to release about 800 known sex offenders from jail and not require that they register so that you know who they are when they move next door to you and your children. keep your eyeballs peeled, that says. you should be anyway, so maybe this unfortunate legal stance is actually going to create a safer precidence...precident (sp? situation). ironic, huh? :)

Will your supa pimp Photo artwork be present?

For those that may not know.. Ryan among other things (VW Jetta Modifying

Ok, it's messages like that that totally confuse me, since all the

Okay, count me there too.  If any of you want me to hear your Demo CD to
be placed on the DJUnderground.com web site, bring it with you.  Email
me first so we can get in touch before the party.

If you don't know what DJUnderground.com is, you haven't been reading
the list :)

For those who have read this post already within the past few weeks and
have emailed me, thank you.  We are within the final steps of releasing
the site and making it "live".  Next week we are going into testing.
EVERYONE who has responded will get an email back, if you haven't heard
from me already.
 
There is going to be a new web site that has never been done before.  It
will cater to the underground electronic DJ scene in the Bay Area, with
styles of music ranging from House, Trance, NRG, Hard Trance, Hard
House, Jungle, DnB, Ambient, Acid Jazz, Turntablism, etc. (I think you
get the point).  Interested?  Keep reading...
 
Does this fit your description?  An electronic DJ or composer that is
too talented for their own good, but doesn't know how to get themselves
known...
 
...This is where we come in.  
 
If you think you got some killer dj mixes or some tracks you put
together yourself, then we are looking (more specifically, listening)
for you.  We're looking for 25-50 talented DJ's and composers to get the
site launched with fresh, off-the-hook slammin' music.  We're looking
for 192kbps mp3's of your mixes or tracks.  If we like what we hear,
then we'll give you a free 6-month membership to our site.  More details
will be explained once we make contact with you.
 
We are just like you - we are doing this for the music, and for the
electronic community.  This site will cater to the electronic DJ's in
every aspect imaginable.
 
If you are interested, please follow the below steps:
 
1) email djunderground@wctech.net with the subject "I am interested in
DJUnderground.com".  Let us know you will be sending your mix(es) or
track(s) in the mail.  ** We are not accepting any more tracks and mixes
by email or URL **
 
2) When you mail us your music, please be sure to include a tracked out
Audio CD, a 192kbps MP3 CD, tracklisting, specific genre and/or style
you want to be described as, and your contact information.  This ensures
everything to go smooth if we choose your music.
 
3) Send the package to DJUnderground.com, 15340 Charmeran Ave., San Jose
CA 95124-3409.
 
4) Once we receive your music and listen to it (turnaround usually a
day), we will send you an email with more detailed information.  If you
have music we like, we will give you all your account information, plus
extra instructions.
 
 
We are also looking for people who are interested in writing articles or
reviews on the electronic scene.  These can range from CD reviews, to
Singles reviews of tracks that are out there right now, clubs, raves - I
think you get the point.  Anything and everything that relates to the
electronic scene.  If you are interested, please email
djunderground@wctech.net with the subject "I want to write articles!".
 
 
If you know of places where we can get RSS feeds (free or paying) that
we can place on our site, please email djunderground@wctech.net with the
subject "I know where you can get RSS feeds!"  Don't send us URL's to a
list of 1 million non-related RSS feeds.  We're looking for good, solid,
electronica related feeds that are updated at least once a week.
 
If you feel you can offer ANYTHING else to the site, please by all means
email us.  Just email djunderground@wctech.net with the subject "I can
offer something to DJUnderground.com".
 
For some of you who have doubts about this site, or who don't really
know what this site is and are getting rather upset not knowing what the
heck this is about, just know that DJ Seven (http://www.djsevenpix.com)
has agreed to update the Calendar of Events on a weekly basis.  He will
be bringing over 80,000 members from his site and mailing list to
DJUnderground.com.  How's THAT for exposure?
 
If you're serious about DJ'ing or producing, send us an email.  If
you're not, don't bother.

For the reason you listed above your site just lost all respect. Seven is a
spammer. He posts information about events that he shouldn't. You can't get
off his list. He is the epitome of club trash. I guess you have to have the
bad to balance out the good. Besides who are you really exposing the DJ's
work to? 80,000 email addy's grep'd from club/rave/industry lists? What a
blanket audience that is. You've got the crap that attends club nv/amnesia
sf/rouge/etc that are only out to be seen at the *hottest club* around.
You're helping promote that too. Take the *underground* part out of your
domain because you far, far, away from any semblance of the underground
culture here.

Innocentchild and John,

Thanks for the information.  I was not aware of this.  

In response to your comment innocentchild, you're right - you do have
the bad to balance out the good.  That's just how it is with any site.
The people who find this site to be beneficial will stay with the site,
while the others will find elsewhere to go.  I have a feeling you will
be with the latter.  No worries.

Underground is defined differently in each person's eyes.  To me, and to
the purpose of this site, underground means people without exposure.
And that's what I'm going to do, give the people who don't have exposure
the attention they deserve.

I'm not trying to flame anyone here, but next time you have very strong,
negative opinions about something, I'd rather you email me privately
than post on SFRaves how I am "far, far, away from any semblance of the
underground culture here" because quite frankly, this site is far, far,
away from any semblance of the NON-underground culture.  How can you
judge something you know nothing about?

Gee, maybe by the information in your emails and on your site, people come 
to initial conclusions?

Who told you to expose the underground?  Did it not occur to you that 
perhaps exposure is not sought?  How many DJ's send you letters asking for 
promo help?

Subject: Allen & heath Xone 32??


I currently own the Xone 64 and I really like the sound quality and
the filters on it, but honestly, the crossfader's contour is way too
soft for my taste. I looked at the Xone 32 online and noticed that it
has a knob to adjust the contour on the crossfader! Awesome! Has
anyone used this puppy? And if so, how does it compare to other
scratch mixers' contours? Is it harder than the Xone 64?

thanks!

One of the most irritating things about the "large expensive club"
circuit in America is the long lines at the door.  It's made worse by
staff working the line and picking out people to bring to the front and
the staff at the Tattoo were pros at it.  In the run up to opening
night, I saw advertisements that said "8 separate dance floors" then "4
separate dance floors" with W, X, Y, Z styles of music playing.  In
actuality, there were only two style of music, hip hop and cheap
American looped techno.  I didn't hear one euro tune the entire time.
There were "four" dance floors if you count several lounge areas as
dance floors but in that case you could count the outdoor area as a
dance floor as well.  However, there were still only two DJs playing
music so no matter what "dance floor" you were on you were hearing only
two styles of music.  The folks at the club seemed to sense the
disconnect and started leaving in droves at about one am.  The techno DJ
had about a half hour period where he couldn't play anything that would
make people get up and dance.  It was a big disappointment.  
 
Pluses: lot's of beautiful women on staff and in the club, the clientele
seemed friendly and out to have a good time.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Allen & heath Xone 32??

the xone32 has a pretty crappy curve out of the box, but you can
upgrade the crossfader and it helps a LOT.  (it's the penny&giles
crossfader option, $80 and worth every penny).

keep in mind that while the 32 is a GREAT mixer, it is not a pure
scratch mixer by any means.  even w/the upgraded crossfader the curve
is still a little wonky for scratching...

all nit-picking aside, it's a fantastic piece of equipment.  i don't
regret buying one at all!

shane, a happy xone32 owner of 2+ years.  8^)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Allen & heath Xone 32??


Glad someone brought this up:

I have a major gripe with the A & H Xone series mixer crossfaders, and I'm
surprised I haven't heard more people bring this up.  In my experience,
it's become pretty obvious what the issue with them is.

It took a while to figure out.  The slope of the crossfader is fine... if
you slowly move the crossfader from side to side, it actually has an
aggressive curve (when set up to do so), coming in pretty close to the end
of the crossfaders travel.  The issue is not with the crossfader's
curvature, but with a time domain aspect of the design.

This warrants a little technical explanation.

So here goes:
The Xones, like several other mixers currently on the market (for example
the z series Ranes) use a VCA crossfader (aka "active").  What this means
is that the signal from either channel does not literally travel through
the crossfader... but rather a non-varying voltage signal is passed
through the crossfader, and that this signal is in turn used to drive a
circuit that controls the amplitude of the respective channels.  Overall,
this is great.  This means that slight degradation of the crossfaders
mechanism does not equal an equal degradation in the sound of the channels
being run through it (allowing active designs a much longer working life).
Even better, since a single signal is used to drive both the left and
right channels... as well as the A and B side of the crossfader, it's a
far more elegant design and allows features like mapping the crossfader
curveature... and mixer manufacturers benefit because now crossfaders can
be simple linear taper sliders rather than having four audio channels go
through a device that gets a lot of thrashing.

To add even more "smoothness" to the thrashing on the crossfader, A&H
seems to employ a filter on this signal coming from the crossfader, to
prevent sudden gain changes from 0 (off) to an "on" value (which could
result in a pop).  Problem is, this 'pop filter' ramps up when you perform
scratch style cuts... instead of jumping instantaneously to the new value.

And in the case of the A&H mixers, makes it almost impossible to perform
techniques like twiddles, crabs and fast transforms in a manner that
sounds right.  It sorta softens the "attack"... like so:
         ____
________/    \______

instead of:
        _____
_______|     |______

This slope, is very short (probably a few milliseconds)... but it certain
circumstances it has a noticeable effect.

For going smoothly between records, this design is awesome, and results in
a better more hi-fi sound, but if a DJ has fast hands... (imagine a DJ
just cutting in the snare from a second record)... you can actually hear
the circuit gradually smoothing into the crucial attack portion of the
snare, rather than just playing it right as the crossfader physically
comes in.  With common techniques where you cut in the crossfader *right*
as the sound comes in, it shaves off the beginning of the sound you're
cutting in.

While I think this type of design is incorprated in many of the "active"
crossfader designs, the slope on the A & H is slow enough that it's
distracting, even for slamming alternately between two records (I first
noticed this as more than an preference or getting used to a new mixer
during Ethan and mines' set at Persistence... Ethan who *always* cuts hard
and on beat was sounding like he was coming in late on some of his cut
tricks).  You end up losing the punch of turntablist style 'cuts' when
using the crossfader.

I haven't proven that there is a time domain smoothing on the A & H
crossfader (meaning haven't actually gone of the schematic or applied
*real* testing proving my hypothesis), but it's evident if you set one
next to another mixer, and a-b them... or try tricks you've done a million
times on old Rane/Pioneer/Realistic/Gemini/Numark mixers that suddenly
don't land right on an A & H.

This seems to exist with a couple other mixers using active crossfader
circuits (my Rane mp22-z might do this but to a far lesser degree).  On
the Xones it's enough to be really limiting (meaning it affects even
simple cuts, not just really weird esoteric tricks that I shouldn't be
doing in public until I've practiced a couple more years :P).

YAY Cheap American Looped Techno!!!

(actually, if it's actually looped, it's usually a producer who missed the

define good hypnotic techno).

Actually, my upcoming EP is not "American Techno"... you gotta buy it
import... does that make it Euro enough to be good?

well. uh...**maybe** I'd drive a thousand miles to see

well actually I have new brake pads, but I haven't

Judges OK ban on trappings of raves

No inalienable right to glow sticks, they say

Saturday June 21, 2003

Staff writer Times-Picayune, New Orleans

http://www.nola.com/news/t-p/metro/index.ssf?/base/news-0/1056178522150940.xml

Saying a federal judge overstepped his bounds by blocking the government's 
ban on glow sticks and pacifiers during raves at the State Palace Theater, 
an appeals court Friday tossed out a decision that sided with the American 
Civil Liberties Union.

U.S. District Judge Thomas Porteous can't stop federal prosecutors from 
enforcing a condition of a plea bargain made in the criminal case against 
the rave promoters, a unanimous three-judge panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit 
Court of Appeals ruled.

The court sent the case back to Porteous to be dismissed and took a swipe 
at the ACLU. "Concerning the First Amendment, they have not explained the 
significance of vapor rub," Judge Rhesa Hawkins Barksdale noted, referring 
to the mentholated product that Ecstasy users sometimes inhale for an added 
sensation during raves.

Acting U.S. Attorney Jim Letten called the ruling a vindication for the 
government, which he said went after raves in the interest of public safety.

"The ACLU stuck its nose where it didn't belong," Letten said. "And the 5th 
Circuit said, 'You represent a third party. You do not have a right to 
interfere in a judicial process.' "

The 23-page decision revisits the 2001 high-profile government 
investigation into the promoters of raves, all-night dance parties 
notorious for attracting illicit drugs such as Ecstasy, a synthetic drug 
with hallucinogenic properties.

Accused of violating the federal "crack house" law, the corporation behind 
the New Orleans rave scene pleaded guilty in August 2001 and accepted a 
$100,000 fine and five years' probation.

Barbecue of New Orleans, whose president is Robert Brunet of Metairie, also 
agreed to ban glow sticks, vapor rub, pacifiers, dust masks and other rave 
accouterments from future parties. That's when the ACLU stepped in with a 
civil lawsuit that charged the government was violating the First Amendment 
rights of those who thronged to the laser-light-filled techno dances.

In February, Porteous agreed with the ACLU. While the government's push to 
rid raves of drugs is "pure," he said, it went against the Constitution's 
intent.

"The government cannot keep legal items out of places because of illegal 
activities they associate with those items," Porteous wrote.

But the government only asked Barbecue to "take reasonable steps to 
prohibit" glow sticks and the lot from the theater, the appeals court said 
Friday. "It does not require their confiscation," the decision says.

At a December 2001 hearing before Porteous, one of the three plaintiffs, 
Clayton Smith, testified that security guards made him throw away his glow 
sticks at the door.

While the ACLU and rave defenders claimed that federal agents went too far 
in their narcotics investigation, the appeals court made note of the rash 
of drug overdoses, including one 17-year-old girl's death, that plagued the 
State Palace Theater between 1997 and 2000.

Seventy people were taken from the theater on Canal Street to hospitals for 
drug overdoses, the court said. DEA agents made 50 buys of Ecstasy or other 
drugs during undercover stings at seven raves.

Prosecutors said Brunet and his corporation came up with the ban on its 
own, but the ACLU countered that the men were bullied by the threat of a 
criminal trial.

Smith said the pacifier has become a symbol of the rave counterculture and 
not a sign of drug use. The symbol evolved because Ecstasy users are known 
to grind their teeth, making pacifiers a comfort during their highs.

Under then-U.S. Attorney Eddie Jordan, federal prosecutors secured 
indictments against Brunet, his brother Brian Brunet and party promoter 
Donnie Estopinal. They applied the "crack house" law in a novel way, 
accusing the men of using the theater as a drug haven.

The federal law was created to combat the crack cocaine scourge of the 
1980s, allowing agents to arrest owners of property used as crack houses. 
Jordan resigned, and later became Orleans Parish district attorney, before 
the plea bargain was signed.

Joining Barksdale in the opinion were Judges Will Garwood and Jerry E. 
Smith. Garwood and Smith were both appointed by President Reagan, and 
Barksdale was appointed by former President Bush. Porteous was appointed by 
President Clinton.

MALACHY ON HOUSE

"When used with positive intention, Group energy has the potential to help 
restore the plan of Love on Earth...When you open your heart, and trust the 
whole group you dance with; when you feel love with everyone, and they 
return it, a higher vibration can be reached. This happens when a crowd is 
deep into the vibe of House...In the true sense of rhythmic movement, the 
effect is to align the physical, mental and emotional bodies with the 
Oneness of All that Is...Don't put out negative energy and feelings. Leave 
the old ways behind. Throw yourself into the winds of transformation and 
sow the seeds for a new world -- one where the human family is together 
again. When people respect each and care for each other as a 
community-organism...Spread the Peace!"

Come share another evening of unity through music and dance
with San Francisco's oldest house family.


Love,

Apollo

To solve this problem. 

Get the xone:02 turntablist mixer. It is made for the use you are
looking for and also has the three band eq for your electronic needs. 

It's like comparing apples and oranges. If you feel like eating an
apple, don't buy an orange. 

Personally I would buy the rane ttm56 before anything. Give us the
rundown of the magnetic "wet/dry" fader Mr. W.

Glad someone brought this up:

I have a major gripe with the A & H Xone series mixer crossfaders, and
I'm
surprised I haven't heard more people bring this up.  In my experience,
it's become pretty obvious what the issue with them is.

It took a while to figure out.  The slope of the crossfader is fine...
if
you slowly move the crossfader from side to side, it actually has an
aggressive curve (when set up to do so), coming in pretty close to the
end
of the crossfaders travel.  The issue is not with the crossfader's
curvature, but with a time domain aspect of the design.

This warrants a little technical explanation.

So here goes:
The Xones, like several other mixers currently on the market (for
example
the z series Ranes) use a VCA crossfader (aka "active").  What this
means
is that the signal from either channel does not literally travel through
the crossfader... but rather a non-varying voltage signal is passed
through the crossfader, and that this signal is in turn used to drive a
circuit that controls the amplitude of the respective channels.
Overall,
this is great.  This means that slight degradation of the crossfaders
mechanism does not equal an equal degradation in the sound of the
channels
being run through it (allowing active designs a much longer working
life).
Even better, since a single signal is used to drive both the left and
right channels... as well as the A and B side of the crossfader, it's a
far more elegant design and allows features like mapping the crossfader
curveature... and mixer manufacturers benefit because now crossfaders
can
be simple linear taper sliders rather than having four audio channels go
through a device that gets a lot of thrashing.

To add even more "smoothness" to the thrashing on the crossfader, A&H
seems to employ a filter on this signal coming from the crossfader, to
prevent sudden gain changes from 0 (off) to an "on" value (which could
result in a pop).  Problem is, this 'pop filter' ramps up when you
perform
scratch style cuts... instead of jumping instantaneously to the new
value.

And in the case of the A&H mixers, makes it almost impossible to perform
techniques like twiddles, crabs and fast transforms in a manner that
sounds right.  It sorta softens the "attack"... like so:
         ____
________/    \______

instead of:
        _____
_______|     |______

This slope, is very short (probably a few milliseconds)... but it
certain
circumstances it has a noticeable effect.

For going smoothly between records, this design is awesome, and results
in
a better more hi-fi sound, but if a DJ has fast hands... (imagine a DJ
just cutting in the snare from a second record)... you can actually hear
the circuit gradually smoothing into the crucial attack portion of the
snare, rather than just playing it right as the crossfader physically
comes in.  With common techniques where you cut in the crossfader
*right*
as the sound comes in, it shaves off the beginning of the sound you're
cutting in.

While I think this type of design is incorprated in many of the "active"
crossfader designs, the slope on the A & H is slow enough that it's
distracting, even for slamming alternately between two records (I first
noticed this as more than an preference or getting used to a new mixer
during Ethan and mines' set at Persistence... Ethan who *always* cuts
hard
and on beat was sounding like he was coming in late on some of his cut
tricks).  You end up losing the punch of turntablist style 'cuts' when
using the crossfader.

I haven't proven that there is a time domain smoothing on the A & H
crossfader (meaning haven't actually gone of the schematic or applied
*real* testing proving my hypothesis), but it's evident if you set one
next to another mixer, and a-b them... or try tricks you've done a
million
times on old Rane/Pioneer/Realistic/Gemini/Numark mixers that suddenly
don't land right on an A & H.

This seems to exist with a couple other mixers using active crossfader
circuits (my Rane mp22-z might do this but to a far lesser degree).  On
the Xones it's enough to be really limiting (meaning it affects even
simple cuts, not just really weird esoteric tricks that I shouldn't be
doing in public until I've practiced a couple more years :P).

Actually, I like several different styles (I tend to favor tracks that
are above 135 bpm)
http://www.cuepoint.info/sounds/18876.ram trance/vocal trance
 
http://www.cuepoint.info/sounds/18890.ram progressive trance (my fav)

http://www.cuepoint.info/sounds/18671.ram

also, imo, uk and us techno is similar.  Mainland Europe has a different
style.  Mainland Europe tends to us more strings and horns in their
music.  Uk and us tend to use techno sounds, drums, and vocals.  I'm no
expert but I've lived and partied in Europe for years and that's just my
opinion.  
 
One of my fav mixed sets from this year:
andy_b._jones-in_motion__original_mix
flutlicht - Icarus (Daedalus Mix)
Madelyne_-_Beautiful_Child_(Hiver_&_Hammer_Remix)
Euphonic - Far And Away [Alphazone Remix] 
ian van dahl - will i (flutlicht remix)
Dave Joy - First Impression ( S.h.o.k.k  Mix)
DJ Sequenza - Accept no Limits
Lyala-Time_To_Fly_(Climax69_Mix)_(2003.02.13)
Geilomatics-Geilomat__Wavetraxx_RMX
Look to the Sky (True Color Extended Mix)

(actually, if it's actually looped, it's usually a producer who missed

Actually, my upcoming EP is not "American Techno"... you gotta buy it

 Factor, Scathe :.

What's up Internet Massive?

Hope y'all cats enjoyed your weekend.  I'm in San Francisco right now
tryin to figure out what kinda trouble to get into:)

Anyways, tonight's Dirtbox is gonna be a tight affair.  Check out the
lineup:

07-08pm EST - Evancipation - Our guest host for the night will be droppin'
some dubs and gettin' rowdy like he usually does.

08-09:30pm EST - Known Factor & Relapse - These guys always come with a
tight selection of heavy tunes, and put a lot of energy into their sets.

09:30-11pm EST - Scathe - Scathe rolls with DC's Ohm Resistance, is an
incredibly aggressive DJ, and favors that dark techy shizzle.

11-12:30pm EST - Bizar - This is quite possibly the last time Bizar will
be performing here in the greater Metropolitan area, so expect something
special!

To tune into the madness tonight, head over to
http://dirtboxradio.com/archives.html.  Therein, you'll find links to the
stream, chat, and webcam.

Alright y'all, I gotta get rollin.'  Enjoy the show tonight:)

Respect,
Jackson (ODJ)

that would be me, greg. the illegible signature reads: philip x diaz :-)

the fnf poster is the first of many music and rave-related posters i'll be
doing (all hand-printed, of course).  this poster might be worth some
serious $ in the future. :-)

if anyone else would like a poster, please contact me. i still have a few
left.

don't the A&Hs have those kill switches? for some of
those cuts you can just toggle the kill switches.
that's what turntablists sometimes do on really fast
cuts where there's no slope involved.

that could probably sound pretty good with techno.

it might be worth every penny, but the real question
is, is it worth every giles? we don't exactly grow on
trees. I've only met one other Giles in my life. (he
was a blues guitarist on heroin.)

crossfaders:

   1. "a good workman never blames his tools."

   2. "if it ain't been in a pawn shop, it can't
      play the blues."

and:

   3. in his teen years, Grandmaster Flash was as
      famous in his neighborhood for taking his
      mixers apart and rewiring them as he was for
      using them to play records.

but:

personally, I'll pay $1000 for a mixer when somebody
pays me $1000 to spin. I own a piece of shit $100
Vestax that doesn't even have stereo monitoring, and
I'm proud of it. if you practice on a piece of shit,
you'll have a harder time making your mix CD sound
good, but when you actually get in front of a crowd
and they give you an Allen & Heath or a Rane, you'll
find mixing so much easier than you're used to that
you'll be able to put all that freed-up energy into
your mix, and you can give that energy to the crowd,
instead of wasting it on equipment.

besides, $80 is a lot of records.

come to that, $1000 is two white labels, 100 copies
apiece, and that includes the mastering.


Giles

Ha, ha did you get her number? I wondered what happened to you--I guess I
left right before you did.

Same here, same time frame (11 to 4), and nothing but dancing.

Fortunately, I have learned some stretching techniques from water exercise
classes and I did the ol' calf stretch & hamstring curl during a dance
break.

It paid off! I'm actually not sore today. Plus I didn't drink any alcohol,
and that makes a huge difference.

Dudes ad dudettes,
My legs are F'n sore from that party! 11-4:30: Nothing but dancing! Great
space, great music, great job FnF!
Met a goddess of a woman, too...doesn't get much better of a night than
that!

Until the next party, take care.

I really do not know where to begin. My head is still spinning from the
intense energy of last night's exciting party at SomArts Gallery. I have
never been to an F&F event until now, but I certainly feel like part of the
family today. You can always say, "It's just a party" but the F&F crew put
so much work into this event so it felt like a true production (worth every
penny).

I arrived at 11 p.m. and promptly ran into my dancing buddy, RaVin Riz by
the refreshment stand. He pointed out the beautiful Friends & Family
blacklight poster on sale for 10 bucks, autographed by the artist and
limited to 100 copies. I bought one and I am going to frame it for my
office.

Can anyone tell me who did the F&F artwork for the poster? I cannot read the
autographed name but I have number eight of 100.

After grabbing some H20, I hit the psy-trance dance floor, which had a soft,
bouncy feeling. That was certainly a memorable space because it saved my
joints from aching (danced for 5 hours straight).

The main room nearby had a linoleum tiled floor, not nearly as comfortable
as the psy-trance room, but larger, so I kept running back and forth between
the two arenas. Oh yeah, there was a chill space (large room with coat check
and big-screen theater) in between the dance rooms. The visual entertainment
throughout the venue was stunning. You did not even need psychedelic drugs
to enjoy the sensation. By 4 a.m., several people were just laying on the
floor soaking up the imagery like e-tards.

I must say this: hat's off to the Viberation graphics crew. Good work that
was enjoyed by all (you could tell).

There was another chill room in the gallery space, with beanbag chairs and
other comfortable spots strewn throughout. This was not your every-day chill
room--it was massive with a stage set up for the ambient DJs. I've never
seen a chill room like this, because they also had many Macintoshes set up
for some kind of browsing. How unique and imaginative! And the computers
were getting used throughout the night (not sure what kind of access was
available; I was too busy dancing).

Just outside the chill room, on the outdoor patio, they were broadcasting to
a local station (I think). And they had other entertainment outside but I
missed most of the action.

Can anyone tell me what else was happening outside? It was a popular
gathering place, by 3 a.m. rapidly approaching mini-massive status (people
in every corner). So, I just stayed with my ever-favorite dance mania until
complete exhaustion. Talk about moving your body. I know that I had some
swiveling, hip action!

I thanked AndyW for one important item: the door crew allowed ins and outs,
something that is unheard of at most venues, but it was a lifesaver for me.
I was able to run out to the car, crank up the air conditioning, change
shirts, and head back for more dancing. Usually, at bars and some parties,
the venue owners are so uptight about possible liabilities, i.e. people
going out and getting drugs or off-site drinks, but Andy just said to me:
"We trust our guests" which was memorable.

Thanks, again, F&F.

Greg VP

Greg-

Philip Diaz created the poster you bought. I believe that he is still on 
SFR. (Philip? Earth to Philip?)

It was really awesome to wake up and see such a heartfelt, wonderful review 
of FnF last night. I love it when people realize how much love we put into 
the space, the party, and the vibe- makes everything worthwhile. Also, I 
agree with you completely that we should all take our hats off to the 
Viberation crew, who made one of the coolest chill rooms I've seen in a damn 
long time!

It was great to see you (and everyone else I hadn't seen in a while) again. 
What a night indeed.... *grin*

Becca

For the record when *techno* is mentioned we're talking about the specific

all are. The music you listed is *trance* and not techno. Can't compare
apples to oranges. =)

Actually, I like several different styles (I tend to favor tracks that
are above 135 bpm)
http://www.cuepoint.info/sounds/18876.ram trance/vocal trance

http://www.cuepoint.info/sounds/18890.ram progressive trance (my fav)
http://www.cuepoint.info/sounds/18869.ram
http://www.cuepoint.info/sounds/18671.ram


http://www.cuepoint.info/sounds/18883.ram vocal progressive



also, imo, uk and us techno is similar.  Mainland Europe has a different
style.  Mainland Europe tends to us more strings and horns in their
music.  Uk and us tend to use techno sounds, drums, and vocals.  I'm no
expert but I've lived and partied in Europe for years and that's just my
opinion.

One of my fav mixed sets from this year:
andy_b._jones-in_motion__original_mix
flutlicht - Icarus (Daedalus Mix)
Madelyne_-_Beautiful_Child_(Hiver_&_Hammer_Remix)
Euphonic - Far And Away [Alphazone Remix]
ian van dahl - will i (flutlicht remix)
Dave Joy - First Impression ( S.h.o.k.k  Mix)
DJ Sequenza - Accept no Limits
Lyala-Time_To_Fly_(Climax69_Mix)_(2003.02.13)
Geilomatics-Geilomat__Wavetraxx_RMX
Look to the Sky (True Color Extended Mix)

YAY Cheap American Looped Techno!!!

(actually, if it's actually looped, it's usually a producer who missed
the
point... audio loops lack the subtle changes over periods of time that
define good hypnotic techno).

Actually, my upcoming EP is not "American Techno"... you gotta buy it
import... does that make it Euro enough to be good?

if i'm not mistaken.. techno was the only genre in the

the time it was invented and remember the germans
calling it that.  so forgive me if old habits die
hard.  i still call new cds albums.  there.. i dated

Subject: Proud to be a Part

I am reminded of a shirt which the Davis Food Coop put out about 5 years
back when they were doing some remodeling and making a hell of a lot of
noise and generally annoying those of us who lived in the area.  The
shirts said "Construction 1997:  Proud to be a Part."  While it missed the
mark at the time it's the best summation I can come up with.

I was really PROUD to be a PART.


So where the pictures at?

If I may recommend something absolutely fabulous: The Gotan Project is =
playing at Bimbo's, Tuesday, July 8.
http://www.bimbos365club.com=20


I saw them last night at a 4 day open air music festival in Belgium, =
Rock Werchter, and I must say this project was THE revelation of this =
festival. It was just so beautiful and very danceable, too. Its music =
appealed to every fibre in your body.
Still secretely enjoying this fine hour I experienced last night.

 =20
Any good venues in San Francisco for live concerts to recommend or any =
good concerts between July 11 and July 23? I live in Belgium but will be =
in SanFran next month and am eager to enjoy some good music.

http://www.gotanproject.com/english/gotan_en.htm

Initiated by Philippe Cohen Solal and Edouardo Makaroff in 1999, with =
Christoph H Muller joining immediately, Gotan Project saw the light of =
day with the release of their first 10 inch in February 2000 on Ya =
Basta!, Solal's label.
The project which gathers on record, as well as on stage, top =
Argentinean musicians exiled in Paris, is experiencing an incredible =
international success with the release of their first album "La Revancha =
Del Tango". To date, more than 500 000 records have been sold in Europe. =
Their current live tour is taking them to some of the world's most =
prestigious stages and influential clubs. The show mixes video =
performances of Prisca Lobjoy and the technical skill of gathering =
acoustic musicians alongside machines.

Ok party people,=20

I rarely post negative comments to this list but now it is my turn =
because I am really pissed off tonight.=20

I have something to say to the production crew responsible for Queer as =
Funk. Do not piss off your local dancers. There is nothing more =
frustrating to a dancer then being on the outside of a venue "looking =
in," in this case through locked glass doors, and hearing the pounding =
bass with no access whatsoever due to ridiculous admission prices.=20

I drove over the bridge to San Mateo to The Crowne Plaza hotel, in a =
happy mood because my favorite DJs were spinning (Denise, Dragn'fly, =
Joey Mazzola).=20

I have questions for the DJs: How was the party? Did you have any active =
dancers? Did you sense a good vibe? Please let us know the outcome, =
especially if you have time for some opinions.=20

The immediate vibe at the hotel was extremely negative. For example, =
upon entering the lobby, this particular ballroom was locked off by =
glass doors plastered with Wild 94.9 posters. The doors were guarded by =
security guards and you had to walk around the building (outside) to =
find the entrance.=20

Thereupon you got the familiar search for drugs, weapons, and whatnot, =
and you were pointed to a ticket desk for immediate sticker shock: 40 =
bucks admission, and this was at midnight! (Party ended at 2 am).=20

What can you do at this point but ask politely, "But you only have two =
hours left for your party, do you have a discount?"=20

I have a job. I can afford a 40-dollar party but this did not seem like =
it was worth the time or money (not very many people attending). I was =
extremely pissed off that I drove all the way over there with no clue as =
to the price tag. (Talk about a "gay pride" swindle).=20

Moreover, I am not the only one. I met several ravers in the parking =
lot, most of who were students and we all felt disappointment. The =
ravers left your shitty party and headed to the Castro for some =
excitement. Too bad, because you lost many potential customers.=20

Finally, I talked to a beautiful Asian girl working at the front desk, =
and she wanted to dance, but even she could not gain admission without =
paying the steep price. I told her about SFraves and she appreciated my =
information.=20

In closing, I know from the web site that this event was supposedly for =
charity (the STOP AIDS Project), but I strongly feel that you guys are =
way off the mark on this one, especially with current economic =
conditions.=20

Maybe you are seeking the out of town crowd. I feel like reporting you =
to gay shame, but maybe you just do not know or understand your =
potential audience, the local rave dancers. Oh pardon me, you are The =

  if i'm not mistaken.. techno was the only genre in the

  calling it that.  so forgive me if old habits die

Subject: John '00' Fleming

For all of those who are progressive tranceheads and are 21+, I would highly
recommend coming out to Whisper this Friday and checking out John '00'
Fleming. He is regarded as one of the world's best trance DJs and recording
artists and the proud label owner of J00F Recordings.

A favorite amongst Ibiza clubgoers and a long-time resident for Godskitchen,
Slinky and Gatecrasher, this man does not disappoint! His recent Euphoria
White Label 2 CD release has been compared to the likes of Sasha and
Digweed's Northern Exposure.

Be certain to read his article in the forthcoming September issue of REMIX
Magazine.

You can find out more on John at <http://www.john00fleming.com>

For only $15, you can see him play a 3 hour set at Whisper at 535 Florida
Street at Mariposa. I promise you that you will not be disappointed!

I will also have some copies of the Euphoria album to give away. We'll have
J00F Recording t-shirts as well!

Best regards!

Subject: FnF review..

hmm not sure what to say since most of the people already posted on this 
great party but I will give it a stab..

Right when I step out of the car I see Tina (moonchyld) and crew heading to 
the store for some dranks..   Always good to see a smiling familiar face 
when you first step out of your car..

Saw loads of people I have not seen in years.. And even one friend that I 
have not seen in the past 5 years. Marcos.. He was my first and only light 
guy for alot of my first parties. Also saw alot of the SFR planners etc.. 
Good to see old friends having fun.

The space is just wicked nuff said. Artwork and decor was super awesome the 
Psy trance room reminded me of those old dark warehouse days with lots of 
nice day glow DJ's/Live Pa's etc..

The music was a Mix of Techno,Psy and Downtempo/hip-hop

I had a rockin time everyone was getting down nice Older Ravey Vibe 
refreshing to not run into a lot of pubscent teens explaing how it is the 
first time at a "Rave" and on "E"

Only Complaint about the party and I know this is being DJ bitchy but.. Very 
few of the DJ's were really on beat.. Loads of trainwrecks all over the 
place.. And some were really bad. Know I don't claim to be the most skilled 
beat matcher.. Hell im not very great at beat matching.. But I think it is 
safe to say that I rarely train wreck super hard.. Maybe the phrashing is a 
lil off.. but not two locomotives..


But still a very excellent party to say the least.. One of the few parties 
that I personally will actually attend cause I know the environment will be 
damn good..

If you haven't been to a FnF party well you need to keep your ear to the 
ground and get out to one..


see ya,

Macadio

Subject: Re: [sfraves] :: sfr.house.party :: friday.zero.six.two.seven.zero.three :: pornstar.revelations.four :: thighs.like.butta

Friday was really low key. I wasn't going to complain either since I had to
setup for FnF the next day. It was good seeing a lot of people just hanging
out and chilling. Gorgeous night outside which kept everyone outside most of
the night. Good to finally meet you Fable. I was a tad faded/tired when you
met me so my apologies if I was a bit short-yellow-bus-slow. Now back to
recovering from the weekend.

Subject: **BSP** CD DEMO "6TH DAY"

Well.. I have finally put something together for your audible pleasure..

Got my G4 and Peak and my sound card issues situated so alas after a 3rd 
pass trial I decided to make a mixed CD and it did not come out half bad.. 
It aint perfect by any means but then again.. If I keep trying to work on 
the  "Perfect" mix I will never release jack shit cause all the mixes I do I 
think sound like crap in one way or another..

So with  that.. I will be giving out/mailing my demo to a select few that 
would like a copy The music is "Progressive house" "tribal house" or just 
plain ol funky tribal.. whatever you want to classify it as..

I personally think it is mellow prog house.. not real dark like alot of prog 
but more on the funky side.. Similar to Steve Lawlers "Lights out" series.. 
It does have that small sweaty warehouse sound.

I need to bump the levels and normalize it before release so it may be a few 
days.. But if interested send me a private email and I will give ya the 
details of how it is going to go down.

Also I may have it upped to a friends website so you can DL if you don't 
want to wait on a physical copy.  These will be limited to about 50 CD's or 
so.. Just depends on how fast I can burn them on my supa pimp Lacie drive.

Macadio

it is by a group called e-type but the track name is listed as "volume
1".  I can't find any information about it anywhere so I am questioning
the name.  it is a relatively new song but it has made it's way to the
euro charts.

http://sninesix.dyndns.org/fnf062803/ - pictures from the party. (first =
things first yanno?)

I gotta say all expectations were blown away. I openly admit that I =
wasn't feeling this party like I wanted to prior to it happening. When I =
arrived for setup and saw the sheer amount of gear and production that =
was going into it that changed. Watching the chillroom evolve into that =
schwank-tech-lounge was by far the most impressive part to me. Take that =
chillroom, add a bar, stick it in SOMA and you would have the hottest =
new lounge in SF. Sound was off the hook. Damn! I loved those new =
bassbins that Pascal had. Beyond the sound of them the open driver =
design was just too cool. Overall ambience from the lighting crew was =
well thought out and fit the respective rooms quite well. The EL archway =
install looked great and was well worth the effort it took in digging =
the ditches and wiring them up. Look at the pictures to see that massive =
rats nest of wiring to understand what I mean. Oh I really liked the =
giant balloons in the black room. Nice interaction with the projections. =
Dave's LocalTalk Lounge was a big success! So many people would walk by =
and wonder what we were doing and were surprised to find out the =
machines were all networked. Some funny as hell conversations going on!

Music wise I was all over the chillroom that night. Brian and Larry's =
set seemed to fit my relaxed mood that night. Very impressed with how =
well the live soundtrack they produced went with Hero. I need to see =
that movie in its entirety now too. Ambient Mafia came through with a =
chill vengence. It was good to seem Boomy back behind the decks again. =
The only sets in the main rooms I heard were Miranda's and Ethan's and =
both were great. I didn't hear any trainwrecks while I was in there for =
their sets. That was my only gripe with the music. I heard a lot of =
trainwrecking that night. Was rather surprised by that.

Overall it was a very diverse crowd. Great amount of energy with a super =
friendly feeling. I had one girl come up to me and tell me that she knew =
me. Then proceeds to tell me that we went to high school together. =
Scary. 10 years later I run into a girl that I never associated with and =
she's now married with 4 kids. There were quite a few reconnections for =
me that night. Made for a wonderful evening amoungst friends. It seemed =
like everyone came out for this event. Michael the Red Stickman even =
sucked it up and came out and he's sick with the flu. It was just that =
kind of party. Awesome work and I hope to see something like this again =
sooner rather than another 3 years later. =3D)

yeah, the chill room was the most expansive i'd ever seen !  terry and =
the viberation visuals crew turned it out again... and the ambient =
lighting was perfect... all set against the backdrop of the current =
gallery installation in that room made it a treat.  3 c-trl se/30's in =
each corner of the h u g e room kinda brought the 4 corners a bit more =
together i thought.  the many glowing faces that took the effort to =
express how much they enjoyed C-TRL Localtalk Lounge and concept made it =
all worth it for me.  big ups to t-dawg tyler for helping me with setup =
!  the other rooms were also nicely sweetened ... although, like most, =
the chill room was dole'n out the yummy vibe morsels of choice for me.  =
the Hero piece was cast over the room like a raver net that nobody could =
escape from !  and i can't forget the volunteers who prepared all the =
yummy fruits and refreshments - saints - fresh plumbs and strawberries - =
yumm :)   one of those nights everyone will remember.

  http://sninesix.dyndns.org/fnf062803/ - pictures from the party. =
(first things first yanno?)

  I gotta say all expectations were blown away. I openly admit that I =
wasn't feeling this party like I wanted to prior to it happening. When I =
arrived for setup and saw the sheer amount of gear and production that =
was going into it that changed. Watching the chillroom evolve into that =
schwank-tech-lounge was by far the most impressive part to me. Take that =
chillroom, add a bar, stick it in SOMA and you would have the hottest =
new lounge in SF. Sound was off the hook. Damn! I loved those new =
bassbins that Pascal had. Beyond the sound of them the open driver =
design was just too cool. Overall ambience from the lighting crew was =
well thought out and fit the respective rooms quite well. The EL archway =
install looked great and was well worth the effort it took in digging =
the ditches and wiring them up. Look at the pictures to see that massive =
rats nest of wiring to understand what I mean. Oh I really liked the =
giant balloons in the black room. Nice interaction with the projections. =
Dave's LocalTalk Lounge was a big success! So many people would walk by =
and wonder what we were doing and were surprised to find out the =
machines were all networked. Some funny as hell conversations going on!

  Music wise I was all over the chillroom that night. Brian and Larry's =
set seemed to fit my relaxed mood that night. Very impressed with how =
well the live soundtrack they produced went with Hero. I need to see =
that movie in its entirety now too. Ambient Mafia came through with a =
chill vengence. It was good to seem Boomy back behind the decks again. =
The only sets in the main rooms I heard were Miranda's and Ethan's and =
both were great. I didn't hear any trainwrecks while I was in there for =
their sets. That was my only gripe with the music. I heard a lot of =
trainwrecking that night. Was rather surprised by that.

  Overall it was a very diverse crowd. Great amount of energy with a =
super friendly feeling. I had one girl come up to me and tell me that =
she knew me. Then proceeds to tell me that we went to high school =
together. Scary. 10 years later I run into a girl that I never =
associated with and she's now married with 4 kids. There were quite a =
few reconnections for me that night. Made for a wonderful evening =
amoungst friends. It seemed like everyone came out for this event. =
Michael the Red Stickman even sucked it up and came out and he's sick =
with the flu. It was just that kind of party. Awesome work and I hope to =
see something like this again sooner rather than another 3 years later. =
