Hey Y'all,

Some interesting non-rave stuff that some of you may be interested
in.

By the way did anyone go to see Terence McKenna.  I had to work so I
couldn't go but I heard 1996 was gonna be a wild year (according to
T. McK's mathematical forumula!!!).  If you went, drop me a quick note
on your impressions.

mind?

doesn't that make you feel terrific?

this is in response to whoever asked (sorry deleted it) about t.m. at
cowel theatre s.f. last nite.

if you've read "invisible landscape" and already know about the "timewave
zero" theory, this event wouldn't give you much.  basically terrence, with the
aid of a netscape browser talked about his fractal time theory and how to use
it to predict "novelty"  next year being a big year for change/novelty.

 My mother-in-law just called my wife to chat - the first thing she mentioned
was hearing about "a rave in Richmond" where some bad acid had been sold
and 6 people had been taken to the hospital. My wife was able to assure
my mother-in-law that I had spent a safe , albeit blah , day at work
this Sunday. 

 Which rave is this? If anyone was there - was it the psychological 
space ( ie - "bad vibes" ) ? Or could it actually be a screwed-up batch
of A? Maybe it was bunk E? The news media may not have had the substance
involved described properly. 

 I hope those folks who bummed out are OK ...

Well, if the rave in question was the Sunset that happened a few hours ago, 
let me assure you that it must have been some bad acid, cause the vibe itself
was great. 

If anyone hears anything through the news media, please post specifics to 
the list, as I am too bone tired to sit through an hour of "you have 
questions, KPIX five has answers", and by tomorrow, I'm sure it will be 
old-forgotten news. Thanx.

For those of you interested in a topic I've been for twenty years or more, take a look at my High Times article on www at
http://hyperreal.com/island/DOCS/purity.html. Writen in 1977, it chronicles the story of "bad acid." I'm working on an update so if anyone has information, you can send it to me.

The rave referred to was Cyberfest(in Oakland).  I heard rumors today
of 12-16 people taken to the hospital for "overdoses."  Out of over
10,000 peeps though, that's not a shocker.  Who knows what they had,
maybe some just freaked out.

I'll post more on the subject, as I know your all dying to hear about
Cyberfest(I can hear you groaning).

I heard it on the radio, KCBS, on the way over to sunset (I was
listening for a traffic report, trying to figure out why I was going 10
MPH on the freeway....)

They mentioned that 20 "drug overdoses" had taken place at a large
"rave party" in Oakland on Saturday night. They had some paramedic or
something on  the air talking about how he had to help two "20 year old
girls" that were lying in the street screaming hysterically. They
blamed it on a batch of "liquid acid" that was going around.

IMHO, a bad trip is guaranteed at any >1000 person rave with the
name "cyber" in it...

I don't do acid but I've observed its effects up close for a long time.
Dosage control with the liquid form is obviously difficult, and anonymous
self-reporting I've seen indicates that the experience is much more vivid,
perhaps because there are no delivery contaminants as there are with tabs,
for example.  In several instances I observed, the "screaming hysterically"
part occurred but the individuals had no recollection of that afterwards,
reporting a dreamlike and rather pleasant state.  There seems to be some
sort of threshhold effect where a complete personality dissociation occursm,
leaving a conflicted/agonized/terrified surface which seems unchecked by
the usual conscious restraints, while the rest of the mind is off exploring
on its own plane.  

I don't have any real expertise in the psychopharmacology of acid, so if
someone does and can provide more of an explanation of that, I'd be
interested.  All I can say is that, although some people I've known stopped
taking acid after a bad trip, I can't think of any who thought it was 
anything less than an amazing experience.  I would caution against extending
that kind of anecdotal evidence to broader conclusions, but let's just say
my view of acid's toxicity and mental damage is far different based on those
kinds of self-reports than, say, alcohol, nicotine, cocaine or speed.

As proven again and again since acid went into general public circulation
in the mid-1960s, the best treatment for a bad trip is to remove excess
visual and auditory stimuli, provide plenty of human contact and have
lots of patience.  It is a very wearing experience to help someone through
a bad trip, but it's a worthwhile one.  The one thing I'm always afraid
of in those circumstances is that it's not acid at all but some other
substance (oh, the bad trips I've seen from PCP "back in the day", yow!!).

Any large-scale public event like a Cool World really ought to have
trained people available to help with this.  About the worst thing you
can do with someone on a bad trip is shove them into a police car or
ambulance and take them to a bright, sterile, unfamiliar place where
linear thinking and responsiveness are the only criteria, and where
very powerful relaxant and other drugs that are totally unnecessary
may be administered because the people don't understand how to deal
with bad trips and distinguish between acid trips and other kinds.

I've seen bad acid trips in the very Kaiser Auditorium where Cool World
was, back when the Grateful Dead used to play there.  The Dead scene
developed a whole ethos around acid, and bad trips as one part of that,
and the presence of not only Rock Med but people knowledgeable from
experience or hearsay about the stages of a trip helped minimize serious
problems over the year.  I mean, when someone takes off all their clothes
in the middle of "Scarlet Begonias" and starts flailing, what do you do
if you *don't* know what to do, right?  But the Deadheads, especially
the earlier crew, knew what to do and we can learn from that.

Actually,  SPAZ wasn't such a bad thing after all. ...

We all snuck into the "secret site" around 12ish and were in this really cool
boiler room waiting for the music to play.   Unfortunatlly as Larry said
someone broke the generator and after chatting befriending several people I
left @ around 3.  Although the event itself didn't occur, it still was A
great time.....

helping someone through a bad trip really can be a tough, tiring 
expreience, especially if you are on acid yourself... in a way bad trips 
can be contagious. i agree that it would help to have people who know the 
effects of acid (both good and bad) around to help people out at any party.
but that isn't always possible for various reasons. i also agree that the 
best thing to do it to talk someone out of it, to look into their eyes 
and remind them that as a drug of the mind and consciousness, the entire 
trip is under there control- they can take it where they want it. one 
thing though, suprisingly, can bring anyone off a trip completely. it is 
a very basic drink - milk.

And I thought the only bad trips were those of us "imagining" just how
wonderful any rave with multipage flyers and the name "cyber" would be ;-)


If all that happened were "bad trips" and not deaths, then I for one consider
such a large gathering of people with such diverse backgrounds, expectations,
and experience lucky... I've noted in the past a VERY high volume of people
attending such gatherings who are wanna be ravers.... but have NEVER 
heard of Sunsets, Basics, F&F, Harmonys or even Wicked...  There were people
walking up and down the mall at my school ( College of San Mateo ) handing
out flyers for Cyberfest to anyone who was dressed like MTV hip-hoppers ( or
what-ever they might be refered to )... and I can attest to the fact that
these people are very unaware of the wonderful rave underground of the SF 
area.... Too bad really cause many of them could add "new blood" to the vibe.

That's one thing I could never understand is how people can let LSD 
control them.  It is all in the mind.  I have "talked" myself out of 
numerous bad trips and talked myself out of getting physically ill.  I 
just say to myself "it's all in your mind, Amy" then it magically 
disappears after a few long relaxed breaths.  Do others just not have the 
mind control? Or am I an exception?  I've heard of people not liking LSD 
because they feel they 
lack control.  I feel MOST in control - it's kind of like lucid dreaming...
 
ps - David, do please tell all about Cruel - er - I mean Cool World.  And 
SUNSET reports!! Where was it at? Berkeley?  Is it much colder there now?

Sounds like that advertizing firm should get on this idea quick for a 
"got milk" commercial. Hapless tripper spewing brain salad about the 
great upcoming celestial exstarvaganza and the amazing portent and
auspices of the alignment of the stars.... Straightjacket is put on ...
"got milk" ??

(NOT).

More to the point w/r/t other's comments:

(1) "rock med" will not give out any drugs whatsoever (not even
aspirin) because they're worried about liability and drug interaction.
they will hold your hand and talk you through it. (You're better off
having a friend around anyways, or someone that actually gives a shit
about you).

(2) someone made a comment about the sterility and linear thinking of
the emergency room.... i have a few doctor friends that relate their
point of view on this stuff -- i.e. why they may be a bit less
helpful/caring than you want them to be. They tend to regard these
sorts of drug-inflicted injuries as something that they didn't need to
be treating in the first place... it's not like they wanted to be woken
up, popped out of their hot tub, or spending  time with their lovely
doctor's wives/husbands rather than looking at yer twisted angst-ridden
face and listening to yer rantings... all for something that was made
illegal for a reason -- because too many people are too lame to use  a
drug that powerful responsibly. You might want to remember that next
time you're chugging acid out of the visine bottle, or next time you
decide to eat a whole sheet of blotter because you want to show your
friends how burly you are... (granted that's not the only way these
things happen, then again, too often it is...).

(Again, the above is often the "doctors" point of view -- most doctors
are hypocrites about the hypocratic oath and will treat clogged
arteries with great care (which ultimately is also a self-inflicted
injury) whereas they'll probably treat you with a lot less respect if
you've taken illegal drugs and now need their help to extricate
yourself from your problem).

(3) acid is a loaded gun, serious drugs, not candy! Unfortunately
people rarely give it the respect it is due, until they have their own
first bad trip. If they still have a brain (or had one in the first
place) they may go back and figure out "what went wrong" and not repeat
their mistakes again. To this end, anybody with a clue would know to
(a) avoid cool/cyber world at all costs; (b) ferchrissakes, remember
the importance of set and setting, and  consider that cool/cyber world
are neither good set (as in baaaaad stooopid vibe), nor good setting.

(4) someone said that "screaming hysterically" was often a result of
taking a lot of acid, the result of some kind of dissociative trip
where you don't actually feel like you're screaming on the inside.
That's ridiculous. Even if true, why would you want this kind of trip
while you're at a rave --  save these sorts of trips for a time when
you can give your own navel a serious self-examination with other
supportive friends. Why on earth people would want to take that much
acid at a place like cool world is totally beyond me. Then again, in a
past life as an occasional deadhead, i've watched people do stupid
things with acid there too -- like taking 10 hits before a show...

 You may have some doubts about someone that turns into full on

This morning on the front page of the Bay Area section of the Chronicle 
is a report on 16 Overdoses over the weekend on LSD and Ecstacy.  It is a 
brief blurb of pretty much what everyone has already said.  The 
newspaper never really says which drug caused any of the overdoses and 
they refer to multiple "illegal" rave-type parties over the weekend.  I 
never quite got what they meant as an "overdose".  I think the story is
a bit unclear, lacks info., and is kind of a scare tactic, but then 
again, drugs are a scary thing to many.  Anyways, check it out if you are 
interested.

XXOO,
kirsten

Neils, I don't quite understand your attitude on this.  It's not that
someone would WANT the dissociative-trip experience  . . . it's something
that *happens*.

Went to Zendada (in the basement of 1015) on Friday.

The music was great:  Tracy played the sweetest set with lots of
cool vocals.  Taj's set was interesting;  he was mixing a lot funky
house in with (his usual) low sounding progressive stuff.  If you
haven't heard them lately, you should check out these two.

I found it interesting that the profile of this gig has significantly
changed since the summer.  And the change is definitely for the
better.  The size was perfect: enough people to create a good vibe but
not crowded at all.  And it was very sober.  People were actually
listening and paying attention to the music.

Another fine weekend with the Pacific sound system.  First on
Saturday with the mini rave adjunct to the Hemp festival at the
civic center.  I managed to twitch along to the first DJ's
Jungle set, but things really took off when Tony took the helm,
followed by more greatness from Garth, Solar and then Jeno.
One thing I notice about Jeno's set is how the instant he came
on the music suddenly sounded more crisp and punchy.  I don't
think he messed with the EQ.  It just seems that he often picks
records that are recorded in a certain way.

I don't want to bore with another redundant sunset review, so
just a few notes:  Although it was in Richmond again, they
shifted the location more to the park's center.  More shade, more
grass - good move.  I thought Tracy *really* tore it up.  Also,
that was two Pacific parties in a row that Galen - owner of
the sound system - did not spin at in order to make room for
other Djs.  In his own quiet way, he is one classy guy.

Got to meet Black Adder and Reagan Reid (love the way that name
rolls off my tongue) for the first time. :)

We hope to see some of you at Splish.

Lee

Well, I've had a few hairy experiences on acid and have almost lost it, but
I can usually get myself out of it by finding something to concentrate on,
like drawing.  Not long ago I experienced an evil panic spiral on a trip
and only just managed to get myself out of it ... you should SEE the
pictures that emerged from my wobbling mind!!!  :)

I think some people do have better control over their minds than others ...
but I think it can go the other way and people can be TOO MUCH in control
... and since acid DOES require that you let go of yourself a little, that
can also be a bad thing.

It all depends on the person and the situation.  That's why, although I've
frequently entertained the notion of slipping acid on someone who didn't
know, I'd NEVER do it.  It's entirely too cruel.  But imagining the
consequences is amusing .... ;)

Hello all SFR folks!,

I am happy to give rides to folks whenever it's convenient, *however* you 
*must* pick up that ancient apparatus called a telephone and dial my number!!!  
;-)  You see, my only computer access and e-mail account right now is at work.  
Logical conclusion...I can't retrieve my messages or pleas for help or rides 
after I leave work at 5:30 or anytime on the weekends.  The only time I read my 
e-mail is when I'm here.  So, trying to reach a possible ride at 10:00 on 
Friday night won't work for me unless you call me.  

On weekdays, it's rare that I go out unless I make a plan to do so ahead of 
time.  So, if you want to go to an event during the week, you need to either 
post well before 5:30 or call me no later than 7 or 8 (if you're only calling 
for a ride) otherwise you can call up til 10:30.   

Fridays and Saturdays you can probably reach me reasonably late at home, but 
it's always best to post or call a few days ahead of time if you are 
anticipating needing a ride.  For my housemates sake though, please don't call 
after 11.   You can also call me for weekend daytime raves.

If you would like my phone number, just ask.  I live in Oakland, so only nearby 
folks please, or people willing to BART/bus it first then get ride. 

Sendin' out smiles

Rikki

To sfravers. $2 admission tonight if you mention sfraves. Free vegetarian
food at 11:30ish.The founding idea  of  the gardening club is to ask Dj's
to bring down music they would play to their friends on a hazy Sunday
morning after a mad night, they are requested not to play anything that is
in their sets at that time insuring different and diverse music each week.
All monnies taken on the door is evenly distributed amongst everyone who
works at TGC, so door people earn the same as a DJ.
Thanks for use of sfraves as a communication mediam for spreading the word.

Err. Yeah like the first thing I'd want on a bad trip is milk from a cow

Here's a quick scene report / sermon from the weekend. Take from it what 
you will.

I was in my place durng Garth's set and the free Gathering this Saturday, 
exit stage left, basically wondering about how for some of the people 
around me this was not their first rave, and it showed, and for a lot more 
this was their first rave,(( "Look Tities!")) and how that showed. 
I mean, even though the drug culture is compatable it doesn't nessearilly 
mean any rave ideolgy is also. Case in point is the story that  
follows. the cast of characters consists of :

(8 year old?) toddler
(teenage) Skater Prick
and a sea of apathetic stoned teens.

So anyway, as I was experiencing the moment my spidey sense was picking 
up on this situation that was developing to my right. Skater Prick was 
off to my side, kind of on the outskits of the main energy around the DJ, 
and sort of roughhousing with this Kid. Having a kid brother 10 years my 
junior I know what it's like to roughhouse but even so I noticed that 
Skater Prick was being pretty calous, tossing the kid up in the air and 
then walking back to his skater friends to Be Cool. It was a roughhousing 
without hugs or roughhousing for aperances sake.
 
Now the Kid seemed to have some kind of unresolved conflict that he 
wasn't about to let go. As soon as Skater Prick turned his back the Kid 
collected a handfull of grass and pegged Skater Prick in the face. 
Friends laughed, and Skater Prick looked stupid for a moment before grabbing 
the Kid, shaking him some, shoving him away and moving back to his 
friends, with a "Don't throw shit at me you little Fucker!". I was 
planning on saying something along the lines of "Maybe you should give 
him a hug instead." to Skater Prick, but the moment escaped me.

Now, somehow the Kid managed to get some piece of trash, like a small wood 
block, and clocked Skater Prick again, this time upside the head with a 
load "whack!" the Kid than booked into the crowd and Skater Prick lunged 
after him, grabing this person a fifth of his size and screaming 
something like "Now you're gonna get motherfucker!"

Now, by nature I have a very non-confrantational personality, and 
interfering in a domestic situation that you know nothing about is not a 
very good idea. Even so, for obvious reasons, I moved down on my knees so 
that I was at eye level with the kid and between the two. The Kid 
seemed mildly hysterical so when I looked up to ask Skater Prick, who had 
moved back a bit at this point, whether this was his kid brother or his 
kid, or whatever, he just shruged and said that the Kid was with another 
group. Some teenage chick who was getting together with one of the other 
skaters then came by to take the Kid and then relcutantlly picked him up 
and sat him next to the wall before going back to her man. Skater Prick 
let it go at that. 

I kept my sitting position on the floor for a good time, pretty upset 
with the fact that a potentialy violent situation almost erupted in front 
of me and that no one else around me seemed to care. I sat there for a while 
until most of the players had moved off to their respective corners, the 
Kid up on the wall and Skater Prick off to olie with his friends. 

It's been a while since I've had to play Hall Monitor, I hate that job then 
and now because at best all it seems to do is prolong the inevitable. 
Fucked-up white trash kids will still go home to their fucked-up 
unsuprivised homes. Sometimes all you can hope for is that your actions can 
set an example.

I sat for a while and looked around at my neighboors, the majority of 
whom were doing the Kickbox-at-the-person-next-to-you-without-ever-making-
eye-contact dance, or some variation of it. I sat there for a while, 
protesting the situation that had occured until I felt it was OK to get 
up and move again. 

Sometimes the Enemy is some faceless goverment force that has only 
it's best interests in mind and sometimes the Enemy is that person 
standing right next to you among this hip underground youth culture that 
everyone is so damn proud of. I guess that one of my  points is that in 
exchange for having this great unsuprivised scene we are *all* expected 
to take a little bit of responsiblity for one another. 

Besides that incident Saturday turned out to be a rather nice day.

Live & learn.

> that *happens*.  

My attitude on this is that a bunch of people that can't handle their
drugs are making raving associated with stupidity, drug abuse, and are
helping enforce the public opinion that there is no possible good use
for "A" and that any use at all is dangerous and foolhardy, right up
there with PCP and injecting heroin.

Maybe you didn't get to hear the embarrassing radio reports. On the
other hand, perhaps you'll now be less willing to admit that you're
going to a rave because your non-raver/coworker acquaintences will
immediately say -- "hey, isn't that one of those things where kids get
all hopped up on goof balls then have to call the paramedics cuz their
so completely out of their heads?"...

W/r/t my claiming the dissociative-trip experience (hey isn't that a
60's band??) was "ridiculous" -- i meant that it's ridiculous that
people would want to get themselves into that territory at a very
large, very impersonal, and very zoo-like rave. (again, a sign of
stupidity, inexperience, and cruelty on the part of the vendors)... i
personally don't think that such a reaction is easy to reach with "1
hit", assuming it's really just a 100 ug hit, and assuming that the
person hasn't ingested any other substances. 1 hit of acid + smoking
lots of pot, and/or opium, and/or cocaine is something that can put you
in the danger zone no matter what, or so I've seen from watching other
people "lose it" in college and at dead shows.

Otherwise my attitude comes from the fact that i can still picture
people that I knew in college  who are no longer with us, either
physically or just mentally... and it's not a pretty picture.

since the top of the week seems to be acid trips here's the one that ended
my use of acid,,,,,
  about a year ago Me and some friends purchased the famed "black Gel Caps"
we asat down took the gel caps (i took 1 and a 1/2 not a large dose)and
proceeded to watch disney's Alice in Wonderland (we were just goin to
hangout at home and have a good time) well after watching thee Adventures
of alice...we decided that the story mirrored life and death and that life
was a VICIOUS CIRCLE and for the rest of the trip everything led back to
this vicious circle and it got rteal scarey....now we're not junkies or
anything(the first step is denial Ha HA real funny,but seriously
folks....)We wentt out of our minds  We Drank Milk...We were in Familier
surroundings but bad shit is bad shit...

The conclusion is that after that I did acid one more time ( I always get
real powerful ShiT) AND GOT SUPER MICRODOT OR WHATEVER AND BLAZED FOR A
GOOD 16 HOURS OF UNCONTROLABLE HALLUCINATION  AT a wack rave that made me
hate Demigod for all eternity...so now I if I have the desire to "see
things" AND CAN'T TALK MYSELF INTO IT...I take shrooms (the safe and
natrual alternative)...why anyone likes to take 8 doses of e or eat an
entire sheet of blotter(STUPID!!!)is beyond me..That is straight abuse and
to those that know we should educate and stop the ABUSE IF you are using
you should use responsibly and know your limits. and to those that don't
use and are str8 edge let's all be cool with that...they are on the best
trip of all....

LSD is an extract from a naturally occurring substance, ergot. :)

But you are correct in that people do take TONS of drugs to get COMPLETELY
wacked out.  I see no point in being so high that I can't move, speak, or
see ... but have you noticed that most (and I do stress MOST) ppl who do
these high amounts of drugs tend to be rather irresponsible when it comes
to the rest of their lives as well?

I think the cow's milk thing is hooey.

I've eaten a lot of ice cream (half a pint container of Ben & Jerry's cookie 
dough) on a certain fateful evening, and it didn't interrupt or stop anything 
one bit.  It tasted great, and it felt really funny (in a happy, giggly way) 
going down.

I've eaten bowls of Captain Crunch with Crunchberries (love those flourescent 
pink crunchy puff balls of sugar) with lots of milk and it didn't change 
anything either.

I've also heard that vitamin b-12 and/or niacin will stop a trip.  Well, not in 
any dose of B-12 or Niacin that I've ever ingested.

Whoever said that getting in a calm place away from aural or visual 
overstimulation was on the right track.  A nice warm (not hot) bath and being 
tucked in under a fluffy comforter works a lot better than milk or B vitamins.

Frankly, the last liquid I could think of imibing while too high would be 
milk.  Yuck.  But to make it less disgusting, would organic milk be more 
acceptable? (not that you can walk into any old store and get it, but...) I 
wonder if you could get the same results with soy or rice milk.  What compounds 
in milk help eliminate the bad trip?  Maybe its just the calcium or protein or 
something else easily found for example in a vitamin and mineral supplement.  
Hmmm, this requires more research.  I'd love to know if it were true.  It'd be 
a big drag if you were at Sunset, nowhere near a store, too tweaked to drive 
and you had a bad trip...will people start bringing milk in coolers?  (The cops 
show up, "oh what an unusually wholesome bunch of kids.  I'll have to intoduce 
my daughter to these people!") ;-)   I wonder what bartenders would say if you 
asked for a glass of milk at a club?  Yep, they'd probably think you were 
pretty darn high.

I'm certain there are fairly basic compounds out there to help eliminate a bad 
trip.  Should I make it a mission to find out for the betterment and health of 
all ravers worldwide?  As far as bad trips go physically (your grim feeling 
stomach) I know there are several homeopathic methods you can aquire thru herb 
stores, accupuncturists, chiropracters, etc., that can calm a nauseous tummy.   
Also, I don't think having a bad physical trip can always be overcome by mind 
over matter.   Some drugs carry very bad additives that would make you feel 
like crap regardless.  I know some of the less pure L is cut with certain 
things things that always give me a lower back ache due to my kidneys trying to 
filter out the poisons.  Nothing can be done about that except not doing L or 
making sure one  only gets the good stuff (which is impossible to ensure).

My 2 worth.

First, as a disclaimer, I'd like to say that I only went to Cyberfest 
because I got a free ticket through the radio station I dj at.  I only 
had one ticket, and NONE of my friends wanted to pay $25, so I had to go 
alone :(

Some quick impressions:
-20,000 people and NO PARKING LOT!
-Live rapping over really bad house music! (inside)
-Bongos AND a live drum set playing over really bad house music! (outside)

WHAT ARE THESE PEOPLE THINKING?????

Actually, the dj who came on after Fungo Mungo inside started his set 
with four totally sick acid breakbeat tracks, then lapsed into boring, 
cheesy, techno-housy music.  Why does this always seem to happen?  I also 
caught the beginning of Garth's set outside, and he played about 3 or 4 
killer tracks before lapsing into the boring abyss of non-descript house 
music (or so it sounds to me).

A final word:
Are there really this many ravers in the Bay Area, or did people drop in 
from outer space for this rave?  There was no place to MOVE on either the 
inside or outside dancefloors.

Another final word (of advice):
DON'T BUY DRUGS FROM SOMEONE YOU DON'T KNOW!!!

over and out,
Seth

Regarding the talk about being able to talk yourself out of an acid trip....

It is possible to get to a state where you lose most or all of your points
of reference.  I have personnaly been in a place with *no* points of
reference.  There was no such thing as anything.  There was no way at the
time to talk my way out of or into anything, because there really was
nothing.   That may be a little hard to fathom, but I had to use every part
of my Will to get out of there.  The only thing I had was some small amount
of memory of a place with floors and trees and worlds and stuff, and I knew
that I could thought manifest.  So I decided to create a world.  Boy was I
naive.  Since I had little or no thought control at the time as soon as I
started to think the world into existance, some thought about colors brought
up another thought of the "Windows" color scheme "Hotdog Stand".  The
unwanted thoughts came in as the World was being created and I found myself
standing on a black paved street that was all greasy like the stuff you find
behind a fryer at McD's.  The buildings and sky and everything were bright
yellow and red and it smelled really bad.  No green, no plants, no blue sky
(I think it was black).  I completely thought I would never get back.  There
was no thought or recollection that "A" had assisted me in getting there.  I
messed up things on the inner planes of my being, and those screw-up's
manifested in my physical reality over the next week or so.  Lucky some
friends from a past life in Egypt mummified me and put me in a pyramid so my
thoughts would stay contained and not fuck up the rest of the world.
Eventually I woke up and unzipped the tent to see the world was still there
and everything was beautiful.  I only took one little square too.  A friend
took the same stuff and was fine, except for trying to deal with me had it's

the last time I ever take it.  The lesson I learned was that I need to gain
alot more control over my thoughts than I had at the time.  I have since
done that, but still don't know if I'll ever do A again.   My point is, you

doesnt ~really~ sound like ~a rave~ at all.  and i wouldnt 
classify those 20,000 as ravers.  i dont know anyone around here
who raves that went, so i would say there are 20,000 non-ravers
in this area.

     One of the joys of sitting on a mailing list (off and on) for three 
     years or so is the cycle of discussions and the way the same 
     (mis)information gets posted again and again and discussed again and 
     again.
     
     Yes, it's educational for all, don't start flaming me now for what I 
     just said...my point is that for some reason what I just said puts me 
     in a frame of mind that makes the following an appropriate post to the 
     sfraves list.
     
     Enjoy,

     **********************************************************************
     PSHIFT(1)       USER COMMANDS   PSHIFT(1)
     
     NAME
     pshift - paradigm shift utility
     
     SYNOPSIS
     pshift [-zzeitgeist] [-rragelev] [-v] [-c] [-wn] [+|-n]
     
     DESCRIPTION
     The pshift operator performs a paradigm shift on its input stream 
     within the context of the current or specified zeitgeist.
     
     OPTIONS
     -z      Specify the zeitgeist context.  May be specified here or
     from the environment variable $ZEITGEIST.
     
     Supported values of zeitgeist are judeo_christian (default), 
     postcommunist, new_age, and when_god_was_a_woman.
     
     -r      Specify rage level. Acceptable values of ragelev are
     ennui (default), deep_seated, and consuming.
     
     -v      Set to verbose mode.  Normally pshift operates silently;
     in verbose mode it publishes a 500+ page bestseller entitled 
     "Rethinking [input stream] in the [zeitgeist] Age", and then begins 
     soliciting honoraria until the operator types ctrl-c.
     On some systems it runs for Congress.
     
     -c      Set to collective IO.  Normally pshift takes its input
     from stdin and outputs to stdout;  in collective mode it takes its 
     input from the Collective Unconscious and writes to the Body Politic.
     
     -wn     Specify first, second, third or fourth wave.  Acceptable
     values for n are 0,1,2 or 3, with 2 (third wave) being the default.
     
     [On Sun systems, the logical waves are 0,3,2,1, which map to physical 
     waves 0,1,2,3; see Sun Technical Manual for details.]
     
     +|-n    Specifies the number of times to prepend 'post' to the
     zeitgeist context, if positive, or 'pre' if negative. The default is 
     11.
     
     EXAMPLES
     
     source $DEITY | pshift -zpostcommunist -rdeep_seated -v +1
     
     On most systems, the above command will output a hardcover volume 
     called "Rethinking God in the Post-Postcommunist Era", in which the 
     irrelevence of erstwhile religious concepts is seen to have triggered 
     a global, deep-seated rage vis-a-vis traditional sociopolitical norms 
     leading to a premature breakdown of emerging postsoviet 
     infrastructure.
     
     pshift -znew_age -rennui
     
     The above command produces no output, but privately processes a vague 
     discontent which it will share if its space is honored. May be 
     redirected to /dev/null.
     
     pshift -c -w3 -1
     
     Taking its input from the collective unconscious, the above command 
     rejects the failed socioeconomic policies of the last thirty years and 
     replaces them with a futurist, fourth wave polemic of traditional 
     values, the two-parent family, and the supremacy of the private sector 
     that was the foundation of the American utopia of the 1950s.  Use a 
     prepend value of -2 to restore the American utopia of the early 
     Industrial Age, a value of -3 to restore the European utopia of the 
     Enlightenment, -4 for catholic hegemony, etc.
     
     (note:  Requires grass root permission.  In verbose mode, it may also 
     require a $4 million advance.)
     
     SEE ALSO
     backlash(1)
     
     BUGS
     You must have root permission to use consuming rage.

I listen to Live 105 on the radio a lot, and Cyberfest was prominently promoted 
there.  Steve Masters, a (sort of ex-) Live 105 DJ, was one of the Cyberfest 
DJs, so of course Live 105 was pushing it with recorded ads, live spot ads, and 
giveaways of tickets.  

Now before you go slagging on Steve, let me just say that about a month ago he 
played SPAZ's "Space Music for Fluffheads" on his Sunday night show, and would 
throw on Future Sound of London tracks every now and again on his regular 
weekday show.

But anyway, between massive flyering, advertising on *at least* Live 105, and 
selling tickets through Bass (or was it Ticketron, or are they one and the same 
now?) this party got a LOT of promotion and exposure in circles where people 
don't usually listen to house or techno, and where people might not have any 
raver friends.  The idea of a rave appealed to 20,000 people for whatever reason
(maybe for some it was the "21-and-over-bar-tent"), so they came out to the 
party.  It does boggle the mind, though.

Imagine how cool it would have been if it had been 20,000 people, fabulous 
mind-opening music, and no "bad acid."  That could have been amazing...but 
concern for pleasing (pacifying?) that large a group and for making a profit (by
those who were peddling crap chemicals) resulted in something that rave-purists 
consider a pale reflection on what is and what could be.

I don't think the idea of a 20,000 person party is bad...I've heard first-hand 
accounts from the "old days" in England of good parties.  However, this isn't 
the "old days"...economies of scale and the influx of dealers who are after a 
buck rather than providing a service for their friends appear to make the good 
huge party an impossibility in San Francisco.

I did go to a good very large party, in January at Area 51.  That wasn't 20,000 
people, though!

In some cases people aren't aware of the dangers of over-use and in
others they pooh-pooh it, it's kind of hard to imagine a bad trip if
you haven't been on one, I guess.

But I'll certainly agree that there needs to be more awareness of the
issues and risks, which probably means overall somewhat less consumption.
And in cases like crystal, a consumption line diminishing toward zero iun
our scene would be very welcome.

i know that if you are having a bad trip milk is not a very appetizing 
idea, and i can't really fix all the nasty stuff that goes into suposedly 
natural milk. i just mentioned that fact because it might come useful to 
someone.

i'm not sure what it is about milk that makes it delete an acid trip, i'm 
not even sure if it works for everyone... given the responses to my 
message. all i know is that once i was dosed and a glass of hot chocolate 
was enough to bring me completely off the trip... even though i tried my 
damndest to stop that from happening. i also know that a friend of mine 
was in the middle of an intensely bad trip, which he told me was an 
inescapable deja-vu of a nightmare he had had, and when he was forced to 
drink to glasses of milk by another friend, he slowly but surely came out 
of it and was trippin no more. i wish i could tell you if rice dream or 
other types of "milk" would work, but since i don't know how exactly it 
all works i can't answer that.

Now that's a bad trip! Good thing you didn't imagine lil faerie Bill
Gates gnome-entities running around you... 

Hell, I'd take being mummified in a pyramid over that any day!

I too once said the same things that you said, didn't partake for over
2 years, but came back to it eventually, with greater care and respect
than before -- just like a mountain climber needs to go back and climb
once more after taking a bad fall.

Guidelines:
	(1) don't take it because you just want to stay awake after getting
	    too little sleep the night before.
	(2) don't mix it with anything until after you're done peaking.
	(3) don't ever do more than one hit. (unless you're trying for
	    consecutive days, however, note that this violates rule #1)
	(4) do not take it to escape. find your center, feel centered, then
            take it. if you take it to escape, the thing you're trying to
	    escape from may well "haunt you from beyond the grave"...
	(5) take it somewhere where you feel comfortable, with people you
	    feel comfortable with, and they feel comfortable with you.

basically, if just the thought of taking it doesn't give you a slight
butterfly of apprehension in your stomach (or wherever your butterfly
may flitter), you probably aren't giving it the seriousness it deserves.

	;') Sorry, this was an obviously serious post, but the above 
	quote really cracked me up.

	And so the post isn't a complete waste of space, here's what
	I think on the subject.

	I've had an experience similar, though perhaps not quite as 
	dramatic as the one you outlined. A combination of environment, 
	general state of mind, and being dosed without my knowledge led 
	to one of the more unpleasant evenings of my life.

	This was the only time for me that I've been unable to say to 
	myself, its only a drug, in a couple of hours everything will 
	be ok, and slowly pull myself back to reality. At that time 
	the drug experience became reality; it controlled me, it scared
	me, and although in a milder form, it lasted for several days.

	Maybe it is a question of weak will, self control - but I'd 	
	never before, or ever since, experienced anything quite like 	
	that...

	Not really rave related, but still...

	I spent Friday night walking around San Francisco. We were 
	supposed to be going out to have some food, maybe have a 
	drink, but the bulk of the night ended up being spent walking 
	around, enjoying the night.

	Maybe somewhere near the misson, I don't know the city that
	well, we look down and see a mess of white lines all over 
	the pavement - straight, but not really shaped as such.

	Looking closer, you notice that the shadows from surrounding
	objects have boundaries that fall across the lines - parking
	meters, the bridge overhead, a fence - they're all outlined
	in white paint. Not completely, that would be too obvious,
	but just enough so you can be sure if you notice it. 

	From the looks of it, the people that do this come out at 
	different times, there's too much outline for one set of 
	shadows. I got to wondering if people do this all over the 
	city, or if I stumbled across the only occurence.
	
	I love intelligent graffiti,
	Gary

		      Medics on move after wild party

		    Bad acid trips at all-night bash put
		       16 revelers in area hospitals

				By Cecily Burt
				Staff Writter

Oakland - Some bad acid trips during a throbbing, all-night dance party 
at the Henry J. Kaiser Convention Center kept paramedics and hospitals 
rooms working overtime late Saturday and early Sunday.

American Medical Response field supervisor Patrick Chellew said AMR 
paramedics transported 16 people to area hospitals, starting with two 
disoriented women who were found lying in the middle of the street around 
11 p.m. Saturday.

It didn't stop until 7:30 a.m. Sunday.

"Every 15 or 20 minutes we'd get another call," Chellew said.  "After the 
fourth or fifth, we sent a unit down there and set up.  We stayed there 
all night long.  I peeked inside and a core group of 5,000 or 6,000 
stayed until 5 a.m. at least, just dancing, dancing, dancing"

The Cyberfest event, an indoor-outdoor, multi-stage extraganza at the 
10th Street location, drew about 20,000 people ages 16 and up, police said.

Participants had their choice of sensory pleasures:  Holograms and laser 
light shows, a tour of Erotic City, chill zones, tribal drum dancers, 
interactive videos, and a raging fun zone with wild rides.  

At least 4 themed music stages blasted out funk, hip hop, techno acid 
house and tribal drums.  There was something for everyone, even those 
that didn't want it - like neighbors who weren't at the party.

According to a flier advertising the event, alcohol was served, along 
with a variety of "smart" vitamin drinks.  The party might have been 
fine, but some people took LSD and many of the trips turned sour, medical 
authorities said Sunday. 

The party was produced by Cool World Productions.  Tickets were $20 in 
advance through BASS, and $25 at the door.

A man who answered the phone at Cool World Productions said Sunday it was 
a peaceful event, and reports of the drug overdoses were overblown.

But Chellew said he saw what he saw.

"It made an impact on the system, a big impact," he said.  "Many of these 
cases had to be put in restraints because they were hysterical or combative.
It took several minutes to deal with each person."

Nel Morning, a supervisor at Highland Hospital, said 10 or 11 people from 
the party ended up in the hospital, too scared and too high to come down 
on their own.

The last patient checked out at 2:30 p.m. Sunday when his family came to 
pick him up, she said.

"(LSD overdoses) can be pretty serious," Morning said. "I mean, if you're 
out of your head, you can do some bizarre things."

In the middle of the festivities, one man had to be restrained and taken 
to the hospital after he shed all his clothes and tried to bite off a 
woman's belly button ring, Chellew said.

The man scraped his stomach when the woman knocked him down.

Organizers had obtained a permit and Oakland police were aware of the 
event, unlike some word-of-mouth events that are held locally in empty 
warehouses. But nobody was totally prepared for the huge turnout, and it 
ended up being a very long night, authorities said.

Stragglers still wandered the streets around Lake Merritt and the BART 
station after the party finally ended and the police and paramedics left 
about 7:30 a.m. There were no reports of violence, aside from the people 
who overdosed and had to be restrained.  A police officer injured his 
hand trying to controll one person.

Several neighbors called the police to complain about the throbbing, 
pulsating music, and the trash left behind was a sight to behold.

"It was incredible," Chellew said.  "I've never seen anything like it."

     Just to add my voice to the whole fiasco, I've had a trip bad enough to
lose all my reference points too (my reality was Doom's version of hell) and
until people are educated as a whole as to why acid is so much more powerful
than that little peice of paper looks, then people like me need to bitch and
complain about their experiences.  
Maybe that's why the prison sentences for A are so darn huge?

Well for the record, Im damn proud of being a Raver (and more so for being an
SF Raver).  Iv'e tripped many-a-time and quite a few alone.  Yes, It's true
that our kind have a stigma as a counterculture clan that the media explotes
as drug-ridden kids that dance all night on drugs.  We must accept this, yet
educate thoes that are introduced to the scene that theres a lot more to it.
 the enegry, the vibe.  The love and respct for each other.  I'd say 4 out of
every 5 events I go to i'm NOT on anything because the vibe itself keeps me
up... When I have a friend that's curious about A or E or whatever, I warn
them.  The trip is ususally long and how you feel inside WILL effect your
excursions.  Call me a druggie, scum, or whatever you wish...  but I will let
it be known, I wear my SFRaves badge with pride wherever I go...

hi all,
I need some advice on ambient CD releases--can anyone recommend a really
good record?  I'm looking for something dreamy, hymnlike, with soft/steady
beats (does that make sense?) but I never have a clue as to what to get 
when I'm in the record shops... any ideas?
thanks

   Hello there Tim;). Reagan here. I know a nice,smooth and dreamy cd to 
recommend for ya. Usally after a party;I always try to listen to music 
that will bring me down after my very limp and tired body falls upon my 
futon. I find that: 'Aphex Twins: Selected Ambient Works Volume II' does 
the trick. I can't remember where I got it, but I don't think you would 
have a problem finding it;), JUST GET IT!!!

Dear All, & Hi!! Kati;

	Yes, once again I have moved, here is my new address and home 
number, please note my pager is still the same. Pretty scarey, when the 
two most stable things in your life are you pager number & your e-mail 
address.

	It's a phat, very private, one bedroom, with the neighors
sonically insulated; by having the living room, centered in the apartment,
& surrounded by the bedroom, kitchen, hallway outside, & a lot of built in
cabinets. The unit has the most funky built in cabinets I've ever
seen, like something outta an old Doctor's or Dentist's office. 

	Outside there's the 6, 14, 57. 72, 73, C, F, AC Transist buses,
with the N, 15, 40, 43, & BART, about two blocks away. Plus everything
else from Liquire, Check Cashing, A Pak & Save, CompUSA, Sportmart, Home
Depot, plus two or three other major shopping centers with in walking
distance. 

	New Adress:

			3815 San Pablo Ave, #2
			Emeryville, CA. 94608
			(510)-654-2465

	Yes a party is evident, it screams for one, and a date will be
appearing on the October Calendar shorty.

	Reza, tell Claire I've located a two bedroom house, in Oakland,
surrounded by an industrial park, the house itself rents for $685/month,
but the nice thing about it is it has a 250 sqaure foot art studio
available with it, that is not part of the house, and is available for a
little more money, about $175/month nego. Please pass this info on to her 
and tell her to contact me.

I STRONGLY recommend that you buy Artificial Intelligence Vol. II, a 
damned fine ambient collection if ever there was one.
Amber by Autechre is also one of my favorites, as well as Maya by Banco 
de Gaia and ISDN by FSOL.

Hope dat's gud.

 Most of the folks on SFRaves may not know the 1980's alternative band
called Martha and the Muffins , but for some odd reason Ultramarine's
latest CD reminds me of that band. Same elements of quirky angularity
and minimalism.

  I'd like to add:
        (6) have a watch , or some access to a reliable timepiece. If things
            get bad , you can check the time and repeat this little mantra
            to yourself - "I'll be OK by %%%%" , where %%%% is 7 hours after
            you took the last dose. Gives you a goal and some hope.

(OAKLAND) - SF Raver David Arthur Minuk, 33, has confessed to going to
a Cool World event and having a good time.  The party, an all-night
"rave" concert, featured loud dance music, a psychedelic light show,
and exotically clad dancers.
     "First off, if anyone says they saw me dancing to Steve Masters
playing "Cotton Eyed Joe" in Erotic City 2000, IT'S A DAMNED LIE!!!"
Minuk said.  Erotic City was a room given over to alcohol sales at the
otherwise alcohol-free party.  Some sources have indicated that
illegal drugs such as LSD and Ecstacy may have been consumed that
night.  "I didn't do anything, [I] just went to experience the
hugeness of it all and have a good time.  Yeah, [it] looked like some
people were on drugs, mainly acid, it didn't seem like too many people
were on speed."
     "You see, I won these tickets on the radio.  The last
Cyberfestation was a near-fiasco due to lack of water.  And I heard
about other Cool Worlds where all hell broke loose.  I wanted to go
mainly to check out the out of town DJs which are scarce in this town.
I knew they'd have a good sound system.  Sure enough, when I  got
there at 8 to pick up the tickets, the outdoor PA was already pumpin'.
The sound system was adequate, two four foot stacks, but for the
people there could have been louder - maybe if they used another pair
of stacks.  Well, they were outdoors.  The sound inside was better.
Two twelve foot stacks, and just enough echo for that big-rave sound."
     "When I got there, I gave my other ticket to a friend who was
spare changing trying to get in.  I immediately headed for the outdoor
system, where Tony [a Disk Jockey] was coming on.  The vibe was pretty
good, some responded to eye contact, some didn't.  Occasionally a huge
train of teenagers would barge into the center of the floor, dance for
a while, then leave.  Not much circle dancing, though.  I danced
through most of Tony's set, then headed past the carnival rides into
the Henry J."
     "Inside, there were a few vendors in the hallway, a first aid
station and snack bars but no corporate sponsorship.   The final funk
bands in the main room were wrapping it up for the night.  While they
finished, I took a peek into "Erotic City."  When I had my fill of
cheese, I proceeded back outside.  Behind the outdoor system, along
the "Meditation Lake" (actually Oakland Estuary), there were tents and
a chill area with blankets and mattresses."
    "By now, the place was packed, inside and out[Police sources put
the attendance at some 20,000].  The sheer size of the crowd
discouraged milling around, as moving was quite difficult and
time-consuming.  I headed for the Motha Ship, the room devoted to
hip-hop.  There was very little decoration here.  The attitude was
chill as most people stood watching some breakdancers, who were quite
skilled.  It wasn't competitive, as they would applaud each other in
turn."
     "Back in the main room, two MCs were firing the crowd up with
some cheesy chatter.  Then Armand Van Heldon played some rather
jarring trance containing some urban-style noises.  I was tired, so as
I often do, I left around 4."
     "I liked it.  It was great to see so many people dancing and
having a good time.  It was inclusive, cross-cultural,  non-elitist
and all-American.  Is this the future of rave in America?  To
mainstream society, Cool World *is* rave.  We all have a stake in what
happens next.  If you think you can do a better job throwing a big
party, go ahead and try."

I'll see some of you at Splish - I'm thinking of bringing out the
dreaded purple velour running suit...

Her name is Erica.  (At least she was the first when I got there).
She was on before Tracy.  She has just started playing publicly.

So all of the freaks are coming out of the wood work to tell there tales huh?
 Well  being a major freak myself I guess I should tell a little from my
experience.  

I always loved LSD (still do) and always handled it better than most.  I was
always in control even when I was not.  This was my first mistake.  I ended
up one night wondering how I got to the hospital and where did every one
went.  I guess the police report that I saw later on helped fill in some of
the gaps but let me tell you police reports are not very pretty.  =o)

Im so glad we are having this discussion because it is really important.  I
know I never believed it could happen to me and to make it worse I was
considered by everyone I knew to be the least likely for something bad to
happen to me on LSD.  Well I always like to learn the hard way but I think
this is one lesson I would rather not repeat.  

I took an unknown amount of liquid (5-20 hits) thinking I was doing one hit.
 Well I got too far out in my own little world with the wrong people around
me.  If you have ever seen Altered States the movie then you know what I
ended up like.  I was primal man fighting for survival...  unfortunately this
does not work well in an apartment =o)  I'll spare you all the details but if
you are really interested e me privately and we can trade dirty details =o)
 because that is not really what is important.  

What is important is what I learned.  One thing I learned is that LSD is VERY
FUCKING POWERFUL.  It is so powerful that if you take enough you can loose
control no matter how smart, stable or experienced you are.  When it comes
down to it you can not beat chemistry by thinking positive thoughts. IMHO  

I will also echo previous statements about making sure you are really
emotionally and mentally ready to deal with the experience.  I'm sure some of
the difficult times I was having with some people who were very close to me
had something to do with it even though it was not in the front of my mind.  

It is also very important that you take anything strong in an environment
where you can feel like you have some control.  If things do start to go bad
it is really important that you can control your relevant safety.  The
control might be something as little as being able to call a friend if you
need to or being able to have a place to walk to where you can be safe and
alone if need be.  Of course having the right people around is very important
also but sometimes if you really have a full blown paranoia attack brought on
by too much LSD even good friends can become scary.  

I would like to find out what form of LSD these people took.  I have a theory
that liquid LSD is not always available because it really does cause trouble.
 It's kinda like the China White thing...  people do not realize the potency
because they are not used to it.  It is also very difficult to accurately
quantize the dosage of liquid LSD out side of lab conditions.  I know the
same month I had my experience a couple of my friends also had ODs on liquid.
 I know there is some liquid going around right now and I would be interested
to find out if the people who ODed did it on liquid.  

OK enough of my babbling...  My main point is that even after all that LSD is
still a very good thing but needs to be taken seriously and treated with
respect.  It can provide some of the best experiences (IMO) that drugs have
to offer but it can also provide some of the most terrifying.

i cannot say that this redeems evil 105 for me though... the rock of the

Dear ADam;

	I agree with Adam, even though I don't do psychodelics anymore.

	According to Dr. Timothy Leary every social revolution, has had a
counterculture drug;(ours being E, with L.S.D being a close 2nd), new forms
of music, and new belief systems assoicated with it. Ours having the
additions of some major techological developments; that are changing the
way we do and use basic services, communicate, and view our world & it's
cultures; starting to become common place. An example being the
proliferation of computers in the home, that have access to the Internet. 

	But back to L.S.D, and more specifically, the last trip I had,
which was a bad one. Yet before it, I had hundreds of great, fantastic,
mind expanding really fun trips, that bonded me forever with my fellow
participents. Does that mean people shouldn't do acid, or does it mean
that I shouldn't do acid, the answer is neither. There are no should
or shouldn't, just choices.  

	My experience with acid, was the more I did, the more intense the
visual stuff was, not the weirder. For example I would do 3 hits say, and
pass my hand in front of my face. I would then see say 6 sets of hand
trails. Where as if I did say 10 or 15 hits, I would see 17 sets of hand
trails, and things wouldn't have to move anymore for trails to come of
them. 

	Today, I CHOSE not to do acid cause I don't like being that
fragile, and so supseptable to a world which is both unpredictable, and
unfortuately often not a pretty place. Today I will not let another's
ungliness have so much control over my mind & soul. Even at a rave I've
seen and experienced things that would be unspeakable, and would have
shattered me if I'd been on L.S.D. 

	I however have never experienced the sypmtoms mentioned at
Cyberpuss, nor seen them, while on LSD, or with people who were. My
opinion is that, it sounds more like Special K is the colbrit here. As
many of you know I come from Florida, land of Killer MDA/MDMA mixtures,
more N2O than you could ever possibly do, more cocaine that I don't
understand why people do, and yes Special K, the breakfast of the totally
fucked. Yes, I LOVE SF, but ravers in Florida, would put any but, the most
robust SFRAver under the table. I have heard, and seen friends that have had
MORE BAD experiences with this drug, than good ones. So does that mean you
shouldn't take it, no, for you could have an experience that utterly
changes your life in a positive way(unlikely), or puts you in a mental 
hospital for the rest of your life(also unlikey).

	I have often seen friends, go into what ravers in Florida called
"The K Hole", where the person/self is more, but usually less there,
confused, frighten, disorientened, requiring almost constant attention,
and a quiet friendly face environment, definately not the multiple,
constant, & vibeless, stimuli that Cyberfuck offered. When I asked people
in Florida about the drug most of them said "Brian it's a REALLY 
TWISTED/WEIRD high.", and that was enough for me not to try it.

	The sypmtoms mentioned are associated with Special K overdose or
toxicity, and I would be interested in hearing how old the people were who
had a bad time, how much drug experience they had, and whether or not this
susbstance was indeed a liquid or not. 

	Special K does come in liquid form from the pharmacy and often,
but not always gets cooked down to a white power, for ease of dosage
adminstration and transportation. For if these were either first time acid
users, and or just plain naive people, then doing either acid, bad acid,
or god forbid Special K, or even worst multiple drugs, at an event like
Cyberweird, where you could lose the person next to you in a wink of an
eye. 

	Then I would say extremely poor judgement was either exerised, or
extremely poor informtaion was provided to the first time user, or the
drugs themselves were bad, or not what they where sold as. Or all of the 
above.

	But of course we will never know the truth, we can only do what were 
doing here and try and make some sense outta all the data, real, & false 
provided. 

	Somebody asked what you give people who are freaking out, violent 
or psycotic. You give them drugs found in the nueroleptic, major 
tranquilizer family, drugs like, Melarill, Thorazize, ...etc 

	You can't even crack a smile on these drugs, and they are not fun
to do, PLEASE TRUST ME ON THIS ONE, I will save you the 8 hours of walking
around like you can't move any of your joints(that's the thorazie shuffle
that Joey Ramone talks about), or care if they were about to, or were to
torture you.  It's not care free, it's just like no external stimuli has
any effect on you, even in 5 points restraits.

	But again it's about choices, knowing your street stuff, and as
Clint Eastwood put it so well, Every man(womyn, human) needs to know
his(their) limitations. 

	But some friendly advice for the uninformed, and curious, if your
gonna do it, do it around and in an environment which is both friendly,
controllable by you, or someone you trust, around people you trust, and
like, especially if it's your first time. Also before you do it, and while
your doing it, talk with that intellect that's firmly grounded in reality
that most of us have, and say to yourself, especially if YOUR INTERPRETING
THAT BAD THINGS ARE HAPPENING, that in # hours I will feel much
differently than I do know. Also, that I'm about to do a drug that will
twist what I interpret as reality, and I should expect fun, strange,
wonderful, weird things to happen to me, but they will not hurt me cause
thay are not real. Also, that I will get through this, it's only a
temporary drug. Say it as many times as your need to, have others
constantly reasure you that you gonna be fine. 

	That's what I did, and once I got my LSD legs, & HUD(Heads Up
Display), I was more than find to venture forth into more unpredictable,
public spaces. In fact once this level of confidence was established, you
couldn't keep me insidem a room with four walls.

nah...next time i'm near a bad tripper i'm given them the keys to their 
car and sendin' them on their way...

no, i suppose i'm a little too responsible to do that, but after ending 
up with a broken foot from someone else's "bad trip", i'm a just a tad 
less willing to play nurse when people can't handle their psyches and 
their chemicals... (alas, it's easy to say "if you're not centered and 
'together,' don't take drugs," but there are those who just don't get it....)

I start off by agreeing with Niels, Cool World sounded like a bad trip from
the get go. I have yet to here anything possitive about these partys. David
gave it a good try, some people can see a silver lining behind every cloud.
 As far as the substance of concern is involved, I will state my personal
opinion that inanimate objects such as LSD are incapable of "creating" a bad
psychological experience. The experience was created in the psyche of the
individual(s) involved in the experience. In my opinion, LSD works like a
psychological amplifier. It intensifies the current psychological experience.
A musical amplifier cannot be blamed for the music it amplifies. Nor can LSD
be blamed for the psyche it amplifies. If the DJ puts on a bad record, the
amplifier still amplifies it. If the DJ puts on an awesome record, "Pump the
volume!!!!". May all our days be like kickn grooves!!! Peace and Love!!!

why do people have bad trips ?  is it more a reflection on the person 
or the drug ?  i just cant imagine having one, having had but awesome,
fantastic experiences on A since i have been in frisco.  i only trip 
when i am outdoors, and with friends, and if i was ever confused, i 
would look into the eyes of my friends, and laugh.

You are right, about San Francisco, but back in England not just good 
parties, but GREAT parties still happen. I went to two this summer - Tribal 
Gathering 20,000+ and Glastonbury 150,000+ (admittedly this one has been 
going on for a while :) I think that the problem lies in a number of 
things, one is experience (both in throwing huge parties and handling 
"bad trips") and the other is social tolarance. I witnessed brittish 
bobbies smoking out! The atmosphere at both parties was mind blowing - 
imagine 150,000 people ( -the beer boys) partying with the sole 
intention of being blissed out!!

Best selling author Michael Crichton (Jurassic Park; The Andromeda 
Strain; Our Bodies, Ourselves) has published a new blockbuster based on 
the Sf rave scene and used Ernie, of sesame street fame, as its main 
character. In the following excerpt, from the chapter "frazzled," Ernie 
has made his way back from Paraguai and cleared his name from the 
Oaklahoma City bombings. He is now at an outdoor rave, somewhere in the 
mountains near Nevada City.....

 Ernie opened his tent and heard the sound of swishing shafron. He 
pitched his head and saw red. Red chiffron. More cloth than the 73rd 
Airborn parachuting elite.
 And in all of that, he saw him. In the middle of the cloth, coccooned in 
fashion and sheer bad taste, an sfraver. 
 "Ouch! Man, this is the last time I camp in drag! I caught my $#@ damn 
heel!" the sfraver exclaimed.
 Ernie called up"hey dude, you gotta pipe?" the raver sat down, grimmacing 
as he pulled off the "LL Bean outback" pumps. Ernie lit up a bowl, and 
passed it on. 
The stranger took a deep puff,nodding "thanks. Hey, you going on that hike?"
Ernie replied "Does a bear....."

 "Apparently so" the raver answered, two hours later. They were deeply lost, 
and had come around their first carnivore faecal sighting.
 "Man, if it's that BIG coming out, imagine what he ate. I mean, his mouth 
must be big enough to fit your whole head, though that wouldn't kill you 
righ then. Noo, it would last and last and-"
 "CUT THAT OUT!" interrupted Ernie."I don't wanna hear about bears. We're 
lost, gonna be eaten, and miss the friggin party! "
 "Relax, man. This hike is sooooo green"  observed the raver.
Ernie twisted his head around and glared. He watched the fool playing with 
a pine needle and screamed:"What are you doing? Did you drop on this hike?!"
 "yeah, didn't you? Oh hey, look, I have some more, I didn't know you 
didn't have any..."
 "ahhhh! Give me the compass. I said give me-" Ernie bellowed. Ernie 
yanked it from his hands, and suddenly realised Milton couldn't find 
North if crawled up and bit him on the"assk yourself, Ernie, why do 
you have all this anger? I mean, how often can you camp, you know, 
without missing a party, with all your friends and-" the raver tried hard. 
Not hard enough. 
 Because Ernie began to run. Very hard, and he carried away the boy's 
supplies. He hid behind a tree 100 feet away, and opened the pack. A 
koosh ball. Pop rocks. An orange. And a blinking red light.
 "toys! Toys, hahahaha! We're gonna die!" It was very hard for Ernie.
The boy caught up, confused, and gave Ernie a hug. Ernie sighed, and 
thought "The thing is going to talk again."
                                 It did.
"Wanna sticker? Uhm? I got flowers and bees and crickets and oh, flowers, 
and, and.." he stammered.
 
"what was your name again?"

"Milton. Yer Ernie. I saw you on TV.This puppet is my E-Bee, he likes to 
hike tooooo!"

Ernie stared in dismay, and processed this fact. Now he new he was 
doomed. They would be lost forever. Unless, over that ridge, big bird had 
left a clue......

 But with a music amp , if you're pegging the VU meters and distorting
horribly , or your system gets into evil self-consuming feedback , you can
reach down and turn the gain down. Taking LSD is like turning up the amp
and locking the controls away for 8 hours.

 Nice analogy otherwise, in my opinion.

The first time I tripped, I tripped hard and I couldn't even dial a 
telephone or figure out what time it was when there was a digital clock 
right in front of me, I can't imagine trying to figure out what an analog 
clock would look like.   :)

hi all,
I need some advice on ambient CD releases--can anyone recommend a really
good record?  I'm looking for something dreamy, hymnlike, with soft/steady
beats (does that make sense?) but I never have a clue as to what to get 
when I'm in the record shops... any ideas?
thanks

     Hi Gary!  Missed your sunny smile since BM.  Hope all is well.
     
     Are you sure you weren't tripping hard when you discovered the white 
     lines?  ;)  When I was driving home from a party early Sunday morning, 
     the music in my car was in syncopation w/the blinking red and yellow 
     street lights.  It was really beautiful to feel and see the rhythms of 
     life around me.  I wanted to create an instant video recording the 
     random rhythms that coincide w/man-made rhythms...'cause to me that's 
     what going off is all about, hitting a groove and flying with it.  
     
     Hope to see ya soon!
     
     Diane

 Not really rave related, but still...
     
 I spent Friday night walking around San Francisco. We were 
 supposed to be going out to have some food, maybe have a 
 drink, but the bulk of the night ended up being spent walking 
 around, enjoying the night.
     
 Maybe somewhere near the misson, I don't know the city that 
 well, we look down and see a mess of white lines all over 
 the pavement - straight, but not really shaped as such.
     
 Looking closer, you notice that the shadows from surrounding 
 objects have boundaries that fall across the lines - parking 
 meters, the bridge overhead, a fence - they're all outlined 
 in white paint. Not completely, that would be too obvious, 
 but just enough so you can be sure if you notice it. 
     
 From the looks of it, the people that do this come out at 
 different times, there's too much outline for one set of 
 shadows. I got to wondering if people do this all over the 
 city, or if I stumbled across the only occurence.
     
 I love intelligent graffiti,
 Gary

it was personal experience, i don't really do or read much scientific  
info on acid. but, it wasn't just a matter of convincing our minds or 
that we were new to the drug, all of us that came off with milk had 
tripped several times before. and like i said, i don't know if it works 
with everybody... though it has with those who i know personally who 
tried it.

What's the difference between O.J. and Chrisopher Reeves?  O.J. walks.   Don't 
know why, don't know how, but it's true.  I'm almost happy that at least there 
won't be umpteen monotonous appeals to captivate the pathetic American public 
for years to come.  Gee, what will we do!?

Feeling mystified,

Perhaps the Rock Med (or Grateful Med as I have heard them called)
would be interested in getting involved with some of the larger
parties? That would be a win-win for everyone.

Larry, congratulations on getting the point! You're right! Speakers with 100W
capacity cannot effectively handle the power of a 1000W amplifier. Also if
deep down in the grooves there is noise that needn't be amplified......?????

TRACY RULES

On Friday I heard her @1015.  Very melodic set.  And last nite she
played a beautiful mellow set @ Bahia Cabana (1600 Market @ Franklin).
The woman is so so so musical!

ps. I missed her set @ sunset, but everyone seems to have gone wild on it.

I think people should also remember that at one time we wern't part of 
the "knowledgeable" raver folk that we are now, knowing what and where
the "slammin'" parties are.
   my first party was with 4000 people in a warehouse.  it was weird.
it was different.  people messed up on Nitrous and a bunch of other
drugs, crazy hardcore music all night, etc. etc.  but from it i found
about other parties, the net, etc.
   seriously, sometimes this list and the rave scene in general is
too dammned incestious.  we need fresh blood around or we're all gonna
end up a little stupid and looking the same.

give me cool world. give me sunset. 
big, small. new. old.  its all needed to keep a scene happy and thriving.

peace

The idea behind the milk helping bring someone down is if it is heated 
thus releasing the chemical tryptophane which is supposed to help 
counteract the effects of the hallucinogen in question. Not sure if it 
works or not I've heard this claim from people for whom it has been useful.

In general I have compassion for those folks who had these megadose 
trips.It's not an easy thing. If psychedelics didn't have such an 
irrational taboo surrounding them it would be easier to disseminate 
useful information and try to cultivate spaces for appropriate use. 
Instead of fretting about people's lack of judgement and prudence we 
should do the best we can to promote education. It is obvious that the 
rave scene is ready for a more intelligent evolution but this must be in 
concert with other social and cultural tranceformations.

Best Regards,
Ronan

We're still going to Panther beach Thursday night for a 
drum/dij/food/fire/whatever else you can think of gathering. All are 
welcome.  In fact, if you need a ride from CalTrain or a place to crash 
just call me  :)  All you have to bring is friends, food to 
share if you can, drums or other noise makers, fire wood, or just 
yourself and warm vibes.  We really hope some of you can make it.  We 
will be there from 6:30-till we get tired.

If anyone still needs a ticket I will happily sell you mine.

It's rather a chicken and egg thing, isn't it? If people exercised good 
judgement, we wouldn't have to worry about educating the ignorant, 
because they would have had enough sense to find out what the hell they 
were getting themselves into before playing with the proverbial fire, and 
wouldn't be ignorant. Just a thought....

What did O.J. say to the bailiff as he left the courtroom following the
verdict?  "When do I get my hat and gloves back?"

Well, at least there aren't any riots anywhere!

I hope to see many of you at Sunset on Sunday during my whirlwind visit to
SF.  If anyone knows where it will be, I'd appreciate info by private email,
as I will be incommunicado after Thursday evening.  (Going to a wedding in
West Marin).  Oh yeah, if you need to check my bona fides, ask Brian B,
Geoff White, Niels Mayer.

Hugz to all,

Paul

Subject: Bad acid or bad trips?
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

I'll be brief:

Was it bad acid at Cyberfest, or kids/adults having bad trips?  Hard to
tell.  Probably the latter.  Sounds like a huge event that could get pretty
fucking scary.  If I saw a guy strip naked and try and bite someone's belly
button ring off, I'd probably get a little freaked, even if I was sober.

I have only read a sampling of email responses to this thread, and while
remedies for bad trips are appreciated, everyone is different and what
might calm one person, could enflame another, it's all in the individual
and the individual trip that person's on.

But I gotta say people, between this thread on acid, and the last thread on X...

ENOUGH OF THE FUCKING DRUG EMPHASIS ON SF RAVES!!!

Please, I understand we all mean well, and are only looking out for one
another, but if I didn't know already that this newsgroup can share very
informative news and reviews on raves in San Francisco and abroad (and
maybe even some good stories about particular experiences), then I would
unsubscribe immediately thinking it was just a bunch of druggies sharing
war stories.

Raving, in my oppinion and heart is not about drugs but about music and
people and understanding and a whole hell of a lot more than a trip.  Good
or bad!

Thanks for listening,

Tony


P.S.  I emplore you, before you send a message to SF Raves, or reply to
"all", please think about what you're saying and ask yourself if it is
pertinent to just one person you are agreeing with/disagreeing with, or the
whole group.

This is an old hoax.  I wish people would stop spreading the alert message!
This first hit the net over a year ago and people are still forwarding it around.

Mijos, tanks to Black Adder and Dave Bayer's help, we are online (again). 
"We" does not mean I am possessed by Legion, no, "we" means this account is 
shared by me (Milton), Joy (my better half) and that ubiquitous E-Bee. I 
met Joy at Vision this year, in a pink tu-tu and a rubber fish ( she 
forgave me).
 We will both use the same account, so direct all flames to the correct 
author, or any positive messages. I don't wanna have to excuse myself to 
her anymore than I already do:) 
 My return to SFR as well as to parties was caused by my receiving some 
(heh, heh) good news about a recent development in our scene. That's a 
teaser, I'll rant and rave about it later, but if you know me, you can 
bet your shell account it's about this coming Sunday (hmmm, whazzup?). 
 Joy is new to SFR and is waiting for something worthy to post about. 
I suggested some Zippie haiku, but she declined, so here's mine:
 Project to the infinite
 Interrupt the internal
 Find the rise
 Return that overdue book.

(Sorry, I really miss scapegoats! Heh heh he he he!)

Lotsa love, 
 Milton and the E-Bee!

      Friends are like flowers, they give pleasure simply by being....

This virus warning circulated around my office a few months ago (and OF
COURSE I then forwarded it to everyone I knew - and then some...) but,
surprise surprise, the whole thing is a hoax so don't worry about it.  If
you're interested, (don't trust me?) below are the 2 responses to the virus
ordeal which had been forwarded to me.  One is from Borland's IS dept, the
2nd is what's known as ' the "offical" report on the "Good Times" virus from
the DOE's Computer Security group.'  
Have a good one!
Emily

---BEGIN 1st INCLUDED MSG--
Viruses cannot ride on email or .txt files. You can only get 'em from
downloading executables or trading diskettes.  If there's a binary
attachment on a mail, you could become infected by running it, but not by
just opening a mail message.

Particularly like "Other, more well-known viruses such as Stoned, Airwolf,
and Michelangelo pale in comparison to the prospects of this newest creation
by a warped mentality."  Such verbiage.

Here are the main things we can do to prevent virus infections at Borland:

1.  Scan every diskette that you receive before you use it.  Always scan any
binaries you download from any source.  

2.  Backup your hard drive on a regular basis.  This will minimize data loss
caused by viruses.

3.  Attached is the latest scan and vshield software if you are concerned
please unzip the file read the accompanying .txt files and install it
properly on your systems.  Help others in the company do the same.

4.  Report any virus infection directly to xxxxx.

5.  Please do not send out department or company-wide mail regarding virus
scares.  This will only causes undue panic and confusion.  Most common
viruses are easy to deal with and are not a cause for hysteria.  We will
notify Borland personnel of virus concerns as necessary.

Thank You for your patience and cooperation
The IS Department

>>In the early part of December, CIAC started to receive information
requests

>>
>> -------------------------------------------------------------------------
--

 |
>> -------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
>>
>>THIS IS A HOAX.  Upon investigation, CIAC has determined that this message
>>originated from both a user of America Online and a student at a
university
>>at approximately the same time, and it was meant to be a hoax.
>>
>>CIAC has also seen other variations of this hoax, the main one is that any

>>This rumor has been spreading very widely.  This spread is due mainly to
the

false

>>
>>There has been one confirmation of a person who received a message with
>>"xxx-1" in the header, but an empty message body.  Then, (in a panic,
because
>>he had heard the alert), he checked his PC for viruses (the first time he
>>checked his machine in months) and found a pre-existing virus on his
machine.
>> He incorrectly came to the conclusion that the E-mail message gave him
the
>>virus (this particular virus could NOT POSSIBLY have spread via an E-mail
>>message).  This person then spread his alert.
>>
>>As of this date, there are no known viruses which can infect merely

Uhuh. Yeah right! THose damn nth complexity infinite binary loops
are just so taxing on a processor. you can almost see the little
thing sweating, and feel the humm of the chipmunks spinning the
program counter... awwwww... much worse than, say 
	0000 NOP
	0001 JMP 0000
yeah, that kind of loop is just easy living. Yea verily!

Don't be too hard on us mike - I did it myself .... newbies don't know and
you can't watch out for ALL of us.  :)  Just delete the email.  You can't
catch a virus through email anyways.

>From the Chron/Ex, by Arthur McMurray:

Oakland, Ca. Following the Cyberfest debacle last saturday, paramedics 
have isolated a potentially harmful virus, tentatively named "Lucidosis 
freakii" often found on perforated paper squares.
 Researches believe it is transmitted through unsanitary handling of 
blotters,  and unsavory distribution through uncertified distributors. 
Susceptibility is often linked to naivety and over-eagerness to explore 
without guidance, or just random shit.
 Francis Deck, esquire, of the Dopamine, Dopayours Institute for 
Insightful Realizations, advises: " never allow your paper to touch 
other's. Do not consume if you cannot find your ride, backpack, memory or 
the door. This virus can enhance confusion and alter perception of rubber 
fish. Very confusing, but pretty much harmless when not operating heavy 
machinery or handling change at 7-11."
 Symptoms may include sitting, bad posture, a wrinkled brow and phrases 
such as "you just said that", "I got it figured out", "you just said 
that!", and the ever present "wha-what? Oh, man, I'm #ucke$ up!".
 Researches have noted that removing clothing is NOT an antidote.

Just felt I should reprint this, for everyone's safety. 

Lotsa love (wha?What?)

I'll be brief, too.

Take a look at what the most people have at least 2 cents to comment on:
fanatical praise of  Sunset and drugs. Oh yeah, and talking about
themselves. This sums up 90% of the last 2 months on here. Everyone
complains about how non-ravers don't see or hear what raving is "really
about," but what choice do they have? Ravers may get a bad rap, and if all
you know is what you see, then that's all they'll ever get. Raving ain't
gonna save the world because it's too busy dosing itself into the hospital.

What I wanna know is, who was the LAST dj? I couldn't see his whole face 
and the music was too happy for me to try anyway. This sunset was perfect 
for me, perfect weather, perfect cops (real cool) perfect place, perfect 
people of all tribes, perfect music perfect vibe. And the first time I've 
danced in nearly 6 months. Has partly to do with that news I got from (oh 
well, I should save that Sunday news for later. Hmmm...)

"       LSD was first synthesized in 1938 by Albert Hofmann, a chemist at
the Sandoz pharmaceutical laboratories in Basel, Switzerland.  The work was
part of a systematic investigation into the properties of ergot (a rye grass
fungus) as a source of new medicines...
        Lysergic acid diethylamide was the twenty-fifth in a series of
lysergic acid derivatives.  For laboratory use, the name was abbreviated to
LSD-25.  LSD-25 was specifically created with the idea that might be a
circulatory and respiratory stimulant.  Tests showed that it stimulated
contraction of the uterus, although not as strongly as other drugs.  Sandoz
pharmacologists and physicians found nothing exceptional in these
properties, though, and testing of LSD-25 was abandoned.  Hofmann remained
interested in the drug, and in 1943 synthesized a new batch of LSD-25."

Hi,


Disregard that "virus alert<fwd." It's a urban legend. It's annoying how

Ok,   I've finally re-organized my WEB files,   moved all my rave reports
completly off the WELL,  and onto vcomm.net.    I'll probably be gradually
moving things around from time to time,   but will do it so it makes little
impact on Net Surfers.   Check out PLAY --> RAVE pages,  where you'll see
the "rave Reports" link.   Click there,  to see the thee reviews which
are:

  Equinox Light party weekend before last
  Gathering party at SF city hall this Sat night
  Sunset this sunday at Pt Molati

Feel free to link to these if you like,  or just to the Web page that
indexes into the reviews.

OK, So I've been lurking about here for a while, and debated about 
whether to post to you all; but here it goes anyway: my belated bio...

First off, my name is Tristan (but poochie is *way* cool too).  I have 
recently moved to Sacramento from Vancouver, B.C. to take a new job.  Not 
knowing anyone in this small town, and being pretty shy admittedly, I 
find that I am working most of the time (there's *really*not*much* to do 
here anyways) which is cool for the career but thats about it.  

I'm 29 y.o. and really dig listening to the music since I hooked into it 
about a year ago or less; this, after being an industrial rat for eons.  
I have to admit, however, that I've never participated in a rave; but 
hopefully this is soon to change.  The peaceful and respectful community 
spirit and total freedom that raving seems to embody is a real turn-on 
for me.  Just reading the posts here daily really brings a smile to my 
face!  :)   You all have crafted something here that will last a very 
long time to come.

I hope to meet you all sometime and somewhere in the future and give out 
Many Merry Hugz and Greetz (tho I have no clue when because with working 
I can barely stay awake past midnight anymore--which really sucks).  

until then: later, pooch

1.  It is rude to re-quote lengthy previous postings.

2.  This is about the 87th time "news" of the so-called "Good Times
    virus" has made the rounds.  It was and it is a HOAX.

3.  Real viruses range from silly to serious.  There are plenty of
    good sources for information about them, starting with the
    newsgroup comp.virus.

Thank you.

Yeah, I read it, it's a steamy potboiler that's sure to become a
controversial classic.

I'm sure you're tired of getting flamed by ravers, so I'll give you a
hug instead.

*hug*

Anyways, there is a real novel involving raves out called "The Black
Album" and it's about a Pakistani student in London who divides his
free time between raving, wild sex, getting high, and leading a troop
of Islamic extremists.  Don't know much more than that.

Also, I see the movie with that rave filmed in LA is coming out, "
Strange Days."

Well I don't know if it has many beats, but I absolutely love a good 
album of Gregorian chants... Cool stuff.

Sorry if I sent this off in a harsh tone, but it was the fifth "Good TImes"
alert I had received that day (two of them on sfr).  I just gets old after
a while.  All I ask is that people do a little research before blindly
forwarding stuff all over the place (not just to sfr).  This applies to 
viruses/news/rumors/mail/etc.  People shouldn't just assume since
they got an e:mail that it is true.

Big appologetic hugs!

I have directions to Panther but I'm not sure of the exact mileage to
Panther off of Hwy 1 ( does anyone know?). 

Take 101 to 85 Gilroy
85 to 17 Santa Cruz
17 to Hwy 1 North
Look for a pile of rocks with reflective paint on them. 
Turn into the dirt "parking lot" and park yo' car.
Cross the railroad tracks on the beach side of the parking lot.
Go down the little trail (be careful the trail gets a little precarious 
at night)  then look for the crazy group of people sittin' around a fire 
making noise!

I'll  post the exact miles you have to travel on hwy 1 to get to Panther 
later today. 

If transpo or a place to crash is in question... Call me @ 415-988-0299

Hello everyone,
 
First of all, is there anyone out there who has some hard facts about the laws 
concerning noise in the domestic arena (i.e. apartment buildings, etc.)?  
I know that basically the cops will not respond to noise complaints made 
between 7am and 10pm.  I think there are specific decibel levels which 
cannot be exceeded after 10pm. Does anyone know what they are?  I would 
appreciate a detailed description of these laws, if anyone would be so 
kind to provide it.  I think this info would benifit others on the list 
who live within earshot of people who are intolerant of "repetitive beats."

Now, let me explain why I have just made the above request... 
(personal information to follow- please delete if uninterested)

Two months ago, my girlfriend and I moved into an apartment building in 
Oakland.  The night after moving in, we had some friends over in the 
evening and were listening to music at a LOW level, when the upstairs 
neighbor came down and tried to offer me $20 to keep my stereo off.  He 
accused me of playing loud music for three days, when in fact we'd only 
moved in the day before.  I refused the money, but felt it was necessary 
to talk to these people and come to some sort of agreement, so that we 
wouldn't be getting on each other's nerves.  A few days later, Kristen 
(my girlfriend) and I went upstairs to talk with them.  Upon opening the 
door, the guy started pacing back and forth in the hallway, breathing 
heavily, and accusing me of blasting music 12 hours a day, when in fact, 
I had only played about 1-2 hours of music which even approached being 
loud, and only in the afternoons.  We had a very tense and tedious 
discussion with them, and came to a tentative agreement that I could play 
music loud for 2.5 hours a day, and very soft at other times (we even 
checked the levels on my stereo).  This was a big compromise on my part, 
but I didn't want to be on bad terms with anybody.  
	
About a week later, they called the landlord to complain, when in fact, I 
had not even come close to using my alloted 2.5 hours of loud music.  

Just last Friday night, we had four friends over to celebrate my 
birthday.  I had bought new records that afternoon, so I played them at a 
moderately loud level (not as loud as I had agreed on) from about 
8-10:30pm.  Then, we watched a movie, and afterwords, listened to music 
at a low level while talking.

They called the cops.  The cop was almost apologetic, realizing 
that their complaint was ridiculous.  He told us not to worry, and went 
on his way.

One hour later, they called the cops again.  When the second cop came, 
they filed a formal complaint against us, forcing us to appear in court.

Yesterday, I got home from school at 3pm with some more new records.  I 
started playing them at a moderately loud level.  FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER, the 
manager came pounding on my door, telling me that the upstairs neighbors had 
called and complained to him.

Does anyone know what I can do about this situation?  I would like to 
file a complaint of harassment against them, because this situation is 
getting ridiculuous.  The people who live below us were home ALL NIGHT 
on Friday, and were not even remotely bothered by the music, and never 
have been.  HELP ME PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

pissed,
Seth

i had the same problem, but lost and ended up in a jail cell overnight.
if someone complains about you 3x in one evening (or day), the third time
they have the right to take you downtown, irregardless of what the
level of music may have been, or even if you were playing music at 
all !  if the complaint is made in error, that gets sorted out 
later.  

so, there is no specific level.

since you just moved in, i would see it through in the courts.  you
should be able to get something from the judge that states something
like 'allowed to play music loud between x and y hours'.  at that
point, your fellow tenant has no recourse during those times.

good luck !

	Well...here it is, my late bio.  I've only been on SFRaves for a few
weeks now, and I must say that reading all of your posts really makes me
proud to be involved in our scene.  I don't think I've ever seen this much
unity within a bunch of people who don't see eachother every day, and I'd
like to start of by sending EVERYONE a GREAT BIG WARM SQUISHY FRIGGIN' HUG!
                                  *HUG*
                                   =)
	Now, lessee,  I went to my first party a couple of years back, I
thing it was Wicked/ Get Down Get Down Get Down,  and I was glued to the
speakers all night long.  8)~~~  <==*drool*
	Then, I went to *gulp* Cyberfest later on (I know, I know) and,
needless to say, had an ok time? =}
	Ever since then, I've been hooked and I got involved with the Cloud
Factory and Lettuce dance.  I LOVE SMALL PARTIES!!!!  I've been spinning for
about a year now, and would like to thank all of the artists out there who
make it possible for me to enjoy all of the beautiful music that moves me
the oh so incredible way it does.
	I grew up in the ARMPIT of California (Point Arena) and I attend 
UCSC,  I love it down here!  My SO transferred to UCDavis this year, so
I've been a little out of sorts lately.  
	Lets condense this, shall we? =)
1) Due to lack of a tight knit, all american family unit, all of my friends
   are my family, so i guess we're all related now, huh?  8)  (My parent's
   are also way cool)
2) I believe in PLUR, Karma, Beautiful music, understanding, and common
   sense.
3) I also enjoy animals, fuzzy things, and flashing smiles at strangers!
4) I'm a real cornball....

Well, I hope this was, at least, entertaining!  I gotta go to class.

Love and Hugs,
Sabin Cloud

P.S.  Cloud is my middle name and had no influence on the naming of the Cloud
      Factory.  Pretty neat coincidence though, huh?

Jello, mijos!
 There is afull moon this sunday being thrown by a collective of systems, 
djs, and positive people (you know, all those ravers).
 It is being thrown by a large, diverse group to make it a community 
event, where everyone is welcome. It will start early (by full moon 
standards) on sunday nite/monday morning.
The collective intends to make these parties on the full moon 
consistently, and to have the participation of all systems, djs, or 
anyone who wants to help plan, carry, scout sites, or just spread the word.
 Info will be spread by word of mouth and for this party, on several 
system's voice-mails, in different area codes. So just call your friendly 
neighborhood sound system later this week! (I'll post later, thursday 
pm...)
 Remember to spread it word of mouth to non-sfravers, and to tell people 
which systems to call....

Lotsa love (oooh, it's happening!!!!)
 Milton and the E-Bee...

Flowers are our only treasure, and through them our friendship grows

	Does anyone else think that DJ Erica looks uncannily like Jen 
from the movie Kids?  (not to imply anything about her character, of 
course)

	just wondering,

		Casper the Dopest Ghost 


p.s. She's also a great DJ--I'd like to see her out there more often.  
Yay more women DJs!

        hello all!

        Just wanted to let you know that my new netscape-enhanced web pages
are up with links to John 'da crunchman' draper's pages, some stuff leading
to strange terence mckenna pages, schwa, other fun things...oh radio
sermonettes by hakim bey. And some of my flyers including some of the
progress ones.
        so tell me what you think, any and all feedback from you lovely
people would be appreciated! :)
        Oh btw i think i may have found a good counter for you, john. it's
at the internet audit bureau (yes, that does NOT sound like a good name)
but if you go to http://www.iaudit.com/ you can get signed on to do page
counting. it's free, no cgi. :)
        take care everyone!
                brad

We're still going to Panther beach tonight for a 
drum/dij/food/fire/whatever else you can think of gathering. All are 
welcome.  In fact, if you need a ride from CalTrain or a place to crash 
just call me  :)  All you have to bring is friends, food to 
share if you can, drums or other noise makers, fire wood, or just 
yourself and warm vibes.  We really hope some of you can make it.  We 
will be there from 6:30-till we get tired.

        I am planning on going to Planet E this weekend. Any info someone
wanna tell me or anything about it? I'm going with my friend and I've never
been to Planet E before(this isn't the first one I hope).... I've been to
other SF Raves, but I'm relatively new to the SF rave scene. I'm basically
from Santa Cruz, and I go to all the SC/Watsonville/Bonny Doon stuff.... Any
info someone wanna tell me? Mail me direct or mail through here!

Jello, mijos!
 There is afull moon this sunday being thrown by a collective of systems, 
djs, and positive people (you know, all those ravers).
 It is being thrown by a large, diverse group to make it a community 
event, where everyone is welcome. It will start early (by full moon 
standards) on sunday nite/monday morning.
The collective intends to make these parties on the full moon 
consistently, and to have the participation of all systems, djs, or 
anyone who wants to help plan, carry, scout sites, or just spread the word.
 Info will be spread by word of mouth and for this party, on several 
system's voice-mails, in different area codes. So just call your friendly 
neighborhood sound system later this week! (I'll post later, thursday 
pm...)
 Remember to spread it word of mouth to non-sfravers, and to tell people 
which systems to call....

Lotsa love (oooh, it's happening!!!!)
 Milton and the E-Bee...

Flowers are our only treasure, and through them our friendship grows

	Does anyone else think that DJ Erica looks uncannily like Jen 
from the movie Kids?  (not to imply anything about her character, of 
course)

p.s. She's also a great DJ--I'd like to see her out there more often.  
Yay more women DJs!

We're still going to Panther beach tonight for a 
drum/dij/food/fire/whatever else you can think of gathering. All are 
welcome.  In fact, if you need a ride from CalTrain or a place to crash 
just call me  :)  All you have to bring is friends, food to 
share if you can, drums or other noise makers, fire wood, or just 
yourself and warm vibes.  We really hope some of you can make it.  We 
will be there from 6:30-till we get tired.

I noticed that too, although I'll agree with Reagan that Erika's the better
DJ and is cuter. =)

btw, she spells it Erika.

	Two albums which do not appear in the 'ambient/techno' bin 
at your local record store, but are nonetheless brilliant ambienty works, 
are:

	Passion (Last Temptation of Christ soundtrack)
	Blade Runner Soundtrack--1994 release

big huge recommendations on these ones from Jon.

I need to know of a rave this weekend that will definitly have an ambient
space.  My girlfriend Phelps is doing a study for one of her Anthropology
classes and she has to observe a group of people over a period of time.  She
chose ambient rooms at raves as her topic.  Thus our need for a rave with an
ambient room.  Please suggest if you can.  I know about the boat party
Friday, but we're not sure we want to kick down $20, and I'm not even sure
if tickets are still available.  Thank you in advance.  She as well as I
will really appreciated it.

Thanx all!  You guys are totally amazing.  :)  I tried to respond to
everyone personally but the flood of email got beyond my control.  We gotta
be the BEST people in the whole wide world!!!!

Considering that this morning I spent a while walking up and down the same
two blocks with three screaming cats in carriers and a litterbox, as my
home is being fumigated today, and then when I got to work people started
screaming at me again ... I REALLY needed all your funny/caring messages.
:)

Special thanx go to Wayne C. & Dave P. for phoning, and to Andy K. for
sending me his list of stress busters, that was GREAT!

*GREAT BIG HUGS AND SMOOCHES*

I WILL SURVIVE!!!!

k :)

A VERY good CD collection to look out for is The Ambient Cookbook, which
besides being a steal (4 CDs for $34 canadian ... not bad!) is full of the
most amazing, luscious, rich, sensual tracks around!!!  Sorry, I can't for
the life of me remember the label ... but it's worth the hunt. :)

Hi all - 

I have a friend from Berlin who is traveling to the Eugene/Seattle/
Vancouver area(s) over the next couple of weeks on a fairly 
flexible schedule. Are there particular events of note that I 
should alert her to?

Thanks!

X.

Yes, I've been cooped up all week with a case of the chicken pox.  Yea, 
if you've never had em, your never too old to get em :(
After spacin out for the last few days with up and down fevers, today I 
felt much more energized and was able to do some dancing in my apartment. 

Sporting a new psychadelic look with pokadots all over me, I'm feeling 
back in the groove. Yes the joy of letting the vibrations run through me, 
as I dance are giving me a faster recovery.  With all my pokadots, its 
nice to be able to dance like a freak while I look like a freak.  
Though I probably look kinda freaky without the pokadots as well.  
Probably why I sometimes like to dance freaky.

Even though I'm not able to join all you freaky and non-freaky dancers 
out there on the dance floor just yet, I'm still dancing with you all.
See ya soon,
:)
peter

   No autumn slowdown this year - we have a full weekend again! I can't
   really decide between the four parties on Friday night - check 'em out
   yerselves. On Saturday, there are a couple of cool outdoor
   undergrounds - Frequency 8 and Lift Off!; if you'd rather have hot,
   Wicked is the place to be. Sunday should have some full moon action;
   in addition to the Wicked full moon (if it is on Sunday), some of the
   other collectives are pulling together for another party, call around
   on Sunday night for more info...

 Many people have always had valad/invalid reasons for complaining about 
the Wicked full moon. 

I want to suggest to you that behind the innocent motives of the majority there 
are issues of a highly personal nature which will no doubt become apparent 
and poisonous as this drama unfolds.

I will be highly entertained as I am exploiting the rave scene for surfing and 
beer.

I'm coming up this weekend.  I've been on SF Raves for about 6 mos. now & 
haven't met anyone yet.  I will be at Ultimatum Friday night & Wicked 
Saturday night!

Quick Bio:

I moved from the Bay Area in Dec. '94 to Orange County.  (Don't know 
why.. temporary insanity!)  I'm planning on moving back to San Fran in 
February.

I'm 5'7" tall, long light-blonde hair, very long dark fingernails, 
aqua-blue eyes.  I'm usually dressed in all black & wear above-the-knee 
stockings & never stop dancing (only short stops for water & ladie's 
room!)

Hopefully I'll meet some of you this weekend!!

To all you beloved weirdo SFraver types,

Okay.  I need a break, and I was wondering if anyone in SF wants to go grab
some coffee tonight.  I get off work at 8:00, so I'm free anytime after
that.  Transportation will be provided.  Just give me a call at 666-6668 or
drop me a line here, whatever's more convenient.

SUBJECT: Texas raves?

In a about a week I'll be going to Dallas on a business trip and
would like to check out the scene while I'm there.  If anyone
has any suggestions as to events/places to go I'd love to hear
them.  I'll be there Oct. 14 - Oct. 21.

Also, if there's a Texas/Dallas rave list, does anyone know how to
get on it??  Thanks.

I can remember 2 summers ago,  when "Your Sisters House" featured all
women DJ's,  such as Laura,  Susan,  Polliwog,  and a few others I can't
recall.   They were every Thursday,  and were really great.   I went every
week,  and danced until 4 am dispite the fact that I had a daytime job.

Lets try to bring YSH back again....

     I was never an active member of the Your Sisters' House collective, 
     but I helped when I could and DJed with them a number of times.
     
     From what I learned from other women who were actively involved, it 
     was a *lot* of work to find an all-ages space every week where they 
     could have a donation-only ($5 suggested) party.
     
     Liz Roberts had a lot of committment and personal energy, and got the 
     YSH ball rolling.  She wasn't working at the time, so was able to 
     spend a lot of hours space hunting.  
     
     Liz moved back to New York in November of 1993 (yes it was THAT long 
     ago).  The remaining Sisters attempted regular parties, but space 
     after space fell through.  Susan and Maui did their best to pick up 
     the ball, and even got a few parties off the ground.  Last I heard, 
     Susan had moved back to Florida to spend a little time with her 
     parents.
     
     I'm a bit out of touch, so feel free to add more information.
     
     Your Sisters' House was a great party, that's for sure!  But I wonder, 
     after looking at the jam-packed SFRaves calendar, if we need another 
     party in this town.  San Francisco has enough going on to make up for 
     the rest of the country it seems.
     
     On the other hand, YSH's mission to provide a space for women DJs and 
     to grow an "old girl's network" was admirable, and I do miss it.
     
     Laura

Hey everyone!

Once looking at a solar calendar we soon realized that the full moon is 
actually on Saturday night/Sunday morning.  So... the full moon will now 
be on Saturday night!  Today Claire, John, Milton, and I went scouting 
for sites.  We found a beautiful never-before-used location south of San 
Francisco.  The lineup will be secured later tonight along with the 
numbers of sound systems to call to find out directions and will then be 
posted, so stay tuned.......

Love, 

Joy

Hello to one and all.
I guess I ought to introduce myself, as I have been lurking on the 
list for a while.. keeping silent... observing.  

I'm 25 years old and just moved here about a month and a half ago 
from Rochester, NY.  My brother moved out here in December and he 
talked me into coming out and living with him.   I have been going 
through a major transitional stage in my life... suffering from some 
pretty heavy depression and I figured some change of scenery would do 
me good.  Instead I found myself in a strange new place, away from my 
close friends and with no job, and very stressed.  Needless to say my 
first weeks in San Francisco were not enjoyable...
The first really good experience I had in San Francisco was my  first 
rave.  It was at Goats Rock and I never experienced anything like it 
in my life.  We didn't leave Berkeley till about midnight and it took 
almost 2 hours to get there.  I had no idea what to expect... all I 
knew was that it was late, I was in a bad mood, and I felt like I was 
being kidnapped against my will.  But when I got there the music was 
just starting and I just felt all this good energy.  Everyone was so 
friendly and unpretentious. For the first time I was able to put my 
anxieties at rest for a while.  I just danced all night.
The only bad part of the night was feeling nausea for a little while 
after I took some e.  I had never taken it before and to tell you the 
truth, apart from the nausea I don't think it really effected me.  My 
brother and his friend both had some also, and they said it was good 
stuff, so I knew it was me.  I gave it a second chance when I went to 
another rave in the City... the rave was just as good, but the 
effects of the e were the same.  
So I was wondering... has anyone else had this experience (or non-
experience)  or know of anyone who did.  Does e effect different 
people differently based on biochemistry et al.? I have the same non-
reaction to pot... people tell me it's because I haven't smoked it 
enough, but I definitely think I've given it more that enough of a 
chance.  It only makes me sleepy and "zone out."  I'm just starting 
to think I'm biochemically out of sink with most people.
Well that's it... thanks for listening... and thanks for the good 
times... like I said raving is one of the few things that has giving 
me true content feelings in a long time.  The two raves I been to 
have been oasis's in an otherwise difficult time in my life.  I hope 
to meet some of you in person soon.

While I have heard that YSH threw some great parties, is your view 
that growing any type of "old (insert elitest personage term) network" really 
admirable? What the hell difference does it make what 
sex/color/orientation/religious persuasion a D.J. is? If they are good 
they're good, if they suck they suck. I find it really pitiful that it makes 
such a difference to so many people.

     Hey all, now that I'm out in Cali I thought that I'd try and spread the
word for a friend of mine out in NY.  He's a hard acid house DJ, that was a
pioneer of the upstate NY scene.  About 6 years ago he was spinning
industrial and then in '93 he moved over towards some of what he plays now.
 If any of you might have any spaces for someone as such, I'd be happy to
supply a demo tape.  He'll be out here this spring, or if you want to fly him
out he'd work for nothing just to try and break in the the SF scene.  Any
replies appreciated!

Hello and welcome.  As to whether e effects different people different
ways, as with all drugs, this is the case.  Also, if you're taking any
meds for depression, you will probably feel less effect depending on
what you're taking.

But I doubt that you need to take it at all, or even worry about why
you can't feel it.  Many people don't "get" raves until they take e.
You however, seem it have the vibe spot on already.  I think that if
you are dancing and enjoying the music, you are getting more out of
your activity than perhaps some of those who are high.

In fact, if you are indeed clinically depressed, taking e is a bad
idea.  The comedown can lead to a more depressed state than you had
ever imagined.  Luckily, this doesn't seem to be the case so far.  

The magic of the music and fellowship with those feeling that magic is
a tool you can use for healing yourself.  You have opened your eyes to
the beauty of movement and music;  now if you reflect on how this ties
in with your life and the rhythms of the universe you will have had a
revelation that others have achieved (usually only fleetingly) through
psychedelic drugs.

Still got the urge to burn stuff? There's a party happening on the beach in
Pacifica this Saturday night. Check it, check it.

We were feeling bummed about being back from BM so we gathered at the
beach last week and it was so much fun we are doing it again.
It willl be at Linda Mar Beach in Pacifica (also known as Taco Bell
Beach). We had a gihumungous fire & more drums than we needed, & lots of
other recreational fun stuff. The BM Drummers Collective will be
there again and the only thing you need to bring is something that
burns.

            BEACH PARTY

Drums* Dance* Ritual* flesh

        October 7th, 1995
Linda Mar Beach, Pacifica

>From SF - 280 to hwy 1S 3rd traffic light, turn right into beach
parking lot taco bell will be on the right next to the lot. We will
be located to the North about 200 yrds from the lot.

Bring drums, wine, combustibles, effigies, etc., No ruitual has been
planned but wear white just in case. Low profile in parking lot until
it gets dark. Although no one bothered us last time, some neighbors
around there actually brought drums and joined us. Good vibes.

See you there,

Not only will there be a full moon in the sky but very near the moon is 
Saturn, visible to the naked eye. Saturn is a big ball of gas and is the root of 
the adjective - saturnine. The surf has been exceptional lately.

It's great that you have enough experience with women (and other minority)
DJs that you can conclude that "it makes no difference." I, on the other
hand, have not had the opportunity to hear many women DJs. I think they may
have a different approach than what I'm used to and I'd like more
opportunities to find out. YSH's problem keeping spaces is a small (but
crippling) part of how difficult it is to get something new out to people
without a supportive community to push for and inspire continued participation.

My experience with with "minority" DJs has lead me to conclude that it
doesn't make a difference at all.  I can listen to a tape of a set and
there is no way I could tell the gender, race, religion, sexual
orientation, etc. of the DJ.  This was not what I had expected, and I
think it's a positive sign that musical tastes in our scene transcend
these categories.

The YSH parties did provide a more nurturing environment with cheap/free
food, candles, discussion groups, and a pretty inclusive vibe that many
people liked, and I guess could be ascribed to a more female approach.

There was a perception at that time that there was a male-dominated
network of promoters and DJs that didn't give female DJs many chances to 
spin.  Back then, it was hard for *any* new talent to break into the
scene.  Things are different today though, with many grassroots
sound systems throwing parties.  Even though we still don't see a lot
of female DJs, I don't think it has anything to do with a "good-old-boy"
network.  The males at Pacific invited 4 different DJs to spin a Sunset
this year.  The more female dominated groups (Harmony and Gateway),
certainly haven't made a point of having more females spin at their
parties.  So I've come to the conclusion that the whole gender thing
in regards to DJing is a big non-issue.

Personally I could care less what gender/race/etc. a D.J. is. Does a 
woman D.J.'ing somehow alter the music being played? Is a record suddenly 
transformed into something else because a HUMAN BEING that happens to 
have female genetalia is touching it? The problem I have with your 
mindset is that it pigenholes people.

Hey all,

A few years back I wanted to research A so I went to Sac State to look 
at some books.  One book I encountered was written by someone who did 
some studies on the drug.  He said that the best (or one of) the ways 
to stop a bad trip was to take more A!  His theory was that the tripper 
was stuck on a plane of thought and either needed to be elevated above 
it of come down off of it.

I don't know if this would really work but once I was having a very 
uncomfortable trip and had some g-bud.  This made me re-peak and I 
began to feel great!  It mainly had to do with the gb but I definetly 
got way higher than I was before and all my stress and 
uncomfortableness went away.

love chris

Lessee.... Someone took too many drugs and can't cope. So lets give them 
more??? Oh yeah, that really sounds like a good idea.... I hope his 
theory isn't tried too much.

Women DJs were such a novelty in the beginning, and there was no real 
community for them.  Sure, there was the community of all DJs, but *THEY* were 
at the time quite an old boy's network.  Although some were nice and 
supportive, others were competitive assholes.  

The kind of mutual support and encouragement that some of the new women DJs 
was looking for was not always being provided, that sort of warm fuzzy 
sisterhood was part of what defined Your Sister's House.

Networking is GOOD, and there are times when people need to and SHOULD build 
networks.  The original old boy's DJ network served them and the rave scene 
well.  The YSH network served some women DJs well.  Remember that this was two 
years ago, and things have grown and changed since then.

If you think about it, this list is a sort of "old raver's network" or maybe a
"hopefully clued-in raver's network."  Is that so bad?

My experience with YSH was good and I enjoyed it.  I vastly appreciate what all 
the sisters were doing and what they accomplished:  throwing a weekly all-ages 
party -- usually a renegade -- in San Francisco.  By giving the spotlight to 
female DJs they encouraged and nurtured their presence in the scene.  Two years 
later, you can look at the SFRaves calendar and see many different women 
spinning.  Three years ago, it wasn't always the case.

Your Sisters' House can be thought of as an incubator -- it gave some women a 
start and a chance.  After that, of course, it was up the the individual.  And 
you can see that there are many women going strong.

In San Francisco for a very long while, it was difficult to get gigs if you were
a new DJ or new to the scene unless you started throwing your own parties, no 
matter how good you were.  The Your Sisters' House collective started throwing 
their own parties in part to get these women gigs and to get women involved with
all facets of rave planning and production.  I don't see anything wrong with 
what they did, just like I don't see anything wrong with the Friends and Family 
network, which basically got started so that the net ravers and net DJs could 
plan, put on, and play at a party.  Or how about when Pacific got started?  
People were joking that Galen had to go out and buy his own sound system and put
on parties just so he'd get a chance to spin:  he's an excellent DJ and at the 
time wasn't heard from that much.  Now that he's gotten the Pacific network 
started, there's been a whole batch of new people (Tracy comes vividly to mind) 
who have gotten going through that and have moved on to other things.

I think the big problem with what Black Adder said is the bit about "who cares 
... so long as they're good."  I agree with the "who cares" part, but the truth 
is that there still are few women DJs and are extremely few other minority rave 
DJs.  I see nothing wrong with organizing parties to spotlight minorities, be 
they stylistic minorities (like techno/hardcore), organizational minorities 
(like net DJs a few years ago), or human minorities (women, african-americans, 
visiting european DJs).  You, the party-goer, DON'T have to attend if you don't 
like the idea politically or spiritually.  But these "spotlight" parties are 
good incubators, and good ways of encouraging the targeted group (e.g. women and
YSH) to get involved.

Er ... no, this is NOT a good idea.  I think maybe this idea only worked
for this particular person.  I know that most of the times when I feel
frightened on A trips its because I already feel like maybe I'm too high,
so giving ME more A would probably send me into overload ....

I believe I know which book he's talking about. I believe it's from the
"Psychedelic Reader" which is a compilation of medical notes and journals
from well known psychiatrists and psychologists.  I have the book at home
and I'll post more about it when I get a chance.  I believe the entry was
written by a clinical psychologist, possibly even Leary.  The gist of it
was that people get caught in a sort of downward spiral and one of the
techniques that the psychologists used to pull people out of it was to dose
them again.  The context of this literature is set in the early days of
psychedelic experimentation by medical professionals.  Please keep that in
mind.

Duuuuuuude!

That's an awesome idea!  I was totally feelin' the same way.  I have *NEVER* 
been to a FMR and am really wanting to experience it, but I had such a great 
time at Freq.8 that I want to go there too.  What to do, what to do!!!  I am 
so, so torn cause I also want to go to WICKED, I *love* those parties!

Maybe if we can get enough people to cheer for it, they'll be into it.  Don't 
want to step on any toes, however.  *PEOPLE*, this would be a lovely and rare 
opportunity to unite and celebrate in a beautiful place with great people and 
music.  

Please support the promoters and DJ's to compromise and agree on a great idea.  
Let's help build unity throughout and throw a gargantuanly good party!

Peace

Rikki

Hey Rikki-

Thanks for your message - your list, coming at the end of a bad week for 
me, made me step back a minute and take a look at all the good things 
I've got going on, and all the good things going on out there. I needed 
that perspective!

Have a good weekend everyone.

Kathryn

Just a thought on the dj Erica lookalike Jen bit.  WHO 
CARES???????????  I am so thrilled to see a sliver more recognition 
for female dj's.  It's the music they spin not what they look like 
that I'm into.  MORE WOMEN DJ'S!!!  Thing is, they're out there, and 
they're good.  Let's find them.

Yes, and isn't this true with almost any given group of people, be it 
D.J.'s, Christians, gays, whites, etc.? In any given group you have nice 
people, complete assholes, and all points in between.

I have no issue with YSH. As I have said previously I have heard only 
good things about them.

Networking is good. What I have taken umbrage to is the statement that an 
"old-girls-network" is good. This term holds all the negative 
connotations of "old-boy-network," which include elitism, closed-door 
meetings, and power-brokering, none of which are "good" except of course 
for the members of the network.

Again, I have no problem with networking, as long as it is not a closed 
loop.

An incubator is for someone that can not survive on their own. Are you 
saying that somehow women D.J.'s were somehow inferior to males, and 
couldn't survive on their own? I don't believe that. It takes the same 
thing it takes to do anything: desire, and drive. With these two things 
if someone wants to do something and an opportunity is not handed to 
them, they will MAKE the opportunity. This is not gender-specific.

Thank you for illustrating my point. Desire and drive got all these 
groups where they are. While I do not know enough about YSH to comment, 
with regards to the other groups I can safely say that they invite people 
from different groups to spin. Hell, I saw Galen not D.J.'ing the last 
Sunset just so other people got the chance to spin. That was a truly 
beautiful thing. These groups made themselves. Their vision encourages 
people to come to their gigs. From what I have seen that vision is not 
gender specific with regards to ANY portion of organization of or the 
party itself.

I think the big problem with your view is that people, whatever their 
background need prodding and encouragement in order to D.J. If there is a 
lack of women/minorities D.J.'ing in the scene, it is because of a lack 
of desire and drive. The ones that are doing it are there because they 
had these qualities. As far as "spotlight" parties, all this does is 
encourage seperatism, which is something that I hope this scene is NOT 
about. If someone needs special opportunities and coddling to do 
something, they should just stay the hell home, because they obivously 
don't want it bad enough. Welcome to the real world.

I think this is a bad idea. A very bad idea. What a sick n' twisted 
more-is-better solution! There are lots of single books out there that
are utter quackery, and just because one can write a book doesn't mean
you are right. A better bet would be to liberalize the "ethics" behind
having refereed scientific journals, allowing such research to be
judged by scientific peers prior to publication. Although this tends to
keep out lots of interesting fringe, or new-wave findings, it also
tends to reduce the number of snake oil salesmen willing to look like
idiots in front of their peers. After all, if you want to read
quackery, there's always the internet!

Double plus bad on this if you're actually having a bad trip, as
opposed to just feeling "blah" ... I've seen plenty of bad trips begun
because too much GB was done. (And I'm not talkin' bout limeys
either!). If you're feeling just blah -- definitely take two GBs, along
with a double dose of hardcore dancing preferably with a trip-approved
DJ... And don't forget to call your superego in the morning and tell
him/her what you think... 

If you're feeling worse than blah, try doing something completely
different from the place/situation/people that you're currently in (not
necessarily alone, bring a friend!) -- keep your mind busy by trying to
deal with understanding new external stimuli, rather than doing
infinite positive feedback loops on some thought you're obsessing on.
If you're chilling, force yourself to dance. If you're dancing, force
yourself to chill, if you're indoors, go outside, if you're outdoors go
inside, if you're hot, get cold, and if yer cold, put your clothes back
on and quit biting off that woman's navel ring!

This is all IMHO, YMMV, TANSTAAFL, BIG OLD NO GOOD HIGH INTELLIGENCE TREAT!

Speechless is pretty much the best description i can give.

Musically, incredible.  Going back and forth between 
really housey tracks and solid techno/acidy tracks,
but the beat kept pounding and POUNDING.

at one point it was almost hard to breathe because my 
face/body was vibrating so much.  

But aside from the music, the man is scary.
I mean, not personally, personally, he is this really nice, jovial guy.
Although he would get a pretty intense look while being in the music,
when he looked up at the crowd for a bit, he would get a smile,
and was laughing & joking with people around him.

But his mixing ability is scary.  I know i have never seen
someone THAT in control of his or her records.
I definitely believe he could mix blindfolded and probably with
his hands tied behind his back.

I wish i could describe how amazing it was. If you sneezed when he
started off, he had already mixed through 4 records.  (okay..
it was like in the first two minutes, but still...)

Basically, he would pick out a record, listen in his headphones
to match the beats (which i think always took under a minute
if not 30 seconds) then he'd pull off his headphones,
watch the crowd, rock to the music, or start getting another record.
while he's doing all this, and talking to other people, he's
mixing the records in and out.  One time he was talking to someone
and without stopping the conversation, he started tweaking one of the
spindles to get it right,  then he stopped talking a bit later
to throw in some scratching and finish up the mix, and then hopped
back into the convo.

there were so many times last nite where my jaw literally fell open
at what i was seeing

if you are alive on sunday after moontribe, definitely check
him out in santa monica

     Hey all, yet again I'm stuck in Santa Cruz without a ride to a party, so
if you are feeling charitable enough to schlep me along to anything this
weekend I'll be more than willing to fork over some greens (money that is).
 If so, drop me a line here or call me up at 408-423-5963 (ask for Laughlin,

I was going to respond to Phed's post but trash it by mistake...anyway The
place to go to tonight should be Freaky 1 year Anniversity..I'm not sure
about the other DJ's...but I no for a fact that DJ BioJeff is one of the best
I've ever heard..IMO..his is one of the only ones that just send me to
another planet...I can honestly say I leave my body and float away. When he
spins it just gives me goose bumps and no matter what kind of mood I'm in, I
can listen to him live or put in on of the tapes I have of him spinning..I
just put a grin on my face and say "It's Great to be alive" and a rush of
happiness flows through me. Anyway I just wanted to let you know what I
thought and I'm sure some of you have heard him. He also spins at Luna C in
Sacramento on Weds if you want to check him out. Soo if you don't do anything
tonight, this is a must. For those that know and has heard BioJeff spin, you
know it's worth checking out tonight.
 
Tim (knucklehead)  Hoping to see some of you there tonight.  :-)

Well, then please excuse my semantics.  Please stop over-analysing what I

Pish-posh!  Cold-shmold!  "It doesn't get cold around here," thus sayeth a
Buffalo freak.

Why, when I was a lad your age, we used to tow our systems on a sled and
hope the records didn't freeze.  I've been to raves so cold icicles would
form off everyone's piercings.  In the snow, people would dance on
cardboard boxes and every once in a while light theirs on fire to warm up
their feet!  You must have seen the great line of Stussy earmuffs for
sure?!

Cold....HA!

Hi...   I may have to remove the Sunset review from my Web pages,  although

Although I took great care not to give out any phone numbers,  or specific
information on Sunset,  and just focused on the good vibe and pictures,
there is concern for too much exposure.   So if you haven't seen it yet,
check it out,  in case I get the official word.

Well, if everything occurs in cycles...which I think is a pretty much 
reasonable and usually true assumption,

then,

by taking more and more and more acid, you should eventually end up where 
you started.



but where would that be?

Excused. As far as analysing what people say, you may be partially 
correct, as I have a tendancy to take people very, very seriously. I do 
not agree that I have made too much of it however, as it illustrates some 
apparant problems that exist not only in the rest of the world, but our 
community as well. This does go beyond the charter of S.F.Raves, so consider 
it dropped, unless you wish to debate the matter privately.

Okay, here's the "FMR and FMR overlap" schedule of events (not everthing,
just the ones that come to mind):

Saturday night:
        Freq-8
        Communal FMR
        Wicked at King Street

Sunday night:
        Wicked FMR

hello beautiful people.

i want to share with you a few of my thoughts about the Mission Vortex
experience that's happening in the mission tonight. of course, it's all
conjecture until the moment the rave actually goes off, but i can tell you a
bit about what's been happening behind the scenes, and what the aspirations
of the people who are putting it on are. 

the subname of the Vortex is "a healing rave," and this is the emphasis - one
of them, at least - of tonight's celebration. we're coming together to share
our creative energies, share our lust for life, share our own joys with each
other, and in so doing, heal ourselves. healing implies a previous wound, but
this isn't what i'm talking about. in this case, healing is bringing parts of
the self and the community together to create something new and beautiful
and... enchanted. 

i should tell you now that i'm not the designated spokesperson for the Vortex
- i'm just one of the many volunteers. but among this new community, i am one
of the most active people on sfraves (even though few of you may know me; and
if you do know me, it's probably from my "three c's" posting from many moons
back), so i'm typing you this information on my lunchbreak to appeal to those
of you who have similar ideals to join our celebration. 

art. there's a strong emphasis on art here. artistic expression, artistic
life. i'm a writer and visual artist, and everyone who's involved brings
their own unique talent to the experience. there are poets, dancers,
musicians, painters... 

a few more things before i have to go back to work. i set up a small shrine
near the entrance. you're welcome to bring things to contribute to it, if you
want - flowers, beads, bits of colored string, whatever. 

my name is shalom and i'll be there all night. if you want to find me to
welcome you or just to chat, well, i'm not sure how you'll do that. my
identifying characteristics are this: my facial hair is somewhere between
thick stubble and a young beard, i have shoulder-length copper hair, and blue
eyes. i'm 24.

this should be a wonderful, empowering night. i hope to see you there. things
start early, around 9ish, and go until dawn, i imagine. directions: 2519
mission at 21st. or call dino at 510.428.1961 or me at 510.525.6088.

hope to see you there. 

shalom

Subject: Maui Rave Report

Scruton here...

trying my best to do a crunch-style rave report from the sunny island
  of Maui (no, i didn't see brian and laura anywhere)   
;) ;) ;) 

first things first; it was HOT there; 90 degrees pluss every day...
  they set record high lows (i'll let you guys figger that one out!)
    on 3 daze...
i was staying in Kihei, a very dry place. Parts looked like the Malibu or
  central Ca coastline, very scrubby and dry; Hana is over 50 miles away,
    over a 10000-foot volcano, where it REALLY rains.  btw, there's a
      killer supercomputer center in Kihei (dat's why iwuz there)
        goto http://www.mhpcc.edu and checkit out...
word came 'round on Friday from a highschool teacher in the supercomputer
  class that there was going to be an event in the Haiku Cannery, in
    the Hookipa area, slightly up-country.  it sounded too good to be true,
      being only about 15 miles from Kihei.

yes, virginia, there Is a scene on Maui.

on saturday, i drove alllll the way to the very north tip of the island, to
  where Karl, the teacher, said i'd find 'hobbit-land', and sure enuf, after
     driving thru about 20 miles of narrow and single-lane roads with 
       700-foot cliffs off the side of the road, no guard rails, and
          speeding yuppies in big,wide cars coming the other way from the
       Kapalua area, there it was.
hobbit-land looks like it gets used as a motocross track a lot; there's lotsa
  dirt tracks going up and down a very hilly and wind-carved landscape.
all around, there were hundreds, if not thousands of little pyramidal stacks
  of rocks, like the kind you find along hiking trails...  along with the 
    crashing, violent ocean, there was a blowhole there (not going off, 
      maybe 'cause the swell wuz from the wrong direction or something), 
      and a very strange rock formation which looked alot like the little
    rock stacks.  all in all, a VERY surreal place; the grass looked like
  it had just been mown, from the intense wind.
i was told that at night, the conditions settle down, and fullmoons and
  such are done out there, VERY far from the real world.

anyway, on saturday, i got down to what appears to be the official Maui
  version of ameba (minus the t-shirts), the New York Deli.  it is across
    the street from Kamaole Beach 1, in Kihei, in the Dolphin Plaza,
      879-1115... when i got there at 9, the crowd had diminished a bit from
    whut it wuz at 7pm, wups! late again...
Karl's brother, Kevin, dropped by around 10, and we swooped by his place
  so he could get shoes and dinner, and made it out to Haiku around 12:30

there was a BIG crowd there, maybe 500 people or more, looked alot like a
  friends&family event, but people were crawling all over the outside of the 
    building outside, and there was a crowd of about 200 outside the main
      door. when we got in, the TOTAL area was about 500 square feet, and
        PACKED and HOT, further driving home the fnf parallels. there was
      a happy-balloon person right next to the concession stand, nicely
    integrated into the operation; there was a nice laser projection
    of space shuttles and whaletales and the like, and the music was pretty
  good, kinda quite, tho.

around 1am, or 1/2 hour after we arrive, the HPD shows up; i'm right next
  to the turntables when an officer states loudly to the DJ (forrest, robbie?)
    to TURN THE SOUND OFF NOW!  he then stentorarily bellows out:
      "the party is over. go home. thanks you for your participation".
    we snuck up to the messanine where the laser was, and sorta slummed
   around for a half hour, and then people started filtering in again.
 the room got packed again, the music started, right back to were it all
  was before, and then the HPD came in AGAIN and  had the DJ rig the 
   headphones into a mike, upon which they said "there are too many people, 
    you are in violation of the fire code" (fnf, anyone???) ;)

welllllll, the promoter said "OK! we're movin g OUTDOORS!" and said
  everyone would show up at the Maui Racetrack (yup, there's one in the
    middle of a bunch of cane fields on the road to Kihei)
we got there at the head of a long procession of clueless people, with
  nice HPD cars waving us on every mile along the road (NARF!!!)
    and drove inland and upland along about a mile or two of gravelly, 
      VERY non-racetrack dirt roads to a large clearing.
ouch. the generator never made it, the dj never made it, it was a 
  big bail.  we stuck it out until 2:30, when Kevin had to split (my ride)
    for a flight to Oahu at 5:00.

moral of the story: there is definitely a scene in Maui, but it needs some
  support and organization.  i begged the people at New York Deli to sub
    to sfraves at least, so they can talk about their scene a little bit
      and maybe get some DJ's in there...
oh, btw DJ Taylor was spinning on Oahu that very same nite ;)

datsallfolks!

Hey everyone,

Lotsa stuff going on 'round these parts. 

I was at Cyberfest promoting. One of the first things that came to my 
mind was how disapointing it was to see all these people wandering 
around "looking for something". After talking with some of the people, my 
impression was that many of them were there because they had heard how 
"special" our gatherings can be. Since they have no conection with the 
underground, this was their "window" to see what raves are all about.

In my obervations over the last few years, I've come the  conclusion 
that there are three types of promoters:

1)	Those who are serious about what they do, but don't care about 
	the people they're providing for.

2)	Those who care about the people, but aren't serious about what 
	they're doing.

3)	And the handful that are serious AND care (truly care, that is, 
	with their heart and souls). 


Seems like the promoter of Cyberfest fit in #1 (he was serious - about 
making money- but didn't care jack for those there, or so it seemed). It's  
too bad, since there were many people receptive and willing to open 
themselves up, but lacked the encouragement of a positive environment to do so.

Which leads me to the topic of environment at our events. 

Seems many of us (including myself) are gettin very picky about the 
environment at parties. From talking with others, it's not so much the 
music anymore, but the environment in which everyone is to enjoy that 
music. 

The music might be great, but if the environment's not conducive to 
relaxing and encouraging openness, or if there's a majority of attitide 
around, then what's the  point?

Further, if the people throwing the party for are doing it for 
"different" reasons (be it self-interest or otherwise), people 
eventually pick up on that and get discouraged. 

It appears some people are discouraged with the way Full Moons are 
conducted and want to try and do something different. For what ever 
reasons, this is creating misunderstandings amony the various 
collectives, thus causing conflict. 

Is this community about conflict? 

I often wonder if we humans will ever get beyond our 
misunderstandings and conflicts, being able to actually work 
together to achieve a common goal. Perhaps it's just an ideal?


Personally, I don't see a problem with two FMR's. Might help to keep 
them more intimate. 

Then again, I don't know ALL the details regarding these misunderstandings, 
so I'm curious to see how things will work out.

Haven't done a boat party yet, so I might see some of you there.

later...

Jonas

Just to geek out a little bit...

Now that MSN allows transport of executable code over email, code that is 
run without any security checks (i.e., not like Java) then it is entirely 
possible to send someone with an MSN account a program that could do 
anything it wanted to their computer.  Just call the attached program 
"Click me for hot sex" or something to guarantee people launch it.

Once again, NOD NOD NOD! Black adder has taken a really harsh defensive
ATTITUDE about this whole discussion. mellow out a little bit ms. adder, no
one is trying
to say anything negative about women or them being inferior to men. stop
reading into what people are saying. it just sounds like your trying to get
people riled up. this could be a positive discussion about the female aspect
of the dj/rave scene and it is being turned into a shallow one-sided blown
out of proportion argument. lets stay positive here folks.... plur         =

I have not been defensive about this issue at all. And if you had taken 
the time to read the post thoroughly, you would know that the direction 
of the discussion had little to do with women being inferior to men. The 
issue was why it made such a difference to people what sex a D.J. is. 

This discussion is also anything but shallow. There is nothing wrong 
being serious about a serious matter. What is shallow is telling people to 
remain positive all the time. And what ever you do, do not call someones' 
viewpoint shallow and then sign your message with PLUR like it makes it 
all better. Learn the meaning of the term(s).

I personally know two people that e will not affect, no matter what the

The full moon will be at 8:45 a.m. exactly.  At that moment the sun will 
shine on the visible surface of the moon reflecting the light of the 
sun.  At 9:04 a.m. a lunar eclipse will occur putting the earth between 
the sun and the moon.  Throughout history the full moon has been a crazy 
time.  The magnetic field effects the tides and water.  Being 3/4 made of 
water humans are also effected.  We all love the moon, it reminds us of 
change and the cycles we are in.  How we celebrateit and work within it's 
cycles is special.  respecting and giving to it's energy is important and 
there are many celebrations world wide.  She is not owned and continously 
changes as do most things...  Lets respect each others celebrations and 
love the moon.  Celebrate with your tribe and let others celebrate with 
theirs.  Maybe someday we will be able to give the moon together.

  Well all, once again I'm stuck at home watching the paint peel and
ovserving my lawn grow, and I can't help but contribute it to being a lagger
and not asking for a ride until 2 days before an event.
      If any of you can give somebody in Santa Cruz, a ride to ANY party next
weekend, I'll be willing to pay gas, and the drivers ticket, food, whatever,
but I GOTTA get to a party!  I've been in California for more than a month
now, and I still haven't made any friends (I go to Santa Cruz high school,
and nobody seems to like me there, but I swear I'm not a horrible mean person
;'P) and I've just got happy feet... I need to dance!.  Hell... I'll even
ride in your trunk if all the seats are full!  Well, enough whining... either
drop me a line here, or call me at 408-423-5963.  If I not home, you can page
me at 408-684-4843 (I'll probably be at home though... I haven't found
anything to do besides playing with my computer yet ;'P)  Thanx in advance!

I think people sould get riled up a bit more often. Maybe then they'd get
off their collective ass and do something besides telling other people to
sit down.

You do a good job of telling BA how to conduct a discussion without actually
adding anything to the conversation. "mellow out" "stop" "stay" Very slick.
That, and ending the message with the ideological hammerblow "plur," putting
you in firm possession of The Law, with BA as the transgressor. Forty lashes
with a lollipop.

This is one of the few discussions on here that have _not_ degenerated into
pithy interpretation and reading-between-the-lines - it has stayed pretty
"face-value". There are a few lines of argument going on here, though, NOT
centered on "what COULD be, if.." I am most concerned with "what is," and
frankly I think (and I'm embarassed to say) that the main discussion here
has to do with who's viewpoint provides the most open future for women in
the rave scene. It's kind of like 4th grade recess, but it's sort of a
perverse exercise for me in that way (I liked 4th grade). This is how I
figure out what my point of view is: by talking about it (I could make the
case that, at least around here, "argument" is some sort of taboo to be
avoided and that people will naturally be defensive toward it). I defy you
to identify the one-sidedness operating here, unless you're confusing
"one-sided" with "perspective." That's right, a challenge. But I just want
to know what you're talking about and where you're coming from; it doesn't
mean I want to beat you up.

eh?

This one lost it at about 1:15am when campus cops came by and
sent out searchlights, at which point everyone panicked.
Then again, what else do Davis cops have to do with their time?

If one of the two ladies from Berkeley, mail me back for next Friday.

hello all-
hope you all had fun last night at the various gatherings, be it FMR,

a new job singing each sunday morning!  it pays well, which it must, for it
cuts into my saturday night raving schedule!

if any of you are awake between 10 and 11 this morning, send whatever
positive energy you can muster to the intersection of 8'th and geary in san

There has been discussions about the discomfort arguing causes many 
people on the list.  I, like many others on the list, try and avoid 
conflict as much as I can - whether that be good or bad is up to you.
However I don't believe in keeping everything sugar coated - it ends up 
becoming fake, and we want to keep our community as real and raw as we 
can, right?   I think there is a BIG difference in disagreeing and just 
calling people stupid and lame and flaming them. The main element we need 
to remember when disagreeing with someone is to ****RESPECT**** their 
opinion.  It is just as valid as yours, and this is a PERSON you are 
talking to, not just words on a computer screen. I don't mind reading 
about arguements on this list - I can learn alot by weighing the pros and 
cons of each side of the arguement and hopefully come away with a better 
perspective on it.   A 
flame war just makes me sad and I push the d button w/o reading the post 
because pointless fighting solves nothing.  I like constructive, not 
destructive.  

love,
Amy

       You know I  have been calling the # also for the last 2 hours and 
of course I get the same response;(. A good point was brought up by BA, 
that since Pacific and co. already were down in Santa Cruz for the Full 
Moon, then thet might just be keeping Sunset down there in Santa Cruz as 
well???? If this is true boy oh boy are there going to be some burnt 
people;). I think that I'm just going to chill locally in Concord, going 
to bed at 7 this a.m. doesn't do a body good. For those that went to 
Sunset, I want a review.
                               LOVE AND HUGSSS-

As the self-appointed official police negotiator, I got to talk to a very 
amused officer of the UCD police department. He claimed that they had 
recieved a noise complaint and therefore had to shut the party down, 
though he was almost apolegetic about doing it. Where the noise complaint 
came from has us confused, becase the only things out where we were are 
horses, weeds, and I80. But he was nice enough to give me advice on 
less-bustable locations for future events. He also complemented us on 
keeping a low profile and that if they hadn't recieved the noise 
complaint they probably wouldn't have found us.
To those who showed up: We thank you for your support. We hope you had a 
good time, even if it was only for two hours. We're sorry things 
couldn't have gone longer, but that is the nature of outdoor renegades. 
We had used that spot for parties before and gone all night, but this 
time I guess luck was not with us. We will not let this set us back and 
we will continue to throw small parties. Keep your eyes open in the 
future...
To those who didn't: Here's what you missed: A nice lawn surrounded by 
trees in a far corner of the UCD arboretum. A varied crows of 150-200 
peole ranging from ravers to gothics to punks to greeks. First DJ Jim 
(Twitch Records) started off what a nice house set. I followed with
about an hour of electro-breakbeats. Then DJ Thad came on and began
to cut up a wicked jungle set, much to the awe of a group UCD frat-boy 
types. Fifteen minutes later the cops showed up and everybody ran off.
We were out of there by 2 AM and moved the party to somebody's house.
No citations orarrests were issued.
Unfortunately, some piss-poor person(s) decided to show up and smashed 
out the window of DJ Jeyson's truck, stealing his speakers. DJ Flash's 
backpack also disappeared, with his new headphones and about 30 records.
In all, it was not the most positive experience for myself and the other 
members of the DORK posse, but we will try again. We hope to see you soon.

Just wanted to drop a note thanking those who sent back replies to my 
inquiry about e.... It's good to know I'm not the only one.  
I went to the Vortex "healing rave" last night.  It was different 
than anything I had ever experience... as have many other things in 
San Francisco been.  Anyway it was a drug free evening... but 
definitely not a high free evening.   Thanks to everyone there for 
the good vibes.

Umm, may I ask what the HELL happened to the full moon party last night?

It was a pretty long drive to find nothing but an empty beach...

I must say that the frequency 8 end-of-year event was one of the most
mind-expanding, vibe-catching, cool, on-the-mark events Ive been to in along
time....

It seemed even the slightly cold weather made an excuse for all us dancers to
pack together, brining a sense of closeness to the vibe.  And what a vibe it
was!  I haven't danced that much since...well, since last week.  
I'd have to send a shout to all of the DJ's that keept the vibe going w/o any
noticable breaks.  A special commidation to Mars for a command performance.
 He drew the crowd from lulls, to feet stomping, inhibiting releaseing,
make-you-want-to-jump up and down nekkid(which some did) super cool trance.

All in all it was a impressive showing, about 150-200 for a saturday that had
so many other events going on...
 
And catching several of us SFR's together just added icing to the cake (Rikki
remember, #5). It felt like some type of surreal reunion of sorts.  And
although many now can see that I don't socalize too much, for me it's the
vibe that keepsthis engine called Adam agoin'.  
The primary function of rave for me isn't the drugs, nor sex,  but the
vibe.....
(although having thoese two formers in my life dosen't hurt either.... ;->
  )


Smile'o'meter
Sets: 9.5Smiiles (All were tight. Cyr, Mars, Myster-E always tend to offset
each other w/thier styles..)
Vibe:  9.5smiles (just because a 10 would constitute a religous experiance,
or something)
Friendship factor: 9Smiles (happy cheery people,everywhere)
Danceability area: 8Smiles (actually a beach isnt the ideal dancing space,
but, after a whole summer one gets used to it)

Overall: A sound 9 everything was near perfect with the exception of one or
two "low" points in which I will not go into detail since it wasn't any fault
of the F8 crew...

In ending,
I guess that it proves in some sense that our scene is growing positively.
There was approx 5 events going on in the area and experiance tells me that
they all most likley had strong showings as well.  Yet another summer has
ended and usually this is the transition perod for all the big time promoters
to pop up (ie. Cool World's Casper et. al.).  I look foward to the new summer
and it's fresh crop of DJ's and maybe one or two new soundsystems.  But till
then, there's always the renagades and house parties....

Peace and love, 

Adam

Hey Kiddies,

I haven't been much of a reviewer, but after this weekend, I felt compelled
to throw in my .02 worth.

Friday night we went to Splish. I took my friend Jason, who just moved out
here from Kansas City, to his first SF rave. Needless to say, he had the
time of his life. I was a little disappointed in the harsh ending after we
docked. The trip was about 3 hours or so. I expected this to happen, but
even still, I didn't want to get booted at 4:00. Anyway, there was talk of
this or that still going on, but we decided to head home, big day ahead, ya
know. After about 2 1/2 hours of sleep, I jumped (crawled) out of bed and
blazed up to the Sierras and went Spelunking (cave exploring). This was
beyond incredible, I'm not going to get into any details here, just believe
me this was AMAZING ! I returned home around 9:30, and was totally spent. I
thought I may just stay home and go to bed. I went and saw Jason, and he
was hoping to go to F-8 (like we had originally planned), I had messages
from Wayne that a whole bunch of us would be going also. Then I checked my
e-mail, and say the posts from the great SFRavers going to F-8. OK, I'm
convinced, I really didn't want to miss the last F-8 of the year, and a
Full Moon !! We drug our butts out to the beach, with blankets, sleeping
bags, munchies, and water. We were set for another night of fun. This is a
REALLY beautiful setting, waves crashing, tiki torches burning, campfire
raging, music just flowing (the F-8 guys really have some different,
excellent tunes), and a small, intimate, beautiful, VIBEY crowd. I guess
what I'm trying to say is, this night was pure MAGIC. Well Jason was in
awe, he thought Splish was great, but after F-8 he was just blown away,
Welcome to California !! Welcome to SFRaves ! We crashed out on the beach,
and when we awoke, the place was deserted. Wayne and Andrea were packing
up, the sound system was all gone, we were the only ones left !! We decided
to get moving before the tide washed us away, it was about 5 feet away !!
As we climbed the path up the cliffs, we came upon a large speaker about
1/2 way up to the parking lot ? Hmmmm, I guess the sound system wasn't all
loaded up yet, we started carrying it up the path, after a few breathers, I
saw Jim Cyr up ahead, he was stoked that we were lugging the cabinet up and
he mustered up enough energy to continue on up himself, lugging the
amplifier. Once we loaded up all the equiptment, they invited us back to
Jim's house and out to breakfast, it was a great relaxing morning and some
great food. Jim just couldn't stop, as soon as we got to his place he set
up the turntables and continued to spin some tunes for us. I would give you
a rundown of the music, but I was sworn to a vow of silence, so to those of
us that were there, it will be our little secret. AHHHHHHH,  so now I'm
home, still glowing, and going to bed !

The biggest hug of all,

Vince (one happy camper)

I know they always say if you don't have anything nice to say then don't say
anything at all....but...uh...well I feel I need to say something and
promised my disappointed friends I would.  We show up at 11:15 like the
recording tells us and a small crowd is gathering on the dock.  People are
still exiting the boat from a previous voyage.  So we stand there while the
promoters are getting things set up.  Then we stand there some more...and
more...and more...and more.  Then somewhere around 1:00 or 1:30 a.m. a truck
screeches in, the back door flys open and out pops a generator....late!  (My
girlfriend has this theory about raves really being all about generators,
which is proven correct once again)  It's been cold waiting out there for
two hours.  So within a half an hour of the generator arriving we get on the
boat and get a plate of rice which was about the high point of the evening
for me.  The food was free so that was cool.  Remember, this shindig cost
$20 and it left over an hour late.  So then I go upstairs to deck 2 where
the dancing is taking place and Tracy is spinning.  As the boat is getting
underway everything starts vibrating including the needle...right accross
the record.  It sounded really wierd, but Tracy handled it well.  The music
was pretty good all night, but never took me anywhere.  This same feeling
was mirrored by the rest of my group of friends.  It just never got us
going.  The dance space was really compact making it difficult to get from
one end to the other.  Way too many tables.  I'm not sure if they are bolted
down or not, but they should have been removed if possible.  

Now the ambient space was just sad.  "You are planning to have ambient music
in your aqua ambience space arent you?"  This made it difficult for my
girlfriend to do her report with disco and lounge music happening.  Then the
boat operator people come and tear down all the visuals and turn all the
lights on and require it to stay that way.  All the x-ing people didn't seem
to mind all that much, but the whole feeling was just lost IMO.  There was a
small amount of ambient sporatically thrown in.  I have another plate of
rice...yeeeaaayyy :)  Then I go up and watch the dj for a while...I watch
him mix 4 or 5 songs and when I look up we are parked at the dock again.
Check the time and it's only 4:00 a.m.  The music was cut off by 4:30.  They
actuall pulled the plug in the ambient room and the song just slowed to a
stop. reir reir reeiirrr reirrrrr rrirrrrrrrrrrrrrr...  I did run into Lee
Fogel who said he had a good time so I know atleast some people liked it.
The guy on the conga drums was fucking awesome as well.  It was nice to
cruise around the bay for a while.  Not at all worth $20.  Maybe if it went
all night, but not for only three hours.  I really do wish I had more nice
things to say.....but..........good rice.

     In June of 1993 I went to (and spun hardcore at) a small completely 
     amazing renegade in Washington DC.  Brian Behlendorf was there, and we 
     had a very long conversation about love, raving, and community.  
     
     A few days later I wrote and posted an essay based on that discussion, 
     in which PLUR was articulated as a unified concept.  You can still 
     find the essay on Hyperreal's web site, in the spirit section.
     
     Anyway, in light of this tiff over my word choice when describing my 
     overwealmingly pleasant and positive experience with DJing at Your 
     Sisters' House two years ago, I'd like people to think for a second 
     about how they use PLUR.
     
     I've seen it used as a slingshot to propel criticism at others, and 
     that doesn't seem right to me.  Peace, Love, Unity, and Respect are 
     not something you toss at people when they annoy you, it's how you 
     deal with people who say or do annoying things.  It's not something 
     that you say is dead or missing from a scene or a party, it's 
     something you generate for yourself.
     
     Sometimes I feel sorry that I ever wrote or said anything about PLUR, 
     in light of how people use it to measure each other or hurt each other 
     by accusing them of lacking it.

This wasn't one of the better boat parties I've been on.  I'm sure if
Alan feels like it he can tell us the gory details of why things went
wrong.  Basically, it appeared that there was some serious miscommunication
with the boat operators.

I thought the party was fine while we were actually cruising.  Smaller
boats are much more fun though.  This one was too big and steady.  It's
the rocking on the waves with everyone falling on each other that make
boat parties such a blast.  

Still, a good time is often what you make of it.  I spent most of
my time socializing and banging my DAT machine against a table in a
vain attempt to get it unjammed.  I do wish that Garth would
get some new records or at least play some *different* old ones.  
I'm really getting tired of hearing "Rockit".
It's nice to hear an old classic thrown into the mix once in a while
but he's been spinning that one since July.

Anyway, the Sunset boat party might be better with a smaller boat
and hopefully a more cooperative crew.

ps. Hey Josh, that was a great set at Sunset!

Yes I was one of the djays and I spun a disco song or two
but yes I must agree with you- all and all the party had lots of problems and 
some problems were the promoters, some were the boat company, and some 
were that idiot playing disco and lounge in the ambient room.
I too thought it was a "skimpy dimer".
But what about those damn ravers!!!?
When are they going to put a stop to them??

Pieman and I went to see John Waters speak Saturday night and he started 
talking about raves and Ecstacy and how he couldn't imagine a worse thing 
than to love everybody. And then he spoke of his desire never to get stuck in a 
K-hole.

I'm glad that all the moon stuff went ok... after a beer or two and 9 hours of 
TV, I couldn't get motivated....  NOT!

Waters has a good point here...I experienced a community working out what 
it means to love, and for a while they went through this really saccharine 
smushy state.  In trying to "love" they lost the ability to get along, in 
that any time there was the slightest disagreement many people started 
acting like snubbed or disciplined children.  The community also lost a 
sort of critical faculty:  in trying to "love" everyone and everything, the 
ability to point out what was wrong or at least displeasing was lost.  It 
got to the point that unless you agreed with this tyranny of happiness, you 
couldn't be part of the community.

Things have changed since then, as things do.

A long time ago one of the Pet Shop Boys wrote an article about why anger 
can be a good thing, and why he hangs on to his anger.  I wish I had it 
around to share.  In a world where "love" is "good" and "anger" is "bad," I 
found Neil Tennant's (I think that's the guy) essay powerful in a positive 
way.

I'm not sure where this post is going, so I'll stop here.  I think I want 
to say something about how no matter what anyone says or does or believes 
there will always be differing opinions in any community, and how love 
doesn't have to mean giving up your critical faculties and that 
some E-ing people can forget that, but it's not coming out very well right 
now.

For those of you who missed it, and there were compelling
reasons to be wishy-washy (ie SoundFactory Location), you 
missed a pretty awesome 4-hour set by Carl Cox.  I was 
afraid that he was going to play down to the SoundFactory
crowd, and not be as intense and hard as I know he can be --
but I was wrong (for the most part).  Hard and high-energy 
throughout, the set was as active (w/out being disjointed) as 
any I can remember (in case you don't know, he _works_ three 
turntables).  You owe it to yourself not to miss Carl Cox the next 
time he comes to town.  Thanks to the Spundae people for giving us 
a taste of the outside flavor.  My only suggestion would be to
have the party somewhere other than the SoundFactory, so that the
foreign talent could get a taste of the SF vibe at it's best, and
least drunk, gold-studded, and limo-driven =). (I do, however, like 
good 21 and up's).  At several points during the set I was thinking 
about how, with a better crowd, this party would have truly gone 
through-the-roof, instead of peaking in the rafters.

GOA!!! i have just returned to the states after living 13 years in india, 
and goa was my first introduction to raving.  needless to say, i was 
completely engrossed from the first moment and can't stop since that 
point as well. the ravers there are pretty much all European (and a few 
american) tourists, quite grungy, hippy and friendly. the music is hard 
to describe... i can only say endless, mindless, hard-core, tribal, 
pounding, groovin' trance-acid. and the energy at the parties is 
incomparable, especially at sunrise when you look around and everything 
is as visually exciting as acoutically thrilling. if you are going to be 
there for new years you have struck gold, because it is the biggest 
badest craziest party, and quite the site for someone who had never been 
raving before. if drugs are your thang, then hash is availabe all over 
india for the equivilant of $1 per gram, but more common US drugs like 
acid or e are more expensive than here. definitely though, in the goa 
environment, drugs are all around but quite secondary to the music and 
the vibe... if and when you go i'd love to hear how you like it, i might 
be heading there myself at christmas. happy trippin'!!

Hmm. Admittedly I only stayed for the first couple hours of his set, but I
was thoroughly unimpressed. He kept switching from vocal house to techno
and back every three songs or so and never landed in a solid groove,
relying on loads of breaks and weird fader volume tricks that didn't do it
for me. The low point had to be when he played "Higher State of
Conciousness." I got the impression he didn't know what to play to the
Sound Factory crowd. He wasn't bad, but I would've expected someone of his
stature to be better than average.

I also thought it disappointing that they stuck Tony in an upstairs room
the size of my bedroom with two monitors for sound.

	I also think that it is hard to READ someones words on the screen with
the exact tone or inflection that that person intended.  It's always hard when
someones opinions differ with your own, and when they appear in B/W on our
screens, it's easy to fly off the handle and imagine that person being pissy
or mean.  I guess sometimes =) and =/ and =( helps, but when it comes down
to it, it's DAMN hard to communicate over a monitor...I'm more of a people

I spent all of December '94 in Goa, and I have to say, I was totally 
disappointed.  I found most of the European folk to be very cliquish, and 
the drug vibe was just a little TOO heavy for me.  It was to the point 
where you couldn't have a coherent conversation with anybody, and if you 
did, it was probably about drugs.  The music is played only from DATs, 
and trust me, the dj's do not plan their segues in advance.  Eight 
minutes of each track and then BoOmCrRUnCHKAcRuNCHboOmcrrrunChBoomBoomBoom.
OUCH!  It was hard to listen to, let alone dance.  The same dj 
would play for 12 hours straight, all from about a dozen DATs, and the 
music was very ravey sounding high energy acid with lots of insulting 
"throw your hands in the air and scream" breaks.  Also, the cops have 
been demanding much larger payoffs for parties (several thousand 
dollars), so they happen much less frequently (only for X-mas and New 
Year's while I was there).

Even so, I had a really good time hanging out and watching all the freaks 
of Europe congregate on a tropical beach in India to get fucked up and 
dance.  I certainly won't forget it, and I wouldn't advise against going, 
but I would say that if you're going to go to India, spent some time 
OUTSIDE of Goa.  India has some of the most intriguing, inspiring, and 
spiritual places in the world, and Goa isn't one of them...

It used to be that really clubby clubs were purported to have a 
hairometer at the door to only allow entrance to people with
appropriately big hair.

But why check your weapons at the door when ya can point em at the
ground, fire, and "make 'em dance" just like they used to in the
cartoons and westerns!

Perhaps in the future, we can have ravey clubs with PLURometers,
assuring adequate PLURalism among attendees. Then, on the inside, we'll
be assured that all overheard conversations will sound like these:

	"Hey baaaaaby, come check out how biiiig and fluffy my PLUR is!"

	"Woaaah -- check out the PLUR on that chick!" "Huhuh" "That's Cool"

	"I got more PLUR than yo momma's pimp got duckets"

-- Niels.

PS: interesting note on PLURalism... Defs #2 and #4a #4b sound like
a better definition of PLUR than the acronym itself...

plu-ral-ism n. 1. The condition of being plural. 2. A condition of society 
  in which numerous distinct ethnic, religious, or cultural groups coexist 
  within one nation. 3. The holding by one person of more than one position 
  or office, esp. two or more ecclesiastical benefices, at the same time. 4
  Philos. a. The doctrine that reality is composed of many ultimate 
  substances. b. The belief that no single explanatory system or view of 
  reality can account for all the phenomena of life.

(1) In case anybody was wondering about that "UFO" trailing sparks all
over the sky above the last Sunset -- I was listening to the radio news
on the way home from sunset and heard that it was a soviet built MIG-25
figher being flown "acrobatically" with fireworks spewing out the back
-- it was part of some kind of air show in Alameda. I for one was in complete
awe, and given that I've never seen a plane shooting sparks out the back
while doing a power-dive, I was thinking it was a UFO myself...

i guess living in india meant that somehow i could find those tourists 
who weren't drug obsessed and "cliquish", and like all people, every 
tourist is different. the music in '94 was not as powerful as in '93 or 
'92 (i'm sorry to hear that you didn't like it), but it has its own 
attractions if you let it infiltrate your system. the cops in india 
should be taken as what they are, not law enforcers but bribe-obsessed 
and ego-centered people (with a few exceptions), and i find it amazing 
that those who throw parties in goa manage to bribe the cops with the 
little money that they do.  the smaller parties around anjuna and baja 
are worth a try too, the vibe there is a lot mellower and people tend to 
be more sociable then at the major parties of christmas and new years. in 
the end though i totally agree that one should not spend their entire 
time in goa in visting india. for all the time i lived there i didn't get 
to visit all the places i wanted to, and still think about returning to 
do as much as i can. for me, india is the most spiritual and true place 
in the world, and i love it that as a tourist you discovered its 
spirituality in a non-artificial sense. (other tourists would consider 
goa spirtual, i think its more of a fun, lax, party  zone) anyway, i'm 
glad you liked it there....

What's with this PLUR paranoia, anyway?  Where are all these
high priests banishing heretics from our church for not
strictly adhering to the holy PLUR doctrine?
Does anyone really think that there's some kind of
PLUR fervor taking over the scene and trying to brainwash
everyone near it?

The only place in the rave scene where I see significant PLUR
activity is on the dance floor, where a minority of the party
people hang out.  The scene has matured, most people go to
parties to be with their clique, have some fun, check out the
crowd, see and be seen.  We have promoters with stuff to prove,
plenty of politics, in crowds and out crowds, attention seekers
and egos galore.  So where's all of this much feared PLUR stuff,
that dreaded "weapon" that threatens us all?

Usually, it's on the dance floor, when everyone is dancing and
in sync with the music - that's the only time I really feel
peace and love and unity and respect all at once.  In other
places, like on this list, pieces of it do show up quite often,
but I really wouldn't worry about it *too* much.  It's really just
the dance floor you have to watch out for, especially by the beach 
or on the grass; that's where the horror of PLUR lies waiting...

Lee :)

Hey all!

Gregg, Mona, Kip and I went to the Full Moon Celebration held on Saturday 
Night with Gateway, J&K Sound and others.  It was hella fun.

We set up a little sand circle altar, complete with  objets de 
force aquired just that day by Gregg and myself, at the Laney College 
flear market.  And Mona contributed her prized star candle. 

It was very satisfying, as many poeple came over to look 
and admire.  My my my, it's nice to be appreciated!

Ethan, by the way, played an absolutely amazingly good set.  I'm not sure 
who it was who went after him as I was dog tired and fell asleep.  I must 
be getting old as for the life of me I just can't stay awake 
sometimes...*sigh*

Kudos to the organizers who had it all down...including a map point along 
with folks to organize parking.  Thankyou!

Also the system was AMAZING.  J&K sound, via Rob (?), donated it!  Top of 
the line equipment with people there who really know how to make the most 
of it.  I was so impressed.

And in the end, we cleaned the beach and made it look more beautiful than 
it already did, as was pointed out to the very friendly park ranger who 
appeared in the morning to collect trash from the bins and basically 
check up on the space.  She was cool.

She also let us in on a little park ranger in-joke.  So, when you have a 
big thousand soul smashup...THAT's a rave.  When you treat the beach 
kindly and there aren't a huge mad ton of people, then that's a "ra."  

See you up at the Tribal Future thang!

love and kisses,

Ann

I love anger.
Anger is good.
Anger is power (sometimes).

I'm all for anger, but you should at least try to be constructive with it.

Raging can be fun :)

hi.

being a writer, or at least thinking of myself as such (oftentimes for no
justifiable reason whatsoever), it's hard to keep myself from writing about
the interesting issues that boil (or effervesce) up on sfraves. so i won't
try.

everything i have to say i want to say first - which, of course, is a logical
impossibility. 

i'm rambling. 

to start: mission vortex was beautiful. i wish every one of you (who wanted
to) could have been there. each of us who worked to make it go off put a lot
of love and sweat into the event, and it showed. from the shrine i created
(from which not a single thing was stolen) to the massage rooms to the
swinging hammock room to the dreampaint room to the soundhealing room to the
main dance hall - beautiful. 

what made the evening especially wonderful was the... what?... the energy of
the people there. it had the magic of what the seasoned old-school ravers
nostalgically look back to when the rave scene was still in its youth. and
what would this be? well i'm not sure, because i'm a new-school raver. PLUR?
yes. passion, joy, curiosity? yes. magic? oh yes, a good bit of magic.

where are we going as a community? are we even going anywhere? no community
can move without movement of the individuals. where are we headed? where are
you headed? where am i headed? 

i'm always wondering, wondering. mission vortex was a departure from the
normative status of rave-culture. no techno - but we danced all night. (well,
almost.) people were giving massages and painting and drumming and meditating
and dancing and just sitting on their haunches, looking into each other's
eyes - no departure from what i think of as a rave experience to be. and yet,
it was very different from the norm.

how do the rave world and the spirit world relate? we're finding out, with
events like the Vortex. 

my hope is that people continue to dare to throw events that depart from the
conventional experience. maybe they won't work. in that case, they're
unlikely to be repeated. but if, on an off chance, they not only work, but
they zing those involved, and if that zing spreads to other events, then
haven't we just grown as a community? 

the truth as i see it is that we grow as a community every time one of us
grows as an individual and shares that new wisdom (or pain) with his or her
neighbor. the macrocosm exists within the microcosm and vice-versa. that's
the only way the whole system that is this cosmos holds together, as i see
it.   

but you know me (no you don't) - communty and consciousness are my fetishes.
and a good thing about these two fetishes is that each feeds the other. 

and then, the next day - sunset! i'll be sad to watch the sun set on sunset,
even if it's only for the winter. [strange thought: winter already? straight
from summer to winter in california. i'm exposing my new england roots, i
know.]

an ode to sunset: thou, smileravey beyond compare, will be sorely missed. 

and the moon! she hung like a gigantic stage prop over the berkeley hills as
i biked home. no, it was as though the moon i'd seen previous was merely a
prop, and now i was finally seeing the real moon, in all her naked living
splendor. 

i don't need a shrink because i dance. okay, sure, i admit it, i've been seen
dancing in masks. this sunset, i was batman. [and yes, i am full-grown. if
you have trouble reconciling those two facts, maybe i can help you - later.]
and so, following this logic, sunset is part of my therapy. big thanks to
pacific for throwing it and to all of you for making it the peaceful joyous
celbration it it. sure, some people are on Style Patrol. but as my favorite
poet, rumi says "dog's saliva doesn't contaminate the Ocean."
 
all forms of sweetness are welcome here. and if you can't give me honey, i'll
even take a pink envelope of saccharine. my point? unclear.

love thyselves. there is much to love. to have an open heart is to live -
and, from time to time, to hurt. god i'm rambling now. but it's fun all the
same. 

[for all of you who made it through this message, a final addendum. our
berkeley co-op is no longer looking for two female housemates - but we are
still looking for one. so if you know anyone who's looking for a warm house
in north berlekey, pass this message along. and if she happens to have 750
amazing techno cd's - shazam! (but not requisite.) requisite _is_ 25+,
however. we're trying to keep an age as well as a gender balance.]

be well, beautiful people.

Yes, I stayed for two hours of Carl Cox's set, and, was quite 
disappointed. From listening to a hardtrance oriented compilation of his, 
I expected faster and more melodic, but found him instead shifting back 
and forth, seemingly trying reach for something, but not quite getting there.
And I definitively think that this is less a reflection of his DJing 
ability, and much more indicative of the vibe put out by that crowd in 
that space. As a matter of fact, I so disliked the Sound Factory, that 
even if GOD (!), herself, were to spin a set there, I may very well stay 
home instead.

Narnia has been rescheduled for October 21st... My partner and I were 
going to build our Geodesic Dome at Narnia on its originally scheduled 
date. Unfortunately for us the new dates conflicts with our long planned 
film festival, the Low Res Film + Video Festival.

I've gone to every Narnia (there have been 3 so far), while each one has 
been different than the last, I've always enjoyed myself - really the 
best large party I've been to.

If you make it down have a blast, be sure to stay for the sunrise.

You can find all the info you need on their SF info # (415) 437-4065...

By chance you don't go down... (BSP) Please come by our event - we will 
be screening some really great short films including a world premiere 
from Nick Philip (an animated video for a Sun Electric track of sorts)...

You can find all the info you need on our fest at www.lowres.com/lowres/

thanks, Jonathan

Okay yall, here is what happened: 
 
I work for a company thats at 562 Mission St. in The City. It's the
Building to the _left_ of Golden Gate colledge if youre facing the campus.
About two Fridays ago. I was up on the roof having a smoke at around
Midnight. (Were all working real late hours to meet the Xmas crunch) I was
looking down across the street. There were about 15-20 people looking to be
in there teens-early 20s. Just cold chillin across the street. They hung
outside for a bout 5min then all of a sudden they all walked into the
building they were hanging out in front of! After that there was a steady
stream of cars, trucks, ect. dropping off people to go in. Well, before I
went home that night I walked over to take a peak inside. I couldn't see
anything (looked all dark to me) but I could hear some thumping tunes from
somewhere in side.  
 
Anyone know what this party is (was)? Is it a regular thing?   The add. I
think is about 561 Mission St.

  i'm thinking of going to goa this winter as well and was wondering 
  how one would go about preparing for such an experience. are
  there any books or websites you'd recommend? how does one go
  about finding the famed parties? how do other southern locales(kerala,
  tamil nadu, etc.) compare?  considering that i've never
  left this country, i'm expecting to be completely annihilated

Here is a present to all of you.  A very entertaining poem by the American
Children's Poet Shel Silverstein.  Hope that all of you find this as amusing
as I just did.

Title:     The Worlds Greatest Smoke Off 
 
In the laid back California town of sunny San Raphael
Lived a girl named Pearly Sweetcake,
You probably knew her well
She was stoned 15 of her 18 years
And her story was widely told,
That she could smoke 'em faster
Than any dude could roll
 
Well her legend finally reached New York
That grove street walk up flat
Where dwelt the Calistoge Kid,
a beatnik from the past
He'd been rolling dope since time began
And he took a cultured toke and said
"Jim, I can rollem faster than any chick can smoke"
 
So a note gets sent to San Raphael
For the Championship of the World
The Kid demands a smoke off
"Well bring him on" sayz Pearl
"I'll grind his fingers off his hands,
 he'll roll until he drops"
Sayz Calistoge "I'll smoke that chick 'til she blows up and pops"
 
So they rent out Yankee Stadium 
And the word is quickly spread
Come one come all, who walk or crawl
Tickets just two lids a hit
And from every town in Hamlet
Over land and sea they speed
The Worlds greatest dopers
With the Worlds greatest weed
 
Hashishes from Morocco
Hemp smokers from Peru
And the Shashnicks from Bagoon, who smoke the deadly Pugaroo
And those who call it 'Light of Life'
And those that call it 'Boo'
 
See the dealers and their ladies
Wearing turquoise,lace, and leather
See the narcos and the closet smokers
Puffing all together
>From the teenies who smoke legal
To the ones who've done some time
To the old man who smoked reefer, back before it was a crime
 
And the 'Grand Old House That Ruth Built'
Is filled with the smokes and cries
Of 50,000 screamin' heads, all stoned out of their minds
And they play the National Anthem
And the crowd lets out a roar
As the spotlight hits the Kid and Pearl
Ready for their smokin' warrrr...
 
At a table piled up high with grass, high as a mountain peak
Just tops and buds of the rarest flowers
Not one stem, branch or seed
I mean a Maui, a Wowie, a Panama Red, Alcopoco Gold
Keef from East Afghanistan, and that rare Alaska cold
And there are sticks from Thailand, Games from the Islands
And Bangkok's bloomin' best, 
And some of that wet imported shit, that capsized off Keywest
There's Wahaukan tops, and Kenya bang, and Riveria fluors
And that rare Manhatten Silver that grows down in the New York sewers
And there's bubbling ice cold lemonaide, and sweet grapes by the bunches
And there's Hershey bars, and Oreos in case anybody gets the muchies
 
And the Calistoge Kid he smiles
And Pearly she just grins
And the drums roll low, And the crowd yells 'go go go'
And the Worlds first Smoke Off begins...
 
Well the Kid he flicks his fingers once, ZAP that first joints rolled
Pearl takes one toke with her famous lungs, and WHOOSH that roach is cold
Then the Kid he rolls his superbomb that would paralyze a moose
And Pearl takes one mighty hit,<inhale sound> that bombs diffused
And then He rolls three in just ten seconds
And she smokes 'em up in nine
And everybody sits back and sayz "This just might take some time."
 
See the blur of flying fingers,
See the red coal burning bright
As the night turns into morning, and the morning fades to night
And the Autumn turns to Summer
And a whole damned year is gone
And the two still sit, on that roach filled stage
Smokin' and rollin' on...
 
With tremblin hands, he rolls his J's
With fingers blue and stiff
She coughs <coughing> and stares
With bloodshot gaze and puffs through blistered lips
And as she reaches out her hands for another stick of gold
The Kid he gasps "Damnit bitch, theres nothin' left to roll"
"Nothing left to roll!" screams Pearl, "Is this some twisted joke.
 I didn't come here to fuck around, Man I come here to smoke."
 
And she reaches 'cross the table, and grabs his boney sleeves
And crumbles his body between her hands, like dry and brittle leaves
Flickin' out his teeth and bones, like useless stems and seeds
And then she rolls him in a Zigzag, and lights him like a roach
And the fastest man, with the fastest hands, goes up in a puff of smoke
 
In the laid back California town of sunny San Raphael
Lives a girl named Pearly Sweetcake,
You probably know her well
She been stoned 21 of her 24 years
And her story is still widely told,
How she still can smoke 'em faster
Than any dude could roll
 
Way off in New York City
On a street that has no name,
There's the hands of the Calistoge Kid
In the Viper Hall of Fame
And underneath his fingers,
There's a little golden scroll
That sayz:
 
      "Beware of being the roller, when there's nothing left to roll."

probably the best book to read would be the lonely planet, its written by 
true travelers who really know the knittygritty of india, other books can 
tell you prices, hotels, restuarants, but they don't cater to the poorer 
type of tourist, who are the ones that end up in the excellent (but 
grungy) hotels and go to all the parties.  from what i know, the parties 
in the summer are up in the mountains (Manali, Nagar, etc) because its 
not freezing then, slowly (i don't know exactly how) the people that 
throw them, and all the people that follow, move southwards (skipping the 
capital) to goa for december. small parties happen the whole month, but 
the biggest ones are on christmas and new years. then they hang around in 
goa for maybe a month more and then start moving again (with people 
following again) to places like kerela. to find out exactly when and 
where things are happening the best way would be to stay in Pahargangh in 
delhi (quite the shithole, but inexpensive and entertaining once you've 
met people), and to ask people there who have just come back from 
following the party scene (don't worry there are plenty of those people) 
where they were and where they think the parties are heading (it would be 
best to ask more that one person, because there will be more than one 
story). like i told dave scruton, if you tell me when you're going and i 
happen to be there at the same time i'd be more than willing to help, i'm 
much more comfortable and knowledgeable in that setting than i seem to be 
in the US (even more so here on the east coast).
one party i heard about is worth describing. the party-throwers had made 
their way to the more southern tip of india and had found the ideal place 
to have a fat party.  to reach it, you had to go in a wooden boat along a 
river that was surrounded on both sides by extremely tall, steep cliffs. 
after awhile on the boat, you came upon a sandy beach sticking right out 
of the bottom of one cliff. at the base of the cliff on the beach was a 
cave where part of the speaker system and the turntables were set up, and 
other speakers were out on the beach area. from what i heard there was 
mass attendance and the party lasted for four days.... god i wish i could 
have been there.

	Why yes they are throwing a party this weekend. It is under the 
name United Systems as they are throwing it with James Acid from the mid 
west. It will be free, and the music will be fast and hard :) The number 
on the flyer is (415) 522-2398...

i got all inspired listening to a windup on a dj osheen tape and wrote this:

cheekbones  chins  mouths
suspend
open
in spider webs
of expectation
 
drowsy  deliberate  air
shared
in
lungs drenched
with energy
 
eyes  wide  glued
to
racing
minds,
still floating
in near hesitation

dense  conscious  blood
pounds
tight hearts
 
hands  arms  shoulders
waists  legs  feet
stir
tremble
or
freeze
 
slowly
  then faster
     and faster still
        breath

Hello SFRavers -
 This is a reminder about the "SFRaves Peninsula Picnic" that's happening
next week Saturday , Oct. 21st.

 It will be at Edgewood County Park and nature preserve , near HW 280 at
the border of San Carlos and Redwood City. I will post directions to this 
park next week - it's within 5 minutes of the Edgewood Road exit west
of HW 280. 

 For those of you who enjoy hiking, there are two hiking trails almost 2 
miles in length, one hiking trail of 1.4 miles, and other that's 3/4 mile long.
I haven't tried these trails , but they are supposed to wind through grassland, 
oak woodland, and chaparral . Also a ridge with a great views of Skyline 
Ridge, Huddart Park, the San Anfreas Valley, the Crystal Springs Lake, and 
the Bay.

 As I mentioned before , the regulations say "Loud radios and the playing of
amplified musical instruments are not permitted". So , I am encouraging
folks to bring drums and other non-amplified instruments! I'm not a practiced
musician , but I will bring some conga bells that I will try to discretely 
torture while other folks are making music!

 The park opens at 8AM - I'll be there at that time to reserve a nice picnic
area for us that's in a little valley , but within an easy walk of the 
restrooms and a telephone. I see us being there until 3PM - so show up any 
time before then!

 See you folks next week ...

 Larry Ching / larryc@netcom.com

Subject: What 'is' a raver?
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

The non-techno people I befriend and come to get acquainted with tend to give
me the same reaction when they find that I listen and dance to trance,
breakbeat et. al.  And that reaction is disbelief. 
 Mind you, this isn't all I listen to, I have a myriad of various radio
stations programmed on my car deck, and a fine collection of cassetes ranging
from Beatles to Reggae, Hip Hop to Psychelldeic Furs, Funky disco tunes to
japanese rock.  However, when I toss in some hard trance, first Im asked:
"You listen to this?",
"Um, yeah."
Followed by, "Do you go to like, those raves and stuff?"
"Um, yeah..."
The conversation tends to die off there for a bit.  But this statement ALWAYS
ends the conversation.
"Oh, it's just that you don't look like the kind of person who listens to it
(techno)."

What I want to know is:

WHAT THE HELL IS A "RAVER" SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE???

I guess I broke some kinda soical mold.  Since Im hispanic I guess I'm
supposed to be into, like the Isley Brothers or motown or something.....  I
honestly didn'y realise that I have to get a "Techno Seal of Approval".  I
don't have any Alien clothes, I gave away all my funny hats, what else is
there???

I do love the scene and those in it, and would help out in any way that I
can... To me that is a raver....

well enuff jabber for now,

Adam

I don't know whether this is on the calendar or not... a while back a
DJ Garth handed me a flyer for "Roots" telling me it was going to be
like old times back in the bassment (yay).

Roots
Wednesdays in the Basement @1015 Folsom
Garth, Jeno, and Guests (10/11 -- Rob Doten, 10/18 -- Big Lee)
"For those Who Like To Groove"
10PM-4AM

I also have a flyer that says
"THE BLACK DIAMOND presents FELIX THE DOGGE + guests
in the lounge @ Roots, 1015 Folsom, Wednesdays 10-4, starting Oct 11.

So what's the difference between BLACK DIAMOND and ROOTS?

Yeah, especially that episode where two characters (can't remember which 
ones) go to a "rave" and partake in illegal substances (one willingly, one 
is dosed). Bad trips and eternal regret ensue --- let that be a lesson to 
you, youth of America!

Most hilarious.

no one in particular. obvioulsy there is a raver style, but i think 
ravers are people who like to party and dig the "vibe", the feeling 
of harmony and togetherness. no matter how you dress or what you look 
like you have the capacity to enjoy music. people have no right to 
question that.

I get the same reaction, but most the time from Ravers.  Mainly because I 
dress up in club clothes & usually don't wear the stereotypical raver 
clothes.  I enjoy dressing up & fixing myself up; & I love the whole rave 
scene & have met some of the best people through it!!!  Most the time I 
feel like I'm dancing all night with family!!

Remember...don't judge a book by its cover!!

That would be Brandon, and one of his many girlfriends that decided to 
dose him, who is no longer 
on the show, (the girl that went psycho and set the parade float on fire.)

 go to a "rave" 

Complete with music by Sisters of Mercy and the like..teee hheee.

and partake in illegal substances (one willingly, one 
> is dosed).

On Euphoria, sold by the crazy drug dealer wearing the shirt that says 
"4", almost as comical as the clowns who sport the "x" apparel.


 Bad trips and eternal regret ensue --- let that be a lesson to 
> you, youth of America!

Amen, I have learned a whole lot about raves, women and life from 90210!

Don't forget the afterhours party that Steve Sanders, the promoter held, 
until the location caught on fire and burned down, narrowly taking the 
precious lives of Kelly and another girl, who were trapped in a bathroom. 
Which is remarkably similar to a afterhours in New York, which DJ DB from 
NASA was involved in in 1989 or so (?) in which a club/warehouse did 
catch on fire, and numerous people did die.  The rave scence/life 
parallels 902010.  How about some of those after hours at the Peach Pit 
After Dark? !  Nat can make an excellent smart drink!

Dylan
(So I watch to much 90210)

Was Jesus a RAVER???

Ten to twenty billion years ago, the big bang brought the universe into 
existence. Eleven to twelve billion years later, life appeared on earth. In 
three to four billion year's time, life evolved from a single microscopic 
point to encompass and change the surface of the earth. From this point, it 
takes only about 500 years for life to devour earth's resources. To survive, 
we either find a better way to husband our resources or leave the planet. 
Ultimately, though, there is no escape, for if we manage to survive resource 
depletion, our descendents will have a mere five to seven billion years to 
escape destruction, when the sun expands and vaporizes earth.

I get the same reaction, but most the time from Ravers.  Mainly because I 
dress up in club clothes & usually don't wear the stereotypical raver 
clothes.  I enjoy dressing up & fixing myself up; & I love the whole rave 
scene & have met some of the best people through it!!!  Most the time I 
feel like I'm dancing all night with family!!

Remember...don't judge a book by its cover!!

YEAH! you didn't know this?
we all have to get Approvals to be a raver.
you can get them at rekkid stores and dillards.
it's just this tattoo they put wherver you want it.
make you an official techno-listening, mix-tape-buying,
	all-night-dancing RAVER.
there gonna start checking for these at the doors to events,
	so if you don't have one!  better get Approved!
you have to pass some silly test too.
includes a written exam with multiple choice and essay.
as well as an oral part -- to make sure you have the proper
	raver lingo.
and some places require you to perform a dance to be
	sure you dance like a raver...


AAGGGGHHH!!!!

i run into the same problems, Adam!

speaking of 90210 and raves, don't forget the immortal 90210 rave page
which is just a bunch of screen snaps I grabbed live off of my VCR
using the WWWeasel Web authoring/publishing environment ...

(please ignore all other pages on this server, this is a test server,
 you will find too many strange and disturbing things that you really

	Are there any events going on the weekend of November 10th 
(friday) or Nov. 11th (Saturday).  I live in LA but I'm going to be in 
town and I heard that SF has a really good rave scene so I wanted to hit 
an event.  What are prices up there like?  Also what is the party crew 
content like?  Down here we have a lot of thugs who want to be gang 
bangers but they go to raves.  Then they need to prove how tough they are 
and starting picking fights and threating to shoot people.  Definatly an 
uncool vibe.  I hope that's a rare occurance up there.

Non-ravers just can't concieve that we just *can't* be molded!
I am constantly surprised when I meet sfravers I haven't before.  None of 
you look like I imagined, and I *LIKE* that!  Each of you are so unique 
and it brings such richness to the rave community. God, it would be so 
awful if we all fit into some sort of raver mold.  If someone doesn't 
understand that, I find it useless to explain and I say, "you just have 
to experience it, that's all".  People are too used to making judgements 
by how someone looks.  I know in my heart who I am, and if someone else 
doesn't understand, I'm still comfortable in my identity (now I'm not 
insinuating that you aren't, Adam :):).

love to you all,
Amy

Why should they be?
A person responsibly taking E
does not pollute 
another person's air
with cancer causing carcinogens
"passive smoker".

FYI I do not care to take E
I used to smoke cigarettes but
no longer do
because of the above.

I do not wish to breathe in
your cigarette smoke 
as I walk an hour each way
to work every day.

I do not wish to go home
with a sinus infection
because I danced all night 
at a club where
so many people smoked.
(i am minimally for 
smoking ventalated sections
as I am a former smoker 
who understands the disease
and addiction).

The only way 
a person does not
or minimally does
effect anothers quality of air
and health
is to smoke in their own home
perhaps with a smokeless ashtray
or outdoors
in an area where I
don't have to walk 
behind you
forced to breathe in
the carcenogens
that cause cancer.

This in reply to many
posts about
E and Death

A person has the right
the universal right
to their own body
their own mind
and what they do with it.

Does a person
ultimately have the right
to judge what another person does
to their own body
or mind
that does not appreciably effect
that first person?
How can I say 
what is ultimately "right"
for another
and that one path 
will lead here,
another here?

(and all action effects others actually
but how can we be sure how)

I understand caring
and concern
but each should be
on an individual basis
a specific basis.

In this case
I have the right
to make my own decisions
on what I injest
what risks I will take
and the consequences they may have.

I know there are those
who do not consider
how they may effect others
with their actions
irresponsible.
Do we live for the condition?

Change the environment
and the people will 
change themselves.

Hello, all-

     If you don't recognize the name/address, it's because this is my first
post to sfraves.  I've been on for a few weeks and deeply enjoy the
discusions, reviews, even the arguments.  
    First I'll say that I went to my first rave in 93'; I think it was a
Wallyworld.  I heard Dan, Carlos, and Hardkiss for the first time and I
changed religions. --spiritually--
    I was a very shy person when I was young and parting changed my life.   I
wasn't hardcore till this year and now I can't get enough of the love,
family, and equallity this community provides.

I am currently working full time for the Lawerence Livermore National Lab-
doing a student research program.   I also take two night school classes
studing to be an environmental engineer(at DVC).  I am also an individual
distributer of health products.  AND I party every week.

busy busy busy -I wanna throw down a review while I can...
I went to Planet uh-because I wanted to hear my friend eric(Essence) spin
along with Ghost and Simon(Great set- best part of the evening), The space
was at the paint ball arena in S. Clara- it was like a maze w/ green walls
(real phunky/kool)
The worst part of the night was that some fools stole almost everyones stuff-
just walked out with handfulls of jackets, bags, and purses- w/o
confrontation. :-(
Vibe was bad but the friends I connected with and Sunset on Sunday just made
my weekend great...

enough said for now...

if love was food i would eat all day.
if music was grape jelly i would smear myself with it until there wasn't any
more left in the jar.
if smiles were sunshine, i would tan and be tanned - morning, day and night.

what is a raver? look into her heart, his heart. does she know how to boogie?
does he welcome his neighbors into his family?  do they know the value of
community? can the brother get down? 

i don't give a fuck what you're wearing, or not wearing, how long or short
your hair is, what kind of shades you've got, or if you've got the vogue
slouch. it'll be a black day when these characteristics come to typify the
raver, if they ever do. that's the day i check out. 

what do i think a raver is? an explorer. a celebrant. a person who's so
passionate about the music, the community, the vibe that he or she stays up
all night long, dancing, talking, or just slouching by the speakers,
entranced.  

personally, i rave as a part of my celebration of creation. but i don't
expect everyone to share my views. everyone brings their own two cents to our
community of ravers and when we put them all together... we're rich!      
 
ranting and raving,
shalom

        I agree. There is no such thing as an aphrodisiac, only things that
cause subconscious behaviours and processes bubble up to the surface into
behaviours, language, and conscious thoughts.  I do find, though, that one
of the things that e can teach you is the rediculousness of genital-based
sexuality.  Once you realize that sex is just the exchange of energy (in
the form of emotions like love, which is a barely perceptible and
articulable form of energy) you realize that your whole being is what is
having sex, you, your body, your mind not just a little part of your body.
        then again, i've never experienced the two things in combination
and, actually, the one i am trying to transcend and the other i'm trying to
understand (and failing because i don't seem to get enough ;) ha ha ha
        is that ambiguous enough for you =)

                peace,
                        brad

We went to Roots last night... we danced like crazed lunatics... and the 
music was PHAT.  I haven't heard music so sweet and funky since The 
Housing Project!  Aaahhh, I think I'm going to ponder my bellybutton 
awhile... that's all you can do when you're this worked!  

I'm hugging all of you RIGHT NOW!

I was cruzing through the SFR web yellow pages when I noticed that no one
informed you that Frequency 8 will be opening a record store / raver supplies
outlet (type-thingie) in the Haight.

I don't know the # of the store, however, it may be on thier pager #
415.541.5019

Just some info:

	(( Sorry if this message appears more than once, I'm having some 
	transmission problems.))

Hi-
	I am dave.  This is actually the first time I have posted to 
SFRaves.....though i would have preferred my first posting to be no more 
than an introduction and some reflective thoughts, I also have a great 
favor to ask...
	But first, a brief introduction...I have been partying on and off 
since 1992.   The Basics of Thanksgiving, '92 may have been the 
experience that convinced me of the primal joy and beauty of the rave.  
I'm sure any of you who were there can attest to the epic proportions of 
that particular party.  I went out every now and again in '93 and '94, 
and then early this year I started partying more consistently.  I have to 
say I've had an amazing summer, in large part thanks to the great times 
at sunset, come/unity, and wicked. I've relished the experience of 
feeling bonds with friends grow tighter, and developing new connections 
with people.  I hope to meet more of you all as the party continues. 
	My most conspicuous feature was formerly my mane of dark brown 
hair, which I often wore in a pony tail.  I have since deleted my locks... 
1/4 inch of fuzz remains.  I was also the guy with the camera at a 
few of the Richmond sunsets.
	Well, here is my predicament.  I haven't been out much in the 
last month, because i've been preparing for the subject GRE in biology, 
which is this Saturday.  Needless to say, I'm itching to lift my feet.  
Until today, I was really psyched to go to the sunset boat party (the 
day after my test!!) with three friends.    One of us went to Ameba today 
to get tickets, and she bought the last ONE ticket.   
	What can I say?  We're all really dissapointed, and not really 
sure what to do with that one ticket.   So, if anybody has an extra, so 
that at least two of us could party down on the boat on Sunday, please 
please contact me.  We will be verrrrrryyyy grateful.

	Please resond privately to:

	<chicken@uclink.berkeley.edu> or (510) 654-1755 

	Thank you thank you thank you............-dave.

i've been on sfraves for maybe a couple of weeks now... and i slowly 
found out that when people join they intoduce themselves. so i guess i'm 
abit late but here goes:
i'm short, show my half-indian blood through my face, and have dirty 
black dreads that are finally past my shoulders.
i was born in dc, but right after nursery school my father got posted in 
india and took the job because my mother is indian and they both felt 
that their kids should be exposed to indian culture. we ended up staying 
there for good, coming back to the us in the summer.  i really got into 
raving about 2 and a half years ago when i went to goa on a trip with 
friends and ended up at the new years rave and left mind-blown and 
addicted. last summer i was in santa cruz with my best friend, turtle, 
and stayed with her sister, ilana, and ilana's boyfriend (now husband) 
nic (dj jalapeno).  california reminds me a lot of home because it is 
laid back and people welcome you into their hearts without even thinking 
twice.  the parties were even more intense than goa, because i saw for 
the first time a real sense of community and bonding, and i finally took 
a good look at why the music seemed to be going on forever without 
stopping once.  last summer it also came to me in a sudden realization 
that there wasn't anything better than being a dj and providing the music 
for such energy-filled happy people.  this summer i went back to 
california and loved it even more than before: one memorable moment was 
watching the expressions on peoples faces during "I am ready" at ceremony 
at golden gate park.  unfortunately, my dad decided for me that i have to 
go to (an extremely preppie, frat-infested) college in new england, and 
now that i have tables of my own and am craving anybody that appreciates 
house music (the four djs at my school all spin east coast hardcore) i 
feel stranded. sfraves is the only connections (besides phone calls) that 
i have.  anyways, after 8 months and summer road trip i will finally be 
where i want to be... back in san francisco... and this time i won't be 
stopped. 
thanks for reading if you actually got through this excessive description 
of myself.

I'm posting this early so it won't be last minute and also because I will 
be really busy in the next couple of days.  Anyways......I am going to 
the sunset boat party on sunday with my SO and would like to offer rides 
to anyone from the Oakland/Berkeley area who is in need.  Or, I thought 
it might be nice to share a ride with someone just to be friendly and to 
have one less car on the road.  We have three spaces in our car and are 
willing to pick people up in our area (Berkland or Oakley!!) or at BART 
if you'd like.  We'll most likely return as soon as it's over as I have 
to work pretty damn early on Monday :[  

I'd love to meet some of you and share my car.  $1-$2 for gas would be 
greatly appreciated, but is not requisite :]  Send me email or your phone 
number and I will try to get back to you soon, but it may not be until 
Saturday afternoon because I'm taking the GRE and am stessed and 
nervous.  (wish me lots of luck)

XXXXX  OOOOOOO,

kirsten

        (( Sorry if this message appears more than once, I'm having some
        transmission problems.))
 
Hi-
        I am dave.  This is actually the first time I have posted to
SFRaves.....though i would have preferred my first posting to be no more
than an introduction and some reflective thoughts, I also have a great
favor to ask...
        But first, a brief introduction...I have been partying on and off
since 1992.   The Basics of Thanksgiving, '92 may have been the
experience that convinced me of the primal joy and beauty of the rave.
I'm sure any of you who were there can attest to the epic proportions of
that particular party.  I went out every now and again in '93 and '94,
and then early this year I started partying more consistently.  I have to
say I've had an amazing summer, in large part thanks to the great times 
at sunset, come/unity, and wicked. I've relished the experience of 
feeling bonds with friends grow tighter, and developing new connections 
with people.  I hope to meet more of you all as the party continues. 
        My most conspicuous feature was formerly my mane of dark brown 
hair, which I often wore in a pony tail.  I have since deleted my 
locks... 1/4 inch of fuzz remains.  I was also the guy with the camera at a 
few of the Richmond sunsets.
        Well, here is my predicament.  I haven't been out much in the 
last month, because i've been preparing for the subject GRE in biology, 
which is this Saturday.  Needless to say, I'm itching to lift my feet.  
Until today, I was really psyched to go to the sunset boat party (the 
day after my test!!) with three friends.    One of us went to Ameba today 
to get tickets, and she bought the last ONE ticket.   
        What can I say?  We're all really dissapointed, and not really 
sure what to do with that one ticket.   So, if anybody has an extra, so 
that at least two of us could party down on the boat on Sunday, please 
please contact me.  We will be verrrrrryyyy grateful.

        Please resond privately to:

        <chicken@uclink.berkeley.edu> or (510) 654-1755 

        Thank you thank you thank you............-dave.

Almost two years ago I posted asking when would be the best time to air 
our music video program Flux in San Francisco on Viacom Cable.

We are negotiating right now to move the program to a broadcast channel 
which would allow people throughout the Bay Area to see the program, 
rather than just those that live within city limits.

It will take sometime until we complete the move, so we need to come up 
with a new time slot on Viacom cable until that is complete.

Since many on the list have been very supportive of the program, I ask you:

Would rather see Flux aired in San Francisco Tuesdays at 10:30 or Sundays 
at Midnight?

I'm also please to announce that the show is also being aired weekly in 
New York City! We will soon present to you the finest in music videos AND 
interviews with DJs, artists and technology from both coasts.

Thanks again from your support,

I look forward to your choice: TUE 10:30PM or SUN 12MID

Thanks, 
Jonathan
Director, Flux TV

Exactly!!  A lot of times when I'm dancing, it's like I'm in deep 
meditation...My soul feels like it is totally set free!!!  I am truly at 
peace when I'm dancing away & totally into the music & there's no better 
feeling to come out of that meditation, open my eyes, & see smiling, 
dancing, happy people who seem to be experiencing joy!!

Check out the "travel" edition of COLOURS magazine.  It describes the 
appalling conditions local Goans live in while the 5-star hotel tourist 
industry booms.  According to this article, there are more tourists in 
Goa than locals.  Is this accurate, Archana?  

>From the people I known who have been there, the interesting days have trickled

Now an introduction :-)  My name's Kathleen and I subscribed to this list 
ages ago, but then technology decided to unsubscribe me, but I'm back on again.

I live in Brisbane Australia, and I'm an active member of our rave list 
here called "Ausrave".  This list covers, believe it or not, the entire 
Australian continent, so even though we don't come into physical contact 
with each other all that often, it's still an excellent way to 
communicate with others in the "rave" community.

I'm planning on visiting a few pals in the US in June/July next year, and 
I intend on collecting a few films for a film festival i shall 
organize here, taking some photos, and very definitely indulging in some 
tranced out, life affirming grooving in the great outdoors :-)

I've subscribed to this list and a few others around the US to hopefully 
make contact with some like minded psychedelic warriors :-)

smiles,
kath

welcome back THROCKA :)  whereya been ?  you are about a month
behind the rest of us :)

the us spends about 100 billion combating heart disease each year.
the majority of people who die each year die of heart disease.  
this is due to poor eating habits, fatty foods, lack of exercise.  
should i walk into macdonalds and start shouting at people ?

what if i choose not to drive an automobile to work ?  autos cause
65% or urban pollution.  should i then yell at people who drive
autos ?  take a deep breath on your walk to work, what do you 
smell ?

it is pc right now for people to thumb their noses at smokers, but
there are so many other contaminants to health and the environment
that surpass the effects of passive cigarrette smoke that your 
arguments are really just smack of political opportunism and jumping on 
the band wagon.

what i believe in is free choice.  restrictions on cigarette smoke 
should be up to the proprietors of restaurants and bars.  if i open
a bar and want to permit smoking, why shouldnt i ?  it's my place.
you can leave.  maybe i dont care if you leave.

It's been a rough day.  Like a really rough day.  I'm _extremely_ upset
right now.  Please send me lots of moral support to keep me from going
insane (unfortunately I don't have a phone right now, which is all part of
it, so just send me some mail to cheer me up).

Thanks everyone,
Jake

Subject: Sunset on Sunday / Strange encounters on a radio
To: SFRAVES@HYPERREAL.COM

	Hello,

	Well, I just logged in to hear the depressing news that tickets
	for Sundays cruise have managed to sell themself out. Guess this
	should have been expected, and I should have picked one up 
	before now.

	The phone message mentions a slightly higher dock-side fee, does
	anyone know if this is likely to still be the case come Sunday ? 
	Given the fact that its a boat, there must be a set limit on the
	number of bodies they can embark with. How many tickets were 
	sold ? How many people can they have on the tub ?

	If anyone happens to have an extra ticket or, sadly, cannot 	
	make the event - then I'd obviously be interested in taking it
	off there hands. Either mail or call (415-728-8632) if this
	happens to be the case.

	To add weight to the post, transform it into something a little 
	heavier than a shameless ticket beg (though still keep it fluffy 
	enough to float like a bubble)... 

	I've been experiencing some strange radio interferance over the 
	last month or so, and wonder if anyone has happened to be around
	similar goings on. Twice now, once in a mexican take-out, once 
	in the comfort of my home, the radio has suddenly blurted out the 
	theme from close encounters of the third kind. 

	You know, Da-Da-Dum-Dumm-Dummmm. 

	One time the notes broke over a normal radio program, the other 
	time the radio wasn't even tuned to anything (set on phono). Both 
	times its repeated itself twice, nothing else, just Spielberg's 
	immortal jingle.

	Personally, I tbink its pretty special that someone would take 
	the time to do this, Alien or otherwise. Although I'd hope that
	a real alien would choose something a little less hackneyed as
	an introduction.

	If it wasn't for the tweakers, where would we be ?

	Peace,
	Gary

        Jake,

                there is a reason for everything. all hardship has a
purpose and usually that purpose is your own spiritual growth.  i went
though a rough summer where i realized that the only person you can and
should rely on is your own self.  keep in touch with your self, keep
centred as those taoists would say.  remember that there is no such thing
as 'randomnicity' or chaos only more and mroe complex forms of order. look
at your situation and maybe, just maybe you'll be able to see the pattern
forming within it.

        hope this helped!

                gee, i could use some energy right now, i think my
allergies are coming back  :(

        peace to you,
                brad

   The scene seems alive and well - there's a lot of action again this
   weekend. Basics has sentimental value for us old-skoolers, and the
   Sunset boat party is sure to be a winner (but it seems to be sold out
   now). Every other party has someone I want to hear in the lineup too,
   though. There are a bunch of new weeklies popping up over the last
   month, especially on weekends, but Roots on Wednesday could be the
   sleeper. Send me updates on the weeklies, and thanks to those who have
   been sending updates.

I know what you mean... I've been there myself. (Quite frequently 
lately as a matter a fact)    When I Just remember if it wasn't for 
the rotten days you wouldn't appreciate the good ones.  I don't know 
if everything happens for a reason... but if you learn something from 
your experiences than you become a better person for it.

right now.  Please send me lots of moral support to keep me from 
going

So am I. Conveniently enough I have a car and room for 3 maybe 4
others. Having people to fill those spots would convince me even more.
If I go I'll be leaving from Berkeley. I can be reached at 843-3364. I'll
also check my e-mail later this evening.

Even if I don't give you a ride keep an eye out for the guy in the Oakland
Raiders hat.

Personally, I give a whole-hearted resounding YES.  Cars kill everything!!
Although cars serve their purpose, we really are murdering mother earth 
with them.  It's such a sad thing that California has to be so 
auto-elitist.  If people would only remember that driving is a privilege, 
NOT a right...:]  (Take public transpo, ride a bike, walk, share rides..)

On another tangent, has anyone ever noticed how mean everyone on the 
highway is?  (yes, that means both YOU and ME!)  I think driving brings 
out the worst in everyone.  I think we all feel such power behind the 
wheel because we are connected to a large metal machine.  When we drive we 
act so rudely.  We certainly do things we would never do if we were walking 
in a crowd.  As for people who get mad in traffic jams, I have no sympathy 
because every single person who is in an automobile is responsible!!

Well, that's my polemic for the week. Sorry it's not rave-related, I 
couldn't resist this one.   :]

XXXX  OOOOO,

kirsten

It's just like that one disney cartoon for driver's ed with goofy getting
into the car as a nice businessman, and then once he's inside he's a raving
lunatic.  C'mon, you all _have_ to have seen this...

I second that opinion! Growing up in NYC and am living now in downtown SF.
I have spent most of my life surrounded by millions of densely packed
autos. I agree about the meanness, driving a car definitely seems to bring
out my own most aggressive side. I think being in those little isolated
bubbles makes us think we can spew our hostility more acceptably than in
most interpersonal circumstances.

The amount of pollution is also sickening. I live @ 2nd and Mission, in the
midst of a heavy traffic area. I have to go out on my terrace every day to
wipe a thick coating of soot off the furniture in order to sit down. I can
only imagine what I breathe in every day...

My mom developed lung cancer a couple of years ago, and although she smoke
for many years, the doctor's told her that her type of cancer is more
closely associated with pollution than cigarette smoking.

For the first time in my life I am working from home and am so glad not to
have to enter an auto everyday and contribute to the mess.

Peace,
ek

Perhaps because we have such a sucky public transport system.... I like
to say i take the train to work (on the one day a week i go to work to
attend meetings). But when push comes to shove (i'm always late) I get
in my car and drive because i can get from SF to Menlo Park in 35-45
minutes, whereas the train takes 50 minutes + 10 minutes for me to get
to the station. That's a lot of wasted time. It's because caltrain
sucks so badly, infrequent schedule, crawlingly slow speed; it's just
lame -- check out a european train (or even a train on the east coast)
if you want to see how a train *SHOULD* operate.

And then there's BART and Muni, which are ok if you're going to the
three places they actually go. And of course, neither BART, Caltrain or
Muni are co-located in order to make transfers easy. What a pile of
crap. THis isn't a public transportation system. It's a joke.

I don't think it's fair to "blame the populace" for continuing to
drive and pollute. Given the alternatives, what would you expect?

Between BART, MUNI, and CALTRAIN, we got a bunch of petty fiefdoms that
refuse to talk/cooperate with each other. A perfect example of the
grand results of free enterprise and competition at work -- resulting
in the usual wasteful, dysfunctional non-cooperating system. Lets
"nationalize" this, centralise control, and do it right, sucking the
money out of massive gas taxes. Fuck privatization and capitalism.

And I won't even go into how the Oil Companies applied
political/financial arm twisting in Los Angeles county to remove the LA
streetcar system (back in the 40's and 50's) so that we could  enjoy
the progress and prosperity of the automobile age. Cough cough.

PS: the other thing is that there are a lot of cars out there that have
old gas guzzling engines that pollute a lot. In fact the  California
emissions controls limits are adjusted so that people don't have to get
rid of their old cadillacs and cutlass supremes, or so that rich people
can continue to drive cars with 400HP engines...

I just got my car smog checked, it's a '86 mazda Rx7 w/ 95k miles on
it; fuel injected, 80 cc rotary engine (150HP), catalytic converter,
mechanically well-maintained, despite the dents in the body... Check
out how this car fares against the "maximums" allowed by the state:

2500 RPM:
	Hydrocarbons -- 1PPM; maximum 220PPM
	Carbon Monoxide -- 0.00%; maximum 1.20%
750 RPM (Idle):
	Hydrocarbons -- 6PPM; maximum 100PPM
	Carbon Monoxide -- 0.00%; maximum 1.00%

In other words, I have to drive *TWO* *HUNDRED* *AND* *TWENTY* *MILES*
to put out the same amount of pollutants as would a "top polluting" car
(e.g. an old amerikkkan gas guzzler) would do in *ONE* *MILE*.

right on.  from the top of Mount Tam, you look across the bay, and
see this hoary brown smudge in front of everything.  you breath this
stuff in everyday, with every breath you take, wherever you are.
it gets worse every year.  

it is far more deadly and hazardous to health than cigarette smoke !

people single out cigarette smokers because it is easy to do, and
perhaps they feel better about themselves because they do -> like they
are not contributing to the problem of pollution.  that way, changes
in their lifestyles are not required (keep on driving that 1 mile 
to work).  i think it's hypocritical.

But think about how much less pollution you'd be generating if you
rode a bicycle to work.  For someone who can dance the way you do
for hours at a time, that little jaunt to Menlo Park should be a 
piece of cake. :)

Is it still hypocritical if you don't smoke or drive? I don't want to walk
down the street coughing just so you can inject poison into your stressed
out stinky-breathed body.

O.K.
	I offer my sincere apology to anyone out there who I led to 
believe that the sunset boat party was sold out.  i think what happened 
was that my friend bought the last ticket in one of Ameba's batches of 
tickets, and the salesperson didn't know that there would be more on the way.

	:-)  This morning, my housemate cruised over to Ameba and picked up 
our set of tickets  :-)

	Sorry to those who suffered moments of sadness, and thank you to 
those that were helping find tix for us.....

	I hope everyone is as psyched about Sunday as I am...see you then!
	

						-dave.

It's great that you don't smoke or drive, but I think he's trying to say
that you might direct your wrath towards more responsible factors in air
pollution. Harping on smokers for pollution and cancer is so
besides-the-point. Anyone who lives near Moffett Field, Alameda or Hunter's
Point is living on a toxic waste dump. Blame them, not the smokers. I mean,
hey, smokers stink - but so do dirty hippies and CKone disciples. Face it
people, you're getting cancer from the ground and the water and the air, not
the guy next to you at the bus stop. 

eh?

Actually, that depends on what i had for lunch...

THis might even be a problem on a global scale. (no, the burrito wasn't
that big!). I've seen reports linking global warming to outgassing of
cows and manure in pastures.

If I had the time and the ride wasn't through some of the foulest parts
of the south bay (well, it's all pretty foul air-wise) I'd probably be
up for it. Then again, I get pretty sweaty after dancing for hours on
end, which might not fare well with the "suits". But I've also seen
other smelly, unkempt and ill-tempered programmers significantly
shorten meetings using only pheromones, so perhaps that's a good thing!

At least I am now only working in Menlo Park 1 day a week, the rest is
at home ... so even if I do 60 miles R/T for one such commute, I'm
still doing less than most! And I do actually try to take the train if
I can... (http://www.commerce.digital.com/palo-alto/CalTrain/form.html)

I guess if I was really eco-conscious I would live where I worked --
the only problem is that Menlo Park sucks really badly, even though it
is considered "nice". We like to call it "Mental Dark" ...

then, until the 9th of november, i'll be in philadelphia - weddings and
things. 
exciting as loitering around in a cummerbund can be, i'd like to have some
fun while i'm out east. i want to dance and be danced.
to rant. 
 t
   o 

   r
 a
   v
     e 
  to sweat by the speakers. 
maybe even to break out my batman mask and get super(hero)funky.
there's got to be lots of wonderful things happening. a halloween rave in dc,
or something, something. 
but i have no idea how to find out about these things. 
the east coast rave world is foreign land to me. stranger in a strange land.
you know... 
does anyone out there know any phone numbers i could call, or any folks i
could email to find out about the goings on in baltimore, dc, and
philadelphia? 
perhaps, just maybe one of you is a former east coast raver who still has his
or her book of tricks?
if so, please share them with me.

Hi All,

Tonite at SOUL I do my first rave!  I can't wait!!!!!!

I received many cool letters since my first post to you all last week--thanx
to y'all.

I'll be wearing black shorts, purple tie-dyed shirt, black converse
high-tops, glasses, brown hair, and a smile!!  I can't dance worth a
poo-poo, so that would be another way to ID me (but I am learning...!)

I'll be looking for laminates!  I'll be there alone, but I hope to meet some
new friends and just be free!!!!  Peace!!

Being *way* psyched, tristan hanson (poochie)

yeah, but that is the case all over india... you see photos of fancy 
5-star hotels all over the country, but in every single location of a 
hotel there are also slums and people in downright poverty. on the other 
hand, i have yet to meet a raver-tourist anywhere in india who stays at a 
five-star, they choose to live in hotels as squalid (sp? is that even a 
word?) as the village homes around them.

Dear All;

	I've been worst, but this has got to be a low one for me this 
weekend. If anyone out there would care to offer some charity to someone 
at their whits end, and take me out with them tonight I would be 
indebited to you, I have NO money what so ever, and am just looking for 
something resembling a good time. Lets see I have shelter, food, valium, 
a hacked phone line, a Internet account, a pager, two siamese cats that 
love the heck out of me, a lot of so called friends who owe me money who 
are of course unavailable, and haven't returned any of my phone calls for 
at least a week or two, I wish I could say more but everyone seems kinda far 
away right now :(. Page me please, seeing a number flash on my pager 
would be a pleasent change, thanks, and very discouraged. But like I said 
it's been worst and I've made it through, but I assure you all surviving 
SUCKS, living is much better.

this is tom from intrepid (a new family hoping to throw POSITIVE 
parties)
we were working on a party for dec 2, and had everything all set
untill we discovered the location we reserved couldnt be used
legally (with permits). to avoid being raded, we are looking for
a new spot in the santa cruz or south bay area.
it will be a pre sale only event for about 600 people, tickets
costing $5.
if anyone can help with a finding a location (within the budget
range of a $5 party) please contact me here, or call me at
408.275.1546.
POSITIVE energy: tom

Dear Adam; 

	I hope you had a good; no utterly fantasic reason for stranding me
at the Boomerrange on the Haight. I was so stuck, I was starting to look
for a place to sleep on the STREET!!!!! Yes, I'm pissed, very pissed,
better yet livid. 

	One thing I didn't tell everyone was, that lastnight I was
diagnosed with something worst than AIDS, and when I said I was at my
whits end I really meant it. When I said worst the AIDS, at least it 
kills ya, this just leaves you a live & alone.
	
	If it wasn't for Matt L.<lanima00@dons.ac.usfca.edu> offering a
place to stay tonight, Saturday, I mite have gotten some of my Italian
relatives name Guidio to come and have a heart to heart talk with ya, a
ha. 

	So while I happened to be here I'm told by Matt, that both Sarvi, 
Jake, and Jen are in the same building, people I would very much like to 
see ya's, please :). Thanks, an am trying to stay positive once again in 
the face of extreme distress. I'm lucky I learned to cry, a couple of 
years ago.

        Brian you don't know me, but I wish you all the best. 
         I once lived in SF. Had my grotesquely expensive 360 degree view
apt.  Putted around town on my bad-ass black Hog, had tons of friends, an
unlimited chemical carnocopia, ( E was called MDA back then) threw
gargantuan tilt-boogie-bashes in the Mission.( '79 and  New Wave was..new.)
This was way before the current ravecraze   Life was grand.  etc. etc.
        But, push turned to shove, and shove turned to kick, when my
finances and health took a sudden nose dive.    I ended up sleeping under a
bridge.( 17th and Mariposa on ramp to 280),  because all the folks spouting
platitudes of peace, love, togetherness,( Blah Blah Blah) ditched, snubbed
and scampered out of my life faster then the feas off a fresh road kill.
        When my highs were all  gone and I stood ill, and alone in the dawn,
with little less than lint lining my pockets, it was the Universe's  way of
sifting the multitude of  pseudo brethen  from the few dear  folks truly
worthy of my affections.
        Reality check.  Compassion gushes thick cheap  with "E" 
        Just beacause you party with them don't asume they are
true...anything.    
        
 
My the Cosmos bless you and keep you..

Hi everyone! This is my first post to the list although I have been
listening in for several months. I've been raving for a little over a year
now and enjoying it immensely. Six people at the school I go to wanted to
go to a rave for the first time this weekend and wanted it to be a 'big
one' which happened to be LBT (I couldn't convince them to go to either
Basics or SPAZ). :( I thought it was a fairly average event with good sets
by DJ Trance and Darwin Chamber, and the DJ before them.  We left before
Carlos went on but he was out with the crowd as usual, happily blowing on
a whistle. The sound system was small and there was wet paint all over the
walls.  Someone posted earlier this week that Small World was in it for
the $ and at $20 I definately agree. My friends had fun anyway and are
interested in going to future events. I hope to meet more of you in the
near future. :)

dj trance is really my favorite dj, did he spin his own stuff? and if he 
didn't, what were the tunes he spun?

Dear sfravers,

	It feels good to be back on sfraves!  Some of you may remember me 
from several months ago, or I may have met some of you at parties.  
Probably many of us have met before without knowing it...

	Anyway, I wanted to make this post to share a little bit about 
myself and hopefully meet some new people, or maybe get reacquainted with 
old friends, or both.

	I'm taking a class at San Francisco State U. right now on the 
recommendation of another sfraver who took it, Susie Kameny (aka party-on 
Susie) who many of you may know.  It's called Cyberspace and the 
Humanities.  The professor, Arthur Chandler, is aware of this list, and 
mentions it from time to time, as do myself and the other sfraver in the 
class, Jon Zimmerman.  We've been talking a lot about virtual communities 
(i.e. communities in cyberspace like this one), which has fueled my 
desire to be more a part of this community (the rave scene, including its 
online component).

	Anyway, a little bit about me.  As well as being a raver, I'm a 
bisexual, vegetarian, libertarian, poet, aspiring writer and journalist.  
I live in the city, take 12 units at SF State, half in my journalism 
major, and the other half consisting of the excellent Cyberspace & The 
Humanities class and another interesting class called Leisure & 
Contemporary Society.  
	I work evenings calling people on the phone for a market research 
company, which has become sort of boring.  This is my way of saying I'm 
looking for a new job; if anyone has any leads, please feel free to give 
me a call at one of the numbers listed below.
	One of the things that attracted me to raves in the first place 
was people's friendliness.  It seemed so much easier to meet people and 
have positive interactions.  I am somewhat frustrated though by the 
transient nature so many of my meetings seem to have.  I would like to 
meet some longterm rave acquaintences to go to parties and hang out with.
	I seem to recall hearing about a "live chat" adjunct to the 
sfraves list, but I've never been on it.  Anyone have more info on this?
	Anyway, I look forward to good conversations & good parties!  
You'll probably be seeing some long, philosophical type postings and 
responses from me from time to time... feel free to ignore them if 
they're not your cup of tea.  |)

	Love & cybersnuggles,

					*** Starchild ***

My first baaaasics. I have good things to say if you're in the mood:

the whistles

the whistles

Where have I been all this time?  Has basics always been like this?

the thick, rich, foamy, fluid that slips under my shoes in certain areas of 
the hardwood floor.  What is it and where does it come from and why is it 
SO GOOD.

there goes the needle-hop again.  You gotta laugh.
it was worth every jump because with vibe this strong, train wreck or not, 
there was simply no turning back.

I started my evening waiting in line at the Small World thing.
Because it was close to home.
Listening to a guy say "we should've gone to basics"
as I waited behind the line jumpers and fake eyelashes
I ran back to my car
I ran to Basics
and I had fun
That guy was right.

I was going to send this only to shalom/batman/whoever, but then I 
recalled reading or hearing somewhere recently a complaint that on the 
net, praise is done privately, while flames are made public.  

Therefore I just want to say publicly:  Beautiful message!  Thanxxx...

	What can I say about such a phantastic experience?
	The most amazing moment occurred just as we passed under the 
Golden Gate, and all three decks of the boat filled with hoots, hollers, 
whoops, cheers, shrieks, smiles, etc... what a magical sound, and a 
majestic sight.
	(the music was good too)

Dear Adam;

	Never let it be said that despite the conditions surrounding my 
life, that I can't hear, or open my heart to another, or find forgiveness 
& compassion for someone elses humanity. Cause I know mine shows a lot,

Dear Kati & All;

	Friday I was diagnosed with a disease so awful, that it almost 
shattered me. It was by a doctor in an Emergency Room who had little if 
no previous knowledge/data on me, indictaing that it was some, if not a high 
probability of being incorrect. But I assure all of you, that one day of 
my childhood, still does not even come close to the pain I experienced 
from the words in humanly printed on the discharge I/O the nurse handed me, 
and that I'm still as strong as I've ever been.

	However, if correct, I WILL NOT let my mind, and the person I've
come to love(myself) crumble, from a person who helped design some of the 
most awesome firepower our country has ever seen, some of the most
environmentally sensative mass transist systems the world has seen, as
well as what I told is some of the most loving, & respectful touch
therapy(massage) my clients tell me I have provided them, into someone
pushing around a shopping cart on the streets of San Francisco. 

	I have traveled to long & hard in this life to allow this to
strike me down at what I believe are my best years. I'm actively pursuing
a much more acturate, and intensive evaluation of my being, through
multiple independent sources, to assure accuracy, thank god I'm still a
Test Engineer. Cause out of all the sciences, and in my opinion, medince is 
the least accurate, clueless, still in the dark ages, and they haven't 
met Brian Darkness head on yet.

	However I hold as part of my truth the words I think Def Lepoard 
put so rightously, that "IT'S BETTER TO BURN OUT THAN FADE AWAY." So not 
to violate the list's purpose please send me your e-mail addresses, if 
your interested in what going on with this ravers life, plus you will 
still see me at events, & hugs will be appreiated.

dedicated to the healing...
Martin sure has his act together.

I've been to every Basics minus one (I was at Burning Man) for
two years now.  I've had a lot of incredible experiences and
met people who have taken on all degrees of meaning at these
parties.  This last Saturday night, I must've run into every
single one of these people, and had to confront each of their
meanings.  People who I haven't seen for a very long time, and
people who I still see but who have gotten lost, and can no longer
see me.  (Those transitory relationships) This night of healing 
found me looking each one of these people in the eye and forgiving
myself for creating the tension that keeps my soul separate from
theirs.  I recovered friends lost, and closed many unfinished
chapters from parties throughout the last two years.  It was
a rebirth of my soul, and I'm glowing.  I know that my story
isn't finished yet, and this will all be yet another chapter
in a much larger story... and so I press on, faith in hand.
the key to healing others is in healing yourself.

But I wanted to take this moment to thank any of you who play your
part, pay tribute to those who spark the life into the dance,
acknowlege Martin for his work and spirit, and encourage anyone
who is listening to never give up your faith.  Meaning will
come to find itself.

I also want to respect all the serious fucking groovers,
Billy and the rest of them, riding the edge between divine
grace and chaos.  I'll be seeing you again soon.

-john.

          Ambient Cruise Promotor

Sorry about this message being posted on this list, I know that this is not
cool but our weekend was ruined by one asshole in particular.

Having reviewed the list last week we decided that we would spend our hard
earned cash on the Ambient Cruise, the last one was great so we had faith this
would be too. Having been told by the ticket outlet on Saturday afternoon that
all was OK we drove from San Jose to the city that night. Did we find a boat
waiting for us ????? NO WE FOUND A CHEESEY FUCKING SIGN, " Cruise is
cancelled, sorry"
Yes you are a sorry bastard. This is not something that you can cancel at the
last minute, so why were you still selling tickets you jerk. Not that we mind
the event being cancelled, these things happen, but you couldn't even show up
in person to excuss yourself.
How do you return the faith that you have lost ??????????????
the choice is yours.
If you are the promotor reading this, your'e an asshole, if you know the
promotor tell him he is an asshole
Yours an ex attendee

Dear All;

	Last week I decided to pay a visit to Union Square, where all da
rich people shop. So ya say whats so odd or interesting about that? I went
there dressed in black, full bondage attire, including my collar, and Goa
Trance blasting from my headphones. 

	Well, I paid a visit to shops like Channel, Peter Maxx's Gallery
(Great Art Work, Shitty Computer Graphics, he could take a few lessons
from any of us doing visiuals, and I told him that), Sheeve & Co, Neidman
Markus, Hermes of Paris France ...etc. 

	It was a truely interesting experience to say the least, they
didn't know quite what to do with me, or what to make of me, is he someone
famous of just a freak. The lesson learned was how quickly we judge a
novel by it's cover, needless to say the models & store employee's(those
with a sense of humor) loved me, and it always feels good to shake up the
upper crust, it not at least making them squirm. 

	Little did they know that I'm a virgin = >. Isn't life truely &
totally twisted. Any questions, or next time I go out, and if ya want to
come & follow or just walk along with me, I would love your company either
way, thanks.

Dear All;

	Happy Hardcore, Ambient, Jungle, Trance, and Techno in SF, you
gotta be kidding me, it's strictly forbidden according to the San
Francisco ELECTRONIC MUSIC LAW Section THX1138, Subsection DV8, and
clearly states that HOUSE & only HOUSE maybe spun or mixed in the County
of and/or City of San Francisco. Where have you guys been living New York
City or something. (Sarcasum Present)

	Violators being imprisoned and subjected to hours upon hours of 
Barry Manilow, and Neil Diamond records.

Went to spaz for the first time.  100% madness!  Crazy props to the
organizers of spaz.  The most underground party going on in San Francisco
right now.  The space was so cool!  They should of made it into a haunted
house :)

DJ Sifu asked me to pass this along:

Space Funk
October 20, 1995
10:00 pm until early morn

Hosts:
DJ Sifu, Phonic, Tony Fader, Chow Yung Fat, DJ Mike P.

Plus others

Info and directions:
(510) 433 9770

I have it on good word that this will be 18+ in the $10 to $15 range.
The lineup above is mostly into trip hop type stuff. There's supposed to be
a faster, "house" room as well, which I may be spinning (thus the possible BSP).

Vivian I never made it! ACK! 

I agree SF needs to use that little knob on the side of the 1200's and 
push it all the way down at 45rpm and go from repetitive but always good 
House of 140-150 bpm's to 170+!!

as I recall some guy who was on the berkley radio was claiming SF needs 
to go Hardcore!!

btw does anyone know who Dj FruitTart is?  he was good!! Dj FruitTart if 
yer out there keep up the Happy Hardcore !!

	There are hard parties out there... You just to look a little 
harder because they are in the DIY vein. Hard trance can be found at the 
Trust parties (140 - 170 bpm depending on who is spinning out of the 
collective or who has been invited). At SPAZ/TAZ you will find a true 
range of music - acid jazz to juggle to the theme from Alice in 
Wonderland to gabber. You might not get 25 billion intellibeams or 20 
megawatt lasers or an amp may blow and the music stops for 15 minutes 
while another is wired in, but you will get a free party most of the 
time, with music that sends people thru the roof...

Well, it mattered because i wanted to know about the two guys you never
heard of...

Why? So i can either go to or stay away from events with DJ's that I
either liked or disliked.

For some of us that have been around the loop a few times, statements
like these verge on the nonsensical. i've seen it all before too, but
each time around, it becomes more intricate, blended, and diverse. And
the places I've grown blase about make me see the new territory of the
future in new ways! 

Whether the beats are hard, soft, big, small, fluffy, chunky or
splooshy, it's all been done before -- go dig out some early-mid
eighties underground industrial (TG, Tackhead), or pop (e.g. Yello), or
rap, or even psychedelic jazz (e.g. miles davis "bitches brew"), or
haul out some old dub tunes (e.g. Lee Perry) and notice the "space"...
Notice the past reflected in the future, and the future in the past,
and the mirror in time is you!

Last weekend, I had a listen to some trax off of Marvin Gaye's "I want
you" LP (1976) and I could swear I was hearing arrangements and mixing
that sounded cool and hip RIGHT NOW. It was incredible, and I was
flabbergasted to find out that it was done nearly 20 years ago!!

So lets take all that old/new bullshit a given and move on. Besides, I
like SF's sound. Bigger is not better, and neither is faster, or newer.

I think I'm going to put on something really old (oh, maybe some big
band stuff from the 40's) just to protest this point of view. Just
because our world is accelerating forward doesn't mean one shouldn't
look back and appreciate the places people have gone before with new,
open eyes and expanded minds.

You guys should learn about what your are dogging, and get your facts 
straight before you start spewing off.  Those bpm's ranges you are 
talking about are way off!  The house you are talking about is most 
always 120-130 bpm's, and yes there is music out there that is 250 bpm's 
and higher speeding up past the speed of stupidity!

Events have occured in the past with the hardcore techno/gabber format 
such as Industrial Strength  of last year with Dj's Demigod, R.A.W. Ron D 
Core, Nikadeemas, and Deadly Buda.  Hell, I find out about this stuff 
goin on in San Fran, and i live 800 miles away, so I am sure there is 
more to be found, if there isn't throw your own!

The next rave you and your friends should plan to go to should be "Friends
and Family". Just trust me on this one. It's October 28th.

Get your tickets as soon as they are on sale...
F&F crew are not in this for the money. You're gonna get a slammin' party
for $5.  :-)

It seemed that a bunch of our friends were divided on where to go Saturday
night. A bunch wanted to go to "It's a Small World" thing, but I got the
impression that it was a big, vibeless cash-fest. I tried to get them to
come up to SF to go to Basics w/ us, but they were intent on checking out
the local Santa Clara county happenings. We didn't know it, but they went
there, got in line, and immediately got back in their car and headed north
to go to Basics! What a surprise!

Other than the fact that they used a map point that pointed to the front of
Big Heart City (not the entrance for this party! argh!) instead of the
proper entrance at the back of the club, we had an awesome time! We saw
loads and loads of friends there and danced until the records stopped. It
was my first Basics but I'll surely go to the next one. Charging for water
was a bit bogus, but once you bought a bottle, you could refill it for free
at least...

I know there were SF Ravers there, but I only saw one laminate! Where were
yours?! :-)

We'll be at the Mendocino Mountain Jam this weekend. Hope to camp with a
bunch of you there!

It's utterly disgusting to see most of the dj's totaly immersed in
"American consumerism" when it comes to buying records. Gotta have the new
"bombs" (pop music disguised with a dance beat that moves the majority)
can't play those old "bombs" cause their "out", ofcourse they get old they
have no real substance. You gotta keep spending money buying these records
that you will be sick of in a month, instead of getting music that will
last a lifetime.

I hate too. I can say that music is a very personal experience for 
me. When I spin, it's not the hottest, new trax out there. For me, 
it is the feeling, the primal energy that dictates what I will play. 
I have trax older than 2 years that I still play, just because of the 
energy that they give me. 
I strongly believe in letting myself go, letting the music control me 
instead of me controlling the music. If you let other factors dictate 
what you do, the final product is not from you. Let the music be your 
inspiration and everything you do will have your personal signature 
on it. And everyone will remember it that way, coming directly from 
you...

Peace to all    8)

Pardon my annoyance, but if you are so disdainful of the music in SF,
go to different parties, spin some yourself, DO SOMETHING.  I am so
tired of the whining, some deserved and much not, about the state of
the underground music scene in SF.  There is plenty of variety out
there if you're not lazy and only go to the most publicized events.

As for Pacific, Galen, Jon Williams, Solar, Spun, Darkhorse, Malcolm
"and two other guys I never heard of," at least give them some credit
for giving the scene much of what it's needed for the last year or two.
Sunset is a worthy successor to the original Golden Gate park parties
in '92 and Boogie Buffet in '93 as the glue that keeps the scene going.

All I can say is, if you don't like boring yukky house, go somewhere
where they don't play that.

Just got back from MAD at the Bahia...pounding trance in the house tonight
with just the slightest smattering of electro for the bleeding-edgers. I'd
say the best part was that transition to the faster stuff, no doubt. Didn't
notice very many 18-21ers there, which sucked considering the lack of minor
nights for DJ music in toto, let alone techno.

I'm taking a meditation class at SF State. The discussion revolves around
the different meditative practices of various Eastern religions.

It's mentioned that some yogis use anger as a source of "life energy",
whereas the energy that compromises anger is brought up through the chakras
and transmuted throughout the body. The energy is then as used as a sort of
"boost" to elevate ones conciousness,

Way cool.

Something to think about the next time I'm looking for parking.  ;)

later...

Nice boat, friendly crew - except for the captain's wife who clearly
didn't like the look of us.  15 minutes before boarding time she told
us that on the main deck dancing was only permitted on the 10 square foot 
wood dance floor which was almost completely covered by speakers and sound
equipment.  Under her watchful glare, we hurridly put back all the tables 
& chairs we had just moved, paying full respect to her very official yacht 
club uniform.  There was talk about moving the main sound system to the 
lower deck which had a larger wooden dance area but then the first mate/
head crewmember told us that the captain's bitchier half wouldn't be coming
with us.  Once we left the dock we were able to rearrange the furniture
once again.

The captain seemed to be a jolly guy, and mainly stayed on the bridge.
I didn't see what happened when the naked raver chick paid him a visit
but he apparently managed to keep us on course.  The head crewmember
kept up a professional, though somewhat bewildered demeanor;
her main job seemed plucking away the incense sticks that kept
sprouting up.  No problem at all with the open pot smoking on the
top deck.  The rest of the crew seemed to be having a blast, one of them
apparently got rather buzzed on something non-alchoholic.

I thought the music was pretty good.  Solar, queasy from the getgo had
a disastorous set, with his records skipping all over the place.  The
problem was more or less solved by moving the coffin to another table,
in time for Spun who gave us a typical trip house set, followed by Galen 
and then Jon Williams who finished things of with some acid/trance. 
The mixing was a bit rough at times, normal for a seafaring setting.
The lower deck was more musically interesting;  Jungle, dub,
trip hop, ambient... It all sounded fresh to me and the sound systems
were as good as any that I've heard on a boat.

The upper, open deck provided a real nice scenic chill area.  I 
especially enjoyed dancing on the bow with the balmy breeze in my face,
the feel of the waves under my feet, and the glittering views of the
city, bridges, ports, Alcatraz, Marin, etc.  The water was fairly calm, 
until we approached the ocean.  Geoff took in a mouthful of seawater and
analyzed its salt-content for me.

The density, with 400 on board was just right; plenty of room, plenty of
people dancing, a great vibe.  Nice lighing too; video projector, strobe,
blacklights, etc.  So this one gets a thumbs up for 6 hours of raver 
fun on the San Francisco Bay.

Hmm.  looks like you've got the 'just got here, but can't find it bug.'
Theres alot of shit going on here.  Enough for everyones taste.  (even
gabber- spaz sat night)  Check the calender for your soup d'jour.  But, you
sound like me when I first moved here.  Ask anyone on this list, I'm not a
great house fan at this time- but I sure have fun everytime I go out.
There is *variety* in SF I have learned. More so than probably any other
scene I've checked out.

        I have to admit that being angry is a real rush, the problem comes
in when you think about where this energy is focused.  Is it inside
yourself, or at a person, at a concept? I _used_ to direct it at 'the man'
or whatever you want to call it but found that it was kind of a waste
because the societal structure that i was trying to externalize and fight
against was still a part of me.  Tough call, huh?

It's soooo easy to fall into, though...you find a record store you like, 
you start going there every so often, and then you start going every week 
when they get the new deliveries, and you suck up new music like 
<name-your-favorite-binge-food-item-here>.

And then, after a while, you realize you have an entire crate full of 
records that are between 0 and 2 years of age that you've never even 
listened to except for 45 seconds in the shop.

(Of course, then you have "new source" for when you've run out of money 
and can't buy more records, or when you're sick of buying more stuff 
anyway.)

I don't see it as being part of a "fashion show" as Josh asserted ... it's 
more of this crazy addiction you get sucked into because it's so much fun! 
Back when I was buying $150 worth of records a week (which was a LONG LONG 
time ago) I wasn't thinking at all about fashion or impressing other 
people, I was like a kid in a chocolate factory stuffing every bit of cool 
sound into my brain as possible.

Thanks Lee,

You always give beautifully written, funny, insightful accounts of events
you attend (which I suppose is the raison d'etre of this list, in many
respects). After reading your posts I always come away with an intuitive
feeling of what it was really like to be there, even if I wasn't). Thanks a
bunch for being so observant and putting in the effort to share it with
rest of us.

Peace & love,
ek

I don't really know much about other traditions, but as a practitioner of
Tibetan Vajrayana (Tantric) Buddhism I can tell you that the alchemical
notion of transmuting "negative" emotions (such as anger, jealousy, greed,
attachment) into wisdom is at the root of tantric meditation practice. The
basic idea is that emotions are just different forms of energy arising out
of emptiness. The energy can manifest either as neurosis or wisdom,
depending on whether ego-clinging is involved. The tantric approach is not
to reject or suppress these emotions, but to actually experience them fully
as possible. The various meditational deities used in tantric visualization
practices represent the awakened wisdom manifestations of these different
energies. The tantric practitioner identifies himself or herself with these
deities as a means identifying with the wisdom aspect of these energies. In
a sense, the "negative" emotions become the fuel for the journey of
awakening.

For example, in this tradition the sharp, cutting quality of anger (when
freed from ego) is transmuted into intelligience; the sharp, clear, precise
quality of intellect (called Vajra wisdom).

just my 2 cents,

Peace,
ek

Why stop there!? For all of you fellow plurapaths out there:

Peace
Love
Unity
Respect
Amalgamation (or Anger as a positive force, eh?)
Paradox (or maybe Pan-Alien or Passion)
Abundance
Time
Honesty

A roomful of plurapathic, linguistic cowgirls for everyone!
What!? Making light of plur- why that's downright antiplurapathetic!

I agree there should be more diverse music in SF.    DO you think it might
be a lack of good Happy Hardcore records?    I don't know,  because I don't
go out and buy records,  so don't know the availability of Happy Hard music
in this area.  Dave Bayer,  want to comment on the availability of non-house
records?

I have to say that I'm really impressed with KZSU.  I really enjoy their 
programming especially the three hours of techno.  Even tho' I hold CAL 
sacred to my heart, I have to say that Stanfurd for the most part has a 
better (and this kills me :] ) radio station.  I love KALX, but it's not 
nearly as fluid as KZSU.  Plus, I can get KZSU on my radio at various 
places throughout the Bay, but I can't even get KALX at home and I only 
live two miles from the station!!  I have a feeling that KZSU has more 
money.  However, I'm glad that I live in the midst of a plethora of rad 
college radio stations.  Commercial radio stations are such bullsh*t.  I 
get so tired of their propaganda and their D.J.'s with fake English 
accents playing the same song over and over. (and how about their "I'm so 
FUCKING alternative" attitude?)  Anyone want to comment?  I'd love to 
hear responses!!

this sent to me, but meant for whole list:

Hello everybody one and all
 
Let me introduce myself:  I have been part of the SFRave list, off and on,
since last Nov. I live in Victoria, British Columbia and am VERY envious of
the size and quality of the rave scene that you have.  Neither Vancouver or
Toronto can match the scene you have, so give yourself a hand, hug,
lollipop, etc.  After a year of listening, I finally have an opportunity to
visit the SF city and the SFRave scene.  
 
I will be attending the Macromedia Multimedia Conference at the end fo the
month, so I will be in the city from Oct28-Nov1.  I am going to visit "good
vibrations", Burkeley, Chinatown.  Does anybody know of any cool music,
clothing stores or other places  that are worth visiting? 
 
Like Noel, I would like to find out if F&F would be better or the
Anniversary celebrations of FTT??  I have heard lots about F&F so I would be
inclined to go there but I need information as to where. The rave guide
doesn't have any info.  I would like to meet with any other people going,
maybe we can share a ride.
 
See ya later in that place between light and gravity's pull.

Ministry of Attorney General

__________________________
since my original post concerning F&F vs FTT i got several responses.
first, THANKS! for the replies!

to sum up what was sent to me for those who don't already know:
Funky Techno Tribe will be a HUGE event with an impressive line-up and
	all that big rave jazz -- a sure party.
Friends and Family will be a much more intimate party (only 600 tickets) with
	more of a "family" vibe.

i'm going to Friends and Family and i hope to meet some of you there!

	yeah, I couldn't agree with you more.  Commercial radio in this country 
is really empty, and it's a shame because the potential for radio to be 
powerful is all there.  Luckily we have a few good college radio 
stations, and of course NPR.  NPR certainly does a great job stimulating 
quality conversation about interesting issues with excellent people.  If 
some of the elements of NPR's approach to radio could be incorporated 
into a station that played modern music,  such that the quality of the 
music could be appreciated in an uninterrupted and cerebral way, life would 
be grand.   Certainly that is a vague description of what a quality radio 
station might be like, and the details could fill out in lots of ways.

	I too, hold CAL(although I don't call it CAL) dear to my heart, 
but KALX is not one of my presets. (Minor's sets used to be good, but that's 
in the past).   I actually can't seem to get KZSU in Berkeley, and I 
suspect I might not live too far from you.  you're lucky...

		Enjoying three hours of silence, -dave.

Not to bring anyone's head down, or anything, but there are at
least 2 items on the ballot for SF City elections worth noting:

First is a measure to extend the city curfew to include 17
year olds (it's currently for 16 & under).  The current law
is set to expire at the end of the year.  This measure will
also extend it indefinately and make the law difficult to overturn.
There's another measure that will beef up police oversight, and
we know that we can't have too much of that.  Sorry for not having
the measure letters handy.

I know that some ravers like to pretend that they aren't a part
of the processes that shape our society, but they are, even if
it's only to step aside to hand things over to the Frank Jordans
of the world.  Anyway, voting is pretty easy, especially if you
use an absentee ballot.  If you don't live in SF, consider
mentioning this stuff to your city-dwelling friends.

Speaking of NPR, they did a review on jungle music in Europe and how big 
it is there.  It was a VERY good review.  The guy was extremely 
knowledgeable and gave it a positive review/report.

Yeah, KZSU Rocks... I get to listen to it every time I'm working in
Mental Dark or Shallow Alto... Many years ago, I have been known to
guest DJ there, though mostly we just annoyed people that had the
misfortune to be up at 3-6AM (e.g. playing as many copies of Michael
Jackson's  "beat it" as we could simultaenously (including the tape
deck) -- his voice smears quite beautifully after you get about 5
simultaneous but slightly timelagged sources going at the same time...
Or playing selected prank phone call excerpts from John Trubee and the
Ugly Janitors of America's classic LP "The Communists are Coming to
Kill Us" (well before the Jerky Boys were a twinkle in their mother's
pearl necklace).

Oh, while yer at it, check out KFJC 89.7FM (Los Altos Hills). For
example, tHey have good reggae/dub w/ Spliff Skankin on Sunday 2-7PM
and good techno/industrial w/ Mr Goodwrench on Saturday 10-2AM. (Don't
quote me on the schedule -- for more info, check
http://www.cygnus.com/misc/kfjc or email:
kfjc-publicity@wiretap.spies.com). THe sounds and the DJ's vary widely
in relevance to the rave community -- however, if you like diversity
you will find some really interesting shows on there, ranging from
bluegrass/american-traditional, funk, dub, punk, speedmetal, 
techno/industrual, and even rock n' roll. 

Best thing about KFJC is that I can receive it in San Francisco! (I
live on the south bay side of the hills -- 2 blocks up and KPOO takes
over).

If I remember correctly, Mayor Frank "Cleaning the City Streets" Jordan is the 
only candidate that supports the bill, although Ben Hom supports having a 
different version of it.  
 
And a side note: Willie Brown's son is pretty involved with the SF Club scene, 
running the King Size label, financing the Grand clothing store, and involved 
with parties more on the hip-hop/acid-jazz tip.  Of course that doesn't 
necessarily mean that Slick Willie is down with all that, but he did do a 
fundraiser function at my landlords (Ex-owner of the DNA, Mission-Rock,etc) 
loft, suggesting a level of communication at least. 
 
Finally, if you really don't like any of the candidates, vote for ***GOBOY***, 
the Homeless Belligerent Preacher Robot that we (Theatre Concrete) are running 
for mayor.  Look for him crashing Frank Jordan's rallies. Write him in on your 
ballot. 
 
******* GO BOY FOR MAYOR.  THE 7 TON ROJO CAST-IRON FLESH SAYS: GIMME FIFTY

	Hey, thanks for the KZSU compliments... I happen to work 
there and will have a techno slot this coming spring term.
	Actually, KZSU has very little money.  Most of the cash we 
get comes from sponsors and donations (which are usually for sporting 
events) and consequently they get sucked up by sporty-type spending.
	A full quarter of our annual budget goes to paying for our AP wire,
which costs $10,000.  That leaves us with little left over for
fancy spending.  You should see the station, it's kinda dumpy.
	The reason you pick our signal up so much more easily 
around the Bay (especially in the East Bay) is not that we have a 
high powered transmitter--it's only 500 watts, compared with Live105's 
10,000 I think....  The clear reception occurs because the Bay is 
flat and hence does not obstruct the signal's zippy flight across the 
water.  KALX, conversely, is situated poorly and surrounded by 
hills and such.  Plus, I think the FCC made them aim their 
transmitter out to sea for certain logistical reasons... was it them?
So, more power to us.
	Keep on listenin!

			jon

Speaking as a representative of KALX, I can say that the reason most 
people (on this list anyway) are turned off by the station is their 
enforcement of "non-block" programming.  They want every dj to constantly 
change the style/genre/tempo of music during their show.  Unfortunately, this 
leads to a lot of the shows sounding like the same schizophrenic grab bag of 
music, which IMO turns people off.  

HOWEVER, there is at least one good show on KALX...       mine!  :)

Actually, I should rephrase that... There is at least one show on KALX 
which the people of sfraves might have some interest in.  There, that's 
a little less pretentious :)

The show airs at the same time as Minor Minor's previous show, Thursdays 
from 9:30pm-midnight.  My show leans more to the ambient/experimental 
side of things, but I try to throw in at least a couple sets of more 
bootie-shaking music.

As for the receptability, I've found that KALX comes in many parts of San 
Francisco, Marin, and as far south as Los Altos/Redwood City.  In the 
past, KSJS had the same frequency as us (90.7), so it interfered just 
about everywhere, but if you haven't tuned in for a few months, give it a 
try! 

See ya,
Seth

Hey now,
	My name is Colin and I'm a newcomer to the electronic version of
San Fran Raves, but I've been doing the real thing for about three years
now. At the present moment I'm marooned in Connecticut attending Wesleyan
University. I'll be done this May. 
	One of the benifits of coming to school out here is that I've had a 
chance to go to raves up and down this coast as well as the left one.   
San Francisco is the place to be. No other city or region I've been to has 
anything which resembles the kind of community feeling that San Francisco has.
Personally, it is the amazing group of people that makes raves (and the rest
of it) so truly special. I cherish the openness, acceptance, sophistication,
silliness, and awareness that this community fosters. It is something found
in very few other places.
	There has been some debate recently about the domination of house
in the SF scene. Even the best Jungle in world is awful in the company of
500 hostile kids from New York. Many events out here have an enourmous variety
of musical styles, but the love is not there to make the party go off. No
amount of drugs can overcome it. (Although people back east seem to be trying
to push the limits of how many drugs you can take) I believe that all the
house in SF tends to bond the community together. Of course, now that we
have such a great group of people together, we might try out some other music.
	
	My important message: VOTE!!! VOTE!!! VOTE!!!
	This November 17(?) Those of us in San Fran can elect a new mayor,
which would probably mean a new chief of police, vote down the curfew law,
elect Cesar to the board of supervisors, and generally help ourselves out.
If you don't go and vote, Jordan and the status quo will only make it harder
to dance. The same is true in all bay area cities. Richmond: The civic center
policy is still in debate, people who live there can use their voting power,
meager though it might be, to influence policy. Ditto for Vallejo, Daly City,
Berkeley, and elsewhere.
	The key to this is to make sure that everybody in the community is 
talking about this. Tell your friends who don't use the internet. 
Get the word out. Promoters should pick up voter registration cards for people
to fill out. Call the people running for office and see how they feel about
your right to dance. Let them know that there is a significant number of
people who care about this issue.

	OK, back down off my soapbox. I'll be back in the bay area Thursday
until Oct. 29th. I'd love to meet some of you in person. You may know who
I am. I am one of the people behind Tribal Funk. If you've been to one of
our parties you've probably seen me running around pulling out my hair. I
was the one talking like an idiot on the microphone at the end of our last
party in Santa Cruz.
	Also, anyone on the East whose out here missing SF, drop me a note.

Much Love to All Those Who Live to Dance
Colin

What exactly does BSP stand for? It seems to be used for posts that are
self-promoting so maybe its Baldy Self-Promoting or something?

BTW, IMHO we use too many abbreviations on the net sometimes.  :)

There is much harder, faster stuff than house being spun all over the bay
area. I can guarantee that there will be some good slamming beats played at
Fnf on the 28th. Check it out, it's an experience. I don't get up to SF
much for the regular parties (I live in Monterey), but at the events that I
have been to, the majority of tracks played were more on the trance side
than house. It seems to me that the more commercialized events and clubs
tend more towards a house beat. The smaller events where the DJs are there
for the music, not the money have always been a better bet in my book.

Mayor Jordan's curfew proposition is Prop L.

the Prop to increase civilian oversight of the police was put on the 
ballot by tom ammianl's office, and which was informed by and supported 
by numerous police watch dog groups in sf, is Prop G.  it would:

-  amend the city charter so that the occ director must be supported by the 
bd. of supes (right now only the mayor and police commission have a say)

- require the occ to report to the bd of supes 4x a year

- and require the city to pay awards and settlement women as a result of 
police misconduct out of the pd's budget, NOT the general city budget.

(and it would require them to make publice apologies for ever busting any 
raves, and to give out free shiny stickers...uh...mayb e in mydreams...)

Hello SFRavers -
 Here's more information about the "SFRaves Peninsula Picnic" that's happen-
ing this Saturday , Oct. 21st. 

About The Park -
 It will be at Edgewood County Park and nature preserve , near HW 280 at
the border of San Carlos and Redwood City. It has two parking lots , with
the larger lot near the road. There's a nice meadow next to the inner
parking lot, with the picnic areas and restrooms located above the meadow.

 For those of you who enjoy hiking, there are two hiking trails almost 2 
miles in length, one hiking trail of 1.4 miles, and other that's 3/4 mile long.
I haven't tried these trails , but they are supposed to wind through grassland, 
oak woodland, and chaparral . Also a ridge with a great views of Skyline 
Ridge, Huddart Park, the San Andreas Valley, the Crystal Springs Lake, and 
the Bay.

When and Where -
 The park opens at 8AM - I'll be there at that time to reserve picnic area 
#1 , which is a nice picnic area that's next to a little streambed surrounded 
by trees.  You get there by walking up the footpath along the left of the 
meadow, up above and behind the meadow, past picnic area #2. "Our" area
will be on the right of the path.

 I see us being there until 2:30PM-3:00PM - so show up any time before then!

Misc -
  As I mentioned before , the regulations say "Loud radios and the playing of
amplified musical instruments are not permitted". So , I am encouraging
folks to bring drums and other non-amplified instruments! I'm not a practiced
musician , but I will bring some conga bells that I will try to discretely 
torture while other folks are making music! 
  It's a picnic , so bring food & beverages. There's a little barbecue stove
next to the picnic tables , for those who want to scorch their food before
they eat it. I'll bring a bag of coals and fire implements.

How To Get There -
>From North Peninsula:
  On HW280 Southbound, drive south towards San Carlos and Redwood City. 
After the HW92 interchange, drive about 4 miles and take the Edgewood Road 
exit. Turn left onto Edgewood Road and drive under HW280 towards the bay.
The park entrance will be on the right after Crestview Drive.

>From South Peninsula and South Bay:
  On HW280 Northbound, drive north towards Redwood City and San Carlos.
After the HW84 (Woodside Road) interchange, past Farm Hill Blvd, take the 
Edgewood Road exit and turn right onto Edgewood Road. Drive downhil, the
park entrance is 500 ft. on the right, past Crestview Drive.

>From East Bay:
  Take the Hayward/San Mateo Bridge (HW92) to San Mateo. Continue to the
hills, and take the HW280 South (San Jose) exit. Follow the directions above 
for "From North Peninsula".

>From Coast:
  Take HW17 over mountains to HW280, Northbound. Follow directions above
for "From South Peninsula and South Bay", or take HW92 over mountains to
HW280 Southbound. Follow directions above for "From North Peninsula".

--------------------------------
 I know there's going to be a really nice event happening in Mendicino this
Saturday and Sunday called Tribal Future, so I guess a lot of you folks will
be at Mendicino . If not , come on over to Edgewood Park for awhile!

 Is any one of the Friends and Family crew coming to the picnic? If so , would
it be too early to bring some of the F&F Halloween/Samhain party tickets 
for sale at the picnic.

I'm taking a meditation class at SF State. The discussion revolves 
around
the different meditative practices of various Eastern religions.

It's mentioned that some yogis use anger as a source of "life energy",

whereas the energy that compromises anger is brought up through the 
chakras
and transmuted throughout the body. The energy is then as used as a 
sort of
"boost" to elevate ones conciousness,

Way cool.

Something to think about the next time I'm looking for parking.  ;)

later...

I am no expert, but I talked with Mark yesteday, just shootin the shit on
the phone.  In any case, YES, there will be a Stompy, and it should feature
Derrick Carter, along with some very special guests.  It should be one
kickin' ho-down!

But a brief warning:  Stompy is all about groovin'.  There are no beats
above 126 BPM (Thank G_D!).  So if you're down to dance, sweat,groove, and
move, Stompy's the place. :)

Out,
John

P.S.  I do not work with Stompy, and have no financial interest in the event.

And just as important is WHO becomes Mayor, and WHO becomes DA.

I am split on Jordan/Brown, both hold some postivie elemts that I like.  As
for DA, ahnds down, it's Terence Hallinan.

T. Hallinan would like to do the following:

-Decriminalize drugs in SF.  Most notably Marijuana. (CHECK!)
-Decriminalize prostitution in SF, create a red-light district. (CHECK!)
-Stop Matrix and prosectuion of the homeless on misdemeanor charges.
(reluctant CHECK), I like the concept of Matrix, and I like the result
(pushing the homeless out of SF into neighboring counties have made
everyone aware of the plight of the homeless.  It is now a Bay Area
problem, not just SF), but it is questionable constituionally IMHO.
-Reign in the cops. (CHECK!)

As for Jordan/Brown?  I dunno, Achtenberg is out IMHO.  I am suspicious of
her reluctance in adressing minorities issues, esp. AIDS in the minority
community. I also think she's too pro gay for my tastes, and SF is more
than just a gay mecca.  Other people live here too!

Brown I like, but let's face it, he's a backroom dealer.  Despite that, he
is the one who could get the supes to move on issues.  With Jordan, the
Mayor's office and the Supervisors are at a constant stalemate.

Jordan I like as well.  SF has become a bit safer under his watch.  But
he's too much of a micro manager, and as such is ineffective with the
biggger picture issues.  I also think that there has been too much emphasis
on police in SF, and not enough on job creation/retention in the city.

All are beholden to somebody.

For the most ultra liberal ticket, I choose Brown/Hallinan.( Some might say
Achtenberg/Hallinan)
For the a moderate ticket, Jordan/Hallinan.
Status quo Jordan/Smith <- Mr. Thumbs Up. (this is NOT an option IMHO!)

Ben Hom?  Forget it, all he talks about is business.  And there's more to
SF than that as well.

If you want to make a difference, are tired of laws that suck (a technical
term), want 18+ parties, your had better stop complaining and vote.  If you
have an agenda, organize, and get the vote out!  They can never ignore
numbers.  The Million Man March is proof of that concept.

Much peace,
John

Greetings!

As I am being literally *deluged* with mail asking me to save tickets for
people, I've struck upon the idea of mail order....

If you live:

  out of state
  south of san jose
  or north of san rafael

and you send me a check and a stamped, self-addressed envelope, arriving at
me no later than this Saturday the 21st (ie mail it today!) for at least 3
tickets, (at $5 each) I'll hapilly mail them to you on Monday the 23rd.

Make checks payable to

Ethan Miller
1425 Santa Fe Ave.
Berkeley, CA 94702

Locals, please don't abuse this, I have no time for it, it's merely a
courtesy to our far ranging friends.

Once gain tickets will also be avaible at my house in berkeley, middle of
next week for you east bay folks... details will be posted later.

take it easy
ethan

This IS a joke.  It is NOT true.  I got a message from this list about 6
months ago regarding the same thing, except the person was vacationing in
Mexico.  Don't forward it to anyone, well unless you really want to, but it
really isn't true.

Well, I'm voting for Achtenberg -- even though I'm not gay. I think
she's a lot more than just a gay candidate. And besides, having someone
like her in charge will piss off the Christian Right, and I'm all for
that.

Where do you get the suspicion that she's insensitive to minority
issues? Perhaps she doesn't want to harp on AIDS because she doesn't
want to be seen as just a "gay" candidate. Anybody in her community
couldn't possibly stay insensitive to the issues, which is not
something you could say about Brown or Jordan who live their lives
hiding in splendid and extravagant isolation, away from the death and
dying that is going on all around. And i'm not at all sure that Brown
is sensitive to anything or anyone unless they're driving a Mercedes
Benz or a Lincoln Continental.

hello all...i remember fondly the moment i posted the message "your mail"
and i recall stating that i was going to get many bad posts because of it,
but i had no idea...i'm happy to see you guys are so adamant in supporting
what you like and i'm now going to respond to a few of the comments made to
me and probably dig myself in a deeper hole..hehe.. here i go. [this is a
very long message but i responded to many peoples's criticisms..]

>VERY NEW music.
you are right...i said that all i heard was yukky house music and that's
right because that is BASICALLY what i heard..this does not mean that there
was nothing else played, but obviously the majority was house...perhaps not
yukky, but house nontheless..this, i don't think you can deny unless you
all have thought up some new terms for house which i'm not aware of...i
heard that malcolm played jungle on lower deck and was very happy he bigged
up the jungle vibes..i was, however, taking care of my friend's toe which
happened to be severly crushed by a falling speaker..therefore, i missed
the jungle tings..i Am upset about that one...the dub was good as well, but
in truth, i didn't think there was a great deal of variety to the music
there.

yes it was fun...i'm not denying that san francisco has a very nice vibe to
its parties, etcetera, because i've certainly been to some of my best up
here...but the music does bug sometimes...

>Dancehall and Jungle
>Riddim and Rewind

i know of this and i've talked to shoban before but i'm not old enough to
get in...so,sucks to be me.

>Pardon my annoyance, but if you are so disdainful of the music in SF,
>go to different parties, spin some yourself, DO SOMETHING.

i try to go to different parties (hard when you are a student with not
enough money and no car) and i DO something...i spin jungle and a bit of
happy hardcore and i am certainly working on playing out...i also go to
school full time and i'm working on getting a spot on college radio..AND
i'm dedicated to bringing up the jungle vibe everywheres..so you can shove
that..yeah i'm disdainful..but at the same time, i AM trying to change
things in my favor.

>>one shouldn't

>>open eyes and expanded minds.

i play old tracks as well and i wasn't commenting on the quality of old
versus new music, i was trying to point out that a great deal of the music
that i have heard here since i've been here sounds quite similar to the
music i heard when i went to Basics and Full Moon parties up here two years
ago..of course, if you are into that music, i'm sure you'll beg to differ
with me..But i concur that it is very similar.

> what exactly are you playing that is SO HIP!   Put
>a playlist where your mouth is, let see it.
i am playing jungle and it is arguable whether or not that is "hip" to you
but i think that it is definitely a very interesting and rather "new" form
of music, at least to the west coast (although in England, of course, it is
already surpassing itself by leaps and bounds). playlist...hard to say
because finding new jungle stuff up here is like pulling teeth...but my
style is..
H.M.P. "runin's"
hype "r.I.P. remixes"
aladdin "mash up yer know"
goldie "angel"
dj ss "limb by limb remix"
got some idea i hope? more on the hardstep vibe but a little intelligent
and ladies cru thrown in...

>where else is there more raves
>than San Fransico in
>the United States?  No where!
there's a lot of places with thriving rave scenes in the U.S...i may remind
that S.F. is not the be all, end all of rave culture...chicago, los
angeles, florida, new york, baltimore, minneapolis, philly...there are a
lot of good and interesting scenes everywhere, perhaps more well suited to
my musical tastes than here...and there are not a million raves every week
here..i don't consider this a mecca in terms of choice-either in dj's or
clubs.

okay...i guess portland is more shut off from the world than i
thought..there is a very thriving gabber scene in la as well as other
places around the country...and you may think its shit music but its still
out there and there are still a great deal of records, rotterdam label and
otherwise, out there for gabber dj's.. no there are no gabber records here
that i've scene, as well as there are relatively few jungle records and
probably about three happy hardcore...while it may not be popular here i
think that any city which prides itself on being a hotbed for NEW and
DIFFERENT music would at least provide resources to dj's looking to play
that...?

i still can't decide on friends and family or funky techno..how many people
do you think weill be at each and what's the line-ups? any ideas guys...

you see me you can come up to me and give me a hug or pelt me with

heard that malcolm played jungle on lower deck and was very happy he bigged
up the jungle vibes..i was, however, taking care of my friend's toe which
happened to be severly crushed by a falling speaker..therefore, i missed
the jungle tings..i Am upset about that one...the dub was good as well, but
in truth, i didn't think there was a great deal of variety to the music
there.

yes it was fun...i'm not denying that san francisco has a very nice vibe to
its parties, etcetera, because i've certainly been to some of my best up
here...but the music does bug sometimes...

i know of this and i've talked to shoban before but i'm not old enough to

i try to go to different parties (hard when you are a student with not
enough money and no car) and i DO something...i spin jungle and a bit of
happy hardcore and i am certainly working on playing out...i also go to
school full time and i'm working on getting a spot on college radio..AND
i'm dedicated to bringing up the jungle vibe everywheres..so you can shove
that..yeah i'm disdainful..but at the same time, i AM trying to change
things in my favor.

i play old tracks as well and i wasn't commenting on the quality of old
versus new music, i was trying to point out that a great deal of the music
that i have heard here since i've been here sounds quite similar to the
music i heard when i went to Basics and Full Moon parties up here two years
ago..of course, if you are into that music, i'm sure you'll beg to differ
with me..But i concur that it is very similar.

> what exactly are you playing that is SO HIP!   Put

i am playing jungle and it is arguable whether or not that is "hip" to you
but i think that it is definitely a very interesting and rather "new" form
of music, at least to the west coast (although in England, of course, it is
already surpassing itself by leaps and bounds). playlist...hard to say
because finding new jungle stuff up here is like pulling teeth...but my
style is..
H.M.P. "runin's"
hype "r.I.P. remixes"
aladdin "mash up yer know"
goldie "angel"
dj ss "limb by limb remix"
got some idea i hope? more on the hardstep vibe but a little intelligent
and ladies cru thrown in...

>where else is there more raves

there's a lot of places with thriving rave scenes in the U.S...i may remind
that S.F. is not the be all, end all of rave culture...chicago, los
angeles, florida, new york, baltimore, minneapolis, philly...there are a
lot of good and interesting scenes everywhere, perhaps more well suited to
my musical tastes than here...and there are not a million raves every week
here..i don't consider this a mecca in terms of choice-either in dj's or
clubs.

okay...i guess portland is more shut off from the world than i
thought..there is a very thriving gabber scene in la as well as other
places around the country...and you may think its shit music but its still
out there and there are still a great deal of records, rotterdam label and
otherwise, out there for gabber dj's.. no there are no gabber records here
that i've scene, as well as there are relatively few jungle records and
probably about three happy hardcore...while it may not be popular here i
think that any city which prides itself on being a hotbed for NEW and
DIFFERENT music would at least provide resources to dj's looking to play
that...?

Not true huh? That's too bad. You know it really sucks when stupid 
people misuse compassion. I mean it made me smile to read this at 
first. You know, what a friendly way to make amends. No one gets 
hurt, but the person feels that they have accomplished at least a 
little. 

Sorry for posting this. :(

I'll try to be less understanding and more realistic next time.

I guess we are adamant about house music (at least I can speak for 
me) because of the unmistakeable feeling it sends out. That 'vibe' 
that we all talk about sooo fondly that brings people sooo close 
together. I'm not saying that other music can't do that, it's just 
that it comes soo easily with house music. I mean the whole scene 
around here thrives on the bonding that can happen soo easily between 
people. And soo much of house music speaks that message.

Now just to clarify, do you group trance in the same realm as house? 
Because I have not been to a Basics, Gathering, Vision, Freedom, etc. YET 
where there has not been some of the HARDEST, MIND-BOGGLING TRANCE
I have ever heard.

So just know that at least speaking for me, there is nothing wrong 
with other kinds of music played at parties. It's just that some of 
us have such very strong emotions and deep-seated experiences when it 
comes to house that we take it very seriously, like part of our 
wonderful, love-filled lives. Just remember to stay strong in what 
you believe in and try to smile to at least 5 people you don't know 
every day!

luv ya!

Ah, but there is still some good that can come of this.  I've heard that
it's still a damn fine cookie recipe.

It's debatable whether election stuff belongs on the list, but I
do think Hallinan would make a positive contribution in a lot of
areas related to raves, and Randy is an old-time SFRaver who has
earned an off-topic post :)

	This isn't hard trance you have been listening to. Go to some of 
the record shops that have listening stations and play some of the stuff 
off the Eye Q label, Drop Bass label, or the Harthouse label (the three 
that come quickiest to mind). Drop Bass is probably the best for hard 
trance (some call it noise trance)....

	Gabber is actually thriving in just about every part of the world
except SF. It is one of the main forms of music in the DIY culture - it is
being made and played all over the place - some decent stuff is coming out
of the Mid-west now. As was said in the post this is requoted from, the
problem with it here is you just cannot find it. No record stores stock,
and most will not special order it for you. I have run up a massive phone
bill to British record stores that will do mail orders for me. Until you
dance with at least another 20 people to a gabber set you will not know
what it is about, you will not be pulled into the mass of primal energy
that only comes from having a bunch of nutters dancing to something going 
about 200 bpm. It's like me sitting back and saying that techno is shit 
repetitive music that is dead and only listened to by an infinitely small 
cross section of all the people alive anywhere!

> >where else is there more raves
> >than San Fransico in
> >the United States?  No where!
	Actually, from my friends who throw parties in Chicago, I would 
bet they have more parties (combo of underground clubs and 'raves') than 
we do here. We in SF don't really have an underground club scene. Nor do 
we have raves going on everyday of the week with more than house played 
(I don't really want to start this, but find me a trance party on 
Thursday night).

> >> I can guarantee that there will be some good slamming beats played at
> >>Fnf on the 28th

	Your idea of 'slamming beats' most likely varies from that of 
others. While FnF will have harder, more diverse music, and not the same 
exact sets that you have been hearing for the last 6 months, some of us 
think of slamming as a bit more intense than even those no name DJs who 
are spinning at FnF (but then, I am an intensity junkie ;) ). If you want 
to look at the line up, it can be found somewhere under
http://www.bass-station.com/FnF/

If I understand correctly, the Daylight Savings time change will occur at 
midnight on the 28th.  That means one more hour at Friends and Family to

Network "Urban legend" alert!

Although i'm probably as guilty of anyone of (re)posting bullshit,
let's keep this stuff minimized. Basically, apply a rule that should be
applied more often in life (well, at least in mine ...) -- "if it seems
too good to be true, it probably is". Alternately known as there ain't
no such thing as a free lunch (TANSTAAFL).

NP: a tape of Ronnie Libido's show on KFJC from last Satyrday, good
enuf that I'm now adding the following to my "to get" list (which I
never get much from :-( )

	Qabbala, "Dub Infusion" 
	Word of Song Records Label, Brooklyn NY. 
	"Dub of Justice"

	Plague, "Mind over Rhythm"
	Rumble Records Label, UK
	"Departure" 

	Chemical Brothers, Exit Planet Dust
	"Thee Little Birdies Down Beats"

	Cool Breeze,
	Remix of "Can't Deal with this" by Alex Reese (sp?) some jungle guy.
	Dorado Records Label.

	Stereolab, Refried Ectoplasms Switched On Volume 2.
	rereleases of old hard to find stuff...

	Mojave (ex Slowdive members)
	"Love Songs on the Radio"

PS: If anybody has suggestions of where to buy any of these, lemme know!

PPS: non-techno/rave warning on the last two but i like 'em anyways.

I like all the talk on this subject that has been generated, because I
wouldn't have given it half a moment's thought if someone hadn't brought it
up.  I think this is also true of a lot of the voting population in the rave
community.  So here's an idea:  if there are any promoters throwing parties
in the next few weeks that really care about the possibility of being shut
down (or at least severely hampered), they should somehow slip in what we've
been talking about into the parties.  Just some way to let people know these
issues that they probably wouldn't hear about otherwise.  There are a lot of
people who attend raves that would vote differently if they knew about these
issues, since many people are totally unaware of them.

     Did someone say Gabber?  Did someone say hard trance (pricking up 
     ears).
     
     If you're having trouble ordering hardcore/hard trance, try Sonic 
     Groove records in New York City and Planet X records in New Brunswick, 
     New Jersey.  You can get their numbers from information -- 212 for New 
     York City, 908 for New Jersey.  Both do mail order.  I shopped at both 
     stores when I lived back East, and got many a 150 bpm+ record there.
     
     Also, I've had good luck in Los Angeles, specifically at DMC on 
     Melrose.
     
     Some labels to check out:
        Trans' Pact
        EXperimental (you name the style, they'll have an example of it)
        Direct Drive
        Harthouse (be careful, spotty selection)
        Labworks (also spotty selection, but some real gems)
        Dance Opera (although some is cheezy)
        Drop Bass (good 'n' crunchy and noisy!)
        Chocci's Choons (fast-acting aceeeid)
        Overdrive (hardcore noise)
        Frankfurt Beat (was that the name?  I can't recall...sleeves
                are black with holographic silver ink)
     
     If anyone wants to "geek" on hard trance / hardcore, drop me a line!  
     I'd love to talk.  I've recently started spinning again after a 
     one-year haitus, and have taken everything out of my crates that is 
     slower than 140 bpm (I needed to do *something* to help me get 
     organized again).  Unfortunately, in my time off I got really out of 
     touch with the music, so I'd love to know what people are finding and 
     liking on that tip.
     
     Laura

sure..i really don't think that a bunch of people addicted to E's is SO
much better than a bunch of people addicted to other things..i know a
million people will disagree and i see their point but My point is...if the
only reason you are going to a rave is to do drugs, then you are there for
the wrong reason..
        actually, it really doesn't matter to me what kind of drugs people
are doing as long as i'm there enjoying my HARD and FAST music with my
friends, sober and loving it...fuck everyone else if they're only there for
the drugs..
        i may point out that most of the people who are into jungle,
particularly in the uk, are sober or only drink and/or smoke pot..they are
definitely NOT crack or tweak addicts...or anything of the sort...to make
the assertion that the kind of drugs you do is based on the kind of music
you listen to or vice versa seems rather silly to me...i know where you get
that from but i don't think that you can make that generalization
and it really doesn't matter what kind of drugs people are on at what
raves, just because more tweakers might like hardcore doesn't mean they
shouldn't play it, here or anywhere.
and..you admitted yourself that the house played here is often farily
boring..which is the basis of my whole problem...promoters don't want to
promote styles of music unless they're already big, but they can't get big
until someone promotes them...ah, the paradox...and im..outie.

Hardly.  Maybe it is played in the midwest and chicago but definetly not in 
England, or 
most of Europe for that matter, and just because it is played doesn't 
mean that the tracks are new.  Who is the biggest dj from the midwest? 
probably Dj ESP who hasn't made a track over 140 beats per minute in a 
long time.  I challenge you to name one within the last 6 months even 
though he has released at least half a dozen records in that time.  You 
people seem to be getting "Gabber" and "Fast music, or hard trance, 
techno, acid core etc confused with each other. I said Gabber is dying 
/dead, and when I said Gabber I 
mean stuff like Rotterdam records, Mokum records etc (distorted drum 
beat, 4 on the floor rythym, lots of "Fuck" samples and a few noises,160 
+ bpm's, no bassline etc...this is gabber by defintion....I have my 
own record store and I see the release lists for records every week from 
Watts music the North Americas largest distributor  of underground dance 
music, the 
volume of gabber records being released the last 6 months to a year is 
down to less than at most 3 a week.  You call this thriving?

It is one of the main forms of music in the DIY culture - it is

What?  Drop Bass Network is the only label I can think of putting out 
hard and fast stuff currently, most of which is hard acid, or hard 
techno, not gabber.


As was said in the post this is requoted from, the
> problem with it here is you just cannot find it. 

The reason for it as most of the labels have gone out of business or 
moved on to other styles.  See my next message for details.

I have, and I am going to say it is an interesting experience, but it 
looses it's flavor real quick.   I 
have yet to see anyone dance for the duration that other people can dance 
to music in the  under 145 bpm's category.


It's like me sitting back and saying that techno is shit 
> repetitive music that is dead and only listened to by an infinitely small 
> cross section of all the people alive anywhere!

I am not meaning to come off like that, I am just saying that Gabber is 
definetly not being made like it used to be.  Hell, Frankie Bones arguably 
the most popular dj in America, and the #1 advocate of it at one time was 
dismissing as dying back in December 92.  "Rotterdam Records has become 
so commercial since we broke it, I won't ever play these records again."  
Under One Sky magazine December 1992.  That was almost 3 years ago.

This is my final post on the subject of Gabber  :).  But although some of 
these labels are more in the hardcore techno category here is more proof 
that Gabber/you peoples definition of gabber is dying.

I don't mind harder techno, i just find most of it to be too lame and 
unoriginal, or simply hard for the sake of hard. But I would recommend for 
good harder techno (usually it aint faster than 145 bpm's 
for the most part, and usually no gabber) i would recommend these labels. 
Dance esctacy 2001 
PCP records
Praxis records
Cold Rush records
Synewave records
Planet Rythym records
Hybrid records
Nova Mute
Force Inc
80 Aum records-(they might be out of business though)
I will shut up know :)

Hi All,

Xris, Kathleen (no one you know) and I went to Fiber last Saturday.  I don't
know if many SF Ravers were there, certainly not ones I knew by sight.  I
wasn't expecting it to be very ravey, but I was curious to see some
"cyberfashion".

It was located at the former Cyberlab site (New Years, Burning Man
Afterparty) at the Embarcadero end of Folsom.  The place was vastly improved
in appearence since the last time I saw it.  I was surprised to find that my
friend Peter was one of the new tenents there (sharing the space with
Dimension 7).

There were two video projectors and a laser in use.  The visuals were
colorful, active and mixed live. The meshed well with the music (hip
hop/trip hop).  Before the fasion show could start though, the fire marshall
came can kicked everyone out of the building while he did a surprise
inspection.  Everyone was told to go away and come back in an hour.  Why did
the marshal get tipped off?  A sneaky club owner maybe?

Anyway, my friends and I drove around looking for something else to do, but
were suitably board with the rest of the city.  We came back and found that
the marshal had passed the place (all that fixup went to good use) but that
they were only letting people in with hand stamps.  Needless to say, it was
pretty vacant for an hour or more before people started filtering back in.

The fashion show was cool.  The models came out four different times for the
four designers and danced on elevated podiums.  I wish I had been taking
notes so I could give you some designer names as they all did good work.
One designer had a line of slinky black and white miniskirts and tight
jackets,  Not terribly adventerous but probably something you could wear to
more than a rave (but not to your Mom's house).  Another designer displayed
"moon suits" with silverized, body fitting cloths with cool iconic looking
blue, red, and yellow patches.  The same designer showed some skirts and
jackets made out of hinged plastic blue and red tiles.  Not very
utilitarian, but cool looking.  Another designer went off with some soft
fluffy pastel BIG clothing.  Enormous hats and clothing with foam
pertuberences.   One thing even had spider or crab arms sticking out of it.
More like costumes really.  I think I liked those the most.

Thing seemd to finish up around 4 or 5.

All and all, it was a rather fun thing to do and I did enjoy a lot of the
music.  Big points for the visuals too.  Not a rave thing per se, but
a cool thing to do on a Sat. night.

- PT

that last post by purple tiger about the fashon show jogged my memory 
about an idea that i have (and im sure that everyone else has had at one 
point or another). 

anyways, what i need is some information about taking a computer graphic 
and having it printed on a t-shirt. silk screen will not be crisp enough, 
and i thought i heard that a bubble jet printer would take a certain type 
of iron-on paper that will print a graphic, and then let you iron it on a 
shirt, but this still wont be as nice as looking as having some sort of 
computer(?) doing the printing on the t-shirts. 

so, if anyone has a vague idea of what im talking about, and what i need, 
please let me know if there are companies that do this sort of thing. im 
thining that probably around the emeryville area is where they might be 
located, but only a guess.

thank you very much whoever you are for any sort of information :)

I just heard this through the grapevine, but apparently Alameda County, in
review of the events surrounding Cyberfest have decided that the event was
dangerous, a public embarassment, and a throuroughly un-positive event. As
such they have decided to forbid all future all-night events in Alemeda County.

Does anybody who lives in Alemeda Co. know anything more, such as the specific
wording of their decision?

Does anyone know what issues are on the ballot for Nov's elections in regards
to Alameda Co.?

Who are the people who made that decision, and how do we get in touch with
them to persuade them to change it?

Peace,
Colin

     Now that I've thought about it, Gabber, as such, did start dropping 
     out of my musical awareness back in late 1993.  I started buying 12" 
     techno records in winter of 1992, and was quite fond of hard music.  
     They way I learned it, "Gabber" was a subform of "hardcore." 
     "Hardcore" meant anything with a hard loud distorted 909 kick drum 
     that ran from about 150-210 bpm.  Decorative noises on top of the kick 
     were usually very electronic, buzzy, and dissonant.  Anything from 
     Lenny Dee's "Industrial Strength" label is a good example.  "Gabber," 
     as I said above, was considered a subform of hardcore.  The style was 
     shown by the Dutch labels such as Mokum and KNOR.  What differentiated 
     it from hardcore in my mind was a sort of silliness (and I'm not being 
     derogatory here).  I had one record that used a sampled blow dryer to 
     provide decoration of the kick drum, and many others that involved 
     guys screaming in Dutch.  To me, anything screamed in Dutch sounded 
     silly.  It would make us laugh while we were dancing to it at parties. 
     My friends and I would dance around and hug or tickle each other, or 
     just hold hands and jump around.
     
     Anyway, I was finding interesting records in both the hardcore and 
     Gabber genres up until the summer of 1993.  It seemed that suddenly 
     they were dropping off the face of the earth, or at least the really 
     silly ones were.  I was still finding stuff from PCP, Influence, and 
     Industrial Strength.  My point with all this is that whoever said 
     Gabber was dead does have a point, especially if viewed from the angle 
     of the record-buyer.
     
     While I'm on a roll, let me address hard trance.  I think Hardfloor's 
     classic, "Hardtrance Acperience" (yes, that's how it's spelled) is a 
     misnomer.  I have two or three copies of this record...it clocks in 
     under 130bpm, and while it's an amazing example of what some people 
     call "new acid," it's not at all hard trance.   (Side note:  it's a 
     shame every Hardfloor track sounds like a rehash of "Acperience," but 
     I have a cheezy love for Hardfloor anyway).  They way I learned it, 
     hard trance starts around 140bpm and can get as fast as hardcore, but 
     rather than having major distortion on the kick drum and dissonant 
     noises as decorations, the drum beats are more subtle and there's 
     actual melodic content.  DJ Alex, of the former Gaia Mantra records, 
     walks in this musical neighborhood at times.  
     
     There's a really nice area where trance, house, and acid overlap and 
     intermix, and some of my favorite records fall into that category.  
     For an example, listen to Union Jack's "Two Full Moons and a Trout" 
     (now appearing on a compilation near you).  Sublime.  DJ Ethan works 
     this area excellently.

   Tribal Future ought to be a lot of fun if you can get to it. On
   Saturday, Larry has organized a small picnic for SFRavers - it's a
   good way to meet a few of the email addresses. The Chemical Brothers
   show on Sunday should be good too, they came through here as the Dust
   Brothers a year or so ago.
   
   Finally, get tickets ASAP for the Friends and Family next weekend.
   They will be on sale at Tribal Future, Ameba (starting on Monday), and
   MAD. There aren't very many, and they will go quickly.

NOTICE

Hyperreal will be down from 3pm on Friday, October 20th to 3pm on 
Monday October 23rd.  This is due to major electrical work being done at 
Organic, and due to other constraints which are pretty much unavoidable.  
This means the web sites and mailing lists will be down, although hyperreal 
mail will be spooled at other machines to prevent bouncing.  

Apologies for the inconvenience and the short notice.

	Brian

Is that Thomas as in UK/wicked-affiliated thomas?? 

Damn, where in  da heck has he been? -- i've missed his attitude/taste
in music since the good old days ... damn, where's my blunt, my cane,
and my rocking chair? Step right up to the porch and let me tell you a
story... yeah, back then things were so tough, but we were so cool...
that we'd have to dance backwards just to get ahead! You'd have to walk
30 miles in the snow in pink sateen shorts and bondage gear just to
arrive at skool, recite a meaningless zen koan in a bleak and empty
field, and trudge home. Time moved sideways -- we'd have to wait till
the stop signs changed color before you could go! People ran off pure
alien energy alone --  we never ate and would only drink water to keep
the drugs from cristalizing around our tongues, eyes and noses. Hell,
we were such a public menace that the gum'mint forced us to wear full
biohazard suits just to prevent  people from catching a contact high!
Yeah, you kids nowadays, you have it easy! Damn fuzzy-headed skateboard
totin' 'lil rug-rats!

Anyways, ... if it's really Thomas, I'm there! Lemme know!

PS: Now playing: Just bought this 3CD compilation called "the serious
road trip" from melody maker (UK), 1994. hardbag (ceasefire), laurent 
garnier (rex attitude), leftfield (release the dubs), dust brothers (be
that thing), secret knowledge (nuttin' dub), the aloof (circumstances),
system 7 (desir, live), finitribe (u g t update), higher intelligence
agency (delta, live), drum club (space angel station), lion rock
(soundtrack in a palace of delights, spooky vs chapterhouse (we are
beautiful), loop guru (yayli), banco de gaia (white paint), transglobal
underground (el hedudd), pressure of speech (pressure of speech), ege
bam yasi (eightball), pip (midnight vibration), the orb (plateu of
normality), and the last whole cd is Orbital doing remind (live at
glastonbury). Looked like a good bet for $23.00 and it benefits
children's charity in bosnia... other than that, i had no idea what
this is, but i got the feeling I'd be as happy with it as I was with
purchasing my first Acid House/Rave stuff with "Give Peace A Dance
Volume 1" (1990?).

up next: On-U sound volume 5 compilation
	 Dub Syndicate -- Stoned Immaculate
	 Audio Active -- Happy Happer
	 Rebirth of cool acid jazz compilation....

PS: LP's suck. I really don't care if I got all this stuff a few years
too late but on CD! I'm still as happy as a kid in a candy store and
that's all that matters right?

This Saturday, October 21st, Consciousness Lab Ambient Sound Research and I
will be performing live ambient music along with prerecorded soundscapes at
Yearba Buena Gardens from 12:00 Noon to 2:00 p.m.  The event is presented by
the San Francisco Center for the Arts at Yerba Buena Gardens, and will be
the final show of the year.  Hey it's FREE and OUTDOORS.  So come out and
chill with C.L.A.S.R. (of which I have just recently been asked to consider
myself a member, and that makes me happy :)  If you're wondering where it
is, it's accross the street from the SF MOMA.  The 5th Street Garage works
well for parking.  Hope to see you there.  Say hi to us if you go....I still
gotta get one of those damn laminates...I've never even seen one.

>silk screen will not be crisp enough, 

you can get really, really fine lines by doing 6+ color separations 
of your screen. You can prit hairlines. It's just a matter of knowing 
what you're doing with the silk scrren... it's really difficult to 
register the screens.

yup. it's out there. I don't know much but that I know I'd seen an as 
somewhere.

> computer(?) doing the printing on the t-shirts. 

As far as I know there's no printer than can run a t-shirt thru it.

Sounds to me like you need a really high-quality photo silk sreen. We 
(me and my coworkers) don't know of any here in the Bay Area, but 
have heard that a place called Graphic Traffic in Emeryville might be 
a good place to check out.

Yeah...fnf doesn't quite fit my idea of slammin' beats...still, usually

The harmonic simplicity has its good points and its bad points.  The good 
points are that you can get a really good crowd reaction with something 
that follows a particular pattern, for example anything by Hardfloor with 
their big cheezy acid break/build two-thirds of the way through every 
track they write.  I've seen the screaming and whooping and cheering 
during the build up, and then the frenzied dancing when the beats come 
back.  It works.

The bad point about this type of harmonic simplicity is that Hardfloor 
uses the big cheezy acid break/build two-thirds of the way through every 
track they write (but I love them anyway).

I think that techno, when done very well, can share something with fuges. Both 
are very mathimatically based, and involve pattern transformations like 
inverting, mirroring, and transposition.  Of course, it's just as easy to write 
a bad techno track as it is to write a bad pop song, and there's a good deal of 
both out there.  For me, the fun lies in uncovering the good stuff, and I can 
see how that gets frustrating.
  
>But maybe I'm just listening to the wrong discs and djs. Can anyone

>I'm longing for?

It might not be readily present in the form.  Techno primarily exists 
as dance music, designed to cause body movement and emit a certain 
emotional response (which, as near as I can define, is a drive to dance 
more :-) :-) ).  A sub-species of techno/ambient calls itself 
"Intelligent Dance Music" and claims to be more musical and artistic 
than the basic "thump-make-you-dance" track.

Also, with the emphasis on live DJing being to create a smooth set with 
seamless transitions, some of the more complex experimental tracks 
might not get played because they can't be incorporated into the set.

What I'm getting at is that it might be asking too much of the techno 
genre to make it as musically complex as jazz or classical.  I went to 
Jazz clubs a few times in New York city, and no one danced there.  I've 
been to classical concerts, and no one danced there either.  Maybe 
because Jazz and classical elict more of an intellectual response they 
don't make good dance music?

There's people on this list who know a lot more about artists and 
labels who produce "Intelligent Dance Music."  Maybe they can give us 
an overview of who is good to listen to?  We've got some disks by Banco 
de Gaia and Global Communications at home that are quite excellent, but 
I'm sure that's barely a beginning.

Ah shit, since everybody else is tossing in their hard techno
recommendations, I guess I'll do the same. There is a _lot_ of high-quality
harder techno coming out right now. I tend to go for the more minimal, dark
stuff (no offense, NVG8R, but too much acidtrance makes me wanna barf).
Stuff like this:

	o Recent Bandulu outings on Infonet
	     I especially recommend "Crisis A'Gwarn / Fight the Oppressors,"
	     which sounds like nothing else out there. Hard as hell, yet
	     dubby at the same time. These guys exist in a realm of their
	     own. Their full-length CDs are all great, although they're much
	     more relaxed than the singles.
	o Djungle Fever / Mono Tone / Structure / Force Inc. / Global
	  Electronic Network / Profan
	     Quality, fast acid, cranked out with incredible proliferacy by
	     a small group (< 6 people) of deranged acidheads originally
	     from Cologne, Germany. Yeah, these labels wobble in and out of
	     existence as the principle crew move from continent to
	     continent (Khan is living in NYC now, so I think that rules out
	     Djungle Fever, and for some reason Force Inc. is putting out
	     Chicago acid house right now). However, the good shit on these
	     labels is _really_ good. An excellent introduction to the
	     Cologne sound is the day-glo _Acid Resistant_ compilation that
	     Sm:)e Communications put out early this year. Another good
	     example of the Cologne sound is the recent stuff by Air Liquide
	     (although I strongly recommend avoiding _The Increased
	     Difficulty of Concentration_. I know that a lot of people like
	     it, but it bores the crap out of me).
	o PCP / Dance Extacy 2001 / Cold Rush / Super Special
	     Hardcore's last great hope. This family of labels has been
	     pretty quiet recently, but _nobody_ has ever surpassed them for
	     that early '91 stadium techno sound. Mean, low, and nasty
	     tunes, totally lo-fi recording, and for the most part
	     minimalistic, ravey sounds.  Some of it is just _brutal_, too
	     (like most of the stuff on Super Special). Hard to find music
	     on this coast, but almost always worth the effort.
	o Out Of Orbit.
	     This ACV sublabel puts out consistently great hardcore,
	     generally with completely bizarre rhythms and incredibly deep
	     bass. The two records on this label that I've been able to find
	     both totally _stomp_.
	o Communique / Analog / Drop Bass Network.
	     The Midwest Hardcorps. Some fast, some slow, some hard, some
	     soft. It's all straight-up acid of one stripe or another,
	     though. I have an old doublepack of Woody McBride's on right
	     now, and it's beautiful music, the sort of music I always hope
	     somebody will throw on the decks at 3 in the morning. If you
	     want to hear what extremes the 303 can be torqued into
	     emitting, here's your chance. Even the slower stuff is pretty
	     damn good. Of course, the odds of any of this material being
	     available on CD is infinitesimal. The people that run these
	     labels barely have enough money to put out 12"s.
	o Generator
	     Since Detroit is synonymous with techno, it makes sense that
	     there would be at least _one_ straight-up hardcore label out of
	     there, and Generator is it. Run by the friendly, sincere, and
	     more than a little bit wicked Alan Oldham (DJT1000@aol.com),
	     Generator puts out some of the most amazingly brick-hard stuff
	     I've ever heard coming out of the states. Most of it defies
	     easy categorization, too.
	o World Power Authority / Underground Resistance
	     If I'm going to talk about Detroit, I have to mention UR. The
	     three World Power Authority singles (literally - each one is
	     one-sided, with the remaining side being used to tell a story,
	     which is engraved in the vinyl) are all underground classics.
	     Anyone that has been to any techno parties in the Bay Area has
	     almost certainly heard "The Seawolf," which is the biggest hit
	     of the bunch with its loads of acid and submarine klaxons. The
	     old UR is classic hardcore, too, although to my ears it sounds
	     somewhat dated now. A good UR CD is the classic _Revolution For
	     Change_, which wanders in and out of print. It's been put out
	     on at least three different labels that I know of, and every so
	     often somebody runs off anothr batch.
	o Synewave NY
	     Damon Wild is a New York acid legend. He's put out more classic
	     hard acid tracks than any other American, period. And this is
	     his label. While he, like almost all of the old-school hardcore
	     folks, has mellowed considerably over the past two or three
	     years, his label still cranks out some great, hard tunes.
	o Reload
	     These guys are the flag-bearers for harder Belgian techno. I
	     particularly recommend Accelerator, volumes 1 and
	     2. Reminiscent of the best old-school Jeff Mills stuff, back
	     when he was a hardcore artist. Dubby, spacy, deep and
	     hard. Reload has a compilation out which pretty fairly
	     represents what it's up to.
	o Disko B / Cheap
	     The most famous artists on this label are DJ Hell and Patrick
	     Pulsinger. DJ Hell is a chimera; no two tracks of his sound the
	     same, and he's been known to be just a tad bit derivative in
	     the past. But when he does things right, he can put together
	     stunning work. Among the classics he's recorded are "Sprung Aus
	     Den Wolken" and "Allerseelen," the latter of which got remixed
	     into a delirious, high-speed nightmare by Jeff Mills.  Patrick
	     Pulsinger is something else entirely. He's really into rubbery,
	     lo-fi acid. It sounds like nothing else, and it's quite often
	     not very hard. It's not very accessible, though.  He's
	     definitely into his own thing.
and last, but certainly not least:
	o Sabrettes
	     A lot of people assume that since this label is a sublabel of
	     Sabres of Paradise (or the family of labels that used to be
	     known as Sabres of Paradise) that the music is similarly
	     friendly and relaxed. Ha ha! Not even close. Totally wicked,
	     banging techno. From the slow crunch of Chelsea Grin's "Animal
	     Factory" through the straight-up speediness of the Turbulent
	     Force EP, these people have all of the hardcore bases
	     covered. Easily my favorite label in the whole wide
	     world. Especially because they put out a lot more than just
	     hardcore: everybody should run out and buy Innersphere's _Outer
	     Works_. The _Pink Me Up_ compilation is worth a listen as well,
	     although it doesn't sound like much of the stuff that Sabrettes
	     has been putting out recently.

Something else worth keeping in mind is that it's getting increasingly hard
to differentiate between hard house and hard techno. Recent releases by
Robert Armani, Mike Dearborn, and DJ Skull completely blur the
line. Hardness is more a state of mind than anything quantifiable, and
although most of the really hard house that I like never strays above 130
BPM, it can be almost unlistenably hard.

Also, because Derek hasn't emphasized it enough, I thought I'd point out
that he runs a really high-quality mail order record service. I would
also say that Derek is one of the few people on this planet that I would
just send money to and say, "Hey, man, send me some good stuff." He's got
impeccable taste in techno (he should -- you should see his bedroom). Drop
him a line (moses@teleport.com) if you ever get frustrated with trying to
find stuff in the Bay Area.

Finally, I think I should also point out that it really doesn't matter
whether the music is hard or soft, fast or slow, grim or happy. This is more
a preemptive strike than a response to anything anybody's said, because it
seems like anytime the techno / house thread comes up, people start to
arguing. Any halfway rational DJ is going to have records that scatter all
over the spectrum, and any healthy raver kid is going to sometimes be in the
mood for harder stuff and sometimes want the warm fuzzy beats that San
Francisco is most famous for. I should know -- I managed to completely burn
myself out on house a couple years ago, but there are still times when I
really crave Wicked's sounds.

October 19 1995

Announcing the release of RevoLucid for the SGI!

This message is going out to everyone who sent e-mail to me, requesting more
  information on RevoLucid, the MIDI software which does weird things.

It is now ready, and is scheduled to start shipment October 31.

Dear All;

	First, I would like to thank all the people who sent the 
wonderful posts of support & love, the helped me through 6 of the most 
awful days of my life. You truely know what it is to see that light that 
shine's from within you, cause you saw it in me. :)

	Well, after a long 2 - 3 days at Alta Bates Hospital, while during
almost constant interviews, testing & evaluation, by NON-intern,
experienced Doctors, an my on-going health care professional (Love ya Dr.
B); which unfortuately, & unpredictablily included an unprovoked attack &
beating; from another patient; in a manic & psychotic state, while asleep
in my hospital room, the diagnose given to me by the IDIOT ER Doctor was
labeled as a misdiagnose, due to insurance purposes(needing a diagnose in
order to bill) :*, lack of a complete history, and my on-going health care
professionals unavailability for consultation. 

	Leaving me with my original diagnose of someone recovering from a
horrific childhood. I'm told that formerly abused children, as adults, are
often misdiagnosed, with everything from, bi-polar disorder,
schizophrenia, chemical depression, paranoia, to the very general border-line
personality disorder, ...etc;  especially when symtomology is looked at
under a virtual microscope, like it is in a hospital emergency room.
 
NOTE; That certain recreactional drugs can contribute, exacerbate, & even
create conditions/symtomology not previously displayed, that can lead to a
misdiagnose. Methaphedamine/Speed/Crank/Quick/Crystal...etc being the
leader in this catogory. This is one drug that I cannot afford to use
anymore, though I still respect THE RIGHT OF OTHERS TO EXPERIMENT WITH IT. 

	So on the positive side, I learned a lot about myself, who my real
friends are, and a lot about the state of medical knowledge/symptomlogy
relating to childhood abuse. It's a shame how little we know still about
the long term affects of childhood abuse, and the fact that the cycle
continues into adulthood due to ignorance & unawareness in our selfs, our 
communities & our medical communities. 

	On the negative side, my celabration over the liberation of that
awful diagnose & those 6 days will have to be postponed until next week,
due to the physical injuries received from the attack at the hospital. I
don't hold any anger or wishful revenge for the person who attacked me, he
clearly was not himself, and I've seen the difference that medication can
make in people suffering from bi-polar disorder. 

	I remember saying that "We All Shine," and even he deserves a lot
of PLUR as do we all.  Who knows, if there was more PLUR in all our lives,
I KNOW that there would be a lot less abuse & mental illness in our world
& our lives.  An as much as it hurt me personally, even the people who I
thought were my friends, who ran from me at a time when I needed them the
most, deserve it as well, so that they can eventually love themselves, 
and at least I know now who I can count on when the real storm comes. 

	But getting back to my personal celabration/victory/vidication, I
guess it will have to be at Friend's & Family, funny how thing's work out
huh = >. Thanks for your love, support, unconditional caring, & wonderful 
hugs, that incredibly stubborn, person sometimes I feel doesn't deserve 
it. But thanks, just the same anyway = > purrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

Okay, I know it's twice in one week but I might be able to make it worth
someone's worthwile. The standard data:

Space Funk
Oct 20, 10-early
DJ Sifu, Tony Fader, Chow Yung Fat, Phonic, Tim (Santa Cruz), DJ Mike P
alsos Samo & More

18+
Info: 510-433-9770

This is mostly the trip-hop guys from Your Momma's House.

I have it on good word that the More is another room of faster music put on
by Yours Truly (Chesapeake), Rob Doten, Stephanie (Santa Cruz), and Spesh,
plus two more blokes from Santa Cruz.

In any event, it should be a quixotic blend of basic house, tweakin acid,
jungle (supposedly Stephanie is spot on here), and the San Frandisco sound.
Presuming I don't get bumped, I'm really itching to throw on some Steve
Stoll, Tata Box Inhibitors, and a few Relief Records tracks.

AND, I have two complementary admits to burn. So give me your best sob
story and I'll see what I can do. Contest closes 5:00 pm Friday.

Latez.

     Hey all, is anybody from Santa Cruz going to F&F?  Besides gas I'll be
willing to pay for their ticket and try to add as much fun to the car ride
there as possible (whatever that's worth, my jokes are just about bad enough
it would be more fun listening to nothing ;'P).  If you can lend a helping
hand, or a set of wheels, page me at 684-4834, if for some reason I decide to
be an insolent little punk and not call back, try 423-5963 (both in the 408
area code).  Come on guys, I gotta get to this party!            -Wurz ;'D

        Hmm this is interesting.  This got me thinking about 'IDM' and as
to whether it's "intelligence" came from harmonics or not.  A lot of things
i find interesting in this genre do have amazingly complex harmonies and
(at best) amazingly complex rhythmns.  Autechre (for me) is a prime
example.  They have it goin' on ALL OVER. Their use of low and high
frequencies, their harmonics, their use of rhthmn, really mindblowing.  BUT
you'd never hear it at a a club (though i have heard things in ambient
rooms a couple times and i was fortunate enought to see them live almost
two years ago).  Another example of harmonics and rhythmns that are pretty
complex is the Irresistible Force (mixmaster morris).  Using samples
primarily and layering like crazy then peeling back the layers, at some
point in his work you can count at tons of different rythmns and harmonics
that are beyond the boom-tsk house stuff.  A lot more "mental" music i
suppose might be an definition of intelligent music.  I've been told i
listen to mental music but at the same time nothing beats (no pun intended)
moving the body that houses (oops, another pun) the mind and soul :)
        Along this point, i would also say that a lot of Goa Trance is
heavily based in harmonics, rather than other types of more percussive
trance.  I find that some of the melodies can be a bit cheesy, a bit to
'anthemic' like "OH MY GOD I'M RUSHING SO HARD" type of melodies.  I guess
i'm into subtlety ;) But otherwise, i think goa stuff is a pretty good
mixture of complexity and dancebility.
        Anyways, it's all good, whatever turns you on :)

On this subject, let me emphasize that car pooling is *really* important
for this party as parking is not ample. 5 per car would be optimum...

hi follks.

it's me, i'm back, he who was formerly known as sshivaa, actually shalom, who
is now disssolve. i've changed handles for a number of reasons, not the least
of which is that i'd failed to pay my AOL fees for so long that they retired
sshivaa. just as well, because disssolve is exactly me. with three s's, no
less.
  
unfortunately, i was cut off just after making my post requesting information
about the dc, baltimore and philadelphia rave world, so i was unable to read
any of your responces. if you wouldn't mind, would you please send me your
responces again? gallons of gratitude gushingly...

and if you didn't read my original post, i'm looking for ways to get
connected to the dc, blat and philthy rave world. i'm going there for two
weeks, starting on the 25th. i want, above all, to find a lovely halloween
rave. if the rave had an emphasis on perpertually pagan pantheistic
perpendicular paradoxes, all the better. but really, i just want to see how
they funk it up in the exotic east. 

my heading was Life, the Universe & Everything, and i don't intend to
dissapoint you, or myself - the answer is 46. 

[or was it 47?]

beautiful people, life richly, breathe deep...

ranting and raving,
shalom

Hello everyone,
    First I would like to apologize to everyone whom I have not 
repsonded to lately. I have been up to my neck in school! Also I have 
been having netcom problems...

    Most importantly, does anyone know if Narnia is really going on 
this time? I feel like a road trip this weekend cause I finally bought 
a car. (Yes, Greg Sandler, the ride moocher finally got a car!!!) So my 
friend Joe and I were considering going to San Diego, (and LA for 
records! :) But, I really don't want to go down there and find out 
Narnia is cancelled, (again). That happened to me last time, and it 
really sucked. So, if anyone knows anything, please write to me. 
(Thanks in advance!) 

Peace, love, and harmony to all,

Greg :)

Considering the parking limitations, might there be an area we could 
set aside indoors for parking bicycles?

I think Detroit techno comes the closest to this while still remaining
danceable. It certainly isn't free jazz, but they tend to use the scale
for expressive purposes instead of using it to sell alot of records. 

Some Detroit labels to look out for are...
+8, Transmat, Red Planet, UR & Metroplex. I'm not sure how easy it is to
get stuff on CD's though.

Hi,

After skimming SFRaves for a few weeks now I thought I'd take a moment to
say hello. My name is Matthew Laubach. I've been going to Bay Area raves
occasionally from 1991 until last spring and much more often since then.
I've probably met some of you without knowing it. I've attended many Sunsets
and a couple of Full Moons as well as many indoor parties whose names tend
to slip my mind. 

I've really been enjoying alternative culture related resources on the net,
including this list. It is amazing to see how naturally high technology and
alternative culture complement one another. I am very optimistic about the
chances that the near future will hold dramatic, positive social changes
made possible through the revolution in global communication which we are
taking part in.

Tonight is the opening night for the Ambient Cafe, which some friends of
mine will be running. It's at 400 Haight St., 415-621-1781. Live music will
be provided by Olive and special guest WEYOUME, and there will be a spun
ambient mix with Mike and Joe. The Ambient Cafe will offer afterparties,
starting before dawn and offering smoothies, sounds, and tranquility.
Tonight the cafe will be open from 6:00 pm until whenever. I'll probably be
by before midnight. 

I look forward to getting to know you, both online and in person!

Matthew

My computer tells me that on Wed, 18 Oct 1995, John S. Lee shared:

I second John's recommendation for Terrence Hallinan for district 
attorney.  As compared to the other two candidates, Hallinan has a long 
record of protecting civil liberties, and if elected would focus on 
prosecuting violent criminals, not persons committing nonviolent "crimes" 
that shouldn't even be against the law.
	
I also feel that Terrence has a lot of integrity compared to most 
politicians.  He spoke to the San Francisco Libertarian Party last month 
and was very forthright.  When he disagreed with us, he didn't attempt to 
deceive us or say what he thought we wanted to hear to get our votes, but 
honestly and politely explained his views.

Here I must disagree.  Ben Hom is the best candidate in the mayor's 
race.  He is a businessman -- maybe this is why he understands how the heavy 
hand of government can adversely affect people.  Hom is the only 
candidate talking about reducing taxes and privatizing city services.  
Achtenberg talks a nice game about making San Francisco government more 
efficient, but Hom walks the walk.  The "privatization study" put forward 
by Mayor Jordan (Prop. K) is a sham which will not encourage real 
privatization -- don't vote for it.

I know this isn't directly rave-related, but who's in charge will 
definitely affect us one way or another.  Thanks to Lee Fogel for 
bringing it up.  John is also right for saying if we mobilize, they will 
not be able to ignore us.  Power in numbers.  My general rule when voting 
is this: Yes on any proposition or candidate that empowers people by 
reducing the size or scope of government; no to any proposition or 
candidate that promises to take power away from people or increase the 
government leviathan.

I would request also an area for parking Rollerblades, except that 
they're small enough I usually have no trouble getting them to take them 
at the coat check, sometimes with a quizzical look, or in the absence of 
a coat check, usually someone is nice enough to let me stash them behind 
a DJ booth or vendor table.  |)-

I'm posting this request on behalf of a fellow artist who's looking for 
people with art and expertise who'd like to contribute to the creation of 
a sensory art exhibit, planned to happen this December. I've included his 
description of it below.

The visionary behind this work, Mark Jackman <mark.jackman@etak.com>, is
especially interested in finding people with expertise in audio and visual
displays. So it was a natural that I thought of all the bounty of
creativity among all the folks who are part of the sfraves community. 

Drop him a line if you simply have some art to contribute, or could 
assist with the design and setup of a visual and auditory experience. 

Also, if you know of possible spaces to place the installation, any leads 
would be much appreciated.

EXHIBITIONS AND COMPETITIONS


SENSOPHRENIA
CALL FOR ENTRIES

This exhibit can be described in many ways. It's a multimedia sensory
extravaganza, what the inside of your
brain would be like if they had designed your DNA. It's what it would be
like to listen to every radio station and watch every television broadcast
at once. It's an assault on your sensory cortex, a new experience in background
acclimation. It might be pretty insane.

Really it's a room filled with a seemingly haphazard array of video
monitors, speakers, old TV sets, lights, etc. designed under
computer-control to present a fast-cutting audio-video (and possibly
other-sensory as well) montage with two basic principles in mind: First, no
particular image/sound/etc. remains for very long, so that the viewer is
unable to settle in and truly focus on anything coherently to the exclusion
of the remaining cacophony. Second, despite this lack of focusibility, the
design is intentionally made to constantly draw at the viewers'
attention/focus, demanding it first in one way, then another and another.

For example, a plethora of seemingly disconnected images (the Apollo moon
landing, time-lapse flowers blooming, OJ, the Love Boat, cucumbers being
sliced, a live shot from cameras in the room of those currently
viewing,...) is being presented on the various monitors and rapidly
cross-cutting when suddenly four or eight monitors all come into sync with
the same image, or different parts of the same image. Then another
monitor's image and the dominant sound both turn into static. Then an image
begins to propagate from monitor to monitor across the room, demanding that
the viewer pay attention to it, until that demand is eclipsed by another
more urgent, etc., etc.

Some people might manage to mentally withdraw from this sort of barrage,
but the design is intended to prevent that (though of course they can
always just leave). Instead, viewers must give up their desire to focus on
a static/consistent image or presentation and allow the flow of information
to wash over them en masse. As good as the human brain is at acclimating to
sensory input, this multi-sensory experience is an extremely interesting
one to allow to be your "background" level.

I'm looking for interested participants--physical location not
important--to contribute towards an exhibition of Sensophrenia! in several
months (December '95). Video and audio source material is needed, both
newly-generated as well as collection from archival sources. Simply contact
me if you'd be interested in contributing to the pool of material and/or
involving yourself more deeply with the project. If this idea really turns
you on, those interested in contributing to the editing, design of the A/V
computer-control system, administrative, publicity, or any other aspects of
the project that appeal to you are more than welcome.

Dear Darren,

My computer tells me that on Thu, 19 Oct 1995, you shared,

> Hay- I have been called a man of leisure many of times in my day and really 
> enjoy nothing more then to lie back on the grass with head phones on and day 
> dream the world away- So I am really curious about this class your in Leisure 
> & Contemporary Society.  What's it all about? 

	This class is part of the Recreation-Leisure Studies Department at SF 
State.  The course catalog describes it as follows:

A critical behavioral and social analysis of the impact of contemporary 
and future leisure trends related to technology, aging, time deepening, 
activity patterns, resources, etc. and their implications for human 
health, happiness, and quality of life.

	What we actually do and discuss in class isn't always quite so 
ambitious as the above may sound, but some of it is quite interesting.  
The "bias" of the course seems to be that our society is dominated by a 
work ethic; that the pace of life is speeding up; that people have less 
true leisure time than they once did; that this is largely due to the 
complex, mechanical nature of our society; that this trend is 
accelerating; and that this is not a good thing.  It is a message that I 
largely agree with, even though I am a firm believer in science and 
technology and their ability to make the world a better place.
	We've been given a lot of information that I think ravers could 
relate to in a positive way.  One recent film we saw called "Humor - The 
Key To Success" described a very interesting experiment...
	...The woman giving the presentation asked for two volunteers 
from the audience.  Two guys came up, and she gave one of them a 
Super-Soaker water gun.  Then she showed the audience a magic marker, and 
told them that when she started the clock, the one guy would have 30 
seconds to get the marker from her.  If he didn't have it by that time, 
the other guy would squirt him with the water gun.
	When they started, the guy tried several different ways of 
getting the marker.  First he asked her to hand it to him -- she 
pretended she didn't know what he was talking about.  Then he tried to 
trick her into putting it down, then he tried to snatch it, all to no 
avail.  He got squirted when his time was up.
	The presenter had asked people meanwhile to be thinking about how 
they would get the marker.  When the exercise was over, she told the 
audience that how they would have attempted to get the marker was the way 
they tended to deal with people in relationships.  The key, she said, was 
honesty.  In her experiment, no one ever came up on stage and just said 
to her, "Hey, I don't want to get wet.  If you don't give me that marker 
in thirty seconds, this guy's going to soak me."  Most people choose 
subterfuge, manipulation, or force.  Kind of depressing, but definitely 
food for thought.  They say that awareness of a problem is the first step 
toward finding a solution.

	Then there's this gem, reprinted on the back of our class 
reader.  I don't know its origin, maybe someone on sfraves does, but I 
rank it right up there with the Desiderata in terms of life wisdom...

Hello , any F&F folks out there -

 At the last F&F , there was fruits and juice for sale. Would that mean that
it would be preferred that folks not bring foddstuffs to share? I usually
bring bananas .

Just wanted to tell any of you who missed the Chemical Brothers last night
you really missed out! That was the first time I've ever, ever seen any of
this music live, and it was Fuck'n amazing! The room was packed and all of
this energy was being channeled right at them, and they were giving it
right back. Best $10 dollars I've spent in weeks, If every party I go to
could be that cool.

Wayne, wayne@club.net have them. We will both be at FnF and will have a
supply on hand. OR send me a SASE and I will mail one back to you :)

Checked out the Chemical Bros. last night at the Troc.  Solid party.  
Lotsa faces, new and old, turned out for this one.  Jeno and Garth 
started things out.  Garth played a Chemical Bros. remix of "Tow Truck"
as a harbinger of things to come.  And then to the main event...
They were good, very good.  But great?  Well, that might depend on 
how familiar you are with "Exit Planet Dust".  Personally, I've owned 
this cd for a couple of months, so I had mixed feelings about hearing 
4 or 5 tracks that I've almost come close to burying into the ground.
Yet, it was still good to hear these "oldies-but-goodies" =) (a couple 
of nice remixes).  A couple of small train wrecks... well, maybe more like 
minor derailments -- but, hey, they're only human.  After their 45-minute 
set (yes, 45 minutes) about half of the jam-packed dancefloor filtered out,
leaving folks more room to dance as Jeno and Garth came back on for some
tag team (The New British Bulldogs? =).  100% drop-off in "eweh-eweh" 
(sorry, pet pieve).  Many thought that the Chemical Bros. were 
"incredible".  If I hadn't heard their cd already, i might have agreed.  
No "Life is Sweet" for the alt-rock crowd.  Just some good and dirty 
"trance"-"funk"-"triphop"-"breakbeat"-"techno"-"etc" "=)".       

-Rok         

ps. the upstairs chill room was really nice.

For a demonstration of this style of music, check out 'Mad' at the Bahia
Cabana tonight.  I am spinning with Joe Rice and Sho Kuwamoto.  We'll be
playing plenty of Detroit stuff as well as some trance and electro.  The
Bahia is at 1600 Market @ Franklin.  It only costs $1.00 before 11 and 3$
after.  Come check it out!

For those of you in the Palo Alto/ Menlo Park/Mountain View/
Silicon Valley area, I have a LIMITED number of F&F tickets
for sale.  There is a chance that the event will sell out
(the last one did) so get your tickets BEFORE the event
I will be at the door the night of the party and I will not
accept any hard luck stories :).  If you want ticks and your
in this area, you can leave a message at 541-5632 or if you can't
wait, page me at 415 306-7037.  This party will be a blast, the
space is awsome and it will definitely contribute to keeping
the underground alive.

dear sirs and madams,

this is shalom writing a hasty pre-work note to share my wish with all of you
that each of you lives the life you wish to live at this exact instant. 

here's where this wish comes from: i've decided that i can no longer delay my
life. i'm forgetting the word tomorrow and diminishing the overblown
importance of Yesterday. it's simple, yes, it's even cliched, and it's true:
now is the only time i've got. 

on the cosmic timetable, we hardly even register on the screen. we're
supermini-blips that are over even before they've begun. and at the same
time, each of us contains the entire cosmos within our breasts. [yes, men
have breasts (private argument, unrelated).]

so why am i writing? because these thoughts are too Uuumph to keep all
inside, all to little me. 

i'm leaving for the east coast early early wednesday for two weeks. i'm going
to try to find a halloween rave out there. a few of you have helped me find
connections that will make this possible. to each of you who helped, great
thanks.   

            wisdom tells me i am nothing.
            love tells me i am everything.
            and between these two my life flows. 
                    - swami iforgetwho

be beautiful, as you already are. 
shalom

There are no more tickets?....you have got to be kidding.  If anyone knows
where to get 2 I would really appreciate it.  I've never been to a F&F, and
was planning to go to this one.  Please help if you can :)

                 No,NO the more healthy stuff the better:). I'm sure you 
       can stash your extra fruit at the juice bar as there will be juice 
       and fruit provided for all this time around. Oh boy, 4 more days 
       to go :). HE-HE-BOO.

No, I am not scalping tickets. :)

The F&F tickets dispersed very quickly.  Many of them in large chunks.  I
estimate that people will have surplus tickets without anyone to give them
to.

Obviously, there are people who want to go.

I volunteer my services to hook the ravers with tickets with the ravers
that do not.

If you have extra tickets or think you might have extra tickets (you don't
know yet because your friends Rex and Melinda haven't called back yet) send
me email or give me a call.  Include a phone number or pager I can reach
you with and give me an estimate of how many (a range is fine) you might
have.  I'll call you (probably on Saturday) to see if you have extras that
need placing and make arrangements for the exchange.  Note that I will only
broker tickets at or below face value ($5).  Also, if you happen to find on
10pm on a Sat night that you have an extra ticket, definitely call me or if
you're at F&F, just find me.

If you need tickets, email or call me.  Tell me how many you want, and how
I should contact you on Saturday.  Since tickets could turn up during the
party, be sure to let me know if you want to be contacted after 10pm.  

How will I distribute them?  I will make a list on Friday night of the
people who want tickets.  I will sort it randomly.  I will give them out in
pairs (unless you only need one).  I will break up orders of more than 2
into multiple entries (if you want 10, your name will appear 5 times, in
random order).  On Sat. I will call/email everyone on the list letting them
know what order they are on the list and if I have tickets for them.  If I
can't make contact by 8pm, that person drops to the end of the list, and
I'll start calling the next person in line.  I suspect after 8pm things
will get hectic.  Since everyone will know what their order on the list is,
you'll know how much hope you have for tickets.  If you do get tickets
through me, we'll make arrangements for transfer as I may not have gotten
the tickets from the seller.  

I hope everyone thinks this is a fair way of doing it and those of you with
extra tickets see fit to place them with me.  If you want to give your
tickets away for free, let me know and I'll pass the free ones on based on
ability to pay.  If, through some mistake of my own, I end up with more
money than when I started, I'll give the extra to Komotion.  I'll eat the
losses too.

How to contact me:

	Purple Tiger aka Grant Blaha
	email: ptiger@sophistem.com
	pager/voicemail: 415/406-2109

I'll be packing a cell phone all week, so if you page I can call you back
immediately, or if you page me with a pager number, I can page you back to
the cell phone.

Finally, this could be a lot of work for me to do.  If anyone wants to
help, please don't be shy.  Also, please keep this to the list.  I don't
want my voicemail number ending up on some info line somewhere.

I'll see you all at F&F, I'll be the guy that glows purple in the dark.

PT

     Chemical Brothers...
     
     God the Troc is hot.  I had to imagine I was in a sauna sweating out 
     the butterscotch chip cookies I had binged on to deal with it.
     
     I was happy to hear the wall of noise swooping square wave sound of 
     the Chemical Brothers after an hour of melody and piano riffs.  Big 
     bass is the way to go:  I never really appreciated the Orb until I 
     heard them live on their HUGE sound system, and ditto for the Chemical 
     Brothers.  
     
     Imagine this:  The Chemical Brothers vs. Meat Beat Manifesto, live on 
     stage, playing back and forth off of each other's music.  Now that 
     would be something to see.
     
     MaD...
     
     Okay, so I haven't gone out much this year at all, but it was the best 
     party I've been to all year.  Joe Rice got really crunchy toward the 
     end of his set, with stripped down stuff that had a reverberating edge 
     and sounded pleasantly harsh and mechanical.  You may think this is a 
     contradiction in terms, but there's only so much lushness I can take.  
     The pure electonic feel of his and Sho's sets were exceedingly 
     refreshing.  
     
     Sho carried on Joe's mood, and gave us a tour of some Detriot-style 
     classics, including the definitive "Energy Flash."  It still sounds 
     good after all these years!  Sho also got technical on his mixes, 
     doing some cuts and transforms that added extra interest to the set.  
     It's really cool to hear two tracks you know and be able to appreciate 
     that the DJ is playing around with them.
     
     I'm sorry I missed Jon, but it was past my bedtime :-)  But thanks for 
     the party Jon, Joe, Sho, Alex, Ethan, and Nantsee.
     
     Random thoughts...
     
     I have found a mecca for the Junglists out there:  if you haven't 
     discovered Primal records in Berkeley yet, check them out.  They are 
     quite the Jungle crew and will talk the talk, find you killer records, 
     and point you to parties and the like.  So the next time you sigh that 
     there's not any jungle in the Bay Area, talk to them and they'll help 
     you find it.  
     
     I also really appreciate that they have THREE turntables with 
     headphones on which you can preview records, and that the staff 
     doesn't bother you or give you a hard time about using them.  No 
     signing out the headshell or applying for a special DJ card that lets 
     you preview things if the management feels like it.  For example, 
     Rasputnin's has a great selection, but it really sucks that it's so 
     difficult to get permission to actually hear anything.  
     
     Does anyone know what day Primal gets its shipments?  The selection 
     seemed REALLY picked over when I was there on Sunday.

  I'm going to add my thoughts to laural's perceptive comments:
  I realize that dance music has to have an emphatic, or at least 
"moving" beat. But I've been disappointed at the harmonic simplicity of 
all branches of techno over the years. I'm fed up with the old familiar 
chord progressions that betray either a lack of composing skill or a 
too-easily-satisfied ear. If the composers of techno would pay attention 
to jazz and classical music, maybe they could learn how to weave melodies 
into the higher harmonies of sophisticated chord progressions.
  But maybe I'm just listening to the wrong discs and djs. Can anyone 
suggest recordings that have the kind of complex harmonic progressions 
I'm longing for?

In repsone to those who have asked me what DIY culture is, I am attaching
a little ditty I found out on the web... I think it gives you a decent
idea of what is going on and through that, you get a good picture of what
DIY is about. The following is from:
http://www.cityscape.co.uk/users/bt22/party.html

so if you have a web browser handy, it will look a little nicer if you run
over there...

anyway, the text should follow...

DIY culture, Justice? and Exodus

Free parties

An obvious progression from Acid House parties was to link up with the
mobile sound systems of the free festival circuit that has toured Britain
since the sixties. The summer of 1992 was the honeymoon period for the
marriage of ravers and travellers. The culmination of these festi-raves was
an event held at Castlemorton at the end of May. Estimates of the numbers
present vary from 25,000 to 40,000; for many there it was the ultimate
party. The media depiction, however, was of a marauding invasion and the
public outrage sowed the seeds of the Criminal Justice Act 1994.

The tightening up of legislation aimed at stopping illegal parties has had
three results. The first is that the new laws have successfully forced some
people back into licensed events and nightclubs. The Government's action is
justified as protecting people by only allowing them to dance in venues that
comply with safety regulations, although in practice it is in the licensed
venues where people die.

There has been a death here in Bedfordshire, says Glenn Jenkins of Exodus.
Not at one of our 72 harmless dances, but in a club. It's one of those clubs
that is supposed to hold 500 but they pack in 1000. A guy collapsed in there
and he got barred  people monging out are bad business. His mates had to
take him to hospital in their car but got lost on the way. He died, but he
hadn't taken Ecstasy, he'd had two wraps of speed.

They're saying E's killing people at raves - 'the dance of death'. I'm
saying if it's E that kills then there'd be millions of people dead. It's
the heat and environmental conditions that kills people - you can't blame
Ecstasy. We have watched the harm creeping into the scene. I've stood on a
dance floor and sweated without even moving. You don't have to be a
scientist to know that's highly dangerous.

The second effect of the increase in legislation has been an emigration of
sound systems. After Castlemorton ten members of the Spiral Tribe sound
system were taken to court and charged with causing a public nuisance. The
trial in 1994; cost 4 million176 yet the defendants were freed through lack
of evidence, a local councillor admitted to me that because they had a high
media profile they had been made scapegoats. Spiral Tribe and other sound
systems have found a more cooperative response from foreign authorities. The
free party scene now encompasses many parts of the world from Goa to the San
Fransisco bay area.

The third effect became particularly noticeable with the passing of the
Criminal Justice Act. People have been so outraged by the draconian powers
to prevent parties that they appear to have become determined to create
bigger and better events. It has also seen the politicisation of the scene
with the Advance Party and United Systems voicing protests against the new
laws and forging links with other groups affected. Gail, who organises
illegal parties with the DIY collective Justice? in Brighton, describes how
the Act has affected them:

Because of the CJA we are even more determined to have better parties, so we
have to make them tightly organised. It's a lie that only licensed venues
are safe. We don't turn the water off, it's always cheap and freely
available. We make sure the venue is spacious, airy and well lit and that
there is a chill-out area. People are free to walk in and out if they want
to sit down, or take a breath of air. It may appear like it's disorganised
but we have our own form of stewarding, we have nurses attending, we have
fire extinguishers. We make sure that there are always people there who can
cope if anything bad happened. I think there will be more parties but I
don't know if it's a good idea to have them too large as it's not so easy to
keep an eye on what's happening. I think we probably do take advantage of
the E vibe that means people take care of each other.

DIY Culture

DIY (Do It Yourself) culture is experiencing a renaissance. Cosmo from
Justice? explained why:

In the eighties, a lot of people who were hacked off with the way we were
living, or were just plain bored, got off their arses and did something
about it. Free festivals, squat culture, the traveller movement and later
Acid House parties pay testament to the energy and vision of people who
decided it was now time to take their destinies into their own hands.

Now more and more people are getting exasperated with the way politicians
are out of touch, and their frustration turns to action when the people at
the top won't listen. This was especially true when the Criminal Justice Act
tried to criminalise the very lifestyles I have mentioned.

DIY culture was born when people got together and realised that the only way
forward was to do things for themselves. The term covers everything from
taking direct action against a road that is being bulldozed through your
area to campaigning for equal rights for the disabled. Ingenuity and
imagination are the key ingredients.

Justice? was born out of a desire to raise public awareness about the
Criminal Justice Act. One of their first high profile initiatives was to
squat a disused courthouse and turn it into a thriving community centre. The
squat was opened one Sunday night and by Monday a caf, information centre
and exhibition room were opened. Classes in Tai Chi, yoga and Shiatsu
happened regularly, there was space for artists to work, a crche, advice
for squatters, a visiting hairdresser, music evenings. Justice? were evicted
but have moved their community centre to another derelict building.

A sign in the courthouse summed up DIY philosophy:

1. This is going to be huge - realise it. Grow fins and swim

2. Listen to new people

3. Share responsibility

4. Nip egos and attitudes in the bud - no power struggle

5. Communications stop ructions - talk

6. If you are feeling stressed pass the job on and go!

7. Never laugh at fat bastards in clouds

A lot of money for renovating Justice?'s squatted courthouse was raised by
collections at parties. Gail explained the link:

The CJA is the main reason why theres a strong link between DIY and the
dance scene - theres lots of free parties and that's one obvious thing the
CJA attacks. DIY culture is about people getting annoyed with the system and
deciding to do it themselves, whether creating entertainment, food or
energy. You dont wait for these things to be provided.

DIY culture relies on people doing things without payment. We operate with a
different set of rules - most people put in work with the only reward being
the personal satisfaction of seeing other people having a good time. You
don't have to listen to rave music  we have poets, all sorts. People from
all walks of life all coming together, thats what it's about.

Desert Storm is another free party organisation based in Glasgow. As well as
putting on parties in Scotland, notably at the protest against the M77
extension through Pollok Park, they spent New Year taking their brand of
entertainment to war torn Bosnia. Desert Storm raised enough money to fund
their trip and a new lorry  their old one was painted in camouflage which
they were afraid might lead to problems!

Desert Storm and the Full On Dance Squad from Nottingham drove in the aid
convoy for 13 days arriving in Split in time to erect a makeshift nightclub
and host a Christmas party for refugees, UN soldiers and NGO workers. Unlike
Britain the Bosnian police insisted that Desert Storm turned the volume up
for their New Year party in Tuzla. They were amazed by their warm reception
from small children to elderly ladies in their dressing gowns crowding to
dance where it was sometimes too dangerous to walk.

Exodus

It seems strange that the Government is so opposed to what seems just 'a bit
of harmless fun'. Perhaps it is because such fun is "economically
unacceptable" as Jim Carey suggested in Squall, August 1994, or there may be
deeper reasons. In an interview with Sunscreem we discussed the significance
of their single 'Exodus': "It's saying come through the door - here we go.
Come along with us, or don't - it's about making a change." Glenn Jenkins of
Exodus agrees:

We called ourselves Exodus because what we were doing was knocking extortion
out of our lives. Exodus indicates a large number of people moving from one
lifestyle to another. Our inspiration came from Bob Marley who took his
inspiration from the Bible. It's all about freedom of thought. Emancipate
yourself from mental slavery - Bob Marley sings our anthems. He could see
that if we could hold down racial divisions and so on, then there would be
harmony. Harmony means heaven - heaven on earth is harmony on earth. We take
the Rastamen to be our forefathers, they played a large part in our
consciousness forming. Rastaman is a spiritual tag not just a black thing,
it's a soul issue, not a skin issue. Were the Rastamen that Bob Marley
inspired by coming here and making the album Exodus.

My first experience on MDMA was a really profound experience because
overnight it put machismo, ego, pride, good looks, good clothes all into
perspective. You get to realise the hollowness of all that and it rattles
you. It's dangerous for a society that draws its kids into materialism, it's
threatening. I think it goes a lot deeper than Ecstasy. It is a vision of a
trouble-free yob-free society, but they feel threatened by these five
million kids who they can't do anything with. Their tricks don't work any
more. We've got the means for a celebration dance and they can't deny that
there's a returned sense of community in what we do. Not just at raves -
we're trying to spread it into the rest of our lives too, weekends are not
enough.

Exodus began in June 1992. They have provided a roof for homeless people in
a once derelict building, Haz Manor, and set up a community farm. Glenn
described how the impact of Exodus on local people has been much more than
simply providing parties:

We've got our own heart beat, we've got our own moral economy, it's much
more moral than theirs because it's not about exploiting each other. Haz
Manor has been built on the same principle. There might be trade but trade's
different from exploitation  making a living is different from making a
killing. I don't know why they can't see we're their dream come true because
we're not asking for handouts, were saying we're able to help ourselves. I
think they feel threatened by it simply because when you put a diamond in a
pile of shit, you know it's shit.

We're not revolutionaries, we're freedom fighters. The Criminal Justice Act
is about freedom to make profit, freedom to build roads without people
interfering, freedom to siphon people into pubs and clubs rather than fields
and churches. That is why it is heavily sponsored by the Tory party.
Underlying it all, they fear rave culture because it's an anarchist culture.

When Exodus parties are running there is a 40% drop in trade in the town's
pubs. Exodus is convinced the brewery's influence over the local newspapers
has been the cause of the negative image they portray of the collective.
Further than this, a public enquiry has been called into allegations of
police misconduct. Journalist Tim Malyon wrote the following piece to
demonstrate the extent the authorities are prepared to go in order to stop
this revolution:

The Trials of Exodus

On New Years eve 1992/3 Exodus held its largest party with ten thousand
people present. Two weeks later it supported the squatted occupation of a
derelict hotel and started channelling money from the collections and soft
drink stalls at the dances into squat renovation. Exodus is a force for the
good, bringing hope, joy and community where before there was desolation.
But some police officers saw a different picture. Chief Inspector Mike Brown
cooperated with Exodus in helping make venues safe and trying to locate
legal venues, until his superiors at force headquarters blew the whistle.

A series of massive police operations ensued, costing over 103,000, on the
squatted hotel, on Exodus' Long Meadow Community Farm, and on the pre-dance
assembly point. Thirty one criminal charges arose out of these operations
for which there was just one conviction, itself highly dubious. The charges
served to paint a devilish picture of Exodus.

After the hotel eviction police officers are alleged to have copied into
their notebooks crucial information written on a blackboard by a sergeant at
Luton Police Station. This was used as evidence in order to procure public
order convictions and convictions against collective members arrested for
alleged violence and abuse. In another trial arising out of an earlier raid
on the hotel, at least 13 police officers failed to produce their pocket
notebooks after being ordered to do so by the trial judge, causing cases to
be dismissed. Could it have been because they contained lies?

Then there was an alleged drugs find. During a raid by more than 100
officers on the Exodus farm, Ecstasy worth 2,200 was found in Paul Taylor's
bag. Taylor is a prominent black member of the collective, one of those
responsible for forging the black/white union which is the bedrock of
Exodus' power for the good. The house had already been searched once by
Luton Drugs Squad who had failed to find drugs in an obvious place for which
Taylor could be held personally responsible. Police admit Taylor had ample
forewarning of the raid, so could easily have removed the drugs if they were
his. After Luton Drugs Squad had finished their search, an officer from
force headquarters entered the darkened house, spent thirteen minutes inside
it, then called in another officer and took two minutes to lead him to the
drugs in the bag. At Taylor's trial, the defence barrister summed up, "This
case stinks, it stinks of a plot." Taylor was found not guilty.

During the trial the head of Luton drugs squad admitted to a serious
disciplinary complaint, involving mishandling of the drugs. It was also
alleged that there was a rogue cache of drugs at Luton police station,
origin and destiny unknown. The Bedfordshire Deputy Chief Constable, despite
his reputation as a strict disciplinarian, failed to take action after any
of the Exodus cases. Nobody has been disciplined, not for the 'missing'
notebooks, not for the blackboard incident, not for the drugs.

All three political parties on Bedfordshire County Council, as well as the
Police Authority have now voted for a public enquiry to be chaired by
Michael Mansfield QC into "Bedfordshire Police and others' activities"
against Exodus. A retired police inspector told me before he was gagged from
talking to the press: "Licensed premises were experiencing a fair amount of
loss of trade, loss of customers. Some licensees were starting to get into
real financial trouble." He added not only that alcohol-related offences
dropped when Exodus put on dances, but also that political pressure was
being brought to bear on the police by local members of Parliament to get on
the case.

Luton is a brewery town. Whitbread have dominated it for many years.
Hopefully Mansfield's public inquiry will find out who was really
responsible for trying to destroy this movement, a movement which is
transforming the lives of thousands of Bedfordshire's youth.

How can we keep the scene from being sold-out?

This is a big worry of mine, every scene eventully is digested by
corporate/profit intrests.  For -example Hip Hop ("Beat Street) and
Rap(Vanilla Ice and MC Hammer).  What I 'm talking about is a scene not
played out because of quick profit intrests.  How can we prevent this!!?? 
I'm already starting to see events where they blatantly lie on the flyer
about how long the event will last or about "goodies" which never show up
(not that you realy need them).  We need more events like Harmony or F&F,
to name a few.  Everyone likes to make a couple of extra bucks, but it cant
be at the price of honesty and integrity, once that starts happening raves
will start looking like Vegas side shows (Cyberfest).  But until then I'll
enjoy it while it's still around and I got the energy!!!!

I dont mean to sound to negative, but I think this is important to talk
about and this list seems like a good place.

See Ya

"Starting?"  I've seen stuff like this since 1992, and it hasn't "killed" 
the "scene" yet.  Promises of DJs who were never actually even booked, 
promises of lasers that never appeared, promises of going a certain number 
of hours and then getting closed down because the party wasn't making enough 
money, etc etc.

Remember, it's hard to kill something that doesn't physically exist.  Good 
parties exist because good people exist who like to put them on.  As you 
said, Harmony and F&F are good examples, as was the killer CDC party I went 
to at Richmond back in January.  

Cyberfest is an aberration, don't worry so much :-)  And if you are worried, 
then hook up with the good people surrounding you and keep supporting them 
by either being a regular at their events or actually helping to put the 
events on.  

Raves started "looking like Vegas with sideshows" years ago.  1993 was a 
particularly big year on the east cost for things of that ilk.  But as you 
can see, two years later, good events are going strong.

Imports on Wed. and domestics on Friday, from what I remeber. They never
seem to be too great for import vinyl, as everything seems to be sold out
the day after it comes in. They do have one of the best used sections in
the bay area, however.

And hey, they're in Berkeley!

part of keeping the scene true is keeping true to yourself.  I havent 
paid more than $10 to go to a party for almost two years as a promise to 
myself that I wouldn't support parties that are *big business*.  I've 
been tempted many times to break that promise but I don't and its hard 
when all your friends may be going to a big party and want you to 
come...but the people that have listened to what I had to say and 
contemplated eventually have told me that usually (but not always) the 
bigger parties they go to turn out to be something different than they 
were looking for...bascially if you like smaller parties and people who 
go to tparties for to share themselves/help create a special 
place/vibe/atmosphere/world then go to parties like F&F, Harmony, 
Frequency 8, Lettuce Dance, Justice League, Liquid, Gateway Systems, 
Trust, and the Cloud Factory ;), and many others...the fact is in San 
Francisco we are blessed 
with one of the most solid underground scenes in the world right now!!!
Take advantage of it and support it!!!!

So,  if you don't like house,  then get yourself a pair of 1200's,  a
generator,  and a sound system and put on your OWN Happy Hardcore rave.
But PLEASE let me know when and where it will be,  because I wanna go to
it as well,  so I can dance my ass off...   I can also turn you onto a
source for Happy Hardcore (In Ausralia).

We need more Happy Hard in SF,   we just don't have a big enough group of
people to put one on.

There will always be people who can only see and are only attracted to the
glimmering lights and shiny objects that float on the surface.  Those who
know that the true force of the current lies beneath will be there in the
flow.  I believe that the best that any one of us can do is to lead by
example and to develop an awareness of ourselves and the landscape in which
we travel.  The kinds of events that I've truly enjoyed and have gotten the
most out of are events that are formed on the "grass roots" level.  With
everyone contributing to make things happen.  Everyone dealing with each
other from a parallel  perspective as opposed to an heirarchal one.  All
easier said than done for this goes counter to a lot of conditioning that
our society and culture imposes upon us. Never the less, it is a lot easier
than one would be led to believe as well.

Peace!

You're missing the point if you think adding happy hardcore is the
solution to the lack of music diversity.  The keyword is "other than,"
which means a variety of styles and sounds.

Of course,   I wasn't just referring to Happy Hard.   You're right,  we
should have other forms of music as well.    Hard Trance,  Jungle,  and
even (heaven forbid) Gabber.

I had an absolutely fantastic time at Tribal Future.
How does one create a raver's paradise?  It helps if you start out with
the Garden of Eden, which is the only way to describe the beautiful
property owned by Allen's Uncle in the Mendecino Mountains, less
than 3 hours from the city.  Sprinkle the site with exotic sculptures, 
colorful banners, fountains, hot tubs, fireplaces, and christmas lights.
Throw in a communal kitchen, caring hosts, and an abundance of vibeful
people for an atmosphere of free expression, fun, and tribal unity.  And 
don't forget a kick-ass Wicked sound system and a slew of inspired DJs 
continuously pumping out loads and loads of great music. 

It was very warm in the sunlight, but cold in the starlight which kept a
lot of people around the fires in the evening.  I wasn't bothered by the
cold at all, especially during Garth's fantastic 3 hour set.  Actually, 
everyone had great sets; Fred, Ethan, Tracy, Carlos, and a bunch of others
I didn't recognize. (Does anyone have the complete lineup?)  Besides
Garth, the other standout set for me was Pollywog's 3 hour eclectic 
stew of noisy, dubby weirdness that included some Jungle and stuff that
I can't even begin to categorize. 

We left on Sunday at 3pm and missed some more good stuff I'm sure, but
we were more than satisfied with the 24 hours spent there.

Much thanks to Mark, Allen and his gracious Uncle for one of the best 
gatherings I've ever been to. It really was much more than a "rave"
or a party.  It was proof once again that the scene really can function
as a mini community or tribe, at least on occasion.  Tribal Future gave 
us a sense of belonging to a special family of people that represent
many of the ideals that raving attempts to aspire to.  Can't wait for
the next one.

I am truly tired of trollers, and lame ass baiters.  If it's not that 
then it's the continuing repetition of history that plagues this list.

Get a clue Mohsen, and all others who have ANY problem with SF:
If you want to create more diversity, then there is nothing stopping YOU 
from doing it.  RULE #1!


If you want to go to a hardcore party, then create one.  Same goes for 
Full Moons, Half Moons, and Half Baked Pies as well as Ideas.  GO FOR 
IT!  RULE #2!


You don't like circle dancers?  Don't go where they dance.  Start a party 
called PLUNCiD (Peace, Love, Unity, No, Cirle, Dancers).  RULE #3.


As a matter of fact, with all the complaints and noise surrounding what's 
not being played, there should be plenty of people who want to hear what 
you want, so you have a base right there.  If you remain true to the 
game, in time they will tire of hardcore and complain about the lack of 
diversity in music in the hardcore scene...whatever.


Point is, we've gone thru this shit over, and over, and ovwer on this 
list.  120 bpm versus 580 bpm.  WHO CARES?  I don't!  Neither do many 
others, I would even suggest the majority.  Either you're well on your 
way to finding that which caters to you, or you're well on your way to 
create that which suits you.  If you're complaining about the lack of 
something, and not doing anything to change it, you're wasting my time, 
as well as everyone elses.  Get a posse together, even if it may be a 
posse of one, and do something about your choices!

Same thing goes for 18+ parties, same thing goes for no smoking events, 
same thing goes for no-booze, samer thing goes for benders, same thing 
goes for hardcore, jungle, 140bpm++ stuff, same thing goes for  
everything.  DIY, DIY, DIY!

Now, can the discussion move from what SF is lacking, to what you're 
doing to make SF lack less?  Thank you!

BTW - Draper, I agree 100% with what you said.  And If I got the message 
of Draper's message I fail to see why you or anyone else did not.

Scientific Paper to follow.

Hey goodfolk,
	
	This is a rather provocative thread.  Long live good discussion!
	I figured I might as well throw my hat into the ring.
	I can't help but wonder how long it will take that other 
corporate entity, Hollywood, to pick up on the mystique of the rave scene 
in an attempt to capitalize on yet another alterna-hip subculture... 
I can see it now, some hellish money-making behemoth-amalgam of Saturday 
Night Fever and Kids.  Starring: Leonardo diCaprio as Smiley, Christina Ricci 
as Fluffles, Tom Hanks as DJSlipshot, and Brad Pitt as the Evil Dealer.  
	Hmmmm..... now that I think about it, those Hollywood dogs are pretty 
smart, so they just might cast no-names in an attempt to disguise the 
film as an indy.  Feh.  I'll rue the day.

Thanks to everyone who responded to my first post on a new time slot for 
Flux. Unfortunately the 10:30PM slot that everyone recommended has 
fallen through. My partner and I are in a heated argument about which of 
the following airtimes would be best:

Friday Midnight
Tuesday Midnight
Thursday Midnight

I tend to lean towards Friday airtime because it is the one night everyone 
is up that late for sure, and if the go out you could set your VCR. My 
partner thinks that is bogus and insists Tuesday is better.

We leave to SFRAVES to settle this dispute once and for all. Thanks for 
your input. -Jonathan

i'm with you john. there is no way we can grow as a community through 
mindless complaints. but with constructive criticism, an open mind to all 
kinds of music (which doesn't mean you have to like it all) and tastes, 
and most of all sharing and doing your best to support and create what 
you love best... we can expand together and evolve into something unique, 
complex and unified.

my last message for weeks... tomorrow i'm east coast-bound.

as i was doing nothing at my job today (true, although i wish it were
otherwise), a few thoughts came to me that i'd like to share with all. here's
one: a sfraves potluck/joydance/gathering of the tribe. i'm not sure about
the where, when and the how, but the technicalities aren't obstables unless
we think of them as such. 
 
the potluck idea was in my head because i just hosted an enchanted potluck
last sunday at my house. five social circles touched and, for at least a few
hours, merged. it was wonderful. 

being relatively new to the List, almost all of your faces are unknown to me.
that's another reason i thought of helping to host a gathering of the tribe. 

anyway, this is just one of the many ideas that's been bubbling in my
champagne glass.

about keeping our rave culture safe from the vultures of commercialism, i
think awareness is the answer. awareness of self. awareness of community,
real community. awareness of the shearing forces at work on us 24/7:
heartless, profit-driven industrialization, institutionalized reactionary
fear... you know what i mean. as long as we know in our hearts what it is
that gives us real strength and clean power, the flashy-feathered
commercial-cults won't have any point of entry.

we help each other, teach each other, learn from each other. when something
feels wrong, we tell each other and try not to experience that again. and
when something goes right, really right, brother and sister, we do it again
and again... 
                                                            and again...





                                                                          and
again...  

i've lost my thread. the post "Free parties DIY culture (long)" addresses
this issue periphally. [incidentally, it is well worth the read.]  it speaks
of a consciousness-centered community of british ravers and celeberants
called Exodus who are working to improve their town and nation as best they
can.

maybe that's the answer to safegaurding our community from commercialization:
work on community-development. las vagas and hollywood would never touch
that. if you read the post, you'll have a better understanding of what i'm
saying. [to whomever forwarded it, big thank you.]

anyway, i've rambled long enough. since i'm going to be gone for two weeks,
i'm going to <unsubscribe sfraves> for a while. but my "disssolve" account
will reamin active, so send any ideas you might have to me personally, if you
want me to read them. 

with a flower raised aloft, 
grinning wide,
and tapping toe to transcendent tunes,

Hello,
    I have much to say on this, but also have much school work to do, 
so I will try to keep it short...

    Of course! Each and every one of us should support the parties that 
we think should get it. If you are worried about the scene becoming a 
circus side-show, then don't support those parties. Personally, when 
ever there is a new party coming out I usually go and see what the 
promoters are trying to do with their expressions. That is what I think 
throwing parties is all about, (at least to us). For us, it isn't how 
many people can we get?, or how can we make money?, it is how can we 
express our personal vibe to the raving community? Harmony, is a way 
for us to communicate with the scene. We can get our ideas out, and 
have a blast doing it!!! The other alternative (at least for me) is to 
support the many other parties that are doing good for the scene, (at 
least when I am not overloaded with school :).

speaking of keeping a positive scene going. i really need help.
im trying to put together a positive gathering in the 600 people range, 
for $5 a person, in the tradition of F&F, for positive energy and unity 
between a group of people scattered across the bay.
after having everything worked out, i lost the ability to use the 
location i had in mind.
im not trying to compete with F&F or anything, cuz competition kills our 
scene. (actually i was going to have ethen and joe rice spin, and some 
others help out,too)
so it comes down to all of us lending a hand to one another, and i really 
need help finding a location.
any leads or suggestions will make a great difference.(im having serious 
trouble finding a new one)
please help if you can.
positive energy: tom

OK, first off hello everyones.

I 've been incognito for a while but I'm glad to report that I'm safe and
alive and somewhat (in)saner than usual. But I diverge from the topic at
hand....

I've been readin' the "True Scene" posts and decieded to say what I feel (as
I believe we all should).  
To me, the scene will always stay true. I remember the hoopla of 92' and 93
and remember it virtually disapearing (for me) last year.  I truly think that
it's not the scene that waxes and wanes but ones perception of it...   Your
scene is what you make it.  If you stay informed then you'll always have a
place to go to. If you "fall out" of 'the circle' then you be as ignorant to
the vibe train as the countless other newbies and new-to-be ravers.  Hell, I
even think the term "rave" is passe now. I see everyone calling them
"events", gaterings, renegades etc al.  (pls. refer to "Pop Quiz" post).  The
scene changes and we must change with it.... I know 'events' that aren't
posted onto hyperreal. and respect them.  I know of soundsystems that believe
SFR is too good enuff for them (Translation: They think they suck) and
respect that too. In time I know they'll turn around.

Do you remember X-parties?  I recall, years ago, calling a few(4-5) of my
friends and telling em that I was spinning some new stuff @ my house, and to
drop by if they wanted to hear it...  3hrs later my garage would be housing
20-30 people, most X'ed out saying things like "good party dude".  Party?
Scene?  Again the scene is what you make it....

I enjoyed helping out the F8 crew, come dawn luggung the equip. up the crazy
cliffs (and believe me they ARE crazy cliffs, I have the scars to prove it).
Cos it brings the scene closer to me.
Helping out SPAZ was the same way as well as helping you out, dear raver (or
whatever you wish to call yourself nowadays), for rides to and fro, moving
ect...
So well that's my input and well, Im really antsy to go dancing (haven't been
on the dance floor in a week and a half).  So I hope ta see some of yer
smiliey faces at Roots 2morrow.

Spins,
Adam

Hollywood already tried, and it failed.  Back in 1993 there was a movie 
set in the rave scene (New York) called _Cyberstrom_.  It starred 
Christina Applegate (of "Married with Children") as a raver who supported 
herself by selling jewelry at parties.

I never saw it (it was a huge flop), but I'm told that the story involved 
some guy who was a reclusive engineer type becoming homeless due to some 
evil plot and going to sleep in a warehouse...he wakes up in the middle of 
a rave, meets Applegate, and the two join forces to strike back against 
the evil plot that got him where he was.  In the process, Applegate and 
her happy raver friends teach him how to love, have fun, and not be such a 
recluse.

So, once again, don't worry so much...to tell the truth, rave-as-fad has 
come and gone.  And if you are worried, just keep hooking up with people 
who you like, trust, and know can provide an honest good time.

     Wow, talk about a blast from the past...
     
     The second party I ever DJed at was thrown by these people.  It was a 
     REALLY fun time.  The held it in one of those indoor paint ball/laser 
     tag places.  We even had a Vrave hook up, and Markie from Wicked 
     happened to be on the other end of it (in San Francisco) when I looked 
     in to see who was there.
     
     It's nice to see that Duncan is still going strong in Charlottesville.
     
     To tie this back to something that is actually relavant to SFRaves:  
     here is yet another example of a good group of people doing good 
     parties.  Duncan has been doing Wiggle and associated events for about 
     two and a half years now.  Further proof that the "scene" is not 
     "dying" "selling out" or anything like that.  Believe it:  you all 
     have achieve what you wanted -- something stable that keeps going on 
     and on.  Each individual might not be 100% satisfied with what *is* 
     going on at any particular point, but that's not the point of this 
     post.

How can we keep the scene "true?"

You can't. 

Since everyone is different, each person has a different idea of what a
"true" scene consists of. The only way to approach reconciling all of those
ideas is for people to start giving up aspects of their image of a true
scene until the lowest common denominator is agreeable to everyone.
Unfortunately, the aspects given up by one person are held near and dear to
others and vice-versa.

You've got to be kidding. Ben Hom is a major *MAJOR* asshole. Rather
that taking starchild's patently bogus advice, you all should have
heard some of BH's pathetic answers at that recent mayoral "debate". If
the man has a brain, he gave no indication he makes any use of it. He's
an idiot -- gives shallow answers to deep questions, and doesn't even
realize that some questions exceed the depths of his pockets.

Read some of his literature. Oh, you make less than $200K/year? He
ain't interested in you. You're not an entrepreneur or small business
owner -- he ain't interested in you. You like to do anything that will
make it difficult for businesses to operate (e.g. protests, sit-ins,
being up past midnight (because you'll be too strung out for the
boss-man to be whipping your ass when you get in to make him rich when
your work day begins at 8AM).)

Like JSL said, Ben Hom is strictly about business. He isn't interested
in "us" in any way shape or form. He wants to separate you the people
from your money, and make sure that money ends up in the hands of the
friends to which he'll dole out "privatization" boondoggles...

Privatization is a joke. In the moneyocracy that we're now running in,
we get those currently in power to set up their friends or family to
take over running a governent service as a business. But rather than
being responsive to the customer, the new privatized business is only
responsive to political forces that set them up in the first place.

Meanwhile the privatized business empowers those friends/family with
money and clout to continue lobbying the govt to let them continue
running and profiting from a government-funneled business. This further
empowers the new wealthy owners of privatized businesses with more
capital and contacts by which they can bribe politicians to allow them
to further expand their business. (The #1 imperative of business is
unchecked growth -- well past the point of need -- and unchecked
amalgamation of power. So don't be surprised when the privatized
services become an uncontrollable force that becomes a corrupt little
mini-government on it's own. (General Electric, or Westinghouse for
example.))

People like to tout the wonderfulness of "competition" involved in
privatization, but they never take a deeper look into the politics of
privatization, which are easily more corrupt than anything a
centralized government service could come up with (the ability to "buy"
gaggles of full-time lobbyists, the ability to "buy" politicians with
gifts, bribes, campaign contributions, etc.). You see, there's not that
much money in local government, therefore not that much power, nor
motivation for people to grab more power. By tapping into private
capital and mixing that into public government structures, that's when
you tap into the real power that can properly destabilize democracy.
(note the truism that power==money)... 

Give me a centralized organization with proper checks and balances over
privatization any day of the week. Give me businesses hamstrung by rules
and regulations over unchecked competition.

Oh, and if you doubt me, please take a look at our "privatized"
military-industrial complex, or our privatized energy industry. Yeah,
there's a bastion of competition and efficiency.

And unless you're a raving libertarian idiot, please don't vote for Ben
Hom.

Hey, I'm going to be off the list for a while
(undetermined period)- If any of you want to 
reach me, please feel free to call home
408 264 5474

sorry if this is a reiterative post, but I never received the
one I sent yesterday- so I'm resending.

Also, a friend of mine (Carol Lembcke), who works for 
FOR the Animals and BAN, sent me the following about 
stopping the proposed nuclear dump in Ward Valley. A note 
too about the area- it's 18 miles from the Colorado river,

Subject: Stop Nuclear Dump - URGENT
          Date:
                                                                     10/25/95

Hello all-

Several weeks ago, I sent you all email about a proposed Nuclear Waste Dump
site to be constructed in Ward Valley in the east Mojave Desert.  

It is with a great sadness in my heart that I must convey to you that in spite
of many months and much hard work by environmentalist, Secretary of the
Interior, Bruce Babbitt, announced on Monday his *definite* intention to
transfer the Federally Preserved land of Ward Valley to Gov. Wilson so that
construction of the dump may begin.   

WHAT YOU CAN DO!  Please now more then ever your voice could make a
difference...use it...speak!

Please call Sen. Feinstein at 415-536-6868.  Calls must be received TODAY in
order for her to take action in time.

Let your voice be heard...let it say that dumping HIGH and LOW level Nuclear
Waste in Ward Valley is UNACCEPTABLE!  Please don't let this pristine land
become a painful festering wound that will harm us all.  

Thank you for choosing to make a difference.  My original post with all the
background on this dump is below for reference.  Please pass this post on to
anyone who can help.

Peace, Love and Understanding - now more then ever!
Carol 


ORIGINAL POST REGARDING WARD VALLEY
     
A Proposed Nuclear Waste Dump to be constructed in Ward Valley.
     
BACKGROUND
Ward Valley is located 22 miles west of Needles, CA in the beautiful East 
Mojave desert.  Plans are to bury long-lasting and highly dangerous 
radioactive wastes from nuclear power plants in shallow, unlined trenches 
above an aquifer and just 18 miles from the Colorado River.  Ward Valley is 
located directly adjacent to the new Mojave National Preserve and is 
surrounded by five wilderness areas.  Area Indian tribes consider Ward Valley 
sacred homeland and Ward Valley is critical habitat for the threatened Desert 
Tortoise.  Secretary of the Interior, Bruce Babbitt has announced his 
intention to transfer the land at Ward Valley to the state of CA.  Once 
Governor Wilson gets hold of the land construction of the dump could begin 
within a few months.
     
ACTION BEING TAKEN
I will be in Ward Valley as a representative on my own organization, For the 
Animals, along with Greenpeace, BAN, California Communities Against Toxics 
among others, to let Mr. Babbitt and Gov. Wilson know that dumping toxic 
waste in California or anywhere on mother earth is NOT acceptable.
     
WHAT YOU CAN DO
If you would like me to deliver a message on your behalf or if you would like 
to make a donation to assist in this demonstration, please get it to me 
before this Friday.   Or you may call BAN directly at 415-752-8678.
     
Thanks for doing what you can for mother earth.  PLEASE SPREAD THE WORD! 
Carol

I found this in AusRaves,  relating to another death from "e".
Which in my experience,  Ausralian E is always mixed with other crap,
and never known to be pure MDMA.

I would be very appreciative if anyone could send me ideas or information 
on how I could obtain some tickets to F&F.  I drove all the way
from Sacramento to Ameba to find that all of their tickets were sold.

I want to show some unbelieving friends that the rave scene is 
worthwhile.  
I think that this F&F party just might be the one to bring them to.
If only I had tickets...

Love,
Matt

on a related note:

KGO 810 reported this morning that the FDA was looking into the 'Herbal Ecstasy' 
stuff being sold in stores and advertised as being safe. They quoted some
doc saying "no,no, this stuff is bad, it raises cardio-somethingorother,
gives you artythmis***, and is baad.".

The newsman then said, at least 12 people have died and aobut 350 "injured"
as a result of taking E this year, in the US.

Harsh mentions:

>'Herbal Ecstasy' 
>stuff being sold in stores and advertised as being safe. 

When "herbal ecstacy" first appeared, my friend Mark went to talk to the person 
selling it to find out what was in it so he'd know what he'd be getting into.

*The personal selling it wouldn't say, not even in general terms.*

This is not good.  Some people have sensitivities to "safe" things -- even as 
well-known as aspririn or caffiene -- and should not use them in any form.  So, 
it stands to reason that there could be things in "herbal ecstacy" that 
individuals could be sensitive to, also.  I find it very irresonsible on the 
part of the "herbal ecstacy" manufacturers/resellers that they wouldn't reveal 
what was in it.  

Their argument was that they didn't want to divulge their secret formula, but 
that doesn't seem valid when you consider that someone taking it might be very 
sensitive to Kola (something we guessed that might be in it, based on the taste 
and smell of the powder) and get irregular heartbeat from the stimulation.

I haven't looked at a label for "herbal ecstacy" lately, so *hopefully* this 
policy of secrecy has changed...can someone tell me for sure?

Personally, I think "herbal ecstacy" is a load of snake oil...if we knew what 
was in it we could whip up our own for a LOT cheaper by visiting the local Whole
Foods or Chinese herbalist.  Mark suspected that there was Mau Haung, Ginseng, 
Kola, and some Betel Nut in it.

Is Betel nut legal in the US? If so, where can it be obtained? 
I miss betel nut since my travels in India and Thailand. It's kinda
interesting, and it makes yer teeth all red and stumpy if ya do
to much of it. Much cooler than having blue lips from a tootsie pop.

Supposedly, herbal ecstasy is illegal in Canada. 

So, for my trip(sic) down to SF I was hoping to find out more about it.
Sorry if I'm treading on old ground but I'd like to ask the following
questions...Has any body had any bad experiences with it?  Does it feel like
the real thing? How expensive is it? Where do you get it?   

If there is a link on the web to the above info then just mail me. 

Talking about alternatives to X,  I remember several months back some
postings in regards to legal pharmaceuticals; vasopressin, ketamine(i
think?), etc.  I went looking for that stuff here in British Columbia and
the health food stores said that they are illegal. But, they said that it
was legal in the US.  Is this true??  

Again, since I will be visiting, I would like to look into some of this
stuff.  Could somebody send some info or, at least, a web link.

Thanks in advance.

Hello everybody!!

3 days left til I touch down in the city of streetcars, the Golden Gate, the
Haight, Berkeley and sfravers!!!

My plans have more or less come together as follows:
Sat:
  *3:00(pm)- land in SF 
  *4:00(pm)- ???
  *11:30(pm)- go to F&F.  (Yes!! I got a ticket!!)
  
Sun:
  *12:01(am)- proceed to party at mind numbing pace
  *6:00(am)-  collapse into bed  
  *6:05(am)-  dream of translucent iceburgs with a trance backbeat
  *12:01(pm)- wake up and say "hello San Fran"
  *1:00(pm)-  drift over to the Haight/Berkeley area, hangout and browse.
  
Mon:
  *all day - Conference stuff
  *11:30(pm)- Bahia Cabana (only $3)
  
Tue: 
  *all day - Conference stuff

Wed:
  *all day - Conference stuff
  *3:00(pm) - Get on plane and proceed to cry "goodbye San Fran", all the
way home.

Thurs-Sat:
  *Gloat about SF to my buds back home who couldn't make it.


Thanks to everybody that has sent me info about where to shop, visit and
which party to go to, etc. Could any interested parties tell me what they
will be wearing at F&F so I can say a warm "hello, eh".  I will be wearing
the orange t-shirt that has a cartoon picture of a guy's face.  Black jeans.  

Oh by the way, on Saturday, anybody out there got room in their vehicle for
a guy who doesn't know the town and will probably be taken for a literal
ride to Oakland and God knows where is??  

Thanks in advance

ive never had a bad experience on it except i do tend to feel a little sick
because i dont do well with those wierd herbal things...they kind of fuck
with my stomach...its not a real e but in my experience its been worth it
to keep up and keep out of the whole lying in a heap in the corner
experience...a lot less confusion, but not THAT much ecstasy either...its
kinda like ephedrine...its five bucks a "hit" and you might need more than
one...you get it at raves, although i usually see it a lot more often at
bigger events, its called cloud 9 or herbal bliss...what ive tried is the
bliss...they also sell it at some "raver" stores or sex shops and i wager
its probably more expensive there...


 vasopressin, ketamine(i think?), etc.  I went looking for that stuff here
in British Columbia and
>the health food stores said that they are illegal. But, they said that it
>was legal in the US.  Is this true??
 vasopressin is considered a smart drug which is illegal here but available
through mail order from england...ketamine or special k is a from of animal
tranquilizer favored by new york club kids...legal for vetrinarians, my
friend...but not for you.

i think thats it...if any of this info is wrong, please dont hesitate to
correct me...

Hollywood already tried, and it failed.  Back in 1993 there was a movie 
set in the rave scene (New York) called _Cyberstrom_.  It starred 
Christina Applegate (of "Married with Children") as a raver who supported 
herself by selling jewelry at parties.

I never saw it (it was a huge flop), but I'm told that the story involved 
some guy who was a reclusive engineer type becoming homeless due to some 
evil plot and going to sleep in a warehouse...he wakes up in the middle of 
a rave, meets Applegate, and the two join forces to strike back against 
the evil plot that got him where he was.  In the process, Applegate and 
her happy raver friends teach him how to love, have fun, and not be such a 
recluse.

So, once again, don't worry so much...to tell the truth, rave-as-fad has 
come and gone.  And if you are worried, just keep hooking up with people 
who you like, trust, and know can provide an honest good time.

as far as i can tell from myself, its caffine. say for example you drink 
around 30 Cokes, it would produce the same effect. if i ever get 
something that makes me too wired, say like drinking 4 mochas or 
something, i start grinding my teeth, as well as a few other things, such 
as my body needs to rest, but i cant. my eyes are dialated...and im sure 
that lots of people experiance this. so, its up to you, you can buy the 
herbal e and see how it feels, or buy the real stuff and have more fun. 
if all you want is something speedy, then just take some no doze and a 
few sodas and some esspresso, smoke a lot of cigs, and hey, you got 
herbal e!

Okay, this pissed me off more than anything in the article.  I don't want to
get back into the whole beer vs. drugs thing, but it's hipocracy like this
that I find so incredibly absurd.  It's okay to celebrate with a nice, legal
drug (although he doesn't seem to recognize it as such, which is another
plague of the world), but _not_ with those bad illegal ones.  And of course
beer is safer, because governments only have the people's best interests in
mind.  They don't care about making money or anything like that...

God, I hope 20 years from now I don't think I'm right by virtue of the fact
that I'm older and _obviously_ wiser.

Peeved,
Jake

Subject: Vasopressin & herbal E
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com

Regarding these two:
Vasopressin is definitely a smart drug.  I can't remember exactly what it
does, but I recall from my reading it is one of the more interesting ones.
I think it comes in a spray bottle and you inhale it nasally every few
hours, but I could be mixing it up with something else.  Can anyone help me
out with this?

As far as ketamine goes:  It's pretty strong, from what I've read.  Only try
it in a safe environment with people you trust, at least at first.  I've
never tried it, but it's up there with things like scopalamine.  About the
only drug that's readily available that has similar effects is DXM, found in
several brands of over-the-counter cough syrup.  Basically the same effects
but not as pronounced.  More than anything, it's a narcotic (although it's
sometimes called a dissociative).  Note on the cough syrup thing:  since
I've mentioned it I should say that if you were planning on doing this, DO
NOT do it until you've read up on it.  DXM is very safe, but the other
ingredients many times are not.  Make sure you get something with only DXM
in it.  A lot of the other things, like psuedoephedrine and some
antihistamines, could kill you in large doses.

Well, generally it's a mix of several herbs, predominately ma hung, also
known as ephedra (a natural form of ephedrine).  So esentially it's more
like "herbal speed."  And for those of you who have tried it you know that
it feels a lot more like speed than E.  It also contains ginseng, ginko,
gotu kola, kola nut and other common herbs sold in health food stores, just
in much larger amounts.  It is quite possible that many people can have
adverse reactions to any of these.  Ma hung accelerates heart rates a lot,
so of course there's danger in that, and many people have allergic reactions
to Kola nut especially.  It is known to induce heart attacks in some people,
even in small doses.  I know that I personally have some kind of reaction to
one of these; I have some ginseng and ginko vitamins that contain some of
these herbs, and occasionally, depending on what I've just eaten, it causes
me to get red, flushed, hot, and itchy.  Not pleasant.

Hope that all helps.

Vasopressin is also legal, but by prescription only. It is sometimes 
prescribed to Alzheimer patients.

here is the DJ order as I recall
4-5 Nathan played and I wasn't there...
5-7pm sat-Dan Barnes : trancy... he actually went up with the sound the 
night before and hadn't slept so he definately earned his slot.
7-8:30 the dinner slot by Phred: as we dined on Pasta Veggie Gulosh cooked 
by Dana and Harbin's new convert Eddie (picked from the garden)
8:30 - 10:30 Phil  this guy played acid houce and every body was like "who's 
the dj?" and I asked Garth and he said  " I don't know but It's Funky!"
10:30 -12:00  Ethan played an Acid Trance set and on the Wicked System it 
was the first time he had heard it and he played on it as the party really 
started to get Psychedelic (his car was broken and his kid asleep).
12-2  Tracy played a set which  we are already making money on!
2 -4 Garth played a full set of Funky High Energy Cold Fighting ...
When a Wicked Dj gets on the Turbo Sound Sure Sympathizes.
4-6am Carlos Hurtled in as the last arrival straight from NY city and then to 
Spundaes after. His energy was Fabulous. And his set was Smooth. 
6:00-7:30: Kelly played a set during which I was Hallucinating and trying to 
step on my trails of my foot prints. I had some kind of Tribal Dance 
revelation during this.
7:30 - 8 : Andrew Rawnsley played some House which he highly alters with 
mixer tricks like no one.. where did he learn this?
8:-9:30 : Andrew : I slept and heard good things but I know It was good 
because no one disturbed me.
9:30am - 12 POLYWOG played a set which rivaled the last time she played 
Willits (Penelope's Web)... ambient kitch?
12:-1:30 I tryed my best to follow the person who influenced my dj career 
most. I actually beat - matched 2 records.
1:30-2:30  Alex the newest Jungle Champion who kicked as records and Vibe 
and (mark broke a Piniada to jungle)
2:30 - 4:00 Galen started the official Sunset part of the rave and it was 
N..I...C..E as it could be!!!!
4:00- I left at dark Solar playing the endless good vibe Indian Summer and I 
was So relaxed at this point.... 3 hot tubs help...

massage table, like around 6pm, and/or if it's in Oaktown or SF, I'm just 
gonna take a cab provided I get paid either Thursday or Friday. If 
neither happens I won't be able to make it, cause I have no money for 
clean linens or massage oil right now, but I'm told a check is in the mail.

	But in the mean time I would like a few people to warm up with, 
tommorroe day, it's a rare, free & wonderful opportunity to get & 
experience some of the best massage therapy(BSP), in the bay, that has 
been trained else where. Massage schools in Cali, honestly leave me sick.

	So please page me, anytime, it's for Thursday daytime only, I will
not respond to e-mail on this one, you need to use the phone & be at a
number I can get back to you at. The 1st 5 get it. 

	With regard to the party, I will be doing the 1st 10 - 15 max(this
is all my body will support), for free, that sign up, are present; in
other words standing within ear shot of my table, when it's your turn, or
the next person on the list gets it. Sorry just the results of past times
I've tried to do this, and searching becomes way to fustrating for me. 
Anyone after that I'm gonna request because it's a holiday, and I want to
have a good time too; not that I don't when I give, but it's still work,
that you pay something close to my shop rate, yes it's expensive, or do an
even trade, or some other form of bride, and I can't wear by custome 
while doing massage, you'll see why. No exceptions, and no wineing please. 

	I'm starting round 11:30, even possibly earlier, so get there when 
they open to be sure you get one if ya want one. If I clearly remember 
promising one in the past to you, I will add that one to the grand total. 
Raygun is the only person out that that I rememebr oweing a massage to 
however, opps forgot Dave.

	I know at F&F how well loved I am, I remember at past parties 
walking in and being hugged by at least 15 right off the back. The stuff 
I been through these past weeks god knows I need hugs, and really want 
them, but I ask PLEASE, PLEASE, if you see that I have my hands on 
someone, do not attempt to hug or converse with me, the space I'm in with a 
another human being on my massage table is SACRED TO ME, it's like 
breaking a pentagram, if that means anything to you. Just wait till I'm 
done, please, it's also incrediblely & more so rude to the person whom 
I'm working on, cause you take away from their massage, and I just mite 
ask people to build one around my table. In D&D when you broke a 
pentagram a Devil or Demon usually appeared pissed, and looking for your 
blood, & soul. Get IT.

its supposed to help imprint things on your memory..for example, i fyou are
going to need to read something important for you to remember, you sniff
some vasopressin and then it helps you document the information better in
your brain.  its supposed to work really well, but ive never tried

Hello everyone, I would like to introduce myself to the list.  I sent a
message 2 days ago, but it never seemed to have been put out to the list,
so I am going to type it again. :)

My name is Craig, and I have been living in New York City for the past 8
months, but I am returning to my home, which is in Harrisburg PA in a week
or two.

The reason for this message, is that I plan on going back to Harrisburg and
saving up some more money, and then in the next year (March or April
hopefully) I am planning on making the move out to San Francisco.  So, I
decided to post this message in hopes that I can start meeting some new
people and ask a few questions along the way.

I only know a few people from VRave, so I hope that this message will have
alot of you writing back to me, and hopefully we can start some sort of
contact, so when I make the move out there, that I will have some people I
have to meet, and not be all lonely. :)

The main point of this email, is that I am going to be looking for someone
to move in with when I get out there.  I want to room with someone for a
short period of time, so I can get a job, and my own place.  I know its
still a few months away, but the faster I get this sorted out, the faster
and easier this move will be.  So, if you or anyone you know would be able
to have me as a house guest for a short period of time, I would like to
hear from you.

I have a bunch of small little question I would like to ask, but I will
save that for when people write me back.  I am not sure if it is good to
send this kind of a message out to this mailing list, but I figured you
guys would be the best people to help me out..

Quick little rundown about me.   As I said, my name is Craig, and I am 20
years old.  Born in Hershey, PA, and have been a resident of NYC for the
past 8 months.  I have been DJing for a period of time now.  I spin all
kinds of music (All types of house, all types of trance (goa, soft, hard,
acid) some jungle, some gabber, some ambient.  I like everything. :)
In my time in NYC I have been working as an HTML designer, and that job
ended 2 weeks ago..

My reason for moving out there, is because I have heard the stories, and
all the stuff about the people out there, and with my type of lifestyle, I
think SF would be the place for me.

Well, I think this has letter has gotten long enough, so I look foward to
talking with you people very soon!!   Please write to me at fssc@panix.com
and I hope to hear from alot of you soon!!

Love,
Craig

Dear Craig;

	Please, when I say this don't take offense, but being a former
resident of Philadelphia, PA, and Ithaca, NY, and a former designer of
Metro-North's & Long Island Railroad's FL9-AC Locomtives, that the narrow
minded, sports are everything, blue collar depression work ethic, highest
rate of inbreeding in PA, of the back woods Appalation Mountains area that
is Harrisburg, PA. is TOXIC to ravers, as well as living in a clasic rock
music vacumn. DON'T DO IT MAN, IT WILL KILL YA, LEAVE YOU CRAZY, IN LOVE
WITH YOUR SISTER, OR JUST PLAIN MARRED FOR FUCKIN LIVE. And all the Bay 
residents think I'm kidding. Now back to our regular scheduled silliness.

Greetings =)

Just wanted to express our regrets to those of you that ended up or will
end up without tickets to Friends & Family this saturday. We had hoped we
could make some available in the east bay this week and were unfortunately
caught totally by surprise at how fast they went --  600 were gone in 48
hours! We had quite honestly thought we might have a hard time getting rid
of 600 in a week...

Too, I hope it's apparent that we made an honest effort to make tickets
available to people outside the immediate bay area. That doesn't mean we
(or you) succeeded, but we did try --  I posted mail order instructions on
the tuesday preceding the saturday on which we actually got the tickets. I
think this left *plenty* of time to get us an SASE by last saturday morning
(at which point there were still 600 left...) Strangely, I only received 3
requests that day...

In any event, when all is said and done, it's only a party, and there are
other good parties that night. So, wherever you end up, we wish you an
absolutely  wonderful time. Many thanks for your love and support.

take it easy
ethan

er uh, BrianD, I know Craig and I don't think he'll have any trouble
staying afloat in Harrisburg.  It's not the kind of place I'd like to
live in either, but actually it's fairly OK as smaller eastern cities
go and has a bit more grace than most such since it's a state cap.

We're looking forward to seeing you on the latest Raver Westward Ho!
Wagon Train, Craig :)

c u in the future

    "Keeping your VRML scenes under 100KB is an engineering challenge,
  but definitely doable," says Brian Behlendorf, chief technology officer
  with San Francisco-based Organic Online (http://www.organic.com).  VRML
  lets developers change the level of detail in a scene, so that as a user
  zooms in on an object, additional detail is downloasded from the server
  instead of being sent initially as a single large file, says Behlendorf,
  who manages the VRML mailing list on the Net.

Hello all fello sfravers!!  =)

I've been so busy w/ work I hadn't had time torespond to all yall

I was very saddend by th e selling out of tix for F&F, I had to work
Monday(every weekday) till 5 and by the time I got to the city they were gone
with the flow.
Any one wanna share???
If I can't make it to F&F does anyone have any info on CASPER this Sat.?  Who
is spinning?  etc.  I may not have enough money for FTT.   Please help..

I wasn't too turned on to the scene (hardcore) till late 94' eventhough I did
go to many earlier parties.  I found the underground this year loved the
openness and love to bestoed, however I still enjoy larger parties hear and
there because I love to watch people.  I fully agree with Drenalin(Scott)-
you hit the head on the nail...

This is all predominatly true.  I have tried herbal e a few time and never
had a bad time, however on the flip side I have never had a mind-blowing
night of uphoria, like the real thing.

Ginsig also elevates your heart level and is one of the predominat
ingredents. A friend of mine took 30 tablets of the Herbal E brand and like
speed, had the energy to be up all night and day.  He also spent most of his
time sweating even when he was sitting- a good sign your heart is pumping TOO
fast.

I independently sell products from Results Inc. and one of their products is
called New Attitude.  This is a health tonic that is a combination of 33
chinese herbs- the main being Siberian Ginsig.  I found that this product
does the same thing as herbal e but A LOT cheaper  (aprox. 35-40$ will last a
month if you took 1 tsp a day)  I also found that after a phun philled night
of groovin', movin' and partyin' this tonic provides a great recovery.   I
feel like a new man and ready to party another 24 hrs. the next day.

If any one wants more info drop me a mail or

Dear Craig;

Fred H. said you were ok, I knew that all along and never meant to or

put you in touch with the Frequency 8 people who throw our kinda rave, the

Well, Harrisburg is a place with absolutly nothing going on.  It is quite a
boring place, but its not as bad as Brain made it out to be. :)  I know of
alot of other little towns in PA and MD that are FAR worse than Harrisburg
is..  As Fred said, it is the state capitol, so it does have a little more
"grace" than the rest.

Its my easiest choice right now for saving money.  Since I would be living
with my dad when I go back, I dont need to pay for rent, so I can save alot
of money for my move to SF next spring..  (And, since I wont be living in
NYC anymore, I wont be spending $200 a week on records)

Craig

Well, I  have heard alot of great things about the place, and I must say, I
am terribly excited about moving out there.   I wish I could pick up
tomorrow and fly out there!!!  (by the way, I am sorry If I am posting
usless garbage to the list, i really dont mean it.  But I am just very very
exicted to meet you people)

Your orginal message kinda caught me off gaurd, but I understand you really
ment nothing by it, so no worries.  And I thank you for the invitation, and
as I told you I hope we can work something out..  (so nice to get this type
of a response so early!!  Maybe I will come out tomorrow!!!)

Anyway, so long..  I promise not to flood the list, seriously!!

Craig

Dear Craig;

	Ok, it is the state capitol, where you can always find a prositute
or 2. and drink Stroh's, Fire Brewed Swill to you drown in it or your own
vomit, which ever comes first, perferabily the vomit. It is better than
Pittsburg(even though I here there is actually a scene there, scary), and
definately soars over Allentown, ahh and my flond memories of the PA
Turnpike, which only riviles I-40 thur Texas for excitement & beauty. 
Then there's Philadelphia, know the city better than the back of my hand,
which is always completing with New York, and losing miserabily, but there
are some cool record stores in the city of Brotherly Love, that I could
give you intimate directions to, if you ever decide to pay her a visit. 

	Maybe I'm to sensative to the issue of returning there, I just
spoke with my family, yuk, today, and they keep telling me that I should
come back. I'm going to get a few pictures of myself standing on various
places along Highway 1, with the coast line behind me, and on each picture
taken of myself & the beautiful coast line wright this caption, "You want 
me to leave this?, NOOOOOOOOOOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

want an AMD N80186-10, or a N80188-10 Bit Slice CPU chip, in aaaaaa, I 
forget the studip package desigation, it's square, flat, designed for a 
socket, with the pins on the side all the way around the outside of 
the side with the smallest dimension. Any elect-project your working on

Hi All,

I've got a list of 15 SF Ravers seeking 30-62 tickets total.  My goal is to
at least get a pair out to each of them.  On the available tickets side,
I've got a range of 2 to 5 tickets available.  While it looks bleak, I
expect to see more extra tickets to break loose from their owners,
especially at the last minute.

Please, if you think you might have tickets at the last minute, don't be shy
about it.

If you want to get on the ticket exchange waiting list, send me email with
your name, the number of tickets you want, and a way I can contact you on
Sat, maybe even at the last minute.

If you have tickets you might make available at the last minute before the
party, email me or page/voice mail me (Grant) at: 415-406-2109.  If you
arrive at F&F with an extra ticket, look for me, I'll be glowing purple and
I'll be trying to hook people up with tickets all night.

Luv,

PT

Dear Niels,

	Well, I guess you'll just have to consider me a raving 
libertarian idiot!  |)  As far as privatization, you've got it all wrong, 
but I don't feel like debating the question on the rave list.
	And I never claimed Hom was great -- although he's nowhere near as 
bad as you'd have us believe.  He only looks great compared to the other S.F. 
mayoral contenders...

	Hugzzz,

               I would totally love to see this movie! i remember seeing
posters for it coming back from a party actually :) (it was called
"Vibrations" though).  Now, HERE'S  a story about integrity: Originally the
movie makers shot some sequences of rave in new york but needed some more
footage so, of course, they come to montreal (where the american dollar is
like 1.40$ now :P) and they gather together all the promoters here and
pitch them this idea: "ok, we'll give you 50, 000 to throw a party, you get
all the djs and all that we just give you the money, the only thing is we
have to film at the party." So, everyone here watches some rough cuts of
this movie, laughs their asses off, and leaves.  It made me proud :)

        Hey craig, brian and all;
        Well, it may seem like a cheesy NE-Coast cliche but "i'm thinking
of moving to san francisco" too :) Actually i have a plane ticket bought to
visit and make some contacts from Dec 26th-Jan 6th (whassup for new years?
;).
        I dunno, there are a lot of reasons to go out to San Fran (and
leave Montreal) but i find it strange that so many people want to migrate
en masse to SF, why not Hoboken, NJ? ;) Well, i want to go because:

        -The economy in montreal sucks
        -There's a referendum that will decide whether Quebec will separate
from Canada or not on Monday (and, regardless of the outcome, the economy
will still be screwed, the canadian dollar is now worth .60 US. :P)
        -san fran is warm, montreal is not (well, in the winter at least)
        -san fran has a better context for art/tech/computers/graphics jobs
than montreal
        -didn't the term "free love" come out of san fran? ;)
        -i love happy house (just kidding)
        -west coast people seem to me a bit warmer than people on the
NE-coast. and i like happy people :)
        -i want to be known as the person who brought ambient gabber to san
fran :)

        are there any other reasons why san fran is so great? i just keep
thinking about a culture and a city that has been affected to its roots by
numerous cultural influences that make it interesting.
        peace,
                brad

Entry form to download.

WHAT IS INTEREAT-INTER-EAT-
A Competition for the Design of Tables incorporating Computer Terminals and
internet access. It is an exciting Competition organized through the Net,
for Industrial Designers, Artists and Students from around the world. The
emphasis should be on creativity, functionality, outstanding design and
technical innovation.
The ZKM | Media Museum in Karlsruhe is planning an permanent Internet Cafe
called 'Salon Digital' as an integral part of the ZKM Museum Cafe in 1997.
(Some people may have encountered our successful prototype at the
MultiMediale 4)
The cafe will be designed, with special attention to the relationship
between sensuous (eating, drinking, talking) and digital communication.
One of the major problems is to invent a table which can incorporate in the
design, a "food and spill proof computer terminal".
The aim of the competition is to invent a design which combines a special
shaped computer monitor and keyboard under the surface of the table,
although other inventive proposals are encouraged.
Each table should stress the virtues of communication, both real and virtual=

Hello-
	About herbal e: don't buy it.  It's a rip-off, and no doubt the 
guy who makes it is turning a huge profit (although he does seem to have 
a big advertising campaign).   Herbal e itself is not a bad eperience, 
and luckily its an experience that can be had for a fraction the price by 
going down to your local herb/vitamin store and selecting a concoction 
marketed to increase energy that has the same ingredients (ma huang, gotu 
kola, ginseng, guarana, gingko, cayenne, etc...).  One particular product 
that we've used costs about $15 for 60 pills.  About 2-3 of these can 
give you the energy to jump 'til dawn.   The discovery of this stuff has 
really been a gift, since there are those times when you want to avoid 
certain substances.   Sometimes you just don't want an overwhelming 
experience, and you never want to do anything that would turn you colder 
towards others and/or make you depressed the next day.  These herbal 
stimulants are really not herbal speed or herbal e. They give you all of the 
energy (well, almost), and none of the fall-out.   They don't give you 
any emotional release or intense euphoria.   But if you just want to 
groove and sweat all night, you'll have the gas...---dave

Doesn't anyone remember that the movie "KIDS" had a rave scene in it?  It 
was called NASA, if I recall correctly.  The girl, Jenny, was given Special 
K, and there was also a scene of three people getting hot-n-heavy in the 
bathroom.  Aaahhh, disturbing movie, but that's another topic.

The Bay Area is sooooo wonderful.  I've been here for almost five years, 
and although I may have to leave, I hope to come back some day.  I grew 
up in rural California (yes, it exists) in a town of 60 people (NO, I AM 
NOT KIDDING) and it really sucked.  Can you say REDNECK MENTALITY?  I 
hide every time I go home to see my folks, so I don't have to see people 
from high school.  You should try to have grown up there, and then you'd really 
appreciate the Bay Area.
  
Food for Thought,

Yeah, I remember that scene.  But my impression was that it seemed to be

Hello Brothers and Sisters,

Yesterday, while driving home on the 101N back into The CIty, I saw the unseeable (at least I had never seen this before),the sign as you enter SF from the 101N that says "South San Francisco The Industrial City"  was changed to "South San
Frandisco The Idustril City".  I laughed so hard I cried.  I figured it had to be someone familiar with our dance/rave culture, since that term is used so often to describe our city.

Hope it's still there when I go home today!

SF IS DA BOMB!!!!!!!!!

I heard lat night on the fairly conservative channel 4 that
Roberta Actenberg is basically tied with both Jordan (hiss)
and Brown (less hiss, but still hiss).  In fact, channel 4
even said that the two most likely outcomes were Actenberg
winning or Brown winning, but they said both of these were
more likely than Jordan winning.  They were saying that the
most dramatic surge have been for Actenberg supporters, and
place a reasonable likely on her being the next mayor of
San Francisco.  I personally think she would be by far the
best, particularly in terms of making P.G.&E., Viacom and
other downtown business interests (who get away with out
even paying taxes under Jordan) pay their fair share and
stick to their contracts (another thing Jordan let them get
away with was not sticking to the terms of their contracts).
Brown, because he has so many large downtown business clients,
would not as likely enforce this stuff like Actenberg would,
who has no similar conflict of interest and has consistently
shown her constituents support in her voting patterns.

Oh well, I'll just go out and say it, since I've come so
close already... both Actenberg and Hallinan, particularly if
you *really* want accountability and change!

Hi there:

O.K.  I was avoiding using the name of the product because i wanted to be 
clear that I have no affiliation with its manufacturer, and have no 
interest in its promotion, except that, of course i want to pass on the 
word about something that works great (for me) to others who could benefit.
So, that being said, the name of the stuff I've had success with is "up 
your gas" (tee hee).  There are numerous other energy mixtures out there, 
e.g. "happy camper" and others (Rok: care to fill in some blanks?), but i 
think the main concern is to get something containing ma huang.  So, hey, 
have fun, but be careful-- this stuff does apparently speed up heart 
rate, and I've even heard, in a very indirect and unreliable way, that 
it could be worse for your body than e (which feels pretty damn good 
to my body).  I would think it wouldn't be a bad idea to talk to a doctor 
about this stuff if you think you might induldge regularly.  
	You can find this type of stuff at most herb stores, whole foods 
markets, GNC, and just about any place that has a big vitamin selection.
	
					Bounce well, -dave.

I guess I wouldn't have a problem with it if people really stayed away from
drugs because they were illegal.  That's a choice I can respect, even if I
don't necessarily agree.  However, my experience has been that most people
believe drugs are illegal _because_ they are harmful, so if alcohol &
nicotine are legal they must not be harmful.  It's sad, but true, that there
are people who believe this.

hey! i'm looking for some more weird sites to add to a point-and-click
  map for my homepage; the idea is, the sites will be jumbled up and 
    mapped to the background so that if the user clicks somewhere other
      than on one of the main buttons, it'll send'em off whoknowzwhere...

any neato-sites will be appreciated !

I know.  And I think that's part of the problem is that beer is accepted
simply because of culture.  It's been around for a while, _and_ transplanted
westerners happen to be the dominant cultural body in Australia.  You know,
if Native Americans had conquered Europe 500 years ago, he would be saying
"when I was young, people would celebrate a new job by going out and
lighting up a few bowls with some mates, not taking drugs", in response to
the article "TEEN DIES AT ALL-NIGHT DANCE PARTY AFTER CONSUMING ALCOHOL."

Just a thought, 

Mr. Jake

i had to be dragged kicking and screaming to my first rave.
it was going to be lame. it was going to be a bunch of smoking,
self-conscious, pretentious club-goers. i was so wrong.
the community, the parties and the people i have all found
to be fairly amazinng. not to mention the music- the harder
faster and crunchier the better!  being the nerdy anthropologist
that i am, i am writing my thesis on "Rave as Ritual, Creating
Community in a PostModern Society" pedantic title, yes, but
i have a serious commitment to do it justice. not to mention
my fieldwork is going to be a blast (if you see a girl with
a cast on her leg and pad in hand at fandf, that's me).

as members of this community, i'm asking you to contribute your ideas.
some things i'm interested in: trance and dance, the history of raves,
the drugs, the vibe, the media and the police (the Institutions)
if there are any dj's out there who'd share their thoughts with me, i'd
love it.

please mail me: howard@cats.ucsc.edu

i'm looking forward to seeing many of you at fandf. i missed the last
one (but was there in spirit) because i had a full leg cast on 
(rollerblading accident). maybe i'll even get to dance a little *grin*

Well, I wasn't trying to make any big fuss or anything.  Let's put it
this way, Harrisburg ain't as bad as some of the rusty old towns
around there in PA.  They're just closing Bethlehem Steel for the final
time, it's the end of an American era in that region.  They have
difficult problems but they're Americans, hell, they're *people* too
there, and even if they have to escape like Craig (and so many others),
they bring part of that experience to us as well.

Doug Z had an interesting idea.  If you're like me and don't feel like
getting into some kind of elaborate costume for Friends & Family, why
not go dressed as a "raver".  We all remember how to do that, right?
Doug sez he might break out the striped shirt, blow pops, hat, whistle,
even maybe a laundry detergent box :-)  Bonus points for Cat in the Hat
hats or other items!

Hello everyone!
Just wanted to write a little about myself before I start posting stuff all
over the place! I hope this doesn't ramble on too long.
I have been going to raves/events/what have you in the sf area for about a
year now. Prior to that I was very involved in the DC/Baltimore scene for two
years. My relationship with raves has been sort of rocky. When I first
started going, it was like I had found God himself. I was SO happy to have
found this whole culture that I really felt I belonged to. Our scene was
small enough that all of the regulars knew each other, and it was like being
like part of a family (awww, ain't that sweet?)

Somewhere along the line things started to get out of control. I don't mean
to say anything bad about the scene out there, but my involvement in it was
getting crazy. I was spiraling downward into more drug use, and I started to
have doubts about whether these ravers I knew were really my friends. Also, I
felt as though the quality of events was on a decline. I then began to feel
as though I would die or be trapped in the rave scene if I didn't get out of
it somehow. About this time, my boyfriend (now hubby) got a job offer in
California, so we decided to bail and move out here. Before we left, we went
to one final event which truly sucked for me. I thought the energy was very
low, and we were saying good-bye to all of these people we knew who (it
seemed) couldn't give a shit less what happened to us. Brrrr. I was feeling
really negative at this time. I also said some nasty things about ravers in
my zine, HAZMAT which I now regret, but it was how I felt at the time and I
was trying to be honest.

After we moved out here, I had grave doubts as to whether I wanted to go to
any more raves. I really did a lot of soul-searching at this time. Finally
what brought me back into it was the love of the music and the spirit of the
rave which I had found at the beginning. I missed it! I posted a message on
alt.raves and this really nice person (whom some of you know as Sy) answered
it, and invited me to come out with him & his friends. 

My first SF rave was Kundolini, last year! I must say I was very skeptical at
first about the scene out here. But after meeting so many nice people, I have
been transformed! Also going to a lot of great events helped. Esp. F&F,
Harmony, Sunset, and a little party called Syntonic which my friends threw.
After almost a whole year of being out here, I am finally READY to be a
positive part of the scene. I know a lot of my newer friends think I am
weird, since I am still a bit jaded & cynical. It's just that I'm not so
naive as to think that the rave is some fairy-tale world, where nothing bad
ever happens and everyone hugs each other. 

But having said that bit of nastiness, I am really glad to see quite a few
older people out there (I am 27), and a lot of people who are genuinely
concerned with having a rave "community". I am going to try meeting some more
people now, and to give back some of the love and positive energy which so
many have given me.

Hope to meet some of you soon-I have my sfraves badge from Wayne so I am all
set!

   Friday, Stompy has the lineup and track record to be guaranteed to be
   bumpin'. On Saturday, Funky Tekno Tribe is the only one-off event I
   know of that you can still get tickets to ;). Sunset might be back on
   Sunday, and on Monday night the Gardening Club hits its one-year
   birthday. Tuesday is Halloween, and Wednesday, if you're still with
   me, is Come-Unity. Whew!

     [ Doug and Phred suggest going as "ravers" ]
     
     Ohhh, brilliant idea!
     
     I used to have a fondness for bike gloves, fuschia eye liner, "manic 
     panic" hair dye, glow sticks, dangly earrings, purple sunglasses, and 
     lots of stuff hanging around my neck (badges, mini flashlight, weird 
     jewlrey).  
     
     I should go dig all that stuff out.  Maybe I can even find my hot-pink 
     tie-dye denim shorts.  Actually, they wouldn't fit anymore. :-(
     
     And then there was the napsack full of things (toys, kaleidoscope, 
     more clothes for when I got sweaty, bored, or cold, fig newtons, amino 
     acid tablets, extra toilet paper) that I'd carry around, always highly 
     amusing to rummage through when my mind was "rummaged" itself, so to 
     speak.
     
     I don't know which ex-pat East Coasters are reading this, but I still 
     have that grey blanket with the black flowers on it -- you know, 
     Laura's infamous "rave blanket."  I'm sure Rishad knows the one I 
     mean.  Many a NE-Raver crashed on or curled up in this :-)
     
     10 points for anyone who brings diffraction grating.  20 for a pocket 
     laser.
     
     Laura
     
     P.S. If anyone out there actually *remembers* seeing me with/in any of 
     this, drop me a line (privately ) :-) :-)

Alright Groodies,

I will begin a series of jungle lessons =) from today ...
The first lessen will be given by our guest lecturer DJ Casper (Julian
Carow) from Boston who defines the jungle/happy hardcore music as the
following:

UK Hardcore is a style of fast (around 165 beats per minute) underground
dance music which is based on the use of a "breakbeat". Hardcore is very
diverse and has many different sounds.

Basically there is Jungle (a.k.a. Drum & Bass) and there is Happy Hardcore
(a.k.a. 4-Beat). Although the similarities between the two are disappearing,
both stem from the same '91/'92 Hardcore years. In 1992 rave music reached
its commercial height with many happy breakbeat piano tunes being quite
popular. In 1993, Hardcore went back underground with a style called
Darkness which featured eerie sounds. By 1994 Jungle and Drum & Bass were
emerging with more complex beats and basslines. Dancehall and R&B samples
became more influential. At the same time a newer style of hardcore was
emerging called Happy Hardcore aka 4-Beat which was a throwback to the days
of '92, with pianos and happy techno sounds. Besides having a breakbeat,
most Happy Hardcore trakcs today also have a 4/4 beat over the top as well
which gives it an added kick (hence the name 4-Beat).

Today both Happy Hardcore and Jungle are highly popular in England and
around the world. In North America Jungle is most popular in Toronto and
Chicago.

JUNGLE / DRUM & BASS

Jungle is very complex music that ranges from heavily ragga and dancehall
influenced tunes to deeper melodic tracks called "intelligent". Ragga was
very big this past winter and has pretty much died out at the moment.
Currently intelligent drum & bass is my favorite style. Some of my favorite
UK Jungle DJs are Hype, Rap, Fabio, Phantasy, Kenny Ken, Darren Jay, and LTJ
Bukem.

"Jungle is England's culture. England never had a culture before Jungle
started. Jungle in England is what Hip Hop is for the USA. But at the end of
the day, we didn't make it just to be English, we made it so that the whole
world would appreciate it and so far we haven't done too badly. Jungle is
gonna be a universal thing, different styles are put together and people can
relate to that."
-Kenny Ken (Eternity #31)

HAPPY HARDCORE / 4-BEAT

In addition to Jungle, there is Happy Hardcore / 4-Beat which has less
complex beats and often has a 4/4 beat along with it. Pianos and female
vocals reign supreme in Happy Hardcore which makes you want to smile and
throw your hands in the air. It is HUGE in England. Some of my favorite UK
Happy Hardcore DJs are Sy, Slipmatt, Dougal, Vibes, and of course the DJ
Seduction.

Unfortunately Happy Hardcore is not very popular in North America. Its
counterpart Jungle is much more popular here although nowhere near as
popular as house and trance. The few DJs who do spin it are Phil Free Art
(Chicago), Intensity (New Mexico), Ruff Rida (Toronto), and Casper
(Boston/Chicago).

Stay tuned for tomorrow's lesson given by JJ Jellybean (Want to know what's
Amen??? that will be in tomorrow's lesson)...

May the force be with you ...

'Sup!?

There's an interestiong article in October issue of The Face, a U.K.
publication covering music,a nd music scenes, etc.

There's an interesting article on E, and an article on Nicholas Saunders
the author of "E is for Ecstasy".

The article on E called "E Ten Years on the Pill" relates to SFRaves
because it highlights a very cool "illegal but government-sanctioned Safe
House Project in Amsterdam."  Essential, what they do is test drugs for
people.  In fact, they set up a table at raves (parties, what have you) and
people line up to have what they have just purchased from a dealer tested
for it's approximate chemical make-up.  That is, "To identify one, they run
the chemical test, measure its circumference and depth, then note its
colour (sic:) and markings.  They have lists of known specimens, pages and
pages of them..., with the details compressed into a 13-digit code.  When
they find one which corresponds exactly, they know what they're dealing
with."  It goes on about people tossing tabs if they don't get a match,
etc.  One very, very cool thing mentioned is the curbing of bad hits at a
party:  "As soon as anything dodgy is discovered, he has the authority to
stop the music and make an annoucement, advising people to identify and
eject the dealer."

Hmmm...that would certainly make one think twice about selling bad shit, eh?

Anyway, the article goes into E and raving and has interesting side-bars on
the history of E, raving and an a neat chart showing the history of
increased BPM through out the last ten years, i.e., "1985 Rare groove, Jazz
funk, uptempo R&B 92-96bpm...1989 Rave anthems 124bpm...1994 Gabber breaks
big in Holland and Scotland 180-200BPM...Also Moby's extraordinarily bad
"Thousand", at 1,000BPM 1993."

It's an interesting issue, and if you don't want to pay the $5-6 for it, I
recommend you read it in the magazine store.  The Face isn't easy to find
(I got mine in Seattle), but I know it's out there.

Peace ya' all!

Tony

FYI, to the caffeine junkies: -A toxic dose of caffeine is 1gram...
                                roughly the equivalent of 5-6 cups of coffee
                                Toxicity= Rapid heartbeat, gastrointestinal
                                          disturbances, anxiety, insomnia
                                          and more...
                              -Lethal dose= 10grams (about 50 cups)

unfortunately my source was not up on the 90's coffee conscious culture, 
so the above figures are not applicable to anything else but the average, 
watery american brew...

As far as Ketamine (Ketalar), it is in the same class as PCP, being 
considered a psychedelic anesthetic. I've heard that it can be smoked, 
but the full effects occur via the injection route, in which case it 
produces a state of dissociation, loss of awareness of current time and 
space. Along with PCP, it is the only psychedelic that is 
self-administered by monkeys, ie- it probably stimulates brain reward 
pathways, ie- it is the only psychedelic that seems to be addictive,
and highly so. This observation seems to be corroborate by individual
experiences that I have read about. High doses induce a state of stupor 
or coma, massive overdoses are potentially lethal, may cause seizures, 
and can have as aftereffects states of confusion and delusion that may 
last for as long as two weeks. Sounds like fun, no?

It can be smoked, injested, or taken intramuscularly.

I'd agree.  From what I've read it's _very_ potent and should not be taken
lightly.

Hi all!

I was just wondering, for those of us that didn't get tickets to fnf(sob
sob!!) are you dressing up for ftt?

I really want to wear my vampire costume I've been putting together and was
just wondering if I would be the only one in cosume.

 ( I tried sending my additional post earlier , but forgot to add the following
   text! Never watch TV and email at the same time .... )

 If Mary and I get our butts in gear early enough to finish our costumes, we'll
be there as Mr. Sun and Ms. Moon ! Along with Susie/Dilbert , a cow to jump
over Ms. Moon , and "ravers" ... Who else?

Well we all seem to be getting into this big night-o-fun. What could be
better, two of my favorite things rolled into one, Halloween and FnF.
First of all, I will be wearing a SFRaves Laminate :)   (of course),
and I will have a pocket full, for those of you who are still sans-laminate.

I will be having *big* fun, some of you know what I mean ;) I'll also be
wearing my new wacky hat. 5'+ long, made of red, blue and purple VELVET !!



Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.............

now that i got your attention...
has anyone read this book out there? do people feel the way i do about 
what is going on with the consciousness of people everywhere?
especially events like F&F. i think were *evolving* to a higher vibration 
of energy, with everyone openly sharing *their* energy, not taking or 
stealing it from others, like has been the plague of humanity for years.,
thats right my friends, were on to something BIG here. were evolving a 
new way of expression and communication, and when you get right down to 
it, the underlying energy is *Love*.
see ya at F&F.
(if anyone wants to continue this conversation in person, i'll be wearing 
the fred flintstone shirt and a big smile:)

For all of you who are going to FTT, please let me know how it went.  
I'm just curious about all this because I've seen it promoted MAJORLY 
here in Sacramento in places where there aren't alot of ravers.  Namely 
here on the Sac State campus.  There are very few ravers here and I saw 
stacks of flyers in the library and posted at the main quad.  I just 
become very wary of extremely promoted events like that.  I definately 
hope that FTT turns out to be alot of fun, I just hate seeing it so 
commercialized.

love,
Amy

I won't be dressing up (I haven't in about 4 years - I'm such a bore!)
but my friend Carolyn will be a Christmas tree and you cannot miss her - 
complete with x-mas lights and everything!  So if you spot her, I won't 
be far away.  For those who haven't met me yet, I'll be wearing dark 
green cords, white tank top, & indian choker - maybe barettes.  I'm 5'6" 
with long brown hair. I'll also be wearing my sfraves & nw-raves 
laminates.  I'm looking forward to seeing all my sfraver friends and 
meeting many more sfravers that I haven't had the privledge of meeting yet!

See you all tomarrow night!!!! :):):):):):)

love,
Amy

Okay okay this is the last one, I promise!

I'm going to be carving a *really COOL* looking jack -o- lantern this 
evening and was wondering if it would be okay to possibly bring it to 
F&F.  I wouldn't want it to get swiped because it is actually for my 
sister, but the idea I have is really good, and I want to share it with 
everybody.  For the F&F crew: is it okay to bring it?

love,
Amy

Well, I'm not a doctor and I don't even play one on T.V., but  I 
really don't think inhaling vasopressin would be a good idea - 
vasopressin is also known as antidiuretic hormone, and it's released by 
the posterier pituitary gland after recieving signals from the 
hypothalamus.  Vasopressin acts primarily on the kidneys promoting water 
retension (hence it being known as an antidiuretic), and it also promotes 
the constriction of blood vessels.  Both of these actions increase blood 
pressure.  Normally the release of vasopressin in under tight 
negative-feedback regulation, and is released only in >small< 
quantities.  In this case, more would not be better, because of increased 
stress on blood vessels.  As with all things biological, this is not to 
say that vasopressin doesn't also do other things, although I've never 
heard it in the same breath as memory - but keep in mind that its primary 
action is on the kidney which cycles more blood that you want to know, and 
contains lots of little blood vessels, which are sensitive to increases in 
blood pressure.  Renal failure and blood in the urine isn't my idea of a 
fun time.

I think you have to, by law, mention what is in a food product your 
selling.  I don't know exactly how Herbal E is classified but I  am 
sure they have to disclose whats in it.  Secret or not.  That is one of 
the good things about the FDA.  Lets us know what we are taken.  It 
seems like herbal E is a bunch of crap anyway.  My girlfriend is in a 
drug education class and the teacher recommends saving money by buying 
a bottle of mini-thins.  You'll get the same high for a fraction of the 
cost!

Don't take those fucking mini-thins.  They are allllllll baaaddd.  I posted

     Driving into work today, I was struck once again by the universal 
     language of love through music and dance.  Though it was cool and 
     foggy outside, my heart illuminated warmth beyond this physical 
     dimension.
     
     After a joyful awakening as a result of the wonderful weekend at 
     Tribal Future, I am once again able to show my true spirit and it 
     feels wonderful!  I've been quite deadened by my experiences with the 
     scene since July (probably more due to stuff in my personal life) and 
     wasn't much into dancing or sharing as much love as in the past...but 
     that's all been remedied...so watch out!
     
     Thank you Ameba folks, the sfravers, and all the other kindred spirits 
     that I met last weekend.  The joy and energy shared continues to keep 
     me buzzing.  
     
     Though I won't be physically present at F&F, I wish you all whopping 
     good time.  This weekend, Nicholas and I will definitely do a jig in 
     our costumes embracing the love that we all share.
     
     This crazed babble was inspired by courtesy music from Phred Huette 
     and the ever present sunshine in my life...and NO, I didn't go out 
     last night to get this inspiration ;)

I also think that ephedrine is about as effective as any herbal e crap on the
market. But I also really like Happy Campers. If you're in a bad mood, they
seem to correct that.

Hallo All...it's nearly all hallows eve! (I couldn't resist that
one :)

Well, if there's a positive correlation between the number of 
positive pre-party SFR postings and the amount of positively-
charged energy at the party, then Friends and Family should
be positively electric Saturday night... :)

I'll be decked out in my usual garb--white face paint and little
red devil horns--and I'll be with my friends Reza, Niki and Jess
and others.  Friends' costumes are still being dreamed up and 
thought about, but preliminary indications have Jess going as a
raver superhero; Reza's outfit involves fangs, and apparently Niki's
got some sort of math dress.  So if anyone has sympathy for the devil,
come say hi and get a hug and a blowpop.  

See you all there,
Timothy

Hi, all! I'm soooo jealous that sooo many of you are going to 
F&F- I've a prior family thing which keeps me away :(

to say how much I've enjoyed the space we share and the 
community we make here. That, and how much I've 
enjoyed all of you- virtually and otherwise. 

I don't have a costume, but Ursula (my dog) does! 
Any outdoor parties this weekend for her?

Jocelyn

Hello!

Felix needs a ride to Friends and Family Saturday night...he's playing in 
one of the ambient rooms.  Since I am helping set up and so on, I don't 
want to leave to go and pick him up.

Is there anybody out there who could possibly give him a lift from a 
party in the city- he's doing a paying gig as well that night - in 
exchange for two free tickets?  He's off at  about 2 or so.  He might 
need a ride back to the City, too..but this will be less of a problem I 
think.

EMAIL me with your name and number and I'll get in touch.

Thank you very much!

Ann

If they dilate your bronchi and speed up your heart rate, then it 
most assuredly is *not* caffeine--It's probably effedrine.

Be very carful taking 5 or more of these depending on weight and size you 
could be in for a real bad time! We used to call taking mini thins IE 
(ephedrine) and smoking herb, "racing the moon"- I still think it is almost 
as fulfilling as E,  I don't think it's anything like COKE TM or caffeine. 
One or two should do the trick. You can also get it in a tea form as well-

Does anybody have solid info on the dangers of ephedrine? I am sure you are 
finding it mixed heavily with what is being sold as E in the Calif.

Actually, I am pretty sure that ephedrine is a precursor to Ectascy. That's
why the sales of it are now closely monitored by the federal government. 

The only bad side effect I have noticed (from max-alerts) is they make your
lungs hurt the next day (because it is a broncho-dilator), and when it wears
off you feel SOOOOO tired. I would definately not take more than 3 at once.

Also, max-alerts are great for people with allergies and asthma, they make
you feel much better for opening up those breathing tubes.

Ephedrine is a precursor for meth-amphetamines/amphetamines and the like.  
It is not a precursor for XTC.

        Yeah, now we're talkin' :) I have to say that i find that 'the
book' (as all my friends call it) has some really important and amazing
things to say. My only complaint was the prose writing part ;) but yeah,
the ideas totally resonate well with me.  On a related topic, there's a
theory about "Morphogenetic Resonance" that was brought up by Rupert
Sheldrake (a biologist). BAsically, it's the "critical mass" theory all
over again in more scientific terms. If anyone knows some good references
for this stuff, URLs, etc etc, please let me know. I tried a web search but
came up dry apart from a few things.
        It's happening though, you can totally feel it can't you? Even
though the "hundredth monkey" theory has been disproved, there IS something
going on REALLY BIG in the collective un/sub/super-conscious.

        Here's the Celestine Home Page, enjoy!:

...of course!

And I will be bringing a few people that have never been to a rave before,
as I figured that this would be the consummate 'first-time' experience for
them. If you see people with me looking wide-eyed and amazed be sure to
give them BIG HUGS!

Me? I will be 6'6" tall and wearing a fez. I will have some SFR laminates, too!

Hello everyone!

Does anyone know of a doctor, nurse, paramedic or other health care type 
person who is coming to the party saturday night?

If there is somebody like that who's coming, please let one of the 
organizers know.

Also, there will be a first aid kit at the juice bar area.

bye!

Ann

Okay, someone was nice enough to hook us up with 2 tickets to friends

If there's anyone leaving from san francisco with room in their car, 
we'd be oh-so-happy if they could give us a call or email us.

Thanks,

Meth-amphetamines, but not Ecstacy, which is properly known as MDMA?

Um, what exactly do you think think the last two initials in the
name "MDMA" stand for?

My last posting before I go "sans e-mail" for 5 days.  Will I be able to
survive??
I'm getting the shshshshshakes as we speak now!!  Maybe this is a book in
the making,  "E-mail Withdrawl for Dummies".    

Anyways,  SF will be soooooo exciting.  But, at the same time I kinda feel
like that Russian astronaut that stayed in outer space for a year and when
he landed there was no Russia, anymore.  It had broken up into more pieces
than a Ravensburger puzzle.  

I can relate to this guy.  Let me elaborate,  I leave from Canada tomorrow
for SF and I return next Wed.  Anyways, on Monday, Quebec (our francophone)
province will vote on seperation(!) from Canada.  Monday will absolutely
change the face of Canada one way or another.  

Do you know what Canada needs?? A cross-country rave!  One big heaving love
nest of trance, house and assorted phat beats would cure any talk of
"distinct society" or "distinct culture".  What would be better than one big
group hug of love and unity.  I think the Feds should make it mandatory for
the whole country to rave and in fact they should subsidize everybody's
purchase of rave tickets, candy, etc.  In fact, the feds would probably make
certain promoters public like the Canada Post(or US Mail).  Imagine FnF as a
standard cross-country party where everybody would be obligated to go.  On
second thought it would probably take all the fun out of it.

Just ranting...  

See you soon!!!!
Yippie!!!!
Over and out!!!!
John

hey, thanks for the celestine page. hoe can i get a hold of that 
"morphogenic feild" thing?
its definetly happening, but at what rate im not sure, but its at parties 
like F&F, where we all come together and are a part of teh *vibe* 
created. thats why change will come, from teh people, not fad, fasion, 
T.V., or the government. because were no longer playing their game of 
"materialism, consumerism... individualism" we no longer take one anothers 
energy (are learning not to) but share it amongst ourselves. and 
there is a vast amount of energy vibrating from everything out there,
theres no need to "take" energy from oneanother anymore.

	I have done vaopressin a couple times, and you are correct in 
it's description.  It is naturally a brain hormone.  Certain drugs 
create a depleation of it, namely marijuana and lsd, maybe others, I'm 
not sure.  Taking it when you don't need it does little to nothing, you 
might feel a buzz for 2-3 minutes, but is definetly not worth the $1 
per hit cost.  BUT after a trip or an intense smoking session a hit of 
vasopressin will instantly revive you from that dopey state.  Also in 
combination with marijuana is nice, crystal clear awake highs.

Hello!
	On another note...after reading the posts regarding herbal E and  
stuff I decided to go out and get some ma huang today...it is only 1.50 
for an ounce!it was pretty 
nice...I had I guess about a half of what I would want to takeif I was to 
want to stay up and dance at a party all night... it was kind of like 
mini-thins but without the upset stomach part. I had already had one cup 
of coffee and I started chewing on a tablespoon or so of the stuff... 
I already am pretty tolerant of coffee...but within a couple of 
minutes...as I was sitting in my cs lecture I couldnt stop my leg from 
bouncing up and down! I gave the same amount to a friend and she said 
that the sky seemed more there?

Hello again,
	well I guess that I am kind of still up... and I figured that it 
was time for me to stop being rude and introduce myself as it seems that 
I am having lots of fun in this list!. My name is Tony...I am a student 
at berkeley studying an independant major combining aspects from computer 
science, math, philosophy, and cognitive science. I am interested in how 
the mind works, AI, cool technological things, and I love music...I have 
gone through aloty of musical styles from industrial to pop, grateful 
dead, etc...one common theme in my love for music has always been for the 
more trippy spacey ambient sounds like skinny puppy, GD's space and more 
recently irresistable force, aphex twin, Banco, and children of the bong 
are some of my favorites. and of course dancing!
	On the technological side, one thing that I love that about the rave 
scene is the use of technology inb a way that is not purely business 
oriented. I am really excited that people are able to make music and 
express themselves more easily than ever before with technology. Not to 
say that it is easy to make good music( I am still trying to figure out 
what to do with the samples that i just learned to take through my cd-rom 
on my computer!), but accessible.
	One of my most recent things that I have n\been thinking about is 
that is there really an emergent global culture arising through the 
internet and through rave culture. Things like Banco De Gaia's music 
which is so multicultural, Mod Lang in berkeley expanding their dance 
section (YES!), 40,000people raving at one party in england, germany had 
a one week rave party last year, and the fact that we are all communicating 
and creating a 
new kind of community over the internet seem to be really positive 
indicators that maybe 
there is an emergent phenomen happening on this little planet of ours. 
And it all seems so positive.  And even in the sciences...the progressive 
thought seems to be more and more holistic, chaos theory, Penroses' 
quantum computers etc...but maybe I am rambling here... oh well... I am 
still working out if I really think that there is an emergent phenomenon 
happening or if it is just that you see what you look for in life...ahhh 
shit oh well...I think that I will go to sleep...

Hi all,
	My name is Sir Nod(Don't worry this isn't a bio) . I've been a 
lurker on this list for about three years and I haven't really gotten a 
chance to meet many sfravers. So, I was lucky enough to obtain a ticket 
to F&F and I am hoping to get to meet lots and lots of you.

	So if you see me tonight, please say hello. I am a 25 year old 
white male, long blond hair, long beard, wearing a DEA hat(Bad joke, 
don't worry).

Tonight we get to dance with the spirits, and its going to be a blast!!

Peace Love,

Sir Nod

        Ha ha, i always wonder that too. You really can edit reality based
on your own desires but i DO think that there IS a huge emergent phenomenon
of spirituality, intelligence and evolution (in the best meaning of the
word) going on right now.  Just the simple fact that you can talk to a real
human being one on one (well, through email) without the media mediation
will go a long way to opening lines of communication and blurring borders,
cultural identities etc.  I can sense intuitively the connection between
the emergence of raving, electronic culture and (to be honest) the increase
in the use of certain drugs.  All of these things seem to be bringing us
all into denser and denser and more complex forms in interconnecting with
each other. And, personally speaking, other people can be a source of
strength and knowledge, to push you higher and all that :)

        densely yours,
                brad

Hello again!

I am still looking for someone who could pick up Felix- who is playing 
tonite at the FnF party- at his place off of Haight Street at midnight 
tonite.  He goes on a 1:30.  What you get for this good deed are free 
tickets to the party and lots of good karma!  

Much respect,

Ann

ps give me your number so I can call you...

Yes, I know that MDMA is 3,4-methylendioxymethamphetamine!!!!!  But if you 
believe that you can synthesize MDMA from Meth-Amphetamine or from ephedrine I 
would like to see that synthesis fixer man, cause I have never seen or heard 
about anybody that can.

Hey kids,

	There was a thread a few days ago about good hardcore labels... 
well, I just picked up Spicelab's Day on our Planet off Harthouse, and I 
LOVE it.  Could any Harthouse-savvy citizens out there recommend another 
good Harthouse album, be it a compilation or just one artist?  I really 
love acidy, darksider, trancey-techno-house.  

	Love,

		jon

     Hey everybody, me and a few others need rides to F&F from Santa Cruz,
and I thought this would be the best place to ask for help.  Right now the
plan is to pack 12 people into 2 cars, and I'm not even sure that that'll
work; and anyhow, that plan leaves me sittin' on the curb ;'(.  If any of you
are going, any extra spaces in you car would be appreciated... give me a page

        Yaayy!  I am totally *stoked* about tonight's FnF!  I'm still
relatively new to this wonderful scene and even newer to this list (I've
been lurking a couple of months now) but I'm dying to meet *all* of you - I
guess I'll have to settle for *many* of you ;)
        I'm going with three friends tonight.  We're totally laggin' on our
costumes, but it looks like I'll be in white facepaint, some cheesy, Bella
Lugosi-lookin' fangs, and some shades that ain't coming off for God or
country!  I think my (more creative) friends will be dressed as various Dr.
Seuss characters.  I don't have a laminate yet, but I hope to meet Vince
(and his sooperdooper hat!) and get one.  Well, guess that's about it.  Say
'howdy' if you see us, we'll have ice-cream flavored lollipops aplenty.
Peace

you're wrong John. the synthetic base for mdma is methyl-amphetamine. 
Ephedrine is 
used medically in coulple of different ways. First, you can use it as a 
decongestnt, as is promotes small vessel vasoconstriction, ie in nasal 
mucosa. It can also be used in truama/resus situations as a pressor 
agent. It has the disadvantage of being a non-selective vasoconstrictor, 
clamping down on the systemic and renal pre-capillary beds, but it is 
used. Its side effects are what you would expect from a alpha-agonist. It 
raised systemic blood pressure peripherally, has some CNS stim effects
and has beta 1 agonist activity at very high doses ie, abuse doses. This 
latter effect is what gets people in trouble...basically the stuff will 
make you tachycardic, and throw the user into arrythmia if he.she is 
predisposed to arrythmia. Not a benign compound. Everything in 
moderation, folks.

	ephedrine is a precursor to speed. Making speed from ephedrine
is pretty easy. I'm not sure about mdma though.

Well I couldn't make it to fnf (had to work), but I was there in 
spirit.  For those of you that went I'd love to hear the reviews, and 
lets keep the party going at what I hear will probably be the last 
sunset party of the year.

[ to SFRaves mailist ]

 The only thing I regretted about last night's Friends and Family event
was that Mary and I could only stay for such a short time! At least we 
were able to contribute some bananas and peppermints for 
the rest of the folks there. 

 Nice to see so many fairies, angels , and other winged creatures. 

 I'm sure others can give a better and more detailed account - let's
see em'!  ( At least the "please sell me a F&F ticket" posts will
end!).

 Also - how was Funky Techno Tribe?

Hello-
Just wanted to thank everyone who was involved in putting F&F on last night.
That party totally made my year. I had fun, fun, fun with a capital PH, PHUN!
What can I say? The music was great, the vibe was extraordinary, but most
important of all, the people made it all happen for me. And I am talking
about each and every one of you who were there!!!! 
I wish I had made it to the last Sunset, I'm sure it was great! I somehow got
involved in drinking Mountain Dew and pondering the deeper meaning of Calvin
& Hobbes. 
Groove On-

     I moved out to the west coast, thinking 'how much different can the vibe
be from NY?' but I supposed I was proved wrong comepleteley.  When the people
I went with & I arrived there, I wasn't particularly impressed, but as the
crowd became at ease with eachother, and the vibe began building, I was
totally amazed.  At most of the raves in the east I went to, the crowd kept
pretty much to themselves, kids from brooklyn only associating with the other
brooklyn kids, the kids from newburgh keeping to their own etc., but the
scene at friends and family had such a feeling of community, I was at ease
with people I had just met like I'd known them for years (although I think I
ended being a bit irritating to a few by being so damn happy and friendly).
     X-tra special thanks go out to Sabin & Matt, who got me there and got me
in, and Bobby too for giving me that phatty hat, and everyone else for being
there- you contributed the energy for one of the best raves I've ever been to
;'D.

      Hugs, Wurz

We'll, I wouldn't be able to do it justice in explaining what a wonderful
time I had...certainly one of the best, I think all the previous post covers
just about everythings, but I would like to thank all the people that I met
before and during the event for such a wonderful time, and to all the people
I didn't get to meet I hope you had as much fun as I did and hope we can meet
in the future. I'm just glad I got a ticket at the last moment, TKS. Thanks
goes out to all the people that made this event one to remember.
 
P.S. How was Sunset...I woke up at 7:30pm and by the time I would of got
there it would have almost been over...:(........I really would have liked to
have gone.

Deeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaamn!
There's not much I can say to supplement the already exhaustive posts 
about the epiphany we all experienced last night.  So, I just wanna say 
thanks to all my sfraver friends who I saw again or met for the first time.
BTW, I was the guy wearing the Burger King crown (which I sweated to pieces) 
and Dr. Freecloud's shirt.

	Dave M. (Thanks for all the spritzes)
	Carolyn & Amy Starkey (Thanks for remembering me!)
	Eden (We need to get together and talk sometime... sorry we couldn't
		talk longer last night)
	Justin Black (I'm glad you got my ticket, I hope you had a good time)
	Ellen (Glad to finally meet you)
	Reagan (You are adorable :-)
	Starchild (Your outfit was fantastic!)
	Black Adder (The lighting was, as usual, fantastic)
	Vince (You didn't seem that tall the last time I saw you...)
	Wayne (Hope you enjoyed the Djarum)
	Ethan (Your set completely ruled heaven and earth)

and everyone else whose names escape me right now... I still remember 
your smiling faces. =)

	Thanks to everyone, especially the hardworking, caring, 
creative, genuine FnF crew who always make the party go off up into the 
stratosphere.

as well)

what can i say...

  i didn't want to leave Friends and Family last night.  i just wanted
to keep partying and dancing and enjoying the vibes all night.
however all good parties come to an end, and im still glowing like
crazy about it. mad props to tracy, andy, ethan, joe rice, and galen
for rocking my world and making me dance as hard and as much as i did
  i dressed up as a '92 raver. stocking cap, stripe shirt, baggiest
pants i could find, pacifier and whistle. i was a little out of
practice using a whistle so i hope i didn't annoy anyone too bad with
it.  if i did :P to you  :)
  thanks to veronica de groovy for the ride and all.
and to everyone for making this party so special.

peace and take care,

ARGH!
thanks for letting me get that out!  hello to all the sfravers i haven't
talked to in about 2 weeks.  just wanted to let you know, Matt's back on the
list.  i was suddenly overcome work and other life-oriented crap, about
which i ignored too many friends, including you.  Anyway, pray for me (in
whatever way to choose to) that i make it through the rest of this semester,
for it looks like a doozy.

Have fun, ya'll!

peace, love, and really fucked up semesters-

matt

Well said, Tristan!  Just chilling out =89), easing into another week and
saying goodbye to a weekend I don't want to end  8P  Saturday's FnF was
absolutely, positively **fantastic**.  THANK YOU FnF crew for all your hard
work!!  And thank all of *you* who were there and made the night even more
special for me!  To Amy S., Brian Darkness, Reagan Reid, and Black Adder
(*fabu* visuals!): it was great to finally meet you guys - y'all were even
more wonderful in person than I'd imagined!  And, of course, it was a
far-out experience meeting Vince (thanks 4 the laminate!)...  And my how I
ramble.  WEll, from my friends Janice (the Cat in the Hat), Troy (in gold
evening dress n' boots), and myself, to you: a big *huh* and a bouquet of
warm fuzzies.  Peace

PS Sorry I missed you Mr. Tiger - we got lost and were late.

I found a snazzy black velvet hat on the ground Sat night.  It was by the
striped canopy tent next to the Ambient area.  I asked around but nobody
claimed it.  Let me know if you lost it or know who did.

Thank you Ethan for making it possible for Phelps and I to attend.

Thank you Ethan for your incredible set.  I have never seen a dj consciously
share energy with the crowd the way you did.  It was totally beautiful and
Phelps and I were truely impressed.

Thank you Vince for the laminate.

Thank you Vince for piercing my reality with your eyes, reaching down and
grabbed my soul and showing me I was in the presence of family.

Thank you Andrew (I don't know the name you go by for your music) for your
amazing live set.  You surely know you anchor the light to this planet and
spread it amongst us all.  Phelps thanks you for being the light being you
are. It was funny cuz it took her several minutes before she could talk or
really function normally after you finished....and to think she almost
missed your set while doing her anthropological study on ambient space.

Thank you Amy S. for the sfraver introduction overload.  Hello to all those
that I met.

Thank you dj MinorMinor for parking and not puking (sp).  Sorry I missed
your set.

Thank you Seth for sharing your story with Phelps and I.  We like you.

I could keep going, but I won't keep you.  Once again thank you.  I love you
all.

Mail*Link(r) SMTP               Halloween Tips


Good Advice from Nick Stern for you halloweeners
NICK:  I added one at the bottom.

* Never read a book of demon summoning aloud, even as a joke.

* Do not search the basement, especially if the power has just gone out.

 * When it appears that you have killed the monster, *never* check to see
if it's really dead.

* If you find that your house is built upon or near a cemetery, was once a
church that was used for black masses, had previous inhabitants who went
mad or committed suicide or died in some horrible fashion, or had
inhabitants who performed necrophilia or satanic practices in your house,
move away immediately.

* If your friends speak to you in Latin or any other language which they do
not know, or if they speak to you using a voice which is other than their
own, shoot them immediately.  It will save you a lot of grief in the long
run.
NOTE: It will probably take several rounds to kill them, so be prepared.

* When you have the benefit of numbers, *never* pair off or go it alone.

* As a general rule, don't solve puzzles that open portals to Hell.

* Never stand in, on, above, below, beside,or anywhere near a grave, tomb,
crypt, mausoleum, or other house of the dead.

* If you're searching for something which caused a noise and find out that
"it's just the cat," leave the room immediately if you value your life.

Well I haven't been gettin out much the last couple of months, but I'm 
happy I didn't miss the last sunset.  As usual a great vibe.  Sorry I 
missed fnf, but it was nice to pick up on the afterglow from those fnf 
attendies at sunset.
Galen started off with some nice ambient, which progressed into some 
nice upbeat sounds which got people dancing.
By the time garth came on I was in trance mode.  Oh the joy of sharing 
the energy.
I left before Phil Smart came on, feeling good from a good hard dance 
session which I havin't been doing to much lately.
Thanks to everyone who has contributed to all the wonderful sunset 
parties this year.  I think its time for me to now get more into indoor 
mode, lazers, other visuals, tight well connected indoor vibes on the 
dance floor, and lots of sweat (yummee).

        I think that people need to realize that just because there is an 
Methamphetamine trail in the 3,4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine molecule does not
mean that it is automatically a precursor chemical to it.  I may be wrong (and 
if I am I will be mighty red in the face) but after doing years of research on 
XTC I have never seen or heard references to it being made with Ephedrine or 
Amphetamine or Methamphetamine.  The most common method is to combine Piperonal 
acetone and Methylamine to reach the desired goal.  Now if we had said 
Methylamine is a precursor for XTC I would have agreed totally, and yes 
Methylamine is a precursor for MethAmphetamine as well.  It is what gives you 
the Meth and the Amine in the Methamphetamine.  
        Is there somebody out there that can elaborate a little more 
scientifically on this subject?

I have found Harthouse releases to be majorly spotty.  Like, you'll find 
something great but there will be 10 other mediocre to just plain bad releases 
for every good one.  Unfortunately, I can't think of anything off the top of my 
head BUT...Rising High (another label) has either 4 or 5 compilations out called
"The Secret Life of Trance."  These are all HIGHLY recommended if you like acidy
dark trancey techno with some housey influences thrown in for good measure.

Now, a word on the import versus domestic versions of these:  The UK versions of
these Rising High comps usually come out on 3 or 4 slices of vinyl or two CDs.  
Instinct, a US label, has re-issued these domestically BUT they did a 
slice-and-dice job on them.  What I mean is that they'll take one of the UK 
"Secret Life of Trance" comps and carve it up into two separate CDs, with some 
overlapping tracks and some altogether missing tracks.  So, I prefer getting the
UK issues because they're more complete.  I've had good luck getting these at 
Mod Lang in Berkeley.  I'm sure Rasputnin's has them too.  I've seen the 
Instinct US versions at Tower Records on Market in SF.

     Ob. F&F statements:
     
        1)  I've been saying for years (well, 2 of them) that the music 
     Ethan spins should ideally be heard at 3:00 am in a warehouse lit by a 
     blue intellabeam.  Well, F&F went one better, providing a green laser 
     instead.  It was killer!  Thanks to everyone that made it happen.
     
        2)  Who was playing that spaced out alien dub music?  Where can I 
     get a CD comp for home use?  Please make a recommendation!  I'm 
     specifically looking for the 
     dub-outer-space-noises-from-beyond-proxima-centauri sound.
     
        3)  alt.carpet.the.earth
     
     Went record shopping Sunday, this time to Frequency 8 in the Haight.  
     Major points to the store set-up:  the turntables with attached 
     mini-crates are very classy.  And instead of providing someone's 
     ancient beat-up 1200 and a blown amp to listen through, there's all 
     new gear.  Very classy.  Good coverage of trance/acid labels, although 
     the current stock seemed lacking in US releases.  But then maybe US 
     releases/labels have been lacking lately?  I'm a bit out of touch.
     
     I listened to 33 records (bought 8) and have a few things to say about 
     the current state of trance/acid trance.
     
     First, it's really good to see so many labels still supporting the 
     genre.  I saw several releases from Time Unlimited (a German label).  
     The very first time I bought records as a DJ (mid-1992) I got 
     something from Time Ulimited, and I hadn't seen much from them in the 
     intervening years.  I guess they're on a comeback.
     
     However, I was disappointed by the number of mediocre tunes I 
     encountered.  I fear that trance could be stagnating as a genre.  If 
     it stagnates, it will go the way of hardcore (i.e. become a fondly 
     remembered thing of the past).  So many tracks are using big swirly 
     string buildups, it seems a bit saccharine.  Similarly, there were a 
     large number of numbingly non-descript acid noodles.  The genre needs 
     to sound innovative and fresh if it's going to survive.  Another thing 
     that hit me was that the old "Waldorf" buzzy sound and the famed 
     "Belgian hoover" noises are coming back...1991 techno sounds that 
     sound cheezy and dated now.  I heard a few records that sounded good 
     until they broke into buzzy cheeze sounds.  Sigh.
     
     That said, it should be noted that there was good stuff in there too, 
     so all is definately not lost.  October is usually a bad month for 
     european techno, anyway:  so many people take off the entire month of 
     August that it takes until November for fresh sounds to start coming 
     through the pipeline.  One particularly interesting thing I noticed 
     was a combination of Detroit-style machine sounds with the faster, 
     lusher German trance style.  The sharp "clean" noises were there, but

Hello everyone:

I'm new on the SF scene and I wanted to say hello to everyone.  I'll keep 
this brief: I love raves, I haven't been to one since I moved here, and 
I miss them!  Hopefully there'll be a party this weekend?

Chris.

I know that everybody and their mother has already posted about what went on
at F&F, but I have to say that it was especially important to me.  I hadn't
been out in a couple of months, mostly due to the fact that some part of me
just didn't feel that warm happy feeling I got all summer when I went to
raves.  I think a lot of it had to do  with the fact that I was going to
some of the larger venues, forgetting how much easier it is to meet people
and create a sense of community at smaller gatherings.  It was a big healing
proccess for me, because it really made me remember what raving is all
about.  I went with a fantabulous group of people that I kept seeing all
night, and their smiling faces kept me smiling, too.  I also ran into a lot
of people I hadn't seen for a looong time (some not since my first rave),
many new people that I'm looking forward to seeing again, and a few really
good friends that I'd lost touch with.

I guess I'd kind of forgotten how easy it is to just walk up to people and
say hi.  At some of the larger parties it's easier said than done (I wish it
wasn't like that, but it is).  Thank you to everyone I went with, especially
Wayne for the ticket, Amy for being a super friend, and Greg's uncle for
letting us have a killer space to party in.

Thanks y'all,
Jake

I am taking the liberty of forwarding this posting about the effort to
maintain 924 Gilman as an independent music and cultural space.  I'll
let the posting speak for itself, but as someone who came along when
independent music-making and performances were even harder to pull off
than now, this is an important issue.  Part of my musical history was
the early punk days in Washington, DC (chronicled in the early part
of the book Banned in DC), where bands like the Bad Brains got their
beginning in places like Madam's Organ on 18th St NW.  Punk long ago
ossified, in my view, but there is a need for that scene and any other
where independence of expression and enjoyment are supported.  And as
Ethan and I and a couple of others can attest from a stellar event
at 924 Gilman a couple of years ago, where Garth just blew the doors
off the way he almost never does these days, that location is also 
emblematic as a haven for our kind of dance music as well.  

Enough of my posturing, here's the post . . .

Subject: 924 Gilman Street Press Release


Due to the large number of requests for this, I am sending this out to
the whole sf-list mailing list.  

The new date of The Zoning Board meeting is now 7:15pm, November 13, 1995
at the Berkeley City Hall.

Members from 924 Gilman are planning to meet before the meeting at 6:45pm
on the steps of the Berkeley City Hall.

For more info, call the 924 Gilman Street info line at 510-525-9926.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

For Immediate Release: October 22, 1995

Berkeley, CA

924 Gilman Street is in jeopardy.  The only consistently all-ages, alcohol
free youth center in the bay area, best known as the premier underground
punk venue in the nation, is threatened by an out-of-state brewery's plan
to open an upscale bar and restaurant directly across the street.  The
project, which is currently under review by the Berkeley Zoning Board,
includes plans for a 250-seat restaurant/bar, a 100,000 sq. ft. brewery,
and only 70 indoor parking spaces.

924 Gilman is run by youth for youth.  Anyone who wants to get involved
can. In addition to being the breeding ground for such current acts as
GREEN DAY, OFFSPRING, RANCID, and JAWBREAKER, it is a volunteer-run
collective, which has existed in the same location since 1986.  Besides
being an important stop on the international d.i.y. (do-it-yourself) music
circuit, Gilman has hosted amateur theater, spoken word, art shows,
self-defense courses and numerous political and community benefits over the
years.  No bands on major labels are allowed to play.  924 Gilman actively
opposes racism, sexism and  homophobia.  Its low prices, informal
atmosphere, and commitment to a fun, safe, alcohol and drug free space for
local youth has created a strong sense of community among otherwise
alienated kids.  The sense of accompishment that youth gain is unparalleled
in the bay area.

We only oppose the proposed large bar and restaurant: we welcome the jobs
that the proposed brewery will bring to this low-income industrial section
of Berkeley.  The irony of local residents being unable to afford the
restaurant/bar's prices (aka gentrification) is one of many concerns,
including massive problems with traffic, parking, drunk driving, and
potential culture clashes.  We also question the wisdom of putting a bar
directly across the street from a community center that actively
discourages alcohol and drug use.

Increased police presence and both wealthy businesses and young,
upwardly-mobile clientele clamoring for a more upscale dining and drinking
environment will quickly spell the end for 924 Gilman's unique community
center.  Our current location was chosen for its relative isolation from
retail and residential neighborhoods, thereby allowing our alternative
community to thrive.

The Zoning Board meets to discuss this issue Monday, Novermber 13, 1995, at
7:15 in the Berkeley City Hall.

Maybe you've seen it, but there's an Article on Astral Matrix, live
performer at Friends & Family Sat. night, in #18 of XLR8R.

It's very flattering, as it should be.  :^)

Peace y'all!

Tony

P.S.  Data still being processed for a personal review on the party.
Describing how I feel as "Blown away" would be too passive, "permanent
smile" would be too fleeting, "warm and fuzzy inside" would lack proper
tactile description.  I'll think of it...

Precedence: bulk

For reasons of my own I chose Funky Tekno Tribe over Friends
and Family.  (Don't worry, I'll make the next one...)  

Although it was true that there were a lot of newbies at this party
and people who are still pretty confused about themselves and how
to share energy to build a vibe, it is also true that Funky Tekno
Tribe threw an awesome party.  In fact, part of my reason for choosing
this party is to confront unfocused energy like this and find the
strength within me to focus into an incredible experience.  It is
how I grow strong and increase my will and conviction.  It is also
very hard sometimes, and a challenge, because you have to trust yourself
and your beleifs in the face of despair... but you always come through.
and in the end, you know who you are to a depth you were never aware of
before.  You have also steered all those unfocused people towards
a coherence that will bring them closer to themselves.  This is how
people will come to understand, through the healing of their confusion.
And when all those people start losing their fear and start giving 
themselves, all that energy will come back to you.

and I really admire Funky Tekno Tribe... because of this same reason.
All these people searching for pieces of themselves they don't think 
they have, running around in circles, alone and afraid.
but FTT stood there undeterred in their mission.  No amount of confusion
will shake them from their vision, and they press on, healing and
healing...
With wicked music and a beautiful light show.  A perfectly balanced
sound system, just rocking the house.  Actually the sound was really
well done... Totally crisp and clean, powerful without hurting your
ears, and with just enough bass to keep your bones vibrating.  
Same with the ambient area, which was actually much more of a jungle
area... but I liked it.
I liked it a lot.  True, it's probably not as much fun as Friends
and Family, but the benefits for me were well worth it.  Seeing all
those people inspired by the dance and the pierce of your gaze
is reason enough for me to feel all that pain.  I had an incredible
night.  so for me now, shaken, but never deterred, I press on, smile
in hand.

be seeing you...
-john.

Peruvian Whistling Vessels

                                ...the Doorway Re-opens 

                                      by Don Wright


Millennia ago, a technology was born that was to continue being a part of a 
people's life for over two thousand years. A discovery utilizing sound that 
could transport human beings into a new and unique realm 
of experience...possibly to other worlds of existence. This sound was not 
music, but instead a special toning of whistles which, when blown together 
with other such vessels, had the ability to induce what has been
described as a "trance state of a spiritual nature." The sound was produced 
by a clay instrument which was such a personally treasured item to its owner, 
that it was not passed on to another person when he or she died,
but followed the owner to the grave. 

After being part of the life of two thousand years of generation after 
generation of people, the "technology" apparently was abruptly stopped and 
hidden when their land was invaded and conquered in 1532 AD. 

Peruvian whistling vessels are instruments of sound, tuned, not by 
electronically controlled measuring and adjusting mechanisms, but by 
utilizing an innate expanded human sensing ability. While it is an ability 
which we all have, few realize or consciously experience this state. This 
particular sense is one which may be closely described as a perception 
resulting from a mixing or blending together of several senses (synesthesia), 
so that they become a single new sensory input. 

The toning of the vessels is such, that one does not hear music when several 
vessels from one of the originating cultures are blown together, but rather 
is "shifted" into another realm and state of being for the duration of the
whistling session. 

The first experience of this is often recognized as being familiar, yet new. 
It seems to include a profound enjoyment of an emotional/kinesthetic/sound 
creation which one not only shares in creating, but also essentially
becomes. An awareness also seems to develop of the participation of other 
beings, not of our material world, yet clearly kindred in spirit. When within 
this realm, timeflow awareness, self-observation, past and future
preoccupation, constant internal self-dialogue, and instinctual concerns such 
as hunger, thirst, or sexual desire clearly diminish. 

The effect of the vessels may, in fact, be the only existing doorway to this 
beautiful and intensely profound type of experience that doesn't require 
altering the body chemistry with an ingested entheogen (shamanic
inebriant such as peyote, ayahuasca, psilocybin mushrooms, etc.). Because 
there is no lingering substance in the body, shortly after the whistling 
session has stopped, everyone returns to their pre-experience state,
beautifully enriched by the memory of what happened. 

For several seconds, to usually less than five minutes, after the session, 
most people realize an empathetic and almost sibling feeling for other people 
in the group, even though they may all be complete strangers. Most
people also discover a heightened enjoyment and appreciation of sound, humor, 
and softness in speaking. After a few minutes I have, upon occasion, ended 
the silence which follows a vessel session,m by playing a recording of 
Pachebel's Cannon in D, frequently observing one or more members 
of the group crying with joy in the beauty of the music. 

"Where in the world did they come from?" "What did the people who made them 
use them for?" "Why, after two thousand years of making them, would they 
suddenly stop?" These are questions often asked when I present a set of 
vessels. They originated in pre-Columbian Peru. As to how they used them, and 
why they stopped, we don't know. The vessels, made by those pre-Columbian 
cultures in Peru, appear to have been personal, treasured possessions, even 
to the extent of being placed into the grave with its owner. There has
even been speculation that extraterrestrial tehnological contributions to 
ancient these Peruvian cultures which could possible alsobe reflected ib the 
vessels. 

I find it profound that a people, culture after culture, through two thousand 
years of making and having whistling vessels as part of their life, would 
abruptly cease making and using them. They stopped making them
when the Spanish conquered their land around 1532 AD. 

Not only did the Spanish--who kept copious records of the cultures they 
conquered--not mention the vessels, but the Peruvians themselves did not, in 
any way we have yet discovered, create images of the vessels and their
use. Because of this, we don't have a clue as to how or why they were used. 
Recent research, however, has proven that the vessels were in fact finely 
tuned, with each culture having it's own primary frequency around
which the culture's vessels were tuned. Because of the difficulty of such 
precision tuning, it is only rational to assume that the whistle was not a 
novelty afterthought in a drinking pot, a theory often proposed in scientific
articles about vessels of this period. 

We don't have language sufficient to describe the experience of the vessels, 
or scientific knowledge of its precise method. I have tried to describe it 
somewhat in this article, but my only tools to accomplish this are
metaphors which barely carry the same "flavor or feeling tone" of the 
experience itself. While similar to an "out-of-body" or hallucinogenic 
experience, analogies simply do not exist. Someone might say that an aspect of
the experience is "being in an ocean of experience when a wind of sound, 
physical feeling, and emotion drifts over and enters your body flowing 
inside, and then moves out and on to somewhere else." This makes writing
or talking about the vessels quite difficult. 

A PERUVIAN WHISTLING SESSION 

Participants at a typical "whistling session" as we call them, might be 
described as sober, non-altered people of different age, education, 
experience, physical condition, etc., often  strangers to one another. This 
group will sit down on the floor together in a close circle. After brief 
instructions, without any common goal, or clear expectation of what is about 
to happen, they put the spout of the clay pot they are holding to their 
mouthes and blow into them, creating a unique "whistle." They blow 
continuously from forty-five minutes to hours without a break, doing nothing 
else, with nothing else occurring in the room. 

The "participants" usually will be completely surprised about the length of 
time they were blowing the vessel, and will feel deep gratitude for having 
had the experience, often expressing regret that it is over. I can't recall
one group process, other than a Peruvian Whistling session, that commands the 
absolute attention, without cough, without quiet whispered remarks or 
conversation between participants, without spontaneous sighs, yawns, 
stretches, or looking about, for even a fraction of the time most 
groups blow the vessels. 

Daniel Statnekov, a wealthy antique collector, after being told this was a 
rare artifcat at an auction, purchased a special vessel, which was ultimately 
to have a profound affect upon his life. He discovered their special
capability, and developed a way to reproduce them. Statnekov was, in my 
opinion, selected through a very special whistling vessel whose mission was 
to bring vessels once again into human experience. 

The vessel, wending its way for over four hundred years, from person to 
person, avoiding being broken or lost, century after century, finally reached 
the point in time and space where it would intersect with the path of a
"reincarnated Peruvian Whistling Vessel O'Sensei", a person who was most 
perfectly suited in all ways to restore the existence of the vessels into 
human experience. 

This point in time and space was at an estate auction on the East Coast. The 
rest of this story can be found in Statnekov's book: Animated Earth, by 
Daniel K. Statnekov (North Atlantic Books, CA, ISBN
1-55643-000-0). 

I met Daniel during my studies at Boston College, where I was studying 
psychology and theology. My interest and direction of study was to discover, 
understand, and utilize techniques of consciousness self-manipulation
and control. This interest was instrumental in my discovery of a set of 
vessels that Daniel Statnekov had made and given to Professor Baer, a 
psychology professor whom I greatly admired. Professor Baer "presented" the
vessels to a gathering of people that I attended. At this gathering, and my 
first experience of the vessels, a recognition of, and bond with, the vessels 
occurred for me that would ultimately result in my becoming a vessel
maker. 

Since my apprenticeship with Daniel in the northern mountains of New Mexico 
in 1980, where he passed on to me his tools, molds and spiritually charged 
clay, I have been growing in my understanding and ability to create
the vessels. 

I am tremendously excited about having the boundaries of our world, once 
again, expanded and redefined by experiences of these incredible instruments. 
Peruvian whistling vessels, unavailable to human experience for
hundreds of years, have once again entered our lives. New Frontier has made 
arrangements with Don Wright to conduct a National Peruvian Whistling week, 
September 16-22 (4 hrs daily whistling) at the Nepal Institute in

Of course it rocked my world til I almost fell off!
Andrew, Tracy, and Ethan stand out in my mind as just indescribable 
heaven weavers. o-my-god!!
I was transported back into time when Michael showed the Burning Man 
footage.  I felt such a connection with people who went - they felt like 
*FAMILY*. I was happy that those who didn't go got the chance to see some 
of what it was like. To all the wonderful sfravers I met for the first time: 
Starchild, Thursday, Gerard(?the cow guy?) John from Canada, and Noel 
from New Mexico, & RobertJ, not to mention all my sfrave friends who I 
already know.  Friends & Family. That says it all! :):):):)

I was only disappointed in 2 things:
1. It got *way* too hot and stuffy 
inside.  I didn't want to stop dancing, but I had to as I couldn't 
breathe! If there is better ventilation, I can dance longer and not miss 
anybody's set.
2. I got tired rather quickly.  My energy can be very unpredictible.  I'm 
just now getting over a cold and as much as I wanted to stay inside and 
dance all night, my body said NO NO NO!! :(  So I made the most of it and 
lounged in that CUSHY ambient area (the big one).  I did like the smaller 
ambient area too, the dj's played some most interesting things.  
Sometimes I felt like I was being told a story and it would get very 
mellow, then a loud screaming sound would suddenly rip through the air 
and scare the shit out of me - I loved it! 

Then we went out to the last Sunset party out at Pt. Volate and I met up 
with some nw-raves friends of mine from Seattle & Vancouver BC.  They 
went to FTT though. The music was great as usual and it got rather chilly 
once the sun set.  Whatdaya expect - November is practically here! :) So 
I'm glad I didn't miss the last one of the year.  Well, til the next 
party, I'll say bye for now!

love,
Amy

hello all,
	This is so fun to talk to everyone about music. I wanted to say 
how awesome F&F was, and to thank purple Tiger for coming through with 
tickets so that me and all of my friends could get in. If you saw me, I 
was the guy dressed as a Hierophant...sparkly hat...Big fluffy star 
necklace...and a red and blue robe, my best friend and girlfriend was 
with me and she was dressed as a ballerina...as we do not wish to promote 
excessive toxicity in our bodies we tried to keep the energy level up by 
using a more natural Ma Huang, balck tea and ginseng mixture, which 
worked pretty well...altough w couldnt stay going all night we stayed up 
till about 4:00 until going to sleep...the only effect that bothered me 
was whaen I went to sleep I woke up later drenched in sweat 
(?)...anyhow...the party was great...good people, good vibe!
	To muse a little on music...I spent the better part of an hour at 
the new store F 8 on saturday...It is a really nice place...The listening 
stations are very nice and the store guy is really nice and helpful and 
spins some groovy stuff.. He must ahve recommended me 10 records, I 
finally decided onJuno Reactor...beyond the infinite...What I really 
discovered is that from now on I will buy vinyl unless there are alot of 
vocals...before F&F I listened to it at 45 rpm...like the record says, it 
is great stuff, worked welll to get me hyped for the evening...then when 
I came home and was ready to soothe my ears a bti ...I played it at 33 
1/3 rpm andit came off great as a nice ambient chill tune!
	Unfortunately I cant write too much for a bit since I found out 
today that there are 2 midterms for me next week...I should pay more 
attention to the syllabi! but oh well...until next time.

-Hierophant, (I go by tony...but since someone else is already tony on 
this list, to avoind confusion i will just alias myself ashierophant:)

Tonight at 10:30 MTV is reporting on Herbal e, maybe they'll include
the segments shot in SF featuring our own Brian D.?  Also there's an
article about H.e. in Newsweek.

-Amazing sets by Ethan and Andrew!
-Visuals that made me happy by themselves...the burning man videos and 
  the laser just over our heads were excellent!
-The upbeat ambient area was great with the huge bed w/ bean bags and killer 
  tunes to match
-Awesome, friendly people...it was great to meet everybody, everybody was 
  so happy, I was so tired from dancing so much and having to work all day 
  but you all cheered me up!  By the way I was the cow...Ferdinand the Bull

I hope we have many more FnF's to come!!
Thanks to all the people who gave their time and energy to setup and make 
it go off!

Hi, I'm Tim Gotch, from Monterey, CA (the place that is really cold right
now). I've been lurking for several months now, not having an amazing
amount to contribute 'cause I don't make it up to the SF parties much. But,
fortunately, I was at Fnf, one of the best parties of the year. You may
have met me there, because I was checking tickets outside for the first two
hours. I was wearing a Fnf T-shirt, a lot of tattoos and a hysterical
smile.
Down in Monterey, we have our own little collective that I try to help out
with, the Cloud Factory, of which Drenalin, Tim Mcknew, Cloud, Deaks, Elmo
and many others are a part of. CF does most of it's stuff during the
summer, so hopefully I'll be getting up to the Bay area more this winter. I
really want to check out MAD one of these Mondays.
On the personal side, I'm about 6'2", have alot of tattoos, spend almost as
much time at goth clubs as I do at raves, and play in a band with Tim
McKnew called Angel Bait. I go to college full time, work, make music and I
don't really have a social life outside of music stuff. I survive by
programming HTML and editing ad copy for a graphic design firm that a
friend of mine runs in Monterey.
Friends and Family was an experience, to say the least. On the way up from
Monterey, we watched a huge fire near the highway in Castroville, and it
seemed to be an omen that the night was going to be unusual. At the party,
I didn't actually get inside until Tracy had started spinning, but she was
great and really helped to get my energy up for the rest of the night.
Andrew was amazing, but I missed Ethan's set for reasons beyond my control.
I did catch Tim McKnew's set outside in one of the ambient areas, and even
though I have heard him spin many times, he managed to suprise me as
always. After Tim's set, I wandered around and while I couldn't name anyone
in particular, everything I heard was great. Fell asleep for an hour or so,
then awoke to the fine sounds of Allen Ameba (I think) who was just to the
left of my car. Then switched between Jon Carel and the gabber guy for the
final sets. A beautiful experience all in all and I hope that there are
many more to come. Much love and thanks to everyone there.
Well, I think I've run my mouth enough, so I end here. Hope to meet each
and every one of you that I haven't already.

Love
Tim G.

I haven't done much shopping at single genre shops, but I usually have to 
go through atleest 100 records to find 8 that are worth buying. I realy 
wouldn't be to worried about the state of trance. IMHO I don't think 
there ever has been any "genre" of music that has been spared from an 
overwelming number of mediocre releases.

Hello everybody,

Thanks for the many offers of rides for Felix.  I appreciate it VERY
MUCH!!!  I hope that those of you that offered were able to make it to
the party and had a stupendous time.

And thanks to Janet...a newbie raver...who did the deed in the end.

He said he hasn't played or been to an old school rave in a while.  Thank
you FnF for showing off what the underground scene can do.

It is nice to make more of a connection between the clubby, loungey scene
and the rave community I love so much.

love,

Ann

 Isn't Club F/X in San Jose having a final DJ night tonight ? I think
it's part of the events they're having prior to closing for good. 

  I have fond memories of the house/techno nights there ( called 
"Motion" (???) ) , and I plan to be there tonight , if it's happening.
Anybody know who the DJs are going to be?

 You other Santa Cruz and South Bay folks - have fun at the S.C. Civic
tonight!

Oh yes.. Motion with Loren and Rick Preston.  That summer of '94 was 
great for me too!  I wish I could make it but I can't.  argh.  The 
dancing shoes are getting too dusty lately.  I find myself dancing to the 
sounds of the fax machine while peaking on my morning coffee buzz.  It's 
actually very refreshing, if you fancy such simple pleasures...

Oh yea, I forgot to mention how much I liked the music that the fist dj
(Alex?) was spinning.  It was totally crazy weird shit.  Really hard with
really strange sounds, I guess like hard Aphex stuff.  It made me bug out
and dance into really contorted positions.  It was the first time I really
let go and had the music take over my movements in a long time.  I loved it.

I didn't see God Saturday nite, but I did get a page...  Something 
about faith, I think.  What's an atheist to do when confronted by a Higher 
Power?

Thanks to PT for the ride, everyone who put it together and all the nice 
people there.  You're the goodest.

And best wishes to everyone.

David

p.s. There should be a good sound system in the Castro tonight.

Hi all,

  Listen up ambient afficiandos--there's a new album being released on
  November 7, called "Original Soundtracks 1" by The Passengers.  It's
  actually a collaborative effort by Brian Eno (whose music gave birth
  to the term 'ambient' back in the 1970's) and the four members of U2,
  complete with a vocal opera loop laid down by Luciano Pavarotti...hmmm
  I know the link to rave culture here is a tenuous one--just thought  
  some of you might be interested :) ...

  I had a great time at Friends and Family this weekend--it was nice to 
  see so many of you again.  One of my friends got sick and needed to leave, 
  though, so my night was cut a little short.  Too bad I didn't get to dance
  to John Carel and Dave Bayer, although I did manage to catch Ethan's and 
  Tracy's sets, which were absolutely *driving*  
  Thanks again to Ethan and F&F; I'll see everyone again (I hope) at 
  the Gateway party on the 17th!

trick-or-treat,
Timothy

	Greg asked me to forward this...

From: Gregory Sandler <ascend@ix.netcom.com>

Hello everyone,

    Well, if you live in the south bay and want an alternative from the 
civic center tonight, try the Requiem Rite Halloween Party. I don't 
have a lot of info on the party, but it sounds pretty good. 

    I know that Micheal Clay as well as Craig Larson will be doing 
visuals, So be prepared to have your mind melted!!!! There are going to 
be intellabeams and lasers (I have no clue who is providing them). Also 
this party is supposed to be transmitted over live public access t.v. 
(just for you people who have ever wanted to be a movie star! :) 

    Some of the performers are:
            
            Ajoe(sorry if I misspelled it)
            
            Greg Sandler (Harmony Prod.)(That's me-A dancing crayon)
            
            Dionysus Dreams (has done passed ambient rooms for          
                                Harmony/Beautiful People parties)
             
            + Many others that I really can't remeber(I don't have a    
           flyer in front of me.

    Anyways, it should be pretty fun. It goes from around 7-7:30 until  
2-2:30. The admission is $10 (I think). And the location is the 
Palucaville in Santa Cruz. It's off Pacific Ave. (Downtown) Some Info 
nubers are (408)427-8436 and (408)454-0600


    Well, have a spooky night wherever you go!!!!!! C-ya


Peace,

Greg :)

Jim Cyr of Frequency 8 will be spinning tonight at Club Bahia in
San Francisco.  His slot is 10-11pm.  The club is located at
the corner of Franklin and Market.  I believe cover will be about $5 but I
am not absolutely positive.

Come out and enjoy a Halloween party with a Brazilian flair.

FYI: This will be a mostly gay event but all are very welcome to attend.

hugs
mike

This weekend United Systems will be doing another party like the one on 
the 14th of October. I don't know who is spinning thogh I suppose it will 
be at least me and Jack Acid (I haven't talked to the driving force 
behind this one yet). Oh yeah, it's Jack's birthday party. It will not be 
a comfy party but it most likely will be exciting - hard trance and 
hardcore in an exotic location that probably has never been used before.

 well , I called the club , and the pre-recorded message had something
about a costume contest and Pearl Jam ticket give-aways , so I may
not be going to that after all...

Hello all - Happy Halloweeeen

I got a few requests for more info on this stuff so here it goes..

The product is called:  New Attitude and is a performance tonic
basically it is a combination of Eastern and Western herbs, fruit extracts,
vitamins, and amino acids

 Contains(not a total list):
    in purified water, Siberian ginseng, Chinese red ginseng, echinacea
pupurea, echinacea angustifolia, licorice and chickory root, burdock root,
wood betony, black walnut hulls, fo-ti, rose petals  :), cloves, honey, rose
hips, potassium somethin'-or-other(6 different kinds of K) , lemon jucie,
apple extract, oganic boron, etc, etc, etc, the list goes on

Distributed exclusively by Results Inc. of Pleasanton Ca. (my home town)

The Performance tonic story: ( From the side of the bottle)
"...the Chinese have focused much of their medical practice towards the
treatment of "chi", the vital life force that flows through our
body....Today, many Western herbal scientists have disscovered what the
Chinese have known for years, that tonic herbs help the body take care of its
self...." talks about the blending of 33 herbs and organic compounds

Well the stuff works in every day usage by giving the recipient extra "will"
or energy throughout the day.  I feel almost happy and wired after doubling
or tripling the daily dosage before a rave.  I took some before FTT and
danced..for almost the whole eight hours I was there.  I know people who quit
smoking after using the product 

Well if there are any more questions you can call me and I will either answer
them or direct you to some one who can.

Thanks for the time   Austin

Hello fellow sfravers!!!

Well I have been hearing all the good about FnF and what I missed out on but
I did get out of the house this weekend to FTT.   FTT put on a good party
considering that there were a lot of newbies and there were a lot o people.
 
I've been bored at work and had a lot of time so I've done a lot of net
browsing.  I found a page that gives free homepages
http://www.geopages.com/cgi-bin/main/homestead
 if you wanna check it out.

I have no experience at building pages but I put one together on this server
and would like to know any feed back if possible:
      http://www.geopages.com/SunsetStrip/1907/
                (netscape enhanced)
and  "                    "                     "           /1906/
for more on FTT and XNTRKX
Thank you all - 
                                  ~|_e_/'

we set the stage: 
porch with cloth hanging from f-n-f (yes, definitely still holding the vibe
with every stray strand that flies in the wind), black lights irradiating
the glow in the dark spider nestled in his web, and that damn huge pumpkin
with the f-n-f grin from ear to pumpkin ear with nothing else but nag
champa sprewing an odor of delightfulness to the senses inviting the
trick-or-treaters down the chosen path  (you have to understand we live in
a house behind a house so we must invite the gobblins down the driveway to
visit us).  some say ooooo... that pumpkin smells strange, and some say
what's that smell,  but what stands out the most?  weird blinking lights
spinning an entrancing web of aural ecstacy toward the street, beckoning
the little kiddies to their DOOM!!!!!! 
 
wbl - we KNEW there was a reason! 
 
 
peace&positivity,

The combination of certain pure, steady tones has long been known
as an interesting way to tweak mental state.

Combine this with threshold hyperventilation caused by blowing these
Tibetan whistles and you can _really_ alter yourself.

More recently, La Monte Young has done some very interesting soundscapes 
using this technique -- playing many high harmonics of the same fundamental
through many speakers simultaneously, resulting in a thick sonic
texture that changes radically as you move throughout the room and
sounds cancel or reinforce each other.  Cool stuff.  I'd like to do a 
one-off chill night like this if I had the time.

In many of my ambient works I have tried to set up a soundscape entirely
made of changing texture, without any sudden 'events'.  This is in radical
opposition to the keyboard-driven MIDI triggering of most electronic music,
and can trigger a serious mental trip if played in the right set and 
setting.  Strangely, I don't experience feelings of peacefulness and inner
harmony after listening to my own music -- I feel like I have fallen back
from the threshold of lycanthropic change, and return to my body somewhat
bemused.  Weird, eh?  I guess I have not achieved samadhi yet.

Enough rambling,

Hey all,

I heard there was a good party in the Humboldt area.  Does anyone have 
any info on this or any future parties up there?  I'll be moving there 
in the fall and would like to be involved with the spread of the House 
scene in that part of the world.

love chris
