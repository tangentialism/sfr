The liberals "conserve" withholding attack
while the conservatives make war to "liberate" Iraq
quite hypocritical... as it would seem
but we just say the words, not what we mean
don't give in to nobody, unless we're gettin' a deal
capitialize on misfortune, think and don't feel
but hey we're protecting the inocent and seting them free
we're saving the world, but the world don't agree
we're setting the pace, of how you should live
we've redifined what a dictator is
America, more than meets the eye
America, bureaucrats in desguise
America, always lighting up the skies
America, ploting our own dimise

Subject: [sfraves] [NRR]Why?

Why is it when a person sees some one they know (personally) on the side
of the road with car problems they just drive by and then the next day
ask if everything is all right? I just listened to a woman next to me in
the office tell someone she saw them on the side of the road on her way
home and she is sitting and asking if the other person is okay. My
personal opinion that is pretty damn fucked up. I don't mind if someone
I know drives by when I am stuck just don't tell me you saw me on the
side of the road. If you are that compassionate to ask of someone's well
being the next day then why didn't you stop and at least offer to let
someone use your cell phone or give them a ride to the gas station at
the next exit. Sorry just had to vent; fucking morons I tell you. Clear
your conscious by asking of a persons well being the next day. Peace

I am not exactly sure what this means, but I think it sort of relates
to yesterday's Dilbert:

Catbert: "I am going to start spending more time critizing things I don't
understand.  I say we flat-tax the Kyoto treat all the way back to the
security council!"

the daily dillemma apalls me...i crave caffeine and my tea just isn't cutting it.  descend the office stairs, slip through ultra sleek glass doors, dodge piss puddles in the alley way, and i find myself struggling to decide where to spend my dollar:  do i support the independent cafe?  with its wonderfully greasy donuts and muffins and down to earth service and styrofoam cups?  or do i go to evil starbux in an attempt at saving the ozone, or at least not making any damage to it?  i'm curious--what would you do?

Subject: RE: [sfraves] nrr: styrofoam (sp?) or starbux

I'm addicted to Starbucks Chai, but only their downtown locations where
they make it strong.  For you though, get a reusable coffee mug
available at any gas station (and most coffee shops) and go to the
independent shop.  I don't drink much coffee and unfortunately for me
the only place nearby that has chai let alone good chai is starbucks.
Anyone looking to open up a coffee shop in the
Spear/Beale/Main/Folsom/Howard/Harrison area that has a good strong chai
latte please do as I don't like being addicted to Star Bucks Chai.

the daily dillemma apalls me...i crave caffeine and my tea just isn't
cutting it.  descend the office stairs, slip through ultra sleek glass
doors, dodge piss puddles in the alley way, and i find myself struggling
to decide where to spend my dollar:  do i support the independent cafe?
with its wonderfully greasy donuts and muffins and down to earth service
and styrofoam cups?  or do i go to evil starbux in an attempt at saving
the ozone, or at least not making any damage to it?  i'm curious--what
would you do?

Yes but as the history of lyrical music (hip hop, rock & roll etc.) would 
prove, you can complain just about anything as long as you make it rhyme, the 
logic is always secondary.

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Love math and *bored*? Hyperreal Number

Hyperreal number
http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperreal_numbers

"...The hyperreal numbers or nonstandard reals (usually denoted as *R) are
an extension of the real numbers R that adds infinitely large as well as
infinitesimal numbers to R. The study of these numbers, their functions
and properties is called nonstandard analysis which some find more
intuitive than standard real analysis..."

"... Properties

The hyperreals *R form an ordered field containing the reals R as a
subfield. Unlike the reals, the hyperreals do not form a metric space, but
by virtue of their order they carry an order topology.

The hyperreals are defined in such a way that every first-order logic
statement that uses basic arithmetic (the natural numbers, plus, times,
comparison) and quantifies only over the real numbers is also true if we
presume that they quantify over hyperreal numbers. For example, we can
state that for every real number there is another number greater than it:

        forall x in R : exist y in R : x < y

The same will then also hold for hyperreals:

        forall x in *R : exist y in *R : x < y

Another example is the statement that if you add 1 to a number you get a
bigger number:

        forall x in R : x < x + 1

which will also hold for hyperreals:

        forall x in *R : x < x + 1
..."

Serenity,

Karina

hyperrealism

hyperrealism (h=EC=B4per-r=EA=B4e-l=EEz=B4em) noun
An artistic style characterized by highly realistic graphic
representation.
- hy=B4perre=B4alist adjective & noun
- hy=B4perre=B4alist=B4ic adjective

Reality

The very definition of the real becomes: that of which it is possible to
give an equivalent reproduction. . . . The real is not only what can be
reproduced, but that which is always already reproduced. The hyperreal.
Jean Baudrillard (b. 1929), French semiologist. Simulations, pt. 2, "The
Hyperrealism of Simulation" (1983). Baudrillard goes on to say, "Reality
no longer has the time to take on the appearance of reality. It no longer
even surpasses fiction: it captures every dream even before it takes on
the appearance of a dream."

"Security is mostly a superstition.  It does not exist in nature, nor do 
the children of humans as a whole experience it.  Avoiding danger is no 
safer in the long run than outright exposure.  Life is either a daring 
adventure or nothing."
-Helen Keller

"Compassion is not a relationship between the healer and the wounded.  It's 
a relationship between equals.  Only when we know our own darkness well can 
we be present with the darkness of others.  Compassion becomes real when we 
recognize our shared humanity."
-Pema Chodron

Subject: [sfraves] fwd: "DETROIT" this Sunday Aug 3 w/ Domingo Yu! (bsp)

from: Woodward Posse (woodwardposse@yahoo.com)

Greetings from "DETROIT"!

Thank-you all who attended our past Sunday night parties in celebration of the musical contributions of the D'. As many of you know, we've been going strong through the summer with some truely great sets by our host and guest DJs. Since our start last May, we've honed our signature mix of funk, techno, hip hop, electro, garage rock, Motown, ghettotech and more to give all of our guests that tingly soul-infused feeling head-to-toe. 

This Sunday, we are graced by the timely return of maestro spinna Domingo Yu AKA DJ Chino. Domingo has spent years DJing in and around Detroit at several residencies, DJ battles, and underground cabarets. He has represented the Detroit Techno and hip hop sound around the US and the world from Taiwan and Austrailia to the UK and Spain. And he has shared the stage with such well known Detroit artists as techno legends Derrick May and Alan Oldham AKA DJ T-1000, hip hoppers Eminem, Royce the Five Nine, Cha Cha, Defari, Xzibit, reggae act Poison Dart and numerous spoken word performers, including Jessica Care Moore and the Last Poets and served as the longtime DJ for ledgenary midwest breakdancing crew K.H.A.O.S. (Krazy Hip hop Asiatic Old School Style). Read more about Domingo at his website here: http://domingoyu.com

Detroit is free, and starts at 9 every Sunday night at the Skylark, 3089 16st., San Francisco.

Thanks - The Woodward Posse

Subject: RE: [sfraves] nrr: styrofoam (sp?) or starbux

I want to plug my favorite small roaster and coffee shop...
Capricorn Coffee on 9th street at Harrison. Here in SF.

Starbucks employs a lot of artists, DJ's, producers and even plain old white
trash peeps.
Something to keep in mind, when trying to justify going to starfucks.
They (inadvertently) funnel money into our dance/art community economy.

I have to say that a lot of independents do not have good coffee.

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: Massages @ Jagan!

Hey SFR,
    In addition to the great ass-shakin, bass-pumpin music that will be on 
hand at Jagan, so to will the massage table! As it's been since the 
beginning, massages will be first-come, first serve and FREE. However, 
donations will be greatly appreciated and will find their way into one of 
the various donation jars located throughout the venue for Larkin Street 
Youth Center!

Hope to see a whole bunch of you SFR'ers tomorrow night!

"Security is mostly a superstition.  It does not exist in nature, nor do 
the children of humans as a whole experience it.  Avoiding danger is no 
safer in the long run than outright exposure.  Life is either a daring 
adventure or nothing."
-Helen Keller

"Compassion is not a relationship between the healer and the wounded.  It's 
a relationship between equals.  Only when we know our own darkness well can 
we be present with the darkness of others.  Compassion becomes real when we 
recognize our shared humanity."

Dam, I thought you guys said you postponed the party to add more talent? Sounds like a a load of of crap to me. Why not be honest, you postponed it cuzz you lost your venue. That much is obvious, I mean come on, a "massive" at Mission Rock............thats a joke. 
 
Oh, and unless they have changed their door policy which I highly doubt , Mission Rock is 21+, where's the mention of that? I didn't see anything about that in your bsp. So what's up for people under 21?

It comes from admin@yourdomain, claiming your email address is going to

I dunno which worm this is, but.

The BLF have struck once again. Here's the press release that was sent

Billboard Liberation Front
News on the March!
Date: August 1, 2003
Subject: Billboard Liberation Front Calls for Injunction against
Citizens
Against Lawsuit Abuse
From: Fred Demara

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Confidential-Destroy Before Reading


The Billboard Liberation Front Joins Trial Lawyers in the American Dream

"First thing we do, let's hire all the lawyers."

While some may argue that the American Dream is "Mom, baseball, and
apple
pie", Real Americans know that it's about something more than that; it's
about getting paid millions of dollars after losing your eye to a
defective
rectal thermometer, and eating delicious flourless cakes.

Today the BLF took an important stand against Corporate America and the
Anti-Torte Lobby by defending the public's right to trade their
appendages
for large cash settlements while eating tasty baked sweets.

It is certainly true that it is every American Corporation's God-given
right to skimp on safety or save on costs by dumping their toxic sludge
in
the neighborhood swimming hole, this should never be allowed to stand in
the way of our common hope of winning the lottery by being maimed by an
electric foot massager. Without such dreams, what do Real Americans
have to
strive for? And what will happen to our economy when consumers are
stripped
of their prime motivation to buy home leg-waxing kits or buy property
near
nuclear power plants?

And what can possibly be accomplished by restricting our access to
exquisitely dense chocolate decadence?

Finally, how can we turn our backs on the tiny percentage of attorneys
who
daily sacrifice themselves in the brave and noble pursuit of the deep
pocket? Do we really want to live in a nation where ambulances go
unchased?

Visit the BLF's improvements at TWO separate locations: 15th St @
Mission
and Noe St @18th.

The new BLF - working twice as hard to improve your perceptions on
advertising.

For more propaganda, please visit http://www.billboardliberation.com



The Billboard Liberation Front has been improving and enhancing the
Outdoor
Ad images of the biggest and best (sic) of America's commercial and
industrial giants for 22 years. Exxon, Levi's, R.J. Reynolds, Apple,
G.M.C.
and dozens of other corporate behemoths have had their Ad campaigns
tweaked
by the BLF. The Billboard Liberation Front was formed in 1977 by Jack
Napier and Irving Glikk after the two were kidnapped, blindfolded and
forced to alter a billboard along with 24 other clueless copywriters by
the
nefarious San Francisco Suicide Club.

"very well, honey-buns." said the hubbie, "i'll just pout and make another baby again with another woman like i usually do while your out, and then when you come back, i will sort of go out with a group of high school students who will alienate you. just as long as you don't do anything that you truly enjoy, we can stay married till death do us part."

 Oh, and unless they have changed their door policy which I highly doubt , Mission Rock is 21+, where's the mention of that? I didn't see anything about that in your bsp. So what's up for people under 21?

Mission Rock for that event still sounds like a joke.

KELLY'S MISSION ROCK is 18+

also we are using the huge grounds on the side of the venue to expand the capacity!

And we did add more talent... BEATNUTS & LIVING LEGENDS!!!

<< Dam, I thought you guys said you postponed the party to add more talent? Sounds like a a load of of crap to me. Why not be honest, you postponed it cuzz you lost your venue. That much is obvious, I mean come on, a "massive" at Mission Rock............thats a joke. 

Oh, and unless they have changed their door policy which I highly doubt , Mission Rock is 21+, where's the mention of that? I didn't see anything about that in your bsp. So what's up for people under 21?

Subject: [sfraves] PHOTEK @ DNA TONIGHT

Sunday August 3, 2003 
DNA Lounge 
Deft Moves & Faultline present:

PHOTEK [Photek Productions, Do Or Die / UK] 
Photek aka Special Forces is recognized around the
globe as one of the most prolific artists in the
history of Drum & Bass. His innovative releases and
remixes on such labels as Metalheadz, Certificate 18,
Good Looking, Prototype and Science span the evolution
of D&B and helped lay the blueprints for the genre. In
addition to his DJing and production Photek pilots his
own seminal Photek Productions and new Do or Die
imprints. Don't miss this exclusive Bay Area
appearance. 

JUJU [Cartel, Phuturo] 
Currently one of the States' busiest and most
established DJ/Producers, Juju has been destroying
discotecas from the Americas to Asia and is showing no
signs of slowing down. His releases on Renegade,
Commercial Suicide, Violence, Breakbeat Science,
Advanced and his own Phuturo label have received
worldwide acclaim. Don't miss one of the most popular
stateside DJ's and the Bay Area's own in a set that
promises pure dancefloor madness. 

MC DUH [Groundscore] 
Subversive flow, spontaneous freestyles and
characteristic razor-sharp wit have made Duh MC the
most in-demand lyricist in the Bay Area and beyond. He
has been a staple at too many D&B nights to mention
and continues to uplift and excite crowds on the
regular. 

DJ M [Faultline, Tenderloft, Freebeats]

so, little lady comes home to hubby and he is yell'in! 
 
"DID YOU HAVE A GOOD TIME AT THE BOOB LADY PARTY? DID YOU HEAR ANY GOOD MUSIC?"
 
"no, dear, i had a rotten time, because i posted that i was going to attend the boob lady party with my friend on "raves and graves" and all these total losers showed up and bothered me the whole night, and all the other people there thought i was the boob lady too, and no one watched the real boob lady show, because they were all drunk or high and thinking that everyone else was the boob lady. why are you yelling at me, dear?"
 
"well, it is not that i give a shit about your welfare, beyond your potential paycheck and continual good nature inspite of my ignorance, but i am actually almost totally deaf from all the boob lady parties i went to when i was ignoring you and fleeing the relationship, unknowingly of course. also, i suffered my first heart attack last night, so, i am a whole lot grumpier than usual, but GOOD NEWS! i am not going ANYWHERE anymore, and i am ready for you to devote the rest of your life to caring for me! kind of like a little hospital or premature rest home situation."
 
"fabulous, darling. i knew time was on our side!" the end. :)

Subject: [sfraves] How do YOU choose which party to attend?

A friend and I were IMing today about a topic she saw on some other message
board.  And it really got me to thinking.  In my current financial state, I
don't get to party that often anymore.  And I have to be really selective about
which party I'm going to invest my hard-earned dollar into.  I'm actually all
the way down to about one party a month, of late; less actually, most recently.
because my car has been unavailable for a while.

In the course of the conversation, I really got to thinking about what EXACTLY
motivates me to go to a given party.  And I was wondering what motivates others
in THEIR choices?

For me, it comes down to four major points, in decending order of importance: 
Crew, Location, Price, and Lineup.

1)  CREW
Now that I've been around the block a few times, this is my #1 criteria.  There
are some crews who will get me at their party regardless of other
considerations.  And others who have proven that they don't ever deserve a
penny from me.

At the top, are the crews that both a) have their act together, and b) are
throwing parties for what I believe are the right reasons.  Quite frankly, I'm
a sucker for a benefit party.  It makes me SOOO happy that some crews are
throwing their parties for the good of the community, rathar than as a cynical
exercise at fattening their own wallets.  That's why I love crews like Unity
and Moksha so, and why it hurt so much not to be able to make it to Jagan last
night.  Even when it's not a benefit, it's still nice when I know that the
proceeds are being rolled into the budget for the next party, instead of being
taken as profit.  It frusterates me more than I can say, that I've had to
rercently miss THREE parties (AEC, FnF, and Moksha), thrown by crews I respect
the most, in the last month because of my vehicular difficulties.  But if
circumstances were normal, Duckee and Alison, for example, could throw anything
from a 200-person renegade to a 10,000-person massive, and I'd be camped out at
F8, on the first day the presales were available, waiting to get mine. 
Regardless of the other details about the party, that little Unity triangle
with the sunflowers would be enough to get me there.

Next step below, are the crews who throw parties for reasons which I don't
regard as so pure as the above, but generally have their shit together.  They
don't lie, on their flyers, about which talent they will deliver.  And most
everything will go as advretized and expected, with little chance of a bust. 
And mostly, they don't pull that 18+ (sometimes even 21+) or 2am bullshit. 
Groups like Cosmic Beats or Anubis would fall into this category.

Next are crews that I would normally consider to fall in the next category
above, but simply don't throw the kind of party I care for.  Best example is
Skills.  I like Jason and Tom as persons and DJs, but the plain and simple fact
is: I *DON'T* like massives.  And even more, I think that going home at 2am is
LAME!  I make no pretense otherwise, and no apologies for it.  I consider the
best size for a party to be 350 people or so: large enough for lots of your
friends to be there, and to meet some new people; but no so large that you
can't FIND your friends, or that you can get lost in the crowd.  And the proper
time for a party to end is about when the sun starts to peek over the
Berkeley/Oakland hills.  That said tho, I *DO* go to the occasional Skills
massive; because, a) they WOULD otherwise fall into the next higher slot, and
b) there are some people who have faded mostly out of the scene, who only come
out for the occasional Skills party.  I'd miss my chance to see these people
(Tigger (Eric) would be the best example off the top of my head.) otherwise.

Next are the crews that I like as people, but just haven't had their shit
together.  Call it bad luck, call it poor planning, whatever.  For example, I
love Marty to death, and wish him nothing but the best as an individual; but I
would have serious reservations about going to another Happy Kids party, if
they were to start up again.

Next to last, are the ones that are the paragons of greed and exploitation. 
The ones that are ALL about enriching some corporate bottom line, and not about
contributing to the community.  Even worse, they actually LIE about what
(talent, age limits, location) they are going to deliver.  In the intrests of
not starting drama, I won't name any names.

Even lower than the low, are the ones who actively sabotage other crews'
parties... ESPECIALLY if the crew being attacked falls into the top category
(Something I've seen happen twice...  Attacking, or trying to get busted, a
benefit party is just extra super loathesome.).  Also, in the intrests of not
starting drama... no names.

2)  LOCATION
This has two subcategories...  the venue and location in general.

Some venues are just fun as hell to party in!  Army and Conneticuit, Infinite
Kaos/Tenderloft, that indoor jungle gym where Superfriends was, the place where
Duckee held the two Imagine half-years ;-)  Those are some of my most favorite
venues ever, and I would gladly go again.  There are also some others that are
not, objectively, so great, but I'd want to go back for nostalgia's sake...
that bowling alley in Petaluma, the Crackhouse, the gym with the bouncy floors
in Concord, and so on.  And there are some that were so astoundingly cool,
stupendously badass, INSANELY GREAT, that I'd give my left nut in order to be
able to party there again.  The perfect example of this kind of venue is San
Francisco's CITY HALL.

Then, there are the bad venues.... the places I avoid... the places that it
would take a top-notch crew in order to lure me back.  For instance, the
actions of Bones and his band of tweaker thugs outside of Survival led directly
to my decision that I would never go to a party at the Maratime Hall again.  In
fact, I did a little happy dance when I heard that it was finally shut down for
good.  Likewise, after that shooting, it was well past time for Campbell to
die.  And the treatment of the attendees at the hands of the Sweets' staff at
Hope made me give up on that venue.

As much as I dislike spoiling the suprise; with venues out there that I don't
feel deserve my money (even if it IS laundered through the promoter), I do have
to make an active effort to find out where parties are.  Sucks to have
principles, I guess.

Then there's the "general location" thing.  I'm friends with some of the crews
that have thrown parties in Santa Cruz.  But I'm sorry guys, once you go over
those mountains, it just isn't the Bay Area anymore.  Likewise, getting that:
"you ain't from heayah, are ya... boy", from a local when I stopped at the gas
station in Sebastapol just creeped me the hell out!  And sometimes, it's just
the wrong day/week/season/whatever for an outdoor party!  And as a matter of
general principle, I think that it's important to fight for our right to
peacably assemble and dance HERE.  Retreating farther and farther away from The
City is, at best, a sub-optimal solution; and completely counterproductive and
wrong, at worst.

And, as a purely pratical matter, location dovetails into factor #3...  Gas is
expensive, now moreso than ever!

3)  PRICE
Let's face it:  the dot-com boom is over, the tech industry as a whole is still
in a slump, prosperity is on hiatus, many of us are under-employed at crappy
jobs that are, technically, beneath us.  I, for one, can't afford to go out
every friday and saturday and blow $30 or more, just for the TICKET, anymore! 
And I know that more than a few others are in situations similar to mine. 
Everybody DOESN'T have ludicrous amounts of money to throw around anymore!  But
some promoters seem not to have realized this, and are still throwing
expensive-as-fuck parties!  (And the ticket price is just the start of the
night's expenses.  Why, for example, does it seem that, with VERY few
exceptions, the higher the ticket price, the higher the water will be priced as
well?)

Andy and Andy (Tronic and Neuropsyintist) are an excellent example of a crew
that *HAS* realized that the dot-com boom is over.  Not only have they priced
their parties for the depressed economy, they DELIVER value, lots of it, for
that $5!  The many Many MANY parties that they have thrown with a $5 ticket
price have delivered more fun to me than many of parties I used to go to at
five times their price.  Hell, they're starting presales for their NEXT party
at $1!  You can bet your sweet ass that I'll be there to get mine!

Finally, price is related to location.  Gas costs money, moreso now than ever. 
And if I'm going to have to drive to the-middle-of-godforsaken-bumfuck-nowhere,
it better be worth my time and (gas)money.

4)  LINEUP
Odd that this, the most important consideration for some, is last for me.  But
the fact is, that we have a LOT of talent here in the Bay Area.  At almost ANY
party that I would go to, given my top three criteria, I *WILL* see talent I
like... the only exception being, perhaps, parties that specialize in a genre
I'm not fond of.  Sure I have my own favorites.  But most all of those
favorites are local.  And if I miss them at this party; chances are that I'll
see them at the next one.

Heh... I've suceeded in turning what was going to be a simple "my friend and I
were talking about $x, I was curious what you gues think" into one of my
classic mini-novellas.  Doh!  But then, maybe that means things ARE about to
get back to normal for me?

In any case, I DO think it's an intresting topic.  What criteria DO other
people use for selecting the parties you're going to attend?  What do you think
the criteria SHOULD be?


cya,
john

Subject: [sfraves] JAGAN:  Moksha Tribe Thanks You!!!!!

--=====================_27705843==.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

Our heartfelt appreciation to all of you who shared the dance floors with 
us last night at Jagan.

The Moksha crew has been working on this event for weeks and, among other 
things, created seven new banners just for this party.  As those of you who 
attend Moksha events know, we have high production standards. Many of us 
were working for two days in the venue putting Jagan together.

Most of the crew, therefore, were near exhaustion and beyond Red Bull when 
the lights went down:)  But then our guests arrived and everything 
changed.  The entire crew and I were instantly energized by the vibe all of 
you brought to the party.   We are deeply grateful for the solid raver 
values you all bring to the mix.  All of us had much fun partying with you, 
and I hope it was the same for our extended family.  I saw many familiar 
and welcome faces from other Moksha parties.

The theme was Japanese anime and culture and many of the attendees wore 
very creative and elaborate costumes.  And there were quite a few dancers 
still on the floor when the lights went up.

Special thanks to Terry from Viberation for visuals that were stunning, 
creative, and thematically right on the mark.  And to Marshal of Swat Sound 
and Andy from Neuroscience Creations who provided excellent sound.

In the end, however, throwing parties is meaningless if you don't create 
some happiness and memorable experiences.  We hope that we accomplished 
this from our side.  I can say that all of you who attended filled our 
souls with much joy.

Again, thanks Moksha family!!!!  We will begin planning our next party soon.

Much love,

Apollo for Moksha Tribe

Ok, this is the 2nd time I've heard this in the last few months.... I keep
hearing a series of distant explosions as though there's a barrage of
fireworks going off, but it's well past the 4th of July and I don't know of
any special events going on around here. Anyone know what's up? It's just
weird hearing "boom boom boom" outside for a sustained period of time.

Ok, this is the 2nd time I've heard this in the last few months.... I
keep hearing a series of distant explosions as though there's a barrage
of fireworks going off, but it's well past the 4th of July and I don't
know of any special events going on around here. Anyone know what's up?
It's just weird hearing "boom boom boom" outside for a sustained period
of time.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] JAGAN:  Moksha Tribe Thanks You!!!!!

Hmm, thanks for the update and a bit of insider info.

If my dancing spirit did anything to uplift the atmosphere, sweaty body and
all, then I achieved my supreme goal of much happiness. Sometimes I just am
carried away because the music takes me to a higher place, without the
worries of the world. Endorphins rush in like a natural high and life seems
wonderful.

I hope that I was able to communicate some euphoria to others, even the
crew, with their impending exhaustion from all of the hard preparation work.
I could tell that the set up was laborious and I appreciated the efforts of
all.

Side note: thanks for the refreshments. I don't know what I would have done
without the nutritional benefits of the 3 peaches and 2 bananas that I
consumed at around 4 am, after getting completely exhausted from dancing.
Now I really know how important it is to replenish the body to get it going
again. After water + fruits I was able to dance until closing time.
I will try to post a review later,
Thanks,
Greg VP

Subject: [sfraves] JAGAN: Moksha Tribe Thanks You!!!!!


Our heartfelt appreciation to all of you who shared the dance floors with
us last night at Jagan.

The Moksha crew has been working on this event for weeks and, among other
things, created seven new banners just for this party.  As those of you who
attend Moksha events know, we have high production standards. Many of us
were working for two days in the venue putting Jagan together.

Most of the crew, therefore, were near exhaustion and beyond Red Bull when
the lights went down:)  But then our guests arrived and everything
changed.  The entire crew and I were instantly energized by the vibe all of
you brought to the party.   We are deeply grateful for the solid raver
values you all bring to the mix.  All of us had much fun partying with you,
and I hope it was the same for our extended family.  I saw many familiar
and welcome faces from other Moksha parties.

The theme was Japanese anime and culture and many of the attendees wore
very creative and elaborate costumes.  And there were quite a few dancers
still on the floor when the lights went up.

Special thanks to Terry from Viberation for visuals that were stunning,
creative, and thematically right on the mark.  And to Marshal of Swat Sound
and Andy from Neuroscience Creations who provided excellent sound.

In the end, however, throwing parties is meaningless if you don't create
some happiness and memorable experiences.  We hope that we accomplished
this from our side.  I can say that all of you who attended filled our
souls with much joy.

Again, thanks Moksha family!!!!  We will begin planning our next party soon.

Much love,

Apollo for Moksha Tribe

FYI:
Styrofoam is actually more environmentaly friendly than the Paper cups. Most people don't know that they have taken a lot of the cfcs out of the styrofoam AND styrofoam is 100% recyclable. They make hard plastic ( I forget the number, but it is the kind videotape cases are made from )  out of it. Sadly, there was a brief period of time in the late 80s where McDonalds had started a successful recycling program, only to have it thwarted by the perception that paper was beter for the environment, sadly NONE of the allegedly  "Environmentaly Friendly" Mc Donald's paper packaging gets recycled today.This caused a chain reaction reducing the demand for Styrofoam recycling facilities, so even though styrofam is efficiently recyclable, almost none of it gets recycled. To the best of my knowledge, ( somebody feel free to update me if I am wrong,, because I have been out of manufacturing for a long time) The paper cups are totaly non recyclable, so if you have been tossing them in the "Mixed
 Paper" bin, quit it. As said before, your best bet is a reusable commuter mug, it always was anyway. The same goes for water bottles, you can recycle them, but most of the time they don't get recycled, and recycling takes a lot more energy than refilling.

I was driving back from Santa Cruz towards the city around 9:15 tonight and
actually was able to see these fireworks. It appeared that they may have
been coming from Great America but I can't be certain. They were definitely
professional level fireworks, in fact -- my first thought was that it must
be Disneyland's fireworks but a moment later I remembered that I don't live
in LA anymore...

Hi, I was wondering how people enjoyed Audio Playground on Saturday? 

Went to Rendezvous on Saturday. Some good out of town talent, such as Thee-o, 
who I always enjoy. Great seeing Denise as always. Not a  whole lot of people 
there, though. What's up? Guess everybody was at Audio Playground, and there 
was another big party too, that night, I believe. 
A few years ago, you could have more than one bumpin' party on a Saturday 
night, but it seems to me that a lot fewer people are going to parties now. The 
people who go are cool, but the number seems to be shrinking. 
Is there any way to coordinate things so the good parties don't all happen on 
the same night? I know there are some fridays and saturdays when it doesn't 
seem like there's a good party, so instead of having three good ones the same 
night, I wish they could be spread out a little. 
Anyway, curious about Audio Playground, please let me know how it was. 
Thanks.
John in Berkeley

Sat i made it out to audio playground. This was probably one of my fav 
parties ever! i mean hey ,a party with a slide, twister and giant legos to build 
forts! what more could you ask for?!? hehe! the music and engery in all 3 rooms 
were going all nite long... jaxx the ripper and reim's set was off the hook! 
they had the whole place jumping. ive noticed lately a lot of new faces at 
parties, but every one was really cool, and this party gave me a chance to start 
meeting some new people! The amount of hard work , time and energy that 
audiopreservationn puts into there parties shows off , and makes them unforgetable! i 
had a great time!

P-Nut(meghan)

PS where was the hopscotch??!?!?? thats always a playground favorite! heheh!

Ok, this is the 2nd time I've heard this in the last few months.... I
keep hearing a series of distant explosions as though there's a barrage
of fireworks going off, but it's well past the 4th of July and I don't
know of any special events going on around here. Anyone know what's up?
It's just weird hearing "boom boom boom" outside for a sustained period
of time.

perhaps you should walk outside.  the fair's firework
were visable from most spots in sj.  as far as a few
months....well, the fair was this weekend only and
they had the show on friday night, saturday night and
sunday night.  the other sounds you were hearing are
probably gunshots!  heheheh...ahhhh the seductive
sound of firearms on a warm summers eve in downtown
san jose!  i'm soooo glad i finally moved outta
downtown after a 7 year stint.  i feel relieved.  but
then again...who wouldn't want to live in the flight
pattern of the damn hospital helicopter??  good
stuff...

;)

I *did* walk outside.. only I live in Sunnyvale so I couldn't quite see 
the SJ sky from here ;)

Congrats! I'm trying to ditch the south bay myself, but first I need to 
achieve a level of income that'll allow me to escape my parents' 
domicile.  :(

Thanks to all for the confirmations of WTF all that racket was. I was 
trying to watch me some King of the Hill in peace!

You don't need to live in SJ for that...

I sure was paranoid, with all these copters circling my house, until I 
figured that one out.

im going to have to put my vote in for this party as well.  the audio
metamorphosis crews has consistently impressed a lot of people with their
parties the past year.  it is great to see a groups hard work pay off.

minus a brief period when the cops showed and they had to turn the music
down, that place was hopping the entire night.

Subject: [sfraves] 200 + PEOPLE RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR: Any ravers running?

 I don't know how their going to get through that mess and whittle the
list down to some sensible level, but baring some legal move to stop the
election, I was thinking if anyone was tempted to or is really going to
put down their $60 (I think it is, something ridiculously low)
registration fee and run for governor?

Why should we vote for you?
What would be your party name? 
And what would your platform and issues be?

 As the way the election stands now, anyone who has the most votes, wins!
If all the people in California who go to raves voted for a raver, we
could teleologically take over  the state!

Peace, Bodhi ^ _ ^

It's 65 signatures and a $3,500 deposit, or 10,000 signatures and no 
deposit.
You must declare candidacy by August 9.

My coworkers are trying to get me to do it, but I don't have that kind 
of money, nor could I collect it from people in time.. haha.. like I'd 
even have a shot.

But now that I know how easy it is, maybe I'll run when there's a real 
election in the near future and not have to go up against 200+ 
contenders.  I'd most definitely be a raver-friendly candidate. And I'd 
be sure to institute a statewide Crazy Pants Day once a month. Because 
no state can be successful without 12 opportunities to sport funky 
leggings every year!

****************PRINT THIS EMAIL AND GET IN FOR A 
BUCK!!!****************************

Hey all,
Thanks for a great weekend, the Moksha Tribe event "Jagan" was successful 
and off the hook. Thanks to all the members of my Moksha family.
My son turns 3 today, so it's cause for celebration! Tonight, we have our 
regular scheduled guest dj, mixing his funky ass style of tech house and 
acid house goodies.. and for those who like it hard and hoovered, The recent 
AEC party got me pumped on old jams and I want to bring it back one more 
time for all who loved it and wanted more or couldn't make it out to BFE 
that night. I'm takin it all the way back to 1992 and before. With a solid 
set of nothing but retro-rave classics, come down to hear Messiah, 2 Bad 
Mice, Prodigy, Acen, DJ Seduction, Kicks Like a Mule, Return of the Living 
Acid, Nation 12 and much much more! Go back in time with me tonight.. wear a 
funky hat and whistle and get in free! If you have some rave classics you'd 
like to play or hear tonight, email me and lets talk about it!

While I'm at it, I'm taking Secret Society bookings for the rest of the 
year, if you'd like to play or would like to hear someone special, don't 
hesitate to get in touch..

Subject: [sfraves] [BSP] Estuary :: Mon Aug 4 :: DJ Dragn'fly :: New weekly format!

Estuary :: Open Deck Weekly 

Monday July 28, 2003
9:00 pm - 2:00 am 
Masse's Nightclub :: 21+ w/ID, Free
Featured Guest :: DJ Dragn'fly

Estuary :: (Noun) 1. Where the river blends with the sea. 2. A place 
where all styles mix.

We've decided to change the format of the night. Now it's...

In the back room we have "first come first served" open deck slots. 

In the main room signups will be for the following week. At 10pm you
can put your name on the list of djs who want to spin the following
week and we will set the lineup. This allows for several things: 

1) We can group the genres together, which is more pleasing for the
audience than radically changing styles every 1/2 hour.

2) Starting the signups at 10pm gives you more time to get there,
especially for those coming from places like San Francisco and Marin
County.

3) You will have a whole week to tell your friends exactly what time
you will be spinning, so that they can come and support you.

If you have no skills at all, but have some cool tracks that you'd like
to share, you are just as welcome as anyone else! 

* Please bring needles and headphones. If you don't have your own, find
a friend to share with! *

This week's line-up:
9:00pm  :: Gavin (Trance)
9:30pm  :: Summer K (breaks)
10:00pm :: Jacob B (Hard House)
10:30pm :: JaggedMetalO (hard house)
11:00pm :: Teks (hard house/techno)

Featured Guest:
11:30pm :: Dragn'fly

12:30pm :: Marcine (jungle)
1:00pm  :: Phaedrus (jungle)
1:30pm  :: Lewt (DnB/jungle)

Our Featured Guest this week is Dragn'fly! After spending the whole
weekend down here in the Bay rockin' Moksha's Jagan (among other
parties), she comes to give us one last fix before heading back to Sac.

Still looking for a place to live in San Francisco. Something near the
muni rail would be fabulous. Any of you guys know of something opening up
this month or the beginning of next, let me know!

I'm 21, a student at SFSU, have no pets, don't mind noise, and am
decidedly 420 friendly. In fact, I'm downright 420 amorous. I only
occasionally pee on the carpet.

Thanks!

Sean

Subject: [sfraves] Last chance for survey

Hi everyone,

I am conducting a survey as part of my research in my
senior project class (DAI 505). I am designing a
website for a local DJ as my senior project. The
survey is targeted at fans of electonica/dance/and DJ
culture.  It's quick and simple. If you could respond
to the survey or pass this link along to others, I
would greatly appreciate it. If you have any questions
or comments, let me know.

Here's the link to the survey: 
http://www.createsurvey.com/cgi-bin/pollfrm?s=9949&magic=H46LsnJaIRuYLvb

If you're a DJ (ESPECIALLY FEMALE DJs), I have a
specialized survey for DJs:
http://www.createsurvey.com/cgi-bin/pollfrm?s=9952&magic=lJWxJU0ZkpB4KXE

This survey will be up 2 more days before I analyze
the data. A BIG THANK YOU to those that have already
participated. Your input has greatly helped me in my
research. Thanks for your time and have a great day.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

i heard that larry flint may be on the california ballot for the governors race. i also heard a rumor a couple of months ago, that his magazine, hustler magazine, had purchased pictures of a woman who had an affair with a man who murdered his own wife who was also pregnant at the time of the murder to term with his first son. the woman who had the affair's father went on television and protested that these photographs might be published in hustler magazine. i think it would be pretty gross and unnecessary to profit off of the grisly death of an infant. :)

wow, that would be even sicker than daily use of a public topic based list

**************************************


Estuary :: Open Deck Weekly

Monday July 28, 2003
9:00 pm - 2:00 am 
Masse's Nightclub :: 21+ w/ID, Free
Featured Guest :: DJ Dragn'fly

Estuary :: (Noun) 1. Where the river blends with the
sea. 2. A place 
where all styles mix.

We've decided to change the format of the night. Now
it's...

In the back room we have "first come first served"
open deck slots. 

In the main room signups will be for the following
week. At 10pm you
can put your name on the list of djs who want to spin
the following
week and we will set the lineup. This allows for
several things: 

1) We can group the genres together, which is more
pleasing for the
audience than radically changing styles every 1/2
hour.

2) Starting the signups at 10pm gives you more time to
get there,
especially for those coming from places like San
Francisco and Marin
County.

3) You will have a whole week to tell your friends
exactly what time
you will be spinning, so that they can come and
support you.

If you have no skills at all, but have some cool
tracks that you'd like
to share, you are just as welcome as anyone else!

* Please bring needles and headphones. If you don't
have your own, find
a friend to share with! *

This week's line-up:
9:00pm  :: Gavin (Trance)
9:30pm  :: Summer K (breaks)
10:00pm :: Jacob B (Hard House)
10:30pm :: JaggedMetalO (hard house)
11:00pm :: Teks (hard house/techno)

Featured Guest:
11:30pm :: Dragn'fly

12:30pm :: Marcine (jungle)
1:00pm  :: Phaedrus (jungle)
1:30pm  :: Lewt (DnB/jungle)

Our Featured Guest this week is Dragn'fly! After
spending the whole
weekend down here in the Bay rockin' Moksha's Jagan
(among other
parties), she comes to give us one last fix before
heading back to Sac.


Added bonuses:
$2 STRONG Islands
FREE pool tables
Outdoor smoking patio
NO COVER CHARGE!!! WOOHOO!!
21+ up w/ ID, please

"Security is mostly a superstition.  It does not exist in nature, nor do 
the children of humans as a whole experience it.  Avoiding danger is no 
safer in the long run than outright exposure.  Life is either a daring 
adventure or nothing."

"Compassion is not a relationship between the healer and the wounded.  It's 
a relationship between equals.  Only when we know our own darkness well can 
we be present with the darkness of others.  Compassion becomes real when we

Given the very poor wording of this clear demonstration of the lack of

And since prisons have mostly been privatized and are big business
themselves you could throw the lawyers, jailors, and politicians in
there too.   And since the government is collecting $200k max fine
they're profiting as well so there go your clerks, baliffs, mail room
personnel, etc.  By the end, all al-qaeda will have to do is hop a boat
and walk in because we'll all be in highly overcrowded jails.

Given the very poor wording of this clear demonstration of the lack of 
intelligence and basic understanding of our constitution on the part of
our 
legislators, I guess the whole community where the rave occurs could 
technically be thrown in jail.

Love,

i love dr. phil when he asks, "where's the pay off?" to people who are truly involved with one another. i think real relationships are fun, that is why i have them and why i watch that particular show when i have time. i met an artist from africa yesterday. i did not mention this list to her though. i honestly did not think that she would find it entertaining or useful in any sense of the word, nor did i believe that she would have time for it anyway. she is on a world tour right now. i am excited to shop everywhere that i go with my friends, like i usually do. i would never make a world tour if there wasn't good shopping to be had or real friends. i am happy that i have never had to do anything that i didn't believe in nor work with anyone who i don't want to. i am also glad that i have never had to have a relationship with anyone i am not interested in, be that business or otherwise. if i believed that the imaginary were true, then for sure, i would not be here. you have to pay
 attention to what is really going on, because if you don't, you might get caught up in something where not only is there no pay off for you, but also, all you'll get is a bunch of really unsatisfying work. work is supposed to be fun and so are the people, and if someone needs to go to the doctor and doesn't want to, then you don't have to pick up the pieces for them or anything like that. you can just devote that energy to something that validates your experience here on earth while you have the time. :)

There's a group here in the DC/metro area that's attempting to do something
about these bills. Here's the link to their site...check it out. (I don't
know if you have anything similar there in SF)

Subject: [sfraves] JAGAN.... WOW... Hello 2DAy>>I'm still Afterglowing!!

OK... so like last Saturday I was @ Jagan!!!  Ya know... it's hard 2 still describe how that underground was 4 me... 'cause I"m like still in this mondo haze of what a fuckin' Bad Ass night it was & I learned alota thing about myself that night that jus' totally came 2 surface throughout the course of the night (mentally anyway)

OK... I 1st wanna start off w/ the last set of the night!!  I was in the side room where ShezTek was spinning... there were several times when I would go in that room 2 dance my ass off 'cause oooooh man... orgasmic tunes from his vinyl.. yeah!!!  But what espt hit me more was during his last track when he spun Silence by Delirium feat. Sarah McLaLaLa (I know, sp) 'cause I mean... that songs total anthem & that song brought about this mondo energy in the room & it's like 1 of my all time favorite songs.. but man... the room went totally crazy & U can actually touch the energy in the room it was sooo damn thick!!  WHOA... I jus' got goosebumps thinkin' about it again!!  But yeah... it was So Dope 'cause every1 started huggin' each other & singing!!  

What really touched me the most is when I went up 2 ACME Dave & we gave each other this mondo hug that ooooh man... it's like I Love that guy 'cause he's been my Bro 4 soooo many years & that hug let me know that we were gonna be never ending Bros & we Loved each other soo much!!!  Then I started dancing somemore 'cause it was the perfect release from all the thing that built up in my during the party!!  I mean... it was Sooooo Awesome & I Thank U all 4 sharing that moment w/ me!!  It was jus' that Awesome Moment in time that I think we all needed & made us proud of who we are... 'cause 1 day Ravers will rule the world 1 dance step @ a time, 1 record @ a time, & the world will feel our vibe!  ShezTek... I Love Dude & Thank U 4 that sooo much!

OK...so like all the sets that night we so Awesome!  Lemme try 2 remember them sets!!!  Andrew Phelan & his homeboy on the keyboards totally blew me away!!  I mean... U can probably call it a replication of Dave & Sen Sei.. butno... it wasn't!!  Dave & Sen Sei are 2 of my really good friends & I Love them, but they're like more on the tribal side of they do but man... when Andrew Phelan & his HOmie bust out the live PA over Andrew's spinning, it was all about the funk!!!  Ooooh my Goodness!!  I Loved it!!  I mean... they created this Awesome magic w/ that set that took Deep Funky Chicago House 2 another level!! Seriously!

OK... 'cause I don't wanna make this post hella long... lemme tell ya that all the Moksha Tribe DJs who spun in the main room we fuckin' Awesome!!!  DV8 was weaving records together that came out w/ this Beautiful set!!  Seein' Homeboy dance while he spinning is also a + in my book!  Dilema Funk Doc was Dope!!  Shawn Allen totally worked me over when he spun!!  Loved those remixes!

Unfortunately... I got 2 the party after 12 & wasn't able 2 catch Marcine or Phaedrus's sets =(  Hmmmm... wonder if they were recorded so I could check them out??

Another set that impressed me was Les Elemental!!  I knew he spun Techno & Jungle... but Good Shit... that was the 1st time in the 3 years I've known him that I saw him spin House!!  It was like this kinda dark house stuff that I dunno how 2 describe or explain it... may a dark version of Tech HOuse w/ like dark melodies... but then I heard him spin in like a record or 2 of Techno... & then a house track that I think might of been a techno song originally... but oh man... he spun this 1 Acid Breakbeats track that fuckin' Floored me man!!! I Loved it!!

DFly got on & got the dark nrg/ Dark trance thing gon' on & she actually filled up the room 'cause I guess there were alota people waiting 4 her 2 spin... LoL... BUt I Loved it!!  I danced w/ Terri a while on the Floor during this set!!

When i 1st got there though, Apollo was on the decks & he WHOA man... I mean.. I know his set contained aota house.. Yummm,,, but I swear.. I heard him throw in some Breakbeats here & there (I think or maybe they were some breakbeat Breakdowns maybe) but man... I Loved it!!

OK... the Vibe was totally there man!!  I mean... it was Good vibes all around & U can feel the Love all throughout the party!!  I mean... if the vibe there only led up to that last set where U felt it the most... them yeah... Hello 2Day, it was jus' Amazing man!!

It's rare 4 1 of those life changing parties that happen when well... u like totally go 2 a party but leave as some1 different... ya know... that's what kinda happen 2 me & I didn't know I needed JAGAN that much... but it really set me strait which is alot 2 say 4 me 'cause I've experienced this b4, but not @ this level!!  

Thank U Miksha Tribe for that!!! Love U!

Take Care,
Peace-> O§bY {8O)

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) Quote of the Day

I just wanted to announce that I will be running for governor of California to replace Grey Davis  when he is 
recalled.  I don't have a platform, and my political experience consists of stuffing envelopes for the late 
night coalition.  Don't you want me?  I'm probably equally qualified to serve as many of the other 
candidates.  

humpf ... well, in exchange for this ridiculous proposal, and because i owe you a few quotes, here's two 
today ... 

--

"Why don't you put her in charge?" (from the movie 'Aliens', referring to the little girl holed up in a space 
colony with those ugly things ... doesn't that remind you of yourself sometimes?)

"How can you send your kids to school with a name like Moonbeam, or Waave, or Horseradish, or 
whatever they say ... how can you send your kids to a Little League game when you live on a communal 
farm growing drugs?  It's awful ... and that's what my life is all about ... looking down on others."

- Jan Brown, Mother and Angry Vice City resident

ShezTek's set was probably my favorite of the night.  He started it off with 
what sounded like a remix of "No Way Back" by Adonis (or maybe the track just 
sampled the bassline?), followed by Joey Beltram's "Energy Flash"--  !!! ---  
wow!  Hearing tracks like these made me feel a great joy that could hardly be 
described in words...  except for perhaps the words "Hello 2Day!!",  but I 
think this catch phrase has already been taken...  The rest of his set mixed 
breaks, techno, trance, house, electro-- awesome!! The spontaneous raver hug orgy 
and lip sync contest at the end was an added bonus. 

Thanks Moksha Tribe for another great party!

Love,

house. Kikkoman ( who will be playing one
of his last sets for sometime. because he is

Wyze One back in the garden again, after his last

be in attendence that nite.


4th: Saturday we are having Alex B and first timer Rueben

Well who knows when my email server will actually post this to the list,
but I really wanted to write about Jagan!
 
This was an awesome party, and my friends had come up from LA and they
always look forward to going to parties up here. Although it took us
about 30
Minutes driving around trying to find the mappoint, giving up and
finally getting ahold of Audra, we got to the party! There was something
eerie about looking for an off-ramp and seeing the sign for it on an
overpass above you.
 
Anyways, the decorations were beautiful, signs were everywhere helping
to direct people and it was well-laid out. The 'bars' choice of RedBull,
Sierra and sake was interesting, but a cool idea. The crew as always was
helpful and friendly. They were on top of everything and always
patrolling the party hanging out. I *ahem* got a little intoxicated, and
put down my battery charger for my camera. Luckily, someone found it and
put it in lost and found and Terry brought it to me!
 
            The visuals, by Mr. Terry and the Viberation crew were
amazing as usual. The anime movies overlaid with the Animatrix were dope
and really added to the party. So many people were dressed up in
costumes and really getting into the theme of the party. The music was
great and every room had a good variety to it with people dancing all
throughout the night. All the DJs were just awesome and I found myself
moving from room to room trying to catch everything.
 
            This is one of those parties that everyone talks about
afterwards and I am really glad that I was able to be part of it. I met
many new people and saw a lot of old friends. Like I was saying to
Apollo, every Moksha party just seems to be getting better and better!
My only regret was having camera trouble and not finding the mappoint
easily. Hearing Delirium at the end at the party was definitely a
throwback to different days, and seeing the room fill up at 6 am with
energetic, happy people only served to remind me why I go to parties
like these.
 
            Thanks again to the Moksha Tribe crew and all the hard work
you put into this party. It was definitely well appreciated!

Subject: [sfraves] BSP:Better Fun Party! Featuring Dj Van Dune!

Better Fun-draiser

On August 9th we are bringing you a party that will simply be Better Fun!
The Burning Man theme camp of Better Fun is preparing for their departure to
the Playa. This Fun-draising event has been organized to help raise few
dollars for necessary BM items (food, shelter, transportation), and to give
all of you a chance to party your ass off with us before we go!  We are
taking this out with an old-skool underground flavor and plenty of fun
things to embark upon- including The Wheel of Sin, a tantalizing Bake Sale,
pasty craft corner, and plenty of debauchery!

Your DJ's upstairs, bringing you some of the best 4 on the Floor the bay
area has to offer, will be:

Jay Walker (bfamily records)
Happy Kid Marty (Happy Kids)
Ian Vogel (Happy Kids)
MAC (NBC)
Ornette aka Logik (NBC)
Alex Van Dune (NBC/ACME/Pixelbisquet)


The downstairs Chill Room Environment hosted by The Ambient Mafia,
with trip-bass-breaky-funk sounds provided by:

Oracle (510junglists/Pangea)
and the Ambient Mafia's...
Speakeasy Ray
Boomerang Fidget
Drop
Redstickman
Harken


A few more reasons to come and check it out...
A great mixture of Bay Area underground Dj's!
Glow in the Dark performances!
New Black Light Art from Witco!
Last Chance to party with Robert & Sandra before they move north!
Hot Kostumes!
Because it's going to be Better Fun!

Party will go from 10 until 4:30
$10 @ the door  / $5 with tickets to Threshold
Water is $.50

Alcohol will not be sold at this event.




           Alex Van Dune

I am reminded of the immortal words of Socrates who once said
     "I drank what?"

I must pimp my husband's band, Ok I realy need some current and former punk rockers to show up and mosh with me, they are rock, which isnt really my thing, you know, so I told my husband I would dance if they wrote a punk song, and they did, it's called "All My Drugs."  I look really dumb moshing by myself, slamming into walls and such. Plus the Sushi is really good, and it is a fun little venue.
Hello Friends,
 
You are invited to Rock with Swaybone
next Friday, August 15 @ the Voodoo Lounge!
We are very excited about new songs we've added to 
the set, so come surge and swirl with us...
 
at 2937 Mission st. in San Francisco
 
Here's the lineup....

10:00 Swaybone

Subject: [sfraves] .: New Mixes from Dirtbox Radio : Roundtable Crew, Dirtbox Kru :.

Boh.

This past Sunday's Dirtbox was a shitload of fun.  Baltimore's Roundtable
Crew rolled thru to take over the night, followed by Dirtbox Kru &
Partners in Crime ODJ, Jerel, and Hooligan on the Afterhours tip.  We had
a great time chillin with the Roundtable kids, drinkin brews, shootin
shit, and hearing some tight fuckin tracks.

If you'd like to check out any of the sets, they're linked down below, and
on the site (www.dirtboxradio.com/archives.html).  The ets are listed in
timeslot order, avaialable as 56k realMedia , and 128k mp3s.  Oh yeah -
longer mp3 sets are split up into hour chunks, for easy burning:)

On August 9th we are bringing you a party that will simply be Better Fun!
The Burning Man theme camp of Better Fun is preparing for their departure to

dollars for necessary BM items (food, shelter, transportation), and to give
all of you a chance to party your ass off with us before we go!  We are
taking this out with an old-skool underground flavor and plenty of fun
things to embark upon- including The Wheel of Sin, a tantalizing Bake Sale,
pasty craft corner, and plenty of debauchery!

Your DJ's upstairs, bringing you some of the best 4 on the Floor the bay
area has to offer, will be:

Jay Walker (bfamily records)
Happy Kid Marty (Happy Kids)
Ian Vogel (Happy Kids)
MAC (NBC)
Ornette aka Logik (NBC)
Alex Van Dune (NBC/ACME/Pixelbisquet)


The downstairs Chill Room Environment hosted by The Ambient Mafia,
with trip-bass-breaky-funk sounds provided by:

Oracle (510junglists/Pangea)
and the Ambient Mafia's...
Speakeasy Ray
Boomerang Fidget
Drop
Redstickman
Harken


A few more reasons to come and check it out...
A great mixture of Bay Area underground Dj's!
Glow in the Dark performances!
New Black Light Art from Witco!
Last Chance to party with Robert & Sandra before they move north!
Hot Kostumes!
Because it's going to be Better Fun!

Party will go from 10 until 4:30
$10 @ the door  / $5 with tickets to Threshold
Water is $.50

Alcohol will not be sold at this event.

Located at the Oakland Noodle Factory (1255 26th St @Union - Oakland, CA), a
spacious warehouse near central freeways which includes 2 rooms of music, a
chill room, bathrooms, and a smoking area.

Please checkout the website Friday August 8th for better directions and
parking instructions. www.beterfun.org

Any questions or comments, please send them to whit@group114.com. Can't wait
to see you there...

     "I drank what?"

I give up, I HAVE to find this kid! I am just so intrigued, we were looking at my art and we were talking about doing a collaboration, he was talking about he placed a personal ad for a pillow! It was so funny, the more I think about it the funnier it is... Just so you all don't get the wrong idea, I am pretty sure he is gay, I just thought he would be really cool to work with. Art making partners (FYI) are way harder to find than romantic ones (for me anyway) and he just had the right kind of "vibe" so I really want to find him!

Subject: [sfraves] world of stereo 2


hey all,

I'm new to the list so this might have been beaten to death a million 
times..  World of Stereo 2..  good, bad, ugly?

I bought some what seem to be gray market 1210m3d's and a Stanton sa-8 
mixer from there.  The price was definitely right but there's a missing 
washer on the mixer and I also had to go back and get some missing parts 
for one of the decks (they forgot to include euro->american plugs, a 
rubber mat and the ep converter).  Everything seems to work ok though and 
it was *way* cheaper than anything else I've seen..

..

here's a pic of the rig:

Subject: [sfraves] NRR>> I'm going back to school! =)

OK... so like after months of contemplation, months of seeing the signs, & w/ the persuadance of 2 people through AIM & a friendster note from 1 of my friends... I decided 2 go back!!  Officially, I'm now a student of University Of Pheonix, Thanks DJ Raf 4 tipping me off to go there!  I start my 1st class in like 2-3 weeks & I should be done by next fall 'cause I"m entering there as a JR or soemthing 'cause I have way 2 many credits...

I dunno... this is exciting yet I'm sorta buggin' 'cause fuckin' a man... I'm actually goin' back 2 school & it's kinda trippy!!  Oh yeah.. my major is Business Marketing (Jack... we never talked about it dude, but this is what I'm set on) & I'm looking foward 2 finally getting my BA errr B something & who knows.. I may jus' get a masters also... LoL =)

Oh yeah... I also took my que from AliG & I sent a resi 2 SFMOMA 4 the assistant event coorinator position... so hopefully I get a job there also... who knows?  I hope I get!

Oh oh oh oh oh... I know alota y'all saw me last sat w/ this mondo blond hair then it was blue later in the night... well... I kinda went a lil' darker & now my hair may have tints of blond now, but on the whole, it's like a smokey, grayish, brownish color!!  I like it!!

OK... well I jus' wanted 2 share w/ U, my SFR Fam, on this big thing I'm about 2 take on!!!  YAAAAAAAY!! This will be soo Dope!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] world of stereo 2

I have a pair of "grey market" SL1210-M3D's (b). Everything came in the 
boxes just like they would if I had bought them from a Panasonic dealer in 
London... Nothing missing. I also got a great price and they included the 
Euro- American plugs for free.

I'm not sure about the retailer you picked them up from (I bought mine from 
Musicians Friend in OR), but the 1210's should be pretty much the exact same 
thing as the N. American SL1200-M3D's. Mine work great and even some people 
on this list have played on them. No ones had any isses with them.

AUDi,
Gavin

I went back to the store and they gave me all the stuff that was missing, 
so it turned out ok so far.  The prices were amazing so I was a little 
nervous that it was almost too good of a deal.

the euro plugs.  They seem to work great, although my first forays into 
doing proper beat mixing again weren't exactly a pretty sight (or pretty

shake off 6 years of rust.

Subject: [sfraves] [Politics] Take an active part - CA voter info (long)

Okay, people... since this recall election is coming up, this is the
time to take an active (or at least semi-active) part in your future
here in California. 

I have to say... I love California. Not only did the state actually
rally enough to get this recall election in motion (first time
nationally in 82 years and first time in California history), it's the
only place where the likes of comedian Gallagher, porn mogul Larry
Flynt, actors Gary Coleman and Arnold Schwarzenegger all run for
Governor. 

Personally, I'm finally to the point in my life where I actually do
care about the future of my government. So many things are just plain
wrong in our State and Federal Government. So many hardships are being
forced on the American people because of the politicians' fuck-ups.
It's time to become more involved. 

I encourage all of you, my friends, to register to vote if you haven't
already. And if you have, make sure your Voter Info is up-to-date! And
make it a point to be educated on your party's platform and the
platforms of the Gubernatorial (and in the upcoming future,
Presidential) candidates. 

Link to Online Voter Registration for California (VERY EASY!!):
https://ovr.ss.ca.gov/votereg/OnlineVoterReg

Also, if you don't have a political party, this may be the time for you
to take a look and think about it. There are 8 different parties listed
on the California Voter Registration, along with a "decline to state"
and "other" decision. 

Listed California Political Parties:
- American Independent: http://www.aipca.org (state),
http://www.constitutionparty.com (national)
- Democratic: http://www.ca-dem.org (state), http://www.democrats.org
(national)
- Green: http://www.greens.org/california (state),
http://www.greenpartyus.org (national)
- Libertarian: http://www.ca.lp.org (state), http://www.lp.org
(national)
- Natural Law: www.natural-law.org/states/California.html (state),
www.natural-law.org (national)
- Peace and Freedom: http://www.peaceandfreedom.org (state)
- Republican: http://www.cagop.org (state), http://www.rnc.org
(national)

I'm still making my party decision (it's tough!) and yes, I declined to
state my party on my registration. 

In looking at some of the more prominent Gubernatorial candidates, the
only candidates to really stand out to me so far are:
- Arianna Huffington (I): http://www.AriannaForGov.com
- Georgy Russell (D): http://www.georgyforgov.com - Local East Bay
candidate!

There are also (these are candidates w/ websites):
- Audie Bock (D): http://www.audiebock.com
- Larry Flynt (D): http://www.larryflynt.com
- Joe Guzzardi (D):
http://www.americanpatrol.com/CALIFORNIA/ELECTION/2004/GUZZARDI/GuzzardiForGovernor030725.html
- Darrell Issa (R): http://www.issaforgovernor.com
- Arnold Schwarzenegger (R): http://www.arnold4gov.com
- Jason Gastrich (I): http://www.jasongastrich.com
- Ron Gulke (AI): http://www.gulke.com
- Dale Ogden (L): http://www.dalefogden.org

Recall Election info from CA Sec of State's site:
http://www.ss.ca.gov/elections/recall.htm

Again, even if you don't take a part in a candidate's campaign or heavy
political activism, AT LEAST register to vote and check out the
candidates' platforms. Make an INFORMED DECISION! This is your future
we're working on here.

Okay, I'll get down from this lovely soapbox and go back to my daily
business. 

Jessica

Subject: Re: [sfraves] [Politics] Take an active part - CA voter info (long)

 Actually, I was ambivalent about the recall effort. It had it's positive
and negative sides to it and it was hella hard to decide whether to jump
on board. 
 What eventualy turned me off from the recall was mostly who was pushing
it. Not that I like Gray Davis, he's pretty much incompetent, corrupt and
making the poor suffer the most from the budget cuts, but a potential
Issa or Simon governorship to me would haven been even a worse
alternative. 
 True, there were some progressives out there helping the recall, but I
feel they were being used by the radical right to help steal another
election (remember Florida?) and do to Californians on a more local level
what Bush is doing to the rest of the country.
 The recall effort was mostly a hard right affair. When I watched the
recall rally in Sac the other week on C-Span, the crowd was 95% white,
the speakers were mostly right wing talk show hosts, spewing out one
racist, anti immigrant, homophobic remarks after another. I felt like I
was watching a KKK rally without the hoods. If this had really been a
real people's recall effort, not paid for by Issa, then I might have been
more inclined to join in. To ask me to sign a recall petition by a person
screaming "save the family and marrage (from the scourage of
homosexuality)"! "Save (white) California from being overrun by Mexicans
and immigrants!" would have asked too much from me and other more
tollerent Californians.
 But be as that may, it's done and we are facing a recall anyway. I
actually do favor one or Davis's efforts (the rest of his efforts are
silly) to postpone the recall for a couple of months: one, the counties
won't be ready and there will not be enough polling places to vote. When
the decisons have to be made to where to set up limited polling places,
where do you think they are going to be placed? In poor places? In places
that are more liberal? In places where people of color live? Voting will
be very difficult and that will disfranchize alot of people, mostly
people who will not normaly vote for a Republican. You will see plenty of
polling places and better machines in Orange County and Modesto, but
places like San Francisco and Oakland will be a different story.
 Two, most of the machines that will be used will be antiquated and the
temptation to cheat will be too strong.
 Three, this election will be too costly and if we can wait a few months,
we can get it done far cheeper, with more polling places up, have better
machines up and running and have more poll workers to run them and give
more people a chance to vote. 
Unless we have more time, I see this election as riged for the
Republicans to win.
 
 Who to vote for? I will vote NO for the recall as stated before, but may
vote for Arriana Hufffington or the Green Party candidate, not sure yet.
Bustamomte has jumped Davis's ship and is in and that changes things too.
Arnold Schwarzenegger isn't all that bad, he's for gay marriages, pro
choice and so forth, but I'm not convinced he will be taken serious
enough and is competent to be governor of a state of 33m people. Why is
he a Republican anyway? The Republicans absolutely hate him and will try
to sabotage his candidacy, and that is one big reason I may actually
consider voting for him. People like Gary Coleman, Larry Flint and
Gallenger add a European flavor to the election, but are not serious and
this election is serious. Again, the Republicans don't mind all this. The
people who may cast votes for the sarcastic candidates don't vote
Republican anyway, so more votes for the comics and porn publishers mean
more votes for the Republicans. Remember, who ever has the most votes
wins. There is no run off!

 But definitly yes, make sure you vote and register if you haven't. One
big effort I do ask of people to make this election more fair and not let
it become a coup for the Republicans is to make sure everyone has a right
to vote. Fight to make sure polling places are distributed fairly and
that the poor and people of color won't get shafted like they were in
Florida.

 Peace, Bodhi ^ _ ^

Remember, though, this will prevent you from voting in primaries.  My guess
is that the Democratic primary for presidential canidate is going to be
very close and exciting.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] nrr: a few job listings


The place next door to where I work is looking for a part timer.

It's a copy shop, but the owner is really chill, and you get the hook up
on flyers and such.

Pay is pretty schwaggy, but for a part time thing its not that bad.

Close to CCAC in oakland, so if you're going there, it could be a good
place for ya.

Interested?  Drop me a line, I'll put you in touch with them.

Where did word originally come from that Farina would be there? The 
email quoted below says a flyer, but when I first heard of this a week 
or two ago, I only knew of Migs & Doc Martin being there...  No mention 
of MF.

If you are on their mailing list, you got a flyer-attachment
with it.  The flyer says that mr. farina is on the bill.

BTW, it's free with the online flyer before 11, so i may still
stop by.  i'll be drunk, so i won't care.

Apparently Kit Kat is full of shit, says Om and Mark Farina:

"To all of our Mark Farina fans out there. We would just like
to know that Mark will NOT be playing at the Kit Kat 14th
Anniversary party being held at the End Up tonight. Mark has
been listed on the flyer as one of the DJs playing this party,
but was never hired to do so. Please beware of false
promotion."

just to give you a heads up, in order to keep funding alive for quote of the day, we're going to have to run 
more commercials.  so in the future, you'll be seeing more diligent sfr celebrities in prominent positions of 
advertising.  

also, since arnold schwartzanegger is running for governor, i've decided to step down and will not be 
running this time.

Where did word originally come from that Farina would be there? The
email quoted below says a flyer, but when I first heard of this a week
or two ago, I only knew of Migs & Doc Martin being there...  No mention
of MF.

two things to consider before you accept that proposal: 
 
a. will there be strays?  meaning, who will be coming to dinner? 
 
and
 
b. do you want to spend even 1 more second with the paranoid element, either chemically induced or socially induced or even worse, a dangerous cocktail of the two combined to create a complete regular set of problems and panic and a regular crowd of strangers who HAVE to be involved, because that is one way to create a community and to keep people in jobs, isn't it, even if it was supposed to be a simple picnic at the park, or simply an evening of television or maybe just coffee. :)

I have the e-Flyer, but isn't Kit Kat always free before 11 anyway?

Well... I just got back the test pressing of my 1st record; it's hard 
techno. My label is called EGR Records and I'll have a web site up soon 
once the full order arrives. I produced 2 tracks on it and the other 2 were 
split by producer friends of mine (Nadon & Hedmess). I engineered/mastered 
the tracks and sent them through the entire record creation process.  The 
results are on par with new records coming out for hard techno, so I'm very 
pleased. I'll be posting my set from Defcon that has the 3 tracks in the 
mix soon.

I am getting test pressings out to the appropriate DJs in the local area 
and beyond. I should have the first full run in a couple of weeks.

I have access to a fully loaded professional studio (Bloody Angle Compound 
/ Asphodel) which I have been working in for over a year. See 
http://audio.egregious.net/  for more info.

Currently, I'd be glad to assist other independent producers who want their 
tracks on vinyl. I'm down to do the mastering for free as long as the 
producer(s) go through with the entire process (lacquer, stamper, and small 
run of 300+ units) with the lacquer engineer/press I am working with at the 
moment.  I'm offering this opportunity for 20-30 records in order to build 
up my credits list, fine tune my engineering/mastering for vinyl for all 
genres, and to make contact/help other independent producers across all genres.

If this is of interest to anyone here do get in contact. I'd be glad to 
discuss the lacquer/pressing costs and other concerns. This is a "word of 
mouth" offer and only applies to producers interested in making records. I 
am not posting this offer on my audio web site 
(http://audio.egregious.net/). If you visit my mastering page you will find 
my standard rate.

A quick hint... Consider working with 2 to 3 producer friends to create an 
EP and split the cost 2 to 4 ways; with the deal I am offering this makes 
it within reach of pretty much anyone producing out there. Take the reins 
into your own hands and don't wait (and wait) for someone else to release 
your music! DIY!

Best,
--Mike

Subject: [sfraves] ***~~*ATTENTION RAVERS!!!*~~*** We have a chance to make OuR vOiCe KnOwN!!!!!!!!!

I just heard today that the California Supreme Court upheld the recall
election. 
So it's officially on! 
With all these candidates running, everyone will be looking for every
vote they can get.
So what does this mean for the rave scene?
Fuck yeah...you got it! 
It means that we have a golden opportunity to make our voice as ravers
known!

With my calculation, there are potentially 150k ravers in the state of
California and that means at least 100k of us can vote.
It hasn't hit us yet that we are potentially a good block or votes that
could make a candidate win or loose the election.
If we were to organize as one block of votes and could deliver a
candidate a hella lot of them, we will be taken speciously as a valuable
"special interest group" and would be listened to when we approach a
candidate with our issues.
100k potential votes? You bet we will be listened to! 
Not only that, but I bet the candidates will be after us to be listened
to!

So here's my idea.
We need to move fast on this and get organized,
and I propose that we have a meeting ASAP and stratigize what we can do
to get organized.
Who can be on this?
Promoters, producers, DJ's, organizations like Dance Safe, SFLNC, ROAR
and every day ravers who care about their scene and want to defend our
right to dance!
I believe with everyone doing their part and utilizing our talents,
contacts, and recourses as one big effort, 
we can become a big voting block that will make us noticed and listened
to.

If I, as one raver in Oakland tries to get the attention of candidates
like Schwarenegger or Arianna Huffington, chances I will not be listened
to.
But if they were approached by a voting block that represents 100k
potential votes, I and 99,999 other ravers will get their ears.

This doesn't have to be complicated or cost allot of money,
all that needed to be done to make this happen is for people to lay down
the drama, burry the hatchet with other ravers,
become one and think about the WHOLE rave community
and not just about ourselves and our own interests in the scene.

Our intent is to not officially endorse a particular candidate.
Our issue is the right to dance,
nothing else. 
Our intent is to bring to the rave community the positions candidates
have made on the right to dance and what they will do for us if elected
as governor.

They will have a position on us,
because 100k organized potential voters will make them have a position on
the right to dance. 

And from their position, we can inform the rave community who is the most
friendly toward us, 
and who is not.
And from that, ravers who make the right to dance one of their top 3
issues that will influence their decision on who to vote for 
will have important information that will help them make their decision,
no matter who that candidate may be.

My suggestion is to start local here in the Bay Area,
that can include Sac and the Central Valley as well.
Start our first organizational meeting here,
and then, with what we have put together, and who we have contact with
state wide,
organize state wide meetings and get this pushed quickly as one state
wide organization.
Timing is essential here!

If you think this is a good idea and want to participate,
hit the list with a good day to meet
and let's set our first organizational meeting no latter than one week.
If your on other lists,
PLEASE forward this idea to them
and let's get this going!

Hey, with what we have as far as smarts, creativity, tallents, contacts,
influences and numbers,
we can make a hella BIG influence on this election!
YES WE CAN!!!!!
We have the best oppertunity EVER given to us to make our voice known.

True, the anti rave bull shit is a federal issue and a governor can't
undo federal law,
BUT....
a governor of the most populated and influential state in the union being
on our side and speaking for us 
can be a powerful influence to not only resend the present anti rave law,
but keep the newer and more Draconian version from being passed.

California is always a trend setter.
Let's use our national influence to defend the right to dance 
from Portland Oregon to Portland Maine.
And we start by helping to elect a governor who will defend our right to
dance
>From San Diego to Ukiah first!
And as the Confucianist saying goes;

Let's begin the first step NOW!!!!!!

Its a great idea but the fact that Schwarenegger is even on the ballot and 
is deemed as having a good chance of winning means the world is really 
coming to an end or I just need to leave the place I swore I would call home 
for my entire life, Cali. Hopefully the world is just comig to an end so I 
dont have to figure out where to go.

Schwarenegger as Gov of CA. Thats a more ridiculious idea than George W. 
Bush as president of the United States. I think I hafta be Audi. I think I'm 
moving to Figi. Have fun voting. =D

AUDi,

I think mastering for vinyl and CD are two very different things.  Make
sure you know which media you are targeting before you make you decision.

hey everyone!
 
this is the cool part of my job...we're ordering movies...we're building our collection, which still doesn't have certain jane austen standards up to my expectations...sooooo...we're doing a  'must buy' list...and any movie, requested by our staff, regardless of it's 'rentworthy' ranking, can be bought and added to our collection..
 
sooo...
 
favorite flicks that you'd rent? 'cos we all know we just buy our cult films etc...whatever, hit back with what you wish you saw in the video store...our system still doesn't have a lot of fairly major/common/classic titles..so you probably don't need to be that obscure. we didn't have 'so i married an axe murderer..' that will soon change;)
 
cheers,

things to embark upon- including The Wheel of Sin, a tantalizing Bake Sale,

Subject: [sfraves] We have a chance to make OuR vOiCe KnOwN!!!!!!!!!

Let me just say this about Arnold. Right now, he's all the uh.... "rave",

but, he's already beginning to fumble as a politician and I don't know if
he will make it in the real political world, no matter how rich and
popular he is.
But that's my opinion, 
and he is pretty much central on many issues,
pro gay rights, pro choice, pro education funding, etc.
The Republican Party absolutely hates him and that is the reason why Bill
Simon is running.
So if you are more liberal inclined, he's not all that bad.
Would you rather have Arnold or Simon as governor, speaking to the
progressives?
Being from Germany, he actualy might be way more receptive to us than
Simon.
Enough of that.

What I'm proposing is so simple, and if the rave community can come
together and pull our recourses in one effort,
WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE!
What will make this hard is complacency.

I love California, not only because of diversity, the cool summer weather
and red wood trees, but because we are the epicenter of culture and
trends. 
If I ever leave California, it's because it's time for me to travel,
not so much who is governor.
California is worth fighting for,
and what we do as ravers in this election
WILL REBERATE ALL OVER THE NATION!
IF WE LOOSE OUR RIGHTS HERE
THE REST OF THE NATION WILL FOLLOW
IF WE STAND UP FOR OUR RIGHTS HERE,
THE REST OF THE NATION WILL FOLLOW.
Think about it,
we are trend setters,
IT'S ABOUT TIME WE ORGANIZE
AND START STANDING UP FOR OUR RIGHTS!
We don't realize what our effort can do for raving all over the nation!
We need to realize that we do have influential power over who will be
governor,
Again, what will cause us to forfeit that influence is 
COMPLIANCY!

We only need three substantial things 
TO EXERT OUR RAVER POWER,
a web sight,
getting the word out about our web sight
and people getting together and making this happen.

The web sight will contain interviews we will have with the candidates on
their issues about the right to dance
and who we feel is our friend and who is not on this issue.
We will NOT endorse a candidate,
but inform and let the raver decide who to vote for.
Hell, this is something Jack Triumph, CPT Scarlet and someone like me can
work on together!

It can be something like this,
We approach a candidate and tell this candidate that we are from an
organization called something, say like "RTD" (right to dance).
We tell them that we have a well known and visited web sight that
represents 100k potential voters 
and that we would like to have an interview with them on the issue about
our right to dance.
100k voters.
With these candidates needing every vote they can get,
YOU BET WE WILL GET AN INTERVIEW!
You and I can't do it alone,
BUT "RTD" CAN!

This is NOT my idea.
It belongs to the rave community in California
and YOU are needed to make it happen!

Don't run, Galvin, 
help the rave scene!

Peace, Bodhi ^ _ ^

Subject: [sfraves] Re: Mastering? SRR

At 05:51 PM 8/8/2003 +0000, you wrote:
>I think mastering for vinyl and CD are two very different things.  Make

I had this presumption as well before completing the process recently. The 
lacquer engineer I work with reassured me there is no "magic pixie 
dust";  "If it sounds good on CD it will sound good on vinyl".
IE there is no magic transform in the lacquer cutting process.  This 
certainly held true with my experience.

There are of course differences with the final medium. You have more leeway 
with a CD (digital sources) in regard to wild phase issues especially in 
the low end among other issues.  If you wanted to you could hard pan back 
and forth the bass kick or other heavy low end sources and it would come 
out fine on CD, but would not work so well (if at all) for vinyl.

When I master I check for many possible problems that might make the 
lacquer difficult to cut. If the mix I receive has issues that might 
prevent it from making a good record I'll be up front about it and discuss 
options on how it can be made better.

I also provide the option to mix & master multitrack projects; there are a 
lot of benefits to doing this as I have access to some top gear for the 
mixing process (focusing on single tracks/sub groups).

I do want to point out that I am not working with only software for 
mastering. I am working with thousands of dollars of top of the line 
hardware and a pro A/D/A converter. The majority of high profile mastering 
engineers are using the same equipment I am.

I did leave off my last post that I do provide a partial reference CDR 
before the vinyl order, so that the producer might approve of the 
mastering. This allows the producer to play it on a variety of systems to 
understand how it translates; not only to different sound systems, but how 
the vinyl will sound. However, all the tracks will have 30 seconds to a 
minute cut off each track, so the producer can not walk away with a digital 
master without completing the vinyl process.  I am not offering free 
mastering for CD. I am offering free mastering for those who want vinyl.

This _word of mouth_ offer will stand up to when I complete 20 to 30 
records.  I won't post again here about it until I complete/master at least 
10 records. This is a SRR topic and is a borderline BSP, so email off list 
with questions, so I can hold true to my last statement! I'll answer any 
questions raised on list though... ;)

Best,
--Mike

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: BIKINI WAX!  (Saturday - 8/9 @ Sublounge)


We may not have enough money to muster a federal
recall (and lets face it, if we did have that much
scratch we'd probably have very different feelings
about the Admin), but we do have enough anti-Bush
beats to wear out your brand-new dancing shoes. 

DJs adminstering your BIKINI WAX appointment this
month include: 
Mancub (Space Cowboys)
Shank (:code/DNA Lounge / Cloud Factory)
& resident 
DJ Hello My Name Is Josh (aka 8 Ball/Space Cowboys)

Something's been bothering me lately about this whole
BSP thing. Sure people want to hear who the special
guests are, but what about the bartenders? Just as
much as the DJs, I would say the bartenders have the
power to make your night a magical one. So I'm going
to start what I hope will be a new trend by adding the
bartender's names to the BSP. 

Torturing your liver from the flip-side of the bar: 
Saucey-Bossy Vern (Paradox Lounge), Roy L
(Sublounge/Space Cowboys) & Fast Eddie (Sublounge)

everything is on the minute with us today, so, with that said, i didn't want to make any last minute invites or anything that would have to make things any speedier for anyone than they already are, as tempting as it is to do so. i don't know that pressure makes anything really happen other than discomfort anyway. i have to get it together so that i have a getaway car anyway. can't get away without the getaway car, can you? :)

Sheesh, is it possible that a dj who is trying to promote himself, not in 
contact with the promoter of the event 24/7 will not know the updated dj 
list second to second? I appologize for being behind on my up-to-date 
knowledge about this event and I am sorry for having mis-lead some people 
into believing that ORACLE is playing at this particular event, which he is 
not. This is all news to me at this point, please don't shoot the messanger, 
I am NOT the promoter, if you have questions reguarding the line-up for the 
evening, please email the contact at the bottom of this email, thank you. 
Once again, I appologize for the confusion.

Subject: [sfraves] GANJA RIGHTS: There is a little bit of hope.

 I've been watching off and on Lou Dobb's special reports on the drug
war. Today, he had John Walters, the drug czar, on saying how dangerous
marijuana was, kids naturaly being the argument. I can tell how he was
interviewing Mr. Walters that he thought the guy was an idiot. I loved
Lou Dobb's attitude when he asked him about the medicinal use of
marijuana. All Mr. Walters could say was how dangerous pot was to kids.
 Anyway, they had a poll asking the audience if they were for or against
the legalization of pot. I figured it would be somewhere around 65%
against and 35% for.
Nope, to my surprise it was 93% for and 7% against!
We do have some hope!
Peace,  Bodhi

Subject: Re: [sfraves] world of stereo 2


Got my rane mixer there cheaper than any price i could even find 
on the net.  The place seems a bit shady but if you know
what you want you can haggle them to a good price.

Just rememeber to Haggle! It ain't guitar center.

The rane mixer was box sealed and was fine.

What times would those be?  The times they're participating in an 
online poll totally lacking any scientific validity?

If 92% of the country wanted to legalize it... it'd be done already.

Keep telling yourself that. When the government decides that they can make
more money off of it being legal, rather than illegal, maybe that will
happen...but considering that just last year over 575,000 people were busted
on personal possesion charges, and the average possesion charge makes around
$500-600 for the state ( that translates into $287,500,000 per year give or
take a few dollars, lol), the government sure as shit ain't gonna legalize.
In less than a 10 year period of time, our lovely country dumped over 214
BILLION dollars into anti-marijuana legislation. Not anti DRUG, that was
just for marijuana. This country is ass backwards when it comes to archaic
drug laws. Any time a political figure has a study done on mary jane and
it's effects, facts overwhelmingly point to it being more or less harmless
(the exception being carcinogenic effects if you smoke it as opposed to
eating it), yet it still remains illegal. How many states have lobbied to
legalize, and how many times has the federal government basically said "NO
EFFIN' WAY!"?

It ain't happenin' any time soon, and that has no bearing on how many people
do or don't want it legal.....

and once again referring to that 575,000 that got popped for possession,
let's consider for a moment how many people DIDN'T get popped who smoke. I
bet you could multiply that number by quite a few to get your answer. It's
not a matter of number of people for or against...it's a matter of  dollar
ammount......

Subject: [sfraves] NRR - In memory of Brian

My cat Brian was put to sleep yesterday. He developed kidney and pancreas
failure as a result of feline leukemia. The illness came about fairly
quickly. Last week he was fine and then on Monday he stopped eating and
seemed to be pretty miserable. On Wednesday my roommate, Karyn, took him to
the vet where we discovered that his illness was not treatable and the vet
suggested that he be euthanised so that he wouldn't spend his last days
suffering in pain. The vet was able to give him fluids intravenously so that
he could spend one last night at home with us. We tried to make his as
comfortable as could be and gave him lots of attention and love on his last
night with us. The next day we took him back to the vet to be euthanised. It
was probably one of the hardest things I've ever had to do but I knew that
it was for the best.

Brian was originally a stray cat who appeared in our backyard one day. Since
he was a stray cat, we started calling him Brian after Brian Setzer from the
band, The Stray Cats. We started leaving a bowl of food and water out for
him. He was skittish at first but he eventually began to trust us. I got a
cat trap from the SPCA and caught him so that I could take him in to be
neutered and given shots. I had no idea if he would stick around after I
brought him back to the backyard after his ordeal at the SPCA. Sure enough
he kept coming back and eventually after much effort, I was able to gain
enough trust to let me pet him. Things progressed fairly rapidly and he
realized that nothing bad would happen to him around us and he trusted us
completely eventually becoming the total co-dependant, loving lap cat. He
was always a good cat and never got into mischief.

Today we had a memorial for him and buried him in my back yard and planted a
lemon tree in his memory.
Most people say that Brian was lucky to have such kind owners but I think we
were lucky to have him in our life as long as we did. Brian was a good
friend and I'm going to miss him terribly.


Sean

yeah.. that's why I was wondering whether it was ok or not.  prime 
tenderloin location.  adult videos in the back.  I haggled with the guys a 
lot and got a killer deal.  The SL-1210M3D's were $380 a pop and the 
Stanton mixer was $100 cheaper than the best price I'd seen on the net.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR - In memory of Brian

I totally and 100% hear you man. I love my babies (my kitties Mouse and
Lucy)and they'll be out in the Bay area before me (they're leaving this
morning w/ my GF to move out there). They're gonna be there for 3 + weeks b4
me, and I'm already kirking out. Cats I think (at least to ME) are more like
people then any other pet, and I understand what it's like to lose one. I
hope you do ok after this. Just remember, get another baby kitty that
reminds you of your cat....it'll come to you when you shop around....they
always come to you like they KNOW you're for them and vice versa. Your cat
will live on in memory and heart, and there'll be another to not take it's
place, but be there to take up where your cat left off. Chin up man....I
feel for you, but it'll get better.

Much love and respect!
Hope to meet you amongst others when I get out there in 3 weeks....

if that were the case, medicinal marijuana wouldn't exist in California, 
because the feds could've bought the populace out.  In fact, they cannot - 
if 92 % of us vote enabled citizens thought pot should be legal, it would 
be.  no question.

According to an e-mail I got from Om records, Farina wasn't ever hired to
play so he didn't.  Caveat emptor...

This brings up something strange-

One of my old cats just died the other day as well,
and through that it occured to me-

Why is it almost routine to have dogs and cats
euthanized "to end their suffering"-
And at the same time it's comparitively unheard of for
humans to do the same to other humans?

PARTY DETAILS:

PEACE MELON DAY PARTY
Saturday, August 16th: NOON - 7 p.m.
Cafe Cocomo
650 INDIANA STREET
$7

Please join Andrew, Christian, Cece, Lisa, Geneva & Michael, Zander, Tim & 
Megan, Veronica (Vee) & Bob, Maciek, Tim & Eric as we prepare for the playa.

What is Peace Melon?
Well, glad you asked. Peace Melon takes some of its spirit from those crazy 
Octane Parties. We decided that best of all we like to hang out with 
friends, and make new ones along the way. So, on the Playa we will be 
creating a little oasis full of shade for new and old friends to get 
together, and enjoy a little libation of watermelon, other fruits and alcohol.
Utilizing the power of the triangle, we will be creating a very large shade 
structure that if seen from the sky will resemble a butterfly; each 
individual part of the butterfly will look like a slice of luscious slice 
of watermelon. We will have decks and a long line-up of folks lending a 
hand to make for a fantastic musical and gastronomical feast.
Join us on the playa, when the shade runs long we will bust out our Melons 
to be passed around and enjoyed as one.

Featured Flavors of Music @ THE MELON DAY PARTY:
+ Ms. E (FutureBreaks, SisterSF)
+ Scott Carrelli (Satellite, Qool)

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

let's do leather pants boy first....if a really classy guy who dresses well, but never wears leather pants, suddenly showed up to dinner in leather pants, i'd be thinking that maybe he might want me to spank him, and i would probably ask him first if that was what he was looking for in the evening. :) :) hahaha, also, i was thinking about good parties back in the day, and i miss it when there was more than one party that i actually not only wanted to peek in on, but stay for, and there was this one night where i was at one party, and it was all warm outside, and i was with a lot of people i had just met who all liked to go to raves to dance and to socialize without loosing their minds, like a totally chill crowd, and i was hanging out with them and getting a really great shoulder massage from one of them who, incidentally was totally hot, which is never a problem, and then i recieved an invite to go to another gig that was taking place somewhere else, and i just couldn't resist,
 because i knew the music was going to just be bumping like mad, so i left the cute boy, and went off on a small trip and it was so great. :)

people playing tonight I've totally gotton into. A casual reminder for =
those afraid of techno - Amalgamation - prime time slot - Chris Jackson =
upstairs with the whole place going off - Andy W downstairs tearing shit =
up and turning that floor into a sweaty mess. Guess you all liked what =
you heard. That said come to this party. Mike Migurski, Terry, and =
myself will be tag teaming visuals. I'm trying out the new Arkaos 3.0 =
application controlled with an Oxygen 8 using all new content I've been =
working on today. Should be a mindfuck if things go as I think they =
will.

Next party to stop by gives you a $5 discount if you come to Andy's =
party first. That's a $5 party folks featuring everyone except Oracle. =
He won't be playing in case no one heard that all week. =3D)  The party =
is called BetterFun and is a burningman camp benefit party to fund the =
fun on the playa that these girls have in store. The location is less =
than 5 minutes from Andy's record release party. Makes it damn easy to =
party hop and get the best of both worlds.

What's that all mean?=20

$15 // 2 parties. That's the cost of getting into a club tonight where =
you inevitably will spend another $40+ on drinks or your choice of party =
favors. That's a steal folks.

Come play in the EastBay tonight - ALL NIGHT !!

will be sold at this party, so everybody is encouraged to bring their
food and drink, although there will be grills onsite for those that
want to BBQ--make sure to bring the charcoal and burgers! RCP West is
also collecting school supplies and new or used school age clothing

Sunday, August 10, 2003 ** In Touch Collective Presents Stand Up!
Shout Out!  *MASSIVE FREE RAVE-ACT PROTEST!! **

=2E..Brings you a different kind of dance in which we will be focusing
on the recent laws and bills that have been presented to us as we
take in refreshing beats of the DJs to help keep your mood. This will
be an activist dance in which we will be gaining not the attention of
average ravers or clubers but we will be demanding the attention of
those who do not know about the recent laws that have recently come
into play.

The gathering will be held at the San Francisco Civic Center
courtyard, outside under the beautiful sky from 12 noon until 8pm
that night. We are fully permitted with the City of San Francisco and
this will be a 100% free gathering as this is a 100% non profit
event. We have setup a donation to help us pay for the sound permit
which is costing us a chunk of change. We will be accepting donations
at the gathering and we also have setup a PayPal account online at
the following link. If we can even get $1 from each person it will
fully pay for the sound permits. 100% of the donations go to the
permits.

As mentioned previously we will also will have a great lineup of DJs
to help keep you enlightened throughout the day as well as public
speakers at the tops of the hour. Public Speakers TBA...

was going to be a worldwide success after hearing just a taste of his
production work, Paul Oakenfold himself called and invited the artist to
join him on tour dates through the US to Ibiza after hearing him play just
once. Location: 1015 Folsom St., San Francisco Doors: 10pm-6am, 21+ w/ID

I bought a djm 600 from w-o-s for $800 the head phones weren't connected to the master section and anything assigned to CF-B would just cut out... but i kept hassling them until i came away with a brand new 600 and a free flight case!!!

i don't know where you are coming from, but, i can tell you that civic center is off of market street in s.f....it is about mmmmmmm 3 or 4 long city blocks away from the union square area....not towards the bay...if you are at union square and you go towards the bay, you are in the wrong direction...you need to go back the other way. that will make total sense to some, none to others...landmarks? city hall...if you see city hall, you are in the right place. :)

Subject: [sfraves] [BSP] Estuary :: Mon Aug 11 :: Apollo (Moksha Tribe)

DON'T FORGET...

Estuary :: Open Deck Weekly 

Monday August 11, 2003
9:00 pm - 2:00 am 
Masse's Nightclub :: 21+ w/ID, Free
Featured Guest :: Apollo (Moksha Tribe)

Estuary :: (Noun) 1. Where the river blends with the sea. 
2. A place where all styles mix.

We've decided to change the format of the night. Now it's...

In the back room we have "first come first served" open deck slots. 

In the main room signups will be for the following week. At 10pm you
can put 
your name on the list of djs who want to spin the following week and we
will 
set the lineup. This allows for several things: 

1) We can group the genres together, which is more pleasing for the
audience than radically changing styles every 1/2 hour.

2) Starting the signups at 10pm gives you more time to get there,
especially 
for those coming from places like San Francisco and Marin County.

3) You will have a whole week to tell your friends exactly what time
you will 
be spinning, so that they can come and support you.

If you have no skills at all, but have some cool tracks that you'd like
to 
share, you are just as welcome as anyone else! 

* Please bring needles and headphones. If you don't have your own, find
a friend to share with! * 

This week's line-up:
9:00pm :: Steve Miguel (Hip Hop)
9:30pm :: Lewt (Jungle)
10:00pm :: Deveourn (Trance)
10:30pm :: Bert (Prog/Trance)
11:00pm :: DJMock (House)

Featured Guest:
11:30pm :: Apollo (Funky House)

12:30am :: DJ JacobB (Hard House)
1:00am- 2:00am :: Micah & Jagged Mettal O (Industrial Tag Team)

Added bonuses:
$2 STRONG Islands
FREE pool tables
Outdoor smoking patio
NO COVER CHARGE!!! WOOHOO!!
21+ up w/ ID, please

Masse's Nightclub

"Security is mostly a superstition.  It does not exist in nature, nor do 
the children of humans as a whole experience it.  Avoiding danger is no 
safer in the long run than outright exposure.  Life is either a daring 
adventure or nothing."
-Helen Keller

"Compassion is not a relationship between the healer and the wounded.  It's 
a relationship between equals.  Only when we know our own darkness well can 
we be present with the darkness of others.  Compassion becomes real when we 
recognize our shared humanity."
-Pema Chodron

Something is wrong here: sex has been with us since the human race began, yet I would estimate that ninety percent of human beings still suffer from enormous inhibitions in this area.    -Xaviera Hollander

This is really sad news.  Happy and crew put together one of the most 
innovative weeklies in the Bay.  I'm hoping that they find a new venue soon.

Much love,

Apollo

I just cast my vote.  Here is a related article:

BUSH PLAYS POPE ON MARRIAGE ISSUE
Robert Scheer, AlterNet
Whether you are united in "holy matrimony" or simply trying to build a 
lasting relationship should be of no concern to the state.

I just headed on over and cast my no vote.  Not only is it interesting
how close it is with No being ahead right now but... So far this poll
has had 14mil people vote!  That is huge!  None of this 1000 person
focus group poll but 14mil people.  Anyways..  I don't want my tax
dollars going to legislation that shouldn't involve the state in the
first place.  I cast no.

Subject: [sfraves] Re: NRR Go vote!

I'm thinking that, let's say Bush and the Republicans get their way about preventing gay "marriage" for religious reasons... but the discourse opens eyes to the sensibility of gay civil unions, which should logically be permitted under the 14th Amendment of the Constitution. That would be a big step, to get civil unions legalized. 
With social progress, it's great to make huge leaps, but the small steps add up, too. For example, not many years ago it was illegal in some parts of the US for different races to mix ("miscegenation") and now it's accepted (although with some sad pockets of resistance).

It's a great thing that bush is against gay marriages, I fully support his

think it's good he is against it. =) He is not getting re-elected..He most

No, the poll site has had 14 million votes so far.  That's very 
different from 14 million people voting.

I agree with your idea, but not your words - the whole problem hinges on 
the actual word marriage - in many religions, marriage is the religious 
sacrament that's holy and designed to propagate - a test which homosexual 
unions naturally (but not necessarily socially) fail.  We should take the 
term "marriage" out of law completely, secularize unions, and make them 
open to any combination.

Highest Entropy Beats

By Chris Blohm on August 8, 2003 01:59 PM

Who has enough time in the day to listen to all radio stations? MIT has set
up banks of computers to do the listening for us. They know what you really
want to hear. Eigenradio plays only the most important frequencies, only the
beats with the highest entropy.

If you took a bunch of music and asked it, "Music, what are you, really?"
you'd hear Eigenradio singing back at you. When you're tuned in to
Eigenradio, you always know that you're hearing the latest, rawest, most
statistically separable thing you can possibly put in your ear.

Eigenradio makes its optimal music by analyzing in real time dozens of radio
stations at once. When our bank of computers has heard enough music, it will
go to work on making more just like it. Since we listen to so much music all
the time, Eigenradio is always on and always live. What you hear on
Eigenradio is the best of the New Music, distilled and de-correlated. One
song on Eigenradio is worth at least twenty songs on old radio.

Visit the site to tune in at: http://eigenradio.media.mit.edu/

"Security is mostly a superstition.  It does not exist in nature, nor do 
the children of humans as a whole experience it.  Avoiding danger is no 
safer in the long run than outright exposure.  Life is either a daring 
adventure or nothing."
-Helen Keller

"Compassion is not a relationship between the healer and the wounded.  It's 
a relationship between equals.  Only when we know our own darkness well can 
we be present with the darkness of others.  Compassion becomes real when we 
recognize our shared humanity."
-Pema Chodron

Subject: [sfraves] Review: SCORE (gay rave at sex club; wordy but interesting) DELETE if offended

Hmmm, all of you party people out there who are open-minded and like debauchery,
I checked out this monthly party at Club 220 in the trendyloin this weekend.

I have been to this spot before and liked the no-holds barred attitude,
something that appeals to me due to a repressed childhood as a preachers kid.
(You might see naughty bits every now and then).

The bouncer was a burly, intimidating fellow who asked me if I was a dancer. At
first I said No because I am not on the staff, but then I said, Yes because
I am a dancing queen.

He asked me what was in my gym bag, which actually contained extra underwear for
changing (they have lockers).  I was also carrying a small flask of Bourbon (Jim
Beam brand) to reduce my uptight tendencies. This was an underwear party and I
was ready to take off my pants, no sex intended. You all know how hot and sweaty
rave dancing can become.

I know some of these people from last year when they were trying to start a rave
event. Terrance, the venue owner, is so nice that he apologized to me for the
increase in nearby parking fees. I said, Hey, this is San Francisco, its lucky
just to have a place to park. Nevertheless, he was genuinely apologetic. This
is the Tenderloin, so they will escort you TO AND FROM your car at the corner
lot. I thought this was a nice touch, kind of like the way the way to treat a
lady, LOL.

Markie, one of the staff dancers, is a well-endowed, slim young guy with
bleach-blonde hair and a sweet personality. The older men really like his style
(its an oral attraction). Once, he told me that I was shy, which is genuine
when see someone that you like and everything is exposed. 

Markie likes the way that I dance, and he paid me heart-felt compliments that
night regarding my hair (spiked blonde style), trendy glasses (Im blind without
them), and overall appearance. I am slimmer now and it feels good to hear
personal comments from a local porn star. Markie is in some gay porn movies that
you can buy in the Castro.  He has flat abdominal muscles that comprise a
youthful appearance (he is cute).

The advertised headliner for the night was a major gay porn star (Matthew Rush)
from Falcon home video. He exposed everything for the event attendees during a
brief appearance on the stage. Talk about letting it all hang out. That was
quite a show of full frontal nudity (a rarity in the Texas bible belt, my home
state).

Earlier in the evening (if you consider 1 a.m. the evening), I started dancing
in white designer briefs and the blacklight made them look so cool. It was fun
to shake around the floor to the fluffy trance music. 

After a while, I switched to JOE BOXERs that glow in the dark with a happy,
smiley face. That was also an attention getter. I met an Asian TV (transvestive)
who flashed me, tried some frottage, and asked me if I liked her nipples. She
dragged me into a nearby video booth, but crotch rubbing with a TV is not a
turn-on for me. I dashed back to the dance floor, and she said, Come back when
you are hard.  The funny thing is that she followed me upstairs because when I
was dancing HARDer, I saw her sitting nearby, watching intently.

I also met a French guy who was really into ear lobes. Guess everyone has a
different twist on erotica, but it was nice to experience the gentle, masculine,
ear-lobe lick (talk about safe sex.)

These interpersonal reactions occurred downstairs at the sex club. When you get
tired of dancing you can cruise through a sleazy video arcade, stop by a
mini-theater with a big-screen TV playing gay porn, or surf the net
(uncensored) in a computer lounge. 

Yes indeed, the basement has gay sex club action and upstairs has
state-of-the-art sound systems and lighting for raving. Terrance spent some
money on upgrades here. Club 220 is a fun place to dance or score, as they
call it.

Greg VP

Subject: Re: [sfraves] [Politics] Take an active part - CA voter info (long)

This was all planned back in 2001:
==================================
Aug. 11, 2003  |  Arnold's secret meeting with Kenny Boy

If you're compiling a list of public figures even less popular in 
California than Gray Davis, one name is likely to top it: former Enron 
chairman Kenneth "Kenny Boy" Lay. Voters in the Golden State are 
behaving like sheep these days, but even the dimmest of them can 
probably remember how Enron and the other corporate vultures descended 
on them during the electricity "crisis" of 2001.

What California voters may no longer remember, however, is that after 
the third wave of rolling blackouts hit their state, Kenny Boy quietly 
summoned a select group to the Beverly Hills Hotel on May 11, 2001. And 
they may also have forgotten that one of the prominent Republicans who 
showed up at Lay's request was Arnold Schwarzenegger.


On June 21, 2001, the Associated Press reported that "Lay met secretly 
with California Republicans at the Beverly Hills Hotel and pushed a plan 
that called for ratepayers to pay the billions in debt racked up by the 
state's public utilities. The plan contended that federal investigations 
of price gouging are hindering the situation." According to William 
Bradley, the L.A. Weekly's sharp political columnist who wrote about 
Enron for the American Prospect, the meeting revolved around Lay's plans 
to "preserve deregulation" in California. The L.A. Times noted that Lay 
was seeking the support of Schwarzenegger and the other GOP luminaries 
for even greater deregulation. Apparently Lay wanted help in saving a 
lousy system, squeezing the unfortunate Californians even more, and 
avoiding accountability for their plight.

Only those who were present -- including then-Mayor Richard Riordan and 
convicted junk-bond fraudster Michael Milken -- know exactly what 
happened at Lay's covert conference. The meeting briefly became an issue 
early in the 2002 governor's race, after Riordan opportunistically 
attacked Davis over the governor's telephone contacts with Lay during 
the crisis. "What is Gray Davis trying to hide?" he demanded. But then, 
instead of answering pointed questions about the Beverly Hills meeting, 
Riordan quickly backed off from the Enron angle.

Subject: [sfraves] THRESHOLD was So Dope!

OK... so there was no way in Hell that I was gonna miss party!!  I mean... I scrounged up money & saved all week & had money for the party!  I mean... seriously..I can't get enough all Techno shindigs... ya know!!!  I mean...

Anywaze... Chris Jackson (that fuckin' pretty boy techno & electro DJ la la la) spun 1st... Hello 2Day... it was an Awesome set!!  Good shit man!!  I mean... he even spun this "Salsa" Techno track (yeah... Salsa Techno... LOLOLOLOLMAO)!!  I mean... it was a Mondo Groovy set!!  If I remember correctly... his last 2 songs were both electro &it was a perfect end 2 his set! I Loved It! I Love Chris Jackson!

Wow... he made it hard alota the whole time & there oh oh oh oh... ok... well... towards the end of his set... he spun my favorite techno song!!  i dunno the name of it.. but I know it when I hear it!!!  But everything that led up to that song was nice, hard, & yummy!!!  I Loved it!!  I mean... I'm know I'm like mondo lame hear 'cause I know he musta spun like a few of his own tracks, but I didn't know what they were!

Oh yeah... it was also Groovy hangin' out w/ Tim Xavier 'cause he's so chill man!!!  I mean... he's like Hella funny 2 talk 2 & 1 of my Groovy moments of the night was when HIm & Andy were talkin' about producing tracks & all that producer talk gargin stuff... I Loved It!!  OK... yeah... Tim's Dope 2 kick it w/!!  Grrr...I 4got 2 take a pix w/ him!  Oh yeah... he even told me that Spain is the Techno Hot Spot country!!!  Let's go fly there!

Andy went on next... Heeeeeello 2Day... I Loved his set 2!!!  OK... he spun Techno... I think I heard bits of Hardcore in his set... I'm pretty sure I heard bits of Ghetto Tech in his set!!!  Oh Gosh man... I think this was the 1st set of Andy's, in a while, that I didn't see his lap top comp hooked up 2 the decks & he strait spun records... right???  But Fucki'n A man...

Then Matt Holland went on next... he got in w/ the Techno 4 a while & well... I was pretty pooped by this point but dancing as much still, but I could sworn he went like House a lil' while during his set & like strait back 2 techno... I mean... it was like soooo quick when he did that like switch off I guess... I dunno!!

I didn't get 2 dance as much as I wanted 2 'cause I 4got my earplugs, so to compensate... I would dance in like various parts of all the sets in the back or sometimes like in the front when I could stand it!

Yeah... the vibe was pretty thick!!  I mean... it was a total family affair & it was sooooo Dope seein' every1 who showed up!!!  Hello 2Day...I finally got 2 hang out w/ Jbot 4 more than 5 minutes this time around!!! Oh oh oh... & it was Dope hangin' out w/ Clarity after hella daze!!!

Subject: [sfraves] .: Live Sets from Dirtbox : Kind Bass Inc : PiC :.

Biggidy Boh!

This Sunday's Kind Bass Inc Takeover was another successful night,
featuring many a bad ass tune played by many a bad ass DJ.  Whighzeguy &
Miguel B opened up the night with some liquid funk action, followed by
Bassmachine with some darker tunes, IllEffect went straight for the
jugular with his special brand of turntablism-spiced jungle action, Direct
Logic gave us a special dose of Breaks, and Partners in Crime ODJ,
Hooligan, and Jerel closed the night off with yet another wide variety of
quality drum 'n' bass muzak.

All in all it was a good time, and most worthy of a re-listen (cos y'all
were all tuned in, right?).  Sets are below, in 56k realmedia and 128k mp3
formats.

after...or maybe not.

Subject: [sfraves] Cyberfest, no Kraftwerk?

Apologies if this has already been talked about, but
I'm just curious, so on this flyer listing for the
upcoming Cyberfest it says in big letters, 

"Kraftwerk" 

but then in way way fine print, it just says that it's
Karl Bartos <b>playing</b> kraftwerk anthems.  If i
recall, Bartos left the band a long time ago.  So
(excuse the metaphor) is it really worth seeing some
fifth beatle spin tunes from the white album?

Yes i know he drummed for them and sang, but that was
a long time ago.

so, i guess that if you were to post, your post would be better and more meaningful than this post. even if you are a human being, and you created a post, i am sure that you as a human being are far superior than any other human being to create a post, and furthermore, that makes me want to put my life in jeporady for you. at least someone like you might know how someone like i might best spend my life, because, wow, so far, even breathing must be a total waste of time if it isn't on your schedule or if it isn't predictable enough to give you some sort of order in your life. my point is that for some, one set of reproductive organs isn't enough. maybe you need two sets and, of course, a better mind. i haven't read all of the rave related info i've gathered yet.  :)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Cyberfest, no Kraftwerk?

Hi, this has been discussed to death but with many tangents. It sounded to me like Bartos is allowed by the current members of Kraftwerk to perform as "Kraftwerk" -- is that right? Whether this is worth seeing, i don't know. 

Massives and big names ... remember a couple years ago when "Eminem's D12" was supposed to be at Metropolis? Eminem was in D12 but they were also "presented BY" Eminem ... So would we see Eminem or not? As things turned out, D12 got kicked off the tour anyway, just as well. 

I would say, at one of these stadium type massives, don't go because of any one performer. Go for the whole experience, which includes checking out whatever sounds good, wandering around and talking to people, and maybe even missing somebody you intended to hear. 

I got my first Kraftwerk record in 1977! Is that old school or what?   :)

holy crap, you mean people still check INVIBE???

you know, i made that site back in 2000 after i got canned from an internet 
startup.  i designed the entire thing and would update it religiously every 
week with events and djs and ad banners and graphics...and i kept that up 
for a good year or so until it just became too much.  i got another job and 
slowly, the updating became less regular to the point where i only added 
photos.

however!  there are plans to relaunch the site with the help of some friends 
so...all i can say is be on the lookout for a new site later this year.

and thanks to anyone who actually used to visit the site.  it was labor of 
love.  peace out.

Huh, I remember seeing "eric idle perfoms monty
python" in the warfield a couple of years ago.  I was
all excited about it, but when I got there, it felt
really tired, really outdated, and not as good as even
the tv marathon shows - i hardly cracked a laugh, it
felt so contrived.  "doing this for the money"-meme

Yeah I did that at previous Cyberfest, and an
Ultrafest - the vibe wasn't as good (for me) as going
to a smaller.  Maybe it's just cos of the incredible
costs for anything there, but something was missing
from the atmosphere - an intimacy, or a closeness. Or
even a connection with the music.  It seemed like an
industry showcase for A&R ppl who really were looking
for product.

Anyway, I was considering going cos it was rumoured
that Kraftwerk was on the bill, but I guess not,
thanks for clearing it up!

My first exposure to them was the master of the flying
guilliotine soundtrack and countless reruns of
Sprockets.

Correl, a gay talk show host on KGO, recently commented on a story about
a Indian man and his wife being held by airport security for unusual
behavior and is suing for the "horror of being contained". 

True, security may have gone a little overboard, but Correl made the
point that as humiliated this man and his wife were, they don't know the
real horror of waking up each day and having your existence being polled.
  
You want to expirence a real horror? Whether I will be able to walk down
a street, even in the liberal bubble of the Bay Area, and not get beat up
today depends on the daily poll. If we can keep general acceptance at
50/50, I have a 50/50 chance I can go through a day  without experiencing
some form of homophobia. If the polls go down against tolerance, life
could become a potential real horror show, nothing like this Indian
couple went through. Gays and lesbians know all too well how this game
works.

I mean, were in the 21st century and you would think that we should, as a
society, be so done with the 19th century over homosexuality and that gay
rights and gay marriages should be so "what ever!" But we do live in a
society still hooked on religion, especially the fundamentalist type, and
naturally that not only explains our appalling ignorance about sex in
general, but why we as Americans can't accept the fact that homosexuality
is a natural phenomenon.

What we could see in the 2004 election, the Republicans running on a
diversion platform of defending traditional marrage and protecting
society from the "scourage of homosexuality". If they ran on their
economic and international record, they'd loose big time, especialy if
the truth about WMD's come out and people are still looking for jobs. But
if you can get people paranoid about homosexuality, people would rather
vote their fears rather than with their heads, and we could see a big
antigay back lash. 

The paranoia propaganda is starting in churches, and soon we will see it
hit society as a whole. Will Americans fall for it? When many Americans
learn about homosexuality from preachers, scandal tabloids, the Jerry
Springer Show and news about priests molesting boys (even though 90% of
child molestations are done by str8 men and in the traditional family
unit), I'm afraid they will. Gays in America are tollerated, not well
liked, and that tollerence, like ganja smoke is, poof... blowing away.
Were not, as a society, even secure about our sexuality, and one moment
so obcessed with it (most addicted to pornography), yet so punitive. You
can get a more draconian prision sentence for giving a 17 year old
consentual head than if you were to sell him crack or kill him. If were,
as a society, are so hypocritical and schizophrenic about straight sex, I
don't think gay society can expect better treatment.

We have remember when Hitler was democraticly elected, there was a open
and out gay scene in Germany at that time. Hitler tollerated it for a few
years, but within one year, gays and lesbians in Germany were suddenly
yanked from their gay clubs, beaches and bars, put in box cars and sent
off to consentration camps. We don't think it would happen here? The anti
gay propaganda machine is working overtime and I don't think we will know
what will hit us next year. The three big issuses of the Republicans in
2004:
war on terrorism
defending marrage and the family
stoping gay rights

Many Americans look on gays and lesbians as freak shows and people with
an incurable, infectious disease like TB. "We accept that you are gay,
but we have to keep you from infecting others, mostly kids, with
homosexuality". The only reason why Americans nominally accept gays and
lesbians is because we give good entertainment on the Jerry Springer Show
and that we live in sort of a don't ask and don't tell relationship with
society. With all these "victories" with sodomy laws being struck down,
potential legal gay unions and an election of a Episcopal bishop, we have
crossed the line of str8t comfortability and that's when 
the poll numbers will take a nose dive and our "rights" will be taken
away. We really don't have rights in America, but privileges, and because
were not playing by the rules and asking for too much, our privileges
will be taken away. Do you think gays and lesbians will fight back? They
didn't in Hitler's Germany, why will they here?

I said before that America will become the Nazi Germany of the 21st
century, and we're well on our way.
Peace, Bodhi ^ _ ^

Logistically, the tricky part is a sound system.

So it'd make sense for someone to bring an iPod or something with a 
short mix pre-loaded onto it, attach one of those low-range FM 
transmitters, and pump out the music from several battery-powered 
boomboxes clustered together in close proximity to the 'pod.  Several 
people can carry the boomboxes and converge onto the center and then 
take them with them when they disperse, ensuring that no one has to 
conspicuously show up with a shopping cart with a car battery and 
speakers hanging off of it.. :)

maybe it could be done *without* music?!?

in the news clip the people are just shouting "ping!"  "pong!"

we could go out and mimic and 4 on the floor beat, or a drum 'n' bass beat?

just start dancing and imitating breakbeats?  possible?

maybe?

Hrmm.. I guess that's pretty damn sensible for an outdoor flash rave, 
eh? For some reason, I kept envisioning a shopping mall.  Let's have a 
flash rave @ the next gubernatorial campaign rally in the Bay Area...

Autos...perhaps...depending on what you want to accomplish.  Leap into 
Market Street, have the cars block traffic, and so on.  Risky for the 
people with the cars.

A friend of mine recently joined some folks who went to a shopping mall 
and, at a pre-arranged time, dropped quarters on the floor and moved 
on.  Mind bending.  Fair number of these events happening lately.

There are any number of decent portable sound systems that could be used 
for a flash rave, including backpacks with integrated audio.

Love,

 Arianna Huffington is coming to town, so here's our chance

>From her e-mail:
Arianna Huffington is coming to the Bay Area tomorrow,
as she continues her inspiring campaign to become the
first independent, progressive and female governor of
the state of California. Tomorrow is her Bay Area debut.
And it is your first chance in the Bay Area to show your
support for Arianna in a public way! Plus, you have a
chance tomorrow to stand - alongside her - with Oakland's
youth who are fighting for their rights! 

We hope that you will come out. Arianna is the only prominent
candidate raising the need for: comprehensive campaign
finance reform, protecting and restoring the environment,
taxing the corporations and investing in schools (not
jails). She deserves your support. 

This will be a VERY short campaign. Every opportunity
to show your support will make a BIG difference in the
media and in Arianna's heart. So please, please come out!

Here's Arianna's schdule.  

WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 13 (TOMORROW!!!) 

Oakland "Kids First" Rally  
Noon - 1 pm  
Oakland Tech High School, 4351 Broadway (at 45th Street)
 
Due to state budget cuts, "free bus passes" for Oakland
kids have been eliminated from the budget. Now Oakland's
low-income youth will have to pay to get to and from school,
everyday - forcing many to drop out. Oakland's youth,
led by Kids First and Youth Together, are protesting this
awful decision - which amounts to a big tax on poor kids.
Meanwhile, California's corporations aren't paying anywhere
NEAR their fair share during this crisis. Arianna will
be at the youth rally to ask, "How can we be giving a
free ride to corporations in this crisis, when we can't
even give our kids a free ride to school?" Please come
out to show your enthusiasm for Arianna's campaign - and
to show your support for Oakland's youth. 

San Francisco Pep Rally for Arianna  
4 - 4:30 pm  
16th & Mission Street  
WE REALLY NEED YOU TO COME OUT FOR THIS! AND PLEASE BRING
YOUR FRIENDS! We are encouraging you to forward this announcement
widely. We will be conducting a short pep rally for Arianna,
encouraging her to keep fighting and speaking out for
what she believes in. (We want to surprise her with a
big turn-out, just to keep her inspired in between those
tough, grueling media interviews). We will ask her to
address the crowd briefly, and then we will turn the mike
over to her supporters. We want Arianna to know that people
in the Bay Area deeply admire her - and that we admire
the guts that she has shown by jumping into this race.
Also, there will be a LOT of media there, so it is our
first chance to let the WHOLE WORLD know that progressives
and independents are excited about Arianna and the issues
she is raising in this campaign. Please come! 

THURSDAY, AUGUST 14  
First Volunteers Meeting  
7 - 9 pm  
In SF, location TBA  
This will be your first opportunity to meet all the other
Arianna supporters in an official way, and to get plugged
into the campaign. You will be able to join committees,
get your questions answered and take on work assignments.
(We are still looking for a site, and will let you know
tomorrow where it will be.) It is very important for you
to come, and to bring your friends to the meeting. We
have a short period of time to elect Arianna. Let's make
it happen! 

If you can, please support Arianna's campaign by making
a donation at http://www.ariannaforgov.com/donate.html

Subject: [sfraves] RE: SCORE (gay rave at sex club; wordy but interesting) DELETE if offended

You know, the entire time I was reading your post, I was thinking not of what
SCORE might have been like.  I was having flashbacks to that one time, as that
last Happy Kids party at Army and Co. was getting busted, that Justin (aka. JJ)
sent a huge pack of candy ravers over to 220, saying that there was an
afterparty there.

Now *THAT* is a clash of cultures that makes me wish that there were pictures
on one of the rave pictures websites.  Hell, I almost wish I had gone myself. 
But a friend of mine was in no shape to drive, and Marty was kind enough to let
us stay and "help clean up".  And besides, Marty just got the party started
again right there at Army and Co., anyway.

Ah... fun times.


cya,
john

 Arianna Huffington is coming to town, so here's our chance

>From her e-mail:
Arianna Huffington is coming to the Bay Area tomorrow,
as she continues her inspiring campaign to become the
first independent, progressive and female governor of
the state of California. Tomorrow is her Bay Area debut.
And it is your first chance in the Bay Area to show your
support for Arianna in a public way! Plus, you have a
chance tomorrow to stand - alongside her - with Oakland's
youth who are fighting for their rights! 

We hope that you will come out. Arianna is the only prominent
candidate raising the need for: comprehensive campaign
finance reform, protecting and restoring the environment,
taxing the corporations and investing in schools (not
jails). She deserves your support. 

This will be a VERY short campaign. Every opportunity
to show your support will make a BIG difference in the
media and in Arianna's heart. So please, please come out!

Here's Arianna's schdule.  

WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 13 (TOMORROW!!!) 

Oakland "Kids First" Rally  
Noon - 1 pm  
Oakland Tech High School, 4351 Broadway (at 45th Street)
 
Due to state budget cuts, "free bus passes" for Oakland
kids have been eliminated from the budget. Now Oakland's
low-income youth will have to pay to get to and from school,
everyday - forcing many to drop out. Oakland's youth,
led by Kids First and Youth Together, are protesting this
awful decision - which amounts to a big tax on poor kids.
Meanwhile, California's corporations aren't paying anywhere
NEAR their fair share during this crisis. Arianna will
be at the youth rally to ask, "How can we be giving a
free ride to corporations in this crisis, when we can't
even give our kids a free ride to school?" Please come
out to show your enthusiasm for Arianna's campaign - and
to show your support for Oakland's youth. 

San Francisco Pep Rally for Arianna  
4 - 4:30 pm  
16th & Mission Street  
WE REALLY NEED YOU TO COME OUT FOR THIS! AND PLEASE BRING
YOUR FRIENDS! We are encouraging you to forward this announcement
widely. We will be conducting a short pep rally for Arianna,
encouraging her to keep fighting and speaking out for
what she believes in. (We want to surprise her with a
big turn-out, just to keep her inspired in between those
tough, grueling media interviews). We will ask her to
address the crowd briefly, and then we will turn the mike
over to her supporters. We want Arianna to know that people
in the Bay Area deeply admire her - and that we admire
the guts that she has shown by jumping into this race.
Also, there will be a LOT of media there, so it is our
first chance to let the WHOLE WORLD know that progressives
and independents are excited about Arianna and the issues
she is raising in this campaign. Please come! 

THURSDAY, AUGUST 14  
First Volunteers Meeting  
7 - 9 pm  
In SF, location TBA  
This will be your first opportunity to meet all the other
Arianna supporters in an official way, and to get plugged
into the campaign. You will be able to join committees,
get your questions answered and take on work assignments.
(We are still looking for a site, and will let you know
tomorrow where it will be.) It is very important for you
to come, and to bring your friends to the meeting. We
have a short period of time to elect Arianna. Let's make
it happen! 

If you can, please support Arianna's campaign by making
a donation at http://www.ariannaforgov.com/donate.html

Arianna makes more sense than you do, Captain Scarlett.

I think that is a succinct breakdown of the faulty thinking  that your
superiors ram down your throat.
You can not be held at fault, though. How can you kill towelheads if you see
them as Human Beings??

Maybe you don't actually carry a gun. Private Scarlet, maybe you are just a
glorified stock clerk, living out his war envy fantasies by beating up on
helpless liberals.

Do me a favor listen to the new mix I recorded and tell me if it is
worth the time to burn it to CD. I have no speakers at work and I
recorded last night and have not had a chance to listen. So listen to
the mix for me let me know what you think. Honesty is cool as long as it
is about the mix and not my hairline. Peace

Subject: Re: [sfraves] flash raves?

This will make you happy and get your bone nice and hard. Let's do a
flash rave at a Bill Simon rally!

I find it amusing that someone would trash a person like Arianna whom
they don't know anything about, probably never read her columns, never
heard her speak, and never heard her interviewed. Just because she's not
right wing PC, she is automatically called something like a "hippie
feminist bitch" or "whore" or something like that. Deleted dank's
original mail.
 This attitude is what makes me have a (perceived) pessimistic future or
America. Not that I'm actually pessimistic but being real. 
It's not about disagreeing anymore, it's about Ann Coulter (who preaches
defending Christian morality while wearing a mini skirt) style name
calling and character assassination to win your point. In a land of hate
talk radio, I call hate talk radio neo-Hitler style propaganda  (and I
believe that if Hitler was alive today, he would use talk radio to
espouse his Nazi views, Himler would have been so thrilled if they had
this technology back then!), we are devolving into such a mean, vengeful
and violent, mob justice society. No we haven't gone to the point where
we shove people in a colosseum and watch people kill each other or watch
enemies get eaten by lions, but were getting pretty close to it. Whether
we kill someone with words or with a sword, it's all the same mentality.
And because so many people fall for it, we're wide open to becoming a
fascist society. And most or us know what happened to societies that went
down that path.

I don't know, when someone talks about our school budget cuts, campaign
reforms, fair taxation and creating jobs, and they are called a hippie
feminist bitch for it without reading what she says, that make's me
wonder about the future or this country. No, It's not disagreeing with
her solutions, it's about calling someone a bitch as a rebuttal to her
policies, not only her, but anybody who doesn't tote the right wing PC
line.
 Being conservative is supost to be the "in" thing today, and Objectivism
is the latest hip philosophy, but like I say about super hip looking
Christian concerts with bands and rappers that sound like their secular
counterparts, it's all the same 'ole guilt ridden, fun hating, narrow
minded religion of our Puritan ancestors, just dressed up in modern
clothes. 

Yeah, liberalism has it's flaws, like all philosophies, and no, people
like Stalin were not real liberals but conservatives, but conservatism
has a sad past of downtrodding common people and defending, at the point
of a gun, the elite to rule and suppress the poor. When the common people
feel suppressed, who do they turn to for help? No, not the conservatives
who are usually the suppressors, but to liberals. Liberals are usualy the
people who clean up the financial and international messes conservatives
cause. When capitalism leaves people statving, it's the liberals who
fight for food. When people were getting slaughtered in the streets for
unions and worker's rights so we can have today unemployment insurance,
40 hour weeks and overtime pay, and guess who wants to take this all
away?, the only conservatives out in the streets were the ones who did
the slaughtering. Who was out there back in the day fighting for civil
rights, women rights and gay rights? Who is defending the right to dance?
Who is trying to supress it? What kind of government in Germany supports
a dance festival called "Love Parade"? What kind of government in Holland
supports a medical/safe approach to drug use? Tell me, how many pioneers
and innovators of the rave movement were hard line
Hannely/Coulter/Limbaugh KSFO conservatives?
No, I don't think conservatism is a cool, hip philosophy to follow!
Peace, Bodhi ^ _ ^

Hey sfravers...

If you or someone you know has a truck or a van and
can carry a bed, a dresser, a tiny 2 ft shelf, and
some boxes then we can talk.

I'm moving on saturday and need a vehicle to transport
my stuff. (within east bay)I do not have a lot of
stuff. You would be paid 50 dollars (price
negotiable). Let me know if you're interested! Thanks!

Delia

how to distinguish one from the other without getting anyone's attention for it...like, anything could be totally taken personally at any point....okay, so more van halen, because, at least they consistantly produce music that isn't just tolerable, but actually enjoyable...you want to hear it more than twice, and you want more than 10 songs...."come on, baby, finish what you started....i'm incomplete!!!!...that ain't no way to treat the broken hearted....i need some sympathy!!!"...i wonder if i already posted that one before...wouldn't be surprised if i had..that's one of those driving up the coast kind of songs. :)

Your insightful input is greatly appreciated.

Please continue these periodic culture-updates.

We eagerly await.

(As a side note, to be at least moderately helpful: there is a great deal
of drum+bass and house in the bay area. And I've seen a -lot- of Techno
recently, due to the efforts of some really dedicated bleepers. Stop
typing/talking and start reading/listening. :) You're not impressing
anyone. Check out deciblast.org/events, the SFraves calendar (you can find
it from hyperreal.org), and uh... well, the other things I'm too lazy to
look up right now.)

Never heard of Tracy??  She's a good DJ..and a nice
girl, which is why it doesn't surprise me that you
haven't heard of her.  She actually plays decent
music..i guess you can't relate..

Put a brain in the lifeless heads of these party kids
and maybe they'll try something new.  It would require
quite an extensive operation, but I think we can
rebuild them.  We have the TECHNOlogy!

Neurotron

The heads of Neurotron, Axel Schuh and Andr=E9 Kroenert were born in 1978 in=
=20
Guestrow, a small very old city in the north-east of Germany. Since school t=
hey=20
hung around together and developed their love for electronic music by hearin=
g=20
EBM, Industrial, Experimental and Acid-House. After many great and wonderful=
=20
partys and moments with this music they decided to produce such music by=20
themselves. In 1995 Andre started to work as DJ Phrase. Later he brought the=
=20
self-made sound to the dance floors outside the live acts of Neurotron as Le=
 Dub=20
Dwell. In 1995/96 they bought a Roland MC-202 and a 606. Little later a 909=20=
and a=20
whole depot of synthesizers, effect tools and samplers and started to perfor=
m=20
live acts as Yakusa in Guestrow, Rostock and Kiel. At first the sound was=20
realy hard grooving Detroit-Techno, influenced by artists like Plasticman, U=
R,=20
Cybotron, Stacey Pullen & Aphex Twin. Later they begun to use laptops and=20
combined this with the hardware in their studio. By increasing influences by=
 labels=20
like Force Tracks, Raum Musik , Basic Channel or Poker Flat and Kompakt thei=
r=20
sound became more dubby, deep and minimal. In this time they got to know Eri=
k=20
Klingbeil from Berlin. He is a very talented designer, who creates flyers,=20
videos and covers with his artworks <A HREF=3D"http://www.cubelab.de/">(www.=
cubelab.de)</A> for Neurotron since that=20
time. With the change of their sound, their attitude of life and of music th=
ey=20
changed their name as well. Neurotron was born. The harmonious connection be=
tween=20
human nerves and electronic physics. The result : a positive change of=20
perception by electronic. Live this is reflected by both and transferred to=20=
the=20
audience. DJ Phrase changed his name. In 2001/2002 they released their first=
 music=20
on Thinner Records. After this they start to produce for more and more=20
projects. Since 2002 Le Dub Dwell is supporting the whole and cares for the=20
spreading of this attitude outside live acts with his deep and groovy sets.=20=
In 2002=20
they got to know Timothy Dorsey of <A HREF=3D"http://www.deepanddark.com/">D=
eep & Dark Recordings(us)</A> and Alexandra=20
Konka of <A HREF=3D"http://www.deepanddark.de/">Deep & Dark Recordings(ger)<=
/A>. This was the start of a very great=20
friendship and musical cooperation and they made many remixes and production=
s for D&D.=20
After the summer 2003 they released their full length Album Neurotron: Textu=

of you on Deep&Dark Recordings. In the middle of 2003 they start their own=20
label <A HREF=3D"http://www.night-drive-music.com/">Night-Drive-Music</A>. T=

Subject: Re: [sfraves] boo!

... and here I thought that Bay Area Trance was in something of a downswing. I agree with Sean; you can find a lot of different kinds of music if you hit the right club on the right night. But as far as Friday and Saturday parties go, I hear a lot of house, NRG, hardcore, happy hardcore, and not as much trance as in the past. 
But anyway ... one of the funnest things, for me, about partying is wandering around and enjoying what's in the different rooms. I love drum & bass ... love trance too ... love a lot of house music (but not all types) ... lots of great stuff to listen to. 
I don't say "boo!" to any of the styles cuz there's plenty of room for all of them. 
how about "MORE OF" some styles, rather than "LESS OF" others? How about more Goa ... more Electro ... whatever ... Expand the pie so there is more for us to listen to.  :)

Goa is way different than Techno, House, Drum-n-Bass, or Trance.. In NYC
the crowds were way different at Goa events. Typically, in the NYC area,
psytrance parties were a large % of israelies (the girls are so hot, but
typically stick to their own kind) or hippy types. Electro is cool.. I've
got a lot of live electro sets perhaps I could burn you some.

My husband is all ga ga over her. 
With all due respect: Is it just me, or does "Ariana Huffington" sound like a a porn star name? Before anyone else states the obvious, yes, having a name that sounds like a porn star IS better than a name that sounds like fungus or algae. IE sarah "SCUM", sarah "SHROOM" I wish my name sounded like I was a porn star.

Not really... Unless you're just hanging out with the kiddy crowd here.
Lately the bay area is dominated by a huge upswing in house and sadly,
happycore//hardcore. Something you will find out really quickly is that the
*scene* here is VERY fragmented. Stay in the house scene and you have to
figure out what part of the house scene you want to be in. Schwank side,
artsy side, glossy club side, meatmarket, and so on all exist. I just find
it funny to hear the trance comment. If we were in the years 98 - 2001 I'd
say yes for damn sure there is too much!

Well, last time I was in the scene here was around that time ;-)
And since I got back, well, i've been hearing much about Trance.
I miss my chicago house, detroit techno, and british drum-n-bass. NYC is
ill. Nuff said.

Before anyone else states the obvious, yes, having a name that sounds like a porn star IS better than a name that sounds like fungus or algae. IE sarah "SCUM", sarah "SHROOM" I wish my name sounded like I was a porn star.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] boo!

You're just not in the right end of things. It's all there. Chicago house -
Andrew Phelan - recent transplant from that city. Techno?? Good god - there
is more head pounding, skull fucking (C ambient mafia), techno in this area
than you could believe. Just that the masses aren't into it, but it's very
much there. I just did visuals for an all techno record release party this
weekend. DEFSF(think that's the crew name) had another party of the same
nature 3 weeks ago. It's *very* there and mostly enjoyed by the old
schoolers that started things here. I can't speak on behalf of the dnb
because I don't know brittish dnb from domestic. I do know the difference
between the beer though! =)

Ask for suggestions on where to go to get your fix on SFR. You've got people
that will point you in the right direction here.

There is tons of psy-trance in the bay area. (Calling it "Goa" is so 1998.) 
Complete with plenty of Israelies and hippies.  Let me know if you want 
more info...

PEACE MELON DAY PARTY
Saturday, August 16th: NOON - 7 p.m.
Cafe Cocomo
650 INDIANA STREET
$7

Please join Andrew, Christian, Cece, Lisa, Geneva & Michael, Zander, Tim & 
Megan, Veronica (Vee) & Bob, Maciek, Tim & Eric as we prepare for the playa.

What is Peace Melon?
Well, glad you asked. Peace Melon takes some of its spirit from those crazy 
Octane Parties. We decided that best of all we like to hang out with 
friends, and make new ones along the way. So, on the Playa we will be 
creating a little oasis full of shade for new and old friends to get 
together, and enjoy a little libation of watermelon, other fruits and alcohol.
Utilizing the power of the triangle, we will be creating a very large shade 
structure that if seen from the sky will resemble a butterfly; each 
individual part of the butterfly will look like a slice of luscious slice 
of watermelon. We will have decks and a long line-up of folks lending a 
hand to make for a fantastic musical and gastronomical feast.
Join us on the playa, when the shade runs long we will bust out our Melons 
to be passed around and enjoyed as one.

Featured Flavors of Music @ THE MELON DAY PARTY:
+ Ms. E (FutureBreaks, SisterSF)
+ Scott Carrelli (Satellite, Qool)
+ Samira (SisterSF)
+ KENichi (OnIce, Octane)
+ FauxQ (Noel C., Seed, Platform, DownNYurty)

as we prepare for the playa.<br><br>
<b>What is Peace Melon? <br>
</b>Well, glad you asked. Peace Melon takes some of its spirit from those
crazy Octane Parties. We decided that best of all we like to hang out
with friends, and make new ones along the way. So, on the Playa we will
be creating a little oasis full of shade for new and old friends to get
together, and enjoy a little libation of watermelon, other fruits and
alcohol.<br>
Utilizing the power of the triangle, we will be creating a very large
shade structure that if seen from the sky will resemble a butterfly; each
individual part of the butterfly will look like a slice of luscious slice
of watermelon. We will have decks and a long line-up of folks lending a
hand to make for a fantastic musical and gastronomical feast.<br>
Join us on the playa, when the shade runs long we will bust out our
Melons to be passed around and enjoyed as one.<br><br>

Subject: [sfraves] Review: Full moon rave (FMR) on the coast

I missed the Estuary party at SS on Monday night because I had the top-secret
info line for another FMR. I just had to go since I have never been dancing in
the moonlight around here (I am usually at indoor venues).

This was a fun party but it required much patience to attend. It was a good
thing that I had some booze beforehand. I drove all the way over to Pacifica and
parked along Beach Way (or something like that), and as soon as I got out of the
car, some idiot set off a bottle rocket. I thought that would definitely bring
out the cops but nothing happened. Except when I walked up the trail to the
cliffs, there was no music or glowstick (our handy hint for directions). Good
thing I had a six-pack to slug down or I would have been frustrated. 

You were supposed to find the glowstick and follow the path up the hill. I ran
into some other ravers though, like Phillip Diaz, and we were all dismayed.
Someone called the info line again and it said to wait 15 minutes.  Finally, we
all got directions to Daly City and I was more confused then ever while driving
(cant blame the booze, either). I am not familiar with this area of the coast
because I live in East Bay.

I spotted some ravers crossing the highway near a darkened horse stable and I
knew that was my ticket. I parked nearby and started walking the sandy trail,
smelling the wafts of horse manure. Then I heard the music, saw the waving
glowsticks, and felt immediate gratification. 

I downed another beer and starting dancing in the sand. Have you ever tried this
one? I cannot recommend it for big and tall guys. It was excessively hard to
stay stable. I kept digging my own dance pit!

I was trying not to kick sand in the face of nearby e-tards (I mean, chilled
out persons), but it was impossible, the sand was flying. They had a small
dance mat in front of the DJ, near the black lights, but it kept shifting (not
tied down). 

I moved over near some vegetation (brushy terrain) to dance because it seemed
flatter and stable there, but once again, I kept sinking. 

Finally, I just gave up and walked the trail along the coast to watch the
crashing waves in the moonlight. I fell down once because the trail was narrow
and I am wide but I recovered and dusted the sand off my ass.

Hell, I was not even that drunk at the time. It felt so silly to fall down, so I
just laughed at myself. What else can you do? 

It was a lot of fun to get away on a weeknight (Monday). I love FMRs and I
cannot wait until the next one. I hope that I can see more of the people that I
know, though, because it is more fun that way.

Greg VP

CNN is trying to prove President Bush is wrong on his >=20
anti-gay-marriage stand ... and we are losing. If this concerns you,
go to the site below ... and VOTE. Then forward it on to all your
friends, because this poll will be used by CNN to show how "out of date"
the President is in his beliefs.
The CNN Poll asks: Should marriage be legally defined as only a union
between a man and a woman?  As of 8/8/03 - the YES vote [marriage =3D man
+ woman] is 100,000 ahead of the NO vote - help turn that around.
Thanks!

that was more a review of your night than the party, greg...

overall, it was good, hard psy, and excellent mixing. lots of 
blacklights along with amazing clear skies and a bright moon were 
enough to be able to recognize faces in the dark. lots of excellent 
glowy tapestries... it's hard to make a beach party look good, but they 
did a great job.

there were a few peeps spinning fire and putting on a show. lots of 
great eye-candy - it's a shame i had to work early the next day. :-) it 
was amazingly warm and clear, and i really wanted to stay later, but my 
friend and i cut out around 4:30 am.


AND NOW, a few things i've learned about FMR's over the years:

they rarely start on time, usually after midnight
they have no bathroom facilities
they are usually cold
they are usually a pain in the ass to find
they are on a work/school night
your friends will all say they want to go, but flake at the last minute

BUT

if you stick it out and are persistent, you will be rewarded with some 
of the best, free, outdoor parties around. the FMR on monday paled in 
comparison to some of the madness that the Wicked crew pulled off 
way-back-when... but if all of you guys showed up on monday night, it 
would have been pretty damn close. :-)

i hope to see more of you at the next one.

To me they didn't have their shit together and I value my time and sleep
more than waiting for some crew to update a voicemail for a party that may
or may not occur. Reality is a bitch on the weekdays when there is work to
be done. I would have gone if I thought the damn thing would have actually
gone off, but no vm update in hours makes me say all bets are off.

Thanks, Philip, your observations are right on the money! Excellent, dude.
I forgot to mention the fire dancers and the overall good vibe, plus the
excellent weather. (clear) And those tapestries were the bomb! And I loved
the psytrance!

Yeah, y'all get out to the next one, we'll make it even better, keep the
vibes, just add to them.

I got a little carried away in my prev. message about the sandy terrain, ya
just have to wear old shoes and throw them away the next day, or just dance
barefoot.

It is true, you will experience the reward (i.e. delight) that this area has
to offer. How can you compare crashing waves, moonlight, black lights to
going to bed just so you can go to work the next morning? Ya gotta live a
little (as I stiffle a YAWN from the boring drudgery of the workday).

that was more a review of your night than the party, greg...

overall, it was good, hard psy, and excellent mixing. lots of
blacklights along with amazing clear skies and a bright moon were
enough to be able to recognize faces in the dark. lots of excellent
glowy tapestries... it's hard to make a beach party look good, but they
did a great job.

there were a few peeps spinning fire and putting on a show. lots of
great eye-candy - it's a shame i had to work early the next day. :-) it
was amazingly warm and clear, and i really wanted to stay later, but my
friend and i cut out around 4:30 am.


AND NOW, a few things i've learned about FMR's over the years:

they rarely start on time, usually after midnight
they have no bathroom facilities
they are usually cold
they are usually a pain in the ass to find
they are on a work/school night
your friends will all say they want to go, but flake at the last minute

BUT

if you stick it out and are persistent, you will be rewarded with some
of the best, free, outdoor parties around. the FMR on monday paled in
comparison to some of the madness that the Wicked crew pulled off
way-back-when... but if all of you guys showed up on monday night, it
would have been pretty damn close. :-)

i hope to see more of you at the next one.

Well, as I said, the beer helped me have a good time, I just needed more of
it (because someone drank a few of mine for me). But I paid the next day.
(didn't get much work done; couldn't get out of bed)

On the other hand, it was great fun, good vibes, nice weather. I was feeling
negative initially (as expressed by my partial review), and I was thinking
the same thing, (i.e. where the fuck is the party), but I got over it. (only
because I was determined to experience my first FMR)

All said and done, I have no regrets about sticking it out. Got home at
around 5 am.

To me they didn't have their shit together and I value my time and sleep
more than waiting for some crew to update a voicemail for a party that may
or may not occur. Reality is a bitch on the weekdays when there is work to
be done. I would have gone if I thought the damn thing would have actually
gone off, but no vm update in hours makes me say all bets are off.

I didn't make it out to this one. But I went to one at the DC spot a while
back.  It ranked very high amongst my party experiences.

Somehow, those guys really manage to draw you into another universe. That
spot is incredibly trippy. When the fog rolls in at ~6am... man.

Actually, the party I went to down there is what got me really
interested in Psytrance - a genre I didn't really know much about before
then. Max magic.

Well, what Philip had to say about FMRs is quite true.  Attending a Wicked 
FMR often required much patience...but the mad runs all over the Bay Area 
on those nights was well worth the effort:)  The parties rarely got going 
before 2 AM -- sometimes as late as four.  If there was a problem at one 
location we would all move to another and help the crew set up those 
awesome, but very heavy, speakers once again.  Info line messages, to my 
mind, were often unclear.  I used to take a hand-held tape recorder and 
record off the cell phone (when you could find a place where it worked), 
and then replay the damn thing over and over again while we all poured over 
maps with flashlights on the side of the road while we puzzled out 
directions.  Frequently got lost.

One could go on...the best of times, and, as they say, getting there was 
part of the fun.

I remember once at the Bonnie Dune location we got lost after we parked our 
cars.  Everyone was very quietly walking down the railroad tracks, so we 
really didn't know where the peeps were or where they were going.  We went 
in the opposite direction and, after about a mile, realized that we were 
alone.  So we went up off the tracks and onto some farmer's 
field.   Slogged through manure for what seemed like an eternity when....we 
all ended up walking right into his backyard.   We were all so fearful we 
would give the party away, so we crawled around the buildings.  Then got 
up, and headed again for the railroad tracks.  This time we made it to the 
little trail about half a mile down the tracks (unmarked) that led to the 
cliff and then the beach.  As we came up to the edge --  the moon shining 
on the water;  hundreds of people around bonfires and such;  no music, they 
were still setting up and we helped.  Then, about two hours later, the 
music.  Time from home to dancin' in the sand -- over five hours.

Love,

Apollo

that was more a review of your night than the party, greg...

overall, it was good, hard psy, and excellent mixing. lots of
blacklights along with amazing clear skies and a bright moon were
enough to be able to recognize faces in the dark. lots of excellent
glowy tapestries... it's hard to make a beach party look good, but they
did a great job.

there were a few peeps spinning fire and putting on a show. lots of
great eye-candy - it's a shame i had to work early the next day. :-) it
was amazingly warm and clear, and i really wanted to stay later, but my
friend and i cut out around 4:30 am.


AND NOW, a few things i've learned about FMR's over the years:

they rarely start on time, usually after midnight
they have no bathroom facilities
they are usually cold
they are usually a pain in the ass to find
they are on a work/school night
your friends will all say they want to go, but flake at the last minute

BUT

if you stick it out and are persistent, you will be rewarded with some
of the best, free, outdoor parties around. the FMR on monday paled in
comparison to some of the madness that the Wicked crew pulled off
way-back-when... but if all of you guys showed up on monday night, it
would have been pretty damn close. :-)

i hope to see more of you at the next one.

Hear hear!  More electro and goa.... with a sideswing of breaks... that
would be nummy.  And yeah, seriously.... I haven't been to a party, even at
1015 recently where I've been inundated with too much trance and no other
styles... I'm kinda starting to miss it.  Ok, maybe not, I have 92.7 if I
wanna hear it.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Review: Full moon rave (FMR) on the coast

No cop has ever busted any of my parties... If you're thinking of ASR at the
aquatic park - that wasn't my party. I just did sound for them. =)

I don't have patience on a weeknight when time is limited due to a job that
keeps me busy (and at the office still right now). hence why I say time is
precious. If you can't get me the info in time to make it worth heading out
for then I'm not going to bother. I'd rather sleep and catch another FMR in
a month. They happen all the time so it's not a biggy. This particular event
lagged on info and had a party on a Monday night when the majority of us
have jobs the next day that we have to be awake for. It's being realistic
and having your priorities strait. Job vs yet another FMR. I'll keep my job
thnx!

ryan,
ive been to outdoor parties that you have put alot of work into; and had
just as much confusion understanding the infoline and then to finally find
that cops have busted it. have patience and love for the people who work
hard to bring you full moon parties.

that was more a review of your night than the party, greg...

overall, it was good, hard psy, and excellent mixing. lots of
blacklights along with amazing clear skies and a bright moon were
enough to be able to recognize faces in the dark. lots of excellent
glowy tapestries... it's hard to make a beach party look good, but they
did a great job.

there were a few peeps spinning fire and putting on a show. lots of
great eye-candy - it's a shame i had to work early the next day. :-) it
was amazingly warm and clear, and i really wanted to stay later, but my
friend and i cut out around 4:30 am.


AND NOW, a few things i've learned about FMR's over the years:

they rarely start on time, usually after midnight
they have no bathroom facilities
they are usually cold
they are usually a pain in the ass to find
they are on a work/school night
your friends will all say they want to go, but flake at the last minute

BUT

if you stick it out and are persistent, you will be rewarded with some
of the best, free, outdoor parties around. the FMR on monday paled in
comparison to some of the madness that the Wicked crew pulled off
way-back-when... but if all of you guys showed up on monday night, it
would have been pretty damn close. :-)

i hope to see more of you at the next one.

can anyone tell me what's up with FMR's in the bay area being on 
beaches?  WTF?  There's so many beautiful spots around the bay, some much 
closer and more central than the ocean..

Can you honestly bitch about a party being at the beach, I mean we have some 
of the most scenic coastline in the world?!  Anyways, our crew is throwing 
an outdoor beginning of next month...not at the beach!  It's not an FMR, but 
keep your eyes posted and you should hear about it.  Ilopango... going down 
Sept 12th.   And if you're tired of beach parties... why don't you throw an 
outdoor party... I'm sure the people would appreciate it!  ;oP

Hah hah hah!

FMR, at least by Wicked, had quite a history of a mangled phone
tree, which was the only way to know, even worse mangled directions,
and starting at 3am or so (DOH! Someone forgot turntables!)

Gods, it was a wonder anyone showed up at all. And yet 1500++ people
would turn out. We complained and complained, and yet went again and
again like it was going to be the very last party in the world.

This was probably the reason why when many of us started throwing
parties, we were determined to give better customer service. Some of
our We Can Do Better events even started 2 hours early!

But there's a certain quality only the true quest would give, when
after cursing and listening to voice mail over and over and driving
the fuck all over california lost with a carload of ravers and
walking around in the wrong directions... my God we'd finally find
the event and it's be so magic and crazy and everyone else was so
crazy... we'll be telling our grandkids about it.

Yeah we bitched on the lists and bitched to our friends and bitched
to our diaries and wondered  how it could be.

And we fucking went. Every single time. Came back with permagrin.

How about that? :)

If last night was a Wicked party I would have gone regardless. I went to the
last successful party in 2001at Panther beach. That was a blast. Of course I
wasn't working at the time either which helped.

Well, whatever the case next month, can we get a stable dance floor?
Just a larger mat would do, for the sandy, rocky beach.
I'm not asking for a stage, it is a renegade!

Hell, I'll bring my own mat, hehehe

I could start a new business trend: renegade dancing mats for sale; they
glow in the blacklight.

Oh, what the fuck, it's still fun being outside under the full moonlight.

Scooter had a song about that recently:
"I'm dancing, in the moonlight"

Cool track,

Greg VP

Subject: [sfraves] SRR:Amber CD Played @ Gym

Hey,
So I'm at 24 Hour Fitness Wednesday evening for my daily after work 
work-out. As much as I hate lower body days, I have to torture my legs cause 
I don't want to end up looking like one of those guys with massive arms and 
chicken legs. On my last set of squats, with 570 pounds on the bar, what do 
I hear come through the sound system???

AMBER:GOLD!!!

I almost lost balance and dropped the bar.

And these guys played the entire CD, from start to finish! I asked one of 
the fitness counselors about it and he pointed me to the front desk worker 
who said he was a big fan of electronica and today was his day to select the 
music.

Needless to say, I had an awesome lower body workout...the music really does 
make an impact.

Just thought I'd share...

Later,
Riz

the next FMR gets busted, you can blame yourself.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Review: Full moon rave (FMR) on the coast

It was no harm intended. Just an Email mistake on my part (Not thinking
before sending). Happens to the best of list subscribers.

Glad that you said something, though. Sometimes we need to be reminded about
such things.

No direct location (or addy), or phone number in my email, but I guess (upon
rereading) it could be figured out. I just sent an apology to Jason in a
sep. email. It won't happen again. In fact, I'm going back to lurking and
dancing and keeping my mouth shut. Bye everyone,

Greg

not good to disclose the location of said FMRs.  good job.  if
the next FMR gets busted, you can blame yourself.

Hey!  Which 24 hr club was this???   'Cause I work at 24 hr fitness (on Mckee and Capitol) and our music played is not a CD, it's all run off of satellite.  Electronic is #17 on the DMX station.  
 
just wondering...  I've even heard a lot of awesome tracks on there.  
 
well, gotta go to work

Hey,
So I'm at 24 Hour Fitness Wednesday evening for my daily after work 
work-out. As much as I hate lower body days, I have to torture my legs cause 
I don't want to end up looking like one of those guys with massive arms and 
chicken legs. On my last set of squats, with 570 pounds on the bar, what do 
I hear come through the sound system???

AMBER:GOLD!!!

I almost lost balance and dropped the bar.

And these guys played the entire CD, from start to finish! I asked one of 
the fitness counselors about it and he pointed me to the front desk worker 
who said he was a big fan of electronica and today was his day to select the 
music.

Needless to say, I had an awesome lower body workout...the music really does 
make an impact.

Just thought I'd share...

Later,
Riz

God Bless U!  Love, Your sister in Christ, Tami

Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, Rejoice. Let your gentleness be known to everyone. The Lord is near. Do not worry about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.    Philippians 4:4-7

Raves become all the rage

This is a rave; a phenomenon imported from Europe that in Mexico draws 
legions of young
psycheros. They see themselves as modern hippies. They dance all night to 
"psycho-trance"
music. And they consume lots of drugs such as ecstasy, LSD and 
amphetamines, police say.

Mckee and Capitol) and our music played is not a CD, it's all run off of 
satellite.  Electronic is #17 on the DMX station.

just wondering...  I've even heard a lot of awesome tracks on there.

Hey,
So I'm at 24 Hour Fitness Wednesday evening for my daily after work
work-out. As much as I hate lower body days, I have to torture my legs cause
I don't want to end up looking like one of those guys with massive arms and
chicken legs. On my last set of squats, with 570 pounds on the bar, what do
I hear come through the sound system???

AMBER:GOLD!!!

I almost lost balance and dropped the bar.

And these guys played the entire CD, from start to finish! I asked one of
the fitness counselors about it and he pointed me to the front desk worker
who said he was a big fan of electronica and today was his day to select the
music.

Needless to say, I had an awesome lower body workout...the music really does
make an impact.

Just thought I'd share...

Later,
Riz

Cruz, using the English words to form the acronym, PLUR, that psycheros live

Atleast he's honost. All the same it makes me want to hit up Mexico and
check one of their massives out. The thought of partying in a tropical
jungle like that sounds damn cool. We should get a group together and head
down there for a weekend if we know of a good party coming up. I'd be down
for a cracked out 4 day weekend. =)

It sure would be cool if Mexico's west coast became the "New" Thailand.
Cheaper airfare. You could drive there if something good was evolving.

I bet the Police corruption down there would NOT fuck things up.

I wonder if the Wicked Crew could be persuaded to bring SF Funk House to the
Jungles.

Or (now the coffee kicks in)  what if a form of Jungle Music were to be
reborn. We could call it Jungle Jungle?

He He ;)

The positive thing that could come out of it is that, the few Aztecs that
Hernan the 1st missed-fled into that region. And they have been raped and
robbed for 500 years.   Maybe a little dance community commodity sharing.

Ha....well they are fresh into this and I, for one, would like to see 
what's up (no pun intended) down there.  I had an invitation to spin in 
Mexico City last year and, unfortunately, couldn't make it.  But the guy I 
was in contact with said the house scene was exploding.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Raves become all the rage

I've been under the impression for a few years now from a Mixmag article
that Southern Mexico and the jungles were a huge rave/vacation spot for
euro's and south americans.

Ha....well they are fresh into this and I, for one, would like to see 
what's up (no pun intended) down there.  I had an invitation to spin in 
Mexico City last year and, unfortunately, couldn't make it.  But the guy
I

"Security is mostly a superstition.  It does not exist in nature, nor do

the children of humans as a whole experience it.  Avoiding danger is no 
safer in the long run than outright exposure.  Life is either a daring 
adventure or nothing."
-Helen Keller

"Compassion is not a relationship between the healer and the wounded.
It's 
a relationship between equals.  Only when we know our own darkness well
can 
we be present with the darkness of others.  Compassion becomes real when

if you've never been to the Mayan Riviera (the eastern coast of the 
Yucatan - the area south of Cancun), you really should try to go. Araya 
and I went there on our honeymoon last year, and man, was it awesome.

Beach parties? hell yeah!  you've never seen ocean water so clear... 
i'm down to go next spring. anyone wanna join? i don't know about 
getting a system down there though - i had friends who had a bitch of a 
time getting a van full of gear across the border in Tijuana for a 
party they did in Baja.

Or the nex GOA, Ibiza etc. That'd be nice, and

travel agents perk up your ears! Wasn't there someone

Did someone leave the crop lines in the flyer graphic? The pink lines look
like hidden elements in InDesign that got exported when they shouldn't have.
Atleast whoever did this actually set up a small bleed on the image.

 http://cortana.typepad.com/rta/2003/08/gray_davis_thug.html

What does this disgusting insident have to do with liberals? 
Your right, these people were thugs and should be prosecuted for what
they did. But.... 
There is no proof that some "official" generic "liberal" committee
organized this thuggery, or that these certain individuals got their
orders to beat up people from a such committee (conspiracy theory
hypothesis).
No proof that the unions that these thugs belonged to endorsed this
behavior, 
and no proof Gray Davis personally knew of and supported this behavior as
well.

 Most likely this was an incident perpertrated by some over zellous
individuals claiming a union affiliation, not some organized effort by
the union(s) they belonged to, to beat up people. Most likely, a union or
unions did organize the demonstration, which they had a right to do so,
but did not endorse this behavior. This should be seen a problem with
certain individuals and that the unions these people belonged to need to
facillate some disiplinary action, and to attempt to stereotype all
unions with this kind of behavior is dishonest. Also, to claim that all
liberals thug on people we disagree with and that there is some liberal
conspiricy to deniy the free spech of the pro recall movement is going a
little to far with the facts. 
Do you have any documentation that "liberals" in their "official
platform" believe in thugging people and censoring free speech? 
I have plenty of doccumention of radical conservatives doing much worse
things. 
And, have you ever done any reading on the history of union busting? 

What is your beef about unions? You don't believe workers have a right to
organize to protect themselves from being abused by capitalism? Don't try
to skirt the issue with stories of Mafia ties and corruption in unions,
which does exist, but often exaggerated to attack unions. What is your
agenda here? To attack certain thugs and their behavior, or to attack
unions by stereotyping?

First, I wasn't there to see the whole story. News footages can only show
so much. We don't know all what happened before the cameras rolled. You
know, there is a excellent chance that it started off as a usual verbal
exchange when you have demonstrations and counter demonstrations
converging. Possibly, the verbal borages got nastier (see, we don't know
who incited who first?), tempers flared, and violence happened. Like I
said, I don't endorse this kind of  behavior, especially when a seven
year old kid get's hurt, but to look at this another way, we don't know
if the pro recall people were all that innocent in this incident either. 
Is this a case of the pool of vomit telling a pile of shit "you stink"!?
There is two sides to this story and we need to get to the bottom of this
and who ever got violent should be prosecuted, both the union people and
the pro recall people. Liberals have nothing to do with this.

The $4m of tax payers money going to fight the recall is legal and fair.
You didn't mention Issa's millions going to the recall, and Davis should
have no means to defend himself? He is a government official facing a
recall and as a government official, he has the right to have $4m to
defend himself. No different than the state paying for the defence of a
defendant in a trial, even if the person has guilt written all over him.
That's called having a fair trial, which is part of having a democracy.
Having $4m to compete is called having a fair election which is a part of
having a democracy as well.
Hey, I thought you were for democracy too?

Oh, you failed to mention the $66m price tag,so far, of tax payer's money
to hold this election, which the counties will have to bear most of it
and will have to cut more services to pay for.
So, let me get this right. The state should pay $66m, so far, to fund
your recall effort,
but Davis should get $0 of tax payer's money to defend himself?
Whose getting more screwed here?

I don't like Davis too much either, but I see this recall effort as
another sad example of Republicans never seeing a fair election (they
lost) that they liked, and usurping democracy again to get their way,
like they did in Florida in 2000.

Peace, Bodhi ^ _ ^

And now the running theory is that it was a Manhattan power plant that
failed. Generator fire. Think this makes generator fire #4 that's shut
down a power grid in the eastern us  in the last 3 days.

OMGWTFCONSPIRACEEEEE!1111111111111111oneoneone

Then again, one of the power failures was due to a squirrel on some power
lines. Maybe the squirrels are revolting, prepared to throw off the chains
of their simian professors. The little buggers have been getting steadily
more clever and vicious over the fast few years. First they cut off our
electricity, then they come in at night...
...from the treees....

I see this and I think back to when the nation scoffed at CA for getting
fucked power wise. Seriously the nation didn't give a fuck about CA getting
raped for power and having rolling blackouts. Seeing this makes me think
spiteful thoughts.

Taste our shit you fucks. Doesn't smell pretty now does it?

damn I'm an excessive bitch today (like overly bitchier than normal).
Caffeine. NOW.

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) Quote of the Day (Thu)

did i ever tell you that back in college i took a television production class and we partnered up to do live 30 
minute television shows?  yep.  two cameras, a cg, a switcher, microphones, lighting, the whole shebang.  
ready one, take one.  ready two, take two.  

my partner, roger black, did a science fiction musical.  i did, (which probably won't surprise you) a star trek 
episode.  

and now, i bring you a great quote from a book that someone i know from Maine just pulled out.  

see you tomorrow!

i think that, as a native NYer, you have NO idea what you're all talking
about.  8^)

imagine growing up and having a stockpile of food and water and wood for
the stove for when the power went out...  in upstate NY the power would
regularly go out for DAYS at a time, mostly due to weather.

so, we were all making fun of the number of complaints that you native
californicators gave when you'd brown out.  at least the power came back
on within minutes, not days.  we had a surprise snow storm (named
snowleaf) in early october when i was 14.  no power for seven days.

8^P

granted we've quakes out here...  that kinda balances it out.  hehe

i am moving to london in a few months, the new year to be precise...and i was curious to know if anyone had any leads on the scene there, i.e. lists, websites, anything....fav clubs, events, etc.  i lived there about a year ago...but i wasn't part of the scene at all..i lived with a drum and bass dj at school, and his parties were enough entertainment for me at the time...
 
so if anyone knows any other lists, peeps, etc. would be greatly appreciated,
 
cheers,

Unions are a necessary evil.  However, as unions grow they become a
cancer that kills the host organism.  I don't need a history lesson in
unions.  I have a degree in management and have had more than my fair
share of classes on union negotiations.    

I don't like the recall either.  I think Californians should suffer the
consequences of their actions.  they voted davis in and they should get
the full 4 years of his ruinous leadership.  Let him destroy California.

What does this disgusting insident have to do with liberals? 
Your right, these people were thugs and should be prosecuted for what
they did. But.... 
There is no proof that some "official" generic "liberal" committee
organized this thuggery, or that these certain individuals got their
orders to beat up people from a such committee (conspiracy theory
hypothesis).
No proof that the unions that these thugs belonged to endorsed this
behavior, 
and no proof Gray Davis personally knew of and supported this behavior
as
well.

 Most likely this was an incident perpertrated by some over zellous
individuals claiming a union affiliation, not some organized effort by
the union(s) they belonged to, to beat up people. Most likely, a union
or
unions did organize the demonstration, which they had a right to do so,
but did not endorse this behavior. This should be seen a problem with
certain individuals and that the unions these people belonged to need to
facillate some disiplinary action, and to attempt to stereotype all
unions with this kind of behavior is dishonest. Also, to claim that all
liberals thug on people we disagree with and that there is some liberal
conspiricy to deniy the free spech of the pro recall movement is going a
little to far with the facts. 
Do you have any documentation that "liberals" in their "official
platform" believe in thugging people and censoring free speech? 
I have plenty of doccumention of radical conservatives doing much worse
things. 
And, have you ever done any reading on the history of union busting? 

What is your beef about unions? You don't believe workers have a right
to
organize to protect themselves from being abused by capitalism? Don't
try
to skirt the issue with stories of Mafia ties and corruption in unions,
which does exist, but often exaggerated to attack unions. What is your
agenda here? To attack certain thugs and their behavior, or to attack
unions by stereotyping?

First, I wasn't there to see the whole story. News footages can only
show
so much. We don't know all what happened before the cameras rolled. You
know, there is a excellent chance that it started off as a usual verbal
exchange when you have demonstrations and counter demonstrations
converging. Possibly, the verbal borages got nastier (see, we don't know
who incited who first?), tempers flared, and violence happened. Like I
said, I don't endorse this kind of  behavior, especially when a seven
year old kid get's hurt, but to look at this another way, we don't know
if the pro recall people were all that innocent in this incident either.

Is this a case of the pool of vomit telling a pile of shit "you stink"!?
There is two sides to this story and we need to get to the bottom of
this
and who ever got violent should be prosecuted, both the union people and
the pro recall people. Liberals have nothing to do with this.

The $4m of tax payers money going to fight the recall is legal and fair.
You didn't mention Issa's millions going to the recall, and Davis should
have no means to defend himself? He is a government official facing a
recall and as a government official, he has the right to have $4m to
defend himself. No different than the state paying for the defence of a
defendant in a trial, even if the person has guilt written all over him.
That's called having a fair trial, which is part of having a democracy.
Having $4m to compete is called having a fair election which is a part
of
having a democracy as well.
Hey, I thought you were for democracy too?

Oh, you failed to mention the $66m price tag,so far, of tax payer's
money
to hold this election, which the counties will have to bear most of it
and will have to cut more services to pay for.
So, let me get this right. The state should pay $66m, so far, to fund
your recall effort,
but Davis should get $0 of tax payer's money to defend himself?
Whose getting more screwed here?

I don't like Davis too much either, but I see this recall effort as
another sad example of Republicans never seeing a fair election (they
lost) that they liked, and usurping democracy again to get their way,
like they did in Florida in 2000.

Peace, Bodhi ^ _ ^

Earthquakes are fun and not a regular occurance. I always wonder why
non-cali people fear them so much. Seems like every year people get killed
by nasty storms and heatwaves. Sure as hell don't hear about people dying
every year from *earthquake season* because there is no such thing. I always
laugh when I'm in Atlanta and people say *how can you live with earthquakes?
You're nuts!!* I think too many people have watch LA Story or something. =)

i think that, as a native NYer, you have NO idea what you're all talking
about.  8^)

imagine growing up and having a stockpile of food and water and wood for
the stove for when the power went out...  in upstate NY the power would
regularly go out for DAYS at a time, mostly due to weather.

so, we were all making fun of the number of complaints that you native
californicators gave when you'd brown out.  at least the power came back
on within minutes, not days.  we had a surprise snow storm (named
snowleaf) in early october when i was 14.  no power for seven days.

8^P

granted we've quakes out here...  that kinda balances it out.  hehe

New York pizza in California isn't 1/10th as good as New York pizza is
at virtually *ANY* of the small pizza places in NYC. 

And as a fellow Native New Yorker - we have earthquakes there too, we
just don't sensationalize them. ;)

New York pizza in California isn't 1/10th as good as New York pizza is
at virtually *ANY* of the small pizza places in NYC.

And as a fellow Native New Yorker - we have earthquakes there too, we
just don't sensationalize them. ;)

I knew it!!!  Those furry little buggers are up to something.  Where do the
squirells go at night?  Huh?  They're in little meetings.  That's where they
are.  There is a whole network of squirrels just waiting for their chance to
strike.  Al Qaeda is just the diversion that the furry radicals need to
launch their plan.  I knew I wasn't the only one that realized.
Hahaaaaaaaaa, Mom!  Now who's crazy?????? I toooooold you they were watching

i find it most unfortunate that anyone might benefit from anything i say or do in this life time, actually, and that is because most anyone is connected to someone i would mostly not want to touch nor be touched by, and i don't like your connections, basically, without even meeting you, and in saying so, some sap actually identifies with what i have just printed...now, whether i am actually telling you the truth or not, is indeed, my parogative..(sp? who knows? me! another way of saying, "my way or the highway", so pack yer bags and get the fuck out...there, a little nrr, a little censored cursing, and your on your way)....anyway, i know the list is highly boring right now, and i just flow...congratulations...i am not reading that shit either...if i need help with electricity, which i don't, i call the right party, and since i know i don't want to talk to those people either, i just light candles and enjoy myself...okay, so if i am going to be subjected to slander, then i am allowed
 to slander myself, because no one would do it better than me. that is my line of thinking anyway. gotta go. you can't have it all. :)

Um, Troy, where are these hottie israeli chick parties anyways? I may not
like goa that much but the israeli chicks will well make up for it. Plus
I'm their kind, and my momma will be happy i'm not raving with da shicksa's
  ... so what more could one want? :-)

Plus, they might even laugh at this one:
'A blind guy gets handed a piece of matzoh, and says
"who wrote this shit!!"'

PS: We spell God JHVH -- cuz he ate all the vowels.

NYC, Detroit, Cleveland, Toronto & Ottawa area all without power for a few 
good hours. People point fingers at the middle east or over sea. But the real 
people who did this must be damn good hackers or even yet UFO point's those damn

OK,
The real reason must be some super geek computer nerd or a group of anti

Marc(o) is sooo right on about this.  These guys are doing big things to
fight the legislation and I, for one, will be there standing behind them in
full force. This is (insert latest term being used to represent our
generation)'s turn to stand up and let those currently in power, know that
they aren't representing us as we feel they should.  If we don't make a huge
stand like this, we will be pushed..no shoved...under the preverbal carpet.
It's time to get this thing started!

Subject: RE: [sfraves] NRR: Gray Davis thugs try to surpress free speech

I'm not a big fan of davis by no means at all.  But how come if he's so 
evil, a lot of you voted for him?!  IMO, he's just become a scapegoat for a 
failed economy.  Anything that goes wrong, he gets to take ALL the blame...  
  Seems kinda one sided... and what the media feeds you as well, surprise, 
surprise.  I'm sure if the economy was still booming, most of you wouldn't 
be griping about his shortcomings.  Last time I checked, Davis wasn't the 
sole author of the state budget...

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Music Review on Selekta.com/contact for music reviews

Word Sean! The Selekta rocks!!!

I logged on to check out your review to find that there is quite a bit more 
content in the music reviews than there used to be. Good stuff.

I did five reviews of new techno and techouse 12"s last year (noted as 
"Review by Gavin") that are still on the site and sent them four more the 
next month but Dennis was in the act of moving from CA to Philly so they 
never went up. =(
So I stopped writing the reviews since they never went up. But your peaking 
my interest to start again! =D

I would check out everything that Sean (Cantos) does, as well as his work 
and weekly show on Selekta. All gravey!!!

Respect,
Gavin Varitech

Wow, what a productive concept.  Yes, let's let all the people of CA suffer
even though a slim majority voted him in.  Recalls are an option for a
reason you dummy.

Sometimes the conservatives on this list sound exactly like AM talk show

There are a number of reasons why there isn't recall at the federal level
for a
president.  Lots of them.  You figure it out.

Subject: [sfraves] burningman ride share, saturday, sunday

Hey brothers and sisters, I just lost my cellphone, so
if you have a response, lets keep it on the email tip.

I need a ride for me plus 1 for saturday or sunday or
perhaps at latest monday. I'm supposed to be working
at trance village, most of whom are showing up
saturday. I need space for me and my leo sister. We
will gladly pitch in for gas, rental,wtf etc. The
closer to sunday or saturday the better. Once we get
there we are pretty much independant. We just need to
get there and get back, and we are very flexible. 

Please drop me an email ASAP polymorfss7@yahoo.com . 
much love and respect. 

--poly

We remember Burning man!!!

Wow, is that still going on?
Is Behlendorf still the computer technician?
Swapping servers for Larry and Marion.
Now that's the life.

I heard a nasty rumor that all of the Trance D.J.s were tied to the man
after the pyro and before the burn.
They made a mistake though
They didn't bring enuf rope.  ((( for 3000 DJ's.)))

I think that would have been mean if it were true.
Tell me it aint true.

Burningman.

Wow!

People still go??

Hmmm.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Music Review on Selekta.com/contact for music reviews

I was depressed for a week when The Selekta had to stop streaming live
shows a while back. I'm certainly glad those are back on the air.

Great review, Sean! Maybe we'll get to see some more from you on the other
parts of the site. Perhaps an interview or a feature article.

Anyone remember DJ 321? (I think that was his name... it's been a while).
He had the most hilarious columns on The Selekta. Too bad he isn't
contributing anymore.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Raves become all the rage

   That would sound like a good idea. I always wondered where you could
have beach parties like they have in places like Goa in India, Ibizu
Spain, and Thailand here on this side of the world. I'm not sure why we
don't have such hang out's here, is it politics? Does it have anything to
do with any government on this side friendly to having a beach party
scene like Goa? Do they have them on that side of the world because this
is more of a European scene?
 We have to remember that places like Mexico is swarming with DEA, and
I'm sure if there was a Goa style beach party colony going on in Mexico,
or even in places like Costa Rica or Brazil that would be perfect places,
the DEA would pressure Mexico and any host country to shut it down
because of drug use. Another nasy aspect of the drug war and why we need
to get political! The US has pretty much control of things on this side
of the world, and wouldn't stand for such a scene happening here. What
about Jamaica? Too dangerous and you could get 10-20 years there for
using drugs. That pretty much goes for about all Caribbean countries.
Most of them are former British colonies and still have old Victorian
laws on the books, especially about sexuality.
Maybe I'm all wrong, but you have places like Baja that would be another
perfect place for such a scene, but we don't have one even there. Maybe
because of the reasons I mentioned. I'm sure it was tried before, and the
response was if you do, there will be plenty of room in Mexican jails,
and the US will make sure that would happen. Another way it could be done
is through making friends with drug lords and using bribery, and I don't
want to even be near a party like that!  But there is one more thought
about having a Ibizu style colony, is the enviromental damage. Would the
beaches of the Mayan Riveria and the clear waters of the Caribbean be
destroyed with such an influx of people? Beach parties are very
environmentally destructive and that could be another reason we don't
have beach parties here.
 But if someone can pull it off and such parties could be safe to go to,
I'd be so there!
Peace, Bodhi ^ _ ^

If it was only 3000 I'd probably go back.

Amazing, except the rave dj jackoff part.  Why would someone drive that
far to hear marginal DJs coming from everywhere (the scam is unless you're
standing in front of a speaker, you hear 3-4 sometimes 5 crappy trance DJs
all at once, all the time).  Other than that, it's amazing.  Love the
weather, the view, the art, the freaks, the fire, the spirit of the whole
thing.

apparently that's what happened with the blackout of '86 --- there was

I'll be there. I think a drunken attendance to Freddy vs Jason down the
street in SF first will be needed. Anyone into 80's
trashy-teen-sex-tits+ass-slasher-flics let me know. A big group of drunk and
rowdy ravers would be damn amusing for what's supposed to be one of the
first TRUE R rated films in a long time. It's a throwback to when horror was
super trashy and oh so campy like that. Mmmm... =)

But, as I recall from the blackout in NYC in 1977, there IS lots of 
sex...at least there was from my perspective.  Also, as pointed out in the 
"Oral History of Hip-Hop's First Decade," many DJs of the time got their 
first turntables and other equipment in the looting that ensued.

Love,

Apollo

  This sounds like this will be a fun party. Congrats to Jack for pulling
this off. Gotta go to school Monday, but it's 1pm, so no big deal. The
only problem I would have going is not getting there, but getting back on
the east side of the bay. So, if anyone on the east side is going and
give me a lift back across the bay, hit me up.
 Peace, Bodhi ^ _ ^

in a perfect world, it would be just totally perfect. in a perfect world, none of my nightmares would actually be predictions that keep coming true...hey, at least i know where NOT to go now. how about where to go? oh, just so many frusterations, but at least, it was someone else's turn today and the day before that and not mine. when it is mine again, in a perfect world, it will be for something else, and my nightmares will become some of the greatest ficticious stories ever written by a gay man. L-O-V-E me not, for i know not how to live with you, and i am trying to resist a few tempting plans like that drunk guy who just walked by me, but he's into a slow mortifying death. :)

Subject: [sfraves] (NRR) Hippie culture

Haight-Ashbury
By Denis Mueller

The "hippies" of the 1960s did not come out of nowhere. They 
were the descendants of the "beats" of the previous generation. 
People like the poet Allen Ginsberg moved quite easily from 
the "beat generation" to the counter-culture of the 1960s. The 
counter-culture is often confused with the New Left, but they 
held an uneasy alliance. In fact, it was SDS who invaded the 
communes of the Liberation News Service and ransacked one of 
the more cultural enclaves of the movement. 

The hippies rejected the cultural norms of middle class society 
and rebelled against its norm and turning convention on its 
head while using guerrilla theater as a means of protest. They 
were more interested in dropping out of the rat race than 
reforming it but retained a anarchist streak that often 
promoted spontaneous actions by the hippies. It was a movement 
that sought a utopia that put them within other utopian 
alternatives of living, which are very much in the American 
tradition.
 

The hippies wanted to live the revolution as if it had been 
won, rather than join organized political campaigns. They were 
more into, a phrase from the day, in creating an 'alternative 
world'. Their politics were more tied to groups like the 
"Diggers", who provided free food to the residents of the 
Haight, than the bomb-throwing tactics of the "Weathermen". 
They became targets for the police shakedowns and, while they 
saw the man as an oppressor, they wanted the police to leave 
them alone and let them live their lives. 

The world of the hippies was also tied to drugs, mostly pot 
and LSD, but not limited to those drugs. They saw LSD, and pot 
to a lesser extent, as mind alternating drugs that could raise 
the consciousness of people. It is, in retrospect, quite 
interesting that LSD was first developed as a mind-control 
program for the Army and CIA. But, back then, it was thought 
that acid could free your mind from the constraints of society.
  
 

Rock music played an important role in the development of this 
youth culture. When the Beatles arrived in America, the seed 
for this culture was planted. They were a force unlike the 
music of the previous decade and soon rock groups began to 
flourish across the country. The Beatles were followed by the 
Rolling Stones, the Animals, the Kinks, the Who and Jimmy 
Hendrix, who was from Seattle but became part of the English 
invasion. In America, groups like the Greatful Dead, The 
Jeffersom Airplane, the Doors and the Lovin Spoonful drew their 
support directly from these alternative pockets of culture.

The flight to the suburbs in the 1950s left many areas, with 
spacious housing, available to the young people. These cheap 
rents in the Haight or on New York's lower east side allowed 
the hippies to live on very little money. It was a generation 
that sought to remove themselves from the dominant culture and 
create their own world. In the end, it failed and was over-
whelmed by the drug culture. But it was an act of resistance 
that sought a way out of the rat race and for a better world. 
That it wasn't is not the point, but it should be remembered 
that there were people who tried to resist the dominant 
consumer culture.

1968, Robert Daniels

Really, depending on what kind of Chicago house your talking about, if your 
into that bangin' sheit you'll be more than happy with Jak. My man 
mixing-wise is hands down the most technicly talented TECHNO deejay based on 
the West coast. He drops so many tracks but actually mixes them, 
LOOOONNNNGGGGG mixes, short tracks, never a dull moment and you'll hardly 
ever hear just one track playing alone. In my opinion it hard to compare 
ANYONE to Misstress Barbara but so far, Jak has come the closest to that 
sort of performance deejaying in my travels.

Honestly he's pretty much the only reason I'll be there... Plus I always 
gotta support my boy Sascha 23. Even if I still cant get with trance or NRG 
(never will BTW).

boom
boom
boom
boom
base beats bounce of the walls of a non descript warehouse
in the darkened corners of this urban underground
where a new light emerges
from spaces that have grown quiet
a new culture of sound, music, and dance is born
and on nights like these we gather under rays of artificial rainbows
moving to hypnotic hits and mesmerizing melodies

my feet follow their path of fight in fours:
up off the ground, turn, back down again, and up
fueled by the air condensing moving through me
as the beats become part of
become part of what sustains me
until there's nothing else around me
and its just me and the DJ
and time means nothing
as the clock strikes 1:00
and time means nothing
as the clock strikes 2:00
and time means nothing
as the clock strikes 3:00
and time means nothing
as the clock strikes 4:00
and there's still people on the dance floor
moving as the sun rises over San Francisco
as the day begins our day has yet to end

sweat pours down my face
my legs are numb
and as I move my arms in time with rhythmic subtleties=20
I am more than me
I am everything and for just one moment the world
stops

boom

boom

boom

boom

and I see everyone around me
everyone from the glowing pacifier welding candy kids
to the fallen angles in spaghetti straps and silver cargo pants
from the jaded clubbers
to the suburban teenagers
form the 17 year olds just looking for something to do on a Friday
to the 35 year olds just looking for an excuse to stay up all night

an they're all here together dancing
as the world out side brew it's morning coffee
here inside we brew a mixture of base and sweat
stirred by swaying bodies and heated to a boiling point

we cheer as the DJ plays that final track
to remind us that it's 6:00am
and we have the greatest counter culture to ever grace the earth
that we can more alive here then we can ever imagine being as sales =
associates
waiters, clerks, or secretaries
but if we ever want to get back here
and feel like we've been reborn as warm air and base beats
all we have to do is
boom boom
all we have to do is
boom boom
all we have to do is
boom boom boom boom
dance

Peace,

Subject: [sfraves] Rave Scene Hits a new Low!!!

Well I just got back from seeing Freddy Vs. Jason and that movie is Damn 
funny with all the bad acting TnA action and all.. But what was really low 
is one of the Main Scenes is where all the Elm street kids are at a "Rave" 
in a cornfield and they play up the glowstick craze real well. I won't give 
to much more away on the bad plot for those that may be seeing it shortly. 
But I guess it isn't any different then seeing a "Rave" scene on 90210 or 
Dawsons creek or any other pubscent teenie bop flick.


oh well..

Macadio

Yeah, I KNOW it's not rave related, that's why I used NRR! 
DELETE THIS IF YOU HATE ROCK.
If you like rock, or you like Sushi, or politics, ( swaybone has political lyrics, and I have this little fantasy about the conservatives on this list getting in a shouting match with the lead singer, the man who takes my handsome husband away from my arms 3 nights a week, while I shout capitalisic propaganda, ok, sarcasim, chill, I did that for attention.) come out and see Swaybone at the Voodoo lounge on Mission 2nite! The show starts at 9 (Friday) If you are complaining about how there is too much trance come out, cause these boys AIN'T TRANCE. Would you belive that there are no"'Rock" lists I can post to? So I hope to dredge up people who love local music on here. 21+ I think $5, 4 bands, ROCK ON!

Subject: [sfraves] SFR Calendar: August 15, 2003 

Illumination means that the delusory distinction between the two shores of
a worldly and transcendental existence no longer holds.

It is not the answer that enlightens, but the question.

A man's true wealth is the good he does in the world. Beauty is eternity
gazing at itself in a mirror. But you are eternity and you are the mirror.
- Kahlil Gibran

Illumination means that the delusory distinction between the two shores of
a worldly and transcendental existence no longer holds.

It is not the answer that enlightens, but the question.

A man's true wealth is the good he does in the world. Beauty is eternity
gazing at itself in a mirror. But you are eternity and you are the mirror.
- Kahlil Gibran

expected, so check our webpage for updates!  This event for all ages will
last from 10 AM till Dusk at a Santa Clara Count park with plenty of shade

everybody is encouraged to bring their food and drink, although there will
be grills onsite for those that want to BBQ--make sure to bring the

Well I just got back from seeing Freddy Vs. Jason and that movie is Damn
funny with all the bad acting TnA action and all.. But what was really low
is one of the Main Scenes is where all the Elm street kids are at a "Rave"
in a cornfield and they play up the glowstick craze real well. I won't give
to much more away on the bad plot for those that may be seeing it shortly.
But I guess it isn't any different then seeing a "Rave" scene on 90210 or
Dawsons creek or any other pubscent teenie bop flick.


oh well..

Illumination means that the delusory distinction between the two shores of
a worldly and transcendental existence no longer holds.

It is not the answer that enlightens, but the question.

A man's true wealth is the good he does in the world. Beauty is eternity
gazing at itself in a mirror. But you are eternity and you are the mirror.
- Kahlil Gibran

In 2001, as Kinetic records announced they chose the relatively unknown
Max Graham to mix the fourth installment of the Transport mix CD, the
music industry listened.  That year saw Max hit #23 in the coveted DJ
Magazine Top 100 - the highest new entry. While Nick Warren proclaimed Max
was going to be a worldwide success after hearing just a taste of his
production work, Paul Oakenfold himself called and invited the artist to
join him on tour dates through the US to Ibiza after hearing him play just
once. Location: 1015 Folsom St., San Francisco Doors: 10pm-6am, 21+ w/ID

Hey all, 
        Just a short note to those who might have been
missin' my presence that i'm back in the scene!!  I've
 been busy as of late, plus wierd shit has been
happenin, but life is back to "normality" now, and
since Jagan, I have time to go to parties, spin my
rekkids, and try to keep up with the list again =)

I'm lookin forward to seein a lot of you peeps i've
been missing at future parties, and hopefully at the
last Code ever :,|  Also, I've gotten a new job at the
new Bose store in Stanford Shopping Centre,so you
allshould come down and visit me (and add some
excitement to my day).  Oh yea, and the store, i
think, is looking for a part timer, so if anyone wants
come by and ask for an application.  It's a very chill
job.  

Cheerio!

Subject: [sfraves] short review: aural confection (Thursday at the Oasis)

Content-Type: text/plain;

What the hell, is there anything going on tonight? (Friday)

It really doesn't matter, I had such a good time last night at the =
Oasis, where I go on Thursday nights because it is convenient (downtown =
Oakland).

They usually have house music on this night.

I'm not crazy about house, but I just like to dance close to home and =
support local establishments in the East Bay (esp. when they have DJs =
spinning records).

Anyway, it was a treat last night because they had live PA to accompany =
the house music, only it wasn't a "rapper", instead it was a sexy =
saxophone player. A very musical dancing experience, indeed. I totally =
enjoyed the ambience of the alto sax.

But I don't know who was playing. I just noticed that he seemed nervous =
at first, even with the small crowd. That's a natural reaction when you =
are doing a live performance. All I know is that I wanted to dance to =
show my appreciation, which I did.

This guy was good--no mess-ups in the sound. (woodwinds can be difficult =
to play--they "squeak")

It brought back memories of my childhood when Mom paid for music lessons =
and I used my uncle's hand-me-down saxophone to learn how to play in the =
school orchestra, and to march in the band (football season).

The Oasis is always full of surprises--just last week they had a fashion =
show to accompany the music.=20

Check it out, if you get a chance, and since they like to have weekly =
parties, watch your local flyers.

Last night, someone told me that on Sunday one of the guys from the =
Wicked crew will be spinning.

so, i went out last night, incognito, of course, and here is what i have to report: everything was loud, there was lots of cheapo lingerie and ugly porn, but the floors were clean...guys who aren't really lifetime wino's, meaning they shower and sleep indoors as a general rule, 
were having to take breaks to sit on the sidewalk outside, because they couldn't stand up straight...someone offered me cash for sex.....got my picture taken.....didn't listen to the music, as loud as it all was...was too busy thinking about peter frampton singing, "do you, you! feel like 
i do? do you, you! feel like i do...woke up this morning, with a wine glass in my hand...who's wine? what wine? where the hell did i dine? must have been a dream...i can't believe where i've been! come on! let's do it again! do you, you! feel like i do? how you feel? do you, you! feel like i do!"......that song is 
well before pretty much anyone's party life, but it can be your party life song too...trust me...go listen to it, and get drunk, if you must...okay, back to my evening...picked up a souvenir, of course, so now i sparkle again...gotta please myself in the midst of all that romantic as hell judgement 
and potential prostition and such...tried to walk past a series of partiers unnoticed to use the restroom...made it, but almost got nabbed by someone who woke up momentarily, so i picked up the pace, and that put a stop to that....lots of really cool lights..i'm into lights....:)

Neurotron

The heads of Neurotron, Axel Schuh and Andr=E9 Kroenert were born in 1978 in=
=20
Guestrow, a small very old city in the north-east of Germany. Since school t=
hey=20
hung around together and developed their love for electronic music by hearin=
g=20
EBM, Industrial, Experimental and Acid-House. After many great and wonderful=
=20
partys and moments with this music they decided to produce such music by=20
themselves. In 1995 Andre started to work as DJ Phrase. Later he brought the=
=20
self-made sound to the dance floors outside the live acts of Neurotron as Le=
 Dub=20
Dwell. In 1995/96 they bought a Roland MC-202 and a 606. Little later a 909=20=
and a=20
whole depot of synthesizers, effect tools and samplers and started to perfor=
m=20
live acts as Yakusa in Guestrow, Rostock and Kiel. At first the sound was=20
realy hard grooving Detroit-Techno, influenced by artists like Plasticman, U=
R,=20
Cybotron, Stacey Pullen & Aphex Twin. Later they begun to use laptops and=20
combined this with the hardware in their studio. By increasing influences by=
 labels=20
like Force Tracks, Raum Musik , Basic Channel or Poker Flat and Kompakt thei=
r=20
sound became more dubby, deep and minimal. In this time they got to know Eri=
k=20
Klingbeil from Berlin. He is a very talented designer, who creates flyers,=20
videos and covers with his artworks <A HREF=3D"http://www.cubelab.de/">(www.=
cubelab.de)</A> for Neurotron since that=20
time. With the change of their sound, their attitude of life and of music th=
ey=20
changed their name as well. Neurotron was born. The harmonious connection be=
tween=20
human nerves and electronic physics. The result : a positive change of=20
perception by electronic. Live this is reflected by both and transferred to=20=
the=20
audience. DJ Phrase changed his name. In 2001/2002 they released their first=
 music=20
on Thinner Records. After this they start to produce for more and more=20
projects. Since 2002 Le Dub Dwell is supporting the whole and cares for the=20
spreading of this attitude outside live acts with his deep and groovy sets.=20=
In 2002=20
they got to know Timothy Dorsey of <A HREF=3D"http://www.deepanddark.com/">D=
eep & Dark Recordings(us)</A> and Alexandra=20
Konka of <A HREF=3D"http://www.deepanddark.de/">Deep & Dark Recordings(ger)<=

Iraqis Offer Tips Over U.S. Blackout

BAGHDAD, Iraq - Iraqis who have suffered for months with little electricity=
=20
gloated Friday over a blackout in the northeastern United States and=20
southern Canada and offered some tips to help Americans beat the heat.

 From frequent showers to rooftop slumber parties, Iraqis have developed=20
advanced techniques to adapt to life without electricity.

Daily highs have soared above 120 degrees recently as Iraq's U.S.=20
administrators have been unable to get power back to prewar levels. Some=20
said it was poetic justice that some Americans should suffer the same fate,=
=20
if only briefly.

"Let them taste what we have tasted," said Ali Abdul Hussein, selling "Keep=
=20
Cold" brand ice chests on a sidewalk. "Let them sit outside drinking tea=20
and smoking cigarettes waiting for the power to come back, just like the=20
Iraqis."

Here are some tips from the streets of Baghdad:

- SLEEP ON THE ROOF. Without power - and hence without air conditioning -=20
Iraqis have taken to climbing up stairs in the hot nights. Some install=20
metal bed frames on rooftops, while others simply stretch out on thin=20
mattresses. "It's cooler there," said Hadia Zeydan Khalaf, 38.

- SIT IN THE SHADE. Many Iraqis head outside when the power's off. "We sit=
=20
in the shade," said George Ruweid, 27, playing cards with friends on the=20
sidewalk. Of the U.S. blackout, he said: "I hope it lasts for 20 years. Let=
=20
them feel our suffering."

- HEAD FOR THE WATER. "We go to the river, just like in the old days," said=
=20
Saleh Moayet, 53.

- SHOWER FREQUENTLY. "I take showers all day," said Raed Ali, 33.

- BUY BLOCKS OF ICE. Mohammed Abdul Zahara, 24, sells about 20 a day from a=
=20
roadside table.

- GET A GENERATOR. Abbas Abdul al-Amir, 53, has one of a long row of shops=
=20
selling generators in Baghdad's Karadah shopping street. When the power=20
goes out, sales go up, he said.

- CALL IN THE IRAQIS. Some suggested the Americans ask the Iraqis how to=20
get the power going again. "Let them take experts from Iraq," said Alaa=20
Hussein, 32, waiting in a long line for gas because there was no=20
electricity for the pumps. "Our experts have a lot of experience in these=20
matters."

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii


Crazy stuff going on back in the D this week, what with the 90+ degree heat and the biggest blackout in history making it hard to stay cool. Of course - we'll be sure to turn the heat up and the lights low this Sunday night at our weekly tribute to the music of Detroit. As always, Motor City mavens Baby Daddy (Rob Goppold) and 12 Mile (Brian Stein) will mix it all from soulful to edgy and back again.

Detroit is free, and starts at 9 every Sunday night at the Skylark, 3089 16st., San Francisco.

Thanks - The Woodward Posse


 

Above: The City of Detroit, waiting for the lights to come on.

Subject: [sfraves] nrr: ztrip be the man @ ben harper

hey everyone....this is pretty random, but i'm just
too stoked about it to not say anything

i'm an enthusiastic ben harper fan, albeit quite the
newbie compared to many of his old school fans,
including my sister.  so we had tix for sat..

jack johnson...doesn't interest me much, but i was
there wicked early anyway to get front row seats for
our ben...and who should i discover is opening and
providing live incidental mixing but 

ZTRIP!!!!

oh so stoked was i, i couldn't believe it.  the frat
boys swilling beer with their arms wrapped around
their trophy chicks could have cared less when the
master scratcher walked up to his decks, and where did
we happen to be stationed?  my eyes were frantically
searching the entire stage, until i looked right above
me and was greeted with a huge ZTRIP banner in front
of my face, we had even haphazardly ended up right in
front of him!

he must have died laughing when he saw the crowd, but
he did his thang which kept the majority happy...he
scratched up some grateful dead, joplin, motown, nappy
roots, depeche, and even oasis.  oasis never sounded
so good..he made them a hell of a lot better.  i was
laughing and dancing my ass off.  he closed with that
signature deal from 'scratch' which closed off the
movie (i forget now..that classical thing..i should
know i'm a bit out of it at the moment).  when he
first walked up to the decks, i flashed my pitiful 

ZTRIP sign made in bold sharpie and my DNA flier, and
he said, 'yeah totally, i'll sign it after.' so he
playd for an hour, but jack johnson came on stage
before he was done, and they literally dragged him
backstage.  insane.  i was pissed.  towards the end of
jack's set, my pal mike turned and said 'hey look
there's your dj' and ztrip was looking out at the
crowd towards where we were hanging, but he didn't see
me:( i ran but missd him, and the backstage peeps were
NOT friendly to me.  so i patiently waited for his
next set in between jack and ben.  sure enough, i
flashed my sign again, and he looks down at me 'SURE
AFTER, ' points to the right 'OVER THERE AFTER'
haha..in front of 8500 people, ZTRIP pointed at me and
invited me to the backstage door!!!

my pal michelle and i got our grooves on some more,
still no one was really dancing except for us, but we
cared not.  i dashed over there after his set and sure
enough, he greeted me despite his battle wound on his
left shin from carting vinyl bins, and signed
everything i gave him, and introduced me to his
girlfriend. he seemed very grateful to have a fan
amongst the crowd.  when he asked if i was going to
DNA i sheepishly answered that i didn't have enough
money, and a lot has been happing personally etc.  and
he was like, 'oh that's ok, how about the guest list?
plus one? if you can make it, if you can make it, it
would be cool' my mouth dropped open and my eyes
widened...personally invited by the man himself...oooh
the excitement...

feeling the ztrip love,

lauren

Good question... But I have seen all but three of the deejays you have 
listed play in the Bay Area over the years.

Derrick Carter will be in Sacramento of all places next weekend, so if its 
not happening in SF there is no excuse. Know what I mean???

>wheres richie hawtin, mistress barbera, ben sims, adam beyer

Hey, if you need a cheap replacement for one of these, you can always call 
me... ;-)

Christian SMith used to throw a weekly in NYC on wensdays, tronic

Notice that as computers are becoming easier and easier to use,
suddenly there's a big market for "Dummies" books.  Cause and effect,

what is there to say. i just think it is all so sweet to be a mutha-fugg'in tourist. what's great about being a tourist is that home is elsewhere, and sometimes, you might think to yourself, "there's no place like home". and their ain't. people really are a product of their upbringing. you can put the cow in the boy, but you can't ever take it out, cuz once the damage has been done, we all know, it's been done, and then there's nothing to do but just accept who you are, what is going on in  your life, and that very little will probably ever change, despite an apparent environmental displacement from time to time. keep your feet on the ground and your ears wherever you want them to be, and always value your true friendships, because without them, you have no friends, and that means, you are a total loner. :)

Subject: [sfraves] sunday night..

hey guys,  i just wanted to see if anyone knew anywhere to dance tonight?  i 
saw the posting for mission "progression"..  probably will check it out, but 
i'm really lookin for something comparable to '1015' or the place next to 
'slimz'... any ideas?  i really wanna dance (no places that are just 'chill' 
or not serious bout kickin up da pantz and lettin it all out)..

-d-



There are those who love music, and there are those that dance.  The music 
lovers enjoy and let the music take them to another place.  Dancers become 
the music and take all around them to another place, by the way ov the 
vibe..

life is good when you've seen Freddy vs. Jason, trust me.  and the scene 
where jason comes and hacks all the ravers to death in the cornfield is sooo 
indicative of where today's cultural mindset is, isn't it?  of course, the 
candy raver who's trying to get down the pants of the girl who's asleep under 
freddy's spell certainly got his.  poetic justice, if you ask me.  anyway ...

Thats a cool list of big name DJs....
Although those are big names that doesnt mean they are any better than a
local who is working as hard as the elite.(no disrespect to any DJs) I
know Sac and the Bay area have a few that could melt the decks given a
chance. Check out some of the weeklies posted to the list and a lot of
those DJs have been booked in Northern Cali.

Off the top of my head here are some events in Sac w/big headliners.

Derrick Carter will be at Elements in Sac. Aug 30th.  In The Mix has
pre-sales.

ONE on Sept 26th has Paul Lancaster at the Tower Club Sac. 
www.djcantos.com for flyer.
(ONE-hosting zebra room @ TowerCLub-Aug22nd)

Spundae is bringng BT out this month aug 31st and Qool (Jondi/Spesh-Looq
Recordings)is hosting a room too.  Im gonna try and make it out.  Ive
never been able to catch BT's performance.

Hope you can find or make it out to a club/event w/good music sounds like
yah need it mang...wurd.

Where did you move from Dank?  and where you at now?

Peace
Sean

It's like this in London as well- a lot of our fave big-time folks from
over there throw their own, often low-key events at small clubs.  When
I first went, I saw Andy from Groove Armada spin for 5 pounds- and I
got to have a few drinks with the both of them first :)  Then next
night it was Barry from the Dub Pistols, for FREE.  Then, of course,
some big clubs'll charge 20 bob ($30!) for 3 or so marginal progressive
house djs, so it runs the gamut.  It's great to see stars not taking
themselves too seriously though.

Funny thing is, I was there promoting a record.  I'd say, "Yeah, I'm
from the US", and the shop/distro people'd be like, "Uch." (this was
just after 9/11)  Then, every time, I'd mention I was from San
Francisco, and they'd be like, "OH, COOL!  How is stuff out there?".

Makes ya a little proud to be around here :)

PIETER K (Breakbeat Science / Metaformal Recordings /
Palette - LA) 
This highly-respected and thoroughly innovative
producer has carved out his own unique sound with
releases on labels such as Breakbeat Science,
Renegade, Phunckateck, Thermal, Vortex, Higher
Education and his own Metaformal. His debut LP,
"Everything All the Time" dropped earlier this year as
BBS's first full-length release and was drooled on by
critics at XLR8R, Knowledge, Urb, Mixer and countless
other publications. His music is known for its
intricate drum programming, emotional depth and
dancefloor appeal. Pieter's career has included
extensive DJ gigs all over the globe and we are
excited to welcome him back to the Bay.

EHL (Warm Communications - Texas) 
Heading up the Warm Communications label with releases
from such top-notch artists as Seba, Equinox, ASC,
P.B.K., Banaczech and Probe One, EHL is known for his
upfront high-tech atmospheric selection. He hosts a
weekly radio show on http://bassdrive.com every
Wednesday from 4-5:30pm central which showcases the
new, harder, dancefloor atmospheric sound. Don't miss
this Bay Area debut! 

ILLFORMANTS (Breakbeat Science / Subtitles) 
Controlled Substance and Angelzero have received much
well-due attention throughout their solo careers.
Recording together as Illformants, they've also turned
heads with a single on BBS and two on Teebee's
Subtitles label, including the wildly successful "The
Bizarre" which continues to smash the top10s and
playlists of a wide range of world-class DJs. Watch
out for these local favorites ripping up a tag-team
FinalScratch session.

Subject: [sfraves]  [bsp]Plastic Surgeons Having Sex

I am sorry to send this again but I am looking for more feedback. Do me
a favor listen to the new mix I recorded and tell me if it is worth the
time to burn it to CD. I have no speakers at work and I recorded last
night and have not had a chance to listen. So listen to the mix for me
let me know what you think. Honesty is cool as long as it is about the
mix and not my hairline. Peace

Actually the Hooj and Lost Language downloads are only a British Pound a
piece, or about $1.60 right now.  If they subtract the VAT it'll be even
less.

Unfortunately I have neither Final Scratch nor CD decks... though I may
download the Lost Language tracks that aren't due for release for several
more weeks.

Ok, I should just ignore you, but just in case you seriously DO need raver friends, and I will give you the benefit of the doubt, I think you should know that someone with your screename and address has been caught trolling this list at least twice, and that is just what I can remember off the top of my head. Since headers can be forged, I would advise you to get a new address ASAP if you were not in fact the person who wrote: 
 
"...and while you are at it, take a fucking shower for once, I am sure many of you smell quite bad after your futile protests last month...".  Or something of that nature. 
 
If that was you, you should know not to troll. it's not nice, and it's not very plurr. So if you really do need raver friends I would advise you to think hard about what it means to be a raver and a friend. After you flamed me, I emailed you privately and told you I would buy you a beer, that you never responded tells me you really are a troll, or like I said, your address had been forged. There is a place dedicated to people who like to fight on the web. It is called Brawl Hall, it can be fun if you are into that sort of thing, but this really isn't the proper place for it.

Yeah, now that its off the media and "cool thing to do" radar... I hear
they have been getting better.

I'll be spending my Labor day sipping margaritas on a beach in San Deigo...
not sitting in a disgusting porta-potty in 110' heat.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] re: i need raver friends

Thanks Sarah, as I tend to believe a lot of things on face value. 
To RealistRaver: Like Sarah I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you're not the ass who flamed her. So, here's your best bet. It's really easy. 
 
1. Go to parties.
2. Be nice, smile, say hi to people.
3. Make friends.

If you just follow these three easy steps, there's really no need to search for new raver friends on a mailing list. 

Also, keep in mind that there could be DEA agents or other law enforcement types pretending to be ravers in order to get names of people to contact or investigate. So it shouldn't be too surprising if your broadcast call for friends doesn't result in much. 
Best wishes,
JonnyR

Subject: Re: [sfraves] book good djs you bummy ass sf promoterwannabe bitchez

since you seem to have the *knowing* of what is cool, and wonderful, I 
suggest you look into getting things started the way *you* want it.  The few 
posts that I have read from you have been nothing but "don't care for this, 
don't want that," etc.
In the party scene, if you want things done the right way, you should do it 
yourself
or don't bitch.
that's what journals are for, not the sfraves mailing list.
I know that I don't have to reply to your emails, and I can skip them,
this may be an opportune time for you to make the SF scene just a bit 
better.
Peace,
Danny

No, seriously... every major promoter in the city reads every single
post on this list.  I am sure right now, they are collectively saying,
"Oh my god, some whiney New York transplant is not impressed with
our scene!  Quick! revamp our entire lineup to suit his whims.  After
all, he is from New York, so he must know better than us lame-ass
san francisco people.  Oh dank.. why have you not graced our poor,
misguieded city sooner?"

We figured out Jason a long time ago.

Jason is a +3 hockey mask of demonic possession. You find it and put
it on... you get real big, slow, and hard to kill, your clothes get
all ratty, and you walk around killing people, especially those who
have sex, do drugs, or talk shit. Eventually, when they do enough
damage to you, the mask just falls off.

Heh. Buffy would kick Jason's ass *and* burn the mask. "See you in
the next sequel... NOT."

;)

Wait- I forgot.  Doesn't SFR have a daily posting limit?  I think about
half the traffic today has been from dank@countercultured.net.

Man, I can just tell you're going to be a popular guy.

love love love.

You don't like raves - why join a rave mailing list?
You like clubs - why don't you go to a few?

Judging from your general demeanor, the only time I'd want you along is if
I wanted to stud myself in spikes and go mosh at a HHC party. Maybe if I
wanted to go on a driveby in Oakland.

You're earning no respect. You have little to give. Why waste your time?

A Feeling of Oneness

The lights flash.  The music thumps.  My skin tingles.  I'm dancing like 
noone else is there.  I begin to wonder, "what has come over me?"  Then I remember 
that little pill.  Courage swallowed with a mouthful of water.  I watch as 
everyone around me becomes more vibrant.  All of a sudden the tempo changes.  It 
climbs to higher beats.  My body reacts as if the music was a infection in 
full control.  I look up to the dj and begin to cheer along with the masses.  
The laser light illuminates pictures in mid air.  I'm lost in them as everything 
slows down.  I seem to have trancended time.  I glance to the left with a 
look of amazement to see a skinny young brunette
expressing with her body exactly what I was feeling.  I then realize that 
everything and everyone was connected through this music, through the room's 
energy.  Then the beat changes, begins to come to a slowing pace.  It creeps 
painfully and pleasantly to a climax.  Taking us all to places we have never felt 
before.  Leaves us suspended in antiscipation.  The crowd's roar becomes 
intense as the music seduces us further.  "Boom", that beat hits with a thunderous 
sensation as everyone jumps and moves to it.  The energy is feirce with 
passion.  An unbelieveably large mass, beating together as one.  One energy.  One 
force.  One ideal.  We are all as one.  I decide that I need to catch my breathe, 
but before I depart from the dance floor, I lean over to the brunette and 
say, "I hope you don't think this is wierd but, Thank You!" not knowing how she 
would repsond.  She looks to me and says, "No, thank you!"  And smiles in 
satisfaction.  I then understand that what I was feeling was not mine own, but was 
shared by everyone there.  I have never felt so complete before, but soon hope 
to feel that again.

Hey there people!

My name is Marco, and as some of you may already know, I'll be moving =
out there to the Bay Area (from Washington DC) in the next couple of =
weeks. Naturally, I'm going to need employment as soon as humanly =
possible. I know that a lot of folks out that way are also in need of =
work, so I'm not expecting miracles, but any help will be sincrely =
appreciated.

The bulk of my work experience lies in Customer Service work. Both in =
call centers, and retail. I've been both a supervisor, and store =
manager, and my work has always included office administration, data =
entry, and general clerical/receptionist skills. I've got almost 10 =
years experience in customer service and data entry alone.=20

If anyone out there knows of anything I might be able to nab, PLEASE let =
me know. I can go from working at a store (of any kind really), to any =
sort of call center, to just being an office paper-jockey. I'm not going =
to be picky about work or salary to start off with, because my goal is =
to start paying my bills as quickly as I can. I've had some offers from =
places out there already, but they all wanted me to start this past =
week, and I still have to finish packing and taking a class before I can =
move. My lease out here ends the 31st, and I will be out of here no =
later than that day (with an additional 4-5 days to drive out there).=20

Any help is great, and if the help results in a job, I will personally =
take you out for drinks or dinner or something in appreciation!!!

Thanks in advance...

what it is not about is soliciting for people to give them the Free =

 if you want a job you're gonna have to bust your ass for it out here.

Subject: [sfraves] Weekend review: Friday night... Fire & Ice

So Friday night... I went 2 Galt w/ Amber & Company 2 check out the shindig & support my Homegirl on the decks!!  The party was like in the same venue like where Power Puff Girls was earlier this year!!  That Huge ball room place!!  Nice NIce Venue!

Anywaze.. when we got there... UberZone was on stage!!  I mean... they do alota like production & stuff... right??  I mean... I was hoping they were gonna do some kinda Live  PA kinda thing, but they jus' like spun records from what I saw!  I mean... it was a good set when I got there!!  Hello 2day... Breakbeats... Yum!!  They also spun alota trance which was Groovy!  I seriously thought Brandon was gonna pop up somewhere... LoL... jk!  But I dunno... even if they did spin some OG tracks, I couldn't tell 'cause I dunno...  They coulda like had something hooked up there where they wre doin' live stuff, but I didn't have my glasses on, so I couldn't tell...

Then Amber went on!!  She started out spinning Hard HOuse... it was kinda weird 'cause I don't think I ever heard her spin hard house b4... but it was fun!!  Eventually... she got into some hmmmm... it's always hard to classify what Amber spins lately.. she jus' spins Amber Music!!  But I coulda sworn that her set went in2 some Hard kinda dark Trance, Acid Trance, maybe some Acid Techo here & there, but man... she totally spun a remix remix of Silence by Delerium!!  Oh mYgosh man.. she dropped it right on time 2!!

See.. what happened, as I notice always happens when Amber gets on the decks & I"m there, is that people leave the room & 1/2 the floors opnly left!  But Amber plays harder tracks as her set goes on & more people start 2 go like, "Oh Shit, this DJs Fuckin' Awesome!"  Then more people start dancing & this mondo crowd like totally builds up in front of the DJ booth!!  I mean... this was so CooL!!  I mean... I would always like yell during a small break in the song & the whole floor would like totally start 2 yell!!  LoL... Then Amber wuld look up & totally be cheesin'!!  It's Groovy!  I kinda yelled "Fuck the DJ" kinda 2 early & we flipped each other off as usual... lol... but man... Amber set was Mondo Fun!!  So Dope!  Thank U Amber Time =)

Whenever it got hella hot from dancing & stuff... I totally went 2 the outdoor section place they had there!!  It was Groovy 'cause Nick was there & we kick it!!  So Was Nicole!!  YAAAAAAAY!!!  Oh gosh... there were a few people who I knew there, but I sooo can'tremember their names right now =\  Anywaze... I went out this 1 time & LoL.. I bumped in2 Simon Apex... LoL... it was Dope 'cause we haven't seen each other since like last summer, so we like totally caught up & talked & stuff!!  I swear man... he a Groovy guy!

So anywaze... he went on after Amber.. OK... Simon busted out his 2st track this cid Breakbeats tune!! BAD ASS man!!  Oh Gosh man... then he went in2 this like Heavenly Kinda Melodic Breakbeats track next.. Yuuuuuuuuum!!!  LoL.. Then that record did this totally funky breakdown & turned in2 this like totally crazy Jungle song!!  It was Dope!!  Then I was like Heeeeeella buggin' 'cause Wow... Simon Apex & Jungle were 2 things I never thought of 2gether!!  

It was during that song that we took off back 2 the Bay...

But the party was totally fun!!  There wasn't like nearly as much people as there was when Amber & I were last there @ that venue... but the vibe was really Awesome!!  Every1 was CooL!  Decorations were kinda minimal, but nice!  2 huge screens of Groovy visuals!  These circles that had projections from both sides playing! 1 was a color thingie changer & the other was these pictures & stuff!!  Behind the DJ booth was this HUGE YING YANG symbol!  

YAAAAAAY.. fun night!!!


Take Care,
Peace-> O§bY {8O)

Pardon me for not adhering to the "rules". Pardon me for trying to get some
help as I move all the way across the country to foreign territory and
attempt to get help from the people I would generally call "peers".

I sit corrected.

  Hey there people!

  My name is Marco, and as some of you may already know, I'll be moving out
there to the Bay Area (from Washington DC) in the next couple of weeks.
Naturally, I'm going to need employment as soon as humanly possible. I know
that a lot of folks out that way are also in need of work, so I'm not
expecting miracles, but any help will be sincrely appreciated.

  The bulk of my work experience lies in Customer Service work. Both in call
centers, and retail. I've been both a supervisor, and store manager, and my
work has always included office administration, data entry, and general
clerical/receptionist skills. I've got almost 10 years experience in
customer service and data entry alone.

  If anyone out there knows of anything I might be able to nab, PLEASE let
me know. I can go from working at a store (of any kind really), to any sort
of call center, to just being an office paper-jockey. I'm not going to be
picky about work or salary to start off with, because my goal is to start
paying my bills as quickly as I can. I've had some offers from places out

Subject: [sfraves] Saturday night... ACME 6 year Anniversary & Reunion

OK... this really wasn't a big thing... but after getting the invite... I was kinda nostalgic & hoping 4 thsi big thing... well... it was a house party instead of something underground... but this was a chill thing I guess!!  It started early & unfortunately I wasn't able 2 make it until later that night around 11 PM 'cause oh gosh..... it was confussing!!

When I got there... OH Shit... Mighty Mouse was spinning & Good Fuckin' Shit man... I ain't seen that Dude since 4ever man!!  So I went in while he was spinning some nice yummy kinda deep house... that was Dope!!  We gave each other this mondo hug 'cause that Dude's still 1 of my closest Bro's!!!

OK... I think Phaedrus went on next & Hello 2Day... He spun Jungle!!  I LOVED IT!!! Oh Gosh man... I Loved his whole set... but man... he busted out this 1 classic Jungle track & I went fuckin' Crazy man 'cause it's 1 of my all time Fave Jungle songs!  Hello 2Day... that set was totally Orgasmic!!

But the Jungle didn't stop there... Happy went on & Yu,mmmmm... continued spinning more Jungle!!  I Loved it!!  Oh Gosh man... he went toally hard during his set!!  All his tracks... it hard to pick out when he got me like hyped the most!!  I Loved it!!  It was Hard Happy Jungle!!  Wow... new genre of Jungle?  LoL

OK... I think Alkaline (another face of ACME & 1 of my Grooviest Homeboys so I ain't seen in a long time) got on next & spun this Dope House set!!!  I dunno, he got off on like well.. it's been a few daze now, & I soooo can't remember exactly what kinda house... but it was fun jus' seein' homeboy spn again!

OK.. Then Brak went on & spun this totally hillarious Disco House set!!  I mean.... he purposely went 4 the cheese!!  It was sooo funny!!!  But it was sooo fun 2 dance 2!!

This Hip Hop DJ spun after that & well... it was what it was & I dunno what I can say since I'm not that bigga hip hop anymore!!  BUt well... he did spun Groovy Tracks... his set was alright 4 what it was...

Then BRD went on & ooooh my gosh man... He spun this really Dope set that went all over the fuckin' place!  He started out spinning Hypbrid, got into trance for a bit, then house, back to breakbeats, breakbeats, breakbeats, more trance, never foofoo btw, then old school tracks, it was amazing!!!  I Loved it!!  I mean... I was @ the point of exsaustion already, but I had 2 stick this set out!!  It waw Awesome!!! =)  I Loved it!  Hello 2Day I <3ed it!

This party was fun!!  I LOVE all the people I hung out w/ over there 'cause they all my Bros & Sistas! I mean... I know I'm like a mondo dork 4 getting there late & missing alota people who swung by, but I dunno... I was hoping 4 like Old School ACME was gonna be there, but well... it wasn't like that & I was CooL w/ that!!  It will happen again I'm sure!!  

Regadless of all that, HAPPY 6 YEAR ANNIVERSARY ACME & Congratulations Joe 4 Graduating!  I so can't wait 'til the next party! =)


Take Care,
Peace-> O§bY {8O)

Subject: [sfraves] *OVERLOAD 3! October 10th & 11th! - FULL LINEUP*

Hardscience and Liquidvinyldjs.com are very pleased to bring you an event 
we've been planning for over 1 year.. the event many of you have been asking 
for..

OVERLOAD 3
Friday, October 10th and Saturday, October 11th!
ALL AGES / 2 Days of Fun - Music - Friends!
2000 Capacity / Beautiful Outdoor Location!
$1 Presale Tickets!

This event means the world to us, and we want it to mean the world to you 
after it's all said and done! Be prepared to come out and have a great 
weekend listening and dancing to your favorite DJs, being among great 
friends and above all else.. having fun! DJs joining us for the weekend:


OVERLOADED HARDCORE AREA:

| MARC SMITH (Notorious Vinyl/Bonkerz : Glasgow, Scotland) *FIRST USA 
APPEARANCE!*
Marc is truly a legend within the UK hardcore scene. Hailing from Scotland, 
where if it's not hard they don't wanna hear it, he is always one of the 
hardest. Playing all throughout Great Britain and most of Europe, he is 
widely known to drop some of the hardest hitting material around. With such 
anthems as "Boom Pow", "Encounters", and "Identify The Beat", along with 
countless others on labels such as Clubscene, Bonkerz, Mainframe and his own 
Notorious Vinyl, Marc has continued to push a sound he has both originated 
and pioneered. Please join us as we are proud to present Marc Smith for his 
first USA appearance!

| STARGAZER (Phase 4/Raw Elements/Elation : London, UK) *FIRST USA 
APPEARANCE!*
In the last two years, Stargazer has proven to be one of the busiest 
hardcore producers in the UK.With several releases under his belt on his own 
label Phase 4, along with appearances on Elation, Raw Elements, Raver Baby, 
and too many engineering credits to mention, the secret is definately out 
that he is the fastest rising producer in the UK Hardcore scene. One of the 
few remaining secrets about Stargazer's incredible talent is his DJing, as 
he rarely plays in the UK due to his busy engineering schedule. This is a 
very rare DJ appearance and FIRST USA APPEARANCE for this amazingly talented 
producer!

| OMAR SANTANA (H2OH Recordings/Moonshine/Topaz : Los Angeles)
This man really needs no introduction. Widely recognized throughout the 
world as one of the USA's top Hardcore DJ's and Producers, Omar Santana is a 
full force to be reckoned with. When he's not touring such far off places as 
Holland, Italy, Spain, Belgium, or one of his many stops here in America, he 
is in the studio writing material for his top Hardcore label - H20H 
Recordings. We are proud to welcome Omar Santanafor a very rare Northern 
California appearance.. so get ready to rock.. and ROCK HARD!

| CLOUDSKIPPER vs. DJ SPREE (Raw Elements/Liquidvinyldjs.com : SF vs. 
Sonicfury.net/Spreeandadb.com : Minneapolis - CLOUDSKIPPER CD RELEASE!)
Quite possibly the most popular and talented Happy Hardcore DJs in the USA.. 
there is little doubt that comes to mind when you ask the fans of these two, 
which stretch all across the world! Cloudskipper and Spree were the 
beginning of Hardcore to many people, especially here in the USA, and over 
time their sound and style have developed into both of them being the most 
respected Happy Hardcore DJs in America. They will be coming out to perform 
together for the first time in 2 years here on the West Coast.. this is the 
one set for all the Harder and the Happier not to miss!

A new raver steps into an anchient scene
and is profoundeded...
he speaks of feeling *energy*
a truth that has gone out of fashion
a purity out of style
a PLUR cliche and catch phrases
he sticks out like a sore thumb
in the valley jaded ravers
where we only speak of venues & technics 1200
this cosmic war, a metaphor
can naive defeat pretentious?
'tis a battle of enternity
infernity envelops us all
ashes to sparkles and dust to methamphetomines...
e-tards and telepathic-super-human-beings

Subject: [sfraves] Osby, thanks for your party reviews, I'd like to see more about the parties

there's been some discussion on and off about what belongs on SF Raves. I just wanted to thank Osby (you nut! Hello 2Day!) for writing his entertaining reviews of parties and events he goes to. 
There's room for all kinds of topics on here, but I'm extra happy when I can read about the events. Did I miss something really fun? What was the music like? What was the energy like? 

Thanks, Osby!  (And, for those of you who don't know the cat, he really DOES talk just like he writes! And his face lights up like a ravin' maniac when he's talking!  
:)

Yes indeed...  I wish there were more party and music reviews on this 
list.  Used to be many people wrote about the parties they attended and 
their personal interactions and/or transformations at EDM events.  Let's 
have more of it:)

Osby  -- his enthusiasm  for our community is refreshing, and his energy 
is, hopefully, contageous.

Love,

Subject: [sfraves] NRR?Weds.:AudioFlashMob (SF)

Hello all. I would like to extent an invitation to all musicians, video 
artists and noise makers. I am organizing a "flash mob" that will take place 
Weds. night between 9:30pm and 2:00am at Julip in San Francisco.

I am asking that whatever you bring out, that it's self contained (i.e. no 
patching into the house PA, bring your own amps, cables, etc.) Also, tell 
your friends. We will have people coming and going ALL EVENING, so there's 
no time requirement, other than after 9:30pm and before 2:00am.

Again,the location is:

Julip Cocktail Lounge (sorry 21+ please)
On Geary, Between Hyde and Larkin (more info at http://www.julipsf.com)
San Francisco

Thanks all.....

Yes indeed... I wish there were more party and music reviews on this 
list. Used to be many people wrote about the parties they attended and 
their personal interactions and/or transformations at EDM events. Let's 
have more of it:)

Osby -- his enthusiasm for our community is refreshing, and his energy 
is, hopefully, contageous.

Love,

I read the reviews that Rhythmzslave/Lauren gave links to (and wrote), and I thought they were all very well written. I didn't go to any of those events but I felt like I had after reading the reviews. And what an excellent black-light picture of the caterpillar! I need to use a tripod more often so I can get sharp pics like that, in the dark. 
Bravo!

Ha....I just now responded to a message of yours about SoBig on another 
list.  My ISP intercepted several unsigned emails today with the subject 
line:  "Delivery Status Notification:  Failure."  They were all infected 
with the SoBig virus.

"Security is mostly a superstition.  It does not exist in nature, nor do

safer in the long run than outright exposure.  Life is either a daring 
adventure or nothing."

"Compassion is not a relationship between the healer and the wounded.  It's 
a relationship between equals.  Only when we know our own darkness well can

Subject: [sfraves] We need the impossible . . .  can anyone help?

Hi everyone!
           My best friend Evan is leaving for Idaho
very soon, and we just found out that we can't throw
the party at  his house because his fam ain't ok with
it.  It was set to be this friday.  We now need a
venue, any venue, with preferrably two rooms THIS
friday, and we don't have an incredible amount to
spend on it.  If this party happens, it is open to SFR
peeps who want to comeDoes ANYONE know of a place that
will take us 'til the wee hours of the morning?

If so, please email or call me ASAP.

Thanks!!!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR:Fwd: Content violation

If you're using Outlook or Outlook Express disable the preview pane. If you
click on a message with an attachment that's harmful and have the preview
pane open it will execute and you will have problems. What I do first and
foremost now is use my powerbook for mail handling. When I'm on my pc and
need to check things to see what kind of attachment it is I right click on
the message, choose properties, then message source. You will see a bunch of
odd looking text, but something that looks like *mime-type* in there. Should
be followed by a file name and if that file doesn't look like something a
friend would send you... delete the message. Basically this is a safe way to
see if the content of the message that has an attachment is friend or foe.

Subject: [sfraves]The needle/AIDs myth about Raves

About 4-5 years ago when I first started partying, I remember my Mom telling 
me, "Don't go to raves! Kids walk around there with needles infected with 
AIDs there!"  I have since exposed my mother to what partying is truly 
about.  However, one time, when I was at this warehouse party on the border 
of Oakland and Emeryville, I was totally tripping balls on E and Acid and I 
could have sworn that this kid wearing dark clothes stuck me with a needle!  
I had a black mark on my arm afterwards..however, this WAS a dirty/dusty 
party, so I could have just gotten that mark some other way.

Long story short, it didn't have aids on it or whatever.  I just recently 
got tested for everything and I am VERY RELEIVED to be negative on every 
test that was run.  Anyway, I was just wondering if you guys had any 
experiences like this?

Yep,

The scare went around at homebase a few years ago at a feelgood event...
Girl screamed right next to me and literally freaked out, then passed out..
Swore she was jabbed with something...  but all she had was a small red mark
on her back..  I kept in touch and nothing came of it.

But in all honesty, if you do your research, youll find that (last time I
checked) there is only 1 instance of needle jabbing/disease transfer of that
nature recorded.. which happened when an inmate stuck a gaurd with a
makeshift syringe full of his own infected blood.

Also, if I remember correctly..  either the virus or the blood can only
survive less than around 3 minutes or so (or was that 30 seconds?)  ...
either way, it made it somewhat difficult to do that in any setting... not
to mention getting needles past any security out there (if there is any)

Never actually had that one happen but i got the old "needle-o-fun" story from all my non-raver friends when i first started...It was hilarious....people were saying, "my friend...she, um....knew this girl....and her brother went to a rave.....and, uh..... his...uh...friend got stuck and then there was a fake tattoo that said "welcome to the world of aids"
 
I told them they'd been whatching too many after school specials!
 
the only thing your gonna catch at a rave is the urge to come back (and maybe a cold from all the skunge in the air....)

Coincidentally, I was just reading about this on snopes.com (devoted to urban legends). The whole thing was never more than a rumor. 
I remember when the rumor was going around. Word was spreading on Ravelinks, I believe, that somebody was "going to" poke people with needles at a massive. As a result, copycats figured that if you poked people with a ballpoint pen, the corner of a glossy flyer, or some other semi-sharp object, they would freak out. There was a lot of media attention in those days, and it's not surprising that some people were trying to take advantage of the hysteria by causing more.

It's a good idea to do this in general, not just because this liates 
worm/virus is out. There are a ton of them out there, also a good virus 
checker helps I use AVG's Free Virus checker, and yes it cought the one 
that is going around in one of my emails the other day. Plus not opening 
attachments from people you dont know, or just deleteing strange looking 
emails in general helps you can always have friends send you things again 
if they actually sent you something and you deleted it.

Subject: RE: [sfraves]The needle/AIDs myth about Raves

How did I miss this rumor.. Or do I just not remember it... Hard to tell
which.

To clear up the aids part via a simple jab multiple times with a "dirty
needle" wouldn't really be feasable.  If someone had just say, jabbed it
into themselves and they have aids, there would be fresh residual blood
on the needle.  With this very thin sheet of blood on the blade it would
dry quickly.  Aids can only survive out in the air for 1 - 3 minutes.
If they inject you with infected blood there is a chance that this is
possible because not too much air mixes into the needle to kill the
contents inside.  Say you see a pool of blood from an infected aids
patient, it has the ability to survive a little longer because the outer
part of the blood starts to clot and keeps air from getting inside.  Now
actually getting infected from it would take it mixing with your blood
via an open wound.  There are a lot of scarier things out there that are
a lot easier and more possible than infecting someone with aids aside
from unprotected sex or needle sharing for IV drugs and the rare chances
from a tattoo parlor.  When I worked for a medical lab we were much more
scared of the Hepatitis strains because they can survive out in the air
for longer and could be absorbed through mucous(sp?) membranes.
Although exploding poo was also a scary thing too.. But that's for
another story. In all reality, the scariest thing for me working there
was the giant wolf spiders that would try and attack me at my desk while
I was working.  Although 30 minutes later in a centerfuge and they posed
no problems.

urban legends). The whole thing was never more than a rumor. 
I remember when the rumor was going around. Word was spreading on
Ravelinks, I believe, that somebody was "going to" poke people with
needles at a massive. As a result, copycats figured that if you poked
people with a ballpoint pen, the corner of a glossy flyer, or some other
semi-sharp object, they would freak out. There was a lot of media
attention in those days, and it's not surprising that some people were
trying to take advantage of the hysteria by causing more.

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: [newstylesound] Origami house mix online!

Hey all, I just finished up a new house mix, which you can find up at:

http://www.djorigami.com/audio/origami-delayedreaction.mp3

It's some of my original tracks and some of my favorite
deep/funky/disco records, a healthy dose of dub echoes and a little
turntablism for good measure.  Good for a sunny afternoon!

Please let me know what you think, and if you want me to spin at your
event (fat chance, yeah, I know!), drop me a line.  

Also look for a new Newstylesound Recordings release (NSS003) in the
next couple of months!

Thanks, done BSPing,
GeorgeC

Subject: RE: [sfraves]The needle/AIDs myth about Raves


So we think.

It seems we can't really decide if HIV is incredibly virulent or
incredibly hard to catch. A lot of the time, I really wonder where science
leaves off and wishful thinking begins. How much of 'you can't catch aids
from...' is just an attempt to quell panic?  I mean, if we found out
tomorrow that AIDS could be passed from person to person like a cold? We'd
have -mass- panic. That won't happen, mind -- if it could pass through the
air like that, we'd all be dead.

Interesting factoid, though. The california dental association (I think
that's what it's called?) recommends that dentists see  known HIV-infected
patients at the very end of the day, so they can sanitize and leave the
room overnight. It's not a requirement, but it's their recommendation.

Perhaps they're being too careful.
If there is such a thing.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

here's my theory: if someone sees that someone set you on fire, and then tells you not to provoke the person who lit the flame when you scream for help in pain, do you think you should answer that 
person in kind when you have a paper cut sometime down the road, and they ask what the band-aid is for? here's a further piece of anthropology for you: do you think you should marry the 
person who supports the original flame thrower, invites new ones into the bedroom, wants gratuitous trust and forgiveness for each deliberate injury, and can't stop handing over thousands of dollars to 
other flame throwers just because "she" would rather you spend "thousands of dollars" at the grocery store than a simple ten in peace? perhaps this sounds outrageous, but are you actually living it? :)

OMG, Hello 2Day, can u imagine??? It would be just like "Gremlins" -- they'd be all over the place in no time! Be very careful not to give them a water bottle after midnight.  :)
Of course, the little guys would be breeding like crazy and also trying to hop into the laps of all the ravers.  hehe ... we wuv u Osby  !

"Security is mostly a superstition.  It does not exist in nature, nor do 
the children of humans as a whole experience it.  Avoiding danger is no 
safer in the long run than outright exposure.  Life is either a daring 
adventure or nothing."
-Helen Keller

"Compassion is not a relationship between the healer and the wounded.  It's 
a relationship between equals.  Only when we know our own darkness well can 
we be present with the darkness of others.  Compassion becomes real when we 
recognize our shared humanity."
-Pema Chodron

Well, the deal is this. I meet this really sweet nice girl about 4-5 months 
ago her name is Jamie. She lives with a mean roommate that gets made when she 
comes home from clubbing or a night out on the towns. *cops where involded* 

So anyway I am trying to find something to do for her last 2 night in 
California she leaves tomorrow at 10pm :-( "SAD". So the real question is what could 
I show her in SF/sac to do rave/event wise. 

She has never been to a rave or an underground event ever in her life. She 
would love to see something before she leaves. 

-=(PS)=-
        Please help me show her one last fun time in CA, please.

Well, I know everyone on this list will hate me by saying this (because =

to
publicize "the underground")...but check out www.djunderground.com.  =
It's a

i foud this in someones profile over the net 


A poem for us.... 

I shave my legs, 
I sit down to pee. 
And I can justify 
any shopping spree. 

Don't go to a barber, 
but a beauty salon. 
I can get a massage 
without a hard-on. 

I can balance the checkbook, 
I can pump my own gas. 
Can talk to my friends, 
about the size of my ass. 

My beauty's a masterpiece, 
and yes, it takes long. 
At least I can admit, 
to others when I'm wrong. 

I don't drive in circles, 
at any cost. 
And I don't have a problem, 
admitting I'm lost. 

I never forget, 
an important date. 
You just gotta deal with it, 
I'm usually late. 

I don't watch movies, 
with lots of gore. 
Don't need instant replay, 
to remember the score. 

I won't lose my hair, 
I don't get jock itch. 
And just cause I'm assertive, 
Don't call me a bitch. 

Don't say to your friends, 
Oh yeah, I can get her. 
In your dreams, my dear, 
I can do better! 

Flowers are okay, 
But jewelry's best. 
Look at me you idiot... 
Not at my chest???? 

I don't have a problem, 
With Expressing my feelings. 
I know when you're lying, 
You look at the ceiling. 

DON'T call me a GIRL , 
a BABE or a CHICK . 

I am a WOMAN. 

Get it?, you DICK!?!

RAVES BECOME ALL THE RAGE

PACHUCA--Through the darkness, young people stumble along an uneven path
into the thick forest of Mineral del Chico, a national park 60 miles
northeast of Mexico City.

Flashes of neon-green and fuchsia-pink lights illuminate the rock- strewn
trail and the Technicolor hair and multiple piercings of the hipsters.
Police at the entrance to the trail frisk everyone who passes through, as
smoke from marijuana joints and the pyrotechnic machine waft through the
dense brush.

Suddenly, the trees give way to a gigantic pit, where 4,000 to 5,000 kids
sway to syncopated music booming from a DJ booth.

This is a rave; a phenomenon imported from Europe that in Mexico draws
legions of young psycheros.  They see themselves as modern hippies.  They
dance all night to "psycho-trance" music.  And they consume lots of drugs
such as ecstasy, LSD and amphetamines, police say.

"This is our Woodstock," said Fernando Cisneros Cruz, 17, of Mexico City.
"We're Mexico's counterculture.  We take psychedelic drugs and party
nonstop."

"We're out here in nature to celebrate peace, love, unity and respect,"
said Cruz, using the English words to form the acronym, PLUR, that
psycheros live by.

With the growing popularity of club drugs, Mexico has become both a
destination and a trans-shipment point for chemical substances, said an
agent for the Drug Enforcement Administration.

The rave scene arrived in Mexico in the early 1990s and quickly attracted
artists and intellectuals seeking a new way to party.  Today, raves make
up a sizable subculture of mostly lower- and middle-class psycheros who
shun drugs such as cocaine and heroin.

A seminal rave event occurred last year in Guadalajara, when police
arrested 40 youths.  Psycheros say authorities reacted harshly because
they saw that raves were quickly becoming a haven for drug users.

The raver's drug of choice is ecstasy, or MDMA --
methylenedioxymethamphetamine, a stimulant and mild hallucinogenic popular
in U.S.  nightclubs in the late 1980s and '90s.

"We're starting to see abuse of ecstasy, LSD and methamphetamine in
Mexico's metropolitan areas," said Dr.  Victor Manuel Guisa Cruz, general
director of the Juvenile Intervention Center, a national organization
funded by government grants and private benefactors.

"Consumption of methamphetamine and ecstasy has increased due to the
youths' lack of knowledge about the enormous danger they cause," said Dr.
Guido Belsasso, commissioner of Mexico's National Council Against
Addictions.

A new study from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine has linked
ecstasy with permanent brain damage and Parkinson's-like symptoms in some
users.

Once imported mostly from Europe, MDMA is now being produced in Mexico,
said an agent from the attorney general's office, or PGR.

"But the quality isn't as good.  The pills are often mixed with
methamphetamine, PCP, or pharmaceuticals," said the agent, who asked that
his name not be used.

Today, ecstasy producers mark their pills with Asian lettering or
stenciled animals, such as scorpions, to build brand loyalty.

At the Mineral del Chico rave, dealers circulate freely, hawking their
wares over the deafening thumps of bass lines: "Ecstasy! Acid! Meth!"

Ravers dressed in ancient tribal wear, bleached-white tunics and glittery
1950s-style space suits routinely stop the dealers.

At 1 a.m., one dealer says he's almost sold out.  "I can barely keep up.
Everybody here wants to get high," said the teenager, clad in a long white
fur coat and matching white-rimmed sunglasses.

Dr.  Arturo Alvarado, a sociology professor at El Colegio de Mexico, in
part blames Mexico's sputtering economy for the growing drug use.

"Without an education or jobs, youths have a hard time integrating
themselves into society," he said.

You missed the previous thread on this article last week. I thought as a
person that's involved with the behind the scenes of sfraves that you would
actually read the list too. Please read before you repost old news. (and go
look at last weeks archives to catch up on what you missed)

agent for the Drug Enforcement Administration.

The rave scene arrived in Mexico in the early 1990s and quickly attracted
artists and intellectuals seeking a new way to party.  Today, raves make
up a sizable subculture of mostly lower- and middle-class psycheros who
shun drugs such as cocaine and heroin.

A seminal rave event occurred last year in Guadalajara, when police
arrested 40 youths.  Psycheros say authorities reacted harshly because
they saw that raves were quickly becoming a haven for drug users.

The raver's drug of choice is ecstasy, or MDMA --
methylenedioxymethamphetamine, a stimulant and mild hallucinogenic popular
in U.S.  nightclubs in the late 1980s and '90s.

"We're starting to see abuse of ecstasy, LSD and methamphetamine in
Mexico's metropolitan areas," said Dr.  Victor Manuel Guisa Cruz, general
director of the Juvenile Intervention Center, a national organization
funded by government grants and private benefactors.

"Consumption of methamphetamine and ecstasy has increased due to the
youths' lack of knowledge about the enormous danger they cause," said Dr.
Guido Belsasso, commissioner of Mexico's National Council Against
Addictions.

A new study from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine has linked
ecstasy with permanent brain damage and Parkinson's-like symptoms in some
users.

Once imported mostly from Europe, MDMA is now being produced in Mexico,
said an agent from the attorney general's office, or PGR.

"But the quality isn't as good.  The pills are often mixed with
methamphetamine, PCP, or pharmaceuticals," said the agent, who asked that
his name not be used.

Today, ecstasy producers mark their pills with Asian lettering or
stenciled animals, such as scorpions, to build brand loyalty.

At the Mineral del Chico rave, dealers circulate freely, hawking their
wares over the deafening thumps of bass lines: "Ecstasy! Acid! Meth!"

Ravers dressed in ancient tribal wear, bleached-white tunics and glittery
1950s-style space suits routinely stop the dealers.

At 1 a.m., one dealer says he's almost sold out.  "I can barely keep up.
Everybody here wants to get high," said the teenager, clad in a long white
fur coat and matching white-rimmed sunglasses.

Dr.  Arturo Alvarado, a sociology professor at El Colegio de Mexico, in
part blames Mexico's sputtering economy for the growing drug use.

"Without an education or jobs, youths have a hard time integrating
themselves into society," he said.

I read the list every DAY.  Since you obviously aren't reading my mail for
me, why don't you comment on what you actually know, which is your
opinions on this matter.

Your banter regarding my involvement is premature and filled with hot air.
Before you waste my time with your opinions on what you think you know
(and obviously don't know about me) there are far greater things that you
can devote your time to.

Why not be productive and spend your time rallying for your political
beliefs before attacking and judging someone else's involvement, which
you seem to know very little about.

I've read the archives, in fact about the past 1000 mails on SFR within
the past week. (Before your post to me). Save your judgements for someone
else, your criticism is unwarranted and ridiculous.

I don't IRC, put yourself in check, not so innocent yet definitely acting
like a child....

If you were so productive, you'd be working, not reading private mail at
work. Have a nice day :)

Oh yeah sorry forgot that you got booted off their for being a source of
drama. So far today I've done more work on the corporate site than you've
done on sfraves in 5 years. Don't ever try to talk to me about working or
what I should be doing Karina. The hyperreal.org after your name isn't
deserved. Why you even are a part of anything SFR is only because you're
legacyware. Dead wood that's kept around out of sheer graciousness of Brian
B. You know it. A lot of us know it. You're a hindrance Karina not an asset.

Maybe I can become really bored and petition for your removal and have
someone *productive* replace you and give SFR a new face. That almost
happened to you and you don't even realize it...

and come on... you gotta come up with something better than playing off the
innocentchild shit. That's so tired. So old. So fucking cheeseball lame.

STOP RAVE ACT II

Your Right to Dance Is Under Attack - Again!

Take Action at: 
http://actioncenter.drugpolicy.org/action/index.asp?step=2&item=11060

Earlier this year, backdoor politics led to the passage of the RAVE Act, a 
law that makes it easier for law enforcement to arrest event holders for 
the drug offenses of their patrons. Now, Congress is at it again. Under the 
Ecstasy Awareness Act live entertainment will receive another threatening 
blow. Your rights are in danger, take action now!!

Already the RAVE Act has been used to intimidate promoters of festivals and 
political fund raisers into calling off their events. Like the RAVE Act, 
the Ecstasy Awareness Act, could effectively ban live music and dancing 
while throwing innocent people like you in jail. In light of the fact that 
drug use is a probable occurrence at any musical event, HR 2962 opens the 
door for any concert promoter, event organizer, or nightclub owner to be 
fined and jailed. It doesn't matter if they tried to prevent people from 
using drugs. Nor does it matter if the vast majority of people attending 
the event are law-abiding citizens that want to listen to music and not do 
drugs.

The Ecstasy Awareness Act of 2003 is another dangerous piece of legislation 
that could prevent you from seeing your favorite band or DJ live! It is 
vital that voters contact their Representatives and tell them not to 
co-sponsor this bill.

Actions to Take:

** Fax your Representative today. To find our more go to
    http://actioncenter.drugpolicy.org/action/index.asp?step=2&item=11060 .

** Forward this alert to your friends, family, and co-workers.

For more information on this bill, go to http://thomas.loc.gov/ and under 
"bill number" search for HR2962.

ROAR!
THE NATIONAL DANCE AND MUSIC RIGHTS ALLIANCE

::POWER TO THE PEOPLE WHO PARTY::

SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 6, 2003
NOON TO MIDNIGHT
DEMONSTRATION AT THE US CAPITOL
AGAINST ANTI-MUSIC LAWS

THE RAVE ACT HAS PASSED!

Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean everyone's not out to get you.

It's been a crazy couple of years for the Electronic Dance Music scene. On
top
of the last decade of being targeted with raids, arrests, harassment,
intimidation and smear campaigns, last summer saw the introduction of the
now-
infamous RAVE Act. Passed in the spring, the law can fine promoters,
managers,
or employees up to $500,000 and/or imprison them for 20 years for holding an
event where even a single person is arrested for narcotics--potentially
shutting down events everywhere. This year, we are facing the CLEAN-UP Act
and
the Ecstasy Awareness Act, both of which would impose far harsher penalties.

Last summer, well over a thousans descended US Capitol for ROAR! and
America's
first ever party-as-protest. Other events have popped up in cities all over
the
country--Seattle, NYC, LA, SF, Austin, Albequerque to name a few--marking
the
start of an entire movement and bringing a whole generation to power.

This summer join ROAR! and let's bring thousands to the US Capitol for a
free
outdoor festival and protest against the continuing assault on music,
dancing
and civil liberties. We will display the force and unity of our culture
through
performances by international headlining talent, speakers from major
industry
groups and politically influential organizations.

just thought i'd share my thoughts in my exact words. here's some motivation: i am sure that as soon as i am done, that i will remember what it was that was so pressing earlier. last night, i was thinking to myself, "i wonder if i got the job done".  now those weren't my exact words. my exact words were actually filled with obscenities, but a person can still pass off the sentiment without using the exact original phrases. the overall result should be the same. i actually do mean this in the most evil sense of the word. sorry to be so proper about it all, but i am just protecting my own ass really, and if i change my mind, hopefully anyone who i don't want to change their minds will and anyone else who hasn't come to any firm decisions yet will, and basically, everything will be as comfortable for ME as possible, because basically, if i am not happy, there's gonna be hell to pay! :)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] SRR: News - Mexico: Raves Become All The Rage

ok, obviously there is some bad blood here but I don't think  the entire SFR community has to keep hearing about it. We're making a massive out of a molehill. 

Is it such a big deal if someone posts something that's already been posted? Is it so hard to just delete it? Maybe if people have an ongoing dispute, they can roll up their sleeves and take it off line. 

All right, go ahead and say I'm naive, but at my first rave, somebody explained PLUR to me. I figure some of you people have been into the rave thing so long that you've forgotten, or maybe could use a little reminder. 

P for Peace. This isn't worth fighting over! 

L for Love. ok, probably no love forthcoming between the adversarial parties, but maybe some ability to at least Let It Be. 

U for Unity. We probably all have a lot in common and it's silly to be fighting each other when we have real enemies (e.g., Ashcroft, adverse court decisions, and people who charge too much for bottled water...)

R is for Respect. There's no need to get personal and insulting when disagreeing with people. We are not a homogeneous subculture (No! I'm not talking about cultures in homogenized yogurt hehe) so we should expect differences in perspective. It's rude to flame people on message boards, even if there's a smiley face in the sentence.

(I've heard of an enhanced version of PLUR called SLURP but that's for another post!)
Sorry if I seem like a do-gooder trying to break up fights. I just don't like aggression.
John

I just have to say that after about 5 months of no dancing, it was sure great to dance at Retrogade with Brandon, Moshen, Tim, Eva, and everyone.  I love Breakbeats!!!  Brandon, Tom, Madame Mercury kept me moving to their beats and it was Great!!   
Happy Birthday Brandon!! You're hilarious when you're drunk.  :-)   i bet you don't even remember me spanking you 28 times too.  :-P    Well, Thanks again for an awesome time last nite.  



God Bless U!  Love, Your sister in Christ, Tami :-)

It only takes a spark, to get a fire going & soon all those around can warm up in its glowing, That's how it is with God's Love, once you've experienced it, you spread his love to everyone, You Want To Pass It On.

heheh. hey i've gotten a few job links off here. I think that totally 
rocks, even if I haven't gotten called back from the jobs.
but sometimes emails like this make us feel better while we sit and ponder 
our unemployed existence

So having that said, add my name to the Gladly willing to work crummy ass 
jobs, please give me a job list!.

Subject: [sfraves] Re: Dave Egger's picks HATFYR for top 10 bands!  (bsp!)  

oops, i sent that prematurely.   more info on the band
is at:  http://www.herearethefactsyourequested.com

I didn't spin with the band on the latest album Felt,
but it fuckin' rocks.  (coincidence that I wasn't
involved?  hehe. ;o)    I'm gonna be working with them
again soon and the new album has been picked up by a
distributor in Europe.   These cats were on the cover
of the SF Weekly about 5 months ago.  Anyway, check
out the site for music samples & info.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] [NRR] I need a damn job

This reminds me of a Dilbert strip I saw a while back.

Dogbert has decided to infiltrate management for some reason.  And in order to
do so, he basiclly just screams at the execs: "I AM A LOUD DOG!  GIVE ME A JOB!
 WITH STOCK OPTIONS!  (Did I mentiom that this was an OLD Dilbert?).  I WANT A
COMPANY CAR!".  And he got everything he wanted just by loudly demanding it.

Come to think of it, maybe I SHOULD try this approach.  It can't work any worse
than what I've been doing otherwise.  (The traditional approach... Resume on
the 'net, mailing it out, dressing nice for interviews, and so on.)

No actual comparison is intended between anyone on SFRaves and any dog, comic
or otherwise, BTW.  This thread just made me remember that particular episode.

Subject: [sfraves]DJs: Loose mixer knobs? NRR

The knobs on my Vestax 05 pro are kinda loose, especially on the fader.  I 
can basically pull it off by pulling upwards.  I tried posting on a few DJ 
forums and the only responses I got were to either stick some kleenex in 
there, or some electrical tape.  Is this really the best fix?  I am sure 
some of yall have had to deal with this.

Thanks.

I have seen a few scratch djs use a lighter on the bottom and then put
the knob on. I personally haven't had the problem so I can't tell you
how well it works but if it makes you feel better the scratch djs I saw
doing this were doing it to a Vestax of the same model. Peace

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

"DETROIT" - our experiment in culture transplantation and mixup, continues this week - this Sunday night at the Skylark. 
 
Opening up, DJ 12 Mile, moonlighting from his drummer gig in Pirate Radio, will rock the D's rawkus garage noize and irresistable Motown charms of old.  Later, Baby Daddy will hop on the decks and whirl out a bpm ranging hot mixx across other side of Detroit's soundscape (that is... distinctive hip hop, proper techno, the deepest house, electro neuroses, new school IDM, and ghetto freak festivity).
 
As always, the inventive bar staff at the Skylark will conjure up their own mixes to insure your Monday morning hangover is well worth it.

The Skylark is located at 3089 16th St. at Valencia, San Francisco.  
 
See ya Sunday!

The next Come-Unity is planned for Labor Day weekend.  Wicked is looking at 
a party sometime in September.  I'll send you Simon's email off-list.

clarification first: i am trying to keep up with the volume of mail....if i missed you, sorry. if you are significant to me, i did do a quick sweep for you, and you might have to hit me up again. don't feel rejected if you know for sure that i actually like you, meaning, you actually know me...okay, chanson du jour:

Subject: [sfraves] Music for the Ride to the Party and the Ride Home

A week ago a friend asked me if I could throw together a mix for a friend
of his to whom he wanted to expose some new music.  He e-mailed me the
list of tracks he wanted, I added some of my own, and digitally mixed it
with MP3s (since I have only a couple of the tracks on vinyl).  The result
was a decent chillout/mellow club/trance compilation, that seems suitable
for the ride to the party tonight or the ride home tomorrow morning.  ;)

http://www.deciblast.org/forums/dload.php?action=file&file_id=3

The tracklist is within that link as well.  There's even a cue file so you
don't have to fast forward through one 80-minute track...

http://www.kartre.net/audio/digital.cue

Hope ya like it.  =)

Anyone heard cong fury by Juno Reactor?  is that not the tightest f*ckin'

It's the track during the opening fight in Animatrix:  Final Flight of the 
Osiris    I got the collector set of the animatrix with the soundtrack, and it's 
most excellent!

Juno Reactor rules in general.  "Feel the Universe" and "Pistolero" are
two of my faves... and Traci Lord's "1000 Fires" album is actually decent
thanks to the Juno production.

a supersmall shred of kleenex/tp4yorbunghol *does* work.  figure about a
3/8" by 1/8"  piece, draped over the top of the inner black plastic.
then, push the knob on, with about ten pounds of force.  if it doesn't go
on, try a little bit less.  it'll just pop on, and your woes will be over.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] How bout this

I forget if I've done this on the Hyperreal list yet, but each month
(starting in, uh, August, LOL) I'm trying to post a "Top 7 + 3" list of my
seven favorite current trance tracks and three older ones I've
"rediscovered"... these three may be old hat to some veterans, but they're
either forgotten by or new to me.

Here was the last batch:

Top 7 Current Favorites

Mike Shiver - Feelings (Rusch & Murray Mix) [Lost Language]
Karada - Last Flight (Robert Nickson Mix) [Lost Language]
Mesh - Esthetic Visions [In Trance We Trust]
Pulser - My Religion [Godskitchen]
Misja Helsloot - First Second (Signum Mix) [First Second]
Rah - Wave (Airbase Mix) [Platipus Euro]
Iio - At the End (Ultrasun Mix) [Made]

Top 3 Rediscovered Treasures

Art of Trance - Octopus (Man with No Name Mix) [Platipus]
Vicious Circles - Vicious Circles (Max Graham Mix) [Platipus]
Christopher Lawrence - Shredder (Transa Mix) [Hook]

If you go to http://www.deciblast.org/~epsilon/ you can hear sound samples
for most of the top 7.  Of course all ten can probably be found on
SoulSeek or some other file-sharing service.

You should also check out the forum at http://www.tranceaddict.com. 
There've been a couple threads on there about "Top 100 Trance Tunes" or
"Best Trance from 1992 to 2000".

I'm not too educated about other genres, but there are plenty of people on
the list who are.  =)

 From the Speakeasy network:

We are writing to inform all of our customers running Microsoft
IIS, Microsoft Windows 2000 or XP operating systems of a recent
viral threat to the Internet. If you do not have any computers
running Microsoft IIS or either of these operating systems, you
may disregard this alert.

The most recent virus threat to the Internet, W32.Welchia.Worm,
also known as, W32/Welchia.worm10240 [AhnLab], W32/Nachi.worm
[McAfee], WORM_MSBLAST.D [Trend], Lovsan.D [F-Secure],
W32/Nachi-A [Sophos], Win32.Nachi.A [CA], Worm.Win32.Welchia
[KAV], has been upgraded by Symantec to a Category 4 (of 5)
threat.

This worm attempts to download the DCOM RPC patch from Microsoft
Windows Update Web site, install it, and then reboot the
computer. It then checks for active machines to infect by sending
echo requests, or PING requests, which will result in increased
ICMP traffic.

The worm also attempts to remove the W32.Blaster.Worm.

For further detail regarding this worm, please visit:

Symantec:
http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/w32.welchia.worm.html

McAfee:

To remove this worm from your system, please visit:

http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/w32.welchia.worm.removal.tool.html

Note that if you use McAfee software, removal instructions are on the
indicated page.

Additionally, we ask that you run a full 'Microsoft Update' to
ensure your machine is fully protected from this worm and any
other security concerns.  It will be necessary to reboot all
machines that are patched and updated, otherwise the updates will
not take affect.

that "rave music" is Timo Maas's remix of Azzido Da Bass Dooms Night
a sick ass breakbeat track spun by techno, house, and trance (breakbeat
too, obviously) dj's all over the world! that track got mo play than a $2
h0! one of my favorite tracks of all time. Why not refer to it as
electronic music instead of rave music you fucking fruit loop?

Subject: [sfraves] Rah Rah Rah (was re: How bout this)

The story I heard was "Wave" -- or maybe it was the A-side "Glow" -- was
actually intended to be a remix of Moogwai's "Neon", an awesome track in
its own right.  The remix sounded so different that it didn't make it onto
either of the two Platipus releases of "Neon", but was good enough to
merit its own release on Platipus Euro.

It's goofy that the tracks on that Rah record are credited as the "Airbase
Remix" and "Original Airbase Mix" since Rah and Airbase are aliases for
the same guy.  LOL.

And speaking of Platipus, I just got the newest Plati pressing: Greg
Murray's "I Feel Loved".  Definitely going to be in my September Top 7. 
=P

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Anti Dance Commerical (with rave music!)

Dear Gods man..  Who pissed in your cheerios?

Yeah, I know what it was..  It was sent to me as a play on the anti rave
sentiment of our government.

And trust me..  yeah, I know what music is, I know what Electronic music
is..  And Im sure since your "countercultured" you happen to know I work and
participate in and around most counter/underground/what-have-you culture as
is.  But then again you may just be spouting off in ignorance..  but hey ..
thats ok.. thats your right as an American Citizen, and I fight for peoples
rights..  so go for it :-)

And just because I go by the kandyman name doesnt mean you can play me off
as a stereotype.

Anyways.. on another subject.  Hope everyone has fun next week.. Im off to
burningman.. then chillits, then the DPA conference in New Jersey..  For
that matter..  the Harm Reduction Colalition is holding their conference in
New Orleans next year.. that ought to be a trip.

To everyone else, sorry for the mini rant.. this just caught me off guard,
and Im due my one "rabid response to a flame" per year.

I promise I wont do it again till next year :-)

See you on the playa (Im at the Pancake Playhouse this year.. FREE pancakes
every morning!)

Subject: [sfraves] bootycheck!


booty music lovers unite, up by popular demand i've just added my infamous
drunken oode set from last year to my mp3 online set stash - unedited,
mistakes and all (I actually ended up blacking out and waking up wrapped
up like a burrito in a vinyl wall torn from a neighboring camper's shade
structure covered in antbites... with some anarchists pouring icewater
down the end of it laughing their asses off).  Oh the horror...

in any case, a fun raunchy mix, also great for bump-testing car audio
systems.

5th one down entitled "booty_at_oode"...

Yes, my work computer (Toshiba Tecra laptop running Windows 2000 Professional)
got infected and it died. All data is lost. I am screwed. Hope I can recover
some data from the network shared drives. The problem is that I don't think I
saved everything. (lesson learned, again) 

I really think that backing up should be easier than it is in real life (i.e.
faster) Users would do it frequently. We all know better, but sometimes we don't
take the time to save off data in another location.

Backing up is even more important now with these rampant computer problems.

At least all of my email is archived for me on an MS Exchange server. Work email
is such a vital source of information for technical writers. Now I can spend the
rest of the day recovering my subject matter expert threads.

Boy, I really need to dance now.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] NRR: It happened to me [was: Virus News]

If a company can't spend the money on an automated backup system, one of
your IT guys should be able to write a simple VBS script or batch file
that backs up certain folders to a network user share just by
double-clicking on it with all your data and applications closed.
That's what we do here since its like pulling teeth to get anything
approved to purchase.  The network share should be backed up to tape as
well.  All servers should ;)

Wait, do you work at Comcast?  Or is that your personal email.  If
comcast I'm seriously surprised you don't have a backup solution.

That's why you should also be active in your efforts not to get a virus and 
or watch for any signs that you might have one. because YES backing up 
things is a pain in the ass. I've been trying to do that just so I can 
format my computer. (I like to format every once in awhile. easy way to 
clear off junk ) I always stress to my grandma, becareful of what people 
send you. if anything looks even a tiny bit off, delete, you can always 
have the person send again.

It was infamous with many of the 200ish people there.  and their friends.
and maybe their friends' friends.  after that I think it loses something.

And finally, Mister Nathan Seven (if that *is* your real name), I'd like
to thank you for using Opera to *download* my set rather than stream it.
A couple people have tried to stream it using WinAmp... why?  Just go
ahead and download it (for all you virus carrying windows users -> right
click on the link and save link to disk).  Better on server, better on
you.  That way if it sucks you delete it, but if it doesn't you don't have
to download it again... and playback doesn't rely on network conditions at
every point between my webserver and your box.

no, my secretary has not finished going through the mail for me yet...this is just me mouthing off....okay, why do most people go to work..oh they have to pay for housing, usually rent, because they don't feel like buying at this time or maybe ever...oh, maybe food, probably food, like chips and hamburgers and candy bars (not good quality...just popular brands)...fries, coffee (not quality coffee, pay for the kind that has been sitting in the pot heated for about an hour...tourist)...ummm, oh, sometimes they might feel like giving their child a toy or some clothes and sometimes they'll spring for a mantinee...spy kids!...why should you really be going to work? you should be going to work so you can be a really cute boy in cute boys clothes, like me. i like being considered a sexy guy. there's a lot of responsibility behind it...sometimes some mockery, but a guess that goes with stardom...i mean, most are not opposed to me, and that makes it hard for a guy like me to make decisions
 about anything other than my calvin's and such. :)

Subject: [sfraves] EGR Records / Defcon XI / BManPanner (BSP)

This is a little quick shout out...

I am just launching my label EGR Records:
http://egr.egregious.net/

Full high quality mp3s of the release available at the above page

Mix set from Defcon XI  (with EGR-01 in the mix)
http://www.egregious.net/comps/xenos_defconXI/

And last but not least the unveiling of BManPanner.. The custom software I 
created for 8 channel ambisonic panning on the Sol System array at BM. If 
you are heading out there we will have by far the largest system there 
(www.solsystem.org); north east corner of the map. I will be heading up 
spatialization M-W using my software among other tools. It will be fucking 
mind blowing.  I go on 2:30am early Thursday morning.

http://audio.egregious.net/scream/images/picture.cgi?pict=BManPanner/BManPanner

The BManPanner uses parametric paths to create trajectories that can be 
automated. It sounds really kick ass.. I could go on and explain the 
details for days, but there really is nothing else out there that I have 
found like this in regard to commercial software..  woooo... The 3rd panner 
(red one) is for the ladies! Parametric equations are a turn on, right?

Ok.. Bye..

Subject: [sfraves] How bout this

Instead of me pickin' stuff I got and commenting on it, does anyone have
any 
suggestions for some really good trance?  I like's hard, fast, slow,
ambient, 
D&B if you gots it even.  I'm looking for the best of the best for DL.
I want 
to wake to a groove that I will feel every morning, in every car ride,
even 
in the shower.  Please hook me up!?
Sincerely,
       MrPink

isn't Kelly's 21+?

it normally is, but i guess what i'm asking is it going to be one of those
parties where all the under-21 peeps get corralled into a little area and
don't get to hear half the music in the booze-serving areas?

just wondering.

expected, so check our webpage for updates!  This event for all ages will

everybody is encouraged to bring their food and drink, although there will
be grills onsite for those that want to BBQ--make sure to bring the

need to go to school this year with confidence.

...or summin like that.

Aight email massif, we've got another sick night of junglistic goodness
comin' at you tonight.  It's so fan-fucking-tastic that we can't even tell
ya exactly what's going on, except for the fact that there'll be phat
beats and such.  Mantis Sound might be out... but they might not.  We
might play polka house... but we might not.  We might get silly crunk and
waffle at the end of the show... but... ok yeah we'll most likely do that.

Either way, Jerel and myself will be on hand to make sure that you don't
go without your weekly dose of the 'box.  Runnin' from 7pm 'til
when-the-fuck-ever AM (eastern standard, of course), we'll be holdin' down
the fort on Jungletrain.net (just in case ya forgot!).  Here are some
links for your fine dining experience:

As mentioned earlier, Mantis Sound is still TBC.  If not tonight, we'll
have 'em on eventually.  So don't fret, my pet(s).

Future (confirmed) lineups:

Subject: [sfraves] (NRR) Losing the War on Terror

Losing the War on Terror
by David Wiggins 

There you have it. There is no longer any doubt 
whether the Bush administration's actions are 
having an impact on terrorist activity. They 
are having a definite impact. They are 
increasing terror. Bottom line: No one truck 
bombed the UN compound in Iraq when Saddam 
Hussein was in charge. 

We have Jordanian Embassy bombings, oil and 
water pipeline explosions, SAM missile potshots 
at airliners in Kenya and SAM missile salesmen 
in the USA, attacks on peacekeepers in 
Afghanistan, suicide bombings in Israel, Bali, 
and Saudi Arabia, a rejuvenated Taliban, a 
nuclear North Korea, a nuclear Iran, Osama bin 
Laden on the loose, Saddam Hussein on the 
loose, and the USA in 4th place on the world 
terror hit list.

What is Bush's response to all of this? Losing 
is winning. You see, the more it looks like we 
are losing - bombs and explosions, incinerated 
Humvees, dead soldiers and civilians, debt, 
deficit, drugs, etc., the more we are actually 
winning. It's all very simple to Dubya. Getting 
our asses kicked is a sign of progress. It is a 
sign of "desperation" on the part of the "dead-
enders". On August 19th, referring to the attack 
on the UN complex in Baghdad, Bush said:
"Every sign of progress in Iraq adds to the 
desperation of the terrorists and the remnants 
of Saddam's brutal regime." 

You know the dead-enders. They are the "give me 
liberty or give me death" crowd. They have this 
silly idea that if they keep using irregular 
tactics against their occupiers, they might 
actually defeat King George... uh, I mean... 
President George Bush. 

Bush and Blair lies to the contrary, it is now 
clear that US and British intelligence services 
as well as any other intelligence services they 
cared to ask knew that Al-Qaeda had little or 
no presence in Iraq before the US invasion. 
Saddam Hussein made sure of that. He didn't 
want any competition. The only Islamist group 
in Iraq at all, Ansar-al-Islam, was confined to 
a small remote corner of northern Iraq. Saddam 
Hussein could not get at them there because the 
area was under the protection of the United 
States via its unsanctioned "Northern No Fly 
Zone."

Now we see that the US invasion of Iraq is the 
best thing that ever happened to Ansar-al-
Islam. Paul Bremer, the US civilian 
administrator in Iraq, said there was, "clear 
evidence of an Al-Qaeda-related terrorist 
group, the Ansar al-Islam, reconstituting its 
capabilities inside of Iraq since the war". The 
group is now operating all over Iraq. It is 
suspected in the bombing of the Jordanian 
Embassy in Baghdad on august 7th. The Al-Qaeda 
recruiters haven't had it so good since the 
Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. A recently 
released message to the Al-Qaeda troops exhorts 
them to go to Iraq to kill Americans. But this 
is all good news to the Bush Administration. It 
just shows how desperate all those terrorists 
are. "Bring them on!" says George. I'll bet the 
UN personnel really appreciate that.

In Afghanistan, the Taliban seem very 
desperate. In case no one noticed, those dead-
enders are making more comebacks than Freddy 
Krueger. Last week witnessed the bloodiest week 
in Afghanistan since the US invasion of that 
country, with over 100 dead due to bus 
bombings, rocket attacks, clashes with Taliban 
militants, and between rival militias in 
southern and southeastern Afghanistan. 

Remember George Bush telling us that the drug 
trade was a major source of financing for 
terrorism? It is a sign of how desperate things 
are in Afghanistan that the production of opium 
for heroin is up to its highest levels ever. 
Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld called the 
production of opium in Afghanistan a "whale of 
a problem." The country now is the largest 
opium producer in the world - and to think that 
the Taliban had essentially eliminated opium 
production in Afghanistan. Now that is 
desperation! Given President Bush's losing is 
winning philosophy; Afghanistan is a two-bagger 
because there, we seem to be losing both the 
"War on Terror" and the "War on Drugs." Opium 
production is up in Colombia too. 

Representative Henry Hyde states that opium 
production in Colombia has revived. It 
supplies, he stated, ''more than 60 percent of 
U.S. heroin.'' George Bush, of course, would 
say that all this just shows how desperate the 
terrorists and opium producers are for money. 

Osama Bin Laden must be very desperate. He 
keeps sending out inspirational messages to his 
mujahadeen. On August 18th he exhorted the 
mujahadeen to go to Iraq to fight US forces. On 
the 19th he claimed responsibility for the 
largest blackout in US history. President Bush 
says we'll "smoke him out". Osama must have an 
incredible tolerance for smoke. We have been 
"smoking" for almost two years now. Producing 
all that smoke, no wonder the Bush 
administration is opposed to the Global Warming 
Treaty. But not only are we "smoking him out," 
we are "tightening the noose" around Osama's 
neck. I wonder if there is a Guinness Book of 
World Records entry for "world's largest noose" 
or perhaps, "worlds slowest tightening noose." 
George must be ecstatic about the desperation 
shown by the terrorists on the home front. 

According to the London-based World Markets 
Research Center, the US is the 4th most likely 
nation to experience a terrorist attack. Of 186 
nations, we come in behind only Colombia, 
Israel, and Pakistan. Remember the terror alert 
system? You know the Crayola crayon color-coded 
system any child could understand? Perhaps 
Dubya could explain to my eight year old son 
why the code has never dropped below yellow if 
we are safer from terrorism than we were a year 
ago. Little David keeps asking me that, but I 
can't give him a convincing explanation. 
Perhaps you could do it, Dubya, I mean you 
being the "education President" and all that? 
Why I even recall that no national crisis would 
stop you from finishing your lesson with 
elementary students. 

Actually, this losing is winning philosophy 
President Bush describes explains a lot to me. 
Not only does it explain the "War on Terror" 
and the "War on Drugs, " but it helps me 
understand how the massive budget deficit is 
good for our economy, how the massive trade 
deficit is good for the future of our nation, 
how the "Patriot Act" is good for my freedom, 
how refusal to sign the "Global Warming Treaty" 
is good for the environment, how developing new 
nuclear weapons helps stop nuclear 
proliferation, how government secrecy regarding 
energy, 911, Iraq (mis)intelligence, etc., is 
good for democracy, how....well, you get the 
point. In fact, according to this philosophy, 
George Bush must be the best president ever. 
But, Helen Thomas already said that.

David Wiggins is a West Point (United States 
Military Academy) distinguished graduate and an 
honors graduate of New York Medical College. He 
left the Army as a Conscientious Objector 
resigning his commission as an Army Captain on 
the Iraqi front lines during Operation Desert 
Storm. He is currently an Emergency Physician.

The US Government has declared a War on Music. We are the target of busts,
arrests, harassment and intimidation, all with the ultimate goal of destroying
our culture and silencing the music we love. The recently passed RAVE Act
threatens to scare club owners and promoters into shutting down events
nationwide for fear of imprisonment of up to 20 years and/or fines of 
$500,000.
Even harsher laws sit in Congress right now.

This summer, join ROAR! for a demonstration against the assault on music and a
festival for our civil liberties. We will display the force and unity of our
culture through performances by international artists and speakers from major
industry groups and politically influential organizations.

Invited Speakers:

Dennis Kucinich - 2004 Presidential Candidate, US Representative
Douglas Rushkoff - Author of Ecstasy Club, NYU
Graham Boyd - ACLU
Ira Glasser - DPA
Shawn Heller - SSDP

"Security is mostly a superstition.  It does not exist in nature, nor do 
the children of humans as a whole experience it.  Avoiding danger is no 
safer in the long run than outright exposure.  Life is either a daring 
adventure or nothing."
-Helen Keller

"Compassion is not a relationship between the healer and the wounded.  It's 
a relationship between equals.  Only when we know our own darkness well can 
we be present with the darkness of others.  Compassion becomes real when we 
recognize our shared humanity."
-Pema Chodron

FAULTLINE 5 
Saturday September 6 2003 
Drum 'n Bass & Oldskool Hardcore 

PIETER K (Breakbeat Science / Metaformal 
Recordings / Palette - LA) 
This highly-respected and thoroughly innovative 
producer has carved out his own unique sound with 
releases on labels such as Breakbeat Science, 
Renegade, Phunckateck, Thermal, Vortex, Higher 
Education and his own Metaformal. His debut 
LP, "Everything All the Time" dropped earlier 
this year as BBS's first full-length release and 
was lauded by critics at XLR8R, Knowledge, Urb, 
Mixer and countless other publications. His 
music is known for its intricate drum 
programming, emotional depth and dancefloor 
appeal. Pieter's career has included extensive DJ 
gigs all over the globe and we are excited to 
welcome him back to the Bay.
 
EHL (Warm Communications - Texas) 
Heading up the Warm Communications label with 
releases from such top-notch artists as Seba, 
Equinox, ASC, P.B.K., Banaczech and Probe One, 
EHL is known for his upfront high-tech 
atmospheric selection. He hosts a weekly radio 
show on http://bassdrive.com every Wednesday from 
4-5:30pm central which showcases the new, harder, 
dancefloor atmospheric sound. Don't miss this Bay 
Area debut! 

ILLFORMANTS (Breakbeat Science / Subtitles) 
Recording together as Illformants, Controlled 
Substance and Angelzero have received much well-
due attention. In addition to their solo careers 
they've turned heads with a single on BBS and two 
on Teebee's Subtitles label, including the wildly 
successful "The Bizarre" which continues to smash 
the top10s and playlists of a wide range of world-
class DJs. Watch out for these local favorites 
ripping up a tag-team FinalScratch session.

i don't know what kind of article to write today...hmmmmm, i still have not been to africa yet. i think that in africa, i might have to plan way, way ahead and study a whole lot more about bugs, because i like rain forests from afar, but also, when a single fly is buzzing in my ear, i am very angry and foul...also, mmmmmm, maybe i would need to stay in a fancy air conditioned hotel, and then go out for day trips or something along those lines. i can't imagine that i would enjoy a real safari. maybe i would, and i just don't get it, but i don't trust anyone really 100% except for me, and why invite a whole host of gosh, you know, like this is what i mean...if you go to the shoe store, and let someone help you pick out your shoes, you will know what i mean by this...now, a mistake with shoes is one thing...a mistake in africa could be fatal. :)

I just wanna thank all you promoters that booked me.  You gave me the time of 
my life.  You gave me wealth in more ways than one.  And I am just this Asian 
hermit that's always had this dream of being the next techno star...you help 
give me a chance to expose my music in a live pa kind of way...

Thank you for listening...Thank you for everything everyone. I never felt 
truly connected...I sometimes hated this list, but i was addicted...because in 
the end of it all, i always cared what was going on in our beloved bay...

Doodling in class and came up with a philosophical question to throw at you:

What is our (human beings) greatest invention and why?

What is our worst invention and why?

I'll give my answer latter.

Enjoy the brain exercise!
Peace, Bodhi ^ _ ^

The wheel, for enabling most future technology.

The land mine, for being easily obtainable, easily placeable, and
impossible to completely recover.

it's funny that you ask this, as one of the random things i like to ask 
people is what they believe are the top 10 inventions of all times.  of 
course, one pothead i asked said that weed was the best invention, so i 
reminded him that humans didn't invent that one, nature did.  ;-)

on my list, which is still a work in progress, are sunglasses, indoor 
plumbing, showers, toothbrush/toothpaste, computers & the internet, the 
automobile, music, ice cream

>What is our worst invention and why?

war, greed, pollution

with love,
kriss  =)

lol, humans invented pollution? Not according to Ronald Reagan (possibly our best president ever, until our current one!!!), who claimed that trees were the biggest polluters in the world.  
He probably thought of this while raking leaves ... but I wonder how many times he actually raked his own leaves. 

I do actually have a vote for best invention: written language (hey, I'm a writer and editor, what do you expect?)

worst invention: guns (because their invention allowed people to be more distant from the people and animals they kill, thus making the killing impersonal)

Subject: [sfraves] Philosophical question for the list



Doodling in class and came up with a philosophical question to throw at
you:

What is our (human beings) greatest invention and why?

I think perhaps the greatest invention/discovery was that of rhythm and
beat and harmony and the later induction of musical instruments.  It has
the ability to evoke all emotions within' oneself, its what people
people make when there's no electricity and they need to cure boredom,
its what our parents sing to us as children to put us to sleep or to
explain a concept, its what gets us moving on the dance floor and all
pain disappears, but it can be just as dark as it is good.  It's been
used in communications from the perspective of history and a means to
pass it from generation to generation to the code of maneuvers on the
battle field.  

I'm a little fragmented right now so my gammars and meaning is probably
all hosed but yeah.  Music. 

What is our worst invention and why?

The ability to write and read.  It is what destroyed/created
civilizations since those in power control language without meaning to
because it is a way to segregate others who can't.  I expect many people
to disagree with me on this, but what is philosophy without two sides.
Yes, poetry is wonderful, lyrics are wonderful, tales of far away lands
are wonderful, but all this was done by many a uncivilized people person
to person, father to son, generation to generation and people were able
to remember more and recall more since if they lost it it would be gone
forever.  

-Rayn

I'll give my answer latter.

Enjoy the brain exercise!
Peace, Bodhi ^ _ ^

i was going to say "instant coffee", but then i realized it's many good
uses (example:  chocolate/coffee cakes).

how about the Tandy computer model T-2000.  a lame-duck computer that
while predating the schwartzenager association, was nowhere nearly as
cool.

1) Written language. In complete opposition to Rayn, here -- I was sitting
around pondering (and reinstalling deus ex -- lots of guns, best game
ever) and as it struck me, I came back to read other people's responses.
Let's fight about it, Rayn! :) Before the written word, information was
subjective and easily contaminated: the problem with word-of-mouth
transmission of ideas is that each person who passes it on embellishes,
or forgets, or twists the tale or what have you to his viewpoint. Aside
from high ritual and religious/mystical traditions (and, often, those too
changed -- albeit more slowly) information before the written word was not
reliable or constant. It's arguable if it is now, but it certainly is an
improvement from playing telephone with your tribe. Written language /is/
what allowed civilization to flourish. And despite all the shit it's
caused, civilization is beautiful. Even our demented, psychotic, and
sometimes down right evil american civilization is beautiful.

2) I can't think of an invention we'd be better off without. I'm dead
serious. Knowledge is not 'bad'. Invention is not bad. The uses we put
these things to are... regrettable, but they're part of our progress as a
species. Either we'll survive our own madness or we won't. If we do, each
thing we've created -- even the worst things, the guns, the nukes, the
nerve gas -- will be a lesson we've learned. If the human race moves on to
become something better, it will only be because we made so many mistakes
along the way.

Alternately:

Philosophy/Philosophy.

Peace, love, onions,

Somebody already said the Wheel, so..  I'd have to say Mathematics.  As
much as the ability to quantify our world has created problems for us
as a race (such as..  The incessant drive to quantify the world), it's
enabled everything from the development of higher logic to computers to
astronomy to cash registers.  We'd be playing in the muck without it.

> What is our worst invention and why?

Explosives.  They're useful for blowing tunnels through mountains and
such, but apart from that they've given us guns, bombs, the internal
combustion engine (gas is an explosive), and all manner of other things
we use to kill ourselves and eachother on a daily basis.  Also, the
explosives paradigm fueled the advent of nuclear science (at least, the
facet which deals with splitting them), which has allowed us the power
to blow ourselves up even more efficiently.  Score.

Agriculture = movement from a nomadic existence to a stable platform for 
civilization = beer, wine and weed.

Coercive, manipulative, institutionalized religions.  More minds ruined and

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Philosophical question for the list

This is really getting interesting.  So many flip flops on what people think
is the best and worst.. :) Each listed so far has had so many positive and
negative things associated with it throughout history.  Except for sewers
(unless they're backed up) and Danny.  I'll have to say I agree with Apollo
on organized religion being worst which is where I really got my disgust of
the written language.  I think I should reclarify where the invention of the
written language is worst.  Many of the ancient civilizations that didn't
use pictograms only had a small number of people who actually knew how to
read and write.  Or lived in a place where only the social elite or monarch
was allowed to be literate  Even through time up until the late 1800's most
people didn't know how to read and write.  This is how religion was able to
have such a strong foothold and control the masses.  Religious leaders could
say whatever it is they wanted to say was written in there and the people
would believe it with no questions.  And unlike today they had no way to
communicate to others what they heard other than the phone game whereas now
we have live broadcasts, organizations setup to point out falsehoods etc.
So I guess it may be getting better as more and more people are able to
understand what's being written and able to see opposing viewpoints as well.
But I guess it really depended on which society you were in.  I think I'm
going to back off here and say that pet rocks and carpet tacks are the worst
things ever invented.

blaming "written language" for the existance of a contemporary caste system is like blaming handguns for the existance of murder.

worst: thalidomide.

best: music... it soothes the savage beast you know :)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Philosophical question for the list

Best Invention:  The Internet.

I know it sounds stereotypically nerdy.  But I really can't imagine how I got
along before the 'net.  Take the existance of SFRaves itself, and the
friendships I've formed through this very list.  The likelyhood of this
happening through another medium is slight.  The 'net has all but replaced
casual phone calls.  Now, instead of chatting with one person at a time on the
phone, I can talk to half a dozen ppl or so simultaneously.  And it had all but
replace the post officefor me.  And its usefulness as a research tool... if
there's anything I don't know... any fact that I can't recall the soruce of...
I don't have to go to the library, much around with card catalogues, drudge
through dead-tree crud.  All I have to do is type "www.google.com", and whe
world is at my fingertips.

Knowledge is power, as they say.


Worst invention:  Money

Just this last week, I lost my best friend because of a dispute over money. 
And the stink of it was, that *I* wasn't (well... shouldn't have been) involved
in said dispute; except that one party was do damn set on "winning" that he
just had to draw in and affect third parties.  So now, my best friend is gone,
and his friendship with ANOTHER person ended, because of money.


cya,
john

The semiconductor.  First used in a transistor.  Lead to computer, the
Internet, and on a grand philosophical level, expands the power of the
human brain.... and connects human brains like we are doing right now
with email.

> What is our worst invention and why?

There are no bad inventions.  Only bad application of inventions..

So, a better question would be, "What is the worst application of an
invention"

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Philosophical question for the list

I think I'll start with the worst invention...prejudice.  It is, in my
experience, a learned behavior.  Be it racial, weight, sexual preference,
whatever.  I'm not saying I'm perfect or without any bias, BUT I do
challenge myself when I feel it coming on.  I challenge those around me as
well.  Hating someone or something for the sake of hating is ignorance at
its best.  Then there's the argument that just makes me sick:

"I didnt always feel this way about <insert random hated person, sect,
gender, etc here>, but one day I met this <insert random hated person, sect,
gender, etc here> and they did BLANK to me.....

Cop out city!

Best invention...Lube. Definitely.  Vaseline is just nasty.  Honey is stcky.
Baby oil only works when you have rubber sheets and a water bed.  Astroglide
however is the best.

  Electronic music. Electronic is a evolution of the first sound that came from the big bang 15b years ago in the east is called the OHM. Music fads and genres come and go, but electronic music is forever. Think about it, how many sounds can electronic music create?

Since electronic music is boundless, our potential is boundless.

*sniff*  Yeah, great, ain't it?  Ravers *are*
hippies-for-the-new-millennium, after all.

We just have shorter hair and spend far more money on gadgets and
clothes.

What's wrong with patchouli, anyway?  ;)

Here's a tip for those of you heading to Burning Man that haven't left
yet:

Sandra Collins will be doing a late night, extended set on Wednesday
night at the Opulent Temple of Kaos stage at "10:00 and Creed". I've
been invited to follow her up and keep things going at Magic Glasses
starting at 5:00am which is across the playa at "3:30 / Esplanade".

For some other interesting places to check out and the rest of my
"confirmed" appearances, you can check a special online version of my
newsletter at: HYPERLINK
"http://www.djdragnfly.com/dflynews-special.htm"www.djdragnfly.com/dflyn
ews-special.htm.

There's another big time headliner that will be playing along with us at
Sol System on Saturday night, but I've been vowed to secrecy. Come find
me and I'll let you know who will be making his debut at Burning Man
this year.

To those who can't go, I'll be thinking of you and if you're one of the
lucky ones who will be out there, come on and find me and let me show
you some crazy sites!!!

see y'all in a week!!!!

Subject: [sfraves] BSP:  DJ Pierre at Club 6 on Friday

--=====================_13325304==.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

I'm not associated with Club 6, but I thought this might be of interest to 
the house heads out there.

Club 6's Legends of House series continues with DJ Pierre, the "godfather" 
of acid house, this Friday.

Much respect to DJ Pierre.  His involvement with house music goes back to 
its earliest days when, as a member of Phuture, he recorded the seminal 
"Acid Trax."   He departed for a solo career as a DJ and recording artist 
in the late 80s and became famous for his "Wild Pitch" sound, which was 
based on a lot of tweaks and effects.  Putting his own spin on the acid 
house genre he helped develop, wild pitch soon became a much-copied mode of 
production.  He's had hits as Photon Inc. and Aly-Us, but he hit a mild 
slump in the mid 90s that was ended with "The Horn Song."  In the tradition 
of the best tracks, it was alarmingly simple yet soulful, with an 
irresistible hook driven by a simulated trumpet.  The song was so 
successful that Strictly Rhythm decided to maximize its potential by 
drafting Barbara Tucker to add vocals.  Now known as "Everybody Dance," it 
crossed over to the pop market and revitalized Pierre's career.  He runs 
his own DJP Records and is again in demand as a remixer.

Also spinning:  Vince Lawrence and Jesse Saunders, the "originator" of 
house music.  Jesse is popping up all over these days.

I haven't seen DJ Pierre in some time, and Vince Lawrence is another 
Chicago house heavy.  Club 6 is fun, so I'm not going to miss this one.

Love,

Apollo

Boh!

What's up people??  I've got the sets up from this past Sunday for you to
stream or download whilst at work or whatnot.  Over 10 hours of
drum'n'bass sweetness from us hardcore bastards and our guests.

.. F8 & Psykofly [3:15:48]
Two of Mantis Sound System's hustla crew members whip out a nice set.
Lots of crunchy hard tunes, sick dubs, old school teases, and even some
80s jams.

Secret of Finding Happiness Explained
Money Can't Buy Happiness, but Health and Family Can

By  Jennifer Warner

Aug. 25, 2003 -- The key to finding happiness may be learning to shift 
personal priorities from the boardroom to the bedroom.


New research provides evidence to support the old adage, "You can't buy 
happiness." It suggests that people will find happiness by focusing more on 
family life and health issues and less on career and financial pursuits.


Researchers say people spend too much time worrying about achieving 
professional and monetary goals that may never bring them true happiness. 
But by devoting more time to personal health and family life, people will 
find lasting happiness.


Happiness Explained

Researcher Richard Easterlin, an economist at the University of California, 
argues that a new approach to finding happiness is needed that combines the 
two prevailing theories of happiness in psychology and economics.


According to the psychological view of happiness, each individual is born 
with their own setpoint for happiness that's determined by personality and 
genetics. Life events, such as marriage, loss of a job, and serious injury 
or disease, can temporarily raise or lower a person's level of happiness 
above or below this predetermined level, but they will eventually return to 
the original level.


In contrast, the economic "more is better" view of happiness argues that 
life circumstances and the growth of income have lasting effects on 
happiness.


But Easterlin argues that life events like marriage, divorce, and serious 
disability, have a lasting rather than temporary effect on happiness. And an 
increase in income doesn't necessarily bring lasting happiness because a 
person's expectations are also raised by through adaptation and social 
comparison as they achieve greater wealth.


A better theory of happiness, Easterlin says, should take into account the 
fact that happiness found through family life and personal health is 
affected much less by heightened expectations and social comparison than 
happiness sought through financial gains.


Make More Time for Health and Family

Easterlin says people make decisions assuming that more income, comfort, and 
positional goods will make them happier, but they fail to recognize that 
adaptation and social comparison will come into play and raise their 
aspirations to about the same extent as their actual gains, which leaves 
them feeling no happier than before.


"As a result, most individuals spend a disproportionate amount of their 
lives working to make money, and sacrifice family life and health, domains 
in which aspirations remain fairly constant as actual circumstances change, 
and where the attainment of one's goals has a more lasting impact on 
happiness," writes Easterlin.


"Hence, a reallocation of time in favor of family life and health would, on 
average, increase individual happiness," Easterlin concludes.

this is an interesting, but I belive flawed way of looking at happiness...
It would make more sence to look at happiness as a process instead of a
"thing" that can be aquired or lost.. so inorder to obtain "happiness" all
we need to do is repeat that process. now, it's true that for some this
process is triggered by acuireing wealth or having a stable home or good
health, but these are only triggers. It's posible to re-frame(taking a term
from NLP) any negitive situation into a positive and even change this so
called "pre-determined" level of happiness. So, what I'm saying is that
happiness is not an involuntary thing, it's something we do to our selves
when we are reminded to do so by triggers such as getting more money or
being in good helth, or just getting up in the morning and feeling that
first breath of fresh air from a new day...

Mystic

I think the first common mistake is to view happiness as a destination or a
goal. "If I acquire (XYZ) than I will be happy. If I lose, marry, gain or
change (XYZ) than I will be happy." Happiness can never be attained or
acquired especially if it involves outside influences. Happiness is a way,
not a destination.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] 2 BAD MICE - FRIDAY! / Aug. 29th / 5 STAR FUNK

there is absolutely no way you heard 2 bad mice nor
any other moving shadow artist on the radio in
1993..unless it was on steve masters live105 modern
mix.  he actually broke a bunch of good techno/
breakbeat jams.  i think the first time i heard da
juice 'hear the angels' was on his late night mix show
in 1991/2.  i believe 'bombscare' was released in
1992.  so i'd say 95-96 or so for 94.9 and the likes,
when radio DJ wankers did bootleg remixes of it.  but
not 93.    commercial radio had no idea of this stuff
back then..

Subject: Re: [sfraves] 2 BAD MICE - FRIDAY! / Aug. 29th / 5 STAR FUNK

Look back to the early 90's and the birth of FreshJive clothing. That was
*rave* clothing 100% back then. It was *ug* clothing that was also popular
to wear *above ground*  At that time Live 105 didn't suck nuts like now and
they used to play  music from the rave scene which at that point was still
pretty ug and not widely known about here. Altern-8, Prodigy, Messiah, Utah
Saints, LA Style, 2 Bad Mice, Jay-Dee, and so on were all radio play. Are
you telling me that because it's on the radio it's no longer ug? Then what
is ug? Is this like that *I'm more punk than you* thinking? There ain't shit
these days that's really *ug* anymore IMO. The whole *ug* term is just a way
to set yourself apart from others and be more elite than the other guy.
There is and will always be leakage from the less-commercial side of things
into the commercial side. =)

dood i heard that track on HOT97.7 the first time i took acid which was in
the 5th grade - i remember this VERY well! i dont care if it was "just
hitting the rave scene" - what i am saying was that it was also on
mainstream radio.... which in my eyes doesn not mean it was underground....

Even though Steve Masters was a total drunk he did play awesome music. He
provided a lot of the soundtrack to my high school years (90-94). I remember
when he would do the ads for the Edge in Palo Alto. You'd hear The Shamen,
Eon, and other non-commercial radio play tracks being played. But the
Master's mixes... oh so cool. Remember when they did Transmitter
Adjustments? Used to hear all sorts of stuff you would normally never get to
hear! Then Live105 got bought by CBS, had an enema, and became a corporate
suckoff of a station. But 88 - 94 was good times. Remember when KMEL was a
top 40 station?? LOL.

there is absolutely no way you heard 2 bad mice nor
any other moving shadow artist on the radio in
1993..unless it was on steve masters live105 modern
mix.  he actually broke a bunch of good techno/
breakbeat jams.  i think the first time i heard da
juice 'hear the angels' was on his late night mix show
in 1991/2.  i believe 'bombscare' was released in
1992.  so i'd say 95-96 or so for 94.9 and the likes,
when radio DJ wankers did bootleg remixes of it.  but
not 93.    commercial radio had no idea of this stuff
back then..

So one day you get a show//set on a radio station and you play music that
you would play at your own parties. You just cut your own ug nuts off in the
process by doing that? Hmmm... somehow I don't think that's right. If the
music that you hold dear as *ug* gets plaid in constant rotation then yeah -
no way in hell is that anything but commercial-pop. But once or twice, late
at night, most likely a weekend in know way makes things less *ug* or more
commercial.

dood i heard that track on HOT97.7 the first time i took acid which was in
the 5th grade - i remember this VERY well! i dont care if it was "just
hitting the rave scene" - what i am saying was that it was also on
mainstream radio.... which in my eyes doesn not mean it was underground....

Subject: Re: [sfraves] 2 BAD MICE - FRIDAY! / Aug. 29th / 5 STAR FUNK

how can something be underground if it is in the spotlight? how can
something remain 'word of mouth' if it is being presented over the radio?
that is not 'underground', its 'mainstream' or 'abvove-ground'....

yes Ryan, that is correct... if i were to get a radio show and start playing
music that i consider to be underground, i would no longer consider those
tracks to be underground for the simple fact that they have been exposed to
the mainstream (i.e. none underground)... unless the show as a whole was
considered underground.... if it was a mainstream radio station then i would
no longer think the tracks to be underground....

what is more important, bringing your music to the masses (and still calling
it underground) or actually KEEPING IT UNDERGROUND? if people want to bring
the music to the masses then they have to realize that they will be losing
the "underground" label since it will no longer be "underground"....i am not
saying that either of the two is more correct; but you cant have both.... if
it is being played on a mainstream radio station, then it aint
underground... its that simple... it may have started out as being
underground, but is no longer underground....

See that's horrible. What that basically says to me is that you want to keep
this musci all to yourself and an exclusive circle of your liking. By having
one track touch a radio station, played once, it's not tainted and might as
well be a leper. Are you really this posessive over music and who should
hear it? If so that's kinda jacked. As far as I've ever been able to tell
you have been in this scene for the music first and foremost. It's the music
that keeps you around. Strangle the channels in which people hear the music
you love so much to only a *ug* environment and you gut out a lot of fresh
blood and the propogation of *new*  You dj because you want to share the
music you love with others...

the scene isn't comprised of punkrock attitude and those that front that
attitude miss out on so much...

how can something be underground if it is in the spotlight? how can
something remain 'word of mouth' if it is being presented over the radio?
that is not 'underground', its 'mainstream' or 'abvove-ground'....

yes Ryan, that is correct... if i were to get a radio show and start playing
music that i consider to be underground, i would no longer consider those
tracks to be underground for the simple fact that they have been exposed to
the mainstream (i.e. none underground)... unless the show as a whole was
considered underground.... if it was a mainstream radio station then i would
no longer think the tracks to be underground....

what is more important, bringing your music to the masses (and still calling
it underground) or actually KEEPING IT UNDERGROUND? if people want to bring
the music to the masses then they have to realize that they will be losing
the "underground" label since it will no longer be "underground"....i am not
saying that either of the two is more correct; but you cant have both.... if
it is being played on a mainstream radio station, then it aint
underground... its that simple... it may have started out as being
underground, but is no longer underground....

I always thought the "punk rock attitude" was to not sell out and stay

underground, I think he was simply saying that once something is playing for
the general masses it's no longer underground.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] 2 BAD MICE - FRIDAY! / Aug. 29th / 5 STAR FUNK

thank you Nick....

that is precisely correct.... i do not want to keep all the 'ug' music
hoarded all to myself... actually, i am quite the contrary... i want to get
the music out so that more and more people can hear it and enjoy it as i
do.... but by doing that you can no longer call it 'underground'! for once
it has become 'above ground' it can no longer be called 'underground'....

doesn't this make sense Ryan? its not some super genious way of looking at
life; its more of a black/white way... its one or the other, and cannot be
both!

i really dont see how anyone cannot grasp that concept....

Subject: RE: [sfraves] 2 BAD MICE - FRIDAY! / Aug. 29th / 5 STAR FUNK

But by that definition then no electronic music unheard or not would be
underground since raves and associated parties were broken into the
media around the mid-90's if not sooner thus destroying the udnerground
that we still believe is there.  We may still be able to pull off great
all night parties, not call them raves anymore, change the names of
genre's around but its not going to change the fact that unlike in the
early or even mid-90's if you asked someone if they heard of electronic
music or techno they'd just stare at you thinking you were talking about
disco or 80's music.

Its all perception.  To me underground means unheard by the masses and
the majority of people don't listen Subsonic or the other late night
shows on mainstream radio which are local to this area (and each area
that has a show like this).  Sure, something in rotation throughout the
day like Fisherspooner or Oakey or Prodigy would be mainstream or at
least above-ground, but everyone has to have a launchpad to the
underground and it's not always going to be word of mouth.  Techno
didn't just happen, it was pulled from ideas and samples from
above-ground music and media from every generation before it in an
evolutionary process.  My brother introduced me to the music which I
fell in love with but if it wasn't for local all-night alternative radio
with show's playing music from the "underground" I wouldn't have been
able to find out who to contact about finding raves in my own city since
he was from Denver and there wasn't quite a UTRaves yet (or an updated
one until I took over then gave up on as well,) nor did I know to look
for record shops and the clothing stores I went to had no fliers and
none of my friends knew what the hell I was talking about.

Image is nothing, obey the music you like regardless of where you hear
it.

how can something be underground if it is in the spotlight? how can
something remain 'word of mouth' if it is being presented over the
radio? that is not 'underground', its 'mainstream' or
'abvove-ground'....

yes Ryan, that is correct... if i were to get a radio show and start
playing music that i consider to be underground, i would no longer
consider those tracks to be underground for the simple fact that they
have been exposed to the mainstream (i.e. none underground)... unless
the show as a whole was considered underground.... if it was a
mainstream radio station then i would no longer think the tracks to be
underground....

what is more important, bringing your music to the masses (and still
calling it underground) or actually KEEPING IT UNDERGROUND? if people
want to bring the music to the masses then they have to realize that
they will be losing the "underground" label since it will no longer be
"underground"....i am not saying that either of the two is more correct;
but you cant have both.... if it is being played on a mainstream radio
station, then it aint underground... its that simple... it may have
started out as being underground, but is no longer underground....

Subject: Re: [sfraves] 2 BAD MICE - FRIDAY! / Aug. 29th / 5 STAR FUNK

The world isn't black and white. It's mostly grey area. The real question
comes down to a matter of opinion. What makes something UG and at what point
does it stop being UG? To you, in terms of UG music, as soon as that music
is played on open airwaves where the masses can hear it the music becomes no
longer UG. Suffice to say whether the station is commercial or not you're
playing to the masses. Really it seems more like if your UG music gets
played on a commercial station vs college radio or public access radio
that's a deciding factor in the demise of UG status. Take into mind
perspective. What's totally commercial to you is probably UG to some kid in
the mid west or else where. A side note to the commercial vs non-commercial
media mention earlier. The music is going out on all the same radiowaves
that are accessible to the masses. So really this is an anti-commercial
media argument you're making and not so much a pro-UG argument.

That said -
You have your opinion which says - *If it touches commercially owned
mass-media it's no longer UG even if it's played once*

I say that's BS. Just because some dj decided he liked a track that's UG and
played it once on the radio with all liklihood to be forgotton makes it no
longer UG? No way.

The next kid that's never heard any of the music you and I listen to might
hear that song and say - *WOW! What is this?? I've never heard this??* and
to him it's a taste of the underground and for that person that music *is*
UG to them.

It's all just opinion and yours is a lot more programmer like in it's
absolute nature. On or off. Yes or no. There is no maybe eh? =)

thank you Nick....

that is precisely correct.... i do not want to keep all the 'ug' music
hoarded all to myself... actually, i am quite the contrary... i want to get
the music out so that more and more people can hear it and enjoy it as i
do.... but by doing that you can no longer call it 'underground'! for once
it has become 'above ground' it can no longer be called 'underground'....

doesn't this make sense Ryan? its not some super genious way of looking at
life; its more of a black/white way... its one or the other, and cannot be
both!

i really dont see how anyone cannot grasp that concept....

What about those artists that stay at the fringe. There are some that
sell out their art so that they can afford rent and then to be able to
fund their less mainstream work.

Almost every artist I know does this -- thereby destroying your concept
of Black and White theories, cheese.=20

Especially the case since ideas and themes, once separate will always
bleed into the other.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] 2 BAD MICE - FRIDAY! / Aug. 29th / 5 STAR FUNK

Not really feeling like arguing, however, I would like to point out:

 who the f**k is this "Mr. Underground" and why does he get to decide, 
which is which?
 is it Mr. and not Ms. ?

...Folks, I would have to say 'underground' is in the eyes of the beholder. 
And not to be ironic, what I just said isn't the end all standard either. 
What one may think is underground, may not be to the next guy (due to 
exposure to different experiences in life, level of participation in a 
chosen lifestyle, etc.).  And for that who cares? If I were to say "Gee, I 
am going to the best 'ug' party and you said 'Well, now Jack, that isn't ug' 
" - I would probably tell you to ... well, we'll just stop there.

To be honest, I think if you just stay true to yourself, that's all the 
underground you need to be. Might I suggest that being 'ug' is a way of 
thought and not of speech? Who cares if someone thinks I am not 'ug' - 
that's shallow and it surely doesn't dictate which events I go to, or what 
music I spin, or what clothers I buy.

If a track was so 'ug' that no one got to enjoy it, what good is that?

Considering this list is to be a haven for people who like to discuss EDM 
and related events, *sometimes* political happenings, Life Changes, etc. I 
feel that everyone is spending a little too much time on labeling what is 
and what it not.

Is Sfraves 'ug'?
Am I?
Are you?

Fine then, I agree-

Tho by the initial BSP/Statement, it was correct.

That track, almost certainly, was in fact
"underground" prior to Tim hearing it on Hot 97.7

Argue all you want about what happens the instant
something is heard on the radio, but the track most
certainly "was" underground at some point.

Choke on that logic boy!

What about those artists that stay at the fringe. There are some that
sell out their art so that they can afford rent and then to be able to
fund their less mainstream work.

----------------------
--> what about them?
----------------------

Almost every artist I know does this -- thereby destroying your concept
of Black and White theories, cheese.

--------------------------
--> no it doesn't.... if STIMULANT DJ's gets alot of play on the airwaves
then STIMULANT DJ's would not be considered underground... but that does not
mean that BRISK and HAM, the people that make up Stimulant Djs, are
mainstream.... unless the tracks they have produced under those names (brisk
and ham) have been shown as much play over the airwaves also....

what should really matter is is it good or not, not if it's underground or
not.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] 2 BAD MICE - FRIDAY! / Aug. 29th / 5 STAR FUNK

all i was trying to say was....

how could 2 BAD MICE be considered "ug" if a 5th grader in 1993 heard the
track Bomb Scare played (or should i say PLAYED THE FUCK OUT!) from a
mainstream radio station? i mean think about - a fifth grader in 1993
listening to HOT97.7 listening to Bomb Scare by 2 Bad Mice.... dont get me
wrong, that track is sick! i love that track! but the fact that i heard it
from a mainstream radio station NUMEROUS times when i was only 12 should
show for something! i really dont see how that could be considered "ug"....

you have total permission to be happy, even if no one else is. there is nothing wrong with feeling good in the midst of what is supposed to be bad. if someone tries to convince you otherwise, there is nothing you can do about it. your feelings have a lot to do with a lot of things. if you are just beaming with delight, and no one else is, is that a crime? sometimes, people will try to punish you for it, i suppose. i don't really like to go down those roads. i'd rather just play. :)

Subject: RE: [sfraves] 2 BAD MICE - FRIDAY! / Aug. 29th / 5 STAR FUNK

who cares if it's 'underground' 99.9% of the people I have ever run into
only argue that something is or isn't underground based on popularity, are
social climbers, who don't really care about the music. I listened to a lot
of stuff on the radio as a child, that got me caring about music. is it bad
that it was on the radio? no. it was a very good thing, it got me interested
in the music. I'm sure the people making the music aren't fond of starving,
and don't mind getting a little airplay/fame to make enough cash to
eat/live.

do you think you'd be listening to the stuff you listen to now if you hadn't
heard what you heard on the radio in 1993?


Peace,
Beckka

all tracks are underground at one point in time..... for most tracks they
give up the "underground" term once the producer has released them.....or
shortly there after....

by that logic then, nothing anyone will ever hear is underground, unless
they work in the music industry.

your missing the point Beckka..... what you hear on the radio is NOT
underground.... i am not saying that "non underground" music sucks, i am not
saying that "underground music" is superior to all others... i am not even
commenting on the quality of the music....

all i am saying is that the tracks you here on a mainstream radio station
cannot be considered "underground".... if that offends certain people
because "they are no longer listening to the cutting edge underground
shizat!" then i am sorry.... something being "ug" or not should have no
bearing on whether or not it is good.... it being good/bad is completely
different to being underground.... so dont think i am attacking the quality
of the music, because i am not... i am only stating that this so called
"underground" group/artist/producer/whateverthefuckyouwanttocallit is not as
underground as you may think....

my point was. who cares if it's underground or not. it's one more label
music doesn't need.

a useless label people apply to music to make themselves seem so much cooler
then someone who doesn't know every new piece of music out there. (not just
with electronic music either, there's a punk underground, there's a metal
underground, a rap underground.)

Since I don't know you well enough to tell if you were being sincere or
not..

if you truly mean you agree with me, then why do you care if something is
labeled underground? you cant stop idiots from trying to make themselves
look good.

if you were being sarcastic,  which if you are, then your just one of the
social climbing afore mentioned people.

Peace,
Beckka

ok tim you always like to "Correct" people when they are wrong so im going 
to "Correct" you..

hott 97.7 is not Pre 94.9, 94.9 use to be 107.7 which predates hott 97.7

But they are all most likely owned by clear channel. So who cares!  :p~

Actually Becky, Underground is a term coined by the music industry to music
that is not popular or has no appeal to the masses. The term underground was
commonly given to smaller record labels, like most of the punk in the 80's.
When I think of something that is underground I think of a small label (like
the one Chris Jackson runs) that doesn't have much promotion and well never
be something lots of people will ever enjoy.

Hot 97.7 was gone before they switched to 94.9. And if I'm wrong 97.7 was
gone within a few months following the switch to 94.9

Subject: Re: [sfraves] 2 BAD MICE - FRIDAY! / Aug. 29th / 5 STAR FUNK

Mac, nothing that i said was incorrect.... if you re-read what i said you
will see that i said that HOT97 was PRE-949 not PRE-KYLD (i believe KYLD is
their call letters but i may be incorrect on that one) and not PRE-1077...

wrong.

It's a method of classification, and therefore not useless.  I've met a 
rapper named Swiss.  He isn't signed.  He isn't big.  He's certainly not on 
mainstream radio.  It is underground rap music.  I'm not telling you this 
to make me look good, I'm hoping you'll realize I speak the truth.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] 2 BAD MICE - FRIDAY! / Aug. 29th / 5 STAR FUNK

how can I be wrong on my views on something? if you scroll down, you'll see
that I was asked what underground meant to me. That is what I think of when
I hear someone say some form of music is underground. I've met tons of
unsigned, not big, not on any radio, let alone mainstream radio, musicians,
but I refrain from calling them underground because that isn't what they are
trying to be. Infect they get rather annoyed when you call them that. Maybe
it's a thing from back east since I am have only been in cali for a month or
so, and the west coast for a few years prior to that.

Your Definition below may be what underground means to you, I wont tell you
that your views on a label are wrong, everyone is entitled to their own
views. so please have a little respect, and don't tell me my views are wrong
because they don't match with yours.


Peace,
Beckka

A couple rules we try to live by here:
* Do not send regional club mailings for out of state clubs to SFRaves.
* Do not crosspost (address to multiple lists in a single mailing).
* Please use a [bsp] in the subject when using the list for advertisement.
* Include pertinent info in the mailing itself (for example, a club
without an address is a pain in the ass)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] does anybody know...

 The Wu is too slammin for these Cold Killin labels
Some ain't had hits since I seen Aunt Mabel
Be doin artists in like Cain did Abel
Now they money's gettin stuck to the gum under the table
That's what ya get when ya misuse what I invent
Your empire falls and ya lose every cent
For tryin to blow up a scrub
Now that thought was just as bright as a 20-watt light bulb
Should of pumped it when I rocked it
Niggaz so stingy they got short arms and deep pockets
This goes on in some companies
With majors they're scared to death to pump these
First of all, who's your A&R
A mountain climber who plays an electric guitar
But he don't know the meaning of dope
When he's lookin for a suit and tie rap
that's cleaner than a bar of soap
And I'm the dirtiest thing in sight
Matter of fact bring out the girls and let's have a mud fight

"Security is mostly a superstition.  It does not exist in nature, nor do 
the children of humans as a whole experience it.  Avoiding danger is no 
safer in the long run than outright exposure.  Life is either a daring 
adventure or nothing."
-Helen Keller

"Compassion is not a relationship between the healer and the wounded.  It's 
a relationship between equals.  Only when we know our own darkness well can 
we be present with the darkness of others.  Compassion becomes real when we

Subject: RE: [sfraves] 2 BAD MICE - FRIDAY! / Aug. 29th / 5 STAR FUNK

why is that dumb? no one person can categorize music for the rest of the
world. Even the music industry has failed to do that.

so since you think my answer was dumb (not that I care what you think, just
responding to this thread because I was bored yesterday) What does
underground mean to you? How do you define it, and the music it
theoretically covers? keep in mind, this isn't limited to one genre of music
either since it's pretty much been agreed on that other forms of music have
their so called 'underground' music as well.

Peace,
Beckka

Part of language is accepted definitions for words.  We have compiled lists 
of meanings into books, called Dictionaries.  While you can choose to 
define a word in a different manner than what's commonly accepted, I 
wouldn't expect people to understand you.  You think I'm talking about 
underground?  How about infect?

i entered a building recently where the sound was so unusually still, and the pressure from above felt so intensely heavy, even though i appeared to be on the ground level for all i knew, that i am coming to believe that there is something going on with our placement in the universe, and with that thought in mind, i am also convinced that the weirdness that people attribute to simple things, because they do not understand what it is to be organic in the midst of an inorganic environment (hmmm, whatever, huh?...beware, for all you know, your neighbor thinks your barbie too)...uhhh, oh my point...my point is that we live on earth and so there will always be earthly things going on regardless of what your plans might have been or what they are. :)

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Another brain exerciser...

I believe spirituality is all around us and has been a part of the scene
since day one. I think people now are just trying to capitalize on it.
And there are so many ways of being spiritual that it is impossible not
to be spiritual in some way. It is like the game of pick up lines where
even when you have no pick up line that is your line. Peace

My understanding is the archive was intentionally made difficult to search
so law enforcement and others couldn't use them very effectively for their
purposes.

Spirituality is Life.  Being alive is being Spiritual.  Whether one chooses to minimize it or ignore it is their own choice.  If one breathes Oxygen then one is spiritual.

That may be too simple for some.

--=====================_18388743==.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

RAVE ACT II

In the fight to repeal the RAVE Act we have come up against another piece 
of anti-rave legislation. If made into law, this latest attack on our civil 
liberties would open more doors for the prosecution of innocent business 
owners unable to stop drugs coming into their venue. Thousands of our 
supporters have already faxed their representatives about what we are 
calling the RAVE Act II (officially known as the Ecstasy Awareness Act) and 
groups across the country, like EM:DEF and ROAR, are mobilizing voters 
against the bill.

If you haven't faxed your Representative about the Ecstasy Awareness Act, 
please do so at: http://actioncenter.drugpolicy.org/ctt.asp?u=488&l=4336

We also need you to fax your Representative about the CLEAN-UP Act if you 
haven't already. http://actioncenter.drugpolicy.org/ctt.asp?u=488&l=4337

For more on what you can do to stop threats to hip hop and electronic music 
see: http://actioncenter.drugpolicy.org/ctt.asp?u=488&l=4338


SEPTEMBER 6TH PROTEST AGAINST THE RAVE ACT

Thousands will gather at the Capitol in Washington, DC on September 6th for 
a musical protest against the RAVE Act and the continuing assault on dance 
culture. The event, sponsored by ROAR!: The National Dance and Music Rights 
Alliance, will feature Junior Vasquez, D:Fuse, booths, prizes, and much, 
much more.

Dance for your rights. U.S. Capitol, Washington DC. 1pm onwards.  For more 
information on the protest including directions see:

http://actioncenter.drugpolicy.org/ctt.asp?u=488&l=4339


Tour Buses are being arranged from numerous cities. Please email 
info@roargroup.org for all general inquiries.

"Security is mostly a superstition.  It does not exist in nature, nor do 
the children of humans as a whole experience it.  Avoiding danger is no 
safer in the long run than outright exposure.  Life is either a daring 
adventure or nothing."
-Helen Keller

"Compassion is not a relationship between the healer and the wounded.  It's 
a relationship between equals.  Only when we know our own darkness well can 
we be present with the darkness of others.  Compassion becomes real when we 
recognize our shared humanity."
-Pema Chodron

"It's taken me all my life to learn what not to play."

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Another brain exerciser...

spirituality is whatever creates meanning for you consciously, or 
subconsciously.
raves vs. spirituality- of course it is spiritual.  Are you learning things 
if you are under the influence or not, yes.  Wether you want to or not your 
body is ALWAYS computing, gathering information, processing and then 
creating into meaning.  Information is meaning. learning=growth, 
growth=expansion=spirituality=knowing or not=death is 
spirituality=everything is spirituality because EVERYTHING HAS MEANING.
Due to "free will of the soul" we can decide for ourselves what we want to 
use it for/do with it/do/or be. I can even say to myself "Hey I think I know 
spirituality."
I can take a step back or four steps forward, stop, look around, take a big, 
deep breath and say
"I am alive!!!!"
Blessings to all!
Danny

True, plus also the pain-in-the-ass archive method makes it
that-much-harder for spammers to data-mine your addresses.

That...and I bet some of you wouldn't like certain back-in-the-day
posts to be google-able, if you know what I mean ;-)

  WHAT IS SPIRITUALITY?

  Spirituality is learning to connect to what is real, not how we like things to be, like seeing life without "rose colored glasses".

  Spitituality is finding what is natural, not only in the world, but what is natural for you, i.e. being gay/straight, being an artist, writer, computer nerd, school teacher, a/b personality, etc.
  
  Spiritual practice is connecting to what is natural

  Sprituality is NOT religion. What is the difference?
Sprituality = freedom to be you (natural)
Religion = some authority telling you how to be you (dogma)

Spiritual people tend to be attracted to nature
Religious people tend to be attracred to a orginization or a dogma

Spiritual people tend to want to be in natural places
Religious people tend to want to go to church and get dogmaticly reinforced

Spiritual people see divinity in all people
Religious people see divinity only in those who believe in their dogma

  DOES SPIRITUALITY BELONG IN RAVES?

  Without spirituality, raves would be like color without color. Spirituality is the soul (life energy)of raves. Bodies show up at raves, spirituality adds life.

  Everyone and everything is spiritual, dogma is the vampire of the soul.

 Peace, Bodhi ^ _ ^

listen to thump radio on alice 97.3 on saturday nights, i'd like your
opinion about the following.

9p-12a -- not underground.
12a-1a -- rides the line (depending on week, and the DJ)
1a-2a -- is pretty damn underground for major FM radio in america.

i mean it isn't psytrance or happycore or hard breaks, but it gets
there...thoughts?

Spirituality --

A monk asked Isan, "What is the Tao?"
"Mindlessness is the Tao,"  Isan replied.
"I don't comprehend," the monk said.
"All you need do is to apprehend the one who does not comprehend."
"Who is the one who does not comprehend?" the monk said.
"None other than yourself," replied Isan.

Does it have a place in raves, or on the dancefloor?  Spirituality is the 
essence of the dance experience or, as Frankie Knuckles said:

"From my particular end of it, it's like church.  Because when you've got 
three thousand people in front of you, that's three thousand different 
personalities.  And when those three thousand personalities become one 
personality, it's the most amazing thing."

Much love,

"Security is mostly a superstition.  It does not exist in nature, nor do 
the children of humans as a whole experience it.  Avoiding danger is no 
safer in the long run than outright exposure.  Life is either a daring 
adventure or nothing."

"Compassion is not a relationship between the healer and the wounded.  It's 
a relationship between equals.  Only when we know our own darkness well can 
we be present with the darkness of others.  Compassion becomes real when we 
recognize our shared humanity."

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Another brain exerciser...

> Religious people see divinity only in those who
> believe in their dogma


er-i bed to differ.  first of all, i don't just 'see'
divinity, i feel it, that's how i know about it.  i
feel it in many different places, most intensely,
however, when i'm connecting to music, whether that be
inside church or outside of it..in  my room or at a
rave, trancing out in blissful delight.  when it comes
to 'seeing' divinity, in a smile from a friend, in a
selfless act of kindness from a stranger, or from an
amazing performance of music or art, i feel it, and
know it is there, whether or not i have any knowledge
of the other person's faith. 

i connect with divinity as much in a church as i do by
the ocean, in the forest, or at a good rave, many
religious people take their faith with them, if they
believe God created this world to some extent, it is
His home too, and therefore the ocean is as much His
home, if not more so, than a manmade church.  

please, if you are not religious, please do not try to
speak on our behalf, or tell others what we apparently
like or dislike are open to or are closed to.

most of my friends are not religious, but we connect
on amazing levels of spirituality and friendship (the
two are intertwined i believe) ..precisely because we
both connect to divinity through realizing the beauty
of certain places or entities (music) or people.we
share thoughts on learning about ourselves and the
world and our connections to the cosmos at large. 

there are also many 'religious' who respect and
respond to the wisdom poured forth from a variety of
sources, including ghandi, the dalai lama, and mother
theresa, and other spiritual leaders, and incorporate
their teachings into their lives...there is not
necessarily one 'dogma,' that even the most religious
people believe in.  

if these comments are due to your experience with
other 'religious' people, i am very sorry for you and
them, that neither of you had better, more fruitful,
more open experiences.

lastly,


"Spiritual people see divinity in all people"
let me explain one more thing: many Christians believe
that God formed man, "in His image," meaning in the
image of God.  therefore, every human being is a
reflection of the glory of God.  millions of people
believe in the divinity of every human being, EVERY
human being, and the dignity of that human being, from
the start of life to the end.  again, in EVERY human
being, regardless of background, regardless of faith,
because like God, man has an immortal entity attached,
that being the sol.  for some, this 'dogma,' as you
call it, reminds them that all men are created equal,
and all are equal under God's eyes.  

if you do not like the idea of human beings needing
this 'reminder' via dogma, i can understand that. we
shouldn't need a 'reminder,' we should just know,
feel, realize that we are all one, we are all together
in this life, but some people need a reminder.  if
this reminder does in fact bring them closer to other
humans, closer to themselves, and closer in their
connection to all of creation, i do not understand how
you could say that 'dogma' is a vampire.  spiritual
people are not the only people who see divinity in all
people.

i do not claim to know your spirituality because you
are not of my faith.  i do not lump 'nonreligious'
together and set them aside from me. i would
appreciate not getting lumped into a category of
'religious' and then having someone else place
definitions on said 'religious' because i believe in
some things of what you would call 'dogma.' as every
human being is different, so we all have different
spiritualities, different ways of realizing divinity
and coming closer to one another and ourselves, and as
such i would never presume to know someone else's
world view simply based on whether they followed
'dogma' or not. we are all one, we are all part of the
divinity that has been running through us since
creation.

please, let us try to understand each other (religious
and non-religoius), instead of claiming to know what
the other believes.  

peace,
lauren

It sounds as if you are both religious and spiritual.

Subject: [sfraves] More on Archives

Today's inquiry prompted me to pull out a random month of SFR archives
(3-96) to read, and wow, what a crazy trip through memory lane.

If anyone is having difficulty pulling out the archives, just ask me, or
anyone on this list. Essentially, they are sorted by month and year, and
gzipped into single files that most computers should have no problem
downloading and un-zipping. What you are left with is a huge text file
which requires a text editor, bbedit, notepad, etc. (dunnno I use bbedit)
to search through or just scroll. Of course you could also grep them as well.

It's really crazy: the general attitude (we can do ANYTHING), newness of
it all, and yeah...even talk of what undergound *is* is what what is
considered old-school and how things aren't what they used to be. The "in"
ASCII sigs were cool too.

Even stranger (for me at least), is as I scroll the posts I see people
whom are still part of the scene today, and people who've become valued
lifetime friends. Cool stuff.

I think around that time was when I met Philip X Diaz (Euphonic Genesis
;-), Danny Picard, Troy Sheets, JOnas, and a few other current listers
that are active today.

Thank goodness I used a screenname in my early, naive years. What a corny
dumb-ass terry was ;-)

I think the reason why raves are spritiual is because raves involve dancing 
and dancing is spritual. Also raves involve music and music is spiritual. Not 
only that but it's the kind of music and the kind of dancing you see at raves. 
I mean whenever you see someone having some kind of spirutal experience on a 
movie... don't they always play like trippy atmospheric music that reminds you 
of a rave? doesn't the expression on their face remind you of someone dancing 
at a rave? hmmm

and the lighting is spriitual as well. for example take the lord of the rings 
two towers... when gandolf explains how we almost died while fighting the 
demon dragon thing is shows the whole process where he almost dies and transforms 
from gandolf the grey into gandolf the white... durring the process you see 
lots of flashing floresent psychodelic lighting... just like at a rave! 
in conclusion i think the lighting also induces a spiritual experience and we 
are too perhaps transforming our grey matter into white.

And also the BPM's induce spirtuality which has been known for a long time by 
achient tribes around the world.


So now we have #1 Dancing #2 Atmospheric and electronic music # 3 Pyschodelic 
and cosmic-like lighting # 4 Tribal-like BPM's this combined wiht the 
excitement of a mass social gathering and an influence of shamanistic drug use... it 
would be insane to say that spiriutality doesn't have a place at raves

and it's not like spirituality is a part of raves because spirtuality is a 
part of eveyrthign like someone was saying... there's a big huge difference 
there's a peak and explosion of spirituality at raves where at spirituality is 
subtle in every day life.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Another brain exerciser...

I wouldn't be so quick to put down organized religion as a whole. Lets not
forget that a ot of the philosophies you are talking about are Buddhist and
stem from an organized religion.. Dogma is a guide line, a kind of map of
your path. and it's true, some can just wonder aimlessly into the redwoods
naked and smiling and find "spirituality" but others enjoy following a map.
My belief, however, is that they both lead to the same place.

Spirituality to me is believing that there is something beyond
individuality, that things are invisibly connected somehow.

as far as raves are concerned, raves do model shamanistic ritual, and ritual
dancing festivals. Raves gather a lot of energy in one place, but the energy
usually just bounces around feeding of its self and never put to any good
use.

Peace,
Mystic

Does the term "old school" mean that we may have canals in our brains large 
enough to have large cargo barges of information/wisdom/ and sarcasm to be

Hahah.. this is turning out to be like last year. EVERYBODY left SF so 
the town was nice and empty. Was able to go biking up and down the 
hills without fear of getting wiped out by a bus.  Of course, the 
friends I was hanging w/ last year are all out of town this time 
around. Punk asses.  Beach party anyone?

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii


Check it out - This Sunday will be the last edition of Detroit while we take a hiatus of unknown length. It has been a rich experience - a chance to contemplate and savor the sounds of a city and the soul of a place - which of course, is its culture and people. (Sniff sniff!) We'll be back, for sure, but for now, its time for a break!

SO- THIS SUNDAY - Please join DJs Baby Daddy, 12 Mile, Domingo Yu and Bartenders Peter Lakis and Scott Campbell as we mix up a whole lot of good vibes. 

AND, for the first time the Woodward Posse will be in full force! "Silent" partner Domingo Yu has DJ'ed around the D and the world and represents equally well as a hip hop and techno selecta. He's shared the stage with acts ranging from Eminem to DJ T-1000, Xzibit to Derrick May. 

Bringing the rock factor, DJ "12 Mile" aka Brian Stein will send the weak-hearted running and reward "those who know" with his mix of Detroit Rock City and Motown classics. 

Wrapping things up with a shiny bow is DJ Baby Daddy - you know 'em, ya love 'em, and you know he's gonna play "Sandwiches" so what else really needs to be said??! ;)

Detroit is free, and starts at 9 this Sunday night at the Skylark, 3089 16st., San Francisco. 

Thanks - The Woodward Posse

Life should be like a shitty beer commercial. A spontaneous party

For cryin out loud my style is wild so book me
Not long is how long that this rhyme took me
Ejectin, styles from my lethal weapon
My pen that rocks from here to Oregon
Here's Mordigan, catch it like a psycho flashback
I love gats, if rap was a gun, you wouldn't bust back
I come with shit that's all types of shapes and sounds
And where I lounge is my stompin grounds
I give a order to my peeps across the water
To go and snatch up props all around the border
And get far like a shootin star
Cause who I are, is dim in the light of Pablo Escobar
Point blank as I kick the square biz
There it is you're fuckin with pros and there it goes

told sarilion already... i have power monitors if it's
a secure as fort knox location... i'm borrowing brians
for a show at my work (www.epicarts.org) so i can't
use them if the location isn't perfect.  that, and the
show here goes until 2am.

if someone can bring tables over here we can have a
MELLOW party here.  our new neighbor is already being
a hassle.  maybe a downtempo/ambient party with movies
or something... i think i have a projector here too...

Subject: [sfraves] :CODE WAS SOOOOOO DOPE!!!!! HELLO 2DAY!

OK... WOW... the night was soooo Dope!!!  I mean... ok... so I went 2 the City like right after work 'cause I did wanna check out that Sister Thing @ Wish on Folsum... I mean.. I realy went 'cause I wanted 2 C Seraphim 'cause I miss that girl sooo much!  She wasn't spinning, but I hung out w/ Queen Agness (sp) B 4 a bit!!  Oh yeah... while I was walkin' 2 Wish... I bumped in2 Audio El from Cybrid along the way there... LoL... He So Dope!  Then I went 2 visit Happy Kid Marty @ his work & we hung out 4 like a few minutes!!  It was Dope!!  His hair is like sooo short now!!  Hello 2Day!!  Then I went in Butter 4 a quick minute & said what up 2 Big J the bartender =)

So since things well it was like only 7:30, so I said fuck it... I went 2 DNA 2 watch them set up!!  I mean... might as well go all the way, right?!   I mean... set up was kinda Groovy 'cause I liked how they were setting up the stage w/ all them live acts!!  Wow!!!  Oh gosh... I Loved it when they did sound check.. so much Lovely Noise playing!!!  So I went & helped out Kara a lil' who was hangin' her art...It was Dope!  DJM & Leslie came by 2 help... 

OK... I really have 2 say that Dusty Brown is sooooooooo fuckin Awesome!!!  Oh mY gosh man... he opened & it was like all this Ambienty stuff w/ small lil jungle ummm chords, thrills, chimes whatever like running all throughout the ambiant stuff that was goin on... I Loved It!!  OK... then he busted out w. this Awesome Fuckin' Jungle & man... the live shit he was doin totally jus' ooh man... it was Orgasmic!  There was even a part where he went down tempo-ie for a while, but lifted it back & got in2 some hard Jungle that jus' fucked me up!!  I mean... it was all crazy ass basslines & all these dope sounds all crazy & wow!!  1 of my favorite songs he did live was this, OK.. I think it was his live set, when he busted out a rock song, but to a jungle beat w/ all these guitars playing!!!

But I guess towards the end of his live set... DJM, Kara, Leslie, & I went out 2 get dinner!  Yum!!  Thanks DJ M 4 getting me 4 dinner =)

Anywaze, we got back like probably an hour later or something like that & grrrrr... missed Amber spinning w/ that live drummer & I felt like sooo bad about that!

***Wed. 9/24/03 Selekta.com-Progressive Soul w/guest Paul Lancaster***


PAUL LANCASTER-uk. (Sabotage Systems, Climax Recordings, CP Recordings )

Born and raised in Newcastle Upon Tyne, England - 26yr old DJ and producer
Paul Lancaster was first introduced to the sounds of acid house and techno
by local pirate radio station Wear FM in the early 90s.

Inspired by the DJ mix tapes of Carl Cox that he heard at school, Paul
quickly embraced the local underground rave scene and began honing his own
mixing skills with the techno and breakbeat he discovered at Bass Generator
Records and the deep house grooves of Trax (now Flying Records) in
Newcastle.

Following a move to Leeds, Paul drew further influence from the diverse
mixture of funky vocal house and US garage at club nights such as Up Yer
Ronson, Back 2 Basics and Hard Times along with the techno and breakbeat of
the Orbit and Warehouse. After a short spell DJing for fashion shows and
promoting his own club nights in Leeds, Paul returned to Newcastle with a
new found confidence as a DJ and a burning desire to break through as a
producer in his own right.

Over the next few years Paul took his first tentative steps towards
production, remixing a number of house classics for his own DJ use and his
first full production in the form of debut single 'Bad Girl' that was
quickly signed to local house label Climax Recordings in Newcastle.

Following the international success of 'Bad Girl' and 'The Gringo Trail' for
Climax, 'Don't Stop Burning' was soon signed by Cass to Sabotage Systems for
release in March 2003 and is currently featured on the Sabotage compilation
album '8 - Live @ Centro360' mixed by Cass.

Paul continues to work as A&R manager, DJ and resident producer for Climax
Recordings in the UK with a number of his productions and remixes set for
release on various labels throughout the year. His latest single 'Night
Vision' has enjoyed big support already from the likes of Danny Howells,
Hernan Cattaneo, James Zabiela, Randall Jones and Mark Pappas of Tigerhook
Corporation plus a whole host of select DJs from across the world.

Paul is also the resident DJ and promoter of the Fragile club nights in
Newcastle and with an eclectic mix of musical styles, recent productions
have found strong support with some of the worlds best DJs whilst his own
reputation as an accomplished DJ mixing the very best in house, tribal,
tech-house and breaks continues to grow far and wide.

DJ support from John Digweed, Sander Kleinenberg, Danny Howells, Cass, James
Zabiela, Hernan Cattaneo and many more.

i think you make some good points...here is another one of mine: some people need to believe in science as a means of reaching enlightenment. they will give you rational explainations for everything to refute any sort of attribution to something that is unseen. nonetheless, these people also participate in what i consider to be attempts at spiritual union with others, either that, or my rational is that they are just a bunch of control freaks in bed who could be easily swayed to the dark side. amen, halleluiah! sing on, brothers and sisters! some believe that everything, whether it be spiritually, scientifically or financially motivated comes down the sex of it all...the act and the gender...i think that procreation is most obviously the most intregal part of our ability to spiritualize, because without it, there'd be no one visible to the naked eye, and hence no science or money either, but wow, do you realize that without science there'd be no money. even if you don't believe in
 science, you need if and then to get your cash, so basically, if god doesn't fuck you, then someone else will. no offense intended at all. just showing off as usual on your time. my time to, but if i neglect to mention myself, others might feel spiritually superior at least temporarily until they talk themselves back down to the cold, hard earth. :)much love and gratitude for the opportunity to speak my mind. :) :)

WHAT IS SPIRITUALITY?

Spirituality is learning to connect to what is real, not how we like things to be, like seeing life without "rose colored glasses".

Spitituality is finding what is natural, not only in the world, but what is natural for you, i.e. being gay/straight, being an artist, writer, computer nerd, school teacher, a/b personality, etc.

Spiritual practice is connecting to what is natural

Sprituality is NOT religion. What is the difference?
Sprituality = freedom to be you (natural)
Religion = some authority telling you how to be you (dogma)

Spiritual people tend to be attracted to nature
Religious people tend to be attracred to a orginization or a dogma

Spiritual people tend to want to be in natural places
Religious people tend to want to go to church and get dogmaticly reinforced

Spiritual people see divinity in all people
Religious people see divinity only in those who believe in their dogma

DOES SPIRITUALITY BELONG IN RAVES?

Without spirituality, raves would be like color without color. Spirituality is the soul (life energy)of raves. Bodies show up at raves, spirituality adds life.

Everyone and everything is spiritual, dogma is the vampire of the soul.

Peace, Bodhi ^ _ ^

Subject: [sfraves] House of Legends 4.0 at Club 6

--=====================_25680664==.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

I had been looking forward to Club 6's "House of Legends 4.0" event for 
weeks.  Hell, just about any event at Club 6 these days is a guaranteed 
good evening for me:  friendly staff;  free and non-judgmental space; 
underground vibe; and an eclectic, respectful dance crowd.  Further, they 
throw some fine house music parties.  Last night's "Legends 4.0" was one of 
those rare "in the zone" evenings for me.

We arrived during David Coleman and Sen-Sei's set.  Those two are 
consistently energizing performers and they got my groove going.

Jesse Saunders, the "originator" of house music followed.  I've had 
ambivalent feelings about Jesse since back in the day.  But next year marks 
the 20th anniversary of the release of the first house recording, his "On 
and On." That was the beginning of a life-long passion for many of us, so I 
give him his due.  It turns me off, though, when he begins his sets these 
days with his "...here is the originator of house music" promo, as if we 
all didn't know.  Such BSP.  And I didn't really expect that much from his 
set.  Jesse was never a great DJ or, for that matter, producer.

I thought the first half-hour or so of his performance was programmed and 
uninventive, but the crowd felt otherwise.  This was not the old school 
house head group I've danced with over the years.  As one of the few 
old-timers there said to me:  "I don't know any of these 
kids."  Excellent.  A genre dies without new lovers, and these people who 
had never heard most of this old school music  were jacking their bodies 
like house's first lovers two decades ago.

My main reason for coming to this party, however,  was to hear DJ Pierre.

DJ Pierre -- Nathaniel Jones is his given name -- is right up there with 
Larry Levan, Marshall Jefferson, Adonis and the like:  genuinely awesome 
innovators who laid the foundation for house and electronic dance music.  I 
worship the man.  While tripping on acid back in eighties Chicago he and 
some friends invented acid house while tweaking with a Roland TB303.  Acid 
house was the genre that set fire to the rave movement in the UK and then 
the states in the late eighties.

If I was given a choice of the DJs I would be willing to dance to for an 
eternity on that big dance floor in the sky, it would be Larry Levan and DJ 
Pierre.  Larry, though, is forever frozen in time in my soul.  Pierre has 
evolved over time, and has been a symbol for many in the house community 
for the radical, progressive soul of house music.

When Pierre moved to NYC he took acid house even further, creating a sound 
that wedded funky brass and vocals to Chicago acid:  wild-pitch.

In addition to being a prolific and paradigm-busting producer, DJ Pierre is 
also a very competent DJ.  His set last night was truly amazing.  I was so 
overcome with respect and emotion when I went up behind the decks to greet 
him, that I took his hand and kissed it.  A bit over the top, I know.  But 
it was genuine and spontaneous.  And there I stayed for most of his set, 
right behind the decks,  dancing joyfully, in perfect harmony with the 
universe, totally happy.  One cherishes times like these.  Doesn't get much 
better....

Vince Lawrence didn't show, for whatever reason, so Jesse took over the 
decks after Pierre's extended set.  Jesse was wonderful.  Perhaps this was 
unanticipated and unprogrammed, or maybe it was the vibe.  Whatever, he 
threw down some of the sweetest house with some very old school favorites 
and kept us all on the floor.  When the lights went up at four Jesse kept 
on going, as did the dancers.  The crew were taking down the monitors, but 
the management put them back up and he continued spinning for an extra half 
hour.  The house is in his heart and he showed it.  Respect.

Love,

Apollo

Subject: Re: [sfraves] House of Legends 4.0 at Club 6

Unfortunately I didn't attend this event because of false advertising on the
Club Six email list.  The party was listed as $10 after 11pm, and they were
charging $15.  I'm sick of the bullshit I've been dealing with at clubs
recently, including:  All night guestlists switched to "before 11"
guestlists without notice on the night of the event, promoters who confirm
that you're on the guestlist but don't put you on, flyers and email lists
with no pricing information, flyers and email lists with false pricing
information, and on and on.  The older I get, the more I realize that
promoters who have their shit together in this scene are the exception
rather than the rule.  I didn't attend the event because I refuse to be
suckered into going to a night and then have the price jacked up on me.

Tonight it's off to see Derrick Carter at Sno-Drift: last time I went there
to see him the speakers on the right side of the room were shorting on and
off the whole night and I had a number of friends on the guestlist who
didn't get in.  It's unfortunate the underground rarely pulls any out of
town house names with any talent, so it's off to fluffy money land once
again...

I downloaded and printed the flier from Club 6's website 
--   www.clubsix1.com  --and it clearly states on both sides that the cost 
is $10.00 before 11 PM.

Personally, I don't go to many clubs these days because I don't like being 
treated as a criminal, both at the door and inside.  It's either ug parties 
these days or Club 6, where I am treated with respect.

We are also on the guest list at the Sno-Drift tonight, but after our last 
experience at Sno-Drift I'm going to pass.  Six of us were on 12 Monkeys 
guest list for Derrick Carter the last time he performed there.  When we 
got to the venue we were treated with much disrespect.  No guest list could 
be found with our names on it.  Now, I rarely accept "guest list" 
privileges for my own reasons.  But I was much troubled that my friends' 
evening was destroyed.  I gave 12 Monkeys a lashing both privately and 
publicly.  Then I discovered after asking around in the community that it 
was not the promoter here, but the management of Sno-Drift that were to 
blame.  Seems they regularly "lose" the promoter's guest list and push 
those on such lists to buy at the door with the promise (never kept) that 
somehow this can all be corrected at the end of the evening.

Screw me once, it's your karma;  twice and I'm the fool.

My own feeling is that promoters and club managers should experience their 
parties and venues as paying guests at least once a month (and I don't care 
if one has to go in disguise).  How do you feel to be patted down;  screwed 
out of money at the door;  have your drinks taken before you're 
finished;  have security flash lights in your eyes in the venue;      be 
packed into a room with 800 peeps when only 500 can fit comfortably;  stand 
in the rain for an hour to get in (?)....and so on.

Love,

Apollo
