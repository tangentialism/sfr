SF Team Tibet ~ Board of Supervisors Meeting April 1st


http://sanfrancisco.tribe.net/event/1d8ebfe2-97da-491d-bc12-75ca9ecd803c

Date & Time: 2008-04-01 12:00 PM
Location: San Francisco City Hall  Room 250


Tibet Resolution Comes before the full San Francisco Board of
Supervisors on April 1.  Act now!

On March 27, 2008, Chris Daly's committee of the San Francisco Board
of Supervisors voted to approve the Resolution "Commending the Tibetan
Freedom Torch and the Human Rights Torch Relay."  The resolution is
highly critical of the Chinese government's human rights record in
Tibet, China, and the world.


Your call or email or online petition in the next 24 hours is critical!


1. Call or email each Supervisor individually, let them know you are a
Tibetan or a Tibet supporter, and ask  them to ?please support
Supervisor Chris Daly's Torch Resolution and please vote "no" to
Supervisor Carmen Chu's toothless torch resolution.? See contacts for
all supervisors below.


2. Send an online email petition to all the SF Supervisors, plus Mayor
Newsom, asking them to support the Tibetan human rights resolution:
http://www.ipetitions.com/petition/sft/


About the Tibetan Human Rights Resolution
This is a resolution commending the Tibetan Freedom Torch and the
Global Human Rights Torch Relay in their efforts to raise awareness
regarding human rights violations in China and urging the San
Francisco City Representatives accepting the Beijing 2008 Olympic
Torch to welcome the Torch in the explicit spirit of the Olympics,
consistent with the United Nations Charter established in this City,
and the United  Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
The resolution would guide city policy in the following areas:

RESOLVED, The San Francisco Board of Supervisors urges our federal
representatives to call for an international inquiry to investigate
these recent atrocities and urges the Chinese government to allow
independent media in Tibet ; and be it

FURTHER RESOLVED, That the Board of Supervisors urges Mayor Gavin Newsom
to express his concern regarding the recent human rights atrocities
in Tibet when he hosts the Beijing Olympics torch in the City on April
8 and 9 and to urge the government of the People's Republic of China
to genuinely comply with the principles of tolerance and respect as
symbolized by the spirit behind the Olympic games; and, be it

FURTHER RESOLVED, That the Board of Supervisors urges Mayor Newsom to
provide full access to Tibetans and other human rights advocates to
protest the passing of the Olympic torch in San Francisco, and not to
limit their movement to such areas as
"First Amendment Areas"; and be it

FURTHER RESOLVED, That the Board of Supervisors urges the Olympic
Committee to boycott the Beijing 2008 Olympics Opening Ceremony if
there is no cessation of violence from Chinese security forces against
peaceful protestors and other critics of the Chinese government; and
be it

FURTHER RESOLVED, That the Board of Supervisors commend the efforts of
the Human Rights Torch Relay and the Tibetan Freedom Torch in raising
awareness about the human rights situation in China; and, be it

FURTHER RESOLVED,  That the San Francisco Board of Supervisors urges
the City's representative who will officially receive the 2008 Summer
Olympic Games Torch to welcome the Torch in the explicit spirit of
Olympism, consistent with the United Nations Charter established in
this City, and the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human
Rights; be it

FURTHER RESOLVED,  That the Board of Supervisors urges the above City
Official to also make publicly known that the 2008 Summer Olympic
Games Torch is received with alarm and protest at the failure of China
to meet its past solemn promises to the international community,
including the citizens of San Francisco, to cease the egregious and
ongoing human rights abuses in China and  occupied Tibet.

FURTHER RESOLVED,  That the Board of Supervisors urges our
representatives in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives to
take an active role in supporting all efforts to stop human rights
violations in China and throughout the world.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Yo yo yo!

Mostly before my time despite my age, but I did go to one Wicked full moon at Boony Doon beach before I had even heard the term "rave"...

How many remember the nasty ass bathroom at the original DNA?  

How about Mondo 2000 magazine?

And BTW Brian B. played Saturday!

Peace,

Peter

Twenty-Hz... did you guys do the Let Your Backbone Slide video?   Anyways, I
didn't start til 1996, but my admiration for the people who helped make
those parties legendary still lives.  Now here's where I insert BSP:
Return 2 Acid... it's coming  June 27th,  mark your calendars for a night of
acid house, acid breaks, acid techno, and old school rave classics  :)

Your sense of nostalgia has some horrible triggers.  And for the record, 
the winner of nasty bathrooms was San Jose's the Cactus Club.  I took a 
coworker there one night cause his business trip to SF coincided with my 
club night there... and he ended up throwing away his shoes AND EXPENSING

them back up in his suitcase.

:( I miss that kind of press.  Genuinely weird shit!  UFOs, Genesis P. 
Orridge, entheogens and musings on unlocking the cybernetic potential!  
Of course our b-rave new world gave way to a reality that most could 
comfortably say fell short by most counts...

-&e->And BTW Brian B. played Saturday!

So did Chris Jackson, who played the Sharon parties under the name Darwin 
as a teenager.  I played as well, but I only date back to a noobish '96 DJ 
vintage.

Monty has long gone off list, but I know how to find him (he's still DJing 
and from time to time updates a great music blog).

We need to throw some shindig when Niels, JSL, Black Adder, Monty, 
LeslieA, BrianB, GeoffW and all the old eloquent SFR flame posse can throw 
down (to the onlookers, there was a time when there were like 15 people on 
SFR who could write for pages and pages without fatigue... good if you 
liked to read opinions from people you might not meet otherwise, bad if 
you had a slow connection).

McCAIN TO CAMPAIGN AT BURNING MAN

Phoenix, AZ -- Senator and presumptive Republican Presidential nominee 
John McCain has rocked the political world by announcing his intention to 
bring his campaign to Nevada's Black Rock Desert this summer, during the 
counter-cultural art event known as Burning Man. 

"While our opponents would callously ignore them, this proud American 
believes that even temporary cities deserve the attention of the President 
of the United States," said McCain senior staffer Mark Dosenberner. "We 
are proud that Black Rock City will be a stop on the 'Straight Talk 
Express' tour this summer."

mccainCiting the compatibility of the Burning Man festival's "American 
Dream" art theme with his campaign's message of a bigger, stronger, 
somewhat-taller America, McCain hopes to reach out to the thousands of 
"Burners" who gather in the desert for this 7-day celebration of radical 
self-expression, radical self-reliance, community and art. "I look forward 
to engaging with the good folks of Black Rock City, and showing them not 
just by my words, but through my actions that deep down, despite all our 
glaringly stark differences, we share the same American Dream. No, 
seriously," said McCain, "... what's so funny? Did I make a joke?"

The candidate's research team has been briefing the Senator on the ways of 
the Burning Man participant, ensuring that McCain, renowned for his 
ability to "cut loose", will not be perceived as a so-called "newbie" or 
"yahoo", which could shatter his chances of garnering votes at this famed 
desert bacchanalia. straight talk expressMcCain's transportation team is 
working with his AV crew to retrofit the Senator's "Straight Talk Express" 
bus to accommodate the largest state-of-the-art speaker stacks ever seen 
at Burning Man, and will be parking the bus on the 2:00 radial street with 
other sound camps. "We're putting in a set of Technics SL-1200 turntables 
on the roof, and recruiting the hottest international Republican DJ's to 
work the wheels of steel," said Dosenberner. "The Senator looks forward to 
personally making grilled cheese sandwiches for revelers 'rolling in' from 
surrounding raves each night, and maybe taking a turn on the decks himself 
... you should expect some slammin' big band favorites, should that 
happen."

"We're in this race to win," said McCain, a decorated war veteran, "and if 
it takes coming out to a place like Burning Man, and mixing with ... these 
... people ... to do it, well ... I figure I've been held captive in a 
North Vietnamese POW camp ... how bad could this really be?"

black rock desertMcCain's campaign will be sending an advance team to 
ensure all necessary security measures are in place prior to the Senator's 
arrival. The team will visit the playa in May to thoroughly scour the vast 
desert expanse, searching for potential security risks. "The playa may be 
flat, but it certainly isn't without its dangers ... Americans know full 
well that terrorists are after each and every one of us ... and don't be 
fooled: expansive, desolate places like the Black Rock Desert are as much 
a target as our homes, schools, churches, malls and SUV's. We must stay 
vigilant at all times," said Dosenberner. 

The Burning Man Project has been fully cooperating with the McCain 
campaign, ensuring that every possible security step will be taken to 
ensure the Senator's safety while in Black Rock City.  "Let's see ... I 
think we've got some caution tape around here somewhere," said Burning Man 
founder Larry Harvey.  "Oh yeah, here it is."

I think someone should absolutely feed the guy a heroic dose of mushrooms, paint him blue, and let him loose on the playa.

That is all.

Ok...maybe I should rephrase.

REPUBLI-NAZI DJ's? I am pretty sure THAT is a joke.

Dina is the coolest Republican I know. Hopefully she's on the more 
traditional Abe Lincoln kinda Republican, not these so called conservative 
nitwits that are giving the party such an awful name these days.

techno fans into rapturous fits.

In just a few short years, Pan-Pot--the duo comprised of Tassilo
Ippenberger and Thomas Benedix=97-have become a central presence in
electronic dance music's most advanced sectors. Their rise parallels
that of their home label, Anja Schneider's Mobilee, coming at a time
when established categories are breaking down and accepted notions of
"minimal" (please) are giving way to an unprecedented degree of
dynamism on demanding dancefloors.

Pan-Pot's vinyl debut came in May 2005 with the Popy & Caste EP
(mobilee002), featuring two cuts bursting with gritty, dirty funk, as
though they'd scraped all the gunk from beneath the knobs of their
gear, packed it into a ball and sent it rolling across the nightclub.
Since then, in addition to their contribution to the Extra EP
(mobilee005 plus), backing Daniel Stefanik's anthemic banger "The
Bells," they've released three more EPs on Mobilee (Obscenity,
mobilee005; Black Lodge, mobilee012; and What Is What, mobilee023) and
two on Einmaleins Musik. Their kinetic, undulating grooves have proved
particularly tempting to other producers=97-Jesse Rose, Lee Van Dowski,
Agn=E8s, Barem and Camea have all taken (pot)shots at reworking the
group's tunes=97-and their own remixing skills are increasingly in
demand: Pan- Pot have put their immediately recognizable spin on
tracks by Misc., Anja Schneider & Sebo K, Tim Xavier, Dapayk Solo,
Sweet 'n Candy, and Dami=E1n Schwartz, among others.

The release of their debut album marks yet another milestone for the
group. Appropriately titled Pan-O-Rama, the record=97-which has the
honor of being the first artist album released on Mobilee=97-offers a
360-degree tour of techno at its most twisted, balancing ominous
atmospherics with an unusual lightness of touch, and running classic
machine music through silicon's digital wringer.

They may name themselves after a piece of gear, but Pan-Pot's music is
ultimately about moving bodies, not knobs. Both live and as DJs,
Pan-Pot deliver on that promise with sets that rope together crisply
minimal, coolly restrained techno and hot and heavy house. Anyone
who's ever played with an analog synthesizer knows that all those pots
and dials are there to be touched; Pan-Pot reaches out and touches
right back=97with a love slap from the heart of the Berlin underground.

CLINT STEWART

In a sea of heads, Clint Stewart can't contain his enthusiasm. "It's
an amazing time for dance music," says the Auralism assistant label
manager. "There's so much good music and an endless list of people
making it. It's inspiring." The Florida-born DJ / producer / promoter
is true to his word, commanding crowds with ease and producing sexy,
gauzy cuts that exhort everyone to dance.

Growing up in a home surrounded by the sounds of classical music to
classic rock and early blues, he began training in classical piano and
guitar. Over time Stewart's adolescent obsession with punk's passion
and aggression ("I hated dance music") led to a college-age awakening
to techno's dark, relentless groove. A stint on UNF College Radio
Station gave him the opportunity to start Nocturnal Underground radio
show where he met Marc Smith. After college he moved to Miami and
began eventually joining forces with Auralism co-founders Marc Smith
and Jason Short and playing at their residency at Jazid. Within the
year, Stewart moved to Hawaii for a brief stint to "get away", but was
soon living in San Francisco after a gig in which he never stepped
foot on his return flight.

Since joining the Auralism camp, Stewart has been "going 100 miles an
hour, all day, every day," playing high-profile DJ gigs with top
artists among as well as a particularly sizzling set at SF's annual
LoveFest. In addition pounding the pavement for Auralism, Stewart has
a growing list of productions out there, including a pair of ecstatic
remixes for the label's inaugural Aural Therapy 1.1 compilation.
That's a lot of work for a short time in a new town, but master
multi-tasker Stewart's just getting started.

upon the wind and dance upon the mountains like a flame!" - W.B.YEATS=20

[official release date: 14 April 2008]
 
 i know it's not formally out yet, but i have to post a preemptive "fuck yeah" for this mix. are we allowed to post unauthorized links to mixes on this list? either way, it is currently floating around online and it's worth seeking out.
 
 i'll admit that diggers hasn't really been doing it for me lately. i know he's got a gaggle of rabid fans out there who believe he can do no wrong, but i remember listening to the sasha and digweed set from bonnaroo 2007 and then promptly forgetting it. this mix is something special though. the layers are engaging and complex, as digweed often has three tracks playing simultaneously. there's a little something for everyone here: moments of feather-light trance, fist-pumping, driving progressive, electro undercurrents, and enough subtle twists to make even the most sober listeners second guess the contents of their coffee. 
 
 here's the published tracklist, though i think it's actually a bit more complicated than this:
 
 01. Julien Parise - A5B (Mirko Remix)   
 02. Henry Saiz/Guy J - From Empty Lands/Geko  
 03. Jeff Bennett/Kabale und Liebe + Daniel Sanchez - In Spite/Mumbling Yeah (Loco Dice Tribute Remix)  
 04. Nightguy/Henry Saiz/Myers Briggs - Pretty Face/From Tangled Seas/Forever   
 05. Sian/Kim Runic/Two Lone Swordsmen - Wear Your Scars Like Medals/Suspicious Blue/Shack 54 (Jet Project remix)  
 06. Plasmik/Jamie Stevens - Pitch It/Keep Her Space (Claude VonStroke Remix/Smith + Selway's Control Mix)  
 07. Jerome Sydenham + Tiger Stripes/Guy J - Elevation/Under Pressure (Ink + Needle Remix)   
 08. Pascal Feos + Marc Mirror/Spector/Jrg Burger - Rezolution/Mineral Drive/Superpicture (Jamie Stevens Remix)   
 09. Pig + Dan/Emmanuel - Dreams of Bells/Parade (Original Mix)   
 10. Soliquid - Piknic Bugz (Original Mix/Gone Wild Mix)
 
 seriously, it's a fantastic mix. check it out!

love,
mo

FWIW etc...

Actually I was indicating the +1 for Marc(o)...

This started with a conversation we were having on the way over to Phoenix about being mistaken for being gay.

Best,

Peter

Well to corroborate with my new found gayness (even if it is only 1 point),
I'm going to have to call you Marci from now on!  Or is it Marc(i)?

Hey Andy,

I still go off from time to time, but I think and hope age has mellowed

Good to hear from you chappy!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] John Digweed - Transitions Volume 4

Nice TL! I have actually always been a huge fan of Digweed. I like some of 
Sasha's production, but when it comes to DJing, Digweed is just leaps and 
bounds better. I have enjoyed a good deal of his mixes/sets...any chance you 
have a link for me Mo??

About time Diggers did something new like this...even if his hair still 
looks goofy as fuck.

lol

There was no point to it.

I lost my job recently and am having trouble finding work... Does anyone
have any suggestions or ideas? I have no degree or credentials, but I am a
fast learner, good with people, and have a pretty huge knowledge of most
things music-related.  I've worked in retail, food service, dot-coms, whored
myself out as a cigarette girl, and was a party promoter for quite a few
years. I travel and play shows quite frequently, so I am looking for
something flexible and part-time, preferably nothing too soul-sucking or
degrading.  I live in Alameda and can get to BART, but don't have a car. Any
ideas?


Thanks!!

Love Chelsea

I got it to run in Firefox, had to hit "run" (Firefox pop-up) then "Unblock" (Windows pop-up). Then my boss walked in. . . More review later.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] McCain to Campaign at Burning Man Festival

thanks but there had to be some mistake...

being a full-time "artist" and gay, that puts me way outside the ideals of 
today's republicans...  sorry, but I'm wayyyyyyy outside that box.

not sure who claimed I was one, but that was a great april fool's joke if I 
ever had to be the brunt of one.  i think my heartrate even went up 20 
points when i read it.

ohwow!

Hey all,

I've got a friend with an extra Yuri's Night ticket for sale. He's 
selling it at the price he got it for, which is $40. So it's a deal 
since you're not paying any of the fees.

If interested, shoot him an email (His name's Aaron) to

Subject: Re: [sfraves] McCain to Campaign at Burning Man Festival

I know I can get lack on my email but 4 days ain't typical for this list....
Turns out I wasn't just sick with the flu when I finally hit Moksha Saturday 
night and just got out of surgery early today.  Doh!  So I guess my joke 
about dying around my friends wasn't so much a joke (not that the odds would 
have actually favored me dying, but internal bleeding ain't no joke).  Lucky 
I decided to cave in and go to the doc when I didn't feel so good on Monday! 
wow!

Aside from that, if you had put me out there as virginal and pure as the 
driven snow, well I'd have to say that is not a joke either.

LOL

I missed you on Saturday daw'lin!  I"m gonna be back down for some intimate 
"club-like" gigs in April.  Do I need to arrange for your kidnapping to kick 
it with you? I can and will if I have to!

Subject: [sfraves] remember when?: Archaic Revival

First, tune in here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8BOUtKe2dg

Then read along...

"we're not dropping out here... we're infiltrating and TAKING OVER."
-- Terrance McKenna

Best,

Peter

Archaic Revival

"Allright... tonight, for your edification and amusement... three raves, two interregnums. Visions by Rose X. Didgeredoo, Stephen Kent. And sound by Space Time. Words and ideas by Terence McKenna. Rap one: The Archaic Revival.

History is ending, because the dominator culture has led the human species into a blind alley. And as the inevitable chaostrophe approaches, people look for metaphors and answers. Every time a culture gets into trouble, it casts itself back into the past looking for the last sane moment it ever knew. And the last sane moment we ever knew was on the plains of Africa, 15,000 years ago, rocked in cradle of the great horned mushroom goddess before history. Before standing armies, before slavery and property, before warfare and phonetic alphabets and monotheism. Before, before, before. And this is where the future is taking us. Because the secret faith of the 20th century is not modernism. The secret faith of the 20th century is nostalgia for the archaic, nostalgia for the Paleolithic, and that gives us body piercing, abstract expressionism, surrealism, jazz, rock and roll, and Catastrophe Theory. The 20th century mind is nostalgic for the paradise that once
 existed on the mushroom-dotted plains of Africa, where the plant-human symbiosis occurred that pulled us out of the animal body and into the tool-using, culture-making, imagination-exploring creature that we are.

And why does this matter? It matters because it chose that the way out is back, and that the future is a forward escape into the past. This is what the psychedelic experience means. Its a doorway out of history and into the wiring under the board in eternity. And I tell you this because if the community understands what it is that holds it together, the community will be better able to streamline itself for flight into hyperspace. Because what we need is a new myth. What we need is a new true story that tells us where were going in the universe. And that true story is that the ego is a product of pathology and that when psilocybin is regularly part of the human experience, the ego is suppressed. And the suppression of the ego means the defeat of the dominators, the materialists, the product peddlers. Psychedelics return us to the inner worth of the self, to the importance of feeling immediate experience. And nobody can sell that to you and nobody can buy
 it from you, so the dominator culture is not interested in the felt presence of immediate experience. But thats what holds the community together. And as we break out of the silly myths of science and the infantile obsessions of the marketplace, what we discover through the psychedelic experience is that in the body-- in the body-- there are Niagara of beauty, alien beauty, alien dimensions that are part of the self, the richest part of life.

I think of going to the grave without having a psychedelic experience, like going to the grave without having sex. It means that you never figured out what it was all about. The mystery is in the body, and the way the body works itself into nature. What the archaic revival means is shamanism, ecstasy, orgiastic sexuality, and the defeat of the three enemies of the people, and the three enemies of the people are hegemony, monogamy, and monotony. And if you get them on the run, you have the dominators sweating, folks. Because that means that youre getting it all reconnected, and get it all reconnected means putting aside the idea of separateness and self-definition through thing fetish. Getting it all connected means tapping into the Gaian mind. And the Gaian mind is what were calling the psychedelic experience. Its an experience of the living fact of the entelechy of the planet, and without that experience we wander in a desert of bogus ideologies, but
 with that experience, the compass of the self can be set. And thats the idea, that were figuring out how to reset the compass of the self, through community, through ecstatic dance, through psychedelics, intelligence-- intelligence... this is what we have to have to make the forward escape into hyperspace."

Hey everyone,

The East Bay Permaculture Guild is having it's annual Garden Bike Tour  
this Sunday, starting at 11:30 at the North Berkeley BART station. We  
cruise around as a group, checking out some pretty spectacular gardens.

If you're into gardening (or want to learn) this is a great  
opportunity to get some ideas and inspiration and see what others are  
doing with their yards and community spaces.

Let me know if you have any questions about the tour or if you'd like  
to come. We ask for a $10 donation to the Permaculture Guild, but  
nobody will be turned away for lack of money.

The past two years have had groups of about 25 to 30 people on the  
tour. It's loads of fun. Hope you can join us!

-Philip-


Here's the tour itinerary:

Yeah, so the EB 4 year anniversary was the fucking shit. Saw loads of folks
I hadn't seen in ages. Everyone played dope sets, but especially Chris
Carter and RedStickMan's closing set was fucking sick.

AND IT WAS FREE!

If you didn't go, not only should you feel awful about yourself for being a
lousy excuse for a human being, but you should also apologize to the list
publicly.

It was that fucking good.

So thanks to Evil Breaks for throwing bangin parties for the last 4 years,
but especially for the serious business that went down last night.

Srsly u guise. U guise. Srsly.

Ha ha, I see you hung out with Osby for a bit with that closing line of

Sorry I had to miss it, but I know how those kids do it and they

Thanks EB for letting me show up late with an entourage, plug 
into a bad-ass club video system, and leave before it was over. 
Music and crowd were dope.

That's how it should be.

Subject: [sfraves] WR: Evil Breaks 4 Yr Yummy!!!!!  YAAAY

OK.. i know i have to play catch up here & post up all my like WRs I ain't
had time to really post up.. so I figure I'll start backwards & work my
way up to the WR I left off @...

Friday night I was a huuuuuuuuge well.. Friday day I was a huuuge lazy ass
& I staarted liike cleaning my pad up 'cause i kinda let it get messy the
past few weeks my parents been gone.. so by days end of cleaning & after
dinner, i was on the sofa watching Muppets Take Manhatten (which i ainh't
seen in years)... I mean... I seriously underestimated how long cleaning
was gonna take 'cause i was suppose to be in the City already doing
something, but no bueno... so basically, so set up, no go out!!  I thought
I was pretty much assed out at that point.

So while I'm watching Muppets... Unka calls me & demands that I go with
her to Evil Breaks... I mean.. homegirl was insistant on me going... &
well... she picked up my fat ass in Hercules & like seriously took me out
& Wow.. lol.. Hello 2day... I was sooo like Wow!!!  I mean.. she came
through & hooked a brutha up!!  She hella worked me on the phone for a
good almost 20 minutes for me to get out & it worked!!!!

OK... so we got there... 1st thing I gotta say is that the vibe was sooo
fuckin' huuuge!!!  So many people in Good Spirits, Good Energy, Good
people!!!  I mean... it's rare for me to go to a club & get all the ravey
vibe like that, but it happened!!!  The whole night wqas filled w/ people
I Love & Wow.. so Dope!!!

Music was Sick... I mean.. there was always a problem with where to dance
'cause all 3 areas were fuckin' Ill!!!  Yeah... Chris Carter killed it,
totally.. but like the EB crew totally made me ooh man.. it was so hard
not to dance!!!  I will say Bam's set was sooo like the set for me that
night!!!  I mean.. he killed it the week b4 @ Phoenix & maybe this set was
a continuation of that DJ energy he's been harnising & shining out.. but
yeah... I hella was in awe!!!

Oh yeah.. i got a massage & kinda reiki that night too!! :)  That was
pretty sick!!

But yeah... I mean... the whole week I was kinda 1/2 n 1/2 w/ my
emotions... I was still like hella high from Phoenix & hella mondo fuckin'
afterglowin' after that, but @ the same time, I was kinda goin' through
some rough kinda personal issues & I was just head fucked... but Unka,
Girl.. Thank U so much for getting me outta my funk & helpin' me get my
head strait again!!!

I totally needed Friday night so bad!!!  Evil Breaks was oooo intense.. if
you were there, u know what i'm talkin' about!!!  Thanks Evil Breaks for 4
years of madness & good times!!!

it looks like the olympic torch has met some challenges so far in london and paris. san francisco will be the only north american stop on the torch's journey, and it appears there is trouble brewing here as well. thoughts? is anyone planning to join the protests this wednesday?

Mo,

Great NRR topic!

I'm torn on the issue. I mean, I totally support Tibet, and I'm happy the issue of China's occupation is still getting global attention. On the other hand, look at what's happened in past Olympics. It seems like when they're held in controversial settings, (i.e. Nazi Germany, Russia) important things happen that set a turning point in history. I won't get into the whole civil rights impact spiel (right now, maybe later), but I think we can all agree that there have been significant turning points in history that occurred in Olympic venues.

IMHO, if China does get to host the Olympics, and that they get their asses collectively whooped, I think that would make a stronger statement then the current protests.

That said, I'd be very interested to read some other perspectives.

peace

CKG

Well, given her "performance" on her sex tape, it's no shock she can't dance 
either - she looked like a dead fish getting fucked.

Here here.

My job and staying out of the realm of homelessness prevent me from taking 
time off of work to go protest - I'll leave that to college kids with funny 
colored hair and pyramid studs on their jean jackets.

It' IS something worth protesting though. I deal with China and it's many 
unpleasantries on a daily basis, and I for one would love to see those 
little bastards get theirs for oppressing the Tibetan peoples the way they 
have for years (plus making all kinds of sub-par products and treating their 
workers/citizens like utter shit).

SAY NO TO MU-SHU PORK IN '08!!!!!

i can't really tell what's going on in that link... it looks like a reporter standing around waiting to share some breaking news that hasn't occurred yet. they zoomed in to something that might have been a sign hanging from the bridge...?

oh wait... it looks like some students climbed up the bridge, hung a banner, and are now being arrested. here's a fresh link to the story: http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gk8PeY1hcZPUKEORn6FeB95CGbyw

at any rate, i'm thinking about joining this protest. the olympics aren't particularly meaningful to me, but it's not every day that we get a chance to focus on human rights violations in front of an international audience and say "this is not acceptable". the issue of tibet especially is one that seems to pass in and out of the spotlight, and i think it's worthwhile to remind people that these problems have still yet to be resolved. 

i need to work too, but the torch route passes quite close to my office so i'm leaning towards skipping out for a bit. if the group is large, the press (in china or elsewhere) will have more difficulty dismissing the opposition as "a tiny number of Tibet independence elements". it seems to run a lot deeper than that, and the sentiment is ringing out across the globe. i don't start a lot of nrr topics on this list, but i'm definitely curious to hear what the (often politically charged) sfravers have to say. it does seem to be a topic that deserves further examination. 

love,

it looks like the olympic torch has met some challenges so far in london and paris. san francisco will be the only north american stop on the torch's journey, and it appears there is trouble brewing here as well. thoughts? is anyone planning to join the protests this wednesday?

And another way of looking at it...

Politicizing the Olympics while we type from our computers that were made 
in China is pretty damn pointless.  If we're boycotting, let's hit em 
where it hurts (the pocketbook, favored trade nation status, etc), not 
where they pointlessely lose face.  Fact is when you take BART into 
Oakland and pass miles of stacked shipping containers, almost every one of 
those empty containers is made in China, filled with Chinese goods for 
sale here, and left to rot at Port of Oakland because they don't want what 
we make as much as we want what they make.

The Olympics, while a demonstration from representatives of nations are 
one of the greatest exercises of humanism in modern times.  We didn't rob 
Jesse Owens his records by boycotting the Berlin games (even while 
Hitler's cries of "aryan master race" were echoing through the country), 
and I think a lot of the politicizing of the torch route is in a similar 
vein.

The PROC's human rights record is despicable, but I wish there was a 
better way of demonstrating our lack of approval of it.  Well, there are, 
but I'm not sure we're willing to pay the price.  China's behavior in 
regards to Sudan and Tibet *should* be on everybody's minds (as should our 
own government's support of similar regimes), but chiseling away at one of 
the things that I really think gives people hope at a basic human level 
isn't fair, especially to those olympians who experience only one or two 
olympics in the physical prime of their lives.

My swimming instructor when I was a kid was dicked out of a chance to 
prove her skills, gifts and training to the rest of the world when the US 
boycotted the Moscow olympics over their occupation of Afghanistan (and 
um, quick reality check, we're currently actively militarily occupying at 
least 2 nations as we speak including... oh look, Afghanistan).  Sucks, 
she was on the US team, she had the times to place if not win.

The torch and the games are a symbol of unity, of humankind coming 
together on the fairest of grounds to compete under the flags of all 
nations.  The error of having China host it was made years ago, I think 
politicizing the torch run and talk of further polticizing it is cheap and 
opportunist cause people don't want to put in the real work and skip on 
buying products from Apple, Ikea, Walmart, Target, Behringer, Mackie, 
Huffy, Keds, Timberland, RCA, etc, etc, etc.  It has reached the point now 
that it is easier to figure out who doesn't use Chinese factories.  
Almost every cell phone battery/laptop battery/ipod battery, etc you can 
get is made in substandard condition Chinese plants... despite China 
actually having some fairly strict worker protection laws (they just 
aren't enforced and moves to demand that companies get in on the 
enforcement game have been less than wholly successful).  The real enemy 
here is American consumers supporting American companies without adequate 
oversight.  We get our shit, companies get fat and happy, Chinese 
government and companies get their money, and the cycle is complete.  It 
seems we're very happy supporting China.  Despite what it does to it's own 
people, in all it's prefectures.  Despite what it does in other countries.

http://www.chinahighlights.com/tibet/map.htm

Tibet should be free, but on the other hand it's FUCKING HUGE (a great 
many people seem to think Tibet is some small mountain county full of 
goatherders and monks who just get beat up peacefully protesting while 
going to temple and chanting), and in a geopolitically un-negotiable 
location for China to tolerate a "western" thinking country.  On the other 
hand, our renewed interest in it has primarily to do with recent nuclear 
accords with India.  In short, we're getting played in a bigger game.  
The plight of Tibet has not changed, but the landscape is changing.  Do I 
support free Tibet?  Sure.  Is it viable?  Maybe not.  But a HUGE first 
step would be insisting that if China wishes to maintain most favored 
trade nation status with the nation most sucking it's mighty wang, they 
must allow free travel and free speech of international inspectors of 
working conditions in their factories, free speech in general from the 
populace, and accountability at a government level for serious infractions 
to those agreements.

I'd almost be happier if the torch went everywhere, might get people 
thinking.  It's a lot better than having to face the fact that while 
you're waiting for the other protesters, you might want to read the back 
of your ipod, the bottom bracket of your bicycle or the back of the helmet 
you're wearing and see where it was made.  Voting with our wallets, and 
pushing a greater degree of corporate & government accountability seem to 
me to be more effective than telling a symbol of global union, peaceful 
competition and humanism where it can't go.

http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2007/s2209892.htm

Muscling the torch from pretty much innocent photo opp runners that are 
just stoked to play a part in a tradition that stems back to ancient 
greece, trying to hit it with a fire extinguisher?  Who is fucking bully 
here?  I suppose it's easy to do if you see the torch as a symbol of 
China's occupation of Tibet or continued civil rights record, but before 
you get too kooky, understand that's not how a lot of the world sees it.

Yeah,

Imprisonment of political prisoners without trial, torture, capital 
punishment, occupation of sovereign nations despite lack of UN or internal 
popular consent, free trade with countries where slavery/rights of 
women/civil war/systemic class war/religious persecution/unpopular facist 
regimes/silencing free speech are happening... list goes on.

Oh wait, that's us.

Well, yea - that too. I agree with the majority of what you said (although, 
to be honest I had to skim through as I am at work and don't have time to 
read a novel). If the Chinese weren't paying my (meager) paycheck each 
month, I'd fully boycott just about everything Chinese I could think of. But 
it seems kind of pointless if I am letting them pay me.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: 2008 olympic torch relay

Some good points.  But protesting isn't the same as a boycott of the games by the athletes.  

Tthere is now talk of a broadcast boycott at least in some countries.  See http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/greenslade/2008/04/journalists_and_political_lead.html and http://followthemedia.com/writeon/boycott06042008.htm

I guess its also worth noting that the Chinese have already been paid for the broadcast rights, and watching or not watching probably won't imapct that at all.  You' just be boycotting NBC (http://www.reuters.com/article/reutersComService_2_MOLT/idUSN0719871120080407)  in reality.  Of course if the Chinese don't even allow a live broadcast (see http://news.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,30000-1310416,00.html) the point may be moot.

And another way of looking at it...

Politicizing the Olympics while we type from our computers that were made 
in China is pretty damn pointless.  If we're boycotting, let's hit em 
where it hurts (the pocketbook, favored trade nation status, etc), not 
where they pointlessely lose face.  Fact is when you take BART into 
Oakland and pass miles of stacked shipping containers, almost every one of 
those empty containers is made in China, filled with Chinese goods for 
sale here, and left to rot at Port of Oakland because they don't want what 
we make as much as we want what they make.

The Olympics, while a demonstration from representatives of nations are 
one of the greatest exercises of humanism in modern times.  We didn't rob 
Jesse Owens his records by boycotting the Berlin games (even while 
Hitler's cries of "aryan master race" were echoing through the country), 
and I think a lot of the politicizing of the torch route is in a similar 
vein.

The PROC's human rights record is despicable, but I wish there was a 
better way of demonstrating our lack of approval of it.  Well, there are, 
but I'm not sure we're willing to pay the price.  China's behavior in 
regards to Sudan and Tibet *should* be on everybody's minds (as should our 
own government's support of similar regimes), but chiseling away at one of 
the things that I really think gives people hope at a basic human level 
isn't fair, especially to those olympians who experience only one or two 
olympics in the physical prime of their lives.

My swimming instructor when I was a kid was dicked out of a chance to 
prove her skills, gifts and training to the rest of the world when the US 
boycotted the Moscow olympics over their occupation of Afghanistan (and 
um, quick reality check, we're currently actively militarily occupying at 
least 2 nations as we speak including... oh look, Afghanistan).  Sucks, 
she was on the US team, she had the times to place if not win.

The torch and the games are a symbol of unity, of humankind coming 
together on the fairest of grounds to compete under the flags of all 
nations.  The error of having China host it was made years ago, I think 
politicizing the torch run and talk of further polticizing it is cheap and 
opportunist cause people don't want to put in the real work and skip on 
buying products from Apple, Ikea, Walmart, Target, Behringer, Mackie, 
Huffy, Keds, Timberland, RCA, etc, etc, etc.  It has reached the point now 
that it is easier to figure out who doesn't use Chinese factories.  
Almost every cell phone battery/laptop battery/ipod battery, etc you can 
get is made in substandard condition Chinese plants... despite China 
actually having some fairly strict worker protection laws (they just 
aren't enforced and moves to demand that companies get in on the 
enforcement game have been less than wholly successful).  The real enemy 
here is American consumers supporting American companies without adequate 
oversight.  We get our shit, companies get fat and happy, Chinese 
government and companies get their money, and the cycle is complete.  It 
seems we're very happy supporting China.  Despite what it does to it's own 
people, in all it's prefectures.  Despite what it does in other countries.

http://www.chinahighlights.com/tibet/map.htm

Tibet should be free, but on the other hand it's FUCKING HUGE (a great 
many people seem to think Tibet is some small mountain county full of 
goatherders and monks who just get beat up peacefully protesting while 
going to temple and chanting), and in a geopolitically un-negotiable 
location for China to tolerate a "western" thinking country.  On the other 
hand, our renewed interest in it has primarily to do with recent nuclear 
accords with India.  In short, we're getting played in a bigger game.  
The plight of Tibet has not changed, but the landscape is changing.  Do I 
support free Tibet?  Sure.  Is it viable?  Maybe not.  But a HUGE first 
step would be insisting that if China wishes to maintain most favored 
trade nation status with the nation most sucking it's mighty wang, they 
must allow free travel and free speech of international inspectors of 
working conditions in their factories, free speech in general from the 
populace, and accountability at a government level for serious infractions 
to those agreements.

I'd almost be happier if the torch went everywhere, might get people 
thinking.  It's a lot better than having to face the fact that while 
you're waiting for the other protesters, you might want to read the back 
of your ipod, the bottom bracket of your bicycle or the back of the helmet 
you're wearing and see where it was made.  Voting with our wallets, and 
pushing a greater degree of corporate & government accountability seem to 
me to be more effective than telling a symbol of global union, peaceful 
competition and humanism where it can't go.

Muscling the torch from pretty much innocent photo opp runners that are 
just stoked to play a part in a tradition that stems back to ancient 
greece, trying to hit it with a fire extinguisher?  Who is fucking bully 
here?  I suppose it's easy to do if you see the torch as a symbol of 
China's occupation of Tibet or continued civil rights record, but before 
you get too kooky, understand that's not how a lot of the world sees it.

And um... hey buddy, the Olympics are way rave related.  I usually show up

That is totally like meth, peyote and viagra[*].  Which is how I roll.

FERREAL.

don't mix records on MethPeyoteViagra.  If a simple little K hole freaks

allow a full 8 hours sleep after coming down from MethPeyoteViagra (which 
may also keep you up for some 95+ hours in the first place).  In extremely

Hey Apollo -

Have you caught a documentary called "Maestro"
currently showing on Logo ??

I suspect you may know 90 % of the people
and 100% of the locations in the film . . . .

If you have not already - you gotta check it out !!

Well... some of us at work were talking just today about how fine a  
day wednesday would be to take a bucket full of water balloons down to  
the embarcadero...

Then we heard about those guys on the bridge.  That's about as ballsy  
as you get and kind of takes the wind out of the sails of anything we  
were planning.  Really... you just can't top that.

(Sorry if this goes out to anyone twice.  Looks like yahoo mail is  
anticipating the impending microsoft takeover and going ahead and  
starting to suck now.  So I'm doing what I should have done a long  
time ago and starting the switch to gmail.)


cya,

on a side note, he charges a ridiculous amount of money to
perform live.

by "perform live", i should clarify:  he's playing his own
music on CD decks with an accompanying percussionist.

He plays at Nickie's every Tuesday night, and the cover is $5. It's been 
years since I went but it was a good time. Definitely worth checking out.

well, somebody over at nickie's must be sucking his dick,
because he wanted to charge a serious ass-reaming amount for
the ambient mafia 8-year (of which was a BENEFIT party - i'd
hate to see how much he'd charge a for-profit party).

we ended up going with garth.  a good move, since garth
actually knows how to mix, and was pretty fucking awesome about
it.

Welp!  The king of (nrr) is back, and this time armed with a big  
yellow Penske truck full of stuff.  I'm still too tired to whatever so  
I'm gonna do my quote and go back to bed.  Maybe.  =]

A sacrifice was needed from war workers, the lunch team decided.   
Although earlier that morning DuPont's Dr. A.N. Benning had described  
how 1 part per million of hydrogen flouride in air etched glass in two  
hours, the diners determined that 6 parts per million of flouride  
breathed in factory air would be the wartime flouride standard for an  
8-hour workday, six days a week.

- Chris Bryson, "The Flouride Deception", page 82.

It's about time I came on here and thank the lot of you after your well
wishes for both the good times we shared at Moksha as well as following
my sickness/surgery last week after the Moksha party.  After the fact,
it turned out I wasn't as bad off as I could have been on account my
stubborn ass got into see the doc relatively early and since the
procedure, I've been feeling absolutely STELLAR!  It's amazing such a
tiny thing in your insides can make you sick for so long only to have
all signs of it go *poof* with the proper treatment, so good news is,
I'm 100% percent and won't have to postpone any of the engagements I had
lined up before the shit went down.  With all that said, I figured I may
as well give y'all a heads up on something I'll be coming down to your
neck of the woods to partake in.  I'm on from midnight - 1am or so, so
if you have the time and energy, then feel free to get your fix and kick
it with me whilst we chat the hell up about a bunch of who-knows-what...
or just come and dance and the hell with chatting!

playing a killer set for 2 hours or so. Suddenly he got a message on
his computer saying that his hard disk drive was unplugged.

    The music stopped, he checked and found out that the drive was
actually missing - basically someone STOLE his hard drive in the middle
of his set and ruined the all show!!!

Quite some time, I been sittin' it out
Didn't take no chances
I was a pris'ner of doubt.
I knocked down the wailin' wall
Ain't no sin
Got the feel of fortune; deal me in

Comin' straight on for you. You made my mind.
Now I'm stronger. Now I'm comin' through
Straight on, straight on for you
Straight on for you.

Now I know I got to play my hand
What the winner don't know, a gambler understands
My heart keeps playin' it through
with you, my friend
I'll take my chances on you again and again...again.

Comin' straight on for you. You made my mind
Now I'm stronger. Now I'm comin' through
Straight on, straight on for you
Straight on for you

Repeat

- Heart, Straight On

Something truly wonderful has happened, I discovered my old anthem trance
cds from when I very first started spinning. And you know that that means!
Soon, oh so very soon, I'll be unleashing another Tiesticles mix! So get
ready, because the anthem trance is gonna drop, and it's gonna hurt.

Hi Jim,

Actually a 2-DVD set of the documentary was released a couple of years ago.
A friend in NYC, Barry Lederer, one of the original GLF Firehouse DJs and
designer of the Trocs soundsystem among others, sent it to me.

Problem is there is so very little footage from the seventies.  The PG video
is from the closing parties in '87 as I recall.  By that time half of the
seventies staff and dancers were dead.

Ah well, good times.

Love,

Apollo

No one saw this happen?  

So I'm wondering how long his USB cable is?  The drive probably was within one or two feet of him when it was stolen.

Hmm, everyone must have been stoned at this one!

    Matthew Dear, who was celebrating his birthday yesterday, had been
playing a killer set for 2 hours or so. Suddenly he got a message on
his computer saying that his hard disk drive was unplugged.

    The music stopped, he checked and found out that the drive was
actually missing - basically someone STOLE his hard drive in the middle
of his set and ruined the all show!!!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Fucked up shit!


Heh, that happened when I was playing a live pa once at 2nd and Jackson, 
some fucking douchebag had the balls to steal my drum machine during the 2 
minute window between setup -> preflight check -> quick pee -> start of 
set.  Funny thing is, I had just bent one of the knobs on it a day or two 
before, and was planning to replace it under warranty so I'd just backed 
up all the patterns on it.  It was like a $200 loss at a time when I was 
making fairly good money DJing and doing sound for parties, so it was just 
a cost of doing things really, no major loss except faith in humanity.

I've gotten to the point now that I pretty much play off barely running 
ancient gear, a throwaway midi controller + cheap audio interface + cheap 
old mac g3.  Records used to have this built in security mechanism... they 
weigh a LOT... but even then, I had a full box of records ganked at a 
party once too.

It's weird, cause at 80% of the parties I attend, that is unthinkable.... 
so easy to let your guard down for the other 20%.

Subject: [sfraves] Allow me to re-introduce mahself

Hi Guys.

So I shared with you 'Street Art' (Wooster Collective) as a way to say  
Hi.  Some of you know me pretty well.  (Hi Terry, Sarilion, Apollo,  
Phillip, Forest, D-Fly and Moksha Tribe!)

I used to lurk  and post periodically on the list like 6-7 years back  
(holly shit time goes by quickly!).   I jumped off when there was too  
much unecessary flaming going on.  I signed back up about 2 weeks ago,  
mainly to hear feedback on Phoenix, and now feel comfy enough to re- 
introduce myself so here goes:

-My Name is Jose
-I hooked up with MokshaTribe through SFR, so I am forever grateful!
-I reside in the South Bay
-I dj, predominantly house music, but can cut up some nice downtempo  
and trip hop too
-I would like to start throwing my own events, because I would like  
the experience of doing my own thing.  I will still be collaborating  
with others Of course! I hope to call on the list from time to time  
for advice, for help, to promote, so on and so forth
-I am always willing to lend a hand if needed
-By day I work with New York Life

I think I will be heading to 'Blissed Out' tonight.  Maybe I will get  
a chance to meet more of you guys in person!

Much Respect,

-Jose Padilla

I used to lurk  and post periodically on the list like 6-7 years back  
(holly shit time goes by quickly!).  I jumped off when there was too  
much unecessary flaming going on.  I signed back up about 2 weeks ago,  
mainly to hear feedback on Phoenix, and now feel comfy enough to re- 
introduce myself so here goes:

-My Name is Jose
-I hooked up with MokshaTribe through SFR, so I am forever grateful!
-I reside in the South Bay
-I dj, predominantly house music, but can cut up some nice downtempo  
and trip hop too
-I would like to start throwing my own events, because I would like  
the experience of doing my own thing.  I will still be collaborating  
with others Of course! I hope to call on the list from time to time  
for advice, for help, to promote, so on and so forth
-I am always willing to lend a hand if needed
-By day I work with New York Life

I think I will be heading to 'Blissed Out' tonight.  Maybe I will get  
a chance to meet more of you guys in person!

Much Respect,

-Jose Padilla

Damn, I wish I could head out here tonite. Alas, I gotta do my taxes -- 
which is a bitch as I am self-employed and therefore, complicated as 
hell.What a lame excuse!!

Anyways, have a great time, everyone!!

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: (but funny) "Porn star unveils campaign weapon - her bottom"


ROME (Reuters) - She had no desire to be just another smiling face in Italian politics. So when porn star Milly D'Abbraccio designed her campaign posters, it was obvious she was going to show off her bottom.

Targeting her male fan base, the veteran of Italy's adult entertainment industry has plastered images of her derriere all around the Eternal City in a bid to win a seat in Rome's city hall.

If elected, D'Abbraccio wants to create a red light area with strip clubs, erotic discos and sex shops called "Love City" just kilometers away from the Vatican.

"It would be something cute, clean -- nothing to do with prostitution," said the actress whose films include "The Kiss of the Cobra" and "Paolina Borghese, Imperial Nymphomaniac."

...

"People don't want to see these politicians' faces anymore," she told Reuters in an interview from her Rome apartment. 

She said she was tapping into her popularity among pornography fans as "an act of generosity" to help Italy's socialists, who are fielding her in the municipal race.

"I am the derriere of the Socialist party," she concluded.

Subject: [sfraves] Yuri's night teaser pics

Just got back from setup. I think it's way more organized this 
year. Everything's more spread out, and there's a separate 
(adjacent) hangar *dedicated* for EDM music, so it should rock.

Radiant Atmospheres just finished their setup in there and it 
looks bad-ass :-)

Peep the pics:

Just a side note. According to Robert Anton Wilson, in the 70s,
Playboy photographers would occasionally put hash blocks inside
models' vaginas to increase the puffiness of the vagina lips and
simultaneously induce a contact high.

Vagina + hash is different from vagina + bong, though, and you should
always be careful about believing things that Robert Anton Wilson
said.

Subject: [sfraves] giles needs techno mix mp3s

Hey all, if you can point me in the direction of some food for my
head, I'll be muchly grateful.

Especially if you can help me figure out if Forest Green's insane, or
if she seriously thinks it's not in her interests for people to be
able to download her mixes. WTF?

OK actually that wasn't what I was going to say. Obviously Giles needs
to work on his diplomacy. Or just order some CDs inna old-school way.
Or both.

Anyhoo, Giles needs techno. Bass frequency overlords techno, sparkly
thoughtful Warp techno, walrus bludgeon techno from Norway, all kinds
of techno.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] giles needs techno mix mp3s



Actually, been meaning to ask folks... As much as I love techno, I almost
never have enough time to actually LISTEN to it outside of parties... I
mean sure, before I'll book a DJ I've not seen spin, I'll require a demo
and listen to that just to make sure it's a style that'll play to the
audience I expect would show up, but outside of that I find it's really
hard to find enough time to listen to a complete mix.  How does everyone
else do it?  It seems for me like I'm busy working, or running around and
taking care of stuff, not listening to techno unless I'm at a party.

As far as Forest, she spins enough and varies her track selections enough
how would you pick what to make available?  I would like for her to get
more out of town bookings, as she deserves a bigger audience than we've
got here in SF, you really think sticking some mixes up would help that?
Personally, I'm hoping to get her to produce some more tracks, but I'm
busy enough working on promo to chase after recording tracks just yet. :-\

Not mixes, and no walruses appear to have been harmed, but from Norway and worth a listen if you are in the right frame of mind: http://www.biosphere.no/mp3.html

Check out some of the other pages on the website.  It makes me cold.  Brrr.

Well OK. Here's the thing. Producing tracks is the main way people
hear about out-of-town DJs. So yes producing tracks to get out-of-town
bookings, plenty much logic. Howeva. Many producers now complain about
people putting their tracks on Soulseek before they're even released.
I've never had any luck at all with my releases or attempts at
releases so I can't say for sure but the impression I get is that the
same damage that MP3 did to the major labels is happening somewhat in
the DJ world as well.

But then again I don't believe it. The reason is I stopped buying
records and then bought a few because of stuff I heard on MP3. I knew
that it'd only be available for a limited time and I knew that if I
ever did start buying records again I'd kick myself for not having
those particular records. So I started buying records again **just in
case** I ever started buying records again. And as crazy as that is,
it's an instance of MP3 availability creating sales rather than
destroying them. And a team of Harvard economists found that MP3 has
the same effect for nearly everybody in the music industry except for
the big stars. So it could be that the damage MP3's caused the music
industry is due to an overemphasis on Lindsey Lohans and an
underemphasis on Forest Greens.

I forgot my point. Which is why I didn't want to respond because it's
so easy to go off on these sorts of tangents. Especially since it ties
into a presentation I'm preparing and some code I'm working on and a
theory I have about the business side of EDM. It's wicked faskinatin.
Howeva. Should Forest Green put up her mixes for download? YES! Any
time your fans are trying to hear your music and they can't, that's a
bad thing. And if I had Forest Green MP3s on my iPod people could be
hearing them in Edinburgh, London, Los Angeles, New Mexico,
Philadelphia, and Utah, because I travel all over the freaking place
and I like to tell people about the music I'm listening to. And it's
not as if I'm this incredible exception to the rule. The number of
people who take their iPods with them when they fly is actually quite
large. And literally everywhere I've ever been people are sharing DJ
mixes with each other, and nobody in their right mind is going to
refuse to listen to a mix because it comes from some other town. YES
FOREST SHOULD MAKE HER MIXES DOWNLOADABLE!!!!! Sheesh.

I can rant all day, so, I'll stop, but yes I have a firm opinion here
and that's what it be.

Interesting.  I have some (I suspect) similar ideas about business implications of EDM "business models" to the wider music business.  I tried to pursue some of these back at Live365, but didn't get to far...

I also see that you have an interest in metaprogramming.  I am currently writing a meta-program to generate clustering algorithms in Mathematica.  Fun!

Also I think I will steal your Darth Vader slide.  

That is all.

Best,

Peter

This is the first promo I've recorded in a while, thanks to having too much
school and work to really focus on anything else for the last few months.  I
laid down most of the track sequence while high on mushrooms but I think it
still sounds good, and I hope that at least some of you agree.

Just found something where the Plump DJs say there's not a lot of
money to be made in releasing albums any more. So maybe it's true
across genres, rather than just being a Top 40 thing.

The Darth Vader thing turned into a huge meme at that conference. If
you're into that stuff keep an eye on my blog, I'm doing a
presentation on music-generating code in late April in New York, it'll
be available as video and it'll have some interesting bits. (It's
mostly for an audience not savvy to EDM but with an interesting Webby
perspective on business.)

Anyway, there are actually two Darth Vader slides, plus one with R2D2,
and Boba Fett, but he's wearing a fez rather than a sombrero. I'm
fairly certain I stole the original Darth slide from a Bay Area crew
throwing parties, so if it's stolen back there's no harm in that.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] giles needs techno mix mp3s

Its clearly not just a top 40 thing.  In fact its not just about music or movies, even though these get all the press.  It is about anything that can be digitized and shared as digital data file.  This includes software, books, photographs, and many other products of applied knowledge.

What are the forces at work that have led to the decline of music sales? IMO we have three:

First we have ubiquitous connectivity.  I can get on the network pretty much anywhere I am and almost anytime I need music.  And I can connect to anyone, anywhere, that has some music to share with me.

Second, we have extreme media abundance.  I receive more links to music than I actually have time to listen to.  And there are litteraly thousands of hours of free music in almost every genre available.  If you just spend a short time looking, you'll find more music than you need, and it will be almost all free.

Third, we have easily accessible algorithmic search.  If I want to find music by any artist, a specific track, etc. I use Google or some other form of algorithmic search to find it.  I don't wait to hear something on the radio or for word of mouth or  for anything else.  I can actively search and find exaclty the music I want.

These three forces have brought us to where we are today with the music industry teetering on the brink of collapse.  Thi sis large part because their primary purposes have become obsolete.  Labels existed originally so that muscians could find an audience to sell their works and so that the audience could find music it would enjoy.  However, the labels existing expertise in these areas is quickly becoming irrelevant in the age of ubiquitous connection, media abundance, and algorithmic search.  I simply connect and search for what I want.  To the extent that underground artists and labels have copied the classical record label business models based around outdated ideas like scarcity of copies, difficulty of finding new artists, etc. these  three forces will have a similar impact on their wallets.  That game is simply over, and people really should stop playing it.

But now things get really interesting since we have two more powerful forces about to come into play:

1. Virtually unlimited storage
2. Virtually unlimited computation via scalable grid computing

At its peak Live365 offered over 40,000 different MP3 streams.  We built a server farm with 4 terabytes of network attached storage to serve these streams.  Today many personal computers ship with 1 terabyte, and you can buy external terabyte drives at Costco.  The smallest iPod already has the capability to hold more music than most people will ever listen to (a survey taken around ten years back showed that the average American owned less than 20 CDs), but beyond that soon you'll be able to store every song ever recorded on an affordable removable and portable storage device.  Its just a matter of time before people start selling drives on the black market preloaded with entire categories or genres of music.  Someone recently offered a "complete" set of recorded music on eBay collected exactly for this purpose on might suppose.  See http://www.boingboing.net/2008/02/18/worlds-most-complete.html

The availability of essentailly unlimited on demand computing makes possible a range of media processing tasks that can only be partially imagined today.  For example, a few years back I proposed the idea of creating a playlist "renderer" that could render a defined playlist of music against an arbitrary music library.  If a specific track was not present in the library the renderer might select another similar sounding track, a track by the same artist, a track with similar theme and mood, etc. This all hinges on having a complex database of musical metadata either derived from human inputs such as tags or directly extracted from an examination of the audio signal itself.  Processing audio data to extract these sorts of signals is only now becoming possible on desktop machines, see for example http://www.fxpal.com/publications/FXPAL-PR-03-204.PDF but you can expect future applications to use the grid to do things like extracting signals, rendering
 playlists, computing new music recommendations, etc. or even generating new algorithmic music on the fly. 

And while the industry touts its online sales via iTunes (http://news.moneycentral.msn.com/ticker/article.aspx?Feed=AP&Date=20080103&ID=7992868&Symbol=SNE) the dirty secret is that fewer than 5% of music consumers actually purchase music online.  The industry is in deep trouble, and the Apple alone isn't going to save them.  True Apple's the number one music retailer now, but some might recall that the previous number one retailer, tower Reocrds, is no defunct. 

So back to EDM and raves...I would suggest that EDM artists and labels need to align their business models with these five forces if they want to avoid the fate of the RIAA labels/artists who have resisted the obvious until it is almost too late.  We've already seen a large decline in vinyl sales as many people started buying digital tracks at places like Beatport.  And this has led to a glut of used vinyl, such that even vinyl purists are buying less new stuff.  

The good news is that the existing track & party based model is very adaptable to the online environment, and many artists are poised to take advantage of their existing social networks, distribute new music without the need to produce a physical recording  They simply don't need to have a label in the classical sense.  People in the EDM scene are tech savvy and ready to find music online from services offering what they want.  The rest of the music industry is likely to lag here as the technical savvy of music consumers varies pretty widely.

IMO. YMMV.

Peter

Just found something where the Plump DJs say there's not a lot of
money to be made in releasing albums any more. So maybe it's true
across genres, rather than just being a Top 40 thing.

Well folks - ol' Marco is officially on the lookout for a new job. After =
being promised a raise less than 3 weeks ago, I found out Thursday =
before I left work, that not only will there be no raise for me, but =
there may be a 25% layoff throughout the company. (Gotta love the fact =
that the employees get punished for mistakes that the management/owners =
made that have us bleeding money like the proverbial gunshot wound to =
the head.)

Anyway - they basically told me if I wanted more money within the next =
year, I had better start looking elsewhere for employment - so I am.=20

I have a mainly customer service based background (almost 15 years), =
with about 4 years management experience, and about 2 years of technical =
support experience (nothing super techy though - mainly desktop/user =
support).=20

I am only looking for jobs in San Francisco or the near-by East Bay =
(Emeryville, Berkeley, downtown Oakland).=20

If anyone knows of anything that may fit any of that criteria, please =
fwd. info my way!!! Thanks!

(and yes, I am updating all the job boards, have posted my resume on =
Craigslist and a billion other places and am being proactive - I have =
already been contacted back by about 3 or 4 companies today and have one =
interview set up for Wednesday afternoon)

Thanks,
Marco

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Hysteria: A Benefit for the Women's Community Clinic

Just wanted to let folks know about a truly worthwhile benefit event that's
coming up later this week: Hysteria.  It's a Benefit for the Women's
Community Clinic, the only totally free clinic dedicated to serving the needs
of the uninsured/underinsured women of San Francisco by providing both
free health care and education.

I can sell tickets to whoever wants to buy them.  I'm sure it will be a
wonderfully fun evening, which includes a comedy performance from
Caroline Rhea (www.carolinerhea.com), a silent auction with over 140
fabulous items up for bid, a fully catered reception with delicious food as
well as an open bar sponsored by Anchor Steam, Seltzer Sisters, Miette
Organic Patisserie, Ritual Coffee Roasters, Craft Distillers, Hangar 1
Vodka and Cabot Vermont.  All guests receive a personal  gift bag to take
home.  In addition, your $100 ticket is valid for a $40 tax deductible
donation and your money supports an amazing, grass roots health clinic
that proves that it's truly possible to provide free, quality health care to
women, by women.

"There are no words to describe what the Women's Community Clinic
means to me. There are no words to describe what the Women's
Community Clinic means to this city. An excellent resource for women
with no health insurance. I am now fully insured and consider the treatment
I received at this clinic equal, and at times better, than what I now receive
at my health care provider"
- A Clinic Client

To hear more about how the Women's Community Clinic helps out the
women of San Francisco, listen to clinic director Carlina Hansen on
KQED's "Forum" here: http://www.kqed.org/epArchive/R803201000 as
well as on Women's Life Radio here:
http://www.womensradio.com/content/templates/?a=2354&z=25

The benefit will be happening on Thursday April 17th from 6p-9p at the
Jewish Community Center of San Francisco at 3200 California St.  People
who regularly attend local benefits have stated that they felt they were
stealing from the clinic by getting such a great event in return for their
donation.

And if I sell enough tickets I'll be able to get a free one for my girlfriend,
who volunteers at the clinic.  So please consider attending!

Thank you in advance!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] giles needs techno mix mp3s

Yep.  But not an entire category, which is mostly just a limitation of the technology rather than consumer demand.  Soon you will buy a disk drive loaded with virtually every song in a category, e.g. every punk recording made in the 70s, 80s, and 90s  and probably you won't pay that much more than the retail cost of the drive...

After being promised a raise less than 3 weeks ago, I found out Thursday before I left work, that not only will there be no raise for me, but there may be a 25% layoff throughout the company. (Gotta love the fact that the employees get punished for mistakes that the management/owners made that have us bleeding money like the proverbial gunshot wound to the head.)

Anyway - they basically told me if I wanted more money within the next year, I had better start looking elsewhere for employment - so I am. 

I have a mainly customer service based background (almost 15 years), with about 4 years management experience, and about 2 years of technical support experience (nothing super techy though - mainly desktop/user support). 

I am only looking for jobs in San Francisco or the near-by East Bay (Emeryville, Berkeley, downtown Oakland). 

If anyone knows of anything that may fit any of that criteria, please fwd. info my way!!! Thanks!

(and yes, I am updating all the job boards, have posted my resume on Craigslist and a billion other places and am being proactive - I have already been contacted back by about 3 or 4 companies today and have one interview set up for Wednesday afternoon)

Thanks,
Marco

Subject: Re: [sfraves] giles needs techno mix mp3s

great post, Peter.

As far as new distribution models for music go, I'd like to see  
something like a subscription service for labels or individual  
artists. For instance, if I find an artist whose music I really like,  
I could buy a subscription to their releases, maybe a few bucks a  
month, and whenever they put out a new track it pops up in my music  
library for me to listen to, play out, etc.

The benefits of this system would be:

- the artist gets ongoing income, and has a direct connection with  
their fan base
- as a subscriber, I become a direct patron of the artist and help  
support their creative work
- I don't have to go looking for new tracks - they come to me

This of course could function in parallel with other distribution/ 
sales models.

I think this would be a good and viable alternative to the top-down  
megaconglomerate music distribution model, which I, like Peter,  
believe is on its way out, and not a moment too soon.

I agree. Check this out:

Yes indeed. But I don't think the subscription model will work out. I
think that model has its heart in the right place but still assumes
scarcity. Check this out:

http://shirky.com/writings/fame_vs_fortune.html

Probably the only way to make money as a musician in the future will
be to give away music and charge for something else - such as live
performance, or music customized for particular situations (as in the
Kevin Kelly link).

This is why algorithmic composition matters. If you can't charge for
music any more, you need to be able to make as much original music as
possible, and ideally not only charge for live performance, but also
guarantee that the music in your live performance is guaranteed to be
unique.

Algorithmic composition ftw.

What a fun party!! Thanks to everyone who came over to my place on Friday
for Blissed Out.  It's nice to know we have such a supportive and wonderful
group of raver friends. =)

I definitely think we'll be having more parties like this in the near
future... Techno, cookies, and beer; the ultimate combo?

Thanks again everyone!!

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Tax Day joke

Found at http://www.joketribe.com/bawdy/96/June/JobTitle.html


A woman walks into her accountant's office and tells him that she needs 
to file her taxes.

The accountant says, "Before we begin, I'll need to ask a few 
questions."

He gets her name, address, social security number, etc. and then asks, 
"What is your occupation?"

The woman replies, "I'm a whore."

The accountant balks and says, "No, no, no. That will never work.

That is much too crass. Let's try to rephrase that."

The woman, "Ok, I'm a prostitute."

"No, that is still too crude. Try again."

They both think for a minute, then the woman states, "I'm a chicken 
farmer."

The accountant asks, "What does chicken farming have to do with being a 
whore or a prostitute?"

"Well, I raised over 5,000 cocks last year."

It also helps to have amazingly soundproof brick walls.  I am grateful for
those bricks every day.... When Sean and I first looked at the loft, the
landlord said "This place would be great for parties."   And, well, how
could we not move into a place with a landlord who wants us to throw
parties??  So it also helps to have a landlord who... likes parties. Weird.

This week I'll be joined by special guest Alona..

She's a local dj and crate digger who I originally met through Cosmic  
Jason and Travis - so if you enjoyed their eclectic selections in the  
void then you'll love her refined musical edge.

So tune in this Tuesday April 15th as we ignite the fuse of musical  
expression & emotion, and blast off into the colorful VOID..

go to 90hz.org to listen or use the flashplayer below. And I'll be in  
the chat while Alona's spinning so join me there if you dare. Remember  
to register in the 90hz.forum to gain access to the chatroom..

sfraves post from =9293 re: pulgas water temple full moon


"Date: Fri, 4 Jun 93 13:02:29 PDT
From: geoffw@nexsys.net (Geoff White)
Subject: June Moon Tune

This months FMR was at Pulgas Water Temple, an eerie neo-grecco-roman =20=

outdoor promanade situated in the wilderness of San Mateo county. The =20=

site is actually the terminus for the hetch hetchy water acquaduct =20
that supplies the reservoir system of San Francisco. The park is small =20=

but beautiful with a flat area for dancing, a long shallow reflective =20=

pool and an open dome or circular arch suppoorted by columns in the =20
middle of which is a hole from which you can look down at thousands of =20=

gallons of swirling water. It was nice to play the mythical mind game =20=

of what a couple of kilos of sid could do... but then we have =20
something better, the Vibe.

All of the parking along canada road is illegal (no parking signs =20
everywhere) by when I arrived at 0300 most cars were neatly parked =20
along the road, maybe about 150 - 200 cars, this was a relief to me as =20=

I usualy park cars for these things and it was good to see that the =20
community can take up the slack if I'm not there.

Even though the site was secured and people had been arriving en-mass, =20=

by 0345 the sound system, though set up had not started yet, (The FMR =20=

seems to be plagued with sound system problems, it would be nice if =20
they checked the stuff out before hand or arrived earlier, cuz it =20
always takes them 45 - 1 hour to get the sound working) but by 0400 =20
Garth was spinning the groove right along. The weather was just the =20
right temperature, and even though the moon became obscured by clouds, =20=

we could still feel her presence. Garth started to kick some really =20
funky tunes, and I could see that this could turn out to be another =20
incredible/evolutionary FMR when... the Police showed up.

It was just a lone car at first, I saw him at the top of the hill =20
shining his flashlight and whatever, I decides not to go up right =20
away, let him take it all in for a bit (besides, I really didn't want =20=

to do it) but eventualy no one else was around who was gonna do it so =20=

I decided to make initial contact. I gave my sacrements to a friend =20
for safe keeping and walked up the hill...

"Hi ya doin officer!"
"What's goin on down there" he says.
I say, "Well I think it's one of those rave party things, or something"
"Is this your party?"
Who me! NO, I'm just coming up to see whats happening"
He say "Well I sugguest that you leave right away cuz I just called my =20=

sargent and all of these people are going to jail"
I think to myself yeah buddy, you and what army, but I say "Well my =20
girlfriend is still down there, let me go get her OK?" This works =20
every time :)
"OK but I'd get her and leave right away if I were you."

So back down the hill I go, this is a usual first contact, next we let =20=

him sit for a while, see how many more show up. About 20 minutes later =20=

a LOT of crusiers show, CHP, redwood city, sheriff, SanMateo, maybe 13 =20=

- 20 cars. They start giving orders to disperse but the music is too =20
loud, Garth is throwing down some vicious trax, no-one would be going =20=

anyplace anyway, even if they could hear the order. Next thing I know, =20=

they're putting on riot gear! Shit, well is this the time to make the =20=

headlines? OR what? I am a vetran of the 60's and 70's demostrations, =20=

I knew that Pulgas was an enclosed area with the only method of escape =20=

blocked by the cops. The whole area is fenced in. If they could keep =20
us from leaving out the front, we could all be scooped up and arrested =20=

en masse (maybe not a bad idea) but some ravers would most likely =20
climb the fence and try to escape into the wilderness behind them. =20
There is an acquaduct and other stuff back there. Maybe defusing is in =20=

order. I go back up the hill and ask to speak to the person in =20
command. They want to know If I'm in control of the crowd, if not, =20
then I don't need to speak to anybody. I tell them that no-one is in =20
control, (a fact they find hard to fathom) but that I'm concerned, I =20
don't want any violence, to ensue and that I can carry a message to =20
the group.

Someone said that we want you guys to leave, we won't hassle anybody =20
if you just leave, I tell them that the riot gear is intimidating and =20=

unnecessary, we are a peaceful bunch but the riot stuff is scareing =20
people and when they are scared, they would rather stay together as a =20=

Family I they were going to be clubed. Just at that moment so police =20
officer turned on a high powered spot light that illuminated the area, =20=

some ravers got up in front of it and did some great "shadow dancing" =20=

the shadows were projected against the trees on the far side of the =20
temple making dancing figures 20 or 30 ft high. Truely on of the best =20=

visuals I've ever seen at a rave! Even the cops got a kick out of it =20
(those that could admit it) this seemed to chill them out a bit, a =20
couple laughed. My hats go off to the dancers whoever they are, who =20
made a truely transformational move in a scarey situation, it took =20
courage! I go back down the hill and back into the crowd, people are =20
talking about "sitting down" and stuff, well we'll see. Eventualy the =20=

cops send three or for officers in riot gear down to the DJ area and =20
stop Garth from playing. Everybody claps and cheers for Garth but =20
holds there ground. They didn't threaten the Police in any way, but =20
they did send the message that we were a family. After the music =20
stopped some people discussed what to do. I went back up the Hill to =20
"negotiate" with the police. They agreed to not arrest anyone or =20
confiscate any equipment so long as we leave now. I told them I =20
thought that would fly but that It would take time to break down the =20
sound system, when the sound system gets taken apart, people will =20
slowly leave. Just as some consensus seemed to be reached. A female =20

how they have been nice so far but our patience is wearing thin, etc. =20=

I walked over to her...

"Excuse me, mam, um, mam, that's not helping". I start to have a talk =20=

with her, (sending her the Vibe in a big way) I told her that these =20
kids were peaceful, there is no need for beligerence, the riot gear =20
and helmuts are scaring people. she totally GETS IT! She takes of her =20=

helmut to reveal all of this thick, beautiful, long, blond flowing =20

and why we have the full moon parties, she notices and comments on how =20=

there are people from every race present and every one seems calm and =20=

happy, they aren't sending her any bad vibes. I tell her that is what =20=

it's all about. This isn't about gangs, it's about Love, I watched her =20=

lighten up before my eyes. She told me her name was Ali and I told her =20=

mine, we walked along and I told her that we tried to choose places =20

hard drug use, maybe a little pot but nothing like crack or heroin (I =20=

didn't mention the e word), I told her that our scene is about Unity =20

duty, provided she won't arrest anyone :). By this ravers are going =20
around picking up trash (this blew her away) and cops and ravers are =20
at least being plesant to each other. I thought to myself, wow I =20
really charmed this big blond police officer, she's about my age, =20
maybe ... nayh , it would NEVER work :) So I said goodbye to Officer =20
Ali and told her that I hope if we meet in the future, it will always =20=

be on plesant terms, she thanked me for walking with her and chatting. =20=

We left it at that.

The FMR was moved to candlestick, I didn't follow.

I consider what happened there to be a success, a confrontation was =20

and I know at least some police were educated about raves and ravers, =20=

(I am sure officer Ali has a different viewpoint). The important thing =20=

is a change in consciousnes occured both for the ravers and for the =20
police. Ultimately when all of the rhetoric is said and done, it =20
personal and individual action that makes the biggest difference. I =20
saw Ali talking to some ravers she seemed to have pulled over (two =20

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1

Hola,

I'm looking at different solutions to scale the organization of metadata-less content, aka wav files.  I have two goals to tackle:

1)  The current idea for the directory structure is Genre => Sub Genre => Year Month => Track.wav.  Does anyone have any feedback on this?  Or other possible solutions?

2)   This is a little more tricky.  Given that wav files don't have metadata, I'm trying to figure out the best solution to:
    a)  Easily sort through music
    b)  Keep relevant data across multiple platforms
    c) Maintain something that won't become obsolete

I've read that there are programs that will add some metadata bytes to the beginning of wav files, but don't know if they will be read properly, if at all, by different music programs or devices.

The next (and probably only real solution)  I've come up with is using iTunes and only iTunes and writing a program to parse the iTunes XML and recreate it with the relevant information taken out of the file name and placed into the proper tags.  I'd prefer not to take this approach, as it limits to only iTunes, but given the popularity of iTunes and the iPod among all the new music devices coming out, I think this may be the only approach.

Any ideas?

Thank you,
Phillip

I don't think it's really supported at the consumer level (i.e. itunes

but a python script could easily parse out the embedded metadata.

Hmm... properly tagging with bwav is a good idea, the problem is that I really want it to display properly, for the purpose of little displays on things like the idj2, or CDJ-400.

I think I'm SOL trying to use metadata effectively across multiple devices... damn iTunes and devices not supporting FLAC.

This is old news, but it being the case I think my prostate will be just
fine later in life. I estimated around 2001 that I'd spent roughly 1500
hours masturbating in my life at that time. If I had to guess since then,
I'd say it's at least doubled. Hooray for beating off regularly. Or
constantly. You know, whatever.

I've never been to Pulgas, but it sounds a bit like the Water Temple

I think they're more or less identical structures.  San Mateo's is a bit 
more lush from what I recall.

Subject: [sfraves] WR: Blissed the fuck out! LIterally

OK.. sorry for the lag, but it's been kinda ummm... a werid like week to
fully write a a full like weekend review... so here I go :)

LIke before the shindig @ Bliss Bliss.. I had an accupunture treatment &
it was Dope!  So Dope!!!  I mean.. it was like a general just overall, no
specific problem area accupuncture... ummmm... well.. it was just to like
done to strngthen my chi (i think).. oh yeah, & to regualte my
digestion... but Wow... lol.. it was Awesome, like i mean.. i hate 10
needles stuck in me, mainly around my tummy area & belly button, & 2
needle pokes on each of my knees... then Dr Max like used this mini sage
stick, but it wasn't sage, to burn the needles & to also get some of that
sage smoke stuff insode my body or something, but yummmmm, that was sooo
Groovy feeling like seriously, HELLO 2DAY!!!

Then me and Dr Max went to Bliss Headquaters for some Mixed Blissed Uppity
yummy yum action, & all the while, i was pretty Naturally Blissed out
myself from the needle job.  LIke al night i was kinda in this constant
state that i was like floating.

So the music was Dope... we didn't get there 'til 11:45ish i think... &
this guy was playing like this kinda disco techyish tribally kinda house
from what i remember... I mean... there was aloooooota Electro from
alooota DJs, alota Techno too, there were alota DJ i saw, Loved, ooh shit,
Forest Green totally threw it down, but it kinda felt like she held back a
lil compared to other sets I've Groove to of hers lately, which was fine
for the occasion... & I still Loved it!!!  The DJ b4 her w/ the accent,
that's when i started dancing... then there was that 1 DJ who was part of
the DJ Bone party last year who dropped this Dope Techno set too (some
Electro too)...

OK... & I'm not just sayin' this 'cause he's my Big Bro, but fuckin' Andy
man... he really fucked me Blissed Over Hello 2Day WOW.. i mean... he
started out HAAAARD & 'cause me & Dr Max had to like leave in the middle
of this set, it was still hard!!!  I was lovin' this live hard set he
fuckin' pulled off man... So Loved it!!

OK.. there wasn't much decoration other than all the constant yummy Bliss
around there already... but OK.. so they were showing JEM & The Holograms
cartoons all night (Disc 3) & even though i couldn't hear what they were
sayin'... i mean.. i knew most these cartoons by heart kinda & Chel-C
invited me to go there on a non hyphy Bliss night to have a JEM
marathon!!!  YAAAY!!!

OK.. crowd was all Yummy!!  Alota Familia there.. so it was Dope seein'
y'all & then some!!!  YAAAY!!!  Oh yeah.. so like i mean.. it was a really
mixed crowd, this group po Spanish Dudes were here from Spain & it was fun
getting to knew them!!  But yeah... there was like people from UK, German
dudes, I mean... it was just BadAss meeting all those diffent people who i
never met.. it was a rainbow of new people to meet.. then there wsas one
person who was like "yeah man, remember me from back inthe day, i always
wore that visor"... LOLOLOLMAO

Oh yeah.. theere were these 2 people that brought Cheese Tamales that
costed $2 & ooh fuck man.. they were yummy!!!!  I actually had 2 then a
3rd .. ooh so good.. o h yeah.. Chel-C Bliss Cookies were oh so yUmmy!!
OK.. but here's the kicker of the night, Simon, the Chinese guy some of
you might know who goes out & buys everyone food after a party, well... he
left & came back with so much Chinese food!!  So that was SO DOPE!!! 
Hello 2Day.. 'cause i didn't get to like eat too much before my
accupuncture or after, so YUm.. Mondo Hello 2day YUM!!!

So yeah.. me & Dr Max left around 4:30ish like in the middle of Andy's
Yummy Live Set... but yeah... too Jem & too much ear candy all while
Blissful & Floaty.. Thank U Bliss People for the Bliss Fuck I needed so
bad!!!

Kyron - Sonic Mandalas=20

An electronic aural transmutation of ancient principles=20

Mandalas have been employed by a variety of spiritual traditions to =
awaken the kernel of sanctity that lies dormant within all of the =
manifested universe. These Sonic Mandalas continue that tradition and =
may be used to focus attention and exercise pure consciousness in a =
trance state. They are also beautiful and enjoyable as pure musical =
experiences.=20
16 tracks ring in at just under one hour. Each track expresses a unique =
realm moving from expansive bright moods to dark ambient spaces and =
everything in between. Ambient electronic sounds meet with blip and body =
moving beats to create an album that spans from the heavens to the earth =
and back. This music can be used for meditation, deep listening, =
conscious movement, or sacred dance. It's the perfect CD to make any =
space more alive and conducive to the flow of raw creative energies.=20

You can get it from Itunes here:

honestly paraphrased that extremism in the defense of wealthy white people's
liberty is no vice.

has been becoming quite the happening... if you can't come down to the Lower
Haight and have a beer with us, tune in and hear what it's all about!

Tune in from 6pm-10pm at http://radio.defsf.com:1200/

More info below from the Killswitch crew.

This week at Killswitch: DJ Disconnect and Chel-C Faith (Live PA) of DEF SF

DEF is a collective of independent techno DJs, producers, and promoters
dedicated to advancing techno on the West Coast, by way of selflessness and
partnership in the underground electronic dance music community.


Currently led by DJ Disconnect and Chel-C Faith, DEF has hosted a number of
underground techno events over the years in addition to their own Radio
Integrated weekly radio show, and aims to promote and support the techno
community in the Bay Area.



DJ Disconnect describes his DJ style as "dreamy, groovin" and "laid back"
with a dash of progressive and neo-Detroit thrown in. Chel-C Faith, who will
be performing her own melodic, groovy, Detroit-influenced techno tracks
using all hardware, cites some of her techno influences as Speedy J, Kenny
Larkin, Marco Carola, and Funk D'Void. With two such strong proponents of
underground techno in the Bay Area, Killswitch is thrilled to feature yet
another strong contributor to the Bay Area's diverse techno scene.



Don't forget to get there early as we've got $4 Stellas + Slice of Pizza
from Volare Pizza from 6-7pm!

moon smokeout on 4/19 in the santa cruz mountains  ;)

Not sure who even gives a rat's ass - but since I always post about my =
woes, i figure it might be a nice change of pace to tell you all about =
something cool that just happened to me....

I just got a new job!!!!  It includes a fat raise, full benefits, a 401K =
plan, stock options, and more OTJ training than I could shake a stick =
at! PLUS, no more 2 hour commute each way!!! I get to shave off a =
healthy 45 minutes in each direction!!!!

*squeal*

I start on 5/5 and am so happy right now I could just pooh.=20

Anyway - WOOHOO!

Not sure who even gives a rat's ass - but since I always post about my woes, i figure it might be a nice change of pace to tell you all about something cool that just happened to me....

I just got a new job!!!!  It includes a fat raise, full benefits, a 401K plan, stock options, and more OTJ training than I could shake a stick at! PLUS, no more 2 hour commute each way!!! I get to shave off a healthy 45 minutes in each direction!!!!

*squeal*

I start on 5/5 and am so happy right now I could just pooh. 

Anyway - WOOHOO!

Subject: [sfraves] [BSP][FAKTION] One more week! AMBER and DRAGN'FLY! @Anu! hide the subwoofers!



Spring has definitely arrived, and 2008 continues to be a reinvigorated
year for techno.  For April we have another, different treat for you, as we
reunite some of the West Coast's best in the latest installment of danceable,
affordable Techno.  Underground DJ sensations AMBER and DRAGN'FLY come
above to show you where things are at.  So maybe it's a little different
techno than you've come to expect at Anu, it's still great, danceable
EDM, and can anyone remember the last time this dynamic duo teamed up at a
party?

Friday, 25 April, 2008

RAY presents: 

F A K T I O N : because san francisco needs another techno cult
with special guests and extended sets:

Friday, 25 April 2008:
DRAGN'FLY: DJ4NORML/DJDRAGNFLY.COM [ SAC/SF ]
DJ AMBER: Sister SF/iamthedj.com [ SF ]

Last Fridays @ Anu

DJ AMBER is a San Francisco-based dj/producer with a driving beat and
aggressively risky mixing technique in a town better known for its
laid back house style.  For over ten years she has brought her vigorous
style and enthusiastic stage presence to events throughout North America
and Europe.  She's appeared in some other venues you might have heard
of (1015, Ruby Skye, Supperclub), now she brings her sick loops, breaks
and smooth mixes to the FAKTION.

DRAGN'FLY: For the techno-afficionado, Dragnfly provides a sublime musical
experience formed from an intricate mesh of dark, sexy tech-influenced
beats, driving baselines and relentless mixing skills. Having bridged
the millennium with some of the most revered Bay Area underground crews,
demand for this iconic DJ has spread like wildfire over the past decade
and today she remains in the forefront of the electronic dance movement,
having already made over 1,000 domestic appearances throughout the
United States, including Hawaii, and internationally in various regions
throughout Mexico, Germany and Brazil."

"There is suffering in life, and there are defeats. No one can avoid  
them. But it's better to lose some of the battles in the struggles for  
your dreams than to be defeated without ever knowing what you're  
fighting for."  -Paulo Coelho

"Suffering and joy teach us, if we allow them, how to make the leap of  
empathy, which transports us into the soul and heart of another  
person. ln those transparent moments we know other people's joys and  
sorrows, and we care about their concerns as if they were our own."  - 
Fritz Williams

"I hate to advocate drugs, alcohol, violence or insanity to anyone,  
but it worked for me." -Hunter S. Thompson

Most of the touristy spots are in SF as mentioned, but it all depends on
what your fam's like...

Could take em on a boat ride out to Angel Island if they like photographing
nature and stuff...  For that matter there's the inevitable Alcatraz tour,
but it's probably expensive.  If there's little kids and they're looking
for an amusement park you've got great america down in the san jo, with
some other parks another hour past, leave them there and run yourself down
to santa cruz. ;)

The nature is certainly the best thing here, but if they want to see SF
like so many tourists, I'd probably start em off by the baseball park,
just drive through and point out all the old waterfront warehouses that
are still down there -- there's a nice brunch spot at 2 townsend if they
have money, don't forget that visiting relatives are a great source for
us having fine dining experiences :D -- move up around the ferry building
and then union square for shopping, castro, haight, mission districts for
some of SF's "culture" -- either pick some spots at random, or grab one
of those hotel "places to see" guides for some stopping points) -- run
out to the sunset if they haven't seen the ocean before, check out the
old sutro bathhouse ruins -- depending on timing a lot of tourists like
the ocean view from dining upstairs at the beach chalet btw -- maybe cruise
around the park, de young museum, asian art museum, the gardens, etc,
then loop over the top of the city so they can gawk at the golden gate
bridge -- ideally time this for sunset, it looks cool then -- stop at the
palace of fine arts and coit tower and stuff on the way down, and finish
a day with dinner in north beach for SF signature not-quite-italian-food.

Note that this list would normally take way more than a day to finish. :)

The Palace of the Legion of Honor - beautiful building - very 
dramatic location -
Annie Leibowitz show - all for 10 bucks - one of the best deals in 
town these days -
it is supposed to be pretty windy and cold the next couple of days - 
this would
be a good outing - then take everybody to some sort of dim-sum place for
a cultural experience

:)

Yep, got the next 3 months up at least, still working on the summer months
but those dates are at least predictable too.  I think I do happen to be
the only monthly not using a number for the day (last friday instead of 4th,
which means there's a couple times a year I'm on 5th friday) but you guys
are all smart enough for that one. :)

And I'm tellin ya guys, this year's collisions really feel like something
GOOD starting.  That there's actually CHOICES in cool music is critical in
a vibrant nightlife scene, and sure as hell beats a couple years ago when
we were all calling each other up and asking "hey is there a party this
weekend?" "A party" as in one... maybe... the sure sign of a dead music
scene.

We've been starting to get some folks out who mention it being their
first techno party, which seems shocking, but then I remember that I
know probably 80% of the folks at most parties as being DJs and
promoters at other parties.  While I love the "seeing my friends"
aspect of this, we've got a hell of a lot more talented DJs, producers
and what have you in this town than to just keep rotating whom among
us is on that night.  This means we must have multiple parties happening
at the same time, and people need to know about it.  A lot of folks don't
go out because they figure they'll never find that one underground, or
even which club has music they like, but if we get back to being famous
for lots of great parties all over, they'll come again.  It started last
year but it really does feel like it's hitting stride this year.

And I'll even confess that I have snuck out of one of my own parties to
go say hi to... well, she's a DJ everyone should know, and at least one
of you two knows her very well -- at a gig very close by. :)

Vista point on the Marin side of the GG Bridge
Coit Tower (near Chinatown)
Japanese Tea Garden or Botanical Gardens in GG Park
DeYoung Museum in GG Park (near Bunny Meadow)
Exploratorium (for the kids)

in your neck of the woods, the Lawrence Berkeley lab area in the hills behi=

the Albany Bulb is really interesting but requires some meandering around u=

the albany bulb is a LANDFILL.  there's dog shit everywhere. 
homeless people used to squat there, and some still do.  it's
fun for younger adults, but i wouldn't take my parents there.

you could always do an alcatraz tour.  if you go tomorrow in
the afternoon, you'll also be able to gawk at the hipsters
waiting for the sunset boat party.  ;)

LOL - yes, the Bulb is a "landfill", but the last several times I have went=
 it is not nearly that scary. They have gotten rid of most of, if not all o=

But yea, maybe not as parenty a spot.

Anyone go to this?  I've been deathly ill for three days and altho da kind herb IS good for what ails me (nausea, etc.) I figured I'd be best off staying home and sleeping and not infecting anyone else with this nasty ass virus.  I'm pretty bummed to miss a party among the trees however.  Hope someone will throw another one soon...

Subject: [sfraves] What's happening Tues/Weds this week?

I have friend TonyZ from NYC coming into town and he's looking for a party to play at or attend...


Tony plays a variety of styles, but I mostly know him as a house and tech house DJ. 


I met Tony when I sat on his panel at WMC back in 2001.  The panel  was on the subject of the Internet and dance music...if anyone had been paying attention we covered things like the future of digital downloading, all digital DJing, etc.  Many of the things discussed then have now come to pass...

My buddy Bryce & I went. The walk there included passing by a waterfall (always a good sign), and  our path was well-lit by the moon. We initially got lost (thanks "Doug's Party") but arrived around 2:00, with plenty of time for festivities. 

Two people walked up to us to us at different times and apologized because they were tripping. One had lost their glasses and was extra apologetic. In both cases we assured them it was quite alright and sent them on their way. 

I'm glad I wore the trees hoodie. It reached 33 at one point but the fire kept us warm. The visuals on the trees were a nice touch, and the turnout was great. There was a long tree where a bunch of kids were sitting down while others gave them light shows, but they weren't sitting in the middle of the dance area, so fine by us!

Someone dropped 'Hey Boy/Hey Girl' around 4:15 and we prepped for the official sesh. Left around 4:23.

Long drive home (and I live in the South Bay) cause I had to drop my buddy off in Scotts Valley and wound up taking a 2-hour nap at a closed gas station with the nozzle still mounted in my tank.

Woke up to the attendant sending me on my merry way before he called for some "help." Got home around 8 and woke up just in time for the second 4:20. 

Overall Vibe Factor: 9.5 out of 10. Not an unfriendly face to be found, and we can't wait for the next one.

peace

chuck

Admit it: You don?t know where the !@#$% Tajikistan is.  Or
Kyrgyzstan. Or Turkmenistan. But as your kids will be fighting there
among the oil pipes, you should kiss Ted Rall?s crazy ass for going
there first - and getting it all down in a book of dead-on cartoons
and reportage, Silk Road to Ruin.

Subject: [sfraves] bsp 4 programmer/dj/producer types

Relevant to MP3/music biz models discussion last week:

"In an MP3 world, recordings are cheap. Therefore, the whole
fundamental business model of selling recordings is completely doomed.
A business model based on expensive recordings sells recordings; a
business model based on cheap and abundant recordings gives recordings
away. This makes the body of recordings of your live musical
performances equivalent to a blog - you should be updating it all the
time. Recording your live performances should be as cheap as capturing
a log file, since distributing those recordings is as cheap as
publishing an RSS feed."

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: worm composting workshop this Saturday

My latest project in the quest to save humankind from ourselves is a  
series of free composting workshops that I will be teaching at Spiral  
Gardens in South Berkeley.

The first will be a vermicomposting workshop this Saturday, April 26th  
from noon to 2 pm. Vermicomposting is the use of red worms to turn  
food scraps into plant fertilizer - great if you don't have much space  
or enough yard waste to make a regular compost pile.

In the workshop you will learn:

-How to set up and maintain a worm bin
-How to use the finished castings
-How to spot problems with the bin, and how to fix them
-How to order a discounted worm bin and how to make your own from  
cheap or free materials

If you'd like to come check it out, come by Spiral Gardens this  
Saturday at Noon. We'll have snacks and drinks, and will be giving  
away a worm bin ($100 retail value) as a door prize.

In addition to being a community garden, Spiral Gardens is also a  
plant nursery. All profits from the sale of plants go towards  
supporting the non-profit mission of the project, so plan on doing  
some spring plant shopping while you're there for the workshop!

Spiral Gardens is at 2850 Sacramento Street in Berkeley, 2 blocks  
north of Ashby.

An interesting perspective, and one that's actually quite flawed in a
very basic assumption -- counter-intuitively, on the blog side of the
analogy.  Bandwidth isn't free, isn't even close to it.  There's a myth
of free bandwidth propagated by the eargerness to sell that last mile of
net, the "home DSL" market, however as anyone hosting servers is slowly
and painfully learning, it isn't real.  The internet is cheap on that
end because you don't actually get the bandwidth you think you're
paying very little for.  If you've ever noticed how slow it is to
UPLOAD data, you get a sense of the real bandwidth you can get that
cheaply.

On the server side, these costs are quite exposed.  You get sites with
painfully slow performance, or ones with what seems excessive advertising,
or annoying subscriptions, or any number of other means to reclaim this
cost.  And the costs are rising.  leaving a single server running costs
some $40+/month just in power, by the time you have a farm of them
capable of delivering anything close to a useful choice of things to
download, you're paying again for the cooling costs (about doubling the
power cost), and real bandwidth costs, which drive things up by another
factor.

Sure, you can drive into sharing models, and you can rely on the
"free" sites (like youtube for video), none of these barriers are
insurmountable, they're just far from free.  RSS is "nearly free" mostly
because it's "nearly nothing" in terms of actual data.  A single MP3 of
any length/quality is more data than many RSS servers total content.  It's
the effort of sailing a paper airplane versus throwing an entire book
our your window.

Sure, as technology improves, it makes more bandwidth available, making
the whole thing cheaper, it just also exposes other areas that have
never been thought of as costs.  Distribution happens to be where the
world has spent most of its recent efforts in reducing costs.

Now, for a genre with a more limited appeal, and in a free world with
many artists, it's possible for much of this cost to be buried in the
individuals paying for bundled services.  I can throw a couple MP3s
of my artists out there for download, not because it's free, but because
the cost of just hosting a site where I can announce the parties and
whatnot masks how much I actually had to spend.  In economic terms,
as long as the real cost of sharing something is less than the step
variable increase in obvious costs, nobody notices (translation back:
I had to pay a fixed fee for webhosting so as long as the MP3 fits
in my space allocation and isn't popular enough to hit the bandwidth
limit, I don't pay extra.  That isn't free though, just means I had
to overbuy for the webhosting) what it cost.

So, my own belabored point?  Yes, recording is cheap.  I can record
hours of DJ sets every party.  I just can't give them away for free,
because distribution (giving away) is what costs me.  Just look at
how many people have recently offered to share their libraries IF
anyone was willing to offer a space to put them.

And as I said, yes, you can get into the sharing models, but that's still
far from free.  That I'm no longer paying for a dedicated high-volume media
server doesn't remove the cost, it merely hides it.  I'm paying to keep a
dedicated tracker somewhere, and I have to provide a seed server to keep
the torrent going.  Other people are paying not only for their internet
connection, but for keeping a computer turned on to help in the endeavor.

It's not that it's free, it's that there's a lot of wasted money out there
to use.  Very different case.  Maybe you don't care if the songs can't be
downloaded at long, random periods when no one with a copy is online to
help share, etc.

Why not have your web server box seeding the file? :)

I suppose my main reason for commenting was in regards to whoever posted 
the idea of the future business model for music more reasonably being 
one of the subscription model (or similar) than what seems to be an 
outdated one.  (Was it Peter or Philip who emailed about that idea???) 
This seems to me to be the most viable model for the future.  We are 
already seeing many muscial acts relying on income from touring as the 
means of making it.

Maybe this is a bit of consumer backlash from having to pay records 
labels 3 times more for something that cost them 1/10th the amount of 
money to produce as in the past (vinyl vs. CD's are what I'm comparing 
here.)  Is that how you treat your customer base?

Looking at today, is Apple losing money having all those servers and 
paying for all that bandwidth to sell tracks one track at a time?? 
Doesn't seem like it. :)

And how about the DJ/Producer who:
1. Sells his tracks on iTunes/Beatport/Amazon/etc.
2. Blogs about his performances/gigs, including serving up his mixes for 
download, as well as talking about the other releases out there 
that are driving his soul at this time while also getting a cut of sales 
he links to for these tracks and his own on iTunes/Beatport/Amazon/etc.

There's a fellow I know from the digital music business named Gerd Leonhard http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=502410383&ref=ts

His recent thesis is that "blogs" (whatever that means) are the new music labels.  While I like Gerd a lot, I think he's dead wrong here.  

The problem is that there are  not going to be "new" record labels.  The entire concept of a big record label as an organization that promotes music and produces and distributes the copies is simply dead.    As you've said, the ability to produce and distribute nearly free copies (bandwidth does cost something) eliminates most of that aspect of what the labels used to do.   But the changes underway are not just about the means of production of copies.

The ability to search algorithmically, i.e. google, largely eliminates the need to promote artists.  Instead the prospective audience will simply search for and find the artists they are interested in based on hot phrases or terms that will be passed via social networks.  Algorithmic search coupled with free copies destroys every attempt to monetize aggregated or even exclusively offered "gated" content.

What you've done here that's really interesting I think is to extend the logic of these trends happeing in the marketing/distribution side to the production and especially performance side of things.  The notion of a log file being performable (yes I actually went and read your blog) is fascinating in this conext although not really a new idea in the software world.    Music is a macro?

Now I do continue to have some heartburn with the notion that a live performance is like a blog because of the above arguments about blogs and record labels, but as long as one understands that the blog (aka a recorded live concert)  is not the thing that gets monetized since it is also searchable and is infinitely reproduceable almost for free, there's really no problem here. 

Also, sort of off topic but maybe not, you might enjoy this snipet from my old boss Kai Krause:

"I used to think 'Software Design' is an art form. 
I now believe that I was half-right:
it is indeed an art, but it has a rather short half-life: 
Software is merely a performance art! 
A momentary flash of brilliance, doomed to be overtaken by the next wave, or maybe even by its own sequel. Eaten alive by its successors. And time... "

>From http://www.edge.org/q2008/q08_16.html

Keep on jamming with this...you're on the trail of something very interesting here.  IMO.

Best,

Peter

Relevant to MP3/music biz models discussion last week:

"In an MP3 world, recordings are cheap. Therefore, the whole
fundamental business model of selling recordings is completely doomed.
A business model based on expensive recordings sells recordings; a
business model based on cheap and abundant recordings gives recordings
away. This makes the body of recordings of your live musical
performances equivalent to a blog - you should be updating it all the
time. Recording your live performances should be as cheap as capturing
a log file, since distributing those recordings is as cheap as
publishing an RSS feed."

On the bandwidth argument, I'm curious about that. I think your
argument's incorrect but I'm not actually sure.

The reason I think it's incorrect is I sometimes get 10,000 hits to my
blog in a single day, if I post something controversial and/or it's a
slow day on the Internet in general, and on a month when that happens,
my image serving costs go up. But they really don't go up very far.
I've got all my image files on Amazon S3, and an expensive month is
like $2 or $3.

The reason I'm not sure is that I'm not serving mix MP3s via S3 to
equivalent traffic, and a mix MP3 is a much larger file than an image.
On the whole though I think you could probably get very cheap hosting
via S3 for large MP3s without significant problems.

The problem with the subscription model is that it still assumes the scarcity of a resource which in fact is not scarce.  The only real difference is in how you charge for access to this supposedly scarce resource.  But music is no longer scarce so there is a problem right up front.  The existing subscription services have failed in part because of the fetish of collecting music, but also because in reality there is little difference between a subscription service and a download service if they both have th emusic you want.

Also, you still need to lock your content to prevent unauthorized access to the subscription service.  This should be a warning sign that something is not quite right with your business model.  Further, assuming there is some way for me to record the content I obtain through the subscription, there is little reason for me to continue a subscription once I record everything I want.  Unless you can make the content I record self destruct again creating artificial scarcity.  These futile attempts to limit access and create artificial scarcity are all going to fail however.

I think the real way forward for the music business is something much closer and nearer and dearer to all of hearts at least on this list.  the future is in direct personal contact, in creating experiences that can't be packaged or reproduced, and which therefore can only exist in the moment in which they happen.  In other words its about raves.

Peace,

Peter

Subject: Re: [sfraves] bsp 4 programmer/dj/producer types


I agree with Ray that this is an interesting model
that carries a fundamental flaw -- though, I see the
flaw from the perspective of the artist/producer.

For starters, so-call "electronica" music is far from
free to produce.  Even by using the most thrifty
hardware-reducing methods, establishing a gear-base
that is capable of producing decent tracks easily
hovers around the $1k mark, and if you really want to
have a more refined sound that would have some
dancefloor viability, you're looking at a lot more. 
You don't need a high-end Mac Pro loaded with the
latest software to churn out tunes; you could pick up
an older synth on eBay (or your favorite garage sale)
for around $200 and probably find a hardware sequencer
in the $100 range, and then invest in a multi-track
recorder - but even at the farthest reductionist
setup, we're far from a free rig.

The next step would then be mastering of the
recording(s) to get the right kind of sound on the
floor.  If you're even done an A/B of unmastered (or
poorly mastered) tracks against something from, say,
The Exchange, then you can see the necessity of this
step.  It simply can't be skipped with this kind of
music.  Mastering houses, even the ones set up in
folks' garages and basements, don't work for free -
even if it's just a matter of looking at the cost of
the equipment, or even renting time in a pro studio. 
Add to that the cost of the engineer, and again you're
far from free, even in the most reductionist model.

The other thing that just irks me is this idea that
the art itself is valueless.  The time and effort
spent on its creation is so willingly and blindly
dismissed by the audience that it's disturbing.  No
one would argue that the Colonel should hand over a
leg-and-thigh meal for free just to appease his fans,
yet listeners are cavalier about demanding that
musicians and producers turn over their wares without
recompense, and then decry those who won't as enemies
of the "true art" who just refuse to "keep it real."

Now, does this all mean that Sony/BMG charging the
average consumer $19.95 for a 7-track CD is a fair and
accurate exchange?  No.  But you can't paint artists
or art with the same brush that you use on a
corporation.  The methods that the audience has
developed to try to punish and injure the corporate
music industry serve to destroy and kill the
independent music industry.

Thanks. Interesting things happen when an old idea to some people is a

Well yeah that's almost a founding assumption. The idea is that since
it's extremely easy for people to share your work to each other at
zero cost to them your recordings should function not as product but
as documentary. I got this idea from Improv Everywhere. I don't know
what people in technology imagined the entertainment industry might
respond to things like YouTube with, but one response is Improv
Everywhere, which does weird live improv and then posts it on YouTube.
The real entertainment is in the live performance, but seeing it on
YouTube *documents* that performance. In the old days recordings
*substituted for* performances.

Gracias! I'm going to be speaking on this programmer as artist thing
in New York next weekend as part of a general talk on my music code.
I'm going to swipe that quote! Perfect timing for me there.

Bandwidth pricing varies widely as does the method by which you are charged.  Often one is charged for peak usage for example.  Under the peak pricing model off peak incremental bandwidth is essentially free.  For example, Live365 charges for guaranteed peak hour access to popular streams as a way of shifting listeners to offf peak hours.  

Also depending on what you are serving, the quality of service may matter.  Streaming live events for example has more stringent QoS requirements than servings static media files.  Also, you'll see service providers start changing the rules on you if you actually start moving a lot of data.  Read the fine print!

Best,

Peter

On the bandwidth argument, I'm curious about that. I think your
argument's incorrect but I'm not actually sure.

The reason I think it's incorrect is I sometimes get 10,000 hits to my
blog in a single day, if I post something controversial and/or it's a
slow day on the Internet in general, and on a month when that happens,
my image serving costs go up. But they really don't go up very far.
I've got all my image files on Amazon S3, and an expensive month is
like $2 or $3.

The reason I'm not sure is that I'm not serving mix MP3s via S3 to
equivalent traffic, and a mix MP3 is a much larger file than an image.
On the whole though I think you could probably get very cheap hosting
via S3 for large MP3s without significant problems.

Shawn Fanning was never the Robin Hood of music that some imagined him to be.  That was me ;)

And it is worth mentioning that his new all legal venture Sno-Cap didn't fair that well and was recently sold to Imeem for substantially less than the original investment into the company.  Sno-cap was legal, and maybe "cooler", but not successful.

Peter

That reminds me. . . Have you guys seen the VW commercial where the founder of Napster says "and Legal is cooler?"

That was def. a TV moment to remember for me.

The only real difference is in how you charge for access to this supposedly scarce resource.  But music is no longer scarce so there is a problem right up front.  The existing subscription services have failed in part because of the fetish of collecting music, but also because in reality there is little difference between a subscription service and a download service if they both have th emusic you want.

Also, you still need to lock your content to prevent unauthorized access to the subscription service.  This should be a warning sign that something is not quite right with your business model.  Further, assuming there is some way for me to record the content I obtain through the subscription, there is little reason for me to continue a subscription once I record everything I want.  Unless you can make the content I record self destruct again creating artificial scarcity.  These futile attempts to limit access and create artificial scarcity are all going to fail however.

I think the real way forward for the music business is something much closer and nearer and dearer to all of hearts at least on this list.  the future is in direct personal contact, in creating experiences that can't be packaged or reproduced, and which therefore can only exist in the moment in which they happen.  In other words its about raves.

Peace,

Peter

I think this is an extremely important point which is extremely
under-represented in the general dialogue.

Unfortunately, my answer there would piss so many people off
simultaneously in so many different ways that I can't even hint at it
right now.

Yeah, but didn't Radiohead come away with around $5 on average for their 
"pay what you want" downloaded album recently?  If true, do you suppose 
they were upset with their sales?  Do you suppose they covered their up 
front (amortized equipment), studio time, creation time, etc. costs?

It is worth mentioning that a lot of people contributed to the psychedelic interfaces and algorithms of Meta's products altough Kai always gets all the credit for these things.  I'll mention Ben Weiss on algorithms and Phil Clevenger for interfaces in particular.  Phil's now at Adobe and did the interface for their new pro photgraphy tool.  

I also never saw Kai consume any substance stronger than wine, but he did tell me that he lived in the Haight for a while and played with oil projection etc. when he was younger.  For the record.

PS I am going to quote you, "The real entertainment is in the live performance, but seeing it on

Well yeah that's almost a founding assumption. The idea is that since
it's extremely easy for people to share your work to each other at
zero cost to them your recordings should function not as product but
as documentary. I got this idea from Improv Everywhere. I don't know
what people in technology imagined the entertainment industry might
respond to things like YouTube with, but one response is Improv
Everywhere, which does weird live improv and then posts it on YouTube.
The real entertainment is in the live performance, but seeing it on
YouTube *documents* that performance. In the old days recordings
*substituted for* performances.

Gracias! I'm going to be speaking on this programmer as artist thing
in New York next weekend as part of a general talk on my music code.
I'm going to swipe that quote! Perfect timing for me there.

Kai is a really smart and entertaining guy, arguably a true visionary of what comptuers might one day become, a  fun dinner companion, a drinker and sharer of fine wines, and also atleast at the time was an absolutely nightmare-ish boss from hell.   My very first exec team meeting at MetaTools included a near fist fight between Kai and then CEO John Wilczak with me sitting directly in between them.  Hmm, maybe I should have been taking acid.  

Which brings me to one of my life mottos: 

"Dinner and software don't mix."

Best,

Peter

There's a lot of conflicting information out about that actually.

E.g. http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/the_web/article2817679.ece 
http://www.afterdawn.com/news/archive/11782.cfm
http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/03/28/will_page_1000_fans/

etc...

No one in the industry (i.e. Ethan Kaplan from Warner mentioned in one of those links whom I know) wants to acknowledge they are already the walking dead.  The funny thing to me about Ethan's quote here is that just a few months before he was doing a record launch thing in Second Life that was attended by < 100 avatars and here he's dissing Radiohead's numbers.  I knew him when he was just a lonely blogger that was the worlds biggest fan of REM.  Now he's totally indoctrinated and spewing the party line.  Ah well...

Best,

Peter

Yeah, but didn't Radiohead come away with around $5 on average for their 
"pay what you want" downloaded album recently?  If true, do you suppose 
they were upset with their sales?  Do you suppose they covered their up 
front (amortized equipment), studio time, creation time, etc. costs?

Not unless I get to bill them. ;)

I understand the Google food is good but seriously no good software is ever designed over dinner.  And talking about software development issues during the meal often leads to indigestion.  

Just say no to discussing software during dinner!

Best,

Peter

NO WAY!  Electro-house means something different to you than it does 
to me, let alone the differences between how Europe thinks of it versus USA.

Huh.  You guys ever listen to rock music?  Nirvana, unplugged, live, 
is CRAP compared to their studio produced work.  Same goes for 
countless other bands.  I'd NEVER see Tom Petty live, because I've 
heard so many recorded shows, and the studio stuff is way 
better.  There's a few artists, like Satriani, that don't make me 
feel that way, but IMO, there's always going to be a big place for 
recorded, mastered music.

You should be slapped for decrying Nirvana's Unplugged. That was the only
Unplugged that was worth a damn, and is a top notch performance.

TAKE IT BACK or the ghost of Kurt Cobain will haunt you forever.

Really only one major disagreement here:

> The ability to search algorithmically, i.e. google, largely eliminates the need to promote artists.  Instead the prospective audience will simply search for and find the artists they are interested in based on hot phrases or terms that will be passed via social networks.  Algorithmic search coupled with free copies destroys every attempt to monetize aggregated or even exclusively offered "gated" content.

Fundamental shortcoming in the algorithmic method is that it still boils down
to how to game a popularity contest.  The music labels haven't figured it out
yet, but there's a couple TLAs you will learn soon if you don't already know
them: SEO/SEM.  If you're relying on a google-like service to find cool shit,
you're still going to end up spoon fed a very limited subset of what's there,
and some of the most brilliant artists will continue to go undiscovered for
lack of good marketing.

The entire concept of a big record label as an organization that promotes music and produces and distributes the copies is simply dead.    As you've said, the ability to produce and distribute nearly free copies (bandwidth does cost something) eliminates most of that aspect of what the labels used to do.   But the changes underway are not just about the means of production of copies.

Ah, I think Peter may understand the point I was attempting to make about
bandwidth:

On Mon, Apr 21, 2008 at 02:27:26PM -0700, dangrsmind@yahoo.com wrote:
> Bandwidth pricing varies widely as does the method by which you are charged.  Often one is charged for peak usage for example.  Under the peak pricing model off peak incremental bandwidth is essentially free.  For example, Live365 charges for guaranteed peak hour access to popular streams as a way of shifting listeners to offf peak hours.  
> 
> Also depending on what you are serving, the quality of service may matter.  Streaming live events for example has more stringent QoS requirements than servings static media files.  Also, you'll see service providers start changing the rules on you if you actually start moving a lot of data.  Read the fine print!

And the main point why blogging prices do not scale or carry forward.  THey
can do it precisely because it's so much smaller that they can shuffle you
around into the rounding error of much more expensive products.  However,
you can't build the model around this without depending on a much larger
service/product wasting the resources that you are allowed to exploit.

The rules change as you scale up to again expose the real cost.  Everything
cheap or free on the internet works on this, which is why so many cool ideas
end up shutting down later.  When they exceed the scraps falling from much
more expensive bandwidth products, they quickly find they don't have a model
for success after all.

Note, I'm not saying any of this can't work. :)  Just that it's different
than things might appear.

This is an insightful observation. It follows that bittorent (and other 
p2p services) are successful because they are able to function within the 
"rounding errors" of "free" consumer grade upstream bandwidth. The 
question is, how much revenue do these services actually pull in? 
Bittorrent.com is finally getting some paying customers, but it's still 
small potatoes compared to someone like iTunes or Amazon, I'd imagine.

My bad, you were talking about labels, napster, and the music 
industry, I thought you were talking about the music that made them 
money.  the stuff that's on the radio.  ie, not dance music.

Fair enough, google is a present example, not an end to itself.  Let's
assume that while there'll always be big money trying to buy its way into
the hearts and minds, that the main thing the internet has provided is
the real choice that they can no longer completely stifle the alternate
sounds and choices.  The undeniable advantage we're seeing is that anyone
can get some expression of their art where someone determined enough to
find it, can.

Let me look at another scenario.  I'm new.  Some guy next to me in traffic
had some choonz blasting out of his car and it was way cooler than the hip pop
I'm used to, though it still wasn't perfect to me.  I figured out it was
some techno thanks to my cellular carrier's tune identifier service, but I
got sick of that track and don't know what else to try.  Oh, I found a blog,
except like every blog, every track/artist/mix/subgenre has fans and haterz.
Exactly how am I going to explore this new style of music to know what
I'm lookin' for?  I know how to find the latest track from britneybitch,
because she said that's her name.  The rest of this stuff, am I just supposed
to spend the rest of my life downloading tracks at random from every site
I surf to?

How do I find the stuff I've never heard of, from the really great artist
who just got that first, amazing track online somewhere?  How do I know
whom to listen to for guidance?  Going to live parties, raves, etc?  well,
how do I know what party to go to?  At some point, discovery requires a
jumping off point, and it's often going to be decided by someone else's
promotion/marketing budget.

Not really sure where it's all headed, myself, though it's definitely
exciting, and yes, I am quite convinced that the traditional ability
of the music labels to control what people hear has been broken, in a
critical and irrevocable way.  Ultimately, we'll certainly figure out
something, or just be lazy and let it happen like so much else in our
culture, but either way it'll finally be an actual choice.

The entire concept of a big record label as an organization that promotes music and produces and distributes the copies is simply dead.    As you've said, the ability to produce and distribute nearly free copies (bandwidth does cost something) eliminates most of that aspect of what the labels used to do.  But the changes underway are not just about the means of production of copies.

Subject: [sfraves] Tuesday Techno Mix

http://home.tiscali.nl/fullspectrum/Steve_Rachmad_at_Outhouse_01_09_07.mp3

Steve Rachmad - Outhouse Festival - Soest NL - Sep 2007

Steve Rachmad is a globally known Dutch techno producer, DJ and  
remixer. By many, he is considered a father of Detroit techno in the  
Netherlands, respected in the world of electronic music for his deep,  
groovy sounds that tend to rest on impressive strings, melodies, funk  
and soul. His career has been reaching its highest peaks from 1996 up  
to the present time. Yet, it is somewhat less known that he has been  
in the music realms for 25 years by now.

Steve?s life story starts in Amsterdam. At the age of 12, teenage  
Steve already starts buying his first records: to mix, remix, and  
cut-and-paste their parts with an open reel tape deck. In such a  
cut-and-paste fashion, he presented his first release in the  
mid-1980s. Among these early releases was also the one created for a  
hip-house/dance artist Tony Scott.

 From that time on, Steve finds his inspiration in the 1980s dance and  
electro, works of former Time members (Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis), The  
System, Arthur Baker, to name but a few. At the age of 15, he also  
starts his DJing career with a disco set in a small Amsterdam club.  
Nevertheless, his love for music urges him to start buying equipment,  
which would later result in a professional studio that is, according  
to him, ?everything he ever dreamt of having.? Today, his equipment is  
mainly analogue, providing him with a chance to explore the realms of  
warm, alive, non-static sounds. He laid the corner stone of this  
collection in 1985, by getting a TR-808.

A year later, Steve gets introduced to the house music. His attention  
is captured by the new sounds echoing mostly from Detroit and Chicago,  
i.e. by the work of artists such as Mr. Fingers and Derrick May.  
Following their style, Steve?s own style takes a new direction. He is  
soon to be found releasing for artists like Darren Emerson and Derrick  
May.

The incoming years are to be marked by numerous successful releases on  
labels such as 100% Pure, Underwater, Fragile, M-Plant, Tresor, etc.  
He also made a significant number of remixes, signed under various  
pseudonyms. Among Steve?s most respected releases is certainly his  
album ?Secret Life of Machines,? which came out in 1996 under his  
pseudonym Sterac, and is up to this date considered as one of the  
all-time techno classics. About the same time his DJing path starts  
rapidly evolving as well. Until today, Steve shares his talent with  
the crowds all over the World. He occasionally spins disco and  
electro, but mainly techno.

Of all the fictitious names he used throughout his career to sign his  
productions, the ones that remained until today are Sterac, Ignacio,  
Dreg, Parallel 9, Adverse Match and Sterac Electronics. They appear on  
labels like Music Man, CLR, Jericho, Sino, etc. Steve also runs three  
labels of his own: Scorp, Ion, and an electro label Interpersonal  
//XP. The history of remixes continues into the present, including a  
variety of people, such as the Advent, Vince Watson, Kanzleramt, Mark  
Broom, Chris Liebing, etc. In the latest years, next to his  
characteristic techno sound, he also actively focuses on electro,  
stripping it down to the old-school feel. His latest Sterac  
Electronics remix of the vocal track Love Sweet Love (by Clashing  
Egos), and the ?Night Heat? release on Music Man Records have ended up  
in the record bags of a wide variety of artists, from techno, to  
minimal, house and electro. He re-confirms his sterac againreputation  
as an artist with exquisite ear for technical qualities of sound,  
always returning to his soulful roots and maintaining the warmth of  
analogue-produced music.

Over the years, Steve lost the count of his productions and remixes.  
However, he built an oeuvre that is without a doubt of a high  
magnitude: both quality and quantity-wise. Unfortunately, his busy DJ  
schedule puts a limit on the time he would like to spend in his  
studio. Yet, he strives for the balance that would satisfy his  
enormous artistic appetite and potential. His devotion to his dreams  
and inspirations drives him safely into the successful future.

Word of mouth has always been the only effective means of advertising. I
cite whole foods, who have never run a single television commercial but have
experienced consistent explosive growth for over a decade. Get your little
obsessed mooklings to make a lifestyle out of your shit, and get them to go
proselytize to all their mookly friends. Thats how the music industry works
anyway. Everything else is just gloss.

As for the rest of this stuff, am I just supposed

"The rest of this stuff, am I just supposed
to spend the rest of my life downloading tracks at random from every site
I surf to?"

No that's what you trained monkey slaves are for.  You did get yours right?  Serioulsy, this is precisely why you'll use a search algorithm to help you...

"How do I find the stuff I've never heard of, from the really great artist
who just got that first, amazing track online somewhere?  How do I know
whom to listen to for guidance?  Going to live parties, raves, etc?  well,
how do I know what party to go to?  At some point, discovery requires a
jumping off point, and it's often going to be decided by someone else's
promotion/marketing budget."

You do need to start somewhere, and there is no guarantee that you won't start somewhere lame or with a site that's simply hijacked your keywords.  This is a well known problem in collaborative filtering and web search.  There are a number of ideas for solutions, for example by leveraging your social network.  OK, if you are a clueless loser with no friends you are still going to be fucked.  Get off the Internet and go outside.

But once you find something good out there you can immediately leverage the fact that a machine has searched uncountably many webpages to find the similar ones with the exact terms "french electro dubstep porn rock" or whatever.  If you really needed to find the Belgian variety, the search engine could simply expand your search geographically or by language.  There are standard methods of expanding searches, i.e. by secondary key word patterns, language/country of origin, author, date/time, location, etc. Seasoned searchers do all of this themselves since Google doesn't automate all of this for you yet.  And BTW when I say automate here I mean to include any algorithm that uses inference of patterns from user clickstream data so its not all about pure algorithmic recommendation and selection...

"Not really sure where it's all headed, myself, though it's definitely
exciting, and yes, I am quite convinced that the traditional ability
of the music labels to control what people hear has been broken, in a
critical and irrevocable way.  Ultimately, we'll certainly figure out
something, or just be lazy and let it happen like so much else in our
culture, but either way it'll finally be an actual choice."

With robots and algorithmic agents to help us, we can be totally lazy couch potatos and get exactly what we want exaclty when we want it.  

Plus you can have sex with robots.  'Nuff said.

Best,

Peter

That was the album that made me actually respect Nirvana...I thought it was 
genius. Well done? Not exactly what I would call stellar as far as "tight" 
performances, but they showed another side which allowed us all access to 
the dynamic side of them.

Now if you say the LL Cool J unplugged was hgorrible because LL had clumps 
of white deoderant hanging out of his armpit hair throughout the majority of 
the performance, I could understand that, lol.

I wanted to test out my new audio interface so I whipped up this track last
night, and I think it turned out kind of nice. "Astral" a spaced-out techno
track, was produced on my hardware setup and recorded live in one take in my
home studio here in Alameda.
If you want to check it out, you may download the mp3 at
http://www.divshare.com/download/4322451-e3b or you can listen to it on my
myspace page - www.myspace.com/chelcfaithmusic

That's all, just wanted to share. =)

And, it might help if *I* read the whole story.  Seems the researchers' 
findings were due to problems in THEIR equipment.

Other reasearch I found indicated, at least in the SF Bay area (M.V.) 
that, through investigating level 2 through level 7 packets, Comcast 
wasn't throttling.

Apologies.

An addition.  According to the person who apparently originally 
discovered the RST interference, it's still happening:
http://torrentfreak.com/bittorrent-comcast-love-not-080329/

I actually wouldn't mind the telcos returning to the public coffers all 
that money they got for infrastructure buildout and then allow them to 
do whatever the hell they want with "their" network, since "they" would 
have actually paid for it in that situation.  Until then....

I wanted to test out my new audio interface so I whipped up this track last
night, and I think it turned out kind of nice. "Astral" a spaced-out techno
track, was produced on my hardware setup and recorded live in one take in my
home studio here in Alameda.
If you want to check it out, you may download the mp3 at
http://www.divshare.com/download/4322451-e3b or you can listen to it on my

That's all, just wanted to share. =)

This is my $.02 on the thread and a quick (not very rave related) BSP at 
the bottom if you want to skip to that:

Having had an interest in techno, electronic music in general and 
stochiastic/intelligent computer composed work since the late 80s, I've 
been following this thread, writing half responses over and over and then 
not sending them.  Mostly cause the fact of the matter is that producers / 
artists SHOULD be able to recover monies for their copyrighted works, just 
as film staff, jingle writers and authors and all those others should.  
The solutions are disgusting for many people, they lie in either ethics or 
enforcement (legal, corporate or both), and neither one is all that 
appealling.  If something costs me $1,000,000 to make, and I just have 2 
million fans pick it up for free, I'm kinda fucked if I was banking on a 
third of them paying a few buycks each.  Some projects will never make 
money touring the way they can in the studio (at least by the "old" 
model).  Tours like Pink Floyd's "The Wall" were a horrible money sink, 
they were fueled by album sales and licensing.  All this stuff about "evil 
record labels" and anti-corporate sentiment is like justifying stealing 
gum from Walmart.  It's still wrong.  It's just less wrong than stealing 
from your sister, or your neighbor cause Walmart are unmitigated bastards.

I really think the live model is good, I love music performed.  The 
frustrating thing about that is it sucks for live techno.  I've seen more 
"Live PAs" than most people, and they tend to be either horribly dishonest 
(aka cheerleading over a bunch of half plugged in gear while a DAT plays) 
or just plain boring to watch.  I've played off laptops, piles of gear, 
various mixes of the above, and after a long time experimenting I've sorta 
realized that the most fun on both sides of the 4th wall seems to be this 
weird interface called "a guitar", working with other tone generators 
called "band members" with a beer stained hand copied setlist that usually 
only gets followed for the first song or two.  No, it's not techno, but 
it's obviously live, fun, and visceral as all fucky.

I still play live pa's of my techno, but it's honestly frustrating when 
the best compliments you get are "wow, that was really good for a laptop 
dj set" (do they have any idea I wrote every single note of this shit?).

That said... my band (the Lag) is playing Thursday in SF if you want to 
come say hi or check it out or whatever.  Info below my sig.

san francisco, California 94103
9pm - $5.00 - AIDS Lifecycle Benefit

THIS IS NOT A DRILL!!!

In what might be our last set as a two piece; we're digging into our top 
secret amory*, arming the megaton love bombs and leaving a foreboding 
mushroom cloud with over 500 ppm of hallucinogenic/radioactive particles 
in the air for our devoted fans to inhale.

Also debuting some new material that we've been having a blast playing, so 
the fun factor and freshness should be turned on full blast. Get there at 
9pm sharp, we're on first and this place doesn't go very late.

Hmm.  I wasn't advocating stealing music from anyone.  But lets face it, stealing from the RIAA labels is at least ironic justice if not actually  justified.  After all they steal the music in many cases themselves.  E.g. http://archive.salon.com/tech/feature/2000/06/14/love/print.html#  and http://www.internet-defense.org/John-Deep_Piracy_by_RIAA_Agents

A more recent example of the RIAA fucking the artists with a little help from their friends:  http://gizmodo.com/352762/riaa-wants-to-cut-artist-royalties-to-9-apple-wants-them-at-4-artists-just-want-to-eat 

Plus they are simply fucks in general.  E.g.

http://www.boingboing.net/2006/04/23/riaa-sues-family-tha.html
http://news.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/04/18/1233227
etc.

And I could list a hundred more examples of their foulness.

Still I wasn't trying to encourage anyone to steal from these people although that might appear to be their karma.  That would be both wrong and illegal.

Rather I am suggesting that we simply don't do business with them.  Never, ever.  Don't buy what they are selling.  Instead buy direct from artists and small labels only and buy major label music used if you must.  This is neither illegal nor unethical.  Its merely smart consumerism and probably good business if you are in the industry yourself.

Trying to inflate the price of a good or service by creating artificial scarcity only works until it doesn't.  Oh, BTW remember this one?   http://www.cdfreaks.com/news/RIAA-price-fixing-settlement-delivers-dud-CDs-to-libraries.html Ya just gotta love these guys...

Anyway those days are over (for better or worse) in the music business.   I listen to music for free all day long and none of it or almost none of it is from any RIAA related label.  I don't need to nor want to steal their music.  That's why they now want to tax everyone's Internet service instead.  (http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/03/28/the-music-tax-details-of-the-plan-they-dont-want-you-to-know/) $5 per month for music you didn't even buy or listen to? Whom exactly is stealing from whom here? 

The current fuss and ruckus from the industry about people stealing music is truly  "a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing."  And the lawsuits and vile legislation proposals are merely the sounds of loudly dying dinosaur.  Game over.  The consumer and the Internet has won.

Therefore, in almost all cases artists will be better served by working within rather than against the new paradigm and exploring new ideas and possibilities.   Of course those giant royalty advances from the big labels are tempting...

IMO, YMMV.

Best,

Peter

PS Will there be a giant inflatable pig at this so called rock music performance?  If not, why not?

And to tie two thread emails together, "In 2002, a lone programmer

Heh, good call on that one. SHITTY SHITTY SHITTY day today for me. Car got
towed last night while I was in new volunteer orientation at St. Francis,
fucking seven hundred bucks to get it out which leaves me broke. And that's
not even the tip of the iceberg when it comes to my problems at the moment.

I am, however, still sober as a mormon judge coming home from church on a
sunny Sunday in Utah.

This is because I am better than you. (j/k)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] robot dick (electro)

Shawn Allen (Shazbot, of the Fingermonsters) and I have a track all about robot sex, which is also electro.  It's gonna come out (with a FiMo remix) a little later this year on Monsta.

It's a lot more "big room sky's falling ahhhh I am so high" than that one, though.  Anyway, just concurring that sexual robot stuff is good electro lyric fodder.

Shawn Allen (Shazbot, of the Fingermonsters) and I have a track all about robot sex, which is also electro.  It's gonna come out (with a FiMo remix) a little later this year on Monsta.

It's a lot more "big room sky's falling ahhhh I am so high" than that one, though.  Anyway, just concurring that sexual robot stuff is good electro lyric fodder.

My car got towed, sold at auction, and they're also going after me for 
$2k in storage fees. :(  Bullshit!

ouchie... how long did you leave it there?  impound is supposed to be
like $50/day, and you get like 30 or 60 days to get it out before
they auction... thought this was all over the week, not the last couple
of months?  Last pos I got towed, I just signed over to them and walked
away, would've cost more money than th car was worth to get it back.

even if I weren't nearly broke it would be a lot of money for the line ups
this year.  I'd rather save the money for something like DEMF or save up
longer and go to SONAR, lots of better festivals and concerts than coachella
out there for my entertainment dollar.

I went last year. Its fun, but a typical mix of rock/indie/dance LA  
types. make sure you take some time to see the sights (Joshua Tree,  
etc). Really pretty part of the world.

You think?

I think they're boring as all hell.  And this is from someone
who owns all of their albums and 12"s.  Definitely need to be
"on" something for this one.

Really? I was sober as a judge when I saw them. But then there were like 30
motherfuckers up there in addition to just the two Thievery Corp guys. . .
Maybe I just caught one of their good nights.

Re:  Grateful Dead Archives Given to UCSC

It is a thrill to write to tell you that the surviving members of the  
iconic rock 'n' roll band, the Grateful Dead, have selected the UCSC  
Library as the permanent home for their substantial archive of  
materials documenting the band's history. The collection will be the  
largest donation ever made to the library's Special Collections  
Department, and it includes more than 2,000 square feet of  
memorabilia, artifacts, and other documents. This incomparable  
archive will undoubtedly become a major resource for research related  
to the Grateful Dead, the phenomenon of the Deadheads, American  
music, and popular culture during the last three decades of the 20th  
century.

The formal announcement of this gift will be made this morning at a  
press conference to be held at the Fillmore in San Francisco, a  
singularly appropriate venue where the band performed many times.  
Chancellor Blumenthal will be present to accept the archive on behalf  
of the campus, and he will be joined by Grateful Dead band members  
Bob Weir and Mickey Hart.

UCSC has a long tradition of academic interest in the Grateful Dead.  
Fred Lieberman, professor of music, teaches a course on the band, and  
he has also collaborated with Mickey Hart on two books, Planet Drum  
and Drumming at the Edge of Magic. It was through Professor Lieberman  
that we first became aware of the search for a home for the archive.

The Library will be raising funds to support the processing and  
preservation of the archive, and, as work on it begins, we will  
provide regular updates on our web site.

The press conference, which will begin at 11 a.m., will be streamed  
live on the web. You can access it via a link on the UCSC home page;  
a press release, providing more information about this substantial  
gift, will also be posted there at that time.

Heh. In most cases I would tend to agree... but if you ever find
yourself on a freakout hell-ride acid trip and need something to calm
down quick, and your only two choices are the GD and milk... the GD will
yield better results.

But yeah, the communist came correct on this one. Under any other
circumstances, GD sucks balls.

Well, since all of my acid trips are in the past, and I made it through even
the hell-ride bad motherfuckers without any assistance from Mr. Garcia, the
Grateful Dead are officially useless to me.

Long as we're talking personal preferences here... Jeff Harrington's
album "Obliterature" makes me feel pretty damn loopy. (Funny thing is,
that album is ambient electronic so this post might actually qualify as
rave-related.)=20

It's not really scary like Gibby Haynes circa 1982... but it leaves you
feeling like you went around too many times on the merry-go-round if you
know what I mean...

Subject: [sfraves] Wed night review

So like Ms Seraphim is like 1 of my oldest closest Homegirl Sista's in
like forever now & apparently she's been hiding back here in the Bay Area
for the past month now working & doing gigs on the sly here since she's
back here from NYC... grrr... I didn't even know & well.. anywaze... I
found out she was here through Sleazemore & that she was spinning @ his
new monthly @ Vessel in the City!! So YAY!!  But like Seraphim like hella
AIMed me yesterday & told me, even though i knew & I wanted to surprise
her, but i told her i know already, but to throw her off, I told her i got
a Ben Aflect facelift, but when it healed i looked like Tom Cruise, 'cause
i mean... i wanted to surprise her!

Anywaze, got to Vessel around like 7:45ish.. & there was this like Trunk
show there... i met 1 of hte designers @ her ummm... clothing section &
Wow... mondo yummy stuff, like all this graph art in Chinesse Characters &
kinda Animie-ish kinda looking stuff on shirts & jackets!!  Loved it!!

Then around like 9ish, Sleazemore & HELLO 2DAY... SERAPHIM showed up &
like seriously... we talk like crazy.. it was Awesome!!!  Oh oh oh.. lol..
the 1st thing she said to me was that I didn't look like Tom Cruise... lol
Oh yeah... so I'm not sure how long this place has been open, but there
was this happy hour (literally an hour) of free Saphire gin mixed
drinks... so i had some... WOW!!!  Really YUmmy actually...

After the Trunk clothing people left, there was a few heads that stuck
around & a few more that showed up while i was there... but yeah... it was
fun meeting new people!!! :)

So when they finally got on the decks, they were all Electro-ie & stuff...
it was fun!!  Oh yeah.. there was this girl, ummm, forgot her name, who
was a GoGo Dancer turned 9-5 business executive which was Awesome!!  She's
a CooL Chica & we're suppose to hang out alot & go dancing!

Unfortunately, i couldn't stay all too long to see Drop The Lime's set :( 
I left around 10:30-ish ';cause i seriously had to get home & well... not
have a gypsy raver adventure 'cause i wasn't really feeling it last night
& totally like felt this mondo need to be home for like some reason.

OK.. riding the bart & taking a bus home & waiting @ the gas station where
my Uncle works graveyard for my dad to like pick me up.. so not fun!!!  I
mean... yeah... lol.. hello 2Day... i hella had to admit to my Uncle Benji
that I was drunk 'cause i mean... yeah... grrrr...

BUt it was a Groovy night!!!  Vessel is a cute lil spot like totally
hidden, so if
know where ummm.. Campton St is... it's 85 Campton!!  But yeah... nice
staff, & well... that whole free drinks between 9-10, that was just bonus
man!  YAAAY!!! :)

Subject: [sfraves] dj jelo RIP :(

All,

I think some on the list might know Jeff Elo who lived here during the Internet boom years and DJed hereabouts under the name Jelo for a bit.  

He was mostly known for his driving progressive house sets and he played at parties such as the Qool at 111 Minna, some crazy nights at Jelly's, etc.

Just heard he died in Australia possibly due to an overdose of GHB.

Be careful out there kids and keep safe.

Peace,

Peter

PS Please note that there is/was more than one DJ Jelo.  Don't get confused!

Subject: [sfraves] dj jelo RIP :(

All,

I think some on the list might know Jeff Elo who lived here during the Internet boom years and DJed hereabouts under the name Jelo for a bit.  

He was mostly known for his driving progressive house sets and he played at parties such as the Qool at 111 Minna, some crazy nights at Jelly's, etc.

Just heard he died in Australia possibly due to an overdose of GHB.

Be careful out there kids and keep safe.

Peace,

Peter

PS Please note that there is/was more than one DJ Jelo.  Don't get confused!

Subject: [sfraves] [BSP] APO live @ 222 Hyde on Saturday

APO = Andrew Phelan & Origami

The Sound = Live bass, keyboards + decks, house of all stripes

222 Hyde = My favorite teeny club

Saturday = The day all of the house-enjoying folks on SFR truck they asses down to see us.

And the weekend is solved!  Whoot.

..but seriously, this one should be off the hook.  Being that it's in SF, in a dark basement, we can all pretend this is totally RR.

[ K O N T R O L ]

minimal techno + avant house
every 1st Saturday at The Endup


featuring from Madrid, Spain:

ALEX UNDER   ** 2 hour live PA **

Plus 8 . Trapez . CMYK Musik . Apnea

The last time Alex Under played for us, his intense aural onslaught
had the Endup crowd going absolutely mental, and prompted
resident Alland Byallo to name it in an online interview as the best
live PA he's ever seen.  We are therefore supremely excited to
welcome this talented young producer and label owner back for
another sweat-soaked dancefloor pummeling before he heads to
Detroit for a headlining set at this year's DEMF.


and from Stockholm, Sweden:

AGARIC aka PATRIK SKOOG  ** 2 hour live PA **

We Are . Leibe*Detail . Drumcode . Syndikaat

Patrik Skoog began producing in the 90's, originally focusing on
a harder techno sound which brought him global notoriety.
These days he goes by Agaric, an alias with which he delves into
the slower, deeper realms of techno and house.  With over a
decade of production experience and more than 100 vinyl
releases to his name, his extended live performance is sure to
excite chin-strokers and rug-cutters alike.


plus special guest:

MYLES EGNER   ( s.w.a.t . platform . tweekin' )

with resident DJs:

NIKOLA BAYTALA   ( robsoul . junior boys own . s.w.a.t. )
SAMMY D   ( classic . dirtybird . utensil )
CRAIG KUNA   ( platform . esdjco )

ALEX UNDER  (aka Friendly People, Musica Charlista)

The deepest meaning of 'collage', defined by Max Ernst, is the general
application of Arthur Rimabaud's 'delirium': "I accustomed myself to simple
hallucination; I saw quite deliberately a mosque instead of a factory, a
drummer's school conducted by angels, carriages on the highways of the sky,
a salon at the bottom of a lake: monsters, mysteries, a vaudeville poster
raising horrors before my eyes."  We could describe collage as an alchemic
compound of two or more heterogeneous elements, derivate by their unexpecte=
d
approximation generated deliberately by the search of systematic confusion
and distorted perception.

That's Alex Under's musical universe. Based in Madrid, this producer is the
'CMYK' label manager. He is also one of the men behind 'Apnea' and
'Bemysheep', and one of the founders of Net28 (the network behind these
labels and others like 'CyclicalTracks' and 'Pulpa'). Alex Under confirmed
himself as the new reality of the best international techno, sometimes bein=
g
minimal and deep, sometimes hard and aggressive, but always original. He
creates a sonic collage combining techno, trance and house elements while h=
e
constructs complex rhythms that arise from the dancefloor, taking the
listeners to a higher level where emotions, depth, mind & body blend in a
unique equation. Alex Under will intrigue beyond your perception.

AGARIC  (aka Patrik Skoog, Headroom)

After working together with Niklas Ehrlin and Henrik Larsson on their main
and well known project in the 90's, Headroom, Patrik Skoog began a solo
project, darker and more tribal-techno influenced in comparison to the
collaborations.  After releasing the first output on German and American
labels, he then decided to set up Native Diffusion records for these type o=
f
tracks.  This focused mainly on Patrik's own productions, but also showcase=
d
remixes from the likes of Damon Wild, W.J. Henze, Inigo Kennedy, Slobodan,
Takaaki Itoh & Hardcell. As of 2003 and 2004 other talent started to appear
on the label as well, respected producers and newcomers to the techno scene
alike.  2004 also saw Headroom=B4s debut release on the classic New York-la=
bel
Synewave getting licensed to the "Exhibitionist" CD and DVD compilation,
compiled and mixed by world renowned DJ Jeff Mills, and as the popularity o=
f
their style of techno increased over the last years, remix offers also
dropped in frequently. Patrik did one for fellow Swede Adam Beyer on his no=
w
classic Drumcode imprint, which shortly thereafter lead to more releases on
Drumcode, and its sublabel Truesoul.

Being a technical DJ with great sense for momentum and track selection,
Skoog has played and continues to play praised gigs in the US, UK, North-
and South America and all across Europe. In early 2005 a new project was
found in "Agaric" where he explores the slower, deeper realms of techno and
house and with productions on his well-received label project named "We
Are". As Agaric, Patrik has gained appreciation from high-ranking peers, an=
d
fans have seen a big change in performances as well as track work, where he
evolves further and further away from playing the typical "hard" sound for
which he was known, and more often than not performs a deeper variety of
tracks that hints at a modern take on early influences like Robert Hood,
Wolfgang Voigt. and Plastikman, still with high intensity and groove. In
2006, the Native Diffusion label was put on ice, ending after six years at
number 19 in the series, and Patrik started to perform live acts all over
the world with the Agaric project--premiering at one of the leading
festivals for innovative electronic music in the Nordic countries, Public
Service.

In 2007, nearly a decade after his debut on the Loop label and over one
hundred vinyl releases later, Agaric relocated to and got involved in the
ever-evolving electronic music scene in Berlin, Germany, where he now
resides.  His highly-anticipated appearance at [KONTROL] will be one of onl=
y
a handfull of North American performances, including stops in NYC, LA,
Chicago and Detroit.

MYLES EGNER

Myles Egner grew up in a small town in Iowa and was turned on to the "futur=
e
house sound of Chicago" at a young age.  By age 14 he started mixing with
his brother DJ Rin, playing deep house and ghetto house while attending
warehouse parties in Chicago on the weekends and being influenced by people
like Gene Farris, Paul Johnson, DJ Traxx, and  DJ Funk.

After moving to SF in '94, Myles linked up with S.W.A.T. (Nikola Baytala,
Kwai le Chief, and DJ Rasoul), sat in on studio sessions whenever there was
an empty seat, and soon found himself a resident at their long-running
Friday night weekly at SF's legendary house club The Top.  Over the years
Myles has moved away from and returned to SF several times, working in four
different record stores along the way: Housewares (SF), Aaron's Records and
Beat Non Stop (LA), and most recently Tweekin' Records (SF). His many hours
logged in these shops gave him the opportunity to soak in boundless
influences and of course pick up an arsenal of heaters, from house to
minimal to hard techno.  His uncontested skills behind the decks have lande=
d
him gigs alongside talent including Kenny Larkin, Octave One, Boo Williams,
K. Alexi, Christian Bloch, JPLS, and more.

Myles is currently making a mark on the Bay Area techno scene as a resident
at Platform, Bureau, and Wish, where he can always be counted on to bring a
unique style of "beating the box".  Be it house, minimal, or banging techno=
,
this talented young man is surely one to look out for.

http://sanfrancisco.tribe.net/listing/Biodiesel-Babe-for-Sale/san-francisco-ca/8682e7ca-26e5-4b0a-8fd0-88f2bae97e2b


here's a pic of it

http://images.tribe.net/tribe/upload/photo/dbf/de2/dbfde2d7-ca1e-485e-8a63-4362cdc2b7d2

         Babe, my trusty big blue 1984 biodiesel beast of a Suburban is for  
sale.   
 
She runs well, can fit 5 people plus gear easily, and has room  
for  a queen size futon in the back, making her an ideal vehicle for  
festivals or hauling stuff around.  She gets between 15-20 mi/gallon.  
While she has a few cosmetic blemishes and quirks, she is a pleasure to  
drive and always brings a smile to my face.  I will be sad to see her  
go, so would love to keep her in the family and to someone committed to  
using bio.  Asking $2000. 
 
Please feel free to contact me if you would like to see her or have  
questions. 
 
Cory

I have no idea who this person is, but I would personally have to place

restaurants along the road for used oil... sort of the mad max nomadic
thing. :)

So DJ Mick must have been an SFR harvester?  Got stuff from him too. 
But I also contacted his hosting co. (system-admin@inmotionhosting.com),

Oh, I'm also actually not so sure I'd believe the DJ Seven excuse.  It's 
just too convenient to blame it on someone else.

They wouldn't go for that option.  Went there in person as soon as I was
notified (at the $500 point; tow fee + storage) but they wouldn't take

Long as we're talking personal preferences here... Jeff Harrington's
album "Obliterature" makes me feel pretty damn loopy. (Funny thing is,
that album is ambient electronic so this post might actually qualify as
rave-related.) 

It's not really scary like Gibby Haynes circa 1982... but it leaves you
feeling like you went around too many times on the merry-go-round if you
know what I mean...

I would disagree, that would push me right over the edge. 

Now Zappa or the Butthole Surfers - they are what I wanna hear while I
am frying tits on the LSD. Or rather, what I woulda listened to - I quit
taking the 'cid. Bad for the ol' cranial bits.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] BSP: This week on KZSU - DJ Seven

Does it matter if he did it or someone he hired did?  He is
responsible for his employees, especially if they are signing
crap with his name attached.

Regardless of how long it's been, his SPAM left a bad taste in
my mouth.  ;)  Has he made any public apologies or amends to
the community?  I was once toying with the idea of getting
people to go out to one of his gigs and pelting him with
single-slices of spam.

Subject: [sfraves] bsp: Archaeopteryx - creating music with code - video presentation 4 programmers

I went to New York on Saturday and did a presentation for programmers
about my laptop-set system Archaeopteryx. It comes very much from the
programmer point of view, not the DJ/producer point of view.

There's a very short video where I demo live-coding drum and bass:

http://vimeo.com/947877

and a very long video of the presentation:

Subject: [sfraves] WR: Family, Fanu, & Cheese

So in the afternoon/ early evening, hungout w/ Family & had some dinner &
played alota ummmm.. Rock Band... well.. i sang for songs & like yeah.. i
didn't know i could sing them high octaves like that.. Hello 2day

Then I got over to Il Pirata for the Active Mindz shindig, they brought
out Fanu, this Mondo Yummy Jungle Producer/ DJ from Holland (1st time out
in Cali like ever) & it was pretty sick!!!  i mean.. I'll be honest, it
was another mainly all raga night & it was Dope.. i got my Groovy on as
much as poxxible, but it's hard for me to dance to raga jungle...

I mean... it was a fuckin' Groovy Hyphy ass vibe on Saturday night.. so
like I mean... fuck man... it was just good energy, balls to wall, hella
hype... everyone was hella dancing @ some point, but the dance floor was
just poundin' the whole night... when Fanu got on.... it weas sick.. i
mean.. the music went from this evil hard jungle from robin weber to like
this atmo raga spacey kinda hippy jungle from War Breakerz to like strait
hard ass raga and hip hop and breaks from SillyKid... then Fanu went on &
all hell broke loose.. I mean... he spun like diufferent sub genres of
like Raga, but every so often he dropped this like hellla fucky yummy
electro tech tune here & there & i just lost it man... & the il pirata
dance floor well... it's not that big, but it was like hella packed & I
danced soooo hard like in sections it got so hot!

Afterwards Audio1 & some other homies & i ate like @ Sparky's b4 goin' to
the "after party".... lol.. YUM... Bacon @ 3AM is just so yum!!!  A Bacon
Burger @ 3AM is double yum!!!  Hello 2day!!  Then Audio1 dropped me off @
WarBreakerz pad, but there wasn't an afterparty unfortunately.. so I kinda
just kicked it there 'til 6 something before 6:30 AM & caught Muni... liek
1 watch the ending 1/2 of BIG & the beginning 1/2 of Truman Show, then
took off :)

OK.. on Muni, like there was this homeless dude who like preaching the
word of Satan which kiiiiinda freaked me out 'cause I've been kinda
meeting all these Satan Worshipers, so Homeless Satan worshipper man
freaked me out that i did whatever i could to make my ipod louder...

When i finally got to the bart station, I kinda got into this conversation
with some guy who was Yoyoing... long story short short, after we found
out that we knew some of the same people, him & I actually did cross paths
@ Phoenix a few weeks ago & he couldn't stop talkin' about it & it was
kinda refreshing to see this random guy talk about something like I mean..
h e was still after glowin' high from Phoenix still & YAAAAY!!!

OK.. yeah... so it was a good time from start to fini!!  I hope y'all had
a Groovy night!!!  OK.. gotta finish watching Gossip Girl!!!  Love U
Ravers!!!

Wow, that's neat- I'd like a little explanation of what was being effected when you changed that parameter around (I understood the "rand" thing but not the decimal'd number).

Whoot,

Sure. The braces around the parameter and the L make it an executable
code block which gets passed around like an object. It has to evaluate
to a number between 0 and 1. That number represents a measure of
probability for each. The beat results when you send that code block
against a probability matrix, which maps each beat of each drum to a
measure of probability. So if you give the code block an actual
number, it'll filter through the probability matrix the same way every
time, resulting in a pre-sequenced beat, whereas if you give it rand -
or any code which evaluates dynamically to non-pre-determined values
between 0 and 1 -then it dynamically generates an entirely new beat
every time the code runs. (Usually every measure, every second
measure, or every fourth measure.) The probability matrix is a
meta-sequence rather than a sequence.

More simply, the code block is a fader, where 0.0 is the bottom of the
fader, 1.0 is the top of the fader, and rand is code that positions
the fader randomly somewhere between the top and the bottom. And
instead of controlling just the volume of two tracks, you're
controlling every drum in the rhythm, and of course if you want any
arbitrary pattern of fader movement - whether a repeating pattern or a
chaotic one based on nonlinear fluid dynamics - then you can have that
too. Currently it only modulates on and off for each drum, but
modulating volume is doable, and will probably happen further down the
line.

I also forgot to mention. Last week Andy W brought up the twin
questions of showmanship and user interface. The long video contains
my answers. My answer in e-mail was "muahahaha soon my robot minions
will conquer all" or something along those lines. This was not due to
random insanity. Or at least it was not *just* due to random insanity.
It was also due to the fact that I already had an answer but it takes
a lot of time to explain. And it takes even more time to make it sound
like it is in fact possible. But it is. So in the video, I explain it.
But it's a long answer. The short answer: a combination of ill science
fiction shit and Make magazine. Build drums which trigger psychedelic
video software, collect a timestamp every time somebody hits a drum,
and throw statistical AI (machine learning) at the timestamps once you
have a volume of data sufficiently large to draw conclusions from
(which in a good party should happen reasonably quickly). Use code
flexible enough that you can then choose to use that data any way you
wish. Leverage user-generated content and let the audience supply its
**own** showmanship - which back in the days before the evolution of
superstar DJs was how things were always supposed to be anyway - and
in the process collect exact information about which beats they're
responding to, and when. That's the answer for showmanship. User
interface is code, and anything else you need. The reason the answer
for showmanship is such a good answer is that it allows the answer for
user interface to be **only** about user interface.

Also, to prevent superstar DJ syndrome, which I consider a serious
toxin, you put video screens in the back which supply a feed of the
code and real-time video of the DJ. So if all you want to do is geek
out and watch a dude twist knobs, you can chill in the back and do
that while the crazy people are wigging out like they're supposed to.
(I have a kind of fundamentalist old-school attitude here. DJ worship
is the mind-killer.) The zone in the back would be some hybrid of a
chill room and an Amsterdam cafe, since the crowd that likes to geek
out would probably be into having the music quieter so they could geek
out together - you know, discussing what they see, kicking ideas
around, not just standing there staring like a pack of fucking
zombies. Trainspotters freak me out, man. You totally expect them to
be like "BRRRRAAAAINNSSSSS."

Anyway, lots of work to do.

Yeah but I don't think search really has much to do with music
business models. The Yahoo music guy, who used to run a label and do
Web design for the Beastie Boys, says bands are telling him it's all
about the blogs:

http://www.fistfulayen.com/blog/?p=198

And personally I get all my new mix MP3s from BijouBreaks.com or
http://mnmltechno.blogspot.com/ or Myspace or somewhere like this.
Social networking (blogs, podcasts, message boards, mailing lists)
pwns Google for finding new music.

the way i usually find good new music is by personal recommendation,  
or by hearing someone i know play it.  there's that social aspect to  
music that you just can't get from a cold search with google. perhaps  
as search engines evolve, that will change...

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Is keyword search about to hit its breaking point?

Or maybe search engines need to further refine things for us (and the 
RIAA) by supporting CC only types of searches.  Having one person/a 
small group of people (as Giles mentions when he speaks of blogs) be the 
prefilter for what you are made aware of probably isn't the best model.

Although, thinking of it in terms of KZSU it's actually fairly similar, 
albeit with a fairly permeable prefilter.  How THAT works is this:
1. A 1st pass is made of all incoming music, where the true dreck is 
weeded out.  (Which is sort of like the blog prefilter mentioned above. 
Main difference is that the goal is to cast the broadest net over what 
MAY be good music, simply by eliminating the obviously bad music.)
2. 2nd step is that what remains is now available for anyone on staff 
("the collective", as it were) to review.  Most likely one is going to 
have a listen to something before taking the time to review it, just so 
that one can be sure they're not wasting their time on something that 
doesn't appeal to them.
3. From those reviewed CDs, they either go into "rotation", or get filed 
directly into the main music library.

And, in the greater world, KZSU is just one of numerous non-commercial 
radio stations where a similar (although often time not as involved) 
process is taking place.  And from that greater whole we all have a 
chance to discover new music.

I know that there are other non-comms out there who have their own 
blogs (KZSU, as a station, doesn't.)  So if those blogs somehow 
represented the vetting process of each individual station, THEY would 
likely be the best source of information.  Hmmmmm.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Is keyword search about to hit its breaking point?

Blogs are searchable, no?  But I agree that blogs, or rather people's opinions as expressed in blogs, are going to be a big part of it.

Again, I'm not talking about Google as it is, I'm talking about what it should and IMO will be.  

What's coming is full semantic metadata and text search as true well "sounds like" audio search.  Add in search that includes your social network and you have the ultimate music (and many other things!) discovery engine.  

Many things are possible here. For example at Live365 we had the idea of searching based on co-placement in playlists.  Not sure if they ever implemented that idea actually, but some experiments I did showed the power of the idea.  And you can also detect when many people (considered over the domain of a social network) put the same track in their playlists.  Interesting stuff is possible from here.Sure all of this isn't going to happen overnight but it is not very far away either.

I'd have to give you a (rather ridiculous/lengthy) reading list if you want to get deeper into exactly what I am thinking about... 

BTW I tried to watch your presentation last night, but my wireless network kept gagging on it.  I was bout to go get the red emergency cable when my wife said, "I like it better when you listen to music instead of some guy talking"

So I still haven't watched to the end...but now I am at work where we have a screamingly fast Opti-man connection.

However at the risk of asking a really clueless question about your stuff, it seems you are implementing a sort of Markov process for generating music implemented using continuations?  Also is the probability matrix is static/unchanging?  Ok, I guess I should just watch the video..

Regards,

Peter

Yeah but I don't think search really has much to do with music
business models. The Yahoo music guy, who used to run a label and do
Web design for the Beastie Boys, says bands are telling him it's all
about the blogs:

http://www.fistfulayen.com/blog/?p=198

And personally I get all my new mix MP3s from BijouBreaks.com or
http://mnmltechno.blogspot.com/ or Myspace or somewhere like this.
Social networking (blogs, podcasts, message boards, mailing lists)
pwns Google for finding new music.

Ah but what if you could search personal recommendations across your social network as well as  what other people are listening to in real time?

My previous posting didn't seem to come through but it was in part an answer to this objection...

the way i usually find good new music is by personal recommendation,  
or by hearing someone i know play it.  there's that social aspect to  
music that you just can't get from a cold search with google. perhaps  
as search engines evolve, that will change...

Subject: Sad news about an RS (rhythm society) Friend


Dear Friends,

It is with a heavy heart that I bear sad tidings to the community: RS
Friend Eric Tiedemann has died.

There has been no word yet, that I have heard, regarding cause of
death; to the best of my knowledge, he was found in his home, and an
investigation is ongoing.  More details on that, along with funeral or
memorial arrangements, will be posted as they become known.  I would
respectfully request that, in the meantime, we avoid speculating about
it on the lists.

Like me, Eric was sponsored by Karin Wertheim, and has been a friend
of ours since we all attended an NE-Raves net-party in Rochester, NY,
in 1997.  It was that online electronic dance community that brought
all of us together before we slowly, each in turn, filtered our way
across the country and into the RS.  Back in those days, we used to
call him Dances With Beverages, though my mother always referred to
him as Pajamas Eric, due to his fondness for the comfort of plaid
flannel dance-wear.

Eric was the first person Karin sponsored into the RS, and with me he
was "co-heresiarch" of the RS Peninsula Meditation Group from 2005 to
2006.  He also served on the Tech Team, and co-lead Spiritual
Emergence and the Dance Ceremony for exPeRiEnce, the 2007 RS Retreat,
with Christine Benvenuto. Most recently, he led Bishops Desk for
Magic, and was kind enough to submit a copy of the Bishops Desk Binder
to the wiki so it no longer needs to be re-created for each event.

He was a man of wildly diverse interests: ecstatic dance, the
supremacy of breakbeat as a musical art form, Thelema, Buddhism, NLP,
Robert Anton Wilson, Robert Heinlein, David Deida, Nietzsche, computer
technology, entheogens, quantum theory...pure geekery of every sort,
kind, and manner, on which he could discourse at length, and in depth,
once you got him started.

Though I had lost track of him for a while after he moved from Philly
to Cali, upon reconnecting at Dance, my first ANDC in Fall'05, our
friendship resumed immediately as if the lacuna had never occurred. He
was that kind of guy; my confidant, my mentor.  Eric was a true
friend, one of those without whose generous assistance on numerous
levels I could never have taken root here.  He was my biggest fan,
encouraging and facilitating my DJing even when I thought I'd put that
well behind me.  His presence will be dearly missed, and his physical
absence keenly and palpably felt.

Eric, I miss you; I love you.

Eric S. Tiedemann, 1966-2008

Subject: [sfraves] tuesday techno mix

http://www.bodytonicmusic.com/audio/mixes/btp007_roberthood.mp3

Robert Hood is without any question one of the most important founding  
fathers of minimalism within techno. In the early nineties he helped  
launch a couple of the most influential techno labels ever:  
Underground Resistance, Axis and M-Plant. He learned the ropes from  
nobody less than Mike Banks and Jeff Mills. It didn't take long for  
Hood to set out on his own course and he made independence his  
strength. With his own label M-Plant and sublabels Drama, Duet and  
Hardwax he left an ineradicable stamp on the evolution of the techno  
sound. After carrying out his operations mainly from the shadows for  
many years Robert Hood has been on a head-on assault in the last  
couple of months. The Detroit legend has intensified his schedule of  
appearances all over the world, especially in Europe.

Robert Hood makes minimal Detroit techno with an emphasis on soul and  
experimentation over flash and popularity. Having recorded for  
Metroplex, as well as the Austrian Cheap label and Jeff Mills' Axis  
label, Hood also owns and operates the M-Plant imprint, through which  
he's released the bulk of his solo material. Hood was a founding  
member, along with Jeff Mills and Mike Banks, of the Underground  
Resistance label, whose influential releases throughout the early and  
mid '90s helped change the face of modern Detroit techno and sparked a  
creative renaissance. Infusing elements of acid and industrial into a  
potent blend of Chicago house and Detroit techno, UR's aesthetic  
project and militant business philosophy were (and remain) singular  
commitments in underground techno. Hood left Detroit (and UR) with  
Jeff Mills in 1992, setting up shop in New York and recording a series  
of 12-inch EPs . Through the mid '90s, Hood has focused on his solo  
work, setting up M-Plant in 1994 and releasing singles such as  
'Internal Empire,' 'Music Data,' and 'Moveable Parts.' Although his  
desire to remain underground has been replaced by an urge to reach a  
wider audience, Hood remains fiercely critical of artistic and  
economic movements destructive to inner-city communities and has  
combined his musical enterprises with outreach and social activist  
ends. His debut Peacefrog album 'Point Blank' took Hood's hypnotic  
minimalism to entirely new depths and territories, whilst his latest  
album 'Wire To Wire' takes his productions onto new levels of  
musicality and sophistication within the world of electronic music.

Currently enjoying something of a renaissance having just released a  
corker of a mix for Fabric as well as series of singles for Music Man,  
this mix features Hood under his Grey Area guise - an alias he uses to  
showcase his own productions and remixes and his labels catalogue from  
M-Plant, Duet, Drama, Hardwax.

This mix was recorded recently at the legendary FUSE club in Belgium.  
Thanks to Oliver at EPM for making this happen...and enjoy!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] BSP: This week on KZSU - DJ Seven


DJ Seven spammed me at an address I only used for "The DJ List".  I also 
had a friend with a generic catcher address he only used on SFR.  It's 
called harvesting, and it fucking sucks.  He's not god's gift to DJing, 
and he came on the scene with abyssmal skills spamming HARD while a lot of 
us had been slanging mixes, vinyl releases, doing it right, etc.  Sad that 
he'll likely be remembered long after a lot of people who actually brought 
something to the scene... like ya know, music.

[ K O N T R O L ]

minimal techno + avant house
every 1st Saturday at The Endup


featuring from Madrid, Spain:

ALEX UNDER   ** 2 hour live PA **

Plus 8 . Trapez . CMYK Musik . Apnea

The last time Alex Under played for us, his intense aural onslaught
had the Endup crowd going absolutely mental, and prompted
resident Alland Byallo to name it in an online interview as the best
live PA he's ever seen.  We are therefore supremely excited to
welcome this talented young producer and label owner back for
another sweat-soaked dancefloor pummeling before he heads to
Detroit for a headlining set at this year's DEMF.


and from Stockholm, Sweden:

AGARIC aka Patrik Skoog  ** 2 hour live PA **

We Are . Leibe*Detail . Drumcode . Syndikaat

Patrik Skoog began producing in the 90's, originally focusing on
a harder techno sound which brought him global notoriety.
These days he goes by Agaric, an alias with which he delves into
the slower, deeper realms of techno and house.  With over a
decade of production experience and more than 100 vinyl
releases to his name, his extended live performance is sure to
excite chin-strokers and rug-cutters alike.


plus special guest:

MYLES EGNER   ( s.w.a.t . platform . tweekin' )

with resident DJs:

NIKOLA BAYTALA   ( robsoul . junior boys own . s.w.a.t. )
SAMMY D   ( classic . dirtybird . utensil )
CRAIG KUNA   ( platform . esdjco )

ALEX UNDER  (aka Friendly People, Musica Charlista)

The deepest meaning of 'collage', defined by Max Ernst, is the general
application of Arthur Rimabaud's 'delirium': "I accustomed myself to simple
hallucination; I saw quite deliberately a mosque instead of a factory, a
drummer's school conducted by angels, carriages on the highways of the sky,
a salon at the bottom of a lake: monsters, mysteries, a vaudeville poster
raising horrors before my eyes."  We could describe collage as an alchemic
compound of two or more heterogeneous elements, derivate by their unexpecte=
d
approximation generated deliberately by the search of systematic confusion
and distorted perception.

That's Alex Under's musical universe. Based in Madrid, this producer is the
'CMYK' label manager. He is also one of the men behind 'Apnea' and
'Bemysheep', and one of the founders of Net28 (the network behind these
labels and others like 'CyclicalTracks' and 'Pulpa'). Alex Under confirmed
himself as the new reality of the best international techno, sometimes bein=
g
minimal and deep, sometimes hard and aggressive, but always original. He
creates a sonic collage combining techno, trance and house elements while h=
e
constructs complex rhythms that arise from the dancefloor, taking the
listeners to a higher level where emotions, depth, mind & body blend in a
unique equation. Alex Under will intrigue beyond your perception.

AGARIC  (aka Patrik Skoog, Headroom)

After working together with Niklas Ehrlin and Henrik Larsson on their main
and well known project in the 90's, Headroom, Patrik Skoog began a solo
project, darker and more tribal-techno influenced in comparison to the
collaborations.  After releasing the first output on German and American
labels, he then decided to set up Native Diffusion records for these type o=
f
tracks.  This focused mainly on Patrik's own productions, but also showcase=
d
remixes from the likes of Damon Wild, W.J. Henze, Inigo Kennedy, Slobodan,
Takaaki Itoh & Hardcell. As of 2003 and 2004 other talent started to appear
on the label as well, respected producers and newcomers to the techno scene
alike.  2004 also saw Headroom=B4s debut release on the classic New York-la=
bel
Synewave getting licensed to the "Exhibitionist" CD and DVD compilation,
compiled and mixed by world renowned DJ Jeff Mills, and as the popularity o=
f
their style of techno increased over the last years, remix offers also
dropped in frequently. Patrik did one for fellow Swede Adam Beyer on his no=
w
classic Drumcode imprint, which shortly thereafter lead to more releases on
Drumcode, and its sublabel Truesoul.

Being a technical DJ with great sense for momentum and track selection,
Skoog has played and continues to play praised gigs in the US, UK, North-
and South America and all across Europe. In early 2005 a new project was
found in "Agaric" where he explores the slower, deeper realms of techno and
house and with productions on his well-received label project named "We
Are". As Agaric, Patrik has gained appreciation from high-ranking peers, an=
d
fans have seen a big change in performances as well as track work, where he
evolves further and further away from playing the typical "hard" sound for
which he was known, and more often than not performs a deeper variety of
tracks that hints at a modern take on early influences like Robert Hood,
Wolfgang Voigt. and Plastikman, still with high intensity and groove. In
2006, the Native Diffusion label was put on ice, ending after six years at
number 19 in the series, and Patrik started to perform live acts all over
the world with the Agaric project--premiering at one of the leading
festivals for innovative electronic music in the Nordic countries, Public
Service.

In 2007, nearly a decade after his debut on the Loop label and over one
hundred vinyl releases later, Agaric relocated to and got involved in the
ever-evolving electronic music scene in Berlin, Germany, where he now
resides.  His highly-anticipated appearance at [KONTROL] will be one of onl=
y
a handfull of North American performances, including stops in NYC, LA,
Chicago and Detroit.

MYLES EGNER

Myles Egner grew up in a small town in Iowa and was turned on to the "futur=
e
house sound of Chicago" at a young age.  By age 14 he started mixing with
his brother DJ Rin, playing deep house and ghetto house while attending
warehouse parties in Chicago on the weekends and being influenced by people
like Gene Farris, Paul Johnson, DJ Traxx, and  DJ Funk.

After moving to SF in '94, Myles linked up with S.W.A.T. (Nikola Baytala,
Kwai le Chief, and DJ Rasoul), sat in on studio sessions whenever there was
an empty seat, and soon found himself a resident at their long-running
Friday night weekly at SF's legendary house club The Top.  Over the years
Myles has moved away from and returned to SF several times, working in four
different record stores along the way: Housewares (SF), Aaron's Records and
Beat Non Stop (LA), and most recently Tweekin' Records (SF). His many hours
logged in these shops gave him the opportunity to soak in boundless
influences and of course pick up an arsenal of heaters, from house to
minimal to hard techno.  His uncontested skills behind the decks have lande=
d
him gigs alongside talent including Kenny Larkin, Octave One, Boo Williams,
K. Alexi, Christian Bloch, JPLS, and more.

Myles is currently making a mark on the Bay Area techno scene as a resident
at Platform, Bureau, and Wish, where he can always be counted on to bring a
unique style of "beating the box".  Be it house, minimal, or banging techno=
,
this talented young man is surely one to look out for.

Nice.  Icon's a hottie...too bad she looks like she could be my
sister.  I knowns her from way back in the day.  Tell her I
said, "yo hottie, whuts up."

What are you using on your laptop?  Serato?  Traktor?

Wish I could be there - I'll probably be working still, like I
am right now...

How  awesome would Ruby Skye be if it was on 6th St... and kinda run down
like club 6, but had the same kick ass sound (minus the marina and south

You'd be wanting to go to here, where anything goes, my young 
Apprentice: http://tinyurl.com/5dhnh5

they always managed to turn a blind eye to it.

God Bless America.

Trust me on this, the Illuminati have failed because of their racism.
Although other peoples understand that the West is a slave society,
those living there do not realize it. The Illuminati do not control
China, India or now Russia. They are about to lose power. We are like
people living in Berlin before the collapse of the Berlin wall. The
Illuminati are like the Wizard of Oz; once you pull aside the curtain

Once the illusion is gone, they are just a bunch of weak old men.

- Benjamin Fulford

Subject: [sfraves] Just wanted to let any interested parties know...

It has been confirmed that Jeff Elo, DJ Jelo of SF, died from a GHB overdose in Australia.   

What is not yet known is if he was also drinking alcohol or taking anything else or whether the fact that he had been flying for a long time right before he died had any effect.  

The GHB in question apparently came from Los Angeles.

Say away from this shit kids.  One drink can kill you and sometimes it does.

Best,

Peter
