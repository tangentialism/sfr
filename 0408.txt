Subject: Re: [sfraves] SF Electronic Music Festival??

Hello all

   I went to the 2nd annual one a few years back at Cell Space
to do a write-up for a failed website and we didn't recognize
any of the names, either.  All of the artists ended up being
mainly sound-art artists, lots of noise and custom electronic
instruments...far beyond what you'd call IDM, even.  Not really
what we usually for at other electronic fests that are more well
known.  
      Despite the high noise content, don't confuse it with the
annual Noise Fest, either....take care...

Been a week behind on my reading, and just studied the article below this 
morning.  Struck a cord with me.  I think this is where things are going 
for those of us who see ourselves as "progressive" and are disenchanted 
with the old Democratic machine.

I have been active with moveon.org and other organizations described in the 
article, and it is only now that I've seen this "movement" well covered.

Love,

Wiring the Vast Left-Wing Conspiracy
By MATT BAI

Published: July 25, 2004, New York Times Magazine

Andy Rappaport made his millions as a venture capitalist,searching out what 
he calls ''ideas that change the world.'' About six years ago, for 
instance, when most everyone else in the high-tech industry thought 
wireless communication was going to depend on new, exotic semiconductors, 
Rappaport threw $2.5 million into a start-up called Atheros Communications, 
whose founders were focusing instead on building low-cost radios using 
common chip technology. It was a smart move. When the company went public 
last February, the initial investment by Rappaport and his partners was 
worth more than $60 million.

Rappaport is also, increasingly, an avid investor in liberal causes, and in 
this context he might be called a political venture capitalist. Rappaport 
and his wife, Deborah, whose philanthropic activities in recent years 
include several million dollars in donations to art museums and 
after-school music programs, have committed at least $5 million this year 
-- so far -- to support a bevy of fledgling liberal groups, like Music for 
America and Punkvoter.com, aimed at mobilizing younger voters.

I met Rappaport, who is 46, in early June in his firm's offices on Sand 
Hill Road, Silicon Valley's answer to Wall Street. As we talked in a plush 
conference room flanked by a sunlit terrace on one side and a pool table on 
the other, events in the world outside seemed to be tilting strongly in the 
Democrats' favor. Public support for President Bush's handling of the war 
in Iraq was dropping precipitously. The price of oil had shot up to $42 a 
barrel. Only hours earlier, voters in South Dakota sent a Democratic woman, 
Stephanie Herseth, to the U.S. House in a special election -- a race widely 
viewed as a potential harbinger for November.

But if all of this made John Kerry a good bet to become the next president, 
it did nothing, in Rappaport's view, to solve the Democrats' underlying 
problems. When I asked if he was skeptical about the direction of the 
party, he smiled, then said dryly, ''If you've been able to discern a 
direction on which to be skeptical or optimistic, then you're doing pretty 
well.''

"I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes 
me to tremble for the safety of my country.  As a result of the war, 
corporations have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places 
will follow, and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong 
its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth is 
aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed."
-Abraham Lincoln

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

  "I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of 
life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the 
beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club, 
party or other sound system that has ever achieved anything close to that..."
-Jeno, on the early days of Wicked and the Full Moon Raves

Subject: Re: [sfraves] SF Electronic Music Festival??

The SFEMF is much more of an academic computer-music festival, with strong
ties to the electronic-music program at Mills College.

I don't know all the artists in this year's lineup, but Ramon Sender is a
Bay Area legend as one of the founders of the SF Tape Music Center with
Morton Subotnick (computer music pioneer) and, I think, Pauline Oliveros,
back in the late 60s. Joan Jeanrenaud was cellist in the Kronos Quartet for
20 years. Ikue Mori was in the seminal no wave group DNA in the late 70s,
alongside Arto Lindsay, and went on to do extremely experimental drum
machine recordings on John Zorn's label. Wobbly is a local computer musician
who's released some really interesting things on Kid606's Tigerbeat6 label,
including one disc entirely made up of samples sourced from KMEL and other
commercial R&B stations. Basically, it's in the tradition of John Oswald's
Plunderphonics. And Keith Fullerton Whitman is best known as Hrvatski, and
he's recorded crazy breakcore mayhem for a number of labels, including (I
think) Planet Mu and Tigerbeat6.

For what it's worth, I don't recognize most of the DJs whose names I see on
the sfraves list. It's a big world out there and there are lots of distinct
electronic music scenes... including plenty that have little or no relation
to "raving," per se.

I used to live in Chicago, I wasn't a big partier at the time but you
can find a ton of stuff to do. Just go to Gramaphone Records and
you'll be set. Gramaphone Records was basically the store that
launched house during the days when Chicago created it. House used to
own Chicago, as in it was mainstream. It's still pretty strong there
although I get the impression that jungle is more of the thing. Also
look for Tim Xavier and DJ Rush, do a Google thing for their sites,
techno DJs based in Chicago I think. (I know Rush is, I think Xavier
as well.)

Seriously tho finding dance music in Chicago is about as difficult as
finding cowboy hats in Texas. Probability is on your side.

Giles/Soundwave


ps: go to Renalli's on Clark & Division for the double-decker pizza,
this is actually a pepperoni pizza which contains another pepperoni
pizza. seriously it is a pepperoni pizza which has another pepperoni
pizza listed as one of its ingredients. it is the world's only
recursive pizza. or, if you want the best pizza in Chicago, which in
other words means the best pizza on earth, and you don't mind visiting
a bad neighborhood, go to Medici's near the University of Chicago.
this pizza is so good that living your entire life without ever
tasting it is like living your entire life without ever having an
orgasm. and I don't mean an "oh I think I came" orgasm. I mean a
seeing purple spots and swearing in Latin orgasm. it's GOOD. seriously
I feel sorry for anyone who's never had real Chicago pizza. anyway
when I say "bad neighborhood" I don't mean you'll actually get shot at
or anything, but the pizza is so good that if you had to risk getting
shot at just to taste it, it would be worth it.

Hi there, all

   Cheers to that, Philip...there's more out there than can be
known...which is a good thing, I think.  Thank you for the
background on some of these artists.  Take care...

Subject: [sfraves] Saturday: The Softball game... then TELIC... mmhmm... yeah.. (Post 1)

So Saturday MONRING.. I went 2 school 4 tutoring.. I mean.. yeah Math sucks, but i am learing 2 appreciate it & (i seriously can't belive I"m sayin' this) having like some kinda mondo fun w/ it actually... Hello 2Day... 

So after tutoring.. I was originally suppose 2 like hook up w/ an Ooooooooold school friend from sooooooooo back in the day.. but there was hella miscommunication & I ended up goin' 2 the the "DJ ALL STARS & PROMOTERs" 2nd annual or something like that softball game... LoL.. it was fun.. Red team won & ironically, my hair it some kinda sunshine pomogranite, blonde, & deep grape plum purple colors.. but still all in all.. it was a fun time @ the baseball field hangin' out w/ Bros & Sistas I ain't seen in a looooooong time & esp gotta kick it w/ the bruised & happily injured Dragnfly lady.. LoL.. Love U Dina... send me some pixes of those injuries & that Dope side hottie profile pix =)

OK.. so yeah.. I was like kinda flutter 4 the 1st like 1/2 hour i was there 'cause I just got there FROM SCHOOL & well.. living the weekend raver gypsy (& usually broke) lifestyle i been havin' the past few years now ever since my car got stolen la la la never knowing where i'm gonna end la la... so after the game... Hello 2day.. I ended kickin it w/ LoL... these Mondo Super Duper Prideful Candy Kids & headed down 2 their headquarters in Freemont...

So back on BART I went w/ these playful creatures, made candy braclets 4 like a few hours although i only made 3, almost got my asskicked by some1 'cause I walked in2 the wrong apartment.... then went 2 TELIC... OK.. yeah

OK.. I'm gonna save a few things 4 Post 2 'cause I got some real big huge birds on my shoulders about TELIC that mondo fuckin' urked & I'll focus this post on the event itself... I mean... OK.. my choices 4 the night were either TELIC or this underground Jungle thingie that was goin' on in the City actually that was pretty close 2 my school,, but ya know.. I mean... as much as Frankie Bones comes out here.. I still like 2 pay him my respect 'cause he did spin @ the 1st Rave I went 2 la la la.. so yeah... & I do like his Techno sets esp more so since I been falling more in Love w/ it 4 the past 2 years.. hmmmm.. maybe a year longer...  So i was really ANXIOUS 2 hear a bangin' Techno set from him...

TELIC is a really nice venue... old school 'cause it's just 1 huge wherehouse room... but i dunno man.. i went through some shit b4 i went inside which put me in a totally fucked up mood & I dunno.. hearin' Foo foo trance 4 hella long & my mood mixing 2gether really made me feel like I was in Hell... Brandon (if you're reading this).. U remember that 1 party??? LoL.. yeah.. well... I felt like i was in hell wondering WTF i was doing there & I dunno... I was probably like that 4 like 2 hours...

Slowly the venue was hella packin' up & honestly, seein' Family, old friends, & makin' new friends (I made a new friend name Thumper lastnight.. LoL) & well.. alota touching things happened... 1 of my okd Homeboys Thanked me 4 like well.. a few yrs ago.. I helped him out when he was throeing up & sick after this 1 party & i helped him get home & he kept coming up 2 me lastnight & Thanking me...
I dunno... i started feelin' kinda plurie 'cause seein' people from like baaaaack in the day pop up... oh yeah.. another thing that made it bearable was spending 1/2 th3 night w/ Sean G & maki'n fun of people, the Horny Tards, The Meanie Tards, the ummm... well.. there were a few Groove the Movie moments (literally) that we experienced & talki'n 2 homeboy =) LoL  But honest 2 God man.. seein' every1 i saw lastnight really made me feel better & it was Awesome.. Thanks y'all!

OK.. Sets... ummmmm... well.. i wasn't really fond of AAAAAAAAAALL the Foo Foo Trance i heard lastnight & there was alota that from the DJs when 1st got there.. but ok.. Morgans set was pretty Dope.. I mean.. I guess he spun some playful stuff @ the begining, but then his Trance towards the 2nd part of his set on out was well.. there was alota old school stuff, the good stuff, I heard him spin if I'm right about that, & some Cyber Trancey tunes, & some preogreesive stuff....

Frankie Bones was really what I expected.. I mean.. I admit his set was really good, but not what i expected or wanted from him.. he kept it @ a totally well not mondo but kinda slwor BPM set. he started out HOuse, swtiched around alot w/ some Tech HOuse, Trance, some house... then he kept the 2nd part of his set w/ some hardcore strait up (4give me if I get this wrong,but I guess being totally influenced w/ Techno DJs here) Eastcoast Techno groove.. totally hard bass beat thumpin shit... it was Good 4 what it was, but i dunno... what I'm used 2 having my Techno w/ like more Percussion  emphasized songs... Frankie Bones spun alota Techno w/ whiney sounding melodies & I dunno.. it was slow... there's this 1 Frankie BOnes CD i got where he spins this bad ass Techno mix & I dunno... like i said, it was a Groovy set 4 what it was.. but it wasnt really in my boat lastnight or taste from what he spun... 

I feel kinda guilty 4 bein' let down by his set, but I also try 2 remind myself that when he spun @ the 1st Rave i ever went 2... he spun alot vocal booty house & Robin S opened 4 him.. i dunno.. la la la...  Also, I mean.. I Love My AndyW, Catharsis, ChrisJ, Raf1, Clarity, Forest Green, Kent, Jbot, even Shazbot Techno & it was I been totally living on 4 the past few years, so yeah... I guess I have a preferrence in term of Techno, but i know i know i know.. he coulda tore it up harder, but he made it soft 4 the candy kids... whatever.. lol

Todd Phrofet went on Next after him.. I actually Looved this set more better than the headliner.. LoL. I mean.. he started out some really hard bass heavy techno.. a few tracks with the whiney melodies like Frankie's, but he mixed in alooooota progreesive trance... really simialar 2 was Keitth Edwards does (wait... is that his name.. i 4got...ooops) & Mike Lui...  I did manage 2 dance

OK... now YUM... Madame Mercury really tore it up... i mean.. she tagged w/ sokme1.. i 4got who.. but fuck man.. i loved it... MM was all like New School breakbeats from the start, she got in some well.. there was this like ?epic? kinda sounding track.. LoL.. it was fun, & then this old skool brak beats track... I Loved it!!

I danced as much as could lastnight, but by MM set I was kinda man.... tired... LoL...

Some dude i 4got his name spun the closing set.. Trance again... it waxs fun.. but I was tired @ delirious by that point...

Yeah... LoL



Take Care,
Peace-> O§bY {8O)

Subject: [sfraves] TELIC.. Post #2- Am i wrong about this?

OK... so I usually have no problems w/ security ever since I became friends w/ like some of the bouncers @ 1015 back in the day & well.. ok yeah.. i'm the biggest pack rat in the world la la la...

But OK... I knew I was gonna have my problems w/ my back pack 'cause I went 2 SCHOOL in the morning & just had a back pack w/ me with all my school shit.. i knew before hand that i was gonna have some problems with my back pack & the party.. but yeah.. no biggie.. or so i thought... Hello 2Day

I got 2 TELIC...  OK.. Security basically RAPED me (in a matter of speaking).. not only did they do the full body search thingie.. but they checked everything everything everything...  the inside of my notebooks night have acid sheets in them... oh yeah.. my homeowrk might possibly ehatever the the fuck man...  my back pack was throughly ramsacked...my walkman sould contained pills side the motor..let's pull that apart... 

the security gaurd who searched my body actually cupped my balls through my pants & pressed hard if i moved... wouldn't that count as like sexual harassment or something???

My wallet chain(s) had 2 consficated & held 'til the end of the party.. understandable... but when U tell me that I have 2 put eveerything in my car & I tell U that I don't hagve a car... i (in a matter of speaking) took bart here from school & i don't have a car, sorry..  then I don't need a security gaurd fuckin' yelling @ me LITERALLY telling me I'm stupid then 4 having all my stuff w/ me & havin'g no place 2 put it & insulting me 4 being @ the party.. then what's up w/ that man???

In the morning when I left w/ Jaze, well wheni got my wallet chains back from security.. i got in2 a lil' arguement w/ the security lady & totally didn't mean 2.. she totally blew everything i was asking & sayin'g outta proportion....  she told me well.. yelled 2 me, "Wha the hell is your problem, we had 2 take your wallet chain to save your life & that's what our job is here to make this event safe for you" la la la she went on... OK.. yeah.. whatever...

But is her taking my wsallet chain saving the life of the kid who dropped 5 pills of E in a venue that has no air ventilation, over priced water, & the kid starts havin' seizures in the corner???  Their out there savcing lives when kids still find ways 2 get drugs in???  I mean.. seriously... how did she save my life & why should i be "Thankful" 4 the way secirty treated... yeah... their paid 2 B there 2 do their shit whatever.. Hello 2day... but fuck, c'mon now.. I was Verbally harrassed by security, possibey sexually harrassed (I'm still ike totally questioning that), & i dunno... is their job 2 do that harrassing on top of all the "security" shit they do??

I know this shit is 2 fold 'cause they know the have 2 know that the event that they do security 4 is illegal, but still man.. WTF... are they walkin' around the venue takin' care of etards makin' it safe 4 me???  Are they taking care of those potential situations that might fuck things up???  How exactly are they saving my life by doing all that shit 2 me.. I know it's not their job 2 care about my situation & how i got there & my school stuff.. whatever... but don't fuckin' make fuckin rude ass comments 2 me in line & not expect a comeback from me & fduckin' interupt my talkin' in repspone 2 your fuckin' comments... is that saving my life w/ your rude as fucki'n mouth???

I'm sorry, but I really had 2 bent this crap... this is what made my 1st TELIC event really sour man... I'm even questioning if i ever wanna go 2 another event there 'cause I don't need 2 b treated that way by security @ all... fuckin' bouncers everywhere else ain't got that kinda ghetto fuckin' style of treating the event guests...

But ami wrong 4 feeling the way I do about how i was treated?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] TELIC.. Post #2- Am i wrong about this?

Unfortunately I have to stand with Osby with this one.  I was also
practically raped by security minus the arguement.  Don't get me wrong, I
love the crew..but I have to agree that security was bent over shape with
themselves or something that night.

Is it illegal for security to search your pockets without your consent?  I
heard somewhere it was..but I am curious about this.  Either way, security
there did suck.. Osby I do feel for ya.. I relayed my disappointment with
security there with ya that night when I saw you.. Did anyone else who
attend the event the other night get raped & stripped search as well?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] HELP ME PLEASE

I used to live out there.  I'm going to be out there from the 5th to the
12th of this month, playing at a big old concert/ravearoo with Rabbit in the
Moon and a buncha other folk.  If you're out there during that window hit me
up.  If not I can still point you in the right direction and put you in
touch with some folk.  What kind of music you looking for?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] HELP ME PLEASE

The jungle scene out there is and has been very small and tight knit for
years now, espeically since the rave scene died.  House and progressive rule
the city based on what all my friends tell me, and it seems to ring true
every time I go back.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] TELIC.. Post #2- Am i wrong about this?

not sure if it was the same people doing security as before...but thats a
reason i don't want to go back to that venue.  The security just seem to
have sticks up their asses and treat people like shit (older mature
responsible people btw).  And correct me if i am wrong, its not even a
security company doing it....just some ravers.....or the most unprofessional
security ever?  at least it was when i was there.

NOOOOO!!!!!!

Shit I missed it again!! I wanted to go to the last one and I obviously 
missed this one!

ok so the BSP's on this paticular party needs to go out a bit earlier ;) I 
tried working my few connections in the rave circuit to find out when this 
next shindig was going down and no one knew.. There was not mention of it on 
the usual suspects websites either :(

Well hopefully I wont miss the next one.. Since I hear these are a series of 
parties?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] SF Electronic Music Festival??

LOL I have to say, I got a little confused about this last year.  I
actually go to Mills, where  a lot of the electronic music from the
70s and 80s was coming from (Maggi Payne and Fred Frith are teachers
there... if that rings a bell) anyway, I signed up for the electronic
music course thinking, alright, I'll finally learn to use cakewalk or
finalscratch.... HAHA nope not quite the same thing :)  We basically
ended up doing our entire class on the Moog.  Which is incredible ....
the only thing that sucked about it was that the oscillators were too
unstable to keep any sort of beat and so making techno like we love it
was pretty out of the question.  Cool stuff, though.  Definately be
worth checking out the festival

Heh, you'd be surprised at how much electronic music is built entirely
on the sounds of randomly detuned oscillators... :)

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: tonight, throwdown.com; tomorrow, Hugger-Mugger

I smoked a bit too much last week and totally missed my monday night gig
from the red room at In House... sorry if any of y'all tuned in hoping
to hear me and saw Neon Leon on the decks ;)

Anyway, this week I'm back at it. 6-8pm PST, live on the interweb.
Throwdown.com has redesigned their site with frames, so now it's
impossible to link directly to the stream... but go here:

<http://www.throwdown.com/throwdown/live/live.asp>

And click on the "LISTEN NOW" link on the left, under the red room logo.

And tomorrow night, I'll be making my first appearance at Hugger-Mugger,
on its first night as a new Tuesday weekly (that's right: no more third
Saturdays conflicting with undergrounds!). Juan Segovia and Li Sasaki
provide the residential beats.

Hugger-Mugger takes place from 9ish - 2am at Lit, on 6th at Mission in
San Francisco. Stop by and say hi, we don't bite.

Cornflakes,

yeah, there's actually a number of methods developed for emulating the
irregular auto-detuning of synths like that. but it's difficult to
imagine creating an entire track on just one machine, especially the
Moog.

I have mixed feelings about this. I think an overly academic focus is
kind of iffy, but on the other hand, holy shit, look at this:

MUS 252
Seminar in Electronic Music Performance ( 1 )
Real-time performance systems, concert audio, and interactive
electronics: sound diffusion, MIDI controllers, analog-to-digital
interfaces, electronic instrument building, interactive sound
installations, composition languages, and computer music networks.
Presentation and discussion of student works of electronic music;
development of experimental compositional strategies made possible by
electronic technology. Spring

Instructor(s): Chris Brown
Limit 15 students.
Open to graduate students only.


from the Mills course catalog. that's awesome! I want to go to Mills now.

actually, here's the awesome thing... it's the undergrad that's female
only, the grad school is co-ed.
This could, however,  potentially be detrimental to the overly
academic focus... 8P

Oh that's cool.. My ex-girlfriend went to Mills.. a literature major.  They 
turn out pretty critical thinkers there.. do you think the more critical 
will be the men or the women.. I am curious if women in general approach 
music with a higher math focus, or artistic sense. It is a loaded question.. 
but I am unfamilliar with the current views on genetic predisposition toward 
learning between the sexes with respect to music (leveraging both math and 
creative expression).

actually, here's the awesome thing... it's the undergrad that's female
only, the grad school is co-ed.
This could, however,  potentially be detrimental to the overly
academic focus... 8P

Well, music inherently requires a blend of art and math, and i think
whichever way you tend to think (whether you consider yourself more
art person than math person) will naturally lead you to focus on a
related area.  But you are constantly using them both with music...
it's kinda like wondering which foot is leading the other, or whether
this is a question of genetics or exposure, they both influence each
other, and it's kindan impossible to seperate.  However, I will say
that in my class, about a third of the women seemed to be 'math
people' , that is their compositions were very orderly and patterned,
and a third were very loose, more 'artistic'  ... but a lot of them
were in the middle.  There was only one guy in the class and his stuff
was just wierd.  Cool, but friggin strange.

Subject: [sfraves] re: Telic

Telic. Telic telic telic.

I was kickin it at my girl's work last week and this azn kid I recognized
from some function or another strolled in. Began chattering -- animated,
to say the least -- about raves. I was talking shit about something, being
a negative little fuck, and he started talking about the dungeon. "It the
best because it never get busted!"

What's the exchange rate on freedom, anyway?

I think everyone had the same experience with security that night. And
it's funny, because... what exactly is the fucking point, aside from
making us feel violated? Maybe pretending to placate the cops, so paranoid
promoters feel safe about their profits in the face of equipment seizure
and the rave act? My first comment to the girl on door, upon getting
through the thigh-pawing gauntlet (I have new, strange stirrings in my
loins whenever I see a brinks truck now):

"Crazy security. I feel like I'm going into jail."
"You want to be safe, don't you?"
"I guess..."

I think the fault lies within the nuskool kids' desire to just have a safe
place to roll, get their massage on, and bounce around for a few hours.
They are the majority, and they are totally willing (being used to it) to
be treated this way. The entire ethos surrounding raves -- the allure of,
you know, being up past your bedtime and breakin da law seems to be gone.
Might as well start holding 'electronic music dance events' at the
Fillmore.

I dunno. Security didn't seem to do much. I felt like if I yawned for too
long, a passerby might hurl a handful of pills down my throat -- not that
those little buggers need any help getting down there. Security didn't
stop the dozen or so E dealers, did they? What exactly were they trying to
protect us from? Bioweapon attacks against frankie bones? Clockwork orange
rejects with straightrazors concealed in the soles of their shoes?

Where the fuck is the next big thing, already? Where are the kids pushing
the envelope and innovating? Where's the next crazy eye-opening drug? Why
aren't the latest wave of potential brilliant youngins out till 7am
thrashing to terrible, hypnotic beats that totally blow your mind? These
ain't ravers. They're just consumers.

For christ sakes. If raves (as people keep telling me) are dead... where
the fuck is the new wave? It seems my options when I go out are:

 - Candy party. Annoying e-tards. Bad environment to do anything but eat
lots of drugs, and not the best conditions to do drugs in anyway, given
the atmosphere's penchant for vicious fixer/leg-breaker security guards
and random thugz.

 - Old-skool 'rave' that I have to network for 3 days to find out about,
only to get there and find everyone sittin around talking shit and
drama-whoring. Get ugly looks if I happen to have a couple plastic beads
on my wrist. Smoke a blunt and pass out.

 - Trendy breaks/deep house 'underground' (ie club kids in a warehouse)
where I feel like I'm on the set of Party Monster II. Lots of people in
hideous post-punkrock attire trying to convince themselves how hip they
are. Swingers on eezy and people chasing the dragon in the corner. Good
place to pick up syphilis.

 - Go to a club. Get depressed over the meat market. Begin drinking. Blow
80 dollars on watered down drinks. Go outside, scrounge for empty 40s,
hurl them at cop cars. Flee through the mission. (Hey, clubs are pretty
fun)

You guys see what I mean? Where the fuck is the action?

Report your neighbors,

Sean

Get out of town, go outdoors... the best dance parties are outdoors, IMO.

I think you should feel violated, Osby.  I've seen ads for the Telic 
parties.  The impression they give is that:  "...we are bring back that old 
love and vibe from back in the early days of raves."

For those who did not experience the anarchic, free-spirited days of raving 
this may work.  But in reality, there was no "security" at these 
events;  no pat down;  no confiscation of personal property.  These actions 
would be antithetical to the whole concept of a "temporary autonomous 
zone."  Now we have parties where one is required to surrender personal 
freedoms for safety.  Kinda like a microcosm of the whole of society these 
days, eh?

Intrusive security has nothing to do with "raving."  When promoters throw 
parties like these where you are required to endure personal humiliation to 
enter they should at least disclose this after the "love and vibe" headers 
in their advertising.

Love,

Apollo

"I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes 
me to tremble for the safety of my country.  As a result of the war, 
corporations have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places 
will follow, and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong 
its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth is 
aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed."
-Abraham Lincoln

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

  "I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of 
life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the 
beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club, 
party or other sound system that has ever achieved anything close to that..."
-Jeno, on the early days of Wicked and the Full Moon Raves

Subject: Re: [sfraves] SF Electronic Music Festival??

the ones who stood out to me were the ones who could use both... the
ones who had incredible artistic vision but also were anal retentive
enough to record the track 8 times until they had it just right.  :) 
for me that was always the problem... i'm plenty creative but not too
patient.   So my stuff was always kind of messy.  But then there was
this girl, a math major, and she would make these intricate, rythmic
pieces that just.,... lacked soul or something... even though she'd
been in the studio for hours.  So, yeah, it can be kind of a toss-up,
and you'd find great pieces all over the place from one week to the
next.

i think it would be interesting to do a study on this...  you could
see which musical tones and patterns emerged in each group, see if
they  have any association at all...
sorry,.... you asked the wrong  (or the right?) question to a psych

Ask those around you, Sean.  Seems people are willing to give away freedom 
for practically nothing these days.

Those who trade safety for security end up with neither.

It was exactly this level of dissatisfaction that led to raves in the first 
place.  You are not alone.  I go to very few parties these days, and I have 
to have much assurance that I will be treated with respect and love at any 
event I do attend.

Increasing numbers of dancers will become bored with the current offerings 
(I see this happening) and more folks will go back to the DIY ethic.  I 
truly wish that Moksha could do more parties;  we've been on the "safe and 
happy" venue search lately.  But many many more of us, I think, need to be 
more involved in the art of party giving.

Pain and unhappiness fuels change.  Dancers get pissed off enough things 
will move in a better direction.

Love,

Apollo

that would be a pretty big change...but I might be able to convince
them to let me into the grad school. I don't actually have a degree,
but I probably have a degree's worth of academic credits from various
places. (and if I don't now, I should by next year...)

hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.

not making the lifestyle change, tho, that's a lot of effort just to
get into college!

Subject: [sfraves] miss kittin...

Miss Kittin rocked!  that was absolutely the best set
i've heard all year, and i'm including everything i
heard at sonar and movement (detroit) in the running. 
damn!  she mixed styles brilliantly, flawlessly. 
mills, hawtin, pump up the jam, green velvet, dj rush,
hip hop, her own stuff - live, madonna, work it
motherfucker, new order... plus lots more i can't
remember off the top of my head or couldn't trainspot
because i was too tranced out dancing.  the crowd was
pretty good, too - actually a mix of queer and
straight, too.  and once the drinkers left after 2, it
was even better.  it was amazing.  

matthew dear was, uh, kind of pretentious and boring,
imho.  he did a set of playing live and singing w/
another performer, and while some of his beats were
good, i just couldn't get into it.  wasn't terribly
into the earlier performers, either.  but that's ok,
cuz i needed all my energy to dance to miss kittin!  
fuck yeah! i haven't had a club night like that in SF
since hawtin last year.  i hope there's more to come.

Subject: [sfraves] Review of Astral Projection  (7/31 at 550)

Greetings

I am wondering if anyone has any thoughts on the Astral Projection show at
550 this past Saturday night. I stopped going to 550 a long time ago as the
crowd got very nasty and then Thump moved on to the DNA Lounge. I dearly
miss the great crowd at the old Thump shows when they were at 550. Any info
or opinions?

Peace

RL

Subject: RE: [sfraves] [NRR] How Long Does Magic Mushrooms Stye In Your System For???

Actually, I used to work for a medical lab and we did do urine tests for
shrooms.  When I started at the lab in 97 they were unable to test, but
about 6 months in for some unknown reason one of the older lab techs
came and told my friend and I that they just started testing for
shrooms.  It felt kinda weird with him singling us out because he knew
we went to raves but at that time of my life I was sober due to random
drug tests.  Although I was a little ticked to find out that I could've
gotten away with it.  They're not tested in a normal screen unless they
have reason to test for it specifically.

>From Erowid:
Tested for in Standard Drug Tests? 	NO
Tested for in Extended Drug Tests? 	Sometimes
Possible to test for? 	YES
Detection Period in Urine 	1-3 days

Really? WACKY! When I talked to the Police back in VA (which is a VERY
strict area as far as drug usage), they had no idea how to test for shrooms.
They said hallucinogens in general are much harder to test for period.

But, the cops are not exactly known for being honest, lol.

Notthat I ever have to worry meself, shrooms are no longer on the menu for
moi.

Bad trips = the suck.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] SF Electronic Music Festival??

but how would you control for socializing factors?

the intersection of music and the mind is potentially very
interesting. for literally years I wanted to do a hypnosis CD called
"how to dream techno." it would put the user in a trance and have them
hallucinate the greatest music they ever heard. in theory it should be
easy to do but in practice I never got around to it. I even got a
bunch of training in hypnosis but to do something like that you really
need to have a lot of practical real-world experience. I finally told
a hypnotist about it, literally last night, and she got back to me
today and told me she would start working on it before September. I
was like woot! anyway...I think it'd be really interesting if somebody
could find out how much of the emotional and physical power of music
is culturally conditioned and how much of it built-in. as in, is there
some kind of musical equivalent to Chomsky's linguistic structures?

shrooms. It felt kinda weird with him singling us out because he knew
we went to raves but at that time of my life I was sober due to random
drug tests. Although I was a little ticked to find out that I could've
gotten away with it. They're not tested in a normal screen unless they
have reason to test for it specifically.

Subject: [sfraves] re: Telic

Man thats some funny ass shit!

Was security over board... well that was the hardest i have been searched 
ever!  i congratulated the security guard for being the first person ever to 
open my back left butt pocket, since in the 4 years i have had these shorts 
i don't believe i have ever used it (not very convinient of a pocket really) 
i wasn't joking and he didn't find it very funny.  It seemed like they 
weren't looking for weapons but more for drugs. i mean come on now, a simple 
pat over my butt pocket would suffice but actually undoing the velcro and 
pulling the pocket out might have been a little too far.

but did it affect my time.  mmm... no.  why hold onto things like that. i 
understand what your saying apollo, but if thats the way the run their venue 
thats the way the do it.  but other then that I had a blast!  took me 5 
years back at least.  but then again i missed all the NRG stuff, so it was 
Techno, progressive trance  and then breaks for me.  so i really enjoyed it. 
  it was great to hear Techno really loud in a wherehouse and the bpm was 
just right for me.  had to be about 138 or so.  but it was intense and 
driving. yummy!  i had a blast. it was great to be dancing to some good 
tunes in a large wherehouse, seemed proper to me.  but i got there late. 
Frankie was awesome.  nice to hear Todd Prophet playin as well. Haven't seen 
him in a couple of years.  good stuff!

Venue: Thumbs Up
Security: Thumbs Down
Party: Thumbs Up
Music: Thumbs Up
Overall Experience: Thumbs Up

It was really nice to be partying in a large wherehouse with some Techno. 
For a moment i thought it was 97 again.





RE:

For christ sakes. If raves (as people keep telling me) are dead... where
the fuck is the new wave? It seems my options when I go out are:

- Candy party. Annoying e-tards. Bad environment to do anything but eat
lots of drugs, and not the best conditions to do drugs in anyway, given
the atmosphere's penchant for vicious fixer/leg-breaker security guards
and random thugz.

- Old-skool 'rave' that I have to network for 3 days to find out about,
only to get there and find everyone sittin around talking shit and
drama-whoring. Get ugly looks if I happen to have a couple plastic beads
on my wrist. Smoke a blunt and pass out.

- Trendy breaks/deep house 'underground' (ie club kids in a warehouse)
where I feel like I'm on the set of Party Monster II. Lots of people in
hideous post-punkrock attire trying to convince themselves how hip they
are. Swingers on eezy and people chasing the dragon in the corner. Good
place to pick up syphilis.

- Go to a club. Get depressed over the meat market. Begin drinking. Blow
80 dollars on watered down drinks. Go outside, scrounge for empty 40s,
hurl them at cop cars. Flee through the mission. (Hey, clubs are pretty
fun)

You guys see what I mean? Where the fuck is the action?

Report your neighbors,

Sean

Subject: Re: [sfraves] SF Electronic Music Festival??

yeah for sure... I still think that a lot of the reason we love techno
is because our ancestors have been using ritualistic drumming and
psychedellics to attain other levels of consciousness for so many
years that, by now,  it touches something primal in us... but i can
never be sure that we didn't just learn it from our parents (in one
form or another).  But that's always the problem... how to control fpr
social factors?  You can't really get twins separated at birth, and
look at their differences and similarities, because music is so widely
listened to, one would have to grow up in a vacuum to escape it's
influence, and then they'd be all fucked up anyway so you'd have to
throw out the data :)
On a random note, another interesting aspect to study would be how
someone's self perception correllates with the music they like, say,
'I see myself as a math person, and I like trance', versus
correllating their actual thinking methods (this can differ...i guess
they have some tests that can objectively tell you which side of the
brain you're using or whatever, versus how you percieve yourself)
because i bet that when you're actively thinking "I'm a such'and
such', your answer will be different.  You know, like when your
grandma asks you what I'm listening to lately, the brazilian singer
comes to mind first, whereas if one of my peeps asks me, I'll think of
the dj shadow album i just ripped.  I think a test like that is one
way to help figure out the cultural bias...

Subject: Re: [sfraves] SF Electronic Music Festival??

Actually there are many many books written about the
social and psychological impacts of music.  An
aquaintance of mine William Benzon wrote one recently
called Beethoven's Anvil in which he conjectures that
music creates a shared brain state among a group of
people.  FWIW I talked to him a bit about raves and
electronic music while he was finishing it.  See
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0465015441/qid=1091515636/sr=8-2/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i2_xgl14/104-3669827-5895930?v=glance&s=books&n=507846
 

FWIW William is a jazz musician so he's coming from
that perspective.

You might also want to check out Jardain's book
*Music, The Brain, And Ecstasy : How Music Captures
Our Imagination* but be forewarned its mostly about
the brain and is focused on classical music.   

And then there's this recent conference:
http://www.wesleyan.edu/music/sacredspace/about.html

FWIW there are lots of books out there about the
cultural impacts and importance of electronic dance
music too.  While there are several worth reading, I
haven't been hugely impressed with any of them
frankly.

Its been interesting to watch rave culture evolve over
the past 10 years (I went to my first in late 1993 or
early 1994 gasp!) but its a shame that some of this
sort of knowledge seems to have left the scene.  Its
more about getting laid than getting wisdom today.  I
know there are still a few promoters (some of whom are
on this list) that understand these ideas and are
trying to put them to use so please turn the
flamethrowers OFF.

Best,

Peter

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Review of Astral Projection  (7/31 at 550)

I think a ton of folk on this list were at the FnF campout so I'll share my
thoughts but I'm not too good at the party reviews.  Plus I played upstairs
that night and I'm a Thump boy so my views are kinda biased.  :)  I'm a much
bigger fan of Thump at 550 than at DNA in general, I think it fits their
vibe and variety of music they're into.

The crowd Saturday was a mix of regulars and random folk, but I generally
got really good vibes from everyone, seemed to be a happy atmosphere.  The
party didn't really fill in until 1, but the main room stayed packed until I
left at 5, and Astral Projection definitely rocked it, people were letting
go and gettin down.

The breaks room cleared out kinda early but the house room kept good energy
for most of the night (that's where I spent most of my time).  Only heard
the Ambient Mafia outside right towards the end, but when I walked out they
were jamming Brass Monkey and singing along so I think they had fun.

On the whole I had a much better time than the last few times I went to the
DNA for their parties there, everyone was smiles and no attitude.  I believe
their 5 year is coming up soon, should be off the hook!

The security sounds like a chip off the Bush Administration. Trying to make
the world safer by pissing more people off and encroaching on your freedom.
Next time just ask who the security company is, or find out by other means.
Perhaps a nice little article in the local papers on *security* (what a
joke) might shake things up a bit more. Personally I just find it sad that
certain crews out there attract shitty little kids that cause problems and
thus require dickhead quasi-security. I've said it in the past and I'll say
it again now - I think certain elements of the rave scene SHOULD die off.
Kill it off for a few years, bring it back quietly and don't let the shitty
kids find out. Then the security need can be eliminated.

SATURDAY, Aug 7th

Club 6 presents:

LEGENDS OF HOUSE 13.0: FARLEY JACKMASTER FUNK

When a new style of music first cracks the pop charts, the hit is usually a 
deliberate crossover by an artist having little to do with the music's 
original pioneers. The first house single to reach the charts, however, was 
recorded by seminal Chicago DJ and producer, Farley Jackmaster Funk. His 
cover of Isaac Hayes' "Love Can't Turn Around" made the Top Ten in mid-1986 
? ironically, not in his home country but in the U.K. ? at the same time 
that he was one of the biggest names in Chicago house. Born in 1962, Farley 
began DJing while still a teenager.

He first made his name in 1981, broadcasting on Chicago's WBMX-FM with 
Ralphi "The Razz" Rosario, Kenny "Jammin" Jason, Mickey "Mixin" Oliver and 
Scott "Smokin" Seals as the Hot Mix 5 ? the legendary DJ team which broke 
house music for a wider Chicago audience. Farley also appeared at the 
legendary Warehouse club (mixing alongside Frankie Knuckles ) and then 
began a residency at the Playground (later the Candy Store) which set in 
stone his reputation as one of the city's top DJs.

Downstairs:
Jesse Saunders (the orginator of house, justsayagency)

Upstairs:
Dusty Crates (electric soul)

PRICE: $10 b4 11pm,

"I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes 
me to tremble for the safety of my country.  As a result of the war, 
corporations have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places 
will follow, and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong 
its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth is 
aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed."
-Abraham Lincoln

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

  "I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of 
life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the 
beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club, 
party or other sound system that has ever achieved anything close to that..."
-Jeno, on the early days of Wicked and the Full Moon Raves

Have you guys noticed that all the spammers these days with messed up 
content are coming from AOL?  I have someone masquarading my account 
spreading netski, then there is endless porn, and now this freak!!

AOL is getting loose.. or perhaps it is the GMan that has been able to 
secure accounts with AOL infrastructure to use in rooting out the evil in 
humanity.. starting with Vicodin dealers.. like the real problem in america 
isn't alcohol and meth in that order.

I think I am just going to block all AOL accounts.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] SF Electronic Music Festival??

Yea - on the muinimal techno tip, I saw Jeff Mills @ Twilo a number of years
back (4 or 5?), and man...what a set. Most of what I have ever heard from
him as far as live sets never impressed me, and to be quite honest, for the
1st hour of his set at Twilo, I wanted to kill him. A bass kick ALONE for
like 20 minutes is NOT cool. However - after he started building it, geezus
christ - it sucked you in and just tweeked yer melon like nothing else.

Too bad most techno DJ's can't do anything remotely close to that. I know
I'll get the massive flaming for this - but I seriously think most techno
DJ's I have ever heard couldn't understand the concept of beatmatching,
phrasing, or emotion through music to save their lives. If it's gonna
pound - give it flavor, if it's gonna throb, give it feeling. Make it
fucking GO SOMEWHERE....

I did actually read some of these books a little but they were kind of
over my head. I don't recall the titles but it's his signature
achievement. He found that there's a sort of built-in structure of
language in the human brain or genetics or something. anyway, he's
more famous for his political whatnot but this was actually like a
field-altering revolutionary towering intellectual achievement type
thing...check amazon or something, I'm not sure...

dood there are a buh-zillion online doctors and pharmacies??? (canadian)
the fact that you are asking us means you haven't even searched google.

if your looking for a local "dr. feelgood" then that's totally
inappropriate and if you've been in the scene for so long, you should know
that.

i hope you find what your looking for.

respectfully,
Jonas

Subject: RE: [sfraves] really wierd question

Why would you need to illegally get vicoden when you can *legally* get a
script and pills on-line? Rush must be pretty stupid to have to get
busted for getting it illegally when he could have just gone out and
bought it at one of the many on-line pharms.

Anyone here ever try California poppy tea? I've heard it's a real smooth
drink.

On that note, no, I do not have sources for you, so don't ask me.

Rave related content:

Anyone else hear that Solid grooves might be closing?

I'm not gonna flame you, but I don't see why you stop there -- MOST DJS
don't understand the concept of beatmatching, phrasing, selection, emotion,
flow, etc. By no means is the problem endemic to techno, minimal or
otherwise.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] SF Electronic Music Festival??

???

first of all are you saying Plastikman "Sheet One" is a hypnosis CD
designed to put the user in a trance and hallucinate the greatest
music they've ever heard? cause I'm not sure I understand. there's
definitely an element of nostalgic joy in outraging you but I'm
baffled.

second I can't smoke any number of bong rips right now, partly because
the Seuss-like glassware giant that used to have its own room is sadly
no longer with us -- (my brother broke it, RIP) -- but mostly because
I'm at work.

Detroit techno is the pinnacle of soul.

And most of the bay area techno DJs are some of the most talented and
aurally gifted people in our respective scene.

Are you 100% sure you know what you're talking about?  (to the person PS is

Subject: Re: [sfraves] techno DJs

Well - let's put it this way, since a lot of techno is so minimal in
samples/synths, etc., it's a LOT more noticeable. For instance, I can't tell
you how many times i have heard a techno DJ rockin' it out, and maybe it's
just that they have REALLY shitty track selection, but it sounds like a
non-stop trainwreck. With genres like house, as long as you stay away from
vocals, you can fudge your way through a lot better, and unless you really
ARE trainwrecking, it's not so bad. But when all you have to hear are beats,
man there better be some fucking coherency to it....

the problem is not with the question, its with where you asked the question. People already think people who enjoy electronic music events are trouble because of the bad history that the scene has had with drugs and what not, and when people openly ask about these things.... and didnt rush get caught with the oxy? not vicodin.... oxycontin is getting much harder to get a script for..

knows what they are doing at ALL, as opposed to a person who thinks that the
awful racket they are making on the decks is worthwhile "music".

You can think you're the coolest techno DJ on the block, but if you can't
put the bleeps and clicks together in any remotely listenable way, then
you're just making noise.

I am more specifically targeting "minimal" techno, or some of the glitchier
hard/german style techno when I say this (of course, I am not very versed as
far as subgenres of techno, so I am being very general here). The "housier
stuff" seems to not suck as bad. Or rather, the DJ's that spin it seem to
work it better.

I could say the same about the glitchier side of breaks, which is my
personal favorite genre. It seems the more experimental the sound (for lack
of a better term), the worse the DJ. They think they are being artsy and
creative, but really, it just sounds like ass.

Now this is *not* a constant. I have heard some folks rock the holy hell out
of the minimal, glitchy or experimental styles of EDM - but it's MUCH fewer
and farther between.

Just an observation. I am always open to be proven wrong in my opinions!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] techno DJs

I'm referring to the overall. I knowa few excellent techno DJ's back in DC
too - but they are MUCh fewer and farther between when compared to the whole
pool.

Maybe it's because it's not a genre you can fudge your way though as easily
as others - which is why I truly appreciate a good techno DJ, and why I
think shitty ones suck that much more.

*shrug*

Once again - if people want to show me what great techno sounds like - I
LOVE to listen to online sets - POST THE LINKS!!!

Subject: [sfraves] Techno party you say?????

OK all this talk about Techno!!

So someone do a techno party then!! I would like to see a good ol techno 
bang em up in a gritty dirty lil warehouse that would be nice.. I wouldn't 
mind even playing some old techno tracks that I have locked away in my 
crates I think that would be fun. Hell I got 10 Grand right now if someone 
can come up with a good space and concept for a  "Hardcore Underground 
techno Rave"

With conditions! Usual suspects mixed in with some new cats.. Im sure there 
has to be some new jocks coming up through the ranks that play tec-no, 
besides Andy,Chris,Nico etc...


Just my 10 thousand dollar/cents worth!

Macadio

Sounds like a good idea to me.

What concept do you need for undergorund techno other than "big warehouse,
low lighting, pulsing and pounding beats" ? If you're gonna do it, do it
Detroit sylee. lol

Hydrocodone is the main active ingredient in Vicodin. It also contains
acetaminophen, aka Tylenol. Acetaminophen happens to be pretty toxic for
your liver in high doses. So people who abuse Vicodin are harming
themselves in more than one way.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] we were both right, Re: [sfraves] really wierd question

Again talk to my ex.  She's currently taking vicodin,
soma, and fiorecet on top of the 4 or 5 psychiatric
medications she's required to take all prescribed by
supposedly legitimate doctors.  She says she no longer
"abuses" alcohol but that doesn't mean she's not
drinking at least as I interpret it. 

This is the thing about drugs people.  Some people can
handle them and some just can't.  The problem is that
you don't know which group you fall into until its too
late to stop.  In the case of my ex a family history
of alcohol abuse should have tipped us off to the
trouble ahead for her, but growing up in the seventies
in Berkeley nobody thought about the risks of doing
this sort of stuff.

Sounds like a good idea to me.

What concept do you need for undergorund techno other than "big warehouse,

They sell 10/325's. So you can do 4 of them and not take that much more
APAP (acetaminophen) then 2 extra strength Tylenols while getting an
extreme dose of hydrocodone.

Overdose of APAP =3D painfull liver bleeding and death.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] we were both right, Re: [sfraves] really wierd question

Yup.  She's become quite frightening actually.  Last
time I saw her she couldn't remember what year we got
married or when she graduated from college.  Its a
very very sad situation especially as we have two
children.

I'm not a prude about this stuff, again growing up in
Berkeley and all, but my experience with her problems
has made me question a lot of things that I thought
about these sorts of substances.  I'm not talking
about social drinking or smoking here, or probably
even certain ritual uses of psychedelic substances,
although those things clearly have consequences also.

Think before you put a chemical into your body.  Will
you be a better person afterwards or are you simply
covering up problems you don't want to face?  Try
meditation and dancing without chemicals and you might
find that its OK actually.  Again not to preach to
anyone or be a prude about it.  

Its just something worth thinking about...

peace,

peter

Subject: Re: [sfraves] we were both right, Re: [sfraves] really wierd question

Too many people just don't understand the concept of moderation, and they
often times find themselves in the middle of a nasty habit which either they
CAN'T break (due to lack of willpower), or they are in too much denial to
even notice it.

I am all for having a fun time, but keep it occasional, and special - not as
kith and kin to whatever you do.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Techno party you say?????

I am playing w/ DJ Bone on the 28th of August in Virginia!!! I am
SOOOOOOOOOOOOO excited about that! My boy Sinestro (from DC) is a huge fan
of Bone, and weas the one to book him for this party (and is also a crackin'
techno DJ while we're bullshittin'). Perhaps if someone really wanted him I
could get something arranged? I know if someone was to bring out Sinestro,
he'd find a way to get a deal on Bone for ya....he's cool like dat.

w00t!

Wow.... this is where *I* feel like an incredible doofus.

All this time, since high school, I've always assumed that Soma was 
just something that Aldous Huxley made up for "Brave New World".  Now, 
I find out from you (And confirmed on google... I'm NOT trying to be a 
wise-ass here, though I suspect that's the way this would otherwise 
read.), that it really is an actual, existing, drug.

Well, there's a tick mark to put in the "learn something new every day" 
box.  Thanks.


cya,
john

Go to Mexico and watch as white coats from pharmacies bug you to buy the
shit. I felt like I was at a massive where everyone was a dealer. Fuckers
didn't have medicine for my sick cat. Losers. Scary that soma does exist
huh? =)

Actually, it's slightly offensive that Soma got used by a pharmaceutical 
company for a product - Soma is "the" name for the drug combo/plant/?
used, as mentioned in the Rig Vedas et al, for invoking/communicating with 
the gods - no one is quite sure what it is/was, but Amanita Muscaria
is the leading candidate.  but pharm companies are bastards, by and large....

so Aldous didn't make it up, but he knew what he was referencing

Its a prescription drug, a muscle relaxant, and highly
addictive.  Its often prescribed in conjunction with
vicodin for back injuries which is how my ex started
getting it.  

Yes its also mentioned by Huxley in a Brave New World
as you, and yes it is also the name of a beverage
consumed in an ecstatic ritual described in the vedas.
 I have a recent article somewhere that says the soma
described in the vedas is not mushrooms however but a
brewed herb extract.  

The article describes the modern soma ritual, which
apparently is ongoing in India to this day, in very
great detail including the collection of the plants,
brewing of the drink, ritual serving and drinking
vessels, altar placements, and so forth.  I'm moving
so I don't know where that book is exactly but I'll
see if I can find it and post something if people are
interested.

I've been disapointed at a couple of DEFSF parties.  The impression I've
gotten from looking at how you manage your timeslots is you're scenesters
who don't really *get* it.

I mean that in the most constructive way possible.  Honestly.

the definition apparently has morphed over time - the most
logical explanation is that "soma" has been used as the label
for many different things (as society, the rituals, etc changed)
sort of like "Ecstasy == MDMA" (which is hardly the case)

so nowadays it may be a brewed herb extract (one theory
had Ephedra as the plant... yeah, right....) but back in the day,
it could have been mushrooms, or bhang, or opium, or ....
Lots and lots or scholarly... arguments.... over it

I heard the modern day stuff is not psychoactive... so why do
they bother?  Because religion sucks

I would certainly be interested in the book/article.  thanks

Plate O' Shrimp

As it turns out it was on top of an open box.  The
book is actually a quarterly journal, *Social
Research*, and its the Fall 2001 issue devoted to
Altered States of Consciousness.  Volume 68, No. 3 if
anyone wants to find it.  The article is called "How a
Psychactive Substance Becomes a Ritual" and the author
is Frits Staal.  A quick perusal (and this article
isn't written for that mind you) and I think I was
wrong about his conclusions.  He discounts the ephedra
claim, reviews a few possible herbs (mountian rue),
and concludes it might have been mushrooms but not
fresh ones or perhaps more likely an unknown mountain
plant.  he reaches this conculsion because the vedas
describe soma coming only from specific places (i.e
high mountains) and the mushrooms grow in many other
locations.

Apparently the vedas and the soma ritual include
descriptions of soaking the soma stalks in water under
which condition they swell.  So if someone wants go
trekking around the moutnains of Iran (where the
origianl vedic peopel and soma came from) you might
after extensive collection and research find such a
plant.  

As you point out, and this article goes into detail
about it, the modern event is a religious ritual and
may not include consuming any psychoactive substance
whatsoever.  Staal's point is in fact to try
understand the underlying social process by which this
conversion from ritual use of a drug to simply a
religious ritual occurred.

With all of that said, as a practicing Buddhist, I
can't agree that religion "sucks" though YMMV ;)

best,

peter

well, there's religion, Religion, and spirituality.
As a Gnostic (what, I'm not quite sure), I have little
patience for the stereotypical Religion (more properly viewed as
a vehicle for social control etc) which adheres to the tenets of
religion and claims to be spiritual...   It's the "dumbing down"
that I was referring to - if the Eucharist was actually psychoactive,
all those fundy "Christians" out there might actually turn into ones.

the Catholic Church is worried about all the New Age stuff (mostly
nonsense, but some useful stuff) precisely because it's, at the heart,
the resurgence of Gnosticism

and Buddhism is more a philosophy, is it not?  but over the years,
it has become more of a religion

These are in reverse chronological order, so start at the bottom for
more recent stuff. "The Control Structure" is probably the most relevant
to this discussion.

And if you like that, come see (and hear) me at Hugger-Mugger tonight. I
just picked up some old Profan records that I'm very much looking

I say up with spirituality, down with "organized" religion. Well, at least
the fundamental sects - whom I see as a bunch of God Thugs.

"I believe in loving thy neighbor, and turning the other cheek - but MY
religion is the BEST religion, and anyone who thinks otherwise is WRONG and
ought to DIE!"

It's about as silly as the Police's credo being "To Serve and Protect". More
like "To Harass and Annoy".

Ugh - anyway, I should shut up - I was raised Catholic so I've still got
some pent up irritation to deal with, lol.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Techno party you say?????

Ahh, you are still upset that we put Chris Jackson on from 4-6 at Paradigm
Shift.  We were hoping that putting him on last, plus serving breakfast at
4:30, would keep people at the party all night.  It didn't really work out
that way.  Few people seem willing to stay out past 3 these days. <sigh>
We were really grateful that Chris was willing to be a good sport and play
last, although I don't think we would do that again.  We are still a young
crew, and every party is a learning experience.

Plus, it's really hard to find DJs to play the dreaded first and last
slots. All the DJs that play at our parties are really talented and
experienced, and generally expect headlining slots.  It's really hard for
us to figure out who will play the unwanted slots. I don't think this
means we should find mediocre DJs to put on first and last.  Why not have
great techno DJs all night?

Perhaps I am wrong, perhaps I just don't get it.  (I'm trying to get it
though!)

Love Chelsea

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Techno party you say?????

I always wanted to have the lineup start at 11pm since no one shows up until
11/11:30pm anyway. But... Advertise the party as starting at 10pm and have
the first hour be open decks. That way someone that *wants* to spin early
gets to and the rest of the lineup that *you* want to spin gets to when
there is a good sized crowd around. As for closing time slots you're right
that people all seem to bail at 3am. My guess? A lot of us are drinkers now
since the majority of those attending parties are 21+ these days. Kids grew
up and are hitting the bottle rather than taking a hit. Toss in a bit of
complacency and stagnation and I think you have your answer.

Subject: [sfraves] [BSP] October 10th Looking for bookings

I will be in the bay area for the weekend of October 8th through the 13th. I 
am looking for a possible booking on Sunday the 10th while I am out there. I 
am a dj of nine years with plenty of experience to hold my own. I am based 
out of Portland OR for those that do not know. I am mostly looking for 
drinks and a place to pass out some CD's. I spin house mostly glitchy and 
minimal. I also love garage(Not 2-Step, Not speed garage but Tony Humphries 
style) and would love to find a place open to me dropping a bit. My mix can 
be found at http://www.acidplanet.com/artist.asp?songs=209764&T=2238 it is a 
bit old but the tracks still hold up. Please email off list if you have 
anything.

Subject: [sfraves] RE: Techno party you say?????

Ouch, thats a pretty harsh thing to say, i don't know you at all but come 
on, you can't say something like that then say thats constructive.  "you're 
scenesters who don't really *get* it." Thats just lame.

I don't want to start some big flame war here, but i think thats a bit rash, 
not everybody does parties the same, and you shouldn't shoot people down who 
are tryin something new, or taking risks.  you can't say its constructive at 
the end of a statement like that, the only reason youd do it is so you don't 
feel like a total asshole for saying stuff like that.  in turn it almost 
sounds like your the scenster tellin people where they are in the scene.

It sometimes seems like a lot of the people on this board straight shun you, 
if you haven't been playing techno for 15 years or somethin, and aren't best 
friends with everyone and go to all the "in" parties.

hence the reason i don't post very often.

Re:

I've been disapointed at a couple of DEFSF parties.  The impression I've
gotten from looking at how you manage your timeslots is you're scenesters
who don't really *get* it.

I mean that in the most constructive way possible.  Honestly.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Techno party you say?????

Upset?  No, I just questioned it.

Your lineup for that party at the Cell Space was atrociously concocted.  So
maybe Paradigm's Shift miscues were learning experiences, but to make the
same sorta mistakes twice kinda sucks.  :/  And while yes I am a bonafied
fan of Chris Jackson, my opinion is not solely based upon him.

Part of my misgivings with DEFSF also include how "Sean Ocean" portrayed
DEFSF as representative of the bay area techno scene on the So Cal Techno
list.  If you're still trying to figure techno out, why try to unify the
west coast techno scene?  Does the west end want to be unified in such a
way?  And by DEFSF?

Thankfully I don't think the droid.behavior folks bought it and I genuinely
hope they pass on your solicitation to participate in your Love Parade
float.  I wanted to send an e-mail to a few of them and tell them not to
base assumptions on the SF techno community (if one exists) on your crew or
your parties

But back to your lineup thing.  Yes, it's hard to choose who should play
when, but it looked like politics played too large a role in your most
recent efforts.  There didn't seem to be any sort of coherent flow.  No
organizational logic.

To imply I was butthurt that I had to wait until 4am to hear Chris play is a
good educated guess but still off.  :/  Scratch underneath the surface.
Then you'll get techno.  ;)

love always

Most dj's should be grateful to play, let alone get a headline spot - if
they EXPECT to get one, they need a 'tude check.

Nico, man, I don't want to get too "constructive" here, but you're too
passionate about techno not to be doing more about it. Sooner or later
you're going to realize what it is you want to do with techno and then
you're gonna be like, oh, shit, in order to do what I need to do, it
would be easier if I hadn't totally pissed off these techno promoters
by being all high and mighty and shit.

Then again you might not experience such a realization, shit, what do
I know, but seriously, you care this much, you should spin, or
produce, or something.

And don't be getting mad at me, either, cause I don't want to have to
ask any tall gorgeous women to bust out their fists of fury on you...

>>> etc etc etc

I have and always will be a fierce supporter of techno.  Isn't that enough?
(specifics are for resumes)

DJ Shockwave, I don't need to do anything for techno to thrive ... except
support.  The genre, and any respective regional scene in the world, is
strong enough on its own.  Techno artists will continue to produce it
whether it's profitable or not because they *love* it that much.  There's
more in a techno record than the track, there's also heart.

Last thing I'm stressing is whether or not I'm in the favor of party
promoters.  I have ambition but more importantly I have principles and
standards.  And a reverence for people who remain true to those, like all
the techno artists and likeminded lionhearts I've been fortunate enough to
get to know.

love always

n i c o

p.s. Say sup to the Constructocons, Starscream, and Megatron (not Mikey) for
me.

We just want to promote the music we love and unite the techno community.
Perhaps we're not going about it in a way you think is right, but at least
we're doing something.  Maybe we are naive, but we are just trying to
create parties with heart and a community that cares.  That's all.

there are alot of policies and new rules to cellspace that few people have 
yet experienced. our initial goal was to have a two room party with an electro 
room in the gallery and a techno room in the main. we learned late that the 
gallery space was unavailable and had to painfully cancel alot of our talent and 
put all of us in a tight spot. combined with the fact that nobody i knew had 
issues with the date, even though it was exactly before easter, made us 
somewhat confident we could pull through anyway. call it overconfidence but we all 
mistakes and then we move on. no one is born as an established crew.

by creating DEFsf i saw it as a unifying point for so many isolated crews 
hammering away at starting their own techno scenes in their cities then fading 
out.. frustrated they made only a small impact. DEF is a method for all these 
crews to communicate and support each other. i am not DEF, i am one small active 
part who maybe naively but enthusiasticly wants to see the techno scene 
survive. thats for you, me & anybody who agrees with that goal.

i'm really happy for what the droids have done in L.A. they should be a model 
for all other techno crews. from what it seems, they also support our ideas 
and continue to do so. 

i agree that i'm not sf techno. `;) that would be silly. nor is DEF 
clearchannel or groove radio `;P there are sooo many great techno artists that never 
get heard in the bay but are internationally known. SF has some of the most 
forward thinking techno producers in the world, bar none. i hope that last 
statement remains true and SF becomes a future techno world leader. but if only 
people can think that can happen, is when it does. that's why i think there could 
be a west coast techno scene. people out here have a different take on what 
techno is and can be. the possibility assisting in creating this new techno sound 
from the west with all these people (as few as they are now) coming together 
to talk about it is why DEF exists. and for me that's exciting. `;) call it 
political but that's why DEF is what it is.

 i could have easily just been that dj with that soundsystem sending out mp3s 
hoping to reel in that promoter or agent. dealing with DEF is pain in the ass 
`;) but i love techno and want to see it flourish.

we should talk about this more face to face to get your imput on how to 
improve ourselves and the scene. like you've said, constructively. i agree with 
alot of your misgivings of what you've seen of us, but i'm positive they are just 
improper impressions so far. anything you have seen of us that you feel is 
negative, please let us know, and right away. i'm always willing to hear it str8 
up. 

thanks for your interest in DEF and hope to see you at the next one.`;)

Watch the BSP's on this list, fer cryin' out loud. Hugger-Mugger is a
Tuesday nigth weekly now, you have no excuse to miss it. It's a damned
shame there were only 10 people listening when I played last night!

I'm not bitter, mind you... I've certainly played for less. But c'mon,
people whine on this list about the lack of "good" techno, then they
can't be bothered to go out and actually try something new. I've already
listed a couple of these in a very recent thread, but here are a couple
of regular events to watch out for:

Hugger-Mugger @ Lit Lounge, 6th and Mission, SF
Techno, electro, breaks, gettotech. Kick-ass residents include AndyW, Li
Sasaki, Forest Green, Clairity and Juan Segovia. Rumor is they'll have
me back soon, but don't let my absence stop you from going (hah).
Hugger-Mugger is EVERY TUESDAY NIGHT!

SODA @ the Rx Gallery, Eddy and Mason, SF
Philip Sherburne runs this one. It's branded as "minimal techno", but
this party covers much more ground than that. Philip writes for
XLR8R--check the new issue's interview with Michael Mayer for a sample
of his most excellent work. SODA's every third Saturday of the month,
but I don't see any mention of it on the Rx Gallery site now. Philip,
what's the score?

Shazbot on Throwdown.com,
<http://www.throwdown.com/throwdown/live/live.asp>
I do an internet broadcast from In House records every Monday night from
6-8pm focusing on the deep, minimal end of techno, with a splash of
house to placate the store's regulars. Listen and watch, and don't be
afraid to join in the chat if you have something to say. Remember,
that's EVERY MONDAY NIGHT.

Somebody add to this list. There's got to be some shit out there that I
don't know about. And if anyone's interested in putting something new
together, let the list know! There are many very talented, ambitious
tech heads here just itching to unleash their music on the unsuspecting
bay area populace.

Cheers,

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Techno party you say?????

Yea man - cuz like, Techno is PURE man - it's the REAL DEAL man. I am down
for the techno posse homie.

Without further adieu - the lyrics to "Sensitive Artist" by King Missile

I am a sensitive artist.
Nobody understands me because I am so deep.
In my work I make allusions to books that nobody else has read,
Music that nobody else has heard,
And art that nobody else has seen.
I can't help it
Because I am so much more intelligent
And well-rounded
Than everyone who surrounds me.
I stopped watching tv when I was six months old
Because it was so boring and stupid
And started reading books
And going to recitals
And art galleries.
I don't go to recitals anymore
Because my hearing is too sensitive
And I don't go to art galleries anymore
Because there are people there
And I can't deal with people
Because they don't understand me.
I stay home
Reading books that are beneath me,
And working on my work,
Which no one understands
I am sensitive...
I am a sensitive artist...

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Techno party you say?????

KING MISSILE IS THE BOMB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

"jesus was way cool." oh my god that song was so great.

"Jesus was way cool
Everybody liked Jesus
Everybody wanted to hang out with him
Anything he wanted to do, he did
He turned water into wine
And if he wanted to
He could have turned wheat into marijuana
Or sugar into cocaine
Or vitamin pills into amphetamines

He walked on the water
And swam on the land
He would tell these stories
And people would listen
He was really cool"

Subject: Re: [sfraves] techno DJs

Shawn, thanks for the mention (and sorry I didn't make it to Hugger Mugger
-- I was here, pounding away at a feature on Thomas Melchior, as it
happens). Soda is most definitely still going on every third Saturday at Rx
Gallery. And in fact this week we've got a special installment: Tomorrow
night we'll be hosting the after-party (if, uh, you can call something that
begins at 9pm an "after") for the Multiverse opening at Rx. Come one come
all!

With techno, part of the problem is always that no one really agrees on what
"techno" is -- admittedly what we play tends to hew to the more minimal end
of the spectrum, and that's where it even picks up aspects of house music
along the way (esp with the Perlon/Playhouse releases). For my money, that's
where most of the innovation is these days -- in labels like Traum, Trapez,
Musik Krause, all these cats really reinventing the "minimal" from the
inside out, with tight microsyncopations, layers upon layers of interlocking
grooves, and wild tone color. For the poster that thought minimal techno was
harder to mix (or easier to mix poorly) simply because it was so spacious,
I'd guess that these tracks are very different from what you're thinking of
as minimal bangers. That said, it still isn't easy to mix! (And I still
think you can tell when a house DJ flubs it as well.)

Anyway, come on down. In addition to the minimal we're playing lots of
sassy, more electro-ish, punkish stuff (Black Strobe, et al) with a healthy
dose of acid.

And anyone who's really down to throw a proper warehouse techno party, I'd
love to work on that.

Philip

And here I was thinking you guys were talking about the defunct Missle 
records. I was just writing to someone telling them what type of techno 
Labels and artitsts I liked and I forgot to include Missle records!! Damn 
it.. Now keep on mind missle also produced alot of Shitty techno!! or what 
some of you tecno geeks might call "Intelligent techno" Which I thought was 
un-dance floor friendly crap.. it is "CD" music or "Cleaning your house 
techno" you know the stuff that you just have playing in the background.

for your listening pleasures while you're doing your chores...

some of that stuff works well in chillrooms. oddly enough though I
have a great-aunt in Santa Rosa who is 92 years old and her fridge
actually makes some of the best chillroom techno I've ever heard. it
basically sounds like a forest of robot birds, or some kind of ambient
dub made with a series of cascading, heavily reverbed 303s. honestly
you could hook this thing up to a PA and straight up own the
chillroom.

plus your beer would stay cool.

Speaking of cool sounds, Ohlone community college in Fremont has a
hydrolic operated elevator that makes some very strange and cool sounds
when you are sitting in the main administration office area. I've wanted
to sample that for ages. It's this neat reverberated "whooooshhh" sound.

whoa!! and someone told me they died off a while back..

Hmmm that is strange they must not do alot of realeases then, cause when I 
still did play techno Missles were few and far between.

Well Good for them! hopefully they are still putting out solid stuff for the 
most part.

It's all about Lottery machines.  played in a band once, where the drummer
wrote a whole tune around the rhythm that came out of the lottery machine at

Speaking of cool sounds, Ohlone community college in Fremont has a
hydrolic operated elevator that makes some very strange and cool sounds
when you are sitting in the main administration office area. I've wanted
to sample that for ages. It's this neat reverberated "whooooshhh" sound.

Please! Someone have me play in their event! I CAN beatmatch,
phrasematch, and please a crowd!

I've been looking for that "forest of robot birds" sound for ages...

We're DJs, not monks.  Some people do certain things better.  I started
out playing last/morning slot at almost every party I played, and worked
my way up from there.  I've been doing this long enough to know what I do
well.  If you're doing me a favor by booking me, don't.  Book me because
what I offer is what you want.  Your DJs should be doing you the favor by
playing.

Me, personally, I totally hear that some people are more "peak hour"
material than others.  Chris Jackson for example, can totally drive the
bus peak hour and deserves that slot... or just prior... his sound is
really energetic and compelling and almost never goes flat on a crowd.  I
have a different style, and usually find my groove a little later in the
night (I'm just a weirder monkey I guess).  At a party, that means 3-4am,
where I can land the UFOs.  At a club, lemme close it down and own last
call and that's my best work usually.  That's not ego, it's where I've
seen me do my best and I think it's dumb to apologize for that.  Book me
at another hour, and you'll get my best attempt at meeting the needs of
that time of evening, but it's ok to believe I'm better at some things
than others.

It SUCKS when you know you could totally take people there but your set is
at like 9pm or 5am, and you're watching some jackoff just not cut it
right when people need to get their shit worked.  Yes, it happens, but
it's a disservice to the crowd, to the flow... it's a sign the promoter
either made an error (usually a result of not listening to DJs prior to
booking them), or has the wrong priorities (values favor network and
personal relationships over presenting a quality event to their
attendees).

That said, another big consideration a lot of people miss is playing to
the slot you're assigned.  Nosebleed kick yer arse shit shouldn't be
played at 10pm, it's just dumb (well, most of the time, sometimes it's a
good idea, a good DJ can tell).  Don't play trippy goony stuff at a club
at 10pm where nobody is high.  Don't play the same records the DJ before
you played. If the room is hitting 1000 degrees, make some space in the
music so people can breathe for a second before taking the energy up
again.

I'd really like to recommend people consider this for lineups:

10-12 opening slot
12-1:30 compelling raise the energy level stuff
1:30-3:30 headliner
3:30-5:00 lower but sustained energy, but solid dj with maybe more soul
5:00-7:00 more cerebral,emotional stuff, slower

You give your opener and closer 2 hours each.  All the other slots are 1.5
hours (if your headliner is from outside the area kick em a 2 hour set
too, they'll love it).  You place your headliner in the most appropriate
slot.

Stop worrying so much about politics and friendships and book people where
they belong, not where they "deserve" cause they booked you last month..
that's a total disservice to the crowd (who is who you should be doing
this for).  The favor network is how we get the same lineups over and over
and over here... which is exactly why we get kids dropping out of the
scene thinking they've seen it all after only a couple months.  And who
can blame them, the last 5 parties they attended were identical...

If I could see one major change in the way that parties are done here, I'd
like it to be less DJs, change em up more, better DJs, longer slots and
stop booking 8 DJs that all play peak hour stuff and calling that a
lineup.  Yes, that probably means we all get booked less often... but it
would make for better parties.  This shit where we have sub-one hour slots
is fucked up... that's how you get a lot of names on the flyer, but it
doesn't serve those people who just start to get into a DJs groove just
before they're kicked off for DJ #5848383.

Quality not Quantity, Altitude not Attitude, pave new ground but learn
from those who came before.

You, my friend, are brilliant. Everything is 100% on point from my 
perspective.

These things are sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo simple 
yet still are rarely practiced. Great advice for promoter and deejay alike!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Techno party you say?????

I would agree with most of this, because really - you make all extremely
valid points.

I guess it's just that I have been to so many parties where lineups were
rock solid, and one or two dj's act like primadonnas about spots. This is
typically where I'd agree with you and say that any quality promoter should
be able to figure out what style/energy level goes best where - but then if
you have a pissy DJ who still thinks he/she should be elsewhere on the
lineup - what do you do? (and there are more than plenty of these type folks
around)

That's more why I was saying "you should be grateful you're fucking playing"
than any other reason. I personally feel folks liek that should get the big
heave-ho - but that's just me. I'm fairly intolerant of snotty people.

All that being said - I'm w/ Jonas R - if any of you folks need an opener,
or closing DJ - never hesitate to hit me up, cuz I will play anywhere, and
have material that fits in any time slot you stick me in.... :)

You can their shit and get someone else that does what you had in mind.

Hint:

promoter (pro-mo-ter) n. - a meta DJ, who creates a set that lasts for the
entire party using DJs as a unit of expression the same way a DJ would use
records.  Should they encounter a fucked up DJ, treat exactly as a DJ
would treat a skipping record.

I'm not opposed to working with people, but I'll be honest and state that
when I do a lineup, I schedule the slot and unless their reason is damn
good (i have to get a babysitter, i can't be in town then cause I have a
bris I must attend, etc) they get DA DICK [tm].  That goes back to the
friend's network I talked about.  If you're a promoter, and you're in it
for the right reasons, that shit shouldn't sway you whatsoever.

Some of the best music I've ever heard in any genre
was a tag team on four decks by Derrick May and Kevin
Saunderson at a Club called Red at WMC a few years
back (maybe 2000?).  They played some glitchy techno,
tech house, and I don't know some other shit that
totally rocked.  Saunderson came out on the floor and
danced himself.  Ken Ishii (sp?) followed and rocked
also.  Of course the fact that I got in for free and
was given several gigantic red bulls and vodka didn't
hurt either.

Good techno is good, damn good.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] techno DJs

Yea - I feel the same about almost every tiem I've seen John Aquaviva jam.
That mofo is on like Tron. I know some people consider him to be more on the
house side of things - but only once out of the 5 or 6 times I have seen
him, has he spun housier shit. Normally he plays really throbby, sexy,
thumping shit.

I'm used to techno being more pounding tho - like Hawtin, Chris Liberator
(guess that's "acid" techno), Mistress Barbara, Jon Williams, Adam Beyer,
Rush and a mess of others.

One of the links someone sent to me yesterday sounded WAY more like house
than it did techno - albeit more like glitchy type house, but it just didn't
sound like techno to me. Then again - I play the gamut of breaks -
everything from super-bangin', almost jungly nuskool, to acid breaks,
electro, prog - even some tranced out shit.

I'm excited to be in an area where there's a varied selection of sounds to
be exposed to, rather than the cookie cutter club formula everywhere you go.

woot.

Thanks for the links thus far tho people - keep 'em coming!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Techno party you say?????

	I'll chime in here and agree with you guys. Line-up space is too 
limited to waste it on jerks -- they should be invited to take a 
one-way flight out of town on Flying Fuck Airlines. I'd rather go to a 
party with no-name DJs who have good attitudes than to an event with a 
bunch of stuck-up superstars. The fact that the DJs are cool people 
means the party is more likely to have a good vibe, because probably 
some of their friends will be there too, and nice people tend to have 
nice friends. And conversely if they are jerks, what kind of friends 
are they likely to have? When it comes to raves, decent music and a 
great vibe definitely beats terrific music and no vibe in my book.

Groove on,

Subject: Re: [sfraves] TELIC.. Post #2- Am i wrong about this?

Wow...  Osby, formerly the ardent supporter and defender of security=20
types, (including the worst, most thug-like, examples of the lot...=20
1015's) finally sees their kind for what they truly are.

This whole thread reminded me of a realization I came to not long ago. =20=

And I spent some time wondering if I should even post on the topic,=20
given my earlier history of doing little but get pissed off and rant.

I realized when entering "Different", a party thrown by a promoter=20
whose parties I had enjoyed in the past, and whom I used to have a lot=20=

of respect in his capacity as a promoter, that I was putting up, at=20
parties, with exactly the same kind of door gauntlet bullshit that led=20=

me to swear off clubs, way back when.  That realization just totally=20
fucked up my whole night, and I left the party after only the first=20
hour or so.  Just no way I was going to be able to have a good time,=20
after that.

The difference is, I guess, that when I first moved to SF and started=20
going to 1015 with my dotcom buddies, it came as a rude shock to me. =20
The way 1015 treats their customers was unheard-of in Florida's live=20
punk and ska music scene (where I got my music fix before I got to SF).=20=

  So getting felt up, and the "you vill empty your pocket or ve vill=20
open fire" routine, at 1015 was a rude shock.  I gave them more chances=20=

than they deserved to rectify their behavior, with no change.  So=20
eventually I just started finding excuses not to go out clubbing; and=20
finally decided to give it up.

Not long after that, I met Osby, and through him, just about everyone=20
in the bay area (That is to say, I was introduced, Osby-style, to just=20=

about everyone.  Knowing any more than "that's someone Osby pointed out=20=

to me sometime" came much later.).  And I seriously started to fall=20
into the rave scene.  And, at that time, and at least at the parties=20
*I* found myself at, even the "candy" side of the scene rarely asked=20
anything more than a quick pat-down.

But over the intervening years, promoters seemed to forget what the "R"=20=

in plur stands for: RESPECT.

Security at parties got worse and worse.  Worse than that, I found=20
myself modifying my OWN habits to make the security process less of a=20
hassle.  And it hit me, just after getting in the door at "Different",=20=

that, except for conspiring with, and threatening to sell people out=20
to, the pigs themselves; security at (many) parties had turned into the=20=

same thuggery I despised about clubs.

I've only been to a couple of parties since then; and then only at the=20=

insistence of friends that I *MUST* go.

I wonder if I've finally crossed the threshold into jadedness.


cya,
john

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

alright here we go kids... check this out...
all confirmed now, d&a and phase 2 have teamed up to make sure it happens: just confirmed are 5 of the uk's hotest hard dance djs. this event is going to be at one of everyones favroite venues... if you buy presales you can go to the other show the next night too for $20, thats right only $20 to see even more uk hard house headliners...
you will get 2 nights of partying with a total of 7 uk headliners and 4 national!!!
our goal is to bring the best for the scene.. this is a milestone for the sf hard dance and trance scene. be there as the story unfolds...

the full line-up is done, check it out...

Eufex - Birmingham, UK - Nukleuz, Vicious Circle, Honey Pot
The name Eufex might not ring a bell from the go for everyone, but he has been around since HardHouse was in its mere infancy. Strangely, he is by far THE most under rated producer that Hard Dance has ever seen. Sean Stanley is the force behind many brilliant releases on early HH labels such as Arriba & TYT as well as prominent labels Nukleuz, Vicious Circle, Honey Pot & his now defunct Ravage Records. He has also collaborated with Jay-B for classic releases like Hypnotica on Kaktai Records, the massive anthem Vacuum Packed on Pump, plus tracks on Chris Cs now defunct projects, Aztec & Nile. 
Even though Sean has awe-inspiring skills as a producer & engineer, releases on very reputable labels, an involvement in the scene spreading over many years & one of the most professional attitudes in the industry, there was never a massive following of his music. Somehow people were overlooking a genius. 
Sean shocked many when he decided to take a break and concentrate his energy elsewhere. However, he couldnt shelf his love for the genre and wrote more original tracks & remixes whilst also working with various artists outside of Hard Dance. Hes back in 2004 with two remixes on Scottish hard label Lit Up and he has a promising Live PA with a host of new material and remixes ready to unleash in the coming months.

I say you don't go in if you have security assholes like that. Then you turn
around and call the cops on their party. Fucked up? *Very* If you can't put
on a party correctly you have no right doing it. What gives myself or anyone
that right? Consumer rights yo. Make shitty security and party throwers go
away. File a harrassment charge against the security. Zero tollerance. Zero
patience. If everyone accepted that as their policy I bet you shit would
change quickly and a lot of parties would cease to exist. This is the land
of do as you please and I'm king.

Wow...  Osby, formerly the ardent supporter and defender of security
types, (including the worst, most thug-like, examples of the lot...
1015's) finally sees their kind for what they truly are.

This whole thread reminded me of a realization I came to not long ago.
And I spent some time wondering if I should even post on the topic,
given my earlier history of doing little but get pissed off and rant.

I realized when entering "Different", a party thrown by a promoter
whose parties I had enjoyed in the past, and whom I used to have a lot
of respect in his capacity as a promoter, that I was putting up, at
parties, with exactly the same kind of door gauntlet bullshit that led
me to swear off clubs, way back when.  That realization just totally
fucked up my whole night, and I left the party after only the first
hour or so.  Just no way I was going to be able to have a good time,
after that.

The difference is, I guess, that when I first moved to SF and started
going to 1015 with my dotcom buddies, it came as a rude shock to me.
The way 1015 treats their customers was unheard-of in Florida's live
punk and ska music scene (where I got my music fix before I got to SF).
  So getting felt up, and the "you vill empty your pocket or ve vill
open fire" routine, at 1015 was a rude shock.  I gave them more chances
than they deserved to rectify their behavior, with no change.  So
eventually I just started finding excuses not to go out clubbing; and
finally decided to give it up.

Not long after that, I met Osby, and through him, just about everyone
in the bay area (That is to say, I was introduced, Osby-style, to just
about everyone.  Knowing any more than "that's someone Osby pointed out
to me sometime" came much later.).  And I seriously started to fall
into the rave scene.  And, at that time, and at least at the parties
*I* found myself at, even the "candy" side of the scene rarely asked
anything more than a quick pat-down.

But over the intervening years, promoters seemed to forget what the "R"
in plur stands for: RESPECT.

Security at parties got worse and worse.  Worse than that, I found
myself modifying my OWN habits to make the security process less of a
hassle.  And it hit me, just after getting in the door at "Different",
that, except for conspiring with, and threatening to sell people out
to, the pigs themselves; security at (many) parties had turned into the
same thuggery I despised about clubs.

I've only been to a couple of parties since then; and then only at the
insistence of friends that I *MUST* go.

I wonder if I've finally crossed the threshold into jadedness.


cya,
john

Subject: [sfraves] Looking for Track ID "Crazy Acid Shit"

Ok i know this is gonna be a shot in the dark here, but i'm looking for the 
name and artist of a record i heard a long time ago, i think it was probably 
around 96 or 97.  I dont remember much about it.  i just remember that on 
the label on the record it said "Crazy Acid Shit" all over it, and the 
sample in the song said "Crazy Acid Shit" but it would be all tripped out 
and stuff.  That's about all the info i have on it, since i was on crazy 
acid shit at the time...I've tried Gemm.com but couldnt find it there, so i 
figured maybe one of you guys out there in SFR land would have heard it or 
seen it or something.  hopefully one of you has.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] TELIC.. Post #2- Am i wrong about this?

I don't think you have gone to the "darkside" (being jaded). You just don't
want to tolerate bullshit, and really, who can blame you?

I tend to (like Apollo) only frequent spots that DON'T do a patdown. Not
because I like to smuggle in drugs (I rarely do them at clubs, if ever), but
because I think it's ridiculous. I mean - if they are THAT PRESSED about
guns, install metal detectors like Twilo had. But any smart person is
getting the drugs in regardless of whether or not security feels up your
balls or not on the way in the door. Shit - I used to do security at punk
clubs and strip bars, and I know how easy it is, no matter how thorough you
are - to miss things coming through the door. Real security takes care of
the problem when it happens. Real security is stealthy enough to roam the
dancefloor and nab people "in the act". They don't harass the shit out of
everyone on the assumption that every person walking through the door is a
drug toting gangsta. That's just silly.

Anyhoo...bla bla bla.

Wow...  Osby, formerly the ardent supporter and defender of security
types, (including the worst, most thug-like, examples of the lot...
1015's) finally sees their kind for what they truly are.

This whole thread reminded me of a realization I came to not long ago.
And I spent some time wondering if I should even post on the topic,
given my earlier history of doing little but get pissed off and rant.

I realized when entering "Different", a party thrown by a promoter
whose parties I had enjoyed in the past, and whom I used to have a lot
of respect in his capacity as a promoter, that I was putting up, at
parties, with exactly the same kind of door gauntlet bullshit that led
me to swear off clubs, way back when.  That realization just totally
fucked up my whole night, and I left the party after only the first
hour or so.  Just no way I was going to be able to have a good time,
after that.

The difference is, I guess, that when I first moved to SF and started
going to 1015 with my dotcom buddies, it came as a rude shock to me.
The way 1015 treats their customers was unheard-of in Florida's live
punk and ska music scene (where I got my music fix before I got to SF).
  So getting felt up, and the "you vill empty your pocket or ve vill
open fire" routine, at 1015 was a rude shock.  I gave them more chances
than they deserved to rectify their behavior, with no change.  So
eventually I just started finding excuses not to go out clubbing; and
finally decided to give it up.

Not long after that, I met Osby, and through him, just about everyone
in the bay area (That is to say, I was introduced, Osby-style, to just
about everyone.  Knowing any more than "that's someone Osby pointed out
to me sometime" came much later.).  And I seriously started to fall
into the rave scene.  And, at that time, and at least at the parties
*I* found myself at, even the "candy" side of the scene rarely asked
anything more than a quick pat-down.

But over the intervening years, promoters seemed to forget what the "R"
in plur stands for: RESPECT.

Security at parties got worse and worse.  Worse than that, I found
myself modifying my OWN habits to make the security process less of a
hassle.  And it hit me, just after getting in the door at "Different",
that, except for conspiring with, and threatening to sell people out
to, the pigs themselves; security at (many) parties had turned into the
same thuggery I despised about clubs.

I've only been to a couple of parties since then; and then only at the
insistence of friends that I *MUST* go.

I wonder if I've finally crossed the threshold into jadedness.


cya,
john

dave synth (aka d syn) CAN play incredible techno sets
- dark, minimal and pounding.  but it's no guarantee
he'll play a set like that when he plays, and might
play more electro-y.  also, if he's playing last,
it'll be more experimental.  catch him at spaz
parties.  

i heard dj yap play a great set at, uh, was it the
party where adam x played last year?  (adam x sucked,
by the way. )  though i did hear it was one of his
best sets, so i don't know if he consistently plays
that well or not.  

unfortunately, i find a lot of the sf techno i've
heard to be kind of boring, just the same relentless,
repetitive beat, and not at all trance-inducing or
intricate.  

haven't heard forest green play lately but i hear good
things about her.  

i've also heard that sutekh live has been amazing.  

wish kit clayton played out more often.  last time i
heard him dj (at the top, last year, i think, at an
early riot), he was great.

uh, except that it's a tuesday night and i've got to
work in the a.m.  sorry, but i just can't make it out
on a tuesday in the city (i live in the beast gay, er
east bay) unless it's something extra-special.  it's
just the way it is.  i'm getting older and sleep is my
friend.  (hell, i even missed dj godfather when he was
here cuz it was a tuesday, though i definitely regret
that.)  

anyway, i hope some folks w/ more energy than me make
it out to your weekly.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] more on sf techno

one of my all time "Trance-Inducing" records if you can even classify it as 
techno cause I know some will argue it is "Trance" but I have dropped it 
into a techno set and it fit is:

777 Alpha wave  on Astral werks..  that with richie hawtins spastik over the 
top and you have the makings for making a crowd loose there freakin minds!! 
Now that is trancey techno..

Subject: Re: [sfraves] more on sf techno

I like Kenji Ogura's "Kreissage Typ B" over top of Armand Van Helden's
"Neccessary Evil". I'm not 100% sure either track is straight up techno, but
together they make one storming techno monster. Maybe not entirely trance
inducing - but holy shit does it devastate a dancefloor.

I don't know if this was directed at me or not, but I wouldn't take
offense if it were. The question is: where do you draw the line? Techno
overlaps house in tempo and structure. Most people refer to me as a
house DJ, but I don't really think I am... I may play things on the
housier end when it's appropriate, but I'd much rather play what I think
of as techno. However, because most people just think of drum trax when
they hear the word "techno", I can't refer to myself as a "techno DJ". I
want to change that perception.

"Tech-house" is a convenient term, but nobody seems to know what the
hell it is. I can't get booked at house events *or* techno events when I
refer to my style as "tech-house". :\

So when I draw the line, I err on the side of techno. Stuff on labels
like Poker Flat doesn't necessarily fall on either side, but Steve Bug
is most certainly a techno icon. Kompakt is another label that defies
even the most simple classifications, right up to the latest EP by
SCSI-9 (which discogs files under "Minimal, Ambient, House"). John
Tejada produces a wide variety of styles, but I'd call even his housiest
efforts (stuff on Palette and Playhouse) techno. Terms like "microhouse"
attempt to distance the most minimal techno from the tougher stuff, but
I don't see any need for that distinction. I'd like to think that
peoples' tastes are diverse enough that they would appreciate both ends
of the spectrum.

I'd say that house is really just a style of techno--one defined by a
more narrow tempo range and a smaller subset of instruments and
structures. Under that classification scheme, it's easy for me to call
most of what I play "techno". ;)

Cheerio,

Subject: Re: [sfraves] "techno" DJs

Twasn't you I was referring to  - it was that Carceri fellow.

Personally, I'm not versed enoguh in what is or is not techno to be able to 
distinguish between the subgenres, or the extreme ends of the spectrum. I 
just knows what I hear, and what sounds more like what to me. The mix I 
listened to that the kid posted was labled as techno - and sounded liek 
house to me. It wasn't at all bad - I liked it, but (like I said earlier) 
techno to ME has always been the more pounding, almost industrial sounding 
shit. No, I don't mean it all sounds like Front 242 or Frontline Assembly - 
but I mean, a very mechanical, pounding, machine-like sound. Chock full o' 
909's, those wacky rewind-sounding samples, driving basslines, etc.

I guess tech-house would make sense - because it had elements of "techno" 
(as I'm familiar with it), but had a much more house-like feel. Melodies, 
pads, a smidge funky, lower BPM, etc.

Anyhoo...

The mix that Carceri posted is "pure" or "real" techno.

I'd agree with most of what you said, but I would tend to classify the
two as parallel branches of the same tree- the 4-on-the-floor tree. 
House, I think has as wide or wider a pallete of acceptable sounds than
techno does.  There is organic, live-playing-laden house, there's
rough, techy house, there's house that can hardly even be called
"House" but for sharing the signature bounce and mindframe house comes
from.  Techno by its very definition, is "techy", as in, largely
created out of synthetic or greatly altered sounds.  There are live
instruments in techno here and there, but I think they appear mainly
for contrast or novelty's sake.  Techno, also, is known for its rigid,
unswung timing- machine-like.  When techno swings, people call it
tech-house (or funky techno), because house's biggest defining factor
is just that, its swing.  It starts with that and then the sounds that
follow that pattern take on an attitude from that rythmic "soul", so to
speak.

..and then, when you flatten out the timing of house, to make it latin,
or more techy, those very sounds that earlier were informed by the
swing that house embodies are what keeps ties to the "house" sound.  So
you have house that feels like techno and sounds like house, and house
that feels like house but sounds like techno.  In the end, because of
the inclusion of one or more elements from the other genre, the
boundaries are stretched- but everyone's got a line in them that once
something crosses to this side, the left brain says "house!", and to
that side, "techno!".

To me, it's the swing, and the mood, that delineates them.  Then again,
maybe it's best not to give a shit! :)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] "techno" DJs

I'm glad you checked out the mix. My posting was a bit
tongue in cheek... I don't actually think of myself as
a shitty "techno" dj. Techno for lack of a better
term. I think it applies to most of the electronic
music that I enjoy. I stopped using the term
tech-house. Although i play techno and house, there
was just too much bullshit music coming out labeling
itself "tech-house". I think any of the
"micro-genre's" get boring when layed down for an hour
straight.

Techno =
Electro
Banging Loop Techno
Soulful Melodic Techno
Micro-Glitch whatever
ElectroClash haha
Acid House
House (Tech or not)
Broken Beat/Nu Jazz
Beat Down
Boogie Disco
Disco Punk
All kinds of Wave
Down Tempo
D&B
Neptunes
Missy Elliot
Outkast
Dance Hall/Reggae

It's all techno to me. GeorgeC gave a pretty good
interpritation of relation between 4/4 house and
techno, but once it goes past the 4/4 it's back to the
drawing board. So fuck it.

Not shitty at all...I liked the mix. Pretty blippy and glitchy, and not in a
crappy way. Mixing seemed pretty fluid, tracks progressed nicely. Not bad at
all.

EXACTLY!  Had MTV not dubbed the fucking Prodigy and
Crystal 'GHB' Method as techno we wouldn't be having
this conversation of what the meaning 'techno'
actually refers to.  Hell, on Howard Stern this
morning they were making fun of a 'techno' song that
was really a fairly deep, musical house track!  The
fucking electronic music mainstream should have just
stuck with 'electronica' when refering to these so
called 'techno' songs or artists..would have surely
kept my stress level down!

blah!

tech YES,

I don't agree with that at all! Techno includes in its palette all the
sounds of house, *in addition to* the infinite number of derivative
sounds that can be formed from various effects and manipulations.
Instruments shared by both styles are (for the most part) limited to
specific uses in house music, whereas techno prides itself on the
ability to misuse and abuse them.

Historically, techno was built on the sounds of house music, some of
which ended up getting twisted into completely new sounds that separated
the music they were part of from the realm of house. But then house
ended up taking cues from techno, and since the late 80's both styles
have been collectively referred to by the public as "techno", for better
or for worse.

Well, the same can be said for any style of electronic music. :)

OK, how about so-called "UK tech", then (Grant Dell, Gideon Jackson,
Richard Grey, et al): house or techno? By your definition, most of the
stuff these guys put out is techno because it uses "techy" percussion
and lacks swing. But I don't really know anyone that would refer to it
as "techno". I'd call it "tech-house", but...

First of all, there's a ton of house that lacks any swing whatsoever
(see above). There's also a ton of techno that's swung to all hell
(albeit, sometimes just for the sake of being off-kilter). And as for
"soul", the term itself is open to much interpretation. Attitude is a
much more worthy delineating factor, since house generally tends toward
the happier, more celebratory end of the emotional spectrum. But
obviously, all but the most contrived styles of electronic music are
capable of conveying a wide variety of emotions, so that's no good.

That's exactly right. What I'd like to do is move that line further to
the left... because I think a lot of people are missing out on a ton of
really great music that suffers from being difficult to categorize. I
think house heads would appreciate a lot of what I refer to as "techno",
and I'm sure that some techno elitists would be into some of the stuff
that's often labeled as "house".

In general, I think people need to be more open-minded about electronic
music. Too many parties focus specifically on one style, neglecting
large swaths of the musical landscape because they don't match a certain
tempo range or "attitude". DJs cling to certain structures and sounds...
we're all guilty of it.

Sure, we've all got preferences, but I think there's a complacency among
performers and listeners alike that we need to escape. Personally, I
don't go out that much because I can't stand to hear the same shit all
night, good or not. Variety is the spice of life, you know.

I think Jack Triumph was actually on to something a couple of months
ago... we need more music reviews on this list. Let me offer up some of
my more recent ones:

Echopilot - I Don't Think So (Traum Shallplatten; Traum V49)
Bernhard Pucher is best known as the founder of the groundbreaking US
label Iron Box Music. Under his Echopilot guise, he tends to explore the
same themes as he does as Brian Aneurysm: particularly, loneliness. On
"Schwamm", Pucher displays a surprising vocal talent, pining "wie kann
es sein; wie kann ich so allein sein" (essentially, "I'm so alone") over
interlocking synths, bleeps and stuttering percussion. "Optical Centre"
(my favorite of the four) is a similarly rare moment of sublime
happiness that pairs his trademark quirky percussion with a bouncey
bassline and airy, freestyle keyboard flourishes. Both the title track
and "Finstere Zeiten" are more typical Brian Aneurysm material, with
Pucher's omninous, barely-sung vocals anchored by distorted scratches,
detuned drones and shuffled drum patterns. While a far cry from the
emotive sonic landscapes of his work with vocalist Cristy Jordan, these
two tracks are nonetheless useful tools in the hands of a capable DJ
looking to darken the mood a bit.

Audion - Kisses (Spectral Sound; SPC-15)
IMO, Matthew Dear missed the mark completely with his two most recent
attempts, "Anger Management" and the "Backstroke" mini-LP. There were
highlights, sure, but the overall quality of the releases made me wonder
whether or not Dear (and Spectral, for that matter) had simply lost his
steam. Well, if this release is any indication, Matthew and his label
seem to have found their stride once again. "Kisses" catches Dear at his
hardest and meanest yet, combining a relentless sub-bass and aggressive
modulating synth drone with his signature wild percussion--make no
mistake, this is one serious peak-time rollercoaster. On the flip, the
aptly-named "Titty Fuck" is an awkward, lumbering number that slowly
ratches up the mood with equal parts percussion and atonal synthesis,
building to an almost anticlimactic plateau of evil, grinding confusion.
"The Great Compromise" is only a compromise if you're debating the
merits of breakbeat and four-on-the-floor drum patterns. It starts off
with the former, injecting klanging mechanical stabs into the offbeat,
then evolves into the latter, forming a relentless minimal techno jam
reminiscent of his work on Richie Hawtin's Plus 8 label. This release
bodes well for the future of Spectral Sound. My only hope is that Mr.
Dear and his patronly label can muster the courage to release more stuff
like this.

John Tejada & Arian Leviste - Psycho Happiness (Palette; PAL-30)
What is John Tejada, if not consistent? Well, he's quirky as all hell of
late. Whether composing solo, or paired with like-minded composers like
Arian Leviste and Justin Maxwell, Tejada's style shines through as
uniquely interesting, deftly combining the techniques of more
experimental artists with a solid understanding of dance music theory.
"Psycho Happiness" is no exception, working equally well as either a
stand-alone piece or a DJ tool. The title track is a jacking long
player, rife with microsampled snippits lovingly arranged between
percussive elements for maximum dancefloor damage. On the flip, "Ghetto
Platypus" is a much more Perlon-esque adventure, with its downsampled
bleeps and scratches. "Me Always Want Go There" goes there, much more
funkily than the rest of the EP, notching up the chunk factor with a
saturated bass tones, and filling in the empty spaces with noisy (in a
good way) percussive flair. Tejada has made a name for himself by
consistently pulling off the stoney vibe of dubby techno with a
completely different sonic palette (hah). Much respect.

Rob Acid - Something (Treibstoff 2044)
Cologne's Robert Babicz isn't somebody I would've expected to see on
Treibstoff, and I was curious to hear what he's been up to. This EP
works, but it isn't for everybody. Neither of the tracks is very
DJ-friendly, with over-saturated compositions that lack traditional
build-ups and tear-downs, and lots of synths that are hard to get rid of
in the mix. That said... "Something" is my pick of the two, with its
deep, rolling bass and driving kick supporting the ever-present
discordant synth stabs and bizarre cello (?) croon. On the flip,
"Ceremony" is a spacey deep techno number with lots of airy synth
elements occupying a good deal of the frequency range--in fact, it gets
a bit too "tonal" for my tastes. This isn't your typical Treibstoff
fare, but I'm sure there's a time and a place for stuff like this...
Probably at home at night, baked out of your mind.

Monne Automne - Introducing Light & Sound (Lofi Stereo 026)
Lucien Nicolet heads the cast of a new outfit with WMF Records artist
Bucci and the little-known vocalist Argenis Brito, who collaborated with
SeÃ±or Coconut on his Latin Kraftwerkremake project, "El Baile AlemÃ¡n"
("The German Dance"). Their first release is a mini-LP of sorts,
containing a nice mix of minimal house and electro. "Teco" opens the A
side, pairing filtered electro percussion and bass with soft synth
stabs, for a distinctly retro feel that's probably more appropriate for
the lounge crowd than big dancefloors. On the inside, "Automne" is a
deep, dubby number that should be at home in the box of Mosaic fans,
with understated tribal percussive bits and a rolling, spacey vibe. On
the flip, "Argelulupier", "Mago" and "El Salvador" combine clicky
breakbeats with detuned IDM-style synths and subtle arrangements that
float from start to finish. Like Rob Acid's, this release isn't for
everyone... especially those that can't be bothered with much more than
the most straightforward club tracks. But for those of you looking for
something a bit more interesting, this should be a treat.

Anyone else? ;)

Cheers,

BlankI'm so down with this....

"In general, I think people need to be more open-minded about electronic
music. Too many parties focus specifically on one style, neglecting
large swaths of the musical landscape because they don't match a certain
tempo range or "attitude". DJs cling to certain structures and sounds...

I myself have been trying to find different genres that I can =
succesfully mix into my sets to give them more spice. Of course, I still =
mainly stick to braks - but some tech-house, prog., techno ,house and =
other assorted things give it zest...

Nothing wrong with mixin' it up a bit.

I ended up doing exactly this at a gig in the midwest this past weekend,
even though it was unintentional. :)  I noticed the crowd looked to be a
bit more on the mellow/older tip, so I started off with house.  Saw that
wasn't getting a reaction, so I started ramping it up through
progressive house, tech house and then ended with straight up bangin'
techno.  THAT was what they wanted all along.

Should have known that the midwest was still into the harder stuff. :)

sorry, is this actually true? maybe it's just a Chicago thing, maybe
it's just a me thing, but in the late 80s there were only two types of
people I knew who couldn't tell the difference between house and
techno -- grade-obsessed hyper-competitive nerdy types, and people
over 35. I mean even conservative guys who I knew through my parents'
church, suburban high school kids who loved Led Zeppelin and hated
both house **and** techno, they still knew that there was a difference
between them. but the guys I'm thinking of, one of them's an engineer
for rock bands now, and the other is a professional opera singer. so
they had more musical background than the average member of the
public, so maybe they're not a representative sample. I'm not sure.
but this statement that I'm quoting here, honestly, it just doesn't
feel true to me at all. something about that statement just feels so
totally wrong to me. I don't know. anyway. whatever.

I knew what he meant. The greater public at large has no idea about the

Really, ask some normal schmoe what DrumNBass is, and they look at you like
you're nuts. Same with braks, or downtempo, or tech-house....

"I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes 
me to tremble for the safety of my country.  As a result of the war, 
corporations have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places 
will follow, and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong 
its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth is 
aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed."
-Abraham Lincoln

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

  "I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of 
life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the 
beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club, 
party or other sound system that has ever achieved anything close to that..."
-Jeno, on the early days of Wicked and the Full Moon Raves

braks are grat.

I know what he means too, it's like the way most "classical" music is
really "baroque" or "romantic" from the point of view of a classical
musician or whatever. I don't know, though, there's still something
about it that feels a bit off or whatever.

anyway, uh, keyboards. the nice thing about the Bay Area is that the
easiest way to replace a broken keyboard is to walk around the Upper
Haight for a while until you find one that somebody left out on the
street corner as a freebie. for real...

Subject: [sfraves] Pimping, Music and Muscle Ripping

--=====================_2152074==.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

A couple of days ago I sprained my ankle.  Level 2 sprain, it seems, with 
swelling and significant pain.  So I'm chair-bound with an ice pack on my 
ankle, chock full of pain killers and anti-inflammatory drugs, pretty 
spaced out, importing tracks from my CD collection into I Tunes.  Forgive 
any drug-induced errors:)  Since I have nothing else I can do, I thought 
I'd write to you whilst listening to all this amazing music -- much of 
which I haven't heard in many years.

I have lots of music on CDs, but I was surprised at the number of excellent 
old school hip hop and rap tracks in the collection.  Practically every 
musical genre is represented in the stacks, with a heavy emphasis on house 
(of course), industrial and punk rock.  Good heavens, I've discovered CD 
house compilations from the late 80's that feature covers advertising 
"underground" dance music with tattooed guys in combat boots dancing 
pictured in the art.

Ah yes...and Motown.  Listening to "First I Look at the Purse" by the 
Contours right now.  The lyrics describe a gold digger.  Used to play this 
stuff at high school dances.

I'm sampling each CD, taking out the tracks I really like and classifying 
them for use in Final Scratch, Ableton Live, some serious remixing, etc., 
and just enjoyment on the I POD.  I've become disenchanted at the sound 
quality delivered by the I Trip device and I think I required a better way 
to listen to this music in my ride.

Segue.  Pimping my ride.

The past few weeks have been dark and stressful for me.  My only brother 
had two heart attacks, "died" twice, had six valves replaced in his heart 
and returned home to find his heroin-addicted son had attempted 
suicide.   The very intimate communications with my brother recently have 
warped me back to my teenage years.  Back then, my brother and I loved 
three things:  music, cars and sex.  We may have disagreed on the sex, but 
we worked on the music and cars together.  We organized a rock band, the 
Undertakers, with Greg on keyboards and me on drums and, often, bass 
guitar.  I also DJed with my friend Bill.  As  for cars, they were powerful 
and neither of us were interested in "stock" offerings.  My pimped up 1960 
Buick Invicta Convertible --- there was a ride.  Several GTOs.  The '69 
Firebird Transam.  Old Vets.

So....I have not indulged my automotive "weaknesses" for many years, 
focusing on more gas-saving, practical vehicles.  A few years ago I began 
to notice, however, the wonderful things Asian boys were doing to their 
Hondas.  One could achieve some compromise here.  Then, one fateful 
evening, Jim, a veritable bellwether of pop culture, came for his regular 
Monday evening dinner with us.   After dinner, we are "forced" to watch 
makeover shows, reality TV and such.  I rarely watch TV these days, but one 
show that came on after some crazy  bi dudes in the nude fighting with 
snakes or something caught my interest:  "Pimp My Ride."  There are many 
other shows that document auto personalization, I discovered, but this was 
the first I watched.  On this particular episode they took a truly wack 
1985 Datsun station wagon owned by a DJ and transformed it into a most 
amazing vehicle, complete with turntables, amps, DAT recorder and many 
other visually artistic enhancements.

I began research to pimp my Toyota Matrix XRS that very night.  Good car 
with which to work.  She already has a Celica GT engine, and TRD (Toyota 
Racing Development) has made a number of aftermarket enhancements 
available, including suspensions, turbochargers, cold air intakes and tuned 
exhausts.  Further, others make all manner of fun things that can be added 
to the body and interior.

Started with the wheels, and went for advice to a shop managed by those 
experienced in this area.  I decided on G games light weight racing 
wheels:  the 2-piece Falcons http://www.i-m-racing.com/ggamesbyrays.html. 
Very nice.  Tires are Bridgestone high performance Potenza S03 pole 
position.  The back wheels are slighting bigger than the front.

Inside I replaced the dash and other facings with some high tech looking 
stuff, had some aluminum cut for the floors, put racing pedals on the 
clutch, break and throttle, and a few TRD enhancements.

Next the sound system.  This is where MP3 players come in.  I wanted a 
device that could play MP3 CDs that I burned on the computer and interfaced 
with my I Pod, so I selected the Blaupunkt Seattle as a receiver.  I also 
installed an Alpine MRP-M350 amp under the seat and put a JL Audio 10" 
subwoofer in the cargo area.  Sweet.  There is apparently a whole 
subculture devoted to JL Audio products.  The subwoofer is enclosed and I 
can easily remove it if I wish to free up hauling space.

I see this as a work in progress.  What next?:)  I'm also feeling guilty as 
hell about all this at times.  Catholic guilt.  One side of me positions 
this pimping as artistic expression;  the practical, thrifty side of my 
soul, however, sees this as pure, silly self-indulgence.

All in all, though, I'm having much fun pimping my ride.

Love,

Apollo

Obviously, the environment in which people live affects their tastes a
lot. Techno originated in the abandoned warehouses of post-industrial
Detroit. And let's not forget the Swedes: there's nothing like days
without sunshine and constant sub-zero temperatures to bring out some of
the most aggressive music on the planet. I discovered IDM ("techno", I
suppose) when I was living in Nebraska, of all places. 

Heh, now that I think of it, maybe that's one of the reasons why techno
isn't so popular out here in the Bay Area. It's temperate and
comfortable, diverse in ethnicity, and lush in plant and wildlife.
Living is relatively easy out here if you can afford it, and it's hard
to be bored when there's so much art and culture within a stone's throw
of wherever you are. When I think of the people I know that grew up
here, I can't imagine any of them being angry, spiteful kids.

Not that you have to be angry or spiteful to appreciated it (I'm sure
not), but like punk, goth and industrial, I think techno appeals to
people that are more inclined to express and explore their dark side.
"Live evil", so they say.

Cheerio,

Heh yeah, I was talking more about the public at large. I'm 23, so it's
probably unfair for me to be making blanket statements about how people
viewed music in the late 80's. But that's what I've gathered from my
reading, and from my own experience. At least, by the time I was into
electronic music ('93), everything was being referred to collectively as
"techno".

We ravers are a bit more meticulous in our classification, but my point
is that even in our community there's a debate over what really
qualifies as techno. What I should have said in the the previous email
was that maybe it's not so wrong to label everything as "techno",
because it seems to me that historically, techno has had a more
long-lasting influence on other styles than they've had on it. House and
trance are getting "techier". Breaks and hip-hop are increasingly
"glitchy". Rock bands are using analog drum machines and synthesizers
again. For crying out loud, Two Lone Swordsmen did an instrumental
version of Ricardo Villalobos' "Dexter" for his "Alcachofa Remixes" EP.

I'm not saying that what's traditionally referred to as "techno" (i.e.,
the harder drum trax) will usurp all the other styles of EDM. But I do
think that soon, people will have to stop thinking of techno as the ugly
duckling of electronic music. Because at some point, it may become
difficult to distinguish your favorite styles from some of the "techno"
that's being produced today. Does that make any sense? :)

i think they remixed a couple of tracks, like the boozoo bajou
one...they have one original song on there as well.  mixing is
bad, but some of the tracks are amazing, like the "slow hot
wind" one.

Love this Jon Carroll that appeared in the SF Chronicle this morning:

<http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2004/08/06/DDGIJ7OAF91.DTL>JON 
CARROLL
- <mailto:jcarroll@sfchronicle.com>Jon Carroll
Friday, August 6, 2004

Sometimes, when my tiny head is spinning with disinfotainment and other 
artifacts of the mediasphere, I try to think what archaeologists and social 
historians 2,000 years from now might make of our particular little epoch. 
How, for instance, would they parse the word "drug"?

Is a "drug dealer" a pharmacist or a petty criminal? When we talk about 
"reasonably priced drugs for seniors," are we discussing marijuana or 
Lipitor? What would they make of the fact that the last four 
administrations have declared a "war on drugs" while taking money from drug 
companies?

Why is it bad when residents of Colombia build mansions from profits on the 
sale of drugs, but it's good when residents of Newport, R.I., do the same 
thing?

When one person cannot live without "lifesaving drugs," we express great 
sympathy, unless that person is a "drug addict," in which case we may even 
throw him in jail. When a mood-altering drug is sold in pill form in 
stores, it's called an antidepressant and hailed as a medical breakthrough. 
When a mood-altering drug is sold on the streets, it's called felony drug 
trafficking and subject to stiff criminal penalties.

Because we are native speakers of American, we can wend our way through the 
contradictions. We know that the bad drugs are the ones the cause euphoria 
and impair judgment, unless the drug is alcohol, but that's not ever called 
a drug, so there's no confusion there. We know that the good drugs are the 
ones that cure diseases or relieve symptoms, except sometimes the good 
drugs are ineffective or even counterproductive in achieving those goals. 
Street dealers do not finance experimental trials on the effectiveness of 
the drugs they sell. Drug companies do, but they fudge the results. Street 
dealers have a small feedback loop because customers can tell pretty 
quickly whether they're loaded or not. Drug companies have a long feedback 
loop because human beings can't instantly tell whether their cholesterol is 
being lowered or their blood thinned or their insulin production stimulated.

A drug with a long feedback loop is clearly more profitable than one with a 
short feedback loop because the dealer can keep an ineffective drug on the 
shelves much longer. Interestingly, the people who sell ineffective drugs 
are generally said to have made "honest mistakes."

If a street dealer sold you an ineffective drug, you could take five of 
your friends and go back and have a brisk conversation with him. If a 
behind- the-counter dealer sold you an ineffective drug, you'd have to hire 
a lawyer and file a lawsuit and maybe, maybe, 10 years later you'd get some 
money, although probably you'd be dead by then.

Street dealers don't have patents on their drugs, which means that they'll 
always have plenty of competition. Drug companies do have patents, so they 
can set their prices without worrying about market economics. And when 
their patents run out, they can put out a drug with a slightly different 
formulation, promote it like mad and sell the new drug in a monopolistic 
setting.

You have to wonder when street dealers are going to come up with Cocaine XR 
or LSD Reditabs.

Since the street dealer works in a competitive atmosphere, he has to keep 
his prices relatively low. In order to increase his profitability, he can 
"step on" his product, that is, dilute it. It would be unwise for a drug 
company to adulterate its product, but since it owns a monopoly, it can set 
prices artificially high and achieve the same profitability levels.

A street dealer who knowingly poisons his clientele is called "the scum of 
the earth." A drug corporation that knowingly poisons its clientele is 
called "a tobacco company."

People who sell illegal drugs often rot in jail for 20 or 30 years. People 
who sell legal drugs are often forced to attend tedious daylong board 
meetings. People who take illegal drugs are called "losers." People who 
take legal drugs are called "everyone in America."

Glad I'm not an archaeologist in 4040; my brain would ache a whole lot.

no really, it's true though. I used to live in the Upper Haight,
walking distance to Braindrops, but you couldn't walk to Braindrops

Subject: [sfraves] Rick James Bio, Etc.

--=====================_16826435==.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

Rick James (February 1, 1948 - August 6, 2004) was a U.S. funk and
soul recording and performing artist. He was born James Johnson, Jr.

He was most prolific during the late 1970's and early 1980's. He was
a singer, keyboardist, bassist, producer, arranger, and composer. He
performed mostly with his back-up band, the Stone City Band.

James' breakthrough single was "You And I", an eight-minute magnum
opus from his debut album Come Get It. But the song he is most
famous for is his 1981 hit "Superfreak" (from his 1981 concept album
Street Songs), which served as the basis for MC Hammer's 1991 Grammy
award-winning song "U Can't Touch This." His other hits
include "Give it to Me Baby," "Cold Blooded," and "17." He recorded
primarily for Gordy and Motown Records.

But it was the dark side of James' life that overpowered his music.
He was an occasional drug addict, addicted mostly to cocaine. In
1993, James was convicted of assulting two women (one of the assults
was during one of his cocaine binges). Serving two years in Folsom
Prison did not stop him from writing new songs, even if he did it
behind bars. James was released in 1995.

James attempted a comeback with a new album and tour in 1997, but
suffered a mild stroke during a concert in Denver, effectively
ending his musical career.

Before his stroke, James was interviewed for the VH1 series Behind
The Music, and for the first time spoke openly about his life and
his battle with drugs.

Ironically, a Behind the Music-style skit on the sketch comedy show
Chappelle's Show looked back on interactions between Charlie Murphy
and James in the 1980s. The skit depicted Rick James as an
egotistical, misogynistic cocaine addict who constantly reminded
people "I'm Rick James, bitch!" which has become something of a
catch phrase. The skit starred Dave Chappelle as James and Charlie
Murphy playing himself, with interspersed interview segments with
James.

Rick James was found dead on August 6, 2004 in his home by his
caretaker. James died presumedly of natural causes. He leaves behind
three children, Tazman, Ty, and Rick James, Jr.

Scheduled for release in September/October 2004 is the DVD Rick
James: Rockpalast Live, which features a 1982 concert performance
from Essen, Germany.

Actually this matter bounced around a little bit on
the 313 list. They were from Detroit. They all went to
school in Belleville for a few years. It wasn't until
they moved back to Detroit that they started to
produce tracks.

Regardless, I was speaking generally... not of where the actual tracks
were produced, but where they were *experienced* originally and gained
popularity with nerdy white boys. :)

FWIW, here are some quotes from the book "Modulations" that might be of
some interest:

"Detroit's an industrial city. It's a wasteland of ideas. Detroit is the
type of place where you can only dream of what the rest of the world is
like."
-- Derrick May

"It's all called techno or dance music now, 'cause it's all electronic
music created with technological equipment. Maybe that should be the
only name, 'dance music', because everybody has a different vision of
what techno is now."

Pretty much sums up my position these days.  Dance music is what we started 
with back in the seventies, and that seems to be the essence of what we do 
-- now with technology rather than expensive studios.

Some of the genre/subgenre charts folks produce these days look like the 
work of librarians:)  Does it move your ass and soul?  That's all that 
really matters.

"I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes 
me to tremble for the safety of my country.  As a result of the war, 
corporations have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places 
will follow, and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong 
its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth is 
aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed."
-Abraham Lincoln

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

  "I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of 
life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the 
beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club, 
party or other sound system that has ever achieved anything close to that..."
-Jeno, on the early days of Wicked and the Full Moon Raves

Dear all,

This is probably something most of you already know, but for those who =
dont, please read on:

I attended Astral Projections at Space 550 - Barneveld last Saturday - =
July 31st and like a complete idiot took my Mercedes Benz and parked it =
right outside Barneveld before
going in.=20

Later, I believe I was drugged, something put in my drink while I was
dancing - because I fell to the ground onto my knees, and couldn't even =
stand up
straight; I practically had to crawl to my car. That night I had a total =
of 2.5 double gins with redbull through a period of a few hours - not =
enough alcohol to make me crumble like a rag doll; my car keys were =
missing from my pocket, and I later found that my registration docs. had =
been taken from my car.

I told the lady who helped me into my cab that I thought my keys had =
been stolen and also the cab driver, and by some wonderful stroke of =
luck - probably because my car was parked directly in front of =
Barneveld, and maybe because they might have told the bouncers up front, =
that my car was still there the next morning.=20

Space 550 has not returned a single one of my phone calls, Thump Radio =
suggested I call Space 550 and Astral Projections people were not to be =
heard from. So much for the peace and love feeling.

A complete police report has been filed on this incident. Trance dancing =
is
something that is supposed to let you be free and be yourself, I think =
there
are people who are trying to take advantage of us while we are doing our
thing and trusting everyone around us.=20

I hope this doesn't happen to others elsewhere, and I'm hoping this is =
just something related to Barneveld, which very well could be, given =
it's Bayview address... I actually didn't know Space 550 was in a "bad" =
neighbourhood; I do now and I'm not going back.

Please be careful and look out for each other when you're having fun, =
there are seriously evil people lurking in the shadows. Part of my =
problem was that I went alone, dont make the same mistakes I did.

So you think that someone drugged you so that they could steal the
registration for your car?

Oh yeah, I hope you didn't have your house keys on the key ring because now
that they have your registration they also know where you live.

American admits to hoax execution video
Sat August 07, 2004 12:13 PM ET

By Adam Tanner and Barbara Grady

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A tech-savvy young San Francisco man who staged 
his own mock beheading on the Internet duped international media today into 
believing Islamist kidnappers had executed an American hostage in Iraq.

The video, which appeared on a Web site used by Islamic militants, showed a 
man who identified himself as Benjamin Vanderford appealing to the United 
States to leave Iraq. The Web format was that used by al Qaeda ally Abu 
Musab al-Zarqawi and was introduced by a headline that said it showed 
Zarqawi killing an American.

"If we don't (leave Iraq), everyone is gonna be killed in this way ... I 
have been offered for exchange for prisoners here in Iraq," the 
terrified-looking man said, rocking back and forth in his chair, his hands 
tied behind his back.

The video showed a hand with a large knife apparently slicing through the 
neck of a limp body.

But it was all a hoax.

The blood was dye, the setting was a friend's garage, the Koran reading was 
a tape and the knife was held by a friend. Mutilated bodies and sound 
effects were edited in from photos on Web sites and the video was 
purposefully blurred to make it seem even more amateur, Vanderford said.

A major motivation for his action, an unrepentant Vanderford told Reuters, 
was to see how the world media would react and to see if they would be 
fooled. "It really illustrates the potential that this kind of thing would 
happen," he said.

Vanderford, 22, said he worked at branch of Wells Fargo bank. A college 
drop-out, he was a candidate for the local city council earlier this year 
but had since dropped out of the race. His Web site also says he is a video 
game programmer and works with a local record label.

INTERNET EXPERIMENT

He said the video parody of actual beheadings of hostages in Iraq posted on 
Islamist Web sites was made and posted on the Web about three months ago, 
intended as an experiment into how quickly videos spread on the Internet. 
He was surprised at how long it took.

"It is unfortunate that it had to be the type of video that was offensive 
and shocking, but it was necessary to see how quickly this kind of thing 
would spread," he said.

Local police and FBI officials arrived at his door early on Saturday, but 
had no immediate comment as to whether he would face criminal charges. A 
police official said it was a matter for the city's special investigations 
unit.

Vanderford said he distributed the staged video on Kazaa and other Internet 
peer-to-peer networks which are popular swapping forums for films, music 
and software. He said if his staged death appeared on any terror-related 
Web sites it was the work of others who found the video on the peer-to-peer 
networks.

Scores of hostages from two dozen countries have been seized in the last 
four months. Most have been freed but at least 10 have been killed, and at 
least 20 are still being held in Iraq.

Vanderford expressed the hope that his stunt would not affect his bank job.

obviously, God was punishing you for buying a Mercedes in the first place.

did you know that the company was originally founded by the Nazi
Party, and in the Holocaust they used slave labor and ganked gold
teeth out of the mouths of living human beings?

in the late 90s they were ordered by a German judge to pay a bunch of
Holocaust survivors back for this shit. the judge told them they had
to pay slightly less then $700 per slave. seven hundred dollars for a
human life. and the tooth-ganking was not even considered a
reparation-worthy crime. feed that to the accounting department at a
hyper-efficient German corporation and find out whether they consider
it a mistake.

oh yeah, and:

Astral Projection are from Israel.

YOU ASSHOLE.

however I don't actually think God was punishing you for buying a
Mercedes. I think you got drunk and you lost your keys like some kind
of dumb motherfucker.

why would somebody go to all the trouble of drugging you and stealing
your registration documents but not bother to steal the actual
physical car? what are they, the clubland paperwork gremlins?

anyway, if you can't handle bad neighborhoods, or Red Bull, I'd advise
giving up on this type of music completely. because if the clubland
paperwork gremlins are out to get you, the warehouse acid gremlins
will eat your skull.

and don't even get me started on the mushroom gnomes.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Drugged and Keys missing at Space 550, Barneveld - Astral Projections

	Wow, sorry to hear that. Glad your car was still there. I wonder why 
they would break in and steal your registration papers? Perhaps to go 
with some other vehicle that they stole previously?

	I've sometimes wondered how expensive tracking devices are. If you 
have a pricey car like a Mercedes, maybe it would be worth investing in 
something like that to leave in a hidden place in or on the vehicle, 
just in case it does disappear some day? Wouldn't it be fun to round up 
a posse and go surprise the shit out of the thieves a day or two later 
after they thought they'd clean got away?  8)

	A cheaper alternative might be to keep a long-range walkie talkie or 
something turned on in the car when you leave it parked in a dangerous 
area, and carry another one on you. Then as soon as you spotted it 
missing, you'd call up and say something like, "All right motherfucker, 
you better stop and pull over right now and get the fuck away from the 
vehicle in a big hurry, or your ass is going to jail. You stole an 
undercover cop car with a tracking device on it, and in a few minutes 
we are going to be all over you like jam on toast." Of course even if 
they heard you and it freaked them into taking off, it might only buy 
you a bit of time until they checked back later and realized the car 
was still sitting where they left it.

Groove on,

Subject: [sfraves] ?? anything.tonight ?? (no Opel, no NRG party)

Beyond that is there anything going on tonight that's worth checking
out? I thought about the 80's tennis party but I don't have the time
nor energy to deal with dressing up like that. I already was part of
an 80's party earlier this year so I'm not quite ready for another
dose yet. Opel is playing too much trance for my pants and there's
some NRG party in the eastbay with a "1000+ person capacity"
(wtf+where??) that's not really my speed right now. Jeebuz. The one
night I really want to go out and there isn't really shit to do. Not
really feeling any of the club nights that are happening tonight. I
think I'm screwed.

It's been a rough day. I need some release (not 1015 kind hahaha).
Bueller?? I'm almost tempted to just have a party at the house here
again since I still have sound curtains (I'll bring them back asap
Michael).

Starchild, that's exactly what the Police Officer on the phone said - they
could use the registration to show for some other stolen Merc. car. That is
why I was advised to go in and file a formal report at the Bayview Police
Stn.

You have some cute ideas for foiling these fellas plans - but I think from
now I shall simply refrain from taking my car, or going at all - will have
to be more selective.

The Bayview Police said that I should avoid that entire neighbourhood
altogether and that there is always bad stuff happening at Barneveld. So I
shall listen to them. Simple.

You all make your own choices, I'm just informing you of what I've learnt,
kind of wish someone else had informed me...

Thanks for your friendly thoughts,

Vidur

DJ Soundwave,

Thanks for your very erudite piece of lit. lets not waste people's time: I
will stick to the facts, rather than have them get side tracked by some
history toting, rapper DJ with glib sound bites to wow his audience:

The police have informed me that there is always bad stuff happening at
Space 550 because of the neighbourhood, and another friend just told me that
women (usually) out there have been known to get raped with Rohypnol in the
bathroom. Ya yaay! Just your kind of place DJ Rapper Soundwave.

And that about sounds right, Rohypnol or something - 'cos my knees just gave
way, and I fell to the ground, and I totally lost track of time and just
knew I had to get the hell out of there asap.. so I somehow crawled and
scuttled across the road to my car. Thank God I was parked real close.

My initial email was simply a heads up to all who go out and expect they are
surrounded by well meaning people. Aint true. So sad, in this holy land of
breaks and liberal thinking, the Taliban have arrived here to terrorize us,
dressed as Mercedes haters... yes? Car jackers? Or just plain jealous
pusses? You decide for your own self, 'cos you may be next.

Vidur I obviously don't know the truth of your
situation, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt.
 WIth that said, its not news that there are some
fuckers and dangerous people in both the rave and club
scenes.  Whether at 550 or elsewhere you can't assume
its OK.  Sorry folks.  Of course some places are safer
than others and this changes over time.  I'm not going
say anything about specific venues or promoters but
you can often tell which kind of party you're at if
you pay attention.  Look people in the eye and see.

But I'm not suggesting that any of you get negative
out there.  Keep going out and dancing.  Just take
care of yourselves, develop safe habits, and don't
take any chances.  If  you make this a standard
practice you won't need to worry about this sort of
shit at all.  Vidur I'm not trying to attack or
criticize you; just want to offer some advice to those
who might need to hear it.  

Please people, just don't leave your drinks unattended
at a club or rave.  Its not smart.  If you get in the
habit of keeping your drink with you (whether it be
H2O or alcoholic) you'll really never need to worry
about being slipped anything. 

And don't get so wasted that you can't pay attention
to what's happening around you.  If have one too many
drinks you might not notice when someone slips you
one.

And there are other dangers lurking out there besides
getting drugged and robbed...

Be careful!

Peter
(feeling like the old fart Dad that I am)

Subject: RE: [sfraves] "techno"

Huh?

Man...  no wonder people have such trouble with my music here in the
states...   they don't even know the history of their own music (house +
techno).

How can anybody say that techno has had a more lasting influence on EDM
than house?  Now don't get me wrong... I've always loved techno and its
only in the last two years or so that I've been able to truly appreciate
house (maybe because I'm getting so old) ... but techno has always been
the bastard step child of house.  Techno is by definition inhuman, cold,
elitist and arrogant.  These very traits that make techno "techno" are a
big turn-off for the majority of potential EDM listeners.

"techno" as we call it started in 1983.  Its often said that the early
electro works by juan atkins (like "clear") were the first proper
"techno" tunes.  Ever hear these?  About the only thing they have in
common with house music is that they were pressed on vinyl.  Clearly
house music has had more influence on techno than vice versa.  Techno
was so frowned upon here that the artists (who were absolutely brilliant
producers no matter how strange one thought their music to be) basically
had to go to berlin to find an audience for their music (tresor, etc.)

And I don't understand what you are saying about house and trance
getting techier?  If I listen to an old trax record...  it sounds far
more "techy" to me than any "techno" record ever has.  That's just my
personal opinion and we all hear what we want to hear.  One thing tho
that really isn't debatable is the fact that the "techy" ness of the
original house music is one of the things announced its split from the
disco scene.  In fact if you go back and listen to some trax from the
late 80s... strings of life by Rhythim Is Rhythim (which was a ripoff of
an old beetles tune) is FAR LESS "techy" than a house record released at
the same time, like say "box energy" by DJ Pierre.  And if you wanna
hear some really fuckd up shit, go check out "Hot Hands" by hula which
was also released on Trax.  Its in no uncertain terms the blueprint for
every "acid techno" record ever made... its HOUSE.  Seriously I'm not
trying to get all oldskool on your buttocks here or anything, but go
peep some old trax records and some old transmat records and you'll
clearly see what I'm talking about... house music in the 80s was techier
than techno.  Sure at the same time you had steve hurley and david
morales pumping out the garage anthems on a daily basis... but house
music also had DJ Pierre and the other cats doing their thing. =20

And now to what made me wanna reply to this message...  how on earth can
you say that trance is getting techier?    No matter how "techy" trance
gets it will never, ever, ever come even close to being as "techy" as it
started out.  Trance began in 1989 in communist east germany.  It was an
experiment (obviously gone awry) to inject some much needed emotion into
the mindless crap being played by the Detroit folks in berlin (at places
like tresor).  In fact, even though trance proper was born in 89, it
wasn't until MFS started using the word trance that people even picked
up on it.  In fact the first TRANCE record ever was "House in the
desert" by alien nation (orgon records, 1988).  It was produced by Mark
Reeder who founded MFS records the following year.  Go find it and
listen to it... its techno with a minimal melody.. a melody clearly
inspired by the house music coming out of Chicago and London.  In 1990
MFS picked up some more "techno" artists like Mijk van Dijk, Humate,
etc.  Go back and listen to their early works... a blueprint for modern
day techno.  The success of MFS and their instant takeover of the
European dance music market spawned a number of cloned trance labels.
Some of these may be familiar to you:  Harthouse, Superstition,
Overdrive, etc.  Its funny... in 1991 these were all "trance" labels...
yet today they are recognized as being "techno" labels.  "trance" in the
early years was just techno with an influence from acid house.  It
wasn't the other way around.  Trance over the years has morphed into
something completely evil and out of touch with its roots. I guess
popularity can do that.  But in the beginning, it was techno.  It was
made by techno artists and enjoyed by the techno fans.  No matter how
"techy" trance gets in the future, it will never ever be "techno"
again... for it will be trance.  In fact, not only is trance not getting
techier... its completely lost its techno roots altogether and will
never get that influence back no matter how hard anybody tries.  Trance
is over 15 years old now.  Its too late to turn back... its too late to
become techno again. =20

"For crying out loud, Two Lone Swordsmen did an instrumental version of
Ricardo Villalobos' "Dexter" for his "Alcachofa Remixes" EP"

Did I miss something?  What the heck does this have to do with anything?
Andrew Weatherall was at first and still is a techno artist.  The same
goes for Ricardo.  What does one techno artist remixing another techno
artist have to do with anything?  How does that prove any influence of
one style over another?

And if you are saying that in the future all music will sound "techy"
then EDM is doomed.  If anything EDM needs to be made more human.  It is
the "techyness" that has turned people off of EDM over the last few
years.  It is the "techyness" that has caused techno label after techno
label to completely disappear over the last two years.  It is the
"techyness" that has brought down every major European distributor in
the last two years.  People are sick of "techno".  Its elitist, arrogant
and in most cases dreadfully boring.  People simply aren't interested in
the zapping sounds of a swarm of robotic hornets.  And the record sales
prove this.    Sure techno will live on, but if people keep insisting
upon techno being "techy" it will return to its roots... 300 kids in
Detroit and another 300 kids in berlin and no fans anywhere else on the
planet.  Is that what you want for techno?  I surely hope not.  I hope
techno is kept alive by people like chris Jackson and andy w... who
aren't exactly techno snobs.  Shit when any plays a 'techno' set
sometimes...  I have to wait an hour just to hear a 'techno' track.
That willingness to 'break the rules' is what will keep techno alive...
because clearly following the elitist techno rules has nearly killed
techno.

Keep it Wet & Hard...

quoth DJ Pat:

Oh brother... Pat, this wasn't intended to be a debate about the origins
of house or techno. All I'm saying is that *technically* (e.g., with
respect to basic structure and instrumentation), a lot more music is
sounding like techno these days. I'm saying this from experience: I got
into what's commonly referred to as "techno" via house, and eventually
came to realize that a lot of what I thought of as "house" was actually
more like techno than anything else. You probably don't agree with me
because you're not familiar with the type of music I'm talking about.

But like any Gemini, I guess I can see both sides of the issue: the fact
that I even refer to most of this fringe music as "techno" points to the
possibility that techno is really just informed by everything else--not
that everything else is informed by techno. But for now it sounds to me
like modern house (specifically the past 5-6 years' worth) is taking a
lot of cues from techno.

I think George was more correct in saying that techno and house are
parallel branches of the same tree. About all techno and house have in
common is the 4-on-the-floor beat, and if you think of electro as simply
a style of techno (as I do), then the only common factor (pun intended)
is the instrumentation: most notably, the traditional use of the TR-606
and TB-303.

You really don't know techno if that's what you think. The whole *point*
of this thread was to point out that there was more to techno than
mechanical drum trax. Regardless of which styles influence which, I
would still assert that the techno of today is much more accessible than
people probably think. It's certainly not all "inhuman, cold, elitist
and arrogant".

That's a very good point. But you're contradicting yourself: because
nobody embraced it stateside (unless you count Richie Hawtin), techno
had the opportunity to evolve outside the sphere of house music's
influence in places like Berlin.  German producers list among their
influences people like Carl Craig and Derrick May, who originally
developed their sounds as an *alternative* to house.

> ...

All good points, but nothing that really speaks to the more recent
evolution of techno. It's all semantics though, which is probably why I
never should have started this thread in the first place. Suffice it to
say that my definition of "techno" is a lot more liberal than yours. :)

Point taken. Admittedly, I don't hear much trance these days, but what I
have heard has tended to sound increasingly more like EBM and hard
techno than what I was introduced to as "trance" 5 or 6 years ago.

Heh, you haven't heard the new TLS album, have you? I was referring to
the influence of techno on rock--Weatherall and Tenniswood's remake of
"Dexter" is a live instrumentation (i.e. guitars and live drums) of a
minimal techno track. There have been a lot of remakes done in the other
direction, but labels like DFA are truly revolutionizing the
much-maligned "rock" genre by injecting it with electronics. The whole
"electroclash" style is, essentially, punk rock with techno
sensibilities. You would probably say they're just techno geeks getting
bored and deciding to make rock music, but I think it's actually the
other way around. The young people making this music didn't grow up
listening to Jimi Hendrix, they grew up with Kraftwerk and Depeche Mode.

One word: Kompakt.

Heh, I'm not either. That's why I like the really lush, emotive Detroit
techno. That's why I appreciate the warm production styles of Eric
Estornel, Bernhard Pucher, L'usine, and Claro Intelecto. I could go on
and on here... but trust me, there's much more to modern techno than
incessant zapping.

No, and that's why I'm trying to open people's eyes to the other side of
techno: the complex, emotional, thought-provoking side.

And that's my point: there's a lot of techno out there breaking the
rules. At some point, a small group of elitists decided that the only
style that qualified as "techno" was hard, banging stuff. I'm here to
tell you that it's not all like that. The techno community is growing
because people have opened their minds to new definitions of the word.

I'm not sure I know what people mean by "techy," which is one reason I 
stayed clear of this discussion so far.  As you correctly observed, EDM 
arose when producers began to use technology to create dance music, rather 
than live musicians and vocalists in expensive studios.  Disco died, money 
for old production techniques disappeared, and innovative producers morphed 
expensively produced disco into electronic house music. All EDM, therefore, 
is "techy."  I think what folks mean by techy in this context is more 
qualitative than quantitative.

But you hit the beat on the box when you wrote "...EDM needs to be made 
more human."  Qualitative statement, but it on this level of emotion, 
passion and sensuality that I would like to comment here.  I believe we 
need to bring back the soul, sensuality, sex and funk to dance music.

Over the past few years  I have become increasing disenchanted with much of 
the dance music I've been buying, spinning and hearing out at parties and 
clubs.  Seemed to me --  and I feel like I'm dancing on hot coals here 
because this may appear deeply offensive to some -- that lots of this music 
arose from an engineer's soul rather than a musician's.  Others have made 
this observation.  When EDM was evolving the musician (DJ/producer) worked 
with an technical staff that knew the hardware and, eventually, software 
mandatories and helped actualize the musicians intentions.  The musician 
made most of the bucks and technical staff were on salary.  Many musicians 
were unwilling or  unable to master these new "instruments," and tech staff 
felt they might make more money eliminating the musician altogether.  So 
the rise of producer/technicians who often had little or no musical 
training and exposure to the long historical evolution of EDM and the 
influences that created it.  To be frank, many also lacked soul:)  So you 
have machines and people who know how to use them and they all start making 
music that sounds pretty much the same over time.  Lyrics disappear (who 
can write lyrics and record them? even worse, who can actually write a 
song?).  Lots of product, but very little with the "hook" that could get 
people dancing years ago.  This theory is, of course, an oversimplification 
but...

One started to go to parties where few danced.  There were wonderful 
displays of technical virtuosity behind the decks, laptops, and such but it 
began to feel to me more like an esoteric chamber music concert than a 
dance party.

Over the past few months I decided to try to divest myself of all the 
genre/subgenre stuff, go back and review the music of the past thirty 
years, and feel again just what made dancers really dance.

Segue to 1990 San Francisco dancefloors.  No need to go back to the 
seventies.  There were many tracks that made asses move.  One was "The 
Power" by Snap.  Big worldwide hip house crossover hit that rivaled "Pump 
Up the Jam" at the time.  Some German producers took a rather obscure rap 
track "Let the Words Flow" by Chill Rob G, rewrote and diluted the 
Afrocentric lyrics, got Turbo G and singer Penny Ford to execute the thing, 
and there was a song that EVERYONE danced to -- music snobs, hipsters, the 
uninitiated, house lovers -- they all waved their hands in the air, 
shouted, and danced madly to this "commercial" hit.  As a DJ one would 
sample slices of "The Power" throughout one's set letting the dancers know 
it was coming.  Very seductive foreplay.  Tease.  They all wanted it.  When 
you finally let it rip there was truly a collective orgasm on the 
dancefloor.  The you often followed it with "Gonna Make You 
Sweat"  (another hip house hit) and everyone sang along with the opening 
lyrics:  "Everybody dance now."  And they danced.  And they sweated.  How 
often do you see that happen today?  LOL, I was going to throw "The Power" 
into my next public set, but Doc Martin beat me to it last time he played 
at Club 6.  Never thought I'd hear that song on the dancefloor again.  And, 
by the gods, it had the same effect that it did fourteen years ago. There 
were many songs like this then;  "The Power" has just been on my mind lately.

Chill Rob G's original lyrics (much better than the vague commercial 
release) eloquently sum up what I think I'm trying to say here:  "It's wack 
to me when the beat is more hype than the MC cause what he's sayin is 
empty, dull, void, without substance or content.  You need to slow your 
speed, stop the nonsense..."

And that is happening from my perspective -- and I know we all hear what we 
want to hear.  What I see people dancing to these days is not more "techy" 
stuff.  Rather, they are lovin' the old funky, soulful stuff with content 
-- even disco -- and perceptive DJs and producers are bringing this human 
element back to the dancefloor.  Interesting that Juan Atkins last time he 
was in town opened his set with that most excellent recent remix of the 
disco classic "I Feel Love."  The kids can't seem to get enough of Jesse 
Saunders' old house classics.  Africa Bambaataa enflames the dancefloor 
with disco-infused hip hop.  One of the most successful parties in town 
brings back the music of the early nineties.  Hell, I've collected five 
excellent recent remixes of "Le Freak" and other old dancefloor 
classics.  Bring back the funk, yes.  Don't know what it is?  Listen to 
Sylvester's "Do You Wanna' Funk.":)  Bring back content, songs, lyrics, sex 
and soul.  Whatever one might think about commercial hip hop, it's so 
successful because it does just that.

Love,

Apollo

"I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes 
me to tremble for the safety of my country.  As a result of the war, 
corporations have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places 
will follow, and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong 
its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth is 
aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed."
-Abraham Lincoln

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

  "I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of 
life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the 
beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club, 
party or other sound system that has ever achieved anything close to that..."
-Jeno, on the early days of Wicked and the Full Moon Raves

"I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes 
me to tremble for the safety of my country.  As a result of the war, 
corporations have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places 
will follow, and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong 
its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth is 
aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed."
-Abraham Lincoln

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

  "I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of 
life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the 
beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club, 
party or other sound system that has ever achieved anything close to that..."
-Jeno, on the early days of Wicked and the Full Moon Raves

:)  speaking of C&C Music Factory "Gonna Make You Sweat," I've got  this 
great parody record from the time where instead of saying "Everybody dance  now!" 
they say "Everybody fuck now!".  It' s fun to mix it in with the  regular song 
and surprise people.  
it's by "Sissy Penis Factory"  lol

That's quite noble, Apollo. It's difficult to market oneself as a DJ
without defining what you play. That's why I'm having such a hard time
with this techno thing... Rather than categorize everything, I should
probably just let the music speak for itself.

So I'll remind you all again, but if you want to hear what I'm talking
about, tune in to my weekly internet broadcast from 6-8pm tonight. House
heads should enjoy it. Fans of dub, electro and breaks should too. Even
elitist techno snobs might hear something they like.

<http://www.throwdown.com/throwdown/live/live.asp>

We could debate the merits of certain styles of electonic music until
we're blue in the face, but in the end it's all about making people
move. Not necessarily dancing--I know quite a few people that just don't
dance--but getting into the music *somehow*; if not physically, then
cerebrally.

I got into electronic music not because I needed to dance, but because I
needed to hear something different. I needed to find something that
could either support or influence my moods, without literal lyrics or
catchy hooks; something abstract that would allow me to reach my own
conclusions. And I eventually discovered, in the San Francisco rave
scene, that the styles tailored for either mental or more physical
consumption aren't necessarily mutually exclusive. There is such a thing
as "intelligent" dance music.

I'm in the hole tens of thousands of dollars for having bought thousands
of records and never getting paid more than cab fare for a gig. But I
started collecting records and DJing so that I could find new,
interesting music and share it with people that wouldn't hear it
otherwise--and in that respect, I've been somewhat successful. All I ask
in return is that you support your local DJs by challenging your tastes
every once in a a while. Discovering new music is a thrilling
experience, and there's too much of it out there (and in the Bay Area
alone!) to limit yourself to any specific style or structure. I've tried
in vain to convey the idea that "techno" isn't always cold and inhuman,
but the only way to find out for yourself is to listen. :)

Cheers,

Subject: [sfraves] and even more techno...

finally got my new mix up:

http://anon.scosol.speedera.net/anon.scosol/redstickman_dissection_techno_2004.mp3

old school hard banging techno.  34 tracks (for some reason i
thought it was 35), 3 decks, 1 CD.  a couple of unknown
individuals co-remixed the last song (ministry rmx).

thanks to scott solmonson for hosting and konkers for
remastering (twice!)

let me know what you think.  burn it and listen to it at home -
it's kind of bass-heavy, and does not go well with computer
speakers.  :)

So, I'm forgetting who I've talked to in the recent past who've told me
they're without a day job these days.  If you're one of them, let me
know.  (Maybe we can hook up radio time more easily that way.)

Thanks.

Subject: [sfraves] brains nrr

hello, this is a continuation of a fictional piece:

"hey, ig, i read recently that the brain leans on
certain functions heavier at different times of life
than others. what do you think of that? i believe
somewhat in developmental psychology, but not to the
extent that i feel we are so able to define chemistry
and function in such a strict way. brains are brains,
essentially is my point."
"huh?"
"nevermind." :)

not to mention he also produced the fabulous Mary Jane Girls, who were his 
back up singers. They came out with old school such hits as "Cadyman" "Ring My 
Bell" "In My House" and "All Night Long" (gonna give it to ya give it to ya 
give it to ya baby)    Listen to stations like 98.1 and 101.1 and 100.3 they play 
Mary Jane Girls more than they play Rick James. You can always hear the 
signature Rick James funk riffs behind their singing though. He's the man. Way way 
way funkier than James Brown if you ask me. Right up there with Parlement.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Rick James Bio, Etc.

James Brown came way before both Parliament and Rick James.  it's not fair
to compare their relative funk-a-tude.  i'm not disagreeing with your
opinion, but it's like apples and oranges imho.

like saying that zeppelin rocks harder than the big bopper.

before James Brown there was no funk.  he didn't create it by himself, but
he was there before and after and during.  what about the "funky drummer"
or "say it loud"?  those are some funky choons. no?

mis dos centavos,
Jonas

I like the funk track that built the foundation to today's funky house music. 
what james brown called "funk", sounds to me more like today's break beat and 
two-step. You can tell by the way he sang his lyrics and dances his style was 
very "huh! hit me!" *trumpet sounds* sparatic, it was not groovey smooth like 
house. but you gotta start somewhere and i'm not to say break beat can not 
also be funky, hip hop can even be funky and so can rock. I would say that Rick 
James, Parlement, and tracks like earth wind and fire's "Let's Groove Tonight" 
Michael Jackson's "Don't Stop Till You Get Enough", Roger   & Zapp and those 
uber funky tracks from the 80's & early 90's that we often times use the loose 
term "Old School" for, laid down a lot of progression and popularity for 
House music. There's a lot of house that stems from disco and there's latin house 
and just crappy club house and stuff but all the really good House tracks that 
I like seem to have a sound that comes from the funky foundation that was 
laid down by artist like Michael Jackson, Prince and Rick James bitch!
     I think a lot of it is that they weren't afraid to use electronic 
synthesizers and eletro beats. what they were experimenting with then, perhaps sped 
up and amplified a bit, is the type of house music that i listen to today.

I told you I'd remind you again! In a little less than an hour I'll be
in the red room at In House, doing my thing: minimal "techno" and
"house", as well as a smattering of various beats, breaks and dubs. Tune
in from 6-8pm:

	Open Debates is fighting to open up the debate process to alternative 
party candidates including the Libertarians. Please take a moment to 
visit their website and sign the petition, and pass the link along to 
anyone who wants real choice this year!

	Here is the text of their petition:

"We, the undersigned, support Open Debates' campaign to reform the 
presidential debate process. We believe that the presidential debates 
should serve the American people first, not political parties. We 
support replacing the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates 
with the nonpartisan Citizens' Debate Commission, so that inspiring 
formats can be
employed, pressing national issues can be addressed, and popular 
independent and third party candidates can be included."

	So far almost 10,000 people have signed. You can sign it here:

ape Now & Laters & Vodka Redbulls... & Wow...

so i get 2 Rememdy & well.. I dunno.. oh oh oh.. it was hella funny 'cause =
the bouncers were makin' fun of me as usual when I show up there & I told a=
 new bouncer there that I had 2 train him as with all the other bouncers so=
 he knows that I act this way when i'm sober, i'm not on anything.. but i w=
as a lil' drunk when i got there & told him 2 excuse me, & the other bounce=
r who i bought a burger 4 1 time actually told him I was kinda calmer that =
usual.. LoL..=20

Anywaze, I Looooooved the 1st DJs set in the main room... it was all Vocal =
Housey stuff.. I Loved it... but as the crowd grew thicker & I dance floor =
got more crowded.. i was soo not feeling it... the Remedy crowd was well.. =
there was no Groovy vibe i felt there & I dunno.. maybe it was the alcohol.=
.. but i wasn't feeling it... but the DJ was Groovy though...

So I went 2 the Fllier stand in the corner bythe exit... there was this new=
 mag out called CLUBSEEN & the 1st article in it was about Rudi.. the bounc=
er.. LMAO... so I was like, "Ya know.. I should go 2 1015 right now & have =
him autograph his pix in the article!" & I did... LoL

I got over 2 1015 & talked 2 Rudi 4 a while... LoL.. oh... I saw hella peop=
le hangin' outside in the smoking area: Tash, Vinny, DJD #1 Fan, & YAAAAY W=
IL!!!  Oh MY Goodness man.. it was Groovy.. so I chatted w. them 4 a while =
until another bouncer told me 2 either leave or go in 2 the club 2 talk 2 t=
hem.. la la la

So i walked down form there back towards 11th,, but ya know.. there was a b=
undle of stuff i wanted 2 check out... so I headed over 2 Cats Club 4 that =
Goth night thingie 2 C if Chazz Gold was there... unfortunately I didn't C =
him.. but oh my gosh man... i heard, OK... Mondo YUMMM, fuckin' ELECTRO com=

day... saw Gus... the other 1/2 of Cybrid.. YAAAAAY.. it was Dope.. so we t=
alked & shit, caught up.. (he got a new hair styyle goin on btw)... then he=
 had 2 go... Single Cell Orchestra was doin' a live PA there.. so I stayed =
outside 4 a bit listening 2 it B4 I went back 2 House...

Then I was walkin' down somemore & heard trance comin' from Shadow Lounge &=
 was encouraged 2 go in from the outside smokey people... Ooooooooooooooooo=
ooooh My Goodness... Hello 2day... I walk in & right away saw Mr Tom Slik w=
orkin' the door.. turns out that Skills has a monthly there called Melodica=
!!  Dope!! =3D)  ICON was on the decks spinning trance which she slowly tra=
nsitioned 2 Yummy Future Breakbeats.. around the club, I saw & hung out w/ =
Navaro, Dfly, TERRI (YAY, my playmate), DJD was there, & ummmmm... that's a=
ll i could remember... but yeah.. it was fun.. see.. now it felt Groovy dan=
cing there 2 ICON when she layed out some Groovy beats!!

Went back 2 DNA & well.. I guess 'cause I heard more yummier music than wha=
t was goin' on @ Rememdy.. I had a nice lil' balance & I appreciated the Ho=

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: AndyW Tekno on An Epiphany Of Sound

Yes, that freak we all know so well and love so much is stopping by An
Epiphany Of Sound this morning to drop a load of tasty techno right in
your lap.  And should he get bored, I'll join him for some tag team
action.  Don't miss out on getting a heaping helping yourself!

We're at 90.1 FM on your dial in the SF Bay area, and online at
http://kzsulive.stanford.edu

Peace!

	Did someone say they were looking for this on vinyl? I have a copy I'd 
be willing to part with. It's got four versions of the track on it, 
mixed by Ivan Ivan. The jacket isn't too pretty to look at, but the 
vinyl itself is in good shape. I'm open for cash offers, or would also 
consider trading for something you'd like to part with.

Groove on,

well that certainly ISN'T the same line-up we're used
to seeing from XTORT-> your money for the same line-up
EVERY party!  good thing originality isn't an option

these are all cybertrance-clones [peeps who ride on
the coat tails of really bad dj's].  Keep rakin' it in

Can't say it works for everyone, but something about the way Xtort does it
keeps people coming back - 5 years now or something and I've been booked for
all but maybe one or two of their events.

But then again, I'm one of them *special* people that does buy new tracks
each week - lots of them and well, I don't play *lame* trance... so maybe
that helps. ? ? ?

Gotta give credit where credit is due - and after 4 years of people
complaining, Xtort is still going strong, although I don't recommend anyone
else try to repeat the methods of his success.  Diversity IS a good and
NECESSARY thing for 99.9% of the world.

Thanks everyone, but yes this is just the way we've done our events since people have been very happy with the lineup. Each crew has a way they do their events and generally their lineup doesn't massively change over because they each have a certain following and proven method. Sorry you feel the way you do Chris, but honestly have you attended one of our events? Your comments are appreciated, but honestly if you think that we're raking in the money when we did shows like our last event Plug-n-Play for $5 then you're seriously misinformed. We all have day jobs and we love this hobby. Obviously if people didn't like what we're doing, they wouldn't attend...
 
If you have more comments feel free to email us privately too, we're always willing to listen to your constructive criticism :)

I'm DJ Rapper Soundwave
and I'm on the mike
was I drunk
was I stoned
or just high on life
I can't remember why on earth I wrote that shit
but
uh
word
and stuff
anyway
I'm like an elevator
I'm on the rise
and people speculate about my penis size
I don't get that
but if you really care
we can put a webcam in my underwear
cause when it comes to the bitches
I admit I'm a dick
all the bullshit and the drama
man it makes me sick
always asking stupid questions
like "tell me your name"
"do you have my number?"
"did you know that I came?"
bitch!
if you got questions then you better ask Jeeves
this kid's like a koala
he eats bushes and leaves
I float like a butterfly
I also stings
I'm funky like jalapeno onion rings
blah blah blah
word y0

honestly if what you're talking about ever happened in real life then
you have my sympathy but personally I really doubt it. I just find it
highly implausible. and to everybody out there who thinks driving a
Mercedes means having a big dick or rapping means raping, I don't even
know what to tell you, but I think you have a few things confused. I'm
not saying I don't have anything confused, there isn't a single person
on earth who knows me well and considers me sane, but still.

anyway, sorry for the freakout but it's not my fault you took it seriously...

Subject: Re: [sfraves] "techno"

I can think of at least one place where you'll routinely see exactly 
that.

Got to a Happy Hardcore party sometime.... one, that is, where they've 
booked DJs who play *HAPPY* hardcore, and don't just play plain old 
hardcore, thinking they've "moved beyond", or "are above" playing the 
good old cheezy stuff.  Then, just wait wait for the DJ to play one of 
the "anthem" HHC songs.

"Eyeopener" and "Ravers' Anthem" seem to work the best.  But either of 
those, and plenty others, will bring about exactly the circumstance you 
describe... everyone shivering with anticipation as they realize what 
song is coming up next, everyone singing along, everyone dancing, 
everyone sweating, everyone just so ludicrously ecstatic that "that 
special song" is playing that the "happiness" and "energy" and "joy" 
meters are pegged in the redline.

"Ravers' Anthem", in particular, is especially good for the sort of 
teasing and foreshadowing you describe.

I know Happy Hardcore has a bad rep on SFRaves.  And I don't know if it 
qualifies as having "soul" or not.  But it certainly motivates people 
in a way I seldom otherwise see.

john

SCOTT BROWN
|| Evolution Records - Scotland || *FIRST BAY AREA APPEARANCE!*
Considered by many around the world as Hardcore's #1 DJ and Producer, Scott 
Brown has achieved more in his career than many in any other genre. He's 
developed his Evolution Records label into what many reguard as the top 
Hardcore label in the world, along with releasing tracks with many of 
Hardcore's top Producers. With massive hits like "ELYSIUM", "NOW IS THE 
TIME", "TURN UP THE MUSIC", and "ICE COLD", chances are if you've been to a 
party in the past 10 years, you've heard his music. As a DJ, he is known for 
his rock solid skills on the decks, often building his sets into energetic 
frenzies that result in mayhem after it's all said and done! This will be 
Scott Brown's first Bay Area Appearance, please join us to make it 
memorable!

DJ HIXXY
|| RaverBaby / HTID / Bonkers - U.K. ||
>From his novice DJ days in 1991 to his International Hardcore Superstar 
status of today, Hixxy has worked long and hard making a name for himself in 
the Hardcore circuit. From his early releases "TOY TOWN" and "WANTING TO GET 
HIGH" to his current hits "TANTRIC" and his remix of "FALLING IN", Hixxy has 
enjoyed enormous success as a Producer. As a DJ, Hixxy helped launch the 
enormously popular "BONKERS" series on React, which continues to break sales 
records for Hardcore CD compilations. His mixes are known to be uplifting 
and energetic, so be ready as we bring Hixxy for a very rare USA appearance!

TOMMYKNOCKER
|| Traxtorm Records - Italy || *FIRST BAY AREA APPEARANCE!*
As one of the fastest rising Hardcore producers today, we are extremely 
excited to bring you Tommyknocker for his first Bay Area Appearance. Hailing 
from Italy, his unique sound has been in demand by all of the world's top 
Hardcore DJs, with hard hittin' releases like "THE AFTERMATH", "REVOLUTION", 
and "DEMOLITION". He is also an accomplished DJ, playing huge events like 
Love Parade, Hellraiser, Megarave, and Masters of Hardcore. If you like your 
Hardcore rough and rugged, Tommyknocker is your man!

DELTA 9
|| Psychotik Records / Adam Recordings - Chicago, IL || *FIRST BAY AREA 
APPEARANCE!*
Quite possibly the biggest name in American Hardcore, Delta 9 is widely 
respected and admired throughout the world of Hardcore. With his early 
releases like "HARDCORE CHICAGO", "HATE TANK", and "REAL HARDCORE", to his 
present material like "DONKEY PUNCH", "NO ESCAPE", and "PUNK LOSER", he 
continues to evolve his style to the Hardcore massive. He has appeared all 
around the globe showcasing his incredible DJ skills and crowd control, 
often taking crowds beyond their peak and back again. We are proud to 
present to you Delta 9 for his first Bay Area Appearance!

DJ VENOM
|| Volume Productions / Topaz Records - Providence, RI || *FIRST BAY AREA 
APPEARANCE!*
Looked upon as one of the most talented Hard DJ's in America, Venom's style 
and persona are only comparible to his music: wild and crazy! He goes 
seamlessly from US Hard House to Hardcore in his mixes, as showcased on such 
top-selling CD compilations as his "RAISE THE VOLUME" series, his "STRAIGHT 
BANGIN" series, and the immensely popular "HOUSE BLEND VOLUME 7-8". From his 
jaw-dropping scratching to his crowd rockin stage displays, it's no wonder 
why Venom is in such huge demand all around the country. We are hyped to 
bring you DJ Venom's first Bay Area Appearance!


CLOUDSKIPPER
|| Raw Elements / KFA / Liquidvinyldjs.com ||
The one, the only. Cloudskipper is widely recognized and respected as one of 
the top Hardcore DJ's in America. With his recent tour of the U.K. as well 
as his very busy touring here in North America, crowds all around the world 
continue to be amazed and captivated by his upfront Hardcore sets. Often 
immitated, never duplicated, Cloudskipper sets the bar other Hardcore DJ's 
will be trying to reach... next year.

DJ TRONIC
|| Resistance Recordings / Liquidvinyldjs.com / BeatSupreme.com ||
Label owner. Producer. DJ. Promoter. Is there anything he doesn't do? 
Probably not. DJ Tronic has continued to build his label Resistance 
Recordings from the ground up, watching it become one of the premiere Hard 
labels in the world with many top DJ's playing his material. All this along 
with his recent touring of France and Spain, as well as his busy touring 
schedule in the USA, it's no wonder why Tronic is such a rising talent.


THE NICE GUYS [NO LEFT TURN & DJ REESE]
|| KFA / Liquidvinyldjs.com ||
When they're not out being nice somewhere, they're out getting drunk. All 
jokes aside, these two are starting to make waves in the Hardcore world, 
with their two upcoming releases on KFA, as well as other material released 
on Raw Elements and Bedlam. Prepare for the Nice Guys, dropping a 
not-so=nice set!

THE NATURAL DISASTERS [THE DOCTOR & RECLIPSE]
|| Bayraves.com / Liquidvinyldjs.com ||
The Doctor and Reclipse, forces in their own right come together to form the 
Natural Disasters. While they're not wrestlers, they drop some of the 
hardest hittin material in the Bay, ranging from DrumNBass to Hardcore to 
Gabber, these two will be shaking the dancefloor HARD!

J-MARR & CARLOS ALFONZO
|| Bayraves.com / Liquidvinyldjs.com / Soop Recordings / BeatSupreme.com || 
[/b]
Alright, the last time we had these two together during a set, they did more 
passing out of food than actually playing. While we can't promise the same 
feast, we can promise a rockin set that only these two can bring!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] "techno"

*shudders at the thought of happy hardcore*

damn straight, HHC is a poor excuse for a musical genre.  There's no better 
way to ruin a perfectly good song than to do a happy hardcore remix.  I dont 
get happy hardcore at all.  it's not music.  I dont even know what it is, 
all i know is it's about as annoying as your lil sister or brother pointing 
their finger at you and saying "i'm not touching you."  You just wanna turn 
around and smack em.  In case you didnt know what happy was, we'll force 
feed it to you with some high speed beats and cheezy chipmunk vocals.  there 
are you happy now?  well are you?  In case you didnt grow out of your barney 
lovin' stage, we now have a musical genre to lull your under-developed mind 
into a state of ecstacy.  One of the best places to hear old played out 
songs, that only the happiest of the hardcore still like.  i cant believe 
all these kids are happy with hearing the same old songs over and over and 
over, long enough to actually learn and like the "lyrics".  It just boogles 
my mind and makes me violently ill.  Who would have guessed happy music 
would make someone violent.  Nothin better than getting drunk and trash 
talking a bunch of happy candy kids.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] "techno"

I totally agree. There is no soul in HHC. It all
pounds the same beat with hardly any melody or change
ups or originality. I bought 4 HHC records when it
first came out back in the early-mid 90's. Well at
least when I first heard of it. The music hasn't
evolved at all over the years. Friends from England
tell me all the K kids go to the gabber parties and
get babysit due to being on the babysitter. Kids love
it though. I know some kids who freak when they hear
this crap. I don't get it. Sometimes I will throw on a
HHC track for giggles to see if I missed something,
nope... I didn't miss anything... it still blows.   

Oh, another thing I have heard over the years is the
producers put out a couple HHC tracks make some money
then go bankrupt because they blow all their money on
tweak. I know the old HHC labels wouldn't last long at
all. Not sure about these days.

This is only my opinion to the music.

Genre Bashing is GRATE!  cause everyone has their opinions on the musical 
genres and there are some that people like and some that people dont like 
and well this forum prides itself on free and open speech which is exactly 
what we're doing.  It's not our fault Happykore easily lends itself to 
hateful and humorous critisism.  Maybe if it had some sort of substance it 
wouldnt get bashed on so much.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] "techno"

Let me state that I am not critical of the people who
listen to it. I have friends who like it. I don't want
the music to go away either. It opens up a genre to
people who are looking for that kind of sound.
Everyone can't enjoy eberything out there. Especially
these days with
sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
much music being produced. 

No hard feelings. 

Big love, 

Dub

"I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes 
me to tremble for the safety of my country. As a result of the war, 
corporations have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places 
will follow, and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong 
its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth is 
aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed."
-Abraham Lincoln

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

"I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of 
life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the 
beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club, 
party or other sound system that has ever achieved anything close to that..."
-Jeno, on the early days of Wicked and the Full Moon Raves

Funny, that's not how the people that were actually *there* remember it.
If you're stupid enough to believe that Kerry would have purposefully
shot an un-armed boy then you probably don't care about the facts, but
he was awarded a medal for shoring his boat to save his crew from an
rocket launcher ambush. He didn't win the Silver Star for shooting
anyone; rather, he was given the medal for the courage it took to beach
his boat in the face of an attacker, an action that quite possibly saved
the lives of his entire crew.

The "Swift Boat Veterans for Truth" are funded by the biggest Republican
campaign donor in Texas. None of the men in the ad that perpetrates
these lies served on Kerry's boat, and the guy that says he treated
Kerry's wounds didn't sign his medical forms. It's the same group that
criticized John McCain (who spent years as a POW in Vietnam) during the
2000 Republican primary. They're just a washed up bunch of bitter vets
willing to say anything to keep Bush in the white house, and if you
believe a word they say, you're an idiot.

But don't take my word for it:

Bush is a Nazi!

y'all video game geeks should check out Clone Bandits. I'm not
actually into video games that much but I have some friends who work
in the field. one of them worked on Clone Bandits and all the others
are jealous of him.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] "techno"

My two cents=E2=80=A6

Contrary to the the fact that my email address contains the word
'techno' (it's an inside joke), I can speak from an outsider's
perspective in regards to everyone that wants to sit here and slam
other people's music preference.

For the longest time I went to parties but never really got into the
music. My mantra was 'it's all techno' because it pretty much all
sounded the same to me and 'techno' was the first term I was exposed
to when referring to electronic music. I've faced heavy critisizm from
friends and aquaintences that judged me because I attended parties but
didn't dig the music. My whole reason for attending was to hang with
my friends (many of which were totally into 'techno') and to have a
good time in general.

In the scene, there seems to be an abundance of hostility between
supporters of different genres. It's like anything, from politics to
your style of dress to the food you like to eat. People have different
tastes, but that doesn't mean everyone except for you is wrong, bad or
distasteful just because they don't like what you like (except for
republicans, fucking hurry up and evolve already har har).

I used to make fun of my 'techno'-loving friends for liking it. I
wasn't really being serious about it, but I like to heckle. I listen
to primarily punk, indie, funk, industrial, alternative and
experimental stuff, so being submerged in a scene where I didn't know
or understand the music was a bit intimidating, and my natural
response was to talk shit.

Over time I learned to understand why people like 'techno' (still
using it as a general term). Some people like to dance to it, do drugs
while listening to it, sing along to the happy hardcore lyrics,
whatever. What I had to understand was that if I wanted to be so
submerged in the party scene, I might as well learn to at least
_listen_ to it. Now I'm at a point where whilst I still don't
particularly care for electronic music, I appreciate it a a form of
art. Some of it I even like, I can even recognize tracks that friends
of mine play out because I've heard them play the same record at home
while we're chillin or what not.

So this is getting really long, but my point is that I notice a lot of
hostility on this mailing list, and the hippy in me wants me to speak
out about it. We're all entitled to opinions and everyone will always
have one. We have to deal with because it's a part of human nature, so
feel free to speak out. But the minute you think someone is less of a
person because of their musical preference, you need to stop and take
a step back to judge yourself instead.

Hope I didn't piss anyone off - this message isn't being directed at
anyone in particular (I have much love for my lovely friend Buck
Murdock ;). I just get tired of opening my email and seeing people
talk shit to one another. Where's the love?! I know no one really
takes any of this seriously, so feel free to ignore and disregard my
message/opinion :o)

Peace/Love/Drugs/Techno/Punk Rock forever!!! I'll see y'all at the
next party with my pyramid-stud belt and tasteless tattoos.

Was that before or after Bush deserted the Air National Gaurd?

Pretty sure it was before Bush got arrested for drunk driving.

Anyone who disses people for what they had to endure in Vietman is
fucked up.  Nearly every soldier has a story about something horrible
they had to do over there.  

Blame the leader who sent them over there, not the soldiers.

Woohoo on the liking most forms of music (especially punk rock - I was into
punk before I ever hit a rave). But seriously - anyone who listens to and
appreciates a wide variety of music ought to be smart enough to know that
HHC sucks the big ol' horse weeny. Only slightly worse is gabber (can we say
"steel toe boots in the dryer" anyone?).

I think HHC would be great (or is it GRATE) to get little kids into EDM (by
little, I mean children under 6). But that shit is basically the EDM
equivalent of Barney the Big Purple Nightmare of a Dinosaur.

F'realz.

Troy,

	Don't you believe in people taking any personal responsibility for  
their actions? Even in the worst case scenario -- orders coming down  
from the top that not only is it OK to commit atrocities, but you are  
*required* to commit them -- doesn't the individual soldier still have  
some responsibility to say "No, I won't do that"?

	Also, soldiers accused of or admitting to having committed atrocities  
in Vietnam are a small minority, not the average person who went over  
there.

Protest Songs Finally Get Airplay
By: Randy Dotinga - [San Diego] North County Times
Wednesday, August 4, 2004

More than three decades ago, artists such as Joan Baez,
Edwin Starr and Crosby Stills Nash & Young took on the
Vietnam War in their music. Many of their songs remain
staples of classic rock today, even if their meanings
are lost to new listeners who don't realize that
Creedence Clearwater Revival's "Who'll Stop the Rain"
is about long lists of dead soldiers or that Buffalo
Springfield's "For What It's Worth" celebrates dissent.

Now the country is at war again, and the nation turns
its lonely eyes to musicians, who have responded with
---- well, not a whole lot. If you hear a song about
the conflict on the radio these days, chances are good
that you're listening to a stirring patriotic tribute
on a country music station.

Not that there's anything wrong with that. But where
are the protest songs?

It turns out that they're out there, and they're slowly
getting more airplay. "The level of anti-war dissent on
the radio has been ratcheted up steadily over the last
year," says Sean Ross, a media analyst who monitors the
radio industry.

"I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes 
me to tremble for the safety of my country.  As a result of the war, 
corporations have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places 
will follow, and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong 
its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth is 
aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed."
-Abraham Lincoln

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

  "I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of 
life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the 
beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club, 
party or other sound system that has ever achieved anything close to that..."
-Jeno, on the early days of Wicked and the Full Moon Raves

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Vietnam (was: Nrr Vidoe games anyone?)

Well in the military you do as your told...you're kinda forced to from day 
one.  If you dont you face consiquences.  And in war time you either face 
one consiquence or another.  You follow orders and you kill "threats" or you 
choose not to follow orders and not kill "threats" and you in turn get shot 
or killed.  so which is more important to you and your life?  Killing an 
"enemy" or letting them kill you?  Back then you could never trust the 
"enemy" whether he was armed or not.  They were sending lil "unarmed" kids 
with bombs attached to them....and making em run up to soldiers and give em 
a hug then detonate.  I'm sorry but when it comes down to that i'm all about 
looking after my own ass.  If it moves and it's not on my team...it's dead.  
plain and simple.  that war was serriously fucked up and i agree we should 
not have been there loosing our lives for such a petty cause.  it was 
definatly a political war, and should not have happened, but since it was 
happening the soldiers had to do what they could.  Hell for the first little 
bit of the war we couldnt shoot anyone unless we were given orders to shoot. 
  that's fucked up...once they start shooting at you and you get 
"permission" the fights nearly over.  So once we basically got the go ahead 
to fire back at will...it was us or them.  And since we werent supposed to 
be over there...why not make sure you stay alive so you can come home and 
back to your family.

what do you think the set overlap is between the set of Vietnam
veterans and the set of homeless people?

what do you think the set overlap is between the set of Vietnam
veterans and the set of homeless people who would be fine if they had
access to badly-needed psychiatric health care?

which American President recently slashed veterans benefits and
invaded a foreign country during the same year?

isn't beating up on Vietnam vets kind of 1972?

isn't it interesting how we have a choice between a warmongering rich
boy who dodged the draft and a Vietnam vet who wants peace?

what's the Arabic word for "Vietnam"?

I guess the point is that even if this Kerry story has any truth to it
at all (which I pretty much doubt, seeing that the author is a right-wing
nut job: http://www.salon.com/books/wire/2004/08/11/slurs/index.html),
shooting somone in battle is hardly an atrocity.  Who could actually
say which direction a boy might be running?  Who could tell if he was
unarmed?  In the heat of battle, could you tell if he was a boy or 
a man?

I guess I am just sick of this kerry/vietman smear campaign.  It insults
everyone that had to endure that hellhole, including members of my own
family.

I am glad McCain had a small amount of balls to sort of speak up against
it.  But I wish he would have forced Bush to condemn the book.

anyone that likes/appreciates Bad Religion (am i on the wrong mailing
list?) should check out track #7 off their new album entitled _The
Empire Strikes First_. the whole record is extremely ill but track 7
is the BEST. and if u dont want to listen to it you should at least
read the lyrics.

peas, luv and cheez-whiz.

Hahah wow I didn't even know there was some actual accusation here...

Anyway, true or not, I don't give a fuck.
The fog of war makes accidents happen, innocent civilians get killed- that's
just how it goes.
And yeah, it didn't take many "I looked over and my buddy was still running
but he had no head" stories before I realized just how things were there...

Subject: [sfraves] todd sines in SF - techno?

hey, so i saw on another list that todd sines is
playing in SF this weekend, and i believe the
announcement said he would be playing techno sets
here.  i'll have to hear it to believe it myself, but
here's the info. i got:

12 August / RIOT at the Top / SF
13 August / Voda / SF
15 August / Bionic at Pink w/ Slater Hogan, Iz / SF

Note: i saw an ad for Voda in the Weekly, and Sines'
name was not listed, so who knows?  anyway, i'm
checking him out at the Top on Thursday.

Empire Strikes First_. the whole record is extremely ill but track 7
is the BEST. and if u dont want to listen to it you should at least
read the lyrics.

Walter Cronkite Speaks Out on Reform

Dear Steve,

 Walter
Cronkite<http://emailimages.ctsg.com/ImageLibrary/DPA/E2Action/cronkite9
0x90.jpg> Walter Cronkite has often been described as "the most trusted
man in America."=20

I am delighted to tell you that he has joined the Drug Policy Alliance's
new U.S. Honorary Board. Below is his most recent syndicated column
<http://actioncenter.drugpolicy.org/ctt.asp?u=3D47049&l=3D49872>  =
discussing
drug reform, which has run in nearly 180 papers nationwide.

Our efforts to build a national advocacy organization and political
movement to end the "war on drugs" benefit in all sorts of ways when
famous and highly respected citizens choose to associate themselves
formally with the Drug Policy Alliance.=20

If you have any suggestions regarding other people of distinction who
might be considered for our U.S. Honorary Board, especially those whose
names might surprise us and others, please let me know.

Very Truly Yours,

=20

Prisons Needlessly Overpopulated With Drug Offenders

By Walter Cronkite

In the midst of the soaring rhetoric of last week's Democratic
Convention, more than one speaker quoted Abraham Lincoln's first
inaugural address, invoking "the better angels of our nature."

Well, there is an especially appropriate task awaiting those heavenly
creatures: a long-overdue reform of our disastrous "war on drugs." We
should begin by recognizing its costly and inhumane dimensions.=20

Much of the nation, in one way or another, is victimized by this
failure, including, most notably, the innocents, whose exposure to drugs
is greater than ever.=20

This is despite the fact that more than 500,000 people are housed in
federal and state prisons and local jails on drug offenses. Clearly, no
punishment could be too severe for that portion of them who were
kingpins of the drug trade and who ruined so many lives. But, by far,
the majority of these prisoners are guilty of only minor offenses, such
as possessing small amounts of marijuana. That includes people who used
it only for medicinal purposes. The cost to maintain this great horde of
prisoners is more than $10 billion annually.=20

And that's just part of the cost of this war on drugs: The federal,
state and local drug-control budgets last year added up to almost $40
billion.=20

These figures were amassed by the Drug Policy Alliance, one of the
foremost national organizations seeking to bring reason to the war on
drugs and reduce substantially those caught in the terrible web of
addiction.=20

There are awful tales of tragedy and shocking injustice hidden in those
figures -- the product of an almost mindlessly draconian system called
"mandatory sentencing" in which even small offenses can draw years in
prison.=20

Thousands of women, many of them mothers of young children, are included
among those minor offenders. Those children left without motherly care
are the most innocent victims of the drug war and the reason some call
it a "war on families" as well as on drugs.=20

Women are the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. prison population,
with almost 80 percent of them incarcerated for drug offenses.=20

The deep perversity of the system lies in the fact that women with the
least culpability often get the harshest sentences.=20

Unlike the guilty drug dealer, they often have no information to trade
for a better deal from prosecutors and might end up with a harsher
sentence than the dealer gets.=20

Then there are women such as Kimba Smith, in California, who probably
knew a few things but was so terrified of her abusive boyfriend that she
refused to testify against him.=20

( Those who agree to testify, by the way, frequently are killed before
they have a chance to do so. )

Smith paid for her terrified silence with a 24-year sentence.=20

Nonviolent first offenders, male and female, caught with only small
amounts of a controlled substance frequently are given prison sentences
of five to 10 years or more.=20

As a result, the number of nonviolent offenders in the nation's prisons
is filling them to overflowing, literally.=20

The resulting overcrowding is forcing violent felons onto the streets
with early releases.=20

The Drug Policy Alliance also points out other important areas of
injustice in the present enforcement system.=20

For instance, people of color -- blacks and Hispanics -- are far more
likely to be jailed for drug offenses than others.=20

And college students caught in possession of very small amounts of
illegal substances are denied student loans and even food stamps.=20

The Alliance and other organizations are working to reform and reframe
the war on drugs. And they are finding many judges on their side, who
are rebelling against this cruel system.=20

We can expect no federal action during the congressional hiatus in
activity ahead of the November elections, but it would be of
considerable help if, across the country, campaigning politicians put
this high on their promises of legislative action, much sooner than
later.=20

Walter Cronkite's column is distributed by King Features Syndicate and
originally appeared August 6, 2004.=20

	In John Kerry's case, he apparently wasn't being threatened when on 
his own initiative he chased down and killed an unarmed teenager. And 
no, I'm not defending Bush, and you're welcome to make whatever 
comparisons or attacks on him you want. I'll likely agree with you. But 
let's not make the mistake of saying "It doesn't matter that Kerry did 
X, because Bush did Y."

	It wasn't a "petty cause." Three countries (South Vietnam, Cambodia, 
and Laos) were overrun by the North Vietnamese communists or 
insurgencies supported by them and fell under oppressive communist 
regimes because the United States lost that war. Millions of people 
died as a consequence.

See http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/COM.TAB1.GIF (remember to add 
three zeros to each number, because the totals are in thousands).

	And if you ever get a chance, watch the film "The Killing Fields" for 
a graphic look at what happened in Cambodia under the communist Khmer 
Rouge.

First it's "boy", now it's "teenager"....

This just smacks of propaganda-
Bottom line- until you've been *in combat*, you have no platform from which
to judge the man's action in combat, period.

Troy,

	Here are some details on what the authors of "Unfit for Command" are 
saying. I'll let you judge for yourself. In any case, it's not just one 
guy ("right wing nut job" or not) questioning Kerry's record in 
Vietnam. It's a whole group of veterans.

VETS CHARGE: KERRY KILLED FLEEING TEEN; LIED FOR MEDAL

Slaughters Animals, Burns Down Tiny Village

**Exclusive**

A veterans group seeking to deeply discredit Democrat John Kerry's
military service will charge in the new bombshell book UNFIT FOR
COMMAND:

"Kerry earned his Silver Star by killing a lone, fleeing, teenage
Viet Cong in a loincloth."

"And if Kerry's superiors had known the truth at the time, they would
never have recommended him for the medal."

The book also claims to detail how Kerry personally ordered the
slaughter of small animals at a small hamlet along the Song Bo De
River.

MORE

The book, set for release next week, hit #1 on the AMAZON hitparade
after the DRUDGE REPORT revealed details of the book -- a book the
Kerry campaign believes is the "the dirtiest of all dirty tricks ever
played on a candidate for the presidency."

The Kerry campaign is planning to vigorously counter the charges and
will accuse the veteran's groups of being well-financed by a top Bush
donor from Texas.

The vets have launched a blistering new TV commercial questioning
Kerry's honor and calling him a liar.

MORE

George Bates, an officer in Coastal Division 11, participated in
numerous operations with Kerry. In UNFIT FOR COMMAND, Bates recalls a
particular patrol with Kerry on the Song Bo De River. He is still
"haunted" by the incident:

With Kerry in the lead, the boats approached a small hamlet with
three or four grass huts. Pigs and chickens were milling around
peacefully. As the boats drew closer, the villagers fled. There were
no political symbols or flags in evidence in the tiny village. It was
obvious to Bates that existing policies, decency, and good sense
required the boats to simply move on.

Instead, Kerry beached his boat directly in the small settlement.
Upon his command, the numerous small animals were slaughtered by
heavy-caliber machine guns. Acting more like a pirate than a naval
officer, Kerry disembarked and ran around with a Zippo lighter,
burning up the entire hamlet.

Bates has never forgotten Kerry's actions.

MORE

UNFIT FOR COMMAND, DRUDGE has learned, claims Kerry "earned his
Silver Star by killing a lone, fleeing, teenage Viet Cong in a
loincloth."

ARE THE VETS TELLING THE TRUTH?

"They hired a goddamn private investigator to dig up trash!" charged
a top Kerry adviser traveling with the senator late Tuesday. "This is
pay for play... How low can they go?"

Kerry supporters are comparing the effort by the veterans to the
Arkansas State troopers tell-all against Bill Clinton.

MORE

John O'Neill, co-author of UNFIT FOR COMMAND, believes that "Kerry's
Star would never have been awarded had his actions been reviewed
through normal channels. In his case, he was awarded the medal two
days after the incident with no review. The medal was arranged to
boost the morale of Coastal Division 11, but it was based on false
and incomplete information provided by Kerry himself."

According to Kerry's Silver Star citation, Kerry was in command of a
three-boat mission on the Dong Cung River. As the boats approached
the target area, they came under intense enemy fire. Kerry ordered
his boat to attack and all boats opened fire. He then beached
directly in front of the enemy ambushers. In the battle that
followed, the crews captured enemy weapons. His boat then moved
further up the river to suppress more enemy fire. A rocket exploded
near Kerry's boat, and he ordered to charge the enemy. Kerry beached
his boat 10 feet from the rocket position and led a landing party
ashore to pursue the enemy.

Kerry' citation reads: "The extraordinary daring and personal courage
of Lt. Kerry in attacking a numerically superior force in the face of
intense fire were responsible for the highly successful mission."

Here's what O'Neill and the Swiftees say: "According to Kerry's
crewman Michael Madeiros, Kerry had an agreement with him to turn the
boat in and onto the beach if fired upon. Each of the three boats
involved in the operation was involved in the agreement." O'Neill
writes that one crewman even recalls a discussion of probable medals.

Doug Reese, a pro Kerry Army veteran, recounted what happened that
day to O'Neill, "Far from being alone, the boats were loaded with
many soldiers commanded by Reese and two other advisors. When fired
at, Reese's boat--not Kerry's--was the first to beach in the ambush
zone. Then Reese and other troops and advisors (not Kerry)
disembarked, killing a number of Viet Cong and capturing a number of
weapons. None of the participants from Reese's boat received Silver
Stars.

O'Neill continues: "Kerry's boat moved slightly downstream and was
struck by a rocket-propelled grenade. . . .A young Viet Cong in a
loincloth popped out of a hole, clutching a grenade launcher, which
may or may not have been loaded. . . Tom Belodeau, a forward gunner,
shot the Viet Cong with an M-60 machine gun in the leg as he fled. .
. . Kerry and Medeiros (who had many troops in their boat) took off,
perhaps with others, and followed the young Viet Cong and shot him in
the back, behind a lean to."

O'Neill concludes "Whether Kerry's dispatching of a fleeing, wounded,
armed or unarmed teenage enemy was in accordance with the customs of
war, it is very clear that many Vietnam veterans and most Swiftees do
not consider this action to be the stuff of which medals of any kind
are awarded; nor would it even be a good story if told in the cold
details of reality. There is no indication that Kerry ever reported
that the Viet Cong was wounded and fleeing when dispatched. Likewise,
the citation simply ignores the presence of the soldiers and advisors
who actually 'captured the enemy weapons' and routed the Viet Cong. .
. . [and] that Kerry attacked a 'numerically superior force in the
face of intense fire' is simply false. There was little or no fire
after Kerry followed the plan. . . . The lone, wounded, fleeing young
Viet Cong in a loincloth was hardly a force superior to the heavily
armed Swift Boat and its crew and the soldiers carried aboard."

DRUDGE learns from UNFIT FOR COMMAND that if Kerry's superior
officers knew the truth, they would never have recommended the award:

"Admiral Roy Hoffmann, who sent a Bravo Zulu (meaning "good work"),
to Kerry upon learning of the incident, was very surprised to
discover in 2004 what had actually occurred. Hoffmann had been told
that Kerry had spontaneously beached next to the bunker and almost
single-handedly routed a bunkered force in Viet Cong. He was shocked
to find out that Kerry had beached his boat second in a preplanned
operation, and that he had killed a single, wounded teenage foe as he
fled."

"Commander Geoge Elliott, who wrote up the initial draft of Kerry's
Silver Star citation, confirms that neither he, nor anyone else in
the Silver Star process that he knows, realized before 1996 that
Kerry was facing a single, wounded young Viet Cong fleeing in a
loincloth. While Commander Elliott and many other Swiftees believe
that Kerry committed no crime in killing the fleeing, wounded enemy
(with a loaded or empty launcher), others feel differently. Commander
Elliott indicates that a Silver Star recommendation would not have
been made by him had he been aware of the actual facts."

  For one i'd like to know how anyone really knows he chased him down with 
out being provoked first.  it's all hear say unless you were there chillin 
in the jungle watching him.

To me...that's a petty cause.  It aint our country who cares what's goin on 
over there.  We had serious probelms going on in our own contry...still do, 
but back then there were problems in the country that could have been taken 
care of or at least we could have tried to take care of em.  How many 
thousands of men and women died and how many millions of dollars were 
wasted, fighting someone elses fight.  If the south didnt want to be 
communist, then fight your own damn fight.  You'll either win and get what 
you want, or you'll be totally eliminated and it wont matter, at least you 
gave it your all to try and stop it.  We really had no business being over 
there other than to stop the spread of communisim...because of the Great Big 
Red Scare.  And that wasnt really an enemy of anyone but our government.  
And our government felt it was right to send off our children to die for a 
cause that didnt benifit them in anyway.

  Seen it, good movie...i dig it.  Sucks that shit was going on.  but you 
know what, that shit went on in other contries...and still does.  and again 
it all falls back on, if it doesnt benifit our country, then way waste lives 
and resources trying to stop it?  sure it's the nice thing to do...but is it 
really worth loosing all our own people over?  Or having the few that 
survived come home to a country that hates them for their actions, when all 
they were doing was following the chain of command and trying to survive so 
they could get the hell out of what they too felt was a pointless war to 
fight.  I'm sorry but if i somehow got stuck in a war that i didnt support, 
i would do anything and everything to ensure that i survived.  if that means 
possibly killing the occasional civilian or child or VC regular, than so be 
it.  When my life is on the line its the only life i look after.  Many of 
our soldiers felt the same way and had to do things that under normal 
circumstances would not do...and look how badly it's fucked some of them up. 
  and who do we have to blame?  our own dumbass chickenshit government.

This is part of the Republicans' attempt to do a hack job on Kerry's
military record. Get enough talking heads repeating the same point on TV
over and over, so it must be true, right? It's really sad. As someone
mentioned before, they used the same tactics on McCain in the presidantial
primary race in 2000. Don't buy it.

I am going to trust the veterans that actually served on his boat.
None of them contributed to this book.

But whatever, any way you slice it, Kerry choose to go to vietnam and put his
life at risk for his country when he didn't even have to.

Yes, I agree with you totally.  And the kind of "combat" we became involved 
with both in Vietnam and now Iraq is the worst.  Many of the "enemy" were 
not in uniforms.  Very young people, both male and female, carried weapons 
or were actively engaged in supporting their causes.

I really don't want to get involved in the sordid details of our "war" in 
Vietnam.  One lesson I took away from the whole mess:  had we become 
involved in constructive engagement, both political and economic, with the 
Vietnamese back then we would have had what we have now, without all the 
bloodshed -- a trade partner moving in the direction we would have 
preferred.  Something electronic I bought the other day had "Made in 
Vietnam" on it:)

Same with Cuba.  Castro came to us first for support after his just 
revolution and what did we do?  Attempted to assassinate him;  supported an 
invasion of Cuba; and pretty much gave him the finger.  So he turned to the 
Russians for aid and trade.  We still embargo that country.  Stupid.  Had 
we engaged Cuba's socialist regime in the early sixties we would all be 
smoking Cuban cigars now.

Yet we supported totalitarian regimes all over South America over the 
years, as long as they weren't "socialist."

Bottom line.  Constructive engagement should be preferred over military 
action, trade embargoes, and political isolation.  Certainly careful 
manipulation of Saddam, as we did prior to the Gulf War, could have 
achieved a better end than the current mess.  Engagement with Iran would 
produce much better short and long-term results than sabre waving.  And so 
on....  IMHO.

Love,

Apollo

Did you even read that?

A bunch of boats are going down the river and are fired upon-
Both boats turn towards the assault and land on the beach.
Kerry's boat is hit by a rocket propelled grenade.
A teenage VC pops out of a hole in front of Kerry *clutching the grenade
launcher* and starts running away.
Kerry shoots him.
Uhm- what more justification do you personally need for shooting an enemy
combatant?
This guy just HIT THE FUCKING BOAT WITH AN RPG.

The text seems to focus more on the fact that the *rest* of all the boat
crewmen deserved medals for their actions too...

Subject: [sfraves] RE: Vietnam

Now here's a solid fact you should consider Starchild.

The people who "served" with Kerry who your quoting about the teenager 
incident weren't even in his company. And by them saying "served" means they 
were in Vietnam at the same time. Most not even in the immediate range of 
the incident.

Also, you have to take into the deepest of consideration that if this EVER 
was as serious of an incident or issue then such "horrible acts" would have 
surfaced long before his run for presidency.
The group of pissed of veterans could have appealed to revoke his medals a 
very LONG time ago.

And only now b/c of the elections are such things "coming to light" b/c of 
the enormous amount of funds and paid testimonies.

Which makes more sense ?

A.) A blood thirsty soldier trigger happy to gun down anyone in his way with 
no remorse of concern for human life.
B.)Or vietnam soldier in a intense situation unsure of the safety of himself 
and his platoon.

Even if you pick A. and think that he did gun down an innocent teenager with 
no concern, don't you think him being that person would have had many more 
incidents like this.. thus flagging his actions and putting him in more 
scrutiny for his combat mentality.

Come on now. Your talking about a one time situation that could of easily 
been either side. We couldn't possibly validate to the fullest any argument. 
But you can use simple logic and determine; if he was that kind of person 
doesn't it make sense that there would be more incidents and more 
information proving his character was of a malicious murderer in war time.

I met one of them two weeks ago in Iowa.  A sniper (or a "sharpshooter",
as faux news heads have instructed their reporters to call them) of all
things.  He could barely function at a basic level.  Would almost
collapse to the ground for no appararent reason, other than the mind
fuck he had just gone through.  You could see it in his eyes.  You could
also see in his eyes, and from talking to him, that he was a good kid
overall.  Just sent into a foreign country to "murder for you guys."
Well, it wasn't "for" me, or for most people I know.

And these guys are given a two week break to come back home, see their
family and friends, before being shipped back to kill again.  I
certainly hope that guy makes it back home another time.

Greg Palast claims he interviewed someone with the Texas Natl. Guard who
admitted to destroying all those documents in Bush's guard duty record.

Buba". It was after this that they began work together and soon experienced=20=
the=20
magic of having musical knowledge and extensive DJing backgrounds, which=20
resulted in several 12" releases on labels such as Boombox, Kickin, Black Je=
sus and=20
Quiet Riot. It also led to them starting their own label, Domination, on=20
which they released Poetry's EP.
After some years of full studio work, playing regularly at local clubs and=20
touring Europe and the States as sidemen with different Norwegian bands and=20
projects, they started out by releasing material on Certificate 18 and Teebe=
e's=20
label, Subtitles.
They are now situated in Norway. Their sets, usually when not straight=20
DJ-ing, consist of turntablism, computers, and live acts on different settin=
gs=20
working with drums, saxophone, human beat box, synths, vocalists and tabla.
"Our music philosophy is not to have any boundaries. We try to make what=20

 want.=20
Our influences come from all genres; r&b, pop, rock, jazz, indian, breakbeat=
,=20
techno, house, and we believe people shouldn't forget where they are coming=20

My parents have had a lifelong obsession with tracking down the truth
behind American politics. They found out about Iran-Contra at least
three years before the mainstream media. (I say at least three because
I knew about it in sixth grade, and the media found out when I was in
high school.) Anyway, they love Greg Palast.

Mind you, my parents own llamas. So it's an endorsement, but it's a
conditional endorsement.

I dont how the post went from vidoe games to VIETNAM, people die every frickin day. This whole thing shouldnt even be an issue. You guys cant say what you would do in that kind of situation, cuz you were probably never put in that kind of situation. When it comes down to it are you gonna shot, hide, flee or surrender. It all comes down to what kind of person you are. Life is life, death is death. Live your life to the fullest b4 you die. Americans always sticking thier heads in something they shouldnt be sticking thier heads in. Should have america been in vietnam? Should america be in Iraq? Should america be in anyone elses lands? Why cant everyone just get along. Well thier are my thoughts on what I read today off the list.Yall stay up.

"no, but i was hoping that you might be sort of into me since i won't have blonde hair like everyone else does lately."
"it will grow back, you know. i don't remember you being blonde either."
"i could be if i wanted to. my hair won't grow back... not if i can help it. i am going to eat as little folic acid as possible, and you'll see." :)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] "techno"

Just because music is fast, doesn't make it hard.

There's NOTHING hardcore about happy hardcore. It's got the wrong name.

I'll keep using HHC on the rare chance it comes up in discussion, but it'll
stand for "hardly hard core".

Subject: [sfraves] Reminder:  Grandmaster Flash and 2 Bad Mice next weekend

SF next weekend, August 20th and 21st.

the 20th will be 21+ at Club Mighty.
the 21st will be an all ages party in Oakland.

complete BSP to come!

note:  i have an old breakdancing album with "The Adventures of Grand Master 
Flash on the Wheels of Steel."  i remember being in grade school listening 
to that song over and over on a record player my aunt gave me.  i thought it 
was the most incredible song ever.  on the 20th, which is also my birthday, 
i get to open the party for Flash...and i couldn't be more excited!

Subject: [sfraves] reality nrr

hello, this is a continuation of a fictional piece:

"do you follow the rules?"
"sometimes."
"why?"
"well, sometimes, i have no choice, and sometimes, i
just think the rules are pretty good, so i follow
them, and sometimes, i don't like the rules, but it
seems like the best thing to do at the time would be
to follow the rules."
"why is that?"
"well, sometimes, i get some extra money or an extra
five minutes of sleep if i follow the rules."
"so, you are driven by greed."
"no, i am just tired and hungry." :)

Brandishing a knife to store employees?

Then lunging at the cops?
*After* they had already tried the non-lethal Taser?

There's always more to the story...
(no friend of SJPD myself)

Aug. 12 (BCN) =8B  Two San Jose police officers shot and killed a shoplifting
suspect this morning after the man allegedly lunged at them with a knife,
Sgt. Steve Dixon said today.

 Employees at a Radio Shack store at 779 Story Road called police to report
that there was a shoplifter in the store, who when confronted by employees,
had thrown merchandise at them and brandished a knife, Dixon said.

 Two officers arrived at the scene and attempted to detain the suspect,
described only as a man in his late 20s or early 30s, who resisted arrest,
according to police.

 The suspect began to run westbound on Story Road and officers deployed
Taser, but it didn't stop him and foot chase ensued, Dixon said. The suspec=
t
then allegedly lunged toward officers with a knife in hands, causing both
officers to open fire, killing the suspect, Dixon said.

 The suspect was shot just past intersection of Roberts Street and Story
Road.

if anybody can tell me where to find this I'd be very grateful. they
had it at Cody's in Berkeley for a while but it seems they've stopped

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Choplifter

Are you the guy that created acidtetris?!  I used to play that.. Um..
Sober, yeah sober when I lived in Utah :) It might be a different
version, it would've been like 96 or 97 that I was playing it.  

Those games are all classics too, but what about Outlaw, Jumpman, Super
Pipeline, World Karate, Grogs Revenge, Wizard! , Spin Dizzy, Marble
Maddness, Shamus, Crystal Palace,Archon and M.U.L.E. II :)

dude, it's all about Joust. Joust, Leisure Suit Larry, Tempest,
Gauntlet, and Spyhunter.

I have a domain called acidtetris.com...I'm not saying anyone should
ever play Tetris on acid, though. that would be crazy talk.

choplifter was grate !  hell, i still got that sheite...  in fact i've
got probably every 68k game known to man.  some of my fav's are
Acolade's Gran Prix (amazing if only for the fact that you can get a
full-motion 3d-style driving game to run flawlessly on an 8MHz Mac
Plus !), loderunner, glider, crystal quest, OXYD, bolo, Star Wars, and
of course the ubiquotous Net-Trek (used to play that with all the
programmer geeks with sparc 1's whenever i wasn't workin'/commandering
the work computers to do my schoolwork on ;)

of course i think my absolute fav is a toss up between virtual valerie
or tony's girl =P

-=dave

ps - for the color games Maelstrom, Arashi, SpaceQuest, Prince of
Persia and Otherworld P0wn3d !

anyone in need of 68k shizzle, i have the key to your mecca. . .

God I loved Oxyd. I would spend hours playing that on my PowerBook 140.
Wonder if that would run under the Classic emulator in OS X? Crystal Quest
and LodeRunner also favs. Games today are so sophisticated it's insane.
Anyone played with Doom 3 yet? Even running it at medium detail and without
all of the full effects on is unreal...

The Midway Arcade Compilation for PS2 (with Joust, Gauntlet, more) is 
sooper grate. I remember riding the bus for hours to play those games at 
the mall.

And gotta give it up for Choplifter, Castle Wolfenstein, the Ultimas, 
Wizardry, Jungle Cunt, etc. Those games got me through middle school ;-) 
Used to have a lot of fun cracking the games and messing with the opening 
screens, graphics, gameplay, whatever I could get into.

I thought "jungle cunt" was a girl who didnt shave or nothing.  I hate 
playing that game...far too much pausing, to pick ones teeth, for me.  I 
prefer putting on a nice well kept green.

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) Re: Vietnam

	It seems reasonable to assume as you do that the young VietCong 
fighter who Kerry shot was the same individual who had fired at Kerry's 
boat, although the account doesn't actually say that. But several 
well-armed troops chasing down a lone fleeing teenager who had no 
weapon to fight back (you can hardly use a grenade launcher while 
running away from people who are shooting at you, even if one assumes 
it was loaded) and shooting him in the back isn't exactly the kind of 
heroic action deserving of a medal, now is it?

	And what can be said about these incidents?

What can be said?  That when you unleash the true evil of war you can 
expect evil in return.  When good souls enter the heart of darkness they 
can't help but be affected by this man made hell.  In combat one has little 
time to make decisions about whether one's actions are good or bad...one 
reacts swiftly to preserve one's ass and the butts of your comrades.

So...never ever enter this dark place of war unless it is absolutely 
necessary.  Everyone pays a heavy price.

This book about Kerry, BTW, is just more political bullshit.

Love,

Apollo

I suppose you believe Max Clelland is a wimp and terrorist coddler because 
he voted the
wrong way on that bill.... and of course Nader isn't a egotistical 
hypocrite fifth columnist
who isn't trying to disrupt the election so the GOP will win - he's an 
"idealist" committed

business areas,
he's just as bad as any cigar chewing fat cat slavedriver.....

when trying to figure what exactly happened, one has to examine not only 
facts, but the motivations,
integrity, and how well one story cross references with the others (minus 
the failings of witnesses'
memories)

it's just like with the law and trials - that's why lawyers get the big 
bucks - to nail down
inconsistencies (the defense) to get their client off or emotionally sway 
the jury
despite the "facts" (the prosecutors)

in such matters as Vietnam, the only person whom I'd believe was objective 
would be a time traveling

and this principle goes double for politics.  and 10x for Vietnam mixed 
with politics

and look at the diction used in accounting this "incident" - it is subtly 
inflammatory
and would sufficiently emotionally influence a naive reader towards viewing 
Kerry in a negative
light.  You only have to sway people ever so much - no really big time, but 
just enough to get
the subconscious processing going even though they may intellectually 
reject the information.
Enough subtle sources build up on top of one another - lots of little lies 
compound into a more
diffuse "Big Lie" - which can't be refuted as well as one sharp and crisp.

Karl Rove et al know exactly what they're doing.  They learnt from 
Goebbel's mistakes

not that I'm all for Kerry, mind you.  he's just a kinder, gentler fascist 
- a speed bump on the road
to hell America is going down and there's no u-turns, no exits, and this 
process America is going
thru can't be stopped.

so on that note, here's some more data about the authors of that 
"objective" book

Jerome Corsi, co-author of the Kerry bashing Swift boat book that claims 
all of Kerry's war record
is a big lie has an interesting history and has made a few inflammatory 
statements in the past:

http://mediamatters.org/items/200408120001

On FreeRepublic.com, Corsi has, among other things, said
that "ragheads" are "boy buggers"; referred to "John F*ing
Kerry"; called Senator Hillary Clinton a "Fat Hog"; referred
to her daughter as "Chubby Chelsie" Clinton; referred to
Janet Reno as "Janet Rhino"; called Katie Couric "Little
Katie Communist"; suggested Kerry was "practicing Judaism";
and expressed the wish that a small plane that had crashed
into a building in Los Angeles had instead crashed into the
set of NBC'S The West Wing, thereby killing actor Martin
Sheen

CORSI: Let's see exactly why it isn't the case that Islam is
a worthless, dangerous Satanic religion? Where's the proof
to the contrary? (04/24/2004)

CORSI: Islam is like a virus -- it affects the mind -- maybe
even better as an analogy -- it is a cancer that destroys
the body it infects... No doctor would hesitate to eliminate
cancer cells from the body. (11/26/02)

CORSI: Islam is a peaceful religion as long as the women are
beaten, the boys buggered, and the infidels killed.
(11/22/2002)

CORSI: Isn't the Democratic Party the official SODOMIZER
PROTECTION ASSOCIATION of AMERICA -- oh, I forgot, it was
just an accident that Clintoon's first act in office was to
promote "gays in the military." RAGHEADS are Boy-Bumpers as
clearly as they are Women-Haters -- it all goes together.
(11/18/2001)

CORSI: Anybody ask why HELLary couldn't keep BJ Bill
satisfied? Not lesbo or anything, is she? (06/08/2003)

Subject: RE: [sfraves] (nrr) Re: Vietnam

Continuing on from Apollo's statement...

Now think for a second that a fleeing soldier appears to be lugging a
bazooka with them.  Now RPG's are only one shot, why would the "teen" be
carrying it.  It almost sounds like a full on trap was about to be
sprung.  Put weapon in hand of someone visible and have them run towards
the VC's backup.  Why would a single teen be firing on 3 boats if had no
kind of alternative plan?  Second would be to try and get to shore asap
in case there is more, they will have the advantage on you since they're
hiding in thick jungle foliage.  This is speculation of course, but
these are also the decisions that need to run through a soldiers mind
when they are protecting the lives of three boatfulls of their own men.
Yes soldiers have the "option" to desert in battle for moral reasons.
But when you see your best friend next to you who has already saved your
life or you've sworn to protect them, anyone at that point who looks
like an enemy is going down.

Also, at this time the idea that our President could be very very wrong
in going to war without a just cause had just barely started coming into
people's minds.  Before this virtually every war had been 'just.'  The
Korean War started making people think twice about it then when Vietnam
happened, the peace movement was going in to full swing.  We had never
seen anything like this before.  America had always gone in, kicked
butt, had casualties but saved the day.  Here was this Red Threat.
Communists could destroy our very way of life.  People didn't have
access to the education we have now.  They had no internet.  These
people for the most part truly believed they were helping all of
humanity by fighting in Vietnam.  Stopping a new kind of Hitler.  At
least until they got there.

And honestly.. For this group to blame anything on Kerry for Vietnam and
not turn one finger towards Bush for giving the go on attacking Iraq, in
which his decision to drop the bombs killed many many innocents.  His
voice pulled the proverbial trigger.  He might as well have been flying
every mission.  He knew exactly what was going to happen to civilian
lives.  Just because Kerry was face to face with one that actually fired
on him and his men, doesn't mean Bush gets to hide behind his desk in
the Oval Office and wash his hands of it.  He lied to congress, the
American Public and the world about our reasons we were even going.
Regardless if his sources messed up, as president he answers for all
those who work for him.  If he commands them, then what they do under
his command is his direct personal responsibility.

Has anyone on the list been to the jungles of Vietnam?  I haven't but
I'm pretty sure that they're not a very bright place, probably very
dark, shapes are hard to discern, especially with natives who know how
to blend in.  Seeing a figure holding a stick from a boat would look
very much like anyone holding a gun.  You responsibility at that point
if you're still alive is to alert your superior so they can alert theirs
and try and make sure the person who just shot at you doesn't report to
their superior.  War is ugly.  I hate war.  I don't even really like
Kerry, but the political mudslinging on both sides of the fence this
year is making me absolutely sick.  I honestly can't see how the record
of a few isolated incidents in the vietnam war vs. what Bush has done
and is doing currently.

Voting for Jon Stewart,
Rayn

What can be said?  That when you unleash the true evil of war you can 
expect evil in return.  When good souls enter the heart of darkness they

can't help but be affected by this man made hell.  In combat one has
little 
time to make decisions about whether one's actions are good or bad...one

reacts swiftly to preserve one's ass and the butts of your comrades.

So...never ever enter this dark place of war unless it is absolutely 
necessary.  Everyone pays a heavy price.

This book about Kerry, BTW, is just more political bullshit.

Love,

Apollo

that..." -Jeno, on the early days of Wicked and the Full Moon Raves

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Vietnam

	The sources are other Vietnam veterans, as quoted in the 
aforementioned book "Unfit To Serve." I posted an article from Matt 
Drudge to the list which goes into some further detail about it. 
Whether it's credible you will have to judge for yourself. Personally I 
do believe it -- just as I believe that George W. Bush used cocaine, 
used improper influence to get out of being drafted and then skipped 
out on his National Guard service, etc.

	It has been widely remarked during this campaign that John Kerry is a 
cautious man by nature. He was in Vietnam for four months. Does it seem 
more likely to you that this careful guy engaged in such daring and 
heroism during that relatively brief time to earn a Silver Star and 
three Purple Heart medals, or rather that he had a political gift for 
self-promotion which he put to good use in making his combat record 
look more noble than it actually was?

Oh give me a break. Matt Drugde is a gossip monger, he'll publish
anything controversial if he can call it a "scoop". He's not even a
journalist, let alone credible.

What's interesting is that there's nobody to substantiate what Bush did
(or didn't do) during his National Guard service. Nobody even remembers
serving with him during the period in question, let alone whether he
showed up for a medical checkup. Kerry's got a bunch of men that served
directly under him to backup what his superiors later awarded him medals
for.

Furthermore, nobody on the left put up hundreds of thousands of dollars
to expose the truth about Bush's misadventures during Vietnam. The very
fact that this "controversy" appears all of the sudden, financed almost
entirely by one of the top donors to people like Tom DeLay, is quite
suspicious. Don't you think that if these men that were so "haunted" by
Kerry's actions, they would have said something back then--especially
after he returned home and became a vocal anti-war activist?

> It has been widely remarked during this campaign that John Kerry is a

So cautious that he enlisted to fight in Vietnam in the first place? So
cautious that he alienated many of his fellow soldiers by marching
alongside Jane Fonda when he returned home? He may be cautious when it
comes to delicate political matters (as are most politicians), but I
wouldn't go so far as to say that he was cautious enough to lie (which
is usually a pretty reckless thing to do) about his actions in Vietnam.

As I see it, it's the word of the men that served him against the word
of the men that didn't. If you honestly believe that all his comrades
are as partisan as the vets that Republican donors sought out to
discredit one of the thing about Kerry that the GOP fears the most, then
you're a very cynical person. Don't you think that it would be a lot
easier to find war supporters who would say anything to keep a Democrat
out of the White House than it would to make every living man that
served under Kerry lie about what happened?

Are you the guy that created acidtetris?! I used to play that.. Um..
Sober, yeah sober when I lived in Utah :) It might be a different version,
it would've been like 96 or 97 that I was playing it. 

Those games are all classics too, but what about Outlaw, Jumpman, Super
Pipeline, World Karate, Grogs Revenge, Wizard! , Spin Dizzy, Marble

I don't really care if Bush did coke (lots of Republicans do and did the 
white stuff:) or that he avoided service in Vietnam.  What disgusts me is 
that he presents himself on a carrier deck in a flight officer's uniform 
that he was afraid to wear in a war zone.

Length of combat tours in Vietnam varied greatly, and were in part 
determined on the number of times one was wounded.  I believe, though I 
haven't researched it, that more bronze and silver stars were awarded 
relative to the number of active duty personnel in Vietnam than in either 
WW II or Korea.

The allegations against Kerry in Vietnam are that he only served four 
months, hyped his heroism and didn't earn his medals, particularly his 
first Purple Heart, presumably because if you got three you could leave 
early. Think for a moment of that logic. He was cited for a Purple Heart on 
Dec. 2, 1968, at the beginning of his swift boat tour of duty, after he had 
volunteered three times: once for the Navy, then for duty in Vietnam and 
then to command a swift boat; those four months were his second tour of 
duty. Somehow these political hacks want you to believe he faked the first 
injury, figuring he could get two more Purple Hearts in those treacherous 
waters -- getting wounded, mind you, not killed -- and then get out.

And his evaluations:

October 19, 1967, evaluation from Captain Allen W. Slifer:
A top notch officer in every measurable trait. Intelligent, mature, and 
rich in educational background and experience, ENS Kerry is one of the 
finest young officers I have ever met and without question one of the most 
promising.

September 3, 1968, evaluation from Captain E.W. Harper, Jr.:
LTJG KERRY is an intelligent and competent young naval officer who has 
performed his duties in an excellent to outstanding manner.

December 18, 1969, evaluation from LCDR George M. Elliott:
In a combat environment often requiring independent, decisive action LTJG 
Kerry was unsurpassed. He constantly reviewed tactics and lessons learned 
in river operations and applied his experience at every opportunity. On one 
occasion while in tactical command of a three boat operation his units were 
taken under fire from ambush. LTJG Kerry rapidly assessed the situation and 
ordered his units to turn directly into the ambush. This decision resulted 
in routing the attackers with several enemy KIA.

LTJG Kerry emerges as the acknowledged leader in his peer group. His 
bearing and appearance are above reproach. He has of his own volition 
learned the Vietnamese language and is instrumental in the successful 
Vietnamese training program.

During the period of this report LTJG Kerry has been awarded the Silver 
Star medal, the Bronze Star medal, the Purple Heart medal (2nd and 3rd 
awards).

Evaluation co-signed by Joseph Streuli and George M. Elliott on January 28, 
1969, and March 17, 1969, respectively:
 exhibited all of the traits of an officer in a combat environment. He 
frequently exhibited a high sense of imagination and judgment in planning 
operations against the enemy in the Mekong Delta.

March 2, 1970 evaluation from Admiral Walter F. Schlech:
 one of the finest young officers with whom I have served in a long naval 
career.

--0-957532447-1092411467=:361
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

5 of the uk's hotest hard dance djs. this event is going to be at one of everyones favroite venues... for $20 you get in tonite and can also go to the other show, phase 2, the next night; thats right only $20 to see even more uk hard house headliners for 2 nites!!!
you will get 2 nights of partying with a total of 8 uk headliners and 4 national!!!
our goal is to bring the best for the scene.. this is a milestone for the sf hard dance and trance scene. be there as the story unfolds...

the full line-up is done, check it out...

Eufex - Birmingham, UK - Nukleuz, Vicious Circle, Honey Pot
The name Eufex might not ring a bell from the go for everyone, but he has been around since HardHouse was in its mere infancy. Strangely, he is by far THE most under rated producer that Hard Dance has ever seen. Sean Stanley is the force behind many brilliant releases on early HH labels such as Arriba & TYT as well as prominent labels Nukleuz, Vicious Circle, Honey Pot & his now defunct Ravage Records. He has also collaborated with Jay-B for classic releases like Hypnotica on Kaktai Records, the massive anthem Vacuum Packed on Pump, plus tracks on Chris Cs now defunct projects, Aztec & Nile. 
Even though Sean has awe-inspiring skills as a producer & engineer, releases on very reputable labels, an involvement in the scene spreading over many years & one of the most professional attitudes in the industry, there was never a massive following of his music. Somehow people were overlooking a genius. 
Sean shocked many when he decided to take a break and concentrate his energy elsewhere. However, he couldnt shelf his love for the genre and wrote more original tracks & remixes whilst also working with various artists outside of Hard Dance. Hes back in 2004 with two remixes on Scottish hard label Lit Up and he has a promising Live PA with a host of new material and remixes ready to unleash in the coming months. 
Please come out and help us welcome him for his first Inernational set and out of retirement!!!!

Banga Matt - London, UK - Arktik, Sketcha, DP, Nile
Banga has been a staple dj and producer in the massive London scene for quite some time now. With he unique approach to the hrad nrg sound he has gained support the world over.. Just coming off his tour of oz and new zealand Matt is going to touch down and blow the place up! 

Phil Able - London, UK - Antiworld, Smile, Cyberdog, D&A Music S.F.
After Phils massive 2 hour set at 4 the People last November we had to have him back Only now as a resident for D&A. For those who were at 4 the People know what is in store as there is still a buzz about his set, dont miss out this time..
 
Nicki S - London, UK - Endophin, Quality Trax
Nicki is a dj who means bussiness. her hard tech sounds have gained her fame all over the UK clubs. 

Little Miss Natalie - Manchester, UK - Fist
This fireball from the north brings it hard and fast.. No mercy is the name of the game here.. with recent tracks with none other than the Testube Babies, she is no joke. SF need to propare to for an onslaught of the hardest upfornt and classic dark nrg sounds...

i would totally go to this if i wasn't playing at Mighty.  modified and ill

and in some of the most unique venues ever.

i'd consider driving over after Mighty....but friday is my birthday and i'm 
absolutely positive i'll be too trashed to do anything more than sit at a 45

Avid Technology acquires M-Audio

Fri Aug 13, 9:39 AM ET

By Peter Cohen, MacCentral

Avid Technology Inc. on Friday announced plans to acquire Midiman Inc., 
doing business as M-Audio. The deal is valued at US$80 million in cash plus 
two million shares of Avid common stock and the assumption of all 
outstanding M-Audio stock options, worth approximately another 325,000 
shares of Avid stock.

Avid Technology Inc. is best known for their development and manufacture of 
video editing hardware and software, but the company also owns Digidesign, 
a maker of professional digital audio production systems used in music, 
broadcast, multimedia and film, and SoftImage, a developer of 
professional-grade 3D animation, 2D cel animation, compositing and special 
effects software. M-Audio manufactures audio hardware and develops audio 
software for professional and consumer markets in both the Mac and PC space.

Avid indicated that M-Audio will become a business unit of Digidesign, 
where it will continue to market its line of peripherals, sound cards, 
keyboard controllers and other products alongside Digidesign's own. Avid 
President and CEO David Krall said that the acquisition will help his 
company bolster its investment in the home studio market segment, which he 
called "the fastest growing portion of our audio business, where we 
achieved roughly 40 percent year-over-year growth in Q2 of 2004."

The deal has already been approved by the boards of directors of both 
companies and has received antitrust clearance; it is expected to close 
before the end of August.

"I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes 
me to tremble for the safety of my country.  As a result of the war, 
corporations have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places 
will follow, and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong 
its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth is 
aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed."
-Abraham Lincoln

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become

hello, this is a continuation of a fictional piece:

shockingly enough, with all of the beautiful,
humanitarian people there are in the world, ig won an
impromptu beauty contest and a gift certificate for
$20.00 at one of the local bookstore cafes on friday

for the photo shoot. :)

this time? Hmm...

	I don't know. Maybe being drafted seemed less risky at the time =
than=20
trying to evade the draft. Cautious or not, marching alongside Jane=20
Fonda and testifying in Congress after leaving Vietnam made Kerry=20
famous and launched his political career. This appears to have been a=20
calculated move, tantamount to a lie. =46rom=20
http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1067104/posts :

Kerry did not return from Vietnam a radical antiwar activist. According=20=

to the indispensable Stolen Valor, by H. G. "Jug" Burkett and Genna=20
Whitley, "Friends said that when Kerry first began talking about=20
running for office, he was not visibly agitated about the Vietnam War.=20=

'I thought of him as a rather normal vet,' a friend said to a reporter,=20=

'glad to be out but not terribly uptight about the war.' Another=20
acquaintance who talked to Kerry about his political ambitions called=20
him a 'very charismatic fellow looking for a good issue.'" Apparently,=20=

this good issue would be Vietnam...

...Kerry testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. His=20
speech, touted as a spontaneous rhetorical endeavor, was a tour de=20
force, convincing many Americans that their country had indeed waged a=20=

merciless and immoral war in Vietnam. It was particularly powerful=20
because Kerry did not fit the antiwar-protester mold =97 he was no=20
scruffy, wide-eyed hippie. He was instead the best that America had to=20=

offer. He was, according to Burkett and Whitley, the "All-American boy,=20=

mentally twisted by being asked to do terrible things, then abandoned=20
by his government."

Today, Sen. Kerry appeals to veterans in his quest for the White House.=20=

He invokes his Vietnam service at every turn. But an honest,=20
enterprising reporter should ask Sen. Kerry this: Were you lying in=20
1971 or are you lying now? We do know that his speech was not the=20
spontaneous, emotional, from-the-heart offering that he suggested it=20
was. Burkett and Whitley report that instead, "it had been carefully=20
crafted by a speech writer for Robert Kennedy named Adam Walinsky, who=20=

also tutored him on how to present it."

But the issue goes far beyond theatrics. If he believes his 1971=20
indictment of his country and his fellow veterans was true, then he=20
couldn't possibly be proud of his Vietnam service. Who can be proud of=20=

committing war crimes of the sort that Kerry recounted in his 1971=20
testimony? But if he is proud of his service today, perhaps it is=20
because he always knew that his indictment in 1971 was a piece of=20
political theater that he, an aspiring politician, exploited merely as=20=

a "good issue." If the latter is true, he should apologize to every=20
veteran of that war for slandering them to advance his political=20
fortunes.

	Another piece, from=20
http://frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=3D11940 that calls=20=

Kerry's honesty into question:

John Kerry has told audiences that he =93once refused a direct order =
from=20
a far-away commander to open fire on a group of Vietnamese civilians=20
standing alongside a riverbank in the Mekong,=94 wrote unabashed Kerry=20=

supporter Joe Shea in the January 21, 2004, issue of The American=20
Reporter.

=93When [Kerry] got back to base, facing the threat of a court martial,=94=
=20
writes Shea, =93he defended himself with a tattered copy of the Rules of=20=

Engagement he kept handy in his hip pocket. He knew the rules, and he=20
won the day."

Put aside the fact that these Rules of Engagement were always changing,=20=

and that many believe these often-bizarre and arbitrary bureaucratic=20
restrictions on where, when and how our troops could fight were the=20
reason America lost in Vietnam.

If we take Kerry=92s story as true, we then face questions Shea =
neglected=20
to raise. Did not these rules that Kerry knew by heart also require a=20
soldier to report war crimes, or attempted war crimes, by others? Did=20
Kerry report this officer=92s illegal order to kill civilians to=20
superiors? =A0Or did Kerry remain silent, thereby becoming this =
officer=92s=20
ally and enabler, if not accomplice? =A0

If this story is true, then I hereby ask Senator Kerry to name the=20
officer who issued this illegal order and the officers before whom he=20
defended with that tattered rule book his refusal to obey it. =A0Surely =
a=20
memory so indelible as to play a role in young Kerry=92s anti-war=20
speeches can also recall the name of this officer who ordered him to=20
slaughter innocent civilians. (If 60-year-old Kerry=92s memory is now=20
failing, of course, this is evidence that he may have lost the mental=20
acuity to be President.)

The same questions could be asked about all the other routine=20
atrocities young Kerry alleged before a Senate committee. If he had=20
firsthand knowledge from witnessing who did these illegal things, why=20
did Kerry fail to turn in the criminals in accord with the Rules of=20
Engagement? =A0If he shielded those whose war crimes he witnessed, Kerry=20=

is an accomplice after the fact to these atrocities.

On the other hand, if his knowledge was only secondhand gossip, rumor=20
or intoxicated tales told by bored soldiers around jungle campfires =96=20=

what the law calls hearsay evidence =96 then Kerry was reckless,=20
irresponsible and almost treasonous to make such outrageous claims=20
under oath before the Senate, the press and the American people.

	Exactly. Men who might allow personal loyalty, or their own =
complicity=20
in what Kerry did, to keep them from telling the truth, versus men who=20=

were witness to incidents without being personally connected to Kerry=20
in the chain of command. Whose word is more reliable?

	I don't know. But I'd love to see the whole lot of them, for and=20=

Cannabis extract makes brain tumors shrink, halts growth of blood vessels

15 Aug 2004, Medical News

Researchers in Spain have discovered that a cannabis extract makes brain 
tumors shrink by halting the growth of blood vessels that supply the tumors 
with life. Cannabis has chemicals called cannabinoids, these are the 
chemicals that could effectively starve tumors to death, say the researchers.

The study was carried out at the Complutense University, Madrid, Spain.

The team used mice to demonstrate that the cannabinoids block vessel growth.

You can read about this latest research in the journal Cancer Research.

Apparently, the procedure is also effective in humans.

The Spanish team, led by Dr Manuel Guzmán, wanted to see whether they could 
prevent glioblastoma multiforme cancer from growing by cutting off its 
blood supply. Glioblastoma multiforme is one of the most difficult cancers 
to treat  it seldom responds to any medical intervention, such as 
radiotherapy, chemotherapy and surgery.

The scientists knew that cannabinoids will block the growth of blood 
vessels (to tumors) in mice  they wanted to find out whether the same 
thing would happen with humans.

The mice were given a cancer similar to the human brain cancer 
(glioblastoma multiforme). The mice were then given cannabinoids and the 
genes examined.

The genes associated with blood vessel growth in tumors through the 
production of a chemical called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 
had their activity reduced.

Cannabinoids halt VEGF production by producing Ceramide. Ceramide controls 
cell death.

Dr Guzmán said: "As far as we know, this is the first report showing that 
ceramide depresses VEGF pathway by interfering with VEGF production."

They then wanted to see if this would also happen with humans.

They selected two patients who had glioblastoma multiforme and had not 
responded to chemotherapy, radiotherapy or surgery. The scientists took 
samples from them before and after treating them with a cannabinoids 
solution  this was administered directly into the tumor.

Amazingly, both patients experienced reduced VEGF levels in the tumor as a 
result of treatment with cannabinoids.

The researchers said that the results were encouraging. In order to be sure 
about their findings they need to carry out a larger study, they said.

Dr Guzmán said "The present findings provide a novel pharmacological target 
for cannabinoid-based therapies."

So would I. Now here's how I look at it, and I'm wondering what your
opinion is from this perspective: knowing what you know about how *both*
parties work in an election year, don't you think that if the
Republicans had some confidence in the testimony of the "Swiftboat
Veterans for Truth", they would support them more directly? I just find
it really hard to believe that they wouldn't use this issue to its
fullest political advantage if they really believed it were true.
They've certainly stood behind much shakier issues in the past. 

As far as whether or not Kerry's whole tour of duty in Vietnam was just
a political move, that's a load of bullshit. Nobody volunteered for
potentially fatal swiftboat missions on the Mekong Delta as part of a
career move unless they were looking for a career in the military (which
Kerry obviously wasn't, if you believe everything you quoted in your
previous message).

Cheers,

The real issue isn't how Kerry performed in Vietman.  The real issue
isn't where Bush was for his National Guard service.  The real issue
isn't whether or not Kerry would have gone to war in Iraq knowing
what he knows today.

No, the real issue, that nobody seems to be asking, is, how well did
Bush execute the war in Iraq?  The real issue is how many broken
promised Bush made about the war.  (How long it would last, how much
it would cost, how many troops would be needed, ect)

I think he has failed miserably.  And becuase of it, I think he should
be fired.

All this Kerry vietnam stuff is just a distraction from Bush's huge
failures.

Subject: [sfraves] Tiesto @ Opening Ceremony of the Olympics

2 hour DJ set. I missed it, did anyone see it, comments???

This post on tranceaddict.com conveys my feelings about this:

"Originally posted by Ground_0=20

I think what Tiesto did was amazing! Not what songs he played, or how
good/bad his skills were, but at work today and even a little yesterday,
people were asking me questions. They know I do my dj thing and enjoy
trance music, but most of them (No matter how many cds I give them) dont
have a way to experience the good stuff, the stuff that isin't played on
the radio here. So back to my point, they were all asking questions
about the songs, the dj, the way it works. These people have never had a
"Trance Experience" in their life, but as tiesto played his songs in the
backround of the ceremonies, they had that experience. And aperently
they liked it too, and these are people from many cultures, ages,
religion and beliefs.=20

One way or another it doesn't matter how well he did, because he did as
well as he had to. The international exposure to trance has just BLOWN
up and maybe you all can't see that yet, but I saw it first hand when I
went to work today.

Cheers Tiesto!!! I'll admit that you fuk up just like all the rest of
em, but you do a damn good job of spreading the lovely music to people
who would otherwise not experience it. You just opened the biggest door
for trance in general, I beleive, that may have ever been opened."

I'll post up a link to a video when I can find one.

Watched the whole thing - completely lackluster. Some of the more
"ethnically influenced" tracks he played were kind of cool - but other than
that, it was nothing exciting.

The light show was pretty sick tho...especially the DNA Double Helix
thingy....that was tight.

Hi Apollo,

Any reason in particular you are posting this news? I saw it on my stock
watch on Friday. I'm interested on any thoughts on this, especially
since I work for Pinnacle Systems/Steinberg.

Thanks,

Avid Technology acquires M-Audio

Fri Aug 13, 9:39 AM ET

By Peter Cohen, MacCentral

Avid Technology Inc. on Friday announced plans to acquire Midiman Inc.,=20

plus=20
two million shares of Avid common stock and the assumption of all=20
outstanding M-Audio stock options, worth approximately another 325,000=20
shares of Avid stock.

Avid Technology Inc. is best known for their development and manufacture

video editing hardware and software, but the company also owns
Digidesign,=20
a maker of professional digital audio production systems used in music,=20
broadcast, multimedia and film, and SoftImage, a developer of=20
professional-grade 3D animation, 2D cel animation, compositing and
special=20
effects software. M-Audio manufactures audio hardware and develops audio

software for professional and consumer markets in both the Mac and PC
space.

Avid indicated that M-Audio will become a business unit of Digidesign,=20
where it will continue to market its line of peripherals, sound cards,=20
keyboard controllers and other products alongside Digidesign's own. Avid

President and CEO David Krall said that the acquisition will help his=20
company bolster its investment in the home studio market segment, which
he=20
called "the fastest growing portion of our audio business, where we=20
achieved roughly 40 percent year-over-year growth in Q2 of 2004."

The deal has already been approved by the boards of directors of both=20
companies and has received antitrust clearance; it is expected to close=20
before the end of August.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Re: Kerry & Vietnam (long NRR)

Kerry supporters: please read "Dude Where's My Country?" by Michael
Moore. you will discover statistical evidence that the majority of the
country is more liberal than either Bush or Kerry.

any Bush supporter who draws you into a debate of Kerry vs. Bush is
wasting your time and tricking you with a deceptive time-wasting
tactic. the real issue is not Kerry vs. Bush. the real issue is voting
vs. not voting.

the majority of potential voters in this country are more liberal than
either candidate. however, the majority of potential voters in this
country do not actually vote.

this is why Bush led immediately with negative campaigning -- he knew
that the more people there were who felt so disgusted with politics in
general that they didn't even want to vote, the better his chances of
winning. this is also the reason for this Vietnam smear campaign. the
dirtier the tricks, the worse **each** candidate looks, and the less
motivated the average potential voter is to actually vote.

please realize that the smartest thing to do is motivate people to
vote. ignore arguments in favor of Bush, they are not worth your time.
we need to get non-voters to vote. if we do that, we win.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Tiesto @ Opening Ceremony of the Olympics

ugggh... I thought Trance **Already** blew up??

When you see it in Movies,Commercials,on the PA system when your shopping at 
Albertsons (Yes I did hear  some Electronic music while shopping for dinner) 
Just about every hip ad agency is promoting it, you can catch it on MTV. 
Sorry my friend your a bit late!  ;)

Now if there was a Trance olympic competition then I think ya might have 
something there..

But cheers for Trancey pants tiesto!

i dunno, somebody had me watch a bunch of Ali G the other night and yeah i  
"get it" but I don't really find him all that funny. It's a good schtick at  
first but so repetitive. He uses the same questions on different guests. It's  
the same thing:  get some establishment guys on there and ask them  embarassing 
questions, using slang that they don't know is insulting.  
 
I mean, he's ok ... if he was a recurring character on Saturday Night Live  I 
could see it, but i don't find him some major talent. Yeah i know he's an  
actor who has other roles. This role is, um, he's an English Arab who tries to  
act like an American rapper, but talks with a Jamaican accent?  Sure, there  
are people in England who are just like that, but the joke wears thin fast. I'd 
 rather put the same people on there and grill them about their thoughts and  
policies, not just call them "bellends" (penis ends) and childish stuff like  
that. It's not clever. 
 
yeah go ahead and throw tomatoes ... i could use a salad.

He's not an English Arab - far from it!  He is a half English/half 
Isreali Jew.

Also, he did start off Ali G as a recurring character on the 11 O'clock 
show (an English satirical news/sketch show) probably 4 or 5 years ago.

I'll get back to my lurking now, Aiiii! :)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Avid Technology acquires M-Audio

Myabe Digidesign is opening up ProTools to non-Digidesign hardware? I
think they'll at least make ProTools lE compatible with the M-Audio
profolio, which makes the M-Audio line of I/O products even more
versatile.

It might also be a sign of them moving away form TDM hardware.

Or better yet, maybe now M-audio will wait until their drivers are finished
before they release hardware...

Or, all M-audio products will only work on Protools!

I thought it was tacky and pathetic display for something as respectable as
the Olympic opening ceremonies. Jeans and a fucking t-shirt. This isn't a
club - it's the Olympics. Look at other opening cermonies and the effort
that goes into them. To me this just conveyed that *you're in Greece - let's
party!*

On the otherhand Bjork was more appropriate. She's never one to let you down
with her stage performances.

2 hour DJ set. I missed it, did anyone see it, comments???

This post on tranceaddict.com conveys my feelings about this:

"Originally posted by Ground_0

I think what Tiesto did was amazing! Not what songs he played, or how
good/bad his skills were, but at work today and even a little yesterday,
people were asking me questions. They know I do my dj thing and enjoy
trance music, but most of them (No matter how many cds I give them) dont
have a way to experience the good stuff, the stuff that isin't played on
the radio here. So back to my point, they were all asking questions
about the songs, the dj, the way it works. These people have never had a
"Trance Experience" in their life, but as tiesto played his songs in the
backround of the ceremonies, they had that experience. And aperently
they liked it too, and these are people from many cultures, ages,
religion and beliefs.

One way or another it doesn't matter how well he did, because he did as
well as he had to. The international exposure to trance has just BLOWN
up and maybe you all can't see that yet, but I saw it first hand when I
went to work today.

Cheers Tiesto!!! I'll admit that you fuk up just like all the rest of
em, but you do a damn good job of spreading the lovely music to people
who would otherwise not experience it. You just opened the biggest door
for trance in general, I beleive, that may have ever been opened."

I'll post up a link to a video when I can find one.

	Well, look what happened when the Republicans tried to remove 
President Clinton from office. The Democrats refused to do more than 
impeach him, and the public got the idea through the media that it was 
just a lot of partisan mudslinging. In fact there was abundant evidence 
that Clinton perjured himself, and encouraged his secretary Betty 
Currie and possibly his friend Vernon Jordan to perjure themselves on 
his behalf. He improperly got his then-girlfriend Gennifer Flowers a 
state job when he was Arkansas governor, bumping a more qualified black 
woman who was in line for it. He used Arkansas state troopers to drive 
him around and cover for him on his private liaisons. He used political 
influence to dodge the draft. Juanita Broaddrick credibly accused him 
of raping her at a nursing conference. There were a number of 
suspicious deaths, including those of White House counsel Vince Foster, 
former White House intern Mary Mahoney, former Clinton chief of 
security Jerry Parks, former Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, etc. And 
there was much, much more. Of course those latter things were not even 
touched by Congressional Republicans or the Bush campaign with a 
ten-foot pole, but they certainly could have been used, had there been 
a desire to report the truth, or to "use this issue to its fullest 
political advantage," as you put it.

	Given how even the limited stuff they did bring up in Clinton's case 
came back to bite them politically, it's not surprising that most of 
the Republicans are gun-shy and don't want to get involved with the 
Swift Boat veterans' claims.

	I never said Kerry's entire time in Vietnam was a political move, but 
then again I don't discount the possibility that building a political 
career may have been a factor in his decision, even a primary one. Why 
do *you* think he went to Vietnam? Because he loved America so much? 
Because he believed in fighting communism? As previously noted in this 
thread, Kerry apparently did not deliberately volunteer for a dangerous 
Swift Boat mission -- he volunteered for what was one of the safest 
jobs in Vietnam, and the mission got switched two weeks later.

Peace, love & liberty,

I don't think either of us is qualified to speculate anyone's reasons
for enlisting in the armed forces.

"Apparently" is the important word here--it's also silly for us to
speculate whether or not swift boat duty was as "dangerous" as anyone
(let alone Kerry) expected it to be at the time. Like Troy Sheets said,
I don't think this discussion's even worth debating anymore. I could
personally give two shits about what Kerry did in Vietnam; the fact of
the matter is that he went, and most other politicians didn't. I'm done
with this thread.

1. Huh.. non buggy software from Digi?

2. Probably.  Albeit Avid is the larger parent company I understand 
Digidesign itself to be valued in the $100 mil range before this 
acquisition.. This acquisition of M-Audio seems more like a buyout / 
protection maneuver on the surface at least. Despite what one thinks of 
M-Audio/Midiman gear (Digi gear/hardware ain't that much more pimp either) 
they have been gaining strong brand recognition and more in the market 
consistently through the years. Poof...

I'd say this is a narrowing of options available on the audio scene and not 
an expansion.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Spirit of Raving Archives: Q2-2004: What most drew you to the underground scene?

Well, I noticed that the drugs were far higher grade in the UG than
elsewhere.  hehehehe, just kidding :)

Hmm, well, I had come out of the rock scene, having been in bands for
years, and I was sick of the people in that scene- everybody always
trying to out-cool one another, trying to do as little work as
possible, and plans just never worked out quite right.  There was a lot
of inter-band rivalry and the venues just weren't good folks to deal
with.  The crowds were violent and hell, being in bands just sucks
sometimes, especially if you have a certain vision of what you want the
music to sound like and can't find a group of people that shares that
vision 100%.

So I started making dance music in about '96/97, after being hipped to
it by acts like Everything But The Girl and 'electronica' groups like
the Prodigy, Chemical Brothers, and Daft Punk.  I was totally outside
of the rave scene, living in Santa Cruz.  I didn't know a single raver.
 My first really great rave was CF NYE 99 (or 2000?).  I was struck by
the vibe, the friendly people, the mindblowing music, the in-depth
preparation and amazing setup of the venue.  The mystique of map points
and sneaking around into clandestine warehouse venues helped too, this
was something really exciting.

I was hooked big time. :)  Been a ravah ever since.  The funny thing
was, because I went straight from "MTV electronica" music into the deep
underground, I never had a trance/nrg period like most other ravers of
my era did.  *whew*, sidestepped that one!  ;)

For me it wasn't any one particular thing.  It was a combination of the

it=92s a rarity finding these three elements together outside of the

This week be sure to TUNE IN and TUNE OUT your boss, because Koroma^s
going to be dropping by An Epiphany Of Sound and spinning tracks from
his yester years. SOOO if you think ya know him, you should have the 411
on to what to expect.  And if you don't have a clue, then tune in anyway
and find out!

I'll give ya one hit.  There ain't gonna be no love songs comin your
way!  And as has been said before, BAM!  (But that's two hints.)

So if you hate your job, moon your boss and crank 90.1 FM up REALLY
loud.  If not, put on the headphones and listen in.

You know the deal; 90.1 FM on the dial, and online at
http://kzsulive.stanford.edu from 9a-11a Pacific Time every Tues.

End transmission.

Subject: [sfraves] (NRR) Posting

This is the first time I have posted when I wasn't promoting something 
in a really, really long time. It's sad since this was my first home in 
the scene. It's where I met many of my longest raver friends. A big part 
of it, I know, is that I'm not online all day anymore, and my writing is 
divided among many communities now. It's not just SFR that I've been 
lurking in, it's Friendster, Tribe, Ravers For Peace, Whirlygig, 
NYC-Raves, blah blah blah. And now I spend so much time between music 
stuff and fire stuff, friends, family, work, everything else, writing 
has gotten squeezed out. Battery's dying

Troy,

	When it comes to actual policy issues, John Kerry voted in the Senate  
to authorize the invasion of Iraq. He has also said he wants to send  
40,000 more troops to Iraq. And he, like Ralph Nader, wants to bring  
more countries into the war effort -- but of course Bush has already  
been trying to do that. What would Kerry or Nader do differently than  
Bush to get other countries more involved? They're rather short on  
details. Did Kerry offer any detailed advice at the time about how he  
thought the war should be executed that would have made a difference,  
or is he just playing Monday-morning quarterback?

	Meanwhile, Michael Badnarik of the Libertarian Party and David Cobb of  
the Green Party are the only major anti-war candidates. Both of them  
would withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq.

For liberty,
				<<< Starchild >>>

P.S. - Did you complain about Clinton's broken promises* on how long  
the U.S. intervention in Bosnia would last, how much it would cost,  
etc.? Or is this just a partisan anti-Bush thing?

*"...the Clinton Administration set a twelve-month deadline for U.S.  
troops in Bosnia as it was selling the mission to Congress and the  
American people. President Clinton, Secretary of State Christopher,  
Secretary of Defense Perry, National Security Advisor Lake, and  
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General Shalikashvili all assured Congress  
and the public that it was a twelve-month job. There were very early  
rumblings that this deadline wouldn't stick, but the one-year limit  
remained the Administration's official policy for eleven months. Days  
after winning re-election and with only one month to go before the  
deadline, President Clinton announced on 15 November 1996 that the U.S.  
would stay in Bosnia past the established deadline. He indicated U.S.  
willingness to participate in a stabilization force that would enable  
the ongoing reconstruction efforts. However, he again limited the U.S.  
commitment -- this time it was an additional eighteen months. This new  
time limit for participation in NATO's stabilization force (SFOR) again  
played a key role in securing congressional acquiescence. In the summer  
of 1997 the House expressed its frustration with the lingering Bosnia  
mission and voted to cut off funds for U.S. peacekeepers at the new  
deadline -- 30 June 1998. The Senate didn't mandate a cutoff of funds,  
but did adopt a nonbinding resolution, expressing their expectation  
that the president honor this second deadline. In the end, the Senate  
view prevailed; funds would not be cut off but they expected a June  
1998 end to the Bosnia mission. But the Senate's expectation was not  
met -- the president announced in mid-December 1997 that the troops  
would stay past the 30 June 1998 deadline. Senator John McCain said, 'I  
certainly hope they don't insult our intelligence again with another  
date certain [sic -- meaning another deadline].' They didn't; the  
president offered no new time limits on U.S. participation."

How many Americans were killed in Bosnia?  How much did it cost?  Did
we work effeciently and share the burden with our allies?  Were we able 
to exit?

You cannot compare bosnia to iraq.

I agree with JBlaze. Out of all the democrats in the primary, Kerry was the  
one i favored the least (except for Lieberman, who is to his right), but I do  
feel we have a responsibility to put him in office and make bush go back to  
Crawford, Texas, where he will finally have the time to finish reading "My  
Little Goat" (see Fahrenheit 9/11).   

Yes, Starchild, Kerry  may really be "more of the same" and he's more 
conservative than I like. He  wouldn't represent major change from traditional US 
policy -- but he's not  George Bush. Maybe Kerry would be just a tool of the 
power structure, like any  other president we've had (except maybe Carter), but I 
feel that he at  least wants our system to continue, unlike Bush, who seems to 
want to run it  into the ground for how own personal gain and that of his 
friends. 
 
I'm wondering why Libertarians and other 3rd party candidates don't  
concentrate more on the local and regional level. I think they would get more  support 
if their efforts concentrated on the bottom and working up, rather than  at 
the top. School boards, rent boards, county supervisors, city councilmembers.  
After all, San Francisco came very close to having a Green mayor. That would  
build up the party, and they wouldn't be seen as mere spoilers or vanity  
candidates (like Nader). 
 
I had the pleasure of meeting Jim Gray, the Libertarian candidate for  
Senator. What an intelligent guy. He makes so much sense, and it would be great  to 
have him in office. But he's running against Barbara Boxer, and sorry Mr.  
Gray, but Senate seats are at a premium, and I don't want to hand Boxer's seat  
to her Republican opponent. 
 
In the last state general election, I voted for the Green candidate, Peter  
Camejo, over Gray Davis, but when the recall vote came up, I voted to keep 
Davis  because I didn't want the Republicans to gain momentum in their push for an 
 eventual  Schwarzenegger presidency. 
 
I realize that the 3rd party candidates won't be viable unless they're  
treated seriously and get media attention. It's a Catch 22. But until they're  
truly viable, they're going to be used as TOOLS by the Republican establishment.  
I saw on CNN the techniques used by Republicans to get people to vote for 
Nader  and it's truly disgusting. (Yes I know Nader isn't the Libertarian 
candidate,  but you can be sure that if Libertarian Michael Badnarik was going to get 
a  decent amount of votes, Republicans would be doing the same thing for  him.)
 
Judge Gray explained how, if Thomas Jefferson were here today, his views  
would be seen as Libertarian. Can we clone Jefferson? I'd vote for Jefferson  
over Kerry. Jefferson has name recognition. He would have a chance. Any  other 
3rd party candidate: I'd say, start at the bottom and build up. Don't be a  tool 
of the Bush/Cheney Empire. If a 3rd party wants to go for the gold, pick  
somebody who is already a big name.  What if Schwarzenegger ran as a 3rd  party 
candidate? Or John Mc Cain? They would have a fighting chance, but sorry,  
Michael Badnarik does not offer an alternative because nobody knows who he is.

Um, a huricane just destroyed Florida and you still think the Kyoto treaty
is a bad idea?  How much global-warming related damage will it take to
convince you people?  Maybe when Florida is under water...

here's something i posted to dcraves that night  :)

i don't know what he was wearing but i imagine it's what he usually wears
to dj ...

mary :)

          olympics              
                                


sorry in advance to those of you who don't like tiesto, but i have to say i
was proud tonight that tiesto represented our culture at the olympics.  i
don't think any other dj could have pulled it off as successfully as he did
tonight.  he is, after all, the only dj in the world i know of who has sold
out a 25,000-capacity soccer stadium with only him on the bill (he played
an event once with about 10 other djs and everyone entering was asked whom
they came to hear; out of 25,000 people, 20,000 said they came to hear him,
so he thought why not do a show just for the people who want to hear him,
and he sold out the soccer stadium himself)

also, he plays mostly his own music, so he's got an incredibly attractive
"brand" - he's got tons of people who identify strongly with his signature
sound.  even if i didn't like his music, which actually i do, i'd have to
give him due respect for being able to do what he does on a level that no
one else is.

as i was watching the olympians from around the world come out country by
country tonight, it occurred to me that though i didn't know when tiesto
was supposed to play, perhaps the most logical time for him to play would
be during the opening ceremony which goes on for a few hours, and sure
enough, when i listened closely, it certainly sounded like techno pounding
in the background.  =)

and then for a few seconds near the end of the procession, i heard a few
measures of his remix of samuel barber's "adagio for strings" and i was
like, bravo!  that's him!  tiesto's playing the set of his life!  and i was
so proud.  :)  watching some of the people clapping in time to techno
thrilled me.  :)

(i would have loved it even more if it had been drum n bass, but maybe the
next olympics. :)

anyhow, i was happy and proud for him and think he deserves to enjoy his
successes.  he was decorated by the queen of holland for his cultural
contributions to his country and he seemed deeply moved by that (i found
some pictures of him receiving a medal from the mayor of his hometown on
behalf of the queen when i googled him recently and he looked surprised and
visibly moved), and i was touched by his apparent sincerity.

i know everyone doesn't agree that it's cool that tiesto got to play the
olympics, but i have to say it made me proud and happy for edm in general.
:)

have a wonderful weekend, everyone!

respectfully,
mary m :)

I thought it was tacky and pathetic display for something as respectable as
the Olympic opening ceremonies. Jeans and a fucking t-shirt. This isn't a
club - it's the Olympics. Look at other opening cermonies and the effort
that goes into them. To me this just conveyed that *you're in Greece -
let's

On the otherhand Bjork was more appropriate. She's never one to let you

2 hour DJ set. I missed it, did anyone see it, comments???

This post on tranceaddict.com conveys my feelings about this:

"Originally posted by Ground_0

I think what Tiesto did was amazing! Not what songs he played, or how
good/bad his skills were, but at work today and even a little yesterday,
people were asking me questions. They know I do my dj thing and enjoy
trance music, but most of them (No matter how many cds I give them) dont
have a way to experience the good stuff, the stuff that isin't played on
the radio here. So back to my point, they were all asking questions
about the songs, the dj, the way it works. These people have never had a
"Trance Experience" in their life, but as tiesto played his songs in the
backround of the ceremonies, they had that experience. And aperently
they liked it too, and these are people from many cultures, ages,
religion and beliefs.

One way or another it doesn't matter how well he did, because he did as
well as he had to. The international exposure to trance has just BLOWN
up and maybe you all can't see that yet, but I saw it first hand when I
went to work today.

Cheers Tiesto!!! I'll admit that you fuk up just like all the rest of
em, but you do a damn good job of spreading the lovely music to people
who would otherwise not experience it. You just opened the biggest door
for trance in general, I beleive, that may have ever been opened."

I'll post up a link to a video when I can find one.

For any of you laptop n****s out there...  Now that I've got me a super fancy laptop to run final scratch on...  I'm looking to get a PCMCIA soundcard so I can record while I'm playing.  I've already tested everything out and it all works great... except that the line in my laptop is retarded.  
 
Does anybody have any advice on what is the best solution to get a proper RCA in on a laptop.  I was looking at the Echo Indigo I/O but it looks a bit pricy for doing nothing but being able to record.  Does anybody have any experience with this card?  
 
More importantly does anybody have any other suggestions?  Obviously this is a niche market so its not like theres gonna be 100 different products to choose from.  All I need is a crystal clear RCA-in that isn't going to rob me of all my taco bell money.  I suppose a super-small USB thingy would work as well... does anybody have possible recommendations on that front?
 
It would be nice if I could get one that I could use cubase on and what not ...  but most importantly I need a high quality recording source.  I'm going to be playing .wav files from final scratch so I'd like to keep as much of that quality as I can....

I would stay away form PCMCIA stuff... buggy, easy to break, and I think

This Edirol unit sounds real nice:

Ah, the Kyoto Protocol. Pro-business wonks and climate change deniers
just *love* to bash that one. Here's the full text of the Protocol, if
you'd care to read it:

<http://unfccc.int/cop4/resource/docs/cop3/l07a01.pdf>

But here's a paraphrasing of some of the goals outlined in Article 2:

- reducing emissions
- enhancing energy efficiency
- promoting sustainable development in forest management, agriculture
- promoting research, development, and increased use of new and
  renewable forms of energy
- eliminating subsidies of greenhouse gas emitting financial sectors
- limiting and reducing methane in waste management

124 countries have pledged to pursue these goals, many of which are
as equally developed as the US but not nearly as wealthy. If they can
afford to reduce their environmental impact, so can we. It's our moral
obligation to the earth as a producer of some 36% of the world's
man-made pollution.

Furthermore, climate change isn't theoretical; it's happening more
rapidly now that it's ever happened in the earth's history, and in
direct proportion to the rate of industrialization. There is much more
evidence pointing to the effects of greenhouse gas emissions than there
is to "cosmic rays", or periodic global climate change cycles. The
overwhelming majority of scientists that agree with the conclusions of
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (on which the Kyoto
Protocol is based) aren't angry leftist hippies--they're *scientists*
that have based their findings on decades of rigorous study. I really
think you'd have to have at least a few screws loose to conclude, in the
face of their body of evidence, that the short-term financial wellbeing
of national industry is more important than the long-term sustainability
of the earth's environment.

There's something missing from the Libertarian party platform though.
What's more important to me than *fiscal* responsibility and social
*tolerance* is *social responsibility*. Government exists for more than
operational logistics; it exists to help its citizens. But free markets
and social responsibility are diametrically opposed. And when
politicians put the needs of corporations above those of their
constituency--which goes above and beyond the call of free market
economics--you can just forget about "responsibility" altogether.
Libetrarians should want Bush out of the white house just as much as
anyone else, if not for his egregious attacks on civil liberties, then
for his agricultural subsidies and import tariffs.

I know we've had this discussion before, but governmental regulation
exists (as a philosophy, not necessarily in practice) to protect people
from the effects of corporations that will do anything to make a buck.
Taxes exist (in part) to fund public services that protect people from
criminals and save them during emergencies, and social programs that
help people cope with everything from physical and mental illness to job
loss. Libertarians and Republicans alike prefer to slash taxes (and in
the case of Republicans, only for the rich) because they think that the
free market can provide all those things. But let me say this: no
corporation that's ultimately responsible to shareholders is fit to run
essential public services or social programs. Government programs are
allowed to run at a loss so that they won't have to stop providing;
corporations don't have that luxury. Obviously the federal beuracracy is
way out of hand, but there are better places to cut corners than, for
instance, unemployment benefits, housing programs, veteran care, and
middle class tax relief (all targets of the Republican Congress and
Bush's pen).

I may very well end up voting for David Cobb if I know that my vote
won't matter in California. But if this election is anywhere near as
close as 2000's, I won't hesitate to vote for Kerry. As a freelance web
developer, I find it difficult to pay for health insurance. I like
Kerry's plan to repeal Bush's tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, and
use that money to fund a national healthcare program that covers people
like me. I like that he's fought pretty consistently for progressive
causes during his 18 years as a Senator. (He is, after all, "the most
liberal senator," which isn't saying much.) He's got a lifetime's more
experience than George Bush, and he has more international perspective
WRT everything from the economy to terrorism as a member of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee. If there's one thing that can be said of
John Kerry, it's that he's one of the few politicians capable of
learning from experience. Republicans point to his changes in position
as "flip-flopping", but their own immutable stances, in the face of even
the most overwhelming evidence to the contrary, are their greatest
weakness. I don't want a leader with resolve to the point of being
stubborn or stupid; I want one that can compromise for the common good
and own up to his or her mistakes. The responsibility of the President
is to govern according to the wishes of the entire electorate, not just
the people that voted for him. Doing so requires the ability to
compromise, of which Bush is wholly incapable.

I really do think that this Bush will go down as one of the worst
presidents in our nation's history. And if he's re-elected on November
2nd because the general population is too ignorant to realize what he's
done to our country economically and socially, and how much the rest of
the world hates us because of his hair-brained policies, then I'm
getting the fuck out of here. I'm disgusted with our national lust for
huge things, from triple cheeseburgers to gas-guzzling Hummers. I'm sick
of the ethnic and racial divides that fester as a result of mutual
disrespect and cultural intolerance. I'm sick of religious
fundamentalism, the rejection of science, and the pervasiveness of
ideology in government. Nobody's practical anymore, nobody's willing to
compromise, everything is either black or white... but that isn't the
way the world works! Nations aren't "good" or "evil"; religious texts
aren't literal transcriptions dictating every facet of life; free
markets can't provide everything that everyone in society needs.

We can do much better than this. As the world's wealthiest and most
powerful nation, we could combat hunger, homelessness and disease in our
own country as well as abroad. We have the ability to develop renewable
energy sources that will power the technological revolution without
destroying the environment. We could even stop giving the Islamic world
reasons for wanting to kill us. But none of that will happen as long as
Bush is in the white house, because all he cares about is whether or not
he and his friends have gobs and gobs of money. These may not be the
highest priorities of the Democratic party either, but Libertarians
certainly won't go for it because social responsibility is inherently
inefficient. So until it's "safe" to vote Green, I'm voting Democrat.
It's simply a practical, intelligent compromise, given the alternatives.

Cheers,

I strongly agree.  We've had some weak presidents, and some who had  pretty 
bad scandals, but I can't think of anyone who has done so much to injure  his 
own country.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Spirit of Raving Archives: Q2-2004: What most drew you to the underground scene?

This a story of my first party I posted a few months
back. 

One of many great experiences was the first party I
went to. 

I never liked the bar scene or drinking. I ran around
with a 2 foot mowhawk; pitting at punk shows and punk
rallies was my thing. 70's-80's. The punk thing got to
main stream for me and I hung low for a while. Cut my
hawk. Hiked around and rode my bike. Got back into
other things. One day my roomies asked me to go to a
rally in Sacramento on the capital step for a
demonstration, there were decks set up and DJ's
spinning. The music was called techno. I have old
records from back in the day and the funny thing is
that some techo sounded like house, some sounded like
drum and bass, some sounded like trace, breaks, acid
house, but back then it was called techno. As far as I
knew anyway.

After the demonstration my roomies said there was a
break-in warehouse party. Whatever the hell that
means. What is there to do in a warehouse? My
curiosity was peaked. I was into anything new and
different than the proposed norm. 

At this point in my life the only experience with
drugs was knowing that my hippy parents did so many
that I was turned off to the idea. You never want to
be like your parents right? When I was a tike mom told
me that if I ever wanted to try anything ever she
would get a hold of it and we could do it together.
"I've tried it all" she said. Boy that sounds like
fun. I had a few drinks over the years but didn't like
to drink. Clove and menthol cigs was all, what was I
thinking... Smoked reef a couple times but wasn't into
it back then.  

So we go to some dark ass ally in some sketch
neighborhood just outside of downtown sac. I start to
hear this low thump, thump, thump, thump, thump,
thump... We drive past, find a place to park. Walk up
to the warehouse, no line, no fee, no one even
watching the door. Walk through a tunnel of black
sheets and BAM sweat all over the place. Wicked music,
people dancing, some half naked. The back door of the
warehouse was open and a cool breeze was cooling off
the dance floor which was the entire warehouse. The
only lights were a strobe and a black light, oh yeh
and a smoke machine. No alcohol. I loved it. People
getting on dancing, having a great time and there was
no booze.   
Wicked energy, I started dancing. Felt like I was out
of my body. The night went on, sweating, dancing,
hands in the air. I didn't care about time, the night
could have gone on forever and I wouldn't have
noticed. After a while I thought it would be good to
find my roomies. I had my shirt off from dancing, the
warehouse was like a sauna. I found my roomies. We
started chatting. Both my roomies have been to parties
before so we we talked about how great it was. A
beautiful girl/woman came up to me. She had this thing
in her hand that looked like saturn. A metal ball with
rings around it. She told me to put my hand on top of
the ball, her hand was on the button holding this
contraption. I put my hand on the orb, she ran her
finger from my sweaty chest down to my belt line then
back up around my neck, leaned in and kissed me. The
orb created an electric link to whatever part of our
bodies touched and causes a little muscle spasm that
felt like a tiny euphoric massage. My whole face lit
up. I was in ecstasy. She walked away. The night
finally came to an end. We went home. The beutiful
thing was, I never saw the girl again. There was no
reason to exchange information because we were both
sharing a moment that was only appropriate for that
time in space. I did not do drugs and didn't need any.
The music, people, energy and visuals kept me high. I
WAS HOOKED. 

This community for me has always been part of a life
that proceeds the normal. We are one step ahead. We
think ahead. We act ahead. We love each other. We
create our beautiful surroundings. We know what is
right and wrong without authority. 

=)

I imagine you can take out a loan for community college.

Do it...do it.

global warming contributes to the creation of more (and more

Subject: RE: [sfraves] tuition raised AGAIN

Tuition being raised is definitely a bad thing, but honestly, California
is still by far the best state for just about anyone to be able to get
an education in.  As a resident in Utah, the fee per credit hour is $194
and most students work jobs $7/hr and under since there is no work.  I
moved to California to get my resident status so I could go back to
school inexpensively... Although I failed in that by getting a corporate
job soon after moving here and getting to used to having money.  But now
I'm off back to school and I'm more than overjoyed to be in California
to get it.  A city with costs more like SF though still charges around
$120 a credit hour, like New York.  2 raises in 2 years is bad, I just
hope it doesn't show a continuing trend like this in California.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Re: Kerry, Bush, Environment

What would probably best describe global warming in terms of hurricanes
would be either more or less hurricanes than normal and abnormally high
hurricanes in the off season.
http://www.cpc.noaa.gov/products/outlooks/hurricane.html discusses in
depth hurricane activity current and historical.

Besides global warming, one of the things the Kyoto treaty is trying to
protect against is things like Hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico.
'http://www.nos.noaa.gov/products/pubs_hypox.html' Because of dumping in
the Mississippi river (not just stuff you'd consider bad like mercury,
lead and all the normal things that don't do a body good) but fertilizer
runoff etc.  After the flood season the river washes out a swath of
enriched water that causes algae to multiply so much that the water
becomes too heavily oxygenated and pushes all animal's in a 5000 sq mile
radius out of the area for a few months.  This has lead to higher shark
attacks along the coasts as well as forcing animals to find new habitats
in other area's.  While of course this study talks about the visiable
details, it makes sense that this much oxygen being released into the
lower atmosphere would also cause climate change in that area and as the
dead zone grows bigger each year may be a factor in speeding up the
swirling factor in tropical storms that may not have become a hurricane
without it.

Global warming is real.  I just think the term is badly used or not
explained easily enough for those who are not concerned about it in
their daily lives.  Its more than just a hotter winter or summer.  Its
about tidal change, higher water levels in both the ocean and the
atmosphere, changing climate maps that have been used for as long as
people lived in an area.  Shorter planting seasons, worse storms, longer
droughts.  The short term results could possibly be just as scary as
these 'catastrophic disasters' the movies predict.  With less salinated
water ocean fish, animals and plants start dying.  A marine eco-system
takes a lot longer to rebuild once its thrashed than one on land.  The
ocean covers 70% of our planet, most of our oxygen and storms come from
it.  For those that live costally in and outside the US a drop in fish,
or an increase in storms would be like a farmer having a drought as
their food and money supply is cut off.

It's important to care about environmental treaties, not because you're
a hippie or even because you drive an SUV.  Most environmental treaties
are looked at by the public as costing us too much money.  But what they
really focus on is private and publically held factories and companies
who get hassled less than a consumer on emissions.  I side with
libertarians on a lot of issues where government involvment really
isin't needed, but only in the case of private citizens.  I'm talking
about companies who only care about a bottom line, and find it cheaper
to pollute and pay a fine than to clean up their act.  This is when a
government works to protect its people in more ways than just
employment.  Companies that continue to pollute our air and water, car
companies that don't drive hybrids and 0 emission car production when
the technology is now somewhat affordable, etc..  These companies are
why treaties are needed.  They may produce a lot of jobs, but what is
the importance of just having a job when you're working to make the
world less livable for future generations.  Each individual can choose
how much a part of 'saving the environment' they want to be.  Companies
shouldn't have a choice since like government, they effect change on a
much larger scale than an average individual's pollution.  Once they
clean up their act, cleaner products trickle down to us and it is easier
for an individual at that point to care about the environment without
really even having to consiously care.

I grabbed your boobs on Sunset. - m4w - 24=20

Saturday night, I was out with my buddies walking around on Sunset,
going from bar to bar, club to club, etc. You were, presumably, with
your girl friends. As we neared each other, none of us made eye contact.
It's as though we were trying not to look at each other. I sure as hell
was.=20

But because of this, I wasn't looking where I was going either, and
tripped on a crack in the pavement and tripped, falling forward, right
as you were passing by. My arms flailed about and tried to grab the
nearest sturdy thing to steady myself. That nearest thing ended up being
your rack.=20

Unfortunately, your breasts weren't steady nor sturdy enough, so I kept
falling. Along the way, your shirt and bra were torn off in the process.
Your knockers, exposed to the night air, bounced with delight and glee.=20

Almost immediately, you came down upon me, fists rained down hellfire
the likes of which I've never experienced. Your friends quickly joined
in, pummeling me, while my own friends stood back and watched, giggling
gayly as if their kindergarten classmate had just poohed his pants
during recess.=20

It was when you were pepperspraying the shit out of me that we locked
eyes for a moment. It was incredibly painful to keep my eyes open, due
to the intense sting from the pepperspray, but I noticed how goddamn
gorgeous your blue eyes were, and I think I noticed a moment of
hesitation, almost admiration, perhaps. A hint of a smile formed on your
face, and for a second, I thought you were going to kiss me, but then
you headbutted me directly into the sidewalk, rendering me unconscious.=20

This, however, did not stop you from kicking me in the side, spitting on
my face and stealing my wallet, while, yes, you were there, you know, my
friends continued laughing and whooping it up like a bunch of drunken
rednecks at a hoedown.=20

I had hoped to find your phone number scratched into my chest, along
with the many other scratches from your fingernails, but alas, when I
came to, nothing. Just blood and a few scattered teeth.=20

I sincerely hope you read this message because I think we had a
connection, you and I. I want to see where this might lead. As long as
it's not the ICU again.=20

I assume here that we are all talking about "raving?":)  Although we now 
call raves "parties," "underground events" and the like the common bond 
uniting this group even now is the experience of raving.

I've been dancing and DJing at parties both underground and mainstream for 
over thirty years.  Raving was, for me, a much different communal dance 
experience for me through I think the first "raves" were really at the Loft 
and the Paradise Garage in NYC.  Similar vibes.  That loss of self in the 
music and other dancers.  The experience of the other.  Raving was for me a 
life-transforming experience.

My first rave was a Wicked Full Moon many, many years ago.  That night was 
an epiphany for me -- a genuinely transformative experience of the highest 
order.  I learned so much that night.  It wasn't called PLUR then, but it 
was the same thing.  A new way of loving and respecting other dancers.  The 
sharing of a mystical bond.  The union of flesh and spirit.  I thought that 
night that I could spend an eternity with these people and be happy.

Prior to the Wicked FMRs in the early nineties my dancing and performing 
was limited almost entirely to the gay subculture.  I didn't want to dance 
with "straight" people.  In the seventies I went to some punk parties 
because I enjoyed the music and the electric charge of the mosh pit, but 
after spending my high school years in the most oppressively discriminative 
environment one could imagine I was overjoyed to be on a dancefloor with 
hundreds of people like me.  When the eighties came with the darkness of 
AIDS the gulf deepened again between mainstream "straight" society and the 
gay subculture.  Heterosexuals who were once open minded about sexual 
diversity, and even dabbled in same sex relationships themselves, turned 
their backs on us.  Afraid of "catching something."  One publisher I worked 
for -- "liberal" with a non-sexual discrimination policy in place on paper 
--  encouraged employees to bring spouses and significant others to yearly 
meetings in resort towns.  When I brought my lover, however, it was another 
matter.  When we came down to swim in the pool one afternoon everyone in 
the company left the pool.  All this was very hurtful.  So I became heavily 
involved again in gay liberation activities and ACT UP and deeply alienated 
from mainstream culture.

Thus, when a gay friend of mine suggested I attend a "mixed" party thrown 
on a beach and given by some house-head ravers from the UK I was very 
skeptical.  The house part of it sounded very appealing.  I knew what was 
happening with house, especially acid house, in England and the Wicked crew 
were fresh from that milieu.  But dancing with straight people....

That first night on the beach with Wicked and the early ravers here healed 
many wounds in my heart and soul.  These ravers were completely open and 
accepting;  loving and respectful; and such beautiful people inside.  I was 
again able to see humanity as a whole and not segments in conflict.  I came 
to appreciate women once more.  Raver women were much like the goddesses I 
knew in the sixties and early seventies.  And the men didn't seem concerned 
with sexual preferences.  It was all good, and I really touched the heavens 
that night.

The last successful Wicked FMR was over three years ago.  Below is an 
excerpt from a review I wrote right after another extraordinary evening on 
the beach.

Love,

Apollo

"When I heard of the Wicked FMR location -- that we were going back down
Highway 1 to those mystical days on the beach -- I was astonished and
elated.  It had been six years since a Wicked Full Moon.  I never thought
I'd dance on a beach near Santa Cruz to Wicked house music again.

But, I thought, can one have a renegade on those beaches now days without
being busted?  To help assure our success we made a special pre-dance ritual
to the great god Apollo and Pan, and I left a candle burning on the outside
altar when we left.  The gods rewarded us with a perfect night:  a radiant
full moon awesomely reflected on the ocean, cloudless sky, shining stars,
agreeable climate -- and absolutely no squad cars:)  I mean, the party went
off perfectly.

All of us driving down were from back in the day of the first Wicked FMRs.
We were so charged with anticipation.  Me, I got on a metaphysical roll when
we got out of the car and started walking down those familiar railroad
tracks, and I'm still in that place now.  Non-stop bliss, brothers and
sisters.

We arrived early to help with the set up.  Then power up at 2 AM and those
first few beats.  Markie!!!  A collective shout of joy went up from the
crowd.  The tribe was together again.  Ravers under a full moon.  It doesn't
get any better than this.

I wondered who would be there after all these years.  Familiar faces I
hoped, but I was also eager to see many newbies in the tribe too.  A tribe
without new blood dies.  Again, everything as one would hope.  Lots of old
friends and so many lovely new faces.  But the same eclectic mix as in the
old days.  Hippies young and old.  Costumes.  New school ravers.  Fire acts.
Drummers.  People swimming in the nude.  Hip hop kids.   And, to my joy,
many of you from sfraves.  I was really hoping some of you would experience
this thing that is so important to me -- I wanted to share it with you -- so
I'm very grateful to all of you who danced with us last night.  Ryan and his
girlfriend, Mutex, Becca, Usa (former list member and HK crew), and many
more --  every one of you made the night special for us.

The music -- WELL, it is Wicked.  Markie, Jeno and Garth are at their best
doing a full moon.  In this case, the house that Jack built was built on
sand.  Stronger than concrete to my mind.  Jeno, that sweet shy gifted man.
If you know him you know how hard it is to get him to smile.  This morning
he was one happy little boy.  And Garth dancing about in the DJ area.
People doing what they love, yes.

Visuals and special effects.  Hell, you have Mother Nature.  Nothing better.

My favorite thing is greeting the dawn with my tribe.  The morning star was
shining brightly.  The moon setting in the ocean.  Dawn breaks.  Flights of
birds.  Some bats whizzing around on the cliffs.  Freshness in the air.
Dancing and the beats as the sun comes up.  Then...you get to look into your
brothers' and sisters' eyes.  Really see them.  And what you see is a look
that is both far away and meditative, yet loving and open.  Immediate
connection.  At that point I took a walk on the beach.  Every person I met
smiled with that look and said simply:  "Good Morning."

We left at eight (before I wanted to, but I wasn't driving) and the party
was still going down with Garth's moving house music.

It was great fun walking back up the tracks with all the happy ravers.  Such
a feeling of unity, of shared fun.  One moment on that walk sticks in my
mind.  A beautiful hippy kid in a sarong was walking ahead of us.  He had
trouble keeping it on, and he didn't have much underneath.  So we shouted to
him that it was so hard for boys to keep their skirts on these days.  He
blushed bright red.  Then we caught up with him, and he looked at us with
that FMR dawn look and said, with much feeling:  "Good Morning."  We all
hugged.

For me, folks, this is what raving is all about.  These moments.  You
dancers.  The music.  And, the best, a full moon.  That's why I have not
stopped raving and dancing.  I never will.  And I hope, from the bottom of
my heart, that all of you have many moments like this as you grow into a
community that really is all races, all creeds, all ages -- dancing together
as one."

Posts like this make me happy and sad. Happy, because I know that others
out there feel what I do, but sad to know that I've missed so much. So
many experiences that I've missed because of invisible chains my head
locks me in. I sometimes feel that I'm alone and the whole "spirit of
raving" only exists in my head. Maybe I'm the only one DJ'ing sets to
myself everynight throwing my hands in the air only to realize it's only
me that felt it.

It seems that when I do go out I never find the "right crowd", the
"right party", or the "right music". Maybe they don't exist. Maybe it's
only in my head and I have yet to create it, again.

No, Steve, the spirit of raving lives on in many or our minds and 
hearts.  It was real.  And there are those still bangin' away trying to 
bring some of it back.

Times change and I think we are living in a very cynical, dark era.  But it 
was in just such times that raving arose in the late eighties in the UK, 
and in SF in the nineties.  Some of us old timers may be jaded, and many 
have stopped going out.  The old raver house crowd, for example, just will 
not go to a party where there is a pat down and one can't have a proper smoke:)

But as in the early days of raving, people will become dissatisfied with 
the offerings and often aggressive vibe of the club scene.  Unfortunately, 
gentrification and urban "development" have greatly diminished the number 
of venues available for free-spirited raves.  Folks, however, tend to find 
a way to get what they need....

Love,

Apollo

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Spirit of Raving Archives: Q2-2004: What most drew you to the underground scene?



Northern California had Wicked FMR and Southern California had Moontribe.

Both were occuring roughly the same time and were probably the peak 
raving expereinces we will ever see in our lifetimes...

I was lucky enough to be in socal for Moontribe.  Really life-altering
experiences, just like the FMR were, I'm sure.

Moontribe had the advantage though of much more dramatic, and isolated
desert locations that really added to the experience.  I really, honestly,
thought the aliens were going to land at one Moontribe party.  The dry
lakebeds made perfert landing spots, and we were focussed and sending
out so much energy into the universe...

Subject: [sfraves] Fedora Linux help.

OK so I want to install Fedora on a test box at work and im having a bit of 
a problem getting it loaded. I know one of you unix/linux guru's can help 
me.

Here is the situation.

I downloaded the First ISO file. Burned it to CD. It mentioned checking the 
file to confirm it burned properly. But since im running win2k on the box as 
it's primary OS right now. DOS does not recognize the MD5sum command so I 
can't really check the CD but it has the same file size as the ISO on the 
redhat site. So I put in the CD cause I think it is like most standard apps 
and would start to Auto-install. But it does not and I have checked to see 
that the system was booting from CD and not OS/Removable Media etc... It 
just skips over the CD and starts to load Win2k.

So my question what did/am I doing wrong?

2.) Do I need to DL all 4 ISO files since it takes HOURS just to DL one.



Thanks Guru's

Mac

Yes.  Lots of drama in the music "business," however.  On another list 
there was a long, long post from a DJ who felt she had been screwed by her 
agency.  Personal messages, etc., appended to the email.  Calling the 
"FBI":)  Best to keep your professional disputes between the parties 
involved and your lawyers.

Love,

Apollo

    As a senator I don't think you get to actually propose the terms in which 
why you vote for something or how you want it carried out, you just get to 
vote yay or nay. In addition to that as a senator you don't have access to all 
of the same information that the president does. When John Kerry says he voted 
for the war based on false information he was given and yet he also disagrees 
with the way the war was carried out and how the burden was not shared I don't 
think he is telling a lie. I think John Kerry was wrong to vote for the war 
and trust the Bush administration to carry it out justly, but that's him and 
obviously the majority of the other senators as well.  i don't think when you 
criticize a president for the way they carry out things, you can criticize the 
senators the same way just because they voted for it. when you vote for 
something you leave it in the hands of the person in power as to the way they carry 
it out. you can vote for something but still disagree with the way it's carried 
out. For example I don't chastise people for having simply voted for bush if 
they tell me they did. I was hanging out at this house party over in Alamo 
(you know by Danville) and they were all republicans there, one of the guys was 
running for state assembly, we talked about the whole Bush/Kerry ordeal of 
course he didn't agree with me but I got along with the guy. One of the things he 
said kind of struck me, he said that he supports Nader because "a vote for 
Nader is a vote for Bush" of course I told him that was shady politics but he 
didn't care. he basically admitted that he was an ego maniac and he wouldn't mind 
if the government really did have an imperialistic agenda, in fact he thought 
that would be "pretty cool". 
    Anyway the point is that I don't judge the type of President John Kerry 
is gonna be by his senate votes, I think that is very arbitrary and it's like 
playing "gotcha" politics. I'm willing to listen to him talk, listen to his 
ideas and then hold him up to what he says, I don't think he's lying. Bush is 
riding a faulty presidency, he didn't win the popular vote to begin with, he 
didn't do a good job, he was wrong about the war. Bush show's to be unintelligent 
in general by the way he talks and thinks, which unfortunately A LOT of 
Americans relate to him for his unintelligence because A LOT of Americans like bush 
are half wits. People who have  lots of confidence but little knowledge. 
People sympathize with Bush saying things like "aww poor guy got put in a bad 
situation and now all we can do is jump on him?" that's what they say. i hear it 
all the time. "poor George, he's only human" but that's not the point. just 
because George Bush is a half wit just like most the rest of America is, doesn't 
mean he should get to remain president after what he's done. Now I'm sure a lot 
of these third parties sound like a good idea to us here in San Francisco, 
and on SFR for that matter but try convincing that to Iowa, Kentucky, and West 
Virginia, it's not gonna happen. George Bush fucked up and in politics when you 
fuck up you need to be replaced. In order to replace him we need someone who 
can win, that person is John Kerry. It takes certain strategies and sacrifices 
in order to win something as big as the Precedency of the United States of 
America, some of those strategies and sacrifices are bound to make one seem 
similar to the current president. But, ultimately the object is to WIN and that's 
what John Kerry is doing. 
    For example, It would be like if Wal Mart bought out some other company 
like say Fry's electronics, then by some miscalculation this causes Wal Mart to 
loose half it's stocks, this is a very serious issue and someone has to go 
down for it, that person is the President of WalMart, he loses his job, and say 
a high standing store manager replaces him, say even that store manager was 
once in favor of buying out Fry's as well.... who fucking cares! This is not 
gotcha politics. The top dog has to go down, and the next heir has to lead the 
company in a new direction.  If in fact Kerry becomes a "bad" president, as bad 
as Bush like some of you are insinuating THEN i will definitely consider 
voting third party. THEN i think third party has a great chance of actually wining. 
AFTER both Republican and Democrats fail then it's time for the third party 
to step up and revolutionize and WIN i would LOVE to see that. But as of now, 
Kerry is our only chance to beat Bush and I'm sure as hell not rooting for him 
to fail because too many lives are at stake to be that self centered about 
politics.  - *keep bouncing*

that his way would be exactly the same. But the proof is in the 
pudding, and when it comes to foreign policy on things like Iraq, I 
fail to see major differences between them. Kerry's approach to world 
affairs could even be potentially worse: He might sign the Kyoto treaty 
which would drain billions of dollars from the U.S. economy to fix a 
theoretical problem that is not even proven to exist.

    The sorry state of that economy has less to do with who is president 
than with what has been called the "permanent government" -- the 
ongoing high levels of government spending, taxation, regulation, 
bureaucracy, federal reserve phony money, etc. Of course any U.S. 
president *could* address these problems if he chose, but there's no 
indication that Kerry is prepared to do so any more than Bush has. In 
the big picture, the approaches they offer are remarkably similar.

    Only Libertarian Michael Badnarik  ( http://www.badnarik.org ) is 
offering a fiscally responsible and socially tolerant platform that 
would seriously address the problem of America's huge, out-of-control 
imperial government.

For liberty,

Subject: [sfraves] [BSP] A new Track "Junk Funk In The Jungle"

I haven't posted any of the music I have been working on lately so I thought 
I would share. This track is downbeat with a dubby sounding bassline and a 
nice trumpet sample near the end of the track. The track was produced in 
Buzz and rendered for streaming/downloading in Sound Forge. Let me know what 
you think and let me know any tips or tricks you feel might help. Thanks

good start, not bad
i do like mixing in that dubby vibe myself.
try some type of lead melloD
separate the drums and effect only one half of them
maybe find a dub/ragga hit/stab to add
add delay on horn, more reverb is nice too. (ie dj krush style nice)
get a vocal stab to put anywhere (rasta vibe BOH YA!)
bass line, like real slap slide bass guit, try spectrasonics trillogy (stylus 
is nice for adding quick break fills too)

i know thats alot of "pointers" but just some quick thoughts.
good job and keep it up!

one more...  the ohm boys delay its THE best for this style, just turn it on

peace

Subject: RE: [sfraves] tuition raised AGAIN

Here, here!! I was soooo incredibly happy when I found out that tuition
in CA was as cheap as it is, despite the increases. I was paying over
$3K/year in Virginia JUST for tuition, not including some fees, books,
living, etc. I was also paying $175/credit in WV for classes. 

Paying $26/credit is nothing. If you have to, work more hours, take
fewer classes. I work FULL TIME to support myself and take 6 credits of
evening classes each semester. Yes, it'll take longer for my degree to
happen, but it makes the end point all that much more satisfying
knowing I did it ALL BY MYSELF. 

Don't use loans for community college. SERIOUSLY. It's a waste of
money. I'm in Loan Hell because of this, and this is jeopardizing my
financial aid future with a university. Save your loans for University,
where it will be even MORE expensive. Go ask the FinAid office about
the Board of Governer's Waiver. That has been the saving grace for me
through unemployment. They waive the per credi tuition charges. You
only have to pay a very small fee, like under $20 for the misc. fees.
OR talk to them about a work study program. 

Also, did you file your FAFSA, like a good student? If not, you missed
out.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Release and 1015

Judging by how shithole places like SoundFactory in SF *still* have lines
out the door I'd say they'll be just fine. The club will turn more ghetto
hip hop and attract more of the people that cause the problems now. Or maybe
it will die off. I doubt that occur though...

keep in mind that the 'line out the door' is planned, so the club looks 
busy from the outside.

parties need to be brought back to the underground. no
fliers, word of mouth (phone tree). forget about
trying to make bank on a party and make it real again.
IMHO...

~m

sound factory and 1015 will not have problems staying
in business. unfortunately an earlier post is correct.
they will bring in horrible dj's, or hip hop and a
cheezy croud. they will probably make more money. this
could be the best thing to happen to the party scene.
this may force things to go underground again.
hopefully this scene is losing it's force in the main
stream. if this happens i may even start going out
again.

i think this means phillip has been hanging out at Soundfactory recently?

i think with Ruby Skye and Mezzanine as competition, 1015 will have to 
change up its formula.  my guess would be to go more booty....

Keep in mind that what you think of as 'Hip Hop' is probably not the 
real stuff.

Subject: [sfraves] Radio (was Re: [sfraves] Release and 1015)

on a related note, Radio Free Berkeley is holding workshops on how to 
start a low-power radio station.  I've always thought it would be great 
to have a UG radio station for the 'scene'.

the workshop covers transmitter basics, equipment needs, and legal 
issues. It's $100 - $200 sliding scale.  I'm going to try to do the 
workshop when i'm not so goddamned busy.

ps> "crap-hop".  PERFECT name for it.

I've been listening to Phil Hendrie since '96, the guy is a riot!
(though, he has nothing to do with techno, or electronic music)

For a break from the beats, I'd highly recommend checking him out. I 
didn't know he was being broadcast up here again (used to listen to him on 
KFI640, LA)

Thanks!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Radio (was Re: [sfraves] Release and 1015)

there were actually some cats who did this in New Mexico for a while.
I was not affiliated with them, at all, in any way, not even slightly,
but what they did was set up a very low-powered pirate station inside
a van. they put it on the same frequency as the most popular
bling-bling station in Albuquerque and drove up and down the city's
central boulevard (i.e., the main cruising strip) on Friday night
broadcasting Skinny Puppy.

like I say, I wasn't affiliated with them, in fact I had nothing to do
with it, but they tell me that Skinny Puppy sounds surprisingly good
coming out of a lowrider subwoofer.

whoa shit!!!  I don't think they have been here since space children first 
brought them out..

Now if you remember space children parties with the likes of:

RABBIT IN THE MOON
JOEY BELTRAM
THE MUTHA FUKIN NAZI LOOKING "SURGEON"
DJ SNEAK
etc..

Then you are old skewl!!

For those that have never seen RITM.. I highly suggest you go they are a 
show not to be missed like none other..

Bam you got more info like the venue, times etc.. I personally don't think 
it is worth seeing them if it is in a small venue.. They are the type of 
band that need a big ass stage and a nice big warehouse!!

I just saw them in June at The House of Blues in Orlando. I had heard a lot about them and wanted to check them out. They were awesome. I have the flyer for it somewhere and I noticed that it said (DJ set) after Rabbit in the Moon. Does this mean that they will only be playing records and not doing the theatrics?

Now if you remember space children parties with the likes of:

RABBIT IN THE MOON
JOEY BELTRAM
THE MUTHA FUKIN NAZI LOOKING "SURGEON"
DJ SNEAK
etc..

Then you are old skewl!!

For those that have never seen RITM.. I highly suggest you go they are a 
show not to be missed like none other..

Bam you got more info like the venue, times etc.. I personally don't think 
it is worth seeing them if it is in a small venue.. They are the type of 
band that need a big ass stage and a nice big warehouse!!

Subject: RE: [sfraves] [skylab2000] rock the vote!

Being a rock star (or a musician with annoying hair) has nothing to do
with being qualified to make political commentary. Music/art has nothing
to do with politics and shouldn't be mixed with politics. I could care
less what these electronic music artists think of current issues and
anyone who does obviously isn't capable of thinking for themselves.

I agree somewhat with this in that it doesn't make you any *more* 
qualified to make political commentary than anyone else.

> to do with politics and shouldn't be mixed with politics.

now here, you're totally off.  music and art at its best has everything 
to do with the politics of its day.  read up on your history, and art 
history.

music is the most powerful medium in the world.  why do you think the 
RIAA/ClearChannel/FCC fucks are trying to control it so badly?   that 
you would even say such a thing ("music has nothing to do with 
politics") shows that they're succeeding in controlling it, and as a 
result, the politics of the day.

Very good point.. Ross or Tronic care to explain..

When space children brought them out.. They did the live act which rips 
fucking A#$ And then Monk did a DJ set after.

So are they going to DJ and do the live Bunny portion of the act?

Cause if confuscious and Monk are just going to spin and bunny isn't going 
to do the signature RITM psycho dance.. Then it would be like watching two 
DJ's which isn't nearly the same experience at all. DJ's are BORING to 
watch..

The lineup looks pretty solid though..

Subject: Re: [sfraves] tuition raised AGAIN

tuition is about $26/credit hour in New Mexico if you have residency.
(and it's free if you know how to pimp the system.) the community
college in Santa Fe is surprisingly good, too, at least the art
department is. I had a drawing teacher with two degrees from RISD and
a classmate who'd exhibited in galleries from New York to Tokyo (and
pretty much everywhere in between).

Also, OMNI will be on September 18th, shutting down 1 full city block in 
front of Club Mighty in San Francisco. That city block is UTAH Street 
between 15th and Alameda, which is HUGE by city standards. It's looking to 
be a great show, hope to see some of you guys out there!

GEORGE ACOSTA

change and evolve trance from an underground movement to massive festival 
experiences throughout the world. George Acosta is probably Americas most 
unique DJ and has undoubtedly been a major force in shaping the sound of 
trance in Miami and beyond says fellow DJ Dave Ralph. George Acosta is 
Americas representative in the global Trance scene says Markus Schulz.

DJ CRAZE
Six Time World Champion, Cartel Recordings, Miami, Florida
Craze is a mad scientist who slices and dices beats into a breathtaking 
sonic concoction in his Miami laboratory and at events all over the world.  
When Craze is behind a set of 1200s and a mixer, he's on stage:  sometimes 
he's shy, sometimes he's cocky, but you will never hear him be anything 
short of absolutely magnificent.

DISCO D
Tommy Boy, New Orleans, Louisiana
To the press, he has been dubbed phenom, holder of the Ghettotech torch, 
devastatingly wicked & surreally filthy. To his fans, hes no less than 
legendary behind the decks, captivating audiences worldwide with 
distinguished blend of hard-hitting music and turtablist tricks. No matter 
who you ask, its apparent that this producer has made quite the impact.

JUJU

she is an act not to miss.

DJ WHATT
Broken Floor CD Tour, EMUOR, SF
Breaks, the word to him, mean more than just a broken beat or a way to 
describe a tune. The word means creativity, enjoyment and a good time. That 
is the mentality he has taken with all his production work accumulating over 
50 original and remix tracks at his early age. The collaboration with Madame 
Mercury on Broken Floor, exemplifies his mentality towards BREAKS.

Here's how the show is going to go, direct from RITM:

Confuscious is going to be on the decks, Bunny is going to be doing his 
usual crazy visual stuff, and VJ TEK OVT will be providing the intense 
visuals to compliment it all. It's basically a full live show, except 
they're just spinning the records instead of performing them. Hope that 
makes sense. :)

quoth Steve Osteen:

True enough. Though they aren't any more qualified than you or me, they
aren't any *less* either.

> Music/art has nothing to do with politics and shouldn't be mixed with
> politics.

Bzzzt, wrong. Music and politics are both equally valid forms of
expression, and they share a long history together. People that can
express their feelings in art as well as words should be applauded.

> I could care less what these electronic music artists think of current

You probably *couldn't* care less, and that's the point. Most people
don't care about the issues at stake, and these musicians are using
their recognition to get people interested. Even if they disagree with
the message, maybe this campaign will actually persuade people to get
out and vote.

It's funny, Steve: you make an inflammatory offhand comment about Kerry
in Vietnam, decline to join the debate that ensues, then brush off the
whole thing as "politics" with a humorous craigslist post. You've
defended other people on the list that express conservative viewpoints
in the past, but now you denounce musicians that get involved in the
political process. So it sounds to me like you just disagree with their
message, but you don't have anything substantive to say in your own
defense so you just discourage any further discussion. So here's all I
ask: don't be a hypocrite. If you disagree with the message, explain
why; don't just write the whole discussion off as "politics". The two
parties have been doing that for ages, and it's damaged the public's
ability to engage in civil debate over very important issues.

When people are exposed to contrasting viewpoints, they can make up
their own minds and form their own opinions. When more people are
engaged in discussion, everyone wins. That's why it's good when
celebrities use their position in society to express their ideas. It
really doesn't matter what they have to say--they're just ordinary
citizens, after all. What matters is that they're getting people
thinking and talking about issues that affect them, and that allows them
to make more informed decisions when it comes time to vote.

Cheers,

True enough. Though they aren't any more qualified than you or me, they
aren't any *less* either.

->>> Hard to say, I'm not familiar with your political background or
education, neither are you with mine. For all you know I could have a
degree in poly-sci(FYI I don't) and have studied it for years. I know
for a fact though that those musicians haven't.

Bzzzt, wrong. Music and politics are both equally valid forms of
expression, and they share a long history together. People that can
express their feelings in art as well as words should be applauded.

->>> Sure, that's your opinion. I personally don't think art has
anything to do with politics and shouldn't. I always hated Rage against
the machine and the Beastie Boys for their simple attempts to spread
un-educated propaganda through their music. Same with MTV, music
television should be just that - music television. If I wanted politics
I would listen to NPR, CSPAN, or Fox news. I prefer the likes of Billy
Corgan who thought of music as too holy to be involed with such stuff.
Art is godly, politics is not. To me anyway.

> I could care less what these electronic music artists think of current

You probably *couldn't* care less, and that's the point. Most people
don't care about the issues at stake, and these musicians are using
their recognition to get people interested. Even if they disagree with
the message, maybe this campaign will actually persuade people to get
out and vote.

->>> I doubt it. I've never met a single person that said they were
interesting in voting or politics after hearing a famous person promote
it. It's just a method for famous people to feel superior to "normal
people". "Oh, I'm Paul Van Dyk, so since I'm so famous I'll tell people
in another country to vote". Whatever.

It's funny, Steve: you make an inflammatory offhand comment about Kerry
in Vietnam,

->>> No I made a joke about a game using an overheard political comment.
If I really stood behind the comment I would have joined in on the
argument. But I did enjoy reading others ideas on the subject.

You've
defended other people on the list that express conservative viewpoints
in the past, but now you denounce musicians that get involved in the
political process.

->>> I'm not making political statements as a famous person to the press
and public. I'm writing small opinion e-mails to a small list of peers.
BIG DIFFERENCE.=20

 So it sounds to me like you just disagree with their
message,

->>> No, not really, I just find it disgusting that it's "popular" and
trendy to have a specific political opinion. I've always been one to
stay away from trendy stuff and make fun of those that follow what is
"cool".

When people are exposed to contrasting viewpoints, they can make up
their own minds and form their own opinions.

->>> Sure, the problem is, is that all I hear is the liberal view point
and how my country sucks, men are evil, and being white is a crime.

they're just ordinary citizens, after all. What matters is that they're
getting people thinking and talking about issues that affect them, and
that allows them to make more informed decisions when it comes time to
vote.

->>> But are they? Seems to me that they are just spreading more
propaganda and aren't really helping the process at all.

Making a political viewpoint "cool" is incredibly powerful.  I always
try to paint republicans as old and creepy, and Democrats and young,
fresh and energized.  People don't vote on issues, they vote on perception.
Making a political ideology "cool" is very important.

Now, come on.  this is just what the conservatives say the liberals
say.  Its simply not true.  There are so many liberal-minded people
on sfraves, can you look through the archives and find me one single post
where a liberal is saying these things?  Can you point to me where
Michael Moore, or any leading liberal has said such things?

I love my country.  I think the republicans that control it suck.  Men
are not evil... just certain men running the country are.  Being white
isn't a crime, but standing by idle while other white people engage
is criminal activity is.

Well duh, you disagree with their viewpoint, so of couse you will see
it as propaganda and not helpful.

So do you have anything to say about their positions?

Heh, MTV was never really about the music. But where do you draw the
line? If MTV News only reported music-related news, they'd be just as
obligated to report the political positions of musicians as their tawdry
affairs and misadventures.

Sorry, I know you thought this would probably go undebated... but I have
to say it: art is not *inherently* godly. Art isn't even necessarily
emotional; it can be equally functional and practical (design, for
instance). Art can certainly be political, and who are you to tell
anyone that creates political art that it's not art just because it
isn't "godly"?

Urging people to vote isn't endorsing any particular stance, it's just
encouraging people to get involved. I really don't see the harm in that,
and I certainly don't see how you could construe it as part of a
superiority complex.

I think you knew exactly what you were doing. You couldn't bring it up
in a real discussion, so you decided to just stick it at the end of an
innocuous email to poke fun at Kerry. As you said:

It just begs the question: why would you say something that you can't

Ah, but you're an artist, are you not? You didn't pose this as an issue
of celebrity vs. everyman, you posed it as artist/musician vs. anyone
else with a political perspective. I still don't see your point: why is
it not OK for celebrities to express their own opinions?

That's funny... it sounds to me like all you've ever heard is the
ultra-conservative view, that multiracial anti-American liberal
feminazis are taking over the nation! Give me a break. I love my
country, and I'm white. But that doesn't mean I can't criticize our
goverment or the white-male dominated corporate power structure.

Unless you can come up with a counterargument, you're just whining. Oh
shit, that's right: arguing IS whining, and there's no greater crime
than criticizing the President during a time of war! And our government
would NEVER propagandize their own policies... They're grate!

Hey you're right Steve, let's all just agree to disagree and never talk
about those nasty divisive "politics" again. This is a rave list, let's
all just pop a pill and be happy in our temporary autonomous zones,
oblivious to the suffering that goes on around us!

Cheerio,

Urging people to vote isn't endorsing any particular stance, it's just
encouraging people to get involved. I really don't see the harm in that,
and I certainly don't see how you could construe it as part of a
superiority complex.

That's funny... it sounds to me like all you've ever heard is the
ultra-conservative view, that multiracial anti-American liberal
feminazis are taking over the nation! Give me a break.

Unless you can come up with a counterargument, you're just whining. Oh

than criticizing the President during a time of war!

ARRRRGGGGG!!! 

I am sorry, but I just cannot let these statements stand!  liberals
don't hate america.  They might hate the republican vision of
america, but we were quite happy with, say, Bill Clinton's America.

Its like saying all the conservatives who hated Clinton hated America.

Trust me, if liberals hated America, they would not stick around.

I agree that our opinion is no more important than yours BUT at least we 
are able to make a few folks pay attention who may not otherwise and decide 
for themselves.

I DID say, "if you agree great, if not, please vote anyway."

How can getting people to pay attention be bad in any way??

Wow, you really don't know anything about the election fraud in Florida,
do you? FWIW, George Bush was the first president to be appointed by the
Supreme Court, which is not, in fact, "according to the rules of our
government". The only reason he got away with it was that the American
media never bothered to report the scrubbing of voter roles, the no-bid
state contracts to DBT and Choicepoint, or the illegal manipulation of
ballots.

What's really sad is that most people STILL don't care to hear things
like this because they think it can't be true, that it's a liberal myth.
Well sorry, it IS true: Bush was defeated in the popular vote, and had
some 8,000 voters been allowed to vote, as was their right, he would
have lost by a much wider margin, thus rejecting him Florida's electoral
votes and the Presidency.

This isn't artists seeking political gain. It's a group of artists
endorsing a particular viewpoint. Doing so carries the very real risk
(as you've so deftly pointed out) of backlash from the public. It's not
necessarily good for any celebrity's career to express their personal
views, which makes it a relatively courageous action.

> >>>> Jokes aren't meant to be stood behind.

OK, whatever. So now you can deride others for expressing their
political opinions, and excuse anything you say as a "joke". How
convenient!

It's really amazing to me that people still think like this. Do you
really think we (liberals) would still be here if we hated our country?
This is exactly what I referred to when I said that conservatives think
it unbecoming to criticize the President; they just found a really
manipulative way to phrase it and never turned back.

I was actually just paraphrasing what you said: "my country sucks, men
are evil, and being white is a crime". It was an attempt to point out
how foolish that sounded, and I guess it went right over your head.
Sorry!

What makes you think that I would say something like that because it's
"popular"? Did the thought even cross your mind that I could reach that
conclusion by actually studying his policies and their affects on our
country and the rest of the world?

Again, I was embellishing on a common conservative viewpoint.

I know you didn't. You suggested it though: by not participating in the
Kerry/Vietnam discussion then brushing off the whole issue as
"politics", then suggesting that artists shouldn't air their personal
opinions, you're in effect saying "let's just not talk about it". People
that paint "politics" as a dirty word tend not to have anything
substantive to contribute to the public discourse, so they try to
dissuade people from discussing it at all. People with genuine
convictions welcome the debate.

> >>>> Suffering? Who's suffering? BT sure isn't, neither is C.L., nor

So just because they're not suffering directly, they can't air their
concerns that other people are?

> >>>> Pop a pill? Sorry I can't find those.

Really? Then why did you just recently suggest that somebody get a legal
vicoden prescription online?

Sorry, I'll be in Europe for the next couple of weeks hating America.
Feel free to give me a call in a couple of weeks though!

I'm very glad to hear that.

hating the US is a weird thing that Republicans are always projecting
on other people. I don't think it ever comes from anyone but them.

Steve, no offense, no disrespect, but I totally disagree with you. any
reason to vote for Kerry is a good reason to vote for Kerry. vote for
Kerry because that's what all the cool kids are doing. vote for Kerry
because of a strenuous statistical analysis of economic patterns. vote
for Kerry for deep reasons. vote for Kerry for shallow reasons. vote
for Kerry because you saw it a Pepsi ad. vote for Kerry because
somebody wrote an e-mail that contained the phrase "vote for Kerry"
repeated over and over so many times that you were brainwashed to vote
for Kerry. just fucking vote for Kerry. vote for Kerry. vote for
Kerry.

vote for Kerry.

yeah, this is very true; Bush lost by over 500,000 votes, and was put
in place by the Supreme Court anyway.

The Bush family supplies funds to close relatives and/or business
interests of the following Supreme Court Justices:
Anton Scalia
Clarence Thomas
Sandra Day O'Connor

vote for Kerry.

Wow, you really don't know anything about the election fraud in Florida,
do you? FWIW, George Bush was the first president to be appointed by the
Supreme Court, which is not, in fact, "according to the rules of our
government". The only reason he got away with it was that the American
media never bothered to report the scrubbing of voter roles, the no-bid
state contracts to DBT and Choicepoint, or the illegal manipulation of
ballots.

>>>>> Bush won the electorial votes, Period. It is irrelevant that he
lost the popular vote. I've heard much propaganda on this subject on
both sides, but the fact is, is that it was decided on through a system
which has been in place for many years.

Again, I was embellishing on a common conservative viewpoint.

>>>> Stop assuming I'm conservative. I get insulted whenever you brand
me as such.

I know you didn't. You suggested it though: by not participating in the
Kerry/Vietnam discussion then brushing off the whole issue as
"politics", then suggesting that artists shouldn't air their personal
opinions, you're in effect saying "let's just not talk about it". People
that paint "politics" as a dirty word tend not to have anything
substantive to contribute to the public discourse, so they try to
dissuade people from discussing it at all. People with genuine
convictions welcome the debate.

>>>> No, I never said that artists shouldn't discuss politics, they just
shouldn't do it in a way that is taking advantage of their louder voice.

So just because they're not suffering directly, they can't air their
concerns that other people are?

>>>> So who is suffering again?

Really? Then why did you just recently suggest that somebody get a legal
vicoden prescription online?

>>>> NO! I never suggested that somebody get a prescription, I just made
a statement that Rush is stupid because he couldn't and got caught for
doing it illegally.

hating the US is a weird thing that Republicans are always projecting
on other people. I don't think it ever comes from anyone but them.

Steve, no offense, no disrespect, but I totally disagree with you. any
reason to vote for Kerry is a good reason to vote for Kerry. vote for
Kerry because that's what all the cool kids are doing. vote for Kerry
because of a strenuous statistical analysis of economic patterns. vote
for Kerry for deep reasons. vote for Kerry for shallow reasons. vote
for Kerry because you saw it a Pepsi ad. vote for Kerry because
somebody wrote an e-mail that contained the phrase "vote for Kerry"
repeated over and over so many times that you were brainwashed to vote
for Kerry. just fucking vote for Kerry. vote for Kerry. vote for
Kerry.

vote for Kerry.

Tom Cruise agrees with you, he said he wouldn't discuss his vote on
TV, but Tom Cruise is all about ticket sales. I don't think any
musicians out there are trying to get people to pay attention, I think
they'll about getting people to vote for Kerry.

Nor did they report that DBT told the Fl. elections people that not
performing the validation (that they were contracted for and paid for,
4.3 Million in this case vs. 5700 for the previous firm) there would be
an abnormally high # of false positive matches.  i.e. many people would
be falsly denied their right to vote.  Since these were largly african
american folks, the fl. elections people (with the sec. of state at the
time, Katherine Harris, heading up Bush's campaign in Fl.; NO conflict
of interest there?) chose to skip the validation.  This resulted in
57,700 people stripped of the right to vote with a 95% error rate.

It was more than 8000 voters.  More like 55000.

Maybe the fact that he will likely be only the 2nd president in US
history to have a net job LOSS over the course of his term.  Even though
our population certainly isn't shrinking.  Seems like a tough thing to
do, actually.

threadjumping, johnny come lately style...

1 -- the spirit of raving is different from the spirit of music. if it
was all about the music we'd all be at home listening. the key to
finding the right crowd is to bring the right vibe. seek and ye shall
find.

2 -- the original question:
>In all your experiences of the underground scene, what was the first thing that
>drew you in? That first thing that made you feel alive and want more?

wasn't just one thing, it was a million things..."the synergistic
cocktail of drugs, music and people that together comprise a vibe" (or
something like that, I'm paraphrasing Simon Reynolds from memory and
it's not easy).

Here's how the show is going to go, direct from RITM:

Confuscious is going to be on the decks, Bunny is going to be doing his
usual crazy visual stuff, and VJ TEK OVT will be providing the intense
visuals to compliment it all. It's basically a full live show, except
they're just spinning the records instead of performing them. Hope that
makes sense. :)

neither candidate will improve the Iraq situation.

Erm yeah, so... what about all that disenfranchisement and election
fraud? That shit ain't propaganda, it's for real. The "system" used in
Florida is *not* the system that was put in place by the founding
fathers.

I didn't brand you as a conservative, I clearly said that I was
embellishing on a common conservative viewpoint that you repeated
("liberals hate America," etc.). Besides, you've called me a liberal...
I'm not insulted, but I'd at least prefer the term "progressive". ;)

I don't get it then, what would please you? You originally said they
should be separate, that musicians specifically shouldn't discuss
politics because "art is godly" and politics is not. Besides speaking
academically about the political process, how do you propose artists
should be allowed to talk about politics? I was under the impression you
thought they just shouldn't.

> >>>> So who is suffering again?

I shouldn't need to persuade you, since you apparently dislike Bush as
well, but here are a few examples:

The poor, many of whom work multiple jobs to feed their families and
still can't afford decent housing, or healthcare for their children;
wrongly imprisoned detainees in US-controlled foreign prisons, without
access to legal representation; people that have lost their jobs as a
result of Bush's economic policies, then had their unemployment benefits
slashed at his behest; Iraqis, first ravaged by indiscriminant bombing,
then civil war and terrorism that we intentionally brought to them;
AIDS-ravaged Africans who are told--according to Bush's ideological
foreign aid policy--just not to have sex, rather than being given
condoms and taught how to practice it safely; the citizens of
communities diseased by unregulated chemical, agricultural and
industrial complexes; the elderly, who still can't afford prescription
meds because this administration allows drug companies to over-charge
within our own borders and *refuses* to allow re-importation from
countries where they're sold for much less.

Need I continue? Obviously there are many more suffering, but my point
is this: the Bush administration isn't doing shit to solve the issues
that plague our country or the rest of the world. In fact, he's making
many of them much *worse*.

Yeah, that's what I figured. Sorry, sarcasm doesn't come across so well
over email. :\

first of all, I think Kerry will improve the situation.

second of all, I can guarantee Bush would be making it worse if he got in again.

if you want to support the troops, elect a veteran.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] thirty reasons to vote kerry

why do think Kerry will improve the situation.  and "anyone but bush"
ideology just isn't good enough for me here.  Kerry's exit plan does not
suggest improvement.

i support our troops never having to leave our soil.  i support
self-defense.  fighting a war (or during the clinton admin. "conflict /
police action") outside of our borders doesn't seem justified in any case.

can anyone suggest a war / conflict / police action that the u.s. lead in
the last 50 years where people were left better off?  i know i can't.

the proper phrase is "I hate America [for what it is becoming]"
I will attest to that and I see no way to stem the tide - America
has to go thru what Germany went thru - so that's why I'm doing my
best to get aw ork visa.  I will hate what America will have become in
10 - 20 years and I don't want to raise any kids here

and I'm not really that liberal, more of a centrist or at least
a REAL conservative

You should look at a bit o history, Steve.  The arts and politics have been 
intertwined since the beginning of civilization.

Aristotle and Plato understood the power of music on human passions and 
action, and the uses and abuses of the arts in general in the commonweal.

Musicians have produced some of their most deeply moving music in response 
to the political climate. While composers working within repressive 
governments resorted to underground musical satires and hidden programs 
(for instance, the cryptic autobiographical programs in Shostakovich's 8th 
String Quartet), other composers, in contrast, felt free to dedicate major 
works to revolutionary political movements of their day (Beethoven's 
Eroica, and his opera Fidelio).

After WWI the Treaty of Versailles, recognizing the power of German 
military music and bands to move the national spirit, banned both military 
bands and marching music.

There is so much one could write several books:)  A collection of recent 
works discussing music and politics may be found 
here:  http://www.bomp.com/BompbooksPolitics.html

Love,

Apollo

I don't see any evidence that your statement is true.  Some propagandists 
would have one believe that anyone who disagrees with the current regime is 
unpatriotic.  But it is just this propaganda that is truly 
"unpatriotic."  American was founded on conflict and dissent.  The clear 
dangers I see to the Constitution these days are forces within the current 
administration and their corporate partners who would have us all marching 
to the same drum.

IMHO democracy can work only where there is a dialectic:  thesis + 
antithesis = synthesis.  Heathy debate between those with divergent 
viewpoints produces positive change.  The arts play an important role in 
this dialectic.

Love,

Apollo

On that subject:

Suppress the Vote?
by Bob Herbert
Excerpted from The New York Times
Aug. 16 2004
State police officers have gone into the homes of elderly black voters in 
Orlando and interrogated them as part of an odd "investigation" that has 
frightened many voters, intimidated elderly volunteers and thrown a chill 
over efforts to get out the black vote in November.
The officers, from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, which reports 
to Gov. Jeb Bush, say they are investigating allegations of voter fraud 
that came up during the Orlando mayoral election in March.

Officials refused to discuss details of the investigation, other than to 
say that absentee ballots are involved. They said they had no idea when the 
investigation might end, and acknowledged that it may continue right 
through the presidential election.
"We did a preliminary inquiry into those allegations and then we concluded 
that there was enough evidence to follow through with a full criminal 
investigation," said Geo Morales, a spokesman for the Department of Law 
Enforcement.
The state police officers, armed and in plain clothes, have questioned 
dozens of voters in their homes. Some of those questioned have been 
volunteers in get-out-the-vote campaigns.

Kerry's strategy WRT Iraq involves "reaching out" to the nations that we
pissed off by rushing to war in the first place--in other words
explaining to the UN that without their help we're up shit creek. It's
going to take some humility, but that seems to be something that Kerry's
pretty good at projecting. He is a hawk (relatively speaking, of
course), but I think he realizes what needs to be done to get the rest
of the world back on our side.

As far as specific plans go for withdrawing troops, your guess is as
good as mine (or anyone's, for that matter). Until the situation over

Eastern) troops to replace our own, we're stuck. It would be pretty
shitty to have gotten them into all this then just say, "OK, we're outta

fighting 'on their own turf', right?"

Sure... One could argue that Bosnia and Herzegovina's situation ain't
pretty, but it's definitely an improvement over three-way ethnic strife.
Afghanistan is somewhat better off--Karzai's no saint, but he seems
capable of restoring some rule in that country, weening the warlords off
poppy production and fostering local representative rule. And despite
the very real possibility that the Bush administration was instrumental
in recently removing him from power, UN peacekeepers did help restore
the rule of law after Jean-Bertrand Aristide's most recent overthrow in
Haiti.

But do we really need to wait until things get as bad as the Nazi
internment before we decide to intervene? For instance, do you think we
(or the UN) should do something to quell the ethnic cleansing in Darfur? 

I don't support pre-emptive war, but I do think we need to do
*something* to prevent the rest of the world from falling into
desperation.

just one more thing about the funniness of ali g and then we will continue with the regular story again:
 
ali g does a sketch where he goes and visits a man who is a veternarian (sp? animal doctor) and also, incidentally a vietnam vet. throughout the entire sketch, ali g gets the words "veternarian" and "veteran" confused, and this is very perplexing to the old veternarian who repeatedly explains the difference between the two. at one point, after a series of explanations, ali g asks the old man if  he'd always known he'd wanted to be a veteran. it is very funny :)

Ali G is grate:)  Really.  The show with Gore Vidal the other night was 
amazing.  The Ali G persona confronting Catholic 
anti-abortionist/euthanasia types with a discussion of murder and "youth in 
Asia" (euthanasia).  Then the gay European fashionista persona attempting 
to pick up a white, middle aged straight dude at a middle America square 
dancing class.  LOL.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] thirty reasons to vote kerry


I'd rather have an unsure candidate than one that would commit to a course
of action before entering office and reviewing all the facts.  

Will Kerry do any better than Bush, I dunno, we'll have to see...

I for one, can't vote for someone who sent our soldiers to invade another
country, Iraq in this case, based on spotty or fictional inteligence.  Iraq
didn't present a clear and present danger to this country.  Afghanistan is
one thing, they were actually harbouring, and training terrorists, but there
was never any recent evidence, of WMD, or ties to Al Quida in Iraq.  I still
ask myself why we invaded Iraq, especially given the current state of
afghanistan.  

Bush is the president, and thus is responsible.  

My two cents

Funny, because I'm getting info that is saying that the opiate trade is
booming specifically *because* the production from Afghanistan is up so
high...  In most areas of the country(US), heroin is still cheap as hell
because of this.  Before you ask, no, I cant cite sources.. as mine are
coming from friends and compatriots in the drug using population and harm
reduction institutes and needle exchange sites around the country (and in
others).

Why is it our job?  Did we (the people) vote to be peacekeepers or
international police?  Seems to me that in order to be an effective
peacekeeping entity, we need to look between our own borders before we
trounce around the world telling others what is right and wrong.

Just my .02

     John Kerry was a medal winning, Vietnam vet, who later became a leader 
of a vet protest group against the war. He was obviously disgusted with what he 
went through over there. His famous quote from back the day, I'm sure you've 
all heard is (adressing congress authority) "How do you ask a man to be the 
last man to die for a mistake?" This being his most famous quote to his name, 
will stick to him forever. One would think he would make his best attempt to 
uphold this type of mentality within his Presidency and as commander in chief in 
times of war. With that quote being the most powerful and sincere statement 
he's ever been known for, how could he then ask another man to die for a mistake 
again? I mean I suppose it's fathomable for anyone to make an occasional 
mistake, but at least you know where his heart is. I cannot say the same for Bush. 

     They say whether he deserved his medals is speculative but how can you 
believe negative attacks against an upcoming presidential candidate when you 
know they are going to be biased? Presidential Candidates are very vulnerable to 
negative attacks so I'm willing to give them all a little leeway until I see 
some hard-core proof that would make them seem "unfit for command". Kerry 
actually did eventually give up the medals he won from his acts in vietnam, 
leaving them on the steps of the capital in a protest effort. Would Bush ever do 
anything as sincere as that? I think this shows he is a different kind of 
candidate. Another quote from Kerry that first caught my attention to him was when he 
said "Some people look at the way things are and ask why? I look at the way 
things never were and ask why not?" (not sure if that was the word for word 
quote but it's close)   
     I'm sure it sounds a bit confusing how a person can be a commanding War 
vet, then a commanding war protester, then vote yes in the senate for the 
invasion of Iraq, but then no to the funding of that war... But I bet you if you 
could sit with him for an hour and ask him those questions he could explain to 
you his reasoning very logically and thoughtfully. People have complex reasons 
for making complex decisions, we can all relate to this. If someone looked at 
all your decisions you've ever made in your lifetime, I'm sure a lot of them 
would seem very peculiar. The way I see it, John Kerry is a man who evolves 
with time and he is a man who listens to what the people want. Which is exactly 
what a Democratic President should be. He's a million times more sensible than 
Bush and as current events and intelligence change, so does his mind. He 
knows when it's time to retreat, when it's time to ask for help, when it's time to 
admit a mistake, and he knows when it's time to step up and overthrow an 
incompetent leader. To call him a "flip flopper" or "unsure" or "inconsistent" is 
an in-justice, if you jump to conclusions you can make anyone that you don't 
really know, seem terrible. First I'd ask you to really listen to him speak 
because I have many times and I always tend to agree, in general, given our 
current situation and choices, he usually seems to pick the right choice. Just      
  having Bush replaced, in itself, sends positive signals to the rest of the 
world, that we understand, that we care, that we as a massive, who vote 
democratically, do not condone what the Bush regime has done. John Kerry is a 
million times better than having a President who's main beliefs are "Stick to your 
guns" and "We've turned the corner, can't go back now!" That kind of thinking 
just makes me sick. 
     Just because John Kerry does not lean as far left as we would like him 
to, does not make him Bush the 3rd, or Bush light. Don't listen to what other 
people say about these guys, don't even listen to me... listen to these guys 
talk. Who's telling the truth? Who's more sincere? Who's reading palm cards? Who 
has an IQ of over 100?? You should see through them instinctually.    *keep 
bouncing*

Well, I'm basing my statement entirely on a piece I heard on NPR the
other day that discussed how Karzai's administration was trying to stem
poppy production by encouraging farmers to grow other crops. It's slow
going, obviously; the Taliban banned heroin production when they were in
power, and it surged in popularity once they lost control of the
country. But from what I've heard, it sounds like they're making
progress. I could be totally wrong though :\

I guess any progress they've made is a very recent development. I
remember reading just a couple of months ago about heroin production
being completely out of hand since the fall of the Taliban.

You're absolutely right. We have enough problems at home that need
addressing, and from the perspective of a taxpayer getting their money's
worth, it probably seems wrong to commit so many resources to solving
other peoples' issues. But I can't help thinking that it's wrong to
ignore serious human rights abuses (e.g., ethnic cleansing). That's why
I think it's important that we respect the UN, and allow them handle
catastrophes by pooling the member nations' resources. At the very
least, I think we should share that burden with other countries and
allow them to participate equally in the very complex process of
maintaining peace throughout the world.

If its anything like what they(we) are trying to get done in Columbia, it
wont take hold effectively unless its forced (as under the Taliban).

Simply put, there is more money for farmers in poppies than in any other
single crop they can grow in that area.  That's why it boomed so much before
and now.

They may be making progress... hope they do..  but for now.. (IMHO) we just
created a bigger problem.

But I can't help thinking that it's wrong to
> ignore serious human rights abuses (e.g., ethnic cleansing).

Your right, no one should ignore ethnic cleansing.

It would be great if it worked this way, but we have "taken the lead" so
many times, that many times, when the US arrives, everyone else pretty much
stands back and lets us lead the way as far as resources etc..  That is of
course when we do ask for help..  That, and we have this bad habit of paying
to rebuild countries after we attack them.  Not only is that not our duty,
but it drains money better used for domestic issues. Of course, this argues
the point that we shouldnt attack if we dont plan on rebuilding.. but thats
another tangeant alltogether.

And if we ever were to do this, we would have to stop being hypocrites and
start the reform with our allies, many of whom have worse human rights
abuses than any other country we have pointed out needed "liberation from
tyrants".

Word. Besides ignoring the abuses of our allies, we're also hypocritical
about issues like nuclear proliferation (we can keep our nukes, but
don't you dare try to make any of your own!) and international "free
trade" (steel tariffs, agriculural subsidies). We can't demand reforms
around the world until we shape up ourselves.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Need PCMCIA soundcard advice

I use a MOTU 828 with my laptop and traktor. I had to add a firewire pcmcia
(about $50.00) to the laptop. Many "multimedia" laptops these days already
have firewire. I've been using the 828 for years now. There's an 828 mkII
out now which is even nicer.

In addition to the M-audio firewire box already mentioned, there's also
a presonus firewire box, which is expensive but very high quality.

I think Yamaha and Roland also now have multichannel firewire products
as well.

If you want to go really compact (but missing the important balanced outputs
of the firewire boxen) there is also a multichannel PCMCIA audio card
available.

My suggestions:
	*make sure it's got balanced outputs -- less chance of computer
	 digi-noise and ground-loop noise from bleeding into your soundsystem.
	*make sure the headphone jack can get loud enough for "live DJing"
	 (the 828 works fine)
	* make sure you have at least 4 channels that can play simultaneously.
	  2 for the headphone/monitor, 2 for the mains.

     I think that the term propaganda, is used much too loosely or perhaps 
it's been given a much worse stigma than it's dictionary meaning. My editing 
teacher in film school once said that propaganda should not always be thought of 
as a negative term, as in "Nazi propaganda" like we always think of.

Here's what dictionary.com says - 
     1.      The systematic propagation of a doctrine or cause or of 
information reflecting the views and interests of those advocating such a doctrine or 
cause.
     2.      Material disseminated by the advocates or opponents of a 
doctrine or cause: wartime propaganda.

     So then sure Rage Against the Machine and sometimes Beastie Boys 
material would fall into this definition of "propaganda" but why not just let it be 
fair game? If you can say your political views, and rhyme and make music all at 
the same time then why not do it? So what if you have a bigger fan base than 
the president does? That's the whole point isn't it? People follow who they 
relate to, people who care enough to reach out using greater means of 
communication, oddly enough... are the ones who reach more other people. People do need 
to be reached.   
     I remember one day watching the movie "Better Living Through Circuitry" 
with my friends in Washington and part way through the movie one of my friends 
gets up and says he doesn't want to watch this "raver propaganda", I remember 
this same guy also says the movie "The Omega Code" was Christian propaganda. 
This guy was raised Jewish but actually did not seem to believe in anything.   
Not that that matters but maybe that might explain his attitude. Anyway If 
"Better Living Through Circuitry" is "raver propaganda"   "The Omega Code" is 
Christian propaganda and Rage Against The Machine and Beastie Boys are 
"political art propaganda" then... I mean aren't skateboarding movies "skater 
propaganda" and isn't ESPN "sports propaganda"   and wouldn't Playboy be "sex 
propaganda" or beautiful women propaganda?? Where do you draw the line? Why can't 
political views just be fair game? Why can't we just stop using the word propaganda 
unless someone is actually maliciously and purposefully trying to BRAINWASH 
people, knowing that they are not telling the whole truth or any truth at all 
like the Nazis did. I mean if you can convince people to agree with you based 
on what you believe to be the truth, then more power to you, if you do it with 
rhymes and guitars that's even better than being some bland politician, why 
all this criticism? I don't agree that politics in art are propaganda, but if 
they must be defined as such I think that we have over blown and created a false 
stigma upon what the word "propaganda" really means.    **keep bouncing**

A lot of people use the 828. I've never laid my hands on one myself, but
it seems to me that you either love MOTU or you hate 'em. Same with
anything in audio, I guess.

I'd stay away from M-Audio unless you absolutely can't afford
anything else (they are the cheapest, after all). I've had bad luck with
some of their USB interfaces, particularly the Quattro USB. STEER CLEAR,
that thing sucks. As far as firewire goes, here's what I've been looking
at:

On of the cheapest in the lot is the Presonus Firepod, a 10x10 audio,
1x1 MIDI I/O rack mount for ~$600:
<http://www.presonus.com/firestation.html>

The new Edirol FA-101 is tiny, bus-powered, it has the same I/O as the
Firepod (w/2 combo jacks to the Firepod's 8), and it's still relatively
cheap ($500-600):
<http://edirol.com/products/info/fa101.html>

The RME Fireface has 8x8 balanced, 1x1 MIDI I/O, but their site says the
OS X drivers aren't yet available, it's rack-mount, and it's twice as
expensive as the Edirol (~$1500):
<http://www.rme-audio.de/english/firewire/ff800.htm>

Also in that price range ($1200-2000) is the Metric Halo Mobile I/O
2882, w/4 XLR ins, 4 line ins, 8 balanced outs and no MIDI. It's
available with or without built-in DSP:
<http://www.mhlabs.com/metric_halo/products/mio/2882/>

Problem with the 828 is that it only does 48khz.  The 828-2 does do
96khz.

I have had great luck with with my M-audio Firewire 410.  Apparently, early 
driver sucked, but they have the bugs worked out now.  It works flawlessly on
my OS10.3 system.  Only 1 input stereo input, but it does do 96khz.
I much prefer firewire devices over USB1.1.  Latency will almost always
be better on a firewire device compared to a USB1.1 device.

The Firewire 410 also built for live laptop use... dual headphone outputs
with indepent volume control, Balanced inputs with gain and 48V phantom
power, all Firewire-bus powered.  Pretty blue LEDs.

I for one, can't vote for someone who sent our soldiers to invade

Iraq
didn't present a clear and present danger to this country.  Afghanistan
is
one thing, they were actually harbouring, and training terrorists, but
there
was never any recent evidence, of WMD, or ties to Al Quida in Iraq.  I

ask myself why we invaded Iraq, especially given the current state of

Bush is the president, and thus is responsible. =20

     I think that the term propaganda, is used much too loosely or
perhaps it's been given a much worse stigma than it's dictionary
meaning. My editing teacher in film school once said that propaganda
should not always be thought of as a negative term, as in "Nazi
propaganda" like we always think of.

Here's what dictionary.com says -=20
     1.     The systematic propagation of a doctrine or cause or of
information reflecting the views and interests of those advocating such
a doctrine or cause.
     2.     Material disseminated by the advocates or opponents of a
doctrine or cause: wartime propaganda.

     So then sure Rage Against the Machine and sometimes Beastie Boys
material would fall into this definition of "propaganda" but why not
just let it be fair game? If you can say your political views, and rhyme
and make music all at the same time then why not do it? So what if you
have a bigger fan base than the president does? That's the whole point
isn't it? People follow who they relate to, people who care enough to
reach out using greater means of communication, oddly enough... are the
ones who reach more other people. People do need to be reached. =20
     I remember one day watching the movie "Better Living Through
Circuitry" with my friends in Washington and part way through the movie
one of my friends gets up and says he doesn't want to watch this "raver
propaganda", I remember this same guy also says the movie "The Omega
Code" was Christian propaganda. This guy was raised Jewish but actually
did not seem to believe in anything.  Not that that matters but maybe
that might explain his attitude. Anyway If "Better Living Through
Circuitry" is "raver propaganda"  "The Omega Code" is Christian
propaganda and Rage Against The Machine and Beastie Boys are "political
art propaganda" then... I mean aren't skateboarding movies "skater
propaganda" and isn't ESPN "sports propaganda"  and wouldn't Playboy be
"sex propaganda" or beautiful women propaganda?? Where do you draw the
line? Why can't political views just be fair game? Why can't we just
stop using the word propaganda unless someone is actually maliciously
and purposefully trying to BRAINWASH people, knowing that they are not
telling the whole truth or any truth at all like the Nazis did. I mean
if you can convince people to agree with you based on what you believe
to be the truth, then more power to you, if you do it with rhymes and
guitars that's even better than being some bland politician, why all
this criticism? I don't agree that politics in art are propaganda, but
if they must be defined as such I think that we have over blown and
created a false stigma upon what the word "propaganda" really means.
**keep bouncing**

Japan and Germany had a pact.  If Japan declared war with a another country 
Germany became involved automatically.

"You are not thinking.  You are merely being logical."
Niels Bohr to Albert Einstein

"The government, which was designed for the people, has got into the hands 
of the bosses and their employers, the special interests.  An invisible 
empire has been set up above the forms of democracy."
-Woodrow Wilson

"In the eyes of empire builders, men are not men but instruments."
- Napoleon Bonaparte

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

Well, I wanted to hear the counter argument to this. I now understand
that Japan and Germany had a treaty along with the fact that Germany
declared war on us. Thanks for educating me. Someone should tell Michael
Savage this.

See this is why I need to keep my mouth shut on politics.

WW2 stands for WORLD WAR 2!  as in, yes, more than one
country involved!  the same CANNOT be said for the
gulf war or the current 'gimme that oil' war we're
waging.  it's pretty damn obvious, unless you've been
in a friggin bubble for the last 50+ years, that we
invaded Germany because of what Hitler was doing to
the people over there.  PROVEN ethnic cleansing!  not
assumptions based on ill-advised intelligence.  there
IS a difference.  not a very good rebutle on your
behalf.  how bout you write a progressive trance track
about it??  you could call it 'americans for a

But it is PROVEN that Saddam killed hundereds of thousands of people.
And if this is all about oil, then why didn't we take any after taking
over the country?

Anyway, what's so wrong about going to war over oil? Almost all wars in
history have been fought over natural resources.

Um, becuase it is ethically wrong?  Becuase it is unfair to the people
we invade for it?  Becuase it is evil?  

Is that what it has come to, the right justifying America being evil?

Look, if we keep acting evil, they will strike back at us.  All evil
empires fall.  

And its stupid to send our troops and all of our money into a war for
oil, when we could instead invest that money into ending our oil
dependence.  You know, life wouldn't be that bad if we consumed 1/2
the oil we do today.  Yeah, so we would drive smaller cars, boo hoo.
We would not be in the Middle East to rile up more terrorists.

Are you just playing devil's advocate or pushing buttons for fun?  :-D

Saddam killed a lot of his enemies and his own people. It's part of a
regional conflict that's no-one else's business. It's not an issue of
right and wrong. We (or any other countries) do not and cannot get
involve with other regions' conflicts unless it's absolutely
neccessary. Though of course, right and wrong is relative, so is
neccessary military invlovement.

Why didn't we take the oil out right militarily? Because it'll turn
our action from defense (as a reaction to 9/11) to flat-out invasion
(for oil), which gives the international community legitimate reason
to turn against us, not to mention that the people of United States
would not have allowed such invasion in the first place.

We used terrorists as an excuse to invade another largely irrelevant
(to 9/11) country for oil. Or so that's what the movie says. That's an
"invasion", and we're subject to retailiation, UN punishments, and
make a whole lot of new enemies in the process.

The act of war is govern by international law. It sounds like an
oxymoron: if war can be governed by law, then there wouldn't be wars
in the first place. They cover anything from declaration of war,
weapon restrictions (namely chemical, nuclear, etc.) , to POW
treatments, etc. Obviously, these laws are violated al the time during
a war (by both sides). If you break these rules during a war and you
lose (best examples are Germany and Japan in WW2), you'll be subject
to severe penalties by the UN.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_of_war

Genocides and terrorism are special cases since they're not
technically act of war, because these acts target civilians.

In terms of reality, there's not much you can't do in a war, and you
can invade anyone you want for whatever reason you want, the catch is
how many more enemies you're willing to make and what price you're
willing to pay when you lose.

On Friday, August 20th 2004

@ Progressions 1-YEAR ANNIVERSARY 
Heres the latest word from the Progression crew


The Bay Area's longest-running progressive monthly is back for another year
of musical madness! Featuring the finest in local progressive DJ's
pushing the edge of electronic music forward into San Francisco, PROGRESSION

26MIX is gearing up to rock the 2004-2005 season.
But first, Progression is celebrating its 1-YEAR ANNIVERSARY, FRIDAY AUGUST
20TH featuring a 90-minute set from GUEST DJ KOROMA (AuraSF,
Koroma.com). Coming off a brilliant set at Qool last week and a highly 
acclaimed (and
highly booked!) summer, Koroma has been looking forward to playing for us
for awhile, and we're hugely excited that he'll be helping us celebrate
in fine, bangin' style!

So remember Friday, August 20th, from 6-10PM at 26MIX is PROGRESSION'S FIRST
BIRTHDAY BASH! We'll have cigars, birthday cake, and a drawing to enter
and win A FREE TICKET TO JOHN DIGWEED AT MEZZANINE ON FRIDAY SEPTEMBER 3RD!
Yep, you read that right. As Progression's birthday gift to you, the
loyal supporters of the SF scene, we're laying down a free ticket to the
return of the king! The drawing goes off at 9:00, and we hope to see you 
there.
So come by, have a drink, enjoy some cake, and be ready to dance your
ass off. Because Fall is coming, big things are on the horizon, and the
place to start off your Friday night is HERE!

No, Steve.  It's good to question things.  The world is a much more complex 
place than some would have us believe.  Decision-making would be simple if 
war was a conflict between "good and evil" as it is portrayed in the "Lord 
of the Rings" movies (not so black and white in the books).

After the bloodbaths of the twentieth century attempts were made to create 
some internal legal structures governing war.  The Germans were involved in 
preemptive warfare, as were the Japanese, for reasons that both countries 
believed were just.  Preemptive warfare, therefore, is now viewed as 
immoral and illegal.  Even prior to WWI and II there were many Christian 
theologians who believed the only moral war was one that was defensive.  I 
don't believe the United States should ever be involved in preemptive 
military action.  We're better than that, I hope....

Complexity.  Research is relatively easy these days.  Look at the history 
of Mesopotamia, now Iraq, and Persia, now Iran, and you get a much better 
understanding of what ancient forces are in play there.

History is grate.

Love,

Apollo

Military records support Kerry's account of Vietnam service


BY Joseph L. Galloway
Knight Ridder Newspapers


WASHINGTON - Military records back John Kerry's account of his service in 
Vietnam and have backed at least two of his accusers into a corner.

Kerry this week was forced to defend himself against accusations by a group 
of fellow Navy veterans of Vietnam that he was a liar and a coward. The 
charges were made in a book and in an attack ad that polls show have 
chipped away at Kerry's standing with veterans in three critical states - 
West Virginia, Wisconsin and Ohio.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] thirty reasons to vote kerry

Steve, 
With all due respect, we invaded Germany because Germany, Japan and Italy
were part of "The Axis" Alliance.  Hence an attack or declaration of war on
one, is considered an attack or declaration on all.  Subsequent to the
infamous attack of Pear Harbour, President Roosevelt, before a joint session
of congress asked for a declaration of war against Japan.  I think, about
the 11th or 12th of December, Germany, and eventually Italy declared war
upon the United States.  

Was it wrong to declare war on Japan, and assist the allies in the invasion
of Germany?  Absolutely not!  Remember, we were forced into WW2.  

All I was saying, was we were not attacked by Iraq.  There was no
intelligence linking Iraq to any terrorist groups.  In fact, I think it was
Powel, who stood up in front of the United Nations, and the world, and
stated that we had the goods, and that Iraq presented a Clear and Present
Danger not just to the US but to the world.  Where's the evidence, in fact,
the administration later countered these claims.  

We are in Iraq now, we cannot leave.  People are dying, and the country is
even more unstable then it was under it's former government.  IMO, bush is
responsible, and should not be re-elected, regardless of whether he knew the
intelligence was credible or not.

It's a simply matter of responsibility.  

A chance maybe to prove Godwin's Law.  =)

So why did we invade Germany in WW2 when it was Japan that attacked us?
Was that wrong also?

I'd rather have an unsure candidate than one that would commit to a
course
of action before entering office and reviewing all the facts.  

Will Kerry do any better than Bush, I dunno, we'll have to see...

I for one, can't vote for someone who sent our soldiers to invade
another
country, Iraq in this case, based on spotty or fictional inteligence.
Iraq
didn't present a clear and present danger to this country.  Afghanistan
is
one thing, they were actually harbouring, and training terrorists, but
there
was never any recent evidence, of WMD, or ties to Al Quida in Iraq.  I
still
ask myself why we invaded Iraq, especially given the current state of
afghanistan.  

Bush is the president, and thus is responsible.  

My two cents

Is Kerry going to improve this situation? He hasn't proposed anything
better, in fact he sounds like he is pretty unsure of his stance.

Grandmaster Flash
THE TURNTABLE LEGEND / ESSENTIAL / NEW YORK
www.grandmasterflash.com

The creator of the Quick Mix, he was the first person to change the 
arrangements of songs using duplicate copies of records and manually 
repeating the climatic part by rubbing the records back and forth. His Quick 
Mix style helped stretch the BREAK of the song and drive the crowd and all 
B-Boys & B-Girls wild with his live editing. Flashs CUTTING and 
SCRATCHING helped him become a pioneer for all turntablelist throughout the 
world. Come and see a legend at work for this special engagement.


2 Bad Mice
EMUOR / SM:)E / UNITED KINGDOM

Formed in 1991, 2 Bad Mice are widely attributed as among the first U.K. 
hardcore acts to begin incorporating breakbeats into electronic music. With 
countless tracks since the early 90s, such as Bombscare  The original 
breakbeat anthem to the globe, 2 Bad Mice tunes have been a staple in the 
electronic music scene for over 10 years. Now you can taste what started it 
all as one of the originators of the classic old school rave sound graces us

we've been trying to find online footage of people dancing, poppin, lockin, rave-style, etc, and have had some luck. but a friend mentioned that at a lot of the parties we used to go to (in/around SF), there were people  with video cameras, taping us, and the crowd.  also, we went to a party at decibel a couple yrs back, and they were taping for a movie/documentary called  "2 a.m." or something like that.
any ideas or leads as to where to find any of this footage? i know it sounds kinda vague...
thanks,

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR:  Kerry military records

	Joseph Galloway sounds more like a flack for the Kerry campaign than a 
balanced reporter. Here is a bit more even-handed account:

		http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4790712/

	I agree that it sounds like the records released by Kerry appear to 
generally correspond with the accounts given by him and his supporters 
of what he did in Vietnam. Those Swift Boat veterans who are saying 
something contradicted by the records need to explain, or their own 
credibility is going to take a hit.

	The articles sound however like all Kerry's war records have not been 
released, and that his campaign is playing games with at least one 
document, by saying it's a "private" medical record which "a reporter" 
could come to his campaign office and look at, but not make copies to 
take away.

	I don't understand why this one record documenting an injury to 
Kerry's elbow that happened decades ago would be a "private" record 
subject to this kind of restriction while the other records of his war 
injuries are not, unless someone is trying to hide something.

For liberty,

hey all you Trance-heads in the bunch:

There is a trance party (called "Psy-cho Therapy - doh!) tonight in the 
Sierras, somewhere near Angel's Camp, and I am looking for directions.

Attempts to call the info line have yielded no usable information.  
Does anyone have directions to the event, or an info # that has 
directions?

thanks in advance,

<<Journalist Breaks Silence to Defend Kerry Against Swift Boaters

By E & P Staff
Published: August 21, 2004

NEW YORK A Chicago Tribune journalist who commanded a boat alongside John 
Kerry in Vietnam broke a 35-year silence on Saturday to say that stories 
told by Kerry's "Swift Boat" detractors are untrue.

William Rood of the Chicago Tribune wrote on the newspaper's Web site, 
"There were three swift boats on the river that day in Vietnam more than 35 
years ago -- three officers and 15 crew members. Only two of those officers 
remain to talk about what happened on February 28, 1969

"One is John Kerry ... who won a Silver Star for what happened on that 
date. I am the other.">>

Or that:

<<Ex-commander backs Kerry on Vietnam

By Carol Giacomo

PITTSBURGH (Reuters) - A journalist who commanded a boat alongside John 
Kerry in Vietnam has broken a
35-year silence to defend the Democratic presidential candidate against 
Republican critics of his military
service and integrity.

William Rood of the Chicago Tribune said the tales told by Kerry's 
detractors are simply untrue.>>

The story is breaking on the wire services as I type.

Love,

Apollo

Hello,

I was just wondering if anyone has taken art classes at CCSF.  And if so, 
could you recommend any teachers to take.  I currently enrolled in a basic 
drawing class, but the teacher is not really inspiring me, plus there is an person 
that is already annoying me.  So any recommendations on teahcers and classes is 
appreciated.

thanks

I totally agree.  But we don't see these attack ads here.  They are only 
shown in the so-called "battleground" states and they appear to be having 
much impact if one believes the polls.  That's the way politics work in the 
US of A:  no complex issues, just dirt and soundbites.

The real fun begins next week when the Swift Boat Boys for Bush focus on 
Kerry's activities after he left Vietnam and his testimony about atrocities 
committed by our troops.

Personally, one of the reasons I thought Kerry might be a good Democratic 
candidate was that he told the truth about the heart of darkness that was 
Vietnam after he had served honorably.  His marketing execs, however, 
decided he should repackage himself as a John Wayne/Terminator dude and so 
we get some fool who looks like he's running for President of the VFW.  Now 
he's going to have to discuss the anti-war activist side.  I assume his ad 
men were prepared for this.

Love,

Apollo

this is just irresistable (sp?...gotta have it)...on the subject of funny men who know contemporary history and how to make it funny...chris rock is a genius...he does a sketch where he sets up a black and white commercial...like one of those serious "don't do drugs" types of ads that you see on american television, but what it is is a "guns for knives program" where he invites all those with guns to trade them in for knives...tomarrow, back to the fiction story...gotta talk to the kids about where they would like it to go before we post it. happy day...happy vote. :)

Ali G is grate:)  Really.  The show with Gore Vidal the other night was amazing.  The Ali G persona confronting Catholic anti-abortionist/euthanasia types with a discussion of murder and "youth in Asia" (euthanasia).

--=====================_7663018==.ALT

Drug war is a war on families
By Walter Cronkite

Sunday, August 08, 2004 -

In the midst of the soaring rhetoric of the recent Democratic National 
Convention, more than one speaker quoted Abraham Lincoln's first inaugural 
address, invoking "the better angels of our nature." Well, there is an 
especially appropriate task awaiting those heavenly creatures - a 
long-overdue reform of our disastrous war on drugs. We should begin by 
recognizing its costly and inhumane dimensions.

Much of the nation, in one way or another, is victimized by this failure - 
including, most notably, the innocents, whose exposure to drugs is greater 
than ever.

This despite the fact that there are, housed in federal and state prisons 
and local jails on drug offenses, more than 500,000 persons - half a 
million people! Clearly, no punishment could be too severe for that portion 
of them who were kingpins of the drug trade and who ruined so many lives. 
But by far, the majority of these prisoners are guilty of only minor 
offenses, such as possessing small amounts of marijuana. That includes 
people who used it only for medicinal purposes.

The cost to maintain this great horde of prisoners is more than $10 billion 
annually. And that's just part of the cost of this war on drugs: The 
federal, state and local drug-control budgets last year added up to almost 
$40 billion.

These figures were amassed by the Drug Policy Alliance, one of the foremost 
national organizations seeking to bring reason to the war on drugs and 
reduce substantially those caught in the terrible web of addiction.

There are awful tales of tragedy and shocking injustice hidden in those 
figures - the product of an almost mindlessly draconian system called 
"mandatory sentencing," in which even small offenses can draw years in prison.

Thousands of women, many of them mothers of young children, are included 
among those minor offenders. Those children left without motherly care are 
the most innocent victims of the drug war and the reason some call it a 
"war on families."

Women are the fastest-growing segment of the prison population, with almost 
80 percent of them incarcerated for drug offenses. The deep perversity of 
the system lies in the fact that women with the least culpability often get 
the harshest sentences.

Unlike the guilty drug dealer, they often have no information to trade for 
a better deal from prosecutors, and might end up with a harsher sentence 
than the dealer gets.

Then there are women like Kimba Smith, in California, who probably knew a 
few things but was so terrified of her abusive boyfriend that she refused 
to testify against him. (Those who agree to testify, by the way, frequently 
are murdered before they have a chance to do so.) Smith paid for her 
terrified silence with a 24-year sentence. Nonviolent first offenders, male 
and female, caught with only small amounts of a controlled substance 
frequently are given prison sentences of five to 10 years or more. As a 
result, the number of nonviolent offenders in the nation's prisons is 
filling them to overflowing, literally. The resulting overcrowding is 
forcing violent felons onto the streets with early releases.

The Drug Policy Alliance also points out other important areas of injustice 
in the present enforcement system. For instance, people of color - 
African-Americans and Latinos - are far more likely to be jailed for drug 
offenses than others. And college students caught in possession of very 
small amounts of illegal substances are denied student loans and even food 
stamps.

The Alliance and other organizations are working to reform and reframe the 
war on drugs. And they are finding many judges on their side, who are 
rebelling against this cruel system. We can expect no federal action during 
the congressional hiatus in activity ahead of the November elections, but 
it would be of considerable help if, across the country, campaigning 
politicians put this high on their promises of legislative action, much 
sooner than later.

Walter Cronkite has been a journalist for more than 60 years, including 19 
as anchor of the CBS Evening News.

Subject: [sfraves] Sunset warehouse party review!

So I head out to the sunset warehouse party sat night and this is how it 
went down.

I figure I would show up a bit later so I show up at 11:15 and let me just 
say that im like the 3rd person at the party.. im thinking WTF?? no one is 
here this is going to suck. But I hang out for a bit. Awesome lil space for 
the sound system being a small stack it sounded very good nice and punchy 
but not to loud just right. Both rooms that is.. The DJ's here we go.. The 
first DJ is the main room was ok. Not playing anything mind blowing but ok.. 
The downtempo/hiphop DJ in the second room sort of sucked not a good flow of 
music and semi off beat at times.

But then Galen jumps on the decks and I have not heard this guy in a LONG 
time and he just simply fucking rocked it. After him was Solar and solar is 
just damn solid too. Buy this time. The place is so god damn packed you 
can't even move. Got to see alot of old faces I have not seen in years! 
Micron and a few others to say the least. Then the man of the Hour jumped on 
the decks JT Donldson. Now if you follow house you know that JT and Lance 
just fucking rock like no others. And JT did not disapoint he had the 
tightest cleanest set I have heard in a long while. And he is cool as shit 
him and lance (who just happened to be hanging out getting drunk) So I get 
to chat with those two guys for a few minutes and then mingle about. Very 
good crowd nice and older but still have that "I love to get down at a rave" 
type of vibe.

Only drawbacks. Port-A-Potties.. I just hate those! And lack of decor it was 
basically just a warehouse with the soundsystem and a visual wall. But they 
made it work.

Overall a very solid UG party with nice headlining DJ's oh and I forgot to 
mention only $10

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR:  Kerry military records

	When you say "the real issues at the heart of the upcoming elections" 
Andrew, do you mean the wanton violation of the Constitution and of 
civil liberties and basic human rights by both Republicans and 
Democrats? If that's what you mean, then I stand corrected. I would 
definitely prefer to be talking about those issues, because they are 
much more important now than what happened during the Vietnam War.
	
	But if by "the real issues at the heart of the upcoming elections," 
you mean what the politicians and the media and the public is currently 
focused on, then that would unfortunately be Kerry's actions during the 
Vietnam War (and Bush's "lack of action," shall we say, during that 
period).

	I would like nothing better than the public to wake up and focus on 
*real* issues -- for example, the fact that an entire amendment to the 
Constitution has been illegally disregarded and the very knowledge of 
its existence swept under the rug (see 
http://users.frii.com/gosplow/13th.html ).

	What is your opinion of the Missing 13th Amendment?

Peace, love & liberty,

     You know I always complain about how DJ's are given so much praise, yet 
dancers in my opinion are way more interesting to watch at a rave. Half the 
time the DJ could actually be just standing there doing nothing since records 
are quite capable of spining by themselves once you set them on the right 
track... of course I know there are many other complications to the job, such as 
beat matching, asthetics and taste of music, but I try to make the argument that 
the dancers are the REAL show. Much like the swing kids were the real show in 
the 60's when they were underground, as opposed to the bands that played for 
them. I think that the dancing styles seen at raves, are an evolutional 
dance/artform that transcend well beyond the traditional ideas of "b-boying" or 
"breakdancing" these are entirely ground breaking dance styles that I imagine 
someday will gain the same respect that other dance styles get such as 
b-boy/breaking, swing, tap, or Capoeira which were all once underground. When trying to 
emphasize to people how dancers should be the heart of the scene and not DJ's 
most of them say something to me along the lines of "what do you want a cookie?" 
and the answer is YES yes i do want a cookie, and guess what? this weekend at 
modified's Modification party I was dancing and someone came up to me and 
gave me a cookie! it was awsome, i mean i dunno what health specialist say about 
eating unpackaged cookies from strangers at a rave, but but I ate that cookie 
and it was good and i didn't die. *keep bouncing*

word. credit where credit is due, the Republicans might have ruined
the economy, stolen the last election, started a war that makes us
more of a terrorist target than ever before, and done it all with more
public opposition to their policies than the Vietnam War had during
the high point of its public opposition, but they sure are masters of
diversionary tactics and sleazy campaigning. what til you see what
they have planned for New York. never mind that 4 out of 5 New Yorkers
are Democrats, or that on 9/11, when the streets were filled with soot
and smoke, Bush was hiding a thousand miles away in an "undisclosed
location" like the draft-dodging coward he is. never mind that New
Yorkers, like most of the country, were totally opposed to the way his
tax cuts favored the wealthy and fucked everybody else. just watch the
monkey, America. they own the diversionary tactics, they own when it
comes to the ruthless sleazebag bullshit, which is why they own the
country, even when the majority of Americans are more liberal than
either Kerry or Bush. they own your tax money, they own your job, and
they're taking your tax money, and they're sending your job to another
country.

it's not who you vote for, it's who you vote against.

I think if you just light someone on fire you get a result kinda what

I was very pleasantly surprised with that party, and it was the first time
I've played totally un-fucking-hyphen-ated techno in a while, and twas a
good crowd in it for the long haul.  Good times!  The memories will last
even longer than the headache from the discount vodka in those vodka crans
we got as part of our generous compensation package (ultimately I'm not
kidding, those few bucks saved my life as I put them in my back pocket and
then lost my wallet... so that's money I'm living off of for now - WHOOOO
to the underground).

Although I gotta say, the cookies put a fog on me head.  Was there
something in them??!?!?!?!  Did I dance?  How did I get home?  Did I play
records?  Where is my wallet?  Did I publicly urinate on anything of
importance?  Why is there a phone number scrawled on my underwear?  And

Andy,

	My throat feels so violated after how hard your post made me laugh!   
8)  But on a more somber note, I hope you find your wallet. Glad you 
had fun at the party anyway, and hope that makes up for the loss.

Cheers,

yeah, that's kind of Clockwork Orange.

I went to Boy Scout camp once, when I was in junior high, and this guy
lit himself on fire with a can of deodorant. he had to go to the
hospital, he had third-degree burns. he was lighting the aerosol spray
on fire for the flamethrower effect and he got a little too close to
the campfire and it blew up in his face.

(we were kinda the pyro troop.)

anyway, remember, kids, it's all about the pump spray. pump spray
creates fireballs instead of cone-shaped jets, so it looks cooler
anyway, but more importantly, unlike an aerosol spray, pump spray
can't trace back to the can, which means you are totally safe from
explosions. (and, therefore, third-degree burns.)

I didn't really feel dirty about it till I got a call from the bank.
The check for $7.34 you wrote me bounced.  I'm not saying I did it just
for the money, but this changes things for me emotionally, you know?

	If you support "asset forfeiture" where the police can seize the 
property of people not even charged with any crime, let alone 
convicted, are glad to see nearly 6 million Americans in jail or on 
probation or parole, and think the racial disparity in sentencing and 
"mandatory minimum" laws are a good thing, then by all means vote for 
Kerry or Bush this November... Kerry even voted for the racist law 
requiring crack cocaine users to be sentenced 100 times more harshly 
than powder cocaine users! (see details below)

"A Libertarian president would order federal officials to cease and 
desist in harassing medical marijuana patients and would block federal 
spending on the War on Drugs. Nonviolent drug offenders would be 
released from federal prison, and each state would choose its own drug 
policy, just as each chose its own alcohol policy when alcohol 
Prohibition was repealed. Libertarians would hope and expect most 
states to come around and severely reform their policies to make them 
more humane and less at odds with the Constitution and the American way 
of life."

"They Want Blood"
The Bi-Partisan Origins of the Total War on Drugs

By ALEXANDER COCKBURN
and JEFFREY ST. CLAIR

Kerry or Bush? How about the 5.9 million people here in the United 
States, under "the supervision" of the Justice system, either in 
prison, in jail, of probation or parole. Will it make a difference to 
these         people--two million of them behind bars--which of the two 
sits in the Oval Office? No. Both Kerry, who misses no chance of 
emphasizing how he was once a "prosecutor", and Bush, pledge more cops, 
tougher penalties, and above all no let up in the War on Drugs which 
has thrown  millions into the American Gulag, for ten, fifteen, 20-year 
sentences based on mandatory minimums and "enhancements" which a 
federal appeals court has now declared to have flouted the 
Constitutional right to a fair trial before a jury of one's peers. Ever 
since the mid-1980s the War on Drugs has been a bipartisan affair. Come 
with us on a journey         back to the time when Tip O'Neill, liberal 
Democrat from Massachusetts, and Ronald Reagan, colluded in a terrible 
new chapter of a war aimed at the poor, particularly ethnic minorities, 
and waged ever since the late nineteenth century and the attacks on  
the Chinese laborers of California.  This is an excerpt from Dime's 
Worth of Difference: Beyond the Lesser of Two Evils .

In 1930 a new department of the federal government, the Bureau of 
Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, was       created under the leadership 
of Harry Anslinger to carry out the war against drug users. Anslinger, 
an avowed racist, was an adroit publicist and became the prime shaper 
of American attitudes about drug addiction, hammering home his view 
that this was not a treatable addiction but a deviant urge that could 
only be suppressed by harsh criminal sanctions.

Anslinger's first major campaign was to criminalize the drug commonly 
known at the time as hemp. But Anslinger renamed it "marijuana" to 
associate it with Mexican laborers who, like the Chinese before them, 
were unwelcome competitors for scarce jobs in the Depression. Anslinger 
claimed that marijuana "can arouse in blacks and Hispanics a state of 
menacing fury or homicidal attack. During this period, addicts have 
perpetrated some of the most bizarre and fantastic offenses and sex 
crimes know to police annals."

Anslinger linked marijuana with jazz and persecuted many black 
musicians, including Thelonious Monk, Dizzy Gillespie and Duke 
Ellington. Louis Armstrong was also arrested on drug charges, and 
Anslinger made sure his name was smeared in the press. In Congress, the 
drug czar testified that "coloreds with big lips lure white women with 
jazz and marijuana".

By the 1950s, amid the full blast of the Cold War, Anslinger was 
working with the CIA to charge that the new-born People's Republic of 
China was attempting to undermine America by selling opium to US crime 
syndicates. (This took a great deal of chutzpah on the part of the CIA, 
whose planes were then flying opium from Chiang Kai-Shek's bases in 
Burma to Thailand and the Philippines for processing and export to the 
US.) Anslinger convinced the US Senate to approve a resolution stating 
that "subversion through drug addiction is an established aim of 
Communist China".

In 1951, Anslinger teamed with Democrat Hale Boggs to marshal through 
Congress the first minimum mandatory sentences for drug possession: two 
years for the first conviction for possession of a Schedule 1 drug 
(marijuana, cocaine), five to ten years for a second offense, and ten 
to twenty for a third conviction. In 1956 Anslinger once again enlisted 
the aid of Boggs to pass a law calling for the death penalty to be 
imposed on anyone selling heroin to a minor, the first linking of drugs 
with Death Row.

This was Anslinger's last hurrah. Along with John Kennedy's New 
Frontier cantered sociologists attacking Anslinger's punitive 
philosophy. The tempo of the times changed, and federal money began to 
target treatment and prevention as much as enforcement and prison. But 
the interim didn't last long. With the waning of the war in Southeast 
Asia millions of addicted GIs came home to be ambushed by Richard 
Nixon's War on Drugs program. Nixon resurrected Anslinger's techniques 
of threat inflation, declaring in Los Angeles that "as I look over the 
problems of this country I see that one stands out particularly: the 
problems of narcotics."

Nixon pledged to launch a war on drugs, to return to the punitive 
approach and not let any quaint notions of civil liberties and 
constitutional rights stand in the way. After a Nixon briefing in 1969, 
his top aide, H.R.       Haldeman noted in his diary: "Nixon emphasized 
that you have to face the fact that the whole problem is really the 
blacks. The key is to devise a system that recognizes this while not 
appearing to." And the Democratic congress played along.

But for all of his bluster, Nixon was a mere prelude to the full fury 
of the Reagan-Bush-Clinton years, when the War on Drugs became 
explicitly a war on blacks. The first move of the Reagan administration 
was to expand the drug forfeiture laws, first passed in the Carter 
administration. In 1981 Reagan's drug policy advisors outlined a plan 
they thought would be little more than a good PR sound bite, a public 
display of the required toughness. They proposed allowing the Justice 
Department to seize real property and so-called "substitute 
property"--that is, legally acquired assets equal in value to illegal 
monetary gains. They also proposed that the federal government be 
permitted to seize attorney's fees that they suspected might have been 
paid for through drug proceeds. The Reagan plan was to permit 
forfeitures on the basis of a "probable cause showing" before a federal 
judge. This meant that seizures could be made against people neither 
charged nor convicted, but only suspected, of drug offenses.

Contrary to the administration's expectations, this plan sailed through 
Congress, eagerly supported by two Democratic Party liberals, Senators 
Hubert Humphrey and Joe Biden, the latter being the artificer in the 
Carter era of a revision of the RICO statutes, a huge extension of the 
federal conspiracy laws. Over the next few years the press would 
occasionally report on some exceptionally bizarre application of the 
new forfeiture provisions, such as the confiscation of a $25 million 
yacht in a drug bust that netted only a handful of marijuana stems and 
seeds. But typically, the press ignored the essential pattern of 
humdrum seizures, which more often focused on such ordinary assets as 
houses and cars. For example, in Orange County, California, fifty-seven 
cars were seized in drug-related cases in 1989 alone. "Even if only a 
small amount of drugs is found inside," an Orange County narcotics 
detective explained, "the law permits seized vehicles to be sold by law 
enforcement agencies to finance anti-drug law enforcement programs."

In fact, the forfeiture program became a tremendous revenue stream for 
the police. From 1982 to 1991, the US Department of Justice seized more 
than $2.5 billion in assets. The feds confiscated $500 million in 
property in 1991 alone, and 80 percent of these seizures came from 
people who were never charged with a crime.

On June 17, 1986 University of Maryland basketball star Len Bias died, 
reportedly from an overdose of cocaine. As Dan Baum put it in his 
excellent book Smoke and Mirrors: the War on Drugs and the Politics of 
Failure, "In life, Len Bias was a terrific basketball player. In death 
he became the Archduke Ferdinand of the Total War on Drugs." It was 
falsely reported that Bias had smoked crack cocaine the night before 
his death. (He had, in fact, sniffed powder cocaine and, according to 
the coroner, there was no clear link between this usage and the failure 
of his heart.)

Bias had just signed to play with the Boston Celtics and amid Boston's 
rage and grief Speaker of the House Tip O'Neill, a representative from 
Massachusetts, rushed into action. In early July of that year he 
convened a       special meeting of the Democratic Party leadership on 
the Hill: "Write me up some goddamn legislation," O'Neill ordered. "All 
anybody in Boston is talking about is Len Bias. They want blood. If we 
move fast enough we can get out in front of the White House."

The Reagan White House was moving fast itself. Among other things the 
Drug Enforcement Agency had been instructed to allow ABC News to 
accompany it on raids against crack houses. "Crack is the hottest 
combat-reporting story to come along since the end of the Vietnam War", 
the head of the New York office of the DEA exulted.

All this fed the congressional frenzy to write tougher laws. House 
Majority leader Jim Wright, the Texas Democrat, called drug abuse "a 
menace draining away our economy of some $230 billion this year, slowly 
rotting away the fabric of our society and seducing and killing our 
young". Not to be outdone, South Carolina Republican Thomas Arnett 
proclaimed that "drugs are a threat worse than nuclear warfare or any   
     chemical warfare waged on any battlefield".

So the 1986 Anti-Drug Abuse Act was duly passed. It boasted 29 new 
minimum mandatory sentences. Up until that time in the entire history 
of the Republic there had been only 56 minimum mandatory sentences. The 
new law enacted a death penalty provision for drug "king pins" and 
prohibited parole for even minor possession offenses. But the chief 
target of the bill was crack cocaine. Congress established a 100-to-1 
sentencing ratio between the possession of crack and powder cocaine. 
Under this provision, possession of five grams of crack carries a 
minimum sentence five years in federal prison. The same mandatory 
minimum is not reached for any amount of powder cocaine under 500 
grams. John Kerry voted for the measure.

The sentencing disparity in the 1986 law was based on faulty testimony 
that crack was fifty times as addictive as powder cocaine. Congress 
then doubled this ratio as a so-called "violence penalty". Yet there is 
no inherent difference between the drugs, as Clinton drug czar Barry 
McCaffrey was forced to admit. The federal Sentencing Commission, 
established by Congress to review sentencing guidelines, found that 
so-called "crack violence" was largely attributable to the drug trade 
itself and has more to do with the setting in which crack is sold than 
the drug itself: crack is sold on the street, while powder cocaine is 
often vended by house calls.

As Nixon and Haldeman would have approvingly noted, Tip O'Neill's new 
drug law was aimed squared at blacks, reminiscent of the early 
targeting of Chinese smoking opium rather than post-bellum ladies 
sipping their laudanum-laced tonics.

In 1995 the US Sentencing Commission reviewed eight years of 
application of this provision and found it to be undeniably racist in 
practice: 84 percent of those arrested for crack possession where 
black, while only 10 percent were white and 5 percent Hispanic. The 
disparity for trafficking arrests was even wider: 88 percent blacks, 7 
percent Hispanics and 4 percent whites. By comparison, defendants 
arrested for powder cocaine possession were 58 percent white, 26 
percent black and 15 percent Hispanic.

In Los Angeles all twenty-four federal defendants in crack cases in 
1991 were black. The Sentence Commission recommended to Congress that 
the ratio should be one-to-one between sentences for offenses involving 
crack and powder cocaine, arguing that federal law allows for other 
factors to be considered by judges in lengthening sentences (such as 
whether guns or violence was associated with the offense). But for the 
first time in its history the Congress rejected the recommendations of 
the Sentencing Commission and retained the 100-to-1 ratio. Clinton 
likewise declined the advise of his drug czar and his attorney general 
and signed the bill.

One need only look at the racial make-up of federal prisons to 
appreciate the consequences of the 1986 drug law. In 1983 the total 
number of prisoners in federal, state and local prisons and jails was 
600,800. Of those, 57,975 (8.8 percent) were incarcerated for 
drug-related offenses. In 1993 the total prison population stood at 1.4 
million, of whom 353,564-25.1 percent-were inside for drug offenses. 
The Sentencing Project, a DC-based watchdog group, found that the 
increase was far from racially balanced. Between 1986 and 1991 the 
incarceration rate for white males convicted on drug crimes increased 
by 106 percent. But the number of black males in prison for kindred 
offenses soared by a factor of 429 percent, and the rate for black 
women went up by an incredible 828 percent.

The queen of the drug war, Nancy Reagan, said amid one of her 
innumerable sermons on the issue: "If you're a casual drug user, you're 
an accomplice to murder." In tune with this line of thinking, the 
Democratic-controlled Congress moved in 1988 to expand the crimes for 
which the federal death penalty could be imposed. These included 
drug-related murders, and murders committed by drug gangs, which would 
allow any gang member to face the death penalty if one member of the 
gang was linked to a drug killing. The new penalties were inscribed in 
an update of the Continuing Criminal Enterprises Act.

Convictions under the new law between 1989 and 1996 were 70 percent 
white and 24 percent black. But 90 percent of the times the federal 
prosecutors sought the death penalty it was against non-whites: of 
these, 78 percent were black and the rest Hispanic. From 1930 to 1972 
(when the Supreme Court found the death penalty unconstitutional), 85 
percent of those given death sentences were white. When the federal 
death       penalty was reapplied in 1984, with the Anti-Drug Abuse 
Act, the numbers for black death penalty convictions soared. Of those 
on Death Row, both federal and state, 50 percent are black, although 
blacks constitute only 16 percent of the US population.

>> Beyond the Lesser of Two Evils .
>>
>> In 1930 a new department of the federal government, the Bureau of 
>> Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, was       created under the leadership 
>> of Harry Anslinger to carry out the war against drug users. 
>> Anslinger, an avowed racist, was an adroit publicist and became the 
>> prime shaper of American attitudes about drug addiction, hammering 
>> home his view that this was not a treatable addiction but a deviant 
>> urge that could only be suppressed by harsh criminal sanctions.
>>
>> Anslinger's first major campaign was to criminalize the drug commonly 
>> known at the time as hemp. But Anslinger renamed it "marijuana" to 
>> associate it with Mexican laborers who, like the Chinese before them, 
>> were unwelcome competitors for scarce jobs in the Depression. 
>> Anslinger claimed that marijuana "can arouse in blacks and Hispanics 
>> a state of menacing fury or homicidal attack. During this period, 
>> addicts have perpetrated some of the most bizarre and fantastic 
>> offenses and sex crimes know to police annals."
>>
>> Anslinger linked marijuana with jazz and persecuted many black 
>> musicians, including Thelonious Monk, Dizzy Gillespie and Duke 
>> Ellington. Louis Armstrong was also arrested on drug charges, and 
>> Anslinger made sure his name was smeared in the press. In Congress, 
>> the drug czar testified that "coloreds with big lips lure white women 
>> with jazz and marijuana".
>>
>> By the 1950s, amid the full blast of the Cold War, Anslinger was 
>> working with the CIA to charge that the new-born People's Republic of 
>> China was attempting to undermine America by selling opium to US 
>> crime syndicates. (This took a great deal of chutzpah on the part of 
>> the CIA, whose planes were then flying opium from Chiang Kai-Shek's 
>> bases in Burma to Thailand and the Philippines for processing and 
>> export to the US.) Anslinger convinced the US Senate to approve a 
>> resolution stating that "subversion through drug addiction is an 
>> established aim of Communist China".
>>
>> In 1951, Anslinger teamed with Democrat Hale Boggs to marshal through 
>> Congress the first minimum mandatory sentences for drug possession: 
>> two years for the first conviction for possession of a Schedule 1 
>> drug (marijuana, cocaine), five to ten years for a second offense, 
>> and ten to twenty for a third conviction. In 1956 Anslinger once 
>> again enlisted the aid of Boggs to pass a law calling for the death 
>> penalty to be imposed on anyone selling heroin to a minor, the first 
>> linking of drugs with Death Row.
>>
>> This was Anslinger's last hurrah. Along with John Kennedy's New 
>> Frontier cantered sociologists attacking Anslinger's punitive 
>> philosophy. The tempo of the times changed, and federal money began 
>> to target treatment and prevention as much as enforcement and prison. 
>> But the interim didn't last long. With the waning of the war in 
>> Southeast Asia millions of addicted GIs came home to be ambushed by 
>> Richard Nixon's War on Drugs program. Nixon resurrected Anslinger's 
>> techniques of threat inflation, declaring in Los Angeles that "as I 
>> look over the problems of this country I see that one stands out 
>> particularly: the problems of narcotics."
>>
>> Nixon pledged to launch a war on drugs, to return to the punitive

>> 1969, his top aide, H.R.       Haldeman noted in his diary: "Nixon 
>> emphasized that you have to face the fact that the whole problem is 
>> really the blacks. The key is to devise a system that recognizes this 
>> while not appearing to." And the Democratic congress played along.
>>
>> But for all of his bluster, Nixon was a mere prelude to the full fury 
>> of the Reagan-Bush-Clinton years, when the War on Drugs became 
>> explicitly a war on blacks. The first move of the Reagan 
>> administration was to expand the drug forfeiture laws, first passed 
>> in the Carter administration. In 1981 Reagan's drug policy advisors 
>> outlined a plan they thought would be little more than a good PR 
>> sound bite, a public display of the required toughness. They proposed

>> "substitute property"--that is, legally acquired assets equal in 
>> value to illegal monetary gains. They also proposed that the federal 
>> government be permitted to seize attorney's fees that they suspected 
>> might have been paid for through drug proceeds. The Reagan plan was 
>> to permit forfeitures on the basis of a "probable cause showing" 
>> before a federal judge. This meant that seizures could be made 
>> against people neither charged nor convicted, but only suspected, of 
>> drug offenses.
>>
>> Contrary to the administration's expectations, this plan sailed 
>> through Congress, eagerly supported by two Democratic Party liberals, 
>> Senators Hubert Humphrey and Joe Biden, the latter being the 
>> artificer in the Carter era of a revision of the RICO statutes, a 
>> huge extension of the federal conspiracy laws. Over the next few 
>> years the press would occasionally report on some exceptionally 
>> bizarre application of the new forfeiture provisions, such as the 
>> confiscation of a $25 million yacht in a drug bust that netted only a 
>> handful of marijuana stems and seeds. But typically, the press 
>> ignored the essential pattern of humdrum seizures, which more often 
>> focused on such ordinary assets as houses and cars. For example, in 
>> Orange County, California, fifty-seven cars were seized in 
>> drug-related cases in 1989 alone. "Even if only a small amount of 
>> drugs is found inside," an Orange County narcotics detective 
>> explained, "the law permits seized vehicles to be sold by law 
>> enforcement agencies to finance anti-drug law enforcement programs."
>>
>> In fact, the forfeiture program became a tremendous revenue stream 
>> for the police. From 1982 to 1991, the US Department of Justice 
>> seized more than $2.5 billion in assets. The feds confiscated $500 
>> million in property in 1991 alone, and 80 percent of these seizures 
>> came from people who were never charged with a crime.
>>

Calling the law racist is implying that one or more race, color, creed, or 
hue (if you will) is predisposed to rock cocaine while another (obviously 
caucasion in this case) is predispoed to the illicit substance derived from 
the cocca leaf in powder form.


CLEAR racism and prejudice at it's finest.

Weeellll, yeah- but I think people who call such laws racist are going
off of established statistics and demographic information- and they
tend to have the races in question's interests at heart when they say
this, don't they?

Ok, let's call them "classist".  I am not in control of the facts here,
but I would venture to guess that the ratio of rock to powder users
stratifies fairly handily across the economic spectrum.

Bottom line: Coke costs lots of money, crack is relatively cheap. 
Unless Costco starts selling coke in bulk packs or Prada comes out with
a smashing new line of crackpipes for 2005, this fact won't change
much.

So you're saying that people of a certian ethnicity or skin color are "of a 
lower class" or unable to acheive economic equality of those of another skin 
color?

I don't understand how so many cry racism while propagating (is that the 
wrong word?) racial stereotypes and predjuice at the same time. It's been my 
opinion for 15 years that most racists don't even know they prejude people 
by the color of thier skin every day of thier lives.

	Look Gavin, I agree that when you hear somebody crying racism, =
the=20
accusation is misplaced more often than not. But it's a known fact that=20=

black cocaine users tend to favor the rock form of the drug (crack),=20
while whites are more likely to use the powder form. That's not a=20
slight against blacks -- personally I think coke is pretty much bad=20
news in either form -- just reporting the reality. Did you even read=20
the article? Looking at the results of the laws in question, it's=20
pretty obvious that blacks are getting the shaft. Is powder cocaine 100=20=

times worse than crack? Obviously not. So what possible motive is there=20=

for passing a law with that kind of disparity unless the goal is to put=20=

a lot of black people in jail (or go after drugs while keeping whites=20
out of jail)? I think they're just trying to carry out the Nixon=20
philosophy.*

	Not to mention that the "war on drugs" has been notoriously =
racist=20
from the beginning -- way before Harry Anslinger's scheme to raise=20
public fears about Mexicans by using the term "marijuana,"=20
establishment politicians were scaring people with tales of white women=20=

KERRY DENIES PERFORMING GAY WEDDINGS ON SWIFT BOAT

One Million Anti-Kerry Boatmates March on Washington

Democratic nominee John Kerry today blasted a just-released attack ad in which a
new group of swift boat veterans accuse him of performing hundreds of gay
weddings on the boat he commanded during that conflict.

The ad, financed by a group calling itself Swift Boat Veterans For Truth About
Gay Weddings On Swift Boats, accuses Sen. Kerry of using his status as
commanding officer on his boat to perform gay weddings on an almost non-stop
basis.

According to one veteran who appears in the ad, Mr. Kerry stunned his boatmates
by announcing, 'I hereby declare this swift boat "The Love Boat."'

The veteran goes on to accuse Mr. Kerry of performing hundreds of gay weddings
'whether the sailors wanted to marry each other or not.'

The latest charges come at a critical juncture for the Kerry campaign, as over
one million anti-Kerry boatmates marched on Washington this weekend to express
their unbridled hatred of the Democratic nominee.

But Sen. Kerry came out swinging against the ads today, telling a Michigan
audience, 'It would have been impossible for me to declare my swift boat
"The Love Boat" because "The Love Boat" did not come on TV until 1977.'

Moments after Mr. Kerry's comment, the airwaves were blanketed with a new ad
financed by a group calling themselves Swift Boat Veterans For Truth About What
John Kerry Claims Did Or Did Not Happen On His Swift Boat.

In the ad, a veteran states: 'Okay, so maybe John Kerry didn't perform any
gay weddings, but it's a lot like something he would have done if given half

Jack! Lol! I'll have to tell Lewt you called him that! Thanks for representing Osby! This is just the start for Cannabass. All the jaded mothafuckas say the scene is dead. Everyone who came out yesterday was down as fuck. There was even this old guy who took the bus out, whom I remember handing a flyer to at 2am the night before when I hit the DNA, Butter, etc crowds at closing. We had a couple of people who were cruising by on their bikes, and ended up staying for the whole party. We had jungle, we had house, we had live guitar and bass, we had people spinning poi, we had sunshine and we had lots, and lots of beer.

hello, this is a continuation of a fictional piece:

"what's for dessert today, ig?"
"why, it's banana cream pie!"
"mmmm, with lots of cream?"
"yes, one big pie shell, some bananas all chopped up
inside of some fake banana colored yellow pudding and
mixed up with my favorite whipped topping and then
extra dollops of cream on the top...extra creamy..no
mistakes." :)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Spirit of Raving Archives: Q2-2004: What most drew you to the underground scene?

this has nothing to do with this question, but i just wanted to
mention that while waiting for the Kerry interview on The Daily Show, 
http://tinyurl.com/52bsa , i was watching Quentin Tarantino's
'Reservoir Dogs' and there was an exterior shot of the jewelry store
the gang was knocking off, and get this, it's called:

'Karina's Jewelry Wholesalers'

as far as the the 'scene' goes, i'll post on it later.

or not.

'where's the party, Officer?'

briefly, my first inkling that something was up came in the late
1980's through Mick Jone's followup crew to The Clash, Big Audio
Dynamite, (when i heard them sing, 'it's 1am let's go out to a Rave,'
that spoke *volumes* to me, since the paradigm @ the time was that the
party/bar/whatever was ending, not starting at that hour), but i was
in the marine corps @ the time and stationed in Barstow, so there
wasn't a whole fuck of a lot that i could do about it at the time, and
then i compounded the error by dropping out culturally until close to
the end of the decade.

My first underground, not counting the 3 years I was involved with
Studio 10 in NYC @ 10 Bleecker Street from 1979 to 1982, was the
Friday the 13th party in Sunnyvale held by the Enchanted Broccolli
Forest crew from Stanford in Sunnyvale at an old warehouse.

What grabbed my attention that night was the 'chill room.' but not for
the reason most people think.

As you all know, when you go to a club, no such place exists where you
can escape the driving thumpa thumpa thumpa noise and heat and do
nothing but be, and not only hear yourself think but actually interact
with other people.

That's the real threat to our leadership, the last thing they want is
for the populace to freely assemble and trade notes.

Plus, it drives down the sales of alcohol, and we can't have that.

Better to give them the illusion of freedom of assembly' via the drug
of Monday Night Football.

They may say it's the 'drugs' that they are trying to protect people
against, and that's why they passed The Rave Act, but that's a
damnable lie, they just don't want us to mingle, because if we do
that, then well, we might start to get a sense that not only are there
a *lot* of us that thiink and feel alike about certain things, but if
we keep going down this path, we might actually want to DO something
about it.

Like find someone to represent our interests.

If I was a current Congressman or Senator, that would scare the
bullshite right out of me, and I would go out of my way to 'divide and
conquer' this threat, which so far, they've done a great job of doing,
sadly.

then again, time is very much on our side, and ultimately we will
prevail, but it's going to take a long, long, long time.....

Viet Cong Veterans Denounce Kerry

'Sampan Veterans For Truth' Call Kerry Unfit For Command

U.S. - A group of Viet Cong veterans has launched a series of television 
ads denouncing Democratic Presidential nominee John Kerry as being a 'liar' 
and an 'incompetent soldier' whose war record demonstrates his unfitness 
for the Presidency.

The group calls itself 'Sampan Veterans For Truth,' after the small 
canoe-like boats, or sampans, they operated in the Mekong Delta while 
fighting against the U.S. during the Vietnam war. The advertisements blast 
Kerry for allegedly misleading the Navy and the American people about the 
battle in which he earned his Silver Star for heroism under fire.

OMG this is just hilarious.

In the full article:=20

"Nguyen did not explain how the group, which consists mostly of poor,
elderly farmers living in remote Vietnamese villages, could afford the
multimillion-dollar ad campaign, or where they plug in their fax
machine."

"We have absolutely nothing to do with the Sampan Veterans For Truth,"

Howard Rheingold's Latest Connection
The tech guru sees a "new economic system" in the unconscious cooperation 
embodied by Google links and Amazon lists

Updated: 8:00 p.m. ET Aug. 11, 2004

Howard Rheingold is on the hunt again. With his last book, Smart Mobs: The 
Next Social Revolution, in 2001, the longtime observer of technology trends 
made a persuasive case that pervasive mobile communications, combined with 
always-on Internet connections, will produce new kinds of ad-hoc social 
groups. Now, he's starting to take the leap beyond smart mobs, trying to 
weave some threads out of such seemingly disparate developments as Web 
logs, open-source software development, and Google.

Subject: [sfraves] ARR: Smart Raving Mobs (was NRR:  Howard Rheingold's Latest Connection)

Glad to see this book mentioned here as Howard is an
old friend of mine from the virtual reality days and
is an always insightful commentator on technology,
society, psychedelics, religion, and other stuff
generally.  

To bring this around to raves, mobile technology
offers a new paradigm for organizing parties and
rapidly bringing together communities of like minded
souls "on the fly."  We've all heard about flash mobs,
but why not use the same ideas to gather a few
dedicated dancers and heads at that perfect venue?  

I'm wondering if some people are already organizing
parties this way.  Instead of the hand-to-hand
marketing technique of lfiers pioneered by ravers and
party promoters, it might become phone-to-phone
marketing, although I think fliers are still far from
dead.  I'd be interested in working on any effort to
explore some of these ideas if anyone out there wants
to try it.

Peace,

Peter

Yeah, great.  Becuase Virtual Reality and Smart Mobs are *not* just
buzzwords, they are radical outside-the-box new-paradigm disruptive
technologies!  

I mean, look how much Virtual Reality had changed our very existance
on the planet!  Just like they predicted it would!

If you include 3D environments viewed on a screen
(i.e. most video games) the creation of these worlds
is now a bigger industry than the film industry.  That
doesn't include the high end industrial and scientific
applications which have continued to be developed for
the past ten years.  

But I digress...

hello, this is a continuation of a fictional piece (we are mind readers here, just like you!):
 
jane has been with ben for a few months...a few months too long to be with one ugly guy. she got to thinking one night, "if i can have this ugly of ugliest guys, i can probably have any ugly guy i want. i want more samples. i want a REAL ugly guy, but i'm not telling ben anything until the last possible minute. i need to know for SURE that it is a SURE thing. i know i can do it. i am really good at honesty." :)

Just because virtual reality didn't take off in the consumer market
doesn't mean that it hasn't changed our very existence :)  Virtual
Reality is huge.  From Flight training simulations that have probably
saved on actual flying time cutting back on greenhouse gas emmissions as
well as saving lives by running pilots through just about every
emergency they could run into, simulations for nuclear testing in both
military and non-military uses,  aerodynamic design testing, medical and
surgical procedure testing, search and rescue simulations, and of course
military and police training.  I'm not saying all applications of it are
good but it has changed many professions very existence and helped
simulate things that couldn't be tested before without enormous costs
and efforts.  Although I do really miss the video game side of it.

And if you weren't being sarcastic I apologize :)

Yeah, great.  Becuase Virtual Reality and Smart Mobs are *not* just
buzzwords, they are radical outside-the-box new-paradigm disruptive
technologies!  

I mean, look how much Virtual Reality had changed our very existance on
the planet!  Just like they predicted it would!

I predict VR taking off when we can either be fully submersed with zero 
hardware (ie HoloDeck) or we can jack in (ie Matrix)

they're both coming.

When is the Loveparade?

I work with a bunch of German's and I've heard lots of cool things about
the love parade, if we can make it the same here then it could quickly
become the event of the year, every year.

Perhaps I should put a BSP in front of this but....

Tom Wax will be the headliner for the MFS float.  For those of you
unfamiliar with Tom, he was A&R at Harthouse.  He single handedly
invented the Frankfurt Techno scene.  If you are into German techno...
then you definitely don't wanna miss him.  He's probably got the longest
and most respectable discography in all of techno music.  DJs out there
might be familiar with names like AWeX, Arpeggiators, Microbots, DJ Tom
+ Norman.

He is hands down the best DJ I've ever seen, speaking in terms of
technique and programming.  But his true gift to us all has been the
nearly 20 years he has spent delivering the best techno possible.  In
addition to choosing the music that was released on Harthouse, he also
A&Rd for a number of other labels like Influence (the hard-techno label
of Talla's Technoclub outfit), Logic, Tetsuo, and his own label Phuture
Wax has become one of the most respected underground labels ever.  Even
tho he is oldskool compared to most of us (He became resident DJ at
technoclub in Frankfurt in '87) he's somehow managed to stay on the
cutting edge since day one. =20

Yeah I definitely should have put a BSP on this email =3D)

At any rate, in addition to the wet&hard DJs like Corvin Dalek, we will
also be featuring Eiven Major on our float.  For those of you unfamiliar
with Eiven's work...  he is well known for being the most "technoid" of
all of us wet&hard peoples.  If yer into Schranz and that sort of
sound...  you definitely don't wanna miss Eiven Major.  Its still
wet&hard... but I promise that you Schranz fans won't be disappointed.
Just take 1 part Chris Liebing and 3 parts sex and you've got Eiven
Major.  Definitely my personal favorite when it comes to wet&hard... if
you like techno... you don't wanna miss him. =20

And since wet&hard is based on techno... it wouldn't be a stretch to say
our whole float is techno.... =20

Its gonna be nice to have this much techno.  California (unfortunately)
isn't exactly the techno capital of the world.  Its gonna be nice to see
this many techno people playing at the same place.  I don't think I've
seen that too often on this side of the 'pond'....

The future is wet&hard...

Data compression is also a huge thing which is why holographic data
mediums will finally make it affordable for the consumer market (after a
few gen's of course).  Like this thing:
http://www.optware.co.jp/english/what_040823.htm  I think things like a
holodeck are very far off, at least in terms of being able to physically
touch things, but food replicators are being worked on right now by
nasa.  Data jacks are just around the corner scarily.  The initial uses
aren't going to be of the submersion type of course, but more on the
side of helping paralyzed people control a robotic arm like it was a
real arm.  Other uses for this I see being possible of course are
military who has the budget to push technologies like this to the max
with flying aircraft either remotely or without a joystick in the
cockpit for quicker manouverability as well as other types of vehicles
and maybe 'mechs' which are getting closer and closer from their sci-fi
counterparts to science fact.  The science so far has shown that these
implants in monkeys are able to control a robotic arm like it was their
own as opposed to it just being an extension of their body.

I predict VR taking off when we can either be fully submersed with zero 
hardware (ie HoloDeck) or we can jack in (ie Matrix)

they're both coming.

CORVIN!!! CORVIN!!!! CORVIN!!!

I can hear the chants now.. If this years set is anything like the last 
LoveParade.. we will all be very sweaty people ")  I know I will be glued to 
the MFS Float for quite a while.

Does anyone know if there are scheduling commitments being published 
anywhere.. this is the first I have seen.

Perhaps I should put a BSP in front of this but....

Tom Wax will be the headliner for the MFS float.  For those of you
unfamiliar with Tom, he was A&R at Harthouse.  He single handedly
invented the Frankfurt Techno scene.  If you are into German techno...
then you definitely don't wanna miss him.  He's probably got the longest
and most respectable discography in all of techno music.  DJs out there
might be familiar with names like AWeX, Arpeggiators, Microbots, DJ Tom
+ Norman.

He is hands down the best DJ I've ever seen, speaking in terms of
technique and programming.  But his true gift to us all has been the
nearly 20 years he has spent delivering the best techno possible.  In
addition to choosing the music that was released on Harthouse, he also
A&Rd for a number of other labels like Influence (the hard-techno label
of Talla's Technoclub outfit), Logic, Tetsuo, and his own label Phuture
Wax has become one of the most respected underground labels ever.  Even
tho he is oldskool compared to most of us (He became resident DJ at
technoclub in Frankfurt in '87) he's somehow managed to stay on the
cutting edge since day one.

Yeah I definitely should have put a BSP on this email =)

At any rate, in addition to the wet&hard DJs like Corvin Dalek, we will
also be featuring Eiven Major on our float.  For those of you unfamiliar
with Eiven's work...  he is well known for being the most "technoid" of
all of us wet&hard peoples.  If yer into Schranz and that sort of
sound...  you definitely don't wanna miss Eiven Major.  Its still
wet&hard... but I promise that you Schranz fans won't be disappointed.
Just take 1 part Chris Liebing and 3 parts sex and you've got Eiven
Major.  Definitely my personal favorite when it comes to wet&hard... if
you like techno... you don't wanna miss him.

And since wet&hard is based on techno... it wouldn't be a stretch to say
our whole float is techno....

Its gonna be nice to have this much techno.  California (unfortunately)
isn't exactly the techno capital of the world.  Its gonna be nice to see
this many techno people playing at the same place.  I don't think I've
seen that too often on this side of the 'pond'....

The future is wet&hard...

"You are not thinking.  You are merely being logical."
Niels Bohr to Albert Einstein

"The government, which was designed for the people, has got into the hands 
of the bosses and their employers, the special interests.  An invisible 
empire has been set up above the forms of democracy."
-Woodrow Wilson

"The truth is where the truth is, and it's sometimes in the candy store."
-Bob Dylan

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the

visible."

Sure sure, I realize there have been short notice
renegade parties right from the very begining of
raving.  Although I've never been invited to one :(

I was suggesting building a technical/social
infrastructure to facilitate their organization. 
Perhaps employing P2P, WiFi, SMS, e-mail, and/or other
systems.  I don't have a real specific idea, just
throwing BS around...

Peace,

Peter

SFRaves in its early years was this crazy almost-real-time party-throwing
device.

Interesting to consider how /more/, and /properly applied/ technology
could amplify it.

This has nothing to do with James Bond, but when I read this, I
instantly got an image of Tom Cruise in Mission Impossible, speeding
down into that room on a rope, stopping abruptly inches from the floor
with hands full of glowsticks..

Yeah, come on peoples, let's do some parties!

I love how "Groove" starts off with Layla going online to try to find a  ride

"hyperreal" on the screen.  
 
Another good way to do a spontaneous party is to throw one in a big  truck,

SFRaves in its early years was this crazy almost-real-time party-throwing
device.

Interesting to consider how /more/, and /properly applied/ technology
could amplify it.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Seen the RubySkye Lineup Lately?

I saw Dimitri last year @ Ruby Skye, he was really awesome! Half way 
through his set I tired out on the dancefloor & went up the upstairs 
just after last call to find that the entire level was emptied out, so I 
got to listen to him finish his set with the mezzanine pretty much to 
myself, which felt very grandiose.

[Of course, this same night was when I came to the realization that 
people who come to big venues with a big name just to drink need some 
serious sense beaten into them.]

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Seen the RubySkye Lineup Lately?

I never notice many other people when the music is good.. the place can be 
so tightly packed that I have barely enough room to dance.. and I will 
always only notice the people around me and the DJ.  I think I learned to 
block out the swillers, in general.  I mean when it comes down to you and 
the music, who can really get between you and it?  One time I was there when 
Behrouz was spinning and I was on this comfy bed / stage thing with pillows 
right in front of the dj.. crowded house.. staring into this girls eyes at 
2am.. and the next time I looked up.. the room was empty and he was spinning 
for the two of us at 5am :)   Funny how that can happen.. that was luxury.. 
a bed, a girl, a dj, and all of RubySkye just to yourself :) Grandiose 
indeed - I wanna do it again.. lol.

On www.gemm.com.. there's a list of different version of change clothes.
There's a lot of CDs and a few vinyl (last I just checked).

Just go to www.gemm.com.  change the selection to "artist" and put in jay-z.
Select the exact "Jaz-z" link it gives you from a small list and look at all
the listings.  I'm sure it's in there somewhere.

SCOTT BROWN
|| Evolution Records - Scotland || *FIRST BAY AREA APPEARANCE!*
Considered by many around the world as Hardcore's #1 DJ and Producer, Scott 
Brown has achieved more in his career than many in any other genre. He's 
developed his Evolution Records label into what many reguard as the top 
Hardcore label in the world, along with releasing tracks with many of 
Hardcore's top Producers. With massive hits like "ELYSIUM", "NOW IS THE 
TIME", "TURN UP THE MUSIC", and "ICE COLD", chances are if you've been to a 
party in the past 10 years, you've heard his music. As a DJ, he is known for 
his rock solid skills on the decks, often building his sets into energetic 
frenzies that result in mayhem after it's all said and done! This will be 
Scott Brown's first Bay Area Appearance, please join us to make it 
memorable!

DJ HIXXY
|| RaverBaby / HTID / Bonkers - U.K. ||
>From his novice DJ days in 1991 to his International Hardcore Superstar 
status of today, Hixxy has worked long and hard making a name for himself in 
the Hardcore circuit. From his early releases "TOY TOWN" and "WANTING TO GET 
HIGH" to his current hits "TANTRIC" and his remix of "FALLING IN", Hixxy has 
enjoyed enormous success as a Producer. As a DJ, Hixxy helped launch the 
enormously popular "BONKERS" series on React, which continues to break sales 
records for Hardcore CD compilations. His mixes are known to be uplifting 
and energetic, so be ready as we bring Hixxy for a very rare USA appearance!

TOMMYKNOCKER
|| Traxtorm Records - Italy || *FIRST BAY AREA APPEARANCE!*
As one of the fastest rising Hardcore producers today, we are extremely 
excited to bring you Tommyknocker for his first Bay Area Appearance. Hailing 
from Italy, his unique sound has been in demand by all of the world's top 
Hardcore DJs, with hard hittin' releases like "THE AFTERMATH", "REVOLUTION", 
and "DEMOLITION". He is also an accomplished DJ, playing huge events like 
Love Parade, Hellraiser, Megarave, and Masters of Hardcore. If you like your 
Hardcore rough and rugged, Tommyknocker is your man!

DELTA 9
|| Psychotik Records / Adam Recordings - Chicago, IL || *FIRST BAY AREA 
APPEARANCE!*
Quite possibly the biggest name in American Hardcore, Delta 9 is widely 
respected and admired throughout the world of Hardcore. With his early 
releases like "HARDCORE CHICAGO", "HATE TANK", and "REAL HARDCORE", to his 
present material like "DONKEY PUNCH", "NO ESCAPE", and "PUNK LOSER", he 
continues to evolve his style to the Hardcore massive. He has appeared all 
around the globe showcasing his incredible DJ skills and crowd control, 
often taking crowds beyond their peak and back again. We are proud to 
present to you Delta 9 for his first Bay Area Appearance!

DJ VENOM
|| Volume Productions / Topaz Records - Providence, RI || *FIRST BAY AREA 
APPEARANCE!*
Looked upon as one of the most talented Hard DJ's in America, Venom's style 
and persona are only comparible to his music: wild and crazy! He goes 
seamlessly from US Hard House to Hardcore in his mixes, as showcased on such 
top-selling CD compilations as his "RAISE THE VOLUME" series, his "STRAIGHT 
BANGIN" series, and the immensely popular "HOUSE BLEND VOLUME 7-8". From his 
jaw-dropping scratching to his crowd rockin stage displays, it's no wonder 
why Venom is in such huge demand all around the country. We are hyped to 
bring you DJ Venom's first Bay Area Appearance!


CLOUDSKIPPER
|| Raw Elements / KFA / Liquidvinyldjs.com ||
The one, the only. Cloudskipper is widely recognized and respected as one of 
the top Hardcore DJ's in America. With his recent tour of the U.K. as well 
as his very busy touring here in North America, crowds all around the world 
continue to be amazed and captivated by his upfront Hardcore sets. Often 
immitated, never duplicated, Cloudskipper sets the bar other Hardcore DJ's 
will be trying to reach... next year.

DJ TRONIC
|| Resistance Recordings / Liquidvinyldjs.com / BeatSupreme.com ||
Label owner. Producer. DJ. Promoter. Is there anything he doesn't do? 
Probably not. DJ Tronic has continued to build his label Resistance 
Recordings from the ground up, watching it become one of the premiere Hard 
labels in the world with many top DJ's playing his material. All this along 
with his recent touring of France and Spain, as well as his busy touring 
schedule in the USA, it's no wonder why Tronic is such a rising talent.


THE NICE GUYS [NO LEFT TURN & DJ REESE]
|| KFA / Liquidvinyldjs.com ||
When they're not out being nice somewhere, they're out getting drunk. All 
jokes aside, these two are starting to make waves in the Hardcore world, 
with their two upcoming releases on KFA, as well as other material released 
on Raw Elements and Bedlam. Prepare for the Nice Guys, dropping a 
not-so=nice set!

THE NATURAL DISASTERS [THE DOCTOR & RECLIPSE]
|| Bayraves.com / Liquidvinyldjs.com ||
The Doctor and Reclipse, forces in their own right come together to form the 
Natural Disasters. While they're not wrestlers, they drop some of the 
hardest hittin material in the Bay, ranging from DrumNBass to Hardcore to 
Gabber, these two will be shaking the dancefloor HARD!

J-MARR & CARLOS ALFONZO
|| Bayraves.com / Liquidvinyldjs.com / Soop Recordings / BeatSupreme.com || 
[/b]
Alright, the last time we had these two together during a set, they did more 
passing out of food than actually playing. While we can't promise the same 
feast, we can promise a rockin set that only these two can bring!

      Re: [sfraves] Help!  i've fallen and i can't find this record

hi Charlie

i checked gemm.  the reason why i didn't find it is b/c it's a bootleg.

after doing more research, it turns out "Jay-z" is spelled "JZ" and
"Change clothes" is spelled "stained clothes"

needless to say, i bought it.  and i didn't get charged too much (which is
why i usually don't use gemm) thanks.

Jokesters now the go-to guys for U.S. candidates

By JOHN DOYLE
Thursday, August 26, 2004 - Page R2

John Kerry can't do comedy. The world kind of knew that already, but Kerry can 
do bemused politician. This talent might help him in his television appearances. 
It is unlikely to help him change the minds of rabid Republicans who hate his 
stinking guts.

The Kerry-hatred went up a few notches recently and that's why Kerry made a 
surprise appearance on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart on Tuesday night. The 
Daily Show (seen in Canada on CTV, weeknights at 12:05 a.m.) is an American 
cable show, airing on Comedy Central, which spoofs the news. It looks like a 
news program, with its grand opening music signalling puffed-up commentary about 
important issues. But what follows in the show is drenched in irony. It 
simultaneously sends up TV news programs and current events. A good deal of its 
comedy is very childish. Bizarrely, it has become one of the most important 
programs on American television.

A lot of the American coverage of Kerry's appearance on The Daily Show compared 
it with Bill Clinton's appearance on The Arsenio Hall Show 12 years ago. In that 
appearance, Clinton played the saxophone and introduced the Elvis side of his 
personality. It worked wonders for his appeal. Since then, according to cliché, 
every American politician needs to appear on late-night TV in order to show his 
or her loose and funny side.

But Kerry's appearance was not about illuminating his goofy side. It was about 
establishing his integrity. The TV gig, which was only announced on Tuesday 
morning, was an important strategic move. He needed an opportunity to counter 
those people who claim that he exaggerated and lied about his service in Vietnam.

"I watch a lot of the cable news shows," Jon Stewart began, "so I understand 
that you were never in Vietnam."

"That's what I understand too, but I'm trying to find out what happened," Kerry 
deadpanned in response.

In the few minutes that Kerry was on The Daily Show, other subjects came up, but 
that exchange was the most important. And it goes it the heart of the craziness 
of the American political culture today. The presidential election is now less 
about the candidates than it is about the media who cover them. Fox News, the 
most popular cable news channel, has savaged Kerry. In order to challenge the 
perception that he lied and exaggerated, Kerry chose to appear on a comedy 
program that spoofs the news. It was actually designed to give him some integrity.

In the rest of the pseudo-interview, Jon Stewart stuck to his mockery of the 
American media, both print and television, that supports George W. Bush and 
relentlessly attacks Kerry.

"Are you the number one most liberal senator in the Senate?" he barked at Kerry. 
The candidate's answer was a bemused, "No."

As Stewart continued in his ironic tone, Kerry tried to deliver some simple 
statements about his platform and his criticisms of Bush. Twice, he succeeded. 
"Most Americans would like to have an intelligent conversation about the 
issues," he said to cheers from the studio audience. Later, speaking to the 
touchiest issue in the campaign, Kerry managed to get off a round of indignation 
about the war with Iraq. "You don't go to war because you want to," he said. 
"You go to war because you have to." The cheering that greeted that statement 
was cut off as the show went to a commercial.

After that, the chat, as wacky as it had been, went further into ridiculousness. 
There was an incomprehensible exchange about oil. Kerry then closed with a 
cutesy comment about the rigours of political campaigning. "You'd be amazed at 
the number of people who want to introduce themselves to you in the men's room. 
It's the most bizarre part of this entire thing." Then Kerry left the show with 
the trademark military salute.

Kerry is wrong about that. The "most bizarre part of this entire thing" is his 
need to appear on a spoof of the news to answer serious charges against him and 
get his message out. That tells you something about the insanity that has 
gripped the American media. Imagine if the leader of a Canadian political party 
decided, in the middle of an election campaign, to ignore Peter Mansbridge, 
Lloyd Robertson and Kevin Newman, and only do an appearance on This Hour Has 22 
Minutes.

Kerry needed to appear on The Daily Show because the American media itself has 
become ridiculous and he needs the endorsement of the jokers, not political 
pundits. The cable news shows that Jon Stewart mocks have become absurdly 
partisan. The print press is going through a period of self-flagellation as 
newspaper after newspaper apologizes and backtracks on its initial coverage of 
the need to go to war with Iraq.

There is no longer a mainstream media in the United States. Every outlet 
postures and preens. Comedy is now as important as political commentary. Only 
the jokers have integrity.

The last thing Kerry said, as he left The Daily Show, was a remark to Stewart. 
He said, "You do a great job." In that, Kerry was correct. It's sad, but true.

christ.... no wonder they don't go too in depth into the Vietnam War in 
high school social studies, etc.
as I remember, the 60s were just glossed over.  And what are the chances of 
this sort of stuff happening in Iraq?
Certainly not zero.

Libertarian Presidential candidate Michael Badnarik is planning to be

Could the taxpayer financed Republican National Convention be important
enough to suspend Habeas Corpus? Maybe we should suspend the convention
instead.

Of course, I have to remind folks that the Democratic Convention wasn't

	Yeah, back then he was accusing most U.S. soldiers in Vietnam of 
committing atrocities and says he committed them himself. And today he 
is someone who was proud of his service in Vietnam, talks about it 
every chance he gets, and supports the military.

little facial pimple look like Mount Krakatoa about to blow through your
screen.

That's what happened to John Kerry. For 25 years, he told The Boston =20
Globe,
The Washington Post, the United States Senate, and all manner of other
well-known saps about his covert Yuletide operations inside Cambodia
gun-running to anti-communists with his lucky CIA hat. To verify any of =20=

this
would have required a trip to specialist reference libraries, looking up
stuff on eye-straining microfiche, etc. So it was easier to let the old
blowhard yak away and just nod occasionally. Senator Kerry couldn't have
foreseen that Al Gore would invent the Internet, and there'd be this =20
Google
thingy, and all you'd have to do is tap in a few words and a nanosecond
later it would all be at your fingertips - veterans memoirs, Cambodian
history, declassified Johnson administration documents, previous Kerry
"stretchers" (as Mark Twain called them).

The Kerry campaign has now conceded that, by his own contemporaneous
account, the young lieutenant was nowhere near Cambodia in Christmas =20
1968
and, if he was ever on a covert gun-running operation across the border
during his four months in Vietnam, he seems to be the only rookie Swift =20=

boat
lieutenant to land in the territory and get entrusted with such a =20
mission,
and it was evidently so top secret that neither his commanding officers =20=

nor
the men on his own boat knew a thing about it.

Yet the grandees of the US media refuse to show any curiosity about any =20=

of
this, and they think anyone who does is a nut or part of the Republican
"smear machine." When it comes to this newfangled Internet business, =20
they
take the line of Walter Cronkite, the long-retired avuncular anchorman =20=

from
the pre-cable era. Last week, Walter huffed that "he finds that some =20
stories
published on the Web - scandals especially - play too fast and loose =20
with
the facts." As opposed to Walter, who doesn't play fast and loose mainly
because he doesn't produce any facts - not a single specific example - =20=

to
back up his assertion.

And playing fast and loose with the facts may be better than playing as =20=

slow
and tight with them as Walter and his chums do. Right now, some three or
four of his fellow Swift boat veterans back John Kerry, whereas some
hundreds of them oppose him. This in itself is surely rather =20
remarkable. But
Ron Brownstein of The Los Angeles Times deplores the "partisan venom" =20=

of the
election and compares the Swift boat veterans' anti-Kerry commercial to =20=

a
"snuff film." Get a grip, man. Have you ever seen a snuff film? Those
Islamist nutcakes were releasing one a week a couple of months back. =20
Sadly,
the news that some 80% of his fellow Swiftees do not accord Senator =20
Kerry
the same deference the media do is all too ickily "partisan" for Ron. =20=

Maybe
he'd find it all less beastly if he were to take up a position as social
secretary to a dowager duchess. As Lord Charteris, the Queen's courtier,
remarked of Fergie: "Vulgar, vulgar, vulgar." That's Brownstein on the
Swiftees.

So for two weeks, as the Swiftees exposed Kerry's Cambodian fantasies, =20=

the
networks and the "newspapers of record" were like Sherlock Holmes's dog =20=

that
didn't bark - or, in this case, the sheep that didn't baa. Now the =20
silence
of the lambs has been broken. The editorialists at The New York Times =20=

have
deigned to sully, belatedly, their hallowed pages with an =20
acknowledgment of
the existence of the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, if not the =20
substance of
their charges. And this is what the sniffy editorialists - or at least =20=

their
headline writer - have to say:

"Politics as usual."

Well, I should hope so. This is an election campaign, not a coronation -
though you may be confused on that point if you get your news from the =20=

Times
and the networks. Let us stipulate that the snoots at the Times are =20
right -
that the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth are a "Republican-financed group =20=

of
partisans." Just as the handful of Swift boat veterans prepared to =20
support
John Kerry are a Democrat-financed group of partisans. After all, it =20
seems
unlikely that they're picking up their own hotel bills and air fares as =20=

they
travel around the country as his loyal, if small, "band of brothers."

So both groups are "politically motivated." Good for them. That's what
multi-party democracy is all about. The New York Times and CBS News are =20=

also
"politically motivated." So is this column. It's a political column, and
it's "politically motivated." One day I'll start a ballet column, and =20=

that
will be balletically motivated.

So now that we've got all the preening patrician media snobbery out of =20=

the
way, would it be too much to expect so-called political journalists to
investigate Kerry's Cambodian stories? You know, the way they did when =20=

the
comparatively minor question arose of whether Bush was AWOL from his
National Guard base three decades ago. Boy, The New York Times loved =20
that
one:

February 4: "Military Service Becomes Issue in Bush-Kerry Race"

February 11: "The President's Guard Service"

February 13: "Seeking Memories of Bush at an Alabama Air Base"

February 15: "Still the Question: What Did You Do in the War?"

As the Times put it, "Mr. Bush himself also made the issue of military
service fair game by posturing as a swashbuckling pilot when welcoming a
carrier home from Iraq."

Well, the other feller made his military service fair game by posturing =20=

as a
swashbuckling Swift Boat lieutenant to the exclusion of the other 59 =20
years
and eight months of his life. The story now is not John Kerry's weird
secret-agent fantasies but the media's willingness to act as elite =20
guardians
of them. They're his real "band of brothers," happy to fish him out of =20=

their
water, even if their credibility sinks in the process.

Personally, I'm not pushing any political agenda.  I lean more to the Green 
Party platform and last Presidential election I voted Green and have worked 
for local Green Party candidates.  IMHO, the Libertarian Party lacks 
compassion.  Although I would prefer to be living in the Old West, I'm 
not.  The current century requires checks on Darwinian capitalism to keep 
us from drowning in our own filth, and I believe with "freedom" comes many 
responsibilities.  I don't want to see American or other children 
starving;  I believe in free education;  excellent health care should be 
available to everyone...etc.  Compassion.

I'm disgusted with the current administration, but I'm realistic enough to 
see that a Green candidate has no chance to displace this ugly 
regime.  Everyone I know is voting against Bush;  but I find myself in the 
awkward and dishonest position of not really voting for anything.  Others 
feel the same.  At some point I think there will be more folks than the 
Democrats expect (in states like CA) who will just say "fuck it all."

One of the reasons I thought Kerry might be a good Democratic candidate was 
that he told the truth about the heart of darkness that was Vietnam after 
he had served honorably. That took real courage.   His marketing execs, 
however, decided he should repackage himself as a John Wayne/Terminator 
dude and so we get some fool who looks like he's running for President of 
the VFW.  The source of my own disillusionment begins here, after that 
"Kerry reporting for duty" convention bullshit.

I understand Swift Boat Kerry repositioned himself to battle in the milk, 
apple pie and guns states, but he can't assume that his support in the more 
"liberal" blue states will hold with this militaristic positioning.

As for atrocities, it has always been a good thing in the military to 
describe in great detail the "atrocities" committed by one's enemies;  it 
is really bad form to talk about the dirt one's own military shovels.  To 
be sure, atrocities, ie, violations of what we now call the Geneva 
Conventions but prior to that generally agreed upon rules of war, happen in 
every war.  Understand -- war is not a video game.  War unleashes the dark 
side of peoplekind.

Back in the Greek and Roman era it was commonplace to destroy whole cities, 
rape and pillage, and slaughter all the civilians.  As we moved into more 
"civilized" times, relatively speaking, these behaviours tended to be less 
acceptable.  One shouldn't, for example, kill innocent civilians.

WW I and II, however, brought with them the concept of total war.  Not only 
were industrial targets bombed by both sides, but civilian populations were 
targeted as well.  The firebombing of Dresden was more a mind-fucking 
tactic than military necessity;  same with our demonstrations of ultimate 
destruction in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  Atrocities?

Let's take it to the field level.  I don't recall hearing that American 
troops indiscriminately killed German civilians in WW II.  We did, however, 
kill prisoners of war when in challenging military situations, as in the 
Battle of the Bulge.  So did the Germans.  After the war we tried the 
Germans for "war crimes against humanity," and, setting aside the horror of 
genocide and concentration camps, we did hold them accountable for their 
actions in dealing with resistance fighters behind their lines.  One German 
soldier killed by a resistance fighter, ten civilians would be randomly 
selected and shot.  There was evidence that some villages were destroyed, 
with women and children,  in response to resistance activities.  We now see 
the resistance fighters as heros, and we tried the Germans for war 
crimes.  Just, I think.

On to Vietnam.  Those who judged the Germans at Nuremburg, we Americans, 
found ourselves confronted by resistance fighters everywhere in 
country.  Our response was similar to the Germans, and even more barbaric 
at times.  Americans killed women and children;  burned villages;  and even 
cut off ears and other body parts and made necklaces with them.  There were 
clear elements of racism here.  Dark-skinned civilian folks were more 
easily machine-gunned than white Europeans in WW II.  Atrocities?  Yes, I 
think so.  Our national innocence was lost in Vietnam.  Our military was 
disgraced.  Our ideals and our flag went down the toilet.  Someone had to 
stand up for old-fashioned American values and people like Kerry, along 
with millions of students and concerned citizens, finally brought this 
shameful era in our history to an end.  That's patriotism, in my opinion.

Now our military is faced with a similar situation:  placed harms way in a 
country where the distinction between civilian and soldier is unclear, like 
Vietnam.  We have legal types in government who question the validity of 
the Geneva Conventions.  We are,  I believe, on the slippery slope to the 
heart of darkness again, and I wish to hell Kerry, who has a chance to win 
this election, would have the guts to confront these issues as well as 
things much more important than security at any cost:  rising poverty 
levels;  hungry kids;  an educational system in shambles;  environmental 
destruction;  and an unworkable health-care system to name a few.

Love,

Apollo

Bush.  If he can, we will find out and then chastise him...but for now...I 
think the wise thing is to get people who stir up complete chaos within an 
entire world out of office...at least untill Kerry proves us wrong (which it 
is almost impossible to do as bad and wrong as Bush)
God created few stupid creatures, Bush is one of them.  I wont even get into

for that, please...by all means feel guilty.

	Isn't one of the big criticisms of Bush that he is only capable of 
seeing the world in good and evil, black and white terms, "you're 
either with us or against us?"

	How ironic then that some of his critics seem to exhibit the same type 
of thinking themselves! In this view, politics is black and white: 
Democrat=good, Republican=evil, you're either with us or against us, 
I'm not going to listen to anything bad about "my" candidate or 
anything good about another candidate -- and to them there is only one 
other candidate, since they refuse to acknowledge the possibility of 
more than two points of view. If you're not for Kerry, you must be for 
Bush.

*The Curse of Dick Cheney

The veep's career has been marred by one disaster after another

*Extract:

Should George W. Bush win this election, it will give him the distinction 
of being the first occupant of the White House to have survived naming Dick 
Cheney to a post in his administration. The Cheney jinx first manifested 
itself at the presidential level back in 1969, when Richard Nixon appointed 
him to his first job in the executive branch. It surfaced again in 1975, 
when Gerald Ford made Cheney his chief of staff and then -- with Cheney's 
help -- lost the 1976 election. George H.W. Bush, having named Cheney 
secretary of defense, was defeated for re-election in 1992. The ever-canny 
Ronald Reagan was the only Republican president since Eisenhower who 
managed to serve two full terms. He is also the only one not to have 
appointed Dick Cheney to office.

This pattern of misplaced confidence in Cheney, followed by disastrous 
results, runs throughout his life -- from his days as a dropout at Yale to 
the geopolitical chaos he has helped create in Baghdad. Once you get to 
know his history, the cycle becomes clear: First, Cheney impresses someone 
rich or powerful, who causes unearned wealth and power to be conferred on 
him. Then, when things go wrong, he blames others and moves on to a new 
situation even more advantageous to himself.

"Cheney's manner and authority of voice far outstrip his true abilities," 
says Chas Freeman, who served under Bush's father as ambassador to Saudi 
Arabia. "It was clear from the start that Bush required adult supervision 
-- but it turns out Cheney has even worse instincts. He does not understand 
that when you act recklessly, your mistakes will come back and bite you on 
the ass."

Cheney's record of mistakes begins in 1959, when Tom Stroock, a Republican 
politician-businessman in Casper, Wyoming, got Cheney, then a senior at 
Natrona County High School, a scholarship to Yale. "Dick was the 
all-American boy, in the top ten percent of his class," Stroock says. "He 
seemed a natural." But instead of triumphing, Cheney failed. "He spent his 
time partying with guys who loved football but weren't varsity quality," 
recalls Stephen Billings, an Episcopalian minister who roomed with him 
during Cheney's freshman (and only full) year at Yale. "His idea was, you 
didn't need to master the material," says his other roommate, Jacob 
Plotkin. "He passed one psych course without attending class or studying, 
and he was proud of that. But there are some things you can't bluff, and 
Dick reached a point where you couldn't recover."

Apollo,

	It sounds to me like your political agenda is to get people to =
vote=20
for Kerry. That's all right. It's OK to have an agenda.  8)  "If you=20
don't stand for something, you'll go for anything," as the saying goes.=20=

At least you've thought about things enough to have a viewpoint, and=20
you care enough to try to convince others to think the way you do.

	But as far as systems go, I'd rather have real "Darwinian =
capitalism,"=20
where you have a market ecosystem evolving toward something positive,=20
than "Monotheistic socialism" where government plays God. Competition=20
in the marketplace doesn't have to mean a lack of caring about other=20
people, in fact the opposite is more true. When businesses have to=20
compete with each other for your dollars, the customer is more likely=20
to experience positive, friendly service and sincere attention to her=20
needs. When you have to deal with a monopoly like a government agency,=20=

that's when you're more likely to encounter rude, condescending=20
attitudes and a lack of caring. Admittedly this can tend to be the case=20=

with large corporations also. I'm not a fan of corporations, and I=20
agree that they shouldn't have the status of persons under the law. But=20=

at least with them you have the choice of taking your business=20
elsewhere. With government, you're pretty much stuck.

	And I strongly disagree that the Libertarian Party lacks =
compassion.=20
It's easy to have "compassion" when you're relying on someone else to=20
coercively take and spend other peoples' money. That's not real=20
compassion. It's not compassionate to say "tax the wealthy," or "let's=20=

have another government program." Giving your *own* money to help=20
people, or volunteering your *own* time, now that is compassion.=20
Libertarians are trying to reduce the burden of government on people so=20=

that they have more time and money left over to help others after=20
providing for themselves and their own families.

	If you have any experience with non-profits, you probably know =
that=20
when there's an economic slump and people are earning less, charitable=20=

giving decreases. When people are doing better, they give more to=20
support organizations in their communities that are helping the poor,=20
making art, providing educational resources, etc. Reduce the amount=20
that the middle man (government) skims off the top, and there will be=20
more to go around. We don't need poverty pimps!

	I agree with most of your historical analysis. War is awful, and=20=

events like the bombing of Dresden and Hiroshima, and some of the=20
actions committed by U.S. government soldiers in Vietnam were=20
unnecessary atrocities. I don't like to refer to the U.S. as "our"=20
country any more however. I'm done with nationalism. My commitment is=20
to freedom, not to the United States. The U.S. government simply=20
happens to exercise control over that portion of the earth's surface in=20=

which I happen to live and spend most of my time. It is not "mine"; I=20
did not vote for the people running it. Though some governments are=20
clearly better than others, and the U.S. government allows more freedom=20=

than most, I view every existing state as fundamentally illegitimate=20
since they are all based on coercion.

	 Have you seen the flash animation at=20
http://www.isil.org/resources/introduction.swf ? That offers as good a=20=

look as anything at where I'm coming from.

Sincerely,
				<<< Starchild >>>

My post reflected my own ambivalence about "voting" for Kerry.  As I stated 
quite clearly, I don't believe I'm voting for something good this time 
around, just voting against a disgusting regime.

Nothing is either/or, black or white.  Superior systems evolve from a 
conflict of opposing ideas.  A dialectic.  Neither capitalism as we know 
it, or socialism as it was, will take us into the future in my 
opinion.  Something better will evolve.

I have not found that to be true.  Especially when it comes to the 
environment.  But let's take a personal experience I had lately with 
Sears.  Bought a very expensive fridge a few years ago.  Thing died three 
weeks ago.  I call Sears and the customer service rep tried to sell me a 
"bet "warranty.  Give us $300 in advance, and if we can't repair it the 
money will go towards a new fridge.  Ha.  I tell her this is an 
emergency.  My food is going bad.  Best appointment I can get with a 
service rep is four days down the road.  Food rots and is tossed.  Rep 
comes.  Evaluates the situation.  Needs a $27.00 part he doesn't 
have.   This must be shipped from a warehouse in the East.  One week later, 
the part and rep arrives.  Part doesn't work.  Requires another part from 
another warehouse in the East.  Yet another week passes.  I'm fighting with 
Sears Corp at this point.  Have to buy a smaller fridge to keep basic 
necessaries.  Finally, after three weeks the fridge is working again.

What have I learned.  Higher worker productivity means fewer service reps 
in the field = my food rots while I try to get an overworked former IT guy 
now a fridge repair person for an appointment.  Consumer 
satisfaction?  Shit.  Inventory control on demand.  MBA decides to save 
some money by having parts strewn about all over the country.  I must 
suffer.  I could go on.  I'm happy your experiences with consumer products 
and service have been so positive.  In the past a Sears fridge would last 
twenty years, and the rep came the same day if there was a problem and had 
the parts to repair it.  But then, doctors came to your home and the 
pharmacy delivered.

The statistics don't back up your assertion that charitable giving was up 
during our recession.  It was down.  And non-profit giving has nothing to 
do with the government skimming off the top.  Donations go directly to the 
charitable organizations, many of whom pay their execs fabulous salaries.

My commitment is to freedom also, but with the understanding that we are 
not free to kill others, steal from them, take away their pension funds by 
cooking the books, and trashing the environment to realize short-term 
profitability and personal gain.  Furthermore, states only exist as long as 
the people allow them to do so.  Neither you or I are coerced.  We assent 
to be governed.  Collectively.  Hitler didn't come into power because he 
got together some thugs with guns and coerced Germans into following him.

Bottom line -- I don't think most people really want freedom.  History 
clearly demonstrates this.  Sixty years ago most of Europe was not free.  I 
think there were five democracies in the world.  People have shown time and 
again that they prefer security to freedom, or at least the illusion of it.

As for me, if there were still some ungoverned, wild spaces left on this 
earth I would be packing my loincloths and heading for them.

Yes, you posted it to this list before.

I'm finished with this.

Sorry.  I misread this section of your post.  Too much multitasking these 
days.  I should read more carefully.  And yes, people do give more when 
they make more money.  One of the obvious reasons for this are the tax 
deductions available for charitable giving.   Seen this way, government 
incentivizes compassion.  Would this compassion exist without the tax break?:)

I do agree with some of the libertarian platform, but my major problem is 
with, again, compassion.  If we all lived in a society with shared, strong 
ethical beliefs and practices I think some competitive free-for-all might 
be in order.  We had less controls on business in the nineteenth and early 
twentieth centuries --  along with children working in factories, massive 
exploitation of workers, twelve-hour work days and seven day 
workweeks.  People, I think, don't live to work but work to live.  We seem 
to be moving back to the pre-union dark ages, tho these days workers wear 
Polo blue collars.  Without some checks and balances a few would have us 
all working like serfs again.

But ethics.  Religion as a motivational force is dead in the old industrial 
countries.  What "morality"  remains of the old codes is focused on sex and 
pleasure rather than greed and giving.

In business one finds the cost benefit analysis ethical structure.  For 
example, I will pay a fine of $1MM if I break a law and screw the consumer 
but I stand to make $30MM.  What to do?  I worked for a Fortune 100 
financial services corporation.  We violated the law, paid the fine, made 
the money until a cease and desist order was issued, and then sent some 
unreadable account update to the customers more in agreement with 
Regulation Z.  Enron and others moved even further.  Lies, deceit, and 
criminal activity are often rewarded in a Darwinian capitalist structure.

Private morality seems to have moved in that direction:  situational ethics 
founded on the belief that as long as I as an individual flourish virtually 
anything is permitted as long as I don't end up in jail.  The commonweal is 
secondary to the needs of often greedy individuals.  Take away whatever 
checks and balances are left and we all end up living in a very unpleasant 
jungle.

Love,

Apollo

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) Why The Rep. Convention is in NYC.

Of course Bush would have to do something completely drastic to his 
administration to have anyone really give him a solid vote.

So then why would the convention be in City where ONLY 1-6 People are 
Republicans ?

B/c Bush is going to nominate Rudy Giuliani as his running mate.

That's what I think.

You heard it here first.

I think if Bush was really going to drop Cheney, they would have started
trumping up his health problems by now to provide a good exuse.

Bush dropping Cheney is like, um, Kermit dropping Jim Henson.  Hows
that for an on-the-fly metaphor?

Subject: [sfraves] santa cruz full moon parties and such

I just bought a house in the Santa Cruz mountains and would like to
check out some of the outdoor events that happen in that county (since
i now live so close)...  i know that every now and then i see a review
on this list of such parties so i thought i would query the list for
any links to website or mailing lists.  any info would be greatly
appreciated (off list would probably be preferred).

p.s. i checked wicked's website but it seems that their mailing list
no longer exists on Topica's servers.

I live in Santa Cruz as well and I know once a month they have full moon 
parties up in the mountains. They are usually pretty fat, lots of people and 
electronic music. I can ask my flatmate for the website. I dont know of too much 
going on out there, but if you hear of more I would be very interested as well. 
Maybe you could email me and let me know. Thanks.

13 Moontribe is still very active in SC.  They have a "tribe" on Tribe.net 
and that might be the place to make some connections.

Wicked split up a few months ago.  The last successful FMR they did was 
three years ago;  their final FMR was busted twice in Santa Cruz county a 
couple of years back.

a lot of non-republicans go to the republican
convention, opposed to the democratic one, because
instead of just schmoozing around and making
connections with buddies, they go to learn whats going
on with the republican party and whatnot...

The original is a disco record.

Sweetness - "Last Night A DJ Saved My Life"
Label: Rams Horn Records
Catalog#: RAMSH 12-3180
Format: 12"
Country: Netherlands
Released: 1983

Or this....

Indeep - "Last Night A DJ Saved My Life"
Label: Sound Of New York
Catalog#: SNYL1
Format: 12"
Country: UK
Released: 1982
Note: All tracks mixed by Tony Humphries


I think these are both the same thing and I GUESS you could call them house. 
But it was straight up disco.

AUDi,
Gavin

Subject: [sfraves] BSP:  Evil Breaks presents...DIRTY w/ TRONA - September 25th

Evil Breaks presents:
DIRTY

@ Shadow Lounge, 299 9th and Folsom
Friday, September 25th
$5 before 11pm, $10 after

Flyer:  http://www.invibe.com/dirty/dirty_800.jpg

Featuring:

Trona (Moonshine, i-lektrick (UK), www.tronaonline.com) North Carolina

Hailing from North Carolina, Trona is without a doubt one of the best and 
most established breakbeat producers the US has to offer. Although hes 
known throughout the southeast for his bass heavy and electro-funk 
selections, he is also one of the key players in the deep progressive arena 
which can be heard from his releases on Moonshine, his remix of Icelandic 
pop group Gus Gus, and his current collaborations with the west coast band 
Cirrus. Tronas first release on Moonshines GREEN imprint found a place in 
many dj charts overseas. His 2nd release Dangerous was to go even further 
by getting radio play by Whole Nine Yards Dark Globe. He ended 2003 with 
one of his most solid releases to date Rhythm Man (turn up) with the 
insanely brilliant Insanity to back the release. One can only expect the 
best that breakbeat has to offer when Trona is in performance.

Police defend handling of illegal rave

EDWARD FOSS

30 August 2004 16:50

Norfolk police defended the way they dealt with an illegal rave on private
land which attracted hundreds of young partygoers.

And a senior officer said lessons learnt from the latest in a string of
similar outdoor events could feed into future policy for dealing with such
incidents.

The rave, held on the idyllic North Norfolk clifftop near Weybourne, led to
damage to gates, fields and the cliff edge. From the site, adjacent to the
Norfolk Coast Path, it was possible to see ex-Prime Minister John Major's
house, approximately a mile away on the hillside.

The irate farmer, whose land was crossed by hundreds of vehicles over the
weekend, said the incident had already cost him money in repairs and
possible loss of value of his crops, because he has been unable to harvest.

Similar parties have been held in the last few weeks across Norfolk,
including at Brancaster beach, Thetford Forest and Sandringham. All have
attracted police attention and local anger.

The police have been criticised by landowners for the way they have
responded to the events, but Supt Vaughan Mullender said officers had to
respond in a "proportionate and pragmatic way".

He said it was important to ensure public safety and to minimise disruption
and damage.

"We see what lessons can be learned and we learn from each of these
incidents," said Supt Mullender.

"We have to take that proportionate approach when dealing with these things
and look at all the surrounding circumstances."

Supt Mullender also said it was conceivable that the lessons learnt could
eventually lead to a change of policy.

He said officers reacted "very positively" to the Weybourne rave, which
police officially described as a 'party'.

"We are happy with the way it was dealt with," said Supt Mullender.

Jim Wilson, chairman of Norfolk Police Authority, said the issue was an
operational matter and it was not in the remit of the authority to comment.

But he added that such incidents were generally cases of management.

"Wherever possible the police manage these things in a way to try and
ameliorate the disturbance."

Mr Wilson said breaking up a party once scores or hundreds of people were
there would take an "awful lot" of manpower.

Up to 800 people were understood to have been at the Weybourne rave at its
height. The event started on Saturday morning and was continuing Monday
night.

John Perry-Warnes, county council representative on the police authority,
said he was very sorry that the landowner had experienced "considerable
inconvenience right in the middle of harvesting and cultivating".

He added that the rave had been "thoroughly well planned" and that the
organisers had "in a way outmanoeuvred us".

Farmer Clive Hay-Smith, who farms 1200 acres, felt better policing of the
rave in its very early stages could have prevented it going ahead.

"I do think they should have been jumped on earlier. The first group was
fairly small, it wasn't as if all these people turned up at once."

Mr Hay-Smith said some of the behaviour he had seen defied belief,
explaining that he had seen a father in a Mercedes dropping his daughter off
at the party and one of the ravers asking him what he was doing there ­ even
though he was on his own land.

He was also angry that he had been unable to harvest a neighbouring field of
barley over the weekend, which could now lose quality and therefore value in
the coming days.

"We were lined up to cut it on Saturday, but for health and safety reasons
we decided we just could not.

"I was worried there could have been someone out of it and asleep in the
field and they wouldn't hear the machinery coming.

"To be honest the whole thing is a mess, I can't tell you how angry I have
been ­ and all in a year when the harvest has been hard enough as it is."

However Mr Hay-Smith was determined to cut the remainder of his crop, about
100 acres, in the coming days.

Over the weekend, bemused walkers were greeted with a rag-tag gathering of
tents, cars, vans, music systems, a stack of giant speakers and empty cans
strewn on the ground as they made their way along the well-trodden coast
path.

Generally pleasant and polite, those attending the rave were mainly young,
aged either in their teens or 20s.

There was a certain amount of tidying being done on Monday afternoon, but
there were still plenty of cans, bottles, cigarette butts and other rubbish
lying across a large area.

The group who appeared to have organised the rave declined to comment, but
one raver, who identified himself simply as Will, said: "We're just having
fun, there's no houses that close by. What's the problem?"

Subject: Re: [sfraves] name the track

I have it..

if it is the one im thinking of? Male vocal came out about a year or 2 ago.. 
it is like a junkie XL remix or something like that.. a prog version at 
least the one I have is.. Very Dubby not diso-esque at all. But still keeps 
the song structure but with a bit more tribal percussion. I don't really 
recall the artist cause I don't really like that track.. it is more of a 
filler track but goes nicely cause of the percussion.

Label owner. Producer. DJ. Promoter. Is there anything he doesn't do? 
Probably not. DJ Tronic has continued to build his label Resistance 
Recordings from the ground up, watching it become one of the premiere Hard 
labels in the world with many top DJ's playing his material. All this along 
with his recent touring of France and Spain, as well as his busy touring

THE NICE GUYS [NO LEFT TURN & DJ REESE]
|| KFA / Liquidvinyldjs.com ||

jokes aside, these two are starting to make waves in the Hardcore world, 
with their two upcoming releases on KFA, as well as other material released 
on Raw Elements and Bedlam. Prepare for the Nice Guys, dropping a 
not-so=nice set!

THE NATURAL DISASTERS [THE DOCTOR & RECLIPSE]
|| Bayraves.com / Liquidvinyldjs.com ||

Gabber, these two will be shaking the dancefloor HARD!

J-MARR & CARLOS ALFONZO
|| Bayraves.com / Liquidvinyldjs.com / Soop Recordings / BeatSupreme.com || 
[/b]
Alright, the last time we had these two together during a set, they did more 
passing out of food than actually playing. While we can't promise the same 
feast, we can promise a rockin set that only these two can bring!

"A new poll says that if the election were held today, John  Kerry would
beat President Bush by a double digit margin. The White House is  so
worried about this, they're now thinking of moving up the capture  of
Osama Bin Laden to next month."
-- Jay Leno

President Bush has  unveiled his first campaign commercial, highlighting
all of his  accomplishments in office. That's why it's a 60-second spot."
-- Jay  Leno

"President Bush says he has just one question for the American  voters,
'Is the rich person you're working for better off now than they  were
four years ago?'"
-- Jay Leno

"Kerry is well on his way to  reaching his magic number of 2,162. That's
the total number of delegates he  needs to win the Democratic nomination.
See, for President Bush it's  different. His magic number is only 5.
That's the number of Supreme Court  judges needed to win."
-- Jay Leno

"There was a scare in Washington  when a man climbed over the White
House wall and was arrested. This marks the  first time a person has
gotten into The White House unlawfully since  President Bush."
-- David Letterman

"The White House is now  backtracking from its prediction that 2.6
million new jobs will be created in  the U.S. this year. They say they
were off, by roughly 2.6 million  jobs.."
-- Jay Leno

"In Louisiana, President Bush met with over 15,000  National Guard
troops. Here's the weird part: nobody remembers seeing him  there."
-- Craig Kilborn

"President Bush said he was 'troubled' by gay  people getting married in
San Francisco. He said on important issues like  this the people should
make the decision, not judges. Unless of course we're  choosing a
president, then he prefers judges."
-- Jay Leno

"There  was an embarrassing moment in the White House earlier today.
They were  looking around searching for George Bush's military records.
They actually  found some old Al Gore ballots."
-- David Letterman

"The big story now  is that President Bush is coming under attack for
his service in the National  Guard. The commanding officers can't
remember seeing Bush between May and  October of '72. President Bush
said, 'Remember me? I'm the drunk guy.'"
--  Jay Leno

"On 'Meet the Press' yesterday President Bush was asked what he  would
do if he lost the election and Bush said, 'You mean like last  time?'"
-- Jay Leno

"This week, both John Kerry and Wesley Clark are  making campaign
appearance with the guys who saved their lives in Vietnam.  Meanwhile,
President Bush is campaigning with a guy that once took a math  test for
him."
-- Conan O'Brien

"President Bush released his new  $2.4 trillion federal budget. It has
two parts: smoke and mirrors."
-- Jay  Leno

"Bush admitted that his pre-war intelligence wasn't what it should  have
been. We knew that when we elected him!"
-- JayLeno

"As you  know President Bush gave his State of the Union Address,
interrupted 70 times  by applause and 45 times by really big words."
-- Jay Leno

"President  Bush said that American workers will need new skills to get
the new jobs in  the 21st century. Some of the skills they're going to
need are Spanish,  Chinese, and Korean, because that's where the jobs
went."
-- Jay  Leno

"President Bush wants to build a space station on the moon. And  from
the moon, he wants to launch people to Mars. You know what this  means.
He's drinking again."
-- David Letterman

"Former Treasury  Secretary Paul O'Neill has written a book about his
years with the Bush  Administration. He said that President Bush, while
at cabinet meetings is  disengaged, he's uninformed, distracted, he's
passive. And the Democrats are  saying to themselves "How can we possibly
beat this guy?"
-- David  Letterman

"The new Prime Minister of Spain has called the war in Iraq a  disaster,
and plans to bring his troops home as soon as possible. In  fact,
President Bush is so upset at Spain that he is now threatening to  close
down the border between Spain and the US."
-- Jay  Leno

"Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge has unveiled a new  color-coded
system to warn the public about different states of danger. Red  is the
highest state of alert, and it means that Dick Cheney is about to eat  a
mozzarella stick."
-- Conan O'Brien

"Dick Cheney finally  responded today to demands that he reveal the
details of the Enron meetings.  This is what he said. 'He met with
unnamed people, from unspecified  companies, for an indeterminate amount
of time, at an undisclosed location.'  Thank God he cleared that up." - -
Jay Leno

"Plans are being discussed  as to who will replace Dick Cheney if he has
to resign for health reasons.  It's not easy for President Bush. He can't
just name a replacement. He would  first have to be confirmed by the oil,
gas and power companies."
-- Jay  Leno

"President Bush spoke briefly to reporters before playing a round  of
golf in Crawford, Texas, earlier today. This raises the  question:
Shouldn't the guy who is really running the country and who has had  like
20 heart attacks be taking the vacation?"
-- Craig  Kilborn

"The White House has now released military documents they say  prove
George Bush met his requirements for the National Guard. Big deal,  we've
got documents that prove Al Gore won the election."
-- Jay  Leno
