just taking time out from the column to formally offer up that apology that so many are craving. it is nice when someone finally says that they are sorry, isn't it? so, sometimes, like yesterday, i might be sitting right in front of the computer, right in the e-mail pit, and i might just decide not to post the story, even though, it is easy enough to do.  that is what has been happening occasionally. so, yes, it was straight up defiant of me and all, but i am sorry. :)

interesting, but sounds -*ahem*- like much ado about nothing,

k.i.s.s. method: http://www.emit.cc/interview/2003-03-dsimpson.jsp

this guy's been doing live space binaural for quite a while now -with modest equipment, and
excellent results. go download his recordings and take a listen for yourselves.

binaural recordings are grate !

Well, this sound a bit like a shotgun marriage between Binaural
recording and VR (or worse, QuickTime VR ;), in a way-  I can see,
however, where when tiny movements of your head translate into
resultant changes in the orientation of the sound you hear, there might
be some kind of psychoacoustic effect of "putting you in the space",
even if you normally wouldn't give a shit about turning in your seat in
the symphony hall.

An interesting idea nonetheless- surround microphones built into
spheres (multiple mic elements) have been around for some time, but
they've never been tied to some sort of encoding matrix to allow
headphone steering..  Some people just have wacky ideas.

My only worry is that those 16 microphones had better be stringently
calibrated and mounted with a jeweller's attention to spacing and
orientation, or the resultant phase issues would cause ripples in the
3d space, kind of a buzzkill.

in a river the color of lead
immerse the baby's head
wrap her up in the News of The World
dump her on a doorstep girl

this night has opened my eyes
and i will never sleep again

you kicked and cried like a bullied child
a grown man of 25
oh he said he would cure your ills
but he didn't and he never will

so
save your life
because you've only got one
the dream is gone but the baby is real
oh you did a bad thing
she could have been a poet or should could have been a fool
oh you did good thing

and i'm not happy and i'm not sad

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Sound With Space and Motion

well, i agree 100%...  the turning of your head, or moving through space, or whatever, *will* cause
psycho-acoustical variations -some of which *could* be calculated and adjusted for with 16 inputs
and mixed with in some impact-plane and difraction-delay estimated fashion- but is it smarter than
one's own ear ?

the binaural recordings ximm and many of simpson's are made by placing the microphones *inside*
their own ears, while allowing them to move freely... thereby representing nearly the exact
psycho-acoustical representation of their own listening experience, and presenting it to the
listener.

so the question is, which is more accurate... a subjectively processed and error-prone pseudo-mixed
down binaural representation of what is actually happening, or a direct binaural recording of what
*is* actually happening ?

..one dumb head an'two microphoooooones....

I'm not 100% sure, but can we really say that our timpanic membrate and
all those little hairs work exactly the same as a microphone? Probably
not, probably more like a million little microphones each with a small
frequency range reception pointed in different directions in the ear
canal. Also, what about sound that filters through your sinus cavities
from your nose and mouth? Isn't that connected to the ear also?=20

Subject: Re: [sfraves] delta 9 changed my life

I thought he had stopped playing the hardcore, moved to LA and started 
playing generic techno (or was that TRON?) I know the last record I picked 
up from delta9 was some slow ass techno, not the style I loved on DISCO 
INFERNO.

If I am wrong let me know and I am there!

Speaking of turntables, do you guys think that DJ's that only mix with
the pitch (like me) and never touch the vinyl and going to wear out
their pitch slider a lot faster? BTW - I use M3D's that don't have a
zero lock, but a button instead.

Probably a dirty pitch slider.

No, it's not power fluctuations.  I've run decks off of really bad
power,
the sound system is browning out, the lights will stop working, but
the mix still sticks.

Hit the slider with the Caig stuff.

If it's near your 0 point, it's likely that you're drifting between the
pitch being locked and not locked (looking at the platter dots, is it
going from perfectly motionless to a slight drift?).  Basic zero adjust
(the easiest service to do on 1200s, you can do it yourself) should help
or fix it altogether.  Also, get in the habit of leaving your tables at
0
lock when not playing them.  That way, any wear at the point the slider
is
left at is at a point where it's not being used.

Those things are surprisingly durable.  Mine have been to at least a 100
parties/outdoors/clubs/houseparties and never have required service.
I've
pitched them up and down again (although ALWAYS TURN OFF THE DECK WHEN
YOU
TAKE OFF THE PLATTER... you can kill a 1200 that way), and they feel
better than when I brought them home new.

vinyl, whoooo!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Sound With Space and Motion

i think i missed your point steve

mine was that a binaural in-ear mic system seems as if it would, 1) be simpler, 2) do a better job,
and 3) have ample previous work cited, than the capturing of this complex audio environment by the
16-microphone arrangement with outboard "mystery" processing that the article showcases as
"innovative."

i assume you're saying it's not possible at all ?  well nothing is "perfect" but if we got 100%
caught up in that, none of us would listen to anything but live music.

regardless... the more research into audio capture and reproduction, the better...  music is grate !

I'm not 100% sure, but can we really say that our timpanic membrate and

not, probably more like a million little microphones each with a small
frequency range reception pointed in different directions in the ear
canal. Also, what about sound that filters through your sinus cavities
from your nose and mouth? Isn't that connected to the ear also?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Sound With Space and Motion

well, i agree 100%...  the turning of your head, or moving through
space, or whatever, *will* cause
psycho-acoustical variations -some of which *could* be calculated and
adjusted for with 16 inputs
and mixed with in some impact-plane and difraction-delay estimated
fashion- but is it smarter than
one's own ear ?

the binaural recordings ximm and many of simpson's are made by placing
the microphones *inside*
their own ears, while allowing them to move freely... thereby
representing nearly the exact
psycho-acoustical representation of their own listening experience, and
presenting it to the
listener.

so the question is, which is more accurate... a subjectively processed
and error-prone pseudo-mixed
down binaural representation of what is actually happening, or a direct
binaural recording of what
*is* actually happening ?

.one dumb head an'two microphoooooones....

I can tell you, Steve, that I mix primarily with the pitch and I've been 
using 1200s since they were introduced:  never had the slider wear out on me.

I do, however, periodically lubricate the sliders on my tables and mixers.

Speaking of turntables, do you guys think that DJ's that only mix with
the pitch (like me) and never touch the vinyl and going to wear out
their pitch slider a lot faster? BTW - I use M3D's that don't have a
zero lock, but a button instead.

Probably a dirty pitch slider.

No, it's not power fluctuations.  I've run decks off of really bad
power,
the sound system is browning out, the lights will stop working, but
the mix still sticks.

Hit the slider with the Caig stuff.

If it's near your 0 point, it's likely that you're drifting between the
pitch being locked and not locked (looking at the platter dots, is it
going from perfectly motionless to a slight drift?).  Basic zero adjust
(the easiest service to do on 1200s, you can do it yourself) should help
or fix it altogether.  Also, get in the habit of leaving your tables at
0
lock when not playing them.  That way, any wear at the point the slider
is
left at is at a point where it's not being used.

Those things are surprisingly durable.  Mine have been to at least a 100
parties/outdoors/clubs/houseparties and never have required service.
I've
pitched them up and down again (although ALWAYS TURN OFF THE DECK WHEN
YOU
TAKE OFF THE PLATTER... you can kill a 1200 that way), and they feel
better than when I brought them home new.

vinyl, whoooo!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] delta 9 changed my life

yeah it is true d9 was doing more house style, but now he's been doing
more "nu style" which i don't know if many of ya'll know about but it's
more of a slower dutch type style he just put a record out with tron in
that style.  tron's label blood n' guts was one of my favorites back in
1997 / 98... some good hc shit!

Hi everyone, I'll be in the front room at 1015 tonight, Friday, at 10pm. 
    If you see me there, say hi and pick up an iamthedj.com sticker.

Also, mark your calendar for August 20th, when I'm scheduled to play 
with Anne Savage from the UK and Sister's own Queen Agens B in the main 
room.

If you'd like to keep up with all my events, send a blank email to

blah blah blah... ;P   This isn't an offensive post... I've not had time to 
even read the replies... The majority of this "breaking discovery" is 
fluff.  These researchers found a way to encode binaural audio 
without  HRTF (Head Related Transfer Function) filtering.  The 
HRTF/binaural thing has been around a while and is in wide use for things 
such as computer game audio engines (all that creative labs shizzle, etc.). 
There are also cheap tools to use this technique in music production.

Of some interest might be ambisonics. The theory has been around since the 
70's (with a tech path leading from much earlier work), yet now in 
application via software it's possible to pull off some really crazy shit.

--------

I just got back from Sun's JavaOne where I presented my real time graphics 
and audio work; now got a Quake3 based game engine and a full ambisonic 
spatialization engine for audio built with Java. I will be releasing the 
game engine (but not my super secret audio engine) and more in September 
for free (open source). I made some contacts with some press folks from 
O'Reilly who made my presentation (BOF) and might get my work "officially 
reviewed"..  It was a trip going to conference as I didn't run into another 
attendee that wasn't corporately sponsored/associated; got a free ticket 
for speaking.

Blah blah blah...  Ooooo... So I got my 1st booking this year.. I should be 
headlining the Black & White ball again out at Defcon in Las Vegas.. ooo..

That will of course be in addition to other chaos that weekend including 
our own party with DDR & SarahFAB performing.

I'll also be playing out in SF at some time in July though...

Anyone make it to the Skinny Puppy show Thursday night? I was still in SF 
and caught it... guess who I saw in disguise.... Black Forest.... oooohhh.. 
spooky... ;P That and some other folks too... It was ok.. overall the show 
was much better than their latest album... (I guess that really isn't 
saying much though or is it?)... ;P

Ahhhhh....  Cya...

Subject: [sfraves] BSP:  Bam @ 550 w/ Planet of the Drums, Saturday

god, now i feel like i'm totally biting off Amber (sorry Amber!) but i was 
intending to do this despite her posting.

well, this saturday i'm opening up the back room at 550 Barnaveld.  the main 
room headliners are Dieselboy, Dara and AK1200 w/ J Messinian (aka Planet of 
the Drums).

so why am i emailing you all?  because 550 holds a pretty special place in 
my raver heart (ack, stop it brandon!) and it would mean lot to see some 
people in the room when i'm playing.  oh, i know, the woes of the opening 
DJ!  but seriously, i play from 10pm to 11pm and it's reduced admission 
before 11pm...so save some money and join me early!

550 is one of my all time favorite clubs in SF for many reasons.  one, i've 
been to so many kick ass events there from Thump to Analog (RIP) and various 
one off events.  so much incredible talent, so many late nights dancing.  
two, i've met and gotten to know so many kick ass people at 550.  from 
pretty random run-ins with some guy named Tim and this girl Eva to this guy 
Moshen who was hitting on my friend....but they all turned out to become 
really good friends of mine!  to getting really drunk off redbull and vodka 
with Osby and talking to a drunken Veanne outside...550 rocks.

and this saturday i have the pleasure of playing in the back room, which 
happens to be my favorite room of the place (cozy, great sound, and always 
groovy).  so come on out.  i'd love to see you there!

Subject: [sfraves] BSP + more!!! READ ME DJ'S!!!!

Hey all you folk out there in SFRaver land!

I am REALLY excited to announce that I have been booked with one of my best 
friends and tag-team partners to play a 3 hour set at the world famous BUZZ 
back home (for me) in Washington DC on August 20th of this year.

This is huge for me. The majority of my time spent in "the scene" was back 
in DC, and Buzz was always my target goal as far as places to play. Some of 
my fondest memories were created there, and I have seen some of the best 
talent in the EDM world perform there.

Anyway - I want to bring back some of what the Bay Area has to offer as far 
as music is concerned, and would like to try and get some of you yahoo's 
booked out east if I can!!!!

MY idea is to get PROMO PACKS from any DJ who is SERIOUSLY interested in 
trying to get some cross-country bookings. I cannot guarantee anything, but 
I am good friends with a bunch of diff. promoters out there, and this way 
your stuff can go directly into their hands - if they like you, most likely 
you will get dragged out there eventually!

If you are interested, a promo pack should include: at least ONE cd of your 
current material (if you spin multiple genres, please include 1 cd per 
genre), any/all contact/booking info, a bio/press pack (a little about 
yourself, try and do a list of gigs you played, etc.).

These can either be given to me in person before I roll out there in August, 
or mailed to me. (email me for my address)

I WILL NOT download sets off your site and burn them for you, I don't have 
the time or material needed to do it!!!

IF YOU HAVE YOOUR OWN PRODUCTION WORK ON DISC, PLEASE include it, because as 
we all know, producer/dj's get gigs much easier these days. Original 
material is a GOOD THING.

Anyhoo...thanks for reading, I hope I can help spread the love from coast to 
coast!

Subject: [sfraves] boh! and location and stuff

OK so hello all so I just want to make this quick. a while back I
created a gigantic series of rants about the effect location has on
the evolution of musical culture. so, just in case anybody actually
paid attention to that, basically, the fact that I'm back in
California shouldn't necessarily be taken as a conclusion in that. I
came back to California because the guy who bought me the plane ticket
told me I was going to Chicago. kind of a weird misunderstanding with
a consulting agency. anyway I **DO** appear to be back for good, or at
least for now, but it doesn't necessarily mean anything. OK carry on.

hello, this is a continuation of a fictional piece:
 
after placing the personal ad for a hot date, ig recieved exactly one reply. so, since ig had surpassed the general populous and was actually able to carry a conversation without feeling threatened or feeling the need to insult or impose or manipulate, the date was ON! :)

The founder of Ibadan recordings was born and raised in Ibadan, Nigeria to =

oter. He later succeeded in crossing over to the main stream through a unif=
ied approach with Joe Claussell and Kerri Chandler on the prestigious Ten C=
ity's catalogue project. Sydenham's work today is largely influenced by the=

Subject: [sfraves] ~~ ENGAGE ~~ Friday, July 16th ~ Multi-Production Event!

I think Solid Grooves *may* have a $5 ticket left, but my guess is that
everything has gone to $10 by now.  Anyways, since we're only two weeks away
and you may be able to plan this far in advanced... GO BUY THE CHEAP
TICKETS.  We expect to sell out of presales.

Subject: [sfraves] Sublounge last Fri: Groovy Music, Hardboiled eggs, & Chris J's
    sexy back

So ok.. I was having the most shitty week last week 'cause  my Mom's been putting like all this unneeded like added pressure in2 my life 'cause well... la la la... so it's been bad @ home the past week... Jonas invited me out 2 Sublounge on Friday, so I totally went!!!  It was sooooo fun!

So we got there like early & there was this like DJ spinning well.. he spun like alota old school Chicago style boomin' house.. it was... DJ Erick Or Laethel or something or another was his name... it was his friends Birthday so like there was cake.. oh YUM!!!  

Derrick ?Bledsoe? (I'm sorry 4 the total wrong sp of his last name,  but i like always think of Vanessa from like Cosby show when i see his name & get the 2 spellings mixed up) was up next & he spun alota deep house which was fun!!!

This was like all upstairs.. OK... I do remember Jonas went on & OK.. I do remember he did spin house & I think i did hear some Techhouse 2 start the whole tech house night @ Sublounge.. it was fun.. CHOOOOOO CHOOOOOOO....

OK... Andy (w) & I like walked around China Basin on a treasure hunt that seemed somewhat successful after one attemp of looking in this mondo hole in the wall bar w/ 3 drunk old men who said something about the way we look or something... but Andy (if you're reading this) Thanks 4 that Awesome conversation Big Bro, I Loved it)... so yeah.. we got back & Chris Jackson was on the decks.... Wow... he was spinnign Tech House & I never heard him do that B4.. it was intre3esting.. LoL

After the techhouse, he got up on some breakbeats (YUMMY) & Nico even pointed out a track that Chris produced.. So Dope... then he went in some Techno & Electro & then well back 2 some techhouse fun... it was a Dope Set!!  the last trrac k he spun was this well.. it was a darkly melodic bleepy techno track...

Then Andy jumped on the decks (literally 'cause he said there was a mouse on the floor.. JK..LoL) & well.. the 1st part of his set was fun.. I mean... it was all like bleepy bloop Techno.. it was totally bangin', but i really got more into like the 2nd part of his set when well.. OK.. the 2nd part of his set is where i found  my comfort zone of being able to dance.. so that was Groovy...

Oh yeah.. there was some point of the night when like downstairs, this dude spun like groovy house.. his name is Andy also.. he just moved here via San Diego via Chicago... & he gave me a CD, i haven't oh.. i shuld put it on now...

But the whole night was fun...  it was so niiiiice being w/ Family on a friday night... alota people who showed up i havne't seen in a while so that was neat!!  Yes.. Chris J does have a sexy back.. Chris.. it was so nice catchin' up w/ U Dude... remember *MISS-TEE-SOH* is how u say it... i want your kid 2 represent the 1/2 flip side the right way =)  oh yeah.. i promise next time u happen 2 B the 1st 1 2 call me in the hospital again if I ever happen 2 B in the hospital again 4 some reason... I promise i won't be on Morphine when u call :P LoL <3 U CJ =)

Subject: [sfraves] Bush White House admits it's insane on in-house website

This is not a hack or a piece from The Onion: 

http://www.results.gov/leadership/potomacfever.html
http://www.results.gov/leadership/potomacfever2.html

It's 100% legit and it's sitting on the White House Servers.

Got Potomac Fever?

Catch it.

In my book, suffering from 'Delusions of Grandeur,' is right up there
with being psycho.

Actually, now that they've admitted that they've got a problem like
this, a lot of things emanating from this Bush Administration make a
lot of sense.

Be sure you check out the quiz at the bottom of the first page, if it
weren't so scary, it would be a hoot.

Subject: [sfraves] a raver survey

Hello everyone,

I am doing some preliminary research into EMDR (eye movement 
desensitization and reprocessing)
and am wondering if there might be some sort of link to the eye rolling 
prevalent on MDMA

so I was wondering of you all wouldn't mind answering a few questions to 
help me get a direction

1) the nystagmus - was it back and forth like in REM sleep or more random?

2) did it seem to be correlated with any specific internal processing (e.g. 
you were not using MDMA
in a party context but more for introspective work).  Or - what was going 
on in your head when you
noticed the eye rolling?

3) if in a party context, could you describe the psychological or emotional 
state you were in at that time?
Was it "in the moment"?  I guess this goes to why people take E and my 
hypothesis is that the nystagmus
is a sign of information processing - if so, then it may be when people get 
into the right state of "flow"
and the conditions are right (lots of free serotonin around), the 
brain/mind is in a state where it can rewire
itself.  I remember someone "back in the day" telling me he looking forward 
to the nystagmus...

3.5) would you say the repeated experience of nystagmus helped you in some 
way ?

of course, intent and one's focus of attention are important variables, so 
I am trying to get a handle on them

4) was the nystagmus problematic or anxiety inducing, etc?

thank you and science thanks you too :)

Of course, all replies will be DES triple encrypted and stored on a 8 inch 
floppy for security purposes.
If I don't delete them first after doing a NSA certified disk wipe

Subject: [sfraves] NRR:  Medical Marijuana Vote in Congress THIS WEEK! 

--=====================_5031895==.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed



If you've been following the issue, you probably remember that last summer 
the United States House of Representatives held an important vote on 
medical marijuana:  An amendment sponsored by Rep. Maurice Hinchey (D-NY), 
cosponsored by Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA), would have forbid the US Dept. 
of Justice from using its resources to interfere with state medical 
marijuana laws.  Though the Hinchey amendment was defeated, the number of 
members who voted for it, 152, represented a 150% increase in Congressional 
support for medical marijuana since the only previous House vote on the 
issue five years before.  Rep. Hinchey is again championing his amendment 
this summer, and it is anticipated that a vote on it will take place 
sometime next month.

I am writing today to ask you to e-mail and call your US Rep. to ask him or 
her to vote YES on the Hinchey medical marijuana amendment when it comes to 
the House floor.  IT IS LIKELY THAT THIS WILL HAPPEN THIS WEEK, MAYBE EVEN 
TUESDAY JULY 6TH OR WEDNESDAY JULY 7TH.  Whether you think your Rep. is 
likely to support the Hinchey amendment or to oppose it, it is important 
that he or she hear from constituents like you who have the power to vote 
stay or go in their reelection campaign in November.  That's why I hope 
you'll take a few moments to contact your Rep. today regarding this issue.

To take action, please do the following:

1) Please visit http://stopthedrugwar.org/medicalmarijuana/ to write to 
your US Rep. in support of the Hinchey amendment.

2) Please call your Rep.'s office on the phone to follow up.  You can use 
the Congressional Switchboard at (202) 224-3121 to reach the office, or to 
find out who your Rep. is if you don't know, or you can find the direct 
phone number at http://www.house.gov online.  When you're done, send us an 
e-mail to DRCNet at alert-feedback@drcnet.org 
(mailto:alert-feedback@drcnet.org) to let us know you've taken action and 
to report to us any information you receive from the staffer taking your 
call on your Rep.'s intentions.  DRCNet will forward any such information 
to lobbyists working on this bill here in Washington.

3) Please forward this e-mail to as many friends and other likely medical 
marijuana supporters know that now is the time to take action.

Thanks for being a part of this important effort.  Visit 
http://stopthedrugwar.org to learn all about this issue and how to be a 
part of bringing about change.

"I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes 
me to tremble for the safety of my country.  As a result of the war, 
corporations have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places 
will follow, and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong 
its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth is 
aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed."

  "I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of 
life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the 
beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club, 
party or other sound system that has ever achieved anything close to that..."

Subject: Re: [sfraves] I hope it's worth it

I've been lusting after this mixer since it was announced.  For me
it's not so much old mixer/new mixer or old car/new mixer, it's more
that this looks like the first "perfect" mixer.  It's like a pioneer
but w/o the shitty quality.  It's like a Rane but with features.  It's
like a big Allen & Heath with a useful layout and crossfader.  Street
of $1699 puts it out of reach
for the near future however.

If anyone knows where I can demo one of these, I'd love to spend some
time on it.

"I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes 
me to tremble for the safety of my country.  As a result of the war, 
corporations have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places 
will follow, and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong 
its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth is 
aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed."
-Abraham Lincoln

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

  "I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of 
life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the 
beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club, 
party or other sound system that has ever achieved anything close to that..."

More Than Music and Style




By , The Black Commentator
Posted on July 5, 2004, Printed on July 6, 2004


"We need a national agenda to make sure that our community has more than 
music and style. We can't continue to do bootleg activism. We've got to do 
institutional activism, creating media outlets that will push our propaganda."
 Jeff Johnson, America Votes youth coordinator and commentator for BET's 
"Rap City"

"We're all activists. The question is, what are we active for? Are we 
active to forward a rightwing agenda in America, or are we active for 
liberation?"
 Rosa Clemente, co-founder, National Hip Hop Political Convention (NHHPC)

"Just as the Christian Coalition tapped into an existing infrastructure of 
conservative churches, we as a hip hop generation are tapping into an 
existing infrastructure that has been created by the hip hop movement."
 Bakari Kitwana, author and co-founder, NHHPC

American capitalism markets everything it can package and discards or 
mangles the rest. As a result, most "information" found in the marketplace 
is, by definition, disinformation  a "product" molded to suit a 
transaction, containing no reliable connection to the truth.

In the absence of a mass black political movement, the generation born 
after 1965 has been named for the culture it created, rather than  as with 
the preceding generation  the political goals for which they fought. Hip 
hop culture, the miraculous invention of black and Latino youth, is now 
marketed to the world by five multinational corporations. The social 
"reality" and political worldview of an entire generation (now going on two 
generations) has been packaged for sale to both its creators and the larger 
market: the planet.

Having been commercially defined as a raw demographic  a cohort of 
customers and product-modelers  the hip hop generation stares into a 
mirror that has been purposely cracked and deformed for somebody else's 
profit. Its activists, as brilliant as any produced at any time or place in 
history  and intent, like all healthy young humans, on changing the world 
 find that they must first confront the marketed version of themselves.

The 3,000 young people who attended the National Hip Hop Political 
Convention in Newark, New Jersey, June 16-20, were determined to define 
themselves through a politics of struggle  to begin to redraw the map of 
the world through the prisms of their own experience.

"We are here today as young people under the hip hop umbrella," said Ras 
Baraka, the 34-year-old Deputy Mayor of Newark, New Jersey, and one of the 
organizers of the event. "Politics is about the seizure of power," Baraka 
told the crowd. "Some of us don't understand what that means. Our kids 
think that seizing power is standing on a corner and doing the things they 
usually do." Each of the 500 official delegates from 17 states had 
registered 50 voters to earn the right to represent their generation.

Baraka, who is also an assistant public school principal, doesn't show up 
on the Right's short list of hip hop generation "leaders." By cynically 
misinterpreting polling data that show black youth to be increasingly 
estranged from the Democratic Party, and through relentless national media 
exposure of young, corporate-sponsored black politicians, the Right 
attempts to package the hip hop generation as essentially more 
"conservative" than its elders. The darlings of the Right include Tennessee 
Congressman Harold Ford, 34, the Democratic Leadership Council's most 
prominent voice in the Congressional Black Caucus, and Cory Booker, the 
35-year-old former Newark Councilman who, with the backing of the national 
conservative political and funding network, nearly captured City Hall in 2002.

What the conservatives prove is that the current younger generation 
contains its share of opportunists  just as did the last generation, and 
the one before that. But opportunists only show up when they get paid, and 
represent nothing but the finances of their sugar daddies. The National Hip 
Hop Political Convention had no deep-pocket sponsors, yet it succeeded on 
the strength of the organizers' peer credibility, and the near-universal 
desire among black youth to overturn the status quo.

Continuity of Struggle

So vacuous has American political discourse become that corporate 
spin-makers posing as journalists find it possible to produced 24-hour news 
cycles that reveal nothing at all except the political preferences of media 
owners. The mass marketing of attitudes and styles in place of issues and 
substance seeks to drain the language itself of the capacity to resist 
power. A generation of black youth that is imprisoned in astronomical 
numbers is simultaneously deployed as lifestyle models for the privileged, 
prison-immune classes  mass-produced insanity on its face. Yet in the 
continuity of black struggle, people and truths "crushed to earth" 
inevitably rise again to confront oppression.

"I believe that we are in this room because some slave willed us here," 
said Rev. Osagyefo Sekou, the 30-something Executive Director of New York 
Common Ground, and a mover-and-shaker of the convention. "We need a living 
wage for everyone. I call that a moral question."

Moral people seek to end injustice, mass media's truly taboo topic. Only by 
relentless avoidance of the continuity of injustices against black people 
can the media create the impression of vast chasms between black generations.

"Get the foot of oppression off our necks." From the hip hop perspective, 
54-year-old Rev. Calvin Butts, of Harlem's Abyssinian Baptist Church, 
qualifies as an elder. Yet his irreducible demand, delivered at a Town Hall 
meeting on the first full day of the convention, was identical to that of 
his hip hop audience. Many were aware of Butts' history of broad brush 
criticism of hip hop culture. However, in the context of a shared struggle 
against historical oppression, differences shrink. "Organizing must be done 
around a moral core. That moral core must respect all of us  our women, 
our children, our elders," said the preacher. "Without a moral core, the 
revolution is wiped out."

Who would argue with that?

Rich corporations mass-market immorality (after all, they are the only ones 
who can), and then label their products as authentic representations of hip 
hop generation morals. Righteously, the organizers of the Newark convention 
gave primacy to the morality of struggle  to the chapter and verse of 
resistance.

A secular elder, Ron Daniels, currently Executive Director of the Center 
for Constitutional Rights and a prime mover in over three decades of black 
political conventions, showed the seamless connections between culture, 
morality, and politics. "Art must be functional and committed," said 
Daniels. "This generation must come to the forefront and lead us to change 
America." Nevertheless, "We cannot, in the name of 'realness,' denigrate 
ourselves."

"Denigration" was the last thing on these young people's minds. At the core 
of the convention were perhaps a thousand committed activists  ranging 
from seasoned, 30-something veterans to promising neophytes  who have the 
potential to do great damage to the powers-that-be.

Fight the Power

In what now seems the Golden Age of socially conscious hip hop, Public 
Enemy's Chuck D demanded that his audiences "fight the powers that be." 
Born in 1960, Chuck D and his peers, the inventors of the culture, are the 
political and chronological links between the so-called "Black Power" and 
hip hop generations. Currently a host on radio's Air America network, Chuck 
D recalled the suppression of hip hop. "From 1979 to 1992, there was a 
sheer abandonment [of hip hop music by black radio programmers]," he said. 
They banned it."

During that period, hip hop broke out of the neighborhoods and fueled the 
founding of a host of independent (mostly white-owned) record labels  an 
explosion of musical creativity and social commentary of all kinds. But not 
until the early nineties, after mega-corporations moved to swallow up the 
genre, did black-programmed radio embrace the music of black youth. 
Programmers ponderously intoned that hip hop fans were too young to attract 
advertisers, that they were not a valuable demographic  an amazing claim, 
since the R & B music that carried black radio to new heights in the 
Sixties was also the music of youth. But many in the hip hop industry 
understood the real deal: Black programmers were afraid of projecting a 
street "image." Essentially, hip hop had an intra-black, class problem. Don 
Cornelius wouldn't touch it, even though his "Soul Train" TV audience 
skewed to the younger demos.

In one of the great ironies of African American cultural history, black 
radio finally embraced hip hop in the early nineties  precisely when the 
huge corporate record labels shifted to gangsta rap. Industry researchers 
discovered that hip hop's most "active" consumer base was composed of 12- 
and 13-year-olds  tweens  a cohort that is drawn to repetitive profanity 
and, not having reached the sexual pairing-off stage of development, revels 
in misogyny. Artists and recordings (A & R) executives put great pressure 
on rap acts to become more "real"  a word that became a euphemism for 
egregiously profane and abusive language. In no time at all, the industry 
began churning out music geared primarily to younger juveniles. Black 
radio, which had had such a problem with hip hop before the 
corporate-guided ascendance of gangsta rap, dived into the cesspool with 
wild enthusiasm. The airwaves became filled with edits, bleeps and audio 
interruptions that did nothing to hide the "denigrating" content.

Black middle-class propriety was trumped by the servile imperative to 
follow the (white) corporate leader. No one can measure the accumulated 
arrested development afflicting youngsters raised on a profane corporate 
formula designed for tweens.

New Times, New Tasks

However, the music industry's version of "real" hasn't blotted out reality 
for the entirety of the hip hop generation. Mutulu, of Dead Prez, sees the 
world, clearly. "We gotta keep going," he urged the Newark convention. "If 
we don't keep going, rap will continue to be drafted into the capitalist 
world, the crack world, the prison industrial complex."

With a seriousness that wholly contradicts hip hop stereotypes, 
conventioneers fanned out in the scorching sun over three connected 
campuses  Essex County College, Rutgers-Newark and New Jersey Institute of 
Technology  to attend 50 workshops on every conceivable aspect of organizing.

The "movement" that was largely demobilized by an upwardly mobile, 
self-conscious "leadership class" in the late sixties, was getting an update.

"We looked at cities that have higher levels of black cops," Monifa Bandele 
explained to a workshop titled: Why Vote? Community Voices on the Criminal 
Justice System. "What we saw, clear as day, is that high levels of black 
cops is not the solution."

Bandele is a Brooklyn leader of the Malcolm X Grassroots Movement, which 
also has chapters in Alabama, Mississippi and California  all represented 
at the Newark convention. Black cops are often an active or passive 
problem, she said, as was revealed in the 1997 torture of Abner Louima. 
"You would be shocked to know how many black cops were there, in the 
precinct [where Louima was sodomized with a mop handle], and they said 
nothing, they did nothing."

At a workshop on Our Schools, Our Kids and the Money, gray-bearded Junius 
Williams, a legendary Newark scholar/activist who directs the Rutgers 
Abbott Leadership Institute, spoke of a brief period when street youth were 
drawn to political warfare rather than mindless gang-banging.  "Had these 
men been around 30 or 35 years ago," said Williams, referring to local gang 
members who had spoken to the convention the night before, "they would have 
been in a group like the Black Panthers or the Young Lords."

Whether as neo-Panthers (the New Black Panther Party was represented at the 
convention), as hip hop advocacy journalists (former Source Magazine 
executive editor Bakari Kitwana co-founded the convention), or among the 
numerous young teachers gathered in Newark under the hip hop "umbrella," 
what's crucial is that youth become engaged in struggle of some 
kind.  Rather than whine about older politicians who refuse to get out of 
the way, convention co-chair Angela Woodson exhorted: "Don't wait for the 
old guard. If you're ready, run!"

Electoral politics, the route taken to the exclusion of all others by 
critical elements of a previous generation's movement, has demonstrated its 
hollowness in the absence of year-round, grassroots organizing. "Electoral 
politics is futile, until they put revolution on the ballot," said Dead 
Prez's Mutulu, 32. But he says it without prejudice to those who choose 
electoral political action  as long as they act!

Very late on a Saturday night, hours behind schedule due to failure to 
anticipate a flurry of amendments, the exhausted delegates to the National 
Hip Hop Political Convention adopted a Five-Point Agenda on Education, 
Economic Justice, Criminal Justice, Health and Human Rights.

Last week, hip hop music blared at the entrance to a downtown Chicago park, 
where a huge food- and drink-tasting festival was underway. The local 
chapter of the National Hip Hop Political Convention was busy, registering 
voters. All across the country, they are taking action.

"I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes 
me to tremble for the safety of my country.  As a result of the war, 
corporations have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places 
will follow, and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong 
its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth is 
aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed."

life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the

the ACLU!

when I was 18, I did a radio talk show on the legalization of
marijuana, and one of my guests was the director of the Chicago ACLU.
the other guest was the school nurse. I had an activist lawyer whose
specialty was public policy debating the school nurse. it was
ruthless, underhanded, and magnificent. afterwards I got kicked off
the radio station, but every stoner for thirty miles knew who I was.

anyway I was able to recruit him for this because I actually organized
a high school chapter of the ACLU when I was in high school. this was
the only high school ACLU chapter in existence at the time, and it
probably still is. wait wait wait maybe that was pathetic and geeky
and too lame for words. okay actually none of that ever happened.
ever. I made it all up.

anyway whatever. my position on the ACLU these days is different. they
rock but it's not my thing. BUT, on the topic of politics, and
apologies if it's already been posted, BUT, on the topic of politics,
Governator Schwarzenegger is doing a public policy poll on gay
marriage and the conservatives are coming out in force. (no pun
intended.) so, if you feel that all Americans have the same rights to
life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, if you feel that it's an
American right to define your own pursuit of happiness, without some
sick religious wacko from Alabama telling innocent people what they
can and can't do, then please:

I did it. It felt good.

Subject: [sfraves] nrr:  appleseed trailer

http://www.apple.co.jp/quicktime/trailers/appleseed_large.html

if you are into anime, movies or just want some eye candy.

what i like about the style of animation they went for is that it still 
LOOKS like more traditional animation but it's been taken to another level 
of depth and dimension.  it gives the feeling of really good anime (or 
'japanimation' as we called it way back when) with the added element of 
modern cgi techniques.

holy jesus. that's absolutely gorgeous.

they actually did another anime of "appleseed" about ten years ago,
before "ghost in the shell," but it didn't look a billionth this good.
that's like "macross plus" with state-of-the-art CG.

Michael,

	I believe you're thinking of that shadowy organization known as "the 
library," which some people believe is a front for organized crime* 
because many of their outlets do very little business and are rarely 
open.

Groove on,

*Actually true, in a manner of speaking!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] The concord bouncey gym place ?

hehe yeah, small world. . .

there was one outdoor party I went to in livermore off vasco once. As I was
driving there I was thinking like "where in the hell would this place be".
When I turned into the glowstick marked entrance, I realized it was Sandhill
Ranch, this big mining area/motocross track owned by an alcoholic asshole
named Tom anderson (if I remember right, he always rode around on race day
on a quad with a teddy bear strapped to the front).

wierd experience. The actual main dancing area was their lil 1/4 mile oval
track with the pussy mx track in the middle. People were dancing on top the
doubles, and there were lasers n lights on "godzilla" (this big hill making
up part of the main mx track).

I used to ride there almost weekly when they were open. Cool place to
explore, caves n trails. . .they also used to have paintball games there.
Had some of my best races there, even tho the dirst was always so dry and
fukked. . .I hate tracks where in the morning they're super muddy n slick,
and an hour later it's so dusty you can't see a thing. I've raced there when
it was 100+ deg outside, and when it was like 28 deg outside. Hard to go
fast when you can't move your fingers.

and I think the gym is just called like Mikes Gym or something like that. If
I go up there tomorrow I'll check it out and let you know, not like it's
really important, but now I kinda need to know. . . just cuz. . .

: )

of all time! People who get over as DJs are making the easiest money ever, 
because they've convinced every PR person and club owner in the world that 
they're doing something only a few natural-born geniuses can do. It's 
laughable. A 70-year-old blind Ethiopian leper with 10 broken fingers can 
"spin" just as well as any B-list celebrity at any instore party for some 
gay snowboarding jeans company. I promise.

And those other guys who do all the little flick-flick, crabby moves on 
records that are covered with spots of adhesive tape that are supposed to 
mean something? Those aren't DJs! I don't know what to call them. Nerds, 
maybe? They called themselves "turntablists" five years ago, but I think 
that got embarrassing. One thing is for sure, though: Those guys don't DJ 
on the actual paying gig circuit that I'm on, because no hammered jock 
chicks or guidos from West Orange, N.J., will dance to an hour-long 
abstract scratch frenzy over a P-Funk B-side.

I've been making loads of supplementary income by DJing for a few years 
now, and I can barely even scratch my own back. All you really need is a CD 
burner, Kazaa, and passably cool taste in music. Here, I'll tell you all 
about my life as a party DJ:

TECHNIQUE
FLOW: The only slightly ephemeral skill to learn is flow. Have you ever 
made a mixtape for someone you had a crush on? Then you already know what 
flow isthe ability to maintain a mood. I was at a party once where the DJ 
kept playing one danceable hip-hop track, then one undanceable slow 
classic-rock track, one hip-hop, one slow rock, on and on like that for an 
hour! We would get up and dance, and then sit down, and then we finally 
just stayed down and shot him really dirty looks. It was the opposite of 
flow. To master flow, you just need to not be a fucking moron. Can you 
handle that?

Segueing from one genre to a totally different one is easy. You just build 
tiny little bridges instead of taking one big leap. For example, let's go 
from a hip-hop set to a punk-rock set. You play your last rap song, then a 
Prince track. Then maybe some ESG. Then the Slits. Boom! You're into the 
punk before they know what hit 'em.

LCD: This is your audience. It stands for Lowest Common Denominator. You 
are DJing for drunks and cokeheads, and they need the aural equivalent of 
safety blankets. What would you rather hear when you're high as fuck in a 
bar: Journey or some obscure acid-house? (If you're a geek, don't answer 
that.)
I used to spend all my time collecting the rarest tracks, stuff that when I 
heard it at home it would totally blow my mind. Guess what? No one cared. 
In fact, they stopped dancing. Now I stick to playing stuff that I liked 
when I was a teenager (the Misfits, "O.P.P.," and songs from John Hughes 
movies) and I'm golden. When in doubt, go nostalgic.

CUEING: This is where you enact the flow thing I just told you about. You 
have two sides, right and left. When something's playing on the right, 
think of a song that would sound good after it. Cue that song up on the 
left by pressing the same buttons on a CD player that you've pressed 1,000 
times before (or putting a needle down in the appropriate groove on a 
record). When the song on the right side is about to end, slide the little 
thingy in the box between the decks to the left. When you're a little less 
than halfway over, press "play" on the CD or "start" on the turntable. 
Congratulations, you're DJing. Can I get a "That was easy"?

PERKS
LINES: A huge guilty pleasure is cutting the line and marching right up to 
the velvet rope all casual, going, "Hi, I'm the DJ." I like to go to a gig 
dressed like a total slob. The nicer the club, the shittier I look. Then I 
can stroll past all the people who used to spit on me in high school and 
make a big huge deal about going through the door first.

MONEY: Depending on who you are, a DJ's salary for one night can range from 
a few free drinks to obscene amounts (for the big shots) that make you hate 
capitalism. I heard Paul Sevigny got fucking $15,000 to DJ at Sundance. I 
hope that is DJ urban legend. Most DJs I know are pretty psyched if they 
get a couple hundred. Art openings should pay more, like $350. And 
remember: Always get paid in cash on the night of. Within 24 hours all 
money magically transforms into cocaine blown up some model's ass.

COMPLIMENTS: One of the best things about DJing is when you play a really 
kickass song and people come up to you dancing, going "I love this song!" 
You get all proud and pretend you wrote it. You're like, "Thanks!" Yeah, I 
downloaded "Youth Gone Wild," I rule. It's like being told your air-guitar 
skills are fucking SICK.

GEAR
NEEDLES: Those sleek, aerodynamic, $500 fancy-pants needles are the second 
biggest scam in DJing besides convincing people that DJing is hard. For 
totally serviceable needles, go to one of those electronics stores on Canal 
Street and get the cheapest set possible. You can talk them down on the 
price, too. I got a pair plus some shitty headphones for $90 after I 
sweet-talked the sales guy for a minute. (BTW, the cheap needles are called 
hip-hop needles and that's mean against blacks.)

MIXERS: There are a few brands of mixers, but who cares. DJs would like for 
you to think mixers are all complicated, but they're really about as hard 
to figure out as a home stereo. I once spun at this lesbian party where I 
ended up giving girls DJ lessons all night. They were lined up across the 
room, and it only took me a few seconds to show each of them the basics. As 
Garfield would say, "Big fat hairy deal." Once I showed them how simple it 
really is, they were shocked at the big deal that people make about the 
whole thing. Yeah, there are cute little tricks you can do. If you're 
playing a hip-hop song, it's fun to cut out the bass after the second verse 
and then kick it back in full force on the chorus. It's a nifty party trick 
and it makes girls lose their shit. But you can also just say, "Fuck it," 
set them all in the middle, and read a book in between tracks.

WHEELS OF STEEL: Please don't call them that. Don't call them "the ones and 
the twos" either. It sounds like your mom saying, "Homie don't play that."

ETIQUETTE
OOPS: You're going to fuck up. The record will skip or you'll be distracted 
by some drunk kid telling you how much "Bizarre Love Triangle" means to him 
or you'll let two Wire songs play in a row. No big whup. Everyone's too 
wasted to care. You should be too. Just take the opportunity to make 
announcements. I usually shout out important information such as, "Don't 
stop the rock, motherfuckers!" or "I need to pee!"

REQUESTS: Try not to cry when people request Missy Elliott, again. Or "Hey 
Ya!" or "Milkshake." Or Cher when you are spinning Minor Threat. Or simply 
"hip-hop." Or any genre of music, in fact. You wouldn't believe how often 
people request an entirely different genre of music than what the DJ is 
playing. It's infuriatingly rude. You're telling the DJ that you hate his 
or her music. If you don't like what I'm playing, wait 10 fucking minutes 
and I'll be onto a new thing anyway.

If you simply must request a song, it better be within the scope of what 
I'm playing at that very second AND it better be such an insane song that 
it'll make me go, "Oh shit, yeah, why didn't I think of that?"

True fact: That's only happened to me once out of hundreds and hundreds of 
requests. The song was "Sweet Emotion" by Aerosmith, believe it or not.

SAVING YOUR BEST STUFF: This is tricky. You don't want to blow your load 
before the night hits maximum party time, so you squirrel away your 
guaranteed crowd-pleasing monster jams and you wait, thinking, "Now? Now? 
Do I drop it?" And finally you're like, "It's time, I'm gonna hit it." And 
boom! It's a fuckin' nuclear-bomb explosion. A roomful of people you would 
barely be able to look at in the daytime are freaking out like they just 
won the lottery, all because you pressed a button. That's why you do this 
shit. That, and the fact that you are a total fucking spaz.

"I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes 
me to tremble for the safety of my country.  As a result of the war, 
corporations have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places 
will follow, and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong 
its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth is 
aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed."

-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

  "I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of 
life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the 
beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club, 
party or other sound system that has ever achieved anything close to that..."

hahaha

exactly!

it was written by somebody who plays music she hates for people she hates.

she's a fool, and I would pity her, but that's a job for Mr. T.

magazines suck anyway. I wrote stuff for a prominent technology
magazine in the mid-90s, right before the dot-com boom. the experience
totally sucked. there was also a DJ magazine that took posts I made on
this very list and then reprinted them in their magazine as letters to
the editor. they did it twice. they didn't give me any money, and they
didn't give me complementary copies, either. later I started actually
reading the magazine. they ran an article on hip-hop, which I used to
know a lot about, and I noticed a few mistakes. then they ran an
article on new-school breaks, which I do know a lot about, and I
noticed a ton of mistakes. like three out of five statements were
inaccurate in some way or another. really four out of five. that's
when I realized magazines just don't matter.

LOL...I thought the piece was funny, in the context of VICE 
magazine.  Originally this was a small punk zine that now has morphed into 
somewhat of a business including an online site that, as the three ex-punks 
who founded the mag and online version say:  "...is a collection of the 
irreverent, hilarious and downright scary gonzo journalism that brought 
three losers from the crack houses of Le Plateau to the deluxe apartments 
of Manhattan."

The same issue had an article questioning whether there was any difference 
between frat and punk parties, illustrated with photos of guys vomiting and 
one of the writers pissing on his vomit.  So...irreverence?:)

Love,

Apollo

Subject: RE: [sfraves] HEY DJ: FUCK YOU!!!

It's obvious she's talking about dj'ing traditional styles of music, and not 
EDM, and has not CLUE ONE as to what "our" version of DJ'ing is. I have seen 
many of the old punk rock/industrail dj's back in DC try their hand at 
DJ'ing EDM, and fail MISERABLY. But almost all would agree after trying it 
that it's much harder than they had thought it would be. She's right if you 
look at it from the point of view of someone who has no concept of 
beatmatching, track progression, building, tricks, tone blending or anything 
else.

As someone who comes from the punk scene, I can laugh at it, while at the 
same time I shake my head at her obviously narrowminded point of view.

Of course, this dumbass probably still buys safety pins in bulk to adorn her 
patch covered pants, and thinks that the squatter punk look is cool.

yah. she's talking about this kind of DJing:

http://www.marketingfordjs.com

weddings, frat parties, corporate events, bar mitzvahs, etc.; the type
of DJs they're talking to in catalogs when they say "don't miss
another gig because you don't have karaoke!"

I actually worked for a company that did that very briefly right after
high school. imagine a bunch of 13-yr-olds who want to hear Tupac, but
Mom is footing the bill, and Mom wants them to listen to Celine Dion
and play hula hoop -- and you're the guy handing out hula hoops.

basically, the fourth circle of hell.

Evil Eddie Richards/sfraves trivia: the hyperreal.org domain was named
after "Hyperreal," a song by the Shamen, which appeared on their album
"En-Tact" in 1992. The lead single for that album, released in 1991,
was "Move Any Mountain," and Evil Eddie Richards did a remix.

I'm wicked at Trivial Pursuit. :-)

Dear Friends,

The Federal Marriage Amendment is expected to come to a vote in
the US Senate in early July. We must let our Senators know that
we do NOT want discrimination written into the constitution!

Even if you've already spoken out on this issue before, our
Senators need to hear from us often and loudly during the next
few weeks! Please, join me in sending a personalized letter from
the Human Rights Campaign Action Center at:

I remember that party.  I think it was a satellite, but who knows...maybe
that's what "they" want you to think ;)

Memorable moment #2: The fire that started at the first (I think) Freedom.  I
recount a bottle rocket shooting over the dancefloor, coherced by the wind,
onto the grassy hill that everyone would always view the sunrise.  The small
fire grew quickly into a problem.  My friends and I were trying to figure out
if it was planned when the music stopped and Martin shouted "We can all put
this out together!"  At that moment, we were sure of it...it was planned! 
Everyone cheered and hauled the 5 gallon bottles of water from the bar up the
hill to extinguish the blaze.  It didn't take long to realize that the fire
was spreading too quickly, and maybe that whole idea of it being a planned
activity was incorrect.  When the fire department arrived they saw 3000
confused ravers running up a hill with 5 gallon jugs of water toward the fire.
 Next thing Martin gets on the mic instructing everyone to get *off* the hill.
 They just don't throw 'em like they used to.

Subject: [sfraves] Greetings from Germany

Moin! Guten tag!

whats up folks! ive been here in Deustchland since June and im having a 
blast so far, sightseeing, visiting relatives, Legoland in Denmark (the very 
first one since 1960s...) then the Lego factory, partying, graffiti walls, 
checkin out the hiphop culture as well as the techno side of things, 
absorbing the culture and they way of life. Just here for a couple of 
months, im staying in the Schleswig-Holstein area, about a couple of hours 
north of Hamburg and 45 mins away from Denmark, a nearby big city would be 
Kiel, it's like the SF equivalent bc of the harbor, etc.

I'm off to Berlin tomorrow morning with my folks, going to spend the week 
there.  It sucks when you're a hiphop and techno fan at the same 
time...there's a hiphop show goin down with DJ Hype (for u D&B junkies, u 
kno who this cat is) and then since the Love Parade is cancelled, a bunch of 
other techno parties are up and about...The Love From Above is the huge one, 
about 6000 party people expected or capacity iono which one is which...but 
it's tomorrow, same day as the hiphop show.  Paul Van Dyk is headlining that 
one.

Any suggestions? DJ Hype or Paul Van Dyk.  I'll take votes haha. other than 
that, hope all is well back in the bay. i missed 1999 and im upset, i was so 
looking forward to that party, nothing but the good ol' jams i heard. peace 
and love.  if u need more info on the Love party, google it up and see all 
the info if ur curious.

Tschuss!

Paul

I'd strongly recommend DJ Hype.  Sick sick sick turntable shit, and he
usually busts out with a strong sound covering several different styles of
jungle (besides innovator and badass pioneer of the sound in general, he
was cutting and scratching jungle before most anybody over here knew what
it was)...  with PVD you might catch a couple tunes you haven't heard or
even a clean mix or two.

This is kind of spam but if you do it (I did) here's something I added
at the end of the form letter, cut-and-paste if you wanna:

Furthermore, please realize that this issue is ultimately about
freedom of religion, a founding principle of this nation. Anybody who
subverts the Constitution as a way of promoting their own religious
agenda is absolutely anti-American.

Subject: [sfraves] ayn rand

I'm sorry, this has absolutely nothing to do with anything, but we
were talking about Ayn Rand on this list a while back, and I just
accidentally discovered a truly fascinating article which explains how
Larry Wall (the inventor of Perl) is just like Howard Roark, from the
Ayn Rand novel "The Fountainhead," while Larry Ellison (head of Oracle
Corporation, a huge database company) is just like Hank Rearden, from
the Ayn Rand novel "Atlas Shrugged."

I'm not endorsing this, I just think it's funny.

http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2002/09/04/perlfororacle.html

"Once again, rolling forward a couple of generations and modernizing
the names, if Ayn Rand were to replace the key productive technology
of 1950s America with that of early twenty-first century America, she
would probably choose to write about databases."

And the scary thing is, she probably would.

my vote is for Hype.  without talking about skills or genre...the fact is 
PvD comes through the bay way more often than Hype does.  you'll have 
atleast one or two chances per year to hear PvD in SF...but you might not 
hear Hype for years.

Subject: [sfraves] ~~ ENGAGE ~~ Friday, July 16th ~ Dragn'fly Birthday Party!

Almost a week away.  This will be the place to be on Friday.  KMR is a cool
venue right next to PacBell park, we're got things running so smoothly,
everything is just going great.  All we need to do is make sure enough
people come out.  And I want to see some candy... I miss candy :(  DNB
doesn't really bring it but maybe someone will have it for Mystre.

Oh, and I heard DJ Girlie spin and she does some damn good vocal oldies.
That'll be another set I'll watch.  Actually I think besides maybe Chris
Jackson and Jon Bishop, I'm only going to be watching the girl DJ's.  They
so great... Girlie, Dragnfly, Molly vs Val.  Ok, enough rambles.

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) Why Larry Hiibel refused to show his identification

WINNEMUCCA, NEV. - A lot of people want to know why I went all the
way to the Supreme Court rather than give my name to a policeman. 
"What's
so important about that?" they ask. "What's the big principle at
stake?" And last week, when the Supreme Court ruled against me,
maybe some thought I was foolish to have done it. But I still think I 
did
the right thing and that there were some issues that had to be
decided.

The story began May 21, 2000, when I was on a rural road near my
ranch in Winnemucca, Nev. My daughter and I had gotten into an argument.
She was driving, and I was the passenger. We stopped by the side of the
road, parked legally, and we continued our argument. I figured we
would finish it out and then cool off for a moment.

That's when I heard sirens, and all of a sudden a police car drove
up. A deputy walked up to me and demanded my "papers." I asked him what
the problem was. "Why do you guys have me surrounded?" I asked,
because by now there were two or three more police cars.

He refused to explain why he was there or why he wanted my papers.
Eleven times he demanded my identification. I refused to give it to
him each time, and he finally handcuffed me and took me to jail. The
cops threw my daughter on the ground, cuffed her hands behind her and
demanded her name as well, but by that time I was on my way to the
county jail. I got there at midafternoon and stayed overnight.

I hadn't been argumentative; I wasn't picking a fight. Basically,
when Deputy Dove demanded my papers - and he didn't ask for them, he
demanded them - I didn't say, "Hey, cop, I'm not going to give you
nothing." I just asked why he wanted them. "What have I done?" I
asked.

If he'd explained what he was doing there, perhaps it could have been
settled on the spot. But his position was that he wanted the papers
first. [Editor's note: The police had received a report of a man
striking a woman in a pickup truck.]

Here's why this was so important to me: I don't believe that the
authorities in the United States of America are supposed to walk up to 
you and
ask for your papers. I thought that wasn't lawful. Apparently I was
wrong, but I thought that that was part of what we were guaranteed 
under the
Constitution. We're supposed to be free men, able to walk freely in
our own country - not hampered, not stopped at checkpoints. That's
part of what makes this country different from other places. That's
what I was taught.

And it's not just because it's in the Constitution. It's something
that you just kind of know. It's kind of obvious. If you haven't
committed a crime, you shouldn't be harassed by the police. If they
suspect you of something, I don't see why they shouldn't explain it.
I wasn't violent. And it was proved later in court that I hadn't
committed any crimes.

These days, it's as if we're all guilty until proved innocent. You
walk into an airport and everybody's a suspect. Like the way people
were treated in Soviet Russia, in Red China, in Castro's Cuba. We
don't want the US to become that.

I don't have a superclear understanding of the Constitution. I'm not
an attorney. I've never even read the whole thing. I went through
only eighth grade. But I remember what I learned, and it seems to me 
that
the whole idea of "your papers, please" goes completely against the
grain of the American people. As I understood it, the state was
supposed to serve us - we aren't supposed to serve the state. Laws
were supposed to protect the people against the government, not the
other way around.

Maybe in Los Angeles and other places across the country, the police
have browbeaten the people into more acceptance of this police-state
mentality than where I am. I live out on a ranch, the nearest town is
30 miles away, and it has only 7,000 or 8,000 people. I think that
has an effect on our mentality.

It's not that I'm against law enforcement. Criminals should be
apprehended. But I don't think we've got to take everybody's rights 
away just so
that we can be safe. If you do that, you've defeated your purpose. I
don't think people want to be protected to the extent that they
become slaves.

I'm very disappointed by this decision. I think a basic freedom has
been lost. What bothers me the most is that my children and
grandchildren are going to have to live with this law. It moves us a
step closer to control of the people by the government, and I don't
think that's a step forward.

Or an Italian themed rave...

We could get DJ Godfather to headline, and myself and my tag-team pahtnah 
from DC could spin under our world famous (not really) name "The Mario 
Brothers". It could be called "MEATBALL 2004" or something similar...lol.

me to tremble for the safety of my country.  As a result of the war, 
corporations have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places 
will follow, and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong 
its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth is

Well, I'm back finally after realizing that signing up after my vacation
in January it never started sending me emails again... Then I just
forgot about it because I've been so busy.  But after running into Osby
last night.. Well, Osby running into me at my house I realized I haven't
been receiving the emails.

So, I'm back. And I'm techno. :)

"have you ever considered that in quite a few social circles, there are numbers of people just lining up waiting to buy your coffin for you, AND plan your funeral?"

Subject: [sfraves] watch the skies

today's inexplicable DJ Soundwave astrological spam report:

Jupiter (planet of travel and expansion) is quincunx Neptune (planet
of fishes and LSD).

Bad day for overanalyzing things, as analysis might not reach accurate
conclusions.
Good day for fly-fishing on acid. (And how often do those come along?)

Is this like a giant email conversation that going on? If so would it 
not be more efficient to take it to a chat room of shorts? If it is not 
then why am i getting all there totally random email?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] watch the skies

well ... huh.

i don't recognize your email address.  we've just kind of been doing 
this for years.  the random threads nstuff.  if you're only looking for 
party info, you can subscribe to just the calendar, or for the more 
"mature" sfraves that's supposed to be "drama-free" i think there's 
like an "sfr-lite" or "sfr-planners" or something like that.  there's 
also an sf-oasis list, which i'm not sure if i'm on or not, that i 
think is about the same as this one.

anyway, my answer to your question why you are getting random email is 
because you're subscribed to sfraves.  ravers are random in their 
dancing and in their conversation.  sorry.  it's not just me -- really.

"I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes 
me to tremble for the safety of my country.  As a result of the war, 
corporations have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places 
will follow, and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong 
its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth is 
aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed."
-Abraham Lincoln

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

  "I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of 
life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the 
beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club, 
party or other sound system that has ever achieved anything close to that..."
-Jeno, on the early days of Wicked and the Full Moon Raves

--=====================_1637344==.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

Today, July 12th, is the 25th anniversary of the Disco Demolition Night 
spectacle.  In Chicago Dahl and his cronies will be celebrating their 
homophobic act again.  So - in response - spin some disco on today to show 
that we respect this seminal dance music and the people who produced it.

Learn about the vocal talents that reveal the anti-disco story that only 
Donna Summer was a worthy disco vocalist to be a lie (witness Teddy 
Pendergrass, Jocelyn Brown, Martha Wash, Stephanie Mills, Barry White, 
etc.)  Learn about the disco message songs that expose the falseness of the 
anti-disco view that all disco is meaningless and vapid (witness "Bad 
Luck", "Ain't No Stoppin' Us Now", "Who Can We Trust", "I Will Survive", 
"Lost in Music", etc.)  Learn about the disco songs that were recorded and 
released and even became hits after 1979, to show that Steve Dahl did not 
succeed.  And then share this knowledge with others.

Love,

Apollo



Disco Demolition Anniversary Celebrates 'The Day Disco Died'

     CHICAGO, July 8 /PRNewswire/ -- Monday, July 12 marks the 25th anniversary
of "The Day Disco Died," when nearly 90,000 people showed up at Chicago's
Comiskey Park to participate in radio disc jockey Steve Dahl's Disco
Demolition. The "Disco Sucks" demonstration is widely credited for causing the
official demise of disco, and 25 years later, Dahl is sending a message to the
world again: "Disco Still Sucks."

     "People said I did the world a favor by taking one of the most inane music
genres and relegating it to karaoke bars for all time," says Dahl. "I was just
doing what came naturally: hating disco."

     The event began as an effort to sell seats at a White Sox/Detroit Tigers
double-header, and turned into a mass anti-disco movement from which disco
never recovered. Fans were encouraged to show up with an admission of $0.98
and a disco record that would be blown up at center field between the games;
chaos ensued when tens of thousands of baseball fans and listeners stormed the
field, causing the Chicago White Sox to forfeit the second game.  The rare
cancellation of an American League baseball game due to fans destroying the
field is still listed by ESPN as one of the top 10 most shocking moments in
baseball history.

     The event earned Dahl national notoriety, and 25 years later he is still
Chicago's no. 1 disc jockey among 25- to 54-year-olds, with a listening
audience of about 400,000 people each week on WCKG-FM (105.9) weekday
afternoons from 2 - 7 p.m.

     A movie about the Disco Demolition is in development with State Street
Pictures, the producers behind the Chicago-based blockbusters "Soul Food,"
"Barbershop" and "Barbershop II: Back in Business." The script is being
written by Second City alumni Bob Odenkirk (HBO's "Mr. Show") and Jim Zulevic.

     And disco has never recovered.

"I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes 
me to tremble for the safety of my country.  As a result of the war, 
corporations have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places 
will follow, and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong 
its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth is 
aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed."
-Abraham Lincoln

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

  "I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of 
life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the 
beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club, 
party or other sound system that has ever achieved anything close to that..."
-Jeno, on the early days of Wicked and the Full Moon Raves

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Disco Demolition Anniversary

Hey now. In all fairness this was as much a negative reaction to
corporate music as a homophobic thing. Probably more anti-corporate
than homophobic, really. I'm from Chicago and Steve Dahl is a bit of
an ape, but the story I got from "Last Night A DJ Saved My Life" went
like this:

1. Disco, the underground scene
    (The Loft, The Paradise Garage)

2. Is discovered by corporations

3. And given loads of money

4. Corporate re-creations of disco songs and clubs
    (Studio 54, Dolly Parton's disco song)

5. Corporations are desperate for new ideas

6. Corporations absolutely hammer the disco thing
    ("Saturday Night Fever")

7. Public gets really sick of it

8. Steve Dahl/"Disco Sucks" riot

it's kind of like what happened with the dot-com boom, in a way.

I know Bill Brewster and I worked at the Paradise Garage.  Perhaps you had 
to live through it all....:)  One of the reasons disco really died is that 
the corporations really didn't make all the money they thought they 
would.  Twelve inch singles weren't that profitable, and compilation EPs 
didn't have the mixes the public wanted.

However, there was a strong middle America reaction to what was perceived 
then as the homosexualization of America.  If you want some background on 
the times written by those who experienced them (in the USA), you might 
read my "House Music 101" or the well-researched work recently published by 
Duke University Press:  "Love Saves the Day," by Tim Lawrence.

Love,

"I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes 
me to tremble for the safety of my country.  As a result of the war, 
corporations have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places 
will follow, and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong 
its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth is 
aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed."

Agreed, Dahl has "homophobia" written all over him. For fuck's sake,
the guy paraded around in a *military* uniform protesting what--a style
of music? If it wasn't a reaction to homosexuality, it was a publicity
stunt for his radio station. Check out the poster promoting the 25th
anniversary:

<http://www.discodemolition.com/poster/index.htm>

Brought to you by Bud Light and SuperCuts... classy. I find it really
hard to believe that corporate radio DJs like Dahl have *ever* been
champions of musical integrity.

Bill is revising the "Last Night" book to correct and expand some of the 
discussion of the disco era.  He plans to interview me and others from 
those days when he visits the states soon.  He and Frank also have a 
website and discussion board in the UK.

Everyone is always looking for a fast and easy way to make loads of 
money:)  Nothing new here.  A large chunk of the disco business was, 
however, controlled by gay entrepreneurs like Mel Cheren (West End 
Records).  His lover ran the PG and Mel was the money behind the 
club.  Barry Lederer, one of the original DJs at the gay firehouse in the 
early seventies, wrote the disco columns in Billboard, etc. We used to call 
them the "Disco Mafia."

Love,

Apollo

"I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes 
me to tremble for the safety of my country.  As a result of the war, 
corporations have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places 
will follow, and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong 
its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth is 
aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed."
-Abraham Lincoln

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

  "I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of 
life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the 
beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club, 
party or other sound system that has ever achieved anything close to that..."

hello, this is a continuation of a fictional piece:
 
"hey, listen to this:
 
'what if everyone decided to have a great idea that they each thought was just totally original at the same time, but the idea was actually the same or very, very similar to each and every other person's idea, and THEN, they all on their own put the idea into motion at about the same time, and THEN, after that, other people got the idea on their own to copy that idea, and isn't that how civilization got started?' "
 
"is that your book?"
 
"no. it is just my idea. thank god for fiction. it is the only thing that truly matters." :)

here's quote from a mail i received from dj seven:

"DJ Seven 'Lucky 7' Listings



Thanks to all of you who turned out for our 'Vivid' party at WISH on
Friday and our
'Lo-Rise' night at Suede on Sat. night.  Fun weekend..capped it off with
Deep End
Camp DJs at the EndUp, Sunset in Golden Gate Park and loft party at 227
Ellis on
Sunday.  Way too much fun..and on that note,  I have decided that I am not
partying
any more.  Please support me in this major life decision.  I realized that
at 34 I
am not getting any younger and certainly want to preserve my youth and
energy as
long as possible.  Thanks. (How did this email just get so personal?)"

I have 2 questions,
a) what's age got to do with it?
b) does this mean he's not going to dj anymore?

inquiring minds want to know,
Jonas

Probably not. DJ Tronic has continued to build his label Resistance 
Recordings from the ground up, watching it become one of the premiere Hard 
labels in the world with many top DJ's playing his material. All this along 
with his recent touring of France and Spain, as well as his busy touring

THE NICE GUYS [NO LEFT TURN & DJ REESE]
|| KFA / Liquidvinyldjs.com ||
When they're not out being nice somewhere, they're out getting drunk. All 
jokes aside, these two are starting to make waves in the Hardcore world, 
with their two upcoming releases on KFA, as well as other material released 
on Raw Elements and Bedlam. Prepare for the Nice Guys, dropping a 
not-so=nice set!

THE NATURAL DISASTERS [THE DOCTOR & RECLIPSE]

J-MARR & CARLOS ALFONZO
|| Bayraves.com / Liquidvinyldjs.com / Soop Recordings / BeatSupreme.com ||

Alright, the last time we had these two together during a set, they did more 
passing out of food than actually playing. While we can't promise the same 
feast, we can promise a rockin set that only these two can bring!

well worth considering. you know I like theory.

or at least, you may or may not know I like theory, depending on how
much you had to drink the other night, after I told you that I like
theory, but I do, as it happens, like theory.

after literally years of frustration and burnout I randomly picked up
a bass -- having totally lost interest in any and all aspects of
electronic music except for listening to it in the car -- and I found
I was suddenly interested again. not only that, but I actually sounded
all right, too. especially once I started brushing up on scales,
modes, and keys.

studying theory is the shit.

doot dee doo.

With any luck, he'll turn his massive spam list in to a list for his own 
positive-growth personal-power motivational newsletters.
I know I personally can't wait to see the gems that come from the 
innermind of the magnanimous DJ Seven.

Hey Michael, I think you did him in at your company party :D

Subject: Re: [sfraves] logic pro audio certification class?

You're crazy. I took 2 years of theory in college. As much as it gave terms
and names to things that I understood inherently it also ruined a lot of my
desire to pursue music professionally. When I started getting into theory
that was so math like in teachings I turned off and lost interest. Btw - I
do remember a big chunk of our convo, but it's fragmented. =)

It was good seeing//talking to you though!

Subject: [sfraves] Twenty five years ago! [skylab2000]


Wow.

Twenty five years ago TODAY, the US space station "skylab" fell out of 
orbit and crashed to the ground in Australia!!

In the weeks before there was widespread worldwide panic as no one really 
knew where the 78 ton ship would crash!!!!  Ah, fun times..

Back here today, Dennis of skylab2000 is well out of orbit and is safe in 
the studio working on new music.

Some news: New releases on compilations coming out in late July and in 
early October. Live skylab2000 shows in July, Aug, Sep, Oct in NY, Philly, 
LA and many more cities. Full details can be found on the skylab2000 web site:

http://skylab2000.com

Lastly, since there's always new folks on the net, I'm gonna slip some 
quick bio info in here for the folks who don't know about us. If you are 
familiar with the band, thanks for reading this!

Mission control out


  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

skylab2000 is not a DJ or a 'laptop' band. This is a 100% LIVE performance. 
With a full set of synths, samplers and a computer onstage, a skylab2000 
show is an experience. This music is made live, changing to the crowds 
needs and creating a ride to remember.

Where did it start? Since 1994, Dennis Barton has been traveling city to 
city as skylab2000 playing his brand of hard hitting dance music. Hard 
house, progressive, techno, and trance are skylab2000's calling cards.

With a father from Detroit and mother from Belgium, he's got dance music in 
his blood. Growing up in NY's disco heyday, and then the early UK rave 
scene, sealed his fate as a electronic music composer.

Los Angeles is now home base, but it's rare to find skylab2000 at home. The 
road is his living room, where most weekends he's off playing an event. 
Local events, massives, and international overseas festivals. He's played 
New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Dallas, Miami, Las Vegas, Anchorage, Puerto 
Rico, Vancouver, Montreal, Russia, Hong Kong, Istanbul, and literally 
hundreds more cities worldwide.

Playing live is the main focus, but this energy is often recorded and 
released. The US release of 'Auburn' includes the first remix by LA's 
Taylor. In the UK, Journeys by DJ released alternate UK mixes, getting a 
huge reaction, including a prestigious leading spot on the BBC with Pete 
Tong's Radio One Essential Selection. Auburn was played heavily by DJs such 
as Sasha, Carl Cox, Keoki, Pete Tong and Taylor. A series of follow up 12" 
releases have gathered similar response.

A handful of tracks were released exclusively on the internet. On the giant 
mp3.com music site alone, two skylab2000 tracks became the number ONE most 
downloaded songs overall. On that site alone, skylab2000 songs clocked 
almost a million downloads!

You can find skylab2000 tracks on mix CDs by Thomas Michael, Superstar DJ 
Keoki, Grover, DJ Psycho-Bitch, John Kelly, Sol Brothers, and Taylor, on 
labels such as Moonshine, Phatt Phunk, 3am Records, Brainiak (UK), City of 
Angels, Genesis Project, JDJ and so many more.

2004 is here. New releases - new cities. Stay tuned!

Feel the energy. Live.

Tong's Radio One Essential Selection. Auburn was played heavily by DJs such 
as Sasha, Carl Cox, Keoki, Pete Tong and Taylor. A series of follow up 12" 
releases have gathered similar response.

A handful of tracks were released exclusively on the internet. On the giant 
mp3.com music site alone, two skylab2000 tracks became the number ONE most 
downloaded songs overall. On that site alone, skylab2000 songs clocked 
almost a million downloads!

You can find skylab2000 tracks on mix CDs by Thomas Michael, Superstar DJ 
Keoki, Grover, DJ Psycho-Bitch, John Kelly, Sol Brothers, and Taylor, on 
labels such as Moonshine, Phatt Phunk, 3am Records, Brainiak (UK), City of 
Angels, Genesis Project, JDJ and so many more.

2004 is here. New releases - new cities. Stay tuned!

Subject: [sfraves] Twenty five years ago! [skylab2000]


Wow.

Twenty five years ago TODAY, the US space station "skylab" fell out of 
orbit and crashed to the ground in Australia!!

In the weeks before there was widespread worldwide panic as no one really 
knew where the 78 ton ship would crash!!!!  Ah, fun times..

Back here today, Dennis of skylab2000 is well out of orbit and is safe in 
the studio working on new music.

Some news: New releases on compilations coming out in late July and in 
early October. Live skylab2000 shows in July, Aug, Sep, Oct in NY, Philly, 
LA and many more cities. Full details can be found on the skylab2000 web site:

http://skylab2000.com

Lastly, since there's always new folks on the net, I'm gonna slip some 
quick bio info in here for the folks who don't know about us. If you are 
familiar with the band, thanks for reading this!

Mission control out


  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

skylab2000 is not a DJ or a 'laptop' band. This is a 100% LIVE performance. 
With a full set of synths, samplers and a computer onstage, a skylab2000 
show is an experience. This music is made live, changing to the crowds 
needs and creating a ride to remember.

Where did it start? Since 1994, Dennis Barton has been traveling city to 
city as skylab2000 playing his brand of hard hitting dance music. Hard 
house, progressive, techno, and trance are skylab2000's calling cards.

With a father from Detroit and mother from Belgium, he's got dance music in 
his blood. Growing up in NY's disco heyday, and then the early UK rave 
scene, sealed his fate as a electronic music composer.

Los Angeles is now home base, but it's rare to find skylab2000 at home. The 
road is his living room, where most weekends he's off playing an event. 
Local events, massives, and international overseas festivals. He's played 
New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Dallas, Miami, Las Vegas, Anchorage, Puerto 
Rico, Vancouver, Montreal, Russia, Hong Kong, Istanbul, and literally 
hundreds more cities worldwide.

Playing live is the main focus, but this energy is often recorded and 
released. The US release of 'Auburn' includes the first remix by LA's 
Taylor. In the UK, Journeys by DJ released alternate UK mixes, getting a 
huge reaction, including a prestigious leading spot on the BBC with Pete 
Tong's Radio One Essential Selection. Auburn was played heavily by DJs such 
as Sasha, Carl Cox, Keoki, Pete Tong and Taylor. A series of follow up 12" 
releases have gathered similar response.

A handful of tracks were released exclusively on the internet. On the giant 
mp3.com music site alone, two skylab2000 tracks became the number ONE most 
downloaded songs overall. On that site alone, skylab2000 songs clocked 
almost a million downloads!

You can find skylab2000 tracks on mix CDs by Thomas Michael, Superstar DJ 
Keoki, Grover, DJ Psycho-Bitch, John Kelly, Sol Brothers, and Taylor, on 
labels such as Moonshine, Phatt Phunk, 3am Records, Brainiak (UK), City of 
Angels, Genesis Project, JDJ and so many more.

2004 is here. New releases - new cities. Stay tuned!

Feel the energy. Live.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] logic pro audio certification class?

Theory's cool..  It's one of those things like speaking a language or
riding a bike- once you're really set with all the knowledge you need,
the "theory" part of things dissapears and suddenly you're left with
the mysterious ability to name chords by ear and compose without going,
"Shit, what key am I in?  What notes would I hit if I knew what key I
was in?".  Until that happens, you're surrounded by textbooks and
menial piano excercises and you're saying, "What in hell has this got
to do with music?".  

That said, obviously a whole lot of people have made staggering music
without any formal theory training.  In certain genres it's almost
considered a disadvantage to have any.  However, writing it off
completely is kind of like saying, "I'm going to write a novel, in
French!  Forget learning how to conjugate verbs though- that's for
losers." ;)  

It's all about what you want to make and what viewpoint you're shooting
for.  Personally, I think I wrote better keyboard parts before I
started learning how to play.  Go figure.  Now that the hands sort of
know where to go, they don't go to the random places they used to.  I
can always revisit the days when I didn't know jack, though- it's
called "smoking mad trees". :)

theory is awesome. I almost feel like musical education is worth
pursuing for its own sake. right now I'm building up this mad list of
all the classes I want to take and it's basically not gonna give me a
moment to even sleep. but it's totally worth it.

for me tho it's not about getting the knowledge I need, it's about
keeping things interesting. check it out. I'm from Chicago originally.
in Chicago I had no money and no social life, but the music I made was
very satisfying. I'm almost tempted to say I was good. then I left
Chicago because I had no money and no social life. literally, I lived
alone, in a ghetto. it was rough. so I moved to California. and I got
money and I got friends. and my music SUCKED. so then I got rid of all
my money and all my friends, which turned out to be a mistake, and
eventually I got decent at making music again. and the thing that made
it happen is something I could have done with money and a life. I
started studying theory again, and I remembered that in Chicago, I was
perpetually unemployed, so I had a lot of time, and I spent a lot of
that time studying theory. I did jazz tracks in 5/4 and classical
music based on "Godel, Escher, Bach." and it was crap, but it was just
done for the sake of learning shit, and later on, when I made
something I actually cared about, my brain was trained on all that
weird shit and it came up with interesting stuff. so yeah. if you ever
decide that making good music is more important to you than having
friends or a safe place to live, don't give up the friends or the safe
place to live. just take some fucking classes. that's my advice in
case anybody out there is half the crazy motherfucker I am.

god, this is ridiculous. I need some sleep. I went to bed at 1am last
night, after working on a track. I woke up again at 3am and started
working on it again. then at 6am I went to Denny's, had breakfast,
came back home, and did some more work. then at 9am I went to my day
job.

ying tong iddle I po.

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: DJ Pat on An Epiphany Of Sound today, 9a-11a

California's pioneering dj pat, is undoubtably north americas first
wet&hard dj.

After years of spinning traditional techno & trance, he finally decided
it was time for a well needed change in direction.  Having been inspired
by the hot new sounds of wet&hard (an infectous new style of underground
club music evolving from new 'eastern' europe) he chose adventure over
security to take this exciting pathway down the road of controversial
club music. And at one of his first wet&hard gigs he was almost arrested
for doing it too!

For those of you who have already been lucky enough to experience the
aural pleasures of dj pat's wet&hard sets, then the sound of this
dj-session will not cum as a surprize to you.  For those who are hearing
this saucy music for the first time, just take a moment to listen to the
music and question why do people like to go to clubs and dance? the
mysteries will be revealed to you over the next two hours.

Some of you may feel embarrassed by the openness of this sound of new
Europe, but that is only an initial, instant shock-reaction towards
blatently approaching the subject of sexuality within an everday
environment.  Give yourself a moment, keep listening and once that shock
has worn off, your expanded tolerance level will allow you to enjoy the
sounds - as the pictures in your mind flash by.

So, what is wet&hard and what makes it so controversial?

Wet&Hard is an original and entertaining underground sound created from
the ruins of techno/trance by top hungarian dj/producer corvin dalek and
berlin based 'flesh' label initiator, Mark Reeder.

Mark Reeder's involvement in electronic music dates back over 20 years.
His most notable (or notorious) accomplishment was creating trance music
in 1989, however he's done so much more.  From making the world's first
record using a roland 606, to releasing the worlds first electronic
music title on MiniDisc, Mark has always been at the forefront of
everything.  When history looks back on electronic music someday, one of
the things that will stand out the most will be the little record label
that Mark founded in communist East Germany.  In spite of its humble
beginning, MFS today stands atop a short list of record labels that have
truly changed electronic music.  While all of its contemporaries
(Harthouse, Guerilla, etc) have gone the way of the dinosaur, MFS has
been there for it all.  The philosophy behind MFS has led it to
accomplish seemingly amazing feats with little or no resources to work
with.  The special vision behind MFS has led to the discovery of now
superstar DJs such as Paul van Dyk, Mijk van Dijk, Humate, Marco
Zaffarano, etc. and their development from obscurity into household
names.  It is a commitment to choosing talent and fresh ideas over a
quick buck that has led MFS to where it is now, and the man behind that
commitment is Mark Reeder.

Corvin meanwhile, has already created some classic wet&hard clubtracks
for marks/the flesh label, such as the legendary pounds&penz, a real man
or pornoground. He successfully performs his musical style around the
world, from colombia to canada, london to china or miami to mexico and
always to ecstatic crowds. mark has also released further wet&hard
material from young people such as jan kessler, fidelity kastrow,
michael burian or eiven major also on flesh.

The message of wet&hard is a positive one. To present to a 21st century
audience an open-minded and tolerant lifestyle and inject more sexuality
into electronic clubmusic, as that is basically what clubbing is really
all about - the sexual ritual of dancing. people used to dance together,
now they dance alone. wet&hard brings the people back together.

It is about openly accepting sex as part of ourselves and our lives and
expressing our sexuality through the language of music - wet&hard music.
remember, we are all the product of one beautifully euphoric event - an
orgasm - and what is bad about that? wet&hard is certainly not violent.
it does not promote racism, nor does it incite intolerance or threaten
mass destruction. it embraces everyone willing to accept its message -
rich, poor, fat, thin, gay, straight, tall or small.

Wet&Hard provides deep piledriving beats and throbbing-groovy basslines
to melt away your inhibitions and turn you on. you can make love to the
music as the music makes love to you. it is not stony-faced industrial,
or seriously minimal like techno can be and its not tawdry or tedious
like tv-trance is. wet&hard is just like falling in love, mysterious and
exciting. it is spongy and yet tough, it is hot and sexy, it is
thrilling and funny and it is very very entertaining.

Its controversy comes from the puritanical attitudes towards music and
the narrow-minded view of how club music should 'apparently' sound. that
is merely an elitist opinion. surely, some of you will hate it and some
of you will love it. but you decide for yourself.

Wet&Hard is imaginitive, fresh, young music for a new generation of
open-minded and adventurous clubbers to play with. with wet&hard you can
also be a part of something new and exciting too. so, simply soak in the
sounds, cum with us and think about what you would really like to do
after work.

JC,

Thanks for the informative write up.

You know I'm really digging this sound, whether its
Tues or Thurs, plus wet&hard style might give me an
excuse to finally play that track "Finger Fuck" I
bought for some unknown reason one day when I was
drunk a few years back...

best,

Peter

Maybe I'm just nuts - but this pretty much sounds like NYC tribal house to 
me. A little trancey - but it has that Danny Tenaglia, deep & dark feel.

Just another subgenrefication that is wholly unnecessary...not bad music 
tho.

they're just on marketing overload. the man behind that particular
hype machine also won the Guiness world record for most turntables
mixed on simultaneously by spinning on 12 tables at a party in Germany
or Eastern Europe or something. he just did it to draw attention to
his career.

"wet & hard" is really more a brand name than a genre.

What, you mean I'm wrong in classifying Hard Progressive Guido

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Dubtribe?

I haven't seen them around for a while.  Last time my
wife and I saw them it was maybe 2 years back a bit
before Sunshine and Moonbeam had their son.  It was a 
DJ set in the basement at Club 6, and well, it was
REAL GOOD.  There was one track in particular in which
Sunshine rapped about the sparkly party people that
got it and those other people that didn't in the most
positive uplifting sort of way.  It was a really
precise and skillful delivery of his message that you
just don't hear in any medium very often.  Anyhow I've
been trying to get this track ever since, but hey I
forgot to ask what it was called ;)  

If they play in SF I'll  be there (and hopefully my
wife too).

Peace,

Peter

Well yeah.  I always liked Dannny's stuff so its not
surprising I like this too.  I like the  word
"subgenrefication" too ;)

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

hello, we are aware that sometimes some folks are just way interested, but also, just was too busy to keep up or that they accidentally erase, read into, fall asleep, fall into a state, etc., and that prevents them from keeping up or getting on with it. so, here is a rerun from yesterday's installment in the spirit of dr. phil reruns:

hello, this is a continuation of a fictional piece:

"hey, listen to this:

'what if everyone decided to have a great idea that they each thought was just totally original at the same time, but the idea was actually the same or very, very similar to each and every other person's idea, and THEN, they all on their own put the idea into motion at about the same time, and THEN, after that, other people got the idea on their own to copy that idea, and isn't that how civilization got started?' "

"is that your book?"

"no. it is just my idea. thank god for fiction. it is the only thing that truly matters." :)

Maybe you can't stop love, you can sure repress the fuck out of it. I hope 
better sense prevails in this vote and people get the opportunity to marry 
however they want - but i highly doubt it will happen.

that was a Constitutional amendment? [googlegooglegoogle] hey yeah,
amendment numero 18. good point...this is just the MoveOn.org standard
boilerplate...

the amendment probably hasn't got a chance in hell of passing. it's
really just a decoy issue, pretty standard Republican tactic. but
still...

> remember - you can't stop love.

word. here, btw, your CD rawx. I was listening to it yesterday at
work, I got back from a meeting with my laptop, started the CD up
again, and realized I should have remembered to plug my headphones
back in first. this drumbeat starts coming out of my laptop and
wafting over the corporate cubicle walls along with a voice going
"tonight we're all gonna get high..."

Party Description:
Let's party to defeat King George and tell Kerry to change his tune to a 
rhythm that's in sync with a more compassionate world vibe!  Come hear 
great music, dance, listen to a quick word from Daniel Ellsberg (in person) 
and help WeCount raise much needed funds to help get Bush out of office and 
push Kerry to the left.

This is a benefit party for WeCount.org to go to the National Democratic 
Convention in Boston.  WeCount.org a San Francisco NGO working for a more 
progressive America -- an America with compassion for all people of the 
world, one that protects the environment and does not wage unjust war.

Performers include Riffat Sutlana & Party, DJ Beatwalla, NEO EON ONE, 
Micropixie, Stellar Gas Jets and live tabla players.

Appetizers provided. 21 and over please.

Special Guest Daniel Ellsberg!
With his courageous outing of the Pentagon Papers in 1969, Mr. Ellsberg is 
famous for helping to bring an end to the Vietnam War.  Now he's working 
against the Bush Administration's next generation war machine.

Special Appearance by Jeff Grubler of the Ronald Reagan Home for the 
Criminally Insane!
SF Bay Guardian Local Hero award winner Jeff Grubler has prepared a special 
rap and will debut it at the party.

Performers/Line-up:

Riffat Sultana & Party
A beautiful, powerful and infectious voice that always gets people dancing. 
Riffat is the daughter of Ustad Salamat Ali Khan, who was universally 
recognized and acclaimed as the finest Pakistani Classical singer of his 
time. Riffat's family represents a 500-year lineage of musicians hailing 
from the Sham Chaurasi Gharana (school of music). Riffat's vocals have been 
recorded for numerous labels including Ark 21/Universal, Triloka/Mercury, 
Hearts of Space, City of Tribes, 6 Degrees and XDot25.

neo
eon
one...
combines lush, intricate soundscapes with insightful lyrics, culminating in 
a surprisingly entertaining mix. His audacious audio and vivacious video
shows at San Francisco's Oxygen Bar have become a monthly treat for steady 
fans and random passersby alike. His first full-length CD is expected to 
land in 2004.

DJ Beatwalla...
dishes up delectable dance grooves concocted from the some of the grooviest 
international beats available.  Dance 'til closing time.

Stellar Gas Jets...
taps into the collective groove encircling spaceship Earth and opens up a 
channel of killer sounds for us all to share.  Specialists of live 
instrumentation using keyboards, drum and bass, Stellar Gas Jets' alchemy 
of acid jazz transports the willing and able to a new cosmic plane.

Micropixie...
is a singer-songwriter, verbal & visual artist who hails from London via 
Paris [altho' she was made in Bombay]. Her cosmic gypsy meanderings have 
recently landed her in San Francisco. A debut album, due for release in 
Summer '04, fuses her love of technology with a musically minimalist
sensibility. Her lyrics are disarmingly personal; it's as if you're 
eavesdropping on her inner life as an alien on this planet.

"I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes 
me to tremble for the safety of my country.  As a result of the war, 
corporations have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places 
will follow, and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong 
its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth is 
aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed."
-Abraham Lincoln

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

  "I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of 
life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the 
beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club, 
party or other sound system that has ever achieved anything close to that..."
-Jeno, on the early days of Wicked and the Full Moon Raves

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Disco Demolition Anniversary

Or perhaps, even, he just really.... really.... disliked disco.  It's 
not like it's impossible just to greatly dislike a genre of music, 
without actually hating the people who like said genre of music.  For a 
good example of the latter, I like happy hardcore.... a lot....  the 
cheezier, the better.  And there are people I could name, on SFRaves, 
with whom I get along just fine, who have had quite the negative lot to 
say about happy hardcore.  In fact, I'd bet that happycore is easily 
the most-maligned genre on the whole list.

OTOH, having been a mere toddler when disco was dying, and I think it 
be wiser to defer to Apollo's first-hand experience in this matter.  If 
he remembers a homophobic message on the part os this Steve Dahl (Any 
relation to Geri, I wonder?) character, I don't doubt it was there.

On the gripping hand, I think it's a mistake to equate 'anti-disco' 
with 'homophobic'.

I'm bi, out, and to be honest, trending significantly more towards boys 
than girls  (Ironinc thing being, I'm increasingly finding myself in 
situations where it's more socially awkward to admit that I still like 
some girls than it used to be to admit that I like boys.... but that's 
another story.).  And I can't stand disco.

I wouldn't go so far as to say I actively *HATE* disco.  And I 
certainly wouldn't waste my time starting an 'anti-disco' movement....  
But you certainly won't catch me a '70s night.  And, even at a real 
party, if I'm in the house room, and the DJ starts playing something 
that sounds like it's tainted by the touch of disco, I'll make a quick 
beeline to the other room.  I think I'd even rather be in a jungle room 
than a disco room.  More than one time, this year at Pride, I found 
myself thinking: "For fuck's sake.... the organizers of this shindig 
have GOT to realize, eventually, that the '70s are over, dead, and best 
buried and forgotten!".  I thanked my lucky stars, several times, for 
the Tantra stage, and its refuge of real dance music in a sea of crap*.

So, since I hate disco, and I'm more homo than hetro, does that mean I 
hate myself?  Obviously, no.

(* Which could lead me off onto another tangent about how the "gay 
scene" has the stereotype of having superior music; and how untrue I've 
found that stereotype to be.  Yeah, I know: stereotypes are bad, 
hmkayy.  But that was a POSITIVE stereotype!)


cya,
john

Hey guys, only a few days until the best party of the summer. Lets get away

that has TWO stages outside and two inside. Lets party overlooking the

this. And if you have been to Kelly's, you can tell everyone else why they
should come for this 18+ event there.

The more birthdays one has, the more people want to buy them drinks.
 
This will be #36 for me and I think I've already been threatened with 3
times that many shots of "insert alcholic beverage here"
 
My motto for the night will be "stay vertical"
 
thank gosh for the early timeslot...
 
remember... stay vertical.

To: dj.soundwave@gmail.com
Cc: djpat@dj-pat.com

We are reading the coments on DJ Corvin Dalek & DJ Pat & his wet 'n' hard
sound.
We think it is sad when you are thinking like this. You are ignorant
Americana with NO idea about anything what is happening here in Eastern
European underground music scene. We in East now more about scene in USA &
UK & you know nothing about us!
How many Eastern Europe DJs have you seeing play? How many partys have you
been too in East Europe? Why Corvin play with 12 decks? you say it is
marketing. What is wrong with marketing? you live in USA biggest marketing
country of the world, USA wanted East Europe to become Capitalist menatilty
so we destroyed the Communists & became Capitalist. Now we are being told is
wrong to make marketing? Techno is famous with marketing, Trance is famous
with marketing or? You have to read the Biog on his website. It was special
event & Corvin was special DJ of night.  He wanted to make impress in West
as East DJ is that wrong? Corvin Dalek is our Guru. He is exzellent & most
famous East DJ. He is residnet DJ in The Gallery in London most famous club
& He is headlining DJ in many countries of world. If he is shit DJ why? if
he playing shit music why? No. Corvin is creating a new style of music for
East to be proud with. He has inspiretion us all here & given us motivation
too show how we are without direct copying UK or USA style. We have all been
inspired by US & UK music from the past times, but now we play our own style
with a few Eastern European style & new name to make distances, like a
remix. YOU just do not understand anything or maybe you are all scared of
likeing erotikmusic style?.
keep it wet 'n' hard!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Disco Demolition Anniversary

Happycore sucks unless you're drunk off your ass and terrorizing the kids
bouncing to it. Yeah I think happycore is the whipping boy of the greater
rave scene. I will say that I'd listen to happycore *any* fucking day rather
than having to hear that crap that Kid606//Mochapet played at Otherworld
last time. It's too bad the flames that shot out of the bassbin didn't shoot
out of the monitors instead and torch those asses for being musical
dickheads.

disco is pretty lame. wonder if it would be cool at 180BPM? =)

Boot off a floppy or CD and run a password cracker to get the admin

Gunna be crazy.  I'm at the point where I'm counting minutes instead of
days.  Cantos has it all wrong.  It isn't just 3 days away, it's 3421
minutes away!  By the time you get this e-mail it could even be closer to
3,200 minutes... and just think of that! Hehee... I'm going crazy.

Okay, time to get the insurance squared away and restock Skills and F8...

That's a nice attitude. DJ Pat seemed to make it very clear that he was
a champion of "wet&hard", and it sounds as though people were
underwhelmed. So either Pat didn't do a very good job of representing
the sound, or the sound itself isn't that impressive. Obviously though,
you can't judge a style of music by a single DJ set.

Personally I found it very similar to deep progressive house and (as
Van Mundegaarde mentioned) the New York tribal stuff (Tenaglia, et al).
Maybe the Final Scratch malfunction is to blame, but what I heard
certainly didn't sound as fresh and unique (or raw and sexy, for that
matter) as what had been advertised. That's my 2c.

Cheers,

Subject: RE: [sfraves] make distances, like a remix

Good lord...  man what a bunch of unnessary drama.

First of all I would like to apologize for the technical difficulties
yesterday.  It was the first time I had used final scratch in a 'random'
environment and all of the horror stories I had heard about it came
true, and then some.  I know what you are saying about feeling
underwhelmed, I was too.. I was practically in tears.  I hate it when
gear fucks up and this time it was my fault (I could have just burned
all that shit to cd and brought CD players but I was lazy).

Quite clearly I didn't do a good job of representing the sound.  To say
wet & hard is similar to progressive house is quite wrong.  Yesterday I
was lucky enough to have a crate of "tool" records with me in the car so
I ended up mostly playing those while final scratch attempted to burn
the building down, so it may just be that my extra shit sounded
progressive.  Needless to say, I didn't plan on playing most of what I
played yesterday. =20

Now as far as wet & hard goes, and what the forwarded email said (I have
no clue who this guy is but it was probably one of the thousands of
polish people who visit my website) I would have to agree, at least in
part, with what he said and his attitude.

I must say however, that the reactions that I saw on SF raves (and the
other ones J.C. was kind enough to send me from other places he spammed)
was exactly what I have expected, albeit a little less creative than I'm
used to.

I'm not directing this at anyone in particular because your comments
were quite tame... but I know there were others out there that had even
more severe thoughts about the BSP or the 'set' (although I wouldn't
call it a set.. it was more like fill in the blank space so jc doesn't
kill me) and chose not to send them to sfr for whatever reason.

To you... I pity you. You have completely missed the point of what we
(myself, corvin, etc) are doing.  As a little bit of history.. the man
behind wet & hard (mark reeder) is the same genius (or idiot if u
prefer) who invented trance back in the 80s.  And being the old fart
that I am, I remember quite clearly criticisms very similar to these
being said about trance in the early 90s.  First it was "its not real".
Then it was "it sounds like techno to me" then it was "trance is gay"
and finally 15 years later it is now "god im so sick of this trance
bullshit".  Along the way Mark was kind (or evil) enough to bring you
today's superstar djs and producers like Paul van Dyk, Cosmic Baby,
Humate, Mijk van Dijk, and so on. =20

This is the same process that trance went through during the early 90s.
To us, it was very real.  To the haters, it was just a marketing trick.
Or a gimmick. =20

It is so easy to copy what others have done before, but how boring is
that? We are the adventurous ones laying the foundations for something
new, and if you see no value in that then more power to you.  All I can
say is that the same things were said about trance and the people who
didn't have an open mind back then were left behind.

Nobody is expecting wet & hard to become massive.  It is much too sexual
and purposefully so.  It will never get peak radio time here in the
states and probably won't ever get any mass attention like trance and
house have.  And to that I say good.  Look at what a heaping pile of
hamster shit trance has become over the last 5 years.  But on the flip
side of the coin, the same was said of trance and look what happened.  =20

Over the last two years corvin has managed to not only crack the ranks
of the superstar dj world but he's completely defined it.  Who would
have ever thought that a crowd at creamfields (not exactly known for
promoting the must underground or best music) would boo oakenfold off
the stage so they could watch a midget from hungaria play wet & hard,
but that's exactly what happened last year. =20

I could go on and on but you're already bored by now.  All I can say is
thanks to J.C. for having the open mind that he does and giving me the
rare opportunity to do my thing with no strings attached.  And thanks to
you guys on SF raves who were open minded enough to at least read and
tune in for a bit.  I'm terribly sorry that final scratch tried to burn
the building down and hence you didn't get a proper introduction to the
sound, but I thank you at least for giving it a try.

Hopefully the next time I can crawl out from under this pile of shit on
my desk and play again, things will work properly and you will get a
real opportunity to experience wet & hard for what it is:  wet & hard. =20

And that's what it is.  Its not a marketing trick, its not a gimmick,
and its not a stunt.  It literally cums from the clubs of eastern Europe
and hence I don't expect any of you to recognize that as valid or even
give a shit.  There literally hasn't been anything new in electronic
dance music in almost 10 years.  Wet & hard is new.  Its new for the
21st century.  Whether or not you think of it as a steaming pile of crap
is for you to decide.  I just want to make it clear that if you do think
it's a steaming pile of crap, just keep in mind that it's a new pile of
crap that you haven't stepped in before and maybe you might enjoy
stepping in it =3D).  And in the end I think having a new pile of crap =
to
step in is a good thing, and even better yet you have people like J.C.
who work to bring you new shit....

I'm sorry it was such a disaster J.C.... speaking of which I forgot to
mention that most of the "wet & hard" stuff is not legal to play on air
here in the states.  You were going to get a watered down set anyways.
So if that set was a watered down version of a significantly watered
down version of wet & hard...  it probably is as provocative as its said
to be....

Breast wishes,
p a t

I think it's actually a DJ set which'll be on the radio
tomorrow...some pretty good free publicity actually. if there's any
actual champion-ing involved, I think it'll happen tomorrow morning on
KZSU. "the hard & wet throw-down!" etc.

I don't have any real opinions on the style one way or another, I just
thought that calling it a unique genre kinda seemed like a stretch.
this guy in Eastern Europe read a whole lot of additional ideas into
that...

I actually was going to unsub last night, taking too much time for
e-mail etc., kinda like turning off your tv for a while etc., but when
I found that waiting for me in my inbox, unsubbing became impossible.
it was the funniest thing I'd seen all day.

same here, really.

Sure do!! It is called FORMAT.   =D

Well Linux has a password breaker that works on 2k and XP boxes but it is a 
bit tricky to get it to work. You need to use recovery consol and it half 
the time it breaks the admin password. I believe it sets it to blank or 
gives you the option to set it, forget which one?? I only worked with  one 
other time. But if the company does PC Scans at nigtht like my company 
does.. You could get busted pretty fast if you add types of software etc..

you make it sound like some kind of Slavic equivalent to
ghetto-tech...and you mentioned midgets in your e-mail...the other guy
said something about "the pornoground"...that combination makes me
nervous...what has capitalism done to Eastern Europe? they didn't have
Hungarian midget porn ghetto-tech under the Communists...

I dunno, dude, all I really said is that it sounds like tribal house
to me and giving it a distinct genre name seems kinda unrealistic. and
that Corvin Dalek only played on 12 turntables so he could say "I
played on 12 turntables." I'm not a hater. haters care...

anyway, if you're posting my address on your web site, you have to
post my sig too.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] make distances, like a remix

I didn't think comparing "wet&hard" to NYC tribal house was that far a 
stretch really. I have heard many similar style tracks played at the Tunnel 
in '99, '00 and '01 - how is it that new? I didn't find the music bad at all 
- I kind of liked some of it - but it is FAR from groundbreaking or 
innovative.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] make distances, like a remix

Haha... sorry yo... I sent some of the comments off to the label owner
and left in the "from sent to" bit on a few of them. =20

I didn't call you a hater.  In fact I specifically said in my email how
SF raves was quite open minded (compared to elsewhere) and how u at
least took the time to read the email and/ or tune in.

If I make it sound like some sort of Slavic equivilant to ghetto-tech
I'm terribly sorry as that is the last thing I want to do.

As much as I love ghetto tech, and as much as I love having andy w come
up to sac and piss off everybody at my parties by completely shocking
them...  the only thing ghetto-tech and wet & hard have in common is...
they can both be pressed on vinyl =3D)

" what has capitalism done to Eastern Europe? they didn't have Hungarian
midget porn ghetto-tech under the Communists..."

That is the funniest shit I've ever read.  I have to find a way to
incorporate that into something.  Its just too funny to forget...

I think the point about wet & hard is this:  eastern Europe is almost
entirely catholic (even under communism).  I'll leave you to fill in the
blanks but we've all heard stories/jokes or actively pursued catholic
school girls for some strange reason.  You put two and two together...
Wet & hard, unlike ghetto tech, is not meant to be offensive (although
I'd love to send one of my CDs to asscroft and secretly watch his
reaction) and its certainly not ghetto.  Wet & hard is the sound of
eastern European clubbers, who are definitely far more sexual than their
American counterparts.  And it's a celebration of that sexuality, not
makin fun of it like ghetto tech does.  And by sexuality I don't mean
everybody there is a whore.  What I mean is that to them, there are no
puritanical taboos about sexuality like there are here in the states.
It's a different culture and that difference is definitely reflected in
the music.

Anyways... I didn't specifically direct my comments at you.  I found
nothing wrong with your comments.  If you wanna call my music tribal
house... more power to you!  You can call it whatever you want.  Wet &
hard is what you make of it.  Its your fantasy... if you fantasize about
tribal house...  then who am I to judge?=20

I didn't mean to personally attack anybody.. I just felt that I needed
to explain something since my so-called 'set' yesterday was such a
steaming pile of shit.  Normally, the music pretty much explains itself
but since I hardly played any wet & hard... there wasn't much of an
explanation....

Keep it wet & hard...
XXX,
p a t

OK so now that all that's out of the way... where would one find some
good examples of "wet & hard" on the interweb (mixes, preferably)? I
have to admit, I'm curious to hear what all the fuss is about...

Heres a few links:

I must warn you.  I played at that show with corvin and it was fucking
cold.  So fucking cold I spent the next two weeks in bed.  Its split in
the middle because final scratch died (go figure!) so I'm not going to
say that's the best mixing ever... but it's a very good cross section of
wet & hard tracks.

There's also a ton of w&h sets on my website ranging in quality from
absolutely mindblowingly good to utter pieces of shit that I haven't had
time to take down yet =3D).  You can get them at www.djpat.com

I think corvin also has some links at www.corvindalek.de

And you can check out (but I don't have the time this second to puruse
them for the actual set links):

http://www.eivenmajor.com/

http://www.jankessler.com/

http://www.mrsam.tv

http://electromajk.com/


I'll dig up some more links to stuff online if anybody is interested...

Also, timo maas briefly toyed with wet & hard a few years ago
(2000,2001) so any of his sets from that time period would be wet &
hard.  And today mr. sam and Oliver Klein both play a pg13 version of
wet & hard.  They've both made some really awesome wet & hard tracks and
remixes over the last few years and the forthcumming album by mr sam on
tiesto's label is...  wet & hard... which is quite shocking.  They
aren't nearly as over the line as someone like corvin dalek is, but they
play wet & hard nonetheless.  They just do it in their own way.  So
check soulseek for some sets by them.  Stay away from their commercial
mix CDs however, as they are known as "trance" djs and hence their
commercial (aka have to pay the bills) CDs reflect that...

Breast wishes,

Pat,

You know I've heard you play wet & hard scores of times. I, and most 
everyone else in the place, always compares it to techouse or NY tribal.

Whoever it was that said "it's more of a brand than a new genre" was as on 
point as can be. Or maybe it's a sub-sub-genre?

You're the one that told me that "Cookie Dough Dynamo" and a few other 
Sondos releases were Wet & Hard. How are people NOT going to compare it to 
NY Tribal?

Either way, the sub-sub-genre has some phenominal tracks to be played from 
time to time. I was playing some "wet & hard" mixes of some techno tracks 
remixed by Corvin, Evian Major, Samuel L Sesions, and Timo Maas well before 
anyone refered to it as a genre.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] make distances, like a remix

Now before I get roasted for sounding argumentative, let me preface this by 
saying - I am listening to this "IamDalek" mix, and it is not too damn bad 
at all.

But I seriously don't see this as anything new. I could go to any number of 
places in NYC and hear similar sounds, complete with sleazy vocals, beats, 
etc.

It never ceases to amaze me how many times a year, some "new" genre of EDM 
comes out, and everyone who plays it wants to make it into the "next big 
thing" or call it "innovative" when clearly to anyone who has been listening 
to dance music for the last 20 years or so, it's really not. ALL dance music 
is about sex, and freedom, and letting yourself go, and vibe, etc. etc. I 
have heard deep house sets that were every bit as sexy, if not moreso 
(albeit they were sans porno vocals). I have heard breakbeat sets that had 
the dancefloor practcally writhing - and the same can be said for techno, 
trance, D&B, etc.

This sound is good - it's hard, it's pulsating, and it grooves, but it is 
nothing new.

That being said - where can a genre slut such as myself find some of this 
shit on vinyl? I will gladly mix some of into one of my sets. I can hear 
this stuff slipping right in the middle of some nasty breaks or tech-house, 
or even progressive (the hard, driving kind).

ez.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] make distances, like a remix

I don't see anything arugmentative in your email at all.  J.C. gave
everybody a chance to hear wet & hard (many for the first time)
yesterday and my final scratch blew it.  Without hearing the music its
kinda lame to comment on it, but after hearing it if you still feel that
it sounds like the old NYC tribal house sound (ala tribal America, etc)
then more power to you. =20

You've now gotten to hear wet & hard.  Before you hadn't.  As for buying
the vinyl...  I dunno what to tell you.  You and everybody else (incl
pete tong and all the other washed up old men) wants that stuff on
vinyl.  Eveything you are hearing on the "I am a dalek" CD was either
not released, or it was pressed on vinyl by Flesh Records Berlin, an MFS
sublabel created specifically for wet & hard (because MFS is still
associated with trance and techno people like paul van dyk and humate).


For the remixes that corvin, oliver, mr. sam etc have done I always try
juno.co.uk or any of your online record stores.  The problem with
finding "wet & hard" stuff is one guy calls it NYC tribal house, the
next guy calls it trance, the next guy calls it techno.  You will see
the same record listed many different ways on different websites.

The best place to get stuff from jurgen driessen (one of the best wet &
hard producers there is by far, even tho he doesn't have the balls to
call it wet & hard) is from www.mutekki-media.de.  Jurgen is the nicest
guy in the world and will get you your shit fast.  If he doesn't have
something in stock he'll find it for you.  Now that's only for two
labels.  The stuff on Q Records can be bought directly from their
website. =20

MFS/Flesh doesn't have an online shop yet so your stuck tryin to find it
somewhere else. =20

The names to watch out for are people like corvin dalek, jurgen
driessen, oliver klien, eiven major, mr sam, martin H.  You just have to
search and listen.  The sordid nature of the music has really kept it
underground (which is good) so some of the artists (like mr. sam) make
trance records to pay the bills and then make the real shit on the side.
It's a pain in the ass...  but once you start looking you'll notice a
pattern real quick on which stores carry which crap.

juno.co.uk always carries EVERY record that oliver klein and corvin
dalek remix. The problem is... they sell out and then they're gone.  A
number of other producers in Europe typically associated with " techno"
have tested the wet & hard waters on occasion just for the hell of it.
These are people like DJ Hooligan, Samuel l sessions, Filterheadz, etc.
These are people that have no problem with wet & hard... its just not
their main thing.  But from time to time they'll make a track just for
the hell of it... so you kinda just gotta watch out for them.  But after
a while you'll notice its always the usual suspects.  So just watch the
stores and listen to the Mp3s and what not.  There isn't a buttload of
w&h cuming out every week so its not like yer gonna bankrupt yourself by
looking every week....

I hope that helps and if not I'll give ya more detailed info when time
permits.....

Breast wishes,
p a t

Well, you should have seen how upset Pat was with the set (his
girlfriend was almost upset to tears.)  He didn't get to play hardly ANY
of the really wet'n'hard stuff (and this doesn't take into
consideration the FCC limitations I had to place on him, eliminating
even MORE stuff.)

So I guess what I'm saying, is he deserves the benefit of the doubt.
His set yesterday  wasn't really a true representation of the genre.
For that, he wouldn't be able to play it on the radio. ;)

Oh, and SFR peeps.  One thing Shawn didn't mention is that he'll be on
the show next week.  NOT playing wet'n'hard style.

Yessiree! I may not be playing wet & hard... but if you're into twisted
tech grooves and funky minimal shit, you may very well be wet and hard
when I'm through. :)

BSP forthcoming...

find a copy of winternalsERD, put it in reboot (good sysadmins will make it 
so you cant boot to the cdrom) when it loads up select the partition with 
the winOS you want to get in to, once it boots it will give you a windows 
interface use 'locksmith' to change any password on the sys. if you can get 
that far your sustem admin will wonder what happen the next time they go tot 
remote in and his password does not work, he gets mad! you get fired for not 
following the exceptable usage policy.

Of course, John, and I never implied that those who hate disco are 
homophobic.  That's absurd.  I've always had an ambivalent attitude towards 
the genre myself.  Much of the mainstream product was horrible and my 
tastes in dance music require a bit more funk than folks like the Bee Gees 
supplied:)  I turned my back on the genre completely in the eighties and 
only recently began to look at this music more objectively -- for a variety 
of reasons, but primarily because some folks I knew back in seventies in 
NYC have been supplying me with recorded sets (I knew they existed, but 
people have now begun to rerecord the tapes digitally and produce CDs) made 
at the Paradise Garage, the Loft, the Troc and other excellent dance 
venues.  Virtually nothing that one hears on these tapes was commercially 
successful (mainstream) but there was, and I should have known this because 
I danced to and spun the stuff myself, some awesomely good disco music back 
then.  Even some of the more popular hits, like Le Freak, are quite 
compelling today as recorded and are being rediscovered and remixed -- 
given new life.

But back to Dahl and the disco demolition anniversary.

One really must look at this incident in the context of the times.  After 
Stonewall in 1969 gays began to fight for their rights and the gay urban 
"lifestyle" began to emerge over the next ten years.  I have written about 
this in some detail in House Music 101.  The sexual freedom philosophies of 
the sixties were actualized in the seventies and gay people led the 
way.  To be brief, it was really possible for a decade or so to completely 
fulfill even the most esoteric sexual fantasies without consequence and 
there were subcultures that eagerly supported this "hard and wet" 
experimentation.  I would think that most of you, if you were transported 
back to seventies NYC or SF, would be quite astonished by the ubiquitous 
culture of desire.  These times are so much more "conservative."

Central to the emerging gay subculture was dance.  Before disco, gays 
danced to R&B, Motown and the like and all this morphed into disco.  Gays 
pretty much emulated black dance culture then.  The dancefloor was the 
place where we could come together and celebrate without restriction our 
community and sexuality.  Disco, and the fashion and that emerged from the 
dance, were exclusively "gay" until the mid-seventies.

In the mid-seventies the gay subculture was enthusiastically emulated by 
the mainstream, and this included the eroticization of the male.  A 
hallmark event here was the first Calvin Kline male underwear billboard in 
Times Square:  a hot, hunky male with nothing on but Jockey shorts sporting 
a noticeable bulge in the crotch area.  Men, both straight and gay, began 
wearing VERY tight pants, skimpy shorts, and other gear that were designed 
to be sexually provocative.  This was a first, I think.  The Tarzan of the 
thirties movies may have run about in a loin cloth, but one didn't see him 
bumping and grinding on the dancefloor.

Women's liberation was in full swing.  Birth control was available.  STDs 
could be cured with a shot.  So everyone just jumped on the flesh pile and 
had a good time.  There were straight as well as gay sex clubs.  Swingers 
groups.  Sexual definition was becoming increasingly ambiguous.  I would 
frequently bump into guys who I thought were "straight" in gay orgy 
rooms.  Mick Jagger made a homoerotic film and talked about being 
"bi."  Celebrities would show up in the most unusual places, and there was 
a rumor circulating about that Jackie O fist-fucked one of the dancers at 
the Anvil on night.  Respectable publications would write reviews about new 
sex clubs like the "Toilet."  I realized just how much all this had been 
mainstreamed when, on Halloween, the top selling kids' costumes in NYC were 
based on the Village People, who represented, of course, four popular gay 
sex fetishes.

Middle America began to believe our American way of life was in serious danger.

Hard to recreate all this in a short post, which is growing much too long:)

In the late seventies a conservative reaction to the perceived 
"homosexualization" of America was setting in.  By 1977 the religious right 
was beginning to organize against the gay menace, and one of their most 
successful spokespeople was Anita Bryant, a former pop singer, orange juice 
saleswoman, and Miss America runner up.  In 1978 the US Supreme Court (FCC 
vs Pacifica Foundation) approved restrictions on broadcast material that 
was "indecent" to block gay-themed programming.  The gay liberation 
movement was beginning to meet stiff resistance.  Then, in one defining 
action that same year, Dan White shot and killed openly gay supervisor 
Harvey Milk and Mayor Moscone here in SF City Hall.  The next year White 
was acquitted of first degree murder (the Twinkie defense) and convicted of 
simple manslaughter (he got out of prison in 1985).  Gays rioted in the 
streets everywhere, and in SF police cars were set afire.

It was  in this historical context that Dahl organized the disco record 
burning in Chicago.  Disco, the symbol of gay subculture and its threat to 
many manly males, was ritually burned and a testosterone charged riot 
ensured.  Mainstream culture moved in the direction you grew up in.  AIDS 
put the final nail in the proverbial coffin of sex as pleasure, the 
business of America became productivity and business once again, and here 
we are.

Very brief, skimpy overview of those complex times, but ya get my drift?:)

Love,

Apollo

	I question whether the supposed Eastern European guy is even a real

flawed and not flawed enough at the same time, if you know what I mean. 
On top of the original commercial -- I mean post -- one has to 
wonder... FWIW, I listened to some of the music myself and liked it a 
lot, but at least to my admittedly unrefined musical ears it didn't 
sound like anything particularly different or original.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] make distances, like a remix

Haha!  I wish I was that creative.  But sorry to say the pissed off
eastie kid was for real.  I forwarded some of the funny emails from SF
raves to the label owner because I thought he would find them humorous
(I know I did).  We get the same reaction all the time.  He forwarded
them on to some of his buddies who he thought would find them amusing
and so on.  Apparently one of the easties didn't find it too
entertaining. =20

If you listened to the music and didn't find it different or original,
then I must thank you for at least LISTENING to it.  That's more than
you would get out of most Americans in this day and age....

And as for it being a "commercial"...  well duh!  The last time I played
on J.C.'s show a bunch of people called him, wrote him and wrote sf
raves asking "what the fuck is wet & hard" even though they just got
done hearing it or were in the process of hearing it.  The last time
though, people were asking "what is this music, I've never heard
anything like it" not comparing it to danny tenaglia.  I just thought it
would be a good idea to explain what it was before hand.  And still
there is drama.  So much for the luck of the irish.

At any rate I thank you for giving the music a chance and glad you liked
it.

Keep it wet & hard...

(From Dj Liquid):

I am writing regretfully to inform you that our beloved friend, Chris Vierra 
passed away this morning in a fatal fire in his home.

Chris (Terratraxx Recordings, PI Prod. Seattle) was was not only a gifted 
hard breaks dj but a good person but carried a great spirit and was and will 
always be a positive inspiration.

Chris and his partners in Terratraxx Recordings put their heart and soul to 
develop and re-invent dance music as we have all come to know it... 
innovative sounds, banging tunes, and captivating energy drives its 
owners/co-founders. Nick TerraNova (Dj TerraNova), Alex TerraNova (Dj 
AlxOne) and Chris Vierra (Dj Chris Vierra) push the envelope in the Trance, 
House, Techno and Breakbeat genres.

------
i didn't know chris  as a friend, but his name was well known in the breaks 
scene here.  he played at the first party that i and evil breaks threw, 
FURIOUS.  i played right after him.  he fucking tore it up and was there 
cheering me on when i played.

my thoughts and prayers go out to his family and friends.  god rest his 
soul.

Thanks to Apollo for a very eloquent and informative recounting of the  disco 
era. I was "there" but on the outskirts, not at the actual clubs the way  
Apollo was. I was still an impressionable high school student in the late 70s  
and I agree that Disco was portrayed as "very gay" the whole time I was around.  
I listened to the Rolling Stones and Pink Floyd, and even though the Rolling  
Stones had a disco hit ("Miss You"), most of the disco that I heard -- on the 
 radio, as I was not going to clubs -- was the very commercial variety (Bee 
Gees,  "Disco Duck," and worse) and sounded pretty awful to someone who loved 
music. If  I'd been in New York, going to the clubs Apollo frequented, I 
probably would  have had quite a different impression. 
 
I remember reading about that anti-disco stunt at the ballpark. I couldn't  
stand most of the disco records, but even then I could see that the furor was  
anti-gay in a fascistic pseudo-"populist" way that paved the way for  
hate-mongers like today's Rush Limbaugh and Michael Savage. (Soon after, disco  
bashing would give way to Iran bashing and Sammy Hagar extorting fans to  
collectively hate Ayatollah Khomeini. Later, of course, Iran became our "friend"  
because they were enemies with Iraq.) 
 
When I started going out clubbing (1982), Disco was still around but was  
losing steam. Donna Summer was still a staple at the I-Beam (big Haight St  
club), and her "Last Dance" was indeed the last song played at many clubs each  
night.  Motown music, updated, continued to be popular.  
 
However, I was a wallflower, and I missed out on the Age of Sexual Excess  
simply because I was too shy to get any dates. It took a while to get past that. 
 
I've saved Apollo's post on my computer because I want to be reminded of  the 
days just before I got into dance music.   Thanks  again!

:)
John

Ive heard TONS of shit talking about this party... one of the things said is that the sneaker pimps WILL NOT be their. I would go to this to see them, but @ the price tag, im to worried that they wont show up because of so many people saying bad things about this party...... anyone know if any of these things true?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Boat Parties: Where R They?

They don't happen as often since the one incident where a drunk bitch tossed
another guy overboard. Guy ended up dying from that incident and now you
have all the boat charters freaked out over another incident occuring. I
know that had a huge impact on RedMelon boat parties and a lot to do with
why they don't happen now. Pacific Sound (www.pacificsound.net) does still
do Sunset boat parties. They just had one on 4th of July weekend. Beyond
that the people the run Anu in SF (celtic something) throw boat parties
every now and then. Last year they brought out Hybrid.

The party you listed here looks booty ass trashy to me...

Subject: Re: [sfraves] (((Utopia)))  This Saturday!!  <bsp>

FYI - The Sneaker Pimps that you probably know and love are a completely
different group these days. They're *nothing* like what you heard on
Becoming X. The girl that was singing has since left the group and the last
cd was more alt-rock in sound with all male vocals. If you go there looking
for the Sneaker Pimps of 1997 you won't find them...

They don't happen as often since the one incident where a drunk bitch tossed
another guy overboard. Guy ended up dying from that incident and now you
have all the boat charters freaked out over another incident occuring. I
know that had a huge impact on RedMelon boat parties and a lot to do with
why they don't happen now. Pacific Sound (www.pacificsound.net) does still
do Sunset boat parties. They just had one on 4th of July weekend. Beyond
that the people the run Anu in SF (celtic something) throw boat parties
every now and then. Last year they brought out Hybrid.

The party you listed here looks booty ass trashy to me...

fyi, red melon didn't go bye-bye, it just became harder to
throw boat parties.  they still throw parties, i think their
latest spot is "mighty" on utah.

i seem to remember two separate incidences of people being
tossed (or jumping) overboard.  one was a doc martin boat party
where someone went overboard, and someone else went after
him/her.  both died.  the other was the RM party.

RedMelon is very much around like Michael said. The boat parties are not.
That incident really screwed them over with the Red and White Fleet. They
now just do parties at Mighty and other spots (went to one at Suede).

Daft Punk and Sneaker Pimps will be no-shows for the Utopia party. It's
all over bayraves and the justsayagency web site:

http://www.justsayagency.com/roster.php

Look for links to Sneaker Pimps & Thomas Bangalter(Daft Punk)

Unrelated, but I hear there's an Organic anniversary & Ibiza reopening
that night?

>one of the things said is that the sneaker pimps WILL NOT be their

Sneaker Pimps will be there, but who cares?  They won't be doing a live preformance, just spinnin.  I think the promoters could have done better to not hype up the DaftPunk/Sneaker Pimps thing... cuz now thats all anyone's talking about, and it's taking all the focus from what really seems to be a great party.

The whole deal with Thomas Bangalter is someone claiming to be him managed to get booked to the On and On tour through Virgin music and Jesse Saunders production company.  They billed the tour with Daft Punk everywhere, something like 35 or 40 US locations plus international dates (England, France, Costa Rica, Brazil, etc.)  Of course, the real Thomas Bangalter heard about this and that's when the fiasco started... unfortunate really cuz it doesn't seem to be anyone involved with the tours fault.  check out this site for the whole story: http://www.justsayagency.com/artistpage.php?aid=78

Even with all that drama, the lineup honestly looks like one of the best I've seen in a very long while.  If you've never seen any of these people I think that it would be well worth your 25 bux to check it out. (I am!)  Jesse Saunders and Bryan Cox are nothing short of amazing!  I saw both of em at a show in Manchester a few years back.  I've never seen the rest of the headliners except for Angel Alonis (who is also way sick) but I'm familiar with most of their music some of it's great and some I'm not a huge fan of but it definetly isn't the same old bullshit trax that every DJ has.  Ya got the founders of House music and NRG there for jeeps sake. 

All the best local talent will be there too (except Denise which is a let down)

I went to one other party thrown by organicvibe (w/ infected mushroom, don't remember the name) and it was pretty sweet, the only let down was that it seemed like it wasn't promoted well or something cuz the space never really filled up.  Friends that have been to more of their parties say the crew is consistantly good with their events.

sorry so long -- really hope to see you guys there.

hello, it is time for us to pause now from our
fictional piece just  because, we feel like making a
statement. a statement that means something. a
statement that lets us all know that there is truth,
and the truth is in the pudding as they say.  if you
are without pudding, do not despair. there will be
more later, and if you are without truth, don't worry,
at some point, you might actually stop lying. :)

Not to disrespect anybody ... maybe these people are playing clubs all the  
time and I never see them since i go to raves and not clubs ... but are people  
familiar with any of these "Bay Area's Finest" DJs?  
 
I might have seen Fuze before but maybe i'm just thinking of the  drink  ;)  
I know i've met a raver named "Happy" but i don't think  he's a DJ (I'd like 
to see a 3x6 set with Grumpy and Bashful)

Daft Punk and Sneaker Pimps will be no-shows for the Utopia party. It's
all over bayraves and the justsayagency web site:

http://www.justsayagency.com/roster.php

Look for links to Sneaker Pimps & Thomas Bangalter(Daft Punk)

Unrelated, but I hear there's an Organic anniversary & Ibiza reopening
that night?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] HEY DJ: FUCK YOU!!!

That was too funny.

I want to take this chance to share one of my pet peeves.....

Often when I meet DJs, I ask them what they play. There are 2 answers
I dread the most: "everything" and "house".


Everything:

I absolutely hate it when DJs say they play "everything". Do they just
want to brag about how diverse they are? Or just can't make up their
mind about what they play? There's only one type of DJs that play
"everything" -- wedding DJs. If you don't really have a specific style
you play most, you're either the kind of DJ who always play something
because it's popular at the moment, or your sets are just
incomprehandsibly incoherent.

You gotta have a style (or 2, or 3) you play most. Why not just say
it? No-one's trying to typecast you. There's no shame in what you
play, right?

House:

I hate it when DJs say they play house. Not that I don't like house,
but there are about 23 types of house: NY vocal house, west coast
loungy house, banging chicago house, funky disco house, techy tribal
house, deep dark progressive house..... A DJ saying he/she plays house
is like a guiatrist saying he/she plays rock. It means ABSOLUTELY
NOTHING.

I asked you what you play right? Then please take your time to
elaborate. If I care enough to ask, I probably care enough to know,
and know enough to understand.


Pz y'all,

- Jeff

Oh yeah, another thing. I always find it kinda amusing that
wedding/party DJs can just call themselves  __DJs__ with a str8 face,
like they were real DJs. They never volunteer the "wedding" part.  Is
it like strippers calling themselves dancers?

But then, there are turntablists who thinks DJs who can't scratch are
just cueing records.

Personally, I prefer to say that "I play records". Kinda like "I play
guitar" or "I play piano". It implies that I'm doing something musical
with records, rather than just cueing and beatmatching.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] HEY DJ: FUCK YOU!!!

I must have struck one of your nerves or something.  LOL

I did mention that no-one is trying to typecast anybody. I most
certainly do not expect DJs to limit themselves. Everybody plays a
little bit of everything, but there's always a ballpark or 2 a DJs
stay in. What I was saying is, a lot of DJs tend to just say
"everything" instead of identifying those ballparks. And it's a real
drag cuz I'm trying really hard to make some conversation with some DJ
I just met.  :)

About subgenres... I totally forgot how some people hate subgenres. It
wouldn't be so bad if ppl don't just pull new subgenres out of their
asses every other week.

Anyways, it's not so much about subgenres, but elements. As many
different styles you play, I'm sure that you tend to look for certain
elements or moods.

Every DJ plays a lot of different things, but rarely literally
EVERYTHING. It's all these different, specific things a DJ plays that
shape his/her sound. I hinestly don't think it's so unreasonable to
expect a DJ (who's not trying to blow me off) to summarize his/her
sound in a few words, rather than just a simple "everything".

It's like....

"Hey, what do u play?"

   "everything"

"Where do u play?"

   "everywhere"

"Well, um... nice meeting ya then."

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Engaged - Are U?

Kelly's kicks much ass.. right there next to PacBell park on the 
waterfront.. it juts out onto the water and every floor has views of the 
bay.. outdoor access to the balconies.. and two floors for DJ's and bars all 
over the place.  I highly recommend this venue for the chic seen-n-b-seen 
type parties.. which I am sure this will be.  Bring your best sunglasses and 
summer party gear.. it sould be a booty shakin good time for all.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] HEY DJ: FUCK YOU!!!

Beyond hating subgenres too many people out there don't even know that the
subgenres *exist* So if you say *I play chicago house* you might get a *oh
you play house* er yeah sure kid... It's really just easier to say you play
house at first and if the person has a brain they'll ask *what kind?* =)

When people say they play everything I immediately ask *what's everything?*
then they usually rattle off a few genres. That's when you pop out the
*which do you play primarily?* and you get an answer and all is well and
good. I see the non-specific answers as the lazy answers which work for a
lot of lazy people that go to clubs and parties and don't shit about the
music anyway.

No nerves struck in me! I just thought that you ought to see why a person 
such as myself might answer your questions in such a vague manner. See, to 
nail down an answer in a few simple comments is not always so easy. Perhaps 
you ought to probe a bit more in depth - especially if you're striking up a 
conversation with somebody, lol.

Ahhhahahahahaha narc.

Go chug a bottle of Robotussin Max strength. It's one of the strongest psy 
drugs available and it's legal. Problem is, 1 out of every 3 people 
doesn't have the correct stomache enzyme to break it down and they end up 
having really crappy trips. So it's only for the elite. Oh and don't mix 
with MDMA since it's the complete opposite (outer vs. inner).

MDMA takes you deep inside yourself
DXM takes you deep outside.

Oh and I don't do drugs, just know a lot about them.

I assure you that I can, indeed, drink like a 36 year old. As for not
looking it, yeah, I seem to get the "your how old?!?!" thing all the
time, so I guess I don't look my age, but we'll see how that fairs by
the end of the weekend. 

Bring it on!

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Spirit of Raving: Q1: Best experience @ an Event...

Being at the first "Orgy" event at 550 back in 2000 and having the "red
room" transform into a feeling of togetherness and love I had ever felt
before (even though most people were complete strangers) while the music
instantly took on another meaning then what can be described in words. I
could feel the music roll up my spine and out through my chest. I could
feel each and every hair on my head, every beat of the house drum, the
smile on some strangers face, the way that girl in the corner was
outstreached on the couch, arching her back, rubbing up against me, and
instantly in that moment I understood what it was all about. What life
was all about. What love was all about. What I had been hiding from
myself. The person I now knew I could be. How that feeling wasn't just a
one moment chemical creation, but a prescription for how to live your
everyday life from that moment on.

Oh and I don't do drugs, just know a lot about them.

Steve,

	This is the kind of post that I used to subscribe to SFRaves for. It's 
nice to still see something once in a while that looks at the rave 
experience from such a positive, idealistic, and child-like 
perspective. Thanks!

Groove on,

1. Ultra 2000 @ 21st St Beach (WMC 2000)

The very last Ultra on the beach (and my first). I hate massives (all
u ppl in SoCal I feel your pain), but there was something REALLY
SPECIAL about this event. The amount of enthuiasm was unbelievable.
Everybody knew EXACTLY who's the DJ that's playing -- these weren't
just your typical e-tards who go to parties for an excuse to get high,
they came from all over the country because they care about their
music, and they're serious about their music. They got so excited
everytime another DJ came on because u knew they've waited years to
see each and one of them (I know I did). I've never felt that kind of
excitement and togetherness since Back-In-Da-Day(TM), and most
certainly not in this scale (30,000 ppl).

It was the first time I exprienced the scene in a national/global
scale. I met ppl from all over the country and the world, and got a
slice of what the scene is like in their hometown. For the first the I
saw how far the scene had spread, how we're all connected, and how
much it motivated us. To me,  that event wasn't just a regular party,
it was purely a celebration of EDM itself.

I was rolling my bawls off (sorry guys), completely shirtless (I NEVER
take my shirt off in public, much less @ a party), dancing with a
complete random guy so closed together we might as well be making out
(and I absolutely hate dancing with guys in such close proximity @
clubs/parties). The sun was setting, reflecting off the beautiful
Altantic, while some 40 DJs I've wanted to see in YEARS played one
after another....  It was soooo beautiful... and I was soooo fucking
high..... It was liberating.

I was surrounded by 30,000 ppl who actually cared about our music. It
was the event that inspired me to start playing records. I decided I
shouldn't care if I never gonna get any good, I'm gonna do it just
because I love it. It's the first time I felt identified with the
scene (and I've been partying for years), that I realized my life and
this music is inseparable. I live and eat and breathe this shit and I
should just get over it and accept that this is where I belong. It was
almost like coming out of the closet.

-----------------

2. Sunrise on New Year's Eve 1999 @ Miami Beach (not a party)

I was completely sober all nite (thank u very much). After a night of
clubbing I rounded up about 20 strangers in my apt for afterhours. My
friends were rolling bawls but I was pretty much just socializing and
babysitting (had to deal with a case of serotonin syndrome for the
first time in my life). @ 6am or so a few of us decided to go down to
the beach, turned out thousands of ppl had the same idea. There were
so many ppl on the beach it was like a saturday afternoon. As the sun
began to rise above the horizon over the Atlantic, thousands of ppl
clapped and cheered "HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!"

Feeling the same excitement with our ppl is one thing, feeling it with
the general population is another. Bear in mind that all these ppl on
the beach are just regular ppl -- thousands of them, coming out to the
beach in the middle of the night, probably still drunk. It's just so
strangely beautiful that all these ppl (including myself) just
spontaneously came to the beach, and spontaneously we cheered, as the
new millienium begins (OK technically the millenium begins in 2001 but
what did we care then?)

It wasn't an event, it wasn't a party, it wasn't planned by anyone, it
just HAPPENED. It's a moment that I'll never forget in my life.

It was also symbolic to all the spontaneous afterhours adventures I
had in Miami, all the strangers I met and became best friends for one
nite, and I never quite knew how the evening/morning will end. This
one, however, is the most surprising and spectacular of them all.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Spirit of Raving: Q1: Best experience @ an Event...

Same...

One of many great experiences was the first party I
went to. 

I never liked the bar scene or drinking. I ran around
with a 2 foot mowhawk; pitting at punk shows and punk
rallies was my thing. 70's-80's. The punk thing got to
main stream for me and I hung low for a while. Cut my
hawk. Hiked around and rode my bike. Got back into
other things. One day my roomies asked me to go to a
rally in Sacramento on the capital step for a
demonstration, there were decks set up and DJ's
spinning. The music was called techno. I have old
records from back in the day and the funny thing is
that some techo sounded like house, some sounded like
drum and bass, some sounded like trace, breaks, acid
house, but back then it was called techno. As far as I
knew anyway.

After the demonstration my roomies said there was a
break-in warehouse party. Whatever the hell that
means. What is there to do in a warehouse? My
curiosity was peaked. I was into anything new and
different than the proposed norm. 

At this point in my life the only experience with
drugs was knowing that my hippy parents did so many
that I was turned off to the idea. You never want to
be like your parents right? When I was a tike mom told
me that if I ever wanted to try anything ever she
would get a hold of it and we could do it together.
"I've tried it all" she said. Boy that sounds like
fun. I had a few drinks over the years but didn't like
to drink. Clove and menthol cigs was all, what was I
thinking... Smoked reef a couple times but wasn't into
it back then.  

So we go to some dark ass ally in some sketch
neighborhood just outside of downtown sac. I start to
hear this low thump, thump, thump, thump, thump,
thump... We drive past, find a place to park. Walk up
to the warehouse, no line, no fee, no one even
watching the door. Walk through a tunnel of black
sheets and BAM sweat all over the place. Wicked music,
people dancing, some half naked. The back door of the
warehouse was open and a cool breeze was cooling off
the dance floor which was the entire warehouse. The
only lights were a strobe and a black light, oh yeh
and a smoke machine. No alcohol. I loved it. People
getting on dancing, having a great time and there was
no booze.   
Wicked energy, I started dancing. Felt like I was out
of my body. The night went on, sweating, dancing,
hands in the air. I didn't care about time, the night
could have gone on forever and I wouldn't have
noticed. After a while I thought it would be good to
find my roomies. I had my shirt off from dancing, the
warehouse was like a sauna. I found my roomies. We
started chatting. Both my roomies have been to parties
before so we we talked about how great it was. A
beautiful girl/woman came up to me. She had this thing
in her hand that looked like saturn. A metal ball with
rings around it. She told me to put my hand on top of
the ball, her hand was on the button holding this
contraption. I put my hand on the orb, she ran her
finger from my sweaty chest down to my belt line then
back up around my neck, leaned in and kissed me. The
orb created an electric link to whatever part of our
bodies touched and causes a little muscle spasm that
felt like a tiny euphoric massage. My whole face lit
up. I was in ecstasy. She walked away. The night
finally came to an end. We went home. The beutiful
thing was, I never saw the girl again. There was no
reason to exchange information because we were both
sharing a moment that was only appropriate for that
time in space. I did not do drugs and didn't need any.
The music, people, energy and visuals kept me high. I
WAS HOOKED. 

This community for me has always been part of a life
that proceeds the normal. We are one step ahead. We
think ahead. We act ahead. We love each other. We
create our beautiful surroundings. We know what is
right and wrong without authority.

this is just way to good to pass up. i can't actually remember anything about any parties, because there is something wrong with my brain, plus, i don't think i really go to parties anyway. it's a guy thing. please forgive the jest if found. ;)

"I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes 
me to tremble for the safety of my country.  As a result of the war, 
corporations have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places 
will follow, and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong 
its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth is 
aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed."
-Abraham Lincoln

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

  "I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of 
life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the 
beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club, 
party or other sound system that has ever achieved anything close to that..."
-Jeno, on the early days of Wicked and the Full Moon Raves

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Wild 94.9 Freestyle Explosion (for Osby and others)


OK here we go VERY embrassing confession by Yours truly!!

I use to rock every single track way back in the day on that list with the 
exception of the two groups near the end never heard of them. But yo why 
aint they repping the 408 with the Spanish fly boys, Orig (which my friends 
brother was the lead singer) and the second edition crew???

They should have mixed in some of the "Hip-House" sound as well.. ya'll know 
what im talking about those old enough to remember way back then.. Let me 
paint you a lil picture of the hip house sound. Cross Color Jeans, Pants 
possible worn backwards,Afro-centric gear (I.E carribean and african flag 
colors,African Medallions etc) and for the music you had DJ Lee "Get busy" 
Kwami (Forget his songs??) DJ Fast Eddie"yo,yo get funky", Cut it up Def 
records.. You had DJ Cameron Paul the first Producer the I had been exposed 
to that could sample like a mutha fucka..

awww memories of my youth in the late eighties/early 90's

PS: Funny thing is I still hear people playing those jams as if they were 
new and it was the thing to do.. It's like HELLO that track came out in like 
1987!!! How un-progressive is that!!  =D

Subject: RE: [sfraves] You know your old when...

My brother happens to be the Dean of Vallejo High.  Hence, my brother is
the Dean of my old high school & knows their kids (as well as them).

Not much of mystery there.

The world is too small...

And btw - it's been nearly 2 decades, not one.

Subject: [sfraves] SODA tomorrow night (Sat 7.17)

Thought some of y'all might be interested... don't forget to catch Hector
with Doc Martin tonight @ Club Six!


SODA

featuring special guest Hector Moralez (Robsoul)
plus residents The Fresh Blend (IRIS, Trouble)
and Philip Sherburne (flavorpill, Trouble)

Tomorrow Soda goes acid with Hector Moralez. Hector is one of the mainstays
of Paris' Robsoul Recordings label, home of the hottest acid house in a
decade, and as Fries & Bridges, his duo with Robsoul founder Phil Weeks,
Hector has recorded for labels like Music for Freaks, Primal, and Brique
Rouge. Expect some seriously minimal temptation (as his new track with Chris
Carrier is titled -- hear it at http://www.robsoulrecordings.com/rb24.html)
and maximal squelch.

SODA residents The Fresh Blend and Philip Sherburne keep it locked, loaded
and lubed with a couple of crates full of the finest minimal techno,
microhouse, and electro-techno you'll hear in the Bay Area. If you're a fan
of labels like Ghostly, Kompakt, Perlon, Playhouse, and Output, you won't
want to miss it.

Saturday, July 17
Rx Gallery (132 Eddy St @ Mason)
9pm-2am

I'd rather deal with an "everything" deejay than the ones who make up 
their own genres on the spot, "I play progressive hard trip turntablist 
West Coast trance hop." If I can't tell when someone is being 
pretentious or a goofball, that's never good.

Hey Eurocheese is a very respectable genre. If it weren't for
Eurocheese, many teenage boys and girls would not have been
pre-exposed to EDM at pre-teen and be well-prepared for the smorgabord
of genres that awaits them later in life.

I hope Eurocheese today will do for teeny-boppers everywhere exactly
what 2-Unlimited did for me Back-In-Da-Day (TM).

Eurocheese rulez.

Hmmmmm......

I prayed many moons for an event that will bring the DJs of the world
to the west coast much like WMC does for the east.

Frankly WMC sucks big cocks nowadays.....

It's just getting more $$$ and flashy every year and the vibe is
getting thinner. But it still worth going. I personally would aviod
all the big parties and do the afternoon pool parties and smaller
sideshows (where it's more intimate and u get to hang out and talk
with the DJs and promoters).

But what I'm saying is, the big parties @ WMC used to be pheonominally good=
.

FYI, cocksucking is conviniently available @ Flamingo Park all year
around. Tell them "goofrider hooked u up" and u get a 20% off coupon
for your next visit.

I'll be on from 12:15am to 2am sporting the hard techno goodness (madman 
mixing included), but I'd also like to drop a note mentioning that I'll 
have several copies of EGR-01 (Xenos EP), the first release on my label, 
available for $5 at the event.   Distro has been rough so far, so I 
appreciate anyone who wants to pick up a copy from a friendly local hard 
techno label.  :)

Last time I checked copies were available at Open Mind Music and BPM 
Records in SF.

Label web site here:
http://egr.egregious.net/

Best,

You're entitled to your opinion, but as I recall this year kicked some
serious ass. The only thing that sucked was that there were too many
great things to do at any one time (day or night). It was only my first
year, but most of the veterans I spoke with said it was the best time
they'd had down there in a while.

I'm definitely going back next year. If it affords me the opportunity to
see Richie Hawtin, Derrick Carter, Matthew Dear, Luomo, Michael Mayer,
Telefon Tel Aviv, Mr. Scruff, Smith & Selway, Phil Kieran, Mistress
Barbara, Asad Rizvi, Mazi, Tyler Stadius, and too many other incredible
DJs and artists to name, *and* I get to bond with friends and meet new
people... I'd say it's worth having to hang out in South Beach with a
bunch of assholes for a weekend.

So did you go, or are you just talking out of your ass?

Toodles,

Subject: Re: [sfraves] WMC suckage

I went 2000-2002 (3 yrs). I had a HORRIBLE time in 2002 though
(relative to previous years).

The consensus I got from my friends who went this year (or friends who
live there) is that it's somewhat better than 2003, but still not as
good as a few years back. Enthuaism is steadily declining and replaced
with commercialism. For someone who hasn't been to WMC, by all means
go. But I just don't feel like I have to go every year now. The bigger
parties is getting outrageously expensive ($60 each club, if you try
to hit 3 big clubs in one night that's almost $200 a night, not
counting waiting in line for each), and they're becoming a magnet for
the star-gazed DJ worshipping pimps-&-hos e-tards, which makes it as
aggravating to attend as 1015 or Ruby Skye. But if I disregard the big
parties (and most of them should be avoided anyways) and just consider
the smaller parties and afternoon pool parties, WMC is full of
suprises and lots of new msuic that hasn't been played anywhere else,
and you can indeed have a fabulous time still.

BTW, the assholes in SoBe u spoke of, there weren't as many of them in
previous years. 2000 was all love for me, I can only imagine how nice
1998/1999 was.

I'd be the last guy who hang on to the good ol' days like Britney
holding onto her allerged cherry. I know things gets commercialized
and exploited all the time. The unfortunate thing is that Miami is
particular known to be a place for selling out. So I'm not very
optimistic about the viability of WMC in the long term. A west coast
alternative is very attractive, not only that it's much closer for
most of us, having something similiar in SF probably won't get
exploited as rapidly as in Miami.

So I take it back. WMC doesn't quite suck. It'll probly suck if you
follow the herd to all the big parties and try to catch all the big
names, but if you're looking to sit by the pool all afternoon and kick
it and have a drink with all your fellow DJs for an entire week,
you'll be in heaven.

WMC is still a unique exprience, there's no other time or place in US
where u see thousands of DJs hanging out on the street, and running
into famous DJs at every bar and resturant and get to say hi and chat
with them like u'r old friends.

But don;t say I didn't warn u, that novelty wears of after your 2nd or
3rd year.  :)

So, go again. Enjoy it. Who cares what I said?  :)  

Love, 

- Jeff

Subject: Re: [sfraves] WMC suckage

The last few years I've gone to WMC it's been a great time.  So it's changed
since it started (everything does), and gotten bigger...there are great
parties all over the place, great DJs, and a lot of energy everywhere.  You
have everything from a super massive event to major club one offs to tight
little underground communities getting together on an outdoor patio with
good beats.  Sure there's plenty of South Beach cheese, but guess what?
It's South Beach.  If you can't figure out how to have a good time and find
what you want out there, well you're jaded beyond repair...

I heard more great music out there in one week than in all the months since
I got back.  And there's no vibe like 200 heads into exactly the music you
are that are all djs/producers/promoters that know what up, and someone is
jacking it behind the decks, and EVERYBODY appreciates to the fullest
because they know inside and out what it takes to be that good...

Subject: RE: [sfraves] dj dragn'fly - who???

who is this dj dragn'fly you guys keep talking about?  she sounds all old 
and stuff.  does she play that boom boom boom music that like all the cool 
kids are listening to nowadays?  cause, like wow, that's kinda cool stuff.

i like techno when i swing my glowsticks around my head.  i haven't figured 
out how to dance to it yet, but yeah, i'm totally like a raver and stuff.

i guess i'll check out this dragn'fly person sometime.  she sounds cool.

HAHAHAHAHA ROBO-TRIPPIN...now that takes me back to the good ol days.  I
remember seeing a little blurd about Robo-trippin in the news not too =
long
ago, maybe like 3 months or so.  They were hyping it all up that all =
these
kids in High school and such we're getting "high" on Robo and made this =
huge
deal out of it like it was something new.  I couldn't help but laugh,
honestly these days who hasn't heard of robo-trippin.  That's what Jr. =
high
was for, the OTC's BABY.  Before you could buy real drugs, it was easy =
to
just raid the medicine cabinet at home.  Chug a bottle of Robo....or eat =
a
handful of dramamine or benedryl (my personal favs at the time, cant =
stand
em anymore).  Sure it's hell on your liver, but isn't that why we do =
drugs
anyway? =20

OTC's ARE GRATE!!!!  When you're a kid.

Subject: [sfraves] (NRR) There are 14 candidates running for president of the United States, not 2

--Apple-Mail-4-219890065
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Type: text/plain;
	delsp=yes;
	charset=US-ASCII;
	format=flowed

	According to most mainstream media outlets, there are only two  
candidates running for U.S. president this year -- George Bush and John  
Kerry. If you're lucky, they might tell you that Ralph Nader is also  
running (often incorrectly describing him as the Green Party's  
candidate), and if you're even luckier, they may acknowledge that  
Michael Badnarik, David Cobb and Michael Peroutka are running too.

	Beyond that, there is a virtual media blackout. But in fact there are  
not 2, 3, 4, or 6, but 14 candidates running for president of the  
United States this year! (See list below.) Unfortunately you will not  
see most of them on your ballot because of the restrictive ballot  
access laws that have been established by Democrats and Republicans.  
However Michael Badnarik, David Cobb, Ralph Nader and Michael Peroutka  
are all expected to be on a sufficient number of state ballots that if  
enough people voted for them, they could win a majority of votes in the  
Electoral College and become president.

	Of course with this media blackout, and the resulting low poll numbers  
that give the established parties an excuse to keep them out of the  
major presidential debates, they hardly stand a chance. That's not the  
way elections should be held in a free country. Voters deserve to know  
who all the candidates are, and to have the opportunity to hear their  
ideas and decide for themselves who would make the best president.

	We wouldn't like it if we only had two choices of where to work, what  
kind of car to buy, where to go to school, or what to do this weekend.  
So why, when it comes to something as important as electing a  
president, do we accept the media telling us the news as if there were  
only two people we should consider voting for?

	Let's demand that at least the 6 candidates theoretically able to win  
the election -- Badnarik, Bush, Cobb, Kerry, Nader and Peroutka -- be  
given equal media coverage and allowed into the televised presidential  
debates.

	Please take a few moments to write a letter to the editor (choose your  
own paper, or write the San Francisco Chronicle at  
letters@sfchronicle.com). I would ask you to write to the Commission on  
Presidential Debates, but they are fully aware that people are upset  
about this and so they make it difficult for even the media to get in  
touch with them, let alone the general public! (See  
http://www.debates.org/mediacenter/index.html.)

	Come September, if Bush and Kerry's cronies are still shutting the  
other candidates out, please join a protest at the debate location  
nearest you:

First presidential debate:
Thursday, September 30
University of Miami
Coral Gables, FL

Vice presidential debate:
Tuesday, October 5
Case Western Reserve University
Cleveland, OH

Second presidential debate:
Friday, October 8
Washington University
St. Louis, MO

Third presidential debate:
Wednesday, October 13
Arizona State University
Tempe, AZ

	If you care about democracy and freedom in the United States, please  
forward this email to your friends and to other lists. Finally, be sure  
to sign these petition for fair and open debates:

 From a news story in 2000 -- the protests should be much bigger and  
louder this time around!

Protesters demand open presidential debates
October  2, 2000
Web posted at:  9:22 AM EDT (1322 GMT)

ATLANTA (CNN) -- Chanting and waving signs, a group of about 100  
demonstrators marched in front of CNN Center Sunday, calling on the  
network to host open debates among several third-party presidential  
candidates. "You can get public money to help your campaign, but you  
can't get access  to the public airwaves in a debate," shouted a  
Libertarian Party supporter through a megaphone.

The protesters represented the Green Party, the Natural Law Party, the   
Reform Party and the International Socialist Organization, among other  
groups.  One member of the ISO said demonstrators had collected 85,000  
signatures on a  petition they hoped to deliver to CNN...

OK I missed a lot of this because gmail filed it as one thing, I had
no idea it was still going, etc., anyway, two things.

first is that once upon a time I actually auditioned for a job as a
strip club DJ. I don't know if audition is really the word, though. it
was the second time I'd ever been in a strip club in my life. it was a
club in the middle of nowhere, the DJ's job was to play whatever CD
the stripper handed him and do a spiel in between about how the guys
in the club should give the girls lots of money. it was basically the
same thing as the weddings/corporate events/bar mitzvahs thing (bad),
except with lots of naked ladies (good -- well, mostly good, anyway)
and a really weird kind of low-rent backcountry scumbag vibe (very
bad).

anyway. that was quite an experience. I didn't so much as audition as
show up and sit around for a while enjoying the free beer and chatting
with the strippers. but the beer was American and the strippers were a
mixed bunch. there were snowboarders, and there were hoes. that's
basically what it came down to, actually, snowboaders and hoes. some
were cool and some were lame. some were hot and some were dooky. but a
job that consisted of nothing more than going "look at those
bazongas!" and playing Kid Rock didn't really appeal to me.

anyway the second thing is that I think assuming that other people
will load the term "DJ" with the same extended meanings that ravers,
promoters, producers, designers, dancers, and DJs will is a bit like
expecting everybody you meet to speak Azerbaijani or something. DJs
are artists in this world, but we have a special world, and not
everybody outside it even knows that it exists.

I know this is a contentious subject and props to any and all who are
taking a stand for their political beliefs, but for the love of God,
vote Kerry! The two-party system **IS** undemocratic, fascist, evil,
and all the rest of it, but it's a lot **LESS** undemocratic, fascist,
and evil than the Republican Party. if we don't get those fuckers out
of the White House there's gonna be hella riots in 2005.

	OK, let me ask you a couple questions...

	Did you vote for an alternative party in the last election? And how do  
you plan to vote for Congress, State Assembly, etc., in the upcoming  
election?

	If you've voted for alternative candidates in the past, or if you plan  
to vote Libertarian, Green, or what-not on the rest of your ballot  
outside of the presidential race this November, that gives your words  
below some real weight.

	But if you have regularly voted for Democrats in the past, and plan to  
keep doing so in the future, then let's not pretend like it's such a  
huge deal that people vote for Kerry this time around when your actions  
(which speak louder than words) are saying this election is just like  
every other election.

Peace, love & liberty,

P.S. - The bold, italicized and otherwise altered text didn't come  
through in my original email, resulting in part of what I quoted from  
the website listing the candidates not making much sense. Here is a  
revised version of my letter in which I also dropped the former  
candidates from the list, since it just makes the email longer and  
confuses people, and made a couple other minor corrections.

Meat hook dangling craze mystifies

Sunday, July 18, 2004 Posted: 6:54 PM EDT (2254 GMT)

MIAMI, Florida (Reuters) -- Law enforcement officials in the
Florida Keys are mystified by a bizarre new pastime -- young
people dangling themselves from meat hooks on a popular sandbar.

A U.S. Coast Guard spokeswoman said on Sunday that the Monroe
County sheriff's office and Coast Guard were called on July 12
to the sandbar off Whale Harbor in Islamorada where locals say
wild behavior is becoming a tradition.

They found that five young people had erected a bamboo tripod
and hung meat hooks from it. A young woman, her feet brushing
the surface of the shallow water, dangled from the frame, hooks
embedded firmly in her shoulders.

According to a Coast Guard video, she did not seem to mind the hooks.

Lt. Tom Brazil of the Coast Guard told the Key West Citizen
newspaper that a young man, who also had hooks embedded in his
heavily pierced and tattooed skin, assured him the group was
"just enjoying the afternoon."

A Coast Guard spokeswoman in Miami said the group had clearly
done this before and intended to post photos of themselves on
a Web site dedicated to "body modification" -- the ritualistic
piercing of the body.

"It looked like a daily routine for them," she said, adding
that the hooks had been inserted in the skin in a professional
manner and had drawn very little blood."

"As long as they weren't creating any kind of ruckus or riot
within a crowd they really weren't breaking any laws."

The Coast Guard passed the video on to federal justice authorities but no 
further action will be taken.

I doubt this is an original idea, but we should all vote for a write-in
candidate.

I'm hoping that your comment about riots being "fun"
was a joke.  

Riots generally do the most harm to individual small
business owners and communities who have nothing to do
with the issue at hand, and historically they damage
poor urban communities the most.  Wealthy real estate
investors in San Francisco would like nothing better
than to have riots drive more poor and middle class
families from the city.

Riots have little real impact on the issues that
trigger them.  The riots after the Rodney King trial
did nothing (IMO) to end racism of police brutality. 
Riots in San Francisco won't change the outcome of a
presidential election.

The truth is that an angry mob is still an angry mob
even if they are angry about racism, war and poverty. 
And nothing good ever comes from anger.  Please
consider this before going out and burning police cars
or whatever...

Regards,

Peter

I'm guessing he's talking on a larger scale.  Possibly similar to that
which spawned thr birth of the U.S. (and freed us from the tyranny of
the British crown.)  That probably wouldn't benefit the folks in charge
too much.

Well, I'll jump in and say that I voted for Nader in 2k, but I'm sure as
hell not voting for him this time around.  This presidential term is too
important to leave to Gee Dubya.  As for the rest of the slate, I
generally voted green or democrat (I personally feel the democratic
party is out of touch, as demonstrated by the big guns they brought out
to SF to fight Gonzalez) and I specifically feel Feinstein (wish I could
remember some of the insider dirt I've been told about her) is an
example of someone who's out of touch with their constituents.  (She's
ranked 29th out of 100 at http://www.progressivepunch.org).  It's time
we jetison her for something better.

Subject: [sfraves] looking for techno in SF...

hello!  so i escaped from the states for a while and
got my ass to detroit and sonar and had an
awesometime, and now i'm back in the bay and i need a
maintenance dose of techno - badly.  i haven't been on
this list in a while so i'm a little behind on what's
going on these days, but if there's any regular
minimal techno, or dare
i say it, detroit techno or kompakt style stuff going
on please please pass the word.  i've got to get out
more often.  oh, and is anyone playing booty house or
ghetto tech around here these days?

Sonar was fucking awesome, by the way.  well worth
going, if you can make the trip to barcelona.  it was
my first time, and if i can manage it, i'll be going
back.  (well, it helps that i'm in love w/ barcelona
as well.)  

take care, and thanks for any advice,
monikat

I did wanna stay there 4 some of the Jungle Groovy, but I didn't have $10, but I did want them 2 know they had atleast a portion of my support of the night.. so it was good seein' a few Jungle Homies!

Then I walked over 2 Mr Wham Bam's pad & we kicked it 4 a few... I mean seriously.. when Bam & I get 2gether.. there's alwaaaays somethig 2 talk about w/ him & it's Groovy!!  YAY!!

Finally got 2 my actual set Destination 4 the night.. Hooger Mooger.. OK.. Hello 2Day.. it was soooooooo much fuckin' fun!!!  LoL

Andy busted like these 80 remix tracks... ummmmm... the only 1 that comes 2 my mind right now is "Sunglasses @ Night",, but there was like 2 more I think.. LoL.. all in all, it was fun!  There was some 4x4 bleep bleep bleep bloop kinda songs that were funny well... yeah funny... I mean.. the whole set kinda went all over the Breakbeats genres & I liked it alot!! It was fun 2 dance 2!  I mean.. I totally Love when Andy & Li tag 'cause their sets always depict some sort of mood... well in my opinion anyway.. but Sat night was all about Cheesey fun =)

OK.. but the main reason that i wanted 2 go was 'cause Katharsis was spinning... I mean.. Heeeeeeello 2Day.. I Love this Dude's sets!  So he got there an hour b4 he played.. so we preety much had time 2 catch up...  Awesome!  LoL.. Then when he went on.. he started out really kinda mellow w/ the Techno tunes... got really hard mid set.. ok.. then it sounded like he was playing some fucked up salsa tech house or something 'cause like well.. that what that song sounded like, la la la... LoL.. & these Russian couple were on the dance floor the whole time groovin.. it was fun!!!  I mean.. LoL>.. I totally yelled hella time during this set.. Loved it!!

awww yess good ol' template how could I forget!!! I was a template whore for 
a long while..

Do these labels still exist? speaking of which I was passing by a rock query 
that is by my house sort of near the industrial area of milpitas.. and I 
have always had this sick idea for a party..

Doing a party at a rock query like the said one in question with just the 
DJ's and big ass flood lights but Blue and Green only and maybe a super 
powerful data flash (Strobe light thingie for those non techie light 
persons) playing nothing but banging teckno with the decks setup on 
cinderblocks with maybe a cargo net background ya know that real raw 
industrial feel!!

I wonder if that could be done?  **Thinks about calling up the rock query**

Dream parties!!

I know of only two regular techno events in SF, and they're both on the
third Saturday of every month:

Hugger-Mugger at Lit
<http://tech-on.com/huggermugger.html>

SODA at the Rx Lounge
<http://rxgallery.com/>

Hugger-Mugger is all about the tougher stuff, whereas SODA features
deeper (and yes, Kompakt-style) minimal techno and tech-house.

That would be AndyW. He's a resident at Hugger-Mugger.

And I'll be sending out a BSP later today, but you can catch some of the
deeper minimal techno and house tonight, on my weekly Monday night
broadcast from 6-8pm:

<http://throwdown.com/throwdown/live/in_house_records.asp>

And tomorrow morning I'll be on KZSU playing a more diverse mix of
techno and tech-house on J.C.'s Epiphany of Sound from 9-11am:

<http://kzsulive.stanford.edu/>

Re: techno in SF in general...

I don't get out much, but I blame that squarely on a lack of good techno
events here in the bay area. Regular club events are few and far
between, and what passes for "techno" at most undergrounds is usually
just techy trance or watered-down drum trax. Most of the hard techno is
harsh and undanceable. Detroit techno and electro are completely
underrepresented, and anything from Cologne is, well, verboten.

I may just not be "clued in" to what's going on--and if that's the case,
somebody PLEASE point me in the right direction--but it appears to me
that there's just very little appreciation for good techno in SF. We
export all our good music... take the Context label, for example. You've
got Sutekh, Kit Clayton, and Dave Aju producing mind-blowing shit, yet
they rarely play locally and the label is distributed by Kompakt (a
German uber-label and distro). Almost all of the great techno produced
here in the bay area is released on European labels (Mille Plateaux,
Force Inc., Circus Company, ~scape, etc.), and most of it doesn't reach
local shops (unless you can bear shopping for vinyl at Amoeba).

Sutekh actually DJ'd in SF a couple of weeks back, at the Luna Lounge.
It was a great night, with a really diverse crowd that danced
indiscriminantly to an eclectic mix of glitchy tech-house and quirky
minimal techno. But unless promoters and club owners start taking some
chances with "new" music, we won't have anything like that regularly.

Of course I'm biased, because that's what I'm into. But I'd like to see
a more substantive debate over this issue than "techno sucks"... so does
anyone else have something to add?

publicly available yet (still needs to be remastered), but i'll
get you a copy.

spun techno at a BM benefit last saturday as well.  real
techno, the banging, get-the-shit-out-of-your-ass kind.

i also spin ghettotech.  spun a sunrise "vs." set with konkers
at a renegade beach party last weekend.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] looking for techno in SF...

Well I think of the reasons you don't see tekno in the area that much is 
because the major forces that use to do tekno parties have moved on. Or are 
so Ultra UG and elite that you rarely hear about them. Crews that use to do 
good tekno/music parties. Pro-soy any of you guys remember them?? Ernie 
Deaks.. The man the legend!! the guy that opened my eyes to tekno one night 
VERY long ago at the stevenson alley. Harmony Crew.. Can you say Minor,Minor 
and and old time friend Trent.. Those guys also influenced my views on 
tekno.. at one point in time Trent was one of the best Tekno DJ's in the 
area (IMHO) Friends and Family Well they still do parties but you got to be 
somewhat "Elite" status to be able to attend. And there lineups vary so much 
that you can't really call it a tekno party but they rarely do events 
anymore. Cloud Factory Known for Good tekno, house and a bag of tricks. Then 
you had the all tekno crew of Gateway with the house DJ at the end I believe 
it was always Sean Murray if im not mistaken?

And you have other groups as well that most of the people are still around 
here and there but for the most part. Most of the crews in question I named 
have moved on from doing parties and the younger new skewl kids that are 
doing all the events Didn't even go to parties back then, and if they did it 
wasn't in the bay area so they don't know the "Deaks" the "Trents" of the 
past all they know is "Mars, Mystere, Dyloot, Tom slick" etc..

Now I know most of you techno snobs are going to gasp at this next comment 
but I Never liked the stuff that sutekh and the likes of the others in that 
type of sound produce.. if it is that same minimal glitchy noisy type of 
techno. A person like myself that has "Self diagonosed" ADD finds it to be 
UN-dance floor friendly and boring. Yes I know they push gear past it 
designed limits and are brilliant producers, but there music is still 
boring.. To myself and I would think to most promoters.

Another opinion is that to me people either love or hate techno.. it is one 
of those types of sounds rarely do you get use to it.. I think you like 
techno from the first time you hear it or it sucks.. and unfortunately I 
think for most it is the ladder.. And that could be because of it's hard 
metallic sound or repetative abrassivness I dunno.. but to me those are all 
the reasons why I love it.


But yes boys and girls there was a time in SF when if you attended an UG 
party in SF you were most likely going to get hammered with about half the 
night of blistering techno.

Just my views as I sit back and watch the scene go through it's many 
phases...

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: Shazbot on An Epiphany Of Sound tomorrow, 9a-11a PST

Hey folks,
I wanted to make sure that everyone tunes in tomorrow to check out
Shazbot.  In his 4 years as a vinyl collector, Shazbot (Shawn Allen) has
dabbled in a variety of musical styles, from drum and bass and 2-step to
garage and deep house; from west-coast tribal and UK tech to Detroit
electro and Cologne glitch; from jackin' acid and quirky breakbeats to
minimal techno and electronic dub. Drawing from a vast array of musical
influences, his diverse selections are at once foreign and familiar,
cerebral yet danceable, and undeniably interesting.

We're on-air in the bay area at 90.1 FM and online at
http://kzsulive.stanford.edu

Peace.

oh come on have a sense of humor. you don't think throwing a Molotov
cocktail into a Starbucks would be fun? if you were playing Vice City
it'd be fun.

if it was Bugs Bunny throwing the cocktail, that would definitely be fun.

seriously if you want to prevent riots in 2005 then VOTE KERRY 2004.

Subject: [sfraves] Boycott?

Linda Rodstadt praised Michael Moore during a performance, and the
Aladdin Hotel threw her out.  Literally, she wasn't even allowed back
to her room.

http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/news/archive/2004/07/19/entertainment1424EDT0076.DTL

>>From the article:

"Ronstadt's comments drew loud boos and some of the 4,500 people in
attendance stormed out of the theater. People also tore down concert
posters and tossed cocktails into the air."

Nice town.

well, I see where you're coming from. I voted for Nader last election.
I'm sorry, but I'm almost certainly never voting third-party again. I
forgot how just plain EVIL the Republicans were. I'm never voting
third-party again, unless the Republican candidate is actually
physically dead. **AND** doing badly in the polls.

we do have some great techno DJs locally tho, Chris Jackson, Forest
Green, Andy W during one of his sobriety attacks, etc., and credit
where credit's due btw, Resource Records is another great local label.
or rather family of labels.

anyway, I've been gone for years and I've only just gotten back, so I
can't really comment on the scene, but I remember watching DJ Rush
destroy the universe at a 200-person loft party.

I think SF techno might have gotten a bit too experimental, elite, and
"intelligent" for its own good. it's not about being smart. it's about
destroying the universe.

	Unfortunately this is how the Democrats will hear your message:

"You don't have to change anything about what you're doing, because 
I'll support you either way. As long as you stay a couple steps behind 
the Republicans in the march toward a police state, you can take my 
vote for granted."

well I hate to admit this but you have a point. I mean the Democrats
would have certainly done better in the last election if they'd had
Nader's votes as well as their own, and their reaction was extremely
silly -- they had this attitude like they were entitled to Nader's
votes for some reason.

but, realistically, I can't have Republicans in office, and I can't
shoot them in the head without getting in trouble for it, so, it's a
rock and a hard place, innit. the devil and the deep blue sea.

I also voted for Nader in the last election and have supported Dennis 
Kuchinch in the primaries.  The Green Party platform, however, best 
represents my political ideology.

I have come to separate national politics and local, more grassroots, 
political action in my mind.  Specifically, it is far more likely that I, 
and others like me, can elect Green Party candidates and implement Green 
political agendas in San Francisco.  It is unrealistic to expect to 
accomplish these goals on a national level, and I'm tired of wasting 
"protest votes" in Presidential elections.  One little step at a time.

On the other hand, I find Bush and his administration loathsome to the 
extreme and even though Kerry is very, very far from my ideal candidate, 
I'll put aside personal feelings and beliefs and vote Democratic.  Again, 
one step at a time.

Love,

Apollo

Yes the labels still exist but they kinda suck now and Glenn Wilson is
nowhere near as popular as he was a few years back. They sound EXACTLY the
same as they did three years ago. And three years ago they had all kinda
took a real hard industrial turn already. I liked when the Sweedish sound
was just a little more creative and maybe even funky. Especially the first
3-4 Planet Rhythems.

I agree with your voting philosophy Apollo.

And while I also very much agree that Bush needs to go, I just hope groups 
like moveon.org and similar are as vigilant with Kerry and hold him 
accountable if and when he becomes president.  I guess I just don't have too 
much faith in democrats either.

We will see,
chiel

Its certainly true that my sense of humour has been
lacking recently, but also simulated riots aren't the
same as real riots....

Hello all,
I'm fairly new to this list. I usually lurk on most
lists, but I wanted to speak on this. I try to make it
out when any good, Detroit DJs are booked in SF. I
have noticed a lack of interest in techno as well,
probably for some of the reasons Macadio had
mentioned. However, I have been to a few parties that
pulled in a decent crowd. Richie Hawtin, Carl Craig,
John Arnold, Mathew Dear all had a pretty good
attendance imo. There is definitely an elitist vibe
from some fans of this realm of music. I personally
would like to see that attitude squashed.
I don't understand how people can talk trash about
whatever genre is hot for the youngins. Yet they don't
do enough to support the music they covet. Techno
sounds and feels much better on a decent system then
it does on your ipod or in your cubicle.
So for those who aren't offended. I just wanted to
drop a quick email to see how many people on this list
would be interested in attending a small monthly event
with a low cover charge and some really dope talent in
the Techno scene. I know I will be walking the walk
and checking out the monthlies that Shawn mentioned.

Basically, my friends and I are trying to start a
monthly 313 flavored event in SF. I will post a full
announcement soon, but I just wanted to see if I could
generate some early hype and get people to help spread
the word. Please shoot me an email off list if you'd
like more info. events@djcarceri.com

i think you hit the nail right on the head there
giles!  all that glitch is makin me itch...or stand up
against a wall with 30 other dudes bobbin my head to
what i think can be classified as a beat!  it has its
place...and i enjoy listening to it [liiiistening]. 
apparently you have to weigh between 140-150lbs and
appear to have not seen the light of day in 20+ years
to be a glitch/idm artist!  ummm...i think people
would rather dance to be quite honest.  esp. at a
friggin DANCE club/ event!  thats why i still try and
blow up the friggin universe when i DJ.  it's all i
know!!  

tech now,

First U.S. Loveparade Planned for October
World's largest electronic music parade comes to San
Francisco

SAN FRANCISCO  The world's largest electronic music
festival and parade is coming to San Francisco on
October 2, 2004. First held in Berlin in 1989,
Loveparade San Francisco is expected to draw thousands
of revelers to the Bay Area for a celebration of
electronic music with a mission of fostering
tolerance, respect and understanding between nations.

San Francisco has long been a desired location for
huge, outdoor, eclectic events, including the worlds'
largest Gay pride celebration and the famous Castro
Halloween and Folsom Street Fair parties. Loveparade
promises to be an event of the same caliber, drawing a
colorful and diverse audience while increasing the
existing tourist draw to the city.

This is the first time Loveparade has been held in the
United States; similar events are regularly held in
other cities around the globe, including Mexico City,
Cape Town, and Tel Aviv.

The event has garnered excitement from the business
community and beyond. California Assemblymember Mark
Leno was among those to recently offer his
congratulations on the city's acquisition of the
parade, calling it a "momentous and historic"
celebration. "I commend your commitment to create an
international community where music, dance, love and
diversity can creatively flourish."

International DJ/Producer Paul Van Dyk stated, "I was
very excited when I heard that the Loveparade will
take place in North America for the first time. I am
sure that the positive and peaceful vibe of this event
will be an extra feature in the amazing cultural life
of San Francisco and is going to become an annual
highlight."

The Loveparade will begin along San Francisco's scenic
Embarcadero and make its way through the South of
Market area. It will end along the waterfront in the
newly redeveloped Mission Bay district with a daylong
celebration featuring music, dancers, and a variety of
vendor booths. Top local and international DJs will
also be featured at the waterfront festival, as well
as on the floats as they make their way along the
parade route. For more information please visit
www.loveparadesf.org.

Mission of Loveparade San Francisco
Loveparade San Francisco exists to produce a parade of
love and diversity through electronic music and dance.
Loveparade San Francisco is a San Francisco based
501(c3) nonprofit.

"I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes 
me to tremble for the safety of my country.  As a result of the war, 
corporations have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places 
will follow, and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong 
its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth is 
aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed."
-Abraham Lincoln

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

  "I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of 
life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the 
beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club, 
party or other sound system that has ever achieved anything close to that..."
-Jeno, on the early days of Wicked and the Full Moon Raves

Here it goes, I have a friend who's extremely introverted.  He sufferes from low self esteem, and has a very dificult time making new friends.  I wish other people could get to know him like we do...  He's really a sweet guy who wants to "have a life" but is terrified of people and what they may think of him.  After years of trying, I manged to get him to a rave hoping it would help him snap out of it, and this is what he did:
 
Before the rave:

   Before leaving the house he demonstrated that he's an expert on procrastination
   Notciably excited, yet nervous and anxious
   Was extremely talkative in the car
   curious about he supposed to do and not do..
Once we arrived he:

   Stayed Quite
   Stood in the corner alone
   Was noticably terrified
   was uncomfortable being around soo many people.  (Fortunatly he stuck it out)
   Lost 100 IQ poiints when confronted by anyone who was simply trying to be friendly.  (I know he wanted to be friendly but couldnt).
   Used every excuse to avoid people or get out of a conversation...  (I've never seen anyone come up with soo many creative ways of avoiding a simple conversation.)
Afterwards:
 
I asked him how he liked it, and he stated that It was coo, and he wishes he could be like those people...  I tried telling him to simply be himself, and to relax.  Afterall, they are simply people who are there to have a good time, and not out to judge him, or ridicule him...  I know for a fact tthat he dug the music...  (when he wasn't looking, I spotted him a few times groovin to the music) :)
 
All in all he says he would like to go to another, but his fear would prevent him from doing so...  It was a minor miracle that I was able to get him out this time...  I hope I didn't scare him further into his shelll...  If anyone has any advice as to how I can help my firend out of his shell, please email me...
 
Thank you, 
A very concerned friend...

Subject: Re: [sfraves] looking for techno in SF... 

Chiming in response to a couple of points raised... First of all, anyone
that knows me knows I'm something of a techno evangelist. I wrote the
"Techno Is Back" cover story on Kompakt in this month's XLR8R magazine, as
well as the "techno's not dead" editor's rant at the front of the mag. Most
of what I cover in my writing is techno in one form or other, and almost al=
l
of what I DJ classifies as such. Some will call it minimal techno, some
microhouse, some tech-house, but at the end of the day, to me it's all
techno.

I really don=B9t see why some people think there's an "elitist" attitude
amongst techno listeners. Please, give examples. Whenever I hear charges of
"elitism" flying around I get suspicious -- that usually says more about th=
e
person weighing the charge. Just look at how Bush has successfully used the
tool of elitism to brand Democrats as rich, selfish, and out-of-touch
(strangely, qualities that *ought* to be applied to the ultra-elite such as
Bush and his moneyed supporters).

As for the charges of techno becoming boring, I think people just aren't
hearing enough. I know Kompakt has been tagged as a "chin-scratcher" label,
as a recent URB piece did, but jesus, listen to some of the recent Kompakt
and Speicher releases from Naum, Koze, Reinhard Voigt, M Mayer... it's all
absolutely storming, pounding shit with a vintage Frankfurt trance vibe.
Those tracks are so tough it's almost hard to play them out in SF, except a=
t
a proper rave. They're way too big for most of the bars and small clubs I
play here. And as for the more minimal stuff, a lot of it's really gone a
long way from the glitch experiments of Twerk, Sutekh, et al. (Sutekh, btw,
has been busting out some really fierce live sets lately.) Perlon is turnin=
g
out some of the sexiest, most ripply shit out there, and it's all infused
with the bass lines and forward momentum to make people move. Same goes for
Ricardo Villalobos, Luciano, all the Parisian cats (Krikor, Ark, Cabanne),
everyone affiliated with Areal, Traum, Trapez.

Ultimately, I think part of the problem is simply perception -- techno head=
s
like myself haven't figured out how to market this to SF crowds, neither th=
e
old-school ravers nor the younger kids, even the rock kids, to whom it woul=
d
easily appeal. Part of the problem is simply that "techno" is a dirty word
these days, besides being so broad that it doesn't mean much. When I say
"techno" I'm talking about music very very different from your Drumcode and
Intec releases, you know? And finally, there's very little name recognition=
,
especially of European techno artists, in San Francisco. It's hard enough
just to BUY Kompakt & Perlon records in SF shops... no one really knows who
the labels or artists are.

I sure don't know what the answer is -- my own monthly, the third-Saturday
party Soda at Rx -- is hardly drawing massive crowds yet. But I do think
that this music, including related strains of French acid, punkier techno
(for instance, the crossover between Blackstrobe's retro acid style and
Alter Ego's more classic minimal techno, as heard on Alter Ego's "Rocker"
12"; also heard in many Bpitch Control releases) could appeal to a lot of
folks -- and make for one hell of a good party. I've seen it go off in
Montreal and Barcelona; I just have no idea how to make it happen here.

uh... well my sarcastic side wants to ask if narcs really do have friends, 
but I'll be nice

this is such a classic story - I have heard this several times and the 
ending is usually "then he took some E and life did a u-turn"

basically, he needs to learn new behaviors, new ways of looking at the 
world - talk therapy is useful, but it takes so long to wear away
the roughness and things that are out of place.  it may all make sense at a 
intellectual level, but getting that understanding into
automatic behaviors (that self reinforce) is hard.

drugs are useful too to deal with the biological end of things, but they 
are not the only solution/cure all, despite all the advertising.
they are only useful as supportive tools.

as for the non-illegal drug way (Eli Lilly would recommend Paxil for his 
social anxiety disorder, but MDMA is cheaper, not as addictive, and
more effective, if properly used), you really can't do much until he is 
ready to change.  He has to get to the point where the cost of changing is
less than that of not changing.  all you can do is offer support and 
perhaps try pushing his buttons a bit to shake him out of his "trance".
but that takes some skill and you have to make sure your own ego is not 
getting stroked in doing so.

Sounds like your friend might need more than just to
be helped "out of his shell."  He could have an
anxiety disorder of some sort and that can be serious.
 I work with someone who has social anxiety disorder
and its a real problem for him.  

Your friend might want to talk to a psychologist or
psychiatrist about this possibility.  If that's too
much maybe he could just take a look around
http://www.socialphobia.org/ amd see if any of the
materials are helpful to him.

Best,

Peter

As odd as it might sound to those on the list that know me, I go through the 
same thing almost every time I go out...which may explain the large 
quantities of liquor I imbibe (but that's another story altogether).

Anyway - sounds like he has a touch of social anxiety disorder. I totally 
understand that. It's hard. I still feel like the proverbial "new guy" and 
I've been here for a year now. It's really hard to get out of that rut - you

uh... well my sarcastic side wants to ask if narcs really do have friends, 
but I'll be nice
 
I don't know about narcs having friends, but I do appreciate the lack of sarcasm...
 
this is such a classic story - I have heard this several times and the 
ending is usually "then he took some E and life did a u-turn"
 
I wish it were that simple...  I've tried getting him to take E but he flat out refuses...  So thats out of the question, for now...  I tihnk the therapy would be slower, but more usefull...
 
thanks for the info

It's after 2:30pm on Tuesday and i'm just crawling out of bed.
 
That's a sign of a most FANTABULOUS birthday weekend.

I can't thank you guys enough for coming out and helping me bring in
another year of immaturity! For those of you who couldn't make it, I'm
still going through the messages you sent along and thanks for that too!
It means alot to me.
 
To those who had personal goals of seeing me go from vertical to
horizontal - I am happy to report that at worst I was diagonal.  Which
is a good & happy place to be (believe me, you wouldn't want to see me
horizontal - and NO, its does NOT count if my "feet are vertical"!) LOL
But thanks a ton for the effort - the drinks were highly appreciated!  ;
)
 
Well thanks again, y'all.
 
~dina

I think you hit it perfectly....  I trully beleive that is exactly how he is looking at things....  
 
Gonna have to try large amounts of alcohol, hopefully he can achieve your level of comfort before passing out...  LOL
Anyways, I'll be looking for you at LL, just look for a blond 5' 11" wearing pink rabit ears...  :)  Hopefully I can get my friend to come out....  
 
I really appreciate your insight and understanding into this problem, and wish you the best of luck in conquering it...
 
Thank you...
 
Cheryl

        Usually, your first party is your best... You go through alot of 
experiences that you'd probably never go through... But I'd say QUEST in 2000 @ 
Homebase was my best rave I'd ever gone to. Being the fact that alot of my 
friends were never in the scene... and I'd finally convinced them to attend it with 
me... I've never felt such a good vibe from a party like I did that day...

       I remember when it was ok to just stand there at a rave and someone 
would walk up to you and just start conversation, chat for a bit... and then 
just go dance and party together... it was really about the music...

       Ever since the raves started being about the "drugs" and not the 
music, attitudes have changed, parties have changed, and people have changed... 

       If there was ever going to be a party where the vibe felt like 1999 - 
2000 parties... I'd definately be there... 

Lucky

hello, this is a continuation of a fictional piece:
 
"hey, ig."
"what."
"what are you doing now?"
"i am currently working on several projects. i am also working on my relationship."
"what relationship?"
"i've got a few going on. the one that is currently pending is the one i am most interested in though."
"oh, really."
"yes. i find the new stuff to be very satisfying, as i usually do. i can't help but chase. it is in my nature."
"oh, i see."
"do you really?"
"i think so."
"good, then i will continue with my more mundane projects and relationships."
"how many relationships are you actually having, ig?"
"i have absolutely no idea. i did not enter into all of them voluntarily."
"i see."
"i know." :)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Spirit of Raving: Q1: Best experience @ an Event...

I have to agree here.

you'll always find people that have experienced some phenomena (i.e. a
rave)  a number of times and so the phenomena loses its novelty.  when
this happens, they say things like "it was much better back in the day,
etc. etc."  they may even claim that the phenomena has changed when really
all that's changed is the person experiencing it.

the bad news:  you'll never have that 1st experience again.  innocence
lost.  you'll yearn for nostalgia.

the good news:  you'll never have to have that 1st experience again. 
innocence is finally lost.  nostalgia is overrated.  feeling that "things
have changed" means you're uncomfortable (in a good way).  the stage is
set for learning.

learning is the key to eternal youth.

old ass jaded ass old guy,
Jonas

I saw a whole mess of people back east abuse themselves on meth, and pay the
price in spades. Crystal Psychosis being the least of the problems. Hair
falling out, teeth falling out, sores all over. NASTY. Let's not forget
people with a shitload of money who basically went poor due to financing
their habits....the shit is evil.

I highly recommend anyone stay clear away from it.

Sounds like he has severe social anxiety or perhaps Aspergers
syndrome. Perhaps the best way for him to start is to get evaluated
for either of these.

Who knows, an mdma experience might help him learn to relax when
interacting. Helped me.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Seeking help for a friend... [nrr]


that really sounds like social anxiety disorder to me, I like to go about 
things the more "natural route" however...plain and simple, check out a book 
called "living with Joy" by Sanaya Roman, also check out "Soul 
Love"-awakenning your heart centers (everyone should read these, very 
incredible books) www.orindaben.com ...it is a channelled book which has 
offered me almost a "prozac" effect after reading it.  It deals with self 
asteem and positive self talk and absolutely everything in between..  I want 
to add yet another bit of advice as I have often seeked out friends who are 
in great need of help...make sure thay WANT TO Be HEALED or else your 
efforts will not be affective.  I just went to Santa Cruz on my bday and 
treated myself to a wonderful reading (psychic) and the lady was VERY 
helpful as I have been pretty depressed for quite sometime.  I do not know 
if your friend is into things like that, but it was very useful for me.
here is a number of a clairovoyant whom I have seen who is very helpful..
Maria Silvermoon (minister/clairovoyant/teacher (831) 338 4947 she is a 
pisces.
other things to check out...
"You can Heal Your Life" by Louisse Hay-new thought patterns
"the Power of Now" by Eckhart Tolle
Well, I hope some of these things can help...
Much Love,
Danny

DJ: Indie Electro
Ladytron

when: Fri 7.23 (9pm)where: Rx Gallery (132 Eddy St, 415.474.RXSF)price: 
$10 / $5 advance

 


"However enticing or discomforting the trend of the indie star-turned-DJ may be, tonight's set from DJ-turned-Ladytron founder and chief songwriter Danny Hunt pleases everyone. Before he acquired bandmates and secondhand analog equipment, Hunt started a UK club night for his Invicta Hi-Fi label, spinning eclectic '60s, soul, and post-punk tunes that highlight both the organic and electronic. Remixes of DJ buddies Soulwax and DJ/not-DJ buddy Erlend ye should round out a night celebrating the dancier aspects of rock and bring a Liverpudlian disco aura to San Francisco. "

"I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes 
me to tremble for the safety of my country.  As a result of the war, 
corporations have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places 
will follow, and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong 
its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth is 
aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed."
-Abraham Lincoln

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

  "I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of 
life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the 
beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club, 
party or other sound system that has ever achieved anything close to that..."
-Jeno, on the early days of Wicked and the Full Moon Raves

I'm pretty much a lurker, but couldn't resist posting. I suffer from the
same type of problems as your friend, although not as severe, and I =
found
mustering up the will to go out and approach people incredibly dificult. =


My advice:=20

Encourage him to continue going out and make new friends, but don't be
pushy. I found forcing myself into uncomfortable situations, extremely =
hard,
but extremely rewarding. He will stumble and fall, and that=92s ok, he =
simply
needs to keep going. As he gets more comfortable, and meets new people, =
it
will get easier. Growth only comes through pain and struggle, and maybe =
if
he's willing, try some MDMA. It was used as a psychotherapeutic tool for
cases similar to this 20-30 years ago. It will help break the Ice and =
help
him to open up. Trust me, I know =3D)

I wish you and your friend the best of luck, I don't envy his road ahead =
but
believe me it will get easier.

I'm gonna go back to lurking now =3D)

If your friend wants to talk he can IM me at:

Here it goes, I have a friend who's extremely introverted. He sufferes =
from
low self esteem, and has a very dificult time making new friends. I wish
other people could get to know him like we do... He's really a sweet guy =
who
wants to "have a life" but is terrified of people and what they may =
think of
him. After years of trying, I manged to get him to a rave hoping it =
would
help him snap out of it, and this is what he did:

Before the rave:

Before leaving the house he demonstrated that he's an expert on
procrastination

Notciably excited, yet nervous and anxious

Was extremely talkative in the car

curious about he supposed to do and not do..

Once we arrived he:

Stayed Quite

Stood in the corner alone

Was noticably terrified

was uncomfortable being around soo many people. (Fortunatly he stuck it =
out)

Lost 100 IQ poiints when confronted by anyone who was simply trying to =
be
friendly. (I know he wanted to be friendly but couldnt).

Used every excuse to avoid people or get out of a conversation... (I've
never seen anyone come up with soo many creative ways of avoiding a =
simple
conversation.)

Afterwards:

I asked him how he liked it, and he stated that It was coo, and he =
wishes he
could be like those people... I tried telling him to simply be himself, =
and
to relax. Afterall, they are simply people who are there to have a good
time, and not out to judge him, or ridicule him... I know for a fact =
tthat
he dug the music... (when he wasn't looking, I spotted him a few times
groovin to the music) :)

All in all he says he would like to go to another, but his fear would
prevent him from doing so... It was a minor miracle that I was able to =
get
him out this time... I hope I didn't scare him further into his =
shelll... If
anyone has any advice as to how I can help my firend out of his shell,
please email me...

Thank you,

A very concerned friend...

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Spirit of Raving: Q1: Best experience @ an Event...

Beyond novelty, I think it also has to do with changes.

Our scene changes very rapidly, either you grow along with it or you
get left behind. As to whether it changes for the better or worse,
it's really up to the individual.

When trance was huge in 1997-2001, u hear the househeads complaining
about how the old house days was better, because they refused to go
with the flow and embrace trance. Of course, house took over once
again from 2001 and the cycle continues.

Personally, I've been a jaded party kids 3 times over already, but
each time I managed to eventually find excitingly new emerging music
that made it fresh for me all over again. That's what keeps me going:
I know the old days were gr8, but tomoorow there'll mgiht very well be
something entirely different and as exciting.

Don't look back, look forward. Trust me, the best days are yet to come.  ;)


Love,

- Jeff

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Spirit of Raving: Q1: Best experience @ an Event...

Well, one of the things that gets *ME* into the occasional "it's not as 
good as back when" fit isn't so much pure nostalgia as certain people I 
miss.

There are good parties still being thrown, no doubt.  But there are 
people I miss, who don't, or rarely, go to parties anymore.  There are 
crews I miss, who don't throw parties anymore.  There are friends whom 
I hardly get to see at all anymore.  There are groups of friends, who 
used to be inseparable, whom have drifted apart, or have had drama tear 
them apart.  Hell, there are a ton of people, right here on this list, 
whom I used to see every week at Blake's, who I don't think I've seen 
in almost a year.

Not that there aren't good things going on now.  But there are 
definitely some major good times that are in the past.

Of course, while I don't deny there are good parties still happening, 
my own best memories are in the past as well.  There was a stretch, 
throughout the first half of 2002, where EVERYTHING seemed to come 
together for me as a raver.  And more of my most happy party memories 
come from that period than any other.  And the two parties that anchor 
the ends of that stretch were thrown by one of those aforementioned 
"crews that don't throw parties anymore" whom I really, Really, REALLY 
miss.  That crew being UNITY, and the parties being "Imagine Us In 
Wonderland" in January, and "Imagine" in June.

I posted a review of "Imagine" to SFRaves a few days after the party 
itself.  It just so happens, I had dropped a copy into my livejournal 
as well.  I just dug it up, and read it again.  And just reading that 
review, just remembering that party, is enough to bring me into "tears 
of happiness" mode.  To give you an idea of that moment, to answer the 
"Best experience @ an Event..." question, here is a repost of my old 
review of "Imagine", Saturday, June 22, 2002:



Imagine...

  Oh...

My...

God...

If there's one crew that can always bring out the very best of 
everything the rave scene is about, it's Unity. Part of me can still 
hardly believe how perfectly this whole weekend went. From the 
excitement of getting ready; to the anticipation of waiting for the 
doors to open; to the hours of PERFECT partieing ai Imagine, to the 
awesome afterpartie... Everything was just... amazing. I'm still 
dumbfounded at what an amazing partie that was.

I shouldn't be. Since when has Unity EVER let us down? This gives 
Unity's own: "Imagine us in Wonderland", back in January, a serious run 
for its money as best partie EVER. Certianly it was the best LARGE 
partie ever. Of course, I NEVER doubted Duckee for a second. I had 
bought my ticket (#156) MONTHS in advance, and had been awiting the 
22nd with increasing anticipation for the whole time. I knew it would 
be am awesome party... but Oh... My... God!!!

The only things about the whole weekend that went in any way wrong 
actually happened BEFORE Imagine. Since the venue had supposedly been 
having problems meeting fire code, they delayed letting everyone 
(including the Unity crew) in for about forty-five minutes while the 
walked through the place. That, and the pre-party I was going to go to 
fell through. Kinda a bummer, but I just spent the extra time getting 
ready.

And if there is EVER a time to go all out, it's a Unity party. My 
pockets were loaded down with so much Kandy, candy, and toys, I'm 
AMAZED that I breezed through security with no problems like I did. 
Just a quick pat-down, and I showed him that my camera was really a 
camera and not a brick, and I was in. 'Tis a shame that courteous and 
respectful security types are so rare that it deserves a mention in a 
review. But Unity even delivered on THAT. Like everything about 
Imagine, that's the way it should be ALL the time.

So after saying Hey to the people I spotted in line, and the crew 
members who weren't busy yet, I spent about ten minutes at a bench near 
the back getting kandied up. The whole time, I was getting the "what 
the fuck???" look from this one security guard; who nevertheless was 
pretty friendly, and even handed me a couple things I dropped.

So, with my pants less weighted down, I was ready to dance. And I did 
so for the first hour and a half or so. When I stopped for my first 
water/Red Bull break, I started making the rounds to say hey to 
everyone who had been arriving in the meantime...

And, oh my... I saw SOOOO many people I knew there. I couldn't even 
begin to list them here. I even found people whom I NEVER expected that 
I'd see at such a "candy" party as an Imagine. Imagine being a larger 
partie than I usually attend, I found them everywhere while making the 
circuit around the building. That ate up a fair bit of time, untill I 
found myself back in the main room for the Check Ceremony.

And that's just another thing I LOVE about the Unity crew. Where so 
many other crews see the scene as something to exploit to fatten their 
own wallets; Unity throws their parties for the RIGHT reasons. That 
they forego making a profit, so that they can make every partie a 
benefit, is just astoundingly cool.

But moreso than the check ceremony itself... The rest of the happenings 
in that lull were just overwhealming. Alison read her poetry to an 
enthralled crowd; and some beautiful poetry it was. But the video... 
Oh... My... God... I was in tears of happiness before it was even a 
halfway through. That just brough back so many memories of the previous 
Unity parties. That one crew has dome SOOO much good here is just 
staggering.

Soon, it was time for Denise to play. I got up on stage during her set 
to snag some pictures of the crew and crowd. And Denise herself posed 
for a pic that should come out REALLY cute when I get them developed. 
And wow... that's the first time I got up there, at a Unity party, or 
otherwise. And to look at that sea of smileing faces is just short of 
overwhealming... intoxicating even.

But I couldn't burn time standing up there... not with Denise playing. 
So I hopped down, and worked my way back to where there was room to 
dance. And yah... again I was running into MORE friends I hadn't seen 
yet that night! Eventually I *DID* get to dance to Denise a little... 
only about ten minutes tho...

But I *DID* get to dance a lot to ANTHONY MAD!!! Oh... My... God!!! 
With local DJs like Anthony and Denise, who NEEDS those out of town 
"superstars"??? Anthony positively tore the roof off!!! I couldn't stop 
bouncing and bouncing and bouncing... maybe THAT's why so many people 
mistake me for Tigger? I was shocked as hell when I heard what I 
thought was Anthony trainwrecking tho. Anthony? Trainwrecking? I 
couldn't believe it! But it turns out that was not the case. I worked 
my way back up front to get some pics of him, and I saw the truth. SOOO 
many people were dancing, WITH THE BEAT, that they were litterally 
bouncing the needles off the records every so often!!! How fucking cool 
is THAT?!?!?

After Anthony was done, I took another longish water/Red 
Bull/socializing break. I ran into even MORE friends; met some peeps I 
hadn't seen in FOREVER, totally bonded with some more people... getting 
to know them much better.... making plans for more parties in the 
future... going from friend to friend to friend.... hanging out in the 
light tunnel... I could hardly believe the positive vibes of the party! 
Not that I EVER doubted Unity... but damn!!!

So for the last half hour, we all popped back down for the finale. 
Damn... A thousand or more of the BEST people, dancing non-stop, to the 
BEST music, with the BEST crew in the scene on stage leading us on. 
Could anything in the world be better? So the music took a short break 
while duckee got on stage to say his thank you's. Oh... My... God... Is 
there ANYONE more postivibe in the scene than the Unity crew???? I 
can't think of anyone! Then the music started again... a few more 
minutes of music, topping out with.... what else?

Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people
Living for today...

Imagine there's no country
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no rerligion too
Imagine all the people
Living life in peace

Imagine no possetions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people
Shareing all the world

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the would will live as one.

(Originally by John Lennon (obviously), but recited all from memory (no 
cheating on my part!))

(Words to live by (even more obviously))


Thank you Unity!


cya,
john

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Spirit of Raving: Q1: Best experience @ an Event...

So here's a theory I have for a long time about how parties or the
scene seems to be more drug-oriented than b4.....

Parties are never "drug-oriented" and "music-oriented", people are.

By extension, people are never  "drug-oriented" and "music-oriented"
at large, the individuals are.

And in many cases, the "individuals" that make you feel the way you do
are YOU and your friends.

-----

People generally will go out for both the music and the drugs. The
reason you feel a party is more drug-oriented is probably because:

1. You didn't see any good DJs or new music, it's all the same shit
u've heard b4
2. You see way more e-tards in hug puddles than usual
3. you and you friends went out just to do drugs
( feel free to add your reasons)

For #1, it's mainly beacuse you're more knowledgable now and have seen
more DJs than u have when u first started partying. The novelty worn
off. At the same time, each genre of EDM has a natural cycle of 4-5
years and there'll always be a period of exciting innovative music
followed by formulative rehashes.

For #2, I think it's mainly the fact that you're not into the music at
party, so you actually stop dancing and look around and notice what
goes on @ EVERY PARTY since the dawn of time. Really, it's always been
about drugs as much as the music. Sometimes u ignore it, sometimes you
overlook it, sometimes you're too naive to even notice it. But it's
always been there, and it always has been about the same level, it's
really a matter of how much attention you paid to it.

#3: Why would you and your friends would go to a party where the
headliners are DJs u've already heard 50 times? Drugs. Now if u go to
a party because they book a number of DJs u've NEVER seen b4, then you
went because of the music. Hence, you can't expect the crowd to come
out "for the music" unless the faces are fresh and the music is hot.
If producers are making innovative music, and when a lot of new faces
in the DJ world emerge, then you can be reasonably sure that the party
scene at large will be music-oriented. Personally they were 92, 96-97
and 2000 for me. Notice there's a 4 yrs cycle.

My point is, drug use is pretty constant in our scene
proportitionally, but music goes in cycles. So the drug use seems
worse only relatively, IMHO. So if one feels the scene is more
drug-oriented than it was, it's mainly a reflection of his/her lack of
enthuiasm in the music coming out today than anything else.

But anyways, that's just my theory.

- Jeff

Near future?

Back when I was still in high school, I had a friend who worked at the 
local Pizza Hut.

Even back then, their phones were hooked into a callerID box that would 
bring up your name, address, and so on, on a computer screen when you 
called them.  No doubt, it's more sophisticated now... then the 
information was just what you gave them the last time you ordered.  So 
if you'd never ordered pizza from that line before, they had bupkis.

But at least Pizza Hut has a legitimate reason for asking for your 
address.  Radio Shack, OTOH, trying to get my address every time I 
bought something... with cash.... was obnoxious as all hell.

if you're getting patted-down by security, you're not at a rave.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: cheap flights to Vancouver?

First of all, how last min is this? 7-day adv or more? Or this weekend?


If you have 14-day dav or more, use the usual online booking services
to search for specials. Oribtz has the better checking of availabilty
and price comparisons, Travelocity has the actual flight specials in
full text so you can see all the valid travel dates, restirctions,
etc.

If u need to fly in less than 7-days, first check United and Alaska,
they frequently has SF<->VAN specials for this/next weekends. Next u
should try PriceLine. Many ppl has good success with it for last min
flights.

Personally, f I need to fly within 7 days, I usually ask my friends to
hook me up with companion passes and fly stand-by.

Cheryl,

	It's nice that you are concerned and trying to coax your friend =
out of=20
his shell. Perhaps taking a public speaking class or joining=20
Toastmasters (a sort of hobby group for people to practice giving=20
speeches) could be the thing for him. A class environment like this is=20=

generally more supportive and less socially stressful while still=20
helping build confidence to speak to people in social situations.

	I found the public speaking class I took at SF State to be good =
not=20
only for improving my comfort level with getting up and talking in=20
front of a group, but also for the feedback that gave me a greater=20
awareness of things like breathing, my tendency to mumble, speaking too=20=

rapidly, body language, posture, gestures, etc., that can cause=20
problems for peoples' interactions without them being consciously aware=20=

of an issue until it is pointed out by someone else. Kind of like when=20=

there is something green hanging out of your nose.  8)
=09
	Another strategy might be continually introducing your friend to=20=

people in social settings, and steering them toward topics or styles of=20=

communicating that you know he is more comfortable with. You can have a=20=

secret code between the two of you so that he can nudge you or=20
something when he needs to let you know he's feeling like "I can't take=20=

this any more, I have to go stand over in the corner now."

	At parties, perhaps your friend might be more comfortable =
expressing=20
himself physically first rather than interacting with strangers, such=20
as by dancing with you or someone he knows, or twirling glowsticks on=20
his own, or even just taking pictures of other people. If you have a=20
polaroid or digital camera to take someone's picture and be able to=20
give or show it to them, that's a great ice breaker.

	Having something to do with his mouth could also help reduce the=20=

feeling of pressure to talk. If your friend doesn't smoke, give him a=20
lollipop or better yet a pacifier to suck on. People won't expect him=20
to communicate as much, and will probably assume he's on E and become=20
more friendly, especially if he's dressed like a candy raver.   8)

Groove on,

	Well, of course there's "Doc" Martin, and there must be a "DJ Dope" 
out there somewhere who could stand in for "Dopey" to round out your 
3x6 set. According to Oingo Boingo, of the seven dwarves there's "only 
four alive today," and that was nearly 20 years ago ("Cinderella 
Undercover")...

	I'm drawing a blank on Snow White right now, but I do know a Prince 
impersonator, and I'm sure there's an out gay guy who's gone to Wicked 
parties to fill the "Wicked Queen" role...  She could fake having a bad 
trip during the party and be all like, "Oh no! I'm melting!" Oh wait, 
that was the Wicked Witch.  8)

	Hmm, let's see, now how am I going to work the Libertarian Party into 
this post?

Groove on,

Hi Danny, 
First off, I want to say Happy bday...  :)  I think its great the clarvoyant helped you out of your depression.  I beleive in them too, even though most people think I'm nuts.  Hehe, what do they know  :)  Thanks for recomending the books, I'm gonna read them myself.  :)  
 
Love 
Cheryl
 
I saw one a year ago,  and your right if your willing to beleive in them, they can be used to help put life back into perspective.

treated myself to a wonderful reading (psychic) and the lady was VERY 
helpful as I have been pretty depressed for quite sometime. I do not know 
if your friend is into things like that, but it was very useful for me.
here is a number of a clairovoyant whom I have seen who is very helpful..

other things to check out...
"You can Heal Your Life" by Louisse Hay-new thought patterns

*My* sarcastic side says narcs don't know how to quote.

How did your friend ever become your friend, what with his seemingly 
major social issues?????

Study that process, then repeat.

I say Cheryl should loosen him up a little before taking him out. An
orgasm before going out does wonders for the nerves.

I think Cheryl is a cop.

Go chug a bottle, narc.

All the people saying "get him therapy" or "give him drugs" have a
point, but the Johnny Appleseed of Ecstasy was a therapist. This is
when E was legal, and he's something of a legend -- "Pihkal" and
"Altered State" actually give different spellings of his name, but I'm
inclined to trust "Pihkal". Anyway he discovered this stuff and it
revitalized his career as well as changing lives all over the country.
And then its recreational qualities were discovered, then
criminalization, then acid house, yadda yadda...

Anyway -- point is, therapy and Ecstasy are not actually mutually
exclusive. You could actually give him both.

Anyway, you should totally do something about that, because everybody
knows that shy people are really all serial killers waiting to happen.

thank you, Jeff!

what you said made my day!  =)

i've been in the scene since 1995 and i've gone through cycles, too, and
lately i've been in kind of a winter state, but your words have awakened a
vision of spring in me again.

thank you so much!

love,

Beyond novelty, I think it also has to do with changes.

Our scene changes very rapidly, either you grow along with it or you
get left behind. As to whether it changes for the better or worse,
it's really up to the individual.

When trance was huge in 1997-2001, u hear the househeads complaining
about how the old house days was better, because they refused to go
with the flow and embrace trance. Of course, house took over once
again from 2001 and the cycle continues.

Personally, I've been a jaded party kids 3 times over already, but
each time I managed to eventually find excitingly new emerging music
that made it fresh for me all over again. That's what keeps me going:
I know the old days were gr8, but tomoorow there'll mgiht very well be
something entirely different and as exciting.

Don't look back, look forward. Trust me, the best days are yet to come.  ;)


Love,

- Jeff

How did your friend ever become your friend, what with his seemingly

Study that process, then repeat.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Seeking help for a friend... [nrr]

I hope you were posting those web-sites as a joke because they have some
serious misinformation in them, here are a few mistakes I found:

"DXM is a cough medicine that dries out the lungs, and makes dehydrating
even more dangerous and likely to happen."=20

Um no, Guaifenesin must be what this statement is referring to. It
doesn't really dry out the lungs, but rather is an an Expectorant (water
is also an expectorant), it loosens up the saliva and evacuates it from
the body. Large doses of it causes you to vomit. DXM, on the other hand
could cause dehydration because it can increase sweating and also can
cause serotonin syndrome when used in conjunction with MDMA, MDEA, and
MDA.

"Pills are at least 75 mgs and usually are from 80-120 mgs."

Um, no. We only wish. Pills can be anything from 0mg to who knows what.

"One way to see of the pill is pure MDMA or has been altered with other
drugs is to look at the color. Pure MDMA pills are white without any
impurities."

Haha. No.

"will sell "Extacy Kits" that test the quantities of the pill and also
determine the strength of it."

Maybe it will tell you if the pill has MDMA in it, but it wont tell you
anything else.

"Extacy"

It's Ecstacy.

There are a ton of other mistakes in this article. Who the heck wrote
it? It really does more harm then good.

"I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes 
me to tremble for the safety of my country.  As a result of the war, 
corporations have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places 
will follow, and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong 
its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth is 
aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed."
-Abraham Lincoln

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

  "I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of 
life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the 
beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club, 
party or other sound system that has ever achieved anything close to that..."
-Jeno, on the early days of Wicked and the Full Moon Raves

Perhaps just dealing with being shy doesn't mean you need to brand him as
a problem (force feeding E, going to counseling, anti-depressants /
anti-anxiety, etc).  You sound like my old doctor, and you don't even get
offerred a new set of Pings when you sign your thousandth Zoloft scrip.

My recommendation is get some sets of DJs, he'll tend to like some more
than others.  When those DJs play, go check it out.  He'll feel more
comfortable because he was involved in the choice.  When he feels he owns
the situation more, the shyness will be less of an issue.  Hell, he
doesn't have to experience it the same way you do... try a music first
approach.  The music can grow on him in a totally non-social way... so
he'll be dealing on some level when you get out there rather than feeling
like a total stranger.

I still have trouble meeting people, or not making an ass of myself.  But
I have learned, with the help of my friends to embrace my lame ass (just
don't take pictures of my doing so).

Perhaps just dealing with being shy doesn't mean you need to brand him =
as
a problem (force feeding E, going to counseling, anti-depressants /
anti-anxiety, etc).  You sound like my old doctor, and you don't even =
get
offerred a new set of Pings when you sign your thousandth Zoloft scrip.

My recommendation is get some sets of DJs, he'll tend to like some more
than others.  When those DJs play, go check it out.  He'll feel more
comfortable because he was involved in the choice.  When he feels he =
owns
the situation more, the shyness will be less of an issue.  Hell, he
doesn't have to experience it the same way you do... try a music first
approach.  The music can grow on him in a totally non-social way... so
he'll be dealing on some level when you get out there rather than =
feeling
like a total stranger.

I still have trouble meeting people, or not making an ass of myself.  =
But
I have learned, with the help of my friends to embrace my lame ass (just
don't take pictures of my doing so).

Wow that sucks.. But one good thing is that at least they are not trying to 
pass it off as a **Benefit** party cause then I would be like DB could go 
fuck his self.. Respected big name DJ or not. He made a bad business 
decision with someone who sounds very sketchy.. and for him to be doing a 
large scale party it sounds like, with someone who still lives with there 
parents?? that should be your first clue.. Unless the said person is a minor 
or in there early 20's then I could see that.

We all know throwing parties is a Risky business at best and if you are 
willing to reap the HUGE profits then you should also be ready to reap the 
HUGE losses..

But that lineup you can't beat for $10 if I was in NYC I would go and drop a 
cool Jackson in the till..

PS: NOT to be confused with Chris Jackson   ;)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Seeking help for a friend... [nrr]

	I really don't understand why you guys seem to think Cheryl is a narc. 
She didn't come on here trying to buy Ecstasy or something, just 
looking for advice. It seems to me that a real narc would email a bunch 
of people from the list individually.

	Perhaps something like, "Sorry to bother you, I'm having kind of an 
emergency, I'm supposed to have a private birthday party for my best 
friend this weekend. We had planned to surprise her by making it an E 
party and made a bunch of preparations... unfortunately the guy who was 
supposed to supply the favors got busted, and now we have no one to 
turn to. Do you know anyone who could come up with about 30 hits on 
short notice? We have money and paying will not be a problem."

	Cheryl doesn't seem like a narc to me, just a concerned friend. It's a 
pretty ugly accusation unless there's some real evidence.

Peace, love & liberty,
					<<< Starchild >>>

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: hillsborough tragedy of 1989 and the SUN scandal, finally an apology!

http://media.guardian.co.uk/presspublishing/story/0,7495,1255804,00.html

i found this article in the Guardian UK about the 1989 Hillsborough stadium 
disaster, where 86 people lost they life crushed in one of the cages.

the sun the day after the event published a front page story in disfavor of 
the liverpool fans, stating that some of them had "animal behavior" 
urinating on police officers trying to help the inured and picking pockets 
of the victims.

15 years late the sun apologizes, admitting "it was worst mistake in the 
history of journalism"!

susie!

 Starchild, 
 
Thank you  :)  It pains me to see good hearted people lonely and isolated all the time...  
Its funny you brought up a "public speaking class" becasue hes taking one right now...  He's doing very well, despite his flushed look when he gives his presentation...  :) 
 
I think your on to something, athough I doubt I'll ever be able to dress him up as a candy raver...  :)

Cheryl,

It's nice that you are concerned and trying to coax your friend out of 
his shell. Perhaps taking a public speaking class or joining 
Toastmasters (a sort of hobby group for people to practice giving 
speeches) could be the thing for him. A class environment like this is 
generally more supportive and less socially stressful while still 
helping build confidence to speak to people in social situations.

I found the public speaking class I took at SF State to be good not 
only for improving my comfort level with getting up and talking in 
front of a group, but also for the feedback that gave me a greater 
awareness of things like breathing, my tendency to mumble, speaking too 
rapidly, body language, posture, gestures, etc., that can cause 
problems for peoples' interactions without them being consciously aware 
of an issue until it is pointed out by someone else. Kind of like when 
there is something green hanging out of your nose. 8)

Another strategy might be continually introducing your friend to 
people in social settings, and steering them toward topics or styles of 
communicating that you know he is more comfortable with. You can have a 
secret code between the two of you so that he can nudge you or 
something when he needs to let you know he's feeling like "I can't take 
this any more, I have to go stand over in the corner now."

At parties, perhaps your friend might be more comfortable expressing 
himself physically first rather than interacting with strangers, such 
as by dancing with you or someone he knows, or twirling glowsticks on 
his own, or even just taking pictures of other people. If you have a 
polaroid or digital camera to take someone's picture and be able to 
give or show it to them, that's a great ice breaker.

Having something to do with his mouth could also help reduce the 
feeling of pressure to talk. If your friend doesn't smoke, give him a 
lollipop or better yet a pacifier to suck on. People won't expect him 
to communicate as much, and will probably assume he's on E and become 
more friendly, especially if he's dressed like a candy raver. 8)

Groove on,
<<< Starchild >>>

what Andy is trying to say is "put the guy in front of me whenever I spin, 
while I spin, and for as long as it takes for him to offer me a BJ"
and whatever he does, do not take a picture of it.
Lets pray to god the friend of yours is not a virgo  ;P

>>spinning for a short time before the cops' arrival, to appear in court on
>>July 22 for "Operation of Sound Reproductive Device Without a Permit." The
>>section of the New York City noise code cited, 10.108.23, says a police
>>spokesperson, allows a violation to be given to a person operating "any sound
>>production device in a public area, even if it's in a bar. If music can be

>>a bit strange to cite the DJ, not the bar. The NYPD spokesperson would only
>>say, "I don't know the circumstances." 
>>
>>Rodriguez, who is not the club's resident DJ, says that when he arrived on
>>the corner of North 3rd Street and Kent Avenue and got out of his car, "I
>>could hear the music, so it was kind of loud. The employee was there, so I
>>thought it was OK." He said the employee had come over and turned the volume
>>down a "significant" amount when the cops arrived. The owner, THOMAS
>>SANDBICHLER, says, "The violation was given because we had the door open and
>>the music spilled into the street. They thereby said we were operating
>>amplified equipment on the street. That's not part of the license. It's a
>>bullshit summons." 
>>
>>The bar's already tallied up several violations, says Sandbichler. ("They
>>give out tickets like candy," he says.) The visits are fueled by 311 calls,
>>which may become more frequent citywide if the mayor's plan to overhaul the
>>noise code goes through. (According to the mayor's office, noise ranks number
>>one in complaints to the 311 line, and averages 1,000 calls a day.) While the
>>mayor's proposing to do away with some provisions that are too vague (such as
>>limiting the standard of judging a noise complaint as "unreasonable to a
>>person of normal sensitivities"), other suggested changes may turn out to be
>>more strict (such as throwing out the noise meter and going by the "plainly
>>audible" standard). Wait, I'm deaf-that might work wonderfully! Meanwhile,
>>Rodriguez, who just moved back to the States after six years in Barcelona, is

I saw a whole mess of people back east abuse themselves on meth, and pay =
the
price in spades. Crystal Psychosis being the least of the problems. Hair
falling out, teeth falling out, sores all over. NASTY. Let's not forget
people with a shitload of money who basically went poor due to financing
their habits....the shit is evil.

I highly recommend anyone stay clear away from it.

Thanks Starchild, I don't let them bother me...  They're only trying to having fun, albeit at my expense, but thats not important; besides anyone who knows me knows the truth and thats whats important...  :)

She didn't come on here trying to buy Ecstasy or something, just 
looking for advice. It seems to me that a real narc would email a bunch 
of people from the list individually.

Perhaps something like, "Sorry to bother you, I'm having kind of an 
emergency, I'm supposed to have a private birthday party for my best 
friend this weekend. We had planned to surprise her by making it an E 
party and made a bunch of preparations... unfortunately the guy who was 
supposed to supply the favors got busted, and now we have no one to 
turn to. Do you know anyone who could come up with about 30 hits on 
short notice? We have money and paying will not be a problem."

Cheryl doesn't seem like a narc to me, just a concerned friend. It's a 
pretty ugly accusation unless there's some real evidence.

Peace, love & liberty,

Great review of Imagine, John. I was at that party and your recounting  helps 
keep it fresh in my mind. It was indeed a most memorable party.  I  would 
definitely say that party was unique -- I can't 'imagine' being allowed to  throw 
a party at SF City Hall in the post 9/11 world. 
 
I sure miss Unity. It was great to see Duckeee at 1999.  There are  other 
crews that I miss, but it's not the same without Unity.

SOMA Sessions
SF Drum 'n Bass Fourth Fridays
http://www.somasessions.com

SOMA Sessions is San Francisco's premier Friday night
Jungle/Drum 'n Bass party.  On every Fourth Friday we
invite leading hand-picked DJ talents from around the
globe to play extended sets in an intimate setting
which forms the idea of the "session"...


Friday July 23, 2004

SKYNET (Skynet Recordings, Discrete, nVision - UK)
Following his early years as a self-aware nuclear
defense system hell-bent on the destruction of the
humans, Brighton's Skynet kindled his creative side
and forged innovative D&B with partner Stakka on the
Liftin' Spirit, Audio Blueprint and Underfire labels.
Producing together since 1993, their efforts
culminated in the timeless Clockwork LP of 2001.
Winding forward, 2004 finds Skynet bearing a prolific
solo output and no fewer than three imprints- Skynet
Recs, Discrete and nVision. Join The Terminator
himself on this mission into the future of
techstep....

RANDO (Levitated Recordings, Phuturo - SF)

DJ M (SOMA Sessions)

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Digweed @ Mezzanine 9/3

Who has seen Digweed spin lately?? I haven't seen him before, nor do I know 
what mezzanine is like so I am wondering if it worth the $25 bucks.  I am on 
a new kick to see as many of the top 50 DJ's as I can so he is on the list 
obviously and for $25 it seems reasonable.. but I really want to know if he 
can still get the pawty jumpin'???

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Digweed @ Mezzanine 9/3

He's one of the few big name DJ's I'd pay that kind of money to see. He 
plays a nice chunky set - tends to dip into some tribal sounds, as well as 
dark prog. Seamless mixes, good progression.

Of course, the last time I saw him was '99 - so he could blow ass now. lol

Who is this shazbot?  I see the name all over the place but
mysteriously, I have never met a shazbot that I know of :)  Whatever. 
Anyone have a picture?

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Saturday @ Anu!

Shazbot is a chump...plain and simple.  He's this super uber-dorky guy =
who
tries to pretend he's cool, like playing records makes him cool or
something.

HAHAHAHA, just kidding Shawn...He's actually a really cool guy, plays =
some
sick ass techno.  Beware he will melt your mind with his funky techno =
bouncy
whatever it's called sound (like at Harvest party at Otherworld....holy =
cow
that was the coolest set ever, I didn't want that shit to end).  He =
rocks
the party...really cool cat if you get the chance to chat with him.  You
should check him out.

Here I am at Anu:

Except now my hair is a little longer because I can't afford a haircut.
Come say hi on Saturday, I won't bite.

Yeah and if you stick around to the end and ask George and Andrew nicely
they might tell you about a little party happening all night in Emeryville
for Buck Murdoc's bday...

Guess that means the guy from Anu called you guys back finally? Damn
conflicting plans.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Saturday @ Anu!

Hey I just wanted to add that I've been trying to coordinate a monthly for
George and myself at Anu for a while now, and that this night is a bit of a
last minute test run to see how we fit.  I'd appreciate support from anyone
that can stop down between the BBQ and Tyler's Bday mayhem even if just for
one drink, a good showing will help our cause in getting the monthly.  I'll
be hitting up both myself, I hope there are still some sane people left by
the time we show up at Tyler's...

Oh and I promise a jamming set from Sen-Sei and myself, we had a blast
playing at LivingRoom Lounge together last month and might be recording this
one to play on XM Satellite Radio at a later date, plus with George's bass
slappin' goodness thrown in how can you go wrong?  ;)

-Andrew

Subject: [sfraves] christian bloch, techno in SF, miss kittin + 

nice!  i'm excited to see christian bloch is playing! 
i hear that he's living out here now, so hopefully
we'll get to hear him more often.  i got to hear him i
believe play live at an afterparty last year after
movement in detroit and he played some amazing acid. 
so thanks to whoever's organized this.  

as for techno in SF, the main tips i got were Soda at
the Rx Gallery (3rd saturday, i believe), Hugger
Mugger, and then i'll have to dig through my emails
for more and more info.  actually, if anyone promoting
these events and other techno parties wants to email
the list again w/ the info, that would be much easier.
 

also, folks should check out miss kittin at mezzanine
next friday w/ matthew dear and the ghostly int'l
tour.  i saw part of miss kittin's set at sonar and
she was great.  word on the street is she spins a good
deal of techno  and her mixing is hot.   (it was
definitely great at sonar.)  

yah, it's been hard being back in the bay after being
in barcelona.  i like being among my friends again,
but for me, the nightlife scene is just not doing it. 
i've been trying to go out more lately and it's been a
bit disappointing, though i don't really expect much. 
  the spaz party i went to was severely underattended,
which was a disappointment as i was really looking
forward to it, and the last few spaz parties i went to
(in the fall and winter) were really good, and made me
feel like a party kid again.  i went out to hear boo
williams last night at the top, and ok, i know it's
deep house, but when i heard him at rawhide several
years ago he was great.  this time it was just, uh,
really cheesy and not my cup of tea.  and not many
people there.  at least my househead friend liked it. 
there's not many events we can go out to together
since our tastes are usually diametrically opposed.  

is techno big in any other cities in the u.s.? 
(besides new york).  i find myself scouring the
internet looking for events in other west coast cities
and feel a bit pathetic.  i mean, i have other
interests in my life besides techno, but  i just need
a good night out dancing to keep me inspired
sometimes.  

oh, finally, philip sherburne, i tried to reply to
your reply to me about sf techno, etc., but for some
reason i can't reply to your email - it just comes
back failure delivery.  :(

Cheryl,

	Don't feel bad. I didn't interpret you to be saying Michael =

nice person. I was the one who thought a bad assumption was being made,=20=

when in fact it seems he and Steve were simply joking.

Global Calendar Change!



Let's Make the Circumpolar Rainbow Bridge!

Or if you don't believe in such things, another excuse
to go enjoy some time with friends on a Sunday
afternoon. ;)


Declaration of The Great Calendar Change of 2004
(To be read at every Day Out of Time celebration at
high noon)
On this Day Out of Time, White Spectral Mirror, the
365th day of the Thirteen Moon/28-day calendar year,
we, the people, are gathered in numerous celebrations
and festivals at sites around the world -why? Because
we are celebrating the Great Calendar Change of 2004.
As of the next day, Blue Crystal Storm, the first day
of the Thirteen Moon/28-day calendar year, there will
be a New Time on Earth. What does this mean?

It means that for the first time in human history, the
people of the Earth - not from one country, but from
many countries and diverse cultural traditions - will
be in support of and already following the new
calendar. The times in which we are living are
dangerous and complex. The Earth's future is in the
balance. The people know that things will not get
better until we are living in a New Time. There are
but a few years until the cycle of history closes in
2012. The people know this. The signs are everywhere
that the great standards are changing. A new way must
be found for the next evolutionary leap. We can no
longer wait for a Caesar or a Pope, a president or a
prime minister to issue the mandate for this kind of
change. That is why we, the people of the Earth, have
undertaken this change by ourselves and of our own
volition. It is reason and common sense, intelligence
and compassion for all of life that move us to make
this change. We know that the future is ours to
create.

In over 90 countries now the new harmonic standard of
Thirteen Moons/28 days has spread and is now being
followed. This is an irreversible change. This is a
movement that cannot nor will not be stopped. It is
the force of evolution itself. It is in accord with
the principles of higher spiritual evolution. It is in
accord with the transformation of our biosphere into
the noosphere - the unified mental field of planet
Earth. This is a cause of the greatest joy and
celebration. We, the people, know that by 2012, Earth
and all of her tribes and nations will be unified
under the new standard of peace, Thirteen Moons/28
days.

Though supported by the League of Nations, the
International Chamber of Commerce and individuals as
diverse as Eastman Kodak and Mahatma Gandhi, the
Calendar Reform movement of the 1920s and 1930s, did
not succeed. But its efforts were not in vain. It
prepared the ground for such a change. In the seventy
years since that noble effort, the reasons for making
the change have become blatant and glaring. The
disorder of society, reflecting the disorder of an
irregular standard of measuring time, is now worldwide
and epidemic in scope. This time the urgent call for
calendar change has come from a people's movement that
has already succeeded in becoming a widespread
planetary phenomenon. What seems impossible today,
will be common sense tomorrow. Such is the obvious
logic of a perpetual standard of measuring our time,
the harmonic standard of Thirteen Moons/28-days.

Henceforth, may this wave of the future penetrate all
sectors of global society. May those who doubt find
renewed faith. May those who stand on the side lines
wondering, jump in and find a new, unifying commitment
to a future of peace. We who make this change, do so
under the Banner of Peace, an internationally
recognized instrument for establishing world peace
through culture. For that reason this Day Out of Time
is also known as the International Peace through
Culture Festival. On this day we pray for universal
forgiveness. Meditating on our unity, marching and
dancing in rhythm to the New Time, we proclaim: Time
is no longer money. Time is art. May peace prevail on
Earth. May the standard of the New Time call forth
that day soon when our swords are beat into plowshares
and children of all races, colors and creeds are
playing and praying together in the sunshine of the
promised land whose time has finally come. May the New
Time of peace prevail on Earth!

from Australia to Oregon;
The Great Calendar Change of 2004,
The World is Entering the New Time!

"I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes 
me to tremble for the safety of my country.  As a result of the war, 
corporations have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places 
will follow, and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong 
its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth is 
aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed."
-Abraham Lincoln

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

  "I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of 
life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the 
beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club, 
party or other sound system that has ever achieved anything close to that..."
-Jeno, on the early days of Wicked and the Full Moon Raves

Subject: [sfraves] re: global calendar change

maybe i'm just stubborn, but i find myself irritated
as hell by the "New Calendar/Thirteen Moon" etc.
stuff.  sure, i like for us to work with a thirteen
moon cycle as opposed to the arbitrary months.  but as
a pagan, with roots in europe, i refuse to throw out
the seasonal and cyclical pagan calendar i follow
which is pre-christian and pre-capitalist to start
using a "new global" system with symbols i simply do
not relate to, and i resent it being pushed on me as
"THE" new calendar, and "THE" way to save the world.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] re: global calendar change

I kinda have to agree with the naysayers. changing the calendar just
means the Republicans are ruining the world on Tuesday instead of
Wednesday. if I were King of the Pirates I'd promise twenty gold
dubloons for every Republican head severed by one of my swabby
minions. yarrr. less whimsical fancy, more decapitations.

"I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes 
me to tremble for the safety of my country.  As a result of the war, 
corporations have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places 
will follow, and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong 
its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth is 
aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed."
-Abraham Lincoln

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

  "I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of 
life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the 
beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club, 
party or other sound system that has ever achieved anything close to that..."
-Jeno, on the early days of Wicked and the Full Moon Raves

"do you think that everyone will really pay?"
"no, but i am making some delinquent notices just in case."
"why don't you just advertise for a specific avenue of business, and then charge for your service? don't you think that will be easier?"
"no, i want to get payed for the whole thing, and if i make an ad, then the people should have to pay for my ad too, and i don't feel like doing any ads for anyone today." :)

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: UK GOVERNMENT REVEALS PLANS TO VACCINATE CHILDREN AGAINST
  DRUGS

--=====================_5197000==.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

For Immediate Release: JULY 26, 2004

UK GOVERNMENT REVEALS PLANS TO VACCINATE CHILDREN AGAINST DRUGS

Children may be "vaccinated" against the effects of cocaine and other drugs 
in a plan recently revealed by the UK government, reports the well-regarded 
British newspaper, <http://en.groundspring.org/en/go?j=5452812&u=35762>The 
Independent. The article explains that "Doctors would immunize children at 
risk of becoming smokers or drug users with an injection" and that the 
program would operate in a way similar to the "current nationwide measles, 
mumps and rubella vaccination programme." Further the authors reveal that 
"such vaccinations are being developed by pharmaceutical companies and are 
due to hit the market within two years."

Earlier this month, the US-based Center for Cognitive Liberty & Ethics 
published a relevant and timely report, which addresses the imminent 
emergence of these same "pharmacotherapy" drugs into the US market. Among 
other well-documented information, the report notes that the US National 
Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) has allocated $12 million dollars to Xenova, 
the UK-based pharmaceutical company running trials on the "anti-cocaine" 
vaccine mentioned in the article.

The plan currently being researched and debated in the UK is therefore of 
concern to those monitoring trends in US drug policy. The CCLE's policy 
report, "Pharmacotherapy and the Future of the Drug War" is the first 
publication to address the ethical and legal dimensions of this new breed 
of pharmaceuticals. The report acknowledges potential benefits if these 
drugs are used voluntarily, but warns that coercive or compulsory use of 
such drugs to "immunize" drug abusers or "at risk" potential users would 
violate a number of legal rights and trample the fundamental human right to 
freedom of thought.

Richard Glen Boire, a legal scholar at the CCLE, believes that vaccinating 
children with "anti-drug" drugs would be "alarming and unlawful, and would 
signal the first time that neuropharmaceuticals were overtly used to 
enforce government policy."

Aside from the human rights concerns, the UK plan raises serious health 
questions regarding the long-term effects of these drugs on the complex 
neurochemistry of the brain.

The CCLE pharmacotherapy report directly addresses the potential legal and 
health consequences of US implementation of a compulsory "anti-drug" 
vaccination program, which now seems closer to reality than ever before in 
light of the UK government's recent announcement.

Pharmacotherapy and the Future of the Drug War is available 
<http://en.groundspring.org/en/go?j=5452812&u=35763>here. Hard copies of 
the report are available for $30.00; a PDF may be accessed free of charge.

"oh, well, ummm, what did you say? oh, nevermind. just make sure you lift it and hand it over now. i can't allow you to attend to what i don't get anymore, when i think i am in charge. you see, i am like a tiny tyranny, although, i wouldn't call it that. just call me something affectionate and loving.

who's 'he'? and why is that so crazy? kids need to learn how to dance too 
don't they? i've never actally seen a dance class posted on "poping" or "house" 
before, but i've always thought there should be such a thing. i think this is 
great, assuming the dance teacher is not a petephile, i don't see the problem 
here with the starting age.

Hey everybody!  After 7 years or so, Audible Colors is
changing its name and broadening its horizons!  I'm also
joining the crew in promotional and booking efforts, and 
promise you many pleasant surprises in store. What WON'T
change is our dedication to bringing you the finest in local
and out-of-town DJ talent each and every week.  What 
WILL change is you'll be seeing participation from a variety
of new crews, as well as some tech-house, micro-house,
and minimal techno entering the mix along with the usual
bumpin' house you've come to expect on Wednesday
nights. Another reason to check out this night is that the
residents, Sammy D and Justin Martin, are not only great
DJs, but are extremely talented up-and-coming producers
with tracks coming out on Derrick Carter's Classic label, in
addition to their tracks already out on Ben Watt's Buzzin'
Fly, Utensil, Roam, & DHP, with many more to come.
These guys are hot and only getting hotter, ya heard?
Come check it out sometime, you won't be disappointed!

I was actually being self-referential. I wanted to keep everybody up
to date and let them know that while you all are doing whatever you
all will be doing I will be taking breakdancing classes with the
yung-uns.

actually I'm looking for something a little more in the grownup world,
which I may have located (but it's all the way up in SF, I'm in the S.
Bay). but I ran into a boastful East Coaster who had some dancing
skills, and being from the East myself originally it got me thinking
etc. if I get things organized properly, I'm going to take
breakdancing lessons and kung fu lessons, and unite the two skill sets
to kick the ever-loving shit out of Eric Zoolander. woot, and stuff.

and yes, I am a wild and crazy guy.

Yo.
 
I haven't been subscribed to this list for quite some time, but back
when I was it seemed like there were dozens, if not hundreds, of
messages each day.  I've seen about 5 messages today.  What's the story?
Are there still lots of people subscribed but just not that much
activity? Or have most people "jumped ship?"  I'd be interested to hear
from a long-time subscriber as to just what has been going on with this
list and where it stands today.
 
Thanks!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] a question about SFR

Seems like there are still a lot of people here, though the lion's
share of posts are from a handful of individuals ;)  There are posting
jags about this and that, some BSPs you won't see elsewhere, (some for
good reason) and good conversations, sometimes.

..and sometimes people get in 30-post-long strings about some candy
kids' spelling errors.

Same as it ever was, I suppose.  It's still a good way to stay
connected with new scene folk and what's going on outside the deep
underground.

Cheers,
George C

Subject: [sfraves] Carbon Community on 90.5 KSJS - TODAY!!!

Check it out!  Carbon Community and DJ Icon throw down.  Perfect warmup 
session for FLUX on Friday night.

-----------------
Bassline FM
Thursdays 2pm to 5pm on 90.5KSJS
Tune in online at:  http://www.ksjs.org/ksjs_live.html


Get ready for another high energy packed show this Thursday. Texas's own 
Dave from Carbon Community will be coming down doing a live pa performance 
inside the studio of KSJS . A live pa performance has never been done 
before, on Basslinefm.

As well as DJ Icon, making her debut onto the program. You may remember her 
from MTV's "The Wade Robson Project", an amateur dance competition 
television show.

These two acts will be performing at a party called Flux, taking place this 
Friday at the Shadow Lounge. Be sure to give us a call to get on the guest 
list this Thursday at (408) 924-KSJS.


07-29 Dave from Carbon Community, DJ Icon

Carbon Community

Two things are for certain. If you see The Carbon Community on a flyer, you 
can be sure that it will be a show like you have never seen before. 
Secondly, this is only the beginning for the dynamic duo. The Carbon 
Community has a sound that will propel them far into the future of 
electronic music, and will establish them as a pillar in the breakbeat 
world.

DJ Icon

ICON has been known for spinning a hybrid of Trance, UK Hard House, and 
Nu-Skool Breaks. She has a unique style of mixing these genres together to 
create a slamming high-energy set that gets people moving on the dance 
floor. Gradually over the past few years, ICON made the transition and 
natural progression from Four-on-Four beats to Breakbeat fusions. Currently 
she focuses mostly on all forms of Breaks including Nu-Skool, Funky, 
Trancy/Melodic, and Electro. However, ICON knows the importance of 
versatility so she still plays other genres of music when appropriate.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] a question about SFR

A few numbers for ya...

The highest list subscription base that I know of was in summer '99, ~1150
email addys

Today we are at ~425.

Which kinda jives with back in my early years on this list, I believe 
summer '96 was about ~450-500.

Oh and the above numbers don't include digest subscriptions.

SFR definitely ebbs and flows, it's certainly interesting to watch it over 
a long period of time. This list has assumed a number of different
personalities over the years. Lately it's been pretty chill, drama-free,
which I think nice. But I guess the crazy flame-wars this list used to 
have were pretty exciting too ;-)

Fukkkkkin sweeeeeeeeeet.

All I know is, if this party is anything in comparison
to the Euphoric Dreams party last weekend, All sac,
SF,  and everyone inbetween-downbelow better show for
it.  Old-school goodness is all I can say, coming from

100% convinced, but I certainly don't feel like arguing with you about

Subject: [sfraves] [SRR] Question for the DJs: Improving my DJ Skills

So I've been DJing for about 3 years now in the
bedroom (well actually the livingroom) and I've
finally gotten to the point where most of the time I
can do good mixes.  However, I note that when anything
goes wrong, i.e. my kids distract me, I have to go to
the bathroom, I've had one too many or one too few
beers, etc. my mixing falls apart quickly.  I'm sort
of ready to play for an audience but worried that my
mixing will collapse the first time I try.

Most of the time when this happens I find that I
simply can get a good estimate of whether the new
record is faster or slower with the headphines no
matter what I do.  Of course if I bring it in to the
mix I can hear its wrong and usually can adjust it
that way, but I couldn't do that during a live or
recorded set.  I'm looking for suggestions on how to
improve my skills on this point.  Anyone have some
suggested exercises that might help me work on these
sorts of issues?

I don't have great equipment (Stanton 80s, Numark
mixer) , but its what I could afford at the time.  I
got my headphones for free from a failed Internet
music company MusicBank.  I currently can't afford to
replace my equipment so even if that's a lot of my
problem I need to work around it.  Oh and my tape deck
died so I currently can't record my mixes.

When I started out I had a bit of money so I took
lessons from a great DJ and teacher friend of mine,
but now I can longer afford lessons.  So although I
know some folks on the list are providing DJ lessons
for money, I can't afford that.  I wish I could.

FWIW I play a variety of house styles, mostly SF style
funky house with some deep house,  tech house, and
progressive depending on my mood.  I'm interested in
intermixing, creating compositions with records, not
just simple blending of one track into the next.  I've
messed around a bit with mixing spoken word and other
weird shit as well with some pretty good results. 
That's what I'm trying to do anyway.

Any help will be greatly appreciated!!

Peace,

Peter

have a bunch of your friends get really stoned and watch you spin.  if 
you make any sort of mistake, no matter how small, they should point 
and laugh at you, and then throw things at you (pillows, balled-up 
paper, stuffed animals found after the last party, etc).  every once in 
awhile, one of them should come over and tweak your pitch slider at 
random, just to throw you off.

keep this up for a good solid year.  i guarantee you'll improve.

it also helps to have cheap Salvation Army bought belt-drive decks, and 
don't even bother with a monitor.

that's how i learned.  :-)

practice, practice practice!

record your mixes and listen to them...

know your music....

if a kid distracting you throws you off, then practice more....
you will get 100 kids distractibg you at a gig.

get a set of 1200's .... sorry kids, anything less: suck for beatmatching.
(not trying to open a debate about stanton vs vestax vs newmark vs technics)

but honestly, 1200's or some of the vestax are a must for consistancy.....

my 2 cents...
Gabriel

Subject: RE: [sfraves] [SRR] Question for the DJs: Improving my DJ Skills

Well I practice frequently (5-7 days a week for about
1 hour.)  Much to the horror of my downstairs
neighbors who are not into house music to say the
least.  I'm moving to a house out by SF state soon
where I'll be able to turn it up properly without
having the police knocking on the door.  The question
is what shoudl I practice?  

I've take to studying records, noting specific mix
points and so forth and keeping this all in some cool
little notebooks I found.  But even if I know the
vinyl, I still need to be able to mix on the fly with
something I don't know.  I don't want to fall into the
trap of memorizing speeds and  sets and so forth.  I
probably could do that now and play an acceptable setI
think.

As for the 1200s, wish I had the $$$ but I'll put 'em
on my xmas list ;)

Thanks!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] [SRR] Question for the DJs: Improving my DJ Skills

The only thing you can really do to improve, is play all the time. Every
chance you get. If you get too frustrated, take a couple days off and come
back fresh to it.

As far as having lame equipment. I have been the king of lame equipment the
last year. After my DJM500 died, along w/ my subs and amp, I was left w/
nada for almost 6 months. I could ONLY spin on other peoples setups, and
then rarely at that. Somehow - my desire to play ended up working in my
favor and I got better.  Equipment can HELP, but it does NOT make the DJ. If
you can spin on crap equipment, you can pretty much spin on anything.

As far as when your mixes fall apart - remember to take a deep breath, calm
yourself down, and get back on it. Pick a track you know real well, that you
can work in anywhere - use it to ease yourself back into the mix. It'll come
together again soon.

Patience grasshoppa!

Subject: RE: [sfraves] [SRR] Question for the DJs: Improving my DJ Skills

Hi Peter!

I completely learned how to beatmatch with a four year old next to me
the whole time. He is now seven years old and I can beatmatch in ten
seconds or less and pay attention to him at the same time.

 It also helps to have a mixer that allows you to mix in the headphones
so you don't have to annoy neighbors. Unfortunately for me, I got so use
to mixing in the headphones that the first time I used a "real" mixer I
had a hard time adjusting. To solve that problem I had to go out and buy
a new "real" mixer so that I could practice how to mix on a club type
system.

I'm still far from pro/perfect, but I love pulling off 2 minute long
progressive trannies.

I practice about 3-5 days a week depending on how much time I've spent
in the studio working on tracks that week.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] [SRR] Question for the DJs: Improving my DJ Skills

My other suggestion - which may sound like suicide to some folks - but helps
me TREMENDOUSLY - is find a buddy to bring over his/her records, and spin
them. You don't already know them, and you are forced to learn to mix on the
fly. You can see just how intuitive you are when you spin someone else's
wax....trust me on that.

It's a great way to practice!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] [SRR] Question for the DJs: Improving my DJ Skills

Or you could sell everything you own and buy new records all the time like 
me. lol j/k

Some of my most Refreshing (READ: FUN) sets have been the one's where you 
get home with new records and fly by the seat of your pants....

Recording myself is/was the best way to get aquainted with your music and 
critique you mixing.

In other words, fix that tape deck! (or go get one at a garage sale for 10 
bucks)

Go To http://www.GabrielBlack.net for streaming and downloadable dj sets of 
Deep and Funky Tech-House Madness!
Check out http://www.myspace.com/gabrielblack for self produced tracks
Visit my label http://www.Sierrarecordings.com
001 Gabriel Black with Jay Tripwire and JJVaas Remixs (out now)
002 JJVaas with EBE and Gabriel Black remixs (who knows when?)
And vote for me at the dj list! http://www.thedjlist.com/djs/GABRIEL_BLACK/
I've started renting out my Mackie Rig for small/medium sized rooms, hit me 
up!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] [SRR] Question for the DJs: Improving my DJ Skills

Another thing I used to do to help train my ear for
beatmatching is:

Take your head phones OFF.

Get two records spinning.

Have both records palying through the speakers.

You will be train wreking at first but try beat
matching by ear through the speakers not the head
phones. 

This will come in handy when playing live during the
third track. 

Hope this helps.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] [SRR] Question for the DJs: Improving my DJ Skills

I actually feel more comfortable mixing with my headphones off.
usually if I get a mix going where the records are like exactly
synched, I'll take my headphones off for a second and chill.

Marco's advice with the records you haven't heard before thing is good
advice. That's why you should always spin after record shopping,
without listening to the tracks first. (Except at the record store
obviously.) I also always listen to the tracks afterwards without
spinning, like over and over again if they're good tracks, but I'm
more into producing than DJing, so that's kind of an analytical thing.

But it is good to do that from a DJ perspective, too, because the more
thoroughly you learn your favorite tracks, the more completely you'll
understand their phrasing. Counting phrases is just like counting
beats, except like one level of magnification up. Instead of looking
for every fourth beat, you're looking for every 16th measure, etc. The
weird thing about phrasing is that it's much less uniform than rhythms
are. (Which is why creating a good drum loop is not the same thing as
creating a good techno track -- something I still haven't been able to
do.)

Anyway, the reason phrasing is good is because you want your
transitions to seem logical and ideally you want them to not even seem
like a transition between two records, but a transition between two
ways of mixing the same record. I saw a trance DJ actually who was a
master of this shit. He'd have two records playing into the mixer at
all times, and all he did was ride the levels and the EQ. Not how you
expect to see trance DJs spin, but the crowd went apeshit, and to be
honest I think he had a pretty good idea of music theory, because all
the tracks he chose harmonized effortlessly. Harmony and key
signatures are worth learning if you spin anything like trance where
melody is a primary factor.

To quote the much-hated Paul Oakenfold, "Keys are very important
because they fuck with your feelings."

Not a trance DJ myself, I'm just saying, credit where credit is due.

Phrasing is easy, just remember 4. Something major will(should if you
are producing) happen at every 4x4=3D32 beats or :1234:1234:1234:1234:,
fourth measure.

The human ear is expecting it and you should give it if you want people
to go ape shit.

I actually feel more comfortable mixing with my headphones off.

Marco's advice with the records you haven't heard before thing is good

obviously.) I also always listen to the tracks afterwards without
spinning, like over and over again if they're good tracks, but I'm

But it is good to do that from a DJ perspective, too, because the more
thoroughly you learn your favorite tracks, the more completely you'll
understand their phrasing. Counting phrases is just like counting
beats, except like one level of magnification up. Instead of looking
for every fourth beat, you're looking for every 16th measure, etc. The
weird thing about phrasing is that it's much less uniform than rhythms
are. (Which is why creating a good drum loop is not the same thing as
creating a good techno track -- something I still haven't been able to
do.)

Anyway, the reason phrasing is good is because you want your
transitions to seem logical and ideally you want them to not even seem
like a transition between two records, but a transition between two
ways of mixing the same record. I saw a trance DJ actually who was a

Not a trance DJ myself, I'm just saying, credit where credit is due.

Yeah just what we need is one of the longest running house club nights in SF
turning into a sleaze fest, just when they're starting to bring in quality
talent again on most nights...

Subject: [sfraves] BSP:  Evil Breaks presents...FLUX w/ Carbon Community Live!

Well folks, it's tonight!  I don't know what else I can say to encourage 
anyone to come.  If you caught the BasslineFM show yesterday, you got a 
taste of what Carbon Community is about.  Dave (of Carbon Community) said 
he'd light himself on fire to keep the party pumping if he had to.  Now 
that's commitment (or perhaps desperation, but I'd like to think it's 
commitment *wink*).

So anyhow, it's Friday, folks.  Get out of the house, drop five bones and 
listen to some breaky choons.

Hope to see some of you there!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] BSP: Evil Breaks presents...FLUX w/ Carbon Community Live!

the legendary Rabbit In The Moon had a guy who lit himself on fire at
their live shows, and I don't think any desperation was involved
there...just sheer manic funk.

I forgot this was tonight! this is awesome...except why did it have to
be the same night as Astral Projection?

ai, and stuff.

1. It's a transvestite - "guess the heshe" bar most nights of the week.. I 
didn't know you two were into that kinda thing.. but thanks for voicing your 
prefences.

2. Thursday nights rock the pawty for sure.. and no doubt it should not be 
turned into a some meat market.. but there is nothing wrong with a hometown 
hottie bringing it propper to kit-kat.. in fact I encourage all who meet 
this description to attend in large, scantillyclad numbers {|-)

3. Now if you can't dance, and don't appreciate what kit-kat has to offer.. 
then go home and shut-up.. otherwise.. see you there!

Okay, just so I make sure I'm getting you right here, I can't dance, and if
I disagree with your opinion on one specific night thrown at a weekly, I
should go home and shut up?  And you're telling me that because I go to the
EndUp sometimes I'm into transvestites?

Hey, the EndUp is a great place to find trannies and other things-

Has anyone seen CL spin recently?? I wonder how this show will be..
He is spinng with Todd Prophet and DJ Rendy Webb.. I have heard of Prophet 
(local I think eh?) but don't remember seeing him spin.  CL is currently at 
#6 on BPM and #35 on djmag so he is on my top 50 list.. his new cd is flying 
off shelves.. crazziness.

ACLU where are you? So does this mean a person playing
the flute in Central Park or a saxaphonist in the
Subway is now a fugitive? I don't think that ordinance
will last long.

It sucks that they decided to ticket the DJ, but it's totally reasonable
to ticket a club that's generating a lot of noise on the street. Nobody is
disputing that there was a lot of noise, btw:

It sounds like maybe the cop could have chosen a more appropriate code
violation to cite the club for. If the guy was cited for the wrong thing,
he'll get it dismissed. Obviously, playing a flute (unamplified, quiet) is
a lot different from a club that's blasting amplified music out their
front door.

Lol This thing is a load of crap. They should start giving tickets out to people that talk to loud. You guys ever hear anyone talk from like a block away?

to ticket a club that's generating a lot of noise on the street. Nobody is
disputing that there was a lot of noise, btw:

It sounds like maybe the cop could have chosen a more appropriate code
violation to cite the club for. If the guy was cited for the wrong thing,
he'll get it dismissed. Obviously, playing a flute (unamplified, quiet) is
a lot different from a club that's blasting amplified music out their
front door.

California-based John Tejada is easily one of the most productive
DJ/producers in modern dance music. While most of his colleagues work on
establishing a signature sound within one specific genre, John Tejada
works in all genres simultaneously. Whether house, tech-house, techno,
electronica or drum & bass, every scene gets something from this
multitalent, and Tejada manages to move within each field as if it were
his own. John  travels regularly around the world rocking dance floors
with his signature tech-house sound.  This night will be no exception.
This is what you've been looking for all  along but didn't even know it.
Trust us!

Dan,

	Don't worry, opponents of dance music will surely be making that 
argument. We don't need to make it for them. I think our community's 
role in this is to say, "Hearing music on the street from time to time 
is a good thing. House music is a positive social value. If they want 
to issue tickets, someone should be ticketing cops for giving out 
irresponsible citations." Unity against the anti-rave authorities!

	Thanks BTW to Apollo for posting this news, and also the excellent 
(and troubling) ACLU animation 
(http://www.aclu.org/pizza/index.html?orgid=EA071904&MX=1414&H=1).

Peace, love & liberty,

"I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes 
me to tremble for the safety of my country.  As a result of the war, 
corporations have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places 
will follow, and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong 
its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth is 
aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed."
-Abraham Lincoln

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

  "I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of 
life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the 
beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club, 
party or other sound system that has ever achieved anything close to that..."
-Jeno, on the early days of Wicked and the Full Moon Raves

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Review- Graham Gold @ 1015


This is much of a review but I did find Apollo's evil-twin brother.  I say 
evil only because I like how it sounds with evil-breaks.  Graham Gold was 
kickin' and it is so nice to get the dance step jacked back into me.. I can 
only wait for Criostopher Lawrence tonight. Graham played a 3 hour set.. not 
too bad.. the dude is like 50.. and still puts it down.. mad props to the 
lad!

The crowd was frikkin' weird.. in one room hip-hop hoochies, in another the 
asian mafia, a third was off-and on pretty good music but nobody dancing.. 
but the main room was en fuego!!  It was only really bad when the other 
rooms emptied into the main and everybody was all mixed up like bad raver 
soup.  LOL...

Argh. John Tejada... or Miss Kitten, Dabyre and Matthew Dear? Tejada's
been off on a bit of a deep house tangent lately, I think the latter
might be a bit more interesting.

Subject: [sfraves] Fw: [dcraves] awesome.

Stoned Del. student gets lost in Conn.

Associated Press
07/11/2004

A Delaware college student ate a bag of hallucinogenic mushrooms and drove
around in a pair of stolen cars before arriving, confused, on a mountain in
northwest Connecticut police said.

Paul Cunningham, 21, hiked to a nearby home Thursday night and asked to call
911, police said.

"I think I stole a car," Cunningham told a dispatcher. "I'm not sure."

Police said Cunningham, of Dover, Del., confessed that eating an entire bag
of mushrooms, "probably wasn't a good idea." He allegedly told investigators
that he had no idea how many laws he broke during a three-day excursion that
took him 300 miles from home.

A student at Wilmington College, he told a state trooper that he bought the
drugs in Dover on Monday, according to the Republican-American of Waterbury.
The next day, he went for a drive and twice got lost in Connecticut.

He told police he remembers taking a train to LaGuardia Airport in New York,
where he found a car with its keys in it. He's unsure where he went from
there.

"I once again found myself lost in Connecticut," Cunningham reportedly told
police.

After locking the keys in the stolen car, Cunningham allegedly stole a van
from a Southbury rest stop.

In Canaan, he decided to climb Music Mountain to see what was on the other
side, police said. Investigators believe the exercise cleared Cunningham's
head.

"I want to correct my mistakes," Cunningham reportedly told Trooper Andre
Roy. "In retrospect, this was a bad idea."

He volunteered a written confession, police said. He was arraigned Friday
and was held on $2,500 bail. Both stolen vehicles were recovered.
