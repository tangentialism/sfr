that is exactly the same attitude that limits a lot of the "ravers"
who go to SF parties.  If you feel that you can catagorize all the
east coast ravers as fashion freeks, your just closing your eyes.
  True there are problems with the east coast scene, but give me 
a Scott Henry, Wink, Frankie Bones anyday and let them rock your 
house.  Not to mention that there are guest dj's from all over 
the country and world that rock things up.
  Dont close your eyes.  As a former east coast raver thats
the scene i grew up with and i dont feel i have any explaining to
do cause i did.  
  its attitude like you showed that create the boundries we 
all live y everyday.

im babbling, sorry but this post pissed me off.

well Spun will be there , outdoors I think, but eMOK will be happening at Red
Light District on 1st St. It should be hot that day so you may want to go to
the party happening indoors.  Should be happening!!  The best part is that
its all FREE!!!!  So if you have nothing to do then hook up with some of your
buds and take a trip to Downtown S.J.  It all starts at 12:00(noon) and ends
at 9:00pm. See you there!!

I guess I didn't make my point sufficiently clear.  It's time to STOP
bashing the "other" whatever-it-is -- other coast, other style, other
scene.  Open your EARS.  The east coast has Josh Wink, Darshan (Essa 3),
Taylor 808/Prototype 909, Scott Henry, Dieselboy, and many many others.

The whole underground scene EVERYWHERE now is stale to the point of
being lame because people have stopped being open to what they haven't
yet experienced, and only rely on what they hear fourth-hand.

Open Your Ears, Open Your Eyes, Open Your Mind!

peace out

gee, didnt i just make a few people upset ;)

i understand exactly what you guys are saying, that no one should be 
closed minded about a lot of things, but perhaps i didnt make my piont 
clear, the philosophy "wishing will make it so" (which is what seems to 
be your point of view) just doesnt work. i think that at a time, both 
coasts and all countries accepted eachother for whatever they had to 
offer, but times have changed. wishing that everyone shouldnt be closed 
minded just wont work. already too many new people in the rave scene are 
closed minded, and refuse to expand their minds that there are other 
places with things to offer. (an example of this are ravers in the US. a 
lot of them feel that the best music comes from europe, and that anything 
from the US just isnt good. on the other hand, people in europe feel that 
anything from the US is better than in europe (not all the time, but as a 
generalization)). my point is, that they have closed their 
minds about the west coast, and think that we are still back in the early 
90s for a lot of things dealing with raves. if they dont want to accept 
the west coast for what it has to offer to the rave scene, then why 
should we keep on trying to force it on them, and be nice, and open 
minded? when they have already closed there minds. i've talked to a lot 
of "ravers" from different places...toranto brags about its jungle 
capital of the world or whatever...east coast brags about being up on 
european fashon trends...no one talks about the west coast...my personal 
opinion is why try to force things, and be nice to everyone, when in fact 
everything rotates in a circular motion...sometime in the future, 
everyone will be open minded, and willing to accept other rave cultures 
for what is has to offer, in the time being, forget about trying to be 
nice, and concentrate on what needs to be done for us here in SF...

and btw, i know that the east has all those lovely artist, but an artist 
doesnt creat the scene nor the attitude of that scene...

(what are the odds im gonna get bashed again? god, cant even express an 
opinion about something with out the PC police gettin on you ;)

right on - i'd *love* to see nigel richards spin out here. Scott Henry, 
Josh Wink (again - didn't you all love him while he was here?)...there 
are so many great dj's out there. But then, i've already had this

I couldn't disagree with this more.  You do realize that this is the
philosophy that has caused many of the world's problems.  "Well, since he's
not willing to listen to me, I'm not going to make the effort."  Jeez, with
this attitude _of course_ nothing is going to change.  Moreover, it's
stretching it pretty far to say "all East Coast ravers do so-and-so".
Stereotyping is not becoming of anyone, my friend.  This line of thinking
has lead to bigotry and racism throughout the centuries.  I know that this
isn't what you had in mind, but that's the way it comes across.  East coast
ravers are not East coast ravers.  West coast ravers are not West Coast
ravers.  They are all just people, each with his own set of values about
what is right or wrong.  I've met a lot of people this summer who were
visiting from the east coast who were every bit as friendly as people from
out here.

Instead of judging people by their "scene", try judging them by their
character.  

>if they dont want to accept 
>the west coast for what it has to offer to the rave scene, then why 
>should we keep on trying to force it on them, and be nice, and open

'cause that's the way the world works.  You catch more flies with honey than
with vinegar.  Your attitude is just as destructive as theirs.

i've talked to a lot 
>of "ravers" from different places...toranto brags about its jungle 
>capital of the world or whatever...east coast brags about being up on 
>european fashon trends...no one talks about the west coast...my personal

To me, the rave scene is _about_ being nice, or more accurately, respectful.
That's what attracted me to it in the first place.  And saying "just forget
about it, in the future things will get better again" is only partially
true.  Things don't spontaneously get better in this world, you've gotta
work at it.  And being close-minded to others just because they happen to
come from area of the country X isn't going to help things any.

>
>and btw, i know that the east has all those lovely artist, but an artist

And the attitude of a scene is never going to change if you don't help to
make it change...

that's where you're wrong. the dj's are not on the same tip - you also 
happened to be in one of the best/worst scenes on the coast. Baltimore 
has been hit hard by trendoids and shitty ('fiend') drug use. Most of the 
DJ's in the Balto/DC area are wicked and great people who are down with 
the scene. Ask anyone who is involved in some part of the scene directly 
who isn't a raver (promoters, dj's) and they will tell you the problems 
with the scene lie directly with most of the ravers. it's ridiculous.
Unfortunately it's one of the *best* scenes on the coast because they 
have amazing promoters who know what's up and throw parties to showcase 
*good* music, and excellent dj's who know what's up. people in baltimore 
have collaborated and hosted names the likes of mixmaster morris, the 
dust/chemical brothers, FSOL...it's almost on a par with SF as far as the 
*music* goes. Shame none of the 'listeners' give a shit about it.

For more information on Baltimore's (and the east coast scene's) 
troubles, check http://www.clark.net/pub/lovegrov/retina7/letters.html

it's in a hardcopy/online zine called Retina from Baltimore -- a great 
music resource.

totally - not all ravers in balto and the east coast are like this - but 
yes there are alot of assholes in the scene now (check neraves for 
current discussion of a lynch-mob-style beating of a shady promoter who 
ripped alot of people off). You just need to meet the right people. YOu 
liked your friends from there, didn't you? :)

     Man, you are so far off base here that it's not even funny.
     
     Sure, big parties everywhere are full of fashion poseurs
     *EVEN IN SAN FRANCISCO, I'VE SEEN THE COMPLAINTS RIGHT HERE IN 
     SF-RAVES*.
     
     Why would it be a nifty idea to have some of the East Coast DJs out 
     here?  Simple:  musical variety.  Yes, the variety is coming way up 
     here in San Francisco compared to when I moved here over a year and a 
     half ago, but it sure would be fun to hear someone like Adam X or 
     Nigel Richards out this way.
     
     And as far as what kind of tip these guys are on:  I know them both 
     personally, and they're just as dedicated to good music and quality 
     rave experiences as the movers and shakers in the scene out here are.  
     Adam and his girlfriend Heather Heart throw frequent free parties 
     where they give new DJs and live acts exposure.  The two of them are 
     good to talk to, have a real love of music (albeit they are 
     opinionated, but aren't most of us?), know how to put on a good party, 
     and are just plain kind and sweet people.
     
     Also, there's a fair number of transplanted East Coasters out here, 
     and frankly, we get a little homesick at times.  So, it would be extra 
     special for us to get a chance to have Nigel, Adam, Josh, Carlos Tera, 
     etc. out here.
     
     Laura

um, you know, not to sound mean or anything, but why do we need those east 
coast DJs here? i've been to maryland a few times, and the "ravers" there 
should be called lamers. to them, its not about the rave "scene" and 
getting along with one another...etc...but its about what fashon trend you 
are in, and if you dont dress like everyone else, or dance like everyone 
else, you get laughed at, and shuned. im sorry, but if the general 
poplulation at ravers there feel that way, then im sure the DJs are on the 
same tip, and my personal opinion is why have them here? let them stay 
there in their own concided(sp) world and think they are ravers.

is it persons like yourself that give the sf scene its reputation for not 
being diverse musically and somewhat repressed? sounds like it to me.

the coastal vibes are completely different. don't get down on one scene 
because you don't understand it or didn't get into the groove of it.

i think the east coast scene is better overall than the west coast scene. 
(pfffff house! ;)) to me, the music is way better out east...but you 
don't hear me dissing the huge house scene here, do you?  the vibe here is 
usually much friendlier 
and nicer, but that's something i think you can relate to the general 
attitude of the west coast versus the east coast.

Peace and Love everyone,
After reading the discussion on east coast ravers and the different
opinions on that issue, I had to mention something about my experience
with the SF rave scene.
I am originally from Chicago, been in the rave scene since 1989. I 
moved to California a year and a half ago, and been to many raves since 
then.
I met plenty of wonderful loving people that are hard to find these 
days. 
I thought this scene would be one of the most open minded scenes in the 
world, but again I found that alot of people who call themselves ravers
have problems opening their mind to new things, they can not deal with
people who do not dress and look like every one else. One of the main 
reasons I love the rave culture is the freedom and originality a person
would have. I enjoy fashion, and love to see how some people get 
creative with thier clothes, but again some ravers would not accept 
that because they think ravers should look a certain way.

The secound main isssue, is DANCING. I have not seen as many closed 
minded ravers in my life, having problems letting loose. If a raver has 
a unique dancing style, a lot of people would start having problems 
with that. Because, that raver does not dance the SAME. That raver is
threatning the JOHN TRAVOLTA spirit inside many dancers, then a very
common cute practice starts: people imitating that person, making fun 
of that person. If that does not help stop that person from dancing or 
leaving
the party some of the great ravers in history start bumping into that 
person to express the good raver attitude and may be the person would 
retaliate, then it is a good chance for them to teach that person a 
lesson in behavior by kicking that persons ass.
I would also like to mention the other bad element in the rave scene, 
CIRCLE DANCING. This element is showing the effect of subculture on the 
rave culture, people with gang banger lookS turning the sacred dancing 
experience into competition and trying to control the dance
floor. The sad part is that a lot of the first timers on the
scene, see that and think that this is how a raver should dance and
this is the attitude to have. Unfortunately, this is one of the 
deseases in the rave scene, I wish there was a way to block that 
element
and define it as an unacceptable practice. 
There is no certain way a raver should dance, being open minded and 
letting loose is the first step to achieve a sacred dance experience.

Sadly many SFR ravers were involved in some of these practices in 
Friends and Family, even that party was one of the greatest parties
we have had in a while, but there are few ignorant people sitting 
behind computer terminals.
Thank you all for taking the time to read this, and party with ya soon.
Tom

Just a note to mention that I have a huge BBQ Pit if it's needed for the Luau, 
If it's going to be near Santa Cruz, I really can't haul it to Monterey. I'll 
nee to know soon, that way I can pick it up. It's about as long as a mid size 
truck bed, and about 3 to 4 feet wide. If any one else plan on a rave-nic or 
something like that and would like to use it, let me know!

Okay, okay, I guess I oughta throw my 2 cents worth in here.  :)

>From what I've heard, especially in Canada, the scene ITSELF doesn't seem
to be very different all the way across the country.  It's ALL starting to
get overrun with poseurs and ppl whose main objective is to get just
totally fucked over on as many drugs as possible.  Here in Vancouver
especially, the larger parties are getting filled up with little twinkies
who can't comprehend that the rave scene has been around for more than two
years and get very snobby with ppl who are just getting into it now.

Unfortunately, it seems that the East Coast DJs are very unwilling to allow
other DJs into their "territory" as it were.  This saddens me, as out here
in the West we LOVE to have DJs from anywhere and everywhere.  Two
Vancouver DJs, Lace and Little T, recently went to Montreal and were
stunned by the unfriendliness of their east coast colleagues ....

I feel that I've been very lucky in recent months as I have been meeting
people from both this mailing list and from nw-raves, and with very few
exceptions you have all been completely amazing.  It reaffirms my faith in
the whole big picture.  :)

I have no solutions as to what to do about twits and tweekers ... if we let
them be and accept them, they'll groundswell and grow and take over, and if
we try to get rid of them or close them out, we're not being "open-minded"
.... it's a tough call.  I just try not to let them get me down.

I disagree:  In every scene there will be the ignorant and the educated.
SF is no exception.

I remember circle dancing back in Motown.  It was pure positive energy, and
all the kids were into it.  There was no frontin'.

'Rave' culture is subculture.. Isn't it?

I think most people who attend raves are free spirited and tend to do what
they please.  I don't think they will accept what they see the first time
as what they *have* to be like.  Have a little more faith in party goers.

HuH?

When I first moved here, I was a bit unaccepting of the scene here.  But as
time goes on, you will see that this scene displays qualities nowhere else
to be found in the world (of course with a few rough edges).

                     Dear fellow,
                I have to agree with you on some of your perspectives.
 I moved out here about 2 years ago from the D.C. area and the whole C.A. 
rave scene has given me a *very* realistic idea about what the whole rave 
scene is supposed to be about: unity, freedom of expression and just 
having a blast. I had only been to 4 or 5 parties out there on the 
East Coast, which were mostly around D.C.( Trax) or in Maryland. I wasn't 
provided with info. on which parties would be the best or the most 
undergound. I had to rely on the cheesy flyers that I could find at my 
local mall shops that would give way to all the $20 $ *UP* massive 
parties I found myself at. I did see alot of attitude related to who you 
knew and not who you were as a person.  I never made it up to the more 
hidden-underground parties that went off in N.Y. & Phili. so I don't 
know if there was a more positive vibe\not? The thing I've learned
from  raving out here has been to open myself up more, accept and love 
what I        opps!
discover and to accept all others from all walks of life.:). I won't say 
that one side of the U.S. is superior over the other. Perhaps the East 
thinks the same of us, you NEVER know. If all areas of the U.S. can teach 
one another something new and positive about the rave scene as a whole; 
we sure can accomplish alot. I see the East Coast DJ's visit out here as 
a learning experience. We would be able to find out if all our 
preconceived notions are true or if we just weren't looking in the 
right place during our stays there.  As a stated early on, I do agree 
with some of your thoughts but I would like to have the chance to test 
them.                          
                                    Reaganx

     Watch what you say ... some of those "ignorant people" behind computer 
     terminals may have very well been the guys putting on the light show, 
     or they may have been people talking to other ravers hooked up around 
     the world through Vrave or CU/See Me (don't know if they had that at 
     the last F&F, though).

Hello fellow ravers!    I'm planning to go the spundae rave that's happening
this coming sunday (at club DV8?),  and since I've never been there before,
I would like to hear from those who have.  Any opinions on the place, the
host, the people, music, ... etc.   would be helpful  

Thanks--------  James :)

I may be going out to Burning Man saturday night, arriving sunday 
morning, and leaving monday.  Will the price be $40 no matter how long 
one stays?  Is there any way to get a pro-rated entrance fee?

(I imagine the answer to these questions is no, no, no, but I thought I'd 
ask just in case...)

Anyone?

Dear All(Excluding Those Going To Burning Man)

	For those new the Bay Area, the events that will be happening dis 
weekend are Saturday Basics(Not My Favorite, But It's the Only Thing 
Going), Sunday Spundaes(I don't like supporting Clubs, but if I had to it 
would either be 1015 or DV8), this promises to be a killer, 
HOT(temperature wise) event, WARNING GET THERE EARLY, ELSE YOU WILL BE 
STANDING IN LINE FOR HOURS ON E, I ALMOST PUKED LASTTIME, but then again 
it did get me to the front of the line real fast.

	Whether you raving or not dis weekend folks, we live in one of 
the largest populations concentrations in the world, SF offers lots o cool 
stuff to see and do, eg museams, zoo's(a really good one from what I 
hear). So whether you are or not, go out and have fun, this may be just 
the weekend to experience Zomething(sorry Zime) different, so have 
FUN!!!. AS for me you may see me a Basics tonight, if someone would like 
to give me a ride I love to share expenses, otherwise you will see me at 
Spundaes. Later

Perhaps if all us Motown emigres band together maybe we can charter our 
own plane.

<ping> "Welcome to flight 313, non-stop service from San Francisco to 
Somewhere in Detroit. Please make sure that all unchecked weapons are 
safely stowed in the overhead compartments and all tray tables are in 
the upright position. The flight attendant will be shortly taking White 
Castle orders, where you will have your choice of with or without onions. 
Our in-flight soundtrack tonight consists of Underground Resistance on 
channel 1, a delightful Basic Channel medley on channel 2, and the +8 
Chiristmas album on channel 3. In the event of a forced landing, safety 
ropes will drop from above each seat. When you're at the end of your 
rope, hold on. Don't let go. Enjoy your flight, and thanks for flying 
Mothership Airlines."

<ping> "We are now at cruising altitude and the pilot has turned off the 
seatbelt sign. You are now able to groove around the cabin freely."

hey, it could happen.

Well Everyone I know is at burning man...Where I should be, but I'll be
leaving for either Trust or Basics about 10:30pm..I'm in Sunnyvale soooo if
anyone is looking for a ride to either one Let's talk. Like I said I don't
know which one yet but there about the same distance away...more or less. So
I can use the company....I really don't like going to places by myself but I
love the people and the music, I might keep to myself at least when I'm not
on "E", I enjoy being around the people and music even though I keep to
myself sometimes. Either E-me and let me know and give a phone number to
reach you or call me 408-738-4443...I know listing my number publicly is not
good, but I trust the people on sfraves....Peace, Love, and Rave-on.

Howdy!

        I've seen the messages of those going to Basics tonight - I don't
need a ride or anything, just thought I'd say hi.  A couple friends and I
are going to Basics later tonight.  I'm a rave "newbie", I heard about the
sfraves list from a friend and I've just been lurking for a couple weeks
and tonight sounded pretty cool, and it's close.  I know hardly anyone on
the list, figured maybe I'd meet some of y'all tonight.  I'll be wearing a
Rolling Stones shirt and black shorts - say hi if you want.  Have a good
and peaceful time wherever you go tonight =)

Ahhh! I just stepped out of a nice looooong bath and for once I'm glad I 
live in Sacramento! :) (A whole hour and a half shorter driving time!)

So here is Burning Man in my experience - I'm looking forward to hearing 
about everyone's perception of the festival.

My friends Carol, Carolyn and I arrived at about 12:30 pm Saturday 
afternoon.  Driving out to the site was an adventure itsself....you are 
surrounded by nothing but the whitish grey playa of the dried up lakebed. 
We feel like we are in the middle of a Mad Max movie or something.  So we 
arrive and the place is just enormous!!  It was a little difficult finding 
our bearings. We stayed with friends of ours who were west of the main camp.  
We eventually found our way into Centeral Camp where the bulletin board was 
set up.  Sy was nice enough to post directions to exactly where their 
camp was going to be. ;) 

So we check out the main camp area while we are there. There is a radio 
station set up and all sorts of theme camps circling the area.  The most 
interesting IMO was the art cars.  The famous shark was there and the 
fin mobile and one with toys glued over every visible surface.  

So then we head out to our friends' camp to set up.  We  can see the 
rave camp from a distance; it was about a mile away from central camp.   
Our camp had a circle of RV's and vans 
and tents and my friend, dj BioJeff was spinning some wicked tunes on the 
decks they had set up.  It was posh with tarps overhead for shade and 
all kinds of lawn chairs and drinks.  The best part was the company - 
about 30 of us all just hanging out.  Many were tired from Friday 
night's raving, so we did a bit more exploring.

In the late afternoon I came back and noticed thunder and lightning in 
the distance with a HUGE dustcloud beneath the raincloud.  The thunder 
kept getting closer and the lightening more vivid.  Everyone in our 
campsite started rolling up the tarps and the turntables and soundsystem 
was put safely away.  I discovered that my tentpegs I bought were too 
big for my tent, so we put in our icechest and duffelbags inside to keep 
it from blowing away.  It had two pegs holding it in place!  Well, soon 
it started to rain and the wind picked up and we saw this wall of dust 
closing in.  Suddenly it bore down on us and it was like we went blind!  
We all scurried into the RV's and tents as the 70(?) mph wind/dust 
pummeled everything in site.  It shook the RV back and forth and we 
were all just in awe of what was happening and going HOLY SHIT as our 
quaint little campsite was being whipped around. It was over in a 
matter of 10 minutes or so and everything was pretty much okay.  My 
tent was still standing (it looked rather pathetic, though).

Looking East into camp where the storm traveled, a BEAUTIFUL full 
rainbow appeared.  It arched over the entire camp and then a second one 
appeared above it.  It was like Mother Nature showing us her powerful 
forces then showing us her beautiful gentleness afterward.  The camp 
looked truely magical at that moment. 

Okay, so that night we went to the rave camp and checked out the 
Frequency 8/SPAZ/Gateway set-up.  Wicked was set up about 1/4 mile(?) 
away and it looked like it wasn't going yet.  Meanwhile we danced to 
some really different sounding music.  It was like jungle and spanish 
salsa style mixed.  I liked hearing it because it was so different, but 
I don't think I could groove to it all night long.  So by then the 
Wicked lights came on and it looked like they were in full swing so 
Carol and I walked over and heard that steady hard beat going. Markie 
was spinning and he just fucking ROCKED!!  I even remember what time he 
really took off - it was just before 1:30. (or maybe because I was 
beginning to get ExtrEmEly happy!)  Then Garth goes on and I must say 
the first part of his set really sucked. Then some guy knocked over the 
turntables right onto Garth!  Yes, you heard me correctly.  I'm not 
sure of the entire story behind that, but someone on the list will fill 
you in. So after that, Garth was pissed and his set really took off and 
he bagan playing some faster, trancier stuff. The laser was going too, 
setting off beams of light straight out into nothing.  A few times it 
hit me, "my god, I am raving out here in the desert in the middle of 
frigging nowhere!! WHOA!!"  After Garth came Spun who did pretty good.  
Nothing stands out in my mind that was exceptional.  By then it is 7:30 
and I'm danced out.  So we head back and I fall asleep in a lounge 
chair in the early morning sun. Mmmmmm, it was heavenly!  In the quiet 
camp in the morning, the music from the rave camp traveles far, so I 
could still hear some music as I went off into dream land. 

End of part 1.

Okay, where was I?  Oh yeah, Sunday.  It was really interesting to say 
the least.  About 10 in the morning, more lightening and clouds started 
coming our way.  Oh shit, we thought, so we began putting stuff away.  
We didn't see a dust cloud, though.  Then the rain started coming down 
and some of us frolicked in it for a bit til the lightening got a little 
too close for comfort. We scampered into the RV again just as the rain 
began coming down in torrents. This storm lasted quite a bit longer than 
the one on Saturday. We watched as puddles began to form around the tents 
and then HAIL began coming down.  It was about the size of Kix breakfast 
cereal. Finally it stopped and most of us stayed in the RV.  Brian 
McGonigle entertained us as he stomped around the campsite turning is 
Tevas into platform shoes with all the caked mud.  I finally went 
outside to squish some mud in between my toes.  It smelled like fish!  
I guess that would make sense, as the playa is a dried up lake bed!  

Then the fun began:  People everywhere were really getting into it - 
literally.  Lots -n- lots of naked folks and those with clothing 
covered themselves in it slipping and sliding away.  There was this 
Volkswagon Baja Bug that was pulling people in the mud behind it.  This 
one guy was naked and holding onto a rope as he slid on his butt!  New 
sport: mudsurfing!  I was boring and kept my clothes on and only got 
muddy up to my ankles....

An hour later me and some friends went exporing to see how the rest of 
the camp made out in the storm and to take more pictures.  Then we 
heard the powerful lure of a drum circle.  We followed the sound til we 
happened upon a huge group of about 150 people or so.  As we got 
closer, we discovered that in the center of this circle was a mud pit 
with about 30 or so naked people slithering, sliding and writhing 
together.  Combined with the incredible drumming that was going on, it 
was the most primal spectre I have ever seen in my life.  It was so 
mesmerizing and actually quite beautiful.  

At 5:30 that evening was the desert fashion show and we were lucky and 
got to be right in front to see everything.  All kinds of interesting 
couture from a little kid dressed as an eyeball to prancing drag 
queens.  Purple Tiger came out in an all (guess what color) purple 
velvet bodysuit, gloves, boots and sunglasses.  We all cheered loudly 
for him - he was magnificent! (bravo!!)

After the fashion show we went back to camp to rest up before the 
Burning of the Man.

We (Carol, Carolyn, Black Adder, Regan and I) headed over at about 8:15 
and already everything was changed!  
The entire centeral camp was gone and there were already thousands of 
people milling around in anticipation of the night's activities.  
The Man was standing in all his greatness with tubes of blue neon 
lining his legs, head, arms and ribs.  What a sight!  They "turn him 
on" :) every night, and he is like a giant blue beacon for all to 
see.  I guess they borrowed the laser from the rave camp (??) and 
it was flashing on the man and making neat patterns in the night 
sky.  We made our way to the man and were actually able to get 
toward the front so we could see everything. There was a drum 
procession going around the crowd, which surrounded the Man.  I 
couldn't believe there were that many people attending!  It looked 
like THOUSANDS!  This one guy had a jet car which was about the 
size of a small dune buggy, and boy was it LOUD!  Then we saw our 
Rasta friend, Vincent with his flame thrower.  Everyone around us  
thought he looked like one of the Ghostbusters with his orange 
protective suit and fuel harness on.  After much ceremony and just 
plain waiting around, the Man's arms were raised (great cheer from the 
crowd) and was finally lit.  The flames took awhile
to catch on, and for a moment, we were afraid the fire 
would fizzle out.  But Vincent saves the night by torching the 
Man's legs with his flame thrower. Only the left side of the man 
was doing any hard burning, the wind kept the fire from spreading 
evenly.  But it was still a spectacular sight with fireworks going 
off now and then.  Afer he burned awhile, the people began tugging 
on the giant ropes so he would fall to the ground.  They had to 
tug alot, and for a minute or two, the giant Burning Man danced!  
Poor guy only had one arm, but he was grooving just the same.  
Then he fell and the crowd rushed in to be a part of it.  We 
couldn't squeeze in, so we made our way to the Lingam sculpture, 
which was also to be burned.

Lingam is Hindi for a penis, and this sculpture was phallic in 
shape but the openings at the base and top of each "tower" looked 
like a vagina. There were lots of little penises swarming around 
each opening.  Well.  Before Sunday, you could crawl into one of 
the openings and look up into the sky.  The sculpture was pretty 
big. That night, the vaginas had been stuffed with wood and 
there were many nearly naked and totally naked painted up 
dancers who acted like little demons. It was really cool.  Then 
each opening (about 5 altogether, I think) was lit on fire.   
The smoke billowed out the tops like chimneys and once the fire 
really got going, fireworks inside were let off. It was quite 
impressive.  After burning awhile, the tallest vagina/chimney/penis 
(whatever you would call it) collapsed and it looked hella 
funny.  One guy screamed out "just give me 5 minutes!"   Then 
we went back to camp to rest a  little before dancing more. 

This is where I get boring. After such excitement during the 
last two days, raving all night and with no sleep, I was really 
exhaused. I guess I'm getting old...:( because I only made it 
til about 1:30 while Tracy was spinning.  She is a goddess on 
the turntables, I must say.  Much kudos to all you female dj's 
out there, while I'm at it! :) I'm sure someone shall fill us 
in on what I missed. 

Then we left this morning at around 10:30 or so. I was so damn 
depressed going home.  You know how you look forward to 
something for SUCH a long time and it finally arrives and the 
experiece comes and goes so quicky because it is so GOOD!  
Coming back to reality is sometimes a shock and it can be 
quite sad.  I've made a couple of posts in the past about how 
depressing it is to come back to the ugly "real world"  after 
raving.  If raving feels like a whole different planet, then 
Burning Man felt like a whole new universe.  It was an 
incredible experience I shall never forget.  I'm looking 
forward to more posts about others' experiences at Burning 
Man.  I'm sorry for taking up so much space and I hope I'm not 
being a story hog.  I figure everyone's story is going to be 
different.  I'm looking forward to reading them!

love,
Amy

anyone else here go to Basics on Saturday?
anyway, just got back to Santa Barbara after a weekend home with friends, 
and I was quite disappointed with Basics

first off, the building it was in was not noticeably ventillated unless 
you stood within 5 ft of the door to the outdoor chill area, but going 
outdoor was too cold, and indoor was too hot and stuffy, the fans that 
were indoor (once they were finally turned on) didn't help a whole heck 
of a lot..I saw a couple of people pass out because of this

my friend was pickpocketed at the rave..some money and rouhgly $125 worth 
of what he thought was exstacy, but we later learned after a friend took 
it, was probably sppe & cocaine ..not very pleasant expereicne for my 
friend, and his dayrunner is missing or stolen as well
but maybe it's just missing..his name is Shiloh, if anyone out there went 
to Basics and found a Dayrunner belonging to my friend, please e-mail me 
and I'll put you in touch with him..thanks

oh yeah, and the darn thing was $15 admission...just wasn't worth it to me
of course a couple of my other firneds made it more unpleasant for me..so 
maybe it was just them that has me in this mood

but if anyone out there who went cares to comment, please do
oh yeah, I understand Basics is a semi-regulary recurring rave..if this 
is so, have they used the same location before, the civic center in 
Concord, adjacent to the police station and municipal courts *joy*, the 
bulding just wasn't made of that many people to dance in with just a 
couple of fans circulating hot air

okay, enough from me
talk to ya later

    I give you many thanks for your *descriptive* post. I couldn't of 
said it better:). Once I stop telling my futon how much I love it 
and get some sleep, I will post all about my adventures in "Mudsville".
Have a good night sleep all. I l0ve youuuuuuu!

I just wanted to send out a great big THANK YOU!!! to both of you guys 
for making those laminates for the sfravers. I met so many wonderful 
people, including yourselves. My whole Burning Man experience, and many 
other's experiences, were greatly altered because they were finally able 
to hook up with their net friends. :) :) :)

(I was the one w/ the red hair camped in the tent right behind the V-Mar 
truck. Oh. Also, thanks for the shade. And the starbursts. ;)

	I've been lurking here for quite a while, and since I messed up on 
my chance to meet many of you at burning man, perhumps you could meet me 
vicariously this way.  I've also got a few interesting techno links, and

	Hmmmmm.......... Burning Man.  Now that I've slept and showered 
and gotten a stranglehold on reality again, I can wax nostalgiac about 
the cool weekend I had.  Amy's post pretty much covered the bulk of the 
details regarding the setting, the events, the happy atmosphere, and all 
the unabashed, creative weirdness.  I will thus spare you the bandwidth 
and just detail the highlights of my experience (great post BTW, Amy).
	My posse arrived at the site late Saturday afternoon.  Since 
there were a couple of non-ravers with us, we decided to stay at the main 
camp.  This was a good thing, cuz I got to see a lot of main camp stuff 
which I might otherwise have missed if I had raved nonstop.  It was also bad 
cuz I didn't find the SFRaves camp until Monday morning, just before I left--
aaaar!
	We went over to check out SPAZ and Wicked around 10:30 pm, but it 
had just rained, so nothing was going on.  That was a poopah.  So we went 
back to main camp and checked out a drum circle around a bonfire, where 
people were randomly burning things (like their clothes) and dancing around, 
hooting and grooving.  We watched firebreathers, dancers, nekked 
people, and marveled at the sights.
	My good friend Ain and I returned to the 
rave camp at around 1 am, where Wicked was going off in a major way. 
SPAZ, with its trancier sets, was pretty poorly attended, but nonetheless 
cool (I'm a guy who prefers hard trance to deep house anyday, but I also 
thrive on the energy and vibe of a really big crowd.  So, as much as I 
liked the tunes at SPAZ, the crowd at Wicked drew me in).  Unfortunately, 
Ain and I were so kaput from the day's drive that we just couldn't hold out 
for dancing that night.  We went back and slept to gain energy for an 
allnighter on Sunday.
	The next night, Burning Man burned, the lingum ejaculated fire (some of 
which 
landed on me and burned big holes in my shirt), and the whole tribal 
experience took off to the cosmos.  After many hours of primal catharsis, 
we headed for the rave camp to celebrate the fiery death of our fettered 
old souls and the phoenix-like rebirth of our new, free spirits.  Or, at 
least, that's what was supposed to have happened.  Whatever.  We had a 
blast, dancing like fools and meeting new, great people.  Except for the 
chilling cold of the morning, there was nothing to complain about.  In 
all, a fantastic, epiphanous experience.
	Oh, before I forget, here's a list of the most memorable events 
of the weekend:


	-Squishing my toes around in the mud after the mega storm on Sunday
	-The cute S&M couple, all decked out in leather, genital rings, 
	 a leash, and the submissive male of the pair, who was not 
	 allowed to pee unless he had permission from his mistress (she 
	 whipped him when he accidentally dribbled on her boots)
	-All the cool cars
	-Free exchange of drugs right in the middle of the main camp,
	 without shifty glances or nervous mistrust
	-Meeting Mutt&Jeff (Vince and Wayne) at the bonfire by Wicked 
	 around 5:30 am Sunday night/Monday morning, where I _finally_ got 
	 an SFR badge and HUGE hugs from those two great guys!  Thanks a lot!
	 The hugs were enough to stave off the desert cold until sunrise
	-Watching the sun rise over a 400 square mile expanse of flat, 
	 featureless, pristine nothingness	
	-Meeting Carolyn (was that your name? I asked you about three times), 
	 my first SFRaver of the weekend.  We talked at the porta potty about
	 Wicked, raving politics, the foul odor of the SaniHut temple, 
	 and other stuff for quite a while.  It made me mega happy.  
	 (To Carolyn (if that's your name): Thanks for the friendship.  
	 In case you remember me--I was the one who gave you starbursts at the 
	 porta potties, was wearing the shirt with the smiley, and who asked
	 you about women DJs in SF--drop me an email!  We can hook
	 up at a party again, where I can give you some more of whatever candy
	 I'm eating that's about to make me puke, and you can introduce me
	 to more SFravers!).
	-Leaving the playa on Monday morning, driving like madmen, following
	 a caravan of cars, each not knowing
	 where they're going, each hoping that the highway (and not a muddy 
	 demise) is somewhere out there, hidden in the middle of nothing



		Until next year (or the next party),

        So I'm back at work catching up on all the things I should have
done between Wednesday evening and today. Got home last night around
midnight from what was certainly one of the most amazing experiences of my
life. I only had 265 e-mail messages to wade through. I still haven't
touched most of them, but I managed to get up and be at work by 8:30, right
on time.
        What can I say about the Man? Well if you weren't there then you
missed the best party there has ever been. You can try and go next year,
but it will be all commercialized and full of the frat boy kids that I ran
into at the main camp a couple of times. Nope, you'll never get to be at
Burning Man '95, she shall go down in history.
        I have been trying to get the words stright enough to describe the
experience to people and it just isn't working, it was really beyond words.
Religious, or just plain spiritual is the best I can come up with. The
combination of all types of wheather, all types of amazing and interesting
people and spectacular music all out there on that new planet we colonized
for a few days leaving behind everything familiar. Well, I'll sit down a
write out all the events as I saw them later, but for now I hope those who
were not able to make recieve all the energy that this experience invokes
in me and I say next year go, no matter where you are or what you are doing
leave it, cause it will still be worth it.
        I've done a lot of crazy shit before, been a lot of places and had
some amazing experiences from the hills of Scotland to the Gobi desert of
Mongolia, but there is nothing on Earth like Burning Man. Peace, love, hugs
and all the happy shit eating grins you can get out of life.
                -Seth

P.S.- To those of you who were there I wish I had met more of ya. I was the
kid that did the sunrise ritual at the end of Garth's set and well into
Spun's....I don't talk much, but I love you cats anyhow. Vince, Jim and
Wayne you guys are the shit. Keep droping till you pop.

There's no doubt going to be a spate of messages like this - so
I'll try and keep this one on the short side. Yes, this is about
the Burning Man.

Lavonne, Diane, Niels, Rob and I travelled drove down to Reno, got
ourself a Recrational Vehicle and set off for the Burning Man. Before
we began the arrangements for this trip, we never really knew each
other (I'd never met any of the people I travelled with) - now we 
do - thanks to the four of you for making the trip what it was.

Anyway, the journey down was fun, if uneventful - watching the land
change, from city to hills, mountains, desert was spectacular; the
differences (not just scenic) as you travel the few hundred miles 
are incredible. Finally you reach the Playa, and you're not in 
Kansas any more - Black Rock is other-worldly, massive, and
overwhelming. 

At the camp, our RV was part of the WBL circle - we were a late 
arrival to the group, and I didn't really feel part of the grand
scheme of things there. Still, what they did was wonderful; the 
parachute was tied, the trampoline set. After everything was in
place it was a space to be proud of. All involved must have put a 
lot of work into making things happen, it really showed. 

Now I'll stop with the chronological order, and jump around the 
weekend, and my feelings about it - I still need to think through
a lot of the things that happened the last few days, but I'd like
to get things written down before they go stale. 

Both the (major) sound systems at the event did a fine job - good 
setup, good music. Saturday night was the only time I feel that I,
and the party, truly went off. On Saturday, I got taken up, whirled
around, and I'll probably land again some time next week. Wicked
palyed some of the best music I've heard; the crowd went off, and
when the sun came up, and the crowd thinned I headed back to the
RV after having one of the better nights in my life.

The only unsettling thing about the Rave camp, were the rumors of 
animosity between the two crews - no idea what actually happened,
if anything. Hopefully it wasn't a big deal.

But what made the weekend different, more than another party, and
something truly different. I think its hard to pin this down. It
may be the environment. When the lightning struck, and you stood
out on playa laughing at the rain, feeling the static crackling 
up your arms, you felt close to something - a moment of being truly
alive. It may be the freedom, suddenly your in a place where you 
can 'be' without any of the restrictions of society. It may have
been the people, a bigger collection of the freakier side of 
humanity it would be hard to find. Its probably all of the above
and so much more. 

The Burning Man was true experience - good and bad, it brought 
things out I've been having problems with, making me deal with 
emotions I've been bottling up. I feel different today than I did
before leaving on Friday. After a while, everyday reality is 
going to wear down the glow I have from this experience, but
hopefully I'll be able to pull something from this that I can 
carry for a while.

Anyway, I'll wrap this up. Thanks to everyone who attended, everyone who 
was involved. Thanks in particular to the people I travelled with, a 
truly fine bunch,

Same again next year,
Gary

Magnificent, rough, beautiful, scary, crazy, funny, erotic, HOT, DUSTY, 
and perfect chaos!

Thanks Neils for the plastic-ware!  

I witnessed th most intense storm ever.  Double rainbows, lightening that 
seemed feet away, thunder that made you whoop and scream in reply, and 
wind that reduced campsites to piles of nylon and mud.  Welcome mamma nature!

Aaahhhh...the silky muddy hot-springs. 

I found the dirt and the sweat to become sensual and sacred after futile 
attempts to clean off.  Comfort zone has been pushed to new limits :)

Wow!

Hey all...

Here is a post from the Burning Man mailing list....and my reply.  It is 
interesting to see how well us ravers were recieved in such an "open 
minded" environment.  I'm a little disappointed, to say the least, and I 
will forward any more comments from the burning man list to this one.

love,
Amy

No, I don't think this is a fair assessment/guess.  I am a raver and this 
is my first time at Burning Man, also.  We ravers have been looking 
forward to Burning Man for such a long time....we are very spiritual 
open minded people who wanted more than just a "rave in the desert."  I 
can't speak for all ravers who attended, but I thoroughly appreciated 
the diversity that Burning Man brought. I learned alot about other 
people, other cultures, different music and different mindsets. BM is a 
learning experience not just for the ravers, but for the non-ravers who 
came out to the camp and experience our community.  On the mailing list, 
sfraves, those who went talk on and on about how much they learned, 
experienced and appreciated Burning Man.  We felt a unity there with 
EVERYONE, not just ravers.  I was hoping that the non-ravers at Burning 
Man would maybe learn something from us as well.  I don't think we 
"eroded" anything, we have added to the richness and diversity that IS 
the Burning Man project. 

On the topic of BM becoming too popular:  I'm glad I had the opportunity 
to go this year before it becomes what one person described as "10,000 
people with  3 day MTV coverage."  I'll still go again next year, but I 
won't expect it to be like it was this year.  As a raver, we have dealt 
with the same issues of the discomfort of change, so I can totally 
relate to those who maybe don't like presence of more people and more 
"techno-pagans".  I always say that the only constant IS change. 
That's just my 2 cents for the evening. 

namaste,
Amy

Yes, Wayne and Vince, you two are just too teriffic!  Now I'm gonna wear 
mine (and my new nw-raves laminate from a fellow nw-raver) to every rave 
and sunset party. These don't look nerdy, which had been a concern that 
was voiced.  No, quite the contrary - these look really really **GOOD**!!
Now I can meet everbuddy that I haven't yet - Including you, Alex!!

I'm very sorry about what happened to you at Basics -- I have only been 
to one of their parties, but I think it was only the E that made it at 
all interesting -- it didn't seem cool to me. Definitely caught the whiff 
of thievery, and of that peculiar fear stench that only the most insecure 
of young males displays as bravado.

WOW.

What an incredible weekend. I just finally got home with all my bits and
pieces. (long story, I'll tell it later) I will probably put together a web
page with my whole long adventure as well as Wayne, Rusty, and Chris'
stories, with tons of pictures. but for now I just want to say a few of the
really high points. The feelings I had at and after the event, more than
the specific details. I could not believe how wonderful all the SFRavers
were, this is one hell of a group. Besides the incredible nights of
dancing, the time we spent during the days together, was just awesome.
Cruzing around the city, going to the hot springs, playing in the mud. Just
too cool. I'm glad everyone enjoyed the laminates, and I'm not stopping
until everyone of us has one. The hugs and thanks and love I felt from each
and every one of you, as a result of finally meeting one another was just
great, I can not express how I felt in words, but I still get goose bumps,
and kinda choked up, when I read your posts, or think back on it. It made
the work on the laminates worth it about 100 times over. Maybe 1000 times
over.

Thanks so much to all my new friends (at least new to the eyes, olds
friends to my keyboard and my heart).

BTW, I'm leaving town again in the AM for the other end of Nevada and will
be gone thru the weekend , so I will miss all your beautiful and smiling
faces this week. I will look forward to seeing all of you soon after that.

For all of you that I didn't see there, (and you out of towners), if you
want to send me an SASE, I will mail you back a laminate, or else look for
me at future parties, as I will always keep a supply on hand !!!!

Love you all,


Vince.

Of course, young females *never* display their insecurity through some
ruse. And society hasn't programmed such predefined roles for women
that are just as offensive as male displays of bravado. (And simians
will take flight from my posterior regions.)

Look, dogs will sniff each others butts, and people will do equally
silly-seeming acts in their own domain of action. Men will continue to
try defining themselves through social measures such as "bravado",
women through social measures of sexiness and good looks. And dogs will
continue to sniff and be sniffed.

It's hard to know where human nature leaves off and years of social
programming begins (e.g. Barbie versus GI Joe) in this elaborate mating
ritual we call life. I don't think it's fair to completely fault "men"
for their programming, 'cause when you look in the mirror, chances are
you'll see the results of going with (or against) that self same
programming for your own gender. Just deal with it, try to recognize
it, and move beyond divisive male/female fingerpointing.

Give us time. We can't put it into words just yet. :)
It was just too intense. Way too wonderfully intense.
I can *still* feel the vibe in the air. (Can you?)
I've been getting chills all day from just remembering bits and pieces.

Was definitely way cool. Although the burning man, performances, etc
were great fun, my favorite parts was staying up all night Saturday and
Sunday raving at the Wicked system. On monday morning, Garth was out on
the dancefloor and I couldn't help but tell him "Your set on saturday
night ripped me a new brain!" Markie and Spun gave me a good
trepannation, power tools courtesy of the purple people pusher.

Saturday night was powerful, weird, trippy, shamanic. I finally think I
figured out why almost everybody that I talked to thought Saturday was
so twisted -- Electric charges building up tension as a storm gathered,
then the release as the storm shot it's proverbial load, followed by
the transcendence of a clear and electrically neutral sky popping our
brains open, exposing a single huge, new, blinking eye staring straight
into the hearts of space. You really feel directly exposed to the
universe out there in the middle of nothing, a dry ancient lake bed --
doing like Jimi Hendrix says "watching the sunrise from the bottom of
the sea" ...
 
I was talking to a woman who mentioned that during the storm build-up
she raised her arms in the air with someone else and a spark passed
between their fingers. There was a literal charge going on out there. I
believe those physical effects boosted A wide variety of
AlreAdy-Altered experiences into new reAlms -- the brain's functioning
is, after all primarlily electro/magnetic. This accounts, for example,
for a certain long-time member of this list claiming the feeling that
some kind of Alien contact had gone on that night.  I personally
thought it wasn't Aliens, we just happened to be lucky enough  to be
exposed to the vibe of spAce itself -- and spAce vibe isn't human!

Perhaps electricity accounts for the person seemingly possessed by the
DJs, continuously harassing them, knocking the needle off the
turntable, and finally jumping towards Garth knocking both turntables
into his arms. Perhaps the Kook thought he was Don Quixote; a valiant
knight tilting at turntables instead of windmills. Even more surreal,
in the silence that happened after knocking over the turntables, people
were wrestling the kook away from the dance-floor and some cut-down
hippie just had to get into the guys face gripping his collar and
*shouting* "do you realize what you've done, you've just killed the
vibe!!!" over and over again. THis just seemed completely ironic at the
time, I imagined that the hippie  sounded just like the teacher in
"Peanuts" to the Kook, not exactly a PLUR way of dealing with 
psychosis, IMHO.

Oh, and Kudos to Geoff White and Moonpup for handling this intense
situation with aplomb.

After this spark of crazed randomness, Garth just harnessed the
increasing tension/charge in the air. The kook caused us to race
downwards on our emotional rollercoaster and garth took advantage of
our velocity to boost us back into the stratosphere when he kicked in
that very appropriate song "Get your feet back on the ground" (who duz
that tune anyways?) song... The roller coaster sped downwards again
when out of nowhere, clouds and a massive storm caused a sudden
downpour -- the crowd near the  stage without any instruction or order
(like a thousand ants gathering food) managed to get a big tarp over
the DJ booth and the party continued without a hitch. THere was an
incredible feeling of vibe and community as people huddled under the
tarp near the DJ booth, arms outstreched to hold up the tarp, fingers
pulsing to keep pools of water from forming and dripping on the DJ.

And then the incredible elation of the crowd as the storm passed  just
as quickly as it arrived, leaving a completely clear and starry sky.
Some of us wondered whether the storm had actually happened at all,
because everything seemed relatively still and calm and beautiful;
within no time at all, there wasn't even a trace of water/mud around...

I could go on, but I won't bore you... lets just say that Saturday
night into Sunday morning was definitely the best Wicked I've ever
attended, far better than any full moon i've attended, perhaps even the
best rave I've attended. Sunday was great as well, on par with some of
the best FMRs (unfortunately, it wasn't as well attended as Saturday's
party, perhaps because a lot of people were beat from burning the man).

PS: what's that song that Garth played -- very dark -- with some guy
with a gravelly low, evil-sounding voice saying stuff like "you are
mine, my children, hahahaha". This caused Gary Burns to walk up to me
and in his scottish brogue proclaim,  "This is the most evil, evil song
I've ever heard". It was evil, and cool too. SO what's the name and who
duzzit?

PPS: Hi and thanks to RV mates Diane T, Gary B, Lavonne W, and Rob O!

I thought for a bit about what I wrote earlier and felt like I had to 
explain myself. So here we go.
Have you ever had a dream that was so real and so intense that you 
couldn't really put it into words or write about it, but instead just 
held it in the back of your mind, lurking, for quite a while?
That was Burning Man, except it was *real*. Right after I got back I was
talking to someone and she asked me why I thought people went. I mumbled
some stuff about releasing creative energy and about getting reconnected
and balanced with the universe.  She just nodded and said that everyone
went for different reasons, and that those reasons ended up being the
basis for their experience.  Ironically, right as she she said this I
realized I went for one reason: Because I felt I was supposed to be there.

I tried to explain this to one of my friends before I left. She couldn't 
understand why I would want to go spend three days in the desert with 
people I had never met before. 
A big part of this experience is letting go of your comfort zones. Comfort
zones are things you are so attached to that they hinder your leap to your
next level of being. They can be material, people, places, anything. Once
you remove these comfort zones (which I guess can include your daily
facade) you get down to who you really are. And when you're surrounded by
a bunch of people who are getting down to who they really are, it can be
quite an experience. :)

In the words of Kurt Vaughnagan, "We are who we pretend to be, so we 
better be damn sure who we're pretending to be."

I think this whole weekend shook the foundations of a lot of people, and, 
if nothing else, "It was one hell of a party." :)

Thanks to everyone who came out to our party this weekend!  It was fun 
and exciting.  We made $150 for our speaker fund.  I played first and 
then Gil came on for awhile then followed Tim McKnew and Josh and Sabin 
and DJ Stonie.  I'd especially like to thank Gil for coming from San 
Francisco and Jacob from SF too!  
If you ever ssee these djs at a party make sure to thank a lot of these 
play for freee so sound systems like ours can have aprties.  There are a 
lot of the renegades out thtere that everyone does for free so make sure 
to support those cheap/free parties with verbal and physical support I 
know it feels really nice to get a compliment on a party when you;'ve put 
a lot of work into a prty and all you really want is for someone to say I 
had a really good time!
Thanks again to everyone who came out love drenalin

Saturday night's Wicked at Burning Man was above and beyond the best rave 
I've ever been to, or heard of for that matter.
Interesting. Notice the word "rave" instead of "party". 
I did some thinking on the drive back about how people have switched to 
calling them "parties" instead of "raves". Sure, a party is more socially 
acceptable to those who aren't familiar with the idea of raving, but 
doesn't the connotations of the word kind of fit in with the change that 
most of us have noticed/commented on over the past year or so?
Raving incorporates a lot more meaning than partying does.
Partying is going out, getting fucked up (or not) and having fun.
Raving is all of that, and more. It's about finding yourself and 
perhaps others in the process. It's about the vibe. About PLUR. About 
energy. About letting it all go and just DANCING!!! 
A whole lot in one little word. In my own opinion, anyway. 
I'm curious if anyone else sees any relation. Comments?

                    Groovy now that I've regained some natural reality again,
     I can spill my heart out about my BM experience. First I have to say 
that this has to be the best time of my life by far:). Not only did I 
meet alot more of you Beautiful SF ravers( thanks a bunjch to Vince and 
Wayne) but I meet soo many others that really didn't have a whole lot to 
do with the Rave scene, which broadened the whole experience:). Black 
Adder, Micheal "E." Clay & I arrived on the playa @ 5-6 P.m Saturday 
after going through one hell of a rain storm which gave way to a lovely 
double rainbow! After making it to the main camp after much troubl with 
that piece of shit bike:(, I begin to slowly melt into the community that 
would be ours for the next 3 days. A wave of emotion washed over me as 
tears of genuine joy and relief ran over my face. It was overwelming to 
see all of these people just having the times of their lives, running 
about like little chilrdren on their desert playground. I saw many sights 
that could out do the 7 wonders like that shark-shaped car and the bunny- 
motorcycle. We arrived at the Rave camp were we set up camp. Even though 
the camp was a bit away from all the action in the main I definately felt 
more settled and safe there. 
         One of the things I had been hearing about over and over again 
was the awesome hot springs which I was finally able to get to On Sunday 
morning. Holly shit!.they were  Heaven:):):). with some kind of funky 
smell to em'. That nite came the long awaited burn of the man. As people 
chanted the infamous " Burn the fucking man" a huge circle of tribal 
cladded people danced around the blue and pink neon man. At laast the 
moment came as you could feel a sheer sense of excitement and unity 
ripping through the crowd to bring the man to his knees. Due to the weird 
direction of the wind the right arm and side just wouldn't burn that is 
until Vince and his trusty flame - thrower finished of the job. Everyone 
went completely bizerk. Oh it was sooo fucking awesome!!! Then I beleive 
the man's Phallics(right?) were but to ashes.
          Soon our little group retired back to the Rave camp where some 
of us snoozed and some tore it up over at Wicked and Gateway. I did hear 
of a little tension between the two groups; but thought that both had 
ALOT to give to us Dancing fools. I spent most of my time over at Wicked.
Garth did an incredible job:). I wasn't there for the falling of the 
turntables; was that some wacky part of the festivities?:). I was 
energized for hours and hours. I got to meet the PURRFECT Purple Tiger. 
AHHH you cute Dear!!!
          AHHH shit I see that I am staring to run out of time and I 
din't want to take up to much more room here. I could write a book on 
what I went through at BM, I'll just save that for later! Before I went 
to Bm, I was dealing with  a few personal issues that after BM I feel 
that I have truly and realisticly come to terms with. I tell you it is 
going to take a *LONG* TIME for this glow to go away. I feel more at 
peace with myself now. I'll definately go again next year. Whether it 
will be "better" or not then; I'll never forget this whole 
thing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
                        Much love to all of you guys and gals.
                        See ya all soon
                        Hugs Galoooreeeee,
                        Reagan

I think the line is actually

which would be

  "Where's Your Child" by Bam Bam

  Hey guys.. I know this isn't rave related, but it's interesting.
As many of you know, the "Church of Scientology" is attempting to
control information on it that former members have exposed and
posted to Usenet.Their campaign has included threats and siezures
of peoples computer equipment.. (they claim their mind-control
techniques are "trade secrets") Here is a press release I read on
com-priv. There is a web page at http://www.xs4all.nl/~fonss that still has
a lot of information on the struggle on it.. It makes interesting
reading.

        PRESS RELEASE
        -------------


    Police and members of Scientology church enter offices of XS4ALL
    ================================================================

Amsterdam - thuesday september 5, 1995.

Today at about 14:00, XS4ALL was visited by Mr. S. Braan,
bailiff. He was acting on behalf of the Religious
Technology Centre, better known as the Scientology Church, or
Scientology for short. He was assisted by a local police officer and Mr.
Hermans from the 'Nauta-Dutilh' legal firm that represents Scientology
in The Netherlands. Also present were two computer experts (Mr. Ootjes
and Mr. Van Suchtelen) a locksmith (to enter had we not been present) and
two American employees of Scientology, Mr. Weightman and Ms. Jenssen.

Scientology is filing for seizure of XS4ALL's computer equipment. Under
dutch law, this means that a bailiff comes in to record your assets. In
real-life, the computer-experts that were present have recorded the
types and serial numbers of all the computers in our offices. They did
not take any equipment, the continuity of XS4ALL's services is not in
jeopardy.


What is this all about?
-----------------------

The Scientology Church claims that the XS4ALL anonymous remailer was used
to disseminate documents over the Internet to which the church holds the
legal copyright. This has led the church to ask the president of the
district court of Amsterdam to grant permission for this seizure as a
prelude to legal procedures concerning damages suffered by the church.
The remailer in question has been disabled more than 2 months ago.

During the visit of Scientology to XS4ALL this afternoon, the remailer
was not the subject of any conversation. The organisation seemed totally
preoccupied with the information about Scientology that one of our users
has put on his home page. Part of this information is said to be a file
to which Scientology holds the copyright. If we were to delete the file
in question on the spot, they were willing to drop the seizure.


Responsability of Internet Providers
------------------------------------

XS4ALL categorically denies any responsability for contents of users'
homepages. The users decide for themselves what is on their homepage.
Since XS4ALL does not edit the homepages and has no mechanism of
control over the contents we strongly feel that the users themselves are
responsible for what they say on their homepage.

This whole affair demonstrates the need for clarity concerning the legal
postion of Internet Providers. We are shocked that our offices can be
invaded bij freshly flown-in U.S. cult members. If we as Internet
providers are held responsible for what our users say, that will
undoubtebly kill freedom of speech on the net.


Scare-tactics
-------------

XS4ALL is not alone in receiving this kind of attention from
Scientology. Scientology, a semi-religious multinational, is at war with
a number of people on the Internet. A non-organized group of people on
the net has started to openly discuss the activities of the church.
Until recently, the church has always managed to supress critical voices
by means of sheer intimidation and by engaging in endless legal battle.

One of the people that Scientology has a problem with is 'fonss', an
XS4ALL user that publishes the F.A.C.T.-net Kit on his home page
(http://www.xs4all.nl/~fonss). This kit (which can be found on numerous
homepages all over the Internet) consists of a large number of documents
that show the true face of Scientology.

One of these documents is a piece to which Scientology supposedly holds
the copyright and which has been added to the kit without the church's
permission.

unfortunately, although 'raving' connotates that to you and me it has 
come to mean different things for people. i use the word 'parties'. 
because 'raves' is a bastardized word. and the connotation of 'raves' for 
some people (most people who aren't into raving and yet have heard of 
them) 'raves' = getting fucked on drugs. alot of people thought this at 
first, and it wasn't true. then alot of new ravers came into the scene 
(keep in mind, now i'm talking east coast, which is where i'm from. there 
are paralells between scenes but i'm speaking from my own experience) who 
heard 'raves' = getting fucked on drugs and made it true. in alot of 
cases (see our Baltimore discussion from last week) 'raves' now = getting 
fucked on drugs. people who originally went to raves for their own good 
consciousness-expanding/enlightened reasons saw the negative pr 'raves' 
were getting and dropped the word. too many negative connotations to 
bother with. i hope all this makes sense - nowadays I reserve 'raves' for 
very special parties that have that certain vibe and feel and look and 
sound...Friends and Family is a *rave*...most everything else i've been 
to in the past year have been just parties, unfortunately.

  If you are a SFraver who also does World Wide Web related stuff
professionally, please drop me a line at "chris@ncafe.com" 

 Would people be interested in setting up a web page of
people who offer these services? (sort of an internal referral service..)
I'd be glad to do the work.. I might even be able to offer a referral 
from time to time..

There are quite a few of us, arent there!?

For people who are interested in this, the usenet group
alt.religion.scientology talks a lot about this.  It is more
anti-scientology than for, for the most part.  There is also a good web
sight that talks about a lot of the "church's" practices and secrets,
http://www.amazing.com/scientology.  Scary shit.

For the record, everything's that ever been posted to SFRaves can be 
found at 

http://www.hyperreal.com/raves/sf/archives/

They're in regular mailbox format, so download it and read it using your 
favorite mail reader (i.e. "pine -f sfr.9506", etc).  Instead of putting 
a Hypermail front-end on it I'm considering implementing it as a 
hyperreal-specific newsgroup - more on that later if I can pull it off :)

hiya :)

The experience of Burning Man evokes a bastardization of a Ram Dass quote:

"To those of us that experienced it, no explanation is necessary..
 To those of us that didn't, none is possibe..."

>From last year I remember that it took at least a week to *process* the
experience before I could attempt to describe the intangibles within 
Burning Man. This year I assumed that it should be easier. In fact, it's
more difficult as both events have melted into one, even greater wonder.

To those of us that shared the experience... be still, and know.

love to all

Agreed.  The music, the vibe, and of course, the SOUND...all were
incredible.  I can honestly say that Wicked's presence was half the reason I
attended, and I wasn't dissapointed in the least...

Dancing in the desert Saturday night with all those ppl, surrounded by
lightning was perhaps the most intense experience I've ever had.  I'm still
having trouble actually finding the words to describe it.

Many, many thanks to the Wicked crew for putting on such a show, and also
the other DJs like Jane, Spooky, Spun, Tracy, etc. who also delivered great
sets.  Thanx especially to Markie for not giving in Monday morning and
keeping the music going, despite the complaints of one man - what did the
newsletter say? "If your need for quiet is absolute, bring earplugs."  Next
time, we'll have to devise a way to keep the unwanted away from the system,
so they don't lift the needle off the record like they did to Spun or pull
various plugs...

Just a little shout out to all those I met at BM, including Amy, Blackadder,
Reagan, Vince, Seth, John and anyone I might have inadvertantly left out.
It was great finally meeting all of you in person, altho I must say I wasn't
really in the proper frame of mind for conversation most of the time :(
Sorry there were so many I didn't get to meet...I was actually just outside
your campsite with the big parachute on Saturday, planning to drop in and
say hi, but saw the huge black clouds racing toward us and had to boogie
back to my campsite to secure everything.  No matter, tho...from what I've
seen of SF ppl, I'll be heading down there as soon as possible!

Wicked was great... but let's not forget the other guys... John Carel, 
Minor Minor, Rigatoni etc.. who really went all out as well. 
Especially Friday nite when the Wicked area was downright dead...they 
were fuckin great :)

This was the fourth year I've come to the Burning Man.

It's been strange to watch it change.  The first year I came, there
were about 3-400 people, and the concept of everyone having a meeting
to figure out what was going to happen still worked.  Everyone helped
raise the Man, and everyone sort of knew each other.  The "rave" was
some people with two DAT players and a sound system.

The ritual of the burning was central; there was very little else
of any scale happening.

Over the years, it has roughly doubled in size each year, and the 
manifestations of chaos have grown quickly.  More people, doing more
stuff, and the character has changed.  It is still a TAZ of tremendous
magnitude, but the burning is almost anticlimactic, just another
spectacle amidst the crowds of Bud-swilling jocks who don't understand
why people who aren't 300 pounds and carrying a nightstick get to tell
them to move out of the way or they'll get killed by an M-100.

The Burning Man is an amazing thing, as always, but I miss what it was.
I miss being able to dance madly around the fire without needing security
to keep the crowds from trampling each other into the ashes.  I miss
the feeling of community, where the organizers don't have to spend all
their time worrying about people injuring themselves or others.  I miss
not seeing Nevada police on the playa.  Most of all, I miss that sense
of unity and purpose, where the Man burns for all of us and not just as
another distraction for the beer-swillers wandering around looking
for "nekkid chicks".  It was beautiful, and I miss it.  I'm not even sure
I'll go next year.

OTOH, it is still a beautiful experience for a lot of people, and I can't
think of anything that can be done differently (except having less bad bands
on center stage and bringing back the "No Spectators" sign).  Everything
good eventually gets overrun by consumers; enjoy it while you can and don't
be a passive consumer yourself.  I'm glad it's as cool for people now as it
used to be for me.

PS:  There is great antipathy amongst the organizers for the rave camps; 
evidently a lot of people tried to get in without paying, claim that they
were "setting up the sound system", etc. in much greater numbers than the
rest of the populace.  $40 seems like a lot, but _each_ porta-potty is about
$100 _a day_ (x 3 days, x at least 40 of them, you do the math), there are 
BLM land use fees, *insurance*, and The Man (materials
alone run several thousand).  BM has _never_ made money, and that's including
the fact that no one is paid for their time constructing, planning, cleaning
up, or anything else.  They have turned down many offers of corporate
sponsorship (from Bud, etc.) in order to maintain integrity in the face
of lack of cash.  It looks bad when people in an big and obviously rented
vehicle claim they can't come up with money.  (Note: I don't know who
this was, or care: I just know it happened.)
	The second problem they have stems from, yes, the noise.  Even being
2/3 of a mile away doesn't make much difference to the Purple People Pusher,
and they feel that one small group having such a huge impact on the sound-
scape of the festival, especially all night, is out of balance with the rest
of the performances, installations, and other events.  There is serious talk
about not sanctioning a rave camp at all next year, in which case I would 
suggest Wicked/SPAZ/whoever do their own event out there.  It sounds like
most people spent most of their time at the rave camp anyway, and it would
certainly save $ for the attendees.

I do not necessarily share these views, but I think people should know
about what's up and why.

Funny...I read a post here on SFRaves that stated, and I paraphrase"...if 
you didn't make it to bm this year then you're outta luck...next year 
it'll be full of [stereotype here] and all commercialized..."  what 
struck me about this persons statement was that it was probably HIS first 
burning man, and probably never thought how the bm pioneers might look at 
he/she being new, or how the scene had changed for a bm pioneer.  Just 
shortsighted I guess.  In any case, sad but true g-man, things change, as 
do times.  What was once intimate is now overexposed, what was a family 
is now a loose coly connected community.  I don't know what the cure is 
other than some form of elitist behaviour.  SHort of that, Bud & Miller 
Lite will probably have the last sya, that is, if MTV doesn't do one next 
year.

I am sorry I didn't get a chance to go, but as the stories, both good and 
bad filter in, I know I had a good time staying here in SF for that 
weekend.  I am thankful though, that ALL of my friends had a good time 
(those who went anyway), and most importantly, they came back alive.

BM next year?  I dunno...after all is said and done, I would probably do 
just as well to buy some records...

Was it all that?  I guess I'll wait till next year to see.

Seems to me that this antipathy is wholly unwarranted.  Did not the
newsletter itself promise "72 hours of non-stop music" or something along
those lines?  They knew the music would be non-stop, or at least those who
bothered to read the whole thing knew it, and that's the reason the rave
camp was set up so damn far from the main camp.  We were all informed that
BM is first and foremost a party, and everyone knew from the start where the
rave camp was going to be set up - speakers were pointed away from the main
camp, except for the far east fringes, which might have caught some sound
from the Wicked camp.  Besides, many, many more ppl than just those staying
in the rave camp attended and danced and partied, and were resposible for
leaving a vast number of beer bottles and various other shit about when they
retired to their own camps for the night - shit which many of us spent time
cleaning up.  I would venture to say that the vast majority of us did pay,
and in return I think we deserved a few more than the *3* porta potties that
they provided for the rave camp.  And another thing, why did ppl show up
bitching and whining about the sound at 9am?  Wouldn't it have been a bit
wiser to head over at say 3 or so and ask that something be done?  As for
not sanctioning a rave camp next year...would it really be that hard to work
it out so that noise wouldn't be a problem?  Perhaps put the rave portion
downwind, a bit further away, and face the speakers totally away from the
main camp?  I think the rave community brought alot of diversity to the
event, and it would be a shame to see it go...

...

Agreed.  There was noise *everywhere* at night, with a couple sound systems
set up around the main camp as well, so to blame the rave camp for noise is
just silly.  If there were people who tried to get in for free that's 
another thing.

The entire camp caught quit a bit of sound from Wicked.  When it got later
and the wind died down Wicked could be heard from anywhere in main camp.
Next year, they should point it totally away from the main camp and have it 
down wind because it did totally rule the soundscape of the main camp late at
night.

>I would venture to say that the vast majority of us did pay.

Yes, but I myself saw a group of over thirty ravers totally tie up
the gate for quite awhile trying to get in for free. (I myself, with 
paid tickets, could not even get to the gatekeeper for 1/2 hour while 
he tried to deal with them. 

I also would hate to see rave camp go. I had a great time and want to be
able to have the option to rave again next year.

I have a friend who has had a great time for the past three years wondering
around and telling people how it's going to be the last great year for BM.
I think it will continue to be wonderfull, it will just change each year.

Just to set the record straight, the Rave camp was directly south of the
main camp on a vector of 180, the speakers for wicked were pointed
at a heading of 140 degrees so they were not pointed at the main camp
in any way, shape or form, the Purple Turbo Sound system is designed
to extrtemelyu efficient and the Subs are designed to radiate Bass,
IN ALL DIRECTIONS, Indeed you could hear the sound system from the
hot springs three miles away. You would have to move it about 7 miles away
or more to achieve complete isolation.

Yeah, it was very unkool to try and not pay, especially when the money goes
to making sure that people are safe and cared for.  I know of a couple of
people who tried not to pay and I don't have a lot of respect for them.

     After reading Grigsby's BM post and speaking w/a person who is 
     involved w/BM paraphanalia (who also has some connections w/the 
     organizers), it is true that there may not be a Burning Man next year. 
     
     Evidentally there were far more injuries and incidents this year than 
     the past...partly due to the larger number of attendees and the 
     attraction media gave the event.  The law enforcement presence did not 
     help either.
     
     I asked if the organizers might want to make a incident report on the 
     net so we can see what is influencing them to think about not hosting 
     the event next year.  For those who attended, I think we need to think 
     about what the intention of the Burning Man is not only for us but 
     from it's original conception.  I asked to be kept abreast on their 
     decision and I mentioned that I'd compile the pertinent sfrave posts 
     (or I'll just point her to the archives) so the organizers know what a 
     profound effect the event had on our lives.
     
     I'll probably post more about my observations later...but like Brian 
     McG (aka Dad) said, there's alot to process.
     
     Over and out,
     Diane
     
     P.S.  Did you visit the WBL's orange parachute...an oasis between 
     camps?  There were sfravers & netter en masse there.  Yours truly and 
     the RaVer's RV included.

I was out on the south-eastern outskirts of camp. By Saturday and Sunday
nights, there was a continuous droning techno-track that played (probably)
all night and was still repeating by morning. Doesn't that assume a
meth-fueled exuberance that could just as easily have occurred anywhere? 

The exercises in drumming would have been more inspired had they 
functioned as communicative/situated/talking-poly-rhythms; there was 
little chance of this happening with concurrent, continuous, amplified
looped-broadcasts.

As it was, I had to smile at someone's sign which read: DRUM-FREE ZONE!

	Even as a Burning Man newby, I have to say that I understand what Grigsby's 
saying. I had a wonderful time (in no small part because I was hanging out 
with the beautiful loons of Team WBL (either Weird Blinking Lights or Wobble, 
take your pick)), but I was sort of bugged by the amount of hedonism for its 
own sake that I witnessed. It's popular to pick on beer-swilling jocks, but I 
have to say that most of the crasser examples of stupidity that I saw _were_ 
indeed from the jock-types. Especially the morons who were talking about 
throwing chains around one of the Sani-Huts on the last morning and dragging 
it around.
	Also, even though raving is more or less my religion, I really didn't spend 
that much time in the rave camp. Why? It's pretty simple -- I can go see 
Wicked or the various members of the S.P.A.Z. soundsystems whenever I want in 
the city, but I very rarely get the chance to witness the level of oddity that 
was prevalent at Burning Man. It bugged me how insular the rave camp was; it 
was obvious that the only reason that some of the folks were there was to 
rave, which seemed very short-sighted to me when there was so much gut-busting 
bizarreness happening all around.
	The power of Burning Man is in its ambience; I get reminded of this every 
time I try to describe what it was like. I can't. It's just not possible for 
me to summarize what was essentially an ineffable experience. I feel like a 
wholly changed person but I lack the words to describe how. Treating it as 
just another big rave turns it into a much lesser experience. At least that's 
how I feel about it.
	With that said, I had a wonderful time. I got to meet and talk to Michael 
Clay, Franklin Minor, Peter Lasell, the Captain, Niels, Vince, and a whole 
host of sfravers who I had previously known only as user IDs on the net. I 
_want_ one of Vince's flamethrowers -- watching him run around hosing down the 
Man with flame is something that will stick with me for a while. Take from 
that what you will. I know I enjoyed dancing my ass off to Minor Minor's set, 
but I regarded it as only a small facet of a very large event, and that's 
really about all of the time I spent in the rave camp.

Karen, Thanks for the jokes, they eased up what was otherwise getting to be
a bad vibe with all the talk about Burning Man problems.

As the individual that made the comment about next year being all
commercialized and different, I want to clarify that I meant that with some
humor, and also I followed it up with saying that you have got to go next
year. The experience was spectacular, yes there may have been a few
conflicts between camps, and some people were not on my wavelength, but it
was the nature of my experience to let that blow over me. The good
outweighed the bad soooooo much there was no bad to speak of and if done
right, next year could be just the same. The rave made the party for me,
that was the culture I was there to celebrate, others were there to trade
shop talk about ham radios, custom cars or fire eating. The beauty was
having fringe cultures of such diversity united there in one place. Some of
us mixed some of us didn't, but we were all there on that playa, all on the
same plane of existence. Those who were spectators? Well they can't really
be avoided, but they can get a look at a side of life they know nothing
about and learn from it. I bet they took away more then we expect.

I had never been to a burning man before, and who knows where I'll be this
time next year, but I will point to the past weekend as one of the turning
points in my life and that is more important right now then any of the us
vs. them stuff right now. Peace, gumby and flying saucers.

I had a great time and now am trying to get a grasp back on what normal
people (like the ones here at work) see as reality.

Friday I setup camp and my Burning Newt then got soused at Tiki Camp
till rumors of blended spam drinks scared me. Proceeded to do Twinkie
research by shooting them out of a spud gun, zapping them with one of the
backup transformers for the Mans neon lights (1500 volts and a great arc),
and torching them with flaming aerosol and rubbing alcohol. The Zen of twinkie
testing was discussed when one of the twinkies leaped out of the way of a hammer.
Then we headed for rave camp till sunrise. The dancing chills creeping up and 
down my spine as the playa grew light were incredible.

Saturday I got body painted then blown away naked by the white out dust storm.
I was in central camp and it was amazing to see what held up and what didn't.
Also cool to see people grabbing hold of the nearest thing around and holding it
down not even knowing who's it was. (Tiki kept the blenders whirring through out
the storm. Talk about pros.) Damn near lost my voice whooping and hollering as 
each storm came through. What a rush.

Polkacide was really cool. (I'd never slam danced naked before.) Then the next 
storm came which put a halt to the avenue of art. Oh well, the camel at sultan 
camp got burned with a really good drum circle and quit a few wild dancers. The 
sunrise at the man was really intense with a pink walking rain cloud to the east 
and dark clouds full of lighting to the west. (Almost matched the blue and red 
sides of the Man.)

Sunday was slow in main camp (Lots of people recovering.) I met Vince and Amy
and that was cool, (good to hook-up with a few sfravers.) Then the rains came,
signaled by a hugh thunder clap which rolled around and around the hills. Before
long, people are getting pulled behind vehicles on their butts making us laugh 
and then this guy started playing a trap set and people started throwing off their
clothes and dancing naked in the rain and the mud. I took some pictures then
decided it was perfect for a newt so I joined in. As more and more people had
trouble keeping their feet we collapsed into a big wiggling pile doing the naked
amphibian mud flop. It was the wildest inner child mixed with adult sexuality 
type of thing I've ever done. I had the Water Woman shower me to get cleaned off.
The stuff was up my nose, in my ears and pretty much every where else, but it was 
worth it. 

I got to tape a twinkie to the colon of the man to finish the twinkie research.

Then it was time for the Man. I went around the backside (southeast) so I could
get front row without being crushed. The jet car going by was really wild and
came about ten feet from me. Close enough to feel the heat from the side. Then
the fireworks. I happened to be right where some of them ended up hitting the 
ground. The first one landed about three feet from me and exploded into a ten foot
radius. Several peoples clothes got burned but no one was hurt. Boy did they 
listen when the guy with the flare told them to move back again. We, had several
more land in our midst but now that we were paying attention we made plenty of
room for them. Then the performance dancers and finally the man was lit. It was
great seeing Vince torch the parts that didn't catch due to the wind. The Dancing
Man was great when they pulled the guy wires to try to make him fall.

The Lingam burn was great (Amy gives a great description) with white blue flames
coming out the top at the end. The music had changed from the drum procession 
which played the whole time for the Man to Sharkbait warming up for the crushfest.

They tossed out hundreds of drum sticks and drug out parts of cars, metal tubes,
sheet metal, corrugated metal and lots of other stuff to pound on. It's a wonderful
thing to be making these wild pulsating beats with hundreds of others. The band
becomes incidental and the tribalness takes over. Bang it, jump on it, go crazy
making sounds getting into it with your whole body.

Finally, it was time to burn my newt. Had to carry it out to the middle of center
camp because of the high winds, but we got it torched up after the procession,
did some drumming, and poured the rest of the newts head stout. Vince showed up
with a laminate for me (thanks a ton, that was really great) then headed for rave
camp. I felt like drumming some more, but every time I headed for what I thought
was a drum circle it ended up being Wickeds bass bouncing off of something so I
went and danced for awhile then passed out from exhaustion and excitement.

Overall, the super weird became normal (weird was barely noticed) and the surreal
became the way of things. The storms couldn't have been better planned for their
entertainment value while their duration was short enough to be quite surviable. 
I again had one of the best times of my life.

Unfortunately this seems to be true, it is hard to plead poor when you
show up in a delux RV, also if you were at laa prepared, you would know
that the $35 is a fraction of the cost of actually coming to burning man,
in my opinion EVERYONE should pay or volunteer services if you don't
pay, it's only fair that way.  I have to admit that I did feel a wee bit
embarrised by the "ravers" for all our talk of PLUR we didn't show much
unity or respect out ou the playa.

I have to take exception here, while the Wicked sound system was loud
it was not any louder in the main camp then any of the other soundsystems
or acts, I think this complaint has more to do with the "repetative
beats" that these sound systems emit, either you love it or you hate it.
I think if you moved the camp out a little further that would help a lot,
many people were really turned on and I got positive words from a couple
of the young off duty rangers who came out to check us out.

Any of you's guys got your photos of the BM festival developed yet?  I 
did, and although they are wonderful, I missed getting some things on 
film.  I didn't get ANY pictures of the rave camp or of any dj's spinning 
(*wah*) or of the Lingham sculpture or the Man during daylight hours.  

If sunset is happening close to the bay (as in Richmond or Berkeley) 
either this Sunday or next or both (I don't have to work!!) I shall bring 
my pics and all who went, bring yours...we could have a photo exchange, 
or tell you which ones we want a copy of.  I'll pay for any copies, then 
give you my snail main address to mail 'em to me.  Is this a good idea or 
what?!?

love,
Amy

Well I had a great time, this my second year at BM.  I was quite bummed at
the anticlimatic burning of the man though.  I can't believe they made
everyone sit down and wouldn't let people dance while the man burned.  I
guess I can believe it from a safety standpoint, cuz someone would have
probably got pushed into the fire, but none-the-less I was really
disappointed at how the crowd couldn't participate as much.  (sorry to
dredge up the past, but...) Last year as soon as it was lit a huge dance
circle formed around the man and everyone went fucking crazy.  I remember
having to take most of my clothes off because the fire was so hot and I was
dancing so close to it.  It felt like we were watching a movie this time.
We ended up going over about 300 feet away and watching Ren and Stimpy on
the side of someones RV...and I despise TV.  I'm really glad that so many
people had as good a time this year as I did last year though.  

Then we found this guy laying on the ground being totally unresponsive.  We
tried to get him up but again he wouldn't respond.  We finally got some help
from some authority types and they called the medics.  After a while he
finally started responding and eventually got up.  He kept telling them he
was dead.  He kept saying "I died".  Everyone just kept telling him "nope,
your alive".  It was kinda funny actually.  Eventually one of the rangers
led him away to find a warm place for him to ride out his trip.  It was cool
that they didn't arrest him.

I'll probably post more later, but I'm hungry.  All in all I had a wonderful
time.  Later.

Rick

I call 'em raves cause that's what I learned that they were.  The word 
"party" conjures up visions of kegs and rowdy drunken jerks.  A rave is 
just a rave...nothing can substitute what it means to *me*.  I call 
Friends and Family a rave, I call the Gathering a rave, I call Wicked a 
rave.  Now I call Cool World just plain madness.   I think people are 
getting a little anal when they get all worked up saying "no, that wasn't 
a *rave*, that was a *party*!!"   For crying out loud....the event/ rave/ 
party, whatever - just IS.  Words are stupid.

Amy

the burning man section.


Yowzaa! 

Gretchen, Christina, Alyssa and I arrived in Gerlach 
in our rental vehicle around 6pm on Thursday. We met up 
with Jeff and Kevin who took my car. Then we were off 
to the playa! I don't know what to say about the
expanse or the landscape in general, except that 
it is beautiful. Ok -I'll admit more than that- 
I felt that the Earth, the distant shapes of the hills, 
the (on Thursday night, anyway, before it just became dust) 
patterns of the cracked lake bed, the one mountain that looked like 
a resting nanook(sp?) truly were communicating- sending 
their own messages out into the cosmos. Ultimately, i 
guess I felt that despite all of the revelry, pagentry, ritual, 
noise and plain old living going on- the land and sky had 
more to say out there than we did. (though that's not to say that 
I didn't appreciate or enjoy the man-crafted wackiness.
 Man knows I did !)

We finally decided to pitch camp in a place we happened 
upon. We didn't really know the lay of the land or 
what shape the civilization would take at that point. We 
were one of the first 40 or 50 sites. I am incredibly 
grateful that we went early- and I would highly 
recommend it to anyone who is able to shed the skin of
daily life for a few extra days. We were about 1/4 or so mile 
due north of the central radio tower. (Yes, Virginia, there were two 
radio stations to choose from). We had a mellow evening-
setting up some of our camp, exploring a bit, taking in the million 
and one colors of purple at twilight. None of the sound systems 
had arrived yet, so we just put some Getz/Gilberto, Vince Guaraldi 
and Big Bang CD3 on the box and chatted on the tarp. Periodically
we'd walk away from camp and its lights to look at the 
stars, trying to identify various constellations. On this night,
the encampments had more of a quiet nomadic presence than 
the later carnival/festival presence. 

On Friday, we arose to a perfectly clear sky. The sun was so 
bright that it stung your eyes to look at the desert floor.
We were greeted early in the day by a show of inverted Blue Angels-
frightening and spectacular. 

We did some more exploring- discovered McSatan's- the 
general store of the playa. On that first day, everything 
was $1, $2 on the second day and $3 on the third- Robinson Carusoe
all over! We drove out to the camp toward the far north- it looked like 
a mirage from our camp. Each structure was doubled by a 
floating, waving reflection. When we returned to 
our camp, it was too hot to do much of anything but sit in 
the shade. we played a little soccer and frisbee, but only 
for a short time- then back to the shade, where we watched 
more and more people arrive. We rightly guessed that we would have 
several new neighbors by nightfall and many more in the morning.
We waved and shouted Hellos to people who passed us, welcoming them 
to our slice of suburbia. 
 
At dusk, christina and Alyssa set out for, well, for the outlands. 
I decided to join them after a while. Kevin had to point them out 
to me- 2 small black dots on the horizon. I decided to jog all 
the way- about a mile or so. I did stop occasionally to look at the 
desert floor. Patches of it were very smooth, but as you moved away from 
camp, it became more like curved, cracked clay; then in sections 
like broken glass. The mountains were shading parts of the playa by now,
but the sun still shone, too. Looking off to where the sun was shining
the playa looked like a golden field of wheat. When you looked 
closer to yourself so that the sun no longer reflected off of 
the floor, it turned this blue color. The contrast 
between the golden color and the long shadows generated by Alyssa, 
Christina and I made it appear as if there were halos around our 
oblong shadow heads. did I mention the purple? 

We returned to camp and were happy to see a large teepee being 
erected near our camp. Yea! a landmark. We hung around camp 
long enough to watch the bug van come rolling up to the teepee. 
The folks in the bug van t.p.ed the teepee! Those meta-expressionistic 
buggers!

Sometime later we women went to the rave camp- about 1&3/4 mile walk-
south and just left of the moon. I'm sure it was closer, but we 
could never quite manage a straight line. Along the way, we 
veered east to look at the neon sculptures- one was a little 
family of burning people, some neon palm trees, and some 
other neon shapes sprouting from the desert floor. 
The other looked like a series of 
straight neon lines from a distance, but really it was this 
enormous neon dancing person facing the desert sky. We passed the 
North Pole on the way- a full shanty shack with a glowing Santa 
on top!

Once we arrived at rave camp, we danced for a bit near the 
closer sound system (i.e. SPAZ)- I don't think 
Wicked was playing yet. We milled about a bit, danced some 
more- oh- and I introduced myself to the Capt'n- hiya! 

Meanwhile, Kevin and Jeff went downtown and watched 
a man push and pull skewers through his body.

Everyone but Alyssa left rave camp earlier than later-
at this point we were finally realizing that we should 
try to be nocturnal (though we didn't quite manage this either).

Alyssa returned to camp bearing gifts- she brought Phil to 
our camp to meet me! hi Phil! I was pretty tired by then
and not the best company- sorry about that. We shared some 
oranges fireside and listened to Sean(sp? DJ from Seattle)'s 
tape, which is really good, BTW.

Burning man report
==================

After last years very strange and exciting encounters at Burning Man 
festival,  I just HAD to do it again this year.   I think that no matter 
where I would ever be in the world,  I would ALWAYS somehow try and make 
it back to the Black Rock Desert in September.   WOW!!  What an 
incredible way to end a wonderful raving summer.

Preparation
-----------

It took some preparation for this trip,   mostly because of the fact 
that it's a dry desert,  and there are essential items one should take,  
such as plenty or water and material to make shade.

A fellow SFRaver Seth contacted me and was the only rider that responded 
to my posting on SFRaves.   There were others,  but nobody called me 
back,  so I assumed they got rides.

The Trip
--------

We left late Thursday evening,   drove through the evening,  thanx to 
Seth to arrive at Gerlach's Bruno's Bar,  where I was to hook up with 
one of the organizers to put up an Internet link out on the Playa.

So,  we pull into the ONLY gas station in this town,  look round and I 
find Travis (Another Raver dude).   We talk for a while I went into 
Bruno's to hook up with Stewart.   I went to his hotel room but couldn't 
find him,  so we went out to the Playa,   following our directions 
PRECISELY.   At this point,  it was about 8 am,  which was
a perfect time to arrive.   It was cool enough so that I could scout 
around on my dirt bike without roasting in the sun.

Setting up
----------

At this point,  things were still getting set up,   and markers laid
out in a more organized way with little red flags,  defining the various
areas used by the festival.   These well defined areas made it MUCH 
better to locate other camps.   For instance,  they had red flags 
radiating WEST out from main center,  YELLOW for North,   etc.    Then, 
one would locate a camp in a quadrant between the specific flags.

My first order of business was to contact Stewart to see what was being 
done to establish an Internet connection between the Playa and the rest 
of the world.   I was somewhat skeptical if it was possible to send a 
good enough quality of signal to pass data packets reliably,   but 
eventually,  Stewart finally got a group of people with the equipment,  
and things were getting set up.

I stayed out of the way and looked amazement as a radio station sorta
materialized out of the desert.   It's simple pre-fab construction was 
carefully prepared and in just a few hours,   was constructed and ready 
to be hooked up.

I started looking around for the Rave camp,   but very little activity 
was going on,  except a small filming group,  shooting a movie with 
"Burning man" in it.


The location and setting
------------------------

The location (A huge dried out lake bed) is probably the flattest place 
on earth.    Just for fun,  as I was riding my dirt bike out on the 
desert,   I tried closing my eyes to see how long I could ride without 
the temptation of opening them.   At first,   I could hold them close 
for a few minutes,   before "getting chicken" and opening them again.
As I tried,  I also noticed that for long durations I tended to veer off
to the left,  thus circling back.    I think I was veering about 15 
degrees/minute.   As I practiced,  my veer rate would diminish,  and 
eventually I could hold them closed or 10 minutes.   After all that
veering around,   I couldn't see the camp anymore,   so rode in the 
approximate direction,  using the stars as my guide.    Later on,   I 
could barely see the outline of the familiar hills that always served as 
a direction guide.    IE:  Rave camp always slightly to the right of 
that really tall peak (Near where the hot springs were).

So,   after blissfully pedaling all around the desert,   I eventually 
spot the laser shining BEHIND the horizon,  and learned that I had 
traveled approx. 7 to 8 miles from BOTH main and rave camp.   So I set 
my sites on the laser beam that unerringly guided me towards the rave.   
Eventually I could see it appear above the horizon,  and it just didn't 
appear to get any closer.    After about 20 minutes of steadily pedaling 
I eventually made it back to rave camp,  at which time I wasted no time 
in dancing.


The Environment
---------------

It rained several times,  and boy did it ever get muddy.   The mud 
smelled like dead fish,  sorta had a pungy fresh smell to it,   but 
completely eliminated the dust problem.   Now,  there was lots of sticky 
gooey mud that people wasted no time in getting it all over their 
bodies.   

On Sat afternoon,  a rally nasty rainstorm came through in the afternoon 
which really generated tons of mud.    I was caught in main camp where I 
was just about to get a grilled cheese sandwich.   But the rain changed 
all of our plans.    It came up so suddenly.

As it was raining,  I took the opportunity to borrow some soap and a 
towel and took a nice refreshing shower.  Others did the opposite by 
rolling in the mud.   I saw this really cool midget guy,  hanging onto 
the back of the bumper of a car,  sliding in the mud.    Then,  he 
would 
let go and spin around several times,  and would slide an incredible 50 
feet after letting go.    About 100 feet away from me,   I found a huge 
drum circle,  and people writhing in the mud crawling all over each 
other in some twisted body ritual....  I just squished around in the 
mud,  enjoying it squishing between my toes.   I dirt bike was utterly 
useless,  so I stashed it somewhere and hung out until it dried.   It 
dried in just 2 hours amazingly enough. 

Main Features
-------------

The main feature of course was the burning of the man,   but the 
afternoon,  was a fashion show,   which I thought was really unique.
After the fashion show,  I headed out to the hot springs once again and 
took a well deserved break from the heat.


The Burning of the man
----------------------

I head back to the main camp to take in the final songs from the live 
band (Shark Bait - I believe).   At about that time,   people were 
chanting "Burning man" and the long procession began as people started 
marching towards the burning man.    I quickly zipped ahead of the group 
and established a good vantage point before the main contingent arrived.

As usual,  there was lots of ritualistic happenings,  such as skits,  
and this rocket powered go-cart using a "pulse jet" engine.   This thing 
was amazingly LOUD,  and zipped around the circle wildly.   The exhaust 
pipe was glowing orange hot,  then it broke through the crowd and headed 
out onto the desert.

At that time,  people were chanting "Burn it!   Burn it!" as the 
organizers were trying to hold everyone back.    Eventually,  it got 
lit,   but didn't quite burn evenly,  but the fireworks were absolutely 
impressive as it exploded in a huge shower of sparks.   As it was 
burning,   people were pulling on he guy wires until it fell over,  
which was the queue for people to run towards it,   yelling and 
chanting.

Shortly after that,  people were gathering around this huge penis type 
chimney,  dancing around in strange dances and costumes.   Eventually,  
it was lit,   and as it started to burn,   you could actually see 
through it as the flames shot upwards like a rocket exhaust in purple, 
green and blue flames.   Again,  people were dancing around it,  some 
actually jumping directly over the flames.   


The Rave(s)
-----------

Eventually,  I headed back to rave camp,  and arrived just in time to 
Lucas's set.   Lucas,  eventually from the Netherlands was playing some 
of the most brilliant Acid Trance I've heard in a long time.   It didn't 
take me long before I had a total "out of body" experience as I bopping 
around the dance area like a raving maniac.   Sheesh,  this was my 3rd 
all-niter as the ONLY time I slept was on Thursday evening.   Amazingly 
enough,  I danced all night long until the next DJ went on just as the 
sun rose.    After that,  I chilled for a few hours and came back for 
one more dance binge until the sound stopped.   

The SPAZ dance area was so good that I didn't even bother to make it 
over to the Wicked arena.    I did actually go over to check it out,   
but found the trance more to my liking.

Leaving
-------

As it became towards the afternoon,  Seth had already packed up the tent 
and supplies in the car,   so we organized a large caravan of 5 (or 
more) cars to Pyramid Lake for a much deserved splooch in the cool lake 
before heading through Reno and back to the Bay Area.   Thanx go to Seth 
for doing all the driving as he managed to get some sleep,  as I was in 
NO condition to drive at all.    We eventually make it back around 11 
PM.

Sat & Sun...

Saturday morning everyone but Christina and I went to Gerlach.
I thought they might take showers, but instead they drank 
margaritas at one of the bars in town. 

christina and I waited for more of our crew to arrive- we were 
pretty worried about them being able to find us. Luckily
we spotted them driving around aimlessly in downtown 
playaville. We ran after them,
christina taking one corridor and I another- finally, 
we caught them and led them to the spot. Manny, Steve,
Daniel, Pete and Cara looked a little road-weary, but 
were equally awakened at what they'd seen so far.
The other group folk came back and we played a few rounds 
of soccer. Some people left for rave camp. 

Soon thereafter we watched the approaching, vertical sheet of clouds. 
We heard lots of people cheering it on its way and assumed 
that it was a rain storm. We put everything inside the tents,
except ourselves, as we were waiting for the rain. Once the 
dust storm hit, I couldn't see my hands, much less any of the 
tents or cars. Luckily, I was holding a tarp. I grabbed 
Gretchen and walked until we were standing on top of one of 
the tents that had deflated. I grabbed the tarp over my head 
and tried to get Gretchen under there with me. She was in 
pain and afraid of damaging her eyes permanently (she 
had her contacts in). Finally, she understood what I was 
motioning for her to do and she joined me under the tarp. 
Moments later we were joined by Christina and Kevin. After 
we had secured the tarp beneath us, we just hugged, held 
and petted each other-aware of our own delicacy. 

When the storm passed and we exited the tarp, we were 
pretty dazed and looked on each other with awe. What I 
remember most was that everyone's eyelashes and hair 
were white with playa dust. That and that only two of six tents 
were still afloat.  We didn't rebuild right away- we just 
walked around, estranged witnesses to the power that had passed. 
Then we saw the rainbow forming and watched as it stretched and 
arced- something between a yawn and a smile- until both ends 
touched the desert floor and the second reverse rainbow did
the same. Everywhere people were cheering the sky. This 
was one of the most magical moments to me. It was as if the sky 
had sent down tentacles of wind and dust to find out what we 
were all about, then colorfully displayed an acknowledgement 
of our presence- or perhaps it was recognition, or perhaps 
nothing at all but the usual late summer/early fall weather of 
the desert coming up from the Gulf of California or maybe 
from as far away as the Gulf of Mexico- our own little taste 
of hurricane Louise. 

Everyone who had been there Fryday was tired and stuck close to camp 
and downtown (except Alyssa). The newer arrivals took off for rave camp.
This was the only night I slept well. I understood the 
gravity of my mistake upon waking in the morning to the boom boom
wah wah boom boom coming across the desert from the rave camp.

Sunday morning we decided to drive to what we thought were the 
closest mountains. As we neared them, the playa began to 
look a little less dry. So, we parked some distance away.
During our approach, we began to hear loud noises echoing 
off of the mountain and we saw a long shining line of cars 
parked on a road cut into the hillside. From the noise, 
we guessed they were shooting. We were right. We walked 
up to the firing range just in time to catch some staged 
drive-by shootings. Most commonly, there were two shooters 
per truck bed. The trucks travelled about 5-15 mph and once 
they crossed into the firing range, the shooters took aim 
and fired at their targets. The targets consisted of many 
stuffed animals hung up on stakes- Barney included. &, no, 
I didn't see Ernie! One of the participants was this large naked man-
naked except for his hat, shoes, sunglasses, earplugs,
gun, gun holster, and a strategically placed ammo holster. 
I heard him introduce himself to one of the other drive-by patrons.
He said, "Hello, I'm Bob; or, if you will, Zeus!" Real 
Church of the Sub-genius material! No doubt graced by the Bob 
trinity. Just don't eat the children, Zeus!

But really folks- I didn't know how to feel about this event.
I'm pretty confused about gun control in general. I'm for it,
but I don't think it would work & I still respect the rights 
of folks like these to have a safe, organized bit of firing fun.
On the other hand, there were more than a few people standing 
around who I didn't want to be near & who made me edgy. It
was interesting to come across, but I wanted to leave 
almost immediately.  The scariest part of this event was the 
red-shirted fool who started his own personal firing range 
almost directly behind us! He was far enough away that we weren't 
in immediate danger, but none of us could walk out until 
he quit. 

We drove to rave camp and dropped a few folks off, then returned to our
camp. We picked up a bunch of walkers along the way- all very 
friendly and glad of our company as well as the transport!
alyssa, Christina, Cara and I tromped around for a bit from one camp 
to another. I think we walked about 4 miles altogether. Then we 
came back to camp. Manny took my car to rave camp for a bit.

I decided to try to nap. Just as I was about to put myself in a tent,
Manny came barreling up in my car with Markie. We introduced ourselves
while Manny fiddled with something or other. That's my Emanuel! 
Jason (Spun) also visited sometime before the storm, but I can't 
really say when- that napping business ya know ;) it distorts 
everything under the sun.

I was up and about when the rain and hail came! 
What a welcome relief! After it stopped hailing for the second time,
we started a game of grudge-match mud soccer in true slide tackle 
style! Many people from neighboring camps joined in & it was
a lot of fun! We were all pretty mud-soaked at game's end, which 
was all good and well until the mud started to dry and 
crack on our skin, but a couple of towels and some water 
took care of most of this. Ole'! Ole'! Ole'! Ole'! 
(Internatioal futbol chant).

___THE BURNING_OF_THE_MAN___________________________________

Soon, we began to hear an ever increasing din of drums coming 
from the central camp. I was very anxious to leave 
for the downtown, but others were content to wait a bit. So, 
I went by myself. I must say I felt a little lost amid the throng, 
but I found a place where I could easily view and focus on the man. 
Soon people started to chant and/or individually scream "Burn Him." I 
found myself having a really bizarre reaction to that. On the one hand, 
I was as ready as the next person for the fire- his fire. On the 
other hand, I had an overwhelming sense of sympathy for 
both the man (the symbol) & the structure (the art). I was honestly 
wishing that I could do something to save it. Now I can only 
wonder what that heroic act might have looked like and how 
completely pissed off everybody else would have been. Am I nuts?
Did anyone else feel this way? Also, another bizarre occurence-
a bit before the burning, a man walked up to me and said, "In 
the name of Jesus of Nazareth I place a white shield around you,"
raised his hand in front of me and walked off before I could respond.
I wasn't afraid, just surprised to be singled out for this:
Clearly he meant to protect me and keep me pure for Jesus- amen 
and hallelulu! 

Maybe I felt that sympathy because I only witnessed the razing and not 
the raising- I don't know.

After the burning, the whole place errupted in lunacy.
There were lunatics running around everywhere (i think I 
might have been one of them- but I may not be the best judge).
Real lunatics- moon gods and goddesses howling, shrieking, 
yelling, laughing, cavorting, ecstatic... For me the falling of the man 
mostly served as a marker for the start of the carnival- 
a real carnival- masked flesh gone mad! drummers and mummers everywhere-
every kind of fire and/or light glinting off the skin of naked 
men and women who were caked in the dried mud of the playa- their 
eyes and nostrils taking on a red/yellow quality next to the whitish 
playa paint. fireworks from every direction added to the acrid
smell of pitch and gasoline and sulfur in the air. parades of 
bizarre hand-made bicycles and costumes flashed past. 

i returned to camp to meet up with all of the folk- none of whom i
could find in the throng. soon, we decided to go to rave camp.

I remember the exact circumstance of becoming a part of the madness:
as we were walking to the rave camp, we passed a stage in the downtown
area where there was some man laughing into a microphone- but I 
couldn't see him for the crowd- I could only hear a wild voice 
coming out of the speakers with a background of noise music. 
What I did see was this- another man in the "audience" who was 
silently miming along to the laughter- rolling and shaking with it.
One guffaw a mimicry, another a mockery, the next a parody and 
so on... the disembodied voice had found a home in him & his body 
a home in that evil speaker laughter. I glanced away from the man
& noticed that maybe a hundred others were there & they were laughing
too- out loud, right along with the overlord speaker-laugher. 
I looked back to the silent man who was still shaking, and I began to 
laugh. At that moment my non-laughing self became afraid for my 
laughing self and the other laughers about me. My laughing 
self would not be persuaded to silence, but neither would my 
non-laughing self. So, a funny thing happened- my non-laughing
self began laughing at my laughing self; "as if you could ditch 
me with laughter- ha ha ha- look who's laughing now!"
And so I ended up with both feet in the madness pond.

But only very briefly. This all passed in a matter of seconds.
Then we were off again. As we neared the rave sites, we noticed 
a bunch of Nevada state trooper cars with their lights flashing.
Then those disappeared and in their place were a bunch of flares 
in three parallel lines. We passed this, but soon turned around to 
watch the medivac helicopter land. We didn't know what had happened
(though we found out on our walk back) & decided it was probably 
not the time to go hunting for info near the helicopter/accident 
site. 

A good sized group was already amassed at the 
Wicked site. I pretty much stayed along the perimeter. Then I 
went to the sani-hut by myself. Here I met three people-
Ranee(sp?), Niel and Jon- was that you? All really sweet! 
If you're out there- I had glasses on, some jeans and 
an oatmeal-colored sweater. Although Ranee and Niel invited me 
to come dance with them, I just wasn't sitting right with the 
emerging scene. I was glad of the opportunity for dancing 
to "house music all night long", but what I really wanted to do
was put my head on the desert floor, look up at the stars 
and let my mind be quiet. With that, Kevin, Daniel and I 
left to return to camp. 

On our way, a man told us that a woman had been riding atop 
a car and had fallen off. she was then hit by another car.
Does anyone have any information about her condition or 
can anyone verify if this is true?

When we got to camp, Kevin and Daniel played their guitars 
and I did what I wanted. I was really tired and soon left 
the stars for the cieling of the tent. I had a hard time 
falling asleep and mostly just thought about things while 
listening to the tent move in the wind. Suddenly, Daniel, Kevin 
and Jeff (who had returned by then, too) broke out into song-
Daniel started singing about the "Funky Dirt" (of which there was plenty)
at the top of his lungs and doing a remarkably well-matched drum solo 
to go with it. Cara, alyssa and I were in the tent. Alyssa didn't wake, 
but Cara and I rolled with laughter. 

soon Daniel stopped and we settled back down. For some reason 
I chose this time to think about Jon, who was my boyfriend 
of 2 & 1/2 years and who broke up with me the Saturday before 
Burning Man. I mourned and cried for a bit as quietly as I could-
something I had been meaning to do since I arrived, but kept forgetting.
Every once in a while, either Cara or I would remember 
and/or whisper "funky dirt" and then I would laugh again. So I 
spent my last night at black Rock with a bunch of maniacs 
while in a mania myself. I finally fell asleep, but before 
I did I heard Daniel say (and this was the last thing I heard 
that night), "My soul for a bottle of dirt" [of which there 
was plenty ;)     


Love to all! 

Jocelyn

okay, i gotta comment here...

yikes!  i thought i escaped this kind of stupid, genderbiased humor when 
i left the office ... sigh.  i really can't stand these kinds of jokes, 
cuz even tho they're making fun of specific behaviors that may be common 
to many (straight) men, i think they actually REINFORCE the idea that these 
are typical male behaviors (hence somewhat okay) and they reinforce 
gender-biases (i.e. men are always horny (as if women aren't!)  men can't 
clean...etc. etc.

some more comments:

> 3.  How does a man take a bubble bath?
>    -  He eats beans for dinner.

as if women don't fart!
> 
> 5.  What's a man's idea of foreplay?
>    -  A half hour of begging.

as if women don't like sex!
> 
> 
> 12. How are men and parking spots alike?
>    -  The good ones are always taken and the ones left are handicapped.

this is really offensive.  what the fuck?!  hello, have we ever heard of 
respect for disabled people?!!!

Well, after finally recovering enough to post...

Rather than repeating things that have been described sooo well by Mizz 
Starkey and others, I decided to post some bad and some GREAT 
observations/things that happened: 
1) Good and bad:

The AWESOME forces of nature. Riding through the worst storm of my life 
on a motorcycle to get to the playa, with standing sheets of water on the 
road and hail the size of large peas really gives one a new found respect. 
The good thing about this is that I can probably laugh off fear of driving in 
the rain around the Bay Area.

Variations on a common theme: Dust, dirt, and MUD!!! It became insuated 
into your very being. Never had I imagined how cleansing jumping nekked 
into a muddy pool of water(hot springs) could feel.

Absolutely incredible lightning storms. I remember walking towards the 
man on the night of the burn, with him being silhouetted by a natural light 
show that nothing man made could come close to. Almost overwhelmingly 
powerful. 


Main Camp:

Good Things:

The sheer wackiness of it all. Things I would be hard pressed to come up 
with in a million years, like Mc Satans, and Celebrity crucifixion. There 
were some very imaginative, intelligent, creative people out there.

Bad Things:
(minor)
A few close minded people, which was rather perplexing. Lots o' trash.


The burn itself: 

Good things:

The wonderful people I went with.

The procession including the jet car with an unearthly rumble, fireworks, the 
vari-colored masked dancers, and of course Vince, in a bright orange jumpsuit 
with a flame thrower strapped to his back, helping the man to its firey demise. 

Bad things: 

The spectator quotient. Quite a few assholes standing around yelling "Just 
burn the fucking thing down," and similar epitaths, really detracted from the 
communal energy of those getting into it. It is my sincere hope that 
these folks will stay home and watch the Beach MTV re-runs in the future.

The pandering to the media. This is my single, biggest problem with this 
entire event. For a group that proclaimed that it didn't want the media 
interfering with the participants, it seemed they had no problem giving 
the media preferential access to space during the burn. Media should have 
been given the same access as the participants, if the organizers had 
really meant what they said. I guess they didn't...


The rave camp:

Bad things: 
The rumors of petty bitching between the two groups (S.P.A.Z./Gateway/F-8) 
and Wicked. Someone please correct me if I am wrong; from what I heard the 
people from one group were trying to get to get together with the other group 
to put forth one massive effort at one point, but the other group had a 
stick up their ass and wouldn't do it. To the group that think they are all 
rock 'n roll stars: Get off yourselves, this thing is supposed to be about 
togetherness,not hero-worship. Again, rumors are just that, so someone put me 
straight if I am wrong in this. I would like to be.

Distance, distance, distance! People were sooo spread out, it was hard to 
find anyone.

The SfRaver turn out: It was good to meet a few more of ya and to see 
those I already know and love. The bad thing was not meeting many,many 
more of ya that were there. I can fault myself for not being more gregarious.


Now on to the good thing...:

Camping with some wonderful people, Reagan(dunno if she counts cause I 
camp with her all the time ), Tony, Denise, Bill, Gaby, Mike, Jeff, Graham, 
and one or two others whose names escape me. 

The vibe level was really nice. People almost always had a hello and a 
smile. This went for the whole camp, not just the rave camp.

Dancing to some great sets for hours, which I haven't done in quite a while.

Being woken up at 6 in the morning by music and not being able to go back 
to sleep, not because it was too loud, but because it was was SO good and 
going off so HARD.


Misc:

The Police:
Good Things:

All I have to say is good things. I can't imagine myself saying that, but 
whenever I came into contact with them, they were always NICE, and 
generally looked like they were enjoying the event almost as much as we were.
I vote that we send all the California officers to Nevada for awhile to 
get a clue. 


My Motorcycle:
Bad Things:

I dropped my bike not once, but twice. The first time as I was first 
entering the playa which was soaked after a cloudburst, the guide said 
"Go in and fall down." I guess I was too obliging, and promptly did just 
that, losing my chain. 

The second time, riding towards the hot springs at about 30 MPH the playa 
shifted from hard dirt to mud without warning and down Reagan and I went, 
causing some swelling and road rash between the both of us. The bike 
ended up missing mirrors and with bent handlebars.

Good Things:

The first time I dropped my bike, through the kindness of 
strangers(fellow bikers,) I was lent the tools and given the knowledge to 
fix the problem.

The second time, I received an offer from Vince and Wayne to put my bike on 
Vinces' trailer and be given a drive back to the Bay Area, for which I am 
very much in their debt.  



Summary:

Well worth the time, expense, and effort.

I know that this post is *HUGE* and I ramble, but other than from a 
stream-of-conciousness perspective I can't explain it. It was, and is, 
and will always be, an experience that lives.

hello all-
i go to an extremely politically correct university, and have been called an
"evil, white, straight male" before by various organizations.
i don't need stuff like "dumb men jokes" on a mailing list that i have so
much pride in.
secondly, if the reverse gender jokes were posted, i would not want to be
here for the reaction.
think next time, please, about who is reading and who might come to this
mailing list for solace from the divisive world.

peace and somewhat pissed off love-

matt

I was trying to look at the changes in the vibe that have occurred over
time in relation to the way people envision the events, no matter *what* 
they call them. I was just trying to express how happy I was to discover 
that something I thought had died, something I hold *very* near and dear, is
still alive, well, and *thriving*. It had been four years since I attended
anything that was even in any way comparable to Wicked at Burning Man.
I live in Reno. Everything here is commercialized to the extremes, in one
way or another. It used to be that we would all caravan down to the bay
area as often as possible to enjoy the many sights and sounds. But lately,
it's been impossible to find out about the smaller events. It used to be
that people would freely offer the information to you, glad to include
you. Now it's like people are trying to preserve everything for just their
friends, and their scene, without regard to anyone else or regard to the
scene as a whole. 

Practically everyone in the bay area seems to take everything there for
granted. It makes me sad to hear people have a "oh, it was okay" attitude
about events I would have given a lot more than 10 hours of driving to go 
to. It's not about the price at all, it's about what you get out of the 
experience in it's entirity. There is no cash value than can be place on 
Burning Man, nor is there one that can be placed on your memories.
If someone offered you forty little green pieces of paper in exchange for 
all of your memories surrounding last weekend, would you trade???

In the words of Richard Bach:
"Anyone you want to keep in your life, _never_ take them for granted."

It applies not only to humans, but to everything. As soon as anything is 
taken for granted, it disappears. Kind of like the vibe. As soon as you 
assume that it's going to be there, it's gone. 
*That's* what I was trying to get at. 
So much for the concise, one page post. :)

I'm sorry this is so long, --but-- 
i've never been called "anal" before. :)  	lv, Alex

Burning man report
==================

After last years very strange and exciting encounters at Burning Man
festival,  I just HAD to do it again this year.   I think that no matter
where I would ever be in the world,  I would ALWAYS somehow try and make
it back to the Black Rock Desert in September.   WOW!!  What an
incredible way to end a wonderful raving summer.

Preparation
-----------

It took some preparation for this trip,   mostly because of the fact
that it's a dry desert,  and there are essential items one should take,
such as plenty or water and material to make shade.

A fellow SFRaver Seth contacted me and was the only rider that responded
to my posting on SFRaves.   There were others,  but nobody called me
back,  so I assumed they got rides.

The Trip
--------

We left late Thursday evening,   drove through the evening,  thanx to
Seth to arrive at Gerlach's Bruno's Bar,  where I was to hook up with
one of the organizers to put up an Internet link out on the Playa.

So,  we pull into the ONLY gas station in this town,  look round and I
find Travis (Another Raver dude).   We talk for a while I went into
Bruno's to hook up with Stewart.   I went to his hotel room but couldn't
find him,  so we went out to the Playa,   following our directions
PRECISELY.   At this point,  it was about 8 am,  which was
a perfect time to arrive.   It was cool enough so that I could scout
around on my dirt bike without roasting in the sun.

Setting up
----------

At this point,  things were still getting set up,   and markers laid
out in a more organized way with little red flags,  defining the various
areas used by the festival.   These well defined areas made it MUCH
better to locate other camps.   For instance,  they had red flags
radiating WEST out from main center,  YELLOW for North,   etc.    Then,
one would locate a camp in a quadrant between the specific flags.

My first order of business was to contact Stewart to see what was being
done to establish an Internet connection between the Playa and the rest
of the world.   I was somewhat skeptical if it was possible to send a
good enough quality of signal to pass data packets reliably,   but
eventually,  Stewart finally got a group of people with the equipment,
and things were getting set up.

I stayed out of the way and looked amazement as a radio station sorta
materialized out of the desert.   It's simple pre-fab construction was
carefully prepared and in just a few hours,   was constructed and ready
to be hooked up.

I started looking around for the Rave camp,   but very little activity
was going on,  except a small filming group,  shooting a movie with
"Burning man" in it.


The location and setting
------------------------

The location (A huge dried out lake bed) is probably the flattest place
on earth.    Just for fun,  as I was riding my dirt bike out on the
desert,   I tried closing my eyes to see how long I could ride without
the temptation of opening them.   At first,   I could hold them close
for a few minutes,   before "getting chicken" and opening them again.
As I tried,  I also noticed that for long durations I tended to veer off
to the left,  thus circling back.    I think I was veering about 15
degrees/minute.   As I practiced,  my veer rate would diminish,  and
eventually I could hold them closed or 10 minutes.   After all that
veering around,   I couldn't see the camp anymore,   so rode in the
approximate direction,  using the stars as my guide.    Later on,   I
could barely see the outline of the familiar hills that always served as
a direction guide.    IE:  Rave camp always slightly to the right of
that really tall peak (Near where the hot springs were).

So,   after blissfully pedaling all around the desert,   I eventually
spot the laser shining BEHIND the horizon,  and learned that I had
traveled approx. 7 to 8 miles from BOTH main and rave camp.   So I set
my sites on the laser beam that unerringly guided me towards the rave.
Eventually I could see it appear above the horizon,  and it just didn't
appear to get any closer.    After about 20 minutes of steadily pedaling
I eventually made it back to rave camp,  at which time I wasted no time
in dancing.


The Environment
---------------

It rained several times,  and boy did it ever get muddy.   The mud
smelled like dead fish,  sorta had a pungy fresh smell to it,   but
completely eliminated the dust problem.   Now,  there was lots of sticky
gooey mud that people wasted no time in getting it all over their
bodies.

On Sat afternoon,  a rally nasty rainstorm came through in the afternoon
which really generated tons of mud.    I was caught in main camp where I
was just about to get a grilled cheese sandwich.   But the rain changed
all of our plans.    It came up so suddenly.

As it was raining,  I took the opportunity to borrow some soap and a
towel and took a nice refreshing shower.  Others did the opposite by
rolling in the mud.   I saw this really cool midget guy,  hanging onto
the back of the bumper of a car,  sliding in the mud.    Then,  he would
let go and spin around several times,  and would slide an incredible 50
feet after letting go.    About 100 feet away from me,   I found a huge
drum circle,  and people writhing in the mud crawling all over each
other in some twisted body ritual....  I just squished around in the
mud,  enjoying it squishing between my toes.   I dirt bike was utterly
useless,  so I stashed it somewhere and hung out until it dried.   It
dried in just 2 hours amazingly enough.

Main Features
-------------

The main feature of course was the burning of the man,   but the
afternoon,  was a fashion show,   which I thought was really unique.
After the fashion show,  I headed out to the hot springs once again and
took a well deserved break from the heat.


The Burning of the man
----------------------

I head back to the main camp to take in the final songs from the live
band (Shark Bait - I believe).   At about that time,   people were
chanting "Burning man" and the long procession began as people started
marching towards the burning man.    I quickly zipped ahead of the group
and established a good vantage point before the main contingent arrived.

As usual,  there was lots of ritualistic happenings,  such as skits,
and this rocket powered go-cart using a "pulse jet" engine.   This thing
was amazingly LOUD,  and zipped around the circle wildly.   The exhaust
pipe was glowing orange hot,  then it broke through the crowd and headed
out onto the desert.

At that time,  people were chanting "Burn it!   Burn it!" as the
organizers were trying to hold everyone back.    Eventually,  it got
lit,   but didn't quite burn evenly,  but the fireworks were absolutely
impressive as it exploded in a huge shower of sparks.   As it was
burning,   people were pulling on he guy wires until it fell over,
which was the queue for people to run towards it,   yelling and
chanting.

Shortly after that,  people were gathering around this huge penis type
chimney,  dancing around in strange dances and costumes.   Eventually,
it was lit,   and as it started to burn,   you could actually see
through it as the flames shot upwards like a rocket exhaust in purple,
green and blue flames.   Again,  people were dancing around it,  some
actually jumping directly over the flames.


The Rave(s)
-----------

Eventually,  I headed back to rave camp,  and arrived just in time to
Lucas's set.   Lucas,  eventually from the Netherlands was playing some
of the most brilliant Acid Trance I've heard in a long time.   It didn't
take me long before I had a total "out of body" experience as I bopping
around the dance area like a raving maniac.   Sheesh,  this was my 3rd
all-niter as the ONLY time I slept was on Thursday evening.   Amazingly
enough,  I danced all night long until the next DJ went on just as the
sun rose.    After that,  I chilled for a few hours and came back for
one more dance binge until the sound stopped.

The SPAZ dance area was so good that I didn't even bother to make it
over to the Wicked arena.    I did actually go over to check it out,
but found the trance more to my liking.

Leaving
-------

As it became towards the afternoon,  Seth had already packed up the tent
and supplies in the car,   so we organized a large caravan of 5 (or
more) cars to Pyramid Lake for a much deserved splooch in the cool lake
before heading through Reno and back to the Bay Area.   Thanx go to Seth
for doing all the driving as he managed to get some sleep,  as I was in
NO condition to drive at all.    We eventually make it back around 11
PM.

Don't u think that the "(straight)" inclusion above actually REINFORCES the idea
that straight men are different from queer men :)

As a proud member of this noble gender I welcome being made fun of...

Hey everyone,

I'm still coming down to Earth after my experience at Black Rock desert, 
but I wanted to post while I'm still "feeling it".

Let's just say that any expereince is what you make of it.

Yeah, there was a lot of media B.S.( I was dancing while the Man and 
the mud tower burned, and I  was greeted by many a video camera, with 
someone asking "so what do you think of all this?", and "on a scale of 1 
to 10 how do you rate this?" Damn people, let me dance!

Yeah, there were drunk, clueless individuals who staggared about with glazed 
eyes, crying out for the sake of impressing their friends and others.

Yeah, there seemed to be some tension among a few of the sound systems at 
the Rave Camp.

And yeah, I'm sure the ritual is not what it used to be. (I can imagine 
how beautiful it must have been for a few hundred people to be together 
to share in this experience).

But I chose not to focus on all this. Instead, I decided to reach 
back...way back, into the depths of my psyche and get in touch with 
something that we all have within us, but appears to be buried underneath 
a deluge of conditioning, programming, self-doubt, and fear.

A primal energy that defies my explanation. 

I've experienced this energy on the dance floor, but due to the influence 
of drugs, there was no connection to it's source, so after a while, the 
"feeling" was lost. At some outdoor parties, I could feel this energy 
much more, but due to the limited duration of the TAZ, the connection to 
this energy was not as significant.

Burning Man was a TAZ that allowed enough time for the natural 
progression from conditioned human to a timeless, sentient being.  

On Sunday, after wrything around for a couple hours in the mud in front 
of the SPAZ tower, I walked into main camp, covered head to toe in mud.

The mud clinging to my skin, I could feel each hair on my body pull 
tight with each step. I felt a sort of alien, a being from some distant 
world visiting these things called "humans". I began thinking...

I am not of this world. 

Wait. I AM of this world. I've just become so distant from what I TRULY AM
that I feel alien.

This primal energy. This is me. 



I was then reminded of a Tibetan proverb:

		"If it is here, it is everywhere.
		 If it is not here, it is nowhere."


Exactly.


If Burning Man happens next year, it'll probably be more of what it was 
this year, a media free for all, a place for the family to come and look 
at all the "crazy" or "weird" people, and a very fragmented ensemble of 
energy. Perhaps all the more reason for the promoters to take a break and 
rethink their strategy for maintaining the intimacy needed for this type 
of ritual.


Burning Man gave me the reasssurance that though we all might have our 
differences, we are all connected with this primal energy. 

Perhaps if we can begin to trust this energy, welcome it and nurture it, we can 
dissolve our conditioning, thus our differences, and live in a world of 
mutual respect and trust.

Hello good people!  I know a lot of you are still recovering from BM,
but are any of you going to the Full Moon Rave that is happening this

     --Nomads--
     
     Don't know about the rest of you, but I find the Black Rock has 
     permanently etched images of boundless moonlit expanses on the 
     palimpsest of my brain.  Even now -sitting here at work- that taught, 
     electrical sensation on the back of my neck makes it hard for me to 
     settle entirely in the moment.  My eyes burn brighter.
     
     I would be deeply disappointed if Burning Man did not occur next year. 
     Not specifically the event itself even, but the opportunity to 
     experience that stunning, otherworldy environment, with a community.  
     My question is this:  to those of you with connections to the 
     organizers, do you think it would still be feasible to plan an 
     intimate, unrelated gathering on the playa without so much paperwork 
     and legalistic entanglement?  I'm sure that at one time Burning Man 
     was more comparable in scale to a New Moon party, without the 
     helicopters and portable toilets and the Happiness Boys in their 
     patrol cars.  What would it take?  What might it cost?  
     
     Perhaps it's time to invent new rituals and reshape the character of 
     this desert pilgrimage.  It has been suggested that we may have 
     alienated some who did not share our passion for the music.  Fair 
     enough.  This rave community includes quite a diversity of backgrounds 
     and perspectives, but as we continue to demonstrate every weekend, we 
     know how to come together and take care of each other.  Who better to 
     converge and collaborate?  Even for just 2 days it would be worth it.  
     Am I being unrealistic?  Perhaps, but I feel quite certain the playa 
     will intersect my future before another year passes.  It simply won't 
     release me.

                  Yeah this is a good question:). After seeing and 
hearing WIcked at BM and after not going to a FMR for awhile wait here, 
What I"m trying to say is: I'd also like to know if there is going to be 
a FMR this weekend and when?? O.K. I will now attempt to have a

        OH MAN! that was lovely! i'm burning with jealousy right now that i
couldn't attend this event (for lack of a better word, but i'm sure i could
never describe it) and also for that feeling that you've felt that i REALLY
strive for but haven't experienced in a long time: that feeling of
"everything is in it's place" that contact with everything.  One of my
favorite quotes is "ecstasy is the contemplation of wholeness" and i think
you get what i'm saying. If you haven't already read the Archaic Revival,
read it! It totally talks about the same sore of experiences that you're
talking about.  That "primal energy" is what terence Mckenna would call the
"overmind" or the "oversoul" or the "gaian mind" and coming into contact
with that, that thing that is sooo deeply buried in all of us (and that
thing that many have tried to supress for the past couple thousand years)
that it DOES feel completely alien to us. He goes on to say that the rash
of UFO sightings and all the craziness with aliens and abductions (and this
is a TOTALLY observable cultural phenomenon currently) is a reflection of
the fact aht there are a lot of ppl (ravers and non-ravers alike) who are
beginning to percieve something outside of empircally substantiated
science.
        anyways, i just thought i'd pass this on to you but being that
you're into Hakim Bey and TAZ theory and whatevah i figured you'd be
interested if you haven't already read McKenna's stuff. It IS good to know
that there are ppl out there who are having similar experiences and
thoughts as me though :)
        take care,
                brad

Dear All;

=09I wouldn't mind this type of humor IF!!!!!!, I thought I could get=20
away with it with womyn. But if I had posted DUMB WOMYN JOKES, I know I=20
would be seriously chastised to the point of having to leave SFRaves, and=
=20
be forced to live in a cave for the rest of my miserable MALE life. At=20
this point in the history of male female relationships, we as memebers of=
=20
both genders; which include those who live an alternative lifestsyle, can=
=20
afford nothing more than ZERO TOLERANCE for such humor.

=09So Karen, please do send me your address from the cave. Cause my=20
FEELING are hurt.

I'm sorry about that damn quote from The Healing Brain.... it is apparently 
doing the von Neumann and replicating copies of itself.

The main problem, I think, is that it's no longer fun for the organizers;
they're spending all their time trying to keep people from injuring themselves,
dealing with police/BLM officials, raising money, and other not-fun things --
and they're still losing money each year.  As someone put it, "The credit 
cards are all maxed out.  If we don't make money this year we're going to
have to pack it in."

My suggestion?  Let it rest for a year; let the feeding frenzy die down.
Let the organizers pay off their credit cards.
Let people realize how much it means to them, how much they miss
it, and if the playa experience means that much, go ahead and do one
themselves.
Then, start again, maybe even on a different date, with word of mouth.
Redesign the Man (which people were planning to do anyway), and don't
try to make a huge spectacle out of it.  No bands, no raves, nothing
up on a stage, nothing that needs a generator to run, just the Man
and what people bring to him.  Keep the costs down, keep the spectacle
down, and maybe all the people who came because it looks like just another
night South of Market except with some nekkid chicks will skip it because
there's nothing there to consume anymore.  Back to the basics.

It's a nice thought, anyway, but as Fugazi said, "You can't be what you were,
so you'd better start being what you are."  I don't know if it's possible
to find the magic again without people splitting off and burning their
own Man, but it's worth thinking about.

hmmm....i've been ignoring most of the Flaming Dude discussion, since i
didn't go, didn't want to go, and anticipated spectacle.  so, i come to
this discussion/thread ~very~ late, having only dipped into a few posts.

grigsbeast post, along with diane's, are quite suggestive of the many things
that went on, as well as capturing the ambience.  i am reminded of my own
experiences going from rave consumer to rave helper.  while the Flaming
Dude may indeed be a wonderful thing, is this Flaming Dude the one and
only flaming dude that *can* be in the world, or is it possible for there
to more than one?  i think so.

if there can be more than one full moon rave going at a time, each 
contributing to the collective full moon rave, with every participant
happy and joined together mystically, it seems entirely possible that
many people could put together their own, smaller Flaming Dudes, and
those who want to put on a Flaming Dude Massive can do their flaming
thing, and everybody's happier.

I find it interesting that the ONLY objections I received to posting this
list have come from the San Francisco contingent of guys ....

Brian, I thought you knew me better than that.  I would never post anything
to this list that was intended to be deliberately inflammatory.  If offense
has been taken, I apologize, but I assumed that most guys on this list (and
girls too) would understand the spirit of fun in which it was intended.  I
receive my share of sexist and specifically redhead jokes here at work but
I am secure enough in myself to know that my co-workers aren't being
insulting to me personally.

Also, Brian, I bet if I had told you one or two of them to your face, you
would have laughed....

Ooooh,
Sfravers may come to Sac?!?!?  I'm not going to Liquid Groove (lack of $$ 
and I have to work on Sat. Morn) but if any of you come up a little 
early, we could go to coffee or something.  If interested, e-mail me and 
I'll give you my phone number.

Ok, so I've never been to a FMR.  Mainly cuz I live in Sac and work during
the week when they usually happen.  There was one that was in Sac and I
went, but since the music didn't start til 3:00 a.m. I ended up leaving
after the first song.  Anyway, if anyone knows if and where it is to take
place, could you please e-mail me and let me know (or call me at
916/452-4480).  This happens to be the only FMR I will have a chance to
attend for the rest of the year, cuz all the other Full Moons happen during
the week.  Thanks

the word "rave" has been used as slang for the last 30 years for: staying up all 
night and dancing. The only thing that has changed is that now we do it in 
the day sometimes too. I like the word, and I think if you are not comfortable 
with the worst thing someone can say about you... then its time to fire your 
Image Consultant!

If you don't like dancing then some of the other good things about raving 
may one day let you down. But as it is: rave culture has got the dance music 
thing goin' on... and you are allowed to dance in the most freakish manner 
one could imagine- someone might even hug you for it.

Perhaps there are some ways to capitalize and recapitulate the growing
popularity of the Burning-Man. 

I thought the event would make an ideal proving ground for 
Performance-Art/Theater students. Actually, I will be teaching a Visual 
Arts course online this year, and am considering incorporating a 
'field-trip' to the BM Event. Architecture/sculpture students could be 
assigned the problem of erecting a sturdy structure based on a single 
blue-polypropylene tarp.

I'd appreciate hearing more on the evolving structure of the BM; I still 
think it's uncanny how similar this year's effigy is to Nevada power-line 
towers.

it was kinda a nice break from all the burning man posts.

Well, you see, I'd never even been to the desert before.  I sat in the backseat
of our cramped car as we motored through the Sierras, squinting at my U2 Joshua
Tree CD, trying to get an idea of what the terrain would be like.  Cactus?  
Sand?  Scorpions?  I really didn't know; we don't have any deserts back east,
and I'd never been to Nevada before.  
I had dramatic visions of myself crawling across the desert floor in 110 degree
midday heat, hallucinating waterfalls and such, so I made everyone in my group
buy gallons of water at the ShopKo in Reno.  Armed with food, drink, supplies,
and anticipation, we left Reno at around 5 pm on Saturday (we had left Berkeley
earlier that day), and arrived at Black Rock Desert near sundown.  
	As we steered our nervous little Nissan off the highway and pointed it
towards some lights twinkling in the distance, I felt like we'd landed on Mars.
The landscape was *so* brilliantly different from anywhere else I'd been, the
sky was so much bigger (since the horizon line, in every direction, was so 
faraway), and the colors had been switched.  Instead of greens, bright blues,
and whites, nature had chosen rich red clay, pink dust storms, neon yellow
lightning bolts, and an orange moon.  
	We drove around in the twilight, trying to figure out where the rave
camp was.  All around us were tents, scaffolding towers, blinking lights, dusty
motorbikes, off-road pick-up trucks, campfires, and a glowing, enormous, statue
of a man, the burning man, and he was outfitted in blue and red tubelights.
	The scene was awesome in the truest sense of the word.  I felt a bit out
of place at first, but I was excited about getting into character.  I wanted to
be dusty, too, and I wanted some boots, and a cigarette, and smoke through my 
detergent-scented clothes.  We found the rave camp, and I hopped out of the car
and ran over to what I would later discover was the Gateway setup.  The first 
person I spotted was Jon Carel, my favorite DJ, and I asked him where everything
was.  "This is it!" he shouted.  "The main camp's that way, and Wicked is over
there..."   We talked about how beautifully strange everything was, and how it
felt as if we were in some post-nuclear war renegade camp.  I felt like I shouldhave been dressed up as a ravesoldier, or a fighter pilot, or something... I was
in the middle of a movie and I wanted a copy of the script.
	So my friends and I parked the car, pitched our tents, and went looking
for others that we knew.  I saw my friends Dave and Ben, who were huddling by a
fire eating food from tin cans, I saw my friend Reza, who I had raved with all
summer long, saw Claire and the Gateway crew, Fiona and Jenna and Jesse and Rona
and a bunch of other Berkeley ravers.  And I couldn't get over how -cool- every-
one looked!  Standing around in the desert, making tent repairs, planning shuttle runs to main camp, fixing dinner, sharing water and talking excitedly.
	I ended up dancing ecstatically that night, crashing in my tent at 
around 4 a.m., dusty and sweaty and blissed out.  I woke up an hour later to 
eat tiny bits of paper with my friend Joe, and we got to see the sun come up over the red hills on the eatern lip of the desert.  The morning music was pounding
good and hard, it was bright, warm, and just 9a.m. when our shirts came off,
sweat-drenched and mud-caked.  We floated through the rest of the day, lying in
the hot sun, checking out the main camp, and preparing for the final night.
At around 1 pm, a thunderstorm hit, turning the ravecamp into a muddy Woodstock.
People splashed around in the muck, and the bravest ones got completely naked 
and covered themselves in green mud.  Lightning came crashing down in big pitch-forks, (thank God none of us were struck, actually), and when the storm finally
passed over, you could see a skyscraping mushroom cloud and a double rainbow off
in the distance, and if you looked one way, you'd see a hailstorm, the other,
clear blue sky.  Reza said to me, "well, you'd never been to Nevada before, and
I still don't think you've ever been."  The Bay Area seemed orbits away.
	They finally burned the man later that night, and I heard a rumor that
some protestors planned on disrupting the ceremony, and for that reason, 
supposedly, the organizers kept everyone at considerable distance. It was still
a good showing, however.  I know that some American Indian tribes have burning
rituals, where the burning of statues and belongings represents spiritual 
cleansing.  I'm not sure if this is what the organizers had in mind here, but I 
liked my interpretation so I thought about it as I watched the fire.  
They also torched the "Langin"(sp.?) statue that night, which was clearly a 
sexual representation.  It was a phallic tower that had female characteristics
to it, but was still overwhelmingly masculine.  That was another thing about 
Burning Man--the festival, to me, anyways, had a very male quality to it.  I 
missed the sexual equality that most raves have (I'm not talking about the 
number of men and women present, I'm talking about the general attitude), but itwas an experience to see this type of setup, too.
	The DJ's on the last night, the ones from UltraViolet (a Dutch troupe
that spins hard trance), kicked my head in.  The music was relentless, and the
people dancing were appreciative of the tempo, too.  You could tell how much the
fun the DJ's were having--pounding their fists in the air, heads bouncing around
like a Jack-in-the-box, and smiles stuck on their faces.  
	It was Monday morning now, and we ended up leaving around 8 o'clock. It
was sad to drive away, and Jesse and I had said the day before how we had just
started getting used to be dusty, scrappy, desert-rave urchins.  I didn't even
want to take a shower anymore, and the trail mix, as long as you don't mind
raisins, was pretty tasty.  But we had stuff to do back in Berkeley, so we said
bye-bye to Burning Man and started the long drive home.
	For those who didn't get to go, go next year.  And the year after that.
It's one of those experiences that swims around in your head for a week after-
wards.  Also, hi to Brian McGonigle, who I saw on his bike but didn't get to
stop and chat with (and get a hug from!) and all other SFRavers who I didn't 
manage to say hi too.  Well, that was Burning Man out of my eyes--hope everyone
else had a sandblast as well.
	Love and double rainbows to all
	Timothy

Dear All;

	While I was at the most glorious of Sunset's of all, a friend 
asked me if I wanted to try a new drug called GHB. Having never heard the 
acronym before, I was curious and cautious for many reasons that will follow.

	They showed me what appeared to be a slightly mirky, but basically
transparent liquid. I asked him if it was just MDMA in a liquid form and
he assured me it was not. He said that the drug was a new SEX drug that
was all natural & made up of amino-acids that are produced in the human
body. 

	My immediate thought was OH, another Herbal(crap) E, or boy is
this going to be anti-climatic. Well, being the person that will try
almost anything once I purchased 3 capfuls for $10.00, which was ruffly
about a little more than a double shot. It tasted like watered down E, but
not as vomit provoking. I then went on my merry little raver way,
expecting not to feel anything except ripped off, or possibly sick to my
stomach. Cause we all know that every substance on the planet that is
worth it's weight as a mood altering substance has either been controled,
exterminated, horded, or sold by the Fed's; right? 

	NOT!!!, 15 minutes later WOW!!!!, I MEAN REALLY WOW!!!!!!, I 
cannot go into words that would describe the MANY wonderful feelings and 
sensations I experienced for over 3 - 4 hours. Keep in mind folks I'm the 
person who was interviewed by MTV, who got on camera saying to the Youth 
of the world, "Do the real thing", meaning Herbal E is hype, and do real 
MDMA. I don't like advocating the use of mood altering substances, but 
this one is worth some look at. Note, other freinds who took the drug 
experienced different feelings & sensations, which considering we are 
all wonderfully unique, is not surprising, however, everyone I spoke to 
said that it was fantastic. AFterword I didn't experience any type of 
hangover or aftereffects, it was like I didn't do anything at all. 
However some people did experience a very very deep sleep towards the end 
of the experience, how deep you ask, like we had to pick them up, and 
walk them around in order to wake them; that deep.

	If I had to describe what it was like I would use this analogy: 
MDMA is to GHB, as LSD or MUshrooms are to Mescaline. Different paths, that 
eventually take you to the same place. Nuff said.

	Cause this is a relativily new substance, and it's showing up on our
scene, which is one of the most connected(Internet) scenes in the world, I
would like to encourage people to share their positive & negative
experiences around this drug, with at least me, as this could both enhance 
life & save it.

	Precautions: Because it's a "SEX" drug, a very powerful one in my 
opinion, you should first try it around people you TRUST WITHOUT ANY 
DOUBT IN YOUR MIND. Start out with a small dose and work your way up, 
there will be many raves in the future for you to get really wild at. It 
comes in a liquid form, this should immediately tell you that this 
substance can end up in anything, like the soda that seemingly nice 
person just offered you. I say this cause one of our female friends took 
the drug, and ended up with someone she didn't want to or planned to be 
with. Both genders need to be careful around this drug, especially womyn 
who have been traditionally and almost exclusively the victums of rape, 
and non-consentting sex. 

	This is the most important, and most overlooked by people, new drug
precaution. Say you take GHB, and you have an allergic, excessive, or 
negative reaction, and you go to your local emergency room to get help. 
You tell the doctor I took GHB, and they look at you and say sorry I've 
never heard of the drug, we can't help you. THis can happen, cause is a 
new bootlegged drug. If it does make sure you take a healthy sample of 
the drug with you so that they can at least analyze it, cause once it's 
in your body, it's harder to do that, especially if they are just tring 
to keep you alive.

	GHB I feel will be around for awhile, if it doesn't kill anyone, 
and if the FED's don't get their hands on it. I however will try it 
again, until I either get tired of it, or have a bad experience, So enjoy 
yourself's and most of all USE YOU HEAD, DON'T LOSE IT.

I'm not real sure how to begin on this one, or even what prompted it.  I
guess it was after reading all the burning man posts.  I got to thinking
that most people here don't think of SFRaves as a mailing list.  Think about
it.  How many of you get on your computer, check your mail, and go "oh, it's
another SFRaves message."  At least for me, I get on and read them and they
make me all warm and tingly.  Even those of you who I haven't met, I feel
like I already know.  Those of you I have met have been the greatest people.
I know that most lists are sort of an information exchange.  Here, it's more
than that.  It's like a family.  After being on the list for a while now, I
feel like not only do I know what all of you know about, but also your
personalities.  I know you all as people, not as some lifeless voice that
floats out of cyberspace.
        Something that made me realize this happened about a month ago.  If
you hadn't picked it up from my massive sig, my passion in life is the 4AD
recording label.  It's music that moves me incredibly.  I had always heard
that there was a 4AD listserve out there and had always wanted to join.
"Wow," I thought, "I'll finally have a chance to discuss this great music
with others who feel the same way about it as I do."  When I finally did
find it a few weeks back, imagine my disappointment when all most people
cared about was whining about the label going downhill and having petty
arguments back and forth.  That's when I realized what makes SFRaves so
different.  People are generally positive and friendly, and even if they
have anything critical to say, it is usually of the constructive variety.
        A lot has changed in my life in the last 6 months, a good amount of
that because of the scene and _especially_ you guys.  You all provide this
positive energy that I've never, _never_ found so strongly in a group of
people.  I remember a few weeks back when my friend Matt posted something
saying he'd had a bad day, and not only did he recieve tons of email, but
about 4 phone calls on top of that.  It's great to see people reaching out
like that to others.  We tend to forget, but most people can't do that so
unreservedly. 
        So I just wanted to send BIG hugs out to all of you, and hope I get
to meet you all at some point.  And to those of you I've met, Brian D.,
Black Adder, Reagan, Brian M., Amy, Karen and anyone else I forgot, thanks
for showing me that friends from cyberspace can be more than just that.  I
feel the same way about all of ya, and with any luck we'll all meet up
someday.  That would make Jake a very happy camper :)

Love,
Jake

hi folks,

I'm looking for a place to live in S.F.; moving back to the city after a 
year in Oakland.  I'd like to know if any of you have any leads...my 
move-in date is October 1.  I'm 26,  quiet and generally easygoing, a 
lightweight rave-goer, and a musician, but with a lot of other varied 
interests.  I am very tolerant of different types of people and lifestyles.  
A single room is basically what I'm after, although extra work space or 
storage space would be a plus--I have a computer and some music gear, and 
have been working in the multimedia industry; most likely I will be working 
a lot at home.   Also, I have a cat--she is tidy and well behaved and has 
lived in apartments before.  As an extra potential bonus to future 
housemates, I have a couple cool, funky items of furniture that I would 
be sorry to see languish in storage!
Please feel free to contact me for more info, if needed.  
Thanks in advance for any help!

-Brian

Hello fellow sfravers,

After being a silent listener for six months, I am finally making my first 
post to sfraves. 

Before I begin, I would like to thank everyone for their incredible 
contribution to this list. I still cannot get over the amount of 
positive energy that this list generates. I know that I can always turn
to sfraves to have a smile put back on my face.

I was born in Australia and lived there all my life until moving to
San Francisco three years ago. I have absolutely no doubt that San Francisco
is the best city in the world. I have never met such positive, open,
friendly people. Discovering the rave scene a year ago, and sfraves six
months later has made life in this city even more incredible. I didn't think
that was possible but it is. Thank you all!

Now why am I posting? Well I need your help. I would like to attend my first
FMR this Friday. (Please let it be Friday night!) I am arranging for seven
or eight of my friends to join me. I have heard so much about this party for
so long now, but have never been able to attend because of work. Well this
time I'm going to be there.

However I do not have the phone number! If anyone can help, please email me. 
You will make seven or eight people very happy.

Thanks in advance.

Keep on smiling,

Scott.

You said it Jake.  This list totally floods my work and life environment
with positive energy.  I feel I've been changed in many ways since I joined.
I was seriously moved emotionally from reading your post.  Thank you.

This is a letter I am writing the friends we've made in the SFR community.

wayne

--

I had an awesome time at Burning Man.

I just can't put into words the things that happend out there that would
even remotely approach what happened, but upon leaving, we all felt like
it's changed us in strange, spiritual ways. Since I cannot assemble words
do justice to those feelings, I will not betray them with a verbally flawed
account. All I can say is that it was the best weekend of my life and I
simply just cannot tell you why. It was each and every minute, each and
every hour, each and every day we were there. Individually and summarily,
the moments were magical. I'll leave the 'overall' Burning Man experience
description to that.

---

I wanted to tell you that we are giving the SFR laminates out to show how
much we care about the scene and how much we care about all of you. We
really wanted to give something back to each of you individually and at the
same time bring all of us together. I think it's working. If you don't have
one yet, have no fear, There will be one for each and every one of you.

---

There's a couple specific events that I want share with you. It's just a
couple short stream-of-consciousness conversations that happened that I
hope affect all of you out there the way that they did me.

My friend Rusty is out there with us Sunday night at Burning Man in the
Wicked area, and he's experiencing a ravE for the first time. (Can you
think of a better 'first rave?!) Like all of us, at this point he is
totally immersed in the desert, the music, the vibe and the people.

I was off wandering around for a while dancing with all of you, then I
stopped by to see how he was doing and to give him his 'first' hug. In this
blissful state he tells me, "Now I know why you have to share this so
badly."

-

Then a short time later he asks Vince, "How long does this feeling last?"

and Vince tells him,    *"The rest of your life!"*

-

It's already been a few days, but whenever I think about or tell someone
this story, the power of those words words create this rush of emotions and
I get tears in my eyes.

I really hope it does the same for you.

That's why we rave.

	I don't mean to be a pantywaist or aguafiestas, but I imagine 
that the best way to 'use your head and not lose it' in the case of GHB 
is to _not use GHB_......  for the time being.
	Believe it or not, there are some benevolent institutions out 
there (perhaps not in the US) that will perform tests on the drug 
and publish their results without Fed involvement and propganda.
	So wait for more info.
	pleasepleasepleaseplease good friends be careful with this crazy shit!

	I didn't know River Phoenix, but I _do_ know you fellas--and it would 
destroy me to discover that a fellow SFRaver hurt themselves with some new, 
misunderstood chemicals.

It was pretty great.  Galen, Solar, Dervish & John Howard did a tag team
thing, switching off every 15 minutes or so, spinning some of the best
music (IMO) that I've ever heard at a Sunset.  Too bad my DAT crapped 
out.  It was very well attended.  The only blemish occurred due to a
small group of very drunk passerbys who decided to join us.  The cretins
stumbled about, littered their bottles, and generally enjoyed themselves
causing little trouble until one decided to get into a fight with his
girlfriend(?) and ripped her dress.  Someone called the police who
came and I guess took care of things.

$15  benefit to help pay off Pacific's soundsystem and some of the 
tickets they've received.  Call the Pacific # for more info.  Or Gateway's,
I think they're throwing it.

Just got off the phone with Vanessa K. of the Black Rock Rangers, who
informed me that clean-up is still in progress and there's a lot of work
still to be done. Gerlach High students are helping with recycling, but other
than that it's down to three guys (Michael2, John L. and Chris D.) and they
say they'll be lucky if they're done by Sunday. There are still THOUSANDS of
cigarette butts, firecracker papers, etc. to be picked up. 

If you are within striking range of the site, and have a few hours to spare,
PLEASE jump in your car right now and head out to help with the clean-up.
Bring a rake, a shovel, a dustpan, and a roll or two of trash bags. Unless
the BLM blesses this clean-up, we will NOT be allowed back next year. If you
care about this event, and if you can possibly find the time in your
schedule, GO NOW!

Hi everybody,

Finally got my Mac back together after dragging it out to the desert and back
(it was installed at the mysterious "Site 19" communications bunker deep
beneath the Playa), and finally got a chance to read all the great postmortem
commentary on this list. Allow me to chip in a few cents (a handful of
change, really) of my own.

1. COPS - The local authorities were on the Playa this year by invitation of
the Black Rock Rangers, and by all reports deported themselves in exemplary
fashion.  Did you see any drug busts, or for that matter any busts at all?
Did you ever see them hassling anyone? Questioning anyone? Searching anyone?
The "Mad Max" car and the dirt bikes should give you an idea what these guys
devote the bulk of their attention and resources to: search and rescue
operations. Luckily we didn't need them for anything else this year, but
think about it: if only one-tenth of one percent of a crowd of 5,000 is going
to consist of drunken, armed, irrational psychos, that's still 5 possible
murderers. Do you want to be the volunteer who gets to escort those 5 guys
off the Playa? Even if you've got a gun yourself and you know how to use it?
I didn't think so. Let's face it: at this size and scale, we need cops. Real
cops, with real badges. Luckily, the lawmen who came out this year had a
great time and want to come back. Danger Ranger invited them to join us in
the circle next year under the two conditions that they (1) decorate their
law enforcement "theme camp" in as outrageous a manner as possible and (2)
enter at least one participant in the fashion show. They readily agreed, so
if you're a serious cop-hater you might just want to stay home next time.

2. RANGERS - It's impossible to praise these folks enough. Working literally
around the clock, operating on a few or zero hours of sleep a night, a
handful of volunteers managed to handle just about every conceivable bad
situation with courage, style, and (usually) a sense of humor. Their motto,
by the way, is "Keeping the Playa Safe for Anarchy." They lived up to it, and
then some. Next time you see one of these heroes (and I don't use that word
lightly), you ought to get down on your knees and kiss his/her dusty boots.
Without their tireless efforts, this event would have been a disaster.

3. ATTENDANCE - We're still waiting for the BLM aerial photos for a better
head count, but the general consensus seems to be 5,000. Attendance didn't
double this year - it tripled. As far as making a profit, don't get too
excited. Yes, the BLM charges us for using the land, and it ain't cheap. Add
insurance, dozens of portajohns (emptied twice a day), printing, postage,
radios, construction, et al and there's not a whole lot left. And of course
not everyone paid - especially the late Sunday arrivals who left us nothing
but their empties and a lot of piss stains on the playa. As for the "Burning
Man tour bus with satellite dish," it's owned by Andy Pector, a successful
travelling salesman who lives in that bus most of the year and comes out to
the Playa for his annual vacation. The three main organizers - Larry, John,
and Michael - have two near-dead trucks between them. They've also worked on
this event full-time for most of the year, and maxed out all their credit
cards long ago supporting earlier desert sojourns that lost money hand over
fist. I sure as hell hope they made some money on this one. But even if they
didn't, you can bet they'll be back to do it again next year. The sickness is
deep in them, and there's no known cure.

4. WEATHER - For me, the squalls were the best part of the trip. How many
times in your life do you get to see a full double rainbow? Or a 50,000-foot
cloud structure shaped exactly like the mushroom cloud from a nuclear blast?
Mother Nature was most definitely in the house, and she treated us to some of
her most awesome entertainments. Next to that, any burning pile of lumber,
regardless of how charged it may be with symbolic portent and collective
expectation, is going to be a bore. Strap on as much "what it means" bullshit
as you like - at its heart, the BM festival is an extreme desert camping trip
in one of the West's most awesome wildernesses. Rain, dust, wind and mud are
integral parts of the package tour. 

5. MEDIA - Along with the general attendance numbers, media attendance
skyrocketed this year. And no, they weren't always cool. As Minister of
Propaganda (retired), I'll take part of the blame for that, but there's not
all that much blame to go around. For the most part, the 4th estate behaved
themselves, with nothing like the arrogance we witnessed two years ago with
that @#$%^& HBO crew. As far as the burn being staged for the media's
benefit, that's a lot of crap. This year's burn was more tightly managed for
safety and crowd control, period. But yeah, there were a lot of flash bulbs
popping. On the way home, in Bruno's, I talked with a couple of bow hunters
who watched the burn through spotting scopesfrom atop of the adjoining ridge
(did you see those pockets of snow up around 8,000 feet?), and they said the
thousands of blue flashes around the bonfire were really beautiful. Glad
somebody enjoyed them.   

6. RAVERS - The rave scene is nothing new to Burning Man, and vice-versa.
This year there was a much heavier presence for the Big Hat crowd, but any
notion that ravers are "corrupting" the event is just plain stupid. My only
complaints were that (1) too many ravers heard about the event through
non-standard channels and arrived unprepared for wilderness camping (Who
needs blankets? I've got X!), and (2) too many tried to crash the gate or
weasel their way in as "crew." On one shift at the gate, I had no fewer than
16 people claim to be "the main DJ" for Spazz. Next time, if we're going to
talk it up on the rave lists, let's make an effort to get the right
information out - that this is NOT just another rave event.  

7. GUNS - Who had an M-16? There were a lot of Chinese SKS's around, but I
never saw an M-16, or even an AR-15 for that matter. Too expensive for this
crowd. As far as the "survivalist" presence, I saw about 5,000 of them, some
better at it than others. Guns are a fact of life out in rural Nevada, and
the reason we pack so much heat at the gate is not to intimidate our fellow
campers, but to dissuade any two-legged coyotes from trying to make off with
our cashbox or dropping in to prey on all you visiting "hippies." Last year
there were bonafide pirates on the Playa - a gang in a 4x4 luring motorists
to their truck at night with a flashing light and then trying to shake them
down for cash. They didn't come back this year, and you can thank Big Joe and
his heavily armed friends for that.   

8. THE BURN - What's there to say? You either enjoyed it or you didn't. For
me, it represented nothing more or less than closure on another year's work.
I went back to my tent, enjoyed a little late-night supper with one of the
more arresting Black Rock Rangers (my wife Paizley Hayes, sporting a chamois
skirt and a fur-trimmed vest layered in keys and spent brass), and got my
first full night of sleep in weeks. And that, my friends, was a pleasure mere
words cannot describe.

I encourage all of you to keep using this list as a forum for critiquing and
discussing this year's event. Even if I don't have much chance to respond
directly, I assure you I will be lurking and listening, and that I will share
your comments and impressions with the core staff when they return from
policing up cigarette butts and firecracker papers. If you have comments or
suggestions specific to media/communications issues, contact me directly at
stumangrum@aol.com

One last thing - don't stress too hard about getting the dust off your car
and out of your stuff. It's impossible. Just think of it as carrying a little
of the Playa around with you wherever you go. Every time I open my trunk and
see that dust in the nooks and crannies, I'll think about Burning Man, and
about you. 

See you next year on the Playa,

Hello, sweet thing!

What a beautiful response to such a hopeful, longing, human question -
a while ago, the morning after the first ravE of two of my friends, we
talked about how beautiful the night was, the music, dancing, such surges
of pleasure, the joy of being in a place where everyone was simply HUMAN
and it
was enough - simply lovely, to be together...

They asked my boyfriend and I a similar question to the one your
friend asked Vince - wondering if it would always feel so wonderful and
right.

I did not quite know what to tell them - I mean, to me the answer
first seemed to wobble between "yes" and "no." At my first ravE - I
felt such a stunning joyous shock of "rightness" - like all my deepest
dreams and most delicate hopes had come true, and that all the love I'd
felt inside me for my whole life should NOT be buried in my heart, or
crushed down, or forgotten--it was beautiful and soft, both odd and
familiar, and natural as color and light.

That intensity of my "first time" has not been matched to this day.
But even as I write this, I hesitate - "is that true" ??  It seems
true only when I imagine my own existence within *time* - where there
is an imagined end, and a vague beginning, and where mysterious benchmarks
exist that I can hold memories up against, and compare them to.

But during each experiencE - I *can* feel that same surge of
hope, love, joy!  Where it seems to ebb is when my mind balks, and
struggles to lay its well-known "space/time" framework over my experience -
trying to evaluate it in comparison with others in the past, or with the
experiences of people around me, to try (who knows why??) to come up with
some sort of "definite" way to judge/rank/postulate an order...it's
merciless.

So damn funny, when, for me (with and without E), that "definite" so often
fades and becomes irrelevant.

To generalize a bit, it would seem that we humans (or hell, at least ME -
bear with me, I must need to imagine some company for myself, here)
have a lot of problems when we try to formulate our existence within the
framework of TIME.  We see time either on a llllooooonnnggg scale, extending
through the universe: in which case, we never seem to have enough of it.
Or, within this position of "scarcity", we compare one "time" to another -
as if we ourselves stayed constant, and "time" was the only variable...
so we can LONG for things in the past, and REGRET things in the past, and
PLACE EXPECTATIONS on the future.  We are shaping our lives *outside* the
moment; so time, then, though we spend a lot of "time" imagining it, does
not really exist at all.

That's why I think Vince's response is perfect - so often I ask myself these
skewed questions, then hate myself when I can't come up with the answers.
It's not a question of "how long" - our "time" is our LIFE.

Enough of my endless speculations, here's a bit of me:

I went to Burning Man, but did not meet you.  My mind was blank, blank as
the desert, filling with whatever happened, taking everything in.
I felt no desire to connect, though I walked by that cool V-MAR
truck & the SFRaves encampment many many times - I just wanted to exist,
without "human" verification, and sprawl in puddles of water and wet clay,
and crouch for cover from the hail, and smile at the clouds & rainbows, and

relish the thunder and lightning (god, I love a STORM), and discover the
graciousness of shade, and fix my collapsed tent for the 67th time, and sit
and bake on that flat-to-perfection lake bed and let the music drift around
me till it became inseparable from thought.

I enjoyed my dusty self.  I am lonely for that desert.

But, your letter made me cry - and tears are NOT the opposite of joy,
that loving feeling.  My tears helped me find words to share my lonely,
dusty love.  :)  :) :)

I send you love, outside of time, for that chance to be! here! now!

Rhea

Sorry for being so terse today, but everyone on this list should know to
check the Hyperreal FAQ archives for any questions on d-r-u-g-s.  I'll tell
you whatever misinformation I know(I havent' tried it):  GHB is a substance
naturally found in the human body once legally used by some as a sleep aid
and body building aid.  Generally found in a liquid state, a dose about a
capful.  It became popular for its e-like effects a couple years ago in LA.
Overuse and combining with alcohol and other depressants can possibly cause
seizures or even coma.  It can put you to sleep, making it a dubious rave
drug although some have used it with stimulants to good effect.  During its
LA heyday, alleged users included one B.I. (name changed to protect the
famous) who had to be taken to the hospital a couple of times after using
it.  Now in a legal grey area.  Phoenix may have taken it the night he died
for all I know, as a "natural" substance it's hard to detect, but with all
the other stuff that showed up in his blood, it would certainly be unfair to
blame GHB.  

Take it with a grain of salt.

Wow, 2nd letter of the day to make me want to cry from joy! ;)
I feel as you do, Jake.  To me, reading my sfraves e-mail is more than 
just "checking my messages".  It is getting in touch with real people.  
And not just *any* people - sfravers have *got* to be some of the most 
wonderful special people I have ever met in my life.  I never thought 
joining a rave mailing list could affect my life so profoundly!  I have 
made REAL FRIENDSHIPS as a result....something hard to find these days.
Someone (who shall remain anonymous) once told me I was making too much 
out of these internet contacts - I put too much of myself into it and I 
should back off a little.  That would have been the biggest mistake I 
could ever make.  You guys never let me or anyone down when we pour our 
heart and soul into our messages.  We treat each other with the respect 
we deserve and as a result, we can open up to one another without fear, 
and therefore get past the bullshit and go straight to the meat of the 
matter.  That is what *true* friendship is about.  Thank you for such a 
great post, Jake. I hope to see you again soon.

love,
Amy

hello all, especially amy-
i don't want to sound too cheese, interrupt the critical talk on GHB, nor
hop on the energy bandwagon, but i must thank all the existant sf-ravers
that have changed my lifeover the course of this summer and now, into this
school year.  y'all taught me real community, and just as importantly, how
to dance without being afraid of getting looked at funny.  thanks (sniff
sniff, tear drop=)

much peace and love -

No, it should not be buried again as the tingly sensations wear off and 
the e trip comes to an end.....those entities  (dreams, love, hopes and 
INSPIRATION) are *always* there.  The drug just made you more aware of 
their presence.  What Vince said is so true, once you see them again for 
the first time, you can experience them all the time without a drug.  I
take e to *enchance* what I already feel.  Now that you have been able to 
tap in to that energy, it doesn't just disappear like the e effects.

Welll......time is actually circular......there is no beginning, no end.  
Just infinity.  Where do our lives *really* begin and end?  (that is a 
whole nuther talk show anyway!)....The best way to get the absolute MOST 
out of life is to live it IN THE PRESENT MOMENT.  Don't compare now with 
the past - it already happened, so what difference does it make?  Do 
something NOW.   Don't worry about the future - it hasn't happened yet 
and the energy being wasted worrying could be used for something NOW.  It 
takes practice, but ever since I learned to live in the PRESENT MOMENT, I 
have been able to savor life with a new gusto.  Now, Rhea, I'm certainly 
not telling you how you should think - or anyone for that matter, I'm 
just saying what has been written in countless books and what I have 
experienced myself.  Maybe it will enhance your growth.  It did for me, 
and it made me not worry about the "rave scene being corroded" or things 
liek that.  This list is proof that the right vibe is alive and thriving!!

Hope to meet you someday soon.  Sorry for posting more than my share 
today...just so much to say lately I guess.....

love,
Amy

It's not a sex drug, it was used by body builders to bulk up before being
take off the market. It affects people in different ways - I tried it once
and just felt really stoned.

*DO NOT MIX GHB AND ALOHOL*

It used to be big in LA until a few people were hospitalized because of
mixing GHB, alcohola, and other drugs. The main contraindicated mixture is
with alcohol, however.

Yeah I  know this is late but, as many of you know, it takes a while to
integrate the experience, even now, my body has a cold or flu or
something which is a tell tale sign as I almost never get sick.  Some
say that these types of sicknesses are the personality's way of allowing
you to retreat from eveyday life so you can have time to integrate the
stuff that just happened to you.  Perhapse, or maybe it is the aftermath of
the alien abduction that happened on saturday night, or maybe it was
just having too much fun, or walking around barely clothed for three
days with temperatures ranging from 110 to 42 degrees, or maybe It's
just my time to catch a cold, I had one coming on about a week before
the Man burned.

After some confusion as to who was going where, I finally settled that I would
be going with my old buddy from back east Chris, his partner Rona, his sister
Mary Beth as well as Mona Love and Yashoda both of which are San Francisco Ravers.  The ETD was to be 1600 hours on friday.  I decided to take my car
(the beat-up CRX) in that it would be safer with me then anywhere else,
besides, it is on it's last legs and it has always served me well, It deserves
to attend the Burning Man before it is put out to pasture, I also decided that
it might be good to have some transportation out on the playa as it seemed
pretty certain that Chris and Rona (who can't stand rave music) would not want
to camp in the rame camp and Mona, Yashoda and myself couldn't be kept away :)

The contingent more or less left on time, I was late but did rendesvouz
with the van at the vista point on the far side of the GG bridge at 5 p.m.,
we took 101 north and cut over to 80 via 37, this allowed us to avoid almost
all of the rush hour traffic that was most certainly on the bay bridge.
The ride to Sacto was uneventful and eventually we pulled out and started the long ascent up the sierras, there was a minor panic near the summit when after
stopping for a while, my car started to overheat.  We stopped , I put more anti-freeze in and waited a bit for it to cool down, shit, I knew I shouldn't
have brought my car but OH Well, be here now... things cooled down but then I couldn't find the car keys, after about 15 minutes of searching , they
turned up in my fanny pack :). Boy a great start and I haven't ingested any drugs yet. The rest of the ride was smooth, I kept my eye on the temperature
gauge but it stayed within acceptable levels, we pulled into Reno and found
a gas station/ 7-11 store to tank up for the last 130 miles.
It must have been obvious from our dress, (and yashoda's piercings) that we
were from SF.  The young guys eyed Yashoda and Mona with part desire, part
awe, part fear, like the beautiful alien creatures that they are. I found this 
pretty amusing and I'm sure they both enjoyed the attention.  OK, we roll out
of reno with our gas tanks full ready for the last long haul. Driving through
the Nevada darkness, straight into the badlands, illuminated by half-moonlight,
the buttes and hills looked even more lonesome and erie. Finally, by around
3 a.m. we roll into Gerlatch (which is pretty dead) but I do run into my
friend melissa (who passes us as we stop to get our final berrings).  We head out to the darkness of the playa, after several miles  of travelling and
searching for the entrance we eventually find the "large white square"
which marks the turn off point, hang a left, go off road and are teleported
into a Seperate Reality...

i dont find it interesting at all. maybe perhaps most guys are really 
tired of this sort of thing, and are finally letting the women know this. 
you know, 30 years of male bashing, one does have to start standing up 
for things.

Oh, was Basics on last weekend?  Wish I'd been around, I could have told 
you it would have been crap before you went.  Remember, anybody that 
would rather go clubbing then go to Burning Man is not really on the vibe 
in the first place.  Time to ask yourself some deep questions if you ask 
me.

In reply to all this talk about the rave camp being out of sink with the 
rest of the festival and the Purple People Pushers not being into it 
because of it upsetting the balance.  To which I say: fuck the Purple 
People Pushers.  They were a small group of people, about twenty in all, 
whereas there were over two hundred people camped at the rave camp and 
about a thousand people came and checked us out over the weekend.  We 
were invited to participate by the organizers themselves where as they 
merely came on their own steam.  If you don't like raves fair enough but 
then go and camp some where else that is not 2/3 from the Rave camp; 
bloody idiots!  They were just out to cause trouble and should have got a 
smacking for their troubles.  I was right their when they complained at 
the SPAZ system and they were aggressive anal mother-fuckers.  Why don't 
they ban them from next years event instead of the rave camp?
     As far as the event itself goes both the rave camp and the main one 
were really good.  The Whicked system sounded so clean and smooth that if 
if sound was a solid matter it  would be like a new mirror.  Best song in 
Garth's set was Gangsters by the Specials.  But the thing that impressed 
me the most was all the effort, both financial, spiritually, creativity 
and sheer slog that people put into the entire event.  Every single one 
of them deserves utter and total respect from now until the end of 
time.  To mention them all would take an entire database but the main 
highlights were, for me, as follows.  Getting cruisified with President 
Rosevelt.  The swing on acid at the NYC playground.  A band called 
Beyond Race who played a kind of mix of trance, feedback guitar  and the 
most ammazing bass player I have ever seen; I mean this guy was 
unfucking believably good; he played a kind of mix between funk/rock 
and feedback and the whole effect blew me away.  Check them out at the 
next available opportunity.  The whicked sound system.  Riding my bike 
tripping in the dark to the rave camp on Sunday night.  The thunder 
storm.  Playing on Friday night on the SPAZ system as it was getting dark 
watching all the Cyberlab 7 crew and others coming into the festival for 
the first time.  The enire energy and flow of the entire event.  Next 
year is going to be even better.

Also,, I am leaving for a while; at least four months maybe nine.  I am 
going to Amsterdam first then to India to see the eclipse and to go 
traveling and to go to Goa for a few parties.  If at all possible I will 
try to send mail from their, probably around Christmas time when I am in 
Goa.  Thanks for putting up with in in the last year.  See you in a while 
or a twinkling of an eye.
Love and respect to the original hardcore,
TRISTAN.

Someone mentioned that the attendance of the Burning-Man event is
estimated from aerial photographs; any chance of seeing these posted? I
arrived on Wednesday and was intrigued by the manner in which the camp
grew. It seemed to begin in a concentric fashion around the area
sketched-in by those wire-flags; from there the growth seemed increasingly
sporatic with informal avenues developing independent of any axis. I
thought that a bi-polar (two centers) design would have encouraged a more
dynamic (less centrally congested) organization. A series of aerial photos
mapping the growth of the camp would be interesting...

My girlfriend says she tried it once and it made her sick, which

If any SFRaver happens to have taken any pictures of me.   I recall a few.
Please get them (or prints of them) to me ASAP.   I want to get them processed
for my WEB page.   I'm going "On-line" with it really soon now,   as soon
as I complete checking out all those rave related links I got from all you
Ravers with home pages.    I've got quite a few links up and running with
pictures (Thanx to Tom Bartolet in Canberra).

By the way,   check out:  http://www.woz.org

So what's up with Basics/Gathering??  I used to go to them all the time 
and LOVED them!  The vibe was great and the music moved me.  I haven't 
been to a Martin party since December (3 yr anniversary) and it blew me 
away I had such a good time.  What gives?

love,
Amy

Kevin, I've been reading things you post and replies you make for a 
couple years now, and have cut you tons of slack, but I am *over it*.

You never seem to have much positive to say -- but you appear to be a 
veritable wellspring of worthless negativity.

Seeing your shitrain descending on to one of my posts makes me ILL.
Certainly you ought to post whatever you like to sfraves -- but just 
don't attach it to a post of *mine*.

No, I didn't attend Burning Man. I have physical problems that make 
attending even a single night's event something I will have to pay for 
all the next week; I have also had to be hospitalized for heatstroke twice.
Not all of us CAN go to things like BM, you dumbass!

But considering the source... what should I expect from a guy who 
publically defended the "right" of some asshole buddy of his to keep my 
girlfriend's stolen video projector.

I think you need to sit down and do a little deep thinking of your own.

I guess you were never at main camp or something; I was camped about 1/3
mile on the _other_ side of center camp from Wicked/SPAZ and the raves 
were very loud even where I was, especially when the wind died down.

_Am_ I an idiot?  Sure about that?

As opposed to you, Mr. "should have got a smacking" Keiper?  Check your
mirror, dude.  Sheesh.

> Why don't

A couple of "them" were rangers, key organizers, and other people who had
been there all week trying to make this happen (I know who you're talking
about).

Normally I ignore this sort of BS but your uninformed negativity really
honked me off.

They did that this year. A Fri and Sat night at Artist TV Access on Valincia.
Drumming Ambiant Music and a B.M. film fest. They'll probably do something like it again next year.

Yes, he played it as part of his incredible set on Saturday night. It
was definitely a remix in the rave/house vein -- NOT the original. It
really was a boppin' toon and i'd love to hear it again. Skankin House!
I even felt like singing along because i was really into the Specials
in my "mod/punk/new-wave" days in high-school (while everybody else was
listening to REO Journeywagon and Def Zeppelin)... Gee that should date
me now shouldn't it?

PS: It's great that all the burning man wicked attendees now treat each
other like friends. Saw a whole bunch of BM folks at Come/Unity the
other night and even the people that I didn't have a chance to meet at
BM (but saw around) were coming up and introducing themselves and
reminiscing about how great it was...

I tried GHB about 2 years ago at Boogie Buffet and hated it. I nearly 
passed out -- couldn't stand up, much less dance. Once this initial fun 
wore off, these electric current-like sensations started shooting from my 
shoulder down my arm. I completely lost control of my hand, which was 
spastically opening and closing on its own. I had had a beer before 
taking GHB, which probably exacerbated my reaction. A friend who also 
tried it passed out completely and had to be carried out of the club. My 
personal bottom line on this drug is *don't*. I really think it's 
dangerous.

My $.02 worth.

My 2 cents on GHB:
	I have avoided this one because is seems to have a very sharp 
dosage response curve.  That is a little can be fine, but a little more 
can be dangerous or even fatal.  Considering that the strength/purity of 
any street drug is always questionable, it seems the wise thing to do with 
this one would be to avoid it all together.  
	As for weight lifters using it, I believe it is used in small 
dosages to offset the agressivness etc. that are common side effects of 
the other steroids they are using.

	
	Very glad to hear that there will be a Wicked this weekend... see 
ya there!

smiles,
Andrew

This comment shows complete ignorance of the history of the sexes and a
predisposition toward sound-bite logic. For how many thousands of years have
women been the targets of oppression? That 30 years of "male-bashing" have
somehow given (white) men a perspective and understanding of this history is
the height of revisionist ahistoricism.

Count me as a woman who also finds these jokes objectionable. Bashing is 
bashing, no matter which way it goes. I believe we owe men the same 
dignity and respect we ask for ourselves.

i don't think 'bashing is bashing'. there is a difference between bashing
and humor. that difference is intent. there's being snide and insulting
and hurtful, and there's having a laugh with no malice intended.the line
is a fine one, but in this particular case it's apparent. karen obviously
did not intend to bash, or she wouldn't have posted those jokes to this
list. she intended to make you smile and laugh and give you a chuckle. 

the stereotypes in those jokes exist wether we like it or not, 
and while agree that it's the jokes like these that perpetuate the 
stereotpyes, it's those stereotypes which makes these jokes funny. can't 
you look past the stereotypes? sure, we all know some men who have one or 
more of the qualities that those jokes made fun of, but there is noone 
who is completely tailored after them. am i making sense? i laughed at 
these jokes (even though i had heard them before). i'm not ashamed for 
laughing at them. who cares? am i an asshole for laughing at them? i 
don't think so. considering me an asshole is just another stereotype 
isn't it? people who laugh at insulting jokes like that *must* be 
assholes because those jokes aren't funny. it's all pretty ridiculous. 

hmm. this has gotten messy. i always end up babbling. 

my point is (i suppose, in a roundabout way), if you can't laugh at 
yourself, why bother laughing?

What do people think of Technics slip mats?
I'm buying my 1200's tonight, and I can get two slip mats(technics) for $15.
Is this a good deal or should I go out and look for Wonka slip mats?

I'm also getting an MTX MX-35 Mixer.   Anything I should know about this
item good/bad?

The whole package deal is $850:

1. Two SL1200MK2's with cartridges and stylus' (tables are used, but went
through a
     2000hr. recalibration, brake adjustment, etc. check up.  The
cartridges(500AL) and
     stylus' are new)

2. A new MTX MX-35 Mixer in the box

3. Two  new Technics slip mats

4. 90 day warrenty

It souned like a good deal to me, but I'm just a beginner.  So what do you
all think??????

And thanks for your responses in advance!  =)

One happy camper

feeling a bit overly PC are we?

lets take a look at china and the chinese, shall we?
how long has there civilization lasted? about 7000 years or so, with 
things staying the same. women have always been "oppressed," yet things 
just seem to have worked for them. now you tell me why in the past 30 
years this country has gone down hill and is on the brink of a civil war?
but take a look at china. things are the same as they were 7000 years 
ago. (except for the communist dynasty.)  now why is that so? when the 
women in china are "oppressed" and have no "freedom" but they [chinese] have 
maintained a very high statis in the world. how long have we been a 
country? about 200 years, yet what we are doing is telling everyone that its 
ok to pick and bash on men, and everything will just be peachy king?
in the past 30 years, what has changed with this country, and why is it 
falling apart? i do agree that both sexes should be equal, but telling 
women that its ok to pick on men (which is what you have done) because us 
big bad white men are just horrible people and we just dont understand a 
thing, and the only way we'll understand is if women pick and bash on us, 
and then everything will be just fine. i think not. 

i dont care if everyone on this mailing list hates my guts because i just 
dont understand things in the world like everyone else that is so 
enlightened, but i do feel that i can express my opinions, and if 
everyone is going to get on my case about wht i have to say (this is the 
second time now) then this country is turning into a liberal totalitarian 
sociaty.

dear iLYUSHiN-
hey!  woah!  easy there conan!  i agree with you, but anger and personal
stuff doesn't work.  no offense was meant, and we must remember that.  in my
religion, forgiveness is the one of the highest goods.  sor forgive those
who you don't agree with.  and then go to a rave and dance with them.


peace, love, and more love -

i thought the jokes were fairly benign.  things are fine in china ?  
hmmmmm.

but where did male bashing originate ?  probably from the explosion  
of social and economic freedom that women now have that they did not have
a few decades back; its the backlash from their liberation from male 
oppression in general.  it's understandable.  it's inevitable.  it will
pass.  what's the big deal ? 

does it mean we cannot stand back and laugh at male stereotypes ?
i can laugh, cause anyone that treats me in a stereotypical fashion 
i do not take seriously anyway.  in a like manner, i dont take the
jokes seriously, or personally.  i am comfortable enough with myself 
such that i can poke fun at myself. i can recognize the grain of truth
in the joke that is an exageration.

I don't know anything about China, so I have no response for all that. I do
think aspects of China are lame, though, however well their system is doing.

Because I talk straight, you assume much. I didn't say "picking and bashing"
was the only way for "big bad" white men to understand. I didn't even say
abuse or aggression was a possible way for anyone to understand anything.
But if you can't take a little ribbing without falling all over yourself,
then you've got an even longer way to go before you have any idea of what
these people have been through.

Your reasoning is typical of those who would mistake a simple change of
heart for the harsh realities of society. You are a man,  and (y)our kind
has done some pretty odious things to women over the years. You are born
into history whether you like it or not, and sweeping that history under the
rug, saying that "It wasn't me, man," and "well I'M not prejudiced," ignores
these facts, these political and economic facts, and that because you've
come to this conclusion, nothing more needs to be done. Sorry to have to be
the heavy for ya, but these are the forces that produce lists of man jokes
that everyone here is up in arms about. If you ask me, as a middle class
white man, we deserve the abuse. It might be nice to think that because my
tiny little world in my head holds no hatred or stereotypes, that I'm "a
righteous being," that the world only has to do the same before these
problems are eliminated. But it's an all too romantic notion that is easily
swept away walking into any bar or strolling aroung sixth and Market in SF.
Hey, I'd like to believe it too, but that isn't the way it is out there, you
know, in the real world.

eh

Brian,

     I tried to post this to the list but it got spit back at me.  If you
could pass on just the info that say to look for the article I would
appreciate it.

Thanx         Tamotsu



Hey gang,

      GHB is not new it has been use by bodybuilders to promote muscle
developement and fat burn.  It has also been used as a sleep aid (which is why
those people were so sleepy).   Anyway,  GHB raises the level of some  happy
little chemicals in your brain that  are produce naturaly.   There was a
article on GHB that was posted to the list last year or so that can probly be
found in the SFR archieves.

      It is very fun and has pretty much no hangover.  The most important
thing to remember if you plan on experimenting  DO NOT USE GHB WITH ALCOHOL AT
ALL NOT EVEN ONE STINKING BEER!!!!!!!!!!

    

    Hope this helps...          BE SAFE


Tamotsu

Oh spare me the guilt! That's a tired, feeble and nonresponsive
attitude, unless of course your purpose is to get laid by a feminist
... :-) In which case, go for it dude! (Hi five! Wink Wink, Nudge Nudge
Say No More!! :-) :-))

Guilt never got no-one nowhere (trust me on this, I'm jewish :-) :-)).
More importantly the self-flagellation that you are proposing
diminishes the greatness of being male, and makes all male attributes
undesireable, when only some are. Effectively by denying any good in
maleness, you are casting out the baby with the bathwater.
 
Men have evolved long and hard (ahem...) to attain some of these "male"
attributes (that of the hunter, the farmer, warrior, builder, and the
travoltaesque disco machine) and these are genetic lessons that must
not be lost. We can teach these lessons, and be taught the female ones
(the nurturer, the moral/decision core of the family [in many cultures
at least], the arbitrator, the peacemaker, and the get-me-on-the-
guest-list-queen). And be proud of all of them, relishing masculinity,
relishing femininity, and loving the diversity and the differences.

Finally, you shouldn't confuse "maleness" as a gender from the 
social/moral/economic forces that force males and females into awkward
positions in western dominator-oriented industrial culture. This
culture is noticeably dysfunctional from a number of perspectives, not
only just gender -- so why not put the guilt/blame/shame on the source
of the problem?? Certainly the role of males and females is more fair
(not equal, just fair) in agrarian, tribal cultures that have not been
touched by industry, christianity, money, property, 9-5 workdays, etc.

It's stupid to harp on equality. The species will continue, children
will be born, and women will continue to bear children. That right
there is a root of inequality that you have to come to grips with. And
it means totally different roles for men and women.

A western-culture progressive male needs cast away shame of the past
and think towards the future. Think about what's right and wrong, fair
and unfair, and attempt to do the right thing for the *SPECIES* and the
*PLANET* as a whole. Once you take on a gaian attitude of the whole, it
makes the "right" direction much easier to perceive and act on,
independent of the past, and looking towards only the present and the
future.

No way baby! Crucify me now for all those past sins. For I am white and
male and wracked with guilt, a feeble worm of immense pathos. Grind me
on the asphalt with your stilleto heel, pour salt on my wounds, and let
me writhe in agony! Oh yes, do me, yes yes yes!

Wake up and smell the tofu! It's the future already!

If you like HOUSE MUSIC check out Stompy Stomp at King St Garage.
Unfortunately I won't be going because all of my friends are either out of town

I tried a quarter hit onse and found it interesting and maybe even fun.  
The people who gave it to me confirmed the problems with dosage.  I don't 
think(from what I read on hyperreal) that fatality is a big concern, but 
it seems that a slight overdose often knocks out the imber for a few 
hours.  definately not what you want to have happen at a rave.

as with all drugs(especially one as poorly documented as this one)  be 
careful.

I've finally recovered enough to clear all the mail from my box, I failed 
to read the innumerable rewievs of the event, etc etc  so...


I had an absolutely wonderful time, I wish I had met more of you.

Love goes out to Seth, Amy, John, and any unnamed sfravers I met there.  

your mailing list is killing me, nwraves gets like 1% of this traffic, 
but I'll stay on anyway.

I see no need to review the event, y'all are much more eloquent than I in 
your reviews, I just hope I can meet more of this community in the (near) 
future.(hmmm, I could fly down over Christmas break :)


Much love, and please stay as wonderful a scene as you seem to be now,
Patrick

oh come now !  thats crazy :)

of course you have to acknowledge the past, but you need to learn from
it and move on.  to say you deserve the abuse is to state that you yourself
feel inferior for societies past attitudes and should not be treated with
equal respect.  feel proud with who you are, and love everyone !

thats right !  you need to feel clean, holy, and blessed going in, and 
not have the actions of others, past or present, attempt to corrupt and
snuff it out.

really, why should i bear the cross for the actions of others ?

 Actually , looks like it'll be much better here in the S.F> Bay area 
for a couple of days - clouds! Yeah! Days of boring cloudless skies are
such a drag - too hot as well!

 I hope that Sunset will be happening tomorrow , because my nephew and
niece are in the area for a few days , and I'm sure they'd love to
attend! I may even give them the FMR info , if I can get in touch with
them in Sunday night/Monday morning [ and I get the info in the first 
place , of course ].

 Oh yeah - they are both over 18 ,  but under 21 years of age. What events
and club stuff happening this weekend will they be able to attend? ( I
should study the SFR calender in more detail ... ).

If anyone living in Marin is planning to catch the Sunset benefit party
this evening and has space in their car,   I could really use a ride.

I live in Mill Valley,  but COULD also meet in SF somewhere along the
GG Transit #10 bus route.    According to the info,   they have a map
point,   but don't know how close it would be to the bus route.

Thanx
Crunchman

Well,

Id have to say that this event hath inspried me in two or three ways...

One: Hold nothing sacred....  When I brought my items to 
Lett uS Dance (ie shoes, water, and lotsa smiles) I knew well that the H2O
would become the communal drinking jug.. (the shoes?? well, I reclaimed them
later on that night...) which was fine, since there were sooo many of Us
dancing in the frenzied state that we were in... 
Just dancing with soo many of  US, thoses in the scene, kept my belief that
we, as a community could do nothing but Grow.. accepting the next generation
of Dancers, Dj's and music...

Two: Although feeling ever so happy and trippy and dizzy et. al.
There was one thing that I did notice amongst the crowd and the place...
 This was the seemingly  noticeable through the change of "sets" that  the
DJ's from other 'camps' would throw up a little addititue here and there
(although it coulda been me too, I did go thru a bit of a paranoid stage
during the event myself).  However, if this was the case, Please people,
leave the 'fronting'  at home (ie. Yourpad@home.org).  All that frowns and
stern looks do is instigate fights and police, I know i've seen many
happen....
About the Place: I think it couldn't of been at a better local (since Ive
adapted my dancing style to sand and beachrocks...).  But, as day broke I
noticed all of these beat, worn down cardboards, which was no real problem
 since it is pyro-consumeable.  However, the plastic bottles I saw strewn
everywhere was indeed a sad sight to behold...  I know I can't lay blame
since I'v'e been culprit for many years too.  But to atone for my sins
against mother earth I've decied to take this oath:
        I (My Name)___  Do solemly sewar that wherever I happen to end up
finger snappin', Rump shakin', leg stompin', rug cuttin',  and spinning
around generally in madness, That amongst the other Neccesities that I may
bring to any Undergrounds (Ie flashlight, Battries, map et. al.). There WILL
be an empty plastic 10 (or 5) gal. trash bag to pickup such needless litter
that was so needful when water or other chemically derived compounds was
occupied in it.  And futhermore understand that Although I may get really,
really strange looks from others as I put a bag of useless trash in my car,I
will be content. Knowing I have Done my duty to respect the ground I dance on
& ravers I dance with...

Despite these lil' pratfalls the event was a smashing success. I recieved
plenty 'O' names (Again, all escape me now...)  A specal "Hiya" to thoses
campfire dudes from San Mateo, tha guy sining the CHiPs theme to his feamle
siginficant other, that Cute asian gal by the speaker, thoses two other gals
I think I talked to & Mars for a good set (and Tom too I believe...)...

Smile O meter Ratings:

Vibe:  Trippy trancy Madness 
 9Smiles....

Dance space: funny to see that people are brining thier own "dance floor"
 (ie. cardboard boxes) but, I perfer contact w/the earth I dance on 
8.5Smiles

Lights/visuals:  after getting accustomed to everyone looking like radiation
victims it wasnt too bad 
8Smiles

Location:  As the saying goes... "Getting there is an adventure in itself"
 Directions were Pretty Crazy 
 7Smiles...

Frienship Potental: I believe this rating in itself depends on the person(s)
initiating it... Although I did see guys chasin' E-babies and doing what they
knowingly or unknowingly do.
On the other coin I also saw pleasent conversation and general acceptence
with strangers-turn-freinds just ploping down and chatting.
8Smiles

Overall:  8.1 smiles

In closing (about time, eh?),
I'd like to believe this, the scene, is all about communicating w/each other
and becoming closer because of it.  A common thread that unites us all
(almost like this post)...  And although I know that This message is
probabaly being read by less than 10% of the actuall people in attenence I
feel if I touched any of you then all this scatterbrain-bandwith-consuming
Eline then something has been achieved.....

-Dancing, weaving, catching a hug in between. Still free.-
Adam 

P.S. 
BTW, I was the one in the Blue shirt, torn grey pants, and an X cap....
If you see me next time, yank me from the dance floor and say howdy....
 C-ya @ the Sunset Benefit...

Oh come on, I think you're exaggerating a little, I saw maybe a couple of "jocks" at the most.  I thought it was cool that there were so many diverse types of people there - even people I normally wouldn't have a lot in common with.
Why don't we just put a velvet rope at the entrance to the Playa, and only people you approve of can get in ...

 It is still a TAZ of tremendous
magnitude, but the burning is almost anticlimactic, just another
spectacle amidst the crowds of Bud-swilling jocks who don't understand
why people who aren't 300 pounds and carrying a nightstick get to tell
them to move out of the way or they'll get killed by an M-100.
  Most of all, I miss that sense
of unity and purpose, where the Man burns for all of us and not just as
another distraction for the beer-swillers wandering around looking
for "nekkid chicks".  It was beautiful, and I miss it.  I'm not even sure
I'll go next year.

Has anyone managed to get info on the locale of Schwa is Happening?
I know it's a little late, but I was expecting to be able to find
out what we need from their hotline. No such luck. Their mailboxes
are all full.

Please.  I specifically noted that you can't do that, and that things
change, and move on, and such is the way of life.  This was, however,
the first year that I saw *any* people walking around with beer during
The Burn, and several were giving me serious attitude as I attempted to
move back as per the wishes of the rangers.

Let me tell a short story:

Rewind to two years ago.  There are about 800
people on the playa, roughly 1/6 as many as this year.  It is the night of
the burn, and we are all painted, costumed, and readied as usual.  The sky
is growing cloudy and ominous as the sun sinks beneath the mountains.

We begin the procession to the Man, drummers (including me) in a loose cloud
of rhythm near the center.  We reach the Man, and the beat picks up as we
circle around him, and we can feel the pressure dropping as our energy
increases.  The drums pound louder, the massive booming heartbeat of the
Man, of us all, arms upraised towards the electric sky, ready to die.  

Lightning flickers and arcs in the clouds above.

Someone with a torch lights the Man's legs on fire.  The rhythm grows hotter, 
faster, as we feel the exquisite pain of the flame licking upwards, over
the legs, up the torso, up the arms.  No fireworks, just the zap of neon
tubes popping in unison with the electrical storm overhead.  I cannot
take my eyes off the Man, and neither can anyone else in our group of
demon drummers; we are a fragile vessel of energy, discharging its potential
in our frenzy lest it build up in our limbs and organs and set us aflame
along with the Man.

Electric snakes snap and coil across the sky, sometimes touching earth in their
convulsions.

Just when I think I must break from the tension, the Man, weakened,
succumbs to the fire, and falls.  We rush in as one to come as near as we can,
to catch the energy from his burning body, screaming in triumph and shock that
we are still alive --

and the storm opens its black heart to us.  The dust hits in a choking wave
of dry grit, wind blowing so hard it seems to be driven through my body.  The
rain comes in hard cold spatters, almost painful in its velocity, but I cannot
feel it.  We have not stopped drumming, and we have not stopped dancing, and
we welcome Nature to the ritual, booming electric snakes and all.

This image will remain in my mind forever: drumming next to the fallen corpse
of the Man, lightning striking around us, the dust and rain blowing so hard
that all I can see is leaping silhouettes dancing around, over, and through
the wind-whipped flames.  To some people, this is a classic conception of
Hell.  I laugh manically, and keep drumming until the storm dies down and
the Man is an unrecognizable pile of embers and slag.

===

Now do you see why I might permit myself a little nostalgia?  Conspicuously
absent from this event were:
-crowd control measures (beyond showing people where the Man would fall; no
 lines of people with flares and event T-shirts)
-non-participants, defined as "people holding beers/cigarettes instead 
 of dancing"
-so many people that many had to sit down so you could see what was happening
-many competing groups of drummers, none of which were together with each
 other, or often even themselves
-the feeling of watching something from a distance (necessitated by the
 sheer numbers of people) instead of being a participant
-those wimpy 10-minute storms that were over before anyone could really
 start panicking >;^)

As I said before, the Burning Man means something different now: a gathering
of the tribes, a three-day TAZ in a beautiful place, a freakfest of amazing
scale and diversity.  The ritual that was key to my experience can't be the
same anymore, though, which is the cause of my wistfulness.

Oh well -- guess I'll have to build my own someday or something.

Although this was my first year, and I think that alcohol gets a bad rap 
because of the stupidity of some imbibers, I definetely agree with this 
observation. I saw A LOT of people with attitudes, yelling things like 
"just burn the fucking thing,", grabbing asses, etc. which really detracted 
from what was trying to happen. I too am all for diversity, and was glad to 
see people from so many walks-of-life that helped add to the experience. 
However I don't think the cretins interfering with everyone elses' 
experience added anything positive to it. As I said before to these folks, 
there's always Beach MTV reruns, and it's a lot cheaper too.... ;)

I just wanted to share this, I wish all you (myself included) can see my
heart right now. I can feel it and it has a smile on it a mile long. As I'm
dubbing some tapes a DJ friend gave me (BioJeff) I caught myself getting
goose bumps and beginning to dance in my living room. I have the people
across the way staring at me through there window( the whole family it looks
like) the music is sorta loud, is probally why there looking but I'm just
dancing away as they look at me with there mouth open. and all the while I
have a big smile as well as my whole body. And I LOVE it. His sets have a
great impact on me that you could not believe. The Day my wholE lifE changed
and at thE moment it did, I was listening...back up I should say FEELING the
music he was spinning, now when ever I hear his sets I just break down. I
feel he it really great at the turn table and I'm glad I know him...
 
This is for Justin...I told him about Selections(now Jo Jo's) on thursdays
that play House, I can't remember you E-address, just wanted to tell you that
your in for a treat.
 
I just thought I'd share that with you, I'm getting back to the living room
now to put in another tape and SMILE my heart away.
 
PS..Hope to see some of you at the Sofa Street Fair...I'll be wearing a strip
shirt with mostly green in it, blue pants black boots, Blonde hair with a
brown GOO-T. I'll be at the World Stage where Spun with spinning and a few
others.

I know this is not supposed to be a personal ads forum, but I'd like to 
introduce myself.  My name is Rikki and I used to go to raves a few years ago 
but got out of the habit for awhile.  I started going again this summer and 
can't remember when I've had such a blast!  I've been reading over the postings 
and feel absolutely elated and overjoyed that there are so many people out 
there digging the scene.  It truly warms my heart that I have found these raves 
and an open minded forum where people share their experiences and feelings.   
It makes me ache to meet some long-lasting friends who enjoy the same things I 
do.

Anyway, I love raving but I have a hard time finding people to go with because 
I just started going recently and haven't made tons of connections, and because 
my friends say they can't keep up with the energy so they don't like to go as 
often.   Also, even though I can dig hangin' out with youngins', I'm 28 (not 
that that's old, just a different space) and, although I find it easy to meet 
people in general, I find it hard meeting dependable people a little closer to 
my age, interests, mind set,  etc., (not that I don't party down and dance 
non-stop like the rest of 'em).   I believe in having friends of all ages 
(respecting who they are as a person, not how old)  but I'm looking for 
something a little more substantial and long lasting than what I've had with 
the "younger crowd" in general.  

Unfortunately, I've had a few experiences meeting people at raves where there 
seemed to be a real connection but it all turned out to be superficial and 
disappointing because, beyond the scene, we didn't have much in common.  It 
made me feel that it was due to an age gap or the drugs talking, but I'd hate 
to think that was the case.  I'm really hoping that's not just the nature of 
these people and parties.  Don't get me wrong, it's mostly positive and I've 
had some great times meeting awesome people and that's what keeps me going and 
interested.   So,  I have nothing but respect and love for these raves and the 
people, and I'm not dismissing younger folks, just looking for people with 
similar or complimentary lifestyles, experiences, ideas, maturity, etc.

Love ta hear from ya!

Peace, love, friendship and dancing!

Rikki :-)

After two years of searching, I *finally* landed a copy of "Love & Energy"
(Zeony Lee Experience) which I'm sure many of you remember from the
Connection II tapes!  It was in the "recently received used" bins at
Exotique Records in Seattle (just to give credit where it's due).
I also got a sealed copy of "Phuture" there (I guess Trax has been
reissuing or at least releasing a bunch of their old stuff lately),
so if you ever happen to be in town check it out, it's at 3rd and
Battery.  DJ Masa who also has a new release out is one of the people
who works there.

I can't tell you how hard I looked for Love & Energy.  I actually came
within five minutes of landing it at Ameba, just after someone had
put it in their "buy pile" a few months ago :)  It was a popular track
and I'm sure I could have ordered it from one of the distributors, but
that kinda takes the fun out of it (although I will admit I finally
broke down and put an order in for Wink's "Meditation Will Manifest"
which somehow I lost a while back, though I still have the sleeve).

So . . . . yay!!!

It is completely ironic that I was just thinking about this exact same
subject when your message popped on my screen. The "scene" where I live is
practically dead. It is so hard to meet people in this area who are even
remotely interested in enduring 10 hours of driving to go to a single
event. I wanted so badly to go to Liquid Groove in Sacramento on friday,
but not *one person* here in Reno was interested in going. (Just for the
record, I *really* wanted to drive to SF for Schwa is Happening, but Sac
is 2 1/2 hrs closer.) Now, as I wade through my mail, I find out that not
only were many sfravers planning on going, a few I met at Burning Man even
offered me a place to sleep! 
The people here in Reno are only interested in going to the large venue,
vibeless, unpersonable events. I am completely the opposite.  I couldn't
even talk any of the ravers here into going to Burning Man, if that says
anything. About 15 of them, though, drove out on Sunday night for the
final night of Wicked after they heard how good it was.  They missed the
entire *experience* of Burning Man. When I tried to explain this to them,
they thought I was crazy. If you went to Burning Man or read sfraves last
week, you probably know what I mean by this. 

Anyway. My whole reason for explaining all of this is so that you can see 
that I understand exactly where you are coming from. 
True friends are very rare and far between. 
Especially friends who rave, too. :)
Raving is more to me than just going out and dancing-- it's a way of life.
A way of living. Perhaps even a religion, if I were dare to use the R word.
It's not something I take lightly, and it pains me to see others taking 
everything for granted. Especially when they go around treating each 
other so badly and continue to spout rave spiritual idealisms without 
giving them any thought. I truly believe that PLUR and the energy 
experience are a big part of it all; whereas the people here think it's 
about who has the groovest shoes, who can do the most drugs, and who 
knows the most DJs. AHHHHHH! 

There seems to be a growing lack of respect not only for each other, but
for the kind spirituality and enlightenment that raving originly brought
about. No one can make the determination if someone is a raver or not, 
(or even determine what the definition is!) but I think this change of
focus has been having a big effect on what's been happening in the scene
as a whole lately. 

I'm sorry to go off like this, and I hope that no one considers it wasting
bandwidth, but it's something I've really spent a lot of time thinking
about over the past two weeks. 

You're definitely in the right place for meeting some really special people.
Sfraves is very unique, and I think everyone holds it very near to their 
hearts. I *never* thought I'd be if for this or make as many good, true 
friends and I have over the past two years.  

If you ever want to go out and have a blast, I'm up for it if you are!!
It's just a matter of finding someone here to drive down with me, and for 
us Renoites finding somewhere to stay for the weekend.

I may take a lot of this stuff extremely seriously, but above all it's
about the people and about having FUN!!!! :) :) :)
Hope your day is wonderful!!!

Well if it's any consolation, I'm 38 and still going strong. :)
As far as the vibe and all of that it is true that things have changed 
a lot but you can still fine the vibe at small events and of course
thank God/dess for Sunset.

	Okay, said simply:  Family totally RULED.  
	Vibe=awesome
	Location=intimate and awesome (a bit hot)
	Music=awesome house
	Buttloads of smiles and happy goings on.
	I feel great that my $ went to a good cause, too.

	Is there a Sunset on the 17th (next weekend)?

p.s. There should be a Bosnia relief benefit sometime, that'd be an even 
better cause!

Alright, I apologize if that post was a little negative.  It's just that Burning Man was so incredible this year.  Hearing people (a few people, not just you) focus on how good it "used to be" instead of just appreciating how beautiful it was was starting to get me down.

'93 sounds like it was pretty amazing, wish I had been there too ...

Please.  I specifically noted that you can't do that, and that things
change, and move on, and such is the way of life.  This was, however,
the first year that I saw *any* people walking around with beer during
The Burn, and several were giving me serious attitude as I attempted to
move back as per the wishes of the rangers.

Let me tell a short story:

Rewind to two years ago.  There are about 800
people on the playa, roughly 1/6 as many as this year.  It is the night of
the burn, and we are all painted, costumed, and readied as usual.  The sky
is growing cloudy and ominous as the sun sinks beneath the mountains.

We begin the procession to the Man, drummers (including me) in a loose cloud
of rhythm near the center.  We reach the Man, and the beat picks up as we
circle around him, and we can feel the pressure dropping as our energy
increases.  The drums pound louder, the massive booming heartbeat of the
Man, of us all, arms upraised towards the electric sky, ready to die.  

Lightning flickers and arcs in the clouds above.

Someone with a torch lights the Man's legs on fire.  The rhythm grows hotter, 
faster, as we feel the exquisite pain of the flame licking upwards, over
the legs, up the torso, up the arms.  No fireworks, just the zap of neon
tubes popping in unison with the electrical storm overhead.  I cannot
take my eyes off the Man, and neither can anyone else in our group of
demon drummers; we are a fragile vessel of energy, discharging its potential
in our frenzy lest it build up in our limbs and organs and set us aflame
along with the Man.

Electric snakes snap and coil across the sky, sometimes touching earth in their
convulsions.

Just when I think I must break from the tension, the Man, weakened,
succumbs to the fire, and falls.  We rush in as one to come as near as we can,
to catch the energy from his burning body, screaming in triumph and shock that
we are still alive --

and the storm opens its black heart to us.  The dust hits in a choking wave
of dry grit, wind blowing so hard it seems to be driven through my body.  The
rain comes in hard cold spatters, almost painful in its velocity, but I cannot
feel it.  We have not stopped drumming, and we have not stopped dancing, and
we welcome Nature to the ritual, booming electric snakes and all.

This image will remain in my mind forever: drumming next to the fallen corpse
of the Man, lightning striking around us, the dust and rain blowing so hard
that all I can see is leaping silhouettes dancing around, over, and through
the wind-whipped flames.  To some people, this is a classic conception of
Hell.  I laugh manically, and keep drumming until the storm dies down and
the Man is an unrecognizable pile of embers and slag.

===

Now do you see why I might permit myself a little nostalgia?  Conspicuously
absent from this event were:
-crowd control measures (beyond showing people where the Man would fall; no
 lines of people with flares and event T-shirts)
-non-participants, defined as "people holding beers/cigarettes instead 
 of dancing"
-so many people that many had to sit down so you could see what was happening
-many competing groups of drummers, none of which were together with each
 other, or often even themselves
-the feeling of watching something from a distance (necessitated by the
 sheer numbers of people) instead of being a participant
-those wimpy 10-minute storms that were over before anyone could really
 start panicking >;^)

As I said before, the Burning Man means something different now: a gathering
of the tribes, a three-day TAZ in a beautiful place, a freakfest of amazing
scale and diversity.  The ritual that was key to my experience can't be the
same anymore, though, which is the cause of my wistfulness.

Oh well -- guess I'll have to build my own someday or something.

Charged GBH got their name from a UK general-purpose statute often used
by the police to suppress and arrest people in the punk scene in the
early days.  GBH = "Grevious Bodily Harm"

well, hey, if you ever want to come to sf and rave (and this wouldda
been a good weekend with the fmr), you can always crash at my pad :)
bring friends !  live it up !

that must really really be a jones to feel you cant truly express
and experience raves due to geographics and logistics.
being on this list is good.  you will always find people here who
will put you up, if you post that you are coming to sf. my life
was lamo  until i started raving this spring, when i got exposure 
to the rave scene.  

you have friends here !  who understand how important raving is !
never forget that !

Is you like Ambient music, good visuals, and good people, MONDAYS should be
exclusively reserved for The Gardening Club at The Caribbean Zone at 55
Natoma Street. It's just behind DV8 on Howard Street. The setting of this
place is just *too cool*. Plus it's only $3-.

Lettuce Dance and Cloud Factory organized a beautiful party under the
full moon this Friday.  It was a small gathering (peaking at maybe
150-200 people) with an excellent vibe.  DJ Cloud started, got
everyone moving, and let some heavy trance DJs take over the night.  I
can't remember much from this period.  (Unfortunately this includes
DJ's names.)  But I do remember the morning.  It was warm, misty with
lots of birds flying over us.  We were calm, relaxing around the
campfires as DJ Stony from MESS was closing things down.  I feel
refreshed after this party;  will carry lots of positive energy
wherever I go (including work tomorrow morning :).

This was one of the best full moon parties I attended.  A big thank
you to everyone who was there and especially the organizers.

I appreciate his argument against self-flagellating guilt---eloquent
and well-reasoned, as always...however, I don't think that respect for
men or maleness does not have to be associated with traditional "male"
attributes or a sense of genetic destiny.  I get a little uncomfortable
when I hear such cut-and-dry definitions of what is masculine and what
is feminine; I happen to be one of those people who sees a more blurred
line inbetween, or at least that is the way I wish things were out 
there in the world--this has a lot to do with the way I was raised, by 
a very self-reliant, feminist mother, and a very nurturing father.
And unfortunately, such a viewpoint can be something of a curse in 
this society we live in, which if anything is sliding backwards into
old tried-and-true assumptions about males & females.  I have had many
bad experiences where a female friend or lover has misread me or 
projected typical "male" attitudes onto me that just weren't there...
I'm not about to go into all the gory details of my personal life, I 
just wanted to make the point that it is very easy to feel alienated
and misunderstood when you have an unconventional take on being "male."
I cringe at just about anything that encourages women to look at men
in a stereotyped or generalized way, rather than as diverse and 
varied INDIVIDUALS.

And how do I feel about "DUMB MEN JOKES"?  I chuckled at them; 
a few were pretty clever... but at the same time, I wish they hadn't 
shown up on this list.  First of all, because it instantly reminded
me of something I would have seen pinned up in office cubicles next to
old yellowed "Garfield" and "Kathy" comic strips in one of the shitty
corporate temp jobs I used to work in Sacramento.  Not an environment
I want to be taken back to...  Secondly, it poured cold water on one
of the warmest feelings I have had about raves since getting into 
them a year ago, which is my appreciation of how raves, good ones 
anyway, have much less of the tension, mistrust, and general 
guardedness that exist elsewhere between males & females.  The 
atmosphere of mutual respect and openness I have found in this 
scene has kept me sane through some crazy times; I hate to see 
anything cloud the air, even if it is supposed to be humorous.  
Besides, there are plenty of other things to joke about, no?

This debate has been hoing on far to long and now that my english class is
also a women studies class the last place I want to see gender issues in is
on the sfraves mailing list it seems that I can't escape the insanity. I
only have four things to say.

1. Does it all really matter were going to die anyway.

2. If it does matter take them to court.

3. A joke is supposed to be funny and sometimes insulting. So laugh and be
done with it.

4. Political Correctness and humur do not go together.

Hello everyone,

After lurking for the suggested initial 2 weeks, I'm finally ready to
introduce myself to y'all and tell you how much I'm enjoying getting to
know you via the list.

First, the basics:

My name is Eric Kalabacos (friends call me E K). I'm 30 years old,
originally from NYC, in SF since 1/1/90, a Buddhist, a big-time Mac-head
(graphics, multimedia), and absolutely, positively, desperately, madly in
love with music. I live in downtown SF (2nd & Mission) with my wonderful,
beautiful girlfriend Veronika.

The first rave I ever went to was a Full Moon at Bonny Doon in the summer
of '92. My guides were Ammon Haggerty (my employee at the time and still a
dear friend) and Gary Henderson & Martha Harkey (of Yang Snowboard Clothing
- my customers at the time and also still close friends). I'll never forget
that night - arriving at 4am after a foggy, moonlit drive down Highway 1 -
peering over the cliff at the magical spectacle of 2-3000 people dancing
wildly under the stars - I simply couldn't believe it. This was an
experience I felt I had been waiting for my whole life. We danced until
noon. I loved watching the sun rise and seeing everyone's faces as the
light increased...

Needless to say, I've been to a couple (or a couple hundred ;-) ) parties
since that time. I've had all kinds of experiences - some great - some not
so great - but all very worthwile from the perspective of learning about
myself and my relationship to others. Raving has been (and still is) a
shamanic experience for me in the truest sense of the word. It is a
crucible into which I pour my whole being - my dreams, my fears, my
inspiration, my desire, my wisdom, my confusion. Raving has also given me
the chance to meet dozens and dozens of fascinating people, people like
yourselves...  =)

And, oh yes, the music. Let's not forget the music. The primal heartbeat of
the universe, the heartbeat of humanity. That feeling when you close your
eyes and feel it reverberating throughout your whole being, dissolving
fixation on self, teasing and tickling pleasure centers you didn't know
existed. And then the moment when you open your eyes and catch someone
else's glance and you both know. You both feel it together and there is a
flood of warmth and compassion for each other and for all beings. This is
why I rave.

As I said before, I've been lurking on the list for about 2 weeks now. I've
been aware of its existence for quite a while, but was dubious about
joining because of the anticipated flood of mail. I've made good use of the
calendar in the past (for which I thank Derek and Brian and anyone else
involved), but I'm so glad that I finally took the plunge and joined the
list. It is definitely an effort to wade through so much mail every day.
but worth it. I spend alot of time on-line (in fact, the company I work for
is developing games for net), and I've always been fascinated by the
potential of using the net for community-building. SFR is the finest
example of net-community I've experienced.

Speaking of shamanic experiences, Veronika and I went to Burning Man with
our friend Marcel last weekend. It was wonderful to follow the BMan-related
threads on the list. I could feel the excitement grow as the event
approached. I particularly loved the final day or two as people began to
post descriptions of themselves so that it would be easier to find each
other. I've also followed the post-Bman threads with great interest. It
feels like quite a privilage to learn from other people's experiences at
the event. When I get a chance I'll describe some of my own experiences
there...

Anyway, I have to get back to work now, but I just want to thank you all
once again for sharing yourselves in such an intimate, personal way on this
list. I look forward to meeting you in person (I'm sure I've met many of
you already and we don't even know it).

Peace & love,
ek  =)

I think there are things that are generically associated with maleness
and femaleness. That's not to say that the male should not ignore the
feminine in himself, nor the female ignore the masculine in herself. 
By blurring the lines, recognizing or taking on aspects of either, one
is actually strenghthening the cut-and-dry definitions, simply by
recognizing them and taking them into oneself. If one is acting out
"opposites" one is doing nothing more than acknowledging the fact that
the opposite force exists. By doing the opposite, one is precisely
defining what maleness or femaleness is all about, even if it's a woman
acting "butch" or a man acting "feminine"...

However, the crux of my argument is that femininism has caused many a
male to feel shame for the masculine, and that both diminishes
masculinity and femininity (it's again that thing about opposites
really being part of the same entity). So while I mostly support
feminism (except for separatist, male-bashing oriented feminism), I
also more strongly support the mens movement. I see fighting for men's
rights to be necessary because, unfortunately, the role of men have
been largely forgotten in the social movement that has happened in the
last 30-80 years. 

I see lots of problems coming out of this:
	* Many of children raised without a male role model (aka father)
	  don't have a good/positive view of maleness. Many male children
	  are thus finding "the male" in degenerate forms -- e.g. gangs.
	  And you get a vicious cycle of males redefining maleness as  violent,
	  uncaring, unnurturing, and sociopathic, which further causes
	  people to dismiss maleness as some kind of evil.	  
	* Lack of positive male role models in the media. The only positive
	  one I can think of is Bill Cosby; but there's lots of negative
	  portrayals of men as bumbling fools, from Al Bundy (Married with
	  Children), Homer Simpson (The Simpsons), etc. Meanwhile, there
	  are (IMHO) more positive portrayals of women (e.g. Murphy Brown).
	* Lack of positive-oriented mens groups in college. There's a general
	  feminist rubric that women can fit into in college, and if a man
	  wants to be "cool" (without being a jock/fratboy) he has to fit into
	  this rubric as well. This means that the non-jock/non-frat male 
	  tends to be further socialized in only a women-oriented way. The 
	  closest men get to "male socialization" is the (typically) 
	  degenerate/separatist form of socialization found in the fraternity.
	* Men are getting the short end of the stick. Women are getting
	  their equality more and more. Yet, if women are equal, capable
	  of supporting themselves, etc, why are so many divorced men
	  paying alimony and child support? If we're going to go forward
	  with liberation of the sexes, we have to stop looking at women as
	  dependent and men as breadwinners, and stop the sexism
	  implicit in the marriage laws. When a marriage ends it ends, and
	  the liberated man/women should be able to go separate ways without
	  court mandated laws about either party maintaining the
	  same standard of living after the marriage.

The subject line might be a bit misleading.  This is to confirm that
Richie Hawtin will not be at the Desert Move.  He has been waiting on 
the US Customs or Immigration offices to decide on allowing him entry
to the US without a court hearing.  He was refused entry several
months ago and not allowed to return pending a court hearing.  He
now has his work visa, and is waiting for the Customs/Immigration
office to recognise that without the court hearing.

John Acquaviva and Matthew Hawtin will both be there, though!

Hi Vince!

I'm sooo pleased ta meet ya!

I know this is a loooooong post, but I feel like a lost nomad searching for my 
tribe, so please bear with me.

I've gotten some great impressions from the sfraves list of folks.  Everyone 
seems really open, sincere and willing to make an effort to reach out.  
Although I've only been checking out the listings for a couple days (I broke 
the rule of lurking for two weeks, but I just couldn't wait to meet all the 
cool people =o) ) I have already met some real genuine folks who I can't wait 
to hook up with in person.  

I am just thrilled that there are so many people out there who have responded 
and want to make a connection.  It warms my heart! 

I've heard a million awesome things about the BMan gathering.  It sounds like 
an experience that practically transcends description even though what I've 
heard is glorious.  It almost sounds like it was a holy pilgrimage where people 
went to offer love, worship and thanks to their fellow brothers and sisters, 
the music, the earth.  It makes me giddy but sad to hear all the reports 
because I FEEL what you and these other folks are talking about and I totally 
relate, but it makes me sad that I wasn't there and that I haven't been having 
so many of "those experiences" lately in the scene.

**If others are reading these next couple of paragraphs,  do you feel the same 
way?**

Usually, when I go to a rave, I consider it to be an absolute success when 
(aside from awesome music and non-federally regulated substances) I get that 
feeling of love, trust, respect, and harmony with my fellow humans that lasts 
far beyond the music and the drugs.  That feeling goes down into the very 
depths of my soul, grabs my heart and my emotions and makes me want to dance 
and cry with joy.  At times everything seems so right.  I actually have 
epiphanies where I suddenly see what it's all about.  It has become my holy 
sacrament, a way to celebrate music and dance, expend positive energy, offer 
peace and friendship, and honor my fellow human beings and the incredible earth 
on which we live.  Unfortunately some of these encounters have shown me the 
world can be a very dark and hostile place too (but that's another tangent).  
For the most part I see the world as a place to learn, teach, nurture healthy 
relationships, have fun and dance, dance, dance!   

When I do encounter that feeling of peace and one-ness with the cosmic 
consciousness and my brothers and sisters, it's incredibly satisfying, 
uplifting, exhilarating, but a little meloncholy because I'm so afraid that 
feeling will go away and the experience will be just a sweet dream.  I'll wake 
up and find those wonderful people have floated away along with the fading, 
hypnotic beat.  There have been a couple times where it was such an amazing 
experience, but ultimately beyond a clear mental picture, that I wondered if I 
hallucinated the whole encounter or if it really happened.  Many times, after 
raves, I go home by myself and listen to more tunes (of course!).  I put my 
walkman on and kick it while winding down.  I have a smile on my face but at 
the same time I feel like crying (I'm sure this is partly from exhaustion) 
because the experience was so beautiful and rewarding...yet very etherial.  
It's frustrating not to be able to reach out and embrace the core of the 
experience and the people and have only the essence left to tease you.  It's 
exactly like trying to hold water in your hands...you saw the water, it was in 
your hands, your hands are wet, but there is no more water and you're STILL 
thirsty!!!.

*Whew!*  Alright, I'll stop hoggin' up all the band-width and give someone else 
a chance to flap!  I hope no-one objects to my ravings, I felt I needed to get 
it out there though  ;-)

Peace, love, friendships, dance

Rikki

First off, welcome Eric and Rikki. You have discovered a great bunch of 
people.  :) 

Something happened to me at Family that nearly just bowled me over.  I 
met someone new at Family and his name is Hy....I introduced him to some 
of you if you recall. Well, he had never heard of sfraves or Burning Man 
and as I started explaining it all to him, I realized what a tight knit 
group we all are. I stayed with Wayne this weekend (thanks again, Wayne) 
and Hy looked at me in amazement that I stay with people that I don't 
really know - only through cyberspace. He also looked on in amazement as 
I introduced fellow sfravers who hadn't met before (that is SO much fun 
to do!) and they talk like old friends. 

I discovered that night that we are all TRUELY a family.  I very nearly 
cried and at the same time, I could see some disadvantages:  I have met 
in the last 6 months or so, sfravers and their friends,& not many others 
outside the "internet circle".  I get so used to talking about computers, 
what topics are being discussed that week, etc.  that it can get easy to 
forget all those great ravers that are not connected through cyberspace. 
I felt that again as I talked about Burning Man with people from sfraves 
and non-sfravers alike.  I said to Hy that "you just had to have been 
there to TRUELY understand."   Maybe I'm reading too much into it, but at 
Family Saturday night I really DID feel like a member of a very special 
sfraves family.  BTW, keep a look out for Hy on the interet.  He has an 
e-mail account at UCSC and I think that after meeting lots of sfravers 
himself, he will want to join our family, too.  Stay beautiful... I LOVE 
YOU ALL!

love,                     ps: a sidenote on Sunset...great party, I just
Amy                       felt so guilty about leaving when there was 
                          so much garbage on the ground....they guys from
                          Pacific were probably dead tired after
                          throwing Family the night before.  Why do 
                          people litter like that?  I'm bring my OWN 
                          garbage bag next time....

because the experience was so beautiful and rewarding...yet very etherial.  
It's frustrating not to be able to reach out and embrace the core of the 
experience and the people and have only the essence left to tease you.  It's 
exactly like trying to hold water in your hands...you saw the water, it was in 
your hands, your hands are wet, but there is no more water and you're STILL 
thirsty!!!.

*Whew!*  Alright, I'll stop hoggin' up all the band-width and give someone else 
a chance to flap!  I hope no-one objects to my ravings, I felt I needed to get 
it out there though  ;-)

Peace, love, friendships, dance

I believe this didn't post.  If it did, sorry for the repeat.

Well,

Id have to say that this event hath inspried me in two or three ways...

One: Hold nothing sacred....  When I brought my items to 
Lett uS Dance (ie shoes, water, and lotsa smiles) I knew well that the H2O
would become the communal drinking jug.. (the shoes?? well, I reclaimed them
later on that night...) which was fine, since there were sooo many of Us
dancing in the frenzied state that we were in... 
Just dancing with soo many of  US, thoses in the scene, kept my belief that
we, as a community could do nothing but Grow.. accepting the next generation
of Dancers, Dj's and music...

Two: Although feeling ever so happy and trippy and dizzy et. al.
There was one thing that I did notice amongst the crowd and the place...
 This was the seemingly  noticeable through the change of "sets" that  the
DJ's from other 'camps' would throw up a little addititue here and there
(although it coulda been me too, I did go thru a bit of a paranoid stage
during the event myself).  However, if this was the case, Please people,
leave the 'fronting'  at home (ie. Yourpad@home.org).  All that frowns and
stern looks do is instigate fights and police, I know i've seen many
happen....
About the Place: I think it couldn't of been at a better local (since Ive
adapted my dancing style to sand and beachrocks...).  But, as day broke I
noticed all of these beat, worn down cardboards, which was no real problem
 since it is pyro-consumeable.  However, the plastic bottles I saw strewn
everywhere was indeed a sad sight to behold...  I know I can't lay blame
since I'v'e been culprit for many years too.  But to atone for my sins
against mother earth I've decied to take this oath:
        I (My Name)___  Do solemly sewar that wherever I happen to end up
finger snappin', Rump shakin', leg stompin', rug cuttin',  and spinning
around generally in madness, That amongst the other Neccesities that I may
bring to any Undergrounds (Ie flashlight, Battries, map et. al.). There WILL
be an empty plastic 10 (or 5) gal. trash bag to pickup such needless litter
that was so needful when water or other chemically derived compounds was
occupied in it.  And futhermore understand that Although I may get really,
really strange looks from others as I put a bag of useless trash in my car,I
will be content. Knowing I have Done my duty to respect the ground I dance on
& ravers I dance with...

Despite these lil' pratfalls the event was a smashing success. I recieved
plenty 'O' names (Again, all escape me now...)  A specal "Hiya" to thoses
campfire dudes from San Mateo, tha guy sining the CHiPs theme to his feamle
siginficant other, that Cute asian gal by the speaker, thoses two other gals
I think I talked to & Mars for a good set (and Tom too I believe...)...

Smile O meter Ratings:

Vibe:  Trippy trancy Madness 
 9Smiles....

Dance space: funny to see that people are brining thier own "dance floor"
 (ie. cardboard boxes) but, I perfer contact w/the earth I dance on 
8.5Smiles

Lights/visuals:  after getting accustomed to everyone looking like radiation
victims it wasnt too bad 
8Smiles

Location:  As the saying goes... "Getting there is an adventure in itself"
 Directions were Pretty Crazy 
 7Smiles...

Frienship Potental: I believe this rating in itself depends on the person(s)
initiating it... Although I did see guys chasin' E-babies and doing what they
knowingly or unknowingly do.
On the other coin I also saw pleasent conversation and general acceptence
with strangers-turn-freinds just ploping down and chatting.
8Smiles

Overall:  8.1 smiles

In closing (about time, eh?),
I'd like to believe this, the scene, is all about communicating w/each other
and becoming closer because of it.  A common thread that unites us all
(almost like this post)...  And although I know that This message is
probabaly being read by less than 10% of the actuall people in attenence I
feel if I touched any of you then all this scatterbrain-bandwith-consuming
Eline then something has been achieved.....

-Dancing, weaving, catching a hug in between. Still free.-
Adam 

P.S. 
BTW, I was the one in the Blue shirt, torn grey pants, and an X cap....
If you see me next time, yank me from the dance floor and say howdy....

Second post today about bringing your own trash bag to an event.  Thats great, 
I think it should be part of a ravers standard equipment when going to a party 
in a non established place.

Hi Adam,
	In your last post, you mentioned that you felt some of the "DJs from
other camps would throw up a little attitude here and there".  I can anly
speak for myself when I say, "I still get queazy when i step up to spin"
(i almost passed out during my set at F&F =)  ) so sometimes I forget to
smile or even look up during my set!  So, during my (and DJ Swoops) set, I
prolly didn't look like the happiest person in the world; but believe me,
spinning makes my soul glow and my heart smile (on the inside).  
	With this being said, I would like to ask a favor of all you beautiful
people out there.  If you ever see me spinning (or anywhere else!) without
a smile or happy radience, walk up and say, "SMILE!" and I promise to respond
with a big chee-Z smile and/or a big hug!!!
Luv,
Sabin Cloud

To sfravers. $2 admission tonight if you mention sfraves. Free vegetarian
food at 11:30ish.The founding idea  of  the gardening club is to ask Dj's
to bring down music they would play to their friends on a hazy Sunday
morning after a mad night, they are requested not to play anything that is
in their sets at that time insuring different and diverse music each week.
All monnies taken on the door is evenly distributed amongst everyone who
works at TGC. Thanks for use of sfraves as a communication mediam.

Plus here is a question I would like to throw into the ring:
         technology has began to bring us the chance as independents to
produce and distribute music and interactive products cheaply. With things
like direct digital delivery, Virtual banking and the real time  audio
technologies, anabling you to broadcast live via the web. Do you think the
ties that have chained us as artists to corporate companies due to their
control of all the steps in the wheel of making, producing, distributing
and marketing of product, and even the control of the format you  listen to
the music from,will be broken when consumers will be able to contact
artists directly and download and pay for things from the source? Will
technology bring back the days when punk music ruled the airwaves and
independents ran the music industry(80's in Britain)?
       will  Majors become holding companies that will only have control
over back stock releases and will be there to do things like publicity and
marketing for the artist?
        This could be a possibility in the electronic and dance music
industries if the technology is utilized by the many small independents
that are starting up all over America. The major problem holding us back is
lack of airplay on commercial radio pushing the industry to rely on mixed
tapes to bring awareness of labels & artists.   You can guarantee that the
direct distribution network is already being cornered by the corporate
companies, just look at the politics and buyouts going on with the future
of home entertainment with things like the telecommunications bill, video
on demand, 100 of squillians of crap cable channels through fiber optics
and the new hybrid CD's that hold 2.5 hours of video. Plus After the
cancellation of the project between IBM and blockbusters to produce one of
cds in their stores allowing consumers to pick and choose their own
compilations through direct delivery. Which was blocked by the majors after
IBM and Blockbuster announced the idea causing much embarrassment?
          This is a bit of research for an article I may do in Xlr8r, so
thought sfraves would be a good place to start. So this is for a question
forArtists and consumers.

I was at this party also. good vibes abounded and id never had to dance
on sand before  which was...interesting.  there was too much trance tho
for the night IMO and i got really bored and took a nap for about 2 hours
but stony ended the party right.

 Unfortunately for the Cloud Factory guys the Ryder truck they rented to
move the equipment was tagged by some fools who weere there and they 
also tagged some of the park signs.  This pissed off two rangers who
showed up as they were moving the equipment at the end of the party.
So they got a ticket for "Disturbing the Peace" which they'll have to
go to court for.  good luck guys in fighting it :)

peace

Dear All;

	This Cancer(Moonchild), had the pleasure of attending my first
ever FMR. It took me a year of raving in the Bay Area to get there. The
night started out with me posting to SFR, that I was in search of that
special person who would offer me a ride, down south. Well it was getting
late, bout 11:30pm, and I was thinking that once again I wouldn't make it.

	I went to log back on for the last time when I saw a post from
Kathleen Evans, offering me a ride down to FMR. Well my moon
goddess/mother must have been looking out for me cause a half hour later
Doug Faircloud called offering me yet another ride. Karma's a funny thing
ya know. Well, it promised to be a truely interesting, beautiful, and
charming night of music, environment, & company. I told Doug that I
already had a ride and the he should meet us down there, anyway. I then
met for the first time a very sweet Kathleen Evans, and we both headed off
down 880 south to the FMR. 

	From 880 I usually take 92 over the San M bridge to get to 1 and 
the coast. I am truely envious of all the Californian's that have had 
such a beautiful coast to share and enjoy there entire lives, while us 
east coast transplants had "the shore"; (sigh). Cali's coast is beautiful 
even in the dark, and even after a year I'm still awed and breathless. 
There's a 7-11 at the end of 92 where I usually stop for raver supplies. 
We pulled into the parking lot and ran into Doug doing the same. So we 
talked & hugged for a few minutes and decided to caravan down to FMR.

	So we drove down the coast until we saw a line of cars on the side
of the road signaling that we had reached our destination. We jumped out
of the car & over the first dune to behold the party location. A beautiful
& huge cove/beach cut out of the surrounding hill sides, protected all all
sides except for the water, erieially lit by an invisible full moon's
light, and about 50 - 100 down. This sacred place, could easially hold a
thousand or so ravers. The beach consisted of a few scattered fires,
tents, ravers(awake & asleep), and a silent sound system. The sight
reminded me of a track on my GAIA 1&2 CD, called a Tribute To Goa, by
S.M.I.L.E, of Berlin. The track opens with the echoing/reverbing vocals
"beach, sound, water, palms, stars, space, juice, Goa", I smiled and
headed down the hill with my compainions. As I was walking down the dune,
I imaged what a surprise it would be to some unaware campers from say
Kenny-Bunk-Port Maine, or similar local, to think they've found a really
cool camp sight, only to be awakened by house music, and 200 lovin,
freakin, dancin, children of the moon, at 3 o 'clock in da 
morning.        = >!!!!!!!!!! 

	After about 15 minutes or so, I heard the generator turn over and
knew the music was soon to follow. If was 3:00am or there abouts, when the
house music started to spin. I'm sorry but I can't tell ya who was
spinning, but they did a really, really, great couple of sets. The beat
picked up as the night went along, seeming to reach an exstascy filled
climax sometime near dawn, with almost everyone up dancing.

	In the day light I could clearly see about a hundred or so of us
"freaks"; and I thought to myself; god it doesn't get much better than
this. Da house music spun til bout 10am, including one more "crazy freaky
jam", by request :) 

	In a nutshell, and in my opinion, the three best kept secrets in 
the bay area as far as raves go are; the Full Moon Rave, New Moon Rave, 
and my personal favorite cause I LOVE TRANCE!!!, is Frequency 8. See ya 
this Friday.

Dear All;

	I'm personally very envious of womyn and the whole birth thing.
They get to experience & feel what it's like to have life created & grow
inisde them, and to have that life become a living, breathing, thinking
enitity in 9 months. To have a bond with a another being that goes behond
anything that I as a man will ever know and/or experience. I personally 
think, that this is power.

PS. Despite by views on birth, & just for the record; be there any 
confusion, I'm proud to say that I'm PRO-CHOICE.

Dear All;

	This Cancer(Moonchild), had the pleasure of attending my first
ever FMR. It took me a year of raving in the Bay Area to get there. The
night started out with me posting to SFR, that I was in search of that
special person who would offer me a ride, down south. Well it was getting
late, bout 11:30pm, and I was thinking that once again I wouldn't make it.

	I went to log back on for the last time when I saw a post from
Kathleen Evans, offering me a ride down to FMR. Well my moon
goddess/mother must have been looking out for me cause a half hour later
Doug Faircloud called offering me yet another ride. Karma's a funny thing
ya know. Well, it promised to be a truely interesting, beautiful, and
charming night of music, environment, & company. I told Doug that I
already had a ride and the he should meet us down there, anyway. I then
met for the first time a very sweet Kathleen Evans, and we both headed off
down 880 south to the FMR. 

	From 880 I usually take 92 over the San M bridge to get to 1 and 
the coast. I am truely envious of all the Californian's that have had 
such a beautiful coast to share and enjoy there entire lives, while us 
east coast transplants had "the shore"; (sigh). Cali's coast is beautiful 
even in the dark, and even after a year I'm still awed and breathless. 
There's a 7-11 at the end of 92 where I usually stop for raver supplies. 
We pulled into the parking lot and ran into Doug doing the same. So we 
talked & hugged for a few minutes and decided to caravan down to FMR.

	So we drove down the coast until we saw a line of cars on the side
of the road signaling that we had reached our destination. We jumped out
of the car & over the first dune to behold the party location. A beautiful
& huge cove/beach cut out of the surrounding hill sides, protected all all
sides except for the water, erieially lit by an invisible full moon's
light, and about 50 - 100 down. This sacred place, could easially hold a
thousand or so ravers. The beach consisted of a few scattered fires,
tents, ravers(awake & asleep), and a silent sound system. The sight
reminded me of a track on my GAIA 1&2 CD, called a Tribute To Goa, by
S.M.I.L.E, of Berlin. The track opens with the echoing/reverbing vocals
"beach, sound, water, palms, stars, space, juice, Goa", I smiled and
headed down the hill with my compainions. As I was walking down the dune,
I imaged what a surprise it would be to some unaware campers from say
Kenny-Bunk-Port Maine, or similar local, to think they've found a really
cool camp sight, only to be awakened by house music, and 200 lovin,
freakin, dancin, children of the moon, at 3 o 'clock in da 
morning.        = >!!!!!!!!!! 

	After about 15 minutes or so, I heard the generator turn over and
knew the music was soon to follow. If was 3:00am or there abouts, when the
house music started to spin. I'm sorry but I can't tell ya who was
spinning, but they did a really, really, great couple of sets. The beat
picked up as the night went along, seeming to reach an exstascy filled
climax sometime near dawn, with almost everyone up dancing.

	In the day light I could clearly see about a hundred or so of us
"freaks"; and I thought to myself; god it doesn't get much better than
this. Da house music spun til bout 10am, including one more "crazy freaky
jam", by request :) 

	In a nutshell, and in my opinion, the three best kept secrets in 
the bay area as far as raves go are; the Full Moon Rave, New Moon Rave, 
and my personal favorite cause I LOVE TRANCE!!!, is Frequency 8. See ya 
this Friday.

Hello! Just for the record, it's Rikki from SF, and Alex from Reno.
Rikki is new and wrote the original "Meet Me!" post; I'm relatively old to 
the sfraves community. (But not one of the elusive "elders". ;)

I think it's great that the new people are figuratively standing up and 
introducing themselves. It's like joining the family, in a way.
Even though I've seen your posts on here for awhile now... 

Welcome, Matt!!!! 

(ohh-- that was purely unintentional bad pun. sorry!!! :)

from her writings on PLUR way back when or her work with vrave and occasional
posts to sfraves and such.  We had to limit the size of our ceremony on
Sunday due to our budget, and since we had *many* friends we didn't have 
room to invite, we decided it would be great to throw an informal, 
open-invite beach party the day before.  Realizing now that it would 
probably be a rather large party, and since spirits on the SFRaves list 
are running at a nearly all-time high, we figured now would be a great 
time for a big SFRaves list get-together as well.

So, the details:

Place:   Bonny Doon beach, Santa Cruz (directions below)
Time:    Saturday, September 16th, 1pm to 8:30pm
   EVERYONE IS INVITED

Bonny Doon is a beach about 12 miles north of Santa Cruz along the 1 - as
those who have followed the list for awhile know, Bonny Doon is a very
important beach in SFRaves herstory - the first Connection was held there
back in August of 1992.  It also has a huge place in my heart.  The beach is
*very* big, is free and open to the public, and a daytime party will have no
trouble with music.  The curfew on the beach is 10pm, so we'll end right
after sunset, around 8:30, so we have time to pack up and move out without
causing problems. 

Ethan Miller of FnF fame has graciously donated SoundVision for the event -
what would a party be without music? - and he, Joe Rice, and a friend of ours
from New York, Will-E, are the DJ's on the schedule so far. If you would like
to spin, send me mail - I want to give at least 1 1/2 hours/DJ so there's
really only 2 spots left, reserved for SFRaves list people of course :)

So, here's the call out for help:  *WE NEED VOLUNTEERS!*  If you want to 
get together and *sweat* with your fellow listgeeks like me here's your 
chance :)

1) Bonny Doon is not an easy to get a sound system to, so we need a set up
crew and a tear down crew of roughly 15-20 each.  This involves some 
amount of heavy lifting.  With that many people the whole system could be 
moved in one trip between the parking lot and the beach.  

2) Someone is needed to pick up and return a 5Kw generator from Big 4 in 
the city (or wherever the person would like to rent from)

3) A tarp/canopy is needed to shield the DJ area from sun/heat - a simple 
blue plastic tarp with poles to support it would work, or even two patio 
umbrellas.  

If you can volunteer for any of these positions, send me mail here at 
brian@hyperreal.com so I can know what to expect.  If you are in the 
setup crew, be in the parking lot by 1 - if you are in the tear-down crew 
expect to stay to 9:30.

The aim is for a feel similar to Sunset parties - nothing fancy, no strobe
lights, just being outside with great music and lots of friends.  Of course
one should consider bringing food, sunblock, trashbags, fruit, things to play
on the beach with, your good spirits, and yes, even your massage table if so
inclined.  Feel free to bring friends too.  If you'd like to plan 
something monumentally interesting let me know... 

---

Directions from San Francisco/San Mateo/points east:

  Take the 92 west, past the 280, over the pass to the coast and highway 1
  Turn left (south) at the 1, go about 40 miles.  (see below)

Directions from San Jose and Santa Cruz:

  Take 17 south to the 1 north, go about 10 miles past the last 7-11

Just south of Davenport, you'll see Bonny Doon Road come from inland and 
interesect at a dirt parking lot.  Park in that lot, or nearby (observing 
all parking laws of course - they *will* ticket and smoetimes tow, but 
there is enough space for everyone) and head over the hill across the train 
tracks, and there you are.  

Again, if you can volunteer, send me mail so we can have some semblance 
of coordination :)  

See you all there!

	Brian

3 quik things then I'm off to bed


1) Jokes aren't funny if at the expense of others feelings!

2) Double standards go both ways(hence the word DOUBLE)

3) Women can be sexist, just like blaks an be racist, and hypocrites can
be right.

Hi SFRaves -

 Well , I posted the attached text back in Oct. 1992 - and I guess it 
mostly still stands. Some things are dated - I put in some comments
that are denoted by {} . I hope it introduces me adequately to the 
folks I haven't talked to yet!

                      Larry Ching / larryc@netcom.com

 --------------------------------------------------------------------

My Testimonial: Why I Go To Raves
 
 I guess I should start with me and dancing. From what I remember about
my childhood attempts at dancing, I was a hyperactive stepper. I would
do what would be described now as pogoing, with a reve'd up version of
twisting ( showing my age there!). { I was 37 when I originally wrote
this } . I knew when to stop dancing, when my
nose started bleeding.
 
 So, from my earliest years, I valued sensation over style in dancing.
When I entered my teenage years, the sexuality & sensuality that I
became capable of added some spice to the equation, but it was still
mostly an adrenaline/trance thing. This was at odds with social dancing,
especially in the shy, conservative environment of 1970's teen Hawaii.
And, since I didn't like drinking all that much, rock concerts were the
only way I could dance the way I wanted to. ( At that time, rock
concerts in Hawaii were almost totally attended by white audiences ).
 
 The sensuality and trance components of my dancing increased after I
encountered marijuana and acid; and my accessiblity to these aspects of
dance has remained with me, in a mellower fashion, after I reduced my
level of consumption. { Despite all the odds , I still haven't done
E yet! Just never have been the right combination of mood , desire ,
and availability . I don't miss what I haven't had... }
 
 I screwed up my back a few years ago, so a lot of my dancing now is
done with my upper body, as opposed to doing fancy dance moves with my
feet.
{ My back is much better now ... I usually say that just before I
  screw it up again!}
 I do a lot of dancfloor roaming, as walking/jogging/running is
easier for my legs to do than in-place dancing. I don't usually like
compact crowds and uneven dancefloors at raves, because they both
interfere with my zooming around.
 
--------
 
 The main reason I like raves is that I can dance the way I've always
wanted to.
 
 
 Other reasons are:
 
- Meeting people who are kind and patient.
  At one big warehouse rave in Hayward, I accidently stepped on
someone's hand, but he was graciously forgiving. And, of course, I've
met all you good SFRavers! Good people are hard to find.
 
- Not so much macho "I/we can booze/do drugs/dance/fight better than you
and your gang can" attitude. ( Although the recent posts about WICKED
may indicate that a person should be aware of potential trouble ).
{ I can't remember what the Wicked reference was about - but there's
  been recent non-Wicked problems that make the warnign just as 
  relevant }.
 
- Crowd participation - can you imagine a seated audience "appreciating"
a DJ , like a classical string quartet? 
{ Well , nowdays if the DJ is doing ambient or acid jazz or ... actually
  listening in a classical music audience sense is not so far fetched.
  And I have stopped dancing at least once so I could just get deeper
  into some elaborate acid trance that DJ Theta Blip was spinning }

 What really annoys me at the
huge Grateful Dead shows are the "butt-parkers" who seem to be there to
watch the clowns (ie Deadheads) and be sports-style fans, as opposed to
using their minds and bodies to join with the music.
{ Recent example - Burning Man ? }
 
- (Bad reason coming here ->) Rave is "leading edge", as opposed to
"cool" or "fashionable" .
I'll be honest, part of my interest in raves comes from the novelty of
them. I've always been a Curious George about pop avant culture, and
these millenium (end)times have been very, very interesting! Also, I
still feel an air of impermanence to raves. I don't want to miss this
before it disappears, the way I was too late for the 60's.
{ Rave still seems to be around , like some high-quality airwick. I don't
  care if it's "leading-edge" or not anymore }
 
{ My old .sig follows ... "Dance Like A Flower" was the first semi-techno
  vinyl purchase ...}

HOORAY!!!  I didn't know that at all, what a lovely surprise!  I wish so
much that I could be there for your pre-event get-together, but I guess
I'll have to be satisfied with sending humongoloid amounts of love and good

Beautiful post Rikki!
"I get that feeling of love, trust, respect, and harmony with my fellow
humans" = DA VIBE -- its always been there and you can almost always find at
least a small pocket of it at any party.
Its wonderful to have new people come into the scene and see it again for the
first time through their eyes. I've made friends with a couple of "newbies"
recently and their enthusiasm is so contagious that it just lifts me up no
matter what mood I'm in.  

Its true that you can reach higher states of consciousness that aren't really
accesible to the normal waking consciousness even via memory.  And I'm always
working on bringing the vibe back into my everyday life.  It sounds like you
might be missing that key component to happiness and that's giving back.  For
the longest time I would feel that I was still unfulfilled that I couldn't
"embrace the core" as you say until I tried giving back even if its just
giving people water, candy,hugs, energy, whatever. When you give back you
complete the loop and thus fulfill the vibe within yourself and it just goes
higher. Try it. 
Oh yeah, dump the walkman, get a boombox and invite some people back home
with you when the parties over.
Keep it goin' y'all,
phuture

Hi everyone,
 Well the SASE (Self Addressed Stamped Envelopes) are coming in, and I sent
out a pile today, so if you sent me one, look for your Laminates soon,
before the weekend, I would expect. I was thinking Freq 8 would be good
this Fri night, is anyone else planning on going to this ?? I hope to meet
more SFRavers, this weekend !! It's really great to finally meet you all.
(a few at a time)

Also, are any other SFRavers (besides me) working at the Rennaissance Faire
this year ?? Let me know, where you are working, or hanging out, so I can
look for you this weekend. I'm in the Danse Macabre, and the Court of
Misrule (fools), as well as working (sort of) at the Wild Soles shoe booth
for the last hour or two each day. Look me up. I guess this also goes for
any SFRavers just going to Faire. Let me know what days you are going and
I'll try and meet you somewhere.

byebye
Looking forward to going out again :)

        I am saddened that lots of sfravers were at family, and I didn't meet
any of you.  Well I had an EEEEcstatic time.  Thanks to all the gateway crew
for making my last sf rave incredible.  later on in the week I am going to
school in seattle.  If any of you know of the scene or anything about the
scene, I would deeply appreciate the info.  I will deeply miss signing on
each day and being greeted by all of you lovely people.  I know I won't be
able to stay in Seattle too long without going through withdrawl, so I will
hopefully see or meet some of you in the months to come.  My brother lives in
the city so access to raves will be easy.  So all of you ravers have lots of
fun.  since I will be away from info about raves, if any of you think that
one comes up that I should not miss....e-mail me about it, and hopefully I
will fly down.  thanks again to all of you for making my summer the best to
date...

love forever,

Matt Brooker

I have the wacky pleasure of taking a group of my English raver friends 
out on Friday night, any good suggestions party-wise?  They are wonderful 
bunch of people and I want them to go back to England with lots of warm 
SF fuzzies  :)

Okay, here's mine:

Name:  Amy Rainier Starkey
Occupation:  Fulltime student @ CSUS major - graphic design.  Works part 
             time at Pottery Barn in Arden Fair Mall. 
Personal stats:  5'6" with long straight hair - two hair wraps behind my 
                 left ear, brown eyes, always smiling! :):) 
Rave history:  First rave was Liquid Palace here in Sac in 92.  But my 
             first ExpEriEncE was at the Gathering New Year's Eve party 
             92/93 at the Vallejo Fairgrounds.   I consider that my "real"
             first rave. My first year as a raver as mostly spent at 
             larger venues - ususally Basics or Gatherings - I never 
             missed 'em.  Now I prefer the smaller parties and getting 
             a chance to hear lesser known dj's.
Music pref:  Acid trance!!!!  I loved that harder faster stuff played at 
             Friends & Family.  Still my alltime favorite dj ever has got 
             to be Tony.  He never lets me down!!  

Okay, that's enough about me......

Just to let you know, the sfraves family extends all the way up to the
Northwest!  There are lot's of nw-ravers lurking on sfraves and we consider
ourselves part of the sfraves family.  We planned our first FMR 3 years ago
based on concepts and ideas we derived from sfraves.

Please don't consider your move to Seattle as going away from your family,
but merely visiting another branch of the family.  Welcome!  =)

Please feel free to contact me and I'll introduce ya around to your
Northwest cuzzins!

Peace!

        well this is my 1st posting to the list..i've been on it for about
a month,but never really took the time to post anything to it..i'm on
v-rave kinda often so if you're around on v-rave say what's up!=)
Alittle bit about myself:
        i goto Academy of Art in SF where i'm majoring in Computer Arts.I
started ravin' in 89' in Lost Angeles until i moved to the bay area in the
summer of 92'. well i took a short break and came back in the summer of
93'(remember Small World@richmond:?) that year i was also intro'd to
computers and became instantly addicted! this year i finally bought a POWER
MAC(anybody need flyers?) and as soon as i got my internet hooked up to the
list.....i always wonder if i've ever met or seen any of you, i think the
idea of laminates or buttons is a good ideai'd make some for all(work @
kinko's heh,heh)and pass them out at the wedding shindig(congrat's laura
and brian)but i unfortuatly must work that day....i am very busy w/ work
and school+i just got turntables so i'mlearning the art of djin' so after
all that it leaves me very little time and $ to go out and let loose....i
heard sunset went off this weekend(wish i could've gone to the benifit
they've always provided a gret time for me)i heard the week b4 from the
list of course,that it wasn't goin on anymore does last week's party mean
sunset will still be around into the fall someone please  let me know as
this is really the only event i'm able to fully attend...or any event that
has Ron D Core..
        well that's all for now if i do get the chance, and escape from
life-i'll be the one w/ the highliters drawing all over everybody...until
then
peace,and harmony amongst the masses,

actually, the majority of the north bay lunch club works near the 
south bay park so it convenient to do it during the week.

perhaps we could do the gardening club on a monday night and call
it north bay chill ?

My personal view as an artist, technophile, and consumer:

While technology is going to make it easier and easier for the
connected few (as consumers) to make direct connection with the
artists this is in no way going to change the patterns of airplay
until the station music directors take advantage of the new digitally
connected delivery and search channels available thru the web and
other networked sources.  As a result the general public will still
not have a clue as to what is available from the independent
artist/producer, let alone know of how to find it.  It will still be
the adventurous quirky few that will know where to find the edge and
experience it.

The additional consumer issue here is of storage media.  The digitally
connected user is currently limited to either having a HUGE hard disk
or learning how to connect a cassette deck to their soundcard outputs
and piece together a string of soundfiles of varying quality and level
manually.  Until a truely affordable CD burner (with an internal swap
space equivilant to a full CD's capacity) complete with CD authoring
software that can roughly compensate for level and other discrepancies
in a playlist of files, convert from any and all soundfile formats to
red book audio, and, here is the key, do all this with minimal to no
input from the user, this will never be a mainstream distribution
system.

Welcome welcome!!

Hmmm....another computer artist!  I almost went to the Academy of Art 
college....we'll have to meet someday and talk computer graphics and Macs!

As for Sunsets.....Mike Clay and I talked to Galen himself on Saturday 
night and he said that Sunsets would continue until the end of October. 
******YAY!**********   I hope it'll happen in the Richmond/Berkeley area 
this Sunday so I can go!

Does anybody know who was spinning the last set at Sunset?  He was GOOD!!

love,
Amy

You mean the bald guy?  That was Solar!  I didn't know who it was at first,
I was hoping it was a Gabber DJ...  (Just kidding, Solar's one of my
favorites, and that was a particularly good set).

Ok here's mine too

Name: Sean Clare

Occupation: I drive a big yellow tow truck and part time candy flipper
Personal stats: 5'10" 155lbs  short brown hair, baby blue eyes usually
dilated at
parties. Got a few tattoos including this hot looking raver girl on my arm.

Rave history: First was a Toon Town back in '92. Been to too many more since
then  to even fathom a guess. My favorites have been FMR at Bonnie Doon
Beach, Wicked, Come Unity, The Orb in 93, and Pure Space. Allways guaranteed
to  be a slammin party. I live with my best friend who also happens to be  a
pretty good DJ and owns a fat sound system so I allways get to  hear all the
newest and raddest records. Lots ofother  perks come with having him for a
friend and roommate.

Music Preference: HOUSE MUSIC! Anything with soul (Garth and Thomas and my
favorite DJs) I also like funky, break-beat style and really trippy sounds.
Not too much into techno or trance. I prefer the BPMs in the 120-140 range.
I also listen to hip hop, reggae, modern dance, Patsy Cline, AC/DC, you name it!

What else.... I grew up in San Francisco, I've lived in San Jose, Santa Cruz
and San Rafael. I just moved back here a few months ago from my second time
living in Santa Cruz (too boring there) and my girlfriend just recently
brokw up with me.

And thats that!

If you want to know anything alse just ask!

Wha??  guess what, the SFR family goes a lot further south too!  i am in San
Diego and have been on and off the list for a coupla years now.  I try to
make the trip up for each Friends and Family, and have LOVED the sunset
parties i went to.  
The only thing southern cal. has that compares to the SF "vibe" are the
monthly Full Moon Gatherings thrown by Moontribe, of which i have been to
the last 5.  :)  heard of em?   i've even met SFRavers at them!  

Anyway, you all are the greatest and i hope to see some of ya at the next F'n'F 
in October.  I'll be hangin' w/ (dj) Jeyson of Davis.  Come say hi!

peace and love

Vince,

How many weekends are you working there?  The whole time?  I'll probably go
sometime but I'm not sure when.

Jake

p.s.  I just have to ask... where the hell did you get a flamethrower?  Last

So it is apparently the opinion of Mr. Mayer that, because we have 
anatomical differences, men and women are inherently inequal, and 
therefore should not even bother to discuss issues of gender equality at all.

Well, as far as anatomical goes -- men are not incapable of physically 
nursing a child, given proper hormonal therapy, and the evidence shows 
that men would even be able to carry out most of the functions of gestation,
with similar tweaking. { Caesarian birth, guys... we're not talking about 
cutting anything off, here ;) }

I'm not saying that the above is anything we need to be doing, at least not 
in the name of "equal rights", but it does emphasize my point -- we're not as 
different as some would have you think. For example, the Religious Right 
would LOVE for us all to think as Mr. Mayer does -- "this is the way it 
is/always has been/always will be so there is no point in discussing it". 

Sorry, but that kind of smug crap just doesn't reflect reality. Biology 
is not Destiny.

What about those of us who are different in other ways? Those of us who 
are queer! Those of us who are disabled! Those of us who have darker skin 
and eyes that aren't blue!

Are we doomed to a life on the lower rungs of Society's Ladder because of 
our differences? 

NO!!! 

These are issues we address over and over, louder and louder, because there 
are still some folks who just don't get it -- 

**that there is nothing inherently inequal about difference**.

OH well, Where do I begin?

My name's Geoff, I'm 6' 5" >250# :) African American Male I'm sorta a rave
"elder" as I will be 39 this January. Hmm, I can't remember my first
"rave" party exactly, I remember my first exposure to SF night life which
was a Do not sit (on the furniture) party back in 88.  I think the first
actual "rave party that I went to was a Toon Town at Big Heart City this
must have been sometime in '91 but I didn't really become a "raver" until
I went to two particular parties, my first full moon rave at
Grey Whale Cove in March of '92 and the Whoopie Ball of that same month.
When I saw all of those people on the beach having fun and dancing in the
moon light and thc cops up top couldn't do a fucking thing to stop it,
I KNEW THIS WAS FOR ME :).  I also had the most incredible experience 
of community and spirituality at the Whoopie ball that it just blew me
away.  I went out to as many parties as i could after that.  I pretty
much prefer HOUSE music in all it's forms but since my major occupation
in the scene is to generate the Vibe, this is possible with any and all
types of music, from HOUSE TO Trance to Hardcore, I do remember seeing
God in the Bass Bins during hardcore techno sets during the Toon Town days
so It's al good.  These days I don't get to go out as much as i used to
having numerous full-time and part time jobs in and out of The Scene.
Some of you have most recently seen me as the "door diva" :) at Wicked.
But I do manage to get out about 4 times a month which is way lower
then 4 times a week which was the the norm in '92 :) Anyways you will
still find me at Wicked, Sunset and Friends & Family, as well as the
FMR and the smaller parties.

Hello SFRavers !

 RE: The Pre-Wedding Party at Bonny Doon - I will be providing a shade
canopy to protect the mixing table .  I was thinking - wouldn't it
be nice if folks brought little things ( flowers , little toys , etc. )
to decorate it ?  The shading material is an open weave , and the holes are
probably big enough to poke threads or string through. And there are
the four corner poles to tie stuff onto.

 Let's do it up glad !

Warning--shameless plug to follow:

Just a short note to let you guys know that my new mix tape, Resonance, is
now available. I'm pretty excited since it has been almost three years (if
you don't count the Connection 2 collection) since my last tape. 

In the Bay Area, you can get them at Ameba, BPM, and Primal Records. If
you're in Socal, drop me a line and I'll let you know where they are
available. 

Take care,
Lee

And of course genetic engineering might someday allow human biology
to be configuarable.  Sexuality seems to be a relatively flexible
trait.  There are invertebrates (at least one species of fish) that
will change gender under certain naturally occuring conditions.

I've always felt that the only chance for the continued survival of
the human race will be through an evolution that transcends our
biological origins (yes, there is a paradox here).  Though I usually
think about this in terms of spirituality or psychology, it  will
probably have to occur physically as well.  Supplementing our brains
with chemicals or computer interfaces are a couple of near term
examples.

I think raving already points us in this direction. There isn't a
single human who can keep time like a drum machine, yet for some
reason, that perfect beat feels so right.  Sure, we still like to have
our emotions triggered by a vocal sample or some irregularity in
the rhythm, but a large part of the rave experience (for me) is to
reach a state that takes us beyond our human limitations.

Another brief bio:

Name:  Ivan Lamont

Occupation:  Computer Programmer and Loud Guitar Player

Personal stats:  5'10" brown eyes brown hair, born in Dublin Ireland some 26 
years ago, moved to USA last summer, often seen raving with a Atlanta Braves 
cap on my head, maniac grin on my face and a rust covered blue 71 Cadillac 
Coup de Ville somewhere in the background.

Nickname:  Speedy (not sure why, exactly  ;)  )

Rave history:  First rave was in London in 1989.  Watched and participated 
in the Explosion of the ravE scene in Dublin until 1994, first US rave was 
Moonlight about 3 months ago where I met so many incredible people that my 
mind melted.  :)))   I used to think there was a really good techno/dance 
music scene in Europe but the DJs in northern Cali leave no room for 
argument!  This is the BEST scene I have ever experienced.  And the 
locations here simply defy description!

Music preference:  DJ Dan (sorry Galen, you made 2nd) and preferably 
outdoors on _solid_ ground!!

The only other note I can add is that I have a lot of friends visiting me 
now and over the next few weeks from Ireland, and I'll be bringing them to 
as many parties as I can - this has to be seen and experienced to be 
believed!

Peace!

Ivan   :)   <ilamont@visa.com>  <ilamont@msn.com>

Hi Matt!

Thanks for the welcome!  Just to set the record straight though, I'm from North 
Oakland, not Reno.  I too would like to read more about the sfraves 
family...good idea.

Peace, Love, Friendship, Dance

Hi y'all,
 I'm actually wwaaaay up north, (west coast Canada actually) and I have 
created a new scene zine for all interested in net/dj/goodmusic/art 
culture. Not just music, hardcore, techno, gabba, rave, acid, if you're 
into it I'm puttin it up.
 I'd like you to check it out, and as well I'm very interested in having 
some of you sfravers contribute in the way of reviews of music, shows, 
nights, whatever. If you're into the scene I want to hear from you. 
Everything you suggest will be considered, and probably put up. Unless I 
get stuff thats duplicated. I want to have a site that's being updated
every other day, not just every other month.
 Please check it out and tell me what you think.
 Thank-you
 Keep the spirit alive!

Well, since this seems like it's going to be the SFRaves event of the
century, I'll offer my skills as a balloon twister extraordinaire (yes, I
was one of those balloon guys at Chevy's that would come around to your
table and make balloons) at the beach.  I can put them up around the tarp as
well as making hats, flowers, etc. for whoever wants them.

As long as we're on the topic of future stuff, I just wanted to bring up
stuff I've read about and thought about for a while.  It's great that all of
us can talk in this fashion over the Internet, but what about the people who
can't?  I mean, usage of the Internet has shot up _exponentially_ since I
started using it two and a half years ago, much faster than anyone would
have expected.  Does this mean society will be divided into the have's and
have-nots, the hooked up ones and the people who are computerless?  It seems
like in the information age this could cause a deadly schizm in society.  I
know that at least one senator (can't remember who) suggested making
terminals publicly available to prevent this from happening... right now a
lot of people view email and web-browsing as a high-class toy, but how many
of us rely on it a lot?  I know that I do.  When my mail server goes down,
it's more detrimental to my work than if the postman got lost.  And in the
next couple of years, it will only be true more so.  Just a thought...

I'll try to be brief: (uh, maybe not)

I'm 25, 5'8", shoulder length brown hair usually pulled back in a pony tail
with a multi colored schrunchy.  I currently have a go tee (I have no idea
how to spell that)  Facial hair is what I mean.  I have hazel eyes.

Let's see, I'm really into sound.  I play various hand drums.  I write
music, some dubby, some techno, some trance, some breakbeat along with live
drumming. I dj ambient, and have been seen spinning at alot of Sacramento
parties.  I made it to several Sunset parties this summer and met a few of
ya's, but I'd like to meet more.  I gotta get one of those laminates.  I was
also at Burning Man, but mostly did my own thing.  I totally love what this
list has represented for me.  My attitude toward raving/PLUR has changed
quite a bit since I joined.  I used to think of raving as a place to party
and do chemical substances, but now I strive to feel VIBE and attain higher
states of consciousness on my own....and boy-o-boy when it works do I feel
good.  I really attribute development of VIBE as a reality for me to this
list and all of you amazing people.  Thank you sooooooo much.

I work for the UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento and that's the whole
reason any of you have heard from me.  My account is at work.  I'm working
as I write this.  I'm also listening to my Secret Life of Trance cd in my
office right now.

I'm really into my spirituality, which is all wrapped up and interweaved
with my music, dj'ing and drumming and every other aspect of my life.

I have a wonderful girlfriend Phelps, whom I share many of my life
experience with and who loves to rave.  Every once in a while when we are
dancing together we get into this groove and completely let go and bug out
all over the place.  The feeling of being able to let go and be totally in
your own moment, fully connected with the Universe, then to look over and
see someone you love soooo much buggin and boppin and flailing just as much
as you are, is incridble.  I wouldn't trade those moments for anything.

I like plants.

I love you.

Rick

I found this to answer some of the BM "unknowns".

I especially like the part of creating your own intimate environment should
you not care for the masses. Something, I think, we can all relate to.

Thought you all might be interested in what Larry had to say about the
Burning Man 95.  I think theres alot here we can take into our every day
lives. Specially Number 2 about The Evil Other.

Well, why not.  After all, I don't get down there very often from rainy ol'
Vancouver (gotta buy a plane!) and so don't get to meet half as many of you
as I'd like ...

I'm a 26 year old Canadian/Scottish lassie, 5'4" or so, long straight red
hair, green eyes, tattooes, body piercings, the whole shebang.  I live by
myself with three cats named Nineveh, Morphia and Drucilla, and a white rat
named Spoosh.

Currently I work as a graphic designer with a small print shop, also I'm
sort of a landlady as I lease the basement of my house out.  I do a lot of
work with the Northwest raves mailing list with photography and doing the
ID laminates.  If any of you Vrave, I'm Pounce!

Musicwise, I tend to be into trance & goa & ambient .... stuff with more
flowing melodies and sensual beats.  I like things that are sparse yet
intricately layered, if you know what I mean ... I write and record my own
music, playing keyboards, bass, flute, some guitar and I sing.  :)  I don't
like exclusively "rave" music though, having great fondness for Pink Floyd,
The Doors, Grateful Dead, disco, The Police, Soundgarden ..... and
Pachelbel!

I'm fascinated with people and language and communication ... I love to
talk to people ... especially I enjoy rounding up a bunch of folks after a
rave who I've never met before, and taking them home for tea and chillage!

Other shit I like includes cooking, massage, paleontology, entomology,
flying kites, doodling cartoons, bike riding, snowball fights, astronomy
...

Hope to meet more of you awesome sfravers next time I'm down your way ...

HEllo!

As some of you may already know, my name is Rikki Kiefer, I live in Oakland 
near Rockridge and I'm an Administrator for Lead Generation Marketing @ Sybase, 
Inc.  I'm 28, 5'5", petite, dark red/burgundy hair, flashy green eyes, 
double-pierced nose, big warm grin and heart!

I just recently started working with Sybase and learning all about software and 
computers, and I'm absolutely nuts about it!  I hope to transfer into one of 
the engineering depts. where they'll train me to program and do product 
design.  I'm becoming somewhat of a technofile and am trying to find a way to 
integrate my computer/music/design interests.  

I used to go to raves back in the early 90's, stopped for awhile and just 
started again this summer.  I kicked it off with The Orb, which was great but 
not as good as the '93 show.  Nation was the most impressive rave I'd been to 
in a long time even though it was a bit larger than what I like.  I've been to 
a couple Wicked parties, Stompy Stomp, Tribal Funk, Sunset and Spundae...all 
pretty impressive, but I thought the Wicked parties had the best vibe.  Simply 
love all the music, but especially the hard thumpin' and pumpin'.

Even though it sounds like it's becoming a bit trendy, I too want to learn how 
to DJ more than anything.  

I'm a dancing fiend, but work, the toll massive partying takes on my body, and 
the expense doesn't afford me to go as often as I'd like.  Also, like I said in 
my post, 'Meet Me!', I don't find people that often to go with... so 
people...drag me out more often!!!

Like I said before, "I feel like a lost nomad searching for my tribe"... so I'd 
like to share my take on the rave scene with ya all.  I posted it in, "You 
Gettin' This?"  Love ta hear some ideas on the subject from you alls.  Thanks 
sooo much for Phuture's response...I really appreciate it.

 WHOA!  I *just* felt and earthquake over here in Emeryville...anyone else?  
Yikes!!!  1:38 PM.  9/13

Peace, Love, Friendship, Dance

Rikki

Greetings!

I've just finished and begun mass-producing (12 copies so far!) a new mix 
tape which I would like to distribute FREE to any interested sfravers.  

The music is as follows:
     SIDE 1: 142bpm, mostly spacey, reverbed, acidic techno-
	     some of the more well-known labels represented are
	     Warp, Underground Resistance, +8, and TZ
     SIDE 2: 105bpm for the first half, percussive ambient which 
             slides into slamming, crunchy 160+bpm techno for
	     the remainder of the tape.

If this sounds like music you'd like to listen to, email me requesting a 
copy, and I'll send you one if I can, otherwise I'll arrange to meet 
you at a party or maybe somewhere in the Berkeley area if you're close by.

I'm not asking for any money for the tapes, but if you do anything 
creative- djing, making music, computer art, or whatever, I'd love to trade 
you for your tape (or whatever your product may be).  

For those of you who don't know me, here's a short bio:

I'm a student, radio dj, and amateur electronic musician, and have been 
on sfraves for about 3 years (including last year while I was in India and 
Nepal- in which time I racked up over 10MB of messages!).  I've dj'd at a 
couple of sfrave parties and have had a radio show at KALX for the past 
few years as well.  I used to go by the dj name of MESCALINA, but 
now I'm just plain old Seth again.

See you all sometime soon...

Hi folks,

Well, Veronika and I went to South Park for the SFR lunch. There were lots
of folks there, but it was impossible to tell who was from SFR. We bought
our burritos and started walking around cluelessly. I turned to Veronika
and said, "I don't really feel like asking everyone in the park if they're
here for the rave lunch, let's just find a nice spot and eat." The guy
walking next us turns around and asks, "Did you say rave?" "Yes," I said.
"Im looking for the SFR crew as well but I don't know what they look like
either," he said.

The 3 of us sat down together and had a really nice time. Our new friend's
name is Martin. Turns out we have lots in common, especially a strong
interest in snowboarding (any other boarders out there?). We had all been
to BMan, and we discussed that for a while.

I imagine there were other SFRavers there as well. I guess "laminates at
lunch" might not be a bad idea...  =o)

     That sounds cool to me Seth, I'd love to have a copy. I'm glad that 
alot of you guys make a great variety of music available for us to sample.
When Parick and I were at BM this guy gave us a tape called 
Theta:Blip. OHHH it was  so good! I saw a post mentioning it, so if you 
can get your hands on a copy, DO SO ;). We'll be at Booney Dunes on 
Saturday, see ya there hopefully .

Anyone in SFRave land,

Me and Craig are trying to get to Harbin tommorrow to hear Garth,  Tracy
and a few others who will be DJ'ing for Dance night.    I have a car
w/ gas,  just need someone with valid license to drive us there.

Looking for ANYONE...  PLUS I am willing to pay for the Driver's
Harbin fees so they won't even have to pay anything.   Just the
Driver of course and I also have room for 5 others,  but they will
have to come up with approx $15.   I have a Harbin membership card
so we get a discount.

We plan on leaving as early as possible tommorrow (Sometime around
noon) to arrive late afternoon to indulge in the pools and Craig will
cook up a super veggie meal (assuming tha people will bring raw
vegitables/rice/whatever.   Then,  after eating a great meal,  we
head out to dance for 5 hours in a really cool place.   Afterwards,
back in the hot pools again and an overnight camp on the porch and
leave in the morning on Friday.

Any takers... PLEASE either respond to this Email,   or phone
me at 1-800-381-5847    <---- Yes!   Even the call is free.

Thanx
Crunchman

Ooops! Maybe I should have yelled out, "SFRAVES LUNCH HERE!"

Anyway I brought some of my co-workers, minus Brian B. (he spaced out, too).
I saw Derek Chung in the park and we sat down with him. Then Amy asked 
about the SFRaves lunch and sat down with us. Since I don't have a 
SFRaves lamient and I forgot to get one at Burning Man, I will wear one 
of my NERaves badges. 

We'll try this again next week, eh?

I'm a 25 year-old Gemini. According to my driver's license, I'm 5'11", 
though I haven't checked recently. You can see my mug at: 
http://www.lowres.com/lowres/huh.html 
(you can also see the faces of SFRavers Bart Cheever and Cindy Kawakami here)

I'm an associate producer at an interactive movie/videogame company 
Digital Pictures in San Mateo. Look at: www.digikids.com to see the kids 
product, Kids on Site, I worked on last year. In my free time, I produce 
a music tv program and am co-producing a film + video festival 
(http://www.lowres.com/lowres/).

I live in a SOMA apartment with two roommates Scott Pease, fellow SFRaver 
- Bart Cheever, and Bart's cat, Trouble. You can see pictures and 
descriptions of Trouble and our apartment at: 
http://teleparc.infoweb.or.jp/en/junc/hitch/dry00724.htm
This (http://teleparc.infoweb.or.jp/en/junc/hitch/index.htm) is a site 
documenting the trip to California by two very wired Japanese guys. You 
will finds pictures and text about AREA 51 (the rave we took them to), 
Hyperreal, and many other Bay Area cyber spots.

I first got interested in dance music in the late-80's attending 
underground clubs and illegal warehouse parties in high school (Mountain 
View) in the Bay Area. Upon moving to San Diego to attend college, I got 
involved in the growing club and rave scene. At it's height I wrote and 
edited the San Diego underground club column for URB Magazine (my year 
end report for '92 - the year it blew up! was 3 full pages long), ran 
the Statik Line - a free underground club and rave hotline, and produce 
several events most notably the Orb record release party in San Diego and 
in SF at the Planetarium. 

While in San Diego, I created the country's first underground dance music 
video show, Flux, showcasing ambient, acid-jazz, house and techno music 
videos as well as interviews and footage of raves.

When I can get away I like to hike on Mt. Tam and in the Muir Woods, watch 
Indie and Foreign films and read Int'l magazines. My favorite rave of all 
time is the first Narnia in San Diego, though I liked the FMR at BD Oct '93 
VERY much. Mark E. Quark is the DJ that will consistently get my feet moving 
on the dance floor. I use a Macintosh.

I hope to meet many of you on Saturday at Bonny Dune.

Attention Raving Goddesses & Gods:

	If anyone wants to carpool to F8 from the Marin area I'm the
	woman to call as I have room in the auto...

	I've been thinking about all the cool things ravers are lately
	(fun, loving, friendly, thoughtful, great taste in music...)
	and I was wondering if we've got many environmentalists, 
	especially VEGANS. I came to the decision to go "all the way"
	vegan as a result of a particularly educational night of 
	raving myself... Anyway, veganism is good for the soul but we
	need the support of each other so if youre out there let me
	know, ok? I know some cool tricks in the kitchen =)

	Secondly - If Jen or Chris who I met at a Freq 8 about 2 months
	ago are out there listening... Jason wants to get in touch with
	you... e-mail him at: jsydes@hmc.edu.

						Groove On and...

						keep up the good work

						(i've been smiling since i
						got on sfraves)

Since most of you are on the topic:


Name:  Andrew Paul Dressler
Birthdate: September 16 1972
Hieght: 5' 7 3/4"
Weight: 155
Hair: Brown
Eyes: Brown

I've lived in Sacramento all my life. I come from a big family.
(enough history now for the good stuff)

I'm a self employed sound engineer. I specialize in permanent club
installs but mostly I do live engineering, BIG MOBILE CLUB SYSTEMS, and
recording. Most of you who know me know me from doing sound at raves.
I also work part-time at K&K music here in sac selling equipment.

BSP mode: Yes I give discounts to SF-Ravers
end mode

I attended ARC here in sac and also CSUS

Likes:

Big smiles, big hugs, people who don't NEED drugs to have fun(note the
word NEED), honesty and straight fowardness, big fuzzy stuffed animals,
big kisses, monty python and the holy grail, pasta, food, eats, cooking,
beautiful female voices, self confidence, and most of all, friends!

Dis-likes:

Frowns, lame hugs, people who can only FEEL IT when high on drugs,
judgements, fish, alcohol,  Ishtar, smokers, and most of all
RUSH LIMBAUGH!(hehehehehehehehehehehehe)

Although I have been doing sound for raves for almost two years, the
first time I went to one to have fun (and do E) was about a year ago at
Wicked. I attend them regularly and in all actuality you will find me
sober most of the time.(E causes me to have really bad sinus infections)


Best talents:

Not being able to sing(hehehe), E journeys(if your high ask me for one),
hugging(first place in the all nationals tourney last may in SF)(hehe),
roller blading, messing around on computers.
ALWAYS BEING IN A GOOD OPTAMISTIC MOOD!

I'm assuming I'll see a bunch of you at Laura & Brian's gig on Saturday...

As for a bio for those that don't know me, here's a bit.  About a year
ago, I moved to Hollywood to work for Jim Cameron at Digital Domain.  
Before that, I grew up in Detroit, and have a lot of deep feelings for
that wretched hole.  I have worked with several record labels there,
getting them connected on the Internet and progressing them into the
modern technology of animation and visual effects.  I still am in
close contact with many people there, and am always preaching the
gospel of Detroit to the unwashed masses here in the West ;-)

Personal stats, I am an Irish male, 6', 280#, blue eyes, reddish
hair cut in a spikey flattop.  I have worked as a bartender, a bouncer,
a purchasing agent, an MIS developer, and currently as a Digital Effects
Coordinator (a lot like an air traffic controller, but with special effects).

All,
Seeing that this weekend is going to be the SFR Massive Gatering  heres my
post:

For the many who don't personally know me Im gonna jump aboard this bandwith
for a bit and give introduction....

Hi!

Im Adam.  Adam is 5'6" 145lbs. Hispanic.  He is a Front End Manager @
CompUSA. He has been in the scene since 90. I can't even remmeber the first
rave I went to. Although I've been going on strong since then (at least once
a weekend).  I guess the main draw to undergrounds for me was my brother.  He
used to DJ under the guise of Luie Lou and I usually got free 'ins' at these
events... My bro left the scene in 92 or 93 (as the Hype died) and I ususally
DJ'ed @ small parties (X parties as we called em') under the name of Nextacy.
 I generally don't DJ anymore since I don't have 1200's (but I do have the
records still).  For me this is a way of life, I can no longer imagine my
exstance w/o raving...
Favorite cuts are jungle, hardcore and impossibly fast BPMs as well as the
old 909 beats. 
Dancing is my favorite hobby. I grew up around breakdancing and been
intergrating the breakdancing, tribal stompings, and ravedancing styles in to
my own madness =).
I can usually be caught buzzing around a speaker or dancing in front of the
turntables/ dj area for hours on end...

Non-raving hobbies include Martial Arts, reading, chatting in general,
japanese animation and appreciating other music / visual arts.

Fav saying: When we die we turn into frequencies.  Music is everything....

Peace, happiness and wait for 1/2hr after eating until you go into that
pool...

Adam

C-ya'll @ Cybertrance.....

I think that could be extra, but I'm not sure for who.  Laws of supply and

        Well i'll make this short as i know from going to Art School that
the thing that artists do best is talk, especially about themselves ;)
        My real name's brad finlay and, right now, i don't live anywhere
near San Fran. I'm in Montreal but i must be somewhat of a masochist to
inflict all of your beautiful postings on myself and not allow myself the
chance to meet you all :) OH well, i just got a job doing HTML programming
(for an online shopping catalogue :P) so i'm planning on a short vacation
(which would hopefully turn into a move at some point) to San Fran for the
early winter :)
        You don't want to know what montreal winters are like :P *brrr*
        I think i'm on this list out of curiosity about San Fran, and the
area being that i am planning a move soon, and also that, to be completely
honest, teh people who post on here and the topics covered blow me away.
It makes it all worth it for me to slog through BSPs for things i can't
attend and reviews that i've never been to :( just to read the intelligent,
mature, 'spiritual' (wish there was a more apt phrase) and open minded
writings of ppl on here. You all are really something, is there something
in the water there? ;)
        So, i graduated from Concordia U in MOntreal w/a Baccalaureate in
Fine Arts, i do graphic design/HTML programming to get by, iv'e got a web
site w/some of my flyers (including some of the progress ones from San
Fran) and the web site is completely self-indulgent so i'll leave it at
that. :) I love dancing, in fact i'm thinking it's a biological necessity
to get your energy flowing again and prevent getting yourself all backed
up...energy constipation ;) Thing that moves me the most: super hard
chicago acidy house a la Robert Armani, Mike Dearborn, Relief Records,
stuff like that. I also love Autechre, Aphex Twin, Global COmmunications,
The Higher intelligence agency and other 'intelligent' stuff..along with
Muchos Ambientos like Pete Namlook, SpaceTime Continuum, stuff like
that....
        I guess that's about it :)
                peace to all...
                                brad

I hope I don't make this post twice, I have been having serious problems 
with my mail server....

My name is Dana.  

Perasonal Info:21 years old, 5'7", weigh 125lbs., have short black hair, 
brown eyes, freckles on my nose and a few tats.....I work for a local 
telecommunications company.

I live in Baton Rouge, Louisiana..The reason I subscribe to SFRavers is 
because I am planning a trip and SF is the place I want to be...I would 
eventually like to live there, but I am going to take my vacation there 
first to check it out(I have never been before!)

I went to my first rave about 2 years ago and knew that it was for me!  
That was one of the best nights of my life...The problem is that there 
aren't many ravers in this part of the country and it takes us a while to 
raise the funds to have a memorable rave....Even so, I don't think our 
raves come close to ya'lls.  The raves you describe seem magical, almost 
impossible.  I am moved by every post I read.

Aside from working and raves(the few we have), I love eating good food, 
reading inspirational works, and being around good people...

I hope I can make plans with some of you during my trip, maybe you can 
give me the reasons I need to stay!!


peace and love

Dana

     Hi all,
     
     Since everyone's going bio-crazy, I thought I'd point those of you who 
     are web-connected to the (warning, quite lame) web pages I started in 
     commeration of Brian and I getting married.
     
     Just go to http://www.hyperreal.com/~laura/ and dig around.
     
     A biography of Brian's life is in some ways a biography of hyperreal, 
     so if you've never checked out the hyperreal home page 
     (http://www.hyperreal.com) then give it a whirl.  More info than you 
     can shake a stick at with regards to raves, music, psychoactives, the 
     Apache web server, and who knows what else.
     
     See you on Saturday, and thanks for the enthusiasm and good wishes 
     that have been sent our way.
     
     Laura

   well my life is far less advanced than most of yours, since I am probably
the youngest person on sfraves.  
         Um...  my name is Matt Brooker. I was born in San Diego, in 1977,
making me 18 years of age!!!!  I moved six times to get here to sacramento.
 finished high school in june, and am going to college in seattle, UW.  

      I have been involved with music my whole life, I have played the
Bassoon for 10 years, and music has always been my life.  I dicovered house
music through a friend many years ago, and have been raving off and on for
three years.  my first rave was a casper rave in 92.  I didn't really start
raving full time until a year ago.  
                     In my spare time(while not raving) I enjoy people,
books, music,and people.  I am really interested in people, the way they act,
the way they interact, etc.  I plan on majoring in psychology, and going to
med school to become a psychiatrist, and use that to do research.  And if
that dosn't work out I am also into the production of music, and may end up
doing something in the music field.  

   so now that I have either completly bored you, or stimulated you, I am
leaving for school on sunday, and will have the same address in seattle if
any of you feel like writing. I havnt decided whether or not to keep sfraves,
but if so, then you will all be blessed by my presence in the future. 
                My bro lives in sf and raves, so I am sure I will be down
raving in the future with my laminate.  

love you all,

matt

hmmm...let's see.  i grew up in milwaukee, WI where i graduated from high 
school this past june.  in july i moved to SF to work for my bro's 
company cyborganic bu mostly i just worked on my own site for my zine.  i 
do a zine called anonymous and it is online and all.  i call it the sassy 
of rave zines cuz it is a rave zine done by and for girls and stuff:)  i 
was pretty active in the midwest scene when i lived there...i have kinda 
cut back since i have moved to SF but i have been to some seriously 
groovy parties since i have been here.  so now i go to mills college in 
oakland and most of the time i am stuck here cuz i have no car so feel 
free to offer me rides places!:)  i like it at mills.  all the girls are 
really cool ( it is a women's college if ya didn't know) it is kinda too 
PC for me but its all good.  the highlights of my summer were a party in 
july in dayton,OH called fantastic voyage (i got to see all my mw-raver 
friends for the last time for a long time and it was an awesome party) 
and burning mnan which i am sure everyone is sick of hearing about:) i am 
18, really short, big smile, brown hair and stuff.  i gotta go to class 
now so thats all:)  hope to see you all soon if i ever get off this 
campus!  just kidding...i will be at TND tonight;)

I guess I'll jump in the fray -

Joe Rice, born 7/25/72 in Salem, Oregon - I'm 6'5, 210#, brown hair,
glasses sometimes. Started raving April 1992 at Circa '92 when I lived in
LA. Got sucked into it and haven't outgrown it yet. =) Started DJing about
a year later so I could play Chime and Papua New Guinea back and forth as
much as I wanted. =)

Threw a few parties in LA, which made me lose respect in promoters in
general, but then started working with the Justice League in Santa Barbara
and I regained that respect. *Contrary to popular belief I never lived in
Santa Barbara, however*

I moved up to SF in 9/94 and have enjoyed meeting numerous SFravers at the
wide variety of events up here. My life has also been greatly enhanced by
getting to work with the F&F crew.

Music wise, I like dubby ambient and Detroit style techno/deep techno with
forays into techno bass/electro and funky acid house stuff. With the
occasional gabber polka, of course. =)

Favorite DJ's: Tony, Monty, Markem, Mark E. Quark.

Joe

Continuing on the bio theme...

My name is John Darrow, I'm 23 years old, 6'2" and pretty lean.
I don't post too often, but I have been around sfraves for about
3 years, so most likely most of you have seen me somewhere, in 
the background, smiling.  I got my first exposure to acid house
in 1988, listening to Steve Masters play his 1 hour show of "trippin
tuesdays acid house" in the middle of the night on Live 105.  I
bought lots and lots of records and took them back to Mount Shasta
where I went to high school, where I danced maniacly in my own
lonely understanding of what was to come.  I have danced in and out
of madness ever since, finishing a degree in physics while I struggle
between universal coherrent order and ego.  My main interests lie
in sound and acoustics.  My thesis is on active noise control.  Right
now I'm making web pages for a living... (see the new www.ucsc.edu for
an example, rather administrative and dull) and I live in Santa Cruz
where I very much enjoy life.  I'm a very spiritual person and beleive
very strongly in my meaning and the spirit of the rave.  I try to
express this meaning in my music, dancing, and understanding.
(Like many of you I have a large stack of electronic boxes and
wires which tend to overheat and distort themselves into chaotic noise.)

I beleive in morphic resonance, and the importance of coincidence.
hence my advice, you must be very very patient, meaning will
come to find itself.  The anthropic principle on all levels.

and if you aren't quite sure what those theories are, they just mean
you gotta be yourself to make the world fall into place.

You can see pictures and more at
http://www.ucsc.edu/mb/people/Spring.95/john.darrow

I love you all.

be seeing you,
-john.

I wasn't going to post one of these things because I'm so used to 
lurking on this list. But now that I'm actually meeting some of you I 
figure it would only be fair to let you know who I am. First of all, 
check out:

http://www.organic.com/Staff/ogd/

There's more information on me there than most anybody wants to see.

Yes, I work at Organic Online with Cindy Kawakami, Brian Behlendorf, 
and Rocky Mullin (one third of Weird Blinking Lights), as well as a 
plethora of other cool people. I've lived in the Bay Area for less than 
a month but I've been lurking on SFRaves for two years now, and have 
known Brian (via the net) for a decent period of time.

I'm 6'2", have brown, long hair, have multiply pierced ears and a 
piercing in each nostril. I tend to shy away from pictures because I 
don't think of myself as being very photogenic, so that description 
will have to do until y'all get a chance to meet me. I have a fashion 
sense but I'm too cheap to actually go out and spend money on clothes, 
so I often look a bit threadbare.

I'm a software engineer here at Organic, which entails doing database 
programming and Java development. I enjoy my job lots (not too 
surprising, considering that it's the reason that I moved to San 
Francisco) but I think I spend a bit too much time at the office, like 
just about everyone here. 12-14 days are not uncommon here.

I'm also a DJ, although I haven't done any spinning out in the Bay Area 
yet. I'm actively looking for gigs and I have no problem with sending 
out demos to people, so if anyone could link me up, that would be 
great. I spin a fairly wide variety of styles, all of which fall under 
the overall heading of "techno". I like Detroit techno soul lots and I 
really dig cold, experimental techno a la Leo Anibaldi and Locust. 
Everything else falls into a matrix somewhere in between. I love 
trading tapes with people, and I also just enjoy giving away my tapes. 
Music and DJing are things that are made for sharing. If you want to 
hear what it is that I'm into drop me a line and we'll work something 
out.

I'm also a staff member at Hyperreal, but I've been under the gun at 
work recently (I feel guilty even taking the time to write this) so 
I've been neglecting my duties there somewhat. I'm working on a system 
that will completely revamp how people get at the musical information 
on Hyperreal, and will hopefully make the music archives much easier to 
use.

I have always admired San Francisco's rave scene and it is with some 
frustration I say that I haven't managed to go to a rave here yet 
(unless you count Burning Man). I played a role in starting Missoula, 
Montana's rave scene, and I tried very hard to pattern my organization 
(the Rebel Alliance -- watch for its emergence in San Francisco ;) 
after groups like Friends & Family and the Cloud Factory. Missoula now 
has an extremely healthy and vibe-oriented scene, so I guess it worked. 
:) Whether or not that has anything to do with my magnetic personality 
I don't know.

That's enough about me for now. I look forward to meeting those of you 
that I haven't yet. It's good to be here, and San Francisco is 
seriously rewriting my brain!

yrz,
ozymandias

  Hi, my name is Chris Beaumont, and I've been interested in raving and
computers for quite some time now.. I first became interested in the rave
scene around 1988 when my friend Tim Otis turned me on to some "acid
house" records he had gotten.. Although I'm straight, back then, the only
places in SF to go and hear acid were gay clubs like Gus Bean's many
efforts.. So, Tim and I started a club at the I Beam, "The Acid House"
that I think was the first venue in SF to play exclusively acid house
music. I did visual effects, liquid oil projections, and Tim was the main
DJ. Later on I worked at lots of other seminal SF rave venues including
Recess (the first "rave like" BIG club in SF) and Club X doing visual
effects.. Around 1990 I was approached by Dave Dean and Jim English and
asked to help with their new club Vivid. This was a big success, and later
on it metamorphosized to something called "Club Love". 
I did liquid oil and slide projections, and was in charge of the
space in the basement, which we named the "Ambient Lounge". This space 
was the seminal Ambient space in SF at the time, and many parties were
planned there.. (and in Tornado's incredible VIP lounge upstairs) 
Among these parties was a party called Toon Town. Dianna Jacobs, and 
Preston Lyttle were regulars in the club scene, (Dianna had been working
off and on as a Peachy Puff for quite a while) and they approached me
and asked me to help with a new club they were planning, which would
be, basically, an "electronic playground". I agreed to help, and initially
we planned to have the first event in the basement of Big Heart City.
Although the venue was small, it was a big success, and the stage was set 
for more ToonTown rave
parties. Plans were made for a second party, but unfortunately, we werent
able to have the second party at Big Heart City, since the manager of
Big Heart City, Jim English (now part-owner of Smart Products) disagreed
with a key part of our plans.. We wanted to have a non-alcoholic "smart" bar
selling energizing amino-acid drinks there, as an alternative to alcohol,
but Jim English felt that this would be illegal, and wouldn't let us do it.
(Later on, Toon Town was such a big success that it essentially killed 
Club Love, and then Jim English embraced the smartbar idea.. :)  )

So , we decided to have our first big party at a warehouse, and the stage
for the first big Toon Town was set..  This second party was a huge success,
and the stage for the SF rave scene was set.. Toon Town went on for
over two years.I continued doing visual effects until we had a permanent
venue for Toon Town, and then I was able to realize my plan to set up
a smartbar there.. I did Nutrient Cafe for about three years, until
quite recently, when I decided that, for the sake of stability in my 
life.. to get a real job..

Around the time that Toon Town was breaking up.. (there were a lot of 
personal problems between members of the team, and all of the original 
people, including myself, quit..) SFraves came on to the scene..
The Sfraves crew has performed a valuable function in improving the access
to technology that enjoyed by members of the rave scene...

Sfraves has done really well, and now is integrated with the rave scene..
(Initially, we were not very well known to the local rave community..)
It has served as a bridge in connecting a huge number of people together..
almost like a big family..It is probably the single biggest reason that 
the Internet has become a part of the rave scene..
 My only regret these 
days is that I don't have as much time as I used to to go to SFraves events..



Big hugs to everyone on what must be about SFraves 5th anniversary!
And congratulations to Brian and Laura! May you have many other happy 
anniversaries!

-Chris Beaumont

Hi everybody!  I'm really enjoying reading all of the bios - makes me 
feel close to you all :-)

I mostly lurk since I'm kinda new around here and I actually live in 
Portland but I want to get down there very soon and meet some of you!

Well, I'm a 28-year old female recently hired by my internet access 
service provider, Teleport as technical support person. I'm Dominican and 
German, I have kinda 
long curly brown hair, hazel eyes and skinny :-)  I'm a singer/songwriter 
and I've been into the Dead for a long time enjoying the scene and the 
music then I went to my first rave this summer and was just blown away by 
the vibe and now I'm hooked, not just on raves but the whole vibe and 
philosophies that I feel from the people I've met and the people on these 
lists.  I'm into Terrence McKenna and just got turned on to Alexander 
Shulgin, I'm in the middle of a really cool article on Shulgin in "The 
Face" mag from Europe.  Spirituality is the #1 thing in my life and I try 
to raise my consciousness a little every day.  I'm in a very positive 
time in my life and can't wait to spread the love to you in person (my 
roommate is a flight attendant so I can fly down for like $10!).  So, 
keep on keying, you all make me smile!

Love and kind thoughts,

bren, aka, shakti

good idea !  hyperreal could provide web pages that has bio's on members
of sfraves who send send them in  !  you could web in, go to a page that
has a list of bios of those people who submit them, and check them out !

Hi all,

My name is Glenn and I'm also known as Tigger (a childhood nickname).
I stand at about 5'8", 160lbs, dark brown hair and eyes.

I moved to Seattle in '88 and didn't really start attending Seattle raves
until '92.  The old school rave scene here was controlled mostly by folks
who were more interested in the glam, sex, drug aspects of parties and it
showed.  I joined sfraves in '92 and saw there there was a lot more to
raves and realized at that point that any individual had the power to
impact their environment/scene in a positive way.

In '93 a group of nwravers from Seattle and Vancouver organized the first
FMR in the Northwest. It was done fully in the spirit of what we've learned
from sfraves and it was a great success.  You folks in SF have been and
continue to be an inspiration to us up here in the Northwest.  Thanks you!

In the past couple of years, I've been involved with organizing parties
here including the Choc-Lit Factory, Earthspace, Evolution, NW FMR's and
another group of free outdoor parties called FreeVibes.

More recently, I've been focusing on doing visuals and working with the
Seattle branch of the Ambient Temple of I Magi Nation with dj's Michael
Manahan and Dervish (whom you might have seen spin at a Sunset party two
weeks ago).  We're currently working on an ambient dub, trip hop
compilation which should be out early next year.

I'm a graphic artist/designer by trade and currently work as the MIS
manager for a Seattle local paper called the Stranger.  And yes, I've done
a few flyers for parties here in Seattle.

I like most dance/rave oriented music.  Current favorites are Eat Static,
Banco de Gaia, Goldie and Springheel Jack (I really like ambient jungle!).
I'm really into ambient dub, trip hop also.

I guess that's about it.  Please let me know if any of sfravers plan on
visiting Seattle any time.  I would be more than happy to show you around
and to introduce you to our family up here.

Peace y'all!

Tigger

well, i guess i might as well throw my hat in the ring too.   
	 
	i'm 23, 5'10, brown and blue hair, Mex-Am,  graduated from Stanford in 
Computer Systems,and live SOMA in SF in a cozy warehouse. i've been on sfr 
since day 1, whenever that was, i can't remember anymore. some of you may 
remember me from then, when i wasn't the lurker i am now, as 
rave@leland.stanford.edu. 
	 i started doing the club scene in Seattle in 87 and can remember the 
first time i heard about raves. it was in some brittish music mag special on 
the acid-house scene there (called 88: Summer of Love, i think). as soon as i 
read that artical that i knew ihad to find a rave, which was a much harder 
thing then.  
	i finally found my first rave in the summer of 91 in some small 
warehouse in LA, but it wasn't till the following fall when i discovered 
ToonTowns that i really *understood* what they could be. Woopie Ball of that 
year was definitely one of my most memorable and shaping experiences. since 
then i would include numerous FMR's, Boogie Buffets, and Burning Man. 
	for the first year of raving i lived and breathed raves, and even went 
so far to start a now defunct rave clothing/necklace Co. back when the only 
things around were Fresh Jive and DoNotEat.  
	after too many nights and days spent in dark clubs, i have to admit i 
grew cynical about the scene. now-a-days, i prefer to save myself for small 
house parties or the occaisional *special* event that you know will go off. 
i've learned to balance my raving time with things such as snowboarding, art, 
etc, etc. Currently my roomate and I are working on a series of large 
silkscreens to wheat-paste around town on billboards,etc, so if you see a 
strange image looming over the freeway, it could be us... 
 
<<peace and respect to all>>

   I've been getting out a lot more, so now I can really comment on
   what's going on...

   Come-Unity - still amazes me to see so many people getting down on a
   Wednesday. So crowded it's hard to stay in one place and groove, though.
   Stompy - Chicago meets SF. The DJ after Dani spun really smooth and
   soulful stuff, a great consistent groove.
   Sunset - goin' strong in Berkeley last Sunday. It really does have a
   special vibe.
   the Gardening Club - nice transition into the week. good veggie food too.
   Simply Done - big sound and a big room. probably too large for the
   crowd last night, but lots of room to move yer thang.
   
   Finally, congratulations are in order to SFR's Laura and list-founder
   Brian, as they prepare for a little matrimonial event this weekend.
   The pre-party is Saturday afternoon at Bonny Doon. Come on down to
   celebrate!

                   Mark Your Calendars!!
                          for the
                Burning Man 1995 After-Party

             Friday, 22 September 1995 @ 0830 PM
      Apple Computer R&D Bldg. 4, the Town Hall Theatre
               4 Infinite Loop, Cupertino CA.
---------------------------------------------------------------

Elise and I have quit our jobs and are working nights,
weekends, and holidays to bring you the finest in home video
entertainment from Nevada's beautiful Black Rock desert.  We
are furiously editing stills and videos taken from CyberLab7,
WBL, Team Fun, SPAZ, various web pages, and of course my camcorder.

Whitens the amazing Shark Car as it pulls donuts on the
playa.  See couch surfers, and idiots (like me) parasail over
a hard, unforgiving desert floor (splat!)  RAVE RAVE RAVE
till dawn in the rain!  Witness the mindless destruction of
various computing devices which would have been valued at
millions of dollars only a couple of decades ago.  And
finally, see the burning of a beautiful 40 story? (well,
that's what it said on the web page) effigy of wood and neon.

Additionally, Weird Blinking Lights will perform
electronic/ambient/drone music utilizing vintage analogue
synthesizers as well as state of the art QuickTime music
sequencing software.

Seating? Don't worry there's plenty!:
  The Town Hall Theatre is a facility capable of conformably
  seating 298 primates.  It is the largest conference room at
  Apple.

Food and Drink:
  Oh La La, our on-site caffeine merchant is used to feeding
  hordes of hungry hackers and artists round the clock.  They
  will be on hand for this event.  I have also managed to
  procure a popcorn machine for those who are so inclined.

Directions.Local:
  Apple Computer is located on Saratoga - Sunnyvale Rd at 280
  and is quite visible from the freeway.  There are off ramps
  from both directions leading onto Saratoga.  Head toward the
  large building with green windows to the South-East of the
  point where the freeway and Saratoga intersect.  The entryway
  off of Saratoga will take you to the main entrance, R&D1.
  The theatre is in R&D4 around the back side of campus.  Once
  you have pulled into the main drive, turn left just in front
  of the main entrance.  Go around until you see an entrance
  with the number 4 in front of it.  There will be far too much
  parking so please bring an extra car or two. ;-)  The theatre
  is immediately to the right of the R&D4 entrance.

Directions.San Francisco:
  if (you take 280)
      See Directions.Local:
  else
      See Directions.East Bay:
  endif

Directions.East Bay:
  If you are coming across the Bay Bridge, simply drive down
  101 until you reach 85.  Take 85 to 280.  The first off ramp
  is Saratoga - Sunnyvale Rd.  See Directions.Local:
  If you intercept 101 from a point East of 85, take the
  Mathilda off ramp South and keep driving past El Camino till
  you reach 280.  Apple will be across the freeway and to your
  left.  See Directions.Local:

Directions.Los Angeles:
  Assuming you people don't fly (Reno Air would be best) , you can
  always drive like idiots up *the 5!  Take Diane's Lexus, she
  won't mind.:-)  I have recently discovered that speeds in excess
  of 110mph can be sustained without attracting the attention
  of law enforcement if done after dark (Maxima, the ultimate
  flying machine!).
  But seriously, please RSVP as I am providing crash space for
  the LA contingent.  Bring sleeping bags and such.  The house
  is quite empty and I have plenty of floor space as I have not
  yet purchased furniture.
  ( * You will be pegged as an Angelino if you say things like
  "*the* 5", or refer to 101 as "the Ventura freeway").

Volunteers, Apple Employees:
  I will need an Apple employee to man the main entry.
  Security will not allow us to prop this door open.  Please do
  not allow people beyond the R&D4 inner airlock as the immune
  systems of our friends are not accustom to the strange
  atmosphere within Main Campus.

Warning(s), PLEASE READ:
  Please clean up after yourselves.  It took weeks to clean up
  after that Jittlov thing last winter and I will not have a
  repeat of that.  We must leave the theatre as it was and I am
  not your mother!

  The theatre is *supposed to be* isolated from the rest of
  campus.  But if you *do* find a way, please don't go beyond
  the inner doors of the R&D4 building.  I have been warned on
  three separate occasions that if *any* non-Apple being is
  found lurking anywhere on the rest of campus unescorted I
  will never be allowed to hold an event like this again, so
  please...!

Communication:
  Please title all replies regarding this event with
  RSVP BMan: (foo)
  and send to nozefngr@apple.com
  Now watch, I'll get a whole bunch of "RSVP BMan: (foo)".

  RSVPs would be nice.  Oh La La would like to know how much
  caffeine and goodies to crank out.  They would like to know
  by about the middle of next week.

  If you need to contact me by phone:
  1 800 680 7351 (pager) or
  1 408 862 2931 (Apple voicemail, this will activate pager)

This will be an extremely fun event.  We who participated in
Burning Man will have a wonderful opportunity to share our
experience with our friends.

See y'all at the movies!!

-Chris

Grew up in NY/LI/NJ areas.  Age 38.  Degree in Physics. 
Family: Wife Janie, brother Peter - both "ravers". Parents retired in
Las Vegas - both nonravers. 
Corporate job (working to bring you PacBell's version of the infosuperhwy).
Hobbies:
Writing - finishing a novel, philosophy manuscript, netstuff.
Web Site administrator for Spirit of Raving archives and Council on 
Spiritual Practices (CSP) on hyperreal.
Electronic musician - look for my cut on the upcoming IDM mailing list
"Threads" CD, and soundtracks for a variety of porno movies in the 80's.

I've been raving since the spring of '92, and am mainly into the
oneness-through-music aspect of the experience.  Raving for me is
the closest thing to a spiritual ritual that I have ever participated in.
It has also provide me with some of the most hedonistic fun that I have
ever had. :)

I've tried my hand in organizing parties with two successful sfraves-
sponsered events in GG Park a couple of years ago (Connection Earth, In 
The Light), and learned that it was not such a good role for a control freak
such as myself.  Still, it's an amazing feeling to be able to create an 
environment where people can transcend their differences and connect with 
each other and nature through music and dance.

Nowadays my time and energy is a bit stretched between a variety of
interests so I don't rave quite as much as I used to.  Janie and I are 
pretty much loners, but we are always happy to meet people with interesting
outlooks on life, the Universe, and everything.

Hello =)

My name is Ethan Isaac Miller. I was born on 5.16.67 in Oakland. I live in
Berkeley now with my lovely wife Jenny, my 4 year old son Andrew, and my 1
year old daughter Shannon.

I spent years -- most of my teenagehood in fact -- as an absolutely
ferocious junkie, and later crackfiend. Boy am I glad I made it.

True love and hard raving saved my life =)

Started going to raves three years ago. First party was a HardKiss at the
Trocadero. Never been the same since. Raving turned me right on with a
hardcore burst of happiness, optimism, and most importantly: creativity.

Started throwing parties and DJing 2.5 years ago. Threw two parties, one
called "Home" and one called "Chez Groove" as well as helping out on "Fluid
Grooves" and many "Liquids" as well as two well known ones at the Third
Wave Dance House, the first of which was great the second of which crashed
and burned totally, but resulted in enough soul searching and public verbal
thrashing to ultimately give rise to the ideas behind and the existence of
Friends & Family, the first of which was on January 15, 1994 at the Blue
Cube in SF...

Friends and Family, sfraves, and the community that has arisen out of and
now surrounds both remain great joys in my life and are indeed what I would
consider my life's work.

It's nice to reflect on these things as we get ready to celebrate the
joining of two people without whom much of this might not now exist.

Congratulations Brian and Laura. Live long and prosper. =)

take it easy
ethan

Oh yeah, favortie DJs (in no particular order):

Minor Minor, Joe Rice, Alex Windsor, Bryce, Andrew Astral Matrix,
Allen Ameba

Heya, here goes: 
	My name is Jon Logan.  I'm 6', have brown hair in a lame 
pony tail, glasses, and a generally lanky frame.  I'm 20, although my 21st is 
coming up in two weeks (Sept 28), so you'll certainly find me shaking my 
birthday booty all over the place that weekend.  I'm currently working for 
the Stanford University Medical Center's Networking Team,
MedNet, as an HTML authorer and general roustabout.  I really like my job, 
and I get to use a really cool, powerful computer that inflates my 
masculine aura.
	I'm about to start my junior year at Stanford, and have yet to 
declare a major.  My primary interests include computers (although I 
totally flopped at being a Comp Sci major), film (there is no film dept 
at Stanford), and studio art/design (the art dept at Stanford is quite 
small, and he's probably going to die very soon).  I've recently decided 
to major in Science, Technology, and Society (a cool interdepartmental 
major which lets me take classes in most of the fields that interest 
me).  So I'm pretty excited about that.
  	I'm originally from Green Bay, Wisconsin (where the feminine 
napkin was invented--hooray), and spent most of my life there until 
transplanting myself in San Francisco, the last bastion of resistance in a 
state that's wallowing in depravity and decay... er, something.
	My first rave was in the tiny town of Portage, WI, last June, and 
it was really great.  Ever since I've been hooked on the whole scene.  
	I luckily managed to acquire a car, and since my return to CA, I 
have been boppping all over at Sunsets, FnF, burning man, etc., meeting 
interesting and friendly new people.
	I prefer to dance to hard, acid trance, but thumpin house 
(especially with creamy helpings of fat, deep, bass synth) will get me 
going too.  I particularly enjoy dancing to breakbeats, too, but they 
don't seem too prevalent out here.  I heard a few breaks DJs in the 
midwest, and they kinked my spigot in a big way.  
	My cat, Harley, is my best friend in the world (and is presently 2000 
miles away).  My favorite musician/songwriter/artist/genius is Tom Waits, for 
whom I would give up all the music in the world if I could only listen to 
one person's work.

	Eeek, this is too long.  Thanks for the bandwidth/memories.


	See ya at Frequency 8!

I was born a poor black child...

Just joking!  OK here's important information about me and raving:

STATS

FON (Freak of Nature)
bleached hair, blue/blonde, 5'2" (yes, part of what makes me a FON),
stocky, ear rings, glasses, Italian but not in a crime boss sort of way.
28 but neither look it or feel it, excpet for Monday mornings.  Aries.

Originally from Buffalo NY, spent two years working in DC and moved to SF
three years ago.  When asked if I like it here, I often reply:  "I have
never felt so sure about anything in my life, than how I feel about living
in San Francisco."  Reside in Noe Valley.  Work for a very cool, small
software company in Berkeley.  Marketing/PR/Advertising.

HISTORY OF RAVING

Like many others, I stumbled into it.  Came home from a day at the nude
beach and a neighbor said his DJ friend Lee An was spinning at a small
house party right down the street from us.  Went with a big group of people
but only a few of us got really into it.  Walked into the Blue Cube, hot,
sticky, perfect.  Did my first hit of e with a woman I like and a couple
other friends. Saw religious figures, the light, the end of the tunnel, a
lot of smiling faces.  Friends & Family II  How's that for luck?

Didn't really rave for the next 6 months but rather dated the woman I went
to the FnF with.  We broke up and in searching for some new fun, I started
going out with Lee and his friend Brian.  Couple nights at 1015, but no e
and not a really strong vibe, but I knew it would happen soon enough.
Timing is so important.  Then in the late winter of this year Wicked threw
a free party that exploded, and I again saw the light.  Made many friends
that night, many of whom I hang out with now outside of raving (which is
important for us).  Coincidently met and am good friends with a guy who
moved into the Blue Cube; we had a lot to talk about that night.

Have subsequently met many, many wonderful people and had many great times.

NOTED QUOTE
Stood up in the ambient room of the Friends & Family party that got busted
and yelled:  "APPRECIATE THIS!  APPRECIATE THIS!"  Friends wouldn't let me
forget it for weeks.

AFFILIATIONS
Friends & Family
Hymns & Anthems

FAVORITE DJs
Don't pick favorites, who ever is playing good at the moment.  If you held
a gun to my head?  Ethan, Tracy, Billie Haste, BIOJeff, Jon Carel, Lee An,
Jon Williams, etc...

OTHER SHIT
Prefer outdoor parties, i.e. New Moon.
Love people who are open and honest upon first meeting.  Those people you
feel you've known for years after a five minute conversation.  That's what
I love about this scene.

Out!

Tony

Hi all,

I'm working on an SFR history web page.  If anyone knows the dates of
the following events, it would save me some digging through the archives:

-exact date of the start of sfraves
-start of vrave
-when SFR was moved to hyperreal
-the week SFR was shut down

I bet Brian knows this stuff, but he's probably a little busy now :).

Also, if anyone wants to volunteer to accumulate the bios into a web page,
I'd be able to integrate them to the existing SFR web pages.  If not, 
someone's at least accumulating them and I can handle it later when I have
more time.

Does anyone have a problem with the bios being publicly accessible?

-Derek

is:

A Navy kid ((Navy kids don't really have homes)) but who went to high 
school in San Diego where I became exposed and involved in the local Chula 
Vista straight-edge scene. Although sXe has got to be one of the least creative 
art forms it's also perhaps one of the most unmolested by the mass media. 
One of the neat things about punk rock is that skill isn't 
necessarilly a prerequisite for the job. You can suck and get away with 
it. To prove that point, I spent a lot of time making flyers, putting on 
shows, video taping bands, and making fanzines untill I got tired of 
kicking my friends in the back of the head to testestorone music. San Diego 
is a nice place to grow up and an even better place to leave.

One of the truelly neat things about San Francisio, and the primary reason 
that I found myself going out 2-4 times a week last year, is the public 
transportation. I think people in general ((Buddist may be the exception)) 
are victims to whatever crowd they're associating with at that time. It's 
also really easy to suffocate yourself among a circle of friends that can 
be supportive but also equally restictive. Nobody really enjoys commiting 
social incest just like people usually don't really enjoy driving to a 
party alone, that's a Morisey song waiting to happen. The amazing thing 
about living in SF is that you can *walk* to a party whenever you feel like 
it, hoping onto a bus or two along the way, recogize familar faces, talk to 
friends, dancehowyoulike, and then leave whenever you feel you've nothing 
left to contribute. Walking is always OK. 

I wouldn't be so quick to say raving is my religion, although sometimes it 
does open a line of communication between me and my maker. It's more of a 
ritual that's pretty important to me today, may be my career next year, or 
just a fad after the year 2000. I don't really know the person I am now 
and can only guess who I'll be later. We're all shaped by our experiences 
and those experiences are always happening. 

For me, raving is about dealing with themes of self-esteem, respect, 
courage, sexuality, mob mentality, tolerance, fellowship, loniness, dynamic 
personalities, inspiration, acceptance, and developing meaningful drug 
relationships. It's about *creating* something ((or as much as you can)) 
where your happiness isn't dependant on some one/thing else rather than 
buying into that artifical life mentality. 

The people are also a weird lot. Some strangers will get you high and 
offer you into their homes for sushi. Others will preach about PLUR in one 
breath and crack cripple jokes in the next. Go figure.

Currentlly a (graduating?) Brodcasting major at the State who's wet dream 
is to intern with George Lucas next semester, my hobbies include collecting 
flyers, comics, and looking for anyone to trade Jeno, Mark E Quark, DJ 
Dan, and other cool tapes with. 

Over & Out-

Bolger.

Well why not,

	I'm Gary - Scary was an old nickname - Scottish by
	birth, I'll have been living in the Bay Area for a 
	year come the 28th of this month.

	My wife, Leigh Ann, grew up in this area - we met
	in London, lived in Britain for a while, then made
	the move back here. Altough its has its ups and 
	downs, I've never regretted it. 

	Strangely enough, I've been subscribed to this list 
        (on and off) for a good few years now - I remember 
        old rave reports - people talk about the past, and 
	even though I never experienced it, I can relate to 
	names and events. At that time, I rarely, if ever 
	posted. After all, I was several thousand miles 
	away, and had no idea I'd ever end up living in this
	part of the world. 	

	My first rave must have been about six years ago, 
	though for the couple of years before coming here,
	I rarely went out.
	
	Coming to the bay area has been a revelation of 
	sorts, or perhaps a rebirth. Altough I'm not quite
	the weekend warrior, I head out more often. The 
	scene here in the Bay Area is something very, very
	special.

	I've worked in the software industry for the last 
	six years, doing lots of things - I like computers
	and the things people do with them.

	Lookswise, I'm 6'2, blonde (though shaved), and talk
	in a manner that seems, from experience, very hard 	
	for people over here to understand.
	
	If you see me, say hello.	

	Love, 
	Gary

Subject:       Re: bios!!

First of all let me just say what incredible vibes I've been getting 
off sfraves lately.  It's so great to see everyone so happy and full 
of positve energy.  Thanks to you all.

My name is Scott Rector, aka Scotty, aka DJ Bliss.  I'm 5'11" with 
short curly hair (usually burgundy, sometimes dark blond) I have 
blue-gray eyes, a goatee, and a warm smile that I love to share with 
other happy people.  I wear a floppy velvet hat most of the time, and 
allways when I'm raving.  It's like the ones you see at Ren-Fair only 
better because I make them by hand with great care (BSP).

I grew up in OC and I started raving in LA in 1989.  We didn't call 
them raves, they were Acid House parties, almost allway illegal 
break-in parties thrown in various abandoned warehouses off Alameda 
Blvd in LA.  I moved to SF in 1991 but it took me a while to find the 
scene there.  My first SF rave (and 1st time candy flipping) was 
Wacky Citrus in 92,  It was, and still is, one of the most incredible 
experiences of my life.  I've been to hundreds of parties since then 
but the ones that stick out most in my mind were the first Vision, 
and my first full moon at Bonny Doone in 92 (yes there could easily have been 2000 
people there - MASSIVE!!!).

The things I love most in life are my girlfriend, art, good cooking, 
computers, exploring my spirituality, sensuality, sexuality, 
inteligent interaction with positive, free-thinking, caring entities, 
and music of all shapes, sizes, and colors.  =)
  
The things I dislike are any close-minded, negative, non-thinking, 
non-caring entities. and music with no shape, size, or color.   :(  
  
I've been DJing for around three years, though I haven't had many 
chances to spin live.  I love all types of music but my favorite 
music to spin is trance, and progressive house.  I love percussion 
and I like to play stuff that has lots of interesting rythm, the kind 
of groove that gets into your bones and completely entrances you. 

I currently live in Santa Barbara with my beautiful girlfriend Leigh, 
a wonderful, inteligent, warm-hearted, free-spirited, goddess with 
whom I share an open, spiritual, and passionate love.  She has just 
finished her BA at UCSB, and we plan to move back to the city this 
coming spring.

We get up to the Bay Area around once a month to go raving.  
Hopefully we'll get to meet some more of our wonderful sfraves 
familly in the coming months.  

Well thanks to all who read this for letting me share a little bit of 
myself with you.

cheers,
    Bliss

A Girl's Guide to Geek Guys - By Mikki Halpin and Victoria Maat

So, your crush on the bass player from Vibrating Sandbox has finally died
a whimpering death and you're wondering where to go from here.  All the
sinister dudes are either dating a series of interchangeable high-school
riot girls in baby doll dresses and an overdose of manic panic, or
permanently shacked up with some bitter old lady who pays all the bills.
Which will it be, a wifely prison or a humiliating one-night stand? Into
this void of potential mates comes a man you may not have considered
before, a man of substance, quietude and stability, a cerebral creature
with a culture all his own. In short ... a geek.

1.      Why Geek Dudes Rule

        They are generally available.
        Other women will tend not to steal them.
        They can fix things.
        Your parents will love them.
        They're smart.

2.      Where The Geek Dude Lurks

While they are often into alternative music, geek dudes tend not to go to
shows too often. Instead you'll find them hanging out with their friends,
discussing the latest hardware revolution or perfecting their Bill Gates
impressions. You know how some people wear t-shirts with their favorite
bands on them, thus showing that they went to certain shows? Well, geek
dudes wear t-shirts with the logos of different software companies on
them, thus showing that they are up on the latest ... um, uh ...
releases. A small, though convivial, rivalry may be detected here amongst
the geek dudes. Try wearing one yourself and see if he strikes up a
conversation.  Of course the best way to meet a geek dude is through the
Internet. All geeks harbor a secret fantasy about meeting some girl in
cyberspace, carrying on an e-mail romance in which he has the chance to
combine an activity he is comfortable with, computing, with one he is
very uncomfortable with, socializing. To many geek dudes, cyberdating is
just an advanced form of some kind of video game, but they are frustrated
by a lack of players. Their lack is your strength.

3.      Imprinting

You might notice that these men harbor some strange ideas about how the
world works and some particularly strange ideas about women. There is a
reason for this. Because they've had limited interpersonal experience,
geek dudes must look elsewhere for behavior models. Lacking a real world
social milieu, geeks often go through a transference stage with such
narratives, and try to model their interactions on them. Thus, certain
media images and themes come to have an overly cathected, metaphorized
reality to them, while the rest of us view such programming as mere
entertainment. Case in point, our next topic....

4.      The Trek Factor

If you're not up on your Star Trek, you can forget about getting or
keeping a geek dude. And I'm not just talking vintage-era Captain Kirk
and Spock either. You've got to be up on your The Next Generation, your
Deep Space Nine, your Babylon 5.  Armed with your own knowledge of
Federation policies, you can better gauge when and how to act. The sexual
politics of Star Trek are pretty blunt: the men run the technology and
the ship, and the women are caretakers (a doctor and a counselor). Note
the sexual tensions on the bridge of the Enterprise: the women, in skin
tight uniforms, and with luxuriant, flowing hair.  The men, often
balding, and sporting some sort of permanently attached computer
auxiliary. This world metaphorizes the fantasies of the geek dude, who
sees himself in those geeky-but-heroic male officers and who secretly
desires a sexy, smart Deanna or Bev to come along and deferentially
accept him for who he is.  If you are willing to accept that this is his
starting point for reality, you are ready for a geek relationship.

5.      Once You've Nabbed Him

Of course, catching that geek guy is only half the battle. Keeping him by
your side is another story altogether. I was privileged to speak with
Miss Victoria Maat, who not only got herself a geek guy but was also
clever enough to marry him just a few short months ago. She interrupted
her newlywed bliss to give us a few tips on the care and feeding of a
geek man:  "Geeks are sensitive and caring lovers and husbands. If you
can hang with the techno-lifestyle, they make the best mates. They are
the most attractive people, not flashy or hunky, but the kind who get
cuter and more alluring over time (I told you she was a newlywed).
Definitely give geeks a chance."

6.      Geek Cuisine

Geeks tend towards packaged, junk foods since they prefer to work and
think and aren't all that into cooking for themselves. Make sure that
your geek understands that you are not merely a replicator, and provide
him with home cooked food. A batch of chocolate chip cookies will let him
know that you love him. You do have to monitor your geek for weight gain;
however, remember that most of their days are spent sitting and staring
at a monitor.

7.      Geek Lifestyle

The geek dude has long work habits and tends to bring his work home with
him. He seems permanently connected to his hard disk. You must at least
appear interested in his work. Generally, a solid understanding of the
computer is a must; if you cannot master this, you should at least be
able to talk the talk. Remember most geeks are anal and they get stressed
about details which appear insignificant.  Be understanding, put on your
best Deanna Troi face (see above) and empathize.  To relax, geeks love to
play the latest computer games. Let him play Myst or Chuck Yeager's Air
Combat for hours if he wants to. Act concerned if he's stuck or has just
been ambushed by three MiGs. My geek loves to try to help people on the
Internet who say that they are stuck in Myst. He comes up with clever
riddles instead of directing them point blank. Geeks also like to go to
sci-fi and Japanese animated movies; again, a basically harmless vent for
your man.

8.      Geek Buddies

Many geeks extend their work friendships into what they jokingly refer to
as RL (Real Life, also known as "that big room with the ceiling that is
sometimes blue and sometimes black with little lights"). The greatest
thing about your geek's buddies is that you can feel secure in setting
them up with your girlfriends.  They may feel awkward around females at
first, so don't overwhelm them. In time they will come out of their shell
and realize that you are into the same things they are.

9.      Post-It Note

I thank Victoria for the above advice. I must say that when she read my
draft of the piece, before writing her section, she asked her husband
which one he thought she was more like, Deanna or Beverly. Howard, the
devil, immediately replied that he had always thought Victoria was
actually most like Ensign Ro Laren, a cute character with a slight
authority problem who is always in trouble (this is fairly apt). This
exchange is interesting for several reasons:

  Howard had already thought about who she was most like.
  He could summon up characters from seasons past with ease.
  Victoria actually knew who he meant.
  Folks, I think this marriage will last.

10.     One Last Thing

Because they have been so abused and ignored by society,many geeks have
gone underground. You may actually know some and just haven't noticed
them. They often feel resentful, and misunderstood, and it is important
to realize this as you grow closer to them. Don't ever try to force the
issue, or make crazy demands that he choose between his computer and you.
Remember, his computer has been there for him his whole life; you are a
new interloper he hasn't quite grasped yet.

I wrote mail to Derek Chung about compiling bios and such for the sfraves 
pages. Or someone can easily grep through the archives and gather 
all the info later. However, when I asked people for pictures and urls
awhile back, only a couple of sfravers sent them to me. If you want to 
put any pics up on line of sf events, sfraves people, you can upload them 
to hyperreal.com incoming/sfraves/. 

What would also be cool up on the site would be any thing that has to do 
with the history of the San Francisco Rave scene. 


BTW, SFRaves pages are at:

Subject: I give in!!

    
          O.K. I told myself that I wasn't going to post my own bio because
  I wasn't sure what to include, but all you lovely ravers have given me some
  good ideas of how to start, so here it goes:
 
           I am Reagan Louise Reid, 5'8" with short brown-auburn hair no 
tattoos and just a little ole' belly-piercing. Even though I was raised 
during the blissful ;( Reagan years, I wasn't named after de man. I was 
named after "the Exorcist"; my parents thought that Linda Blair's 
character was cute( before the possesion). I'm 1/4 Irish, 1/4 Italian, 
1/4 Czechoslovakian, 1/4 Yugoslavian.  
          I live in Concord with Black Adder, who is quite dedicated to 
helping with visuals at F&F. I go to DVC in Pleasant Hill and have about 
1-1/2 years left of gen. ed before transferring to the 4- year state 
college of my choice( dunno yet ). I am REALLY interested in Psychology 
and have declared it as my major. I think with all the bios I've been 
reading there should be some kind of online Psych. majors support group:).
        I moved to Suisun, C.A. about 2 years and 2 months ago then to 
Vacaville then  on to Concord. I came from A *REALLY* small 
redneck-tobacco-spitting- society called Stafford, Virginia. How I made 
it out alive; could not tell ya; but I did make it to C.A. 
        My first rave ever was Future in Maryland- May 1993. It was one 
the mainstream $20-$30 parties that i found myself at because I had no 
other outlet to get info. Needless to say I never saw the same person, 
except for those that went with me, twice :(. Now my first REAL rave was 
a FMR in Sacramento in June of 1994. Outside and right near the river.
I was wired 100% and stayed awke well into the following evening. I was 
like a little girl who had discovered Elmo( LOVE him) for the first time!
Since then I 've been raving my ass off. Oh I love ,LOve it ,LOve it. 
I've never been involved with such a scene that I can let go of any and 
all inhibtions( like the hot springs at BM) and fears  and hey be 
MYSELF ; what a concept !!!. I would say that my most liked DJs are: 
Ethan-I listen to that damn Technosis tape everyday-, Carlos and Galen. I 
know that there are MORE out there. A great DJ to me is one that no 
matter how tired I am I will pick myself up and dance. It's just that 
certain beat or just when the music is about to go off that drives me nuts.
I love ,I love It I lo_ Oh I already said that.
   Well there is alot more I can write but I could go on and on.......
   I consider myself a real and friendly person and will talk to anyone.
   See all of you on Saturday!!!! 
            Sending HUGS galoooreeee,
            Reagan

        Well, here's me.  My name is Jake Reichert, I'm 20, have long brown
hair on top, about shoulder length, and really short brown hair on the sides
and back, beard, moustache, about 5'9", 140 lbs., greenish/bluish/greyish
eyes (changes all the time), and long nails, usually metallic blue.  
        I grew up in Huntington Beach behind the Orange Curtain as the child
of two ex-hippies (which I'll tell you has made for an odd childhood), and
all of my friends there were, like myself, people who really didn't care for
Southern California all that much.  We basically hung out and did weird
things (still do, in fact) and drank a lot of coffee.  Unlike most people,
I've been lucky enough to keep my friendship with almost all of them even
after high school ended.  Because of my girlfriend at the time, I started
looking into going to College at USF; up until then I was set on going to
Boston.  Well, it turns out that coming up here was the best decision I ever
made.  I've enjoyed it up here ever since I came, and since I started going
to raves it's gotten even better.  
        I was technologically illiterate when I first got here, but I got
addicted to the Internet within the first couple months of school, sometimes
staying at the computer lab until 6 in the morning trying to figure things
out.  Since then my knowledge of computers has increased dramatically, I've
bought my own computer, gotten an office, and now answer insanely stupid
questions about dial-up internet access for the University (for which I am
reimbursed well :) ).  I'm studying math and physics, although my interests
lie basically everywhere.
        I went to my first rave in April with my friends (some of yours,
too), Sarvi and Jan.  It was Organic down on Army, and it was _great_.  I
was immediately hooked.  Since then, I've spent basically the whole summer
at raves when I wasn't driving to LA and back in Archibald the Wonder Honda.
I've had the most amazing experiences in that time, from the crazy weekend
of Organic in the Park/Freedom where I met mucho SFRavers to the strangest,
most spiritual/psychic event of my life (it's a really good story that'll
make you go "aaawwww...", but it's kinda long so if you want to hear it
email me).  Basically, it made me realize what society could be like if
everyone really tried.  Although I've been to good parties and bad parties,
I keep going because... well, you all already know 'cause I'm sure it's the
same reasons you all keep going too.
        Musically, I'm into techno and ambient.  I prefer the really
fast/really mellow stuff to music in between.  Also, anything on the 4AD
label (if that's not obvious by now).
        Interests: Reading sci-fi, travelling, skiing, writing, making music
on my computer, monkeys, Vaughan Oliver, Carl Jung, Postmodern theory,
Waldo, Computer Graphics, Swiss Chocolate, Hugs & smiles, cats, Duckman,
candles, 42, blue light bulbs, Woolite, Tira Misu, cyberculture, baby
animals, good coffee, Twin Peaks, Winona Ryder, SGI's, my Smith's baseball
cap, general weirdness
        Things I don't like: Michael Eisner, Nasa, politics, getting up
early, The FDA, mean drunks, jeans that are too tight in the crotch 
        Favorite Movies: Jacob's Ladder & True Romance
        Favorite quote (as in my sig): Lonely is as Lonely Does/
                                       Lonely is an Eyesore  (Throwing Muses)
        Weirdest night of the summer: driving two of my drunken friends
around in a limo that wasn't mine with two psycho girls in the backseat we
didn't know who liked cutting themselves up and eventually breaking into a
friend's house to make ourselves breakfast (I live in a sitcom, by the way)

        I could go on and on, and usually do, but that's about it for now.

Jake

P.S.  For those of you going on Saturday that have never written in my book
before, you must do so!!!

P.P.S.  Is anyone that's going bringing any SFRaves laminates?

OK, I suppose I'm more of a lurker, but I'll post a bio nonetheless, I 
think this is a great idea BTW...

Name:		DJ Mr. Bill / Bill Tanksley

Occupation:	DJ of seven years, college student (UNC-Greensboro)

Description:	oh, about 5'6" tall. 135 pounds. very short brown hair, big
		blue eyes.

What I do: 	Well, North Carolina is a big college state, so that 
		explains why we have such a strong scene here (there's lots of
		people in the 18-25 age group). During the week I stay busy
		with school, I'm taking 18 semester hours this fall. On 
		Thursday nights I DJ at my resident spot, "Lift". It's more
		of an intimate club, not very big, but that's a nice contrast
		to the other NC clubs, where you're lucky to see the DJ's
		silouette 2 floors above you. On Fridays I either spin at
		Babylon (my other regular spot & our hottest club), or
		out-of-town. Saturdays are usually out-of-town gigs as well.
		In upcoming weeks I'll be in Tampa (Florida), Salt Lake City,
		Baltimore, Atlanta and here in N.C. Also, I'll be spinning a
		HUGE local party with Funky Techno Tribe on October 7th, and
		we're having the Wicked posse host a party here on October
		27th at Babylon.

Why am I on SFRaves?:
		Good question. I started subscribing to this list last summer.
		I came out there to do a few gigs, and wanted to get a 
		feel for the scene, which is very different in some ways 
		than on the east coast. Thus, after all these months, I'm 
		still on the list, as well as SE-RAVES, FL-RAVES (Florida),
		MW-RAVES & DC-RAVES.

Hobbies/Interests: 
		"Sightings" on Fox; Schlitz Malt Liquor in the new 20 oz.
		bottle; my girlfrind Devina; wasting time on the 'net; 
		getting my groove on; buying records until I'm broke;
		Jerry Springer; my cats Chelsea and Athena; cleaning my
		apartment (not really a hobby, but I'm a clean-freak); 
		shopping; playing good mix tapes in my car and taking the
		long way home; getting the DJ's together for a nice 
		meal out before a really good party; mailing out tapes 
		(it never ends!)

                           --> I *HEART* Bios <--

I was born in the oscillating corona of a neutron star.  Composed from
the quantum state I traveled to the planet you call Earth.  There I found a
young boy on the verge of madness.  The boy was depressed and disspondant,
afraid of a world that held no permanence or consistancy.  I took that boy
for my own, and now he carries my name.  I am the fuzzy bit at the end of
precision, the magic that cannot be controled, the joy of living.

                             I am Purple Tiger

i didnt know jack about raving or trance or ambiant or A until i started 
working at hotwiiiyed about 4 or 5 months ago.  i strikes me as fascinating
that you can wonder around for years completely oblivious to expressions of
yourself that all of a sudden, booom, by a quirk of random fate, you are 
turned onto.  it makes me feel humble.  and keeps my eyes open !

the first time i heard ambiant was when brianb would pop cd's on at hotwiyed.
i couldnt make any sense of it.  at all.  but then one particular sound on
a SeeFeel cd jerked me.  i borrowed it.  i put it in my car cd player, and
drove up to Tahoe.  As i drove out to Heavenly to shred, i put it on, and
then completely tranced out to it.  i didnt even realize it, but then, i
went to get out of the car and fell down in the street !  so soaked was i,
and the world looked strange like i was in a dream and i could not 
remember anything about the drive there.  shit.  

my first rave was an outdoor, Frequency 8 deep in the woods in Marin.  I 
took a hit of acid.  the glow of lights within the darkness bit me.  I 
danced and lost myself in it.  i would stop and wonder what i looked like
dancing.  i was quite afraid !  i looked for someone i knew but knew 
no one.  then someone hugged me, and my sense of self returned.  shit.

it's been a journey since then.  still is.  i am fascinated with dance and
loosing yourself in it.  it seems primal.  it's very real.  i have never 
known moments of tranquility and peace as when i am at a rave and everyone
is smiling and feeling the vibe.  i feel closer to people and special that
i can feel something like that with other people, and have that feeling 
translated and experienced with other poeple.

Due to overhwleming response on the part of those who wish to spin, and a 
suggestion that more DJ's means more variety, here's the lineup for the 
DJ's on Saturday:

1:30 - 2:30: Bryce
2:30 - 3:30: Will-E
3:30 - 4:30: Ozy
4:30 - 5:30: Sho Kuwamoto
5:30 - 6:30: Jon Drukman
6:30 - 7:30: Joe Rice
7:30 - 8:30: Ethan

I think this is the best mix/match of styles and times... if any DJ is 
unhappy let me know, we'll see what we can do.

Everything is go for the party!  The generator is being provided by 
Frequency 8, who will be bringing it down from their party the night 
before.  We still need able-bodied volunteers to help with setup - be 
down at the Bonny Doon parking lot at 1pm to meet the truck.  

Reminder to everyone: bring what you would bring to a day at the beach: 
something to sit on, sunscreen, food, frisbees, toys, anything.  

See you all on Saturday!  

	Brian

better than an upload, would be a cohesive set of pages maintained by
an individual.  sfravers could mail in .gifs, .html, or whatever to
someone in charge of maintaining the 'site'.  for people who have
home pages, there would be a simple link to their page.  i think
it would be a neat core thing to have.  i'd even volunteer to put
it up, but i am sure getting someone to do it is the easiest part.

hello all my family members-
it's rather late thursday might  or early friday morning.  i have been
sitting at my gateway to the world (hilda, my computer) and have been
reading sfraverfamilymember bios for the past hour.

WOW!  WOW!  WOW!  reading these is as intense as my first rave and
e-experience.  i have heard so many things about so many people, i'm speechless.

(but i will speak more, nonetheless)

when i first joined this list, i was cynical about a bunch of people
communicating by e-mail.  that has all changed in the past month that i've
been on.  i'm finding myself crying on my keyboard now(gets my keys kind of
sticky, though) as i ponder how raving and this list has changed my life.
don't mean to sound cheesey, but it has.  you all have opened me up to a new
world of open-mindedness, life, music, and friends that i know without
physically knowing yet.

WOW!  WOW!  WOW!

i love you all.  if this sounds cheesey or sappy to you, too bad.  you are
all wonderful people, and it's odd that it took a mailing list to realize that.

love, love, love, love, love, love, and just a little more love

matt

An addition to the list of bios...

My name is martin. I'm 36 yrs 5'10" 145lbs very short brown hair (the grey
has not completely taken over yet).

I'm a self employed software developer living on Potrero Hill in SF. I've
lived here for about 15 yrs but originally from Eugene Oregon where I studied
Physics, Mathematics, and other nerd related stuff :).

Moved to the Bay area in the early 80's during one of the Silicon Valley
Booms (boy was work plentiful back then). Got heavily into Macintosh
computing and software development  for the data acquisition, process
control, and image acquisition and analysis markets.

Started out in the early 80's frequenting punk clubs like Mabuhay Gardens
(Fab Mab), Tivoli, On boradway... as well as the other end of the spectrum
for dancing like the old I-beam (anybody remember what it was like around
1982?) and some of the more underground wharehouse parties like Anon and oh
well I don't even remember the names anymore. Boy am i showing my age.
Annyway, in the mid-late 80's got burnt out, big time, from all the coke and
speed that was so prevalent wherever I went. I guess what really stopped me
from going out for years was the attitude thang that happened here in SF with
all the clubs and undergrounds. That attitude being the "Velvet Rope" thing.
VIP rooms etc. If you look "cool" enough you could get in. What a bunch of
BS. So anyway I took several years off from going out. (I also fell in love
and that may have had something to do with it :)

About two years ago I went to a YSH (Your Sisters House) party and was
totally blown away at the positive attitudes and acceptance of complete
strangers. I went a little reluctantly knowing only one other person that was
suppose to be there. It took all of about a minute before I was completley
comfortable and out tearing up the dance floor. Maybe it was the door diva
who greeted me with a big smile and a blow pop. (Thanks YSH :) I heard about
the SFRaves list that very same week som some hacker zine I picked up ( the
same zine had an article by Laura on how to start DJ'ing). I joined the list
and thats it.

Some of my favorite parties/events have been... F&F, SPAZ (last summer at
Kalesa I really miss it!), the Jungle, Black Diamond...

Spare time activities :SNOWBOARDING!, organic gardening in one of SF's many
community gardens, good food/cooking, hiking, and at least a month a year in
the islands (warm water snorkeling, waterfalls and rainbows)...

One of my main attractions to this list/group is the PLUR which is not only
preached but practiced...


peace,
martin

PS see you all on saturday...

> -when SFR was moved to hyperreal

Just a thought...you might want to list all the machines that it's moved 
through... of course, it would probably help if i told you what machines
it was on, but that would assume i knew :)

(i'd guess at petrus.berk, soda.berk, techno.stan, hyperreal.. 
but haas.berk sticks out in my mind too.. methinks vrave was on there?
shit... why do i know this stuff but can't remember
where i put my plane tickets for SF this weekend???? ugh)

(btw, i will be hopping through the SF area this weekend,
and will presumably be seeing everyone at the beach on Sat)

> -the week SFR was shut down

Mealsothinks this was 3 days, a weekend... for some reason May of
whatever year it was stands out to me, but i've spent that
past week running around in underground tunnels staring at 
lights through fiber optic cables, so i'm not sure
i really understand the concept of months and years anymore

rhythm?  Bio status?  Bio logy?  Bio graphy!  Auto bio graphy, 
actually.

My name's Rob Jellinghaus, and I'm a native Californian who was born 
and raised on the east coast (namely, Connecticut).  Great place to 
grow up and be a kid, but out here is the best place on earth to be 
an adult.  I'm 26, 6'4", 145 lbs. (skinnier people than me are hard 
to find).

My first rave was a New Moon gathering last summer at Goat Rock.  It 
was pretty much a religious experience all the way through--the vibe 
from that party soaked into me and is still present.  Sunrise on the 
beach, and frisbee all morning, with house music and crashing waves 
filling the air.  Times like that are precious, and it's been great 
to find a whole community of people devoted to making them happen.

I helped out with the April Friends & Family rave, which was 
transcendent (though hazardous) until the cops showed up, giving me 
my first experience of getting busted--lugging my futons out right in 
front of 'em while, er, flying high.  But it was cool.  I also helped 
out at the last F&F (in Oakland)--outrageous that one was!

Rave music just gets into me right at the base of the skull, and 
takes over the signals between my mind and my body.  It's great to 
dance for hours.  Humans have always known this, and ravers are 
keeping the faith.  Raving's gonna be part of my life for a long, 
long time to come.

I don't get out nearly as much as many of you do, but it's only 
because I've got a full and busy life--currently hacking 3D computer 
games (without explosions or blood in them!) for a San Francisco 
company, riding my mountain bike to work (aaahhhhh).  I've got a Web 
site where I do various writing and sex education projects, and 
there's just not enough time in the day for everything.  I think many 
of you know that feeling.  I live with a housemate in San Francisco 
near Dolores Park.  (Where is the NB lunch again?  Wednesdays at 
South Park near Bryant, is that right?)

I look forward to meeting more of y'all on Saturday!  I can't get 
down there by 1 (meeting a visiting Seattle friend at noon in Palo 
Alto), but I will bring a big smile and some frisbees.  Ain't got no 
laminate, but I'll be wearing a tie-dye which is turned up to 11.

Blessings and peace out to all of us!

Hey folks,

Does anyone know of a good place to camp near Bonny Doon? Veronika and I
have been planning a camping trip for the weekend, but we also really want
to come to the party. We thought that if we could find somewhere to camp in
the area we could do both.

Thanx,
ek

ps. We're thoroughly enjoying the bios - keep 'em coming.  =o)

Greetings Sfravers:

Born September 19, 1973 at Grace hospital in Detroit Michigan.  I am a
short Filipino guy with short black hair.  My Fiancee (Nancy Mitchell) and
I moved to San Francisco about a year ago from Ann Arbor (Treetown) MI.  I
came here to work as a Graphic Artist for Morphs Outpost on the Digital
Frontier and Blaster Magazines.  Right now I am working as the Art Director
for NetNoir Online which resides in full form on America OnLine.  You can
also point your browser to Http://www.netnoir.com.  I am also the Art
Director for 4080 HipHop magazine in Berkeley as well as a freelance
Graphic Artist.

In my spare time, I have been working on some trax of my own, I DJ, and I
skateboard (ugh.. I love the EMB, pier 7, the DMV, Fort Miley, and those
crazy SF city streets!).  I am also taking Night classes in hopes of
getting my BFA in Graphic Design at CCAC in a couple of years.

My first dance related experiences were in junior high school when we used
to breakdance on the Boblo Boat.  I was first introduced to techno and
house music watching 'The Scene' which was a local dance music television
show that played 110% Chicago and Detroit dope shit.  We also used to
listen to the 'Electrifying Mojo' and 'the Wizard (Jeff Mills)' on the
radio.  As I went through high school, I was heavily into Alternative,
Technopop and Industrial music.  THEN:  1n 1990 came Alan Oldham and his
show FAST FORWARD which to me, was a revolution.  For the first time, I
heard imported techno music as well as local music on a regular basis.  As
I got into the club scene, we would go listen to Blake Baxter at 'The
Majestic' and Richie Hawtin at a small bar in Windsor called 'Vertigo'.  I
got my first taste of pitch sliders and crossfaders at 96.3fm where
resident dj Claude Young showed me the concept of beatmixing.

>From there, I went on to club promotion and flyer design by working with
the VOOM crew (much respect) and other nightclubs in and around Detroit.
Soon After, I met Nancy Mitchell - the love of my life.  We went off and
threw a few parties under the production name 'Diversity'.

Here I am now in SF, where I feel like I have rediscovered myself and
music.  Although I am not really into the spiritual side of this scene, I
have learned alot about eastern philosiphy and I appreciate it more (thanks
Jody!).  I am happy to have met such great people.  Hyperreal.com is more
than just a domain name server to me :)

Thank you SFR for the continuing experience of 'the scene'.  It's inspirational.

Well here it goes...

My full name is Noah Jordan Ruiz.  I was born in San Jose on 12/22/70, and
I have lived in San Jose all my life except for 2yrs in Seattle,
Washington.  I'm Apache/Mex about 5'9'', shoulder length brown hair, brown
eyes, and 160lbs.  I signed on to SFRaves just after it started.  I don't
post much anymore, but you'll see an occasional response from me.  =)

My first rave?  Gosh, some where around 1991 and 1992.  I can't remember
the name of it though.  I must admit that I didn't enjoy my self at my
first rave.  It took the third one to really see the light.  It was in SF,
and as soon as I walked through that door I knew that it was where I
belonged.  I helped out with the Connection I
rave @ Bonny Dunes.  That was one of the best of all times.  (Thanks SFRaves)
I stopped going to raves quite some time ago, but I go out every now and
then to see what its developing into.  It's nothing like it used to be, but
it has developed into what it is now, and there will always be something
there!  =)

I've been writing music since I was 9yrs old, and I started writing
ambient/techno
etc. about 2 1/2yrs ago.  I'm not signed.  I just make music for friends
and such.  I just got a pair of 1200's and a mixer, and started mixing
records pretty easily.  I'm sure there is alot of tricks to learn.  I just
can't wait to spin at a party!!!  I love trance/ambient/house/acid all the
wonderful sounds that fill my eardrums.

I go to DeAnza college off and on for Systems Programming.  I'm not sure
thats what I want to do with my life, but I have been learning WEB pages,
and let me tell you its alot funner, and easier than writing "C" code.
Programming is fun, but you gotta like what your programming first.
Programming music is the BEST!!!  =)
And mixing vinyl is a dream come true.

I work at Cadence Design Systems as a lead in Shipping/Receiving.  Hey,
it's not at the top, but it pays the bills, and let me tell you I have
bills!!!  =)  Anybody can get ahold of me at noah@cadence.com  I have a WEB
page, but Cadence doesn't allow outside distribution.  =(

My fav things to do are:

Rock Climbing, Snowboarding, Programming Music, Mixing Records, Hanging out
with my girlfriend Heidi and her baby Ian, Rolling Phat Ones, Record
Shopping, Computers, Surfing NETSCAPE, Skimming, Hanging out with my
friends, Raving, Dancing, Experimenting, Relaxing, Did I say Mixing Records
=) =) =), and just over all living day by day, and smiling my life away.
Thats what its all about....

So if there are any people out there that like what I like drop me a line...

Take Care,

Noah Jordan (Ruiz)

p.s. Congrats to Brian and Laura!  I wish you a wonderful strong
relationship that will last for many years.  And thank you Brian for being
a big part in merging technology and the scene together.

Just found out that the generator we thought we were going to use was 
only half as powerful as what we need - 2.5kW instead of 5kW, which Ethan 
says we'll need.  Can someone volunteer to pick one up from a rental 
place in SF (probably Big 4, in the mission) and bring it down to Bonny 
Doon on Saturday and return it the next day?  I will cover all rental 
and gas costs, but this person should have a truck or car that can carry 
the generator (should be approx 2' x 3' x 4') and can get one or two 
others to help them load/unload it.  If you can do this, give me a call 
at 415-284-6888 today before 3pm, or 415-642-9734 afterwards - if you can 
do this *at*all* please volunteer!   Also, if you are not located in SF 
but can rent it somewhere outside the city (like in San Jose, for 
example), that would be fine too.  I can also be paged at 
page-brian@organic.com.  Thanks!

	I figure that in order to 'save the planet' (shyeah right ;-) I
shouldn't drive my car down to bonny doon with only one person
(myself) in it on saturday.

	So if anyone wants a ride from berkeley to the party on
saturday, mail me or call me. (I can be reached 415-933-6125 during
the day today)

	For those who don't know me, I used to be pretty active at
sfraves-type events, but for the past year or so I've been a
hermit. I've decided to start living again, so this should be fun.

	How about Red White and Blue? Private clothing-optional camping a couple 
miles south of Bonny Doon beach.  Look for the RW&B mailbox and sign nailed to 
the phone pole.  This place is sort of a bohemian camp; a lot of trailers and 
about 20 transient campsites.  It can be a bit dusty this time of year, but its 
definitely unique.  Coin-op showers.  Most people had some clothing on most of 
the time last time I was there.
	
	Or, check Big Basin State Park and Greyhound Rock County Park.  You'll 
have to hike in at Big Basin, and I'm not sure camping is allowed at Greyhound 
(but I hear it can be done).  I'm pretty sure there is no camping at Ano Nuevo.  
Farther south, theres Henry Cowell State Park above Santa Cruz, New Brighton 
County Park in Capitola, and a little private one off Golf Club Drive off 9 in 
SC itself.

	Think about making reservations.  I don't think RW&B takes them but they 
will tell you if they're full yet.

Hi Brian,

This isn't exactly rave related but, it is significant to what type of
content we put on line (no not child pornography, silly =)  )  I'll leave
it to your discretion as far as disseminating the information to the
sfravers.

If providers start giving the feds information about the contents of what
their users talk about in private chat or private email, what next?  In
this case they were allegedly trying to crack down on child pornography
but, what's to stop them from providing information about a group of people
they might percieve to be supporting the drug market?  Please be careful.
It seems that Big Brother is alive and has been on-line for quite a while
now.

>:
>: Management of America OnLine has, over a two year period, supplied the FBI

>:
>: Attorney General Janet Reno spoke in support of the actions of America OnLine
>: and FBI agents, noting, "We are not going to permit exciting new technology
>: to be misused to exploit and injure children."
>:
>: The raids were conducted throughout the day Wednesday in 57 of the 94 FBI

>: coast, however arrests and confiscation of computer equipment took place
>: all over the country in such diverse cities as Miami, New York, Dallas and
>: Trenton, NJ. Carlos Fernandez, an FBI spokesperson in Washington, DC said
>: that 'quite a few more arrests are expected in the next several days' and
>: that the Bureau would wait until those arrests had been effected before
>: discussing the case in detail.
>:
>: Pam McGraw, a spokesperson for America OnLine, based in Viennna, VA admitted
>: that the company monitored email and private conversations seeking out
>: persons who use their network to transmit pornographic material. She said
>: they always provide the FBI with the names of users suspected of involvement
>: in child pornography.
>:
>: Ms. McGraw also discussed an online 'neighborhood watch' program in effect
>: on AOL where users are encouraged to oberve each other's activities and
>: report on them to management of the online service.
>:
>: Although child pornography certainly is not allowed in public areas of AOL,
>: according to Ms. McGraw it 'usually is transmitted in email between users,
>: or in private chat rooms'. She did not indicate how AOL's interception of
>: email for the purpose of examining it for 'pornography' or their monitoring
>: of private conversations between subscribers could be reconciled with
>: various privacy laws, apparently because it can't be.
>:
>: FBI spokesperson Fernandez said the federal investigation of AOL users
>: showed that child pornographers are turning to online networks 'more and
>: more' to lure curious children. He said, "the utilization of online services
>: and bulletin board systems is rapidly becoming one of most prevalent tech-
>: niques for individuals to create and share pornogrpahic pictures of children
>: as well as to identify and recruit children into sexually illicit relation-
>: ships."
>:
>: Raids and arrests of other AOL subscribers 'suspected of being involved
>: in child pornography' will continue over the next few days until all the
>: user-suspects have been located.
>:
>: I don't know about you, but I'm going to purge all the AOL sofware from
>: my computer today. Child porn does not interest me in the least, but
>: having AOL scanning my mail and checking up on my in private conversations
>: with other users there is of great concern. It is hard for me to imagine
>: how any online service could violate the trust of their users in this way,
>: by getting into their email and personal files, regardless of the intentions.

	Well, it looks like full-fledged intro time, might as well delurk for a 
moment...  start at my start...


	I was born in Kentucky, but after 9 months I decided California
was the place to be so I dragged my folks to Sonoma (wine country), where
I stayed till I was 18.  Then I got a degree in Physics and worked in
Menlo Park for awhile, before moving to Santa Cruz in 1983.  I do
architecture and programming in systems and systems management, mostly
under UNIX.  Networking is my main interest...  I chose my first job
because it was on the Net (in 1980), and believe I've managed to make a
few contributions to the success of the Net since then.

	In my play time I like to be outdoors and around people as much
as possible.  I also read a lot (SF and classics), and have a Windows
box at home to play with things like photoshop, cakewalk (esp.  when I
get my AWE32 running), and various cdroms (delorme has a new set with
the US phone book connected to the US map, with the phone book
searchable by business type and displayable on the map).  And I listen
to music...  recent growth in my CD library has been almost exclusively
house/techno/ambient...

	Raves...  my first one was almost two years ago I guess, when
the Universe crew came through Santa Cruz.  It was a small one, but with
a great sound system, excellent visuals and interesting people...
incredibLe.  One of my ambitions is to run the first bar in space (give
me 25 years), and the timeless atmospere of a rave made me feeL like I
was there already (well, the UV lighting and Universe's costumes helped
too).

	I got on sfraves around the time the Zippies came through, in
fact I think it was to find out about the effect they were having (and
to post my own experiences).  Since then I've found it an interesting
and valuable waste of time :-)...  a window into a side of life which is
often difficult to see in the US.  That includes the music, the parties
and the people.  Thanks...

Andrew

I was an anonymous disco person who whent dancing where ever I could,
taking Acid at gay discos usually. I went to an Acid House party at DV8 in 
87-88 which sucked. I would rather listen to pre-rave experimental electronics 
when I'm not dancing.  I started working at Ameba in '93 and since then 
have started to meet other ravers. I've never left the Bay Area except briefly.
This is by far the only social group I have ever been proud to feel part of.

Hyperreal started up around July 1994.  The archives of the list can say 
exactly.

Yup, that's where it started.

Hiya! 

I've loved all of the bios; it makes me hope I have a chance to love 
each of you, too. 

whoami

My name is Jocelyn Cordell. I'm 24, 5'2" or 5'3"- I'm 
not sure, ~110lbs last I checked. I have brownish/straightish/longish 
hair and brown eyes. I often wear glasses, because I'm 
nearsighted and I like it- like being able to change 
everything into an impressionist painting just by taking 
them off, too. I was born in wartime in fiarfax county, va;
then moved to Austin, tx at age 5- where i spent my 
formative yrs listening to local bands and dating too many 
guitarists. then onto bryn mawr college, where i majored in 
english and minored in math. then i came here, where i've 
been for 3 yrs.

work

I am a dilettante in a world of specialists. I guess I prefer 
writing to most things, though. What I want to learn in the 
near future: industrial welding (I have a driving vision of making 
a real-scale Mayan temple out of old, working televisions; that, and 
obnoxious lawn sculptures), and how to use plot in writing. 
I am currently a tech-writer at HaL Computer systems, where 
I do enjoy my co-workers, but hate the actual work- which includes
ALL of the manual pages + 5 sys admin guides (UNIX). If everyone 
would print out a manpage and burn it as a vigil, it would brighten 
my day! (I forgot to take my printed sets to the BM).

raving:
i've been raving since i was 3 or 4. whenever my folks weren't around-
i'd hit the stereo and go mad all over the living room. BUT-
i went to my first rave in summer '92 at king st. a friend of mine 
was visiting- we got a fairly gritty hotel room up in the city 
for the weekend and asked the desk guy what we should do- 
thanks desk guy!  I kept coming back for many reasons, but initially
it mostly had to do with the fact that I didn't know _anyone_ 
when i first moved here. i felt safe going to raves by myself 
& it was realy fun, too- whatever i chose. My first great rave 
interaction was at Sharon's Devotion in a field somewhere near 
Stockton. I hadn't quite acclimated to the whole warm during the day,
potentially cold at night SFBA weather thing. I was ill prepared 
and I was freezing. A woman came up and hugged me, having mistaken me 
for one of her friends. I returned the hug- so she didn't know I was 
somebody else until after the hugging was done! We talked a bit 
once she recovered from the surprise. I mentioned I was cold and 
she literally gave me the shirt off of her back. We exchanged #'s 
so I could return the shirt and we've been fast friends ever since.

the list

i've been on for almost 2 yrs. i feel like the old school snuffulupagus of 
the list. i guess i'm a bit of a recluse. i'll be at bonny doon 
this saturday- earlier than later. my doggy girl ursula will be 
with me- she's a large, sweet, black doggie. she loves the people.
i will gladly share my water & oranges. she will gladly share 
sandy slobber, so be careful!

p.s. both ursula and i are fuzzy and squeezable! (and i try hard 
not to slobber even when the set is really good)

music- 
i like all kinds of stuff & i often wish that all kinds of stuff 
was really played at raves. if anybody out there is up to the 
challenge- i want to hear some flamenco guitar mixed in!
(find an old record that features los romeros)

I recall Cindy's post about requesting sfraver pictures for the hyperreal 
page but got very few responses...
Wellllll...I'm bringing my camera Saturday to a beach just overflowing 
with an sfraver population.  I want a snapshot of as many of you out 
there as I can.  Then, Cindy, if you'd like I could mail you the photos. 
Would any of you have any objections to that?  SFRaves @ Bonny Dune, 1995!

The correct name for this section of beach is Bonny Doon. It's named for the
town nearby and the road that dead ends there at hwy 1.

Sorry but the misspellings ane driving me crazy!

...so if any of you kind SF folks could give me a ride, I'd be most 
appreciative. :) I live right in downtown SF, at Fell & Pierce. Just to 
be a pain in the butt to any potential Good Samaritans, I'd like to add 
that I need room for a crate or two of records on the way to Bonny Doon 
(as I'm spinning) and that I'd like to be at Bonny Doon around noon 
(hey, cool rhyme) so that I can help set up. I'd also like to help tear 
down as well. If anybody can help me out (please please) either e-mail 
me or call me at the number in my .signature. Thank you kind people 
ever so much in advance! I look forward to meeting a lot of cool 
sfravers this weekend.

yrz,

I just returned from two weeks in Europe to find this wealth of information
about my brothers and sisters on SFRaves.  What a treat!

I'm a member of the Over 40 Posse, having been born in Washington, DC in
1950.  Grew up, went to school, and generally worked on the East Coast until
1986, when I fulfilled a lifelong dream and moved to SF with my lover, and
worked for a large law firm that shall remain nameless to protect the guilty.

In March of 92, I went to the AIDS Dance-a-thon, so that my pledges would
get their $2,000 worth of shakin my booty.  (Yes, being a lawyer at a large
law firm has some benefits!)  The dance ended too early so I went to
whatever gay venue that was then occupying Townsend St, where I met Ken (aka
Songman), who asked me if I wanted to go to a smaller party with him.  (BTW,
anyone know what became of Songman after to Waterworld bust?)  Anyway, it
was my first rave, and my introduction to many of you.  Many memorable raves
from that summer - Vision, Let Freedom Rave, one out in Tracy - the dust
from that one is still in my car door jamb, and prolly still in my lungs,
raving at the Russian River with the Ameba gang, Come Unity on Election
Night, 1992, New Year's Eve, 1992-93 (and my almost divorce for staying at
the EndUp until 4 in the afternoon without calling!)

Having caught the political bug during the 92 campaign, I moved back to DC
in January 93 to work for the Administration.  I was in the White House for
2 years, where I got to take a few ravers around (hey, Susie!) and to have
my picture taken wearing an Ameba sweatshirt while standing at the podium in
the White House Press Briefing Room.  I also got to invite the Prez to
attend a rave that took place right down the hill from Camp David - he
didn't go, but was amused by the invitation.

I'm now working for one of the many government agencies (more on this if you
ask).  And as I read your bios, I realize how much I miss all of you.  I'll
be in SF over Columbus Day weekend for a wedding, and maybe will be able to
escape for a party.  I hope to see and meet you all very soon.

Paul
(Raver in the White House)

P.S.  Love, peace and prosperity to Brian and Laura as they begin their
(legal) lives together.  May you enjoy a lifetime of happiness together!  If
you feel the molecules around you at Bonny Doon tingling, it's just me
dancin with you.

Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita

Bret Lee, 28, SWM, 5'9", 150lbs, brown hair/eyes, usually have some form of
facial hair from a full beard to a lower lip triangle thang.

Started combining chemicals and dance music at clubs, illegal parties or
anything with a DJ, in the early 80's shortly after doing the punk thing(I
tripped hard at a Better Living Through Chemistry at the On Broadway when I
suddenly truly realized just where I was/ had been 12 years ago jumpin' off
the speaker cabinets -- it was briefly like existing at two places in time at
once.)  While still in high school I bought a keyboard, drum machine and a
Commodore 64 (and it wasn't paid for by my parents or a job, hmm....)
 Electronic music and computers stuck so I tried to get a degree in CompSci.
 Summer of 88 I went to London and of course wanted to go out, little did I
know it was the "Summner of Love."  Wound up at Trip at the Astoria which was
an absolutely MASSIVE acid house fuckin' RAVE -- I'd never been to anything
that big let alone with DA vibE -- blew my brain completely and permanently.
 Came back and tried to explain it, only managing to convince people I was
nuts until I discovered that it was here too just a leetle bit more
undaground. Still driving down from Sacramento where I was going to school at
this point.  Briefly moved to L.A. in 91 where I released a couple of records
with a friend rapidly plunging into junkie-dom -- bad business move.   Moved
back to SF and got a  job at a music software company, Passport Designs,
where I still work today.  I get to travel as part of my job to music trade
shows here and in Europe.  Meeting ravers(especially netravers) in other
places has had such a deep impact on me.  Really feeling first hand the
global nature of this culture fo ours is a wonderous thing.  If you ever
travel -- get in touch with people there via the big ol' Net (or walk into a
DJ record store) you will be amazed!  I've been on sfraves since I don't know
when(I used to be loophead@cyberden.sf.ca.us)   FMR, Wicked, Basics, that one
New Year's Eve Gathering, Floppys, ComeUnity, Parties in the Park, LiquidAir,
F&F, Sunset, and a hundred more.  Jeno, Garth, Markie, Thomas, Tony, Simon,
Josh, Buck, Alfie, Galen, Ethan, Solar, Dan, Carlos, DRC, and so many more I
know I just forgot.... 
I plan on releasing some new music I've been working on soon.  
Raving is as spiritual as I get and guess what? I'm getting more spiritual
everyday :-)
Forever seeking and trying to increase the vibe, Love this city, love you
all,
phuture

okay....well, due to the overwhelming replies (thank you all) I'm leaning 
towards ... very much towards Freq8 tonight

I have been offered the possibility of a ride up there..which is good to 
hear, but then it made me realize..heck, the main reason I'm asking for a 
ride is so I don't have to go by myself...sooo..with that said, and sinc 
I know nothing yet of a definite ride for myself...if you are within 
reasonable distance of Sunnyvael, on the way to Freq8, and need a ride, 
and would like to keep me company on the drive up and back...then I can 
offer you a ride

basically, I'm just trying to keep my options open wide enough to avoid 
driving by myself..that's just me 
*flomp*

talk to ya later

I drive a really embarassing,  baby blue Datsun stationwagon hoopty (really my 
style, SHEEE YA!), but if you don't mind, I have room for 3 people.  I will be 
leaving North Oakland sometime in the afternoon, probably around 1 or 2ish.

The catch...I'm going to a party that evening in Menlo Park, spending the 
night, going to Santana on Sunday and won't be returning until Sunday night.  
But, if you *just* need a ride down, let me know.  510-450-0236.

Peace, love, friendship, dance

Okay, okay!  I know this is probably blatant misuse of sfraves (perhaps a 
little off the subject) but...since reading all the posts and realizing all the 
awesome people out there with whom I share many interests and similar 
lifestyles (therefore being rave related! =o), am I pathetically grasping?) I 
thought this would be an ideal place to post an ad. 

You see...it's the 15th of the month and I am beginning to amp out because I 
have this really cool pad I want to share with a kindred spirit, but haven't 
gotten any responses from my *3* ads!!!  This is alarming because it's a nice 
place in an awesome location and I *think* I'm a pretty great housemate. ;-)  I 
think I'm having trouble finding people who mesh with the eccentric lifestyle 
cause of the music, DJing, conga drums and party substances (very occasional) 
But other than that I'm just a quiet, demure, 9 - 5 computer geek and Satan 
Worshiper, so what the hell's the *&%$#!@ problem!?   If I don't find someone 
by the 1st, I will be solely responsible for rent (which basically means 
eviction due to the fact I cannot pay)  Ugh!  I feel sick :-(  

Okay, the specs:

Location: Killer area on Webster off 51st in North Oakland, across from 
Rockridge, conveniently close to College, Piedmont and Telegraph   Aves, Bart, 
AC Transit, great shops, awesome dining, quick drive to parks, anywhere in 
Berkeley, etc.  Easy access to the 80, 880,   580,  and 24 freeways (15-20 
min's to anywhere you'd *want* to be)

Place:  2 bedroom (good closets)1 bath upper flat in duplex.  

Features: Lots of sunlight and air, whole front of flat is over garage so we 
can play music plenty :-), modern, gas kitchen, dishwasher,    balcony, *free* 
cable w/HBO & Showtime (BFD!), almost empty 2 car garage (actually thinkin' 
bout throwin' a block rave party   out of  the garage), washer, storage, off 
street parking.  Pets negot. w/ landlord (I don't have any).  *Water & garbage 
included in   rent*.

Area:  Safer than most.  Great neighbors, nice looking houses, trees, etc.

Rent:   $422.50 each. (Guuuulp!) a little pricey, but it's worth it just for 
the location and the fact I have cool neighbors and landlord who   don't give a 
shit if I party and make small sacrificial killings (that's worth quite a bit 
to me!) =oP

Pleeeeeease respond if you or anybody you know might be interested.  I'm 
lookin' for open-minded, open-hearted folk who take their shit seriously, but, 
welllll...ya know!!!  Independence, respect, generosity, friendship, peace, 
rave!  =o>

My number at home: 510-450-0236, at work 510-922-5978

Peace and love to all.

Rikki

I'm so gald that my introductory post helped touch off the bio-fever
currently sweeping SFR, but I realized that my post didn't really
constitute a full bio.

Soooo, here it is =)

I was born 30 years ago in The Rotten Apple (NYC). Went to high school in
the East Village during the height of the punk era (practically spitting
distance from CBGB). Got into clubbing with friends (being carded was
unheard of back then) but could never quite get with the VIP/guest list
vibe that so permeated the scene at the time. Turned instead to hiphop &
reggae and many, many big fat blunts. Went to some very early hiphop
"house" parties and caught my first glimpse of the possibilities of two
turntables and a mixer.

By the time I turned 17 I was thoroughly fed up with NY and the urban vibe.
I managed to get into a small college in Santa Fe, NM. I only lasted for a
semester and then moved on to Dr. Hoffman's class ;-) I think I managed to
give Terrence McKenna a run for his money terms of frequency and dosage
during that period. These were very profound times for me, but were rather
solitary in a way. I broke my neck in a freak accident during that time
(still hurts :-(  ) and managed to work myself into a pretty severe
depression about the state of the world. I bemoaned the loss of tribal
identity, humanity's flight from nature, and things like that.

As a way to save my sanity, I turned to music and began learning to drum.
This eventually led me to a school called The Naropa Institute in Boulder,
CO, where I got two degrees, one in World Music and one in Buddhist
Studies. This was an amazing place and an experience I will treasure for
many lives to come. I took Buddhist vows at that time and have been a
practitioner ever since. Buddhism has taught me to look into my own state
of mind for the source of happiness and not to blame external circumstances
for my problems. It has also taught me the importance of continually being
in the present moment - right NOW!!!

I bought my first computer, a Mac Plus, while I was a student at Naropa and
began doing a bit of DTP work for some extra bucks (it beat delivering
pizza for Dominoe's, which was my job at the time). Actually, that's not
true, my first computer was a Radio Shack TRS-80 my parents bought me when
I was 12. I had fun with it, but then decided that guys who were into
computers never got anywhere with girls  ;-)

After 4 years at Naropa, I felt it was time to move on. I wanted to move
somewhere bigger and more diverse than Boulder, but knew I didn't want to
go back to NY. San Francisco seemed like a good bet, so my girlfriend and I
packed our bags and headed here on 1/1/90. My girlfriend (later my wife -
later my ex-wife) didn't really want to come, but did anyway to be with me.
If any of you non SFers is considering moving, don't make this same
mistake.

I thought I was going to pursue music as a career once I got here, but I
needed bucks right away and got a job at a computer company and, well, one
thing led to another...

In 1991 I started a company called Colorscape Communications with some
friends in what would later come to be known as Multimedia Gulch (it was
just cheap rent at the time). We did lots of graphics (mostly Photoshop,
Illustrator, and Quark) for the advertising industry, and later got into
CD-ROM develpment (I produced a couple of corporate CDs in Director).

In '92 I hired a kid named Ammon Haggerty who had grown up in Marin and had
just moved back to SF after a copule of years as a snowboard bum in Tahoe
and Oregon. It was Ammon that introduced me to the rave scene (events
described in my previous post) and to another great love, snowboarding.

In July '93 I started Mushroom Jazz/Jazid up with Patty Ryan and Erik Ross,
but I was only officially involved with that party for the first six
months. Around that same time I met my girlfiend Veronika (who I currently
live with and adore with all my heart ;) ).

After Colorscape dissolved at the beginning of '94, I got a job with a
Denver-based Mac software company called Lumin. I had to move to Denver for
a year (I didn't want to leave SF, but the gig was to good to pass up). My
official title is Director of Marketing, but I really wear many hats since
it is a small company. We are currently developing a multi-player game for
the net that we hope to release by end of year. I'm currently working on
our Web site.

Luckily, I now have the best of both worlds. I still have the job, but I
work out of my home in SF. Lumin set me up with an amazing computer studio
that people say reminds them of the bridge on the Enterprise ;) The view
from my 11th floor window looks out over the Gulch and the Bay Bridge. I'm
definately a lucky, lucky guy...

As far as musical tastes go, mine are quite broad. I'm into acid jazz, deep
house, acid house, ambient, trip hop, some jungle, world music, classical
music and just about anything with a quality of genuineness to it.

I hope I haven't been too long winded here, but I am enjoying everyone
else's posts so much and usually find them too short. You're all such
fascinating people.

I hope to see many of you at Bonny Doon tomorrow!

Much, much love,
ek

Well, it looks like I'm going to make it to Frequency8 tonight (yippee! I 
haven't been out in weeks:)  I'll bring a handful of tapes (which I 
posted about earlier- called "PLATE TECHTONICS") to give out to 
interested persons.

I'm about 5'9', very short hair (was shaved about a month ago), no facial 
hair, and lots of big steel earrings.  I'll probably be wearing black 
pants and a red/orange woven jacket, but don't hold me to that- look for 
the earrings :) 

Hope to see you there!
Seth

     Thought I'd write a quick bio since it looks my son and I will make it 
     out to Brian and Laura's pre-wedding bash.  Looking forward to seeing 
     y'all tomorrow!
     
     STATS:
     5' 0", 110 lbs. (Fit but not thin!), Black Hair below the shoulders, 
     Dark Brown Eyes, Dark Complexion (Filipino & East Indian descent), 34 
     yrs old, divorced, one nine-year-old son...hmmm, anything else left 
     out, just ask!
     
     I'm into and trained in some of the following types of dance:  jazz, 
     tap, modern, ballroom, African, contact improvisation,  folk/ethnic, 
     Latin, authentic movement, etc. and have formed and belong to a few 
     Bay Area dance collectives.  I'm not trained in any particular body 
     therapy but have incorporated some Trager(tm) and Alexander(tm) 
     techniques into dance classes I've taught.  Among the many projects 
     I'm working is one where I'm exploring how to bring that schwa feeling 
     naturally through yoga, body centeredness, group mind, theatre and 
     movement improvisation, music, and dance.  This is in collaboration 
     with a couple of fellow ravers.
     
     I enjoy all types of music but have a jazz and funk influence.  I play 
     guitar and have had classical and jazz voice lessons but recently have 
     been goofing around w/keyboards, congas, synthesizers, and other small 
     hand percussion instruments at some all night jams.
     
     I started trancing when I was about 12 during an interpretive dance 
     class at a Catholic school.  Without knowing what I was doing, I 
     became hooked into dance as a release and a form of expression.
     
     Spiritually, I've explored lots of beliefs and have developed a few 
     gifts that I occassionally share at raves.  These interpretive, 
     calming qualities along with my mothering energies allow me to meet 
     quite a few wonderful people in the rave/party circuit.  I've got a 
     longer bio but I think this'll do for now.
     
     See ya soon!
     
     Diane

Dear Reader,

I'm Eric Hill. I was born in Oakland on March 2nd (Lou Reed and Dr. Seuss),
1968. I have lived in the Bay Area my entire life and I am moving to San
Francisco in three weeks to engage the opportunities of  a major
metropolitan city. Right now I live in downtown San Jose as I have for the
last six years, doing PC tech support, HTML and graphic design/cgi to pay
the bills.

I was introduced to House music through my former housemate Nick Philip who
turned me on to a free show at the I beam in the summer of 1990 featuring
the Inspiral Carpets, a scallie band we both liked. Performing techno-house
artist Adamski opened for them and that sort of opened the gateway for my
affinity towards this style of music. We started going out regularly up to
San Francisco to events like Vivid, the Firehouse, Wiggle It, Wicked, the
Candlestick FMRs, 650 Howard, Big Heart City, One Step Beyond '92, Zanzibar.
These  are the seminal clubs in my raving experiences and New Year's eve
1991/92 at Toon Town was the definitive Rave (Jeno playing Billie Jean? come
on...).

Playing true to a raver stereotype in full effect, one August Monday in 1992
I woke up to guns and orders in my sleepy face. I was getting busted.
Flogging wafers and lotus sheets in a suburban neighborhood can have that
effect. This event and it's consequences completely changed the way I looked
at the rave scene, the legal system, drugs and drugs-based
(counter)cultures, reality, society, life, and most of all, how I perceive them.

I DJ techno and avant-chill music. Over the past year or so I've noticed
that most DJs that I see are much better at getting gigs than being
musicians. I think it is the DJs job to go out, wade through and find the
newest and raddest music out there and bring it to the people in the clubs.
If the crowd doesn't want to dance to it, that's their option - at least
they were given the chance to get into something new. I don't get into the
crowd control aspects of DJing that seem to me like a top/bottom power game.
I love my records and I love music, but I'm not a magician. I know this
ain't the dominant perspective.

I am currently learning about synthesizers and playing drum machine so I can
start putting out records. I played drums for 10 years before I got into
raving and I have a lot of ideas about rhythm that have been sitting in my
head for a long time. These will be the records I'm always shopping for, but
never come out. This music will render the 4/4 beat obsolete to all but the
most sentimental of dancers and music fans.

I am ~6' tall, 155lbs with glasses and blond hair. Sometimes I wear a
Madonna shirt, but lately I've been wearing my blue Jack Purcells and a cap
that says "PROJECT STARBURST."

Here goes

Willis Wong 

5' 11" bowl cut blond hair, glasses, 125lbs +/-
5lbs, depending on pasta intake.  

My first rave was the spring of '92 in Orange County called "Alice's 
adventures in Wonderland". It was like a whole new world.. being with 
several hundred people all being nice to each other.  Not to mention the 
whistles and glowing things - it was something else.  I found out about 
it from Dana Watanabe's postings to alt.rave. Thanks Dana!

I'm not much of a social being... mainly just dance until my feet reach 
China when that groove kicks into high gear.  SFRaves is a swell place to 
be.  I've only been on for a year or so but it's been stellar reading 
what everyone does and says and feels.

I sometimes wear a shirt that says "walrus" but people usually mistake me 
for a Beatles fan. Oh well.

at 7 am on the morning of June 1, 1993, me and M and P-ter were shuffling
through the mist out to the parking lot of the Sonoma County Fairgrounds
at the end of Get Down Get Down Get Down Get Wicked.  I'm sure I had this
dazed look on my face, because even after a year of seriously going out
to raves and other events I'd had my mind pretty well blown in the old
armory building with the nice neon sign above the entrance naming it as
the Grace Pavilion.  This was the night that I actually left the smaller
building where Doc Martin was just rockin' the joint with the biggest
phattest vibe factor I've ever seen on the dance floor (and doing it with
just one speaker stack as I believe Markie had blown the other one when
*he* went over the top in his set!), to go back into the Grace Pavilion.
I don't know for sure who the DJs were in there but I believe in retrospect
it was Buck and Barry Weaver.  Well, there was the biggest wall-o-sound
I've *ever* seen at an SF party, a huge set of screens hanging from the
ceiling in this old armory with really great projections, gigantic fog
machines and a wonderful Windows-controlled laser projection system that
I'll always remember as the very first Windows program I ever saw that
didn't have *any* icons.  There were maybe 150 people in this huge hall
with this huge sound and light show just exploding around me, and I danced
and sat right in the middle of the whole experience like the universe
swirling around me and got THAT kind of feeling that never happened even
at the very best Dead shows I've been too . . .

. . . and after it was over, we walked out in the morning misty rain and
P-ter said, mostly joking, "Well, did it change your life?"

And I looked at him and M and kind of grinned and said,

"Uh, YEAH!"


phred




When I asked him about it recently, Barry Weaver said he didn't really
remember all of this except that it was a really crazy party :)

All I can say is that the all of the Bios have been great to read!  Now we
are getting somewhere =o)  I feel like the SFRavers have been pulling
together lately more than they ever have and that is what it is all about...
well at least I think so ; )

Well my real name is Rob Johnson, I'm 6'2'', 170lbs, very long light brown
hair, brown eyes and I wear size 12 shoes =p
I was born in Berkeley but started moving around the country when I was 4.  I
lived in 9 different states and Saudi Arabia before coming back to the Bay
Area when I was 19 (I'm 24 now.)  I love to travel and hope to eventually
live bi-coastaly (new word :) 

My interests are nothing too unusual for this list...  I love music,
computers and people (most of the time.)  I started out young doin the "rock"
thing and it only took me 8 years to figure out there was more to life
musically...  in fact I found out there was EVERYTHING better to be found in
music...  I think I have come to a point in my life musically where I truly
can fall in love with all music and I am happy with that.  

I played guitar for 12 years (classical to heavy metal) and I am still
playing every now and then.  About 6-7 years ago I started doing electronic
music and have thrown myself into it completely.  If it is electronic I do
it.  I have a really deep love for analog synths and always try to keep 10 or
so on hand in case I need a fix.  I also love the world of digital sound.  I
am currently learning to use the Kyma system.  It is a real time DSP synth
that will pretty much do anything you tell it too.  It uses up to 8 DSPs in
parallel and it ROCKS!  All I can say is that the real time voice morphing
left me on the floor so I will be sure to try n get some more music with the
Kyma on the dance floor soon!  (so far it has seen most of it's action just
in Universities)

I also do some DJing when I have the time.  Most of my time is spent in my
studio either on the computer or writing music...  one of these days I'm
gonna do some more home work cause I also go to San Jose State U where I am
an Electro Acoustic Music Major.

My first experience with house music was in 88 while I was on the East Coast.
 I was in NY with my best friend and we hit up a few clubs.  Well I had never
danced nor been to a club before but I caught on pretty quick =o)  The whole
thing totally rocked my little rocker world ideas on music.  There was NO
band and NO stage...  this was more about _everyone_ in the crowd...  and I
loved it!  When I came back to CA I could not find that music any where...
 (just goes to show you how some times our social groups can hide us from the
rest of the world)  ...until I went to Floppy's (I think it was 91.)  Well it
was all over from there...  non stop raving for at least 2 years...  those
were to date some of the best years of my life.  I guess I have been a Raver
in waiting for the last year or so.  The scene for me has been kinda
disappointing so I have not been going out too much.  I figure the best thing
I can do to help the scene right now is to really work on my music and try to
take it to another level... to do this I need the time and money that going
out consumes so quickly.  I'm really glad that the scene is continuing to get
stronger in many ways...  I guess I'm gonna have to be going out more but to
do that Ill have to stop writing this really long story =o)

Much love to ya all,

Hi - Larry Ching here ... I gotta request :

 Does anyone out there have a gas can? I will be bringing the generator
from Sunnyvale , where I live. It will come fully gassed from the 
rental company , and they say it should be good for 8 hours. I would
like to have a back-up can of unleaded gas in case the rental company
didn't fill the tank up all the way , or it doesn't really last 8 hours.

 Can someone volunteer to bring a gallon or more of unleaded gas? If you
can , please call me at (408) 746-2083 , after 8AM and before 10:30AM.
Leave a message if we're not home - Mary and I will be getting stuff
together for the Bonny Dho'in (sic) party , and we may be at the grocery
or storage area.

 Larry Ching / larryc@netcom.com

Saturday morning. If we're not home , leave a message with your name

 You should have a truck or similar vehicle that can haul an approx 2' x
3' x 4' heavy metal generator.
 
 I'm feeling a lot better, but it would be nice to have back-up in case
I get sick again.
 
 Goodnight until 8AM -

Hello SFRavers -

 It's 8:03AM , and I feel much better. The dinner I ate at 3:00AM is
being processed without protest by my digestive system. 

 I would still appreciate ant offers "just in case". I am scheduled to
pick up the generator between 11AM and noon , so call me before 10:30AM
if you're interested in being backup on this.

 PS - Mary and I will try to be at Bonny Doon by 12:15PM. The generator
will probably be a heavy sucka' , so volunteers for hauling it before
and after the party would be appreciated.

Ok,  Ok!!   I guess it's MY TURN...  I suppose I could just do a cop out
and ask everyone to read Hackers by Steve Levy and look inder the index
under John Draper,   but I won't do that...

As most of you all know my now,   my claim to fame was my discovery that
Cap'n Crunch Whistle could send a "Disconnect" signal at trunk level...

Then,  using a blue box tone generating device,  I would be able to dial
any number that operators could,   including internal trunk codes.   Thus
giving me "root" access to the phone company.   I had to serve time in
prison for my deeds,  and had phone hacking school in prison,  where I
went out of my way to teach every criminal I came in contact with on how
to do this.

Lately,  in 1992,   I went to the Toon Town and Cyber Spider raves
(pretty much old school).    I never danced though...   It wasn't until
I started doing my famious wackey exercies that I got strong enough to
dance without excructiating pain,  and dealing with everyone poking fun
at my strange exercises.   Anyways,  I met Geoff White (Raver Jeff) at
a Cypherpunks meeting who seemed to be really well connected with the
scene.   Then,   I learned of the SFRaves mailing list and promptly
joined.    At first,   I would lurk,  like anyone else.    Then I went
to Beltane in may and got my first taste of dancing,   after a long
talk with my personal trainer,   I learned very quickly what my body could
and could not do.   At first,  I would just "shuffle" with the beat,
then pretty soon,   my body just sort of "took over" and my dance style
started having more variaty.

I dropped Kandy flipped at Let Freedom rave on 4th on July (Remember the
hill fire?).   From then on,   my head just started saying over and over
"I have truly found paradise"!!   No other social event ever comes close
to providing me with Friendship,  brotherhood and love,  as well as getting
an awsome amount of exercise.   As I started going to more and more of these,
I started evolving into a much higher physical state...   Now,   as most
can testify,   I have limitless energy.   So,  thanx to those funny looking
exercises,  combined with dancing,   I've found utopia.   Thanx everyone
for accepting me in this awsome community.   I am honored to be a part
of it.

My web page is coming soon,  got some amazing stories I'm telling....

Cheers
Crunchman

Alright, enough of that energy shit.   ;)

First, I'd like to thank everyone for such a wonderful day at the beach.
Beautiful views, wonderful music, but most of all, incredible people! I'm
continually reminded that though the music is what brings us all together,
it is us that creates the environment in which to enjoy that music. We all
add a little something to the overall atmosphere at a party, and it is that
which keeps me coming back.

Though I didn't connect with many of you Saturday, I still felt an
underlying unity with you all. Sort of a reassurance that we are all pretty
much like minded people, trying to live within a social framework who's
world might not be to our liking. Strenth in numbers, eh?

So hats off to you all. Even if you didn't make it, I feel you were still
there in spirit.

about me:

Just turned 28 last week. 5'10", sandy blond hair, usually pulled into a
pony tail, unless, of course, I'm dancing.  ;)

Local boy. Grew up in Walnut Creek, which was cool until I started to think,
then it got scary. Moved with my folks to Oregon, then Idaho, then finally
back to Walnut Creek (which is much better than Boise, Idaho - trust me). 

At 19, I did something really crazy, and joined the Army. Long story, but
let's just say I was really confused about a lot of things, and needed a
structured environment to get my shit together. Kinda extreme, I know, but I
guess it was needed.  Ended up going to the Gulf for that crazy political
tap dance that many people bought into. Found out some things about our
government that I wish I didn't know. As Goebbles (Hitler's propaganda
minister) once said, "A lie told often enough becomes the truth." Scary.

So now I'm home (1991), and a year later I hear about these things called
"Raves".  My first is Pajamarama, at the Concourse. Interesting, but not my
thing (I was sober for the event). A  month later I go to the Live 105
listener appreciation party, and find they have a "Rave Room". Bump into a
guy with a thick cockney accent who's got something for me to try.  ;)

Started dancing, and came in touch with an energy I never knew existed.
Damn, so this is what this is all about! My next party was Community, and
I've been hooked ever since.

Joined the list in January of this year. Lurked for a while, then felt
comfortable enough to post. 

I've grown by leaps and bounds through my experiences, but it's only because
I've wanted to. I find many people come into our community looking for
something, and when it isn't found, they get dissapointed and split. That's
too bad, but I don't think we're in a position to be blatantly spouting
values to anyone. It seems that if we, as a species, are ever going to
change our destructive behavior, we have to come to similar understandings
on many levels. Since these understandings have to come at one's own pace,
it might take a while, but I'm confident things'll work out. 

I'm pretty serious about my spirituality, which might be why I'm a withdrawn
sometimes. In order to have the experience I like, I need to be in my own
"space". 

Blah blah....

Thank you all for being who you are. You've made my world a better place.

later...

Jonas

Before I go into the event itself I'd like to say I saw one of the  most
beutiful sights between two people:

It was during Mars set when the event was winding down, everyone was by the
fire or faling asleep on their blankets, sleeping bags ect... and I was
sitting up on a rock viewing my lovely community when I caught sight of Mars
and his significant other.  Both were on the vibe of whatever song was
playing at the time and both were on the same wavelength.  It so intimate, so
private.  About a hundred of us on a beach, but thoses two were on their own
planet.  That was beuaty.

The event in itself was very nice: tiki torches, more lighting than usual.
 The music was not as upbeat than thier previous sets.  But the spirits of us
people were at an all time high..  I actually spent less time by the speaker
and took time to meet some of you (ie. purple tiger, vince, and some others
whom I cant, for the life of me, remember...)

Two high points were the suprise birthday cake for one of the F8 crew members
(got milk Jim?) and the seals who came by to appreciate the music (I guess
seals like techno too)...

Funny how no one wanted to burn the broken pallet till we realised it was for
burning and not abstract art...
 
Overall:

Vibe:  8Smiles (maybe the cold weater)
Friendship Factor:  9Smiles (hug patrol in full effect)
Danceability: 8Smiles (I see the cardboard more and more often)
Cleanup: 10Smiles (I came back 2 the place after all was gone and it still
looked pristine).

Overall: 8.5

Thanks for the SFR badge Vince and thanks for the Medical response to
everybody (brian et al.) for my Boo-boo....

See Ya at the Mari-na,
Adam

P.s. I really enjoied Bonnie doone as well.  But I tend to think that it was
like Sunset: any review would be an injustice.  Thoese kind of gatherings
need to be experienced to be understood.

    Well Tim, Sunset is in Berkeley Marina and if your not there by now, 
then you are probaly miising a good party; being that I am to 
burnt to move. I'll just stay right here and enjoy a viewing of "Pulp 
Fiction".
   Ah, I do have to say that Bonney Dunes was *lovely*. I arrived, 
expecting it to be a little bit larger, but soon grew quick to love the 
size and privacy of the whole thing. I saw many of you S.F ravers there 
and wish that I could of meet a few of the newbies like Rikki:(. I 
brought a friend- Heleena, form DVC- with me. This was her first little 
party, and she left with a case of the big warm fuzzies;). Needless to 
say; I will be dragging her out again in the *near* future. Monica, Tom 
and Alex; I hope you all got home safe and sound. Monica- I enjoyed 
talking to you on our way down; I hope your back feels better:).
   The DJs were *fantastic*. I immediatley recognized the track tha Joe 
Rice had played from 'Probe Mission U.S.A.' and went nuts:):). I 
*thouroghly* enjoyed Ethan's set. It was amazing; it was like I trusted 
him with his spinning. i was hovvering(SP?) over him, totally cheering 
him on as he would slow down or speed up his pace and start another song 
in just *perfectly*. Thank ya guy for giving me the fuzzies with your set 
and showing us your awesome energy behind the turntables.
   Well i gots to go and watch my movie. I hope everyone had a grand 
weekend and see ya soon.

To: SFRAVES@HYPERREAL.COM

	Briefly,

	Well, this was a full weekend for me - Friday night was spent
	at a disappointing Stereophonic down at Mission Rock. The music
	was, IMHO, rather scattered, never building up into a consistent
	groove. Then the music gets turned off around 4ish, earlier than
	expected. Not a great party.

	Saturday, I headed down to Bonny Doon. The Calafornia coastline
	in general is a spectacular stretch of land, Boony Doon is 	
particulary beautiful (my first time there). There was an 
	energy at the event, despite the small(ish) numbers, which was
	wonderful to experience. Unfortunately, sleep deprivation, a
	general lack of energy and, later, a foolish descsion to get 
	all physcadelic, kept me in a slightly spacey state.

	Still, thanks to all the people I talked to, met for the first
	time and the DJ's, all of whom played a great set of tunes.
	
	Lastly, the apology - on the way off the beach, at the fairly 
	steep descent down to the road, I ran into a few problems. 
	Insufficient footwear, no light, and the influence of a certain
	substance, all contributed to the problems I had getting my
	load down the rocky path. After almost falling a couple 
	times, I had to leave the polystyrene cooler I was carrying 
	at the top, then slowly go down the path.
	
	I wanted to get someone to come back up and help me down with
	it - but, my ride was ready to go - so it got left. I'm so
	sorry about this. Normally, I make sure and take all the crap
	I've generated away with me, having left garbage there makes
	me feel really bad.
	
	All for now,
	Gary

hmm...let's see...born 9/17/70 in brooklyn, grew up in nj...went to 
rutgers college (with a brief time in england where i started raving :) 
), degrees in women's studies and history... did a lot of 
radical/political organizing there, too (pro-choice, anti-sexism, 
anti-intervention stuff, mainly)

discovered raving in 1992 in england, tho i guess technically i made my 
own rave sometime in '89 (?) by bringing a boom box with early acid house 
to a little park :) 

moved to sf in the summer of '93, ,met tomcat at a Your Sisters' House, 
and then started working with YSH til the end...now work with f&f 
frequently, tho a back injury has prevented me from doing as much as i 
want or going out that much...

i also do a lot of anti-police brutality organizing now (helped start 
ACtion for Police Accountability, email me for more info), ever since the 
SFPD raided my friend's Visual AID benefitNew Years Ball...

i like kitties.   i'm a pagan.  and an anarchist.  and pansexual.  
love acid hose, acid trance, pwog, richie hawtin...ambient, too , but 
that's such a broad category... favorite djs:  alex (ex-gaia mantra), joe 
rice, junior vasquez...and tomcat :)

from the 9/14/95 Examiner:

22 COPS ON THE CARPET AFTER RAID ON AIDS PARTY

Six could be fired for excessive force, other violations at fund-raiser

Six Sf police officers face possible suspension or firing by the Police 
Commission for allegedly using excessive force and violating other 
regulations in a New Years Day raid on an AIDS fundraiser, Chief Tony 
Ribera says.

Another 16 officers face lesser disciplinary action for alleged 
misconduct in the riad on the Harrison Street party early Jan 1, Ribera 
said Wednesday.

The six facing more serious charges include a captain and a lieutenant, 
Ribera said.  He would not identify them.  <Yalon and Haggett?>

"The commission will either sustain all, part or none of the complaints 
against them, " Ribera siad.  "Assuming that a charge is sustained by the 
commission, then discipline will be given for that charge after looking 
at how serious it is and what the officer's disciplinary background is."

Ribera told the commission Wed. that despite the alleged violations, the 
raid itself had been legal (lie!) and had not been targeted specifically 
at gays and lesbians.

"The initial enforcement action against the nightclub <lie!@ it was not a 
nightclub - it' was my frien'd home/warehouse and was a private party!> 
had no indications of bias or homophobia," Ribewra said.  "This took 
quite a bit of time planning and there were a lot of people involved."

The Office of Citizens Complaints last month sustained 52 allegations of 
wrongdoing agains 22 officers who took part in the riad on a warehouse at 
938 Harrison St., where a packed benefit was under way for the AIDS 
charity group ?Visual AID.

The charges sustained by the independent watchdog agency, which has bno 
power of enforcemtnt, included excessive police force, false arrests, 
police uses of anti-gay slurs, illegal searches and lying on police 
reports.  Eleven people were arrested during the raid, which involved 
nearly 100 officers.

Ribera would not comment on the specific allegations against the 
officers, some of whom had multiple hcarges sustained against them.  
Buthe said the allegations included excessive force, illegal searches, 
inapropriate languageand being evasive during investigations.

Police, in concert with agents from the state Alcoholic Beverage Control 
agency, raided the club to enforce safety violations, including unsafe 
wiring and poorly lit fire exits <which were actually ok!> In addition, 
police say, alcohol was being served without a permit. <LIE LIE LIE!!>

Ribera said the OCC had determined that the fund-raiser organizers had 
been selling alcohol illegally.  <another lie!>

Twelve officers will be disciplined at a chief's hearing, with possible 
punishment ranging from a reprimant to 10 days' suspensiom Ribera said.

The remaining four officers, Ribera said, face relatively minor charges 
and will most likely be admonished or informally disciplined because they 
have good disciplinary backgrounds.

"They had many altertions during the course of the evening <that they 
caused!>, Ribera said.  "it was a high stress period and I think that has 
to be considered."

end.

well, crappy article - he didn't even interview T (main organizer) or his 
lawyer or anyone from the OCC!!!  lots of inaccuracies, too.  but let's 
hope some piggies get at least more than a slap on the wrist.

look for ademonstration at a Police Commission hearing coming up soon.

I was there (unfortunately). The music sucked and it was cold. The only good
thing about the night was the company I enjoyed with the two Xing girls I
brought back to my house ;).

There's a mail-order place called Pure Acid that lists it as follows:

"_The California Project_: 8 DJs, 16 tapes for a total of 24 hours of
music.  The best of Hardcore Acid, Progressive, Funky, Tribal, Trance, and
ambient.  Two mixed tapes each from Ron D Core, Thee-O, Simply Jeff, DJ
Dan, Jon Bishop, DJ Trance, DRC, and Vitamin D.  $120  VERY LIMITED"

I can't guarantee the integrity of the place, but I did order a couple
tapes and I was very satisfied so it seems kewl =)

If you e-mail your snail mail address to them at cubofdoom@aol.com and ask
for a catalog they'll send one.  I haven't heard any of The CP, but it
sounds like a pretty groovy collection.  Hope this helps some - Good luck!
Peace and Love

Eh, a very good weekend on my end of the rope.  F8 was fun, fuzzy, and 
mellow, in the kyoolest location I've ever seen.  Sunset was, as 
usual, supervibey and great fun.  Sorry I didn't make it to Bonny Doon, tho.
Too tired.

Respect and greetings go out to Purple Tiger, a great guy who I met at 
F8, and Amy Starkey, a great grrrrl who I met at Sunset (thanks for noticing 
my sfraves badge!).

SFravers are certainly great conversationalists; talking to these two was 
loads more fun than dancing to a great set!

As reported, the Bonny Doon gathering was intimate and beautiful.
I usually don't socialize much when the music is *that* good,
but I had a wonderful time meeting quite a few sfravers face to
face for the first or maybe the 2nd time.  Hello to all of you
whose names I've forgotten, as well as Sho, Ozmandias (sorry if
I butchered that), Will-E, Phil, Tim, and especially Jocelyn. 

I found the couple simulating sex in the dance area to be a minor
annoyance.  That kind of self-absorbed focus tends to draw energy
away from the group vibe.  Oh well, after a while it just became part 
of the scenery.

Sunset had to take a back seat to the wedding on Sunday.  It was
kinda fun seeing ravers in formal dress.  The event had a couple of
minor rave influences: Bryce provided some ambient tunes, and we showered
the departing couple with bubbles instead of throwing rice.  Being
there with a bunch of net-friends drove home just how *real* our virtual
community can be.  As more people are brought together through this
medium, the world surely becomes a better place.

Bio: Rave Style

grew up in Hartford CT, went to school American University in washington dc
for two years.  my freshman year i started going to parties a little 
underground in a parking garage and then Catastrophic Masquerave in Oct. 92
  but the first party i had the slamming time was Ultraworld 2: the Milkyrave
which introduced me.  went insane going to parties getting busted handing
out candy, blowing whistles, dancing on  a ski resort and 2nd/Bowery in New
York City on New Years.  helped start dcraves and throw a few parties on
campus along with some renegades called Mobile Grooves Possee.  
  eventually i got burned out on parties and didnt go as much. i visited
San Francisco a few times and liked the scene here and didnt like the school
i was going to so moved out to San Francisco last year and san fran scene
has become my home.  you guys are jus so friendly ;)

Bio: Personal

1991.  changed my life came back went to school in DC loved it and meet cool
people but then moved put to SF and SF State to go to school.

so after school who knows where ill end up.

As always, there's never enough time to do everything you want to...

Friday night was the little party on the wharf.  Not great, not bad,
just okay.  It was good to hear my old friend Darcy again, as well as
meeting John Williams for the first time.  It was also nice to hear
Seawolf while in SF, but luckily, it was just a taste of things to come...

Saturday at Bonny Doon was great.  When I got there and started walking
down that sandy hill, what did I hear but some good Techno Bass, courtesy
of Ozy playing an Aux-88 track.  That set the tone for the day!  It was
weird hearing the music that was being played in that setting.  Weird for
me, at least, as we tend not to have too many parties on the beach back
in Detroit, and I tend not to hear much techno while on the West Coast.
I am really glad things are going the way they are!

The obligitory name dropping of new SF-Ravers I met:  Geoff White,
Jon Drukman, Ozy, Jonathon Wells, Chris Hilker, WillE (well, netraver
if not SFRaver ;)  And of course, best wishes and all that to Brian
& Laura!

Also, if things pan out, you might be seeing a lot more of me in the
future.  To that end, Niels Meyer, I don't have your email address handy.

        I know you guys might be getting bored of bios, but I probably
should post one to let you know that I'm here.

        I was born in 9/8/77(right, I turned 18 a few weeks ago)... I have
been going to raves for about 2 years, but I've only gone to a few major
ones. I am really into the scene, though. 

        Most of the major ones I've gone to were Bonny Dunes and Santa Cruz
stuff. I just started my freshman year here at UC Berkeley and I want to get
into the SF rave scene since it is alot bigger than Santa Cruz's. I'm not
sure to how illegal I can talk over this email so I'll kick back and see
what you guys do.

        But I really am into raves and have a lot of friends into it from
Santa Cruz and here at Berkeley. I hope you don't mind that I'm probably
younger than most of you.

        I am really, REALLY into music. I can play guitar, bass, trombone,
trumpet, tuba, and baritone horn. Music is my life. I am into all styles. I
will probably major in music. My main instrument is guitar. I am also into
quirky old synth stuff, and quirky old guitar effects which I collect. So if
any of you are into music, or need a guitar or bass player of any instrument
for something, just talk to me. 

        -Chris (lsavage@uclink4.berkeley.edu)

Hey people,

I'm thinking about coming down from Portland to take in some of your 
lovely city next weekend and I would love some tips.  In case you didn't 
read my bio, I'm a 28-year old female into acid jazz, soul music, the 
Dead, Deep Forest, house, ect....I'm not so much into big parties right 
now but rather smaller get-togethers, outdoors, (your beach parties sound 
wonderful).  I like seeing good blues and jazz and sipping cocktails and 
good conversation.  My main subjects of interest are metaphysics and 
spirituality, music and good food :-)
Are there any comfy clubs that play like acid jazz, ambient and  are 
there any events happening this weekend that are sure to please but not 
throught the roof?  I'm looking forward to meeting many of you and there 
will be more on this as I receive info...thanks in advance!

Love and kind thoughts,

Subject:My Bio!

Wow!  After a weeks vacation I come back to over 500 messages, A good portion
of them are bio's.  I havnt even scratched the surface reading them.  

Here's my Spec Sheet:

Im 24. Born in Paso Robles, CA on Nov 21,1970.  Moved to and grew up in San
Jose when I was around 2.  I now live in Santa Cruz and work in Scotts Valley
at E-mu Systems.  E-mu Systems is maker and manufaturer of Sampling
keyboards/modules and synthisizers and digital recorders and multi-media
stuff.  I'm in Tech Support which means I tell people how to use our stuff all
day long.  I also monitor Internet and E-mail questions.

I have short brown hair, glasses, 3 holes in my left ear and one in my belly. 
And a recently aquired cast on my right arm (broke my wrist last thursday). 
I've been raving for about 4 year.  My first party was the Gathering.  Must of
been in '91.  And I've been hooked ever since.  Fondest party memories were at
a warehouse in South San Jose off of.......shot, cant remember the name of the
street.  They used to have a lot of parties there.  There was this big Sail
Boat in the middle of the floor that everyone danced on.  I dont make it up to
SF as often as I used to but if there is a party in Santa Cruz, You'll find me
there.

I write ambient music under the name Astronout (its supposed to be spelled
with an 'o' as in -out, not -aut.  But people still call us Astronaut
anyways).    I also do some House and crazy Techno stuff.

Outside of dancing and raving and what not, I enjoy skate boarding (hence the
broken arm!)  walking on the beach, movies, all types of music 'cept country
and Queensryche or Rush. And I probably watch way too much TV.

    What's up y'all!  Just thought I'd take the time to try and introduce
myself.  I just joined the list about a week ago, and have pretty much got a
handle on the proper ettiquette to use (if I accidentally offend or annoy any
of you, please educate me ;'P  ).
    I moved out here from NY in the end of august and have been chillin' in
Santa Cruz, my new home town.  On my way out I stopped in Denver and went to
Skylab (fat party, had lots of fun).  Since I got to CA, I haven't been able
to get to any parties 'cuz of lack of transportation & friends with
tranportation.
    My first rave was a party under the brooklyn bridge in 93 (?) called
Sattellite, I've been hooked ever since.
    If any of you want to extend some good vibes to a newcomer feel free, and
if you need a companion to go to parties with... well, 'nuff said.

have you ever read about something where you wanna send a protest
  fax to some clutzy sleazy corporate type who's tweaking the environment
    but don't have a fax handy?

RAN has a page where they cover their latest action item, and you
  can type in and send a fax using the web form!

kicksass!!!

Dear All;

	& Hello; latey it kinda seems like people have taken interest in my
personal life, life as raver ...etc. So what do ya want to know, better
yet, what don't ya want to know :). God knows I wouldn't want to torture
people like Dave Alves, with the "clueless" details of my life. = >
(sarcasum present)

	Things like this cause me a great deal of concern. I'm just not
the type of person you can say a few words about, it would just be a waist
of time, and bandwidth for me. There's so much I want to share with the
people I consider family.

	I don't chose to call myself Brian Darkness for not. Being
mysterious is kinda cool, but I'm about shedding light & awareness, even
though I do a good job at shedding darkness, better than a type IV Demon
for those D&Ders out there :). I'm a relativily visible raver on our scene
ta-boot, coming up on almost a year here on SFR, which sometimes I feel,
my silence around ?'s like what do you do, who are you Brian Darkness?
generate suspicion, rather than acceptance, yet the answer's amost always
generate more ?'s going deeper and deeper into my p-life. 

	Let it be known that I have nothing to hide, I not an ax murderer,
or escaped con, and the only people that want me are the Florida State DMV
for a traffic ticket or two I've negelected to pay. But I also warn ya be
careful for what you ask for, you may just get it :). So in the mean time
if curiousity gets the better of ya, go look at Hyperreal Vrave People
Thingee, I forget what its called Laura sorry; the public version's in
there, under ABC, briandarkness. 

	It's hard when things are so personal, I don't want to be mean and 
say that it's none of your bussiness, yet I don't want to lie either, 
cause truth is important to me, more so, being true to thy self is even more.

Dear All;

	I'm very sorry to have to inform you all that there are four
individuals praying on our scene. These person/s lack any form of 
concern, compassion, or human consciousness; more simply put 100% pure 
sociopath. 

	While at Brian B. & Laura D. semi-private party Saturday we where
approached by person/s who were alledgedly offering what they claimed was
"pure MDA from Texas" in a 0 or 00 jell cap. The powder contained in these
jell caps varied in color consistency & gradulitity, and tasted sweet like
sweet tarts; which person/s claimed "it was cut with". They drove a
upscale clean(no dents) black 4 door with California plate # 3AAD600, the
car had Alien Workshop stickers on it, as well as Santa Cruz Sound
stickers. This could mean they are from the Santa Cruz Area. The person
selling the bunk E, was Caucasian, early 20's, 5'9", 170lbs, medium frame,
light brown wavey hair, and was wearing a New York Giants Teeshirt. His
compainion was black, mid 20's, 5'9", 200lbs, medium to large frame, and
had black short dreads. They're not very smart cause they let me get 
close to their car.
	
	They are not part of our scene, outsiders, possibly the reggae
scene, punk scene, and/or surfers, denoted by their appearence, music in
their car, and their two other compainions. These people think we are
fools, and as they drove away I'm sure they had a good chuckle. They 
travel the beach roads looking for parties, and are tring to get on SFR 
to obtain the calendar so they can use it against us, and our scene.

	If you see this car, please remember the license plate number it's
an easy one, Let your friends and other people know. Remember the MO,
taste any powdered E unless it's from an unquestionable source, especially
if it's in a large jell cap. If you see me, please tell me, I have a
special surprise for them, but nothing that would compromise, what WE are
about, or our scene. 

	Please be careful, these people do not share our values of PLUR
and could, if cornered possibly resort to violence, or even be armed. 
Cause there are about 4 of them, your could be dealing with the 2 and have
the other 2 behind you, and not even know it. 

	If anyone has pictures of that day, and you happen to get these 
individuals in your pictures please get them to hyperreal.com so we can 
digitize them and post them. A picture is worth a 1000 words, so please 
develop and look them over very carefully. thanks

> Anyone been to Maui? Anyone gone dancing in Maui? Anyone have any suggestions
> of somewhere to party in Maui?

W/r/t partying, you can both party everywhere and nowhere on maui. the
only place where the mythical thing known as partying (usually alchohol
fueled checking out of tan-lines between sexes) happens is Lahaina, or
as I like to call it LaHiney. I think there's a cheezy disco in some
hotel nearby too, but I hear it sucks. Anyways, about the best you'll
see is the Hard Rock Cafe and various equally cheezy/plastiscene
tourist traps serving overpriced alchoholic beverages to clientele
desperately trying to have a good time. Somewhere overlooking the ocean
on Lahaina's main drag is a bar where bands play -- they occasionally
will have a jawaiian reggae band playing that may put the glide in your
stride and the dip in yer hip.

You come from SF-Bay area, and you've seen some of our finer events. It
just don't happen like that in Maui so don't bother looking because
you'll be disappointed. (Honolulu on the other hand, can and does have
a small "scene").

nAture is the thing to check out while in Maui ... -- I suggest you
pick out a letter at the beginning of the alphabet, and find out if you
can taste the color of a rainbow.  This is best done by getting up at a
ferociously early hour and driving to Hana -- don't spend too long "on
the road" (and do it on an off-tourism day -- tuesday for example), and
try to spend as much of the day tripping/swimming around the seven
pools area at the end of the drive. Plan to entertain yourself come
evening because there's not much around, other than a few very posh
hotels ($500/NIGHT). But hotels aren't the point because it's the
closest *REAL* rainforest you can reach on a relatively small budget,
travelling in complete american comfort/safety. Of course, if the giddy
feeling of swimming in the seven pools has worn of, you may attempt to
drive home (about 3 hrs of windy 1.5 lane -- for two directions --
roads) at night instead of  car camping or whatever. In fact I
recommend night-time driving because you can see oncoming headlights,
which makes knowing that which lurks behind the next hairpin turn less
angst-laden.

Another excellent trip is the haleakala crater... a very pretty
moonscape of painted rocks. 

You must go snorkeling. Go to the end of the highway past kihei and
wailea, before you get to the part where the road goes over the lava
flows (i.e. the place where there are still trees), stop and look for a
sheltered cove, often with lots of snorkeling/diving activity. Bring
your snorkel and fins (or rent 'em in kihei). Swim around -- bring some
frozen peas from the supermarket and let the fish eat them -- within a
few moments, you'll be surrounded by hundreds of gaudy colored tropical
fish flitting about you in a spectacular specular 3D light
extravaganza.

ANd of course, go to the beach. Be careful with the waves, since
they're far more powerful than waves in CA and they *can* and *will*
damage you if you don't know what you're doing. ANd the Sun in Hawaii
is much much stronger than in CA (stronger than the sun at burning
man), so go easy on the Sun, and heavy on the sunblock. A sunburn early
on the trip can make the rest of the vacation quite horrible.

To sfravers. $2 admission tonight if you mention sfraves. Free vegetarian
food at 11:30ish.The founding idea  of  the gardening club is to ask Dj's
to bring down music they would play to their friends on a hazy Sunday
morning after a mad night, they are requested not to play anything that is
in their sets at that time insuring different and diverse music each week.
All monnies taken on the door is evenly distributed amongst everyone who
works at TGC, so door people earn the same as a DJ.
Thanks for use of sfraves as a communication mediam for spreading the word.

Is it possible that somewhere out in space there is a planet with a nitrous

For the umpteenth time, there are better ways to do this...I wish people
would keep their "stuff" and personal problems off the list.  Esp
concerning the buying of illegal substances.

I do not want to repeat the entire message.  Fact is someone, ADMITTED
PUBLICLY , the attempt to buy a Schedule 1 substance; felony.  Next they
gave the location of the purchase, a semi-private party on a very public
beach; not too smart.  Next they gave the names of the parties to which
this party "belongs" to, or was thrown in the name of; not too bright.
Next, a license number was given, once again in a public forum, accusing
someone or some people of selling illegal subtances; lack of judgement that
could have very dangerous reprocussions.

Next time, why not just call five-o, tell them your plight, let them know
where the offense occurred, and be sure to call them right away next time
so that they may SHUT DOWN THE F*CKING PARTY, and arrest the lot for
complicity!  That is after they have stripped searched everyone!

Next time one of you'se folx wants to buy drugs, can you please not
announce it to the world.  I, for one, really don't want to know about
deals going down.  Either good, or bad.  One of the main weapons the 'man'
has is this very thing.  The dealing or suspicion of dealing drugs at a
party location gives the 'man' plenty of "just cause" to fuck with people.
And all that has happened by mentioning this sorry episode in jonesing, is
bringing attention to whatever authority that, perhaps, their hunch was
right; yep parties == drugs.  NOT! NOT! F*CKING NOT!

I wish I could be more diplomatic about it.  But this crap has happened
before, and now is piss poor timing to mention anything illegal on this
list.  I have a sneaking suspicion that there is/are moles among us.
Especially with those who have had recent brushes with the law under the
same context.  Be very careful people.

Nuff said',
John

** Tue 10/24 "the acid jazz experience" part of the SF jazz fest, with
*New Legends, Kelly Huff, Better Daze, DJ Grey Boy, Slide 5 (anybody
*heard of these guys?? Any good??). At Bimbo's...

SLIDE 5 are awesome, I'd highly recommend seeing them if you're into soul n' jazz.  Also Greyboy is really cool and he hardly ever performs here.  Do you know if it's just him DJing or the entire Greyboy Allstars?

Ummm, what happened other than them selling bad E? Anytime you buy
something at a party from an unknown person you're taking a big chance. I
still think it's a bad idea to post specific information about people
allegedly selling drugs, albeit poor ones, to such a public list. In the
long run, the deleterious effects of such posts could have a greater
negative impact than a couple of hustlers. No need to give the powers that
be any more ammunition. I'm sure there's more than one cop on this list
running that plate right now...

The beach party on Saturday in celebration of Laura and Brian's wedding was
great - a mellow gathering of SF Ravers and friends enjoying some great
music. Ethan played the best set I've ever heard him play, and I was
pleased to hear great sets from Sho, Will-E, and Ozy, none of which I'd
heard play before. Hearing Jon Drukman play funky jams of the type that
used to define the "San Francisco sound" reminded me how I miss that style
sometimes.

All in all a great party. Thanks to everyone who stuck around to help us
carry stuff out at the end - I was amazed at how quickly everything made it
up the hill.

Veronika and I happen to be the folks putting on this show, so I thought
I'd tell y'all a bit more about it:

After about a year's worth of cajoling, we managed to pursuade the San
Francisco Jazz Festival to be the first major American jazz festival to
officially sponsor an acid jazz show. We did it to help promote the scene
in SF and to let the traditional jazz audience know that acid jazz is here
to stay.

All the acts in the show are on Ubiquity Records. Ubiquity is an excellent
local label owned by Mike and Jody McFaddin. They've put out a number of
excellent compilations (Home Cookin', Mo Cookin' Still Cookin',
Explorations I & II, Is that Jazz?) and are now putting out some full
length LP's (Greyboy, Spirit Level, and soon: Slide 5, New Legends, Better
Daze). They have also re-released dozens of 70's jazz funk records under
the name Luv N' Haight. We thought they'd be an excellent representation of
the local scene.

The lineup for the night is as follows:

Slide 5 (w/ special guest Ledisi) - a smokin' funk band featured on several
Ubiquity comps - these guys will be returning to SF after a year in NY and
the show will be their homecoming debut. Their first album should be
released around the time of the show.

DJ Greyboy - dope DJ/producer from San Diego - soon to be releasing his 2nd
lp - (Bart, he's just DJing)  ;)

New Legends - a hot new local band featured on the "Is That Jazz?"
compilation - I saw them at the Oddball and they fuckin' cooked!

Better Daze - a "double DJ" act with Paul Scriver and DJ Andrew from On The
One. Their first record will be released just before the show.

Kelly Huff - a world class scat singer featured on the Ping Pong cuts from
the Cookin' series.

Paul Scriver - saxman featured on the "Is That Jazz?" comp.

There will be a '60s-style psychedelic light show by Glenn McKay. Glenn
used to do lights for bands such as The Jefferson Airplane and is coming
out of retirement just for this show.

By the way, this aint gonna be a typical "sit in your chair and clap
politely" jazz festival show. The tables will be cleared and we expect the
dance floor to be bumpin'!

Tix are $18 (sorry, I know this is a bit steep, but there are alot of acts
and the Jazz Fest and Bimbo's take a hefty cut) and are available at the
Jazz Festival store next to Cyberlab @ Four Emarcadero Ctr. You can also
buy them @ Tower or the Wherehouse (with the BASS rip-off added) or at
Bimbo's the night of the show. We're also planning an afterparty (probably
@ 111 Minna if they get their licence in time) w/ Greyboy and Better Daze
freestylin' it.

I just sent the flyers to the printer today. If you want me to send you one
just e-mail your snail-mail address to me.

peace out,
ek  =o)

ps. we had a wonderful time @ Bonny Doon on Sat. the vibe was right on and
we enjoyed meeting new folks as well as reconnecting with friends we hadn't
seen in a while. i really hope we can all do it again soon...

I think your overreacting.  The only danger here is that the secret police
that have invaded the list will get some Judge to sign a search warrent for
Brian's house.  Joy, I'm sure they are chomping at the bit.

I've got news for you, the police already believe that drugs are sold at
raves.  The only reason they don't decend in mass on a rave and bust
everyone there is that they are too busy busting underclass blacks and
latinos.  It's a dark truth.

This made me think of something.  There's a book I bring with me to some of
the smaller raves called _The Second Earth_.  Basically, the idea behind it
is that there was this first earth that the original inhabitants destroyed
through their own ignorance of the environment and each other.  The
remaining population got into these gigantic spaceships and headed off in
search of a habitable planet, which they found thousands of years later,
namely, our earth.  In essence, they are our ancestors.  It's incredibly
well written (and frighteningly believable), and it is accompanied by
amazing illustrations.  At one private party, I think about 5 people asked
me to order them a copy :)  Anyways, I'll show it around the next time I see
all you crazy raver types.

Mr. Jake

	Woke up on the wrong side of the bed today huh, hon. Please take
some lessons in law please. The fact that electronic mail, can be

who sent it admits to it. This is not personal John, many people were

	Just for the record, I never mentioned anyones full name, or 
anything else for that matter that was literal. Please go read some 
legal theorgy. Do you how hard it is to prove in a court of law that 
someone did something, very, very hard.

Eightball, or aaaa Evermore, also I mentioned MDA, hmmmm what's that More

Dear Joe;

	Good I hope so. No one had a problem with me doing this when I 
don't them I was Saturday, everyone said yeah go a head, we need to 
inform others about these people.

	Joe, I was physically injuryed by these people who encouraged me 
to snort this stuff, my nose is still burning, why are you defending 
them, do you want them to do this to other people, or maybe they'll but 
battery acid in it next time to make it taste more chemical.

Last seen on the Connection II tapes, btw.  I love that stereo pan on the
synth bass hit zipping back and forth; it always feels like it's inside
the back of your head.

Actually I always thought the SF sound to be a more straight-four type
of beat but with the same swing feel to it, like back when the Garth/Jeno
axis was all that.  Had there been more funky tracks like the above defining
the "sound" I would have gone to more massives back then...

I'm a sucka for the two-and-four, like Spun used to play before he went
totally housey.  I almost wish "Raise Your Hands" had never come out so
people didn't get sick of that style all at once.

Good Music and Good People at Bonny Doon ....
 
 Mary and I finally got the generator to Bonny Doon , about 45 minutes 
later than the planned 12:15PM . It seemed that a lot of other folks had 
gotten there a bit late too. Many thanks to all the folks that hauled that 
heavy generator up and down those rocks and the great sand slope!!!  
After my Friday food poisoning , I still wasn't feeling 100% physically . 
 
 After hauling the canopy and other stuff down the sand slope, I helped 
my wife Mary get down it. I didn't notice that she was wearing Birkenstocks 
when we left the house or else I would have recommended shoes - they turned 
out to be the wrong footwear for her at Bonny Doon. They kept on getting 
caught in the rocks and sand . 
 
 Bryce started the music with some hits from the 80s ! I remember "I'll Tumble 
4 Ya" by Culture Club , Devo , B-52s , and (maybe) Bow-Wow-Wow !  Flashback
time!  About this time Mary and I walked to the shoreline and let the waves
wash our feet. 
 
 Bonny Doon is such a nice beach , and it holds so much wonderful memories 
for me now. The big SFRaves Connection rave , an FMR or two. And now I'll 
have another wonderful Bonny Doon event to associate with it!
 
 Thanks to all the folks that stopped by and talked to me and Mary. She was 
somewhat worn out herself , and couldn't visit the folks on the other side 
of the dance area . She did get some nice drawings - at outdoor daytime 
raves, she sketches while I dance. 
 
 I did more resting than dancing , but not for lack of great music! I also 
loved Jon Drukman's set , and Ethan's closing set was great! And all the 
other DJs were good too.
 
 Thanks to all the folks that stayed to help haul all that heavy stuff back 
over the rise and down to the road! Especially , of course , the guys that 
brought the generator back down to my truck! 
 
 I wish Brian and Laura many happy decades together !
 
 
      Larry Ching/larryc@netcom.com
 
 PS - Special thanks to : Wayne for the SFR laminate , Willis Wong for the
      conversation , Susie for being Susie , and all you folks who had a 
      smile to give me!

It would be awfully hard to beat a weekend where I went to Bonny Doon and
listened to great music and talked with my friends old and new all day
long with the most beautiful pleasant weather, went down to Santa Cruz
and ate late dinner at the Saturn Cafe, got up in the morning, had lunch
in the shade on the back patio of Zare on Haight St., checked in with
Joe Rice and Monte and friends at All You Knead, spun a good long session
at Ameba (going acid house->progressive->jungle->?->techno->kickin' house),
went to an absolutely fantastic Sunset at the Marina, had beers and nachos
at the Triple Rock, ice cream at Mel's, and *still* got enough sleep to
get in a full day of work today without falling head-first onto my desk!

Thanks everyone . . . it was great :) :)

Not really so sir.  I beleive the material sent by e-mail, as well as posts
to the usenet are and can be copyrighted.  By that fact alone the subject
matter and content can be regarded a 'real', therefore admissable.
Although I admit, I could be quite wrong.

Fact is my man, mentioning the dealing and talking about how you were
ripped off doen't help anyone but th ecops IMO.

You mentioned enough information to get some folx in trouble.  Whther it be
th people you accused of selling bunk stuff, or even menyioning the people
at a parties partial name.  Cops are not as stupid as some would have you
think.  Just ask Geronimo Pratt, or Mumia Abu-Jamal, or Rodney King.

You really think people are so stupid.  Who the FUCK deals Eightball on the

So, I guess you want me to be the one to name things outright.  No thanks,
esp. since I was not so careless as to mention any misadventures in E
purchasing.  You however, were not so careful.

Tedious.  Especially this childish subtrefuge.  Hey man, if you think it's
ok, please continue with your public service message about bad dealers.

You mentioned MDA, and you mentioned E, and you mentioned an attempt to
purchase, you mentioned method of transport, method of delivery, license
plates, etc.  If it were something legal you were purchasing, and felt as
though a merchant were ripping you off, you'd probably write a letter, or
inform the authorities that a scam was going onb.  Instead you made it very
clear it was drugs, you gave out a license plate number (really stupid),
and accused people of selling bad E. Get real.

Whatever.  Cops love wise-asses.  They would have alot of fun with you,
before, during, and after the search.  I know I wouldn't want a Mark Furman

There have been plenty of busts on the scene.  From people taking a little
dose at a club, only to have two COPS escort them out, and arrest them.
There have been epople pulled over and searched, there have been people put
in prison.  Directly from "our" scene.

As for ownership of this scene, I for one do not consider it mine to covet.
Something that is mine becomes something that belongs to me.  When I
establish the concept of me, then it becomes easier to call somebody them,
or those who do not have ownership.  I hate this type of elitism.  There is
"A" or "The" scene.  It belongs to nobody and everyone.  But hey, if you
want sole possession, please enjoy.  Parties of one can be fun.

And to think I'm using restraint...

Pace all,
John

Just to end the tedium, here is your admission of attempting to buy
Schedule 1 substances.  You replied specifically to Joe's message about a
Schedule 1 substance.  I'm sure what you were trying to purchase was not
vitamin E...or was it? ;)  But please, if you think it'll be a good public
service to "your" scene, don't let me detract.

Getting busted can be fun.  Especially if you get a big brute of a cell
mate who has not had the company of a woman in 5 years.

Just a thought.

Out,
John

Cops are never to busy to bust anyone!

I love oversimplifications.  There are some very non-black people that have
been sent to prison/jail for dealing.  Oh yeah, they were/are part of
'this' SF scene.

I don't beleive we should give cops more fuel to their fire.  I know the
majority are quite aware of the ramifications of Brian's post.  You ever
wonder WHY it is so difficult to find 18+ places in the city?  Why it is
difficult to get permits for anything here in SF?  Why it is hard to have
an 18+ bust free party here in the city?  Why the SOMA crackdown?  Why all
the recent spate of drug busts?  Why ABC and the cops went around harassing
club owners?

One of the FIRST issues they cite to fight are DRUGS and BOOZE to underage
people.

Just ask any SOMA club owner.

I have a friend that does T-shirts and was thinking that the Laminates that
Vince had, (by the way Vince thanks for mine) would make a cool shirt...with
something on fron and back like the laminate...one on one side and the other
on the other with the colors and all. He's going to check it oout this week
to see what it will take to make some...Does this seem a good Idea??

will do. by the way, if you're into AJazz here's a couple of other options
in SF:

Monday nights: Mushroom Jazz/JazidUp - a club I started a couple of years
ago, but am no longer involved in. Now at the Cat's Alley Grill on Folsom
bet. 7th & 8th. Music is always good. The crowd varies a bit. Sometimes the
vibe is great. Sometimes it pulls a slightly aggro crew of guys mainly out
to scam on the ladies.

Thurs. nights - Le Jazz Hot - Nickies bbq - 460 Haight - Thurs @ nickies is
ubiquity's night, hosted by DJ Andrew from On The One - its a blend of aj,
soul, and other funky wax

330 Ritch St. - this is a restaraunt/club in SOMA with an AJ vibe. it often
pulls kind of a yuppyish crowd - not the best place to dance, but ok for a
drink with a friend

 Bulletproof parties - Bulletproof is a clothing store on haight St. that
sponsors a Friday night party at Goldies in the 'loin. two floors, one with
aj and one usually w/ deep house. They also throw the awesome SF Boat party
one sunday each month. the next one is on Sep.24th. the boat cruises around
the bay for 4 hours and winds up at mission rock for an afterparty. on a
good day it is fully worth the $25 bucks.

-------------------

also, if your into ambient etc. check out the Gardening Club at the
Carribean zone behind DV8 on mondays. its super chill w/ an eclectc mix of
music. run by Darkhorse and my good buddy Charlie Edwards. a must...

when I finally make it to portland i'll be sure to ask you for advice,

peace & love,
ek  =o)

Wow.. Sounds like the doon was fun.  Nancy & I couldn't make it.  We were
at mission rock on Friday night when she hurt her back.  After we tried to
go upstairs, we realzed Nancy was 'stuck' on the stairs.  She was in PAIN!
My friend Brad & I had to pick her up and carry her out.  After bringing
her to the chiropractor, we found out she had a pinched nerve from a disk
that was out of place.  She's been in  bed for a while (she can't really
move)..  So please wish her well!

-Jon

..... and of course, we missed another good party :(

Great Idea! I, for one, would like to have the option of wearing a 
t-shirt on occasions when a dangling laminate might bounce around too 
much (ie-dancing....).

Whoa!  We just went through all this on the NW Raves list.  This is total
deja vu ....

Brian, I know that your intent was good and I do appreciate that you care
enough to risk posting to a public forum.  But what everyone else has been
saying here is true .... summed up,

DON'T SAY ANYTHING ON THE LIST THAT YOU WOULDN'T BE AFRAID TO YELL LOUDLY
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ANNUAL POLICEMEN'S BALL.  :)

True, it may be hard for anyone to actually crack down and prove anything
concrete, but the fact is that ANY mention of ANY kind of drug activity
brings attention, be it "John Smith who lives at 1234 west 5th sold me some
wicked lysergic acid diethylamide and he has 100 more in his freezer" or
"someone said they saw some guy down at the beach rave who might have been
selling some gelcaps".  It's a sad fact of life in the rave community .. oh
well.

that's my $.02, anyways.

Your point is well taken, Adam, but in this case I think it's good that
this is up front on the list.  There are ppl who will post anything about
anything here in the public forum and sometimes, although it might be
important, it just isn't a good idea.  I'd rather thrash it all out in one
big debate ONCE than keep having to tell ppl DON'T POST THAT, YOU SILLY
KID!!!

Hey groovesters -

One of my fellow Teleporters is moving to SF and looking for a similar 
provider.  Teleport is in Portland, has 10,000 subscribers, is a very 
grass roots orginization dedicated to hopefully bridging the gap between 
the haves and the have-nots as far as the Internet is concerned, offering 
discounts to non-profits adn stuff like that (boastfully beaming as a new 
employee :-)

Any bites?

This is all very paranoid. First of all, "admitting" an attempt to commit a
felony is not a crime, and nothing can be done by the legal system without
evidence or even a complaint. No cop can go up to whatever car was given out
and say, "Come with me, I read on SFRaves that you've been selling fake
sweet tarts." 

Do you think the illegal activities of this scene are any mystery to anyone
anymore? Hoo wee, we'd better shut up a little bit before everyone (and
their close cop friends) finds out that ravers go to secluded spots, set up
large sound systems, take lots of drugs and dance all night. If you're clean
you have nothing to worry about when the shit goes down.

The original poster was engaging in a time tested mechanism for dealing with
these problems without going to the man. It's called street justice, which
doesn't necessarily involve pain or harsh penalties, but is a way of letting
those who might be similarly taken to be informed about the people they are
dealing with. See the new Spike Lee movie, "Clockers," which touches on this.

[ To SFRaves ]

 By the way , a short (I'm at work) apology to those folks at Bonny Doon
whose names I forgot or screwed up. Especially Cindy Kawakami and Tamara.
It's been a personality trait of mine that's kept me out of many 
activities that require remembering people's names ( like politics ... 
:-P ).

They injured you (attacked you, etc.) or you injured yourself by snorting
an unknown substance?

You missed my point. I'm not defending them, I'm concerned about the
ramifications of posting such detailed info about illegal activity on this
list.
Do we really need more evidence for the govt. to point to when they deride
raves as drug parties?

If you feel like they deserve to be arrested, call the cops.

Look, we've all been burned before - that's life. Would the revenge exacted
by getting these people arrested make your nose feel any better? Does that
seem like a fair trade?

In your reply to John you mentioned inadmissability of email. Uh, I doubt
some anti-drug zealot of a cop is going to ignore information that may be
legally inadmissable. He'll just look for something that is, or try and
find an outstanding warrant for instance. It would be foolish to think they
wouldn't utilize such info if presented to them.

btw, the song in question is "Boom Box" by Bitin' Back on Fokus records,
from 1991. It used to be hard to find, but a bunch of copies have popped up
in the last year or so. I think they might have some at Primal in Berkeley.

to be honest, i don't think there is any real "sf sound".  certainly there is 
no consensus among the music makers... but despite lack of coherency in the 
music-production scene, there is at least a resurgence of the funky break.  my 
Bass Kittens project is of course obsessed with the break, but there are also 
new discs from bassbin twins, electroliners, brain candy enterprises and 
others that are funky as hell!

there is also a lot of good stuff coming out of LA in a similar vein.  now we 
just have to figure out how to get some parties in SF where they play it!  
(i'm seriously considering starting a club night for devotees of The Funk...)

> Had there been more funky tracks like the 
> above defining the "sound" I would have gone to more massives back 
> then... 

maybe you should have gone to more massives back then... cos i used to hear 
tons of stuff like that.  where do you think i picked up such a predilection 
for it?  :)  there was a time where jeno, spun and garth were heavily into 
electro and breakbeats... check out the New Years Eve Vision Tape collection 
for evidence.

> went totally housey.

oh man, what happened to Spun?  i heard him a few weeks ago at ethan's party 
and i was totally disappointed... he inspired me back in the day... now he's a 
pale shadow of his former self.  :(

Another in my continuing series of not-exactly-rave-related posts...

I have decided I want to move to San Francisco.  Now, all that remains
is to find work.  I have a resume ready if anyone has any leads.  I am
looking for a position as a producer or coordinator of interactive or
Web-based projects.  I have a lot of background in production and 
computer graphics and business and management.  Great references.
Good with the kids.

Any information that leads to my employment gets treated to dinner
at the place of their choosing.

   Yeah I knows the feeling, this is ah ah oh yeah Reagan here. i am sooo 
terrible about remembering names when I go out. I think name 
tags should be distriputed at all parties( you know, like stick 'em right 
on our S.F. raves laminate) for us who have a wee bit of a memory problem.

Fine, tell your friends, don't post some person's license plate to 800
people. Who knows if the car belongs to those guys anyway?

Did these guys know they had bad E? Were they maliciously preying on the
scene, or were they just dealers who had to make their rent and got a bad
batch of e? Most dealers know much less about their product than they
purport to. Do we really know the situation and intentions here? All we
really know is Brian snorted something he bought from somebody and his nose
hurts. If there's some other evidence pointing to their malicious intent
I'll tend to believe it more than I do now - I still don't think Brian's
post was the best way to go about warning people - especially if the motive
is to prevent harm to the scene.

There's a difference between "I had a grEat timE at the GathEring" and
"here's the plate number of some dealers and here's what they look like,
and here's where they were last seen."

Here's a credo that would've prevented all this in the first place:

Don't buy drugs from an unknown person, especially at parties.

Fuckness
--------

Now that I have talked with an attorney,  I can elaborate to some
extent on what happened to us.

For the last 3 months,  Craig,  Another friend,  and myself have occupied our
time hanging out in the Mill Valley Town Square.   This is where a number
of my clients are,  and it's nice to sit outdoors working on the computer.
We also travel with each other,  as our other friend has a reliable car.

So,  after dropping Austin at his home,  we are driving down Miller
(High pig infestation area) but fastest way home.

Craig was driving carefully,  not going too fast or breaking any traffic
laws.   Almost immediatly,  we got pulled over.   Without hesitation,  the
cop,  a mr S Luscombe,  having a thick British accent,  claimed to smell
POT in the car,  and insisted that we immediatly give him the pot.
We actually hadn't smoked anything in the car at all.  Luscombe then
went into a paranoa fit and started hassling My other friend for having a knife
in the car he used while working at Whole Foods.   Craig was Handcuffed
while the cop was going through his things.    I was in the front passenger
side,  and in the corner of my eyes,   I saw another cop staring at me.

They eventually got to me,   they demanded that I raise my hands while the
officer un-hooked my fanny pack, and dumped out the contents and said
"Whats that?",  "And That?".   Anyways,  I was charged for posession of
controlled
substances and went to court today.   The police report claimed I concented
to the search....   BULLSHIT!!

It is a high probability that we will get drug diversion.   If not,   I might
be able to hire a really good attorney.   I talked with Matt Wilson,  a friend
of Tony Serra (Famious drug lawyer).    As we talked,  he mentioned he saw me
at Burning man,  and was the one dancing with a funny hat.   Because the cops
searched US first before searching the car,    it is likely that he might get it
thrown out of court.   Police claim that the tail light plastic was cracked
and unlawful.   We took pictures of it today.   Also,  when my other friend
got his
car back from the towing yard,   the tail light fuse was blown,  and the
fuse panal looked like it had been tampered with.   I always get into the
habit of walking behind a car and saying "Blinkers left,  now right,   now
brakes".

Anyways,  they took us to Marin Co. Jail,  where Craig got put in the "Old jail"
and I got put into the New jail.   Craig and I were able to see each other ONLY
while waiting in the drunk tank or court holding areas.   On Monday,  we each
had $5000 bail.

On Tuesday,  we see judge again and got O. R.   EI:  Released with promise to
appear.

That evening,  after getting invited to watch a movie at Aaron's place,  I
walk down
the trail and steps behind my place,  through town to Aarons place on the other
side.   Just as I got to the parking lot,  a cop comes up and said "Lets
see some
ID!" and immediatly took my bum bag again and searched it.   He let me go,   but
the next day,  yet another cop did the same thing.

Then,  tonight,  on the way home,   I make a phone call,  and as me and
Craig were
at the payphone,   we got searched once again (for 4th time in less than a
week).

So,  Matt also says that it would cost $2500 to file a "Motion to suppress",
and he believes that because the police searched us first,  before searching the
car,   he thinks there is SOME chance.   I also think that this would be a very
good excuse to have a Crunch Defence fund party to raise that $2500,
because if
we win,  the police will back off.

I think that you raver folks might be in a position to really help me out.   I
propose that we try and hold a benefit rave to raise the $2500 I need for the
motion to supress the evidance,   because we think there was wrongdoing and
extra harrassment on the part of Mill Valley police,  and might be able to
convince the judge to drop the case if we get it supressed.   I'll be happy to
answer any additional questions provided that you send me your PGP key,  and
use my PGP key inclosed below when asking me questions about this,  so I've
included my PGP key and encourage anyone to please dust off your copy of PGP.

HEY PEOPLE!

Could we drop the currently running argument for just a moment and funnel
our positive energy out to those people/friends/companions who might need
it just about now.  I know that sounds all sappy and shit, and I can't go
into details at this time 'cause it ain't my place, but let me just say
that there are people who need our extra positive energy more than Brian
(and his nose) does at this moment in time.  (Sorry Brian, no offense.)

I know this is ambiguous, but do me a favor and think positive thoughts
tomorrow.

Thanks,

Tony R.

(Now back to your regularly scheduled bickering...)

Dear Joe; All;

	We have credital information that SUGGESTS that these PERSON/S; 
ALLEGDELY pulled the Doc Martin/Dubtribe scam. Still want us to be quiet
Joe, or next time you show up to spin at a event, and the people come
looking to you for their money, only to find out that these PERSON/S, are
no where to be found. Would you want them to be quiet about Narina to or 
is that different.

	Everything I said hear I would shout in a policemans ball for that
matter. You guys just don't get it, this is why despite the temenous
edvidence against OJ he is still not been convicted yet. If I yelled what
I said here in a policemans ball the cops would walk up to me and ask;
what to you mean by E, or MDA, who's Brian B, who's Brian Darkness for
that matter, and I would just give them disinformation. ARe you so sure 
that the person who posts under the handle Brian Darkness, is the person 
you meet at raves, god your naive. Fred put is so well when he said "No 
one knows if your a cad in cyberspace" hisssssssss. 

	Cops unlike people like you & John, have to deal with hard cold
reality submissible to a California State Judge, nothing but verifiable
facts, otherwise even the most laxidazical defense attoney will blow them
out of the water and make them look like fools. Ask any cop what he hates
the most, and he'll tell that being embrassed in front of a judge, his
peer. 

	I've been through the crimminal mockery system fellows, have you!!!! 
I know how hard it is to prove anything. Most people crummble when they 
go to jail, and tell the cops everything, sign their name to it, 
after their identity has been verified, in front of people sworn to tell the 
truth, that's why you have arrests. If every case went to court, if it 
was so easy to arrest and put people in jail, then why to they offer 
deals, why is their plea bargaining, reduced sentances for those who 
cooperate., common guys thing about it, use those brains I know you have, 
and stick you ego's in your pockets where they belong.

	I faced three felony counts(non of your bussiness), got them 
reduced to misdermeanors, and walked with self regulating probation, 
with a public defender. Get real please!!!!!

	Nuff f-in said, god I'm pissed!!!!!!!

I was going to stay quiet and just follow this thread but this last message 
tweaked something inside of me.  Regardless of all the conjecture, the bottom 
line is would you incriminate a fellow raver?  I know this is carrying things a 
bit too far, in fact, Eric Hill stated that "This is all very paranoid.", but if
our e-mail was monitored and more government attention was given to the scene as
a result, what would happen to the cyberspace community that has given many of 
us joy in finding people who uphold many of the same values and interests in 
common?

Granted there are loopholes w/what's stated in e-mail and what actually happens,
but look what's happened with the AOL/child pornography case (w/r/t e-mail) or 
for that matter what's happened with the New Year's Eve AIDS fundraiser (w/r/t 
false arrests and illegal searches per Monicat's message yesterday).  

I don't know all the facts with either of the cases mentioned above, but I do 
know that not all humans are infallable and not everyone in any group is honest 
and law abiding...the government included.  I also know that we should show 
common sense and consideration of others.  (What's plur all about?)

We've learned as a group how to handle particular phone numbers and renegade 
spaces (e.g., Sunset & Full Moons) and we've seen what can happen if the scene 
grows too quickly w/o an understanding of what "raving" is all about (why don't 
_you_ go to massives anymore?).  After all, why is it that many of us don't 
subscribe to sfraves at work or that we use psuedonymns?  I don't think it's a 
far stretch for us to apply this same reasoning for personal recreations.  And 
as another brother said, "Caveat Emptor."  

So I know notifying the group was meant well by a general post, but instead of 
dragging others into a personal drama, perhaps it'd be better to spend your 
energy into building sources that won't let you down in whatever you do.

On a much brighter less preachy note, I hope y'all can make it to the Burning 
Man After-Party on Friday.  There's so much we can do as a group and this is 
just a taste of one small part of it :)

what say we get together at this old warehouse up here at 308 Industrial in
Vancouver BC on the night of the 22nd of September for a MASSIVE HUGE LOUD
party with no permits and give out e, that GREAT drug, free at the door to
minors!

Of course, this will all have to wait until I've finished unloading that
shipment of raw opium which I have to distribute to welfare bums and street
kids and then I have to dump that 500 gallons of liquid LSD into the
Greater Vancouver water supply, but I'm sure I can manage to find time to
honk a few lines of good China White cocaine with y'all before the main
event.  Don't forget the needles!

You probably won't know me from parties since I haven't been out in a 
long, long time, but since I lurk and post to the list a bio may be 
appropriate:

I'm an artist. I make steel, clay, glass sculptures... big stuff. I 
also paint and draw and print. Current fascination is bookmaking and 
I've got a small rusty letterpress which I'm trying to get into working order.

For money I work as a DTP and Page Compositor for Sybex Computer 
Books, Inc. in Alameda. [I was a graphic artist and designer here 
until they did away with the Graphics department.]

Aside from making art what I like to do: hiking, spend days on the 
beach or in the woods with friends, my best frined is Evan, a 4 year 
old Boxer dog who goes almost everywhere with me. Listen to music and 
make art. LISTEN TO MUSIC AND MAKE ART! That's about it. Oh yeah, I 
like to cook fantastic meals and throw dinner parties for my friends. 
Herbal medicine & healing.Considering going to school to become a Traditional 
Chinese Medicine Doctor.
 
My Rave History: I went to an FMR a long time ago, maybe '91, at this 
swampy area somewhere south of San Francisco (I don't really remember 
where).Later that year there was a party in Bolinas near a trailhead. 
some guys with an old bus (Josh and CB...are you guys on this list 
maybe? I know a friend of yours!) threw it.
The outdoor parties I went to really influenced my life in a 
positive way. Even tho' i don't get to so many parties I still feel 
that I'm a raver at heart.I love to dance. I love trance.

Why don't I go to more parties? Basically I'm suffering a major 
depression (related to an ugly divorce) which makes me unable to snap 
out of it and get to a party (I really don't want to bring this 
downer vibe to a party!). Catch 22. A party might be the best 
medicine! And I'm really, really shy.

But whenever I *do* get to a party( I *almost* made it to F8 this 
weekend):
age:31, but look younger; Hair: Dark Brown with red/Auburn 
highlights, mid-back length; Eyes: Dark Blue; Complexion: Pale white; 
Height: 5'5"; Weight: I dunno! not skinny, not fat. Muscular 
(ex-gymnast)

My looks are kinda plain, I dress kinda plain. You wouldn't realize 
that I'm anything but a nerd until I start one of my giant, 
wide-mouth laughs and my tongue piercing catches the light, or until 
you talk to me and discover what a true freak I really am.

yikes! this should be enough!

alissa (a.k.a. A)

Dear Joe;

	Did you get ripped off, no, well hon neither did I; I got my money
back, others didn't though, others have their trust in our scene
compromised forever. Their intent is malicious, their actions screamed
that, ask anyone who dealt with them, ask Ethan what he thought of them,
he asked them TO LEAVE!!!! Your shooting from the hip on something you
know very little about Joe, that's the fact, and I'm sick of it. 

	By eating 2 & snorting the 3rd, and waiting in their car, I was
giving them the benefit of the doubt, there's no doubt Joe. They said 
they would be back to check on everyone, they never came back, Joe.

	Oh Mr. Joesph Rice please do tell us all how it should be done.

	I trust that when all the evidence was presented I would be vindicated.
I trust the system, having been through it, even if it took several appeals.

	Thank you Joe for some real advice!!!!!!! I'm personally

What happened is he started playing music that he could be more expresive
with. He did play some sick breakbeat set's for the time, but two hours of
sample based beats gets extremely boring and undanceable for many people.

i probably wouldn't find it too annoying but i agree that some people would... 
when i get longer sets i always vary it between sampled beats and straight up 
drumbox stuff...

Dear All;

	I'm at the end of my argument your honnor, anything more will 
just take us in circles. I will except no more posts on this topic either 
public or private, and if I get them I will just delete them unread. I 
strongly disagree with the people here who are clearly enableing forces 
outside of our scene to continue to prey on us, without recourse. It 
makes me think, gee maybe their getting a cut; just kidding!!!

I'll be spinning ambient from around 10-11pm tonight on KPFA, so if 
you're at home wondering what CD to put on, try turning on the radio...

I don't actually remember the frequency of KPFA, but it's way on the left 
somewhere (around 88 or 89).  Just play with the dial and listen for 
some tweaky electronic noises (possibly even beats) :)

I'm sure Dubtribe would love that info if they don't have it already. I'm a
little lost by your second sentence there - why would anyone ask a DJ for
money, =)

Promoters throwing parties and screwing people is a little different than
drug dealers screwing people. Unfortunately both professions tend to
attract the unscrupulous. =) The difference is that in our society drug
dealing (and use) is particularly frowned upon and many will go out of
their way to stop it. Of course, it's also illegal, which could lead to
more far reaching ramifications for those accused.

Yeah, we should hear about promoters who screw people so we can avoid their
parties. As far a drug dealers screwing people? I think the potential harm
from a public post outweighs the public service of such a post. I believe
there's a lot more personal responsibility involved on the consumer's part
when buying something from an unknown dealer than when buying a ticket to a
party.

Uh, he's not convicted yet because the trial's not over...=) But that's way
off-topic. =)

As far as that last post with all the personal comments, I'll let that lie
other than clarifying that my comment about 'stringing them up' was
straight up sarcasm. As a friend once pointed out, however, sarcasm doesn't
work in the dark.

Well, if this is the way it's gotta be then this is the way it's gotta be.
Turns out there are two Equinox parties happing this weekend, both in the
Sierra mountains.  They were both planned well in advance and didn't know of
each others existance til Burning Man.  You probably already heard about the
Light party that's happening, and there was a sincere attempt (I understand)
to combine the two parties into one big event.  But the promoters of the
parties couldn't come to an agreement because of some problems at BM so now
there are two camping parties happening in the Sierra's.  I'm sincerely
disappointed that some agreement could not be made, but I had nothing to do
with the negotiations.  So here's the lowdown.


ELEVATION

Saturday, Sept. 23 - Sunday, Sept. 24

Two days of dancing, drumming, camping, hiking, swimming, dreaming, living,
loving and listening.  So bring your tents and camping gear.

DJ's:  Gavin (Tweekin Records), Ted (Primal Records), Rig-a-Tony, Karizma,
Flash, Pez (Adrian), Chris Burkes, Chezbo (Marin), Phil,  Frog (performing
live).  Ambient morning: Rick 

(916) 974-8201.

$5


Hope I see you there.  And again, I'm bummed I can't go to the light party.
Why can't everyone just kiss and make up.  

Rick

I can say the same thing about drumbox-based beats, which is 
unfortunately the norm.  Mixing them up is how you get people to
really go wild.  Crank the energy up, hit the breaks, then let
people down again with some smooth house.  Or, just drop
in an 8 or 16 bar break for the bridge.

I would absolutely throw a rod if Ethan (or anyone) suddenly mixed some
breaks or jungle in with their deep trance.  Hit one of those half-minute
builds, then WHAM!

Just you all wait until we get the sound studio built here at work.  If all
else fails, do it yourself >%^)

I don't.  I've seen several people slammed by it, and a couple people who
got through.  Do you feel lucky?

> I trust the system, having been through it, even if it took several appeals.

I take it that you either have a _lot_ of money to waste on lawyers or
_no_ money and don't mind rolling the dice for years of your freedom.
Either way you waste a lot of time dealing with the problem, time as
surely gone as if you had been to jail.  I'd rather spend my time living
my life and fighting the source of the problem (drug prohibition).

"There are a thousand people hacking at the branches of evil for every
one that is striking at the root" -Emerson, or maybe Thoreau

The problem I have with such an appeal to the list is basically thus:

	If you're going to "do something" about these guys, go and do it.
Don't appeal to the list and hope someone else will take the revenge that
you are afraid to take on these people.  Community justice is fine, but
what am _I_ supposed to do on your say-so?  Slash their tires?  Come on.

 NO it isn't - KPFA in Berkeley is at 94.1  .

Subject: Trying to organize a benefit party
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

Hi...  After talking to a number of people over the last week and kicking
ideas around,   many suggested they would support the idea of having a
benefit party to raise the funds for my legal fees.   I wouldn't think
it would be proper for me to organize it.    Is there anyone out there
with this kind of experience who could help with the organization?   Let
me know and we can take it OFF LINE and work it out.   Almost all of the
DJ's I talked to,  would be willing to spin for free.

My attorney says today,  that if I could come up with $1500,   he would
start the process of filing a motion to supress the evidence.   Today,
he advised me to fill out a citizens complaint against Steve Lucombe.
I filed it today.   I expect to get retalitory action from the police in
the form of continued harrassment,   but i'm NOT going to go away and hide.
Instead,   I'm going to be very visible in town,  as I go around selling
the idea of WEB pages for the local clientel.   Wish me luck...   Let me
know what you can do to help out with....

  * Sound system
  * DJ's
  * Venue
  * decor
  * flyers (promotion)

And anything else necessary to hold a party...   I think that we want to
shoot for $7 - $10 admission fee,   does that sound reasonable?

Here are my 2 cents worth on the all the stuff goin on here @ sfraves.....

on the EVIL PEOPLE thing....
        it seems that this started as an innocent little warning that has
gotten OUT OF HAND!! if the goverment is monitering all of our
messages,then all the paronoid people stop bringing it up and adding to the
"EVIDENCE" all others cut the bickering..and talk about something more
useful/interesting...SOMEONE WAS HURT BECAUSE THEY SNORTED BAD
WHATEVER..:you take that chance everytime you buy so don't blame antbody
but yourself...

ON THE WEDDING....
        COULD not make it,...Wish I could have...
CONGRATULATIONs MR&MRS Behlendorf!!!

ON EVERYTHING ELSE...
        House is here to stay..I think there should be a page on the
history of SFraves not the neccisarly the list but the actual parties and
the scene in general i'd love to help anybody let me know..also i need an
SFraves laminate..anybody know how to get one??Shirts I agree would also be
a great idea.. Thank You Everybody for the info I asked for (VERY HELPFUL)
I know it was kinda old but I am (I think..Let Me KNow!!)a dying breed of
The Love of Hardcore I wish they had a club out here that was like an
oldies of rave club type thing that isn't like city nights or Top 40
shit...Hope to meet you all soon I promised Jan i'd goto Sunset on
Sunday(415)985-7109 so maybe i'll see you there...(5'11', blonde hair, blue
eyes, chrome belt buckle that reads "RAFONE")
until then....

  I'm sure Brian B. would have chimed in by now, but I'm sure he's too
"busy." ;)  So I'm reprinting this post from him.  A similar situation
happened a while back(the person addressed below posted the first name of
someone he believed to be selling bunk E).  I'm not playing netcop, and I
don't have any connection with hyperreal (besides s*bscribing to sfraves).  FYI.

i don't know any of the details here, but it seems to me that having two 
different parties is not necessarily a bad thing... sometimes you just 
can't hang out with all of the people all the time, and that's 
fine...smaller parties often feel more intimate, as wel.

well sorry to waste bandwith guys, but I would just say to let it go.  I 
mean we were all discussing how un PLURlike these dealers actions and 
suddenly, the conversations themselves became unplurlike.  All Brian was 
trying to say, is some dealer is bad...don't buy from him.  He wasn't 
advoctaing nuclear warfare or something.  I mean lets just all back 
off...I know I am.  Instead I will sit here in my chair, listening to 
Enya and just beam out a ton of POSITIVE energy to EVERYONE!!!!! It's 
4:15 and if I wake anyone up, I am really sorry!

BTW< it is kinda funny actually.  There was a post a day or two ago to 
SocalRaves about someone buying a NItrous balloon and then while 
semi-conscious getting his pager stolen.  He warned everyone on the list 
to stay away from them, and there wass no problems.

As we can see, trolling is ever present in this post.  All anyone was
trying to do is to let you know what damage you can do by running off at
the mouth.  Just because one has freedom of sppech does not mean that it
should be used in any fashion one wishes.  It should be used in a
responsible fashion IMO.

In any case, please feel free to do what you want, and others will feel
free to say whatever they wish back.  Consider it a consequence of having a
right such as free speech.  Please don't expect your words to go
unimpeached or unchallenged.

BTW, I still think you're quite wrong for posting your drug deal gone bad.
If it was so bad you shoulda called the cops, but you really can't do that
when you're trying to buy E and get ripped off, huh?  And if some guys are
asking about someone who put thier license plate up on the net, I'll be
sure to direct them to you.  That way you can clear up whatever
misunderstanding you have with them as it relates to dealing bad Schedule 1
drugs, ok?  Cool.

When one ceases to ignore the truth and suspend reality, it then beehoves
me to step out of said person's way.  I would be remiss by standing in the
way of ones scheduled fall into the pit.

Good luck Brian,
John

To all who attended (or wanted to attend) last Friday's Frequency 8

Thank you all very much for coming (or sending your energy)
The fog never came in, the garbage was at an all-time minimum, the vibe was
TRULY excellent and a lot of sfravers really helped us keep it together -
Special thanks to Vince and Wayne for bring the laminates, and for helping
us solve our "technical" problems early in the evening.

We have been wondering if it might be a good idea to organize some sort of
event in San Francisco that would make our collective presence known to the
political "powers that be" or the current crop of wannabees in this election
year.  In my opinion, the Jordan years have not been too friendly towards
our community.  Do we think that a change of mayor could improve the current
situation, or make matters worse?  Do we think that benefits could be gained
by organizing some sort of "rave the vote" like the "rock the vote"
organizing?  Would we want to organize a benefit for a particular candidate,
or for the democratic party as a whole (since it seems more than likely that
our next mayor will be a democrat)?
Opinions?  Suggestions?

I would say, start by giving the new mayor the benefit of the doubt.
Don't immediately assume they're against you.  Write a letter summing up
some of the problems of the past, explain what we're really about, and
give some proposals for how situations can be made better.

Start a dialogue on good terms.  It's easier than waiting until it's
an "us vs them" mentality.

Dear All;

	Brian Darkness attempted to inform his "friends" about a 
	situation in which other "friends" were ripped off.

	Some of his "friends" jumped on and dissed him severely, for reason 
	of fears based only in their heads

	Brian Darkness defended himself, and will continue to do so.

	This is what happened, watch what you post people, there may not 
	be moles on this list, but there are certainly

Dear All; 

	Opps almost forgot getting caught up in all this pissy shit. That 
Frequency 8 was last Friday. This event is what I would call a 
quintessental Northern California Rave. You can't beat the 
environment, put together by Mother Nature Herself, opps sorry Jim 
that's Father Nature. I had invited some people who where working at the 
Safeway where I shop, who had never been to rave before, and they said 
they would be back. 

	This was the largest event so far, excellent turn out, with a much
more commilcated lighting set, that had some minor problems, which I know
will be corrected next time. With a 5Kw generator you guys should have no
problems in the future, plus throw those ShitShack powerstrips into the
sea where they belong. 

	As you walked along the beach you where greeted by at least a 
dozen tee-kee torches, and some really cool lighting effects, plus some 
killer Goa Trance, that burned all night long, without fear of being 
busted, and that comes from the cops!!!!!!

	At about 3AM we were paid a visit by the Demon Raver who lives up 
in the cliffs, It came down from above with its burning green eyes to 
give us it's blessing as true children of the night.

	The best part I think is when the sun comes up and you can see 
everyone that you could really see all night long, and the smiling &
dancing faces, that's what does it for me. Plus the rocks are just too 
cool, especially if you using visiual enhancment substances.

	So when's the next one, Lynn at the diner was pissed she wasn't 
told about it Jim, but I've promised to keep her informed. See ya, and 
remember Frequency 8 For Trance.

"To all who attended (or wanted to attend) last Friday's Frequency 8

Thank you all very much for coming (or sending your energy)
The fog never came in, the garbage was at an all-time minimum, the vibe was
TRULY excellent and a lot of sfravers really helped us keep it together -
Special thanks to Vince and Wayne for bring the laminates, and for helping
us solve our "technical" problems early in the evening."

____________________________________________________________

*Thank You*!!!  

I had one of the best times I've ever had at a party.  I can't do it justice, 
but I thought the music was slammin', the people were way excellent vibey, and 
the scenery blew my mind.  

Just wanted to share...

When the sun came up, I was still jammin' away on my little piece of cardboard, 
fully flyin' and in a trance mode.   I realized  as I experienced the ocean, 
looking out at this blue, surreal site with it's pink foam and golden crests, 
living, breathing rocks jutting out in the sea (they certainly lived and 
breathed all night...I kept seeing them move around! ;-) ), the sun, ambiant 
sky, warmth of the vibe, and the completely peaceful feeling I experienced, 
that I had tears on my cheeks.  I held up my arms, outstretched and facing the 
world, embraced and gave thanks and praise to our Mother and Father and the 
people who make this scene so awesome.   I knew, in that moment, that I could 
die right there and I'd be totally happy, feeling only peace and love, because 
this is what *my* heaven is like.  I *know* it is.   

 It was a transcendental, truely enlightening, religious experience because 
it's changed my perception about life and death.  It left me exhausted but 
joyful, fulfilled, peaceful, full of love, and no longer fearful of what lies 
beyond.  I've heard of people having these experiences at raves...*Wow*!!!  

Way to go to all those beautiful people who made this party so special by 
showing up, picking the incredible spot, and spinning the awesome tunes.  More 
hugz to Wayne, Vince and Craig...y'all helped make it what it was...a great 
adventure and enlightening journey.

Love, Love, Love

Rikki

Don't forget the children, and the EXTREMELY childish behavior running 
rampant on this list.  Then again, is it really surprising that some 
might forget?    Tom

Now that that drama is over...I wanted to reflect.  Delete this now if
you're tired of John S. Lee's babble.

Warning aside, one of the things that irked me was some of the posts that
quickly suggested "...now let's move on...".  I know the diatribe and
fighting get old quickly, and everyone wants to be all lovey-dovey, and
full of good vibes and all that.  But face the grim facts.  Dealing with
humans has its good points and its bad points.  The good is that we can
share experiences.  The "bad" part is that your mileage may vary.  If in
fact this is a family, then the family must have its time to fight
occasionally.  The fighting should continue, IMO, until there is closure.
That's what being a family is all about IMO, sharing the really good times,
along with the really bad ones.  The real test is, can we still "meet" at
some point, and leave the past as a learning experience.  The long history
of SFRaves dictates, YES, we can.

Some of you want to end the fights as soon as they begin.  IMO this is
quite unnatural for humans.  We can certainly live amongst one another
without killing each other, but to deny argument, debate, strong
discussion, is to deny each of our humanity IMO.

If the family is really that strong it can survive more than a war of
opinion between its members.

So I guess I'm saying to the lot, who wanted to push this thing out into
the ether, and not be bothered with a debate amongst the siblings.  You do
have the right to close your ears, and walk away (bka the delete key), or
sit by and spectate (bka the choice of many), or become part of the debate
(bka the choice of the few).  IMO its all good.  But what seems to happen
of late is that the first group would rather not hear anything considered
confrontational by any means necessary, "...take it to e-mail!" is the cry.
I say for things that go on for a long time (like a week), maybe this is
necessary, but for short little spats like the one we witnessed, I feel
everyone can learn something from the experience.  Of course I am on the
other end of the spectrum, if I see a good fight, and beleive in the cause,
I'll jump in.  I think, that in time, we will all come to some agreement.
We have no other choice, if we truly are "family"

With that, I'm out,
Peace, Audi 5000, Quarterpounder w/ Cheese, Clocker, Docker, BootKnocker,

A detail latched me onto a specific memory. Years ago, during my first visit 
to the SF bay area, a local, on the corner of a street, told me the 
story, of how the bay was first discovered.
Sometimes a story has the power to create a full imaginal scenery.
This was one of them... or was I just thrown back into some distant memory?

It is not a complicated story, or a long one... rather it occupies the 
space of a single image: imagine... you and your crewmen have been 
searching, for days, maybe even weeks, for an entrance, a break in the 
coastline, one that would reveal the immense inside bay that early land 
expeditions had hinted at. Yet fog and rough seas have kept you errant, 
as if nature had decided to hide its secrets, as if 
the gateway were somehow protected. Yet you persist, endlessly. Then, 
one day, as the afternoon wears old, as the fog, which has
been your enemy, begins its relentless march and roll, you discern, vaguely at 
first, but then with increasing definition, the 
appearance of what you had been searching for. You and your crew eventually 
make it to the mythological opening, just as the sun is throwing its last 
beams over the fog wall which has kept a close pace behind the ship. And 
through the portal, during those last minutes of sunlight, is revealed 
an image, one of such beauty and meaning, that it will forever be 
imprinted on your soul: There, ahead, laid out like some medieval 
tapestry, along the horizon line where mountains meet water, burn 
hundreds of campfires, casting a peaceful glow on the surrounding mist.
Each fire indicates the presence of an indigenous family, each group of 
fires outlines the location of an indian village. And even before your 
mind has a chance to register the possibility of danger, you are stricken 
and overwhelmed by a sense of peace and wonder, beauty and harmony, as if 
the native people were displaying, one final time, the silent joy
that was their's.

That was the last sunset gathering in a long time... 

And sometimes, when we all turn around to face the west, when my hearing 
is inundated by ecstatic cheers and droning beats, sometime, just for 
the briefest of instants, I can swear that there is a tall ship
making its way through the golden gate... And I can only hope that, 
this time around, it's message is one of hope and happiness.

Hi all,

I must say I had a great time at Freq 8, thanks to Jim and the crew for a
job well done !! (except for some small technical difficulties on some
rented equipt :(, but that was quickly remedied) Anyway I met even more
great SFRavers, and passed out some more laminates !  Wayne did the same
the next day at Bonnie Doon !!  I think the count is up around 100 !!!  I'm
off do do somemore tonight. The Self Adressed Stamped Envelopes (SASE) are
still rolling in, and I'm sending them out as fast as I can, So one more
time for those of you who missed it earlier, here is my address if you
would like to get one by snail mail,


Vince

It's been really great to finally meet so many of you, these are some

Hi All.  I wrote the following a little earlier this week:

> I've got news for you, the police already believe that drugs are sold at
> raves.  The only reason they don't decend in mass on a rave and bust
> everyone there is that they are too busy busting underclass blacks and
> latinos.  It's a dark truth.

It has since been politely pointed out to me that the above statement could
be misconstrued as a racist slur.  Since I am not a racist, I wish to
explain what I meant.

It has become clear to me of late that the War On Drugs has become a
mechanism to oppress the underclass, in particular the minority underclass.
This happens because the underclass is easier to bust, have no money for
defense (where's the young black man on drug charges benefit party?), and
are wrongly perceived as the cause of all our problems (rather than a
symptom).

We as ravers benifit indirectly from all this because in the eyes of the
police, we are not nearly as "bad".

I hope this makes better sense,

PT

I haven't posted in a while, due to alot of work related stuff, and 
difficulties with my computer.  Still pretty busy, but I just got a new 
computer and thought I would start posting again with a brief bio.

I'm 35 y.o., 5'7" usually about shoulder length hair.  

Grew up in N.Y. and moved to LA after getting my BA in psychology.  I now 
have an MS in counseling and been working in the psych field for 10+ years.
I currently work in a psychiatric hospitol

After going to my first rave in the bay area (freedom harvest), I started 
looking for a job near SF, and knew it was time for me to leave LA.
I've enjoyed dancing since a new wave club opened near my college in 
1980.  For me raving has taken dancing to many more levels.  Raving helps 
me get in TUNE with my mind body and spirit.  Raving has taught me alot 
about love, and the joys of sharing.  Not only is raving therapeautic for 
me, I find that it helps me in the work that I do.  Raving helps me 
relate to myself and the world around.  Actually I feel I can go on and 
on about raving.  I'll try and keep my raving about raving to a minimum 
and get back to my bio.
Been raving for about 3 years. Been on sfraves about 1 year.
Other interests include, hiking in nature, running, playing guitar, 
exploring, traveling.

I just want to add that I really appreciate everyones contribution to 
the "scene".  With alot of your help I've had some of best and incredibly 
amazing times of my life.  I used to feel sorry that I missed out on the 
sixties being a little to young to fully experience them.  I am so 
appreciative of these times. The connections that we share...I'm not sure 
how to finish this sentence as I got caught up some warm emotions.  It 
opens my heart, and not only does it help me appreciate the beat of my 
heart, it helps me appreciate the beat all our hearts make together, and 
the individual beats as well.
All this thinking about beats has given me the urge to get up and dance, 
so I'll talk to you all later.  Hope to see ya out on the dance floor.

;)

place right on the water by the bay. The info # is (415) 455-3178. You should
also definately check out the Sunset party on Sunday.

A warm thank you to everyone who wrote back with fun stuff to do.  It 
turns out that my SO has plans to kidnap me for the weekend (the funnest 
of all!) so I'll be making goo-goo eyes this weekend but still wanna make 
it down within the next few weeks.  Thanks for making me feel so 
welcome...I'm quite shy these days ;)

love and kind thoughts,
bren

	My provider costs only $40 a year and has everything except

Hi all,

I must say I had a great time at Freq 8, thanks to Jim and the crew for a
job well done !! (except for some small technical difficulties on some
rented equipt :(, but that was quickly remedied) Anyway I met even more
great SFRavers, and passed out some more laminates !  Wayne did the same
the next day at Bonnie Doon !!  I think the count is up around 100 !!!  I'm
off do do somemore tonight. The Self Adressed Stamped Envelopes (SASE) are
still rolling in, and I'm sending them out as fast as I can, So one more
time for those of you who missed it earlier, here is my address if you
would like to get one by snail mail,


Vince
PO Box 576

It's been really great to finally meet so many of you, these are some
friendships that I know will last a long long time.

Hugs,

Vince

I Just want to take a second to say.....


I AM SO PROUD OF OUR SCENE AND THE LOVE WE SHARE FOR EACH OTHER THAT I COULD
BURST!!!

The one's who have met me say how cool or nice I am but I think it's that we
all, dispite our lil' arguments at times, share this ucommon thread of
kindness and well being for each other in our community...
I look toward the day when we can expand this love for each other into our
everyday professonal lives, able to relate to others with smiles.  To hug
another without any negative repacussions (sigh, what a thought...)

well I guess that's enough Sap for one day,

We now return you to originally scheduled life...

Hi Willis,  I agree about the bios, it's really given a multi-dimensional
aspect to the relationships we build on the list.  The people are more real
and closer.

On the 22nd ATOI dj's Lux, Michael & Dervish will be at a party.  The info
line is: (206) 447-3432.  If you like a groove, then you should definitely
check this one out.  It will be small & intimate & vibey.

Not sure about what's going on on Saturday.  I'll check into it and let ya know.

Definitely check out the Speakeasy.  I believe there's a membership fee
($10) and then it's $6 per hour but, I'm not sure.  Check out their page
at:   http://www.speakeasy.org/   it might have more info.  Really nice place to
hang out.  Great folks working there.  There are about a dozen text
terminals and an another 10 graphics terminals (Sun workstations).  It's
pretty easy to get on them.

Please call me when you get into town.  Perhaps we can have coffee and even
go out to the party on Friday. My number is 323-7101x3019 at work.

Peace!

Someone in sfraves sent me e-mail requesting the information below and 
unfortunately my system froze taking his post with it. :(  So rather than 
waiting...and waiting for MIS to track his e-mail address, I thought I'd just 
repost what was sent earlier.

Remember to RSVP if you come so we have a better headcount...and it'll end early
so there's still time for dancing elsewhere afterwards.

Hope to see some of you there!

Burning Man Afterparty
Friday, 22 September 1995 @0830pm
Apple Computer R&D Bldg. 4, the Town Hall Theatre
4 Infinite Loop, Cupertino, CA


Elise and I have quit our jobs and are working nights, 
weekends, and holidays to bring you the finest in home video 
entertainment from Nevada's beautiful Black Rock desert.  We 
are furiously editing stills and videos taken from CyberLab7, 
WBL, Team Fun, SPAZ, various web pages, and of course my camcorder.
     
Whitens the amazing Shark Car as it pulls donuts on the 
playa.  See couch surfers, and idiots (like me) parasail over 
a hard, unforgiving desert floor (splat!)  RAVE RAVE RAVE 
till dawn in the rain!  Witness the mindless destruction of 
various computing devices which would have been valued at 
millions of dollars only a couple of decades ago.  And 
finally, see the burning of a beautiful 40 story? (well, 
that's what it said on the web page) effigy of wood and neon.
     
Additionally, Weird Blinking Lights will perform 
electronic/ambient/drone music utilizing vintage analogue 
synthesizers as well as state of the art QuickTime music 
sequencing software.
     
Seating? Don't worry there's plenty!:
  The Town Hall Theatre is a facility capable of conformably 
  seating 298 primates.  It is the largest conference room at 
  Apple.
     
Food and Drink:
  Oh La La, our on-site caffeine merchant is used to feeding 
  hordes of hungry hackers and artists round the clock.  They 
  will be on hand for this event.  I have also managed to 
  procure a popcorn machine for those who are so inclined.
     
Directions.Local:
  Apple Computer is located on Saratoga - Sunnyvale Rd at 280 
  and is quite visible from the freeway.  There are off ramps 
  from both directions leading onto Saratoga.  Head toward the 
  large building with green windows to the South-East of the 
  point where the freeway and Saratoga intersect.  The entryway 
  off of Saratoga will take you to the main entrance, R&D1.  The 
  theatre is in R&D4 around the back side of campus.  Once you 
  have pulled into the main drive, turn left just in front of 
  the main entrance.  Go around until you see an entrance with 
  the number 4 in front of it.  There will be far too much 
  parking so please bring an extra car or two. ;-)  The theatre 
  is immediately to the right of the R&D4 entrance.
     
Directions.San Francisco:
  if (you take 280) 
      See Directions.Local:
  else
      See Directions.East Bay:
  endif
     
Directions.East Bay:
  If you are coming across the Bay Bridge, simply drive down 
  101 until you reach 85.  Take 85 to 280.  The first off ramp 
  is Saratoga - Sunnyvale Rd.  See Directions.Local:
  If you intercept 101 from a point East of 85, take the 
  Mathilda off ramp South and keep driving past El Camino till 
  you reach 280.  Apple will be across the freeway and to your 
  left.  See Directions.Local:
     
Directions.Los Angeles:
  Assuming you people don't fly (Reno Air would be best) , you can 
  always drive like idiots up *the 5!  Take Diane's Lexus, she 
  won't mind.:-)  I have recently discovered that speeds in excess 
  of 110mph can be sustained without attracting the attention 
  of law enforcement if done after dark (Maxima, the ultimate 
  flying machine!).  
  But seriously, please RSVP as I am providing crash space for 
  the LA contingent.  Bring sleeping bags and such.  The house 
  is quite empty and I have plenty of floor space as I have not 
  yet purchased furniture.
  ( * You will be pegged as an Angelino if you say things like 
  "*the* 5", or refer to 101 as "the Ventura freeway").
     
Volunteers, Apple Employees:
  I will need an Apple employee to man the main entry.  
  Security will not allow us to prop this door open.  Please do 
  not allow people beyond the R&D4 inner airlock as the immune 
  systems of our friends are not accustom to the strange 
  atmosphere within Main Campus.
     
Warning(s), PLEASE READ:
  Please clean up after yourselves.  It took weeks to clean up 
  after that Jittlov thing last winter and I will not have a 
  repeat of that.  We must leave the theatre as it was and I am 
  not your mother!
     
  The theatre is *supposed to be* isolated from the rest of 
  campus.  But if you *do* find a way, please don't go beyond 
  the inner doors of the R&D4 building.  I have been warned on 
  three separate occasions that if *any* non-Apple being is 
  found lurking anywhere on the rest of campus unescorted I 
  will never be allowed to hold an event like this again, so 
  please...!
     
Communication:
  Please title all replies regarding this event with 
  RSVP BMan: (foo)
  and send to nozefngr@apple.com
  Now watch, I'll get a whole bunch of "RSVP BMan: (foo)".
     
  RSVPs would be nice.  Oh La La would like to know how much 
  caffeine and goodies to crank out.  They would like to know 
  by about the middle of next week.
     
  If you need to contact me by phone:
  1 800 680 7351 (pager) or
  1 408 862 2931 (Apple voicemail, this will activate pager)
     
     
This will be an extremely fun event.  We who participated in  
Burning Man will have a wonderful opportunity to share our 
experience with our friends.
     
See y'all at the movies!!
     
-Chris

My friends and family (and myself) are gathering this evening (sorry, no 
house music just drums n' stuff) at Panther beach for the Equinox.  We 
would love it if some of you would join us!  It's all about food, 
community, campfire, and good vibes.  We'll be there from 7pm-11pm.  
Bring edibles and a warm heart  :)  

Bright Blessings 
Melissa

OK, we may not be able to hug without negative repercussions, but we CAN
relate with smiles, and bring the love that we feel into our professional
lives.  Try it, you'll like it!

Subject: Light Family Campout Directions 
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

This Friday Sept.22nd-24th is the Light Family Campout! We have a beautiful
location in the mountians about three and a half hours away from S.F.  Music 
will start Fri. night between 10-11pm and are encouraging everyone to try to
arrive before midnight.  Should you plan to attend you will need to bring
with you your own water supply for the weekend (there is no running water),
food, warm clothes for the night time, sunblock and shorts for the daytime.
The elevation is aroun 6600 ft. so star gazing should be quite spectacular.
The camp area itself lies on the peak area in what used to be one of the
main stagecoach roads durring the gold rush days.  We are encouraging the
ambient meditation    on Saturday evening for everyone with your guide
Darkhorse.  Please feel free to bring any type of creative exchange - books,
paints, beads, toys, games whatever!  This is an opportunity to make closer
friends and grow.  There will     be a locally guided hike to indian sacred
cliffs and to a creek for a swim! The final line up for Fri. night is Joe
Rice, Minor Minor, Phil Smart, James Dee, and Monte ambient morning with
Darkhorse.  Saturdays line up includes Ethan, John Carel, Ted, Rob Doten and
Ambient with Jason.  We will be asking for a seven dollar donation for the
weekend to cover the costs of transportation etc. Any extra profits will
benefit a local small (pop. 17) town called Forest that is working at
rebuilding their community in a ecologically safe manner! Directions are:
Take Hwy. 80 E (Reno) past Sacramento.  Just in Auburn EXIT HWY 49
Go LEFT on HWY 49. (there will be a bright orange arrow sign to guide you)
Go THRU Nevada City. Hwy 49 splits just past Nevada City so Make
a LEFT TURN to stay on 49. (there will also be a orange sign) From that turn
go up 49 for about 19 miles. You will make a RIGHT on RIDGE ROAD.      (look
for orange sign) Go up Ridge Road 18 miles. You will pass a fire station
then a school on your left. Yes, you are in the right place. You will be
making a left turn and an immediate right to stay on Ridge road. There are
signs so look for them !  From that little intersection go up four miles and
look for a left turn onto a dirt road.  There is a cattle shute on the
corner with signs!  Go Slowly down the dirt road for it creates lots of
dust!  There will be signs to guide you safely to camp and possibly someone
to greet you depending on when you arrive.  
 OK, that should get you there.  Please don't forget water, food , warm
clothes, your big smile, and a flashlight!!! See you soon! 
FEEL IT - LOVE      -Gateway Systems!

It went so well... that we've deciced to another one just cuz.  We're 
going to meet at Panther on Oct. 5th 7pm-?  For all of you folks who live 
to far from Santa Cruz, we would like to extend an invitation to pick you 
up at Cal Train, give you a place to crash, and then a ride back to 
CalTrain the next morning.  We had such a beautiful time out there that 
we HAVE to do it again!  Geography shouldn't hinder anybody.  Especially 
since we live so close to a CalTrain station.  We have lots of floor 
space :)  Mark your calendars, bring your instruments, get out those 
flashlights, and come play on the beach!

Hey Jon.  Obviously I lied about getting this to you over the weekend.  Why
does everything take longer than you plan?  Anyway here's a fairly lengthly
blurb about the picnic.  Would appreciate your passing it along to anyone you
think might be interested.  It's shaping up to be a pretty good show.  The
boys from Rebus say they will be showing some java on their pc's. Will look
forward to seeing you this weekend.  Lee

FOOD, FROLIC AND HI-TECH FUN
AT MARIN'S SECOND ANNUAL ELECTRONIC PICNIC

Novato CA, September 18, 1995 -- Showcasing the North Bay's hi-tech
superscene, Digital Village's upcoming Electronic Picnic will be an
exhilarating experience for kids, their parents and multimedia pros alike. 

Festivities kick-off Friday night, September 22, at 6:30 pm with a Blues
Bar-B-Q reception and concert at Digital Village, which is located at the
College of Marin's Indian Valley campus in Novato. To the world beat music of
the Bay Area's legendary Haunted by Waters, picnic goers will enjoy a hearty
spread followed by the presentation of industry achievement awards to
Autodesk for their pioneering work in creating internship opportunities for
young people, to MIDAS for launching Marin County's new community internet
connection, http://marin.org, and to Mickey Mantle of Broderbund Software for
his efforts towards bringing Marin into the digital world.  Michael Moon from
Gistics will be the digital impresario for the event.  More music will follow
the awards ceremony. Admission to the Blues Bar-B-Q is $10 with advance
reservations and $15 at the door.

The fun continues at the Village on Saturday, September 23 with a hi-tech
play day for adults and kids from 10 am to 5 pm.  Admission is free for
children under age 12 and $7 for everyone else.

Spanning the beautiful wooded campus, the displays and demonstrations offer
something for everyone.  At the Learning Pavilion in a large tent in the
center of the campus picnickers can play with the latest games and
edutainment CD ROMs from Broderbund, LucasArts, and other Bay Area developers
both large and small, and see demonstrations of multimedia tools. They can
also smoosh their faces at the "Rubber Faces" booth or disguise their voices
at the "Audio Funhouse," and enjoy a showcase of multimedia developed by
students ages 5 to 18.

On-line virtual worlds will beckon to picnic goers from inside the
Internet/VR center, where Autodesk's team of student interns will lead 3D
tours of Digital Village's proposed New Media Center. There will be stations
for surfing the Internet, shared online workspaces, and demonstrations of new
applications utilizing Sun's Hot Java and VRML.

Particularly mind-warping will be the premiere of a revolutionary technology
developed by Japan's NTT using graphics technology available from Sense 8
corporation in Mill Valley.  This cutting-edge technology creates a
multi-sensory, multi-participant environment which users can enter through a
video camera perched on their computers!

More games, exhibits, and displays can be found throughout the Miwok cluster,
where picnickers will also be able to attend a series of showcase
presentations and panel discussions with some of the industry's most
experienced players.  On-line consultant Hank Duderstadt will take visitors
on a guided tour of cyberspace, while innovators such as Michael Evans,
specialist in high-end graphics development at ActivEyes, and Sheila Walsh of
Sense 8, makers of the industry-standard World Tool Kit, will present videos
of virtual world magic.  

Executives from Mindscape, InSearch, LucasArts and Zen Systems will address
Careers in Multimedia.  Sherry Miller, creator of SherryArt.com, a WWW site
"where art and technology meet," will host a panel about women on-line,
including Women's Wire founder Nancy Rhine.  Elana Rosen from Just Think
Foundation will tackle the topic of Teaching Children Media Literacy.

The magic of 3D animation will be on display at an 11 am panel featuring the
work of four leading animators -- Trish Schutz from Industrial Light and
Magic ("Casper"), Hal Hickel and Colin Brady from Pixar ("Toy Story"), and
William Opdyke of Colossal Pictures, who will discuss their craft and the
latest developments in computer graphics/animation.  At 3pm Bob Hone from
Redhill Studios will make a special presentation of his award-winning kiosk
Seeing Time".

Picnickers are invited to bring a blanket, and take a break from the creative
storm with a picnic in the sunshine (food and drinks will be plentiful), and
enjoy more of that neo-pagan ethno-electro music from Haunted by Waters.

Sponsors for the event include Autodesk, Broderbund, Frank Howard Allen
Realtors, Bank of Marin, Bay Area Multimedia Partnership, North Bay
Multimedia Association, Softech, the Valis Group, Equilibriuim, Island
Graphics, Marin County Fair, Memory Chips, Marin County Office of Education,
New Media Learning Center, JAIMS, and All American Printing. 

Digital Village, established in 1994, offers classes in new media and is
developing a community of multimedia businesses, practitioners and students
who share creativity and resources. Profits from the Electronic Picnic will
go towards the development of a New Media Resource Center at Digital Village.

For more information or reservations contact Laurie Vermont or Lee Callister

First of all, thanks for all the enthusiastic requests for my tape, 
coming from as far as San Diego, Reno, and Vancouver (isn't this *SF* 
raves? ;).  I've been busy copying them, one by one, and cutting and pasting 
the insert and labeling.  This has been quite a project!

Anyway, there are lots of people who requested the tape who live in the 
SF area, so rather than sending them all, I've decided to leave a bunch 
of them for people to pick up in SF, either at Soundworks on Valencia, or 
at a flower shop on Church St. where my girlfriend works.  I should have 
the final details sometime in the next few days.  Stay tuned!

I do it, and let me tell you it makes work SO much more bearable.

Only one problem, if you're almost always smiling in greeting, if you 
forget for some reason they might think you're givin' them the cold

Maybe I'm being dense, but is this "gathering" going to happen
at Civic Center Park as well, or elsewhere? Do they have permits
and all that? I guess what with the bands playing, all that rave
music will just be more amplified sound.

Sounds good to me!

Thanks for posting this. One of these days, when i finish writing
this &^%$#@$* paper, I may see the light of day and rave once more!
Like next weekend!

Hello all,

Well It looks like tonight I'll be doing the non-ravish things. 

I have about a dozen new 12"s to listen to and my brother, Selector G, will
be spinning with his group 10 Bass-T @ the Edge along with Spearhead (I got
free in's, Nayh-nayh) =).

Hope y'all having a good time dancing up a storm, wherever you may be.  Do an
eXXtra spin for me.

In spirit & soul,

Adam

There's going to be a new moon party Saturday, on a beach about an hour 
north of the city.  Call (415)267-3076 for details.

We're still looking for someone to help get the generator up there! It's 
at my house (East Bay) right now.  It's medium-sized and will fit in a 
car, but for best results a hatchback/truck is preferred.  So if you're 
planning to go early, are willing and have extra space, please e-mail 
me or leave a message on the voice mail.

							thanks,

Howzit all y'all lovely people?!

     Name's Jason Sneed, aka chameleon...usually wearing a baseball cap 
with a white swirly-thingy on it or a black & white checkered 20's-style 
cap. Six foot, 24, Libra, Pro-caffeine.
     I was born and raised in the Bay 
Area, but ended up travelling a lot as a youngster (Pops works for the 
airlines)...
     I stumbled upon my first rave in London, although it took me a few 
years to figure out (oh, that's what that was!) I've since found that 
there is no other celebration ritual that inspires the same ancient bliss 
as the raves...
     I graduated from UC Davis with a BA: International Relations, World 
Resources and Environment...and immediately began a job inspecting ship 
cargoes in Bay Area Ports, 24 hours on-call via pager.  This ended up as 
a great way to experience the SF after-hours scene; i bought a laptop and 
started freelance writing at Coit Tower, watching the ships' movement 
through the Bay and waiting for pages.
     After six months of this, my brother (optik) and i left on a 
cross-country trip to explore nature, art and rave culture...equipped 
with laptop, national pager, 35 mm, internet account and tiki 
torches.  
Our friend james (eyeq) forwarded 'net-researched leads as we travelled; we 
accessed our account through local servers in cities across the nation. 
The friendships and experiences we had were so incredible that we're 
planning a second voyage, this time N/S from Santa Barbara to Vancouver.
     For now i'll be stickin' around in beloved San Francisco, developing 
Constant Synthesis Project, a new media publishing network based on 
contributions from artists and friends made during these excursions.  I 
would love to meet all the funky people on sfraves...i don't get too 
"social" at parties, because i -don't-stop-dan-cing- *8)...call me up and 
we'll get a cup!

take it easy

Seeing as I lived so close to the location of "Hijacked", I decided to take
a look at what was going there. It was located in San Francisco's China
Basic/Lower Potrero Hill at the end of 24th street, just past Illinois, at
a small park that looked at the bay. For those of you that are not
familiar, that neighborhood is very industrial, kinda scummy, and where
people live in their vans down by the water. (yes, I actually live about 4
blocks away at 20th Street.) There were a few of those 'vans down by the
water', and there were a bunch of young people hanging around, all sucking
on balloons full of nitrous. I think that they were waiting for the sound
system to show up. I stayed around for less then 5 minutes and left. The
'sound system' at that time was a boom box sitting on top of a pickup's
camper shell. This was around 2am, and I just figured that the real sound
system had not shown up yet. Around 4am, I figured that if there were a
party there, it would be in full swing. I hopped into my car and drove the
4 blocks back down there. Nothing left of a party but the people in their
vans and a pile of used balloons right where the pickup was parked that had
the nitrous tank.

 Hello SFRavers ....

 Due to work hassles , I won't be going to Greer Park in Palo Alto on
Tuesday for lunch anymore - so , no "SFRaves South Bay Lunch" for 
awhile. 

 However - I do have an idea to have a weekend lunch/dinner picnic at
this nice park near my in-laws place. It's got a nice meadow - we could
meet and plop our blankets on the ground. I'm going to contact the park 
service in charge of this park , and see if they will allow amplified
music. If so , I was thinking of an acid jazz/trip-hop/dub/ambient music
event . There are some residences nearby , so I don't think we could
do the techno/house/jungle thang without getting noise complaints called
on us.

 The meadow seems to have some nice shady spots near the trees , and 
there are picnic tables above the meadow with little BBQ pits. 

 The park would be about 1/2 hour south of SF. I was thinking of a 
Saturday in mid_November or afterwards . For those who are going to
school - when are your exams ? I will try to schedule after your exams,
if I know when they are.

 How many are interested?

hello all. i found myself upstairs at the acme gallery last saturday night for 
Space Children Days Between. this is a great gallery (667 Howard) which i 
recommend checking out during the day sometime. it currently has a graffiti 
exhibit going on, including some original prints of those pop-art rave style 
logos. anyhow, it was a great party, with a room of hard acid/jungle and a 
chill room. the music was great, the one bathroom-long line sucked, and there 
were a lot of too young kids with balloons...but it was a lot of fun...check 
out anything else by this group, and check the gallery too...

Subject: Ecstasy and Death
content-length: 8308
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

    My son, Morgan Jones, then a sophomore at UC Santa Cruz, died 
from the effects of Ecstasy (MDMA, MethyleneDioxyMethAmphethamine)
on April 1, 1995.  He had gone to a rave in San Francisco at which
he bought and ingested two Ecstasy tables (about half an hour apart), 
at about 4:30 a.m.  He began to feel sick at the rave, and then 
returned to the house of a friend in Marin County.  He lost
consciousness about 9:00 a.m. and was pronounced dead at Marin 
General Hospital at about 11:00 a.m.

    There are lessons to be learned from his death.

    You can die from a relatively low dose of Ecstasy.  There were 
two autopsies performed on Morgan, one by the Marin County Coroner, 
and one by a private pathologist.  The Marin County Coroner attributed 
Morgan's death to "cardiac dysrhythmia due to idiosyncratic drug 
reaction." The blood test commissioned by the Coroner found that 
there were 0.56 milligrams per liter of amphetamines in Morgan's blood, 
of which almost all (0.54 MG/L) was MDA and a very small amount 
(0.02 MG/L) was MDMA. The private pathologist attributed Morgan's 
death to "acute MDMA and alcohol intoxication." The blood test he 
commissioned found .58 MG/L of amphetamines, all judged to be MDMA, 
and .05 (units not given) of alcohol.  The blood test commissioned 
by the Coroner found no alcohol.

    There is a great deal of variation among individuals in the
level at which MDMA becomes toxic.  Steven B. Karch, in "The
Pathology of Drug Abuse," (CRC Press, 1993, p. 211) reports that 
"There appears to be tremendous overlap between recreational and 
toxic levels.  In seven patients who died of MDMA toxicity, blood 
levels ranged from from 110 ng/mL (.110 mg/L) to 1260 ng/mL (1.26 mg/L).
Levels in five patients who survived serious bouts of toxicity were
from 200 to 970 ng (from .200 to .970 mg/L), while levels in five
car-accident victims were from 50 to 340 ng/mL (.05 to .34 mg/L)." 
So one person's recreational dose can another's fatal dose.  There
is no way to find your own limit except to die.

    MDMA has adverse side effects short of death.  The full extent
of these is not yet known.  The San Jose Mercury News reported on
Sept. 5 that "U.S. researchers have found new evidence that the
rave-scene drug 'Ecstasy' could cause permanent brain damage 
leading to mood disturbances, a report in the New Scientist 
magazine said Thursday.  A team of scientists at Johns Hopkins
University in Baltimore, led by George Ricaurte, found that monkey
and rat cells damaged by Ecstasy regrow abnormally."

    You cannot and must not depend on biased information sites,
such as the Web site at hyperreal.com (http://hyperreal.com/
drugs/mdma/) for information about the risks of MDMA or of
other drugs.  The hyperreal.com site carries an incomplete
and unrepresentative set of scholarly (medical and pharmaceutical)
articles on MDMA and other drugs.  It does not carry, for 
example, Steven Karch's book cited above.  My son had had a 
prior bad experience with MDMA and was apparently worried
about it.  He sought information which from which he could
decide whether to continue to take MDMA. He read the articles 
at hyperreal.com and other Web sites (I have a record of the Web 
sites he logged in to) and from them got a false sense of security 
about his continued use of MDMA.  

    You should beware of immoderate or overly enthusiastic
claims for the benefits of drugs, and you should be particularly
skeptical of the claims of the MDMA promoters.  The most venal
of the latter, such as Fraser Clark, Bruce Eisner and Nicholas
Saunders seem to be keeping a low profile recently, but they or 
their ilk will return.  Ask what any proponent of MDMA stands 
to gain from his or her advocacy.

    You should try to be sophisticated and mature in looking
for the signs of addiction or dependence in yourselves and in
your friends.  One such sign, which I have seen far too much
of in the sfraves group, is an unwillingness to accept evidence 
about the risks of drugs.  Morgan subscribed to sfraves,
and when his mother and I went down to Santa Cruz to pick 
up his effects we found that there was waiting on his e-mail
account a truly nauseating collection of e-mails about his own 
death.  Their gist was either that the news was false, or that 
his death must have been an aberration due to some carelessness 
on his part.  It was neither.  He did die.  He was no more care-
less than tens of thousands of other young people who take MDMA
regularly.  He just died.  The drug killed him.

    Interest groups such as the rave group can become clannish
and self-congratulatory.  When that happens misinformation
is amplified and perpetuated.  Seek advice and guidance from 
people outside of your own group.  Get some feedback about what 
you are up to.  There are lots of old hippies around, many with 
their own interesting drug experiences from the 60s, who could tell 
you a thing or two.  Speak to your professor, physician or minister.  
Reach out and check things out.

    I am 51 years old.  I think that my generation has not done
well in teaching the next generation about drugs.  I think the
problem is that we are so worried about the dangers of drugs
that we speak untruthfully about the attractions of drugs.
We talk about drugs as if they were sinister, and as if whatever
attraction they had was inconsequential or flawed or unreal
or unimportant.  From my own personal experience with drugs
(alcohol, marijuana, nicotine, caffeine) it seems to me that the
truth is very different.  The appeal of drugs is not trivial,
sinister or insubstantial.  It is the exact opposite.  The
nicotine addict, for example, feels more centered, more true
to himself or herself, more like the real person, when smoking than
when not.  I am sure that this sort of feeling is true of many
other drugs:  you feel more spiritual with the drug than without;
you feel that you have found something about your deep inner
self that you previously did not know.

   The main message at the hyperreal MDMA site 
(http://hyperreal.com/drugs/mdma/), attributed to Brett 
(phase@grove.ufl.edu) describes this kind of attraction very well:

   "Ecstasy is not a 'happy drug'.  It by itself does not do anything.
    That 00 gelatin capsule you bought from this guy your good friend
    knows... with bitter crystalline power in the bottom of it... does
    not contain any warmth, joy, wisdom, or experience. It contains
    a salt of millions of rather simple organic molecules.  All
    identical.  The ecstasy and joy come from within YOU.  That is
    your natural, instinctive consciousness when you aren't
    poisoning yourself with fears, hangups, and stress.  It is a 
    glimpse of the true empathy, calm wisdom and energy you possess
    when you are living HERE, and NOW... not based on the past,
    future and fear.  MDMA is a chemical key to the paradise within
    each of us."

    I have not taken Ecstasy but from what I have read, including
a short story by Morgan, I don't doubt for a minute that Brett's
statement is accurate. 

    When young people discover for the first time this sort of
appeal in a recreational drug they feel that they have been tricked 
by their elders: the drug seems to have opened a door into a spiritual 
world, and no one told them this could be true!  Their elders are 
hypocritical to have hidden this.

    What I wish is that my generation could teach not how bad
drugs are but how GOOD they are; i.e., how deeply appealing they
are.  So that no young person would be surprised to find this out
for himself or herself from personal experience.  The truth will set 
you free.  And the truth about drugs is that they are to be avoided 
not because they are sinister, but because their attractions come 
with truly awful risks of death, injury, disability or other 
permanent suffering.

    I wish for each of you what is within your grasp: the chance 
for a long and productive and spiritually fulfilling life.  I hope 
that you will take some extra effort to be sure that you come to a 
well-informed, considerate and personal evaluation of just how (or 
whether) recreational drugs should fit into this life.

while since I've played with lasers, I decided to try Thunderground,
in all it's "ultimate rave experience" glory.  I was expecting 
commercialized inexperienced vibe and cheese and was ready for it,
and you know what, I had just a fabulous night.  The sound system was 
loud and not very good, but the visuals and the music were great.
There was some jungle and some fast trance.  The only person I saw there
that I recognized was Carlos who had relentless energy.  But it gave
Cathy and I a chance to see new faces, and watch some of these new young
kids who dance like a firestorm.  I don't think that I've danced quite
that hard and long since Freedom.  So, it was refreshing and wonderful.
It was a good reminder that there is the most awesome vibe at every single
party, you just have to let yourself be open enough to listen to it.  
It all begins and ends with you.

So, I wish everyone a week full of such a powerful vibe.

be seeing you,
-john.

   Firstly, I would like to say that there are many things in this 
post that I agree with, most notably the emphasis on getting 
information/education outside of one's social circle.
   From experience, I have noticed that groups tend, naturally,
to develop their own views and value systems, that have varying
degrees of similitude to or variance from the perceived societal norms.
It seems that these systems of meaning can become locked and self-referential,
when the flow of new information into the group's collective gets
thwarted for the sole reason of superficially not fitting in.
   I honestly have no idea whether or not the rave community has become
fixed in this way, but this post does remind me that such a danger
exists, and that being conscious of it would be the first step towards
avoiding problems. A specific example would be to not rely on
hyperreal.com for the last word regarding drug toxicity, something which,
we are apparently *already* doing, if I correctly remember the thread on E
from a few weeks ago, where outside sources on research *were* quoted. So 
I think that it would be in order to _again_ encourage every individual 
to do their _own_ personal research, especially around subjects as serious
as drug use.

Secondly, I think that it is ludicrous to use the problems associated 
with X as a marker for the general state of affairs on the safety/danger of 
drugs. To plug in the concepts put forth by Terence McKenna, many "natural" 
substances, which have been taken by indigenous people for 
centuries/millenia, have long track records of use; and we can thus
be fairly certain as to the relatively safety of some of these plants, 
especially  when they are consumed within the limits implied by the 
traditions in question. Again, individual research is in order. 
As for the recently created synthetics, we are faced with the choice of
either waiting for a full bio-chemical understanding of their actions and
toxicity on the body, or of using them now, and slowly building our own
"track record", and in so doing, also understanding, and taking
responsibility for the fact, that such usage is possibly very dangerous.

Dear Mr Jones,

I think I speak for all of those on the SFRaves list when I say that we are 
truly sorry to hear of your sons death.  I was not part of the list at the 
time the incident occurred, nor was I part of the rave scene here at the 
time, so you will understand that this is new to me and probably many others 
on the list.

There are a few points which I feel should be made in response to your 
posting.  You gave as a subject line "Ecstacy and Death", and I think 
perhaps this is incomplete.  The details which you supplied show a slightly 
different side to the story - Ecstacy and alcohol are a lethal mixture which 
should be avoided at all costs.

I started going to raves in London, England and in Dublin, Ireland, where 
alcohol use and abuse are commonplace.  A considerable number of deaths 
occur each year there from alcohol poisoning and from driving under the 
influence of this drug, although little media coverage is given to this fact 
due to its legal status.  It is considered reckless behaviour to drink to 
excess, and society sees it as the responsibility of each individual to 
ensure that they do not harm themselves by using alcohol.

There have also in the last ten years been a number of deaths related to 
ecstacy in Britain and Ireland - unfortunately I have no statistics 
available on precise numbers.  However, I recall from all of the news 
stories I read about these incidents, that a very large proportion of the 
deaths involved the simoultaneous use of alcohol.  I am not saying that all 
ecstacy related deaths involve alcohol, but at least a large proportion of 
them appear to.  Being a newcomer to the Northern California rave scene, I 
do not know if there are or have been any similar cases here.  If there are, 
then you will probably know what I am talking about.

My next point I think is very close to what you said about drugs being too 
good to persuade people not to use them;

We, the people, ain't stupid.  We know drugs are dangerous.  We know it's 
possible to get very seriously injured or killed by taking drugs.  We want 
to educate ourselves as much as is possible before deciding whether or not 
to take certain substances.  We openly welcome postings such as yours;  you 
remind us that we are walking a very fine line, and that it is our 
responsibility to ensure that we don't fall down.  We must be contantly 
aware that it is possible to make false assumptions based on inaccurate or 
incomplete information.

Western society generally accepts that alcohol is a fairly safe drug.  In 
some places, it gets such good press that it isn't classified as a drug at 
all.  The fact remains however that it is a drug, that it is responsible for 
many many deaths and that it must be treated with care.  I know from 
personal experience that (at home in Ireland at least) there is a high level 
of awareness that ecstacy and alcohol should never ever ever be mixed.  I 
tried to buy an E in a club in Dublin, I had a pint of Guinness in my hand 
and the dealer wouldn't give it to me.  No way, he said, lethal coctail, 
doesn't matter how much I offer, forget it.  Blood alcohol level must be 
0.000 ppm or he wasn't parting with the stuff.  Now _that_ was a caring 
dealer and I think only ecstacy helps you care like that.

There may not be such a high level of coctail toxicity awareness here.  If 
there isn't there certainly should be;  what you point out about different 
toxicity levels for different people is very true.  Just because you see 
someone on ecstacy with a beer in their hand dancing around doesn't mean 
that if you do the same thing you'll be safe.  It does mean that what they 
are doing is dangerous, and that if you do it too you're taking your life in 
your hands.  That's not to say that ecstacy on its own won't kill you 
either.  It might.  I don't know directly of any such cases.  If anyone does 
please let me know.  I wanna educate myself and those I care about.

There may be some small political point here that I would like to touch 
upon:  I feel, as do many other SFRavers, that use of ecstacy should be 
legalised, controlled and monitored.  I don't like big drug companies, but 
they do have very high quality control standards.  And I object to 
governments telling me that I shouldn't alter my mood or state of 
conciousness, based on decisions made by people who are not involved with 
the use of these drugs.  We are exploring a realm of human function that our 
leaders choose to ignore.  There is nothing morally wrong with wanting to 
temporarily change the way your brain functions.

Right, that's all I wanted to say.  I hope that the tragedy that occurred to 
Morgan and to your family is never repeated, I hope that open and frank 
discussion of the dangers of drug abuse helps people be aware of what they 
are doing when they do it, and finally I hope that the pain of the loss of 
Morgan eases with our sharing of your grief.

Again, my sincerest condolences,

Ivan Lamont    <ilamont@msn.com>

hi everybody!

sat night we had a new moon gathering out in bolinas at a beautiful house 
close to the ocean.  all night long you could hear the waves- even though 
the house was a ways from the shore.

J. and R. who live there were kind enough to extend their housewarming 
party into the night to allow those arriving late for the NM to spend 
some time in the company of friends and listen to some beautiful music.  
the house and surroundings are absolutely beautiful, and everyone that 
was there was affected by the grace and beauty J. and R. have created there.

all except for one person, a friend of mine, who went out of his head for 
a while and had to be comforted through the night.  

THIS IS A WARNING TO ALL OF YOU:  Some people REALLY DO have chemical 
imbalances in their brains and are even taking medicine for this.  If 
someone like that has a bad reaction to something, it's very possible 
that whatever that person gets when taken to an emergency room could make 
the problem worse, not better.  

My friend could have died.  The 
seriousness of what could have happened has completely transformed my 
feelings about recreational or instructional or spiritual use of 
you-know-what.

Anyway, I had thought I'd seen everything, and now I know that's not even 
close to being true.  

If someone "freaks out" on something YOU gave him...if that someone hurts 
himself- by smashing a window, stumbling around outdoors, etc.- then 
guess who that person's family and friends are going to come looking for 
after it's all over.  So please, please, please be careful and control 
what happens to what passes through your hands.

I wanted to share this with you in hopes it will avert some potential 
suffering.

Yours,

Anthrax

You have my deepest sympathies for the loss of your son.

Thank you for your message.   It was written in the spirit of caring, 
understanding human behavior, and wanting to share information instead of being 
self-righteous and preachy.   I think that approach is much more effective and 
I will heed your words.  

Unfortunately, the government needs to realize that there is this incredible 
appeal about drugs...they *feel* awesome and they're fun.  Cramming how bad 
they are down children's throats doesn't do a damn thing and, as you said, only 
makes them distrustful and angry they've been misinformed when they do try 
drugs.  Therefore...they rebel and sometimes engage in hazardous behavior.

I wish the government would just get over the fact that drugs are an inherent 
part of people's behavior used to enhance feelings, spiritual awareness, or 
used just for escape from the daily grind.  When will they wake up and stop 
denying that cultures, since the beginning of time, have used drugs as part of 
their religion, relaxation, medicinal, sexual practices, etc.  These drugs were 
regulated to the best of the culture's ability and they suffered very few, 
irresponsible deaths as a result.  *And*, because they were regulated and 
acceptable, it was socially *unacceptable* to abuse them or act in 
inappropriate ways when using them.  

However, as massive consumers of alcohol(for example), Americans have the worst 
fatality rate from alcohol related deaths due to disease, car accidents, 
domestic violence, gun wounds, beatings, stabbings, etc., than any other 
country; however, there are other countries that consume far more alcohol per 
capita than America, but...they don't have the alcohol related problems we do 
because, even though it is okay and even encouraged to drink, acting drunk or 
grossly irresponsible is simply *not* socially acceptable and as a result, 
penalties are very, very stiff and you become an outcast if you cross that 
line.  (This also brings up America's problem with community...we don't have 
one, so everybody acts autonomously and avoids judgement because they don't 
have a smaller social structure to govern their behavior)  In close knit 
communities and cultures, you didn't fuck up because *everybody* would find out 
and you'd be a complete outcast and banned from the group. 

Since when can they deny the use and pleasures of a drug such as MDMA (a drug 
that enhances feelings of love, peace and security *and* leaves most of your 
judgement entact) when they go on cranking out alcohol and tobacco!?, which are 
responsible for more horribly violent *and preventable* deaths than *any* other 
drug!!!  I think it's a travesty that even after *all* the proof that alcohol 
and cigarettes kill, it's still acceptable.  Alcohol, when abused, can often 
make people violent, angry, depressed and can lead to dangerous if not fatal 
behavior... yet the government doesn't want people on a drug that helps them 
feel happy, loving, peaceful, secure!?  Is it just me or does this logic seem 
incredibly flawed???   Granted, the ability to feel all those things resides in 
you already, but who cares if you have the ability to feel these things when 
the fact is, society is so hung up on *everything* that it would be virtually 
impossible to create and show those feelings au natural.  

My point is, if they would just educated and regulate, people could go on 
enjoying drugs (like they have since the beginning of time) *and* acting 
responsibly because the drugs would be safe and there would be support for 
using them appropriately.  Everything in moderation and under the right 
circumstances to foster positive drug use...because, let's face it folks, 
people are going to continue to use drugs *no matter what* so you might as well 
make them safe, educate about them and make sure that if abused, there will be 
serious repercussions.   I believe drugs are the vehicle not the destination, 
and when people lighten up, set some safe standards and establish what 
*exactly* these drugs do and how to take them safely, you will have more 
liberated minds, far less crime, a significantly reduced prison population, 
fewer unwanted babies, better medicine and a more socially responsible culture 
and a *whole* lot more money saved that the government can use towards 
education, health care, etc., etc.

I'm not talking about approval of all drugs...I don't approve of any drugs that 
cause proven, drastic negative behavioral changes with prolonged use, mainly, 
speed, coke, alcohol, also all being very physically or psychologically 
addictive.   It seems you can't make a blanket statement that some drugs should 
be approved and others not, however, they have done it with alcohol and 
cigarettes, not to mention the millions of prescription drugs they crank out by 
the truckloads...also some extremely addictive.  Where's the responsiblity and 
logic in that!!!???

Again, thank you for sharing.  If there is anything I can do, please let me 
know.

Peace, caring, responsiblity

Rikki

Hi - Larry Ching again ...

 I read the brochure I picked up at the park, and one of the last
restrictions printed on it says "No loud radios or amplified musical
instruments". I don't think we could get away with arguing to the
rangers about how amplified records and CDs aren't technically
speaking "amplified musical instruments" - it's the volume they
object to.

 So , how's about a drum circle? I can bring conga bells. I know some
of you folks on the list have an interest in unamplified live music -
so let's make the SFRaves Peninsula Picnic an acoustic picnic! 

 Since I won't be hustling around for a sound permit , generator , etc. ,
I guess I could change the date of the picninc for a Saturday in
October - either the 21st or the 28th. Please send me email to let
me know if either date is OK , or if one is better/worst than the
other.

 Larry Ching / larryc@netcom.com

PS - I understand that this park has a lot of hiking trails - it's 
actually mostly a wildlife reserve. So , you hiker might want to come 
early to do some exploring.

Certainly the exhortation to investigate and carefully consider how we tweak
the chemical soup that is our earthly manifestation is right-on!  Very good
idea to always be aware of how what we put inside alters the brew.  But to 
limit such consideration to those substances the FDA/DEA term "drugs" is a big
mistake; just as Peter suggests we consider the interests of the MDMA advocates,
we must consider the interests of the FDA/DEA, and the corporate/government
establishment in general.  The substances Peter mentions (nicotine, alcohol,
caffeine) seem to be far more likely to cause health problems than most
illegal substances.  In fact, many substances the FDA terms "foods" are more
dangerous than those they term "drugs".  So what is the difference between a
"food" and a "drug"?  I would suggest that public consumption of one better
serves the corporate/government agenda than consumption of the other.  Not an
original idea, of course, but one which bears repeating, IMO.

I must also say that I find the following excerpt particularly disturbing:

> you free.  And the truth about drugs is that they are to be avoided 
> not because they are sinister, but because their attractions come 
> with truly awful risks of death, injury, disability or other 
> permanent suffering.

Driving a car is FAR more likely to result in death, injury, disability or 
other permanent suffering than using almost any ingestible substance in a
careful, traditional way.  In fact, I have heard recently that car accidents
are the leading cause of death in the USA.  If we are to avoid things which 
subject us to these risks, doesn't it follow that we should all stop driving
cars?  Apparently we consider the benefits of driving a car to outweigh the
risks of gruesome death.  

Death is apparently a certainty.  As for me, I would much rather die in a state
of ecstasy than in a bloody mess at the side of the highway.

Almost every response to Peter has been "We're sorry for your loss, but
X isn't nearly as bad as ______(other legal drug)"

That should not be an argument for legalizing a drug.  Every thing should be
considered on it's own merits and drawbacks.

The risks of driving are managed by a government which sets
traffic laws, builds freeways, and employs police to manage
things.

When you drive, you have a pretty good idea of the tradeoffs
between the benefits of what you are getting and your risks.
You can regulate your speed; you can choose when to drive;
you can choose the route to take.

The risks from taking Ecstasy are unregulated and unmanaged
and uncontrolled.  The substance you buy could be anything.

You say:

   "Death is apparently a certainty.  As for me, I would 
    much rather die in a state of ecstasy than in a bloody 
    mess at the side of the highway."

This is a spurious choice.  You do not have to die either
way.  You can control your risks of dying on the highway,
and you can send your risks of dying "in a state of ecstasy" 
to zero by not ingesting the stuff.

You imply that there is a "careful and traditional way"
to take MDMA:

   "Driving a car is FAR more likely to result in death, 
    injury, disability or other permanent suffering than using 
    almost any ingestible substance in a careful, 
    traditional way."

The implications are similar to those of the people who 
responded initially to Morgan's death: that he must have
been somehow at fault for not being careful.

My point is that the truth is otherwise; that there is a
great deal of variation among individuals in the level at
which MDMA becomes toxic.  I would guess also that there is
a similar variation over time; the does which is okay for
you today may not be okay tomorrow.  There is no "careful
and traditioanl way" to take Ecstasy.

I imagine that you personally are very much at risk.  You 
use the arguments of an addict.

Dear Ivan:

   Thank you for your thoughtful reply.

   I appreciate that any particular type of behavior which is
known to increase the risks of Ecstasy, such as mixing it with
alcohol, should be avoided, and I think your warnings about this 
are useful.

   My point of view is different from yours, however.

   Three of the points you make are that (1) Western Society is
hypocritical for accepting the use of one dangerous drug, alcohol, 
while banning drugs that are perhaps intrinsically less noxious,
such as, perhaps, MDMA, and (2) that "I object to governments telling 
me that I shouldn't alter my mood or state of conciousness, based on 
decisions made by people who are not involved with the use of these 
drugs," and that (3) "I feel, as do many other SFRavers, that use 
of ecstacy should be legalised, controlled and monitored."

    I agree with all three points; I just don't see that they are
in any way tied to any single person's decision about whether or
not to take Ecstasy.

    We live, here and now, in a particular world and a particular 
nation in which Ecstasy is illegal and its manufacture and sale are 
uncontrolled and it is very dangerous.  We can be as mad as we want 
at the government; we can do whatever we can to change the laws, 
but none of this in any way compels anyone to ingest Ecstasy.

    I think it quite advisable to not ingest it.

Peter, I don't think anyone will deny the fact the ingesting
MDMA, as well as other substances, involves some element of
risk.  I think you'd agree that it what be useful to those
concerned to have some idea of the degree of risk.  MDMA has
been around for a while now, and has probably been injested
by millions over the past 10 years.  I'd be curious to know
of any statistics on documented cases of deaths due to MDMA
toxicity.  I've heard numbers on other drugs like heroin,
tobacco, etc. but never on MDMA.  What happened to Morgan is
a tragedy, and should be taken as a wakeup call to casual users.
Are lot's of kids dying of this stuff?  Or just a handful of
isolated cases?  Any idea where such information might exist?

Dear Rikki:

   Thank you for your thoughtful reply.  I agree with most of
what you say.

   I think, however, that we are perhaps a little further on in
handling alcohol and tobacco use responsibly that you say.

   They are both still legal.  We have reached a state, however,
at which most smokers and many alcohol users are apologetic for
their use of the drugs.  Alcohol and tobacco use are no longer
seen as things that attractive and hip people do.  You sneak your
smoke out on the balcony, and you watch your drinks and apologize
for them. 

   I think this attitude is healthy.  It is a step along the path
to treating drug use responsibly.

   I wonder if MDMA users are as apologetic about their use of 
their drug as smokers are.  I don't know if they are, but from what
I have hear on sfraves I doubt that they are.

   I think they should be.

I don't know the answers, but I know a research strategy.
This is what I would do if I had the time.

I would start with two sources, "The Pathology of Drug Abuse,"
by Steven B. Karch, CRC Press, 1993, and the bibliography, by
Alexander Shulgin, to Nicholas Saunders' "E is for Ecstasy."
(The latter is on-line at hyperreal.com.) I would note which 
journals are cited frequently in these two bibliographies ("JAMA 
(Journal of the American Medical Association) is one; there are 
also citations of "Nature" and "Science") and I would then look 
at the 1994 and 1995 volumes of these journals, perhaps in the 
library of UCSF.

I looked over Shulgin's bibliography to Saunders' book this
morning.  It is extensive.  He (Shulgin) puts his own spin on
his comments to the references, however.  Whenever there is 
any uncertainty about whether Ecstasy or a second source of
some kind caused a death he tends to side with the second source.

There is a difference between drug use and drug abuse. It is a sometimes 
thin line for some people, but it does exist.

Had a great time at Elevation this weekend.  Many thanks and props to Philip
and Steve for organizing this event.  Hello to the sfravers I met...uh
Purple Tiger...and atleast two others whom ofcourse I can't remember thier
names....and I thought I was getting better at this name stuff....sorry, I
don't mean to offend.  I played ambient Sunday morning after most people
were in thier tents sleeping, but I'm sure I got to tweak a few dreams.
Many thanks to the ones who stayed up.   Oh ya, the only thing that sucked
was that we had to carry everything down a big hill to get to the spot, and
then ofcourse back up after all was done.  I am continuously amazed at how
heavy records are!!!   Hopefully Amy S. will post a full review...she's good
at that.  See ya.

There are those who will argue that this sort of attitude is not so
healthy.  Responsible use is just that.  No amount of guilt, shame,
sneaking or apologizing is going to make it more responsible.

To sfravers. $2 admission tonight if you mention sfraves. Free vegetarian

to bring down music they would play to their friends on a hazy Sunday
morning after a mad night, they are requested not to play anything that is
in their sets at that time insuring different and diverse music each week.
All monnies taken on the door is evenly distributed amongst everyone who
works at TGC, so door people earn the same as a DJ.
Thanks for use of sfraves as a communication mediam for spreading the word.

Are you suggesting we don't need to question the motives/agenda of the

I think relying on authoritarian regulation and management for my own
safety is often more risky than making my own evaluation, largely because
the agenda of the authority is often inconsistent with my own.  The
"substance" one buys, whether at the pharmacy or a club, can always be
"anything", just as there can always be "anything" around the corner when
you're driving, regardless of the existence of police and traffic
legislation.

Taking the position that authority/regulation is the only valid source of
information is participating in your own disempowerment, as well as
undermining human community, which is how people must have decided what was
safe and worthwhile before the wonderful FDA existed.  We actually *can*
make good decisions collectively, because we are intelligent, because we
love each other, because we pay attention.

My point is that you *do* have to die *some* way.  I have thought about
death a lot this past year, as my father caused his own death last October,
and I doubt that the best way to die is on life support, or on an expensive
pharmaceutical habit, although I'm sure the medical establishment would
like me to believe this.

This is no different from allergic reactions; some people fall down dead
the first time they eat peanut butter, some people who have eaten meat all
their lives unexpectedly eat a poisoned bit and expire.  I don't see how
Ecstasy is any different from eating or drinking or driving.  In fact,
there is a lot of literature explaining safe and productive ways to use all
sorts of substances, many of which, although currently illegal, have been
used traditionally and ritually for millennia, with very positive,
empowering, community-building, imagination-expanding effects.

>I imagine that you personally are very much at risk.  You
>use the arguments of an addict.

In what sense am I using the arguments of an addict?  I am not an addict,
but I am certainly very much at risk, and know this full well.  We are all
very much at risk all the time.  If I were to stay at home and take Ecstasy
while you take a drive in your car, I would be less likely to suffer harm
than you.  This is not speculation, this is based on statistics.  There are
some things which are good enough to risk harm, perhaps including driving a
car, perhaps including eating at a restaurant, perhaps including realizing
how absolutely wonderful people are, how fabulous community is, how easy it
is to love when the fear and inhibition is gone.

I am also very sorry for the loss of your son.  I know what this sort of
loss feels like.  But I hope you can sense how much we all care about each
other from reading this list, and I hope you come to one of our parties
sometime and feel it for yourself.  There is so much love here.

i smoke, and i am not apolegetic about it.  but i also work out everyday,
and bike, and take care of my body.  who is better off, the one who does
not smoke and sits at a desk all day, or the one who smokes yet gets a
healthy dose of fresh air ?  it's wrong to say that people who smoke be
apologetic about it. it's a blanket statement.  it does not apply to me.

in a like vein, people who do X should not have to be apologetic either.
X is illegal, but for political reasons unrelated to its safety.  sure, 
if govt legalized it, and it was thus controlled, there would be a safer 
environment to consume it.  the govt spends millions on preventing drug
abuse, through stong arm tactics, when the number of poeple who have 
died from illegal drugs pales next to numbers (hundreds of thousands)
who die from legal drugs.  

so, should users of X and other illegal drugs stop because the govt
has made a decision as to what is 'ok' to do, and what is'not ok' ?

the responsible thing to do is to legalize it.  that is where concerted
effort should go.  until then, i accept the risk associated with illegal
use.

Hey, thanks Rick!  Here I go!

Melanie and I got there rather early, but since this is a campout as well 
as a rave, we wanted to be there rather early, so we finally got there 
around 9.  It was so incredibly dark - no moon out, and thank goodness we 
had the sense to bring flashlights.  I didn't bring a tent because at 
Burning Man we danced til the sun rose and then just slept on a lounge 
chair in the sun. 

It got ***COLD***!!!  There were a couple of fires going, but not near 
the dance area, so it was pretty much deserted. Everyone was hanging out 
at the firepit. 

Carlos Campos was spinning when we got there.  He played some pretty good 
stuff, and then Rigatony came on.  He was good, played good stuff, but 
didn't really create a mood, he kept playing all different kinds of stuff 
and I was ready to be put into a mood... Then Flash came on and he played 
some really really trippy trance.  I didn't care how cold it was, I was 
transfixed by his entire set.  I was the only one dancing for the longest 
time - I don't know if it is cuz people don't like trippy weird trance 
like me or if it was too cold!  Then my friend Ted had the awesome idea 
of building a firepit in the middle of the dance area!  Duh, why didn't 
someone think of that before?!?  And we had a fire going around 3 am when 
my friend Jeff (aka Frog) came on with his drum machine.  He really got 
the crowd *together* when he played that song, "make love, listen to the 
music, you got to let yourself go go go go". It was so neat dancing 
around a big campfire.  Then Gavin went on.  Boy is he good!  Be sure to 
check him out if you ever get a chance to. People then started this 
squaredance like thing going - we were literally dancing with everybody!! 
It was great.  The vibe was just fantastic!  After Gavin was Steve who 
started bringing the energy down and more mellow - the sun was beginning 
to rise and people were going to bed.  I was exhausted, but still wide 
awake so I sat and watched the fire.  Then Rick came on and soon after he 
started, I really wanted to lie down.  So I went to my lounge chair and 
really tripped out on Rick's set.  It was awesome! I really like that 
kind of ambient....

Got to meet 2 new sfravers:  Jim Cyr and Mike (I forgot your last name, 
hon -I'm sorry!!)  Saw Purple Tiger and his friend, Fred.  I had such a 
wonderful time and we left around 4 pm.  Alot of people left on Sunday 
morning, so not that many people were there to experience the music on 
Sunday.  It was mostly mellow very relaxing kick back and socialize kind 
of day.  Couldn't have been better!

love,
Amy

Seeing I wasnt going to get to the mountains last Sat. night for either
Elevation or Light, I choose Days Between...  (I decided that instead of
stewing in my ouwn juices @ home Id rater do it somewhere else).

I guess my heart wasn't in it since most of my extended family  was havin a
fun ole time camping and dancing in the woods. So I believe any review of
Days would be an injustice.  The music was good, however, the dancing medium
was a wooden floor which would make the records skip if everyone jumped
around too much...
The venue initself was a fire marshalls nightmare.  Many a times I was
waiting for some movement b-4 I could get from one side of the dancefloor to
the other... 

But all-in-all I had an Okayish time....

C-ya'll Friday,

Adam

Where do you get this statistic?  Are you citing researchable facts or is this 
just your opinion or experience?  And how many people are doing X as compared 
to those drinking alcohol and how many of those people are acting unsafely 
compared to those acting unsafely on alcohol?  This is a guess, but without 
facts, I'd say a tiny fraction.  Perhaps they are both inhibition removers (I 
don't believe for a second that X impairs your judgement like alcohol or most 
other drugs for that matter)but alcohol is in a completely different class as 
far as consumption, availability, price, social acceptance (don't forget folks, 
we live in a very enlightened, liberal area.   Most people think alcohol is 
just dandy still and it's perfectly acceptable to get smashed.  Go to any 
college campus or anywhere in the south, mid-west or east coast.  In Texas, 
they still have drive thru mixed drink stands!) therefore, you can't compare 
the two at least as far as *numbers* go.

I'd say this guy you mention is a major asshole but shouldn't represent the 
entire X culture.  With every thing that makes us feel good, there are going to 
be people who abuse it, whether it's drugs or not.  You might as well 
illegalize sex...it certainly is dangerous behavior.  All behavior is dangerous 
when we don't know how to practice it responsibly.

I can't say I've been naive enough to think I'm *in love* with someone just 
because I was on a drug that made me feel loving.  I believe that it opens the 
doors for relationships and friendships that you might not otherwise encounter 
*because* you are on X and you *do* open up.   I have met some incredibly 
awesome people that I wouldn't have met otherwise.  I do wake up thinking, 
"Wow, I'm so glad I met that person, I hope I see them again".   Of course, not 
every experience has been a positive one, but every time you do something you 
enjoy, does it always turn out positive?  Are you never let down?  But with 
anything, you should focus on the good.  There is lots of good that comes out 
of these experiences too.  If you're not having any positive experiences when 
everybody else is, maybe that's a problem with the person.  

I think that the people that are engaging in unsafe behavior would be as likely 
to engage in unsafe behavior no matter if or what kinds of drugs they were on, 
because they aren't educated and don't know the risks they are taking.   Are 
you saying we should keep it illegal, unsafe and unregulated because it can 
lead to unsafe sexual behavior?   Boy, I'd think they'd whip alcohol right off 
the shelves in that case.

A regular gold mine of amusing stuff today!! :)

Overheard on the CBC radio morning show ... A man in England attempted to
rob a grocery store.  He ran up to the cashier with a gun, but before he
could get a word out, he was roundly scolded by the people in line for
budging and told to wait his turn.  He was so unnerved by this that he
wandered off and was arrested two blocks later.

>From "The Mother Tongue - English and How It Got That Way" ....

The Pentagon's Department of Food Procurement specifications for a
"regulation Type 2 sandwich cookie":  'The cookie shall consist of two
round cakes with a layer of filling between them.  The weight of the cookie
shall be not less than 21.5 grams and filling weight not less than 6.4
grams.  The base cakes shall be uniformly baked wil a colour ranging from
not lighter than chip 27885 or darker than chip 13711 ... the color
comparisons shall be made under north sky daylight with the objects held in
such a way as to avoid spectacular refractance.'

Computer rendering of "Out of sight, out of mind" - "blind insanity".

In a Russian/English phrasebook, this instruction for ordering in a
restaurant:  "Please give me curds, sower cream, fried chicks, pulled bread
and one jellyfish."

On a bag in Japan:  "Elephant family are happy with us.  Their humming
makes us feel happy."

On a sign in the Europa Hotel in Sarajevo:  "Guests should announce the
abandonment of theirs rooms before 12 o'clock, emptying the room at the

I'd say this guy you mention is a major asshole but shouldn't represent the
entire X culture.

Aside from the obvious in this quote, a reference such as 
 "x culture" sounds REALLY bad.  Perhaps it was an oversight.  But any
"group" whose identity is based upon a drug, really has it's priorities out
of whack, IMO.   It seems that lately, on this list, there's been an awful
lot of flag-waving and glorification of X.   If that's someone's prerogative,
so be it.   I wonder though, why there isn't more discussion about music,
which, one would think, would be the focus.  What all of this sounds like, to
me, is people missing a "certain something" in their lives, and embracing a
"culture" (drug) as the cure for what ails them.  It's really quite sad, how
"raving"  basically equates to "drugs" in the minds of so many people,
outside of, and especially within the scene.    

Put that in your pipe and smoke it.    Tom

Subject: Which party this weekend?
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

     Can anybody give me some advice as to what party I should go to this
weekend?  I'm not from around the SF area but I moved out a few weeks ago,
and I'm bored out of my skull.  I'm living in Santa Cruz, and directions
would help (not necesarry though). prefer partys with a nice sense of
community, but I can deal with massives too (maybe even Cyberfest 2).  If
anybody could help out, I'd be much obliged, if a ride is needed I'd be happy
to supply it.  Thanx in advance ;'D 
                                                                    -Wurzle

Niels and Rikki were talking about unsafe sexual practices and falling in 
love on E.  I used to be totally ani-drug because of the fact that I am 
not "me" while under the influence.  So if anyone becomes very 
affectionate with me during his e trip, I take it with a major grain of 
salt and see if he acts the same way when I see that person sober. 
I'm always very careful about what I say and do while under the influence 
as well, because I still want to be true to myself and anyone who happens 
to be around me at the time.  To do otherwise is lying.  My 2 cents for 
the day....

love,
Amy

For some reason, Rikki decided it would be cool to forward my private
mail to her onto the list. I don't think that's very cool myself.

Please disregard her/my message -- had I wanted it on the list, i'd have
cc'd it myself, thank you very much.

Hmmm...maybe about 60 people or so...I'm really bad at guestimating 
numbers of people. Rick? what do you say?

It was VERY dusty.  Burning Man felt CLEAN compared to all this dust!:)

        for me at least, the feelings of love that one has are as genuine
as anything else, being that everything is relative. I think that these
feelings of love well up in you as, simultaneously, you realize the real
joy of being ALIVE and not running around SURVIVING. There is a difference.
So when you are alive and in the moment of now-existance and you look into
someone else's eyes and you see yourself reflected and realize that nothing
is ever going to be the same again and that this person in front of you,
though you may not even know their first name, never mind their last, is a
part of you, on the quantum level and that the distance between your heart
and theirs is almost totally constructed by social conditioning and walls
that we all build up in a world that is full of pain and that distance
between your heart and their's is bridged just for a second, past the
arbitrary, constructed walls and we all realize that we are all one,
underneath everything...we're all just reflections of each other...facets
on the same jewel...seeing everyone's deep essential complex-beauty,
everyone has it, it's just some bury it a bit more than others...
        oops...that was a bit mushy, wasn't it? hee hee ;)
        what i'm trying to say is that these are my feelings, other people
filter their experiences according to their own personalities, and for some
that means sex with strangers (which i have no problem with if it's
consensual and safe and there are no power games) and for others it's a
brief drug-induced feeling that passes and then we go back to real life.  I
guess i, like rikki, see x as a small additional factor that is added to
the experiential equation that allows for things to manifest themselves
that were always there. MDMA is a drug that gives you feelings of a state
of mind called ecstasy, and ecstasy is the contemplation of wholeness.
Wholeness of self, and wholeness of the self's place in the world. This
state of mind is not necessarily acheived SOLELY through the use of MDMA,
too. :)

        peace,
                brad

i don't know...i guess what we're talking about here is what is that
ambiguous, flowing, inarticulable feeling that we have to stuff into the
little word-box named 'love' in order to be able to communicate that
feeling with others. I mean, what is 'love' anyways? the appreciation of
beauty? well, what does 'beauty' mean?

      The new film "THE HEMP REVOLUTION" will be playing at the
      locations listed below.


     *******************************************************************
                                 NOTICE
     *******************************************************************
     
     The most comprehensive and informative film about hemp ever
     produced has just debuted in America.  This 72-minute film
     titled "The Hemp Revolution" covers all aspects of hemp and
     cannabis--the enormous environmental and economic potential of
     hemp, the failed drug war, medical marijuana, the history
     of hemp, the reason marijuana was made illegal, and more.

     The potential of this film to attract media attention, inform
     the public, and generate pro-hemp activism is enormous.
     Currently, only 2 copies of this film are on tour.  In order
     to get this film played in theaters throughout the U.S. and
     Canada, approximately 10 more films need to be purchased at
     $1,000 per film.

     To raise money to purchase more copies of this film, the
     producer and director (Anthony Clarke) is seeking $100
     donations.  For a $100 donation you will receive your own VHS
     videotape copy of "The Hemp Revolution."  Not only will you
     get your own copy of this superb film, you will do more to
     educate the masses about cannabis/hemp (therefore building
     support for legalization) than anything else you could do
     for $100.

     Many of us think nothing of spending $100 for a bag of cannabis.
     Please consider redirecting that next hundred bucks to do
     something for the cannabis/hemp movement.
     
     Thanks for your time--end of sales pitch.

While your statement may or may not reflect reality, if you knew anything 
about netiquette you would know that posting someones' personal response 
to a public newsgroup/listserv is in very poor taste. Before slamming 
someone, try learning some (net) manners.

Yeah, you're missing something alright. It's called netiquette. As in
it is not socially acceptable to publicly post someone's private mail
to a public forum without asking. 

As far as things go between Rikki and I, we've worked things out
amicably, apologies have been made and accepted, and enlightenment, not
stupid bitchy sniping has ensued.

Perhaps i'll forward some private e-mail you wrote to me, just so  we
can find out whether you'd feel violated? THen you can proudly show us
the size of the stick you've got shoved up your ass.

I guess since we disagree on lots of things, it's time to let loose
with the ad-hominem attacks -- a sure sign that you've reached your
limits in terms of coming up with a cogent reply.

	Does anyone have the inside scoop on special goings-on this 
weekend?  It's my birthday, so I'm looking fer something really 
memorable.  
	I think it's safe to assume that CyberfestII won't fit the bill...

I'm getting to the part where I'm checking out all the rave related sites.
Thanx to those that want to be listed.   If I missed YOUR site,  it was
because you didn't respond to my initial query,  which I assumed you weren't
interested in getting a link.   I have many others which I've collected,
like John S. Lee's site,  and a few others.   So,  if you haven't responded,
please do so.    I haven't checked all of them out yet,   and won't put
them up until I've checked each one out.

So far,   I've got the following.   Please check the caption I've
written,  to make sure I've represented you correctly.

I'm getting an amazing number of hits to my site,  as indicated by the
counter,  and mostly coming from word of mouth from alt.rave,  alt.hackers,
and alt.2600 readers.   The databases have yet to add my site,   but I put
it up on all of them.

eh, adder -
"anything with the word "cyber" is suspect at best"
what about the F8 "all cybertrance" format?
aren't we cool enough for you?  :)
oh, the persecution, the typecasting, the moronity, the utter justice of it
all!

i actually hate labels - but, i'd rather call what we're playing
"cybertrance"" than what the British Press (DJ Magazine) recently "named" it
- a cover story in the late August issue calling "it" - Nu Energy - ug.

that, however, still doesn't solve the "what to do" (other than sunset)
problem for this weekend - does anyone know of anything - them dancin' shoes
are really rarin to go!

I have just heard from someone at their record company that they will be 
performing in SF on October 22nd. I thought their debut SF performance as 
the Dust Bros. earlier this year at the Troc was pretty incredible, 
though by the time they went on I was ready to hit the sack.

 The Saturday before the Halloween weekend will be
the date for the SFRaves Peninsula Picnic - Saturday, October 21st.
I will be there early to reserve a nice , tree shaded little
valley of a picnic site with three big tables and water and
a small barbecue pit. A nearby dry streambed should make
a great place for a drum circle!

 More details ( directions, etc. ) the week of the picnic.

 Larry Ching / larryc@netcom.com 

PS - Please email me so's I can get an idea of how many folks
will be showing up. It will be in a park about 1/2 hour drive time
south of S.F. No pets or dogs allowed , but children and horses
are allowed .

Well, see, I didn't make a blanket statement like I could have, because 
of the few cool people that still choose to use that much-abused word in 
reference to themselves. You don't call yourselves "Cyberfrequency-8" so 
it's ok in my book. :)

Yup, sounds like a stinker.

Well, Nu Energy is not what F8 plays, that's for sure.  It's more in the
JX/Blu Peter realm of things, really fast Eurohouse, fairly cheezee.
It's kind of a stupid name for a style, but people need handles for things
and I guess this is one.

I saw another new style name yesterday in an interesting story in the
Seattle Post-Intelligencer about a DJ who's playing "bhangle" -- that's
a new combination of bhangra and jungle which is popular in the Indian/
Pakistani cultural areas of London . . .

Labels, labels, labels . . .

Rikki, Neils and Brad were saying:

"I believe that it opens the
>doors for relationships and friendships that you might not otherwise
encounter
>*because* you are on X and you *do* open up."

"the distance between your heart and theirs is almost totally constructed by
social conditioning and walls that we all build up in a world that is full of
pain and that distance between your heart and their's is bridged just for a
second, past the arbitrary, constructed walls and we all realize that we are
all one, underneath everything...we're all just reflections of each
other...facets on the same jewel...seeing everyone's deep essential
complex-beauty, everyone has it, it's just some bury it a bit more than
others..."

Both are true in my experience.  The problems usually occur later when the
social conditioning, ego and psychic walls come crashing back in.  You may
find that you are frighteningly un-compatilbe in normal reality.  Veterans
can extricate themselves gracefully and kindly to an appropriate intimacy
level.  I have known more than one couple though, that was dependent on the
ecstatic mind state to keep from killing each other.  Having said that, I
wouldn't trade some of my stranger shared intimacies for anything because of
the insight into the beauty and diversity of humanity they have given me that
I would have otherwise missed looking for something more familiar/compatible.
And the communication/feeling skills I've had to learn to step back from too
deep of one of those special ecstatic intimacies in a way that leaves
everyone happy and hopefully truly new friends have made me such a better
person in my "normal" life.

I'd give Out of Sight on friday night a shot. Yeah, it's an all ages show, 
but their strenght lies in providing a solid line up in the city at a poverty 
jet set price (($8-10...at least that's their track record so far)). Then 
stick around for the free Gathering saturday afternoon. Should make for a 
good weekend.

head count : 2
conditions : clear and sunny

:(

me and sea of sin forgot our badges and my boombox so there were not too 
many overt signs.  but we did look dreggy and ravy !  and a little black
bird sat near us and bopped around like he was raving.

i put a bag on my head with 'sfraves' written on, and upon leaving the
park, circled about saying things like 'rave', 'techno', 'wack house 
music', 'jungle' really really loud.  

we did talk to 3 of the organic crew about raves, them having never been
to one, and they all excited and rearing to go !  

see you all out there in force next week !  whup whup !

While your statement may or may not reflect reality, if you knew anything 
about netiquette you would know that posting someones' personal response 
to a public newsgroup/listserv is in very poor taste. Before slamming 
someone, try learning some (net) manners.

I'm getting to the part where I'm checking out all the rave related sites.
Thanx to those that want to be listed.   If I missed YOUR site,  it was
because you didn't respond to my initial query,  which I assumed you weren't
interested in getting a link.   I have many others which I've collected,
like John S. Lee's site,  and a few others.   So,  if you haven't responded,
please do so.    I haven't checked all of them out yet,   and won't put
them up until I've checked each one out.

So far,   I've got the following.   Please check the caption I've
written,  to make sure I've represented you correctly.

I'm getting an amazing number of hits to my site,  as indicated by the
counter,  and mostly coming from word of mouth from alt.rave,  alt.hackers,
and alt.2600 readers.   The databases have yet to add my site,   but I put
it up on all of them.

Yeah, you're missing something alright. It's called netiquette. As in
it is not socially acceptable to publicly post someone's private mail
to a public forum without asking. 

As far as things go between Rikki and I, we've worked things out
amicably, apologies have been made and accepted, and enlightenment, not
stupid bitchy sniping has ensued.

Perhaps i'll forward some private e-mail you wrote to me, just so  we
can find out whether you'd feel violated? THen you can proudly show us
the size of the stick you've got shoved up your ass.

I guess since we disagree on lots of things, it's time to let loose
with the ad-hominem attacks -- a sure sign that you've reached your
limits in terms of coming up with a cogent reply.

	Does anyone have the inside scoop on special goings-on this 
weekend?  It's my birthday, so I'm looking fer something really 
memorable.  
	I think it's safe to assume that CyberfestII won't fit the bill...

Dear everyone,

A recent experience with a friend who had an unusually strong and 
dangerous "trip" on just half a hit of LSD knocked a little sense into 
me.  I'm still reeling from it, by the way.

I was so cavalier.  I thought there were no surprises left where things 
like Ecstasy, LSD, etc., were concerned.  Now I see how ignorant I am.  
How ignorant most people are.

But I can _imagine_ how I would feel if I sold, gave or led someone  to 
something that made them sick, that made them crack up or made them die.

If you see me at a party, please don't ask me if I know where to get you 
whatever.  Because even if I do, I won't want to tell you.  That person- 
however amiable- who wants to sell you something just wants to make a 
buck.  If only just to pay for his own trip.  

I'm not going to risk my peace of mind so that you can get high for a 
night and so that so-and-so can pay off the  new paint job for his car.  
Fuck that.  

Because if something were to happen to you, I would _never_ forgive 
myself.  Maybe most of the people who read this list are young enough 
that they have never done anything they are deeply ashamed of.  But I'm 
not, I have, and -believe me- it's not fun.

My friend could have ended up in the emergency room.  The ER personnel 
might have given him something to calm him down that could have induced a 
"cardiac dysrhymthia due to idiosyncratic drug reaction" - like what 
happened to Peter Jones' son Morgan- in combination with the LSD and 
whatever other crap was in there with it.

"Idiosyncratic drug reaction."  There you have it.  It may be rare.  But 
it's there.  And we had better not let anyone on this list forget about it.

There are folks reading this right now who are just getting into 
"raving."  They like the music, they like to dance, they like the 
openness and the love, they feel at home.  We older "list people" MUST 
make it our responsibility to remind kids -and eachother- that 
recreational drugs are dangerous and that they can fuck you up.  And 
here's how.  Spell it out.  Tell us stories about what you've seen.  
Maybe they'll think we're just being tiresome...but at least we will have 
discharged our responsibility.

Think about it.  If you knew someone who was having unprotected sex, 
wouldn't you say something to them?  If you knew someone who was abusing 
drugs, shouldn't you say something then as well?  

On that note, I'll say "bye"

Hello Everybody!,
    I was wondering who, (if anyone), was going to the Renn. Faire this 
weekend. Alot of us were planning to go up on Sunday. From what I have 
heard this is supposed to be the last weekend. I have no idea if that 
is true or not, but we are planning to go anyways. Well, I hope to see 
some of you there, but if I don't have a killer weekend!!! (I can't 
wait for Friday!) (It's been a lllloooonnnnnngggg week!) Take care :)

Yep, it all works just fine and dandy for us. Here are some of the things 
that work best for me, personally: 

*Earning 60 cents to a man's dollar
*Sexual harrassment on the job
*Sexual harrassment on the streets
*Fear of rape
*Domestic violence
*Lack of political clout and power

And here are some of the things that I think "work" worldwide:

*Female infantcide

Have they? Based in China's well-documented human rights abuses, including 
female infantcide, persecutation of gays and lesbians, oppression of the 
Tibetan people, forced sterilizations, I don't think it enjoys such high 
status in the eyes of the world. Are you implying that China's repressive

To Greg and any others going to Faire.

YES, this is the last weekend, probably forever at the Novato location, it
is an incredibly beautiful spot and you owe it to yourselves to visit the
Faire at this location. Secondly, I will be working there both days, as I
have most weekends, except B-Man :)  So look for me (I will even have some
SFRaves laminates for those of you who haven't gotten one yet). My schedule
for the day starts at the front gate before opening, approx 9:30 for the
little dialog that gets everyone in the mood before the gate opens at
10:00. I will be running around with the Fools guild, you know the silly
ones with the funky hats !!!  After 10:30 or so, I head to the morgue to
put on my bones and then do 2 parades with the Danse Macabre. The first one
is at 11:00 and goes from the Center of the Universe, tword the front gate
(not quite all the way to the front though), and then return to the Center.
The 2nd parade is at 1:00 and goes from the Center of the Universe all the
way up the the end of the world and back. Then you can find me being silly
again as the fools lead the Queens Progress heading up to the Main Stage.
We dance and frolic up on stage for the Queens Show, this happens around
3:00. After 4:00 I may be at the Wild Soles shoe booth, or just out being
Silly. Oh yeah, when I'm dead, I'm also about 8' tall, as I do the parades
on stilts, I may be a tall fool also, but I'm not sure, sometime I do,
sometimes I don't, it depends on my legs. (ouch)

So hows that for a lenghty post....  I hope to see some of you SFRavers out
there, I know Annie Stansfield <amstansfield@ucdavis.edu> will be there on
Sat., A good bet if you want to find me is to ask them at the Wild Soles
shoe booth, as they know my schedule and can usually point you in the right
direction.

Big giant long legged hugs,

vince

 Does anyone know of any outdoor parties this weekend? I had a great time
at the Freq 8 party, and don't really want to be inside if I can help it.

Frequency 8 returns on Saturday October 7.
We think that this may well be our last opportunity for a beach party 
this year and we want to take advantage of the light of the Full Moon!

Bonfires, tiki torches (thanks to Purple Tiger), and a full evening
of Cybertrance with MARS, MysterE and Cyr.  Your mappoint host will
be Mike Lasmanis.  $5.00  Call (415) 541-5019 for directions.

The fire gods encourage you to bring wood.  Your mother would want you to
wear sensible shoes and carry a flashlight

OH THANK GOD!

This is one of the best events a proud SFR-enabled being could ever want to
go to. Trust me (and Vince, and Rikki, and Purple Tiger, and, and, etc.!)
(location = 10!)

And thanks to Mr. Cyr and his wacky speaker cabinet toting/rock climbing
pals for not conflicting with the Friday night Nomad Interactive/Ameba
Splish cruise (Garth, Jeno, Tracy / Mark, Allen, Andrew)!

party on tiny warriors!

-w

ps: Oh yeah, this will surely be a good SRF laminate distribution opportunity.

I may have missed something, but is there going to be music at this event?
Either way I'll probably go.

DISCLAIMER:  To the prudes--don't read this one. 
 
 A friend of a guy in the Nutrition School at Tufts was one of the lucky 
 passengers onboard a Northwest Airlines flight to Boston during our 
 recent hurricane "Bob".  The captain did his best to skirt the edge of 
 the storm, but it was a pretty rough ride just the same - rough enough 
 that the flight attendants were ordered to strap themselves into their 
 seats for about half an hour, and many of the passengers were putting 
 the little plastic-lined bags in their seat pockets to good use.  When 
 the turbulence finally abated, the flight attendants unbuckled them- 
 selves, and the captain's voice came on over the intercom. 
 
 "Well, folks, that was quite some ride, wasn't it?  But we came 
 through it fine, just the way we always do, and I'm happy to report 
 that it looks like the remainder of our trip should be much calmer. 
 On behalf of myself and today's flight crew, I'd like to thank you 
 very much for your calmness and cooperation, and extend our best 
 wishes for a pleasant stay in Boston." 
 
 After a short pause and several clicks "Jesus Christ - whatta bitchin' 
 ride!  Boy - I sure could use a cup of good strong coffee and a blow 
 job right about now" 
 
 As a stricken stewardess dashed up the aisle to the cabin to inform 
 the captain that his intercom was still on, one of the passengers 
 called after her,  "Don't forget the coffee!" 
 

Hugs and giggles

Subject: Simply Done & a Big HUG2U!
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

     Well, this review is alot more favorable than my last review for the 
     same gig.  As always, things change and perhaps it was my mood, the 
     guest dj (Garth!), the ever-changing people (where have all the 
     fun-loving freaks gone?), the overall vibe factor, _and_ the improved 
     sound system that made this party go off more than what I've 
     experienced recently.
     
     Though a bit too smokey for me, the overall vibe of this party was 
     alot better than what I experienced at Phat Frisco or 1015 last 
     Friday.  (Keep in mind that all of these parties did go off, it's just 
     that for me, an energy-riding gal, I felt more of natural vibe and 
     plur at Simply Done than at the other two I mentioned.  _Purely_MHO._) 
     So what I'm trying to say, is that Garth ripped some funky tunes 
     putting a few people inside out and it was great to see and feel all 
     of that wonderful loving energy.   
     
     It's funny how much things change when you don't go out for a few 
     weeks.  In my case, it's been ~four weeks and I observed or heard:
     
     - that since Burning Man and Back-to-School not as many people are 
        going out.  1015 and the End-Up were pretty empty w/ravers this
        weekend.  
     - for those who went to Burning Man, how can you top that 
        experience?  Anything else is a let down if you expect to capture
        that same vibe/experience.
     - the scene always evolves and changes...but I'm finding not as strong
        of a vibe out there and alot more kids going off.  (Perhaps I'm
        just feeling old and out of it :}
     
     And yep, I know that the onset of Fall and less daylight affect us all 
     and tend to make alot of us more introspective.  But I haven't heard 
     anyone from sfraves really mention any of this yet, so I thought I'd 
     bring it up.  Especially since I really started interacting w/sfraves 
     and became more involved w/the scene around this time last 
     year...what's it been like in the Fall for the past three years?  Any 
     patterns?
     
     Well, I'm rambling and gotta get back to work but I wanted y'all to 
     know that Simply Done was great and I just wanted zap you all with a 
     dose of loving energy that I felt from the brothers and sisters out 
     there.
     
     Warm embraces,
     Diane

So here is my personal situation with the topics Diane brings up:
>      
>      - that since Burning Man and Back-to-School not as many people are 
>         going out.  1015 and the End-Up were pretty empty w/ravers this

I've been going out EVERY weekend since the last F&F!!!  *AND* I'm
going to school full time.  My studies have suffered, so I'm trying to 
begin a lower profile life now. I'm actally staying home this weekend 
until possibly the next F&F.  And I have Sunday off, too, which will make 
me ache inside knowing there might be a Sunset party in Berkeley or 
Richmond.  But, alas, tis time to take control of this rampant hedonism 
that is loose within me and get down to business.  Wouldn't we all just 
love to party every single weekend - some of you have it so lucky!!

To me, BM was in a category all its own.  You *cannot* compare it to the 
likes of ANYTHING, for to do so will result in certain disappointment.  
I've had a BLAST at Family, the Bonnie Doon Party, both Sunset parties 
after those parties, and Elevation last weekend.  I simply choose not to 
compare, for dwelling on past experiences is a waste  of time.  I have a 
good time NOW and I'm never disappointed.

What do you mean by kids going off?  Hmmm, Diane girl, you must be going 
to the wrong parties.....the parties I mentioned above have had 
incredibly thick sweet vibes pulsing strong all night long!  Maybe your 
theory of it being a seasonal change is somewhat responsible for your 
observations...(?)  Who can say....  Welp, there's my 2 cents for this day.

love,
Amy

Subject: [HUMOR] Another MIT Hack

An MIT student spent an entire summer going to the Harvard football
field every day wearing a black and white striped shirt, walking up and
down the field for ten or fifteen minutes throwing birdseed all over
the field, blowing a whistle and then walking off the field.  At the
end of the summer, it came time for the first Harvard home football
game, the referee walked onto the field and blew the whistle, and the
game had to be delayed for a half hour to wait for the birds to get off
of the field.  The guy wrote his thesis on this, and graduated.

Here's the deal:

I have two tickets to see Tricky & Laika tonight (9/28) at Slims. My friend
who I was supposed to go with is sick and can't make it. I've called and left
messages with four friends who might be interested in going. If none of them
call by 7:00 tonight, poor little moi will have no one to keep me company.

What can you do? Just show up (or call me after 7) and the ticket is yours! I
don't want to deal with scalping it (don't think the show is sold out... I
just bought the tickets 3 days ago) and it would be nice to finally meet one
of y'all (i've been lurking for a few weeks now) or at least give it to
someone who *really* wants to go. I just want to see the damn show!

415-931-5119. I'm leaving at 8:30.

toodles,

za

i know it's not kind to occupy bandwidth for personal issues, but at the same
time, this is a great chance to put a signal out to a community of wonderful
people. so for those of you who aren't looking for a place to live in
berkeley, please bear with me and skip this message.

i live in a friendly co-op in berkeley with two other men. i'm a writer and
visual artist. mike is a pre-school teacher and nature-lover. chris is an art
student at sf state. as you know, the first of the month is almost here, and
we're still looking for people to live with us on october 1st. in order to
keep a relative gender balance in the house, we're looking for two women. 

if you're a woman who's looking for a place - especially if you're looking
for a fun, friendly, artsy, veggie co-op in berkeley - or you know someone
who is, call me, or forward my number to her. my phone number is (510)
525-6088.  

thanks, 
shalom

RIGHT ON!!!
We really can do more to help each other.
1.  Watch each other....,if someone is sick, help!!! dont wait till they are
unconcious.
     get them out of the confussion get them to help.
2.  All parties should have a plan if someone is ill.  Ideally at least some
type of medical
     personnel,  for craps sake even a volly...
3.  Understand the side effects poissible adverse reactions etc.,, before you
take      anything including aspirin.  If you dont KNOW say NO!! it really is
everyones      responsibility to KNOW.. Find out dont hope for the best.  
4.  If you are new to the scene or some aspect of the scene find someone who
knows.
     and tell them you are new 99% of the time they will be glad to have a
new friend.

I apologize if I sound a bit bitchy but the scene is getting very messy....
1. Kids barfing alone in the bathroom every party. No friends? bullshit
2. No medical help, much less plans at most parties sorry I think for the $20
    there can be paramedics at the party .  Afraid of the attention? Ignoring
the problem
    will not help. Why not spend a few bucks on people instead of silly mega
flyers.
    Even small parties need some contingency plan. LIKE WHERE the nearest
    hospital is.
3. Dont mix unless you are experienced likewise if you're new to something
try half then 
    maybe,  with supervision take half in 1 or 2 hours..  Are people looking
for community
    or oblivion ask yourself and those around you what you expect to get from
the     Evening....,  do you want to barf, pass out , or share the experience
with your friends
    Are all those people against the wall really tired from dancing or just
messed.
4. If you do business at the party expect to get burnt.

RAMBLE RAMBLE..,,,
sorry I find new meaning in the aphex twin title "I CARE BECAUSE YOU DO"
PLUR
GREGO.

Feeling complacent and safe? Take a look at this hate filled crap from
the National Alliance (aka Aryan Nations, aka US Nazi party). THeir
lies are truly scary, and it's scary to think there are people out
there running around with these sick ideas in their heads.

| WORLD WIDE WEB: http://www.natvan.com (if unavailable, try our ftp site)
| FTP SITE: ftp.netcom.com, path /pub/NA/NA

I think they need to be fucked with, big time -- with their own medicine.
Take a look at their plans for spamming the online world in
	ftp://ftp.netcom.com/ftp/pub/NA/NA/ANA/USENET_Strategies

Perhaps we should start by e-mail bombing these shit heads -- you are
on their list, even if yer lilly white!.  On unix, for example, you can
severely annoy the perpertrators by doing something like

	cat /unix /vmunix | mail treborle@netcom.com
	cat /unix /vmunix | mail bf221@freenet.carleton.ca

(though since the unix kernel is copyrighted, perhaps you'd be
better off getting emacs to core dump and send them that instead)

Gee, it's just too bad that treborle@netcom.com will have to pay
$2.00/megabyte/month for any storeage above 5 megabytes on Netcom. And
the above drops a tidy 2 megs into the mail box each time. Vote early,
vote often!

PS: you're on your own w/r/t the legality of the aforementioned 
retaliatory act.

>(Ie funny hat, "phat clothes" et al.).This inspried me to make this lil quiz
>so you can test yourself.  ARE YOU A TECHNOPHILE?????

>
>1. Which DJ DOSENT belong:
A:  The one that can't spin or mix.

>2. When going to an event the best clothes to wear is:
A;  First , it's "...clothes to wear are:".  Other than that, you want to
wear fresh, washed clothes.  Ones that don't offend the olfactories.

>3)When on the dance floor and you see a fellow partygoer slip and fall on the
>floor, you:
A:  Determine if they're drunk.  If so, ignore them.  If on psychedelics,
determine their present state of crackerjacking.  If critical, call 911, if
not, have a good hardy laugh.  Scenes like this don't happen too often, and
it's best to get as much mileage as possible.

>
>4) When meeting a fello raver you:
A:  Check the state of crustiness.  If offense to the olfactories have
taken place, offer your hand.  If much offense, offer a pat on the back,
and wash the patting hand immediately.  If they smell good, a hug will do.
Especially if they're female.

>9) you know your at a bad event when:
A:
-People are dancing while holding cigarettes.
-People who have no rhythm "attempt" to dance.
-People do aerobics or stretches on the dance floor (worse than circle
dancing IMO).
-People smell like they've taken tons of X &/or speed, dance all night, hit
lotsa pot, smell really bad, and THEN wanna hug you.  Yeech!
-You hear two people talking "Hey, is that Jeno?!?", "No, it's Garth!",
when it's really John Howard or Mark Farina.
-When someone searching for a reason, or perhaps a clue, asks "Is this
where the 'rave' is?"; time to leave.
-Cops are everywhere.

>
>10) Instead of busting raves, police could:
A; Continue like they always have, collect graft from the promoters.

>
>Part II:  Choose the corresponding number to the correct definintion.  Time
>limit 10 minutes.
>
>1) Underground - A party nobody knows about.
>2) Massive - A party everyone knows about.
>3) Renagade - A Party people wish they threw.
>4) Gathering - After lunch in the men's bathroom.

On a similar note, I was shocked to discover recently that the KKK has put 
its monthly magazine ("The Kleagle") on the web.

	Does anyone know the name of the song featuring a woman's voice 
whispering "ec-sta-cy, ec-sta-cy" over and over, with a cool liquid bass 
synth sound in the background?  They played it at Family and Phat Frisco 
recently...

Subject: My Bio!

Greetings and Salutations!

My name is Jon Zimmerman and I live in San Francisco. Bored yet? This is a
long one I'm warning you...
I'm 24 and presently attend S.F. State fulltime (21 units this semester) as
a junior/Senior IAC Major (Interdisciplinary Arts). I joined SFraves
approximatly a year and a half ago (I think?), and I've enjoyed the "Rave"
scene since 1990. Although I can't remember the name of it my first rave
was in Los Angeles in 1990. Although at the time I was not really into the
scene or the music I do remember it being very attractive to me because of
the psycadelic nature of the music and the visuals. I remember it was in a
big hall with probably 2000 people. The illicit nature of the party was
very attractive as well. Anyways if you havn't seen my name before
(bigz@creative.net) it's because it was originally zimmermanj@aol.com (a
bunch of thieves!), I then moved to znet (bigz@znet.com (another bunch of
crooks!)), since then I have found a comfortable home at "creative.net".
Soon I will become an Island unto myself (bigz@bigz.com).
        At any rate let me give you a little B.C. (Before Current era)
about myself:
        I was born in Berkeley in 1971 and grew up in Oakland (Montclair).
For years I built plastic models, and expressed my self through many
artistic mediums. Then I discovered Jimi Hendrix when I was 10. At the time
I was playing really lame folk songs for some granola teacher, then one day
she ask me to listen to Jimi Hendrix's "Star-Spangled Banner"! After the
first 30 seconds I was in awe, here was someone painting and expressing
themselves with music through a guitar. No longer did I see it for playing
lame songs at the campfire, it became a paint brush. I goofed around for
the next 6 years on it, but not seriously. When I was 16 I got stoned for
the first time and for the first time really understood what the Jimi
Hendrix "Experience" was really about, and in extention all the other
psychadelic music of that period. Self-exploration. Simultaneously I was
reading every piece of Science Fiction I could lay my hands on. (funny how
I wind up creating with computers) Time warp through many years of playing
guitar, school, Los Angeles, and Rock and Roll. Somehow I ended up at
Mr.Floppy's Flop House in Oakland. Lots of groovy people and I was hooked,
this was what I'd been looking for, the whole time (I realized this two
years later). After playing in a "Grunge" band, I became creatively
stagnant (1993) and stopped playing guitar for the most part, other than to
score a CD-ROM. Last summer I started going to the Sunset parties (94') and
really wished I could play guitar with the DJs since I found the music
really enlightening.
I burned out on the Rock scene since I felt that many bands just complained
about problems in life, but gave little attention to how to change things.
And here was this music that Didn't bitch about life, but celebrated it.
Although it doesn't say verbally "let's change things" it seems to be
inherint in the nature of it alone, and seems to respect the listeners
intelligence. Since I have started listening to this music my world out
look as been for the most part positive and generally optomistic.
        I also found that rave music is the best thing (for myself) while
working at my computer. I somehow feel more "Intelligent".
        My next project ( within the next year) is to midi my guitar, find
a drummer with a midi kit and start doing live shows again. If anyone is
interested please get in contact with me. Something like if Yes, Pink
Floyd, Orbital and Amorphous Androgynous had a child.
        The last year I spent helping start-up a small multimedia company.
Info on it can be found @ (http://hooked.net:80/user/sireel/).

Anyways more on me can be found at (http://creative.net/~bigz/)


May you prosper and be succesful at whatever you care about...

Indeed!  Thanks to everyone who came out - it helped remind me and Laura 
what it's all about, and got us charged up for the following day (the 
wedding) and the following 10 days (the honeymoon, I just got back last 
night).  I think a lot of the SFRaves youngin's had fun meeting each 
other and us grandparents, too :)  Glad to hear things shut down without 
a hitch that Saturday, and special thanks to Ethan for the sound system 
and Larry for the generator/canopy.  See you all again soon...

May possibly be that Frankie Knuckes (Bones?) track from 'Welcome to the 
Real World', a CD you can find in most majar label stores. I've heard 
that track on quite a few mix tapes also, a kind of harmless sound, 
something my dad could probably snap his fingers to.

	I'm trying to find a location for a mid-sized media-event
cocktail-party sort of thing for Community ConneXion near mtn view,
but not knowing very much about mtn view I really don't have any
ideas. If anyone can think of a bar/restaurant in which holding a
cocktail party would work well, please contact me. If they are
internet-savvy (e.g. the icon bar&grill in the city) that would be a
plus, but not a requirement.

thanks,

     Hello,
     
     Since a couple of people asked, I thought I'd give a brief report of 
     Brian's and my adventures of the past two weeks.
     
     First, though, I want to thank everyone -- especially Ethan, Larry, 
     and the load in/out crew -- for the party at Bonny Doon that day.
     
     We left that party a little early to go out to dinner with our 
     parents, and then the wedding was the next day.  It went by so fast, 
     about the only things I remember was the way Brian said "I do" and the 
     way everyone snarfed down the wedding cake.  It was gone in less than 
     ten minutes, and I had ordered 100 servings for 80 people :-) :-)
     
     On Monday (the 18th) we left for Hawaii.  Our first stop was Maui for 
     four days.  Speaking for myself here, Maui was okay.  It was very arid 
     (except for the north/east side, going to Hana) and full of tourists 
     who drive too fast to view the scenery.  We played tourist and took a 
     helicopter ride around the island, and got a good close-up view of 
     some incredibly steep mountains on the west side of the island.  We 
     also went snorkeling and sailing, which was a lot of fun.  
     
     After that, we went to Hawaii (the Big Island, which is not where 
     Honolulu is, although many people seem to get that confused.  Honolulu 
     is on Oahu.  We didn't go there except to pass through the airport).  
     The Big Island is gorgeous.  The east side is all jungly, like a 
     rainforest (and I didn't have to drive three hours on tiny roads to 
     get to it, it's all right there).  We saw pretty waterfalls that 
     created rainbows as the water misted over the rocks below.
     
     From there, we drove up to the Volcanoes National Park.  We spent two 
     days up there, hiking around.  The main fire pit at the top of Kiluea 
     has been dormant for a while, but we hiked about a mile and a half 
     across some lava flows further down the mountain, and got a good view 
     of the current active vent.  The next day we drove down to sea level 
     and could see where the lava was flowing into the ocean, spewing up 
     huge clouds of steam.  We didn't actually see any red molten lava, the 
     park ranger said we'd have to be there after dark to do that and we 
     were just too tired to come back later.
     
     Then, we drove around to Kona on the west side of the island.  We 
     stayed in a house right on the water -- sometimes the surf would send 
     bits of spray up to our window!  We went snorkeling and saw more fish 
     than I can describe.  There's this shallow bay south of Kona, and from 
     the second we put our masks on we saw that we were surrounded by 
     schools of multi-colored fish.  Plus, it was spawning time for several 
     species of fish, so there was lots of mating/chasing/protecting 
     territory going on.  Unfortunately, a hurricane off the coast of Japan 
     was kicking up heavy surf all around the Pacific, so it kept getting 
     rougher and rougher.  We tried snorkeling at a second location, but 
     stopped after I got dumped on the rocks by a wave.
     
     Our last stop was Kauai, where we stayed for four days.  Although I 
     liked the Big Island the best, I thought Kauai was the prettiest.  It 
     rains there a lot so everything is lush and green, overgrown with 
     flowers and vines.  We went hiking in Waimea Canyon, did a little

I saw a really interesting show last night on PBS all about the birth and
evolution of techno & house etc., and the use of 'tables as instruments ...
and I finally found out something I always kind of wondered about ... so
here's my question - HOW MANY PEOPLE KNOW WHY HOUSE MUSIC IS CALLED HOUSE
MUSIC?

Maybe this was already common knowledge ... but I just wanna see how many
people know the answer!

Well, from what I heard (and I don't know if this is true), House
music was named after a club that Frankie Knuckles ran, which
was called 'The Wharehouse.'  or something along those lines.... 

What have other people heard???

House music was first played and popularized at a club called the
"WhereHouse" in Chicago (?) or Detroit.  Hence, when people referred to the
music, they said "house".  Short for WhereHouse!  =)

You could always drive down to Santa Barbara for Justice's 1 yeat

   Yeap you are correct sir! and for answering you get a big  blow-pop 
and a big hug next time I see ya :). I was watching that same show last 
night and one about punk rock before that. They had said that reggae 
music was an influence for punk. Interesting:).

this is what i have heard...
house music was coined to describe the unique blend of musics being 
combined by carter/may/saunderson/et. al. when they were spinning records 
at chicago/detroit/new york clubs. certain individual styles became 
identified with certain clubs and the resident dj at the time. the clubs 
were the house, the music played therein was the music of the house, or 
just house music... like a resident rock band is the *house* band, the 
style of music of the dj spinning there was the *house* music.

...just what i have read...

> >9) you know your at a bad event when:

> -People are dancing while holding cigarettes.

Depends on crowd density on this one.  Also, one can cup a cigarette
in one's hand so as not to burn.  Those who smoke outdoors:  the earth
is not your ashtray!!!

> -People who have no rhythm "attempt" to dance.

Actually, there's usually so much movement on the dancefloor that it
doesn't really matter if any one individual is off -- except if they're 
wielding a cigarette like a weapon, moshing like some 
crossover-tourist-newbie, etc.  I'm usually not doin' enough spectating to 
notice. Actually, I'm glad that these rhythmically-challenged people are 
out there, cuz' it's one of the few environs where they can lose the 
burdensome load of self-consciousness experienced in daily life and in other
dancefloor contexts.

> -People do aerobics or stretches on the dance floor (worse than circle
> dancing IMO).

Yes, things that disrupt dancefloor energy:  conversations, 
camp-outs, wandering looki-loos, etc.  

One sure indicator:  When some idiot in the crowd yelps "eweh-eweh", the 
crowd responds w/a resounding "eweh-eweh".  I love it when this this 
call-and-response is suppressed by no response (sign of a promising 
party =).  Dear fellow, I can suppress you're cigarettes by moving away, 
but I can't close my ears.

> -People smell like they've taken tons of X &/or speed, dance all night, hit

Or how about when they know the name of the DJ, and scream it out as if
"Garth!" and "Jeno!" were fucking rockstars or gods and they, silly 
sychohantic teenage fans straight out of BeatleMania.

> -When someone searching for a reason, or perhaps a clue, asks "Is this

So to recap:
Call:  "eweh-eweh"

Which is why really vocal disco-y house is known as 'garage', after the

Well, I guess it's time to quit hanging around and start talking with a 
short intro.  I've been on the list for around a month.  I'm a relative 
newbie to the scene, having been introduced to it by my beautiful cousin 
about 8 months ago.  I just graduated from Cal this year, leaving me more 
time to go out, although I haven't capitulated on this fact recently.  I 
studied entomology and now I work doing biological research on healthier 
pest control strategies.  I feel like a freak admitting this because 
everyone else on this list seems to be into computers and the like.  
O-well, no one ever forgets the fact that I study bugs, so I guess I have 
my little claim to fame (or freak-hood as the case may be!!)  :]

I've been really enjoying this list.  A free exchange of ideas, 
communication and acceptance, as well as a lot of tolerance is expressed 
here, something I've been in dreadful need of.  

I don't remember the first rave I went to, it was at the Vallejo 
fairgrounds.  I found it interesting, but I was a bit put off by people 
showing off and trying to be the coolest person who had done the most 
drugs and had the coolest clothes.  (I had enough of that in high 
school)
However, because of my cousin Emily 
who some of you may know, I was able to see through this and realize 
there was something pretty special going on.  After going to a few more 
raves with some good friends, I loved it.  I think the thing I like the 
most is the fact that I don't have to deal with this perpetual mating 
game that I've had to deal with most of my life.  I've spent quite a bit 
of my life unknowingly succumbing to society's gender stereotypes.  I was 
so sick of having to fill some role, that when I found raves I felt so 
wonderfully happy.  I had finally found a place where I could dance, be 
myself, meet open-minded people, and not worry too much about a big 
game.  It was and is great.  (I give a special thanks to all the people 
on this list who help make this happen just by being yourselves!)

To make this quick, the thing I like the most about the music is its 
paradoxical nature; it climaxes without ever subsiding.  The best time 
I've ever had, and one of the biggest learning experiences, was at F&F in 
August.  I went literally with friends and family (my two cousins) and 
re-discovered a wonderful friendship with one of my cousins.  We had 
grown apart since coming to school and got closer at F&F.  Needless to 
say, it was beautiful.

Well, that's my hello to you all.  I hope I get to meet some of you , 
although I think I've already met a few in passing.

XXOO,

kirsten

P.S.  I'm 5'4" with now short brown hair and brown eyes, 22 yo.  I have a 
conservative exterior, but a very innate, liberal interior.  (AS the cliche 
goes:  You can't judge a book by it's cover! :]  )

The "techno purists" among us might point out that House music had been
around a few years before Techno really started.  Chicago was the home of
the Wherehouse (I'm not too sure about the Frankie Knuckles connection).
Juan Atkins/Derrick May/Kevin Saunderson were influenced by House, Funk,
Gospel, Jazz, and of course, Kraftwerk when they put out the music they
called Techno.

There is a difference, but it was often lost on the Brits, and they called
it all Acid House.

The only condition I have to anyone coming to crash at my house is a) let
me know AT LEAST a week before, and b) you MUST NOT BE ALLERGIC TO CATS or
you'll have a most unpleasant stay.  Oh yes .. and I only feed guests to a

What I think is being forgotten, and was one of the points of Mr. Jones'
original posting, was that drugs are dangerous AND fun. I don't know why the
only response to drug education on here is with the attitude of informing
only of the dangers in usage. At least as important is the fact that MDMA
acts on the brain first and foremost fun-as-all-get-out and then
maybe-you-might-die, too. This seductive aspect of MDMA, and indeed
forbidden substances in general, acts as a sort of positive reinforcement
before health problems even enter the picture, not to mention the allure of
flipping a finger in the shape of a pill and megawatt luvdance to society.
When danger is ignored or desired by those being dangerous, how do you
communicate a deterrent? Everybody knows that any ol preacher, teacher or
parent can prohibit - "It's bad for you, don't do it," without having any
experience with drugs at all. But where do people inform new users on the
range of dangers - "X is sooo good..but listen to this..."

eh

are you sure its Planet Soul?  I know that KMEL is now playing a song by 
Planet Soul almost constantly, and i dont think he is talking about that 
song.  i've heard a .mod from a while ago with that cut in it, and it was 
before Planet Soul became so popular. unless of course Planet Soul has 
been around for quite a while, then i guess that cut would have come from 
them. but to my limited knowedge of techno artists, i would think its not 
Planet Soul, but another group.

With smokers it's pretty obvious; their chosen substance is a known
physical irritant for many people around them.

But I just don't see what MDMA users should apologise for. Most people
I've talked to *like* going to parties where there is a lot of E. I
know I do. That is part of the point of throwing parties...to try as
much as possible to provide a safe place--a TAZ--where people can do
their own thing, be theirselves, and celebrate without much of the
negativity of the outside world intruding.

I believe that there is no need for MDMA users to apologise. On the
other hand, the lawmakers and police will never ever be able to
apologise enough for ruining people lives over consentual "crimes".

It could be Energy Flash by Joey Beltram from !990, which has a liquid bass 
sound, 
and the "ecstacy" voice but it is a man's voice whispering "ecstacy" not 
a women's voice,

live after hearing him on tapes and such.  He set was solid and i
danced my ass off for most of it.  Jeno was before Steve Loria and
he was good, i didnt really listen to Garth's set after Steve.
  the location was cool.  (f&f in the house:) but it was a little
crowded and hot but i didn't mind cause everyone was grooving.

  good party all in all.  peace and see ya at sunset

Hello everyone,

I've left 5 copies of my mix tape at Soundworks, a record store on 
Valencia St. in the city.  Most of you know where it is, I hope, 
because I don't have the address on hand.  If you don't know, call 411, 
they'll know :)

The tape is still free for anyone who wants it.  Look for it on the far 
left hand side of the display cabinet, or tell them the name of it and 
they'll look for it.  You might also want to ask for Toby, since he was 
the person who I gave the tapes to.

If you pick up a tape, PLEASE email me, so I know who has them and if I 
should leave more.  I've dubbed and distributed almost 30 tapes so far, and 
have many more to go...  Next time, I think send it to a cassette 
manufacturer :)

If you live outside of the Bay Area and have not received your tape in the 
mail yet, don't fret- I promise to get them all out in the next couple weeks!
If you live in the Bay Area and cannot make it to Soundworks, then email 
me and we'll work something else out...

Over and out,
<beep>
Seth
