I assume you have been to the Rosicrucian museum in
San Jose?  If not get your rear in gear! 
(http://www.egyptianmuseum.org/)

The De Young in SF also used to have a pretty good
Egyptian section and that's about to reopen.

Peter

The wallpaper on my cellphone is a bust of Ahkhenatun from the Rosicrucean 
museum actually!

I'll have to go check out this other gallery.

I sweat all things ancient. They were so much further advanced than we are 
in so many ways, it's unbelievable.

Subject: [sfraves] Ride from East Bay to Treasure Island?

So - both my rides more or less bailed on me to go to TI today. Rather than 
take a cab (which will be expensive as doodoo), I'd like to give my hard 
earned $$ to some nice SFRaver for gas money instead.

Anyone up for the challenge? It'd just be me and my records.

Quick and easy way to make some gas $$...anyone? Bueller?

So, they pwned?  I can't say I love Z's new album, but "uneasy

I think "mixing" DJ's can be just as good for different reasons. Although

Incidentally - if you like super amazing turntablism + mixing, I have an 
A-Skillz vs. Krafty Kuts hip-hop mix that is SICK. A rack of commercial 
hip-hop tracks, but it's 4 decks/2 mixers/all sickness.

Yea - I felt like giving a nod to the old skool and breaking out my grab bag 
of UK hardcore remixes. A little Ratpack here, some Prodigy there, etc. etc.

Good times on a Sunday afternoon - thanks to all who made it out!!!

Subject: [sfraves] a rose for emily.   october 2005 on sfraves

'a rose for emily'
squashed from formal publication
available only on SFRaves, during the witching season of Halloween week. 

“In his deepest madness since 1996, Boomerang exhumes the corpse of Faulkner, and the smell of
decay is sickening.  You will never again see the DJ with innocent eyes.”                    
   --  Portland Underground Review, August 2005
...............................
   
The world decayed, and the underground decayed with it. Saturday night after Saturday night.  
Corpses were found in bathrooms, in bedrooms, and in the sleeping arms of rave businessmen whose
pockets were fat with green.   

Some of our bodies waited days for discovery, until the stench became unbearable.

Postmodernism lost its irony.

Shit said howdy to the fan, and no pardons were granted.

Oh Oh Oh New SFR Subject to talk about.
 What are the differant ways you people out there refer to placing pills
into the anus?
 Pluggin Pills is pretty good, I've always refered to it as Booty Bumpin'
 What are some other ways to describe this crazy act, and who all has tried
it? I know of a couple of people who did. One girl who actually preferred
that method and a guy friend who tried it and said his ass burned all night=
.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] the world has gone to hell

2003 i was in a wierd place.  i'd just gotten back from 7 months in
china and then moved into a dirty warehouse in san francisco.  i was
lost and needed some place where i could feel safe and warm.

my friends invited me to bayraves.  at first, i was afraid of what my
SFR friends would think.  would they disown me?  would they talk about
me behind my back?

oh bayraves, what have you done to me...i can never leave you.

What are the differant ways you people out there refer to placing pills
into the anus?
Pluggin Pills is pretty good, I've always refered to it as Booty Bumpin'
What are some other ways to describe this crazy act, and who all has tried
it? I know of a couple of people who did. One girl who actually preferred
that method and a guy friend who tried it and said his ass burned all night.

i've done it 3 times.  it's always happened on those occasions where  
things have gotten so depraved that it doesn't seem like such a big  
deal (that, and nobody really remembers doing it).  i've convinced  
many people to try it though. that's always fun.

the trick to keeping the burning to a minimum is to make sure it gets  
way up there.  most people don't have fingers that long though, so  
getting help from someone else is key.

i can hear you all going "ewwwwww" right now. :-)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] the world has gone to hell

what if you made some kind of paste with the stuff and some kind of
binder like...vaseline or oil?

and then you could put it in a syringe with a tube on the end and then
just...kinda inject the stuff up your butt instead of pushing a pill
up there?  wouldn't the pill kinda chaff or scratch?

ok, i'm spending way too much time thinking about this.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] the world has gone to hell

All this talk of plugs up the butt make me think of two things: butt plugs 
in fetish land, and the plugged H up Renton's butt in Trainspotting...

Choose life. Choose a job. Choose a starter home. Choose dental insurance, 
leisure wear and matching luggage. Choose your future. But why would 
anyone want to do a thing like that?

When he went to the "worst" toilet in scotland and the plug falls out, and 
he goes in and swims after it...

i get those just when i reply to a long thread and
there are a number of addresses that it goes to from
people who have replied. i have to delete all of those
and just address it to sfraves.

fucking novels on here and it still goes through:P

Subject: [sfraves] VJS in NYC?

Does anyone know anyone that does live video
performance or VJing in NYC?  I'm especially
interested in contacting someone that employs digital
tools to create audio driven or audio generated
graphics.  This is for a friend of mine who is a
professor and author who has previously written about
the cognitive and cultural functions of music and the
use of computer graphics for visualization.

Any help would be appreciated!

Regards,

Peter

See, that's why it's best to pre-crush them, and down it like a shot. It

Some of you may have read this article or similar ones like it. The
mainstream media has shrugged aside LOADS of credible evidence that suggest
the 2004 presidential voting results are quite fishy, and most democrats in
office have put their tails between their legs in fear of shattering the
confidence that americans have in their so called "democracy." For those of
you who wonder why the exit polls (which are the gold standard to detect
fraud when the US/UN monitors other nations' elections like Yugoslavia,
Ukraine etc) didn't match up with the 2004 presidential results, along with
many other open seats on capital hill, the only plausible thing the polling
organizations could come up with was that kerry voters were more likely to
speak with the pollsters?! How's that for hard evidence. Below is a very
LONG, and in-depth article that uncovers the many irregularities surroundin=
g
the 2004 elections, you may surprised ;)

Oh yah, I don't have a problem with anybody disagreeing with this, but if
you plan to, you may want to read the entirety of this article first!

I generally mix it with a little saline and shoot it into my ears. 
Totally trippy auditory hallucinations that way, mang.

An LED-encrusted rave fan helps a lot to dry it.  Just bring extra
batteries.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] 2004 Election Fraud

One thing I recall, is that kerry actually ended up technically
winning ohio and florida, but being as he QUIT at about 4am EST (I
remember this, because I was driving home from the bar and listening
to it on the radio), before all the votes were counted, it didn't
really matter. If he would have waited it out, he could have won those
states too.

>From an overall vote count, I believe bush did win though.

I remember reading a few articles on what scared people, what they
liked most about the candidates.

Kerry's #1 complaint was his lack of ability to take a firm stand on
any issue, which was viewed as a sign of weakness to the American
people. Even saturday night live made fun of this in november, while
the presidential debates were going on.
Bush's #1 complaint was that he didn't know what he was doing, and
that his tenacity towards his personal goals was going to tear the
United States apart.

Kerry's primary good point was his education and understanding of the law.
Bush's primary good point was his ability to take a stand, regardless
of whether or not it was right, and stick with it.

Personally, I'd rather have had Dean win the election. I thought he
was a better candidate than either of them. I dislike both Kerry and
Bush. He had charisma, intelligence, and leadership ability.
Apparently he also doesn't know how to use a unidirectional
microphone, but that's not his fault.

As for the election being rigged? doesn't matter. Kerry gave up before
the final tally came in anyhow. If you want to start screaming
conspiracy, start by pointing fingers at the guy who quit before the
votes were all in.

Anyhow, that's my .02

:)

"it doesn't matter"?

maybe it doesn't matter in the sense of the final outcome of the  
"election", but i think it *does* matter.  i mean, if the election  
was stolen, wouldn't that make Bush a criminal?  (i'm not saying he  
isn't, by the way)

sure, blame kerry for quitting, but not for defrauding voters.

The percentage that you absorb into the bloodstream is WAY more then
parachutting it. Also, it still lasts as long as swallowing it whole,
rather then snorting it which is a much sorter lived experience.
Plugging is best for maximum vend.

Oh, and I tried it once with one pill and I rolled so hard I couldn't
see straight and could only sit down. Way too strong plugging is.

ahh, but that was years ago, when I actually had connections...

Oh, if you guys want to hear gross, I talked to some guys that had
heard that most of the un-aborbed MDMA goes out with urine, so after
rolling for awhile they pee'd into cups and drank their urine.

This list will bounce mail if:

- the message size is over 50K (Karina's calendar is almost always under 
50K)

- you are crossposting to more than 5 other addresses

- you have posted more than 20 times in one day

All 3 requirements have been raised in the last 6 months. I generally 
just react to collective feedback from you guys in adjusting the above 
requirements, so if you have any, shoot me an email.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] 2004 Election Fraud

The problem with arguing that the exit polls show
election fraud is that you don't have sufficient
information to actually analyze the poll data. 
Without knowing the weighting function used by the
poll takers, you simply can't analyze the data.  This
is statistics 101 stuff.  Only the polling firm knows
that information and they apparently aren't going to
talk.  

This is the problem with having corporate control of
exit polling; the exit polls have become a
mulit-million dollar entertainment business.  They're
more of a play by play of the election, instead of a
means of verifying the election results.  And polling
firms have no interest in seeing the accuracy of their
polls questioned since it might jeopordize their
business.

Regards,

Peter

Drinking pee to get high is actually an ancient
shamanic tradition at least according to some sources.

http://www.cannabisculture.com/articles/3136.html
http://www.spruceroots.org/December01/Amanita.html

Not that I'm advocating drinking pee or anything.

Peter in your comments regarding polling firms, like I said in the first
initial email I sent out. EXIT POLLS ARE THE GOLD STANDARD to determin the
POSSIBILITY of FRAUD. In fact, Exit Polls have time and time again proven t=
o
be the most precise counting of votes, aside from the actual vote tallies
them self- which is kind of hard to do when you don't have a papertrail! In
fact, exit polls are so strongly trusted, that Germany uses them to announc=
e
results for top political positions in their country, then the actual vote
counting precides the day[s] after to determine that everything is in line.
Time and time again the US and UN monitor elections in many nations
throughout the world, and what is their method to determine voting fraud,
EXIT POLLS. Of course you have your right to disagree, but did you read the
entire article? Don't you find it more than just a little strange that exit
polls matched up just about everywhere except for battle ground states alon=
g
with open seats on capital hill. How is it in the places where electronic
voting took place, but no paper trail was left, that Bush + cronies
exceeded, 100%, 200%, even 300% of the registered republicans in such a
district. How does Bush overwhelmingly take counties in florida in blue
district strongholds with over 80%+ registered democrats by a substantial
margin? And why do irregularites occur time and time again in swing states
in districts that have electronic voting machines THAT LEAVE NO PAPER TRAIL=
.
Kerry giving up the fight is his own decision. But it is the right of the
American People to have what is promised to them in their constition. Just
like 9-11, we are left with a plethora of unaswered questions, and I begin
to wonder if thesethey will ever be addressed by anyone in political office=
,
and if then it is, will anyone else listen?

Don't hold your breath on this ever being seriously looked into. Who holds 
the power in this country? Republicans/Bushies. You think they're going to 
open up any investigations into this any time soon? Methinks that'd be a big 
fat NO.

Honestly, I think the American people are so fucking lazy and ignorant at 
this point anyway, that it wouldn't do any good. I mean - Bush lied about 
why we went to war, and what happened? NADA.

People barely even batted an eyelash.

Lazy, fat, numbed by TV and all the mood altering crud that the pharm. 
companies are cramming down people's throats. Not exactly the type of 
society that's gonna jump up and rebel against this type of BS.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] 2004 Election Fraud

Do any of the nations you mentioned previously  have
exclusive corporate control over exit polling?  Or are
the polls conducted by various groups of citizens and
not for profit organizations?  

The exit polls in America are controlled by a single
corporation and are really about making the election
exciting to watch on TV, not checking the election
results for fraud.  It strikes me as simply irrational
to expect a corporation that profits from the
spectacle of the election to have any interest in
undermining their main source of revenue by disclosing
the flaws in their polling procedure.  

In order to determine that the exit polls results
disagreed with the election results you need to know
the weighting function used by the poll takers.  This
is because exit polls use highly biased samples. 
Without the weights, we can't extrapolate from the raw
poll results to the sampled population.  Since the
polling corporation has refused to disclose this
information we're left guessing.  

Maybe there was election fraud, and maybe there
wasn't.  I'm not arguing there wasn't.  But the exit
polls can't tell you without the weighting function. 
I'm not arguing against you here, just pointing out
that knowledge of unweighted exit polling results
can't prove anything.  Its just the way that the math
works out.

Regards,

Peter

P.S. If they can fix elections,

No, no, you drink the shaman's pee after he (or she I
suppose) ingests the mushrooms. 

Drinking your own pee is just gross ;)

But here's another link anyway:

Subject: Re: [sfraves] the world has gone to hell

Well me too, but I'm thinking the shammanistic
reindeer piss drinking version of santa might make a
good Christmas party theme or costume...

On another note the now defunct Dr. Bombay's in the
Mission used to make drink called Pixie Piss.  "Dr.
Bombay, Dr. Bombay, come right away and bring a
pitcher of Pixie Piss dammit."

A couple excerpts from a link in the article below titled "Pratical Uses of Pee,"  http://www.rotten.com/library/medicine/bodily-functions/pissing/practical-uses/  
 

>>>Cheese making 
Although not a common practice, the addition of urine to cheese-making has been known to make a richer, more piquant cheese, highly sought after by those who've tasted it. 

 

>>>Curing Tobacco 
While it's hard to tell how extensive this practice really was, it is documented that at least some folks found that hanging their tobacco in the outhouse mellowed it and, oddly enough, lessened the stink it created when burned (as in a gentleman's after dinner cigar). Go figure. 
Information about the origin of this practice is sketchy. But it is intriguing to note that the 1771 edition of Encyclopædia Britannica instructs that "A strong decoction of the stalks, with sharp-pointed dock and alum, is said to be of good service, used externally, in cutaneous distempers, especially the itch: some boil them for that purpose in urine. The same is said to be infallible in curing the mange in dogs." We can only speculate whether some accidental steaming of tobacco, during such medicinal concocting, might have led to the discovery of the value of urine fumes. Or then again, perhaps someone was simply hiding his smoke in the outhouse and noticed the subsequent improvement. 


 

>>>Hair Shampoo 
Believe it or not, you can make your hair cleaner by dousing it with urine. Kinda takes those "shower" games you tried to a whole new level doesn't it? I think we can figure out how this one was invented. 
The more intriguing part is actually how it works. It turns out that urine shares some similar chemical properties with soap and detergent. Highly alkaline, urine can cut through greasy build-up and leave hair, dare we say it, "softer and more manageable". 
Naturally the whole process provides more pleasant smelling hair (according to modern standards) if combined with warm water rinsing and, better yet, a sudsy plant product such as soap root. 

 
 
And much, much more! Who would have thought?
 
Rgds,
 
Chuck

Drinking your own pee is just gross ;)

As sick as the subject is, it is at least entertaining.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] the world has gone to hell

Golden showers? Ok, I'm willing to do a lot of kinky things, but I
don't think I'm willings to pee on someone. Er wait, ok maybe I would
if she was really looking for that.

And NO I DID NOT EVER drink pee, I got that off of a conversation on
bluelight.nu <--- where the REAL druggies hang out.

Subject: Re: [sfraves]gone to hell, with fish hooks to correct the booty bumps



One night Chester decided to booty bump it, right before his set (he was booked the 1 to 3 slot). 
 Only problem was, it was an oval shaped pill and he launched it at a bad angle.  He could neither
come nor go.   You know how it is, like a vitamin C that doesn't hit your throat right.

It was important he had his things together by 1:00, but this was causing some problems.  Not to
mention his records weren't in order yet.  

Fortunately, Ryan had just gone fishing that day down at the Berkeley marina, and still had his
gear with him.   Delia had this brilliant plan that if we could launch one of Ryan’s hooks up in
there (tenderly, of course),   we could snag the pill and give it a soft tug to straighten it out.

It worked so brilliantly.

Only problem was, Chester tends to get all sissy and squeal like a little schoolgirl if concerned
friends try to work a fish hook up in there.   So there was a lot of wriggling and miscalculations
and arguing about how to do it right.   It took three chicks just to keep the pillow stuffed in
his mouth.   Mind you, Ryan had no lure and no lead weights to make it easier.     Ryan’s tackle
box really ain’t all that, in retrospect, if you think about everything Chester went through that
night.

We snagged a little skin, and Chester wasn’t exactly calm as we straightened out the mislodged
pill, but he managed to pull off a banging set that night.

word is bond,
boom

You were there that night too? I don't remember you being there, but you
described it with such accuracy you must have been. Delia, you know you
didnt have to suggest Ryan's fishing hooks...you could have used a stick or
something, but thanks so much for that extra effort it really paid off.

The question still remains, how come the exit polls match up in districts
that leave a papertrail, and in districts in swing states (new mexico, ohio=

florida) that use electronic voting with no papertrail, many exit polls wer=

well beyond the +/- statistical error always in favor of bush? What can the

Subject: Re: [sfraves] 2004 Election Fraud

well, technically speaking, it's up to the company who did the
electronic voting to give the paper trail.

Good luck on that one. I think they went out of business on account of
the elections, and how they botched them.

Regardless, Kerry still won ohio and florida when all was said and
done, and if he hadn't quit, he'd be our president right now.

A papertrail is a paper printout from the electronic voting machine. This
has nothing to do with the polling company. Luckily, in the state of
california we have voting machines that provide a paper printout once your
vote has been casted- so that your vote is not lost in the cyberspace of th=
e
electoral college. So if need there be an audit on the vote, we have a
papertrail which can be counted. Millions of electronic voting machines in
the 2004 did not have paper printouts. So who's to say if you voted on one
of these machines, that your vote was really counted for who you voted. Wha=
t
kind of proof would you have to reassure you that your vote wasn't thrown
out, or altogether changed, by error or by intention?

Subject: [sfraves] A Spin THIS! Thank you!

Spin THIS! would like to thank everyone for an AMAZING time last Sat  
night!
Sorry this is a few days overdue, needed to recover!  ;)

Clare Large (main floor) and Sindri (lounge) did a fabulous job  
rocking the decks!

Brain Damage and Nezzy Idy put on stellar performances providing much  
aural pleasure!

Maxmin, as always, stimulated our visual senses.

Nurse Glitch was joined on the sideshow circuit by a phenomenal  
performance by Pyrotaion- Pi, Memory, and Ms. Fine! They were  
confirmed at the last minute, so more details about these brain  
fizzling artists here-
www.pyrotation.com/
www.lsdFuego.com

And of course, to all of you who showed up and added to the magic!
We had a marvelous time, darlings!

I would also like to give a big round of applause to all the folks  
who crew for us- promotions, set-up, tear down, door, etc.  We could  
not do it without their devotion and support!

MARK YOUR CALENDARS! We have an extra special night planned for our  
next Spin THIS! on Nov 5th. All the details to follow in the next day  
or so!
www.dark-tekno.com/spinthis/
spinthis@dark-tekno.com
http://dark-tekno.tribe.net/ (join our tribe for up to minute details  
and special offers!)

A couple other events you will enjoy-
Thurs 10/13- Pandora's Box
http://pandorasbox.melanieblau.org/

Fri 10/14- NeuroGenesix

I had a weekly back in DC/VA a few years back - and we had Clare Large

This was posted awhile back. I always save links to
music I might like to retrieve in the future. So I
listened to this for the first time and I just have to
say that this is a good fucking mix. I mean it had me
wanting to bust out dancing right here in the computer
lab at school LOL. Very good job G.A.M.M.A. This is a
really powerful mix and is now one of my favorites.
Thank You:):):)

my lease expires in jan 06 and i dont want to renew my contract because i want to rent a house with a yard, i can't stand living in an apt anymore...
i'm starting to look and price out places...
 
i know its early but the months have come and gone and time keeps moving...
i'm looking to rent a 3or4bd house in berkeley..keep in mind that i have 2 boys..who absolutely love my friends and love music...and are really well behaved...you dont have to worry about making noise and stuff cuz they sleep thru my loud bumping music...
 
i have a steady job, actually 2 jobs so my part of my rent wont ever be late...
i'm a pretty openminded laidback fun outgoing groovee chick with no hang ups..
 
if this sounds like something you may be interested in, let me know...and yes this is open to a guy or girl or both...gender don't matter..

OOh OOOh OOOH me too!!! 

To bad you're not moving to the city Adriana:(

I absolutely cannot take my current living situation
anymore. I'm looking to move between Nov 1st through
Dec. 1st.

I'm looking for a welcoming, warm household. I'm
currently a student at ccsf so I don't just sit on my
ass all day:D I have a 2 year old male spayed cat
who's very loveable and kind. 

I'm responsible and respectful of other people's
lifestyles. I prefer to live with females but if you
aren't an alpha macho male type I think I could handle
that.

If you or anyone you know has a room in the city
opening up anytime soon holla at me. Thanks!

-Delia:)

Bought it yesterday, It's called Mixconnection or something like that. I like some of the tracks, but just can't feel the mix. Anybody want it? First to reply offlist can have it- and don't worry- I don't have a "Gave-you-my-lame-mix-cd-now-you're-on-my-DJ Spam List," but I might just throw in a demo for comparison's sake. 

peace

Guess which Wal-mart is getting evil phone calls tonight.... ;)

I hate Americans sometimes. Like - seriously LOATHE the people in this 
country. You know it was some flag waving redneck who said "Ain't no'un 
gonn' badmouth ol' Dubya!".

All the hurricanes could've wiped out the vast majority of the Southeast of 
this country, and I really wouldn't have felt all that bad...

you'll probably have a better effect if you call their corporate  
office and complain there.

or better yet, write a letter voicing your displeasure at such  
unamerican activities on the part of WalMart employees:

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Keoki, DRC, and DJSeven

it would be best and easiest to just talk to the reservationist, she is a 
doll and very helpfull.
415 348-0900
she is filled in a bit more on upcoming performances/details of certain 
evennings as well as pricing and whatnot.
her name is Blue.
generally it is a 5 course prix fixe meal for 60$ not including 
drinks/gratuity.  We love it when people dress in costume and play with us.  
The dinner takes about 3 hours, one seating, we accomodate all dietary needs 
and we have fun.  Fridays and saturdays are a lot of fun. after 11:30 or so, 
the bar rouge opens to flood  the dining area and turns into a big party, 
often we have well known dj's stopping in and playing, like last night with 
Keoki.  He will be back next wek as well, we are not sure when.  But rumor 
has it SF will be able to see him for a few weeks  ;)
You never know what will happen at SupperClub, it is always a surpise.

I love how everyone knocks on Keoki.  Personally I loved most of the early
mixes he put together and some of his tracks too. The times I've seen him
live he played some solid sets and didn't even go into a k-hole like
everyone says he does.  Plus, he's funny, and with him looks count.

He played a remix of Rod Stewart's "Forever Young" at Buzz in DC once. He is 
the uber-lame for that.

Sorry - that's just weak.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Keoki, DRC, and DJSeven

Well I've never seen him, and I'm not so big on
"superstar" DJs, but I  enjoyed Disco Deathrace
2000...

Does this make me hopelessly uncouth and uncool?

ok so we're in the middle of negotiations with Meat

i saw MBM fully live back in 2002 at the Sweets Ballroom (Area 51 that
got split into two parties).

one of the most memorable performances ever.  i would be willing to
pay good money to see MBM on Halloween.

enlightened people come to us from all cultures and all eras, 
sometimes knowing of each other but more often not.  Socrates and 
Jesus, Lao Tzu and Tolstoi, Gandhi and Martin Buber -- no one can 
find in their lives and words a jot of support for a political and 
economic regime that encourages the acquisition of wealth far beyond 
what is needed for the necessaries -- or even the restorative 
pleasures -- of life while consigning the masses to live and work in squalor."
-Stephen J. Fortunato, Associate Justice, Rhode Island Supreme Court.

turntable and hear the latest in cutting-edge tech house.

Shit you not, homes.

imagine if it happend at a candy rave!!!



Cops Handle Kids' Fist Fight Over Pacifier
-
Wednesday, October 5, 2005

(10-05) 12:51 PDT Pawtucket, R.I. (AP) --

Normally, a fight between two children over a pacifier might be
resolved by their mothers. But in Pawtucket, the police had to step
in. It all started Monday afternoon, when a 6-year-old boy dropped a
pacifier.

Another 6-year-old boy picked it up and refused to give it back,
allegedly prompting the first child to deliver a punch. Police said
the boy with the pacifier then punched back.

Pawtucket Police Detective Donti Rosciti said one of the mothers
called police, saying she wanted the fist fight documented because her
son had three minor scratches on his face, and she didn't want his
school accusing her of abuse.

A patrolman wrote up a report, then went to the home of the other
child to speak with his parents, Rosciti said. He called the case very
unusual.

"I've never seen a report with two kids this young," he said.

Rosciti said that as far as police are concerned, the matter is over.

"A 6-year-old can't be held criminally responsible," he said.

Then there is "Acoustica", an album of Aphex Twin tracks performed by the
22 piece band Alarm Will Sound:

  http://www.bangonacan.org/store/item.html?sku=CA21028

Good stuff.

And let's not forget the Balanescu Quartet's Kraftwerk covers album
"Possessed", with David Byrne doing vocals on "The Model". That one is
essential.

--NextPart_Webmail_9m3u9jl4l_19499_1128754298_0

Hi,
If you want glowsticks, now is the time to get them.

I was in the mood for glowstickin' in the living room, dancing like crazy, wanting to show off to the neighbors and any pedestrians since I am on the 2nd floor.

I went to Safeway. Had a feeling they would have them. 

They are on sale, with the Club card, regularly 2.99 for a 3 pack, now for a limited time only 2.39.

Only problem is they are MONSTER GLOWSTICKS, 2-green, 1-orange.

Ha, ha, I didn't care about the color, I opened the patio door, turned off the lights, turned on the lava lamp, turned up the stereo, broke the glowsticks, and had a good old time.

So, it's Happy Halloween time. Have fun with CRAZY GLOWSTICKS everyone and it's all GRATE.

Greg

Subject: [sfraves] LoBudg (SOTEG + Carbon Community) - LIVE @ Furious 2

Aaron finally got around to posting this.  If you like the gritty
electro breaky sound, you gotta check this out!

As promised here is the mix from Furious 2.  This performance of SOTEG
and Carbon Community was their debut and ONLY performance together.
Ever!!! They had a few other shows scheduled after this one, but they
all fell through and our little show ended up being the only
performance of these awesome artists:

Fifty years of "Howl" today

Fifty years ago today, Oct 7, 1955, six poets held a
reading in San Francisco: They were Philip Lamantia,
Michael McClure, Philip Whalen, Allen Ginsberg, and Gary
Snyder.

Ginsberg read the poem "Howl" for the first time.


 From Howl


by Allen Ginsberg
For Carl Solomon


                            I

        I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by
               madness, starving hysterical naked,
        dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn
               looking for an angry fix,
        angelheaded hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly
               connection to the starry dynamo in the machin-
               ery of night,
        who poverty and tatters and hollow-eyed and high sat
               up smoking in the supernatural darkness of
               cold-water flats floating across the tops of cities
               contemplating jazz,
        who bared their brains to Heaven under the El and
               saw Mohammedan angels staggering on tene-
               ment roofs illuminated,
        who passed through universities with radiant cool eyes
               hallucinating Arkansas and Blake-light tragedy
               among the scholars of war,
        who were expelled from the academies for crazy &
               publishing obscene odes on the windows of the
               skull,
        who cowered in unshaven rooms in underwear, burn-
               ing their money in wastebaskets and listening
               to the Terror through the wall,
        who got busted in their pubic beards returning through
               Laredo with a belt of marijuana for New York,
        who ate fire in paint hotels or drank turpentine in
               Paradise Alley, death, or purgatoried their
               torsos night after night
        with dreams, with drugs, with waking nightmares, al-
               cohol and cock and endless balls,
        incomparable blind; streets of shuddering cloud and
               lightning in the mind leaping toward poles of
               Canada & Paterson, illuminating all the mo-
               tionless world of Time between,
        Peyote solidities of halls, backyard green tree cemetery
               dawns, wine drunkenness over the rooftops,
               storefront boroughs of teahead joyride neon
               blinking traffic light, sun and moon and tree
               vibrations in the roaring winter dusks of Brook-
               lyn, ashcan rantings and kind king light of mind,
        who chained themselves to subways for the endless
               ride from Battery to holy Bronx on benzedrine
               until the noise of wheels and children brought
               them down shuddering mouth-wracked and
               battered bleak of brain all drained of brilliance
               in the drear light of Zoo,
        who sank all night in submarine light of Bickford's
               floated out and sat through the stale beer after
               noon in desolate Fugazzi's, listening to the crack
               of doom on the hydrogen jukebox,
        who talked continuously seventy hours from park to
               pad to bar to Bellevue to museum to the Brook-
               lyn Bridge,
        lost battalion of platonic conversationalists jumping
               down the stoops off fire escapes off windowsills
               off Empire State out of the moon,
        yacketayakking screaming vomiting whispering facts
               and memories and anecdotes and eyeball kicks
               and shocks of hospitals and jails and wars,
        whole intellects disgorged in total recall for seven days
               and nights with brilliant eyes, meat for the
               Synagogue cast on the pavement,

"No sage or savior has ever endorsed greed and gluttony as a path  
toward social justice or personal fulfillment.  These sane and  
enlightened people come to us from all cultures and all eras,  
sometimes knowing of each other but more often not.  Socrates and  
Jesus, Lao Tzu and Tolstoi, Gandhi and Martin Buber -- no one can  
find in their lives and words a jot of support for a political and  
economic regime that encourages the acquisition of wealth far beyond  
what is needed for the necessaries -- or even the restorative  
pleasures -- of life while consigning the masses to live and work in  
squalor."
-Stephen J. Fortunato, Associate Justice, Rhode Island Supreme Court.

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of  
the rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will  
gradually become visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Keoki, DRC, and DJSeven

i remember years ago when someone gave me a copy of a copy of a keoki 
tape and i about puked and definitely turned my nose up to the choice 
of music and the mixing style.

then earlier this year, will talked me into watching "party monster" 
and i got a little more insight to what he's about, because i never 
really heard much about him since he's not a san francisco based dj 
(unless he's now moved).  if all the events from the movie are true, on 
one hand, it re-affirms to me that nearly anyone can be a successful 
dj, and it has little to do with mixing skills, more rather, who you 
know and how well you promote yourself; on the other hand, you got to 
give the guy a hand for staying away from too much of the drug side of 
the scene, which i think we've all seen some of our friends become a 
complete mess because they couldn't control themselves.

and of course, "party monster" is a prime example of the worst case 
scenario.  it's chilling that story really happened!

if all you wonderful souls that produced the music

OK, my arms are sore today, I had too much fun with miniature glowsticks Friday night. I had no idea how intense this can be if you let the music guide you.

Now I wonder: what is the best glowstick size? Small, large, oh boy, that sounds risque without intending to be.

I used the 4" lightsticks, held them in my hands with good, comfortable results. That's why I am sore, too many rapid arm movements up in the air. Ironically, we also do arm movements in water aerobics so I am somewhat in shape for this exercise.

Also, turning off the TV works best cause you can see the reflection, thus guiding your practice movements.

Finally, I went to Home Depot today and bought the 6" lightsticks, which seem a bit awkward to me (too long). Maybe you have to tie a string on them and try swinging them, but when I tried it I had no control.

So far my best results have been with self-control--no strings--just my hands on the sticks, and waving my arms. 

This sounds so incredibly juvenile but what the hell, I am having fun and maybe light shows are part of what makes life happy, I did one for a friend and he asked for more, and we weren't even high.

Oh yeah, one of the 6-inchers from Home Depot was busted right out of the wrapper, what a disappointment, didn't light up at all. And it says "Homeland Security--Lasts for 12 hours" on the wrapper! 

It think it is ironic that the Halloween sticks (MONSTER GLOW) from Safeway were better--they are made my OmniGlow--"the world's leader in Glow fun"--which sounds like a Martha Stewart tag line. I wonder if she has tried glowsticking?

Greg

excuse me greg, but i think sfr is too sophisticated for glowsticks.
aren't glowsticks for trance? trance sucks. breakbeats rock.

Seriously though... seeing this train of messages makes me want to
give glowsticks a go again! I've never been very good with them, and
-- like most things that I don't 'get' right off the bat -- I never
really tried to get better. I think there's websites for technique and
methods etc? glowsticking.com? I'm about to go have a look.

Subject: [sfraves] Saturday Night Adventure: Rhythm Method

OK.. so like ya know, OK... ummm... I had no ride 2 bus stop or BART.. so
I walked 2 the Bus stop come like well.. late afternoonish... stopped by
my cousin's pad 2 visit my niece, went 2 McD's & yelled @ these like 7
lil' black girls who had 2 B like age ranged from 10-12.. but it wqas
fucking annoying... I was standing there like ready 2 order 4 like 10
mintues & God knows htey may hve been there like longer b4 i got there..
but they kept changing their orders, adding bacon 2 all their bugers,
changing their orders 'cause something or another... 10 fuckin' minutes..
then 1 of the girls wearing this Tinkerbell back pack was the most
annoying 'cause she changed her order like 30 times or something like
since i got there... & she was changing it again.. so i just said, "OH MYU
GOODNESS MAN, YO TINK, all the bugers taste the same.. just order
something Girl.. FUCK".. 'cause all I wanted was a dble cheese brgr & 2
pies... well.. needl3ess 2 say I think i kinda scared them & some of the
employees.. but yeah.. they opened up a register LoL, just 4 me & I swear
man.. my shit only took 3 mintues & those girls were still fighting about
what they wanna eat when i was leaving.. Heeeeeeeeello 2Daaay!!  Ya know?!
 LoL

Anywaze.. got 2 Ashby.. Mz Kittie picked me up @ the station!!  YAY!!! 
Got 2 her pad when Ms Kitty & the kids were performing Hula dances w/
music from Don Ho... Nice.. & they wre eating pinapples on toothpicks...
fun fun!

OK.. so me & the Lainta Feline Bitches Groovy Twosome of the Bay Area got
2 Shadow Lounge 4 the Rhythm Method monthlie.. OK... I'm gonna be like
honest.. 'cause like earlier in the day, i was listen 2 my friends spin
Jungle in the UK on their stations & shit.. so i was hella hyped about
goin' 2 RM 'cause like alota the shit's my UK Homie's spun theat day was
like all this ummm... like it was uplifting dnb kinda, yaknow??  LIke
tracks that made me pump my hand in the air & like stand up & kick step
all over the computer room.. well.. hopefully my Mom won't notice the
crack on the closet door 'cause i painted the crack w/ white out & put
glossy nail polish over it...

But I dunno... I expected 2 go 2 RM & get all inspired by the Jungle i was
gonna hear. Groove 2 all night!  But I dunno... I mean.. all the DJs were
good... The Doctor, Binoculous, ummm... ooh... wait.. his DJ name's not
Trinidad.. ummm.. grr. .. i 4got... but i keep calling him that 4 some
reason...  I mean.. aaaaaaaaaall the DJs were fuckin' Sick!!  Loved it!!! 
I danced my ass off, hd fun.. la la la.. but i dunno... i didn't hear
nothing uplifting like I did that afternoon.. so I was slightly
disappointed in gettng my hopes up 4 nothing.. I mean.. not nothing
nothing 'cause it was still bad ass.. but hnmmm... I just didn't hear
anything uplifting that night.. but the music was fuckin' Bad Ass.. YAY!!!

Ummm.. 4 those who remember Andy aka Kung Fu Special who lurked, didn't
really post on here... well.. he moved 2 LA like a few months ago.. but
has been makin' frequent trips up here to Bay Area & he was hard up 4 a
place 2 crash out Sat night after the club.. so he came over & we kicked
it hardcore 'cause we ain't kicked it since.. well.. the Breaks after
party 4 LP... lol.. but b4 that.. like months!

But yeah.. the usual RM crowd was there.. not packin like it usually is...
but enough people to like talk to some1 new like every 37 minutes.. it wa
Dope!  Saw hella heads out there!!  YAY!~!!

So that was Saturday night!  Hello 2Day.. ok.. I"m seriously still like
fluffy from Sat night still.. literally.. so yeah... LOLOLOLMAO, OK... I
4got what I was gonna say.. I'm so confuzed...

Love U SFR! :)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] so i'd like to float an idea...

Hi Everybody-   This idea is great.  SFRavers who are also Burning Man 
burners might recognize the Third Inversion Jazz Camp.  Some of those 
guys are terrific, a few live in SF, and they might be interested.  I'm 
an experimental musician myself, but I know many jazz people who would 
love the idea.  And I know plenty of experimental electronic, ambient, 
noise, etc etc, types who would love to do this.  Gee, what a great 
idea!   -BlueFire (aka Will Grant)

Subject: [sfraves] SRR: How Glowsticks Can Help You

--NextPart_Webmail_9m3u9jl4l_15835_1129050378_0
Content-Type: text/plain
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Hi,
I wrote a few messages recently about the joy of using glowsticks.
 
I thought about it and decided to explain why glowstick activity was important to me because I never expressed an interest before.
 
I have been working out a lot lately, at the swimming pool, and it has been great therapy for me, losing weight, being active, moving around. Unfortunately, I will not be able to participate anymore because I am having surgery later this month.
 
I will be laid up in a cast for 6 weeks--this is reconstruction for a quadriceps tendon repair from last year that failed.
 
Oddly, I have no pain and I can jump around in the pool like a dancing fool. I even made it to a nightclub where I moved like mad to the house music (you’re not likely to fall when you are body-to-body on a packed floor).
 
The surgery is necessary because I have a 30-degree lag for a left leg extension, which is potentially dangerous in everyday life (but not in the pool, where the water buoyancy helps).
 
Anyway, I am worried about the onset of depression due to inactivity, but I am trying to make the most of it, so I tried the glowsticks on a whim Friday night, and found that it was exercise, too.
 
The rapid arm movements were exciting and I built up lactic acid, felt fatigue and soreness the next day. I even felt that I had used my abdominal muscles while waving frenetically. I decided that I will be dancing, however I can do it, even with my shoulders, arms, hands.
 
I remember a raver from a few years ago, whose name escapes me, but who was in a wheelchair and still made it to the floor, wheeling around in circles and waving her arms like crazy. I will never forget the bravery of that person. 
 
Sincerely,
Greg

Wow, this sounds like a great night! There's just something about minimal techno.

I checked out the CARO site, downloaded the "We Can Build It" track from ORAC14, The Return of Caro and enjoyed every minute of listening pleasure.

Ready for more! I would love to hear "My Little Pony" and live PA is always different compared to pre-recorded tracks.

So, as far as I can tell, the only duplicate message sent out was Layla's

Re: [sfraves] so i'd like to float an idea...

But it had <sfraves@hyperreal.org> in both the to: and cc: fields (that
would explain it)

Also looks like if it did happen it's not happening anymore.

In any case, if anyone believes they received duplicate posts, just
forward both messages (with full headers) to me and I'll take a look.

Subject: [sfraves] Warning to party people - Saturday night bridge CLOSED

Anyone leaving the city after midnight on Saturday will NOT be able to
take the bay bridge.  Caltrans is shutting down the eastbound
direction, completely.

http://www.511.org/promo/baybridge/default.asp

"As part of its West Approach seismic retrofit project, Caltrans will
perform major demolition work in the eastbound and westbound
directions of Interstate 80 in San Francisco. This will require
complete closure of the eastbound direction of the Bay Bridge in the
early morning hours of Saturday, Oct. 15 and Sunday, Oct. 16, plus the
closure of several lanes and ramps in both directions at other times."

BART will be running all night to compensate:

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: Fuzzy Logic is this Saturday! 

FYI: The lower deck of the Bay Bridge is going to be closed from 1am to 
9am Sunday morning.  Fuzzy Logic will be located in the East Bay, so if 
you're coming from San Francisco, make sure to head over before the 
Eastbound span closes.  Another alternative would be to take the Golden 
Gate Bridge to 101 North, then take the Richmond-San Rafael bridge to 
the East Bay. Bart will also be running 24 hours on Saturday 
night/Sunday morning.


For more info on the bridge closure:
http://www.511.org/promo/baybridge/default.asp

on Bart serivce:
http://bart.gov/news/press/news20051011.asp


Our best advice:  Come early and stay late!  But shouldn't that always 
be the case?  ;-)


Love Chel-C Faith for DEF

It's no wonder how the bridge project is way out of budget......

Subject: Re: [sfraves] BSP: Folded One Year Anniversary @ Anu Tonight!

Just wanted to say a big thanks to everyone on this list who has come out
and supported the past year, when George and I first started the night we
envisioned a small spot where we could charge no cover, pack in our
friends, and cause a house music ruckus.  It's really turned out to be
that and more and it's by far my favorite day of the month, feels great to
get so many familiar faces together on the regular, last Friday was no
different.

And thank you, Andrew, for doing it for the love!
 I had a great time last Friday, nice to hear some classic tracky Chi-town
business, and the live bass and vocals on top were really fun! Good shit,
keep it coming.

It was good meeting you & George... didn't get a chance to talk to the fine
honey who dropped the vocals, but perhaps another time.
 This was really my first underground-feeling house night in the city since
I moved here from LA nearly two months ago. Thank you thank you thank you s=
o
much. I miss my little weekly get-togethers where everyone knows each other=
,
the vibe is tight and so is the room. My friend Darrin dragged my tired ass
out and it was well worth it.
 As I danced, all I could think was, "this is what I moved to San Francisco
for."

What he said.  Folded is the first club thing I've ever co-thrown, and
I really never expected, at first, for it to be anything more than a
place to play the music we make and love every month and showcase our
musical friends who need to be heard.  

Instead it's become sort of like a monthly
family-reunion-cum-weekend-party-times-jump-off-point.  I have so much
fun dancing and catching up with all'yall every first Friday it should
be like, criminal. :)

Anyway, *gush off*, thanks for a year of fun, surprises, and great
dancefloor antics.  

Luv,
-george C | origami

Subject: Re: [sfraves] BSP: Folded One Year Anniversary @ Anu Tonight!


I was really intending on going Friday (plus I had a gallery opening to go 
to as well), but wound up getting kind of ill and stayed home. I have heard 
nothing but fantastic feedback about Folded though, and hope to make my way 
out sooner or later. I mean...I live near SF, and love house, and I know 
that all 3 DJ's/producers/guys are excellent...it just makes sense!

Soon, I promise!!!

Subject: [sfraves] Marco's Mix Breaks me open !!!

Everynight I go to bed with my big studio monitor Sony V6 headphones
and my mini ipod. I  only listen to mixes, because I want to know that
a dj has seamlessly placed songs together in some meaningful fashion.
Often times this consists of ambient stuff (blue mars, redstick man
mixes, Drone Zone, Cafe Del Mar, Chilled euphoria) psy trance, and
progressive trance stuff (xtcradio, james holden, Sasha, Digweed).

Well I've had this mix by Marco for some time now, but I never really
listened to it because I knew it was breaks and breaks always makes me
feel like I've had sex for hours and I am not allowed to orgasm. It's
like, if the fucking DJ could just throw in a 4/4 for 30 seconds after
I've listened to this great break beat buildup for hours on end I
could be in eternal ecstacy, but that never happens with breaks.
Breaks is like a prog trance dj playing his most energy filled banging
records for the entire set instead of creating peaks and valleys.
Something I could listen to while on speed...

So anyway, last night I listened to Marco's mix while laying in bed
and I was completely moved. It was an awesome experience. that mix
seriously blew me away and I would love to hear you play live some
time. Even if you are Violet Beuregaurd's twin brother.

She's the stuck up girl that takes the everlasting Gobstopper in the
original Charlie and the chocolate factory and I only said that cause
of your Van Mundergaarde name, it sounds so similar or something.

I have no idea which mix I have, Adrianna gave it to me awhile back.

Looking forward to your next one.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Marco's Mix Breaks me open !!!

Well, thank you very much, the feedback is much appreciated.

If I can get a new one recorded, it'll make that mix look like ass cookies.

I have an old prog & breaks mix laying around you might really dig 
too...it's in a wierd format tho, and I have to mess around with it before I 
can rip copies...

Maybe some of you have heard of Acid Totem, maybe you haven't. About us:
We're a collective primarily focusing on outdoor renegades, day parties, an=
d
full moons with a focus on house music. We celebrated our 2 yr anniversary
this summer, and have had around 7 (I think, maybe more) successful parties
in 2005. As much as we love house, progressive, techno, etc, we really
wanted to open up the door for a much wider spectrum of music, so the theme
Rebel Sound was born. We will be digging deep into our crates and dusting
off our more obscure musical collections, as well as booking dj's you might
not otherwise hear at acid totem parties. Revelling in the warm days of
October's Indian summer, we've decided to to plan at least one more party
for 2005.
 Under the moon n stars, free as always
Sat. Oct 22, 2005
 Dave L (trip hop, house?)
Ben Haus (atmospheric drum n bass, dub, tribal rhythms)
more TBA
 All welcome
30 minute drive from SF
 If you would like more info on the party, please email me PERSONALLY, and =
I
can guide you to our modes of getting the word out. If you know Karina, I'm
sure she'll direct you in the appropriate direction as well. Enjoy :)
 -Ben

Sorry folks, but after posting our info to a few lists and due to us "using
so much network resources" (apparently from lots of people downloading the
free music sets at once) our webhost blocked our site all day yesterday.
Apologies if you tried to visit it and were denied.

Sure, sell us a website with 400gigs of transfer per month, then take it
down when it's actually getting used, nice. Always read the fine print,
kids!

Anyway, we had to pull a bunch of the sets that were getting linked to from
elsewhere to ease the load on the server for a bit, but the site is back up
and running.
 Feel free to poke around and get some info on Saturday's TWO special
guests, both of whom are doing LIVE PA's. It's gonna be a really fun show!
  Saturday night @ Rx Gallery in San Francisco
 [KONTROL] presents ORAC Records
 Caro + [a]pendics.shuffle - both performing LIVE.

  peace,

Subject: [sfraves] SRR: Homebase up in smoke

So as im watching the KTVU 10' oclock news and they did a blurb about the 
homebase on hegenberger being on fire. And from the live coverage it looks 
like the old home base and the "international rave center" AKA Vlad's 
homebase may be on fire as well.

Memories going up in smoke it is a shame

Dammit, I wanted to break the story!! I snoozed!

A part of me has died tonight, well kinda. I still have a ham-n-cheese 
sandwich stashed in the rafters, dammit ;-)

Homebase and I had a love/hate relationship, of sorts. I've had my most 
negatively shocking rave experiences there, as well as some wonderful 
memories.

Shall we have a moratorium/eulogy thread? I would love to hear everyone's 
stories as this legendary (yet equally shady) venue goes up in flames =)

"No sage or savior has ever endorsed greed and gluttony as a path  
toward social justice or personal fulfillment.  These sane and  
enlightened people come to us from all cultures and all eras,  
sometimes knowing of each other but more often not.  Socrates and  
Jesus, Lao Tzu and Tolstoi, Gandhi and Martin Buber -- no one can  
find in their lives and words a jot of support for a political and  
economic regime that encourages the acquisition of wealth far beyond  
what is needed for the necessaries -- or even the restorative  
pleasures -- of life while consigning the masses to live and work in  
squalor."
-Stephen J. Fortunato, Associate Justice, Rhode Island Supreme Court.

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of  
the rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will  
gradually become visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

planet rock parties
all the feel good parties like love-a-fair, mega-buzz, feel good forever, 
spirit of giving

the planet rock parties i remember being a little on the scary side, esp the 
hip hop big room.  a bunch of us ended up kinda hiding in the trance room 
b/c most of the thug-types we saw were not into trance at all.

the feel good parties i went to at home base were really fun overall.  i had 
a blast at one party dancing outside to happy kid marty's set.  good beats, 
no sweatbox, fun friends.

back in the olden days...

with love,
kriss  =)

My first and only party ever attended there was (I think the very first)
Metropolis. It was not too long after moving to the city, so I'd guess like
'99 or so? Not sure if that place was indeed the "Home Base" but I think it
was. It was definitely really BIG. As I recall, myself and a couple female
friends all ate some acid, had nothing else whatsoever to take the edge off=
,
and were all quite appalled at how drugged out (ironic, i know) and rude
everyone seemed to be. I think the music was pretty good though. I think I
remember seeing like Terry Mullan and Donald Glaude or something.
 Ahh, the good old days. I can't wait to tell "rave" stories to my
great-grandkids out on the front porch in my rocking chair.

oh yes... that Gathering was off the hook.

Dr. Alex Patterson closed out the chill room (armed with Mark Wayne's 
4-channel monstrosity, the "M2" sound system) with Orbital's Belfast.  
oh... my... god....  my girlfriend had to leave the room because it was 
just too intense for her!  the chill room itself was a huge den of 
fluff, with the decks in the middle of the room on a low table and a 
beanbag for the DJ.

it was PACKED to the gills, and the vibe was good... 4 sound systems if 
i remember correctly.

woo. good times - then it started getting sleazy...

bye home base!

who stands still moves backwards.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] SRR: Homebase up in smoke

Got a chance to introduce a friend of mine back in DC to Alex Patterson when 
he was opening for Juno Reactor, I think it was '99 or '00. My friend (who's 
massively inspired by The Orb) gave Alex some green clovers, and the guy was 
so humbled that fans would bother doing anything like that. It was a bit 
surreal sitting on a tour bus in front of what's now the Black Cat on 14th 
Street (near U Street) in DC, exchanging pleasantries and illicits w/ 
someone like that. Very cool guy...

Sorry for the totally pointless anecdote, lol.

planet rock parties
all the feel good parties like love-a-fair, mega-buzz, feel good forever,
spirit of giving

the planet rock parties i remember being a little on the scary side, esp the
hip hop big room.  a bunch of us ended up kinda hiding in the trance room
b/c most of the thug-types we saw were not into trance at all.

the feel good parties i went to at home base were really fun overall.  i had
a blast at one party dancing outside to happy kid marty's set.  good beats,
no sweatbox, fun friends.

back in the olden days...

with love,
kriss  =)

Please excuse the lurking, but I usually don't speak up unless I have something to impart - 
Sorry, no - Violet Beauregard is the girl who chews gum and becomes a blueberry. She eats the all-in-one gum, blows up, and the oompa loompas roll her away to be juiced. Veruca Salt is the spoiled girl who pockets the everlasting gobstopper earlier in the story, but she gets hers when she's sent to the incinerator for being a bad egg. Veruca Salt was then the adopted moniker of that cute chick band from a few years back - one or two hit wonder.
 
Just clarifying for the record..KF

I have no idea which mix I have, Adrianna gave it to me awhile back.

Looking forward to your next one.

Wow... So I guess I can de-lurk for this one. 

Home Base burning down brings back a lot of good
memories, a lot of bad ones... but most of all, just
memories about a time when the disconnect between
pparents, media, and children allowed us to do
whatever we wanted... where the excuses were simple
and believed, you couldn't track your kids via their
phone on internet, and fire marshalls signed your
occuopancy permits if you simply agreed to help their
kids through college.

Then came 20/20, lawyers, real fire marshalls, and the
end.

As far as "being a ho" or being in trouble again...
Whatchoo talkin 'bout Willis? I either don't get it
cause im too old, or am  missing something that y'all
are laughing at.

Nonetheless... my .02.

He was a fucking asshole in the first place
He got knocked to the floor

Batman beat the hell out of me and knocked me to the floor
I got back up and knocked him to the floor
He was being such a jackoff

Hey everyone the time is almost apon us. We have assembles 7 of the most
beloved crews in the bay for one special event. We have worked very hard to
make this the best event of the year. Please join us as we go mad!!!*
||||Mad Hatters Halloween Tea Party|||| *
*Room 1 (hosted by HCFTP, Nu Vision, DTS and Nocturnalisim)*
*GRIDLOK* (Project51/Violence Recordings-SF) As one of America's hardest
working producers and DJs, Gridlok has charted a steady, methodical path
into the vanguard of drum and bass. His tracks enjoy the support of drum an=
d
bass' finest, from Andy C to Bailey. His work ethic and tireless efforts to
advance the sonic breadth of the music have yielded tremendous dividends fo=
r
drum and bass fans worldwide. Recent releases on Project 51 and Violence
have become staples of countless major league DJs worldwide, and are huge
crowd favorites

*SUNRIZE* (Pitched Up Recordings/HCFTP/Blatant Beats UK-MA) - *Final Happy
Hardcore Perfomance* Since his first hardcore release in the spring of 2002=
,
he has released on a handful of labels, some including Pitched Up
Recordings, Blatant Beats, Destructive Force, Rave N Beats, and Madness &
Mayhem. This DJ's name has become unanimous with American Hardcore and has
played all across the country at events with artists like Scott Brown, DJ
SY, UFO, Brisk, and others. This will be his final performance as dj
sunrize. Don't miss the last chance to see him play happy hardcore.

*MAYHEM* (AZ Hardcore
Junkies.com/CompleteDJ.com<http://Junkies.com/CompleteDJ.com>)
vs. *vs. Second Base*In 2001, Steve Van Holton, better known to West Coast
hardcore fans as Mayhem, began playing records. His motivation? Simply to
listen to the music he loved by artists such as Digital Boy, Anger Fist,
Noize Supressor, Sonik, The Wish Master, Armageddon Project and The
Headbanger. Mayhem joined the Arizona Hardcore Junkies in 2003 only a shot
time after he began playing and in 2004 was asked to play Nocturnal
Wonderland in Los Angeles. Playing parties with the likes of Scott Brown,
Neophyte, Panic, Ophidian, Delta 9, D-passion and Dj delirium. The AZ
Hardcore Junkies expect big things to come from Mayhem in the near future.

the AXIS (The Doc & Arize)
Sideshow & Go-Zania & Leon Cook
Yagi & Reclipse
Happy Freaks (Hi-C, Kid Orange, & Cracker Jack)
2qt & Rye Bread

*Room 2 (Hosted by Zapatistas and Andy P)*

*DIG-DUG* (USC Events-WA) Known for his incredible track selection and
polished technical skills, DJ Dig-Dug has managed to develop an undeniably
unique style. While his sets often travel through several different types o=
f
breaks (Funky, Progressive, Dark), his underlying theme of warped basslines
and intelligent drum loops brings a sense of unity to his signature sound.
With his impressive beat juggling, cross-fader cutting, and creative but
tasteful use of the Pioneer DJM-600's onboard effects, DJ Dig-Dug has
developed a following based on skills, not hype.

*FilterGrinder* (Kontrast/Phat & Phunkie-TX) Doug Siebenthal, a.k.a.
Filtergrinder, has been djing for the last seven years. Filtergrinder
started producing techno when he met Bryan Cox in 2001. BC and Filtergrinde=
r
went on to produce the hit record "Alpine". Alpine (BC remix) got quick
recognition by DJ Dan and was featured on his Mixed Live DJ Dan, Ruby Skye
(Moonshine) CD. Both the original and the remix went on to have great
notoriety on BBC Radio One, and top rotation of such djs as Carl Cox,
Fergie, Joey Beltram, and Mauro Picotto. Filtergrinder currently resides in
the L.A. area as he continues to dj on a monthly basis and for the year of
2005, he is also launching Whiplash Records; the first release, "Rockin the
Disco", is coming out in March with the remix being done by Bryan Cox. You
can also expect other records from Filtergrinder in 2005 including
"Repeater" on the Afficinado label, with remixes from Granite & Phunk and
Carbon Community.

name early in the rave scene. Beginning with a party known as A Rave called
Sharon, Dutch's name spread quickly throughout SF. Known for seamless

Thanks again for those Quest parties, those were some of the best.

No intent from the 'HO' or 'trouble' comment. I just always knew you as a 
party guy, and you've told me some crazy stories =)

Subject: [sfraves] Event Photos


For all of those who are interested in seeing my event photos, for the 
first time in about four years, they are coming back online. This includes 
an archive of about 15 years worth of photographs. I am moving them to a 
new format and new site. If you are interested in knowing more, email me 
privately for details.

PS - It will take some time for me to upload 250 gigs worth of pictures, 
but it is worth it :)

Damn, for a second there, I saw the subject line and thought of both all 
the events I've been to there, and Cheech and Chong's up in smoke.... 
interesting combo in thought. That place has so much history, it tis a 
shame if this report is accurate - has any verified the accuracy yet?

If anyone has flyers or copies thereof for these events, I'd be happy to 
create a page on our site capturing said memories with our stories. Feel

Subject: [sfraves] Thanks for the homebase memories

As I watched a bit of the news again this morning and they said how they 
just let the fire burn it's self out and gut the "Home base" building I 
couldn't help to be a lil sad even though we all know Fully permitted 
parties are over in oak town. in the back of my mind I always thought that 
maybe some grand thing would fall out of the sky and some one would bring 
home base back again. But after that fire it makes it that much more surreal 
that homebase is truly gone forever now.

I attened the first and last party and "Gatherings" at that warehouse and 
all the ones in between alot of good times, watching Eric spire rock the am 
crowd at one of the quest's that he put together. Or Garth rocking the big 
room. And even watching the beloved Mars and Mystre play in a side hall. Im 
sure that hurt there ego a bit, And even having someone come up to me after 
playing there one night and ask if I was Derek may. Now that was an awesome 
compliement but I had to say no I wasn't the only thing that we have in 
common is that we are both black and not very tall. But all and all it was 
pretty good. It also meant the end of all night large warehouse parties 
which most of us at the time despised but you can't deny that having 10,000 
people rocking out to a DJ is a magnificent thing.

the Memories also reminded me of all the large spaces that can no longer be 
used due to politics or other issues  in the scene such as:

Richmond Civic (Awesome parties there Vision,come-unity,Cool world etc)
Richmond Armory (Tribal Funk, bagok tribe)
3@custer Now a recycling center (Cool word and a few others did parties 
there)
The movie stage on 3rd as well (Space Children,mind the gap)
Ceasars latin palace (FTT,A rave called sharon,mind the gap)
85@baldwin (Area 51,Space children etc) Awesome space with many memories
16@harrison (Wally world,Sin,SIN again, Juice FTT etc) okay space but was 
sketchy


I know there are alot more spaces im missing but I have to get back to work 
now :-)

If you read this far thanks for reading my ramblings!!

Closure indeed. At least it went out right! I'd rather see something as magnificant as H.B. go out in a ball of flames than rotting to the ground. 
 
peace

Subject: [sfraves] RIP event locales / venues that are no longer in use


I wanted to thank Macadio for his thoughts on Home Base. I definitely will 
miss that space as well. I wanted to add a few spots to this list - and 
create a thread for venues / spaces that are no longer in use - but once 
were. (See Below):

To add to this: (please correct me if these are not accurate) - some of 
these are not large spaces, or closed due to politics, but aren't used 
as much due to noise complaints, over-usage, or another reason) but are 
worthy to note due to the location / use in the past:

People's Park in Bezerkeley (parties in the park)
Berkeley Marina (there is an occasional renegade)
Maritime Hall
177 Townsend
Cactus Club in San Jose (It is in use as another venue, but not the same)
Hamburger Mary's (it is in use now, but not the same as before)
One Step Beyond in Santa Clara
Bonny Doon in Santa Cruz
Castle Rock in Santa Cruz
2nd and (Crack)Jackson in Oaktown
Spaz Warehouse in Berkeley
DV8, the Trocadero (reopened as the Glas Kat), and VSF/Oasis

Starcleaners, on Sycamore Street, Club Komotion, and the 17th and Capp and 
Shotwell warehouses, plus bars such as the Kilowatt, the Chameleon, and 
the Tip-Top Inn.

What happened to 550 Barneveld in SF?

Sofa Lounge in SJ, CA

To add to this: (please correct me if these are not accurate) - some of 
these are not large spaces, or closed due to politics, but aren't used 
as much due to noise complaints, over-usage, or another reason) but are 
worthy to note due to the location / use in the past:

People's Park in Bezerkeley (parties in the park)
Berkeley Marina (there is an occasional renegade)
Maritime Hall
177 Townsend
Cactus Club in San Jose (It is in use as another venue, but not the same)
Hamburger Mary's (it is in use now, but not the same as before)
One Step Beyond in Santa Clara
Bonny Doon in Santa Cruz
Castle Rock in Santa Cruz
2nd and (Crack)Jackson in Oaktown
Spaz Warehouse in Berkeley
DV8, the Trocadero (reopened as the Glas Kat), and VSF/Oasis

Starcleaners, on Sycamore Street, Club Komotion, and the 17th and Capp and 
Shotwell warehouses, plus bars such as the Kilowatt, the Chameleon, and 
the Tip-Top Inn.

What happened to 550 Barneveld in SF?

Just recently:

Sofa Lounge in SJ, CA

Oh, I've got one.  And best of all, it comes with a great tie-in to one 
of my favorite television shows.  I'm not going to bother to describe 
Mythbusters.  If you've seen it, you already know why it's so great.  
If you haven't, then do see it.  You'll love it.

Mythbusters is filmed mostly in San Francisco, and the surrounding Bay 
Area.  It's obvious, from watching the show, that they operate mostly 
out of somewhere in Portero Hill, but not exactly where from the brief 
outside shots of their workshop.

Last night, I followed a link from a Slashdot discussion to the 
Wikipedia article on the show, and from there to the site of Jamie 
Hyneman's "M5 Industries" workshop; where most of the indoor portions 
of the show (ie. When they don't have to remote-rig a car or blow 
anything big up.) take place.

The address looked familiar... damn familiar.  I used to live pretty 
close to that part of town.  But it turns out that wasn't why.  So, I 
plug the address into Google Maps and I see.  Turns out I've walked 
right past the place who-knows-how-many times on my way from the 
parking lot over by the community center to one of my absolute top 
favorites of the ex-rave-venues.

Myths are busted on the opposite side of the block from the old dance 
studio place @ Army and Connecticut!!!


cya,
john

'Rave' parties become mainstream

UPI News Service, 09/23/2005

The huge, often controversial techno dance parties of the 1980s and 1990s 
known as raves have gone mainstream.

ADVERTISEMENT
Not only are they no longer seen as threatening hotbeds of teenage drug 
use, but one of the nation's largest dance parties -- the Loveparade, 
which will be held in the Bay Area on Saturday -- is celebrated with a 
parade, the San Jose Mercury News reported.

"The rave crowd grew up," Ross Ivika, dance concert promoter and co-host 
of "House Nation" on KYLD-FM, told the newspaper.

More than 35,000 people attended the Loveparade festival last year. 
Corporate sponsors include Heineken, Friendster and iTunes.

"Techno has become more about the music, as opposed to something to listen 
to while on E (ecstasy)," said Ivika.

The culture "has come more above ground," said Robert Davis, executive 
director of the city and county of San Francisco's entertainment 
commission, which was created in response to events like raves.

Seconded. Thanks Macadio. : )
 
And though I certainly had, like Terry, a love-hate relationship with  
Homebase, you can't deny the profound impact it had on the scene during that  time 
period. If/when someone writes a book about our bay area rave  culture, 
homebase will certainly have it's own chapter. : )
 
When I first started partying in '98, I was caught by Son (aka BBoiBreaks)  
with a FeelGood flyer in my hands. He said to me, "Honey.. if the flyer is big  
enough to sit on- DON'T GO!"  
 
I stuck to it for the most part, so to record I can count the number  of 
massives I've been to on one hand, but I made a few exceptions, with  Homebases's 
Love Affair '99 and Megabuzz '99 being two of the  few.
 
 
Anyway, I can't believe no one has mentioned the space my first  party was 
at- J.J. Newberry's! Weee!
 
Good times. Any one remember that place? I remember being outside as we  
waited to pay and getting butterflies in my stomach as I noticed the  rebellious 
symbolism of all the windows blacked out with garbage bags. THUMP  THUMP THUMP. 
This was some underground shit. 
 
I was suddenly struck with the profound knowledge that when I  walked through 
those doors, I was going to be apart of something that would  make history. 
"Have fun," the doorman smiled. "The shits going off in there!  You're in for a 
good night!"
 
Oh, the enchantment of that first sight as I entered. I don't know  that you 
can truly capture the delicious experience that hits you as you  walk into 
your first rave. It's still etched in my head, over seven years  later.
 
I remember that at the time, my friends and I had no idea what the  painter's 
masks were for, but somehow we had the idea that people used them to  huff 
NO2. Oh, the naivety of newbies. ; )
 
And  well... fuck it. In remembrance of Homebase, I give you my  long-retired 
SFR sign-off:
 
TiCkLeS aNd GiGgLeS,
~*SwEeT PeA*~
 
RIP Homebase

Yes that's exactly how I feel.

Unfortunately for me, it's looking like none of my friends actually 
want to come, so I'll be looking for new ones there... :-) If anyone 
wants to pregame for a bit beforehand, hit me up. There's actually a 
free pre-party at Rx Gallery with the Kompakt folks from 6-10. That 
sounds pretty good to me...

A rave party, more often called a rave and sometimes called a free party, 
is typically an all-night dance event where DJs and other performers play 
electronic dance music and rave music. The slang expression rave was 
originally used by people of Caribbean descent in London during the 1960s 
to describe a party. In the late 1980s, the term began to be used to 
describe the subculture that grew out of the acid house movement that 
began in Chicago and flourished in the United Kingdom club scene.

The availability of drugs — particularly ecstasy — and/or alcoholic 
beverages have caused them to be targeted and criticized by law 
enforcement officials and parents' groups.

History

Mainstream raves began in the mid to late 1980s as a product of, reaction 
to, and rebellion against, trends in popular music, nightclub culture, and 
commercial radio.

In an effort to maintain distance and secrecy from the mainstream club 
scene (or perhaps for lack of affordable, receptive venues), warehouses, 
rental halls, and outside locations most often served as raves' venues. In 
an effort to control and curtail rave parties, some police and 
governmental bodies effectively outlawed raves in some areas. Such laws 
consequently forced regional electronic dance music events to move to 
formal venues, such as nightclubs and amphitheatres. Some venues and 
jurisdictions additionally prohibited certain types of rave fashion and 
paraphernalia.

Early raves were completely do it yourself; only a small number of people 
contributed to event production and promotion. Self-styled production and 
promotion companies have increasingly organized raves; the "companies" 
were usually unofficial or loosely defined. Some of the more well-known 
rave promotion companies have included Brotherhood of Boom, Mushgroove, 
Freebass Society, and Pure. The companies promote their events by creating 
and distributing fliers and online bulletins.

As law enforcement agencies increasingly began paying attention to raves, 
concealing a party's location became important to an event's success. To 
that end, event organizers sometimes either promoted events solely by 
word-of-mouth, or would only reveal the date and location of the event to 
subscribers of an electronic mailing list or via voicemail. Some even went 
so far as to provide a series of clues or map checkpoints that ultimately 
led to the location of the rave.
[edit]

1980s

What could arguably be called raves existed in the early 1980s in the 
Ecstasy-fueled club scene in clubs like NRG, and in the drug-free, 
all-ages scene in Detroit at venues like The Music Institute. However, it 
was not until the mid to late 1980s that a wave of psychedelic and other 
electronic dance music, most notably acid house and techno, emerged and 
caught on in the clubs, warehouses and free-parties of London and 
Manchester, England. These early raves were called the Acid House Summers. 
They were mainstream events that attracted thousands of people (up to 
25,000) to come, dance and take LSD.

The noise and disturbance of thousands of people appearing at rural 
locations caused outrage in the national media. The government branded 
them Public Enemy number 1 and made the fine for holding an illegal party 
£20,000 and six months in prison. This, along with ecstasy becoming 
scarce, ended the early raves.

Police crackdowns on these often-illegal parties drove the scene into the 
countryside. The word "rave" somehow caught on to describe these 
semi-spontaneous weekend parties occurring at various locations outside 
the M25 Orbital motorway. (It was this that gave Orbital their name.)

The early rave scene also flourished underground in some U.S. cities such 
as San Francisco and Los Angeles and as word of the budding scene spread, 
raves quickly caught on in other cities such as San Diego and New York 
City and in major urban centers across the European continent.
[edit]

1990s: United Kingdom

Raves began to expand into a global phenomenon around 1989-1992, mostly on 
a grassroots basis: people who had traveled to attend the first raves in 
each region began setting up promotion companies, often informally, to 
organize their own parties. By the mid-1990s, major corporations were 
sponsoring events and adopting the scene's music and fashion for their 
"edgier" advertising, making the scene become more commercialized.

In 1994, the United Kingdom's Criminal Justice Bill passed as the Criminal 
Justice and Public Order Act which contained several sections designed to 
suppress the growing free-party and anti-road protest movements (sometimes 
embodied by ravers and travellers).

Sections 63, 64 & 65 of the Act targeted electronic dance music, defining 
it as "wholly or predominantly characterised by the emission of a 
succession of repetitive beats". The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 
empowered police to arrest citizens who appeared to be: preparing to hold 
a rave (2 or more people), waiting for a rave to start (10+), or attending 
a rave (100+). Section 65 allows any uniformed constable who believes a 
person is on their way to a rave within a five-mile radius to stop them 
and direct them away from the area; noncompliant citizens may be subject 
to a maximum fine of £1,000.
[edit]

1990s: Europe

In Central Europe and other parts of the world, rave culture was becoming 
part of a new youth movement. DJs and electronic music producers such as 
Westbam proclaimed the existence of a "raving society" and promoted 
electronic music as legitimate competition for rock and roll. Indeed, 
electronic dance music and rave subculture became mass movements. Raves 
had tens of thousands of attendants, youth magazines featured styling tips 
and television networks launched music magazines on house and techno 
music. The annual Love Parade festivals in Berlin attracted more than one 
million partygoers between 1997 and 2000.
[edit]

2000s

In the early 2000s, the apparent number of illegal parties began to 
decline, and the number of sanctioned events seemed to be on the rise. The 
few constants in the scene include amplified electronic dance music, a 
vibrant social network built on the ethos of PLUR, percussive music and 
freeform dancing as a basis for drug use, and an ambivalent attitude 
toward "club drugs" such as ecstasy, methamphetamine, speed and Ketamine. 
However, increased cocaine usage, preponderance of adulterated ecstasy 
tablets and organized criminal activity has been detrimental to UK-based 
rave culture, although free parties are now on the rise again.

According to some long-time observers, rave music and its subculture began 
to stagnate by the end of the 1990s. The period of grassroots innovation 
and explosive growth and evolution was over; the flurry of passionate 
activity and the sense of international community were fading.

By the early 2000s, the terms "rave" and "raver" had fallen out of favor 
among many people in the electronic dance music community, particularly in 
Europe. Many Europeans returned to identifying themselves as "clubbers" 
rather than ravers. It became unfashionable among many electronic dance 
music aficionados to describe a party as a "rave", perhaps because the 
term had become bastardized. Some communities preferred the term 
"festival", while others simply referred to "parties". True raves, such as 
"Mayday", continued to occur for a time in Central Europe, with less 
constrictive laws allowing raves to continue in some countries long after 
the death of rave in the United Kingdom. Moreover, traditional rave 
paraphernalia, such as facemasks and pacifiers, ceased to be popular.

Raves and ravers continued to be villified by government authorities. For 
example, following a July 2005 violent raid by police on CzechTek, an 
annual techno music festival, the Czech Republic's Prime Minister said the 
festival's attendees were "no dancing children but dangerous people" and 
that many were "obsessed people with anarchist proclivities and 
international links," who "provoke massive violent demonstrations, fuelled 
by alcohol and drugs, against the peaceful society". [1]

As with any trend that runs on for more than a decade, the Rave scene has 
recently been harking back to the old days of warehouse parties, with a 
surge in "old school" club nights, particularly in the Jungle scene, with 
DJs and producers who had dropped out of the business playing sets of 
music from the founding days of their genre, and producing new records in 
that style. Clubs are increasingly going back to the grimy days of 
warehouses in terms of styling, rather than the interior designed venues 
of the late 90s.

Rave culture in the USA
 	The examples and perspective in this article do not represent a 
world-wide view.
Please improve the article or discuss the issue on the talk page.

The upsurge in popularity of rave culture in the United States at a 
certain period in time often lends it characteristics common to a 
'movement' or Subculture. Although raves have existed in the United States 
as long as in any other country, the sudden explosion of mainstream 
popularity in the late nineties has lead to more common approaches to 
defining rave culture as a youth movement, in way which would not be 
possible in the UK or Europe due to a greater diversity amongst 
participants, countries and musical styles. Accordingly, many of the 
descriptions listed below are only appropriate to groups within the USA, 
and may even constitute generalisations within the US itself.

Although not universally agreed upon by those in the rave movement, some 
of the central tenets of the culture are said to be:

     * Openness: to not judge, condemn, or label other people's style of 
clothes, hair, makeup, costume, sexual orientation, musical preference, 
race, age, gender, class or income.
     * Acceptance: to not try to convince anyone of the rightness or 
wrongness associated with most human activities.
     * Positivism: to subscribe to the notion that if something makes 
someone happy without hurting someone else, then that something is okay. 
As such, fights or scuffles at a rave are rare.

Although not a constant among all ravers, one philosophy of rave culture 
is expressed through the acronym "PLUR", for Peace, Love, Unity, Respect. 
The concept itself is found particularly irritating by a large number of 
clubgoers, many of whom have been hoping the concept will fade into 
antiquity, to be replaced by better marketing terminology for positivist 
thinking, at some later date. As of yet the new terminology is still 
unknown, but we're hoping it comes on soon.

Ravers have been compared to both the hippies of the 1960s and new wavers 
of the 1980s due to their interest in non-violence and music.

Technology is inherently central to electronic music, and technological 
innovation has influenced rave subculture in many ways. For example, since 
loud music made it difficult to converse at raves, virtual communities 
were extremely important in rave subculture. Also, access to various 
affordable computer technologies empowered amateurs to compose or 
manipulate electronic music.

On rave parties doing dance tricks of all kinds is very popular. However 
these tricks are not always non-dangerous and can sometimes lead to 
damages, so they are not always tolerated by the organizers of the rave. 
What kind of tricks are allowed and what not differs from party to party.

In opposite to other youth cultures the rave scene is not deterrent for 
older people, which is noticeable by the fact, that there are not so few 
older people visiting technoparades.
[edit]

Types of ravers

Loosely defined terms generated by the rave community. They are 
generalized and not conclusive, complete, nor necessarily current.

     * Old school raver - refers to someone who has been a raver for some 
time, whereas a baby raver or a newbie refers to someone who is new to 
raving or at their first rave. Hardcore ravers are sometimes called pure 
ravers or true ravers or partykids. Something can be rave or have 
raveness.

     * Jaded raver - one who has been in the rave scene for a long time or 
someone who is growing tired of 'the scene' and raving. The newness of the 
experience has long ago worn off and they have noticed the seamier side. 
They may be pissed off at what the raving experience has become or they 
may be lackadaisical to certain aspects of raving that they once held a 
fondness for. Quite often a jaded raver will not appreciate the influx of 
new ravers into the scene because the new ravers are viewed as 
contributing to the scene's decay.

     * Club kid - tends to dress in bright colors and flashy, sometimes 
gaudy clothes, including leather and fur. They might also favor 
fluorescent plastic bead necklaces and candy bracelets. Many club kids 
also wear children's’ backpacks. Male club kids tend to dress in a more 
feminine manner. In some localities, a club kid is viewed as an outsider.

     * Candy raver/candykid - often wears brightly colored and child-like 
fashions such as day-glo wide leg pants, black light reactive or 
glow-in-the-dark bracelets/necklaces and t-shirts featuring cartoon 
characters. They wear homemade bracelets and necklaces made of plastic, 
glass, or felt beads or candy. Candy ravers or candykids are often found 
exchanging or giving out small gifts. These small gifts will usually be 
hugs, toys, glowsticks, drugs, CDs, necklaces, bracelets, and/or candy.

     * Liquid dancer - a person who performs liquid dancing (a fluid 
gesticulation of the arms and body)

     * Junglist refers to an urban-based sub-culture of the rave scene 
defined by Drum and Bass (DnB) / Jungle music. Junglists often detest 
mainstream rave music and prefer darker and deeper vibes. Hostility 
between ravers and junglists has lead to a disconnect between the two 
groups. Many junglists refuse to refer to themselves as 'ravers' because 
of the drug connotations and the rave style of dress and attitude. Many 
junglists were once doe-eyed ravers or even candy kids who, after becoming 
jaded, left that part of the scene.

[edit]

Glowsticking

Some ravers participate in a light-oriented dance called glowsticking, and 
a similar dance called glowstringing, or poi. These dances, however, are 
independent of the raving community, and often the stereotyped association 
may be resented. Glow sticks in the dark stimulate the pupils and it is 
claimed that they relieve the effects of Ecstasy. Therefore at some rave 
places they are presented as "safety materials". On the other hand, in 
some cases the sales of glow sticks during rave parties was presented as a 
proof of illegal drug use. Glow sticks have been considered drug 
paraphernalia because they are used in "blowing (someone) up," or giving 
someone on Ecstasy a "light show." The recipient of the "light show" sits 
or stands facing the show giver who moves the glow sticks away and towards 
the face of the recipient in various stylized movements. This lightshow is 
sometimes accompanied by a facial massage and/or by blowing mentholated 
vapors into the nose, mouth, and eyes of the recipient. This is intended 
to increase the effects of Ecstasy.

However glowsticks can be used on most raves for interesting dancing 
effects, because most raves, except of some open air raves as 
technoparades are in dark or nearly dark rooms. Because rave parties are 
popular at people with intensions to show dances, the use of glowsticks 
can give material for creative freestyle dance.
[edit]

Drug use

In the U.S. the subculture has been branded by the mainstream media and 
law enforcement agencies as a purely drug-centric culture similar to the 
hippies of the 1960s. As a result, ravers have been effectively run out of 
business in many areas (Media Awareness Project). Although they continue 
in major coastal cities like New York and LA, and notably the Winter Music 
Conference in Florida, most other areas have been relegated to 
word-of-mouth-only underground parties and nightclub events. In some parts 
of Europe, raves are common and mainstream, although they are now more 
often known as "festivals," highlighting multiple acts over a whole day 
period, and often including non-dance music acts.

Groups that have addressed drug use at raves include the Electronic Music 
Defence and Education Fund (EMDEF) and DanceSafe, which advocate harm 
reduction approaches. Paradoxically, drug safety literature (such as those 
distributed by DanceSafe) are used as evidence of condoned drug use (EMDEF 
press release). Other groups, such as Drug Free America Foundation, Inc., 
characterize raves as being rife with gang activity, rape, robbery, and 
drug-related deaths. [2]

In 2005, Antonio Maria Costa, Executive Director of the United Nations 
Office on Drugs and Crime, advocated drug testing on highways as a 
countermeasure against drug use at raves[3].

Wikipedia for "rave music"

Rave music
>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

Rave music consists of forms of electronic music for dancing that are 
associated with the rave scene. Most often, it is used to describe techno 
music that depends heavily on samples and is high energy, upbeat, and 
dance inducing.

Rave music got its start in Britain in the mid 1980s, closely following 
the acid house phenomenon. Initially "rave music" was considered a 
particular style that was a combination of fast breakbeat and more 
hardcore forms of techno. Early 1990s efforts by Nebula 2, The Prodigy 
(The Prodigy Experience), Utah Saints and The Shamen (En-Tact) were 
quintessential "rave music".

By the early 2000s, the term was used more generically to mean any one of 
a number of different styles (or combinations thereof) that might be 
played at a rave party. In this sense, rave music is more associated with 
an event than a particular genre, per se. At a rave there can be different 
"arenas" or areas which play different styles of rave music. Very large 
raves called massives may include ten or more separate arenas, each with 
their own music style.

Raver styles of music continue to grow and evolve. Some genres and an 
iconic artist include (not an exhaustive list):

     * house styles: progressive house - John Digweed, Bad Boy Bill
     * trance - Armin van Buuren, Ferry Corsten, DJ Tiësto, Paul van Dyk
     * Goa trance - Hallucinogen, Astral Projection
     * drum and bass/jungle - Andy C, Goldie, Dieselboy
     * breaks - The Chemical Brothers, The Prodigy, Adam Freeland, Baby 
Anne
     * hardcore techno styles - Happy hardcore, Hardcore trance, Gabba, 
Luke Slater, Dave Clarke

Non-dance styles which might be heard in a rave "chill-out" room include:

     * ambient music - Brian Eno, Harold Budd, The Orb
     * IDM - Aphex Twin, Autechre

Some ravers are selective between genres, showing little or no interest in 
one area while finding great satisfaction and joy in another. House often 
has roots in funk and disco while trance has its roots in new age and 
symphonic music. Many DJs mix genres, remix existing sounds, or leave 
electronic music entirely.

A new form of rave is appearing based on the genre "Makina" mainly 
produced in spain but also in Italy, Germany and France, it has exploded 
in the North East of England with many clubs and all night raves.

RAVE Act
>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

The RAVE Act (an acronym for 'Reducing Americans' Vulnerability to 
Ecstasy') was a bill (S.2633) proposed, but not passed, during the 107th 
US Congress [1]. It was later passed (S.226) as the Illicit Drug 
Anti-Proliferation Act during the 108th US Congress, mostly unchanged and 
backed by the same sponsors.[2] The original RAVE Act attracted a fair 
amount of attention and protest within the electronic music community, and 
although the act was ultimately passed under a different name, the term 
"RAVE Act" is quite well known and will be used in this discussion.

The original bill was introduced by Senator Joe Biden (D-DE) in 2002. The 
key provisions of the RAVE Act are modifications to the US Code (22 USC 
856) [3], creating new civil penalties for owners or users of property 
upon which illegal drug trafficking activities are conducted. In 
particular, defendants could be fined up to $250,000, or double their 
gross receipts, whichever is greater.

The announced intent of the RAVE Act was to stem the distribution of 
controlled substances. However, opponents have argued that the bill 
unfairly depicts "rave culture" as so inseparable from "drug culture" as 
to legitimize the former as a target of drug enforcement. The Act is 
considered by some in the rave and electronic music community to be 
evidence of a "moral panic" regarding raves.

Opponents' complaints against the RAVE Act included:

     * It is worded broadly enough that virtually any person conducting a 
trade at a rave could be liable under the law, including such innocuous 
activities as selling, or even handing out for free, bottled water. In 
particular, the 'Offenses' section of the original bill introduced 
language making it a violation to "profit from, or make available for use, 
with or without compensation, [any] place for the purpose of [...] using a 
controlled substance".

     * Along the same lines, it could be considered to criminalize and thus 
discourage harm reduction measures, such as distributing condoms or 
offering testing of possibly illicit drugs to determine if they are some 
other, potentially dangerous, substance. Under this interpretation, if 
rave organizers accept the likelihood that some ravers will take Ecstasy 
no matter whether it is condoned or discouraged, the organizers must face 
a choice of: knowing drug use will happen and not making any preparations 
for it; making harm reduction measures such as chill-out rooms available 
but operating them at a loss; or making harm reduction measures available 
and facing the prospect of being prosecuted for them.

     * It fails to distinguish between illegally and legally conducted 
raves, or for that matter, concerts or events of any kind. A common 
speculation in the electronic music community was that the Act could be 
used to fine a concert promoter for "allowing" an illicit marijuana 
transaction during a concert, even if the promoter took security measures 
to prevent such transactions from taking place.

Rebuttals to these complaints included:

     * The Act does not criminalize any of these activities. Defendants 
could be fined, perhaps substantially, but would not face jail time for 
breaking the law.

     * The RAVE Act includes "knowingly and intentionally" in its language, 
which would seem to put the burden of proof on the government in any such 
case. It would thus not imply penalties for the mere presence of vendors 
at an event where drug trafficking takes place.

The original RAVE Act (but not the eventually passed bill) contained a 
"Findings" section which stated the findings of Congress as reasons to 
pass the bill. The Findings section was rather harsh and sweeping in its 
indictment of raves in general, and was likely the cause of much of the 
outcry over the bill in the rave community. Point 4 of this section 
implied that providing security for a rave was an attempt to portray an 
unsafe event as safe:

     [Rave promoters] even go so far as to hire off-duty, uniformed police 
officers to patrol outside of the venue to give parents the impression 
that the event is safe.[4]

This did not address the fact that hiring off-duty police officers for 
security is a practice common to many social gatherings, or the 
possibility that rave organizers might be hiring such security not just to 
create an appearance of safety but to actually provide a safer 
environment. Point 6 was undoubtedly a source of concern for rave vendors:

     Because rave promoters know that Ecstasy causes the body temperature 
in a user to rise and as a result causes the user to become very thirsty, 
many rave promoters facilitate and profit from flagrant drug use at rave 
parties or events by selling over-priced bottles of water and charging 
entrance fees to 'chill-rooms' where users can cool down.[5]

The "Findings" section was eventually deleted from the Act as passed, and 
Senator Biden was careful to explain why:

     Critics of the bill have also claimed that it would provide a 
disincentive for promoters to take steps to protect the public health of 
their patrons including providing water or air conditioned rooms, making 
sure that there is an ambulance on the premises, etc. That is not my 
intention. And to underscore that fact, I plan to remove the findings, 
which is the only place in the bill where these items are mentioned, from 
the bill. Certainly there are legitimate reasons for selling water, having 
a room where people can cool down after dancing, or having an ambulance on 
hand. Clearly, the presence of any of these things is not enough to 
signify that an event is "for the purpose of" drug use.[6]

Is that one on the corner of a street with a REALLY low ceiling on the
second floor?

I've been to a couple parties at both E. 11 and 8th, as well as 11th
and E. 8th, and can't keep them straight.

Still canâ€™t believe Home Base is actually gone. Ah man I have so many memories there. My first party there was metropolis back in 99, I remember those days like it was yesterday. I was playing Zelda on N64 when my sister asked me if I wanted to go with her to a party, I was like wtf. She then told me there was going to be music lots of people and it would all be fun. I was still reluctant to go at first, but after days of talking I finally decided to go with her. I spent the whole day b4 Metropolis making beads and what not with my sis and her friend. Her friend made me like these beaded star glasses type things, so after that we knocked out and got ready for the day. I got up the following morning and started playing my video games for a good bit till I had to get ready for the party. Me, my sis, her friend and my mom all went up to Frisco to post up before Metropolis. My mom just drove us she didnâ€™t go into the party with us. So we posted up, walking around the city till its
 time to head out to the party. When we got there I was just blown away by everything I saw, from the entrance to the inside of the party. I thought it was kind of weird at first that there was a group of adults with pacifiers in their mouths}8^). People buckin in the corners, crap loads of people dancing to the music just about anything you could think of you saw it. Thatâ€™s what I like about parties, you got a sense of freedom everyone was kick back, and you can be yourself. It was like an adventure I got lost then found my sister, then got lost again then found her again. Itâ€™s the memories of the scene the memories of the parties Iâ€™ve been to that kept me going. Was always nice to go to a party to hear the Dj lay it down. Seeing that video trips me out. That place is gone, I wonder what they going to do with that area now.

Memories going up in smoke it is a shame

Ahhhh big flyers....at least they're good for a few things...fanning
yourself off, protecting your nice clean phat pants from floor covered in
rave slime, sheilding your eyes from the sun...etc. I remember when i first
started to see the huge ass flyers up in Portland back in 97 i think. Up
until then i had only really ever come across smallish pocket sized flyers.
Usually they were hand drawn and photo copied, occasionally you'd come
across an actual flyer where the graphic were still pretty minimal and
cheesy, but you got the info. One night at an outdoor party in the middle o=
f
nowhere, my friend and i took a few hits of acid and were having a good
time. We were getting flyers all through out the party, and i started to
notice that each flyer was getting a little bigger then the flyer before it=
.
It wasn't too long before i turned to my friend and mentioned my new
discovery, and cracked a joke about how the flyers can't get any bigger.
They were getting to be almost too big to fit in to the huge packets of my
raver pants. No sooner had i said that, i turned around and was face to fac=
e
with another person handing me a flyer. This wasn't a flyer, It was a book.
It was a flyer to Cyberfest (if i remember correctly). My jaw hit the floor
and my friend and i stared at each other in awe. We were starting to wonder
if the huge size was all in our acid laced minds. We started to flip throug=
h
the many pages of this flyer. I think it was like 6 or 7 pages of
almost 8.5"x11"
paper. It was insane. We couldnt believe it and of course right in the mids=
t
of our bewilderment we saw spot lights sweeping back and forth across the
crowd. Awwwww shit here come the Po Po's. This being my friends first "rave=
"
he wasnt sure what to make of this and started to walk back to the car
dragging me along with. I had to grab his arm and tell him to calm down and
to not freak out like that cause it'll just make things worse. They probabl=
y
weren't going to do anything but tell everyone to go home. We stuck it out =
a
little to see what was going on, and thankfully all they came to do was to
make the party kids put out the fire they had created to keep warm. Once
that was out, they left and we continued to dance the night away.
 Anyway, that was the day i knew the face of raving was altered forever.
Flyers big enough to make for decent reading and wallpapering. crazy acid
shit man...crazy acid shit.

I love the music from previous decades such as the 70s and 80s. I also enjoy listening to 1940s music on XM satellite radio.
 
So today I was listening to some older 80s tracks on minidisc (a format that did not take off in the US). Specifically, I heard Alison Moyet (formerly of Yazoo) singing, “Honey for the Bees” and “Love Resurrection.” When she was with Yazoo she sang that popular song, “Situation” from the album Upstairs At Eric's (1982). It went something like this:
 
Blue eyed dressed for every situation
Moving through the doorway of a nation

Alison Moyet has a new album, Voice (US release date: 6 September 2005). It has a light classical sound backed by an orchestra and arranged by a movie composer. You could say this is a disco-pop diva dream come true, an album recorded in front of an orchestra.
 
I also pulled out the soundtrack for Footloose, and listened to the title track by Kenny Loggins. What fun it was to hear this again! 
"You can fly if you’d only cut loose, footloose; Kick off your Sunday shoes"
Kenny Loggins is touring the country with Messina and he has a relatively new album, too (It’s About Time, release date 2003).
 
Finally, I had to hear “Self Control” by Laura Brannigan, a good dance song that didn’t make it far. However, Laura Brannigan almost made it to #1 on the Billboard pop chart in 1982 with a song called “Gloria.” You probably know this one:
Gloria!
I think they got your number!
I think they got the alias 
that you've been living under!
 
Back in the 80s, she was all over TV, promoting that song, pushing her arm up into the air, punctuating the beats. Laura died in her sleep in 2004 from a brain aneurysm, very sad to lose such talent.
 
I can remember dancing around the house to these tracks but now they seem a little old-fashioned--I still enjoy them, but I realize my tastes have moved on to harder or progressive beats from genres like D&B or house and so on.

Dance on,
GregVP

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Dancing Friday?

Thanks to blooshaman for suggesting Supperclub tonight (which is only 
10 bucks), but I already bought a 20 dollar ticket for Miss Kittin at 
Mezzanine, as suggested by bird415.  Yikes!  20 bucks!  but I went to 
her website

http://www.misskittin.com/noises/frameset.html

and listened to the Autumn 2004 mix.  The Summer Mix 2005 starts out 
with a long, tedious ostinato that annoyed me without turning me on, so 
I moved to an earlier mix, and Summer 2004 rewarded me well.  It is the 
first DJ mix I've ever heard that gives me honest pleasure as pure 
music all the way through a whole CD.  Ah, I am revealing myself as a 
newbie and stuffy academic...  but anyway, I decided Miss Kittin's 
worth the 20 bucks, and am really stoked about the show tonight.  
Thanks for the tip, Greg!   -BlueFire

Her voice is awesome.  I loved her stuff.  Too bad they don't make records
anymore.  Vince Clark should gather her up and release another Yaz album.
Classic..

I love the music from previous decades such as the 70s and 80s. I also enjoy
listening to 1940s music on XM satellite radio.
 
So today I was listening to some older 80s tracks on minidisc (a format that
did not take off in the US). Specifically, I heard Alison Moyet (formerly of
Yazoo) singing, "Honey for the Bees" and "Love Resurrection." When she was
with Yazoo she sang that popular song, "Situation" from the album Upstairs
At Eric's (1982). It went something like this:
 
Blue eyed dressed for every situation
Moving through the doorway of a nation
Pick me up and shake the doubt, baby I can't do without
(Move out) don't mess around, (move out) you bring me down
(Move out) how you get about, don't make a sound, just move out
 
Alison Moyet has a new album, Voice (US release date: 6 September 2005). It
has a light classical sound backed by an orchestra and arranged by a movie
composer. You could say this is a disco-pop diva dream come true, an album
recorded in front of an orchestra.
 
I also pulled out the soundtrack for Footloose, and listened to the title
track by Kenny Loggins. What fun it was to hear this again! 
"You can fly if you'd only cut loose, footloose; Kick off your Sunday shoes"
Kenny Loggins is touring the country with Messina and he has a relatively
new album, too (It's About Time, release date 2003).
 
Finally, I had to hear "Self Control" by Laura Brannigan, a good dance song
that didn't make it far. However, Laura Brannigan almost made it to #1 on
the Billboard pop chart in 1982 with a song called "Gloria." You probably
know this one:
Gloria!
I think they got your number!
I think they got the alias 
that you've been living under!
 
Back in the 80s, she was all over TV, promoting that song, pushing her arm
up into the air, punctuating the beats. Laura died in her sleep in 2004 from
a brain aneurysm, very sad to lose such talent.
 
I can remember dancing around the house to these tracks but now they seem a
little old-fashioned--I still enjoy them, but I realize my tastes have moved
on to harder or progressive beats from genres like D&B or house and so on.

Dance on,
GregVP

Yaz and Yazoo are both correct, and are the same band. Yazoo was their
original name in the UK, but when they were marketed in the US their name
was changed to Yaz for some reason.
 Upstairs at Eric's =3D essential listening.

--=====================_974046==.ALT

Dear Friends of Erowid,

This Announcement message (#60, Oct 14 2005) can be read online at:
http://www.erowid.org/general/announce/announce60_10-14-05.shtml

One of Erowid's two main laptops died last week.  We're now in
need of a functional laptop in the very short term and can't afford
to buy one.  We're asking whether someone in the community
might have a notebook computer less than three or four years old
that they would consider donating to Erowid.

This machine would be used by Sylvia, one of Erowid's three key crew
members and Contributing Editor of Erowid Extracts.  The machine needs
to be fairly recent as it will be used for HTML, SSH, Photoshop,
InDesign, Office, Firefox, and (the biggest resource hog) Eclipse.  It
could be either Windows or Macintosh, but it needs to meet the
following specs:

Minimum Requirements:
--------------------------------------
1) 700 MHz or faster CPU
2) 256 MB RAM (or expandable to that size)
3) 1024 x 768 + screen resolution
4) 2+ hours of battery life or ability to expand
5) 20 GB hard drive
6) Wireless capability or open PCMCIA slot
7) Functioning audio in and out
8) Ability to run WinXP or OSX.4
9) External VGA / Monitor hookup
10) Under 7 pounds, including battery

Preferred Requirements
--------------------------------------
1) 1 GHz+ CPU
2) 1 GB RAM (or expandable to that size)
6) Wireless built in (not PCMCIA)
10) Under 6 pounds including battery

The machine would used for working on Erowid remotely, transcribing
interviews, researching and editing documents, and managing volunteers.
This would often be Sylvia's main interface to the world, so something
that works well is important.  We're happy to reinstall the OS, upgrade
RAM, and do other light upgrades and maintenance.

We need to find something in the next month and need help making
that happen.  If you have a notebook you're not using or are looking for
an excuse to upgrade yours, please reply to this email or contact
donations@erowid.org.

Thanks for your support,
Earth, Fire, & Sylvia

it was due to legal reasons.  there was a horrible R+B band
that was named yazoo already, and of course, stupidity ensued.

i actually have the 'situation' 12" with their original name...

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Cool Laser and pyro massive video

Anyone have any similar links depicting VJ projections
at parties and/or VJs in action?  This is for a friend
that's doing research on VJing and music
visualization.  The lasers and pyro are cool, but he's
looking more for visuals generated by computers and
especially those derived from software using signal
analysis, beat tracking, etc.

(FYI this is him
http://cogweb.ucla.edu/Abstracts/Benzon_01.html)

Thanks,

Peter

anyone wants, but i figured this was the one we were
yappin' about...

there's a couple demos I did for out of town stuff too
up there, one breaks and the other big funky house...
feel free to check 'em out ;)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Cool Laser and pyro massive video

Unfortnately most of the VJ videos out there are reels
of 2D and 3D media created by the VJs rather than
video of people at a party interacting with the
graphics and sound.  The original laser/pyro clip was
really good at showing how the display worked in the
context of the party I thought.  If you check out
Bill's previous book, you'll see that he's interested
in how the way music interacts with the mind impacts
its social effects etc.  Its that aspect of VJing,
where its really an integral part of the experience of
the party, that I've been trying to tell him about.

Regards,

Peter

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Last chance to download this mix!!!

No there's not - those Smithmonger tracks are 4x4 stormers (if I am thinking 
of the right tracks).

I'm loving that so many breaks producers are doing 4 on the floor as well 
now. You get that breakbeat funk + chunkiness + a 4x4 stomp. Genius. And 
those tracks are great for folks like myself that like to transition back 
and forth between 4x4 and a break....

SWEET!

I will be happy to add that to the list... It just reminded me of another

Positively Malachy
The godfather of Bay Area rave and house culture speaks.
By Amanda Nowinski

HUNDREDS OF CARS left the city well past midnight on Monday, March 8, 
1993, in search of the Full Moon rave. By 3 a.m., alongside Highway 1, 
we'd found it.

Equipped with nothing more than water, blankets, and smokes, we stood at 
the edge of the cliffs at Bonny Doon, gazing down at the swirling masses 
of people on the beach. We were buzzing with anticipation as we raced down 
the sand cliffs, guided only by the white light of the moon and a few 
raging bonfires. Boom. Boom. Boom. Like magic, the sound system kicked in, 
and everyone on the beach simultaneously jumped to their feet. At last, 
the house music ceremony could begin.

It was, all in all, a typically wild full moon night. Dancers and drummers 
pounded the sand flat as cement around the makeshift DJ booth as dogs 
frolicked, naked people dipped into the ocean, and groups of friends and 
strangers gathered by fires and tents, all united by this new, 
euphorically pagan experience. We felt acutely alive. People held hands 
and shared water, cigarettes, jackets, joints, blankets – whatever was 
needed, someone would surely provide. We were highly conscious of being in 
this moment together, although we didn't know exactly what it all meant.

As the sun rose we collected our belongings and posses, kissed everyone 
good-bye, and struggled up the cliffs. We sat in silence riding back to 
the city, exhausted and entirely content.

Later that morning, Malachy O'Brien, a founder of the Full Moon and 
Come-Unity parties, searched for his ride back to the city. It had already 
left. So Malachy helped the remaining crew carry the sound system up to a 
van. After the vehicle was packed, Malachy and his dog Una climbed into 
the back, directly behind the sound system and generator. The van puttered 
away toward the city.

Strange how fate operates.

"I always wonder why it all happened," says Malachy, from inside his 
small, windowless room on the ground floor of a South of Market warehouse. 
But on that particular morning, nearly seven years ago, as Malachy and the 
other passengers in the van nodded off, so did the driver. The van tumbled 
off the road, right near the exit to Candlestick Park – ironically, the 
site of previous Full Moon raves. The van rolled into a mudflat and the 
sound equipment tumbled onto Malachy, crushing his spine and neck, leaving 
him paralyzed. "I tried moving my hands, but it was like I was in thick 
oil, or underwater," he recalls. "I couldn't move my arms, but I could in 
my imagination. To this day I still do that – I can feel my toes and feet 
moving but they're actually not."

When the paramedics arrived, they carefully removed Malachy from the van. 
Una dashed out onto the freeway and was instantly hit and killed.

Word of the accident shot through the underground faster than wildfire. "I 
was staying at S.F. General, and the doctors complained that too many 
people were showing up to support me," he smiles. "At the time I didn't 
have enough energy to talk to people, but it helped me through, knowing 
that people were out there dancing for me." Members of the Wicked, 
Gathering, Full Moon, and Come-Unity parties immediately threw a benefit 
for Malachy, who does not have health insurance to this day. "Being the 
New Age hippie that I am, I could really feel the energy during that 
benefit party. They had hooked up an early Internet mechanism that allowed 
me to hear the party, and people came on and gave me messages throughout 
the night. I swear the next day my finger moved a little bit."

Along with his partners, DJ Simon and Kosmic Jason, Malachy helps organize 
the monthly Come-Unity party at Ten 15 Folsom. The monthly club night is 
the longest-running house party in northern California and is Malachy's 
sole source of income. Later this month he and fellow native of Ireland 
Ciaran O'Hara will release a double-CD compilation, Unity, which will 
serve as a benefit for Malachy – who faces eviction in January and needs a 
new electric wheelchair, which can cost up to $20,000. The Unity 
compilation features a host of local and international talent, including 
Orbital (who donated an exclusive Sasha remix of the track "Belfast"), Doc 
Martin and DJ Buck, Dubtribe, Single Cell Orchestra, Garth, Simon, Onionz, 
and Scott Hardkiss, to name a few. The CDs are mixed by DJs Tony and 
Simon, and capture the psychedelic, funkier sides of house, as well as the 
tranced-out, jungled-up sides of just plain buggin' out music.

Malachy's contribution to the birth of the Bay Area's house and rave scene 
began in 1991 and is chronicled in Simon Reynolds's book Generation 
Ecstasy: Into the World of Techno and Rave Culture. A native of Cookstown, 
Northern Ireland, Malachy moved to San Francisco in 1989 from Manchester, 
England, where he was studying computer science. Once in S.F., he soon 
found a job bar backing at Ten 15 Folsom, where he worked with a few other 
future rave progenitors, including Preston (who helped start Toon Town, 
the city's first major mixed-gay-and-straight house club), as well as his 
Come-Unity partners, Simon and Kosmic Jason. Talk about back in the day.

By 1991 the house scene was just starting to kick off, at parties like 
Osmosis at the old DV8, Sundays at Mission Rock, Colossus, Love, Mr. 
Floppy's Flop House, and Do Not Sit on the Furniture. Malachy, who had 
witnessed the beginning of rave culture in England, was ready to take it 
to the next step: outdoors.

"I was working at Ten 15, and one night word got out that we would do a 
party at Baker Beach," he recalls. "There were only 50 or 60 people that 
night. The DJ decks were set on a crate, and Jëno had to kneel down in a 
hole in the sand. It was very renegade."

Soon Malachy joined forces with the Wicked posse (Marky, Garth, and Jëno), 
and Martin O'Brien of the Gathering, and set the Full Moon parties on 
their full-scale, legendary path. That same year, he and Simon also 
launched the Come-Unity parties at Ten 15 Folsom, which Malachy viewed as 
a communal, peaceful platform for his eco-spiritual views on house music 
culture. Still an active environmentalist and unabashed left-wing radical, 
Malachy was the first to articulate the one-love philosophies of the 
underground in San Francisco, which he disseminated through Xeroxed 
leaflets at Come-Unity. One reads, "When used with positive intention, 
Group energy has the potential to restore the plan of Love in Earth. When 
you open your heart and trust the whole group you dance with; when you 
feel love with everyone, and they return it, a higher vibration can be 
reached. This happens when a crowd is deep into the vibe of house."

"I'm still trying to figure out certain obvious things that we learned 
from that early time," says Malachy, who dreams of someday picking coffee 
beans alongside the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. "Those were mind-opening 
times – there was an explosive curiosity that perhaps had a deeper impact 
on society as a whole, such as the confluence of technology and spiritual 
ethics, and a new ethos of self-employment. Hopefully we can direct 
ourselves into helping each other, and not just focus simply on surviving 
alone."

Malachy is hopeful that the new generations will rediscover the early 
rave- and house-culture ideologies. "It's hard to disassociate or give up 
on those ideals," he says. "I want to see it come back again strong. Not 
to be evangelical, but to see the message come through again would be very 
positive. Those feelings that we had at the time seemed pure; we thought 
we could change the world."

Changing the world is something that occupies Malachy's everyday thoughts. 
His room is filled with evidence of political and spiritual enlightenment; 
literature on Greenpeace, Native American histories, Irish resistance, and 
South American, Asian, and African American activism line his bookshelves. 
An Indian tapestry, and an altar with Gaia imagery, decorate the area near 
his computer, which he is able to operate since gaining some control in 
his bicep muscles. He hosts ecology-information video nights in his 
warehouse, collaborates with Food Not Bombs, and plans to establish a 
veggie-burger empire in the near future ("When I get my act together.").

Still, his living situation is shockingly bare bones. He is able to afford 
assistance only Monday through Friday mornings, from his share of the 
funds from the monthly Come-Unity party, but aside from that and the help 
of friends, he's really on his own. He receives medical assistance – since 
every hospital is required by law to treat such cases – but only in times 
of emergency.

So why doesn't he return to his family's home in Northern Ireland, where 
he could receive free medical assistance? After the accident, Malachy did 
return to Cookstown for two years. "The weather is terrible, and Northern 
Ireland is not at all set up for people with disabilities; buses cannot 
accommodate you, so it's impossible to get around on your own. Plus, the 
country is still very confrontational and unsafe." As it is for the 
hundreds of other ex-pat free spirits who have migrated here, San 
Francisco is Malachy's true home.

"Although I know things aren't healthy enough for me right now, I have to 
live dangerously," he says. Bearded, and dressed in a stocking cap, work 
pants, and a flannel shirt, Malachy looks the part of the anti-materialist 
Marxist icon. "Isabel Allende was talking about America, and she said that 
here there is the possibility that you can be and do something new, and 
not face too much criticism. I've been exposed to a lot of that energy 
here. The Bay Area is full of some of the most progressive consciousness 
on the planet. This was the Golden Gate-way to the '60s. Here your mind 
can open up to synchronicity, to new senses, psychedelic ideas. Here you 
can be more sensitive to good vibes and keep things on a positive tip." He 
rolls his eyes and lets out a shy chuckle. "Whoa – I think I just had a 
flashback!"

Malachy's unlimited optimism is profoundly inspiring to others in the 
house community and beyond. "Malachy was one of the very first people of 
my generation that I heard openly and fearlessly talking about gentleness, 
spirituality, and a positive sense of community through these gatherings 
and dance parties," says Sunshine Jones, of the Dubtribe Sound System. "He 
never lost his head, nor did he ever get too big for his boots. No matter 
where you were, or how amazing the party was, you could always speak to 
him, dance with him, and let him know you loved him."

Malachy anticipates the release of the Unity CD, which he hopes will help 
spread the "energy and vibes" of the San Francisco house movement. He is 
also confident that he will walk again. "I won't ever give up the idea 
that I will walk again," he says. "I don't think I could accept that very 
easily. There is so much healing I need to do myself, which might allow 
the power to come through. But I do believe in the power of the mind, and 
the energy that's out there. When I talk to someone I don't know who says, 
'I was at your party!' all that energy comes back to me. I know it's out 
there in the cosmos."

heard some straight collision wrecks and more than a few sloppy mixes.
 i was surprised.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: 808 vs. 909, TR vs. MC

Like some have already said, the 808 and 909 are beautiful machines,
pure fun and function, but as a "basic toolset" piece of gear, all but
unneccesary today.  

Would I want both if my budget and space were infinite?  Absolutely. :)
 Their value as collectable equipment has plataeu'd out at the moment,
for the most part, both hovering around $1k.  

MC-era Roland stuff is *really* unneccesary today.  Artifacts of the
"groove approved" bullshittery Roland was involved in during the first
electronica explosion, they offer much less functionality than even
basic softsynth/sequencer combinations, are clunky to use, and sound
pretty stilted.  

They are hardware devices, and thus *should* be more immediately
grokable than software, but their poor user interfaces doom them to
being all but unusable.  STAY AWAY.

The only "groovebox"-type machine I see as valid today is the Yamaha
RM-1x, an 8-odd-year-old box which is cheap as chips on the used
market, stuffed with innovative (and still not terribly dated) sounds,
and a large amount of fun ways to warp the sound.  It also has a
wonderful sequencer.  Still, not a "first bits" piece of gear by any
means. 

If you want a drum machine for the sake of having a cool little beatbox
to tweak with, find that Yamaha or maybe a Korg Electribe-R.

If you're looking for an analog drum machine to parallel the 808 and
909 sound/feel and want functionality over collectability, look for a
Jomox Xbase09. 

If you aren't precious about having hardware and want what drum
machines were once neccesary for, buy something like Live, Reason, or
the like, and a decent MIDI controller.  They'll take you much farther.

Subject: [sfraves] nrr: nazca, peru

I think there's not been enough alien-related content on rave lists in
the last five years, so:

Nazca is home to massive petroglyphs drawn on a thousand-foot-plus
scale. They're so large that they can only be seen from the air, but
the culture which created them had neither aircraft nor large
stationary towers from which to view them. They are therefore
extraordinarily puzzling.

They were drawn at least ten thousand years ago and only recently
rediscovered in the twentieth century after the invention and
industrialized mass-production of the airplane. Prior to this,
anthropologists had theorized that the massive carvings were remnants
of ancient, primitive irrigation systems, or just weird accidents of
nature. But what they actually are is drawings of monkeys -- more
properly, the petroglyphs are drawings of various Earthling critters,
i.e., llamas, humans, and, yes, monkeys, specifically very
mischevious-looking monkeys with long spiralling tails. The Swollen
Eyeball Network believes that these drawings, since they can only be
seen from aircraft, are proof of prehistoric UFO visitations. Maybe
yes, maybe no, but they are definitely weird.

Watch the skies.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: 808 vs. 909, TR vs. MC

Yah.

Buying an 808 or a 909 without years of techno-fiddling, and loads of
other machines, is like buying a mint condition 1969 Les Paul without
learning to play the guitar.

808/909 sounds are essential, which makes them easily available for
any and all samplers.

MCx0x devices are mainly just marketing schemes, toys for kids,
although you can do a lot with the later models in the range, to be
fair.

And the "just get some software and make noise with it first" advice
is excellent.

Hospital Records (home of High Contrast and London Elektricity) have
released a number of records done in only Acid or Reason. Fresh from
Dogs On Acid has done the same thing. To be fair, though, getting a
piece of music out of Reason which you can actually master and press
to vinyl can be a fucking nightmare. The most useful technique with
Reason is to listen to your track, then listen to a track you admire,
and then fix all the frequency range differences, i.e., bass too
muddy, treble too scratchy, that sort of shit. Run it in a couple
different sets of speakers, too. Expensive monitors are very nice, but
it's more important to run the track through multiple sets of speakers
than to make any given set of speakers particularly expensive.
Frequency holes are very common in home studios. Also beware of
overdriving the Reason mixer, it sets off some unnecessary and
undocumented compression.

Giles, who knows way too fucking much about Reason

Giles, 
 
Thanks for the info. I'm reasonably familiar with Reason, however I def. haven't achieved "knows way too fucking much." 
 
After checking out the Rebirth Muesum link Steve hooked me up with earlier, I cruised over to its parent site, http://www.propellerheads.se and checked out some of the articles (click articles up top on homepage, cannot link- sorry) they had to see if there was any more info on the comparison of analog vs. digital. 
 
Interestingly enough, there's an interview with Liam Howlett where he says that although he wrote most of the Prodigy's new album (at the time) in Reason, he's still "pure analog" when it comes to bass sounds. This seems to back up the assertion that 'gear might have a little more to offer than blinking lights (yey!). The uc33's lights are just fine. I'm going to research the alternate machines you suggest below this week.
 
Thanks,
 
Chuck

Yah.

Buying an 808 or a 909 without years of techno-fiddling, and loads of
other machines, is like buying a mint condition 1969 Les Paul without
learning to play the guitar.

808/909 sounds are essential, which makes them easily available for
any and all samplers.

MCx0x devices are mainly just marketing schemes, toys for kids,
although you can do a lot with the later models in the range, to be
fair.

And the "just get some software and make noise with it first" advice
is excellent.

Hospital Records (home of High Contrast and London Elektricity) have
released a number of records done in only Acid or Reason. Fresh from
Dogs On Acid has done the same thing. To be fair, though, getting a
piece of music out of Reason which you can actually master and press
to vinyl can be a fucking nightmare. The most useful technique with
Reason is to listen to your track, then listen to a track you admire,
and then fix all the frequency range differences, i.e., bass too
muddy, treble too scratchy, that sort of shit. Run it in a couple
different sets of speakers, too. Expensive monitors are very nice, but
it's more important to run the track through multiple sets of speakers
than to make any given set of speakers particularly expensive.
Frequency holes are very common in home studios. Also beware of
overdriving the Reason mixer, it sets off some unnecessary and
undocumented compression.

Giles, who knows way too fucking much about Reason

I completely agree Giles.
 If you really want to make a high quality track you need a proper
multitrack midi/audio sequencer (Sonar, Pro Tools, Logic, Cubase, Acid,
Nuendo, ect...). Reason type programs are great as a scratch pad, or as
creating single tracks, but you really need to export them track by track o=
r
"rewire" it to a sequencer to get best quality and also the ability to
properly add effects.
 I usually switch between FL Studio and Reason rewired, do loops in Acid,
and export it all to Sonar. Multitrack it there and use Sonar for midi of m=
y
external hardware.

 Then
 Master in Sound Forge
 ymmv
 Examples of my tracks can be found here: http://www.tussinsspace.com
 Comments and suggestions always welcome!
 Steve (playing with midi since ~89)

My favorite mixes of all time:
 Psytrance:
 http://www.tussinspace.com/Yahel And Infected Mushroom Live At Japan.mp3
 Nice high quality recorded mix from a few years ago.
 Ambient:
 http://www.tussinspace.com/Mixed by Red Jerry - Deep and Chilled Euphoria
(Disk 1).mp3
 Yeah it's a commercial CD rip, but should be good to share since it is lon=
g
out of production and incredibly hard to find anywhere.
 http://www.tussinspace.com/Mixed by Red Jerry - Deep and Chilled Euphoria
(Disk 2) .mp3
 And disk 2 from this masterpiece.
 Please share these links with responsibility (as in don't post in mssg
boards or other lists) I have limited bandwidth.

Yeah it's a commercial CD rip, but should be good to share since it is long
out of production and incredibly hard to find anywhere.

Correction: Going to try alternate machine that georgeC had suggested.* Sorry for any misimplication.

Thanks for the info. I'm reasonably familiar with Reason, however I def. haven't achieved "knows way too fucking much." 

After checking out the Rebirth Muesum link Steve hooked me up with earlier, I cruised over to its parent site, http://www.propellerheads.se and checked out some of the articles (click articles up top on homepage, cannot link- sorry) they had to see if there was any more info on the comparison of analog vs. digital. 

Interestingly enough, there's an interview with Liam Howlett where he says that although he wrote most of the Prodigy's new album (at the time) in Reason, he's still "pure analog" when it comes to bass sounds. This seems to back up the assertion that 'gear might have a little more to offer than blinking lights (yey!). The uc33's lights are just fine. I'm going to research the alternate machines you suggest below this week.

Thanks,

Chuck

Yah.

Buying an 808 or a 909 without years of techno-fiddling, and loads of
other machines, is like buying a mint condition 1969 Les Paul without
learning to play the guitar.

808/909 sounds are essential, which makes them easily available for
any and all samplers.

MCx0x devices are mainly just marketing schemes, toys for kids,
although you can do a lot with the later models in the range, to be
fair.

And the "just get some software and make noise with it first" advice
is excellent.

Hospital Records (home of High Contrast and London Elektricity) have
released a number of records done in only Acid or Reason. Fresh from
Dogs On Acid has done the same thing. To be fair, though, getting a
piece of music out of Reason which you can actually master and press
to vinyl can be a fucking nightmare. The most useful technique with
Reason is to listen to your track, then listen to a track you admire,
and then fix all the frequency range differences, i.e., bass too
muddy, treble too scratchy, that sort of shit. Run it in a couple
different sets of speakers, too. Expensive monitors are very nice, but
it's more important to run the track through multiple sets of speakers
than to make any given set of speakers particularly expensive.
Frequency holes are very common in home studios. Also beware of
overdriving the Reason mixer, it sets off some unnecessary and
undocumented compression.

Giles, who knows way too fucking much about Reason

I got some good solid/punchy sound out of routing the digital signal out and
back through an anolog mixer.  Add some subtle compression..mostly for
warmth, and record that back into the audio editor of your choice and throw
a Waves UltraMax on that puppy and yer goood.  Nice, solid, punchy, crisp
and very lovely.  My sound waves are HUGE...which translates into a DAMN
good pressing!

Well, I used to think similar things as Mr. Osteen, until seeing these 
pieces of gear in the right folks hands - and then they become totally 
different tools.

The heavyweight sound of a 909 kickdrum will NEVER be played out IMHO. And I 
have mad love for the 808 too...

I've heard that 303's get old after a while as well, but I tell you what - 
after seeing the Future Retro in action ( 
http://store.robotspeakstore.com/futureretro.html ), I know better. I could 
tweak knobs on that thing for DAYS....

The Nazca drawings plain mystify me. So fucking cool. They are only just now 
starting to uncover bits and pieces about the people who made them.

Stuff like that fascinates me to no end.

Very interesting.  On a smaller and much more terrestrial scale, has anyone been to the No. Nevada petroglyph site?  Grimes Point, I believe it's referred to.
 
Really cool place, interesting spiritual feeling you get there when you are alone and the sun is going down ...

OH man, $700 for that thing?  Its just not worth it. Build your own
near-perfect 303 emulator, the x0xb0x:

http://www.ladyada.net/make/x0xb0x/

Only $300.

My kit should be arriving today!  score!

Software is always the most powerful, but little boxes are where
the fun it at.

Playing the Building 
Playing the building is a sound installation in which the infrastructure, the physical plant of the building, is converted into a giant musical instrument. Devices are attached to the building structure — to the metal beams and pillars, the heating pipes, the water pipes — and are used to make these things produce sound. The activations will be of three types: wind, vibration, striking. The devices do not produce sound themselves, but they cause the building elements to vibrate, resonate and oscillate so that the building itself becomes a very large musical instrument.

It's a little less than $700, and this is no emulator. This for all intents 
and purposes is a full on 303. Plus it's got all sorts of other nifty little 
features that aren't mentioned here...

You'd just have to seee it and play with it to understand how sick it is.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: 808 vs. 909, TR vs. MC

Maybe I should have said  "in my opinion", because, personally I find
909 sounds to be so overplayed that hearing it in new songs make me
doubt the artist's creativity and sound design ability.

As for the future retro $700 thingy, it sure looks cool, but the QA
engineer in me starts wondering about the form vs. function of it's
UI. Western music theory states that music is bars in time and
mathmatically seperated tones, which is a straight line or a perfect
circle. Which one is more confusing to work with? Imagine a 1 octave
piano keyboard in a circle.

 Also, those knobs look like they are not positioned in an optimum
postion for anyone with hands bigger then a 7 year olds.

Marketing, it's all marketing bullshit. Wanna see some real cool equipment?

Well, all I mean is I had a bunch of boxes, sold them all, and sort of
deliberately confined myself to Reason for a while. You learn a lot
that way but some of the things you learn end up just being specific
limitations of Reason. I've actually been picking up little bits of
hardware here and there to balance things out, but it's not been a
priority; I'm more into learning to drum these days, and eventually
picking up a decent set of electronic drums. I don't want to be
overwhelmed with toys, I've done that and it's fun but eventually it's
just wasted time. Discipline -- it's not just for dominatrices any
more.

Actually, Calyx (Moving Shadow) does the same thing. Does pretty much
everything in Logic and Kontact, routes it to an analog desk, etc.
Puts you in good company. ^_^

Thank you. I don't know what's up with all this "Dork" stuff. I'm
keeping things enlightened here. If it weren't for me providing a
much-needed dose of "National Geographic" meets "Mysterious Mysteries"
we might be inundated with buttplugging and pee-drinking again. Give

Until you see it, dont knock it. It's a big piece of gear (2 7 year olds 
could work the knobs on it) , and begs to be played like an instrument 
rather than just "press and play". Plus you can plug in a guitar or other 
instrument and run it through the piece for all sorts of fun. There's so 
many nifty things u can do with it. And it is FAITHFUL to the 303.

i <3 teh bayraves

i just think it's funny because i think LOTS of people on SFR like to
distance themselves from the "Bayraves crowd" and think that they are
just a bunch of cracked out candy kids.

but the truth is that some of the older and most vocal members of SFR
are, in fact, members of the Bayraves community.

and why haven't you been posting Phillp?  no "pills up the butt"
threads you'd like to contribute to?  ;)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] nrr: nazca, peru

To keep the alien and ancient cultures kick going I've been studying a
cross relationship between the Dogon tribe of Africa that predicted Sirius
had a smaller, darker companion which was very heavy which wasn't prooved
to the 1930's when it was found out that Sirius is a binary star and has a
white dwarf which is the smallest possible and heaviest star without
collapsing on itself.  They also have a 4 calendar system which doesn't
seem based off any normal calendar system and are based off the (very DNA
looking) flight path and 49 - 50 year cycle of Sirius A and B. They also
predicted a 3rd star in the system which hasn't been found but who knows,
there might be or at least might've been.  They're legend says that
visitors gave them the calendars and that they were from these stars. 
Here's a link to some of their mythos
http://www.crystalinks.com/dogon.html. This website has a lot of ancient
cultures cross connected as well and it is definitely an interesting
website to start in studying ancient cultures, their prophecies and how
they're related to each other.  Of course it doesn't have everything but
thats up to you to keep googling out the things you read about.

Other interesting topics to cross reference regarding aliens and ancient
cultures is of course the Mayan and Tibetan calendars, the pyramids in
China including the mysterious white pyramid, another pyramid that sits on
a salt lake in the middle of nowhere and has pipes running underground and
into the lake that the locals believe was used as an alien launch pad. 
Some of the materials at the lake, like components in the pipes have not
quite been identified either.  Unfortunately, scientists have always had
hard time studying these relics due to communism in China as well as they
don't want the tombs of their ancestors investigated.  Another myth for an
area in souther China near the border with india is of a tribe of 'very
ugly people' who once inhabited the area who were very small, and their
legend consists of an alien spaceship crash.  These humanoids are
described as neither looking asian nor indian and are still a mystery. 
They've also found strange disks in caves that were supposedly brought
with them as well (these artifacts are listed at somewhere around 12k
years old as are some of the remains they've found.  Just recently,
remains matching the ugly people have been found in the phillipenes or
indonesia and have also been dated about 12k years old.

So much info out there... no wonder I'm an insomniac.

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Is Sex Necessary? (You might want to read NOT at work)

  Your Health
Is Sex Necessary?
Alan Farnham



Fans of abstinence had better be sitting down. "Saving yourself" before 
the big game, the big business deal, the big hoedown or the big bakeoff 
may indeed confer some moral benefit. But corporeally it does absolutely 
zip. There's no evidence it sharpens your competitive edge. The best that 
modern science can say for sexual abstinence is that it's harmless when 
practiced in moderation. Having regular and enthusiastic sex, by contrast, 
confers a host of measurable physiological advantages, be you male or 
female. (This assumes that you are engaging in sex without contracting a 
sexually transmitted disease.)

In one of the most credible studies correlating overall health with sexual 
frequency, Queens University in Belfast tracked the mortality of about 
1,000 middle-aged men over the course of a decade. The study was designed 
to compare persons of comparable circumstances, age and health. Its 
findings, published in 1997 in the British Medical Journal, were that men 
who reported the highest frequency of orgasm enjoyed a death rate half 
that of the laggards. Other studies (some rigorous, some less so) purport 
to show that having sex even a few times a week has an associative or 
causal relationship with the following:

- Improved sense of smell: After sex, production of the hormone prolactin 
surges. This in turn causes stem cells in the brain to develop new neurons 
in the brain's olfactory bulb, its smell center.

- Reduced risk of heart disease: In a 2001 follow-on to the Queens 
University study mentioned above, researchers focused on cardiovascular 
health. Their finding? That by having sex three or more times a week, men 
reduced their risk of heart attack or stroke by half. In reporting these 
results, the co-author of the study, Shah Ebrahim, Ph.D., displayed the 
well-loved British gift for understatement: "The relationship found 
between frequency of sexual intercourse and mortality is of considerable 
public interest."

- Weight loss, overall fitness: Sex, if nothing else, is exercise. A 
vigorous bout burns some 200 calories--about the same as running 15 
minutes on a treadmill or playing a spirited game of squash. The pulse 
rate, in a person aroused, rises from about 70 beats per minute to 150, 
the same as that of an athlete putting forth maximum effort. British 
researchers have determined that the equivalent of six Big Macs can be 
worked off by having sex three times a week for a year. Muscular 
contractions during intercourse work the pelvis, thighs, buttocks, arms, 
neck and thorax. Sex also boosts production of testosterone, which leads 
to stronger bones and muscles. Men's Health magazine has gone so far as to 
call the bed the single greatest piece of exercise equipment ever 
invented.

- Reduced depression: Such was the implication of a 2002 study of 293 
women. American psychologist Gordon Gallup reported that sexually active 
participants whose male partners did not use condoms were less subject to 
depression than those whose partners did. One theory of causality: 
Prostoglandin, a hormone found only in semen, may be absorbed in the 
female genital tract, thus modulating female hormones.

- Pain-relief: Immediately before orgasm, levels of the hormone oxytocin 
surge to five times their normal level. This in turn releases endorphins, 
which alleviate the pain of everything from headache to arthritis to even 
migraine. In women, sex also prompts production of estrogen, which can 
reduce the pain of PMS.

- Less-frequent colds and flu: Wilkes University in Pennsylvania says 
individuals who have sex once or twice a week show 30% higher levels of an 
antibody called immunoglobulin A, which is known to boost the immune 
system.

- Better bladder control: Heard of Kegel exercises? You do them, whether 
you know it or not, every time you stem your flow of urine. The same set 
of muscles is worked during sex.

- Better teeth: Seminal plasma contains zinc, calcium and other minerals 
shown to retard tooth decay. Since this is a family Web site, we will omit 
discussion of the mineral delivery system. Suffice it to say that it could 
be a far richer, more complex and more satisfying experience than 
squeezing a tube of Crest--even Tartar Control Crest. Researchers have 
noted, parenthetically, that sexual etiquette usually demands the brushing 
of one's teeth before and/or after intimacy, which, by itself, would help 
promote better oral hygiene.

- A happier prostate? Some urologists believe they see a relationship 
between infrequency of ejaculation and cancer of the prostate. The causal 
argument goes like this: To produce seminal fluid, the prostate and the 
seminal vesicles take such substances from the blood as zinc, citric acid 
and potassium, then concentrate them up to 600 times. Any carcinogens 
present in the blood likewise would be concentrated. Rather than have 
concentrated carcinogens hanging around causing trouble, it's better to 
evict them. Regular old sex could do the job. But if the flushing of the 
prostate were your only objective, masturbation might be a better way to 
go, especially for the non-monogamous male. Having sex with multiple 
partners can, all by itself, raise a man's risk of cancer by up to 40%. 
That's because he runs an increased risk of contracting sexual infections. 
So, if you want the all the purported benefits of flushing with none of 
the attendant risk, go digital. A study recently published by the British 
Journal of Urology International asserts that men in their 20s can reduce 
by a third their chance of getting prostate cancer by ejaculating more 
than five times a week.

While possession of a robust appetite for sex--and the physical ability to 
gratify it--may not always be the cynosure of perfect health, a reluctance 
to engage can be a sign that something is seriously on the fritz, 
especially where the culprit is an infirm erection.

Dr. J. Francois Eid, a urologist with Weill Medical College of Cornell 
University and New York Presbyterian Hospital, observes that erectile 
dysfunction is extension of vascular system. A lethargic member may be 
telling you that you have diseased blood vessels elsewhere in your body. 
"It could be a first sign of hypertension or diabetes or increased 
cholesterol levels. It's a red flag that you should see your doctor." 
Treatment and exercise, says Dr. Eid, can have things looking up again: 
"Men who exercise and have a good heart and low heart rate, and who are 
cardio-fit, have firmer erections. There very definitely is a 
relationship."

But is there such a thing as too much sex?

The answer, in purely physiological terms, is this: If you're female, 
probably not. If you're male? You betcha.

Dr. Claire Bailey of the University of Bristol says there is little or no 
risk of a woman's overdosing on sex. In fact, she says, regular sessions 
can not only firm a woman's tummy and buttocks but also improve her 
posture.

Dr. George Winch Jr., an obstetrician/gynecologist in Elko, Nev., concurs. 
If a woman is pre-menopausal and otherwise healthy, says Dr. Winch, her 
having an extraordinary amount of intercourse ought not to pose a problem. 
"I don't think women can have too much intercourse," he says, "so long as 
no sexually transmitted disease is introduced and there's not an 
inadvertent pregnancy. Sometimes you can have a lubrication problem. If 
you have that, there can be vaginal excoriation--vaginal scrape."

Women who abstain from sex run some risks. In postmenopausal women, these 
include vaginal atrophy. Dr. Winch has a middle-aged patient of whom he 
says: "She hasn't had intercourse in three years. Just isn't interested. 
The opening of her vagina is narrowing from disuse. It's a condition that 
can lead to dysparenia, or pain associated with intercourse. I told her, 
'Look, you'd better buy a vibrator or you're going to lose function 
there.'"

As for men, urologist Eid says it's definitely possible to get too much of 
a good thing, now that drugs such as Viagra and Levitra have given men far 
more staying power than may actually be good for them.

The penis, says Eid, is wonderfully resilient. But everything has its 
limits. Penile tissues, if given too roistering or prolonged a pummeling, 
can sustain damage. In cases you'd just as soon not hear about, permanent 
damage.

"Yes," says Dr. Eid, "It is possible for a young man who is very forceful 
and who likes rough sex, to damage his erectile tissue." The drugs 
increase rigidity; moreover, they make it possible for a man to have 
second and third orgasms without having to wait out intermission.

"I see it in pro football players," says Eid. "They use Viagra because 
they're so sexually active. What they demand of their body is 
unreasonable. It's part of playing football: you play through the pain." 
This type of guy doesn't listen to his body. He takes a shot of cortisone, 
and keeps on going. And they have sex in similar fashion."

There's a reason the penis, in its natural state, undergoes a period of 
flaccidity: That's when it takes a breather. The blood within it is 
replenished with oxygen. "During an erection," explains Eid, "very little 
blood flows to the penis. During thrusting, pressure can go as high as 200 
mil of water. Zero blood flows into penis at that time." To absorb oxygen, 
the tissue must become relaxed. "If you do not allow the penis to rest, 
then the muscle tissue does not get enough oxygen. The individual gets 
prolonged erections, gets decreased oxygen to tissue, and could 
potentially suffer priapism." (We recommend you get a medical encyclopedia 
and look it up.) "The muscle becomes so engorged, it's painful. Pressure 
inside starts to increase. Cells start dying. More pressure and less blood 
flow. Eventually the muscle dies. Then there's scarring. That's why it's 
considered an emergency."

Subject: Re: [sfraves] The Agony of Ecstacy

I have to say, after reading this article, it is funny that they refer to 
a party at Club Might as a "rave" and my favorite quotes are:

"... Nguyen disagrees. "You can't go to the rave sober. It doesn't work." 
... "

... I'd have to disagree with this one, I for one, love going out sober, 
and can dance just as long as those under the influence w/o any "helpers"

second...

"... At the Mighty, colorful kaleidoscopic Rorschach test patterns are 
projected on white screens that hang from the ceiling. The crowd of 
dancers, mostly between the ages of 25 and 35, dance to hypnotic 
repetitious sirens beneath a heavy shower of blue, red and yellow 
spotlights.

...

This article almost makes the music sound like a bomb siren.. :)

" Nguyen disagrees. "You can't go to the rave sober.
It doesn't work.""

I don't agree with this either. I didn't do any drugs
the first 3-4 years I went to parties and probably
danced harder than I ever did after I started doing e.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: 808 vs. 909, TR vs. MC

While you're at it- check out the XL7/MP7 boxes by Emu.

(I've owned both, as well as many other HW sequencers)
My main problem with the RM1x was the buttons-
(secondarily, the non-standard and unresponsive interface)
Non-velocity sensitive and they tend to just stop working quickly...
The XL7 is the hardware sequencer I've stuck with- the synthesis section is
a ROMpler but nobody does those better than Emu...

For uber-cheap the mentioned electribes are endless fun (if very limited in
the A and R versions)- and also check out the AN/DX200 boxes by yamaha-
Serious synthesis capabilies combined with ROMpler drums, proper modulation,
and a decent FX section with an onboard sequencer- lots of fun and
capability for the $129 or so...

this guy seems like an expert on the topic.  after all "So far, the Marin man says he has 'dropped' 38 1/2 'rolls.' "  i am surprised he is still functioning. j/k  call me when you have an accurate record of having taken over 500. i have 'a friend' that has done 1000 easy over the last 10 years, has a good, technical and highly responsible job, goes to parties almost every weekend without using anything.  

my hopes would be that a good chemist would make something that while under the influence of the "gangster thizz" that  "Ravers drop,"  you would some how for 3 years be able to procreate or speak to the media on behalf of parties, drugs, or anything for that matter.  is that too much to ask from a pill?  i know there has to be some good chemists out there.

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: A new ambient track I just finished, please check it out!

Been rather sick lately, but woke up the other night around 3am and
had inspiration. The inspiration was so strong I couldn't go back to
sleep, I was just laying there with endless thoughts floating in my
head. So I got up and started working on a new track and here it is:

http://www.tussinspace.com/Osteen - Rain.mp3

It is Ambient, drone zone style.

Please give me any comments good or bad. I need feedback.

Thanks,

"No sage or savior has ever endorsed greed and gluttony as a path 
toward social justice or personal fulfillment.  These sane and 
enlightened people come to us from all cultures and all eras, 
sometimes knowing of each other but more often not.  Socrates and 
Jesus, Lao Tzu and Tolstoi, Gandhi and Martin Buber -- no one can 
find in their lives and words a jot of support for a political and 
economic regime that encourages the acquisition of wealth far beyond 
what is needed for the necessaries -- or even the restorative 
pleasures -- of life while consigning the masses to live and work in squalor."
-Stephen J. Fortunato, Associate Justice, Rhode Island Supreme Court.

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of 
the rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will 
gradually become visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

If you have no ride to Oaktown to see Meat Beat on Saturday the 29th, MAGDA
from M-nus Records is also playing at Rx Gallery. Also, Sunday the 30th is
the Sunset Halloween Boat Party. This is consistently my FAVE party of the
year! Better have a good costume if you go tho, cuz these mofos don't mess
around! Hit me up for ticket info.

Tipper is always good times, and that local kid Boreta is sick if you dig 
IDM breaks. Good lineup!

But I'm biased...catching Meat Beat in a setting like the Otherworld, well, 
that's just silly amounts of cool. Plus they're doing a retrospective of all 
their work throughout the years - and it's the 4 main guys: Jack Dangers, 
Ben Stokes, Mark Pistel & Lynn Farmer.

I have to definitely agree with Van on this one. MBM is just flat out
amazing. Especially if you've never seen them before, do yourself a favor
and check them out. Their music has kind of a heavy, spooky edge to it that
will go great with the Haloween thing too. In fact, Tino Corp. (another
Dangers / Stokes project) even did a "Halloween Dub" album!
 And while I'm on the topic, I was recently lucky enough to catch an AMAZIN=
G
audio/visual performance by Tino Corp. at the Elbo Room. I took some friend=
s
along who had never heard of them and everyone was blown away! Check the
Tino Corp. website now and again, they occasionally do shows like this at
small venues with very little advertising. Four guys, synched audio/video
scratching, absolutely dope combo of breaks/dub/electro/techno. unbelievabl=
y
GRATE!
 ------> Greg
 btw Adriana, I'll FOR SURE be at the boat party, but the costume (as
always) is top secret! (last year I was DuctTape Man, and the year before
that, The Hamburglar!)

Man - I noticed that your sig said "sub atomic breakbeat", and you just KNOW 
that I had to peep the style.

I must say - I am VERY impressed! The uptempo breaks have a very psy-breaks 
feel to them, which I have a soft spot for (acciiiiiiied!!), and the 
downtempo breaks are like a hybrid between nuskool breaks & hip-hop. 
Something I've been interested in spinning, but can rarely find any 
material. I know guys like Tipper, T-Power and some locals produce it, but 
it's hard to track down, and rare that I really dig the style. My hat's 
off!!! Everything I checked out was reallllly cool!!!

Go to the site and check out Troys stuff y'all!!!! Two big thumbs up!!!

MBM is just so critical to the electronic music scene, it's not only going 
to be a dope show, but it'll be like taking electronica 101. They really 
pushed electro, techno, techno-dub, IDM and even jungle to some extent 
before half those genres really existed. Jack Dangers is pretty much on par 
with someone like Danny Elfman....pushing the envelope, his hands in 
everything - a true innovator.

Yup.  I've played Troy's music on the radio (multiple times, I think) in
the past.  Peep it.

Hey all-

I've started up an SFR sex map that will keep track of
  who has slept with who.
As SFRaves grows as the beautiful community it is,
keeping track of the STD chain becomes a very
important thing.  STDs are real, and it's important
everyone be informed and knowledgable about everyone
here.

There's only about 20 names on it so far, and it's not
complete by any means so please send me any
information you have about anyone here and I'll add
them to the list.

You can see it here:

Be safe all- God bless!

Adding to that, I have some industrial music video comps from back in 
the day (when they were on VHS) that have meat beat videos on them. Old 
school and classic. MBM introduced me into a whole new level of 
electronic music that i was never exposed to as an industrial nut for so 
long. I bought one of their early albums on a whim after seeing a video 
because it mixed so well between psychic tv, kmfdm, laibach and front 
242 but still maintained this weird edge of surreal degenerate 
fuckedupedness.

That said, no way will I miss Halloween. I'll be chaplin.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] I'm feeling smarter already!

OMFG! See, I've been saying for years (half jokingly, half not) that my 
memory is far better when I smoke on a semi regular basis. But on long dry 
spells, I start forgetting things.

My memory was total ass before I started smoking too...go figure.

wow, this track is amazing.  it has a feel that takes me back
to 1996 when ambient was in it's heyday.  probably better than
some of my more coveted instinct ambient stuff:  i'd rank it in
the "em:t" vein.

makes me want to spin ambient (again).  if i ever do, i'd be
sure to play this track for sure.  thanks for sharing!  (and
please make more!!)  :D

Subject: Re: [sfraves] nrr: nazca, peru

on the 12,000 years old thing, there's an ecologist who says he can
prove that the Sphinx is at least 12,000 years old, because it has a
lot more rainforest erosion on it than desert erosion. (ie much more
gentle sloping downwards erosion, as in water flowing down, than harsh
abrasive sideways erosion, as in sand scraping as it's blown by wind.)

Aleister Crowley believed that the Greeks knew about Sirius also,
although how they were supposed to have gotten the information from
the Dogons is a bit of a puzzle.

Yea - that theory has been disproven a bunch of times tho. That particular 
type of stone that the Sphinx is made up of has changing layers, and often 
times some layers soften and crumble well before the others, leaving a 
similar effect as water erosion.

come join the Shazbot fan club!

i made a whole bunch of these buttons for fans of Shawn Allen, aka DJ  
Shazbot:
    http://unsafe.nebcorp.com/~st_indigo/images/shazbutton.jpg

paypal me $1.50 (with your mailing address) and i'll send ya one.  i  
have a bunch of other button designs and will be opening a web store  
soon (ravebuttons.com, i think).  i can also do custom orders, with a  
minimum order of 50.

i think the 1" buttons are too small. all buttons are 1.25" diameter.

Hey everyone the time is almost upon us. We have assembles 7 of the most
beloved crews in the bay for one special event. We have worked very hard to
make this the best event of the year. Please join us as we go mad!!!*
||||Mad Hatters Halloween Tea Party|||| *
*Room 1 (hosted by HCFTP, Nu Vision, DTS and Nocturnalisim)*
*GRIDLOK* (Project51/Violence Recordings-SF) As one of America's hardest
working producers and DJs, Gridlok has charted a steady, methodical path
into the vanguard of drum and bass. His tracks enjoy the support of drum an=
d
bass' finest, from Andy C to Bailey. His work ethic and tireless efforts to
advance the sonic breadth of the music have yielded tremendous dividends fo=
r
drum and bass fans worldwide. Recent releases on Project 51 and Violence
have become staples of countless major league DJs worldwide, and are huge
crowd favorites

*SUNRIZE* (Pitched Up Recordings/HCFTP/Blatant Beats UK-MA) - *Final Happy
Hardcore Performance* Since his first hardcore release in the spring of
2002, he has released on a handful of labels, some including Pitched Up
Recordings, Blatant Beats, Destructive Force, Rave N Beats, and Madness &
Mayhem. This DJ's name has become unanimous with American Hardcore and has
played all across the country at events with artists like Scott Brown, DJ
SY, UFO, Brisk, and others. This will be his final performance as dj
sunrize. Don't miss the last chance to see him play happy hardcore.

*MAYHEM* (AZ Hardcore
Junkies.com/CompleteDJ.com<http://Junkies.com/CompleteDJ.com>)
vs. *vs. Second Base*In 2001, Steve Van Holton, better known to West Coast
hardcore fans as Mayhem, began playing records. His motivation? Simply to
listen to the music he loved by artists such as Digital Boy, Anger Fist,
Noize Supressor, Sonik, The Wish Master, Armageddon Project and The
Headbanger. Mayhem joined the Arizona Hardcore Junkies in 2003 only a shot
time after he began playing and in 2004 was asked to play Nocturnal
Wonderland in Los Angles. Playing parties with the likes of Scott Brown,
Neophyte, Panic, Ophidian, Delta 9, D-passion and Dj delirium. The AZ
Hardcore Junkies expect big things to come from Mayhem in the near future.

the AXIS (The Doc & Arize)
Sideshow & Go-Zania & Leon Cook
Yagi & Reclipse
Happy Freaks (Hi-C, Kid Orange, & Cracker Jack)
2qt & Rye Bread

*Room 2 (Hosted by Zapatistas and Andy P)*

*DIG-DUG* (USC Events-WA) Known for his incredible track selection and
polished technical skills, DJ Dig-Dug has managed to develop an undeniably
unique style. While his sets often travel through several different types o=
f
breaks (Funky, Progressive, Dark), his underlying theme of warped bass line=
s
and intelligent drum loops brings a sense of unity to his signature sound.
With his impressive beat juggling, cross-fader cutting, and creative but
tasteful use of the Pioneer DJM-600's onboard effects, DJ Dig-Dug has
developed a following based on skills, not hype.

*FilterGrinder* (Kontrast/Phat & Phunkie-TX) Doug Siebenthal, a.k.a.
Filtergrinder, has been djing for the last seven years. Filtergrinder
started producing techno when he met Bryan Cox in 2001. BC and Filtergrinde=
r
went on to produce the hit record "Alpine". Alpine (BC remix) got quick
recognition by DJ Dan and was featured on his Mixed Live DJ Dan, Ruby Skye
(Moonshine) CD. Both the original and the remix went on to have great
notoriety on BBC Radio One, and top rotation of such djs as Carl Cox,
Fergie, Joey Beltram, and Mauro Picotto. Filtergrinder currently resides in
the L.A. area as he continues to dj on a monthly basis and for the year of
2005, he is also launching Whiplash Records; the first release, "Rockin the
Disco", is coming out in March with the remix being done by Bryan Cox. You
can also expect other records from Filtergrinder in 2005 including
"Repeater" on the Afficinado label, with remixes from Granite & Phunk and
Carbon Community.

name early in the rave scene. Beginning with a party known as A Rave called
Sharon, Dutch's name spread quickly throughout SF. Known for seamless
mixing, and remarkable sets, Dutch has made a huge impact at the SF Thump

I haven't heard about the thing with the Sphinx and dating so I can't
really comment on it.  I just know the eqyptians lined up a lot of things
with the stars but typically with Orion. As far as the Sirius connection,
Crowley definitely was tipped into something at that time for sure.  His
wanderings through the mythos of his travels found many cultures with an
affinity for the Dog star.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] nrr: nazca, peru

LOL!

I have my theories on that - especially since a team of 
explorer/archaelogists found a viable connection in South America that could 
indeed have been the fabled city. There was something about there being 
South American words "atl" and "antis" which meant "water" and "copper".

Check this link, it has some info regarding what I was talking about on 
there...

http://www.geocities.com/webatlantis/LostContinentofAtlantisisSouthAmerica.htm

I'll try and dig up more credible sources, but I have read this in a couple 
of books and heard it on a couple of documentaries too...

Subject: [sfraves] Technology: spinning a virtual platter from CD tracks

--NextPart_Webmail_9m3u9jl4l_11694_1129841484_0
Content-Type: text/plain

Hello everyone,
Please forgive my ignorance on this topic but I have a goal with some personal urgency. My birthday is Friday and all I want is a DJ mix from my CD collection.
 
Sometimes we buy CDs just because they have a good dance song that we can’t find anywhere else. Often your favorite song is mixed in a continuous pattern per the DJ’s intention.
 
What if you want to take your favorite songs and put them together? You have to eliminate or change the transition to the next track and perform beat matching. 
 
You can’t just “rip” and burn the song, it doesn’t sound right because it cuts off abruptly.
 
You need a DJ!
 
So I called my friend Ben, a young lifeguard who is an aspiring bedroom DJ with a brand new mixer (I do not know the product name). Unfortunately, mixers are generally used with vinyl records, not CDs. 
 
Ben told me that you need something else with the mixer to spin a virtual platter, so I checked online and found Virtual DJ, a product that has “all the professional features a real DJ will need.”
http://www.virtualdj.com/products/
 
I am not sure about this so I thought I would ask my friends on the list. Will this product (or something like it) allow Ben to mix from my favorite CD tracks and create a completely different compilation? Or is it even worth the price/trouble?
 
Thx,
Greg VP

You'd be better off DL'ing the tracks and making a mix using MP3's

Subject: [sfraves] NRR South Bay Room for rent!

Positive, Down-to-earth, creative, multi cultural,
open-minded (this isn't secret code for freaky-deeky,
just not narrow minded okay?), music worshipping,
spiritual, harmonious, hard working, hard playing 420
friendly, beer loving household, seeks female, for our
empty bedroom in a 4 bedroom corner house in
Sunnyvale. We have a fun-loving, interactive,
community type situation. Not just an "I'm just
renting a room" situation. We are friends, family, and
a support group!

The housemates are comprised of a married m/f couple,
another gentleman, a 30 lb. shorthaired dog, as well
as 3 younger boys (ages 2/4/7) on different occasions.
We've had 2 males in the bedroom before, but they've
moved out to pursue bigger and better things so we're
on the hunt again. This time we're seeking a female to
balance out the energy in the house (all Jacks and 1
Jill makes Jill a sad girl). Two of us are house music
dj's/producers so count on music of all sorts, as well
as a party every once in a blue moon. This is a very
positive, fun-loving and spiritual household. We
celebrate life, we sing, we dance, we create music and
art and enjoy life to the fullest while raising our
children to be better than ourselves.
 
The house has beautiful hardwood floors and a nice
backyard with a covered patio, Rose bushes, trees and
of course a lawn. We have a phone, wireless dsl,
washer/dryer and a dishwasher. The entertainment room
is well stocked with leather couches, a 65" widescreen
TV (we're dvd junkies), surround sound, ps2, computer
and the turntables. Our decently appointed
kitchen/dining room features tile counters, a 100
gallon fish tank and a skylight. You would also have
storage places in the garage. No cigarette smoking in
the house (including your room) but we do have a
designated cig. smoking lounge/laundry room (the
garage). 

We are centrally located between 101 and 280 and close
to CalTrain/buslines. The neighborhood is standard
suburb style with a park/elementary school nearby w/
tennis and basketball courts.  We are located in
Sunnyvale near Santa Clara (cornpalace) near Lawrence
and El Camino Real. Sorry, no more pets and no more
kids and you must be over 21. 

The rent is $550/month plus 1/4 of utilities
(pg&e,water,phone/dsl). The room is available Nov1st,
please keep in mind, the money is less important than
the quality/match of the applicant so please be a well
rounded, good head on your shoulders type, and enjoys
thinking type “real” people. Please contact via email
retroactivefunk@yahoo.com and
Justine_ortiz@sbcglobal.net to tell us why you would
be a good fit. Cheers, Gabriel

first- read the "advanced vinyl handling" tutorial on hyperreal for
enough theory to build a good understanding of how mixing is done.

then, find and play with software called Ableton Live. i've done one
mix w/ it recently (industrial/power-noise, really should have started
learning the software w/ something more conventional but oh well) and
am mostly done with a lighter, more accessible breaks mix.

J with a brand new mixer (I do not know the product name). Unfortunately, m=
ixers are generally used with vinyl records, not CDs.

you can use a mixer with either, all it does is take in signals on
multiple channels, and, well, mix them :) the main difference is that
turntables put out a phono signal and CD decks w/ pitch control
usually do line-level; but almost all mixers have a toggle switch
above each channel to go back & forth between the two.

but yeah, lowest-investment way to get what you want is Ableton Live.
mixing with that is pretty much a 3-step process-

1. let Ableton analyze the track, then correct any errors it made w/
regards to timing the beats
2. line the incoming track up w/ the outgoing track (this is called
phrasing, i'm being brief because the hyperreal doc mentioned above
will tell you all you need to know)
3. proof-listen to the mix, make sure it sounds good

repeat until finished.

you could buy two CD decks - but you'd still have to learn to
beatmatch.  

i'd use one of brandon's suggestions - mixmeister has a trial
version, and you could make your mix in time for friday.  :)

happy bday!

i knew DJs in China that used Mixmeister for all their mix cds.

primarily because few of the DJs actually owned their own gear.  they
played off of CDs anyway.

he actually made some decent mixes with Mixmeister!

Subject: [sfraves] Jeff Mills/The Wizard - early hip hop mixes?

i think someone here posted up some very old Jeff Mills mixes, back
when he was spinning hip hop as The Wizard.

i just realized that i lost those mixes when my laptop crashed.

does anyone have those links or those mixes?  i think they were
recorded live from the radio.

the first 15 minutes were absolutely incredible, considering they were
from the early/mid-80s.

Hi, Jen here
Just wanta say..........I really enjoyed Rain. (I've listened to it 6 times now)
It reminds me of San Fransisco, with the steam heat on and the windows open.
Just candles and the moon over looking the city.
at the very top of 1369 Hyde St.
Good times, Good times........
 
Thanks, Jen

Subject: Re: [sfraves] nrr: nazca, peru

Actually now I have to play devil's advocate. The legend of Atlantis
actually comes from a story in a dialogue by Plato. The weird thing
about Plato is that his writings are all just transcriptions of
conversations that Socrates had, and Socrates spent a roughly equal
amount of time enlightening people by telling them things they didn't
know and making fun of them by telling them things that were obviously
nonsense. There are really only two ways to make sense of his famous
dialogue on memory, the Meno, which are:

a) Socrates was saying ridiculous things because he was a total fucking mor=
on
b) Socrates was saying ridiculous things because the guy he was
talking to was a total fucking moron.

Most scholars go for interpretation B. The word "meno" in Greek, as
it's spelled in the dialogue, actually means "I stay" or "I don't go
anywhere." But Meno is the name of the guy that Socrates is talking to
in the dialogue. Meno is kind of bullheaded and unimaginative, and
every time Socrates tries to explain an idea, Meno doesn't get it.
Eventually Socrates compares the working of the mind to a chariot
race; if it had happened today, he would have been saying, "OK, Meno;
see if you can figure this out. The mind is like NASCAR." He also
spends some time teaching Meno's slave boy geometry; some people say
the point of it was to demonstrate to Meno that all he had to do was
open his mind and think for five minutes.

Either way -- because of all this I take anything which comes from
Plato with massive grains of salt. It's like quoting Shakespeare -- it
sounds very authoritative, but the reality is that just because he had
a character in a play say it, doesn't mean he actually believed a word
of it. In fact if you're writing a play you might have people say
stuff that is the exact opposite of what you believe, in order to
represent ideas you disagree with, or even have characters say things
that are the exact opposite of what **they** believe, in order to
enable scenes of suspense and deceit, which obviously happens in a
large number of Shakespearean plays.

So -- Plato said that Socrates said there was a continent called
Atlantis. Already we're playing telephone, but assume that this is
what Socrates actually said. The thing is, Socrates was very
knowledgeable, but he was not above making shit up. In addition to
being the kind of guy who did from time to time make things up just to
fuck with people -- which is one of the reasons they killed him -- the
Greeks in that day had great reverence for the Egyptians. The Greeks
got geometry from Egypt, and Plato's dialogues on geometry are almost
religious in their reverence. Actually "almost" is bullshit. Plato
**was** religious about geometry. Pythagoras was too; when he
discovered the Pythagorean Theorem, he actually sacrificed a bull.
Normally in those days people sacrificed bulls to the gods, but
Pythagoras was an atheist. He sacrificed the bull to geometry.

Anyway, long story short, the Greeks had a very high opinion of the
Egyptians at the time, and if Socrates says, as he does in the
dialogue where he introduces the language of Atlantis, that "this is
an ancient Egyptian legend," he could be telling the truth, and he
could be just saying that because it makes the story sound like more
of a big deal in the mind of his audience. There are definitely
dialogues in which he introduces things as "Egyptian legends" which
are almost certainly not actually legends from Egypt. Long story
short, the legend of Atlantis comes from Socrates, and any time it's
Socrates people are talking about, you want to find out not just what
he said, but who he said it to, and what kind of mood he was in at the
time.

That was kind of overkill, but you have to understand, before becoming
the kind of geek who learns computer languages for fun, I was the kind
of geek who learnt classical languages for fun.

All that being said, I haven't actually read the dialogue with
Atlantis in it in a very, very long time, and I have to admit, the
correlations on that web site are surprisingly specific.

Just as a side note, now that Socrates has popped his name into this
conversation. Everytime i see or hear his name i always flash back to
So-Crates (as it was pronounced in Bill and Ted's). God damn did that movie
rock. Too bad my buddy moved away, i'd be all down to dress up like bill an=
d
ted again this year for halloween.
 Now back to atlantis. I remember watching a Discovery channel show about
this and aside from finding that there may be a few possible locations for
atlantis, they discovered on in the mediterranean. I think it was an island
called Santorini, but i'm not totally sure, it was a while back that i saw
this, and all the stuff i pull up about santorini doesnt seem to ring a bel=
l
other then the name. Anywho...they discovered an underwater island of sorts=
.
It was the top of a volcano, and it appears that due to a violent eruption
or earthquake it was shook and sunk under water.
 They have sent divers down to check it out and they have found signs of
civilization. And it does appear to be in the shape of several rings just a=
s
Atlantis much in the way Atlantis was described. They will be continuing to
explorer this site for evidence of Atlantis. It's centralized location to
places like egypt, greece and italy could explain how survivors (if any)
were "deposited around the world" (the known world at the time) and able to
spread the same story among many differant civilizations.
 As a side note to the "known world" the Great Flood with Noah and his ark.
Wasn't a world wide flood per say as it was just a major flood that occured
in an area where when all was said and done appeared to have covered the
whole world. They've found underwater around the edges of the Black Sea
signs of civilization and are hypothosizing that this could have been the
area of the Great Flood. Water from the medditeranean rose (probably due to
melting glaciers) and since the area of the Black sea is below sea level,
the water came across the land and flooded that area in a rather short
amount of time, and thus "flooded the world"
 The one aspect of this that it doesnt really account is the fact that just
about every civilization from around the world has some sort of Great Flood
story in its history. If they all happened at the same time, who knows, if
so were they all caused by the melting of glaciers and such, possibly. The
one thing that sucks is we'll never know. It was too far in the past and
there's no way we would be able to find definitive evidence to support
either side of the argument. Some of these "great floods" could have been
caused by tsunamis either created by earthquakes or land slides. There are
just too many variables to account for, which is so frustrating. I would
love to know the answers. I hope that one day when i finally die, that i do
get to see all the answers. Like a giant cheat shett gets handed to you by
death so you have something to ride as you take your trip across the river
styx (domo arigato mr. roboto). A cheat sheet and a stat sheet is all i
want. I want to know all the answers to life the universe and everything
(42) and i wanna know how many drugs i took, how much money i made and
spent, how many miles i walked, how many times i fucked, all those life
stats (like in GTA) that would be awesome, in i'm so curious to see if that
really does happen i just might off and kill my *BLAMMO*...............

Cool - I actually never knew that about Socrates. Good on ya for the 411.

One thing tho - was he prone to going into that much detail when fabricating 
stories? Because his dialogues on Atlantis (if I remember correctly) are 
pretty damn specific.

Either way, this is a nifty thread.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] nrr: nazca, peru

I have seen that show - and Santorini has actually been considered as one of 
the likely spots for Atlantis since at least the late 70's. Also Bimini in 
the Bahamas, and a few other locations worldwide.

The thing about the South American theory that gets me juiced, is that there 
has been evidence of cocaine and other herbs/plants ONLY native to the 
Americas found in Egyptian mummies, dating back to the old kingdom of Egypt 
that suggests that there HAD to have been trade of some sort between the 
continents.

The Norwegian explorer Thor Heyerdahl did research on this, and proved that 
reed boats (used in ancient times) could indeed cross the oceans. Ther's no 
direct EVIDENCE thus far that this has happened, but there's a whole shit 
load of circumstantial evidence that suggests that it had to have happened. 
For instance, there's a temple/pyramid somewhere in South Africa (on an 
island off the coast anyway) that appears to be the same design as all the 
South American pyramids. Not like the Egyptian ones at all.

Interesting shit...

OH MY GOD THAT'S THE FUNKY SHIT!!!!
 That button rocks. And everytime i read the subject line I <heart> Shazbot=
,
for some reason i keep readin it as I <hate> Shazbot. Which i really do. Hi=
s
bleepy bloopy techno makes me poop my pants, and it's getting a little
annoying to have to keep bringing extra underwear and pants to the "rave"
parties he plays at. You can see me doing the butt scootin boogy on the
dance floor with my candy backpack, filled to the brim with tickle me elmo
underroos and trance pants.
 I do have a question for Shawn though, did you get the name Shazbot from
Futurama? That's the first thing i thought of when i first saw your name on
a flyer or sfraves or whereever it was that i first saw it, and i was like
Shazbot...that guy took his name from Futurama.
 Bleepin and Bloopin all up in your mom's bidness,

hahahaha dum dum...that reminds me of that little green alien dude from the
flintstones, kazoo or whatever his name was.
 So it's from Mork and Mindy huh? I dont quite remember that, but i dont
really remember that show much anyway. I just remember the spock hand signa=
l
and nanoo nanoo and Robin Williams being incredibly high on Coke...which i'=
m
sure it was explains the weird sounds and words he came up with on that
show.
 Speaking of Robin Williams, who here has seen that one stand up act he had
in the 80's where he was so incredibly hopped up on coke you could
practically see it oozing out of his pours? He's super intense and super
sweaty and he's running around stage and at one point he even climbs up to
one of the balcony seats. Man that act was great...and to think i thought h=
e
was just crazy back then. Wasnt till i was older and found out he was a cok=
e
fiend, that i finally realised where all that energy came from.
 *sigh* I sure do miss good coke, and i'm sure when i started doing it, it
wasnt anything like it was back then.

Yeah totally, that's why i preferred meth. Much more bang for my buck. $150
worth of coke would last me a night. Where as $150 worth of meth could last
me a week, although one time a friend and i did about $90 worth in about an
hour and a half. Man was that intense. And with the numberous manufacturers
of meth, it wasnt all that hard to find, where as with coke you had to
search and search and search.
 I look back now and i'm so glad i moved outta oregon. That place would hav=
e
been the death of me. I no longer had to buy meth anymore, i knew so many
people who either did it or dealt it, i got it for free all day everyday.
Granted the very day i moved down here i had already found a meth hook up,
but it didn't pan out for very long because it was a little more involved t=
o
get it rather then calling up a friend and "hanging out" for a while. And m=
y
usage dropped off almost instantly. I still managed to do it a little bit
here and there, but it was growing fewer and further inbetween, and now i'v=
e
been off that shit for 3-4 years. I still sometimes think about it and thin=
k
man it sure would help out in this situation or that situation or whatever,
but then i think about how it lasts a lot longer then any given situation
requires and it just doesn't go away when your done needing it.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] I <heart> shazbot buttons

Speaking of drugs and buttons, anyone ever see that 21 jumpstreet
where there was an out of control club where everyone was tripping out
and they couldn't figure out how all these people were getting the
drugs and it turned out that the promoters were handing out buttons
for a small fee and when you took them apart there was acid on the
paper inside the button.

I want 21 Jump Street on DVD. I want to see how Johnny Depp got started.

Anyhoo -- let's move away from the whole drug thing for a moment, and
consider instead a legal, approved activity, the relentless

get is this new flatscreen monitor called the LSD-25. This thing kicks
ass:

No shit.

Lance Mountain is *legendary* from my parts.

Original Pro-skater, Powell-Peralta Bones Brigade -- I have an autographed 
shirt from him and the rest of the Bones-Brigade (Hawk,Steadham,Guerrero,
Caballero,McGill,Mullen...) from Vancouver '86 (dates-me-pre-rave)

Lance Mountain was also a videographer for the recent 'Lords of 
DogTown' movie, working with Peralta.

Pretty much figured there's 2 Lance's, unless he want's to come out and 
I'll kiss his feet...publicly...but only on camera ;-)

OtherWorld has a quarter-pipe, moved aside during parties, did I mention 
that?

Some DJ's spin, some mix.  This is for DJ's who mix.  I have a portable 
hard disk recorder, a pair of Peavey PR-12's, and an ambition to 
develop a party style with somebody creative.  It would be great to go 
somewhere people haven't been before, though I don't know where it is 
yet.  If that sounds like fun, please contact bluefire at greyotter dot

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: PAOLO MOJO

OK.. all U last minute groovers... check this out!!  Happening 2night..
sorry late w/ BSP.. but hear ya go!

PAOLO MOJO on 10/22/05 at 111 Minna
http://drive.c.topica.com/maad6OCablfrMbPMgUxeaehqpO/
Sure, "genre-fication" is not in the dictionary. But neither is
"genre" in PAOLO MOJO's dictionary. In this day and age of
identifying dance music to ridiculously specified sub-genres
(electrotechydiscopunk or psyraggadrum'ndbreaks come to mind) we are
extremely proud to bring you the San Francisco debut of this UK
DJ/Producer who doesn't have a clue what the word is. PAOLO MOJO
said himself he doesn't understand "this 'genre' bollocks." To him,
music is about selecting the "best bits of a wide range of sounds
and put[ting] them together in a way that just makes sense to
people." Isn't it apropos that his latest CD Release (with Cass of
Cass and Slide) is called "Heretic?"

So join us for an evening of blasphemously good music and dance to

Are you sure it was a mistake? I deleted all the butt-plugging and

Subject: [sfraves] I really shouldn't do this

but here is a piece of music with an egregiously offensive name:

http://www.gilesgoatboy.org/audio/super_powered_bitch_magnet.mp3

I hope it helps all you mutant mack daddies score some super-powered bitche=

it's basically ridiculously aggro acid breaks. in fact it sounds more
like acid techno at 135bpm with a breakbeat. honestly, I don't know
what the hell I was thinking.

kinda fits for Halloween, though.

Dam. I so wish I could have been there. That guy is off the hook. I'm not sure about calling him a "new" or "emerging dj though. He's been pretty big in the tech-house community for a few years at least.

http://drive.c.topica.com/maad6OCablfrMbPMgUxeaehqpO/
Sure, "genre-fication" is not in the dictionary. But neither is
"genre" in PAOLO MOJO's dictionary. In this day and age of
identifying dance music to ridiculously specified sub-genres
(electrotechydiscopunk or psyraggadrum'ndbreaks come to mind) we are
extremely proud to bring you the San Francisco debut of this UK
DJ/Producer who doesn't have a clue what the word is. PAOLO MOJO
said himself he doesn't understand "this 'genre' bollocks." To him,
music is about selecting the "best bits of a wide range of sounds
and put[ting] them together in a way that just makes sense to
people." Isn't it apropos that his latest CD Release (with Cass of
Cass and Slide) is called "Heretic?"

So join us for an evening of blasphemously good music and dance to
one of the best emerging DJ/Producers today. But don't take our
word for it.

"Paolo is one of the most talented new DJs; he?s a man you?ll be
hearing a lot more from."
? John Digweed

"He is constantly pushing and finding quality house music. One of
the best new DJs for sure."
? Hernan Cattaneo

"He plays GOOD music!"
? Lee Burridge

Enough said. We'll see you on the dancefloor!

Subject: [sfraves] (SRR) Missy elliott beat question.

Now I wonder if missy elliott paid royalties to Juan Atkins for using the 
"Clear" beat in her latest song I think the on  that she won a grammy for. I 
would assume she did since it is just a well known track and im sure word 
would have gotten out..

But does anyone know if she lists him in the credits for the track? If not 
that is just shady cause that beat makes the whole song.

Just my thoughts.

Mac

mmmmm blotter. blotter...blotter...blotter....i love blotter.
 I got a dope ass flyer for a party once that was on blotter paper, and it
was all perferated just like the real thing. Still have it too. That's one
flyer that was too cool to throw away.
 Anyone on the list remember Al Jourgensen's side project, Acid Horse? One
of my old bosses had an Acid Horse record and still have the original
blotter paper that came with it. Lucky bastard. I found the record once, bu=
t
it didnt have the blotter paper with it so i didnt pick it up.
 Speaking of cool additions to vinyl, my friend has a cheech and chong
record that came with a giant rolling paper in it. We were gonna use it onc=
e
for a huge ass joint. Never got around to it, we couldnt break down and do
it since it was the only one we had. Then one day we pulled it out just to
look at it, and there will small pieces missing out of it, someone cut smal=
l
pieces out of it to roll up joints. Turns out it was out phat friend Phatty=

Subject: Re: [sfraves] I really shouldn't do this'

uh huh. right. were you cringing when you tried to sell my father
canned soup over the Internet? was that my fault too?

SPAM MONKEY!!!

seriously apologies for the offense. I wish I could rename it
"super-powered nice girl magnet." but as Troy can attest if he took a
sec to talk to those bitches, it doesn't work that way. the first time
I turned on the super-powered bitch magnet, I thought I was in heaven.
then all those bitches started talking. "who the hell are you?" "what
am I doing here?" "do you have any better music? like Eminem or
something?"

fortunately, since then, I have designed the super-powered bitch catapult.






(Jesus. I knew I shouldn't have done this...)

hmmmmmmmmmmmm. no comment.

but I will say:

http://www.gilesgoatboy.org/audio/turn_it_up.mp3

since we're on that whole gangsta rap vibe thanks to Mr. Diaz.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] BSP: PAOLO MOJO

Ya I went to go see that show after reading about him on sfr.  It was pretty 
solid.. the guy has a great way of keeping the beats rolling in and out of 
differing styles without letting the breakbeat break-off track, or getting 
lost in transition.. I thought that was pretty sic, even though I wasn't 
into all the varios styles he played.. but he was pretty much flawless on 
the deck and nice as hell.. I went to talk to him afterword and he's all.. 
hit me up for a free cd.. so I did.. Kewl mofo fo sho!

Ranger

ps.. 111 mina is always fun as hell.. I always meet so many people when I 
go.. lol.. I think it's cuz all the homies get way to f'ed up and their 
girls are all like.. well ok.. what's your name..hehe.. makes me laugh 
everytime.

Dam. I so wish I could have been there. That guy is off the hook. I'm not 
sure about calling him a "new" or "emerging dj though. He's been pretty big 
in the tech-house community for a few years at least.

PAOLO MOJO on 10/22/05 at 111 Minna
http://drive.c.topica.com/maad6OCablfrMbPMgUxeaehqpO/
Sure, "genre-fication" is not in the dictionary. But neither is
"genre" in PAOLO MOJO's dictionary. In this day and age of
identifying dance music to ridiculously specified sub-genres
(electrotechydiscopunk or psyraggadrum'ndbreaks come to mind) we are
extremely proud to bring you the San Francisco debut of this UK
DJ/Producer who doesn't have a clue what the word is. PAOLO MOJO
said himself he doesn't understand "this 'genre' bollocks." To him,
music is about selecting the "best bits of a wide range of sounds
and put[ting] them together in a way that just makes sense to
people." Isn't it apropos that his latest CD Release (with Cass of
Cass and Slide) is called "Heretic?"

So join us for an evening of blasphemously good music and dance to
one of the best emerging DJ/Producers today. But don't take our
word for it.

"Paolo is one of the most talented new DJs; he?s a man you?ll be
hearing a lot more from."
? John Digweed

"He is constantly pushing and finding quality house music. One of
the best new DJs for sure."
? Hernan Cattaneo

"He plays GOOD music!"
? Lee Burridge

Enough said. We'll see you on the dancefloor!

WHO: PAOLO MOJO with Hoj, Will Spencer and the Funky Cozy Crew
(Sinukus, Jonathan Beech, and Tim McCormack)

WHEN: Saturday, October 22, 2005 from 9pm to 2am

WHERE: 111 Minna Gallery

DOOR: $10.00 ::: $7.00 presales @ www.groovetickets.com
($7.00 before 10:00 p.m.)

Subject: [sfraves] nrr: AIM my robot!

I'm writing a bot. It needs to be able to handle all sorts of weird
input. Please go on AIM and send it weird messages. Its AIM id is
GilesGoogleBot.

It doesn't currently have any Google functionality, but when it does,
it's going to be really weird. Like that movie "Real Genius" weird. Or
"Ghostbusters" weird, if I get lucky.

Thank you!

The Loudest word in the world


"No"
---Rosa Parks.


In 1955, in Montgomery, Alabama, you didn't say no. You went to the 
back of the bus and you did what was expected of you. Without 
violence, without undue drama or pathos, disrespect or anger, Rosa 
Parks said no. And because she risked everything, 50,000 people put 
their lives on hold and, in her name, walked rather than ride the 
bus. They stood up against an injustice they had been tutored in 
their entire lives and forced themselves to ignore their own safety 
and fight back. Her sacrifice, and a lifetime of working towards 
justice, led to the rise of the Reverend Doctor Martin Luther King 
and his message of peaceful civil dissent. She changed the world with 
a single word, backed up by a lifetime's worth of conviction.

Rosa Parks' family told the press this evening that she passed away. 
No more information was available. She spoke in the voice of dissent- 
the voice of the spirit of this country. She spoke with the authority 
of Boston Tea Party-birthed decades of dissent and refusal to accept 
injustice. We have no way to judge what America would have looked 
like without her.

Ironically, her death is only days shy of Rosa Parks Nationwide Day 
of Absence Against Poverty Racism and War proposed for December 1st. 
Larry Holmes, an organizer with the Nationwide Day of Absence, said,

  "The government's response to the Katrina Hurricane disaster, along 
with the war in Iraq and the growing numbers of people without 
healthcare, employment and educational opportunities, and housing are 
a poignant reminder that the movement to end poverty racism and war 
is as urgent now as it was 50 years ago, We have an opportunity to 
turn one of the most important civil rights anniversaries into a 
powerful reaffirmation of our commitment to fight for racial 
equality, social justice and peace, the lofty goals that Dr. King 
devoted his short brilliant life to and ultimately sacrificed it for."

In New York City, the day will be marked with a march and rally on 
Broadway and Wall St. where civil rights leaders, including members 
of the King family and veterans of the Montgomery boycott will speak.

The Day of Absence is our chance to say "no", the way she did. It is 
our chance to stand up and follow her example to speak to the 
injustice we see around us. It is our chance to say that Healthcare, 
Housing, and Education are our human priorities as Americans-- Not 
War and Occupation, domination and economic colonialism. The civil 
rights movement in this country is not dead. It still needs each and 
every one of us as powerfully as it needed Ms. Parks. It still needs 
her word, the one she made famous, the one she used with such grace 
and skill, humility and bravery.

The loudest word in the world.

"No sage or savior has ever endorsed greed and gluttony as a path 
toward social justice or personal fulfillment.  These sane and 
enlightened people come to us from all cultures and all eras, 
sometimes knowing of each other but more often not.  Socrates and 
Jesus, Lao Tzu and Tolstoi, Gandhi and Martin Buber -- no one can 
find in their lives and words a jot of support for a political and 
economic regime that encourages the acquisition of wealth far beyond 
what is needed for the necessaries -- or even the restorative 
pleasures -- of life while consigning the masses to live and work in squalor."
-Stephen J. Fortunato, Associate Justice, Rhode Island Supreme Court.

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of 
the rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will 
gradually become visible."

The liberty of a democracy is not safe if the people tolerate the growth
of private power to a point where it becomes stronger than their
Democratic State itself. That, in its essence, is Fascism -- ownership of
government by an individual, by a group or by any controlling private
power.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] nrr: AIM my robot!

Actually I've already done that. The most important component of Weird
Science weird was a hot brunette with super-powers. To acquire that
component, just use the super-powered bitch magnet, and tweak a few
lines of code so that the super-powered female you obtain is only a
bitch to other people, but nice to you, which, if you remember, is
pretty much how it worked in "Weird Science." That's left as an
exercise for the reader. The GoogleBot system is really a whole nother
ball of wax. The GilesGoogleBot, if it is completed successfully, will
be followed by other GoogleBots. In fact if a suitable corpus of text
exists and is visible to Google, and AndyW is willing to grant his
permission, you can expect to see an AndyWGoogleBot sometime this year
or next. Should that occur, it will certainly be pretty weird.
However, I have to admit, unless you perceive AndyW very differently
than I do, it won't actually be particularly Weird Science weird.
It'll definitely fall at the Real Genius end of the spectrum.

I forgot why I was checking this address in the first place.

Check it out. Today, Jupiter moves into Scorpio. For more info google
"Jupiter Scorpio Oct 25." Long story short, for some of us, this is
going to be huge.

Watch the skies.

Subject: [sfraves] World Class Talent Comes to San Jose Tomorrow Night!

Karma Wednesdays and The Blue Monkey Lounge are proud
to present, 
Mr. David Alvarado
This is your only chance to catch one of the most
influential artists to come to San Jose in a long
time. With over 50 releases and remixes under his
belt, as well as his tracks making it on to Dj mixes
and compilations from such respected artists as John
Digweed, Terry Lee Brown Jr., Danny Howells, Jon
Marsh, John Selway, Carl Cox, Terry Farley, Pete
Heller, Josh Wink and Hipp-e to name a few. If you are
any kind of music fan, you owe it to yourself to come
down tomorrow night and catch this exclusive
appearance. That’s right! He’s not stopping in the
city, it’s San Jose, and then he’s out…

Oh and here’s the clincher…. ….It’s FREE! No cover, no
door charge, no hidden fees.
So you really have no excuse to miss this one……The
Blue Monkey Lounge is located at 1 E. San Fernando St.
in Downtown San Jose and features some of the tastiest
Tacos on the planet. See you tomorrow night!

David Alvarado’s Bio:
American underground music possesses a spirituality
and depth that can only come out of the cultural and
social melting pot that is unique to this country. As
someone who has spent more than a decade interpreting
his life experiences into music, David Alvarado has
mastered the art of creating music that truly touches
peoples souls, not only here in the U.S., but around
the world. He uses every sound, every image that comes
in to his life as his inspiration to make music that
evokes the spirit of an underground culture of music
that has existed for the last century. 
While growing up in Los Angeles David forged an
appreciation for music that was quickly being changed
by technology. His early experimentation lead him to
produce the "Las Americas Project", a single that
captured the attention of Plus8 records Richie Hawtin
and John Acquaviva, who at the time were in the
process of developing a new house imprint by the name
of Definitive Records. Through this relationship David
was introduced to other up in coming artist's and
labels such as the Toronto based Stickman Records and
Philadelphia DJ Josh Wink. His experience and exposure
to the growing house music community led him to begin
his own imprint, Bomb Records, which further
contributed to helping David expand his audience and
develop his signature sound as an artist. Bomb Records
not only was the vehicle by which David increased his
global audience, but also featured then up and coming
artists Kenneth Grahm, Eddie Amador, and Derrick
Carter.
The foresight that David exhibited with his own
production and the selections for his label quickly
sparked international interest and created a tour
schedule that grew increasingly demanding. Despite his
hectic travels David has remained focused in the
studio and completed an impressive body of work for
his own label, and for highly respected labels
including Ovum, Ultra, Strictly Rhythm, Yoshi Toshi,
Plastic City, and Peace Frog. In addition to his work
as an artist he has created a catalog of highly
acclaimed mix CDs for Chicago's Guidance Records,
Madrid's Deep Sessions Vol. 2 and United DJs of
America Vol. 15. All of which are now considered
classics in there own right.
This amazing producer whose tracks have been described
as having the longest shelf life of any releases a
record shop could carry is still hard at work
capturing the hearts and souls of a new generation of
electronic music fans. He has also developed a new
record label Sunchildren which brings an amazingly
beautiful, sexier twist to the already established
West Coast house sound. David asserts that the label
will incorporate eclectic Latin, Brazilian, and
African elements to bring a much welcomed warmth &
sensuality to the genre. If this new angle proves to
be as influential as his previous projects it will no
doubt keep West Coast House and David Alvarado right
where they belong, in the center of the world house
arena.

Subject: [sfraves] nrr: alternatives to sky-watching

1. Do something.
2. Do something else.
3. Continue doing things until satisfied.

It just occured to me, I'm sure most people have enough common sense
to realize this, but just in case, "watch the skies" is not an
assignment to be pursued until presented with further instructions;
you're supposed to just look up, take a quick gander, and then do
something. And stuff. On the offchance that anybody reads this stuff
and then spends hours watching the planet Jupiter through a telescope
as it moves into Scorpio, somehow expecting that to solve your
problems, well, that's not what I'm saying.

I just wanted to say thanks to all the people from the list that come out.
We had about 800 people show up and it was probably the best event in bay
since we lost second and jackson. Here are some pics for everyone to check
out

There should be some more pics on evolic.com <http://evolic.com> by the end

Next year look out for The Revenge of The Mad Hatter!

"No sage or savior has ever endorsed greed and gluttony as a path 
toward social justice or personal fulfillment.  These sane and 
enlightened people come to us from all cultures and all eras, 
sometimes knowing of each other but more often not.  Socrates and 
Jesus, Lao Tzu and Tolstoi, Gandhi and Martin Buber -- no one can 
find in their lives and words a jot of support for a political and 
economic regime that encourages the acquisition of wealth far beyond 
what is needed for the necessaries -- or even the restorative 
pleasures -- of life while consigning the masses to live and work in squalor."
-Stephen J. Fortunato, Associate Justice, Rhode Island Supreme Court.

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of 
the rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will 
gradually become visible."

He didn't learn to talk within the space of a few days, so I killed him.

(Hopefully I'll be more patient if I ever have kids.)

I'm building something out of his spare parts, but for the time being,
I've scaled back my ambitions to They Might Be Giants weird or Muppet
Show weird at best.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] HAPPY BIRTHDAY OSBY!!!!

I think he's 35-36 or so.

When I was still living there, he was 22 for the... 11th time, so
that'd make him 33.

It's been 3 birthdays since I was there, which would make him.. 36, I belie=
ve.

The only reason I remember this fact is because one night me and chris
were driving him home to hercules, and we got to see his ID.

In fact, I know osby's real name :)

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Freakers Balls Vs Meat Beat Manifesto

Otherworld - hands down. Their parties have been getting better and better 
each time, and this is sure to be insane. I mean, Meat Beat is playing for 2 
and a half hours! They don't do that at concert venues! Plus all the other 
dope music, the vibe, etc. Gonna be sick. I have seen the place transforming 
bit by bit for this party, and let me tell you - it's gonna blow your noggen 
how crazy that night is gonna be. All that for $15 - one of the cheaper 
"big" parties around this weekend. Talk about more bang for the buck....

Yeah, considering 2nd & Jackson was a ghetto ass spot.  If you're looking to
compare yourself to the cookie cutter parties that were at that
place..sure..go right ahead.  It's funny how people who haven't been around
all that long think 2nd and Jax was the shiz.  There were a handful of great
parties there...but for the most part..you can blame that place for the mess
of garbage events that were around in those days.  *cough* skills *cough*..

It's cool Osby, we miss ya though. I kept looking around for you all night.
Chris Jackson is just a played out hater who don't get booked any more and
that cool, he has always been a hater and always will. I had about 50 peopl=
e
tell me at the show the place reminded them of second and Jackson and I
thought that was pretty cool. We invested 10k into the show and are now
donating about 2k to Katrina victims from what we made back. Thanks for you=
r
support guys. And keep on hating CJ that's all you are really good at
anyways.

Chris Jackson is just a played out hater who don't get booked any more and
that cool, he has always been a hater and always will.<

Wow.  That's some good english there fella!  Funny thing is...I hate on
you...exculively.  Why you say?  Because you're an absolute toolbox who
doesn't even have the common sense to use friggin spell check evn though you
know I'll call you on it.  As far as me "not getting booked".  Not to sound
arrogant, but I turn down bookings all the time.  The last few shows I have
chosen to except have been for free....for crews I adore.  I'm sure if I
were truly *seeking* bookings, they'd be there.  As as far as skills go, I'd
chew you up and spit you out... 

>And keep on hating CJ that's all you are really good at
anyways.<

Well, that and producing music, Djing, running companies and being a damn
good father.  But yeah, hating....on your lame ass, has got to be one of my
finest qualities.


Good day sir,

CJ

Not to sound arrogant, Chris, but from the context of that first  
sentence, I believe you meant to say "accept" rather than "except".

Subject: [sfraves] David Alvarado in SJ 2 night.... 4 Free?

Karma Wednesdays and The Blue Monkey Lounge are proud
to present, 
Mr. David Alvarado
This is your only chance to catch one of the most
influential artists to come to San Jose in a long
time. With over 50 releases and remixes under his
belt, as well as his tracks making it on to Dj mixes
and compilations from such respected artists as John
Digweed, Terry Lee Brown Jr., Danny Howells, Jon
Marsh, John Selway, Carl Cox, Terry Farley, Pete
Heller, Josh Wink and Hipp-e to name a few. If you are
any kind of music fan, you owe it to yourself to come
down tomorrow night and catch this exclusive
appearance. That’s right! He’s not stopping in the
city, it’s San Jose, and then he’s out…

Oh and here’s the clincher…. ….It’s FREE! No cover, no
door charge, no hidden fees.
So you really have no excuse to miss this one……The
Blue Monkey Lounge is located at 1 E. San Fernando St.
in Downtown San Jose and features some of the tastiest
Tacos on the planet. See you tomorrow night!


David Alvarado’s Bio:
American underground music possesses a spirituality
and depth that can only come out of the cultural and
social melting pot that is unique to this country. As
someone who has spent more than a decade interpreting
his life experiences into music, David Alvarado has
mastered the art of creating music that truly touches
peoples souls, not only here in the U.S., but around
the world. He uses every sound, every image that comes
in to his life as his inspiration to make music that
evokes the spirit of an underground culture of music
that has existed for the last century. 
While growing up in Los Angeles David forged an
appreciation for music that was quickly being changed
by technology. His early experimentation lead him to
produce the "Las Americas Project", a single that
captured the attention of Plus8 records Richie Hawtin
and John Acquaviva, who at the time were in the
process of developing a new house imprint by the name
of Definitive Records. Through this relationship David
was introduced to other up in coming artist's and
labels such as the Toronto based Stickman Records and
Philadelphia DJ Josh Wink. His experience and exposure
to the growing house music community led him to begin
his own imprint, Bomb Records, which further
contributed to helping David expand his audience and
develop his signature sound as an artist. Bomb Records
not only was the vehicle by which David increased his
global audience, but also featured then up and coming
artists Kenneth Grahm, Eddie Amador, and Derrick
Carter.
The foresight that David exhibited with his own
production and the selections for his label quickly
sparked international interest and created a tour
schedule that grew increasingly demanding. Despite his
hectic travels David has remained focused in the
studio and completed an impressive body of work for
his own label, and for highly respected labels
including Ovum, Ultra, Strictly Rhythm, Yoshi Toshi,
Plastic City, and Peace Frog. In addition to his work
as an artist he has created a catalog of highly
acclaimed mix CDs for Chicago's Guidance Records,
Madrid's Deep Sessions Vol. 2 and United DJs of
America Vol. 15. All of which are now considered
classics in there own right.
This amazing producer whose tracks have been described
as having the longest shelf life of any releases a
record shop could carry is still hard at work
capturing the hearts and souls of a new generation of
electronic music fans. He has also developed a new
record label Sunchildren which brings an amazingly
beautiful, sexier twist to the already established
West Coast house sound. David asserts that the label
will incorporate eclectic Latin, Brazilian, and
African elements to bring a much welcomed warmth &
sensuality to the genre. If this new angle proves to
be as influential as his previous projects it will no
doubt keep West Coast House and David Alvarado right
where they belong, in the center of the world house
arena.

My apologies to Chris.  It seems the gray matter was mixing up Chris and
that WoW playing AndyW character (who DID play for *cough* skills
*cough*.  Whereas Chris DIDN'T.)

P.S. Sorry to point that out Andy.

how cold it is. :)

Hate is the GRATEST emotion, because it does not discriminate. Hate loves
hating everyone and everything. It's so easy and fun to hate. I have to
think and try to be nice, and i just don't have the time nor the energy to
do that, so i just let it flow out naturally.
 I'm gonna pour myself a nice steaming hot cup of hate and choke it down
with a few extra strength angst tablets.

Subject: [sfraves] raver corpses...  a new Boomerang tale

"A Rose For Emily"  (Faulkner revisited)  by boomerang fidget.

Featuring celebrities like Osby, Gheri, Red Stickman, Harken, Amber, Terry and Karina.
Emily, DJ Still and other characters are completely fictional.  It's 8 pages, but double-spaced
and lots of paragraph breaks--- pretty easy on the eyes.

happy halloween, and be safe.

love,
boomy

I designed t-shirts for my old band that said on the back "Take Time To 
Hate". I was inspired one day after being cut off by a some damn hippy that 
had the "random acts of kindness" bumper sticker on it.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Mad Hatter Crews Thank you

Funny how the kindness disappears once they are behind
the wheel.  But then we all have our little moments of
agression when driving.  Like George Carlin says,
"Have you ever noticed that anybody driving slower
than you is an idiot, and anyone going faster than you
is a maniac?"

My 2.5 year old son recently told my wife that "papa
doesn't like the cars that are in front."  

So get out of my way idiots...

Warm Regards,

Peter

P.S. Sorry about the De Young thing...did you go?

LOL. I just think far too few people pay attention while driving. Slow or 
fast makes no nevermind to me - it's all about how alert you are. With my 
last job, I drove all day every day - and let me tell you, VERY few people 
pay attention to what's going on around them. I sincerely believe it's the 
main cause of traffic.

And no - haven't been to the DeYoung yet - planning on going soonish. The 
exhibit is there till February methinks.

There's a shortish blurb about the idea in the book "Days of War, Nights
of Love" from CrimethInc.  And even though some of their Anarchistic
thoughts derive from the infantile, J.C. says check it out.

Yeah totally. I'm a fast driver. Not really a speeder...(speeders are peopl=
e
who fly and weave through traffic) i just drive fast. 80-90 is confortable
cruising speed for me, slower and i feel weird. Faster is fine, just not
really prudent most of the time. If you're gonna drive slow, please at leas=
t
be aware. If you're in the fast lane and people are passing you, get the
hell over. If you look in your rear view mirror and you see me way behind
you and when you look back in your mirror and you see me right on your ass,
get the hell outta the way.
 Can't remember where i heard it. i think it was a history or discovery
channel show about the Auto Bahn. But basically it said that the Germans
thought the americans were stupid because we are forced to drive a certain
speed limit but we're allowed to go from lane to lane. Where as on the Auto
Bahn you can drive as fast as you want, but you have to stay in the left
lane. The right lane is for passing only and as soon as you've passed
someone you have to get back into the left lane. You can get ticketed for
driving in the right hand lane and your not passing someone.
 I think they should enforce that rule here. That way everyone will line up
all nice and perfectly. There will always be a lane for you to pass in
instead of getting over to pass someone only to find the retards in that
lane are slowing down and then your stuck between 2 lanes of idiots driving
slow.

(this has nothing to do with raves, but wtf.)

GilesGoogleBot is dead. if you talked to him during his brief life,
thank you very very much. the new robot's name is SkippyTalkBot. you
can find him on AIM. if you want to talk to him, please do, and ping
me (dreamstooloud) if he does anything weird.

so far I've had one terrific conversation with him:

[17:12] dreamstooloud: yo
[17:12] SkippyTalkBot: Joe.
[17:12] dreamstooloud: monkey
[17:12] SkippyTalkBot: Intelligent satire for the unwashed masses.
[17:12] dreamstooloud: happy penguins
[17:12] SkippyTalkBot: Madagascar.
[17:13] dreamstooloud: what time is love?
[17:13] SkippyTalkBot: Wonder.
[17:13] dreamstooloud: all right baby, that shit made sense to me. perfect.
[17:13] SkippyTalkBot: I left the house.

I really feel like we bonded.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Mad Hatter Crews Thank you

You can pass on the left on the Autobahn - I dunno who said otherwise. The 
thing w/ German drivers is, they flick their lights on and off WAY behind 
you to let you know "I'm a comin' - get out the damn way!". If you DON'T - 
they get RIGHT UP ON YOUR ASS at high speeds, and will flick their lights 
and beep their horns at you till you get out of the way. German drivers 
don't fuck around - and I praise them for it.

In fact, when I drive, I drive like I'm on the autobahn, and it tends to 
work just fine. lol

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Mad Hatter Crews Thank you

I've been reading Car & Driver and Road & Track for ever since I was a
kid and they always pointed out that speed has nothing to do with the
amount of accidents. the number one thing that causes accidents is
people not paying attention.

Also, I remember in my high school drivers Ed class, after watching
"red asphault" on projector was the grey haired, tenured teacher
saying this quote: "All accidents can be avoided by just paying
attention".

We tried to challenge him on this, but he always had a perfect wise,
logical, response.

Subject: [sfraves] My 1st Jungle weeklie  here in UK

OK.. so after a day of like well.. I kinda nooo.. actually all we did was
like run errands & like well.. i wanted 2 go 2 a music shop 'cause like i
figure the imports that I always see there in the music shops home, I
could get here & they'd be here.. ok, i confess, i was looking for *NSYNC
albums... no luck :(  Although i ende dup getting 3 CDs.. LoL

So we chill for a bit.. then Carol finds this new Jungle weeklie close by
her pad.. then we go! The weeklie is called The Style Of The Streets...
it's hip hop, jungle, old skool... I guess we missed the 1st DJ spin
Hardcore 'cause this dude told me it was hardocre earlier (gggggr :(  )...
so they were spinning jungle.. oooooooooh my goooosh.. Hello 2Day.. so the
1st hour we were there... I guess they didn't do sound check or whatever
the fuck 'cause this DJ was on & he was traaaain wreeeecking like crazy...
his levels were always fucked, the sound system was kinda shot 2 a degree,
ummm... yeah.. it wqas bad... whenever the DJ dude tried 2 mixin a new
song, he was off like by a second, ya know when that happens & like it
kinda adds this reverbish sound 2 the beat?  Oh yeah.. the DJ who spun
hardcore earlier that night was DJ Uproar if i for to mention...

So after a loooong while, the DJ who spun hardcore earlier went on &
tagged w/ the DJ who was like mondo wrecking... he sorted the mixer, got
levels right... hmm.. i wonder if there was a monitor back behond the
booth?  Anywaze, the mixing did get batter, but i dunno...

So we were still like ther & i was just dancing... oh oh oh.. so the crowd
was like this yooungish crowd & hmmm... i doubt any of them were
junglists.. there was this like Black Leather snobby girl fem Barbie Doll
dress squad there just like strikin' these mondo poses on the dance floor
2 show of their asses 2 the beat.. no really.. they were... anywaze, Queen
Ass Crack of their tribe was this Girl, see they all wore like balck tops
& jean btms.. the leader of their crew (LoL.. I giuess) was wear a leather
black vest top thingie, 2 short IMO, & this short ass jean skirt w/ an
oversized belt.. Hello 2Day.. so yeah.. when she was dancing, moving,
bending over.. her ass crack kinda mooned people, everyone.. oooooh.. so
sad

Anywaze, Queen Ass Crack (w/ no g string even) i dunno man.. OK.. & I'm so
not lying about this.. but she started getting all up on me.. literally..
she kept touching while she swayed 2 the beat, she moved her face
heeeeeeella close 2 mine, I swear i got drunk smelling her breath, Hello
2day.. she even like backed into my croch area w/ her booty & tried 2 make
me freak her... I mean.. by them, the mixing was somewhat better & I was
feelin' the Groove & i just wanted 2 dance by myslef.. but oooh my
goodness, oh my gosh man... this girl wouldnot give up seducing me i guess
& it so was not working... I even started kick stepping 2 get her away
from me.. she tried kick stepping also but almost like fell off her nigh
heel leather boots... but she did reel in this skinny white boy who i
guiess got disgusted w/ her after like a long time.. he fuckin pushed the
corner of her sholder & waked away.. LoL.. this really happend man.. I
would soooo  not make that up!

Ummm.. there wre these 3 MCs who passed the Mic off like alot... it was
kinda lame 'cause they like would MC over each other, there was this 1
Groovy MC outta the bunch of them... MC Brownie.. CooL guy! :)  We chatted
alot actually...

I dunno.. I was getting pissed @ the DJs and didn't  really feel it
anymore, so we left after spending another hour there.. uugghh.. so sad!

The crowd was small.. like seriously.. 12 people if not like 2 or 3 more
than that... yeah.. it was what it was... hmmm.. Hopefully the events i go
2 this weekend will make up 4 this big mondo fuckin ooops night!

Well.. that's it 4 now... I think i'm either goin' ice skating or bowling
2morrow...

It was it fuckin' was 2night!  Hmmm.. i hope i kick it w/ that Brownie
Dude again.. he was really CooL!

Well can I respond to this thread without any future negativity being added
in??? O_o Much props to Chris sticking with techno, SF has been deprived of
it for so long (at least in larger amounts), and so many of these younger
kids don't have a clue about it now days- especially the detroit stuff and
real ELECTRO : / You ever up to spin a renegade outdoor in 2006 Mr Jackson?
Google Acid Totem :)

Subject: [sfraves] THUMP'O'WEEN II  -  M3, DJ Dragonfly, Logic Bomb, DJ Anti, Penta + more...Only 3

So we’ve been doing Trance events for 6+ years now and I can’t say that I’ve 
been more pleased with a line-up in the main room as I am with what we’ve 
got coming up on Friday for Thump’O’Ween II.  As many of you will recall 
from last years Thump’O’Ween, the energy and costumes and décor were 
supremely sublime and we’re looking forward to another rocker this year too.

And don’t me wrong – Hallucinogen, Penta, Sphongle were amazing, but the 
direction and journey of the main room was a bit all over the place.  This 
year, come early and stay late, and the journey we’ll be taken on cannot be 
beat in the world of trance, imho.

10-11:30 – dob (eggbeats) <--- chunk’n’funk’n it out to get things started – 
one of the few DJs that really understands how to start a room and set the 
tone.  Nice to have you back at (((thump))) Bry.  ;)


11:30-2 – DJ Anti (spiral trax) <----- We are so excited to have Anti 
back!!!  He’s been fighting the good fight all over the world representing 
the harder edge hypnotic psy-progressive sound to some of the giants of the 
house and progressive world.  Anti’s previous sets at our past (((thump))) 
events have been legendary – truly – and his set is sure to be slamming, 
deep, bouncy and fun.  Sooooooo stoked for this.


2-3:30 – LOGIC BOMB!!!  (tip world, Sweden)  <----  What can I say?  It has 
been over 3 years since Logic Bomb have played SF – an appendicitis 
prevented them from being at our Solstice outdoor in 2003 – and SF has been 
waiting and we are salivating for this set.  As many have said to me since 
we announced this, “Logic Bomb is…the bomb!”  Pumping bass with complex 
Goa-esque melodies – look out beloooooooow.


3:30-?  -- PENTA (auraquake – Russia – SF)  <----- Next level – open your 
mind super Nu-Full-on no holes barred reach for the sky uber-trance.  Nikita 
is back and just as he did last year, his set will drag the entire party 
into another dimension.


I’ve loved creating some great line-ups for our parties over the years and 
this one has come together as one of the best.  I’ll be planted on the sweet 
spot all night.  See u there.  :)


We’ve also got Haunted HOUSE from:  M3, TRACY, JT, TASHO

BREAKS from: FIDDLER, Jocelyn and guests

CHILLOUT from:  DJ DRAGONFLY, WATERJUICE, REDSTICKMAN and Peek

Me too.

I think we're also doing visuals for this shindig.

Kevin's been in the Viberation studio making some whacked out Halloween 
video shit. We're also locked and loaded to support MBM's show =)

There's also a SFR personality from the distant-past on our Vibe crew 
coming out to make a ruckuss...

Good times =)

Hey SFR list, I figured this might be the place to offer this position
first :-) We have a short term data entry position in San Jose (Possibly
telecommute) needed to fill right away who is an excellent listener,
fast learner, internet savvy to put all the inventory data and images
into our new inventory control system. The company is Techniglobal
Industries, Corp. www.techniglobal.com/test  which is launching 11/15/05
so we are more than behind ;-) please pass this around and have the

Spooky!  Very nice words, my man. :)

Kind of wish the world was not in decay, oh bother.  Some recent
parties have been great, though.

Poop.

Subject: [sfraves] SRR: Speaker repair advice?

so i bought some speakers off Craigslist recently.  in the past, i've
had awesome luck and have two Cerwin Vega subs and two Yamaha tops.

i just got two JBL TR-125s for a ridiculously good price.  but when i
got home it appears that one speaker is broken.

the woofer doesn't fart and i don't see any tears.  it's just that the
sound coming out is very muffled and low, no matter how much juice i
pump through it.

other speaker is fine.

any suggestions as to where to take this bad boy?  any "do it
yourself" tips to diagnose the problem?

Subject: [sfraves] Mix Set from my taggin' partner in DC....

This is a mix my hetero-lifemate El Ian (aka Luigi, bka Daniella Downs) made 
this week. This is the cat I normally tag-team with when I spin in the 
DC/Baltimore area. Very cool guy - very sick DJ. He's opened for Lee Coombs 
on his own, just had a headlining slot at Cubik (aka Buzz) in Washington DC, 
and together with me we've opened for Reid Speed, Richard "Humpty" Vission, 
Scott Henry & more.

Without further adieu - ENJOY!!! (Oh - and don't ask me why he has a female 
DJ name - it has something to do with sounding like a porn star or some 
shit, lol). It's only 55 minutes long, so a quick bump - but to the point.

DJ Daniella Downs - Definition: Tech

or if that doesnt work -

2. skeewiff - man of constant sorrow (d.ramirez mix)
3. martijn ten velden & lucien foort-bleeep
4. ajello - that's true (elite force mix)
5. koma and bones - time waster
6. nick muir - frankenstein (kg mix)
7. koma and bones - rubber mullet
8. freakazoids - what is a dj - (lee coombs vocal mix)

I leave town for a few days and miss out on the chance to put my English

trance I swear), apply for a new career in data entry, hate on people
calling THEIR OWN PARTY the best the bay has seen in years, and of course
make fun of Osby on his birthday (Happy fucking birthday Osbyloo!!!).  Ah,

Subject: [sfraves] OUTRAGE returns: a Jungle Club in Essex I just came from

OK.. so the drive from Rochester to Essex is like looooooong.. think SF to
Sac distance... the place they have OUTRAGE: returns is this pub called
Molly Malone's & it wqs by this train station... so we get outta the car,
there's this couple fist fighting @ the train station... LoL.. Helllo
2Day... oh yeah... we lso got lost on this country road.. oh my gosh man..
i gotta tell y'all, the buildings & everything.. the old skool arcutecture
is just Awesome...

Anywze, got 2 the pub, then like well.. they were like hella charging us "
the door, but we were on GL 'cause my Homie Balistik did the sound... so
we get in... OK.. So Dope!  Ummm.. like it was Awesome.. OK.. strait
away.. i felt the vibe.. it was reeeeeally thick!  Every1 there was hella
fuckin' into the music.. the whole place was jumpin' w/ this Awesome
fuckin' energy.. Loved it!

The 1st DJ who we saw when we got in was spinning this hard dubby shit..
Loved it!!  Balistik bought me & Carol a drink & we had this yelling
conversation.. LoL.. Actaully it was Dope... 'cause Balistik & I have
known each other like online homies 4 like the past 2 years i guess... So
yeah.. LoL.. it was kinda surreal meating him & we had hella good chats
thoughout the night...

The 2nd DJ.. DJ Unix.. played some wicked shit.. he mixed w/ a deck &
CDJ.. so i'm assuming he played alota OG produced shit... OH My Gosh man..
danced hella hard 2 his set!  Yum!  Again.. all hard dubby stuff & some
liquid too!

The 3rd DJ was some1 I met online like a few nights ago when her &
Balistik were tagging on dnbradio.com.. her name#s NETAFEX.. oh ,y gosh..
so Sweet & when she spun... ooh man... her style is like Seraphim.. all
hard, evil shit dubby stuff.. it was Dope!!

Yeah man.. there was apoint when i ws dancing & this Dude who looked
exactly like Mobber was like arguing w/ another dude 7 he was ready 2 box
& hella drunk.. anywaze.. the only way that the fight didn't happen was
'cause his girlfriend, or maybe girl he  met @ the bar, kept kssing him &
holding his head... it was to far from that happening when they started
goin' so hardcore @ it... & I saw hands & hips moving where they shouldn't
be moving in a public place...

OH yeah.. since i still got a stash of SFLNC @Dancing's Not A Crime@
stickers... I gave some out ther & the peopel really liked them!!! LoL...
ummm.. NETAFEX put 1 on her Record Case like right away!!

Man.. OK... this is the start of a Really Fuckin' Awesome Weekend!  Good

Also, if anyone else is in the program and you would want to go, send me an

There are secular alternatives to AA.  One that I've heard good 
things about is LifeRing.  There are many meeting opportunities 
available in the Bay Area:  http://www.unhooked.com/meetings/meetings.html#1

LifeRing meets at the LGBT Community Center on Saturdays at 10:00 AM, Danny.

Much love,

Apollo

I'm sorry, but as someone who has lived with both parents and step parents being major alcoholics and drug addicts I have to respond to your condescending tone. It is because of AA and NA that my step father is sober today and that I am able to have a wonderful positive relationship with him. AA does not profess to "cure" you. It does however encourage you to discuss your reasons and problems in addiction and to face your own bullshit. There really isn't anyone in there that thinks they have the answer...they all are addicts and trying to help eachother. It's admitting that you are human and can have a substance dependency. Addiction is not a matter of you not having enough will power and there are plenty of atheists in the program. It doesn't work for everyone and there are breakthrough drugs coming around to help addiction but those are years into the future. My friend recently went into AA and he said it was more of a spiritual awakening than he had ever experienced in his life
 quite the opposite of "giving up his spiritual quest." I don't know if you've ever been on the verge of total addiction and losing everything important to you but I think at that point you might consider surrendering to a higher power. AA does not work for everyone but I would encourage anyone who is battling addiction to at least try it and if that doesn't work seek other help. Whatever works for you!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] AA meetings?

-----Original Message-----

There are secular alternatives to AA.  One that I've heard good 
things about is LifeRing.  There are many meeting opportunities 
available in the Bay Area:  http://www.unhooked.com/meetings/meetings.html#1


AA doesn't support any creed/religion/belief system over others.  it's *already* secular.

"surrendering to god or a higher power" is only part of it.  the rest of the sentence is "god - as you understand and relate to him/her/it"

My "god" is Truth.  Truth is what IS.  the Tao.  The Universe.  No old grey dude in the sky sitting on a throne. I look around me and see things as they ARE, and realize that when i'm not living in that reality-tunnel (part of which is: i should never ever drink alcohol), i am not living according to the Tao, or god's wishes, or however you want to think of it.  i lose every time.  we all know that fighting the Universe is a losing proposition, but there's some irrational draw that intoxicants can have over you.

which brings me to a point you brought up, Sean.  surrendering is really the only key to winning.  it took me a long time to figure this one out, because i consider myself a pretty bright guy who can usually solve problems with little to no trouble.  this makes me a GREAT architect and designer, but a terrible drunk. :-)

the reason why is this: THERE IS NO RATIONAL EXPLANATION FOR AN ADDICTION.  you try and try to think your way around it, trying to outsmart it or change up your habits or where you hang out, or who you hang out with, but it's impossible, because your addiction isn't playing by the rules of thought and rational behavior.  i thought that surrendering meant that i was giving up, and i wasn't capable of solving this problem on my own.  it was a pretty huge blow to my (quite substantial) ego to find out that, yeah, i CAN'T do it on my own.  kind of a mind fuck, really.

so without the 12 steps, which are really a personal method to recovering from an addiction, the best way i can summarize my path to sobriety is:

- First, acknowlege the Reality I live in. (this includes my body's constitution which makes me a psychotic with alcohol.)
- Figure out what i'm supposed to be doing. This can be any scale - from major life plans right down to being constantly aware of how my actions affect others.
- Once i've figured out what i'm supposed to be doing, GET TO WORK. make it happen.

i find that if i stay on my Right Path - the one that the Tao / Universe has in store for me - i am a much stronger person, and alcohol is no longer able to creep in and take me down.  This has a great side-benefit of constant self-improvement and learning and growing. Stay on the Path, philip. :-)

it's been a very enlightening trip thus far, and i'm still learning, but the real learning comes in teaching someone else. so, to that end, i would feel honored and blessed to talk more with anyone who might have any questions.... so please shoot me an email or call me at 415.255.9776 if you wanna chat.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] AA meetings?

I think it is simple...AA, NA, kwanza, kaballah, buddhism....
It is a belief system, different ways of life work for different people.  I 
am here to find out if aa or na works for me.  I was sober 3& 1/2 months and 
relapsed and this is where I stand now....Does drinking 24/7 provide my life 
with ANY good whatsoever?  Does the occasional line cause me to be in a 
space of certainty, so I can create the rest of my life making wise 
decisions?
Nope, and it took me over 11 years to figure this out, for me, myself.  
These are my issues, my choices.  Other people have shared similar thoughts/ 
feelings because they were involved with it as a child, now or maybe it has 
not happenned.  BUT Alcoholism is a serious thing, I am affected, I hate 
saying that i am an addict, so sometimes I don't when I go to a meeting.  I 
think anybody who has any nerve or God given right to judge anyone on this 
list needs to attend a few meetings first, or meet a loved one whom you know 
WILL die because of poor decision making, turned habit, turned "disease"
Trust me, I am the ultimate "overanalyzer" and I have thought these things 
over and over again....
I am not perfect, nor is anyone else, God did not intend that to be the case 
for anyone, especially Richard simmons.
I brought this topic up because I am in need of education, something new to 
teach me so I can move forward and bring some peace into my life.  Does 
anyone want to argue with that?  I am sure there will be one person at 
least.  I also brought this up because it is very relevant in the culture in 
which we live.  Alcohol is everywhere. People abuse it all the time, this 
goes for so many things...addiction is a mutherfucker.
I am not telling you to think this way or that.  I would love it if people 
were a bit more open to the fact that there are lots of people out there who 
live differently...and have different problems.  Why judge them when you can 
help just by being open to new conversation or by offering new 
ideas.......which brings me back to my origonal question...
"Does anyone know of any good AA meetings in SF?"
grr.
Danny

by the way, thanks for the alternative program offerings :)  Much 
appreciated...
I think I want to try the AA thing to learn what I need to and then move 
on...just like with learning to meditate and starting to do so at the 
Berkeley psychic Institute.  They showed me tools, tools that I can use to 
better myself in different ways...then I realized it was not for me based on 
MY experience.
bye.

Subject: [sfraves] Thanks to OW for a SLAMMING Halloween!!

Well goooooooooooood-damn!

Saturday night has to go down as one of the most fun nights I have ever had. 
The vibe was amazing, the talent was off the hook, and the party was epic.

Let's start off with the highlight - Meat Beat Manifesto. Fucking AMAZING 
show. Talk about total auditory and visual immersion. Some of the things 
they did simply blew my mind - especially all the video scratching, pure 
sickness. The beats were throbbing and funky, the vibe was hypnotic, they 
really took the crowd on a journey. On top of that, they're suuuuper nice 
folks, and were a pleasure to get to hang out with. Thanks again to OW crew 
for letting me pick up Ben & Jack before the gig - I had a great time 
conversating with them.

DJ Zeph - in both his solo set and the work he did w/ Azeem, he blew my 
mind. On par with someone like Z-Trip or A-Skillz, this guy has immense 
talent and is sure to go far. I got to kick it him a bit after his solo set, 
and he's a really nice guy on top of all that talent.

Azeem - this guy NEVER ceases to amaze me with how talented he is. His flows 
are impeccable, his rhymes are tight and intelligent. I for one am thankful 
I keep getting to see him in such an intimate setting as OW is. Some day 
this guy is gonna blow up and become huge, and I for one am all for it.

Fingermonsters - what can I say about our local SFRavers? AMAZING!! I was 
seriously impressed with the bangin' beats these 3 fuckers unleashed 
Saturday night. They looked like they were really having fun with the set 
too, and it came across in the tunes. As far as I'm concerned, they can play 
at every party I go to for the next few years, and I'll be a happy camper!

Forest Green & Mochipet - well hot damn. Techno & Electro served up on a 
silver platter, thick and chunky the way it should be. I 
reaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaly dug their set.

Praxis & DJ Yap - even though they played in different rooms at diff. times, 
I'm listing em together, cuz they both played booming sets, and I didn't 
catch either one's full set. Nevertheless, I am always impressed by them, 
and Saturday night was no exception. BOH!

I'm not sure who all caught myself and Bam's set - but I feel like we warmed 
things up proper. People kept coming up to me all night long saying how much 
fun they had during our set, so we musta been doing something right. Thanks 
to OW for letting us do our thing!!!

Also - big ups to Terry & Kevin from Viberation - the visuals were sick as 
usual!

(and it was great to see you again Ryan!!!! Welcome back!)

The rest of the night is a bit of a blur. I was running around connecting w/ 
people I know, meeting new folks, and being a Meat Beat Manifesto fanboy 
every chance I got. I actually hung out with them for quite some time, and 
had quite a few fun conversations with them all. Great bunch of folks. I 
still can't believe I got to see them in my friend's living room. Hehe.

Otherworld - how do you guys keep outdoing yourselves???? Saturday was 
seriously insane, and I thank all you of sincerely for your intense efforts. 
The party was 110% perfect. I couldn't have asked for a more fun Halloween, 
and all myfriends that came in from out of town had a blast!!!

Still afterglowing...
Marc(O)

Subject: [sfraves] AA

What a pleasant surprise to hear an alcoholism topic on a raves list.  
I drank heavily for 30 years and then stopped cold when my father died. 
  Apparently there was a connection.   88*D

I like going to AA meetings, because it's fun to be around people who 
are grappling with life in a positive way and often making substantial 
progress with their issues.  I am an alcoholic, and now I have no 
trouble saying I am an alcoholic.  My hardest issue around that was 
that I used to believe that I hadn't bottomed out badly enough to be 
worthy of the name "alcoholic."  I go play cards sometimes at an AA 
watering hole, the Castro Country Club, near 18th and Hartford.  It's 
my favorite place in the Castro to sit on a stoop and watch hot numbers 
walk by.

BIOGRAPHY

When you step inside the funky, soul-flavored house
built by Brian Varga (aka Halo), get ready to be
moved. This Chicago bred, House-fed DJ has been
wreckin decks everywhere from Japan to Korea, Brazil,
Australia, Israel, Africa, Turkey, and back to North
America, currently capturing the scene in Southern
California. He’s been groovin London’s Fabric now for
four years as a bi-monthly resident, and he’s no
stranger to gracing stages with the most infamous
faces in electronic culture. Now, with a successful
solo production career, a new album and a national
tour in the making, Halo’s house has the whole block
rockin. 

Inspiration was always close to home for Halo; born in
Chicago of 1974, he was introduced to house music in
the city most notorious for constructing it. He
recalls attending underground loft parties and
witnessing such visionaries as Gene Hunt,Larry
Heard,Diz, DJ Frique, Glenn Underground, Frankie
Knuckles, Boo Williams and countless others who
enticed his developing passion for Djing. Taking to
the decks at a mere 13 years of age, Halo was quick to
create alliances with hometown DJ’s and rapidly began
releasing solo and joint projects on Chicago’s Moody
Recordings.   

As the Midwestern dance scene grew stale, Halo craved
to move somewhere that had a fresh, untapped scene.
Halo fell in love with San Diego and relocated,
bringing his chicago roots out west with former friend
Hipp-e under the group name H-Foundation. Anxious to
do more than just spin records, Halo launched his own
Bluem Recordings in 2001, which celebrates almost
twenty releases from such legendary producers as DJ
Deep, Frank Rogers, Fresh & Low, Andre Harris, Jay-J,
Souldoubt and Charles Webster.   

Halo also recorded for a number of premium house
labels including Large, Seasons, Nordic Trax, NRK, Om
and Yoshitoshi and has remixed tracks by Afromystik,
Sumo, Heather, Nigel Hayes, Morgan Page and many more.
Selections from his discography appear on such high
profile compilations as Mark Farina’s Connect, Ben
Watt and Jay Hannan’s Lazy Dog Volume 1, Jay-J’s and
Miguel Migs’ In the House and Kaskade’s Soundtrack to
the Soul. Motivated by the success stories behind
Masters at Work, Blaze, Kerri Chandler and DJ Deep,
Halo is focused on continuous producing and the
building of powerful relationships for future
projects.   

Behind the decks, Halo remains among the most
respected in the industry and continues to assert that
Djing is his first passion. His productions, which
reside in the record boxes of the world’s top
tastemakers, are equally valued. He’s traveled around
the world spreading his deep, melodic vibes, and he’s
played alongside some of the best: Louie Vega, Mark
Farina, and Marques Wyatt, to name a few. His next-up
projects include collaborations with Marlon D., Alix
Alvarez, Mr. V and more studio work for his City Deep
Music label. Bottom line: Halo’s house is definitely
where the heart is. 

For more on Halo, visit www.bluemrecordings.com or
www.siestamusic.com
KARMA is held every Wednesday night and features
Downtempo, Deep Dub, SF House and Chicago House.

I agree. This party rocked. It was so nice seeing everyone again, it's been
a long time since i've been out in force. The music was awesome. It was so
fucking rad to see meat beat up close like that. They never cease to amaze
me, nor does Otherworld. You totally out did yourselves this year.
 The only drawback to that night was the fact that my car got broken into
Stereo and Ipod were stolen. It was just a matter of time i suppose, with
all the times i've parked out there for parties (attending and doing sound)
it was bound to happen sooner or later. Kinda ruined my night from that
point on and ended up leaving a little earlier than i would have liked just
because i couldn't seem to cheer back up after that.
 All in all though it was an amazing night, i wish every night could be as
magical as that.
 Major Props to Otherworld, Meat Beat, Bam, Marco, Praxis, Terry, Kevin and
everyone else involved in bringing it all together.

i'm wondering a couple things:

   - exactly WHICH 15 minutes were you there for?  really, if you  
were only there that long, you didn't give it a chance, now did you?

   - could your post be a set-up / red herring for future events that  
might conflict with DTS/HCFTP parties?  just a thought that crossed  
my mind.

   - what makes a good party for you?

i've been to a couple DTS/HCFTP parties that had a lack of  
functioning bathrooms (and TP), pushy "security", and draconian door  
policies, not to mention a lack of AIR and WATER *, and you know  
what?  i stayed for the duration of the event to suss it out.. and to  
help.  i tried to help out by un-clogging sinks, re-stocking TP, and  
opening windows and re-directing fans to improve the air flow in the  
space.  and i did all this without posting nasty emails about your  
events, though the urge to do so was tempting.

i would recommend that the next time you're at an event where  
something isn't going right, or could be better, step up and do  
something about it.  complaining doesn't count.   i wish i could  
offer a solution to the un-washed raver issue, but i'm coming up  
short there. :-)

the people involved in throwing this Halloween event put an insane  
amount of work into it, and that production level is rarely matched  
in the underground scene.  how many sound crews will fly the speaker  
cabinets just for increased sound quality?  free food and water?  
THREE shuttle vans (so that nobody had to wait outside in the cold  
for more than a minute or so) to take you to and from a safe place to  
park your car?  SIX FUCKING ROOMS of music for $15?  i mean, if you  
didn't notice these "details" about the party, you really should pay  
better attention next time.  and again, i'd really like to know what  
your idea of a good party is.

-philip-


* for those who might not know - AIR and WATER are basic survival  
needs for mammalian life forms. this includes ravers, no matter how  
stinky they may be.

It just wasn't my type of event. I would hardly call what I wrote to be
considered nasty. The only mean thing I said was in reference to the smell
in the place. It was obvious there was a serious lack of deodorant being
used in that place. The crew is not in control of that, I just choose not t=
o
be in a place that I feel the urge to vomit. I also don't like to leave my
car in shady neighbor hoods. My personal belongings are more important to m=
e
that a party.

Some events are not for everyone. I personally don't enjoy the type they
throw. They have a good following with people who enjoy their shows every
time they do one. Who cares what I think.

PS Please tell me what show you went to that HCFTP threw that did not have =
a
bath room? And DTS shows are normally $5 to - $10 so if you are complaining
about lack of air, bathrooms and other things I'm sorry. DTS has always
remained true to the idea of keeping the show as affordable as possible. DT=
S
is about the music not that lights and extra BS that would force us to
charge twice as much. We really do our best with what the venue gives us as
far as bath rooms. Come to think of it DTS has only done shows at the crack
house except for mad hatter. And as we all know that venue has two
bathrooms. DTS also threw a completely free day party that cost us almost
$400. So if you feel like we let you down I'm sorry. We try to do what we
can with the money we have. DTS has yet to turn a profit, and has come very
close to breaking even on every show.

My car was broken into as well, ipod, cds and sub stolen, and damaged my 
receiver. Same as Mr. Copper, the odds were against me, but it still 
sucks. Parking under a street light, in between a school and church 
doesn't mean anything in Oakland :)

The party was amazing though, good people, good feel and awesome music. 
MBM were unbelievable and one of the best acts I've seen up so close. 
The guys were  down-to-earth and just damn good at what they do. Having 
the Finger Monsters come up right after was just perfect and they laid 
down some sweet tunes.

Cheers to OW, Viberation, and all the audio teams for a perfect Halloween!

and what exactly is the type of event we throw? 

and can you please just help me out a little and give
me some reasons for why you were so unhappy.
i mean all you've mentioned so far is people were
smelly and you don't like parking your car in a shady
neighborhood.  is that it?
also when you throw your parties at the crackhouse,
where do you and everyone else park?  or do you
consider that safer than our neighborhood?
anyways we tried to offer a shuttle from downtown
oakland so people could park there car in a safer
place and not have to walk the streets of West
Oakland.  we even rented 3 shuttle vans and paid
drivers to make sure nobody had to wait around on the
streets.  what more can we do?    ~Mike

I'm not blaming you guys or saying I could do anything better. I'm just
saying it wasn't my type of show. It just seemed like everyone was on acid
walking around and talking to people that weren't really there. I didn't
really like the music, I didn't know many people there. So when you add all
the things together it makes my social anxiety disorder kick in over drive.
I'm not really up for partying it tight space with no outside area these
days. Sorry for all the drama

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Thanks to OW for a SLAMMING Halloween!!

Yup!!  Thanks for a great time!

As Marco said, the MBM set was amazing.  The mixing of visuals and audio
(as well as the audio FROM the visuals with the audio of the set) was
off the hook.  (Looping a drum line, or a KEYBOARD line, from some dude
playing in a demo video or concert footage and mixing that audio in.
Damn.  Try that one at home.)

The Fingermonster set was done amazingly.

Forest Green/Mochipet, Praxis: Yum!!

And of course, free water and food definitely help to nourish the raver
body.

As for Sideshow Bob's take on things, he might want to look in to
parties in L.A., as it sounds like that scene is likely more his thing.
Or if he wants a hookup with some promoters in Vegas, he can probably
pursue that and find his kind of vibe there too.  But OW, that was
SF-style.

I started the OW evening off probably freaking Tala out a bit with the
devil/jesus bit (hesitated a bit before getting into the shuttle) and I
ended the OW evening by freaking out a few of the street people I was
talking with for 2 or 3 hours at the 12th st bart station (finally
hopped on the bart around 10.)

P.S. on the MBM era tip:  Whatever happened to Consolidated?

It was great seeing you out and about with the little lady. Glad to hear you 
had so much fun. Another couple I know had their car broken into as well, 
and I ended up rolling out with them a bit earlier then I intended to help 
them out.

Still - aside from that crap, the night was bangin, and worth all the aches 
and pains my knees are suffering today.

Sometimes you get lucky and get told this by a kind soul when you enter
the city limits: "never leave anything of any value visible inside your
car."

(And by city limits, I don't just mean Oakland city limits.)

These ain't the burbs folks.

iPods???  C'mon.  There's a class war going on out there.

YEAH!  No shit.  Or MC 900 Foot Jesus?  Hey rocked too.  I believe Mark G
was in Consolidated too??  Or am I wrong.  At any rate...MBM, Consolidated
and MC 900 Foot Jesus all had multiple recs in my box at the same time circa
1990-1992.  Awww...i miss rockin that shit.  Quick mixing 120BPM breakbeat
dubs/instrumentals was grate!

See JC...now I'm all misty eyed!

I'm a long time lurker and sometimes poster.  I just had to throw in my .02 about this party......  
 
first off, let me start by saying this was my first otherworld party.  I've heard about their parties for a long time and wanted to check them out, but for one reason or another timing has never worked out right until saturday night.  needless to say I was excited about it and had high expectations.  
 
on the whole, otherworld delivered.  the place looked great.  loved the graveyard setup in the main room.  it was a bit confusing to navigate the hallways (in fact I think I missed one of the music areas entirely because I couldn't find it).  maybe next time some signs pointing the way to the different rooms would help.  or bigger signs if there were signs posted.  seems like I spent a lot of time jammed in narrow hallways trying to figure out where the rest of the party was.  but the crowd was great, for the most part.  could have done without the wannabe ganstas trying to grope me, but that's just oakland.  I live there -- I'm used to it.  I also wasn't aware that there wouldn't be any water sold there, so I had to leave right after I arrived to walk down to the corner store to get a bottle.  otherworld had cold water available for free, which is very cool, but they didn't have any containers with lids to put it in.  the next time I'll know to bring my own bottle.  
 
the biggest downside for me was the music itself.  it was way too down tempo in the main room for the 3-1/2 hours that I was there.  I wasn't familiar with meat beat manifesto so I wasn't sure what to expect.  I really enjoyed the audio/visual show - very impressive, but I felt like I was at a performance art show and not a rave.  I wanted to dance, and the music wasn't consistent enough for me.  it was very interesting and I enjoyed it, don't get me wrong.  but....  for someone who is geared up to dance hard the down-tempo stops and starts were frustrating.  my friends (my ride) grew really bored during meat beat's set so we ended up leaving towards the end of it.  that was a bummer for me - I missed forest green's set which is what I really came to see.  I did countless loops around the place (though the other three rooms that I was able to find) looking for my groove.  it was nowhere to be found.  
 
so I guess what I'm trying to say is that I can understand why some people would not have a good time at this party.  don't be too hard on them.  otherworld did a great job....  it all just boils down to a matter of personal taste.  this party fit with some people's, didn't fit with others.  it's as simple as that.  you can't really trash someone for not liking the same kind of music you do - we're all entitled to our preferences.  there were lots of great things about this party, and I had a good time overall.  the music just wasn't hittin' it for me.  I enjoyed and appreciated the technicality of it, but I couldn't do what I came to do -- dance my ass off.

cheers, 
susan

As Marco said, the MBM set was amazing. The mixing of visuals and audio
(as well as the audio FROM the visuals with the audio of the set) was
off the hook. (Looping a drum line, or a KEYBOARD line, from some dude
playing in a demo video or concert footage and mixing that audio in.
Damn. Try that one at home.)

The Fingermonster set was done amazingly.

Forest Green/Mochipet, Praxis: Yum!!

And of course, free water and food definitely help to nourish the raver
body.

As for Sideshow Bob's take on things, he might want to look in to
parties in L.A., as it sounds like that scene is likely more his thing.
Or if he wants a hookup with some promoters in Vegas, he can probably
pursue that and find his kind of vibe there too. But OW, that was
SF-style.

I started the OW evening off probably freaking Tala out a bit with the
devil/jesus bit (hesitated a bit before getting into the shuttle) and I
ended the OW evening by freaking out a few of the street people I was
talking with for 2 or 3 hours at the 12th st bart station (finally
hopped on the bart around 10.)

P.S. on the MBM era tip: Whatever happened to Consolidated?

I talked w/ Mark Pistel for a while, but we only briefly touched on the 
subject of him being in Consolidated. I'm not sure if they still put out 
tunes or what. I know he's been working with Azeem and some folks from 
Oaklyn Records on some stuff, which should be nothing short of incredible.

Yea, I guess if you were looking for an all out pounding set to bug on, Meat 
Beat wouldn't have been your thing. I for one kind of liked the 
rollercoaster ride they took us all on. Sometimes my little legs just can't 
hack dancing for 2 or 3 hourds solid, so the little breaks and ambient 
pieces were a welcome thing.

Glad to hear that despite the fact that you couldn't find your groove you 
still had a good time, and you appreciated the work that had been put into 
the event. That says a lot about you...willing to find the good in a 
situation you might not have been totally pleased with.

I guess I'm always so impressed with Otherworld events, cuz they really go 
all out, and bring a variety of sounds/vibes together that you just don't 
ordinarily see at a party. You get a chance to be exposed to more than just 
the basic house, trance, techno, breaks, D&B formula.

And whether or not you liked Meat Beat Manifesto - you witnessed a slice of 
electronic music history happening in someone's living space. Simply 
amazing.

Lollerskates.
 One of the best parties of the year, despite being savage drunk. The OW
venue is awesome, the price was $15 at the fucking door, and its been an ag=
e
since I was at an event where people seemed to be genuinely super-social an=
d
friendly without being off their tits on drugs.
 No cavity searches. No fights. No shitheels. Free water. Food. Mighty
drinks for three dolla. If you were expecting a 'rave' it wasn't quite that
in the modern incarnation of the term (replete with candy kids and
lightshows, although I saw a couple of those)... but it was a great party,
great crowd, bangin music.
 MBM was kinda... ehh, tho. Not to talk shit, but... I was expecting -- if
not totally danceable -- at least some genuinely trippy crazy music. The
breaks upstairs were sick all night, however! Winnie the Pooh threw it down
hardstyle.
 kthxbye.
 PS: Don@Otherworld? Bueller? Can u hit me up private-like, if you're on
this list?

I'm sorry I came across as condescending. I think it's just the way I'm
wired. :) I am not here to discourage anyone from making positive changes i=
n
their life.
 What I was trying to convey, here, is that NA doesn't really seem to be
doing my friend any good. I can't explain why -- he isn't doing drugs, at
the moment, but I'm sure that has everything to do with him being piss
tested every two weeks, and almost nothing to do with any spiritual
revelations he has had in NA. From my conversations with him, he is growing
up and learning a lot -- but, again, this has to do with him not gobbling a
dozen tabs of ecstasy a week, not any higher power or meetings.
 At present, he is still blaming his parents for his problems, rather than
accepting responsibility for his life and his actions and his choices. He
says things like "I''ve learned to cope" and upon being pressed tells me, "=
I
cope by not dealing with it." He says he's learning something, but it seems
like all he's learned to do is feel sorry for himself.
 I visited him, once, right after one of his meetings... it's one of the
only times I can see him, in between check-ins with his parole officer. A
brief interaction -- paired with some idle reminiscing wrt previous
friendships and relationships with people in/going through AA -- gave me th=

mind you, but these cats had not grown up in any of the important ways. The=
y
were older, held down jobs, et cetera ... NA turned them into productive
members of society. It did not let them answer the questions they needed to
answer to mature and evolve as human beings. A quick fix, a patch on a flat
tire.-
 How can I summate here? While never having experienced this stuff first
hand, it seems like 'it works'. It works insofar as it can keep you away
from your addictions and give you something new to obsess over. It cannot
take you to the 'next step' in which you move beyond the need to have
something external to yourself to feel good.
 I don't know what that step is. I'm sure by the time my alcoholism totally
consumes me i'll be ready to try just about anything. Hopefully I'll have
more insights by then.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] AA meetings?

Well, I can see how you'd have the impression of N/A & A/A that you do. I 
myself was forced to go when I got arrested for posession of paraphenalia 
back in VA a couple of years ago, and I thought that it was a complete waste 
of time.

Now - before I go offending anyone with my OPINION of these services, let me 
preface this by saying, I know that it DOES help people. And when you're 
dealing with addictions, sometimes a method like this is necessary to deal 
with the situation.

That being said, I tend to think that nine times out of ten it does nothing 
but give people a new addiction. I have seen so many people that have gone 
through these things either become "12 Step Junkies" or all of a sudden 
"find religion". I wish these programs would focus less on the "god will 
give you strength" approach, and more on the "find strength within yourself" 
approach. It's almost as if they say to you "All your problems will 
magically go away if you surrender to god's will and come to these 
meetings". And I dunno - when I quit smoking, I quit cold turkey. I gave 
away a full pack of smokes. I have known other folks with bad meth habits 
that just STOPPED. No meetings, no self help books, no bibles, no Jesus. I 
fully believe that change ocmes from within. You have to WANT to stop what 
you're doing. Until that happens - you can go to meetings till the cows come 
home, and you'll still be left with your addiction.

I also went to some of the "non religious" meetings after I got sick of 
having to pray and talk about god every time I went to a meeting, and while 
the religious aspect was lessened, it still wasn't fully absent. Go figure 
when 90% of these things are held at churchs, lol.

I honestly think that a better approach would be for people with addictions 
to get real counseling from a phychiatrist or an addiction specialist of 
some kind. Someone whose approach isn't 1st to try and convert you or make 
you feel like some helpless little puppet of "god".

But if people would rather OD on Jesus than on booze or illicit substances, 
I guess that's up to them...

I'm curious. Were you given the option of attending meetings in a
non-religious place, not a church? With no penalty?

Downtempo? Main room? For 3 1/2 hours? On Halloween?

Are you sure?

downtempo in that much of what MBM was playing was in the 80-110 BPM range.

not your typical 120-140 breakbeat, house, 4-4 range.

which I can see some EDM dancing lovers not being too keen on.  i
would have suggested that while MBM was playing that one of the other,
larger rooms be playing something in the 120-140 BPM range, perhaps
something with a 4-4 structure, that people (no matter what they are
on and no matter what music they are into) can dance to.

i personally had no complaints!  other than my Pooh bear costume being
too god damn hot to dance in.  :(

As long as I fulfilled the requirements of my probation, it didn't matter 
where I went. It just had to be a "recognized" service of that kind. They 
did give me a list of suggestions, and even noted which ones were straight 
up religious and which ones weren't.

There was a ton of hardcore in the Casa De Sangre room...not to mention in 
the theatre room off the main room, and one of the upstairs rooms as 
well....

yeah, I totally missed the whole upstairs section.  :o(  it was my first time at the otherworld warehouse and I didn't even know about the upstairs.  I only found 4 rooms - one near the door, the two that were next to each other (one of those had MBM), and the back area that had a PA system for a live band.  I made a few loops looking for other areas, but gave up after a while and just stayed in the room where MBM was.  

and yeah, I thought it was downtempo music in that room while I was there.  I'm not saying it was bad -- it was just a bit slower than what I was looking for.  as soon as I would kind of get in to a beat it would drop out or stop.  I found it a little frustrating, so eventually I stopped trying to dance and just enjoyed the show.  

overall I thought the party was really fun.  it was great to see so many people in the spirit and dressed up.  the people made it for me - they were great (excluding that moderately scary group of guys who tried to grab me every time I went into the hallway - poo on all of you.  reaching out and grabbing is not the way to pick up a girl.)  my problems with the music really don't reflect poorly on otherworld or anything, it just has to do with my preferences.  and I did enjoy what I heard even if I couldn't figure out how to dance to it.

not your typical 120-140 breakbeat, house, 4-4 range.

which I can see some EDM dancing lovers not being too keen on. i
would have suggested that while MBM was playing that one of the other,
larger rooms be playing something in the 120-140 BPM range, perhaps
something with a 4-4 structure, that people (no matter what they are
on and no matter what music they are into) can dance to.

i personally had no complaints! other than my Pooh bear costume being
too god damn hot to dance in. :(

...unless she's on lot's of drugs at a halloween party.  If you have no
standards other than breasts and grab 100 times you're bound to find one
that's f'd up enough.

Incidentally, those dumbasses that were grabbing you kept trying that with 
other females - I had to get in their faces a couple of times about it 
(which sucked considering they were huge, there were many of them, and I was 
most likely way too inebriated to handle a fight, heh).

Once again, I'm still glad to see your mind was open enough to get some 
value out of the party even if the beats weren't to your preference. Next 
time around -  meet up with myself or one of the other OW veterans and I'll 
introduce you to the OW crew, and take you on the tour (so you can see where 
all the other beats are). I'm sure you'll find quite a bit to get your 
groove on to.

Being under 160 bpm does not make music "chill", it just makes it not
insanely fast.

Yeah, these guys tried their damnedest to remove my deck but couldn't. 
So they took the remote control instead. The ipod was a friends, and it 
was in the glovebox, but the car was clean and nothing was visible. They 
even went through the sunglass holder, and tried pulling back some of 
the carpet to get to the deck from the back. Talk about time on your hands.

They also took about 8 pairs of my friends shoes that were in the trunk. 
Excitement. I was amused they looked at my amp, left it and took the sub.

But then again, if you're in that neighborhood, it is pretty obvious by 
the amount of people what is going on. The guy working at the liquor 
store asked me if the party was getting packed.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Thanks to OW for a SLAMMING Halloween!!

Yea, whoever was breaking into cars were veterans. They removed my friend's

Crazy mofos.

Thanks, Delia! I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that Andrew Phelan was
performing with us as well, dropping all sorts of crazy turntablism and
a capella action on top of our live stuff. Poor Ringo, always
forgotten...

Anyway, yeah. This was our first performance together, and I think it
went off pretty damned well considering. Thanks to everyone for the
props, and be on the lookout for more from us in the near future. :)

Toodles,

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Thousands of records for sale!

I have over 3000 new and used records of EVERY genre
of music. 
They are not catagorized, I haven't even seen them
all.
I inherited them from a friend who got them from a
store that was closing.
He dropped them off, I put them in boxes and they've
sat ever since.
I don't have the time or energy to begin fathoming how
to organize them.
Make an offer on the lot!

Cheers!
