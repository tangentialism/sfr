Well,   this Saturday,   I'll see you all in GG park for Organic,  where
I intend to dance my ass off all day...   Then,   I head out of the Bay
Area for New Mexico for the Rainbow Gathering,  and a meeting with my
client,  where I get to show and tell.

While there,  I intend to follow my usual mission thats well known
by all of my brothers and sisters.

While I am gone,  I want to be able to her that house music all the
way to New Mexico,  as all you SFRavers, AusRavers,  party on.

Cheers

Just what do-es it mean to say that Organic got their permit "so easily."
They've done lots of parties in the Park and they applied for a permit
the way everyone else does.

Some people think the world is more complicated than it really is.

Dear All;

	I went to Diversity last night, with Karen, Reagan & Pat, aka 
Black Adder. Had a great time, the music was killer, Ethan screams, wish 
it would have gone on longer.

	Also went to Bro's & Sis's lastnight at appoximetlly 3:15am, and
found out the guest list ended at 3am. This was to say the least very
disappointing, cause they were askin $10 to get in, so make sure you get
there early leave & come back after diverseity, dis way you support both
events. My then anyway all da suits are gone. I still very much appriate
what Allen does, to help our scene. thanks Allen!!!!! 

	My B-Day is July 4th, have nothing planed yet for the day 
specifically, but I'm sure something will turn up :).

	I will be at Freedom tonight & GC Park today. I will have 
mymassage table out there at Freedom, and possibiliy GC Park weather 
permitting, meaning its gotta be very warm for me to do massage outside, 
but I'm still lookin for that day. See ya, if you see me stop by, I like 
B-Day hugs.

Hello,

I know that this is only peripherally related to raves, but sometimes this is
a good community to get real information from.

First, NOTE:   please ONLY reply to ME  --- no replies to sfraves (check your
headers before sending!).

SO, I'd like to know how many days of USENET messages are kept by your
Internet supplier? (eg 7 days, 14 days, 21 days or  ? )

The local monopoly keeps cutting down the number of days as the number of
groups increases, in order to avoid buying more disk space. 

SO, I need to know what the average and range is, in order to shame him into
bumping it back up.  :-)

Please, only reply if you get your USENET newsgroups from a PUBLIC Internet
supplier (such as Netcom) as opposed to reading it at work.

In other word, if you work at apple, don't reply to me about how many they
happen to keep at apple.com .

Thanks!

Yesterday I was at the party in the park and someone from this network (I 
think that maybe he is one of the originals on this network) came up to 
me and said if I minded the fact that a lot of people on this network 
were against me.  For a start, nobody is against anybody it's all just a 
matter of opinion.  If I had to face persecution/prosecution everytime I 
wanted to go out dancing it would not detere me one bit and I would hope 
that would go for anybody else who calls him/herself a raver.  And 
secondly, if people can't take what I say or think that I am being to 
negative then that's your problem.  If you can't take what I am saying 
then you are a lightweight and raving is only for the hardcore.  I, 
personally, could 
not give a fuck what people think of me.  I guess the following little 
rhyme sums it all up for me:
Raving is only for the hardcore,
For people who know the score. 
If you want some more,
Get on the dance floor.

     I would also like to take this oppotunity to say thank you to Mark 
and Tracy for a truely beautiful party yesterday.  Tracy, some times the 
music you play is so beautiful and so well written and so well mixed by 
you that at times it makes me cry and at others it makes me laugh out 
loud with joy.  Takke it from me Tracy, I have heard a lot of DJ's from 
all over the world in the last seven years and you are deffinatly one of 
the best DJ's I have ever heard.  When are you going to bring some tapes 
out?  It also had one of the nicest vibes I have experienced at a party 
for quite some time; it made me feel quite homesick.
     Thanks to all concerned for a lovly afternoon.  Look forward to 
seeing you all at Sunset today.  I'll be in my usual place by the speaker.
TRISTAN.

Rainbow Gathering trip report
=============================

Am now in Holbrook,  Az at a coffee shop,   where I was able to "plug in" and
extract my mail and upload this.

We left Sat evening at 10 pm,   arrived in Sedona,  Arizona,  our first stop
on the way to the Rainbow gathering.    I took the first drive shift,  and
brought
us to Arizona at about 10 am the next day,   after driving ll through the night.

>From here,  we are only 4 1/2 hours away from Tres Piedres.   Our plan is to get
up to the rest stop and get a little sleep before the final push to arrive
very early Monday Morning.

More later....

Chris, you clarified this issue for me.  Although the idea of MTV being 
at a rave was initially distasteful to me, the more I think about it, the 
more I realize that you are absolutely right.

Dear Chris,

	Thank you for clarifying this issue for me with your message.  
I'll admit, I initially found the idea of MTV filming at a rave 
distasteful.  But after reading your message, I realize you're right.  We 
have to present a positive image to non-ravers, whatever package they may 
come in, because positivity, love, and good vibes is what we are all 
about!  Moreover, the simple fact of the matter is, that anything on the 
"cutting edge" of culture that attracts significant numbers of young 
people, such as raves, is going to attract media organs like MTV (i.e., 
if you build it, they will come.)  I think the best way to react to this 
is by doing something unexpected, daring, and fun, yet not hostile in any 
way.  The "MTV Sucks" t-shirt idea strikes me as a good one.  Why not 
throw in a bit of good-natured self-deprecation, and at the same time, 
display something they will not dare to air?  Make shirts that say "MTV 
Sucks -- We Swallow!  :) "
	Or better yet, wear nothing at all at the party...

		Provocatively Yours,

					*** Starchild ***

This party probably had the best music and on the best sound system I've 
ever heard at a party!  OOoohh wweeee did I have a great time!
We arrived sometime after 1am.  After wandering around in the dark trying 
to find some friends tent and camp set up, we finally located Lee and 
Janie with their famous bean bag chair.  It wasn't long after that other 
friends and their tents came by.  This was really helpful to have this 
base camp to go back to.  Even with a big group of people I still had 
trouble finding this basecamp every time I went back to it as there 
wasn't much light, except the incredible lazer show in the distance and a 
flashing stobe light by the dance floor.
Going to the dancefloor was an adventure as I wandered in the dark, and 
every once in a while would bump into other people I knew and other 
wandering ravers doing their own exploring.
After getting my feel of the surroundings, the incredible music just 
carryed me away.  The music felt soooo good, I don't think I ever danced 
so much at any party.  It wasn't easy for me to keep my body from jumping 
and bouncing to get a short rest.  I felt so immersed in the music and 
the energy around, my body just followed along and it felt so good to dance, 
release, and recycle the energy.
Although the water had run out by the time we arrived, and there wasn't 
any food being offered that we found, like the flyer said, it didn't matter.
Fortunately we had some of our own, and the great music way more than 
made up for any of that.
I got to say I really took full advantage in expressing my freedom by 
dancing all over the place, and I don't know if I ever felt more free 
than than this party.
Thanks Martin, all the great djs and everyone else for being part of the 
energy of this great party!


:)

i can't believe it!  when i finally woke up this morning (i had to come
to work :( )  i was still smiling!  ahhhh, afterglow!
we went to organic saturday afternoon for a little dancing in the
dustbowl - fantastic!  i met so many people (so many sfravers!) my 
head was spinning.  all the music was really great, especially the 
old breakdance...i love that stuff.  big special thanks to tracy
for starting my day off right.  she was spinnin' when we got there
and it just threw me right onto the dancefloor and right into the mood.
after a little refueling at some excelent chinese restaurant we headed
for the hills, and more dustbowl dancing.
now, did i say i met people at organic?  well my head had just stopped
spinning when we got there, and then, jesus, here it goes again!  more
great people, more awesome music, and one phat laser show!  in spite
of it all, though, the best lights were those (heavenly) shooting
stars.  the stars and house music outside were perfect.  everything had
its own rythm - the music, the heavens, and the ravers - and it all
converged there in those hills just to get down!  
then, on top of all the other great things that night was the
jungle/dub/ambient/loseyourmindandrollaroundonthecarpet tent.  that was
the best!  so many friendly people and really really good music.  every
time i came back (i couldn't stay away too long) the music was different.
big hugs and thanks to everbody there.  it was great to meet all of you...
brian, blackadder, krystal, ... all of you!  and karen, what are doing
leaving town as soon as i meet you?  you are all the BEST!!!  
big special thanks to mike clay and diane tabellija for the rides!
what a wonderful weekend!  anybody up for nation tonight?

I just wanted to thank all the SFRavers I met for the _wonderful_ weekend
I had - probably one of the best ever.  Between Diverse City, Organic in
the Park and Freedom, I had a great time.  Thanks to everyone who made it
so memorable: Brian, Black Adder, Seth, Amy ( tried to find ya at Freedom,
but no luck), and Karen. Give that girl a side of fries! :)
	I'm going to be down in LA for the next couple of weekends, but I
hope I see all of you again when I get back.  The music and dancing were
great, but the wonderful people I met were what made it so worthwhile. 
Oh, and thanks to everyone who convinced me to go to Freedom on Saturday. 
I may be broke, but it was worth the money.

							Love,
								Jake

P.S. Anyone know if Ann or Jeff have email addresses?

Fellow Trance Addicts,

Just a reminder that Frequency 8 will be playing awesome, butt kicking
trance in Stinson Beach on July 4th in the Village Green park from 1pm to
6pm.  DJs Cyr, MysterE and Mars.  Free. Frequency 8 line 415-541-5019

BTW, I am not in any way affiliated with Frequency 8, I'm just a very happy
customer.  Mars also sells great trance vinyl and CD that you can't find
anywhere else.  Mars knows his trance.

Is it wrong for me to post a show I know about to the list?  Is that
considered a BSP?  What if I'm dj'ing, or if it's my show.  I've posted
show's I've dj'd at to the list, because I want people to know about them.
I don't say come to the show because I'm dj'ing, but I will probably make
mention that I'm playing.  Is that wrong of me to do?  I just keep reading
stuff about BSP's and wonder if I'm one of them.  Am I supposed to just mail
directly to the sfraves calendar keeper and not post to the list?

Ponderings!

Rick

Hi All,

The recent use of the phrase "fuck you" brought to mind this passage.  
Though the recent usage is a week stale, I still thought you might 
enjoy it.  It's from Carl Sagan's book, "Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors."

   We go to great lengths to deny our animal heritage, and not just in
   scientific and philosophical discourse.  You can glimpse the denial in
   the shaving of men's faces; in clothing and other adornments; in the
   great lengths gone to in the preparation of meat to disguise the fact
   that an animal is being killed, flayed, and eaten.  The common primate
   practice of pseudosexual mounting of males by males to express dominance
   is not widespread in humans, and some have taken comfort from this fact.
   But the most potent form of verbal abuse in English and many other
   languages is "Fuck you," with the pronoun "I" implicit at the beginning.
   The speaker is vividly asserting his claim to higher status, and his
   contempt for those he considers subordinate.  Characteristically, humans
   have converted a postural image into a linguistic one with barely a
   change in nuance.  The phrase is uttered millions of times each day, all
   over the planet, with hardly anyone stopping to think what it means.
   Often, it escapes our lips unbidden.  It is satisfying to say.  It
   serves its purpose.  It is a badge of the primate order, revealing
   something of our nature despite all our denials and pretensions.

Ook-ook eep,

Purple Tiger

...Another one of those dazed and confused weekends where time not spent 
enjoying the party was used in pursuit of the next one. Along the way 
recognizing more and more people of that same circuit. A famaliar face asks 
for my name and for some reason I answer "It's really not that important." 
Not trying to be stuck-up, but at that particular moment in time just 
happened to feel that it was true. 

...A few people commented that the music Saturday night wasn't as 
specalized as they were accustomed to. I think that for such a large 
outdoor crowd-control situation that doesn't have any enclosed walls to 
compress the molecules you need a different sound: a steady pulse that 
woun't dissapate or lose itself. It also gave me the oppurtunity to wander 
circles around a field, walk up a hill and then come down a mountain, and 
explore quite a few other neat places: which is a dance you really can't 
do in most clubs or wharehouses.  

...The bus transportation from the city made it possible for myself and a 
handful of other kids to reach Freedom, a unique event that normally 
would have been beyond our individual means of production. It's nice to 
see when someone takes the time to put their words into action and create 
something more tangable than some cliche slogan on a flyer, esspically 
when it would seem to be a wiser financial move to do without it all 
together.

Thanks.

Only bother posting if you belong to the SF Rave Elite.  New rules are
decided upon by order, err dictated upon for order, hmmm, ordered upon by
the max dictatorship. And be aware that you are always out of order in this
new rule by the week, ah, rule by the weak -chum chum list with short term
memory loss.

the only thing going for this list is its calender, otherwise its really
just a bizarre cyberfrat list,  a forum without any pretense at freedom, a
cyberwhatsit having little to do with the act of Raving, and whole lot to
do with the elitist imaginings of those who see it fit to rule by flamage -
untruths, halftruths, rumour, hearsay, hysteria, paranoia and real fear.

Goddess only knows why people who call themselves ravers and offer up
goodwill at the drop of a hat on the dancefloor, see it fit to burn witches
in cyberspace.

I wore myself out this weekend doing the rave marathon, and boy did it 
feel GOOD! I'm very pleasantly exhausted. :)
Organic Saturday afternoon, Freedom Saturday night, and Sunset on Sunday.

Freedom was incredible.  I had been to smallish parties for the last 6 
months, so the sheer number of people was almost overwhelming. It took 
awhile find a spot where it didn't feel like a busy sidewalk with people 
coming and leaving constantly. Once I found that spot though, I was 
locked into the groove all night long.  I never tranced so hard in all my 
life! That music and my "altered state of mind" took me on a very 
intense journey.  Remember that song that sounded like a race car?!?!
HOLEY SHEEEIT!! That was sooooooo cool! I couldn't sit down all night 
long, and I was like a zombie on my feet by the time Spun finished his 
set.  But towards the middle of Garth's set I found a second wind with 
the help of my friend Greg's bubbly energy.  I loved the way we all 
formed a circle and held hands in the early morning sun.  Aaahhh I love 
raving! :)  Take care everybody!

love,
Amy

Recently , Rick Riffle asked us all nicely about doing a Blatant Self 
Promotion (BSP) to the SFRaves mailist:
> Subject: BSP's
> 
> Is it wrong for me to post a show I know about to the list?  Is that
> considered a BSP?  

 Only is the "self" part is involved. 

> What if I'm dj'ing, or if it's my show.  

 Yup - those are instances of BSPs.

> I've posted
> show's I've dj'd at to the list, because I want people to know about them.
> I don't say come to the show because I'm dj'ing, but I will probably make

 I don't feel it's wrong , as long as you establish the "self" part - what
seems to annoy a lot of folks on SFRaves is the posting of "advertisements"
that lack a personal touch - more of a feeling of a sales pitch rather than
a friend telling other friends about their party that's coming up.

 At the risk of missing some important points and coming up with advice
that nobody agrees with , here's my best-guess guidelines for BSPs on
SFRaves -

1. Keep it humble. Your may consider your event a hyper-meta-physical
   ultra-fabulous greatest-thing-since-Megatripolis gift-to-ravers ,
   but try to keep that attitude to a minimum in your post. We've heard
   enough corporate egomania in 30 second commercials to tolerate much
   of the same in our email. 

2. Keep it personal. If you've been distributing flyers , don't bother
   to repeat every single line of promo and hype. Even if you don't 
   have flyers , don't let it read like a flyer! As I suggested above,
   the tone of a friend talking to other friends goes down better.

3. Keep it terse . If you're using more than 48 lines of text to tell
   us about your event , maybe you should do some editing...
   [ One exception - Don't stint on the directions! ]
 
> I just keep reading
> stuff about BSP's and wonder if I'm one of them. 

 You can't BE one , unless you walk around with your rave flyers stapled
to your forehead!

> Am I supposed to just mail directly to the sfraves calendar keeper 
> and not post to the list?
 
 Go ahead and post those messages to SFRaves.  Just keep 'em humble , 
personal , and terse , and you won't catch any flack from me!

I don't know what's been going on in your private email, but I'm sure you've
only experienced the opinions of a small number of the list members.  There
are literally hundreds of people reading this list, and some of them may
agree with your earlier posts.  One thing is for sure, you're not going to
find any aggreement with your above assertions on this list.  Why?  Well, if
they agreed with you they certainly wouldn't be on this list, right?  So try
not to alienate everyone with general statements.

The list's character changes all the time depending on which posters are
hammering email that week.  Relax, ride out the storm, and don't take things
personally.

I, personally, don't think there's been an abusive amount of BSP's.
At least we aren't being inundated with MMF's and Sex Line posts.

Well, ok.  I didn't go to Organic or Freedom like I should have.  So I had
no idea what was going on at Sunset for the first several hours.  I mean
I'm looking around and everyone's just chilling doing the blanket thing
while the bowl shaped dance floor lies relatively un-scathed and there is
some really good jam being spread.  Tony R. clued me in that everyone was
tired from the prior events - makes sense.  I was very happy when critical
mass was finally reached and the bowl was filled to the brim.  What up 
with the trash tho?  It's really fun picking up trash while someone else 
walks on it.  Ouch.

Dear All;

	I feel somehow they will say that the Internet is excluded from
Freedom of Speech, reasons to follow. But I do feel that you are right
Neil, that if the Internet had exsisted back in the 18th Century they
would have included as part of Freedom of Speech, most definately, & 
more on the positive Internet potential later.

	I feel they will attempt to exclude it from under contituional
control because they need more ways to control us, and the Internet if it
falls into the hands of the government has the power & the future
potential to do that. 

	Old Relgion is slowly fadeing away, the believe in Christ based
God in our soceity diminsies everyday. I personally feel man created this
entity for the purpose, initially of explaining things that couldn't be
explained, and also found that it was effective tool for controling the 
masses and bringing about order from chaos.

	Please do not confuse spiritually with relgion, they are two very
different things. For I like to think am a very spiritual person, or at
least to say I try an approach this state of being. But relgion by
defination is a system of worship, devised by people. 

	The Bible & its simlar counterparts, were documents that was
interpreted & passed down from person to person, generation to generation,
literally at times, by word of mouth. Due to this form of record keeping I
feel that the Bible & its counter parts have a very high proability, or at
least a lot of opportunity, of being altered or corrupted along the way.
Especially knowing and taking into account human nature, greed, lust
...etc. Also taking into account the levels of corruption in the various
houses of God though out history, war, fire ...etc. 

	So what would happen to the state of world stability if all of a
sudden, relgion, or believe in a God, was found out to be incorrect or
void. That would mean, that you would spend your time on earth here, and
then die, and that would be it. I feel that some people would just rape,
pillage & kill, to serve their own needs, without any fear of reprocusions
of an after life eg heaven & hell. This would be especially prevalent in
3rd world societies, where ignorance & fear already rule. I think most of 
us got the idea that hurting people wasn't ok, from some form of relgion 
either in our lifes or our parents lives.

	So what could prove that God doesn't exsist, lets say that whole
Aliens think turned out to be true, that there were other lifeforms out
there. We were, as the Bible tells us, created in the image of
God(whatever that means). Christ, the Son of God, was a man, and was
created in our image according to the Bible. So then all of a sudden you
get these little dudes with antenni(just Kidding), and four arms, on world
wide TV. How will relgion explain this, the Bible makes no reference to
other planets, or even other lifeforms other than human(I'm not a student
of the Bible, however). Relgion will attempt to explain it with yet
another interpretation, vision(Da Pope on Acid), dream, or say these
creatures/beings are the spawn of the Devil(nothing like a little
planetary racisum). Which I feel will only serve to further the
non-exsistance of God, by weaking faith further(more spreading of hate). I
also feel that present day reglion conflicts with itself a lot, but I
could go on forever with that one; and for example the Pope's recent 
racist comment about Buddisum.

	I feel we are not alone in our universe, and that our government 
as well as other governments know this, and see that the old systems of 
control are starting to weaken. Everyday we see more & more world chaos 
on our TV's. Nothing is, sacred or the same anymore, and everything is 
changing so fast. As they say, constant change is here to stay.

	Here comes the internet, digital technology, total control of
potentially all digitized knowledge, history, & potentialy even reality. 
This type of technology can easially & eventually be in every home, hut, &
cave in our world. Its just a matter of resources, meaning things that can
be created by society. In otherwords, no new technology has to be created
or devised, the systems need to be enlarged however to acomadate the
expanded user base. Most houses built in and after the 70's are already
wired for a telephone, videophone, & cable. The telephone company
installed the digital switching networks necessary to make the present and
not to distant future Internet function, 5 - 7 years a head of schedule. 
The telephone company, which is to a larger degree a major part of the
internet, is always in a state of upgrading/retrofiting old equipment with
new equipment. Harddrive prices are at an all time low, something like
,39/mb, down from .90/mb, just last year. Memory chips still remain
pricey, but I image in time they will fall as well, as does the price of
most computer stuff. Look for memory to be traded on the comodites market,
within 10 years, that's my prediction. The average price of a relatively 
powerful computer is afordable by most indivuals and families. 

	So why hasn't it already happened? There is a user education lag,
with a relativeity cyptic interface to deal with, meaning ATT Unix System
5 Version 4 & its clones. Although, more point & click netbrowsers 
are making it easier for even the most novice of users to surf the 
net, eg Netscape, Mosaic. More of peoplekinds written knowledge needs to
be digitized, and stored for available access on the net, this means that
everything from books to newspapers, need to be routinely digitized, along
with all da backlog/archives of the worlds knowledge. The commerial
people, people that provide services, and products on the Internet need to
start offering more for less money, and with more payment alternatives
than a credit card to purchase whatever, eg bankcard ...etc. The banks,
and other services need to, even though they are already on the Internet,
expand their systems & services to handle commerical traffic's size &
needs. But for the most part the systems of the net just need to be
enlarged to handle more users, providers, & vendors. In digital
technology, each time you upgrade or enlarge your system's cabilites, you
at least double your exsisting capacity, geometrically expanding each step
up. 

	The Internet's sorta like an addictive drug that you give people,
you get them hooked in, two or three generations pass, and this is the way
people are used to doing things, like getting mail, paying bills, cashless
society & other basic life stuff. They forget how things were done before,
they become dependent on the this system, and way of doing things. For
example, being an engineer I have a lot of mathematical skill. Yet I
heavially rely on a calculator to do my routine calcualtions. I remember I
was out in the field one day and my batteries died. I had to do the
calcualtions myself, and what was cake in grade school became a royal pain
in the butt for even the most basic of calculations. So what happens if a
system of checks & balances aren't in place on the Internet, and our
government or a corporation decides to pull the pug on whomever they don't
like or agree with. You are then locked out, your penniless(cashless
society), you can't get basic services, at the push of a button your an
excile in your own home & country. It sounds like something from Big
Brother, but in a digitized world, where information can be changed, all
things are possible, from a minor mistake, to history being changed. 
There needs to be strict data integity monitors, either a commitee of
human beings, or something hardcoded in the data to protect the information
that is history. Because as more & more of the world's knowledge is
digitized, the less we will be relient on the written/printed word. 

	As much as our governments look to the internet as a way to 
control societies & people, it looks on it with tremenous fear as well. The 
internet has the potential of making societies where DIRECT democary 
works. DIRECT democary is were the people wright, and vote on all 
legsiation that has to due with that particular country. No more congress 
people or representatives, I would however image the need for some staff to 
take care of some of the lesser task's of government. You as a citzen 
would be responsible for taking part in our government, from your 
desktop, voting & introducing significant legislation. 

	It has the potential to end fear poltics, by getting the peoples
of the world talking with each other. The internet levels the power
playing field, it gives indivuals the power to reach millions, meaning
everyone is the same. The more the whole of society embraces this
technology, the more power we will have as indivuals, and the less BS our 
governments will be able feed us. With the Internet you have a common 
world language, a machine language, but its common. There is no doubt in my
mind that the Internet can play a significant role in helping bring about 
world peace. With the use of videophones, an electronic language 
translators, the leaders of our world can meet more often, and more 
informally.

	It has the potential to improve our environment, for example if
all regular mail went to E-Mail. We would use sooo much less paper, have
to cut down fewer trees. With video phone links, the necessity to travel
would be reduced, reducing our overall usage & dependence on poluting
fossil & nuclear fission fuels, by several orders of magnitude. People
could stay home with their families and work over the phone lines,
improving the quality of the family unit in our country & the world ..etc. 

	As far as a knowledge base, and an education tool. The internet
can bring the sum of the world's digitized knowledge to the remotest of
the world's corners, and with a videophone link, a teacher as well. Which
means it has the potential to end world ignorance and also education the
world. Also once digitized, the content & appearence of acient reference
books, and manuscripts can be made available to anyone, not just
researchers, anytime their needed. Everybook, in every libray around the 
world at your finger tips.

	I personally will take any attempt by our government to limit, censor,
or control the internet, as a direct attack on the Constituion of the U.S, 
by our government. But I do feel more ammendments are needed to the 
constition to ensure our freedom & the freedom of the net, into & though the 
22nd century.

	The Consitution & the Delaration of Indenpence are beautiful
documents. I was born on the day they signed the Delaration of Indenpence,
only 186 years later. They called themselves an assembly of demigods, the
authors of those two documents. They are old documents, where we are a
modern society compared to 200 years ago. They must be carefully brought
into modern times, without any compromise to our personal freedom. I feel
the reason some of the other countries have been able to do so well, so
fast, is because they have a relativity new consitution & charter, take
Japan for example, their consitution has only been around since the end of
WW2. 

	Well, I take this stuff pretty seriously as you can tell, less the
Aliens & Relgion stuff. The Aliens & Relgion stuff is just a theroy, 
its got a lot of holes, but no more than any of the modern relgions do at 
present. I understand why, if these beings did exsist why our 
government would want to keep the knowledge of their exsist a very important 
secret. On the positive side I feel such knowledge could destablize our
world further. On the negative side, well lets not even thing about that.

	Being born on a day where so much psychic energy was & is
happening, its hard to explain my relationship with it, and the way it
makes me feel. I believe in the self, I believe thats where our savalation
is, by acknowledging the self, and how truely wonderful & unique you are,
you can't help but see it in others, and know that all creatures big &
small, intelligent & dumb, have a right to be, and exsist, in their
natural state, and on their path. So anything that assits us in developing
our uniqueness and indivuallity, gives us more headroom, gives us more
freedom, allows us to find & fufill our indivual destinies, transfers more
power from the governments & corporations to the indivuals/self, I am of
course for. 

	The Internet as it grows and becomes more a part of our everyday
lifes, means that we must elect computer literate politicians(Not Petey),
who believe in a free internet, and understand the potential that the
internet can bring to a free society, our world's environment, and our
world's stability & and also its pitfalls and traps that could potentially
enslave a free soceity. The way I look at it, the next 10 years is going
to be like 1776, only we won't be fighting the british for our freedom, we
will be fighting our government, corporations, and people who want to
limit our personal, and our children's freedom and Liberty on net. Nows
the time to make your voices, concerns, and idea's heard, not after the
legisaltion is written, by people like Exon, who are computer 
illiteriate. Also, being the world's Internet leader, what we achieve or 
fail to acomplish with regard to the amount of personal freedom allowed 
on the net, will set the standard for the world. The world, with 
reference to the net will take our lead, so net awareness, participation 
in electronic protest against efforts to limit net freedom, and active 
participation in elections for candiates who are computer literiate, 
and are for pro-Internet freedom, are necessary to ensure that the internet 
remains as unrestricted as it is today.

	I remember the movie Sneakers, when Robert Redferd was talking
with his x partner, and the x-partner said, that today's power is not
about who has the most bombs & missles, it's who controls the information,
and I really believe that. I don't want to have to get a permit to send
someone a post just because it's out of the country. I don't want my
private messages read by a government censor, checking for content. I
personally want to be able to get access to & be in charge of all my
personal information, say what I feel & think, and go where ever I have
legal access to go to on the net; how bout you? The future is my
responsibility.

Dear All;

	Please do keep in mind that the idea's, comments and feeling 
expressed in the previous message, with the same subject header are not 
the word of god, they are just my opinion. I feel one of the things I'm 
suppose to do here on this planet & in this life is help bring awareness 
into people's live's.

	I base a lot of my predictions on a direct projection of 
exsisting technology. The tone of the post should be read litely, my

Rick,

  I don't mind BSP's in the least as long as they are 1) fairly short and to
the point  2) not trying to BSP your own long winded philosophy of how the
whole of rave culture should go ( now who would do that ? )  3) have to do
with rave related activity and 4) you're not trying to sell Rickco "spinning
knife" sets or how to pick up ravers at a party books.... in other words 
don't try to sell me cheeze products best left for the late LATE show ads...


  If these really "elitist" conditions are met, I'd be the first to defend
your right to post to the list and I will very much on the whole even welcome
your posts....

My $.02

Mike

Earth to David,

 IF you don't like our playground why stick around ? Go find your own
sandbox to be king of and quit trolling for flames in ours...

Mike

PS At least you seem to enjoy some of our celebrations... not bad for a

Freedom was pretty intense.  We got there before 1 and bypassed the stuffy
ambient and boring vendor tents for the main party grounds where a hard
trancey John Williams assault was taking place.  The sound was incredible,
perhaps the best I've ever heard, and the visuals were nice, too.

As expected for a big party this early, the energy was chaotic.  People 
were wandering about, greeting each other, hanging out, dancing solo or in 
clumps.  There was plenty of room, but aimless partiers collided in the dark
as they tried to figure out where they should be.  The music wasn't doing
much for me but I decided to check out the dance situation anyway.  It
was a pretty dismal scene.  With a thousand or so people, it seemed  strange
that there was so much wide open space in the area in from of the DJ booth
where you'd expect the vibe to be thickest. 

There was a wide range of people and styles at this party; from suburban kids
in their mall-bought outfits to genuine freakozoids.  Many seemed to be there
because it was a holiday weekend.  There were a lot of what i'd describe as 
"hicks"; the kind that are always getting abducted from their farms by UFOs
and then dropped off somewhere else years later not remembering anything.  I 
really don't have the adjectives to describe some of the many oddities; it
was as though every neighborhood in Northern California sent a couple of 
their weirdest citizens as representatives.  Plenty of ravers showed up too,
or at least people who looked like ravers.  We even recognized a few. d:)

So basically, I felt that the vibe kinda sucked for a "rave".  Although 
most were having fun with their friends and many were dancing, there was 
a lack of unity and group focus.  Usually it's the music that brings us
together, but on this night people were there to party, or just be out 
somewhere.  As far as drugs goes, there seemed to be 2 kinds of people;
those who were doing them and those who looked like they wanted to be
drinking alchohol.

The sound was amazing and when Tony came on, nothing else mattered.  Fuck
the group vibe, there was some serious music going on.  I though he spun one
of his best sets ever: acid-drenched beats that hit you like giant rubber 
balls...or something like that.  I was in sonic heaven.  Spun's set was
even more amazing; trippy psychedelic stuff with indescribably wild
polyrythms.

When the light came out it looked like a freak show; something inbetween a 
circus and an insane asylum.  It was *very* entertaining.  

Then, near the end of Spun's set, something seemed to change.  I was
saying to Janie (for the nth time) This music is incredible!" and I noticed 
that a tight group of dancers had formed at the center to complement 
the speaker tweakers who had been going off relentlessly up on the platforms
for most of the night.  Mark Ameba was being a total lunatic up on the
roof of the DJ booth and people were starting to scream.  The makeup of the
crowd seemed to have shifted as though a new crop had just shown up from
another party. When Garth took the helm, 9 hours into the event, it suddenly
felt like a true rave to me.  Had Garth brought his own posse just
for his set?  I did a reality check, sharing many of my views with others
(not that anyone still left at this party had much of a grip on reality
anymore).  Some agreed, some felt the vibe had been fine from the beginning.

Garth played a set similar to the one at the bandshell.  He was all over the
place; some slow deep funk that was absolutely wicked, disco, house, even
herbie hancock... it all sounded great and continued to blow my mind.

When it was over we tried to score some breakfast.   I managed to wave to
Joe who was still spinning to half-dead bodies in the ambient tent and I
hugged Ethan whose face was frozen with a shiteating grin.  At this point, 
though, I had been reduced to a semi-coherant idiot, and so it was time 
to hit the road.

Well, here I am home again the the Great White North.  Apart from the fact
that I now get to live in the main floor of a big house, I WANT TO BE IN
SF!!!!

I was completely blown away by the thoughtfulness and friendliness of
everyone I met.  I experienced such an outpouring of love and generosity
that I have NO idea how I'll be able to repay you all ...... except that if
any of you are going to be heading up to Vancouver, you have a place to
stay!!!!! :)

I'm so glad that I got to experience a Sunset and an Organic ...... and
everything else I got to experience ....

Big skwooshy hugs go out to Amy S., Tony T., Jake, Matt, DJ Ethan, Michael
C., Jan, Sarvi, Peter F., Seth, Brian M., and all the other SF ravers I met
whose names escape me because I'm DAMN tired.

David Minuk, I'm sorry we weren't able to hook up ... I tried to call you
on Wednesday night but you were on the modem for hours .... :( oh well,
next time.

Starchild, I apologize for not calling back on Friday evening but things
got a little screwy ... and then I got sidetracked by some little pits of
paper ... I enjoyed meeting you very much and everyone here LOVES the
flyers you gave me.

Very special thanks and cuddles go out to Brian Darkness for Thursday
afternoon, Saturday's little favour, and just for being himself.  Let me
know when you're gonna use that free ticket!

And last but most CERTAINLY not least .... to Black Adder & his lady Reagan
for being such amazing hosts.  You're marvelous and I hope to see you up
here soon so I can give back a little of what you gave to me.

I left my heart in San Francisco .....

The more events I go to the more I come to realize just how special F&F and
Harmony and Sunset and Cloud Factory and New Moon ( and some other small
idenpendant collectives really are ).... I had a great time at Organic in the
park and then Freedom ( but F&F's still top it because for me the best energy
at Freedom was that of my independant friends anyway )...

Last night, silly boy, I decided to go to Nation thinking with big name DJ's
( at high cost ) the vibe would be worth it... talk about a waste of my money
and time... boring... been there done it... Disco lives - the vibe was 
EXACTLY like Denver Disco clubs I went to in the mid 70's... Not bad per se
but just very flat and boring in the light of an F&F... I'm spoiled!!! People
were shouting on the dance floor true but that does not a good party make...

As an experiment I went around the club twice trying my best to make eye 
contact with ONLY ONE partial success - one woman caught my gaze for an 
instant - oopps too much commitment - break off quick - whew here's my man 
just in time... I almost laughed as she went back to her coupled state...
But I did find out that dancing in couples is still alive and well...
 
I hope that nobody who goes to these club affairs really thinks it has 
much to do with raving... it has the music, it has the lasers, it has the
visuals but it really, REALLY, REALLY lacks the "VIBEEEEE" -- where is
Milton when we need him ?

 So we must get on with the show and get these independent celebrations
happening - they really are where it's at and they really are something
very beyond the ordinary....

Just thinking,

Mike

It being a holiday week , I didn't plan to have a South Bay Lunch.
Maybe next week.

 However - someone suggested a South Bay dinner! Sound good to you
South Bay folks ? How's about that Chinese restaurant in Mountain View 
that had the vegetarian food? ( I forgot the name - I'll look it up
soon ).

	On a similar note, I have observed that many promoters neglect to 
mention the amount they're going to charge, either on their fliers or on 
their voice-mail messages.
	This is a blatant discourtesy to those who will be attending the 
party, and when I see it, it tells me that the persons throwing the party 
are more concerned with making money than with building community.
	There's only one good reason I can see for not letting people 
know the cost -- you're afraid that if they knew, they wouldn't come.	
	Some promoters take a halfway approach.  They'll announce that 
cover will be "only $5 before 11pm," failing to mention that the price 
will double thereafter and knowing full well that the party won't really 
get going until midnight anyway.  
	Kind of reminds me of those auto dealer ads you hear on the 
radio: "No money down! No monthly payments till June of 97!"  Of course 
they don't mention that starting next June, you'll be paying $1000 a 
month each month for the next 20 years, and if you miss a payment there's 
a $100 finance charge, plus compound interest.
	I don't mind paying $15 or $20 for a really good, big party, but 
it better be worth it.  And if you think it is, have the guts to tell 
people up front how much they'll have to pay.

	Galactic hugs & cosmic kisses,

	        		*** Starchild ***

Hello SFRavers -

 Does anyone know of any upcoming Santa Cruz events , in the timeframe 
of the next few months?  Something like another Santa Cruz Civic event
or a Cloud Factory.

 I've been thinking of organizing a dinner in the South Bay
as a kind of pre-event get-together. Folks from North Bay , Mid Peninsula,
South Bay, and points east could meet and eat before drivng over HW880/17 
to the event. 

 Please keep me informed!

whoa!  the water had run out?  staying well-hydrated is a medical necessity  
when using MDMA, especially in combination with physical exertion.  safe guess  
that a few people at Freedom were dosed and dancing, eh?  seems to me it's  
grossly negligent for a producer of a full-price commercial rave not to have  
plenty of water on hand.  in fact, i believe that great britain, after several  
rave/MDMA deaths, enacted a law requiring that clubs/raves make water freely  
available.  i'm glad that you and others had a great time, peter, but if the  
water ran out at Freedom, and early at that, seems to me Rave Consumer Reports  
would rate the event NOT ACCEPTABLE.

couldn't agree more.  i've pretty much adopted a policy of not attending raves  
for which pricing is not fully disclosed in advance.  for a few years now, i've  
left messages on rave info line vmailboxes politely asking for this information  
- the same producers that haven't disclosed prices in the past continue not to  
do so.  i agree with starchild's assessment of the probable motive.  i'll rave  
elsewhere, thanks.

sorry for bitching.  on a positive note, i thought the sunset party on sunday  
was especially nice (my favorite nearby location!).  not many people dancing  
circa four thirty, but by six or so it was gearing up.  warm, mellow, friendly  
gathering.  wish i could've stayed longer.  thank you once again, Pacific gang!   
- bob

That was me shouting, with about 5 of my friends of mine from here in
sac-town. Remember there was a thread going around about a vibe is only
as good as you make it. Well, me and the friends I ran into made it
that.  I'm sorry you didn't get a chance to enjoy your seelf.

I personally had a great time in the back room listening to Steve dj. I
left my friends in the main room to to see how this guy was. I ended up
just standind there in awe with about four other people. We looked at
eachother and almost said simultaniously,"That it the deepest I've ever
heard" It was incredible.

That set will live in my head(and in my tape deck) for a long time.
Don't get me wrong mike. I agree, F&F was and will always be a better
party. But when you can't help but to have a good time then.......

Well I missed Freedom due to an unexpected sickness. Went to sunset and
flew my kite(the best three hours of my weekend)

See you at COME-UNITY. Like always I'll be center stage either with a
white AWAKEN shirt or a sleeveless under shirt!

Also dont forget about Groove Trip Presents "HIGHER LOVE" Friday.
I forget the number but I'm sure its on the calendar. Just look for me
near the sound equipment(I sometimes feel chained, so a big smile and a
hug would brighten my night!)


Love you all,

Soundgod@iccse.com

Hi folks

I'm about to touch down in California for the first time &
I've been lurking for a week or so on the list, looked at the sf calendar
& still haven't seen a great deal which takes grabs my attention.

Anybody got any suggestions for these dates & locations:

Santa Barbara 10th July - 18th July
San Francisco 18th July - 27th July

Any Web pointers of *good* places to see & do while I'm out there?
I don't drive so how do I get to the outdoor parties?

Thanks in advance for any offers of help etc  Hope I can catch a couple of
decent events while I'm in your neck of the woods!!

yrs, a lost Scot

I thought I had read all their was to read in pretentious  flyers until 
I read the flyer for the next Prgress party.  People here know that I 
do not care for manifesto's or people telling me what to think; this 
is not what rave culture is all about.  BUt the people who wrote 
this flyer are obviously unaware of this fact so what they are doing 
in the rave scene in the first place is a tatal mystery to me.  Why 
don't you all try going to church instead if you people like hot air 
so much?  And anyway, your party sucks: I went to the first one and 
it was bad, really bad.  So get off the religion tip now and people 
might then start taking you seriously; because right now Prgress, 
and the people involved with it, are the laughing stock of the 
entire SF rave community.
Also, all this stuff about the Celistian profocies is also 
bullshit.  It's all a lie invented by the Illuminatai in an effort 
to brain wash people who can not believe in God.        
TRISTAN.

Hey all,

        This isn't strictly rave related, but I thought some of you would
find this interesting.  It just goes to show how many lies you can spread
when you've got money on your side.

Thats really sick.  No wonder I started making all my own beer 
three years ago.  I really like real beer (not the stuff most american
brewers call beer)  but did not want to support any of the major
corprate bullshit.  There are some of the obivious ones (like Bush and Coors)
but I would imagine that most every major brewer including all the big 
imports have some kinda bullshit like that going on.  

Make your own or drink microbrew.

Lighten up dude, If you don't want to be involved in this kinda thing
don't go.  Progress makes it very obvious what their trying to do 
with thier parties (on both their flyers and on their directions)
so if it's not your kinda sceen, don't go.  I personally have enjoyed
them and have found some relavance in the Celistian Proficies.

Remember, theres room for all.

ps. About the church thing, dance is a form of prayer for me so when I go
to events it's almost like going to church.

In your opinion ofcource?  

Personally, that book came in near the beginning of my spiruality, which is
now the dominate force in my life.  CP helped to crystalize alot of beliefs
and feelings that I developed on my own through my own experiences.  I
believe it generalizes alot of the subject matter, but for a book like that
to be read and taken to heart by the millions of people who are now reading
it can only benefit our race IMHO.  I think it can open the door to
spirituality for alot of people who need it.  Once the door is open they can
individually dig deeper to find what's really true for them.  I have.

I think it's an excellent book.

If I may be permitted an observation:

Flamewars happen when both sides of an argument invest ego in their
remarks.  This is not necessarily bad, but it often seems to happen
after the fact.  For example:

A makes an offhand comment about a party
being boring (or whatever), and B defends that party, and
instead of leaving it at that, A decides that B's view is a
challenge to the legitimacy of their own, and invests ego in it.
According to the ego, "there can be only one", and A attacks B.

B is hurt by this attack, and hir ego strikes back.  Now both agree
that there must be a winner and a loser, and combat is engaged.

When people talk face-to-face, there exist a multitude of non-verbal
cues to let people know how everyone is feeling.  Online, these do not
exist, since people have to get over a certain threshold of emotion
in order to post.  Therefore, the usual signals that let people know
that everyone either a) agrees with you, b) agrees with your friend,
c) thinks both of you are full of shit, or d) really doesn't care 
who's right, are all absent, and the little tempest of flying curses
veers off into the sunset.

I don't think people shouldn't argue.  I do think people should 
consider carefully whether to invest themselves in an intellectual
proposition, and also that sometimes silence is a more impressive argument
than insult.

Hi all,

	Sorry to anyone who tried t ocome out ot our party (the Cloud 
Factory) yesterday and found that we werent there.  The beach patrol made 
us shut down at about eight thrity pm.  I'm really upset about the whole 
ordeal and we are going to be writing some letters to the county and city 
of Santa Cruz soon.  I would like to try and open a dialog with someone 
at the county level so we can semi-officially at least have parties 
during the day!  They told us we need a permit for any amplified sound in 
the county and that we were on private property that was public access 
land but to do an event there we need a permit and teh owners 
permission...basically he sounded liek he didnt know what he was talking 
about.  As a note if you havent read the flier "Raves and the Law" and 
you are going to a renegade party you should read it (you can find it at 
http://gladstone.uoreogn.edu/~drenalin/knowledge/ravelaw.html).  The info 
in afroementioned flier was very helpful in the way I approached the 
officers and the party I went to afterwards obviously the house owners 
didnt read it because they didnt even answetr their door when the opolice 
knocked???  

Thanks if you came out and supported us we'll see you soon

love drenalin

ps the cloud factory sound system now with Big Bottom sound =) (get

actually, its not tristan's opinion that the book is an effort by the
illuminati to repress certians paths of thinking. by definition, the
illuminati are behind everything. this includes ALL books in print sold by
your local corporate book retailer. fortunately, ravers are sometimes
immune to illuminai tactics, or maybe that's just another false front
aimed at confusing the rest of us? hail eris and spare change.

I'd like to add some comments of my own, if I could.

* Often, there is no need for a "winner" and a "loser".  As
  long as positions from both sides are aired, the readers
  can decide for themselves... In fact, most of the readers
  probably won't care one way or the other!  But as long as
  people feel they need to get in the last word, flamewars
  go on forever...

* Apologizing and admitting you're wrong when you ARE
  wrong is one of the hardest things to do, but it's
  also one of the most noble.  Keep that in mind.  I have a
  lot of respect for people who can do this, and very little
  for people who try to "win" every argument just for the
  sake of winning.

This has been your sappy thought for the day.  We now return
you to your regularly scheduled programming.

On the topic of MTV filming at raves:  I think the one group that has
remained silent on this (as far as I can tell) is the Smart Drink people.
What role do they play in this whole thing?  (Not that it's a thing yet,
but if it were?)  What is their connection to MTV.  I heard the MTV story
was to be about alternatives to drugs?  Yes?  No?

With this in mind I watched their (Smart Drink) tent briefly at Freedom
(before having this nauseous, creepy feeling come over me that I was at a
Dead show) and realized that it looked just like a freaked out TV series
studio set.  It was way to produced.  Way to "colorful" and "trippy."  I
envisioned a new show on MTV called: The Real Ravers.

Does anyone know who these Smart Drink dealers are and what their marketing
philosophy is in selling a product at raves, and what kind of relationship
might exist between them and MTV?

amen!  er, i agree.

surely there are lots of reasons to be uninterested in, or even to dislike,  
what most of us think of as "church" or "religion" - images of rigid,  
controlling, moralistic, patriarchal, institutions that have been responsible  
for lots of bloodshed and misery.  but not all "churches" or "religions" are  
like that.

sometimes it's easier to adopt a new word than to change the unwanted  
associations surrounding an established word.  hence "gay" instead of  
"homosexual"; "african-american" instead of "colored".  and so many of us think  
of ourselves as "spiritual" rather than "religious".

in the case of religion, however, there is a reason to reclaim the distasteful  
word instead of replacing it:  the first amendment to the U.S. constitution  
protects the free exercise of religion, not free exercise of spirituality.   
that right seems too valuable to throw away just because we don't like what  
some religions have been.

instead of dwelling on distasteful past or present "religions", how about  
imagining religions that we *would* like?

How bout when they had a party at Seal Rock-- 'the outdoors thing'.  They
were selling tix at Safeway even though there was *noSIGN of a party* at
the beach.  No SoundSystem, confused party-goers, lost DJ's, etc..  And
there was nobody there to tell the masses what was going on.  The next day,
I was asking eveyrone what happened and the word was that the sound guy
bailed out.  My question is.. If they knew this.. Why did they still charge
people knowing there wouldn't be a party?

        I didn't want to step in on this too early as i do have a hand in
this.  I have not attended any of the parties due to economic/geographical
problems and so i only get second hand information on what they were like.
I do know that this is a book that i _personally_ have found very
enlightening, not so much a door unto itself but a key.  Ok, there are
problems with it prose-wise (i was an english student 1st year ;) but i
think that that is beside point.  The ideas contained in this book are
nothing new to ppl who have investigated mostly every eastern religion (and
have even studied the words of the bible, less the 'religion') but when
these ideas, alien to most in the west, are presented in an easily read but
stimulative package...well i agree, only good can come of it.  I personally
believe that 'beleif creates reality' (if that isn't too hard to follow,
sorry, haha). For example, i think that something as simple as positive
thought is a _direct_ neurochemical trigger.  It's also dialectical, if one
has certain 'happy chemicals' running through their body, positive thoughts
will arise.  The point i'm trying to make is that if you invest faith in a
belief system it will affect your 'real' life.  Maybe this is why the world
is so messed up as the attainment of material wealth and various other
belief systems which underlie all of our actions are, IMHO, false and can
act as the backbone to our present social order...but i blab too much...
        i say believe what you want to believe, do what you want to do just
as long as it doesn't step on anyone's toes.
        ps-->there are a lot of bits in the insights that are actually
being substantiated by chaos theory and modern physics, if this is 'proof'
enough of their worth.

The first chapter of The Celestine Prophecy and an interview with
its author can be found on the web via:

http://newciv.org/worldtrans/positive.html

I'll share my opinion on it through private email if anyone is interested.

There are some other interesting links on this page as well.

i'm not partying much these days so i haven't been to a progress party 
myself, tho i'm curious to see just how they integrate the Celestine 
Prophecy stuff into the party... 

but i couldn't let this one fly by without a response (cuz my funny virgo 
mind really enjoys picking apart people's arguments!)
first, a flyer about spirituality and/or ideology is not necessarily 
"telling people how to think."  it's one way of looking at the world, 
that's all. you can take it or leave it or modify it if you want.  and 
rave culture is whatever we want to make it and it's certainly not 
homogenous and there's certainly room for spirituality/religion.  
second, dance can be spiritual.  and why confine spirituality to a 
church?  i live and breathe it every day (tho if you simply want to 
breathe exhaust fumes that's up to you!)

actually, i'm done "picking apart" (ain't that much to pick! might as 
well pick my nose!), but i've got a question:

does anyone have a copy of The Celestine Prophecy they would lend out?  
i've been tempted to read it just to see what the fuss is all about, but 
i've only seen it in hardback (unfortunately a pretty damn exclusive 
format. alas.)

anyway, please email me in person if you have this bok floating around, 
looking for a temporary home (and i take very good care of books!)

thanks and take care everyone!\

Dear Tristan,

	I suppose I should know better than to take issue with anything 
you post, if I want to keep my dialogue with other sfravers invective and 
flame-free.  The reason I do so is that I do not believe the author of 
the Progress flyer is on sfraves currently herself to be able to respond 
to you, and what you said above deserves a response, assuming you meant 
it and were not merely trying to get a rise out of the rest of us.  :)
	Let me ask you this, Tristan.  Do you feel our scene would be 
better off without any spiritual or intellectual content?  I can 
understand you disagreeing with the philosophy expressed by someone and 
taking issue with it, but you seem to be complaining that no one should 
express any philosophy on their flyers *at all*.  Is this really what you 
want?  Whether Progress is a "good" or "bad" party is a separate issue 
entirely -- throwing in your negative opinion of it is just adding insult 
to injury.
	Please remember, no one is telling you how to think.  You're free 
to ignore the ideas you see printed on rave flyers, posted to the list, 
or anywhere else.

In the past has been know to keep company with the Dreaded Stranger On An 
Ostrich, although neither of them have a break-dance move to boast about 
at the moment and one can't help but wonder that maybe if Jesus Christ 
had gotten laid a bit more often Planet Earth wouldn't be so uptight at 
times.  

Even so, fun has never proven to be hard to find.

Subject: Holiday Weekend Massive Report
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

I made my first serious Bay Area trip in two months this past weekend
and had a really good time.  Just a few of the sights'n'sounds . . .

Friday evening I arrived at the Oakland airport, completely relieved
at the cloudy 70 degree weather after an increasingly stifling week
in Portland -- by the time I left town that afternoon it was 100!
A bit much for us Northwesterners . . .

Due to misreading the calendar, I missed Diverse City and only got to
hear about Ethan's way-hot set later on :)  Brothers & Sisters was not
nearly as juiced as the last couple of times I went, the crowd thinned
out early and missed a decent set from DJ Dan (who I finally got to hear
live) and an excellent follow-up by Kelly, who played a track on the
Shindig label and thus got my loyalty (Shindig is a virtually unknown
label from north of London which, like Cancan and a couple of others,
can do no wrong in my book)!  Overall she played a solid pumping set
but the response from the assembled was hardly "massive" . . .

Saturday afternoon was another Organic-in-the-Park, mercifully without
the distractions of the rumored MTV video crew (but it was fun to rant
about it anyway).  I thought Galen and Garth both played pretty well,
and the MV (massive vibe) was definitely present.  Lots of friends,
lots of talking, lots of dancing raising a buncha dust!

Saturday night I took a nap and then Allen Ameba and I and another friend
drove out to Livermore for the annual Freedom bash.  Quite a few people
reported they had a fantastic time there.  My response was a bit more
ambivalent.  When we got there right before sunrise, Spun was playing 
a crackling, thumping set with a bunch of new stuff he said he just
brought back from Chicago.  But there wasn't much of a cohesive vibe,
just a swirling crowd and a bit of shuffling and dancing up front.
I climbed the hill to watch the sunrise, a fine moment indeed.  About
that time Joe Rice cranked up in the ambient tent, playing an eclectic
mix of beats, and even though I promised him I wouldn't say it, here 
it is . . . he played a dub-plate-special jungle track!  Meanwhile Garth
was treading the same grooves he had at Organic, repeating several tracks
including 'Rockit', and got the crowd going cohesively for a good aprt
of the set, at the end of which we briefly connected hand-in-hand around
the ring and then rushed into the center for some serious dancing frenzy.
I didn't think Freedom was all that fantastic, but I'm glad I got to
see the site (an old dirt motorcycle racetrack next to a gravel pit
way the hell out in nowhere north of Livermore), and Martin seemed pretty
happy in the aftermath.

Sunday is Sunset day, of course, and it was probably the best of the 
handful I've been able to attend, back on the water side of the Berkeley
Marina with beautiful if windy weather and a great crowd.  I thought
Monte stole the show with a wonderful old-style breaks-and-aciiiieeed
set that made me thank the heavens for the likes of DJ Pierre and the
golden age of acid house.  More hands-together-and-then-rush in, jumping
and waving.  So I got to see both the sunrise and sunset this time!

Monday I did some work and then a little record shopping at Tweekin.
I'd already been invited to spin at Stinson Beach for the 4th with
the Frequency 8 crew, and when I got to Ameba late in the day it turned
out plans were a-hatchin' for a Bolinas beach bash as well.  I ended
up playing first at Stinson, at the Village Green town park right at
the center of town, followed by Mars, Cyr and Mystr-E.  I played mellow
house and they played more trance.  We got some curious stares but no
static from the expected local complainers, one request to turn down
the bass and a next-door-neighbor complaint that was fairly well resolved.
The clouds lifted around 3 and it was a fine time indeed.

Later I was able to get over to Bolinas where the Ameba gang had already
been on the beach for hours.  A really good happy scene with fantastic
weather (if a little windy), surfers right off the beach, a fishing boat
or two off in the distance, and a couple hundred people just hanging 
around or grooving to the tunes.  Allen Ameba finished up with an excellent
Ameba-dub-mindwarp set, and graciously let me play the final track of the
day, LTJ Bukem's extraordinary "Horizons," which seemed appropriate as
the sun set behind the cliff above us and the Pacific stretched out to
infinity past the beach . . . 

Then we went to the Bolinas Bakery and, in traditional fashion, got
*stuffed* with desserts'n'stuff, while dodging the local drunks and
taking in the Bolinas 4th of July atmosphere . . .

A pretty damn fine weekend.  If I could have a complaint, it would only
be that there was so much good stuff to do that I only got in about
two hours of record shopping.  But naaah, I won't complain!

	This is not (directly) related to the rave scene in any way, so 
if you are not interested in political issues relating to our freedom in 
cyberspace, go ahead and delete it and move on.

	I hesitated before posting it at all, but knowing who Jim Warren 
is, when I read his statement that this is one of the most important 
messages he's ever posted, I felt obligated to pass it on, even though I 
lack complete understanding of the technical concepts involved.

	As freedom-loving ravers who use cyberspace to communicate, I 
think we have common cause with others who do not want this ability to be 
curtailed by large telecommunications companies charging us ruinous 
access fees.  As detailed below, we apparantly have a window of 
opportunity to make the case for maximum public access (i.e. electronic 
democracy) before the rules governing the Internet are written in stone 
to the advantage of big government and big business...

This is one of the most important public policy items I have ever posted!

This can be a *real* Declaration of Independence for the 21st Century.

This is one of the most important battles that citizens, community
organizations, educators, local government officials and newspapers (if
they plan to continue to exist beyond newsprint) will fight in this decade,
against government-granted monopolies and regulation-protected cartels!

I have been trying to find time to write about this ever since Dewayne
Hendricks told me about it about a month ago.  Bill Frezza's done it; done
it well; and Interactive Age has just published it. [below]

=46olks, if we, the People, can successfully lobby-the-hell outa Congress,
the White House and the FCC - *right now*! - "mere" American citizens and
otherwise-deadmeat consumers can bypass the upcoming monopolistic regional
telecommunications and cable cartels and their for-certain gouge'em-deep
rate increases that will occur as soon as the current secret-deal
Telecommunications Deform Act passes and next year's elections are safely
behind the Washington Beltway's deal-makers.

IF WE ACT NOW - and persevere - we can have the economical, technological
viable option of completely bypassing local-loop telecomm monopolies of the
telcos, cable operators and other big-bucks telecomm giants.

=46REE voice and data communications for residential, educational, business,
community, city, county, rural *and* mobile voice and data-communications.

ALL OF US can have FREE metropolitan-area voice, data and compressed-video
communications - point-to-point, and for that matter, point-to-multipoint
(i.e., everyone becomes a broadcaster, but only to those whom they permit
to receive!).


But we *must* act now - because the TELECOMM GIANTS *DON'T* WANT THIS!

ONLY massive public pressure can overcome their massive lobbying megabucks.


The idea is simple:

Have the FCC declare a tiny portion of what was once *understood* to be the
public's broadcast spectrum to be - in fact - PUBLIC SPECTRUM (a range of
frequencies available for free public use).  The formal petition has
ALREADY BEEN FILED with the FCC.  The rule-making PROCESS HAS ALREADY
BEGUN; public comments have already been solicited.

Open that public spectrum to FREE use by EVERYONE, subject to NO
restrictions at all except (1) broadcast power that will limit range to,
typically, about 15 to 30 miles, and (2) require use of a given frequency
for only a very brief time - seconds or even milliseconds (assumes use of
well-developed, nonproprietary "spread spectrum" techniques, where an
ongoing communication takes place on one frequency for tiny time, then
moves to another frequency, then another and so on; the most efficient use
and sharing of broadcast spectrum that is possible!).


24-megabits per second - that's 3 megabytes per second!

NO phone bills!

NO corporate owners!

NO wires - just a teeny weeny antenna. At most.

NO fees - just a one-time purchase of cheap home, office, car or beltloop
transcievers, and whatever you wish to plug into them ... phones, data
modems, video cameras, temperature monitors, etc.

NO operator licensing - just type-licensed transceivers, exactly the same
as police, cabbie and CB-band radios.

NO eves-droppers - since the spreading algorithms can be infinately and
dynamically varied (and communications can be further scrambled, to boot).

NO censorship needed - since content is *inherently* "scrambled".

METROPOLITAN area range (far beyond a single cell-phone site).


REAL content competition - not the fake "competition" of
government-created, government-licensed, government-protected conduit and
content corporate cartels.

Pollution-free, environmentally-sound, wire-free regional electronic public
parks.


WRITE AND FAX *NOW* - to the FCC *and* to your Congress-critters and the
Clinton White House that has been so busy selling the public's spectrum to
the few who can afford it.  Or ... obediently wait and watch the cartels
raise our rates.

Where the I-way meets the skyway

By Bill Frezza     [via dewayne@warpspeed.com (Dewayne Hendricks)]

The visionaries at Apple Computer Inc. are at it again, pushing the
envelope of technology, regulatory policy and business development.

While Microsoft Corp.'s Bill Gates focuses on the here and now of elbowing
into the online business, Apple has fast-forwarded to a kinder, gentler
future where free spirits wirelessly surf the Web and the unstructured,
self-organizing chaos of the Internet is extended to the rigid disposition
of the airwaves.

Weaving together the politically popular themes of international
competitiveness, enhanced educational opportunities, free market solutions
for the info have-nots, health-care reform, quality leisure time and hard
core mobile computing, Apple's recent petition to the FCC for an unlicensed
"NII band" is this summer's best read. Check it out at

        http://www.apple.com/documents/fcc.html

        [Better still, use  http://www.warpspeed.com/ , explained below. --j=
im]

What they're asking for is simple enough: 300 megahertz of prime real
estate up at 5 gigahertz, enough to accommodate high density
24-megabit-per-second connections in a fluid mix of local and wide area
networking. This amounts to about $40 billion worth of spectrum, if you go
by the size of the checks the phone companies wrote for Personal
Communications Services (PCS) frequencies. And, oh yeah, they don't want it
for themselves. They want it made available free to all comers, subject
only to interference--reducing technical standards. No auctions, no license
fees, no regulations on what it's used for, and no airtime charges.

Does this renew your faith in chutzpa or what?

It's certainly a different model than either the newfangled auction
approach or the tired old lobbyist-take-all system. Think of it as spectrum
homesteading, a uniquely American experiment in don't-fence-me-in,
anti-industrial policy.

Before you scoff, remember that Apple has been down this path before. It
first petitioned the FCC for Data-PCS frequencies for nomadic computing
back in 1991. This resulted in the allocation of a juicy 20 MHz slice smack
in the middle of the aforementioned PCS bands. Unfortunately for the PC
industry, defeat was snatched from the jaws of victory when the entrenched
telephony interests shanghaied the band in pursuit of a home for cordless
PBXs. (A chagrined FCC later tossed the computer folks some crumbs at 2.4
GHz).

The petition proposes spectrum sharing by fixed and mobile users on a
completely ad-hoc basis. This "spectrum etiquette" is a brilliant blend of
good science and free market ingenuity. Spectrum etiquette imposes no
centralized control and assumes no traffic prioritization.

Rather, it is a low level media access scheme similar to the rules we
follow for private conversations at crowded cocktail parties. You can speak
=46rench, German, or Chinese - whatever you please - as long as you exclude
bozos that stand up on chairs and give loud and long-winded speeches.
Beyond that, anything goes.

But beware of the lobbyist-loaded coterie that frustrated Apple's plans
last time. Flying under the WINForum banner, the telephony interests are
angling for the same spectrum with a rival petition. Their technical
approach, however, asserts the primacy of circuit-switched voice,
necessitating a hierarchical architecture with choke points and centralized
control.

Haven't they hogged enough bandwidth? They call their system SUPERNet. I
think SUCKERNet fits a lot better. The Europeans developing HIPERLAN didn't
buy their jive, so now they're trying to peddle it here.

And they may succeed unless the Washington-averse PC industry files
supporting comments before July 25.

        [=3D=3D=3DIMPORTANT ACTION ITEM!=3D=3D=3D]

        Drop a letter or postcard referencing petition RM-8653 to:
        Office of the Secretary
        Federal Communications Commission (FCC)
        Washington DC 20554

        or send e-mail to  jlovette@apple.com  and offer your help.

Apple's decision to position this as the NII band is perhaps their best
hope, part of a savvy constituency shopping game. But posturing aside, if
this dream comes true what we'll really get is an entrepreneurs band. Not
the kind of fake entrepreneurs with half a billion dollar war chests, or
some bogus designated entity front organization. But real entrepreneurs
that hock their cars, quit their day jobs and go for the glory. The kind of
people that founded Apple and created the PC industry in the first place.

So good luck intrepid infobahn warriors. May your vision become our
reality. I can barely squirt 8 kilobits per second out of my antenna today.
With 24 mbps to horse around with and no physical connections to trace, who
knows what mischief we can cause?

        Again, very nice article Bill.  I pulled it off the IA website and
sent a copy to Jim Lovette of Apple ...  He called me to discuss the
story after he read it and together we have the following comments:

o       Jim and I would [prefer that people use] the URL for my
website instead of Apple's.  We wanted to have the petition up for public
access on the Internet at a non-Apple site ...

                        http://www.warpspeed.com/

o       Jim is preparing a lot of additional content on this issue that we
were going to post on my website in the coming weeks.  That's another
reason why we wanted the URL to be for my site so that people could have
access to this additional material.  There was/is no plan to post this new
material on the Apple site.

o       In your story, you refer to comments being due at the FCC by July
25th.  The correct date is the 10th.  Reply comments are due on the 25th
and there is a major procedural difference between the two dates as far as
the FCC is concerned.  Reply comments are supposed to address issues raised
by the comments that are filed.  No real harm done, but we thought we'd
mention it.

        My website has been hit quite a bit since I put the Apple NII
petition up.  Here is the stats that I generated today:

                        ----------------------------

        Jim and I have no idea how many comments are going to be filed with
the FCC on this matter.  To date, we have gotten very few queries on the
issue.  Lots have people have access the petition, but there has been
no followup discussion, etc.

Alas, if this doesn't change and a fair number of comments are filed in
favor of this concept, then it will die an early death.

        Asking for 300 MHz of spectrum to be turned over to the public for
its own use, without an auction, was a pretty gutsy move on Apple's part I
believe.  It continues in the tradition of the original Data-PCS petition
they submitted to the FCC four years ago.  At that time, no one really
thought that the Commission would respond favorably to such a bold move on
the part of the computer industry.  Well, they did and the spectrum
allocation for Data-PCS is history.  Problem is, I don't think that in this
case, without major public support, lightning will strike twice in the same
place.

Thanks again,
-- Dewayne

Raving is teaching me many lessons about UNITY.  As I experience unity I 
find that I crave unity.  This craving often draws me to raves to experience 
a hieghtened sense of unity.  I find that going to a rave might not 
always do it, but it can as I can outside of raves as well.

Sometimes my desire might cause me to want to jump to this state of 
unity, but I find that without mine and others individuality there is no 
sense of unity.
Validating my own individuality  allowing me to own my feelings then 
helps me feel more secure to share them with others.  Validating others 
feelings helps others feel more secure with their feelings making it easier 
for them to share. Through this sharing a greater sense of unity is felt.
I find that the walls that I and others put up making them more separate 
can become bridges to unity.  Celebrating our individuality is part of 
celebrating our Unity.  I feel so much joy in my heart just thinking and 
writing about it.  Life can really feel like a party, when I understand 
how to party.  Thanks everyone just for being, because it is your 
beingness that adds to the party.

I'll be brief...

It was clubby.  Very much so.  Felt like a different party than the past
couple months.  The music and lights had their usual trance enducing
energy, but the people seemed like they had come to check out what all the
fuss was about from the months before.  It was a friend of mine's first one
and while she liked it (we managed to get pretty wasted), I felt like she
wasn't experiencing the true vibe that this "school-night party" can really
produce.

It was a pretty busy week for most people it seems, that may have had
something to do with it.  There was no line at 3 a.m. when we left....if
that says anything.  I doubt there was a line at all.

I saw very few familar faces.  Don't get me wrong, I don't think that's bad
in itself, but certainly different from the past four months or so.

That's all I have time to write....Oh, the chill room was a sight.
Artistic dancers everywhere, as if a dance class had gotten out and decided
to do extra credit in the basement of 1015.  It was actually pretty cool,
but unfortunately several people in the audience were rude about it;
laughing and shit...

Peace!

Tony

P.S.  I know that C/U can have a strong club feel to it, and I really kind
of like that, but there was one incident a few months ago that I meant to
relay to everyone:  As I was hanging on the stairs leading from the stage
to the lounge area on the second floor I got completely drenched by a gin
and tonic.  (Not so bad given the temperature of that place.)  I turned
around to witnesss the drink owner tell his friend in a very hostile tone
that this third guy spilled his drink.  The third guy had no idea what was
going on, besides the fact that he was about to be assaulted, but I do know
that he did not intentionally dump this guys drink.  The two proceeded to
stand directly in this poor guys face and scare the living shit out of him,
threatening him in a beligerent manner unless he bought the guy another
drink.  I truly thought it was going to come to something very non-PLUR
like, but finally the thrid guy managed to get away from there and the two
went on there way grumbling about "the motherfucking piece of shit..."  It
was the kind of incident you see happen at Sunset all the time.  ;^)

Hang on to those drinks folks!  (And see you at Wicked...)

I know, I'm probably going to get flamed for this one... But theres WAY TOO
MUCH of this being played in SF.  I like ambient stuff.. but I really enjoy
going out to *dance* to some good techno (Jeff Mills, DBX, Dave Clark, UR,
Paul Johnson, Eric Martin, etc. etc. etc.)  Doesn't anyone play anything
else besides trance, ambient, and happy house?

HELP!

I dont think I will support progress until they pay back the money they 
so nicely took from me a few weeks ago.  I cannot believe that they did 
not come back to the parking lot and buy back all our tickets.  We were 
all waiting for them.  Then they told me to go to sunset for my money.  
Yeah right!  They never showed.

I could not agree with you more.   The fact is raving is more spiritual 
and religious for many ravers than christianty and church are for many 
many christians.  This goes the same for most organized religions.  I 
don't think that true faith exists in a good deal of these people 
because they were born and raised of that religion.  They have not 
discovered it.  True faith comes from realizations.  This faith is 
Sacred. 

     As time goes on we may find ourselves needing the 1st amendment to 
justify our actions.  To protect one of the few true religious 
experiences occuring in this nation.  Just as American Indians fight to 
protect their use of certain herbs.

Dont get me wrong about other religions.  I know their our many 
christians who have had true spiritual experiences.  I just feel that 
most of them may know their bible inside and out but just dont 
Understand it.

Before we get all starry-eyed and utopian, let us consider two facts:

1) The Decency bill is virtually dead.

and

2) Next April the National Science Foundation, who manage the internet
nowadays, will be handing the reins over to a few telephone/other
communications companies.

There are people who do, but since nothing outside of those styles is
popular, people who don't play them don't get asked to play.

In order to listen to other kinds of dance music others then those 
mentioned below one really needs to go to London or New York.

Do I take it that Progress ripped people off by selling people tickets 
before hand and then when they could not have the party (for what ever 
reasons) they did not give people beack their money?
     If this is true PROGRESS HAVE COMMITTED ONE OF THE FEW CRIMES GOING 
IN RAVE CULTURE. Any sound system that does that is so week and petty 
as that not only should have
no-one ever go to one of their parties in the future, all the people 
involved in it should all be sent to coventry and thus slowly be pushed 
out of the SF scene altogether.  In life, it does not get much lower then 
an action such as this.  I always thought that the Prgress people were a 
bunch of arceholes and this confirms it.  Despite their facade of the 
Celistine Profercies they are no better then a tv evangalist; both are 
merely conmen theifs.
Stand up for rights and don't be prepared to put up with shit like this.  
Boycot their parties, dis them publicly, destroy/refuse their flyers.  I 
mean, they did not even bother to apologise did they?   Quite simply, a more
off the vibe bunch of 
people you will have difficulty meeting in the SF rave scene.  Ah well, at 
least they are exception to the rule.

It was a good party  especially the chill out room where the dj was 
playing some really nice Ambient stuff and the decor and lighting were 
really nice.  But it was to rammed upstairs to be able to dance or to 
really be able to get into to it properly.  This is because Come/Unity 
has become a victim of it's success and they too now need to find a 
bigger venue; or maybe open up another floor?

Isn't this DISCRIMINATION?

Are english people the only people cool enough to interview? We can't
have any of those trailer-park-raised, drive-in-movie seein', 
goin'-to-the-market-in-curlers, hot-dog eatin',
pre-servative-and-nitrate mutated, not-kings-english drawlin', baseball
lovin', misshapen-football throwin', jheri-curl-drippin', strip-mall
courtin', backseat-of-a-chevy conceivin' ... USA motherfuckers now can
ya? (:-), as if you needed it).

Well put that on yer kipper and smoke it baby!

I agree w/ TRISTAN and Chris Chervin. Perhaps an advertised internet
boycott, posted to all US rave e-mail groups, plus alt.rave is in
order. Add a 'cc' to any of the progress people and let them respond TO
DA PEOPLE if they are willing to; even better, let them announce either
a refund or a WIDELY ADVERTISED, FREE, OUTDOORS CONCERT (E.G. @ GOLDEN
GATE BANDSHELL) WITH TOP-$$ TOP-NAME DJ'S. Karma will be repaid, and
Karma don't take Amerikkkan X-press.

PS: there's <someone> (and it wouldn't be fair to say who) that I've
talked to that was previously associated w/ the Progress parties. This
person said that there were some serious problems w/ some people
involved with progress and that a division has happened. 

PPS: This new-age spirituality/rave thing is pretty ripe for
exploitation no? Maybe we should form a cult; I'll be happy to add
contacts from the Christian Identity Movement, the Unabomber, ex-Branch
Davidians, the World Bank, the United Nations, and the illuminati.
Imagine the party you could have with your own armed security. Nothin'
like machine guns to make you dance!

...or Chicago or Milwaukee or Detroit or....

I realize that straight up techno is not very popular right
now in SF, but please don't make the mistake of thinking
that trance, ambient and happy house predominate in EVERY
city...

In chicago, the main styles are trax (paul johnson, dbx,
green velvet, etc) and jungle, while in detroit, the main
styles are techno, techno/house, electro, etc.  Milwaukee is
predominantly hard acid and hardcore, while Baltimore is
hard trance and slow breaks..  ..and in each of these
cities, sub-scenes flourish.

I realize that not everyone is going to like the same kind
of music that I do, but I hope I'll be able to find some
people who are on the same musical wavelength as me when I
move out there.

If you want to hear techno at a big, expensive party, then yes, one needs 
to look elsewhere.  But, there are plenty of small, cheap parties which 
pop up periodically catering to a more techno-friendly audience.  You may 
have a hard time finding much true harsh/fast/driving techno, but keep 
your eyes open- just a couple of weeks ago there was a Berlin/SF party at 
dv8 with none other than Jeff Mills and a handful of other Berlin types.  
Even sfrave dj's Ethan and Bryce (when he's not playing ambient) give a 
much appreciated alternative to the SF "sound".  Also check out events 
with Alex, Jonah, or Minor Minor.  SF has lots going on.  You just have 
to look harder for some things then for others...

what are you talking about?  When I lived in Detroit..  There were parties
that were about 5 dollars, in a small quaint sweatbox,  about 300 people,
and you got to hear Dan Bell, Richie Hawtin, Stacey Pullen, Juan Atkins,
Carl Craig.. etc. etc.

I did keep my eyes open, and I did go to the dv8.  Instead of hearing happy
house, it was primarily happy hardcore.  I don't know which is worse.  As
much as I enjoyed Jeff Mills, and Blake Baxter... The rest of the party was
a bit annoying (IMHO)

It's funny, because most SFRAVErS feel that techno is fast, pumping,
chainsaw terror music.  I think this has alot to do with why *alot* of
people won't even consider going to a techno related event (big or small).  

And for the record..  Jeff Mills is from Detroit.  I couldn't understand why
everyone keeps insisting he is a German DJ.  (kinda funny)

thats why SF is kind of lame.  because the people/promoters/djs have a hard
time deviating from the mean.   I think it sucks that I can't go out and
here the music that we grew up on (or the style) that we are accustomed to
out east and midwest.  To be honest.. There is just no variety in the scene
here.  There is no progression.

Since people are talking about music that is not exactly the same ole SF
sound - last night I was in the woods "north of the gate" with Frequency 8...
These guys spin wonderful cybertrance from Germany and Northern Europe
ranging from 140-160 bpm mostly.... I was talking to J. Cyr and he said
they usually do this type of music and they are working on warming a crowd
up to it... I'm warm I'm warm  !

  I keep wondering if the people who are talking about "happy house" are
hanging out in the clubs too much? There are wonderful DJ's that are doing
a wide variety of things in the SF underground. And there seems to be a
very healthy underground... I keep hearing about Wicked and C/U over and 
over like a broken record but I keep going to better parties with better
music in the underground. *** Of course "better" is in the experience of the
person and your mileage may vary ;)

When I first started going to parties, before any of the English people came,
the strongest aspect that drew my interest to this scene was the diversity of
styles of music played by the DJs. Calling attention to this memory may spark
some variety-outbreak amongst those who might read this message, but it would
only be a top-down aberration (Garth playing Rockit) that trickles down
somewhere to influence somebody, maybe. But still it would only be an extra
wrinkle in the features of the scene, since it long ago ceased to be a part
of its foundation.

Frequency 8 was wonderful as anticipated. The crowd was intimate (ie. small).
 Although I only had time to sit (ahem, I mean dance) thru Myster-E and Mars
sets (which could be described as fire and water).  It was worth the drive.
 Since I was on the floor (or should I say trail) I didn't do too much
conversing nor chatting w/my fellow raver's.  But all in all a good time was
had.....

See-ya at the sunset...

Adam.

Ps: A special hiya to all those who had the opportunity to ride the 1st class
shuttle to the event, and all of you sfravers I met taking ya there (although
i only remember brian darkness and a few people named seth)......

Well, I believe that SF shoudn't be considered for naught... It's just that's
how this generation of SF dj's are spinning.  I remember in the early 90's
when when the beats were more breakbeat with the likes BUCK, JOSH, SPUN,
NOEL, GHOST and others.  But the scene changes as all things do.  I don't
think SF is dull, but what it is doing is creating a niche in the Techno
archives.  In a year or four someone (say Gailen or Ethan) will spin in
detroit, London, Tokyo or wherever, and someone will say, "woha, listen to
that SF style!"
I was brought up and learned to dand to hardcore 160-180 BPM, and I
understnad that my dancestyle can be intimidating but that's the vibe.  As
the music creates the scene too, that's why I tend to feel such unity with my
fellow (and fella) ravers, such warmth and friendship.  
And the next generation will probabaly take us to the next level (I've even
jumped on a pair or turntables in the past week to see what kind of magic I
can create...).  I we can do is wait and see.  Or move across the country.

So hey, happy, trancy, trippy house is sappy.
So shoot me.

Not ducking the drive-by huggings,
Adam....

i was soo glad i was able to make it to this event. the only thing wrong
was i couldn't stay as long as i would have liked....

it was great to be away from the $20 price tags (although i've never
actually paid one...), warehouses overflowing with blinding intelligent
lighting, and parties soo big that somehow the vibe just goes away.

keep it low key.

i found these series of posts rather amusing...:)
being from the midwest and only here for a short while, house is
considered the norm...even though i didn't really care for it, i kinda
ended growing up on it.

take a good look at the scene here. trance, ambient, etc. can be found in
abundence. but you can also find techno (something that was 4 floors a
while back), house (nation), jungle, acid jazz, etc.

this scene HAS variety, it DOES deviate from the norm.
where i go to school, we have one type of music, and only one type (that
being the type you grew up on).

you never find an ambient party. never ever will you see trance. acid jazz
only at clubs, gabber is not even touched (though i haven't heard gabber
here, either).

in my opinion this scene is way more diverse than in the midwest.
although there is always room to get more diverse and offer more (like
gabber), i don't think you can say there is no variety

...which reminded me of the following news item that may be of interest 
to sfravers:


ASSOCIATED PRESS - SAN FRANCISCO

San Francisco Police Chief Fony Riviera held a press conference yesterday 
to reassure the public that a concerted effort is being made by his
department to counter a recent crime wave that has left citizens smiling and 
city officials scratching their heads and pulling out hair.

A worried Riviera told media representatives that police were following 
all available leads in a string of drive-by huggings that have occurred 
during the past several weeks in San Francisco's trendy South-of-Market 
warehouse district.

Official details on the crimes are scant, but victims and witnesses have 
been more forthcoming.  In the most recent attack, Dan Officeguy said he was 
walking on Harrison Street near Third at around eleven o'clock p.m. on June 
27 when he was assaulted.

According to Officeguy, he had little or no warning.  "I heard a car 
pull up, and it was blaring this, I guess you'd call it music, it sounded 
like somebody playing PacMan and banging their fist on the machine." 
Officeguy said he initially paid it no heed.  "You hear these kids with 
their cranked up auto stereos all the time down here," said the 47 
year-old Prolific Bell employee.  "I didn't even bother to look."

The police report filed on the incident says that in the following moments, 
two young women jumped from the back of the vehicle, ran up, and violently 
hugged him.  The intensity of the hugs and the smiling faces that 
accompanied them startled Officeguy, who says he hasn't been hugged since 
he moved here from Chicago seven years ago.  "There were parts of town where 
you had to worry about that sort of thing," he said.  "I never thought it 
would be a problem here."  Still, mused Officeguy, "It was kind of fun."

The two huggers were described by witnesses as white and Latino, probably in 
their late teens or early twenties.  One was said to be wearing a pair of 
baggy overalls decorated with rainbow patches and a large floppy velvet 
hat.  The other was variously described as dressed in what appeared to be 
a furry trenchcoat or rainjacket, and was carrying either a large purse or 
some sort of lunchbox.

Officeguy said one of the girls also tried to kiss him. "I might have 
consented, but she had a sucker in her mouth, and my mom always warned me 
those are dangerous.  A close friend of hers lost an eye once."

Persons at the scene of previous drive-by huggings have reported a 
variety of different suspects, although a young man with a large stuffed 
bee puppet was spotted driving away on two separate occasions.

Although police say no motive has been established for the huggings, 
one inside source who chose to remain anonymous said investigators are 
looking at the city's late-night dance promoters and participants.  "It's 
common knowledge that these parties are going on illegally, and the 
individuals involved have little respect for law and order.  They lure 
kids from the suburbs into seedy after-hours warehouses with colorful 
fliers and get them high on illegal drugs.  Some of them even use fireworks."

Indeed one drive-by hugging victim, who chose to be identified only as 
Beverly, reported that her assailant, a "large black man" wearing a 
t-shirt with the letter "E" emblazoned on it, tried to hand her something 
that may have been a flier for an illegal party. "He stuck something out, 
it was glossy and colorful," she recalled.  "I assumed it was a robbery 
note, so I just threw my purse on the ground and ran."  The purse was 
later retrived intact.

Police reportedly have in their possession fliers left at the 
scenes of several of the drive-by huggings, all of which have occurred in 
the South of Market area known to locals as the city's nightclub 
district.  At one crime scene, officers also discovered a more ominous 
message left by the assailants:  The word P-L-U-R was found carved 
into the sidewalk with large colored chalk.  Lieutenant Clokendager, head 
of the department's juvenile crime division, believes the letters 
represent a warning to rival gangs.  Others are not so sure, however.  
Security at the Federal building on Golden Gate Avenue has been  
increased, and a spokesperson for the FBI said the agency is looking 
into a possible connection to the Unabomber.  City Supervisor Susan Seal has 
responded with a measure that would require minors to be with a parent when 
buying chalk.  Some neighborhood association members and local 
businesspeople are urging her to take up again the issue of the ban on 
dancing after two o'clock a.m. for those under eighteen, and expand it to 
include all ages.  "There's no socially redeeming value to dancing all 
night," said one resident {actual quote from September 1993 City Hall 
hearings on after-hours dancing!}.

San Francisco Mayor Wank Warden, who is currently running for reelection, 
says he is appointing a special commission to look into providing 
alternatives for troubled youths.  Last week the San Francisco 
Chronic-Ill reported that Warden is close to agreement with the Board of 
Supervisors on a drug-testing program for youths apprehended on the 
streets after curfew.  Lackluster Video, which already has mandatory drug 
tests for employees, has offered to help the City develop its program. 

The office of former State Assembly Speaker Sillie Clown, who is among the 
contenders for Warden's job, sent out a fax today charging the mayor with 
lack of leadership.  "Wank Warden is guilty of gross negligence in 
running this city," the release states.  "Arrests of homeless activists 
at Civic Center Plaza are up, while across town, people walk in fear of 
drive-by huggings.  Where are his priorities?  San Francisco needs a 
Sillie Clown in City Hall to introduce some common sense."

In person, Clown was a bit more conciliatory.  "I understand that Wank is 
not entirely responsible here," he told reporters.  "The Republican 
budget cuts are affecting all of us deeply.  If we could only restore the 
funding for midnight basketball, we could get these poor neglected 
children off the streets."

Meanwhile, police have yet to make an arrest, and are advising residents 
and tourists to exercise caution.  "They got my daughter.  You could be 
next," scowled officer Blowhard of the South of Market precinct station.  
"These huggers are armed and dangerous."

Persons interviewed on the street this morning seemed more amused than
alarmed, as did many of the drive-by hugging witnesses and even the
victims themselves.  "It's nothing to get up in arms about," said
city-dweller Chas Glynn, 29.  "Everybody needs a hug now and then," 
agreed his girlfriend, giving him a hug.

In a message dated 95-07-09 15:34:43 EDT, you write:

>changing and evolving

Maybe this is the problem I'm having. 

Like I said in one of my previous replies, some of the reasons I got into
this music and its mode of performance were the sheer diversity of musical
styles that could be heard in one stretch, and that I could go out and hear a
bunch of new music that I'd never heard before. Somehow I got it in my head
that DJs were people who took the time to wade through the myriad releases
from week to week, picking out the best and newest to expose to the fans of
the genre. Promoters find the most cutting edge and put that in a club/party
for you to enjoy and dance to.

I've long suspected that this is not the case at all. That it is based on the
lowest common denominator mechanism that typifies pop music. Is this a
desperate ploy by a scene to perpetuate itself in the face of lagging income
and/or interest? Can a scene that has this approach be considered underground
anymore? In the rave scene, has the word "underground" been reduced to a
substitute for "no flyers" or "illegal"?

The first rave music I heard had lots of energy, lots of techno, lots and 
lots of sound.  I loved how the Dj could play a certain song and change 
the energy level.  People would go crazy over the sounds they were 
hearing.  It made me feel charged, like I could do anything... it was 
lots of energy.  That's how I remember it.

The house music I hear lately makes me feel whole, free,  It touches more 
of the soul.  The DJ then adds energy by the mixing.  Mix different 
feeling sounds together and it's just so powerful.  Makes me want to 
throw my hands up, go "woooo" and all that.  Not many things make me go 
"woooo", unless I'm trying to act cheasey... So if I go "woooo" it must be 
something totally phenomenal.  

Energy by itself is good.  But I'll take mine with alittle "woooo" on the 
side, served up between two thick slices of vibe.

Subject: Re: Happy House Crap

this is exactly the conversation i was dreading to see on this list.  you 
see, i just moved to SF from milwaukee where (as sho mentioned) there is 
lots of hardcore, but there is also a wide variety of other types of 
music as well.  chicago has lots of house and jungle, detroit has its acid 
and everything else is nearby as well.  midwest promoters are into 
bringing in talent from all over.  for example, just last week in dayton, 
OH i saw the UK's system 7 perform and laurent garnier and at the same 
party there were chicago's terry mullan, detroit's john aquaviva, 
pittsburgh's dieselboy and SF's dj dan. now i love going 
to a party and hearing all types of music but the downside is cost.  when 
you have to fly people in from all over the world it's not cheap.  the 
parties will be bigger, more commercial (no, mtv was not there) and more 
expensive (no lack of vibe though!).  but in the midwest that doesn't 
necessarily mean bad, which i 
kinda get the feeling that means here just from previous posts about big 
parties.  i guess that is because the midwest is so spreadout and a big 
party will draw people from every state in the area.  from what i can 
tell so far an advantage for parties here is the smaller size.  i suppose 
if you want a variety of music away from house and trance you will either 
have to travel or bring in different dj's from all over.  anyway, it's 
nice to be in sf and i have plenty of mix tapes of all sorts of dj's if 
anyone wants to broaden their horizons:)

peace,

ellen

I really don't think it is a matter of SF being lame. Because you don't hear
the particular style of music you want at the parties you have been going to
does not mean it is not played anywhere. The people/promoters/djs are playing
what a "majority" of people want to hear, and this "majority" is always
changing and evolving. I have seen more jungle lately, for example. When 
you call a scene lame, you are also insulting the people that make up the
scene, their musical tastes, etc., which when properly done can be good 
thing. Everyone needs to be shaken up now and then. Try offering 
constructive critism, and people may be a little more open to what you 
have to say. Just a suggestion.... And remember, if the grass is greener....

How would you define "happy house"?  In my own view, SF has been
awash with relatively "unhappy" house for the last two years or so,
lots of minor key or downbeat tracks which seem aimed more at getting
some kind of immediate reaction than the more thought-provoking and
phat trax we used to hear.  Like what Monte played at Sunset last week,
that was a big thrill for me, remembering how great acid house and its
near relative styles sound.

Also . . . if you only go hear the most popular DJs at the most publicized
events, you'll get worn down on whatever type of music they prefer (whether
it's "happy house," "gabber handbag" or whatever).  Variety is definitely
the spice of life.

i had this same discussion when i first moved here, jon, and i even 
wrote a story about it for a Houston rave zine..it's on hyperreal and 
the zine is called m-press...point your browser at 
http://hyperreal.com, go to the Texas raves section and the zine is in 
there...i think you'll pretty much agree with what i say in it..

Well I guess this would be as good a time as any to stop lurking and
introduce myself...  Soon Ill be getting to one of these things (Ive
been here for 4 fucking weeks but have no car).  This is something 
that surprised my uninformed person, however.

Im from Pittsburgh PA and as you may have heard the scene there is
picking up in a weird way.  First of all, its been pretty heavy
into what I call the good stuff (hardcore jungle, happy hardcore,
hardcore whatever).  It would seem that a lot of the parties here are much 
more "laid back" which isnt at all what I expected/was looking for.  And
(for me...  I dont have the DJ names and specialties yet) its ruff
to figure out whats gonna be playing at these things.  I have no
problem with parties that play the housey stuff (though I think it
produces the wrong vibe and belongs primarily in the clubs).  It
would be cool tho if some of the heavy stuff was mixed in.

Yes, and as the genre is expanding, several subsets are emerging, and as 
we are all seeing, most DJ's have a tendancy to specialize in one of these
subsets, be it Trance, Happy Hardcore, Ambient, etc. I agree that there 
tends to be much more Trance around S.F. than say, Techno. But this is 
represenatative of both the tastes of the D.J.'s as well as the tastes of the
audience. And there are always alternatives. These parties tend to be 
much smaller as the audience for that particular style is not as 
developed, but they do exist, just look at Derek's weekly list. There is 
now no all-encompassing word that describes (for lack of a better term) "rave"
 music, where as 6-7 years ago there very well may have been.

Hehehe. Ya know, I think that "underground" is one of the most commonly 
misunderstood concepts that exists. For example, the goth scene(which I 
still enjoy now and again.) This is definitely considered underground by 
those involved. Here is a group of people bitching about the blandness 
and sameness of the mainstream, and I still believe that to be correct. 
But what happened? Been to a goth club? What do you have? A bunch of people
dressed the same, listening to the same music they were 10 years ago, 
bitching about "mainstream" commonality. Kinda hypocritical, huh?

I use the above simplified example to illustrate a point. "underground" 
is an oxymoron. When you take numerous people who get into a "sound" or a 
style of music because it diverges from the "mainstream," you now have a group
with common interests and tastes, to varying degrees. While the movement 
may still be considered "underground" in respect to the mainstream 
mindset, continuing to consider what you are doing "underground" when it 
has become a normal part of your existance seems a little delusional. 

D.J.'s like to spin what they want to hear for PEOPLE who want to hear same. 
Promoters(most, with some notable exceptions around here) like to break even, 
which requires a certain amount of people to be at an event. It's all 
about people. If you are so "underground" that no one comes to your 
events, you are going to be a very lonely person indeed....

GB is about 30 years behind America in terms

esteemed, scholarly, and extremely valuable opinion
the greater sense of a gap causes those involved
in subcultures to have a ridiculously inflated

Obnoxious exuberance.

House?  the Norm?  That all depends on exactly 'where' in the Midwest you
are from. If you were in the Chicago are, you probably got a taste of GOOD
FUCKING Paul Johnson style house.  The hard stuff fused with minimal techno
bleep trax (aka Robert Armani, DBX, Armando, etc)  SF Happy House can't
even touch this deep ass house shit.  As far as Detroit goes, we grew up
with Chicago style house as well as local stuff (submerge).  I don't hate
house music, but I guess we were listening to a different kind.

How can you say that!?  You probably didn't check out other scenes in your
area (chicago, Detroit, Cinci, Columbus, Pitt, etc.)

>gabber), i don't think you can say there is no variety

The only place I ever heard gabber was in Milwaukee Wisconsin.  Home of the

Let me just say that this party had about the best organization of any party
I've been to.  I was truly impressed with being guided into the parking area
by flashlights, with my headlights off, and greeted with smiles and warm
energy from all those involved.  

The party "went off".....WELL.  I was most impressed with John Carel, and
Consciousness Lab's Ambient set at the end.  

The location was incredible.  A valley area between two small foot hills
(200 or so feet) next to a small pond.  It was well worth the three hour
drive it took to get there.....well at least til the morning when we found
out the party was a break-in and was on private property.....and the owner
showed up and locked the remaining 15 or so cars, including mine, inside the
gate of his property.....and placed everyone under citizens arrest.....and
made us wait there about an hour or two until the police arrived.....and
took down everyones name address and car registration info.

You should have seen Mr. Owner Man...it was unbelievable.  He was majorly
pissed, which was understandable considering a lock had been cut, and a no
trespassing sign had been removed.  I consider it my own carma for not
heeding the warning as soon as I was told it was a break-in, but the place
was so incredible and I was having such a good time I didn't listen to my
intuition.  I also consider it "me getting my carma" after having the
intuition to move my car off of the property while waiting 15 minutes for
the last member of our group to say goodbye to everyone.  I felt I should
move it and wait outside the gate, but something told me to just sit in the
car and stay put....so I did and that 15 minutes got me busted.  Oh well, I
had alot of fun anyway.

Very Very Very Special Special Thanks go out to Claire for all her work in
organizing such a great party.  And for her agreeing to be arrested on the
spot and take the heat for everyone.  She took full responsibility for
everthing and for any damage created by the party and its goers.  The deal
was arranged with the owner that if she took the heat, everyone else would
be released(although we did have to give our names and stuff, and were
warned we may recieve a warrent to appear in court in Santa Cruz at a later
date).  Ethier way, Claire was very "big" about the whole thing, expressed
piles and piles of "tact" with the understandably assholish owner and the
cops, and deserves much praise IMO. 

A collection was started to help her to pay the fine she will probably be
slapped with.  Hopefully someone with more information on it will post
something to the list.  Law or no law, IMO Claire deserves our help, for
organizing and taking the heat for a wonderful "FREE" party.  Please help
her if an opportunity presents itself.

Love

Rick

Farina, Andre Lucero, Robbie Hardkiss and Charlotte were there + more. It 
was stompy and happy and funky and groovy. Over looking the bay and the 
GG bridge from above, 2 generators,( one for lighting, ) 3 bunkers of  wierdo 
and  friendly chill space (carpeting and plants, art etc). They played music 
which would be called crap by some on this list, BUT I ASK YOU : HOW

And how do you constructively criticize an entire music scene?    I could
do this if i had enough time to think that though completely.  But I guess
I've just been going to some wack parties for the last 4 months.  I have
offered constructive criticism to promoters and DJs, but they don't seem to
care.  People just wanna make a quick buck I guess.  Just like some said,
promoters and DJs only play what the crowd wants to hear.  I remember a
time when DJs would play stuff that they wanted to hear.. thats what made
their set special.  It was music that meant alot to them.  Thats why I look
for in a dj.  What music makes their soul happy..

I remember 2 years ago talking with Mike Huckaby, and Claude Young about DJ'ing
overseas.  They said it was fucked up becuase most DJ's played music that
the crowd wanted to hear, not what they actually liked.  I think it's
better when it just so happens that the type of music that you play moves
you, as well as the crowd.

even Milwaukee isn't hardcore/gabber central anymore.  I just moved to sf 
from living in milwaukee all my life and the last all gabber/hardcore 
party i was at at least a year ago.   DBN isn't focusing as much on 
parties anymore, their record label is their main focus there days.  
infact the only pure gabber dj i can even think of from the midwest is 
dj earache and he isn't even from milwaukee but minneapolis.  other 
milwaukee promoters are trying to get milwaukee out of that hardcore rep 
by bringing in all sorts of styles.  supposedly DBN is gonna throw an all 
hardcore party later in the summer but i will believe that when i see it.

Let's not let this degenerate into a "my music is better
than yours" contest.  Let's look at the main issue, which is
diversity.

I'm sure we can all appreciate different musical styles.  I
can groove on techno, house, trance, jungle.. even gabber.
I remember dancing to Lenny Dee at Earth in Milwaukee, and
the intensity was incredible.

Be that as it may, we all have a primary focus.  In my case,
it's techno.  Your love might be something completely
different.  

When we feel that our favorite musical style is
underrepresented, what we should do is to work to bring as
much diversity into the scene as we can.. throw small
undergrounds, pass out tapes, talk to people and find people
who share your vibe.  It's not about trying to change
people's minds.  It's about trying to share your passion
with other people and exposing people to new sounds.

Let promoters know that you crave diversity.  And back up
your words by keeping your minds open to other types of
music.  If you are into trance, go check out the acid jazz
scene.  If you are into ambient, listen to some hard acid
every once in awhile.  There is a lot of good music out
there, and there is no need to close yourself off.

Peace,

-Sho

Went down to S.C. Sat. for Moonlight - well worth the trip. Probably the
best party music format I've seen - ambient beginning, up to dance, and
back to ambient in the morning. Removes pressure on the first DJ to get
people to dance and gets everyone in the proper mood so that when the beats
come in everyone's up and grooving.

It was on some sort of farm with a pond right nearby (I hope those who swam
in it don't catch any weird diseases) and a beautiful view of the stars.
All of the music was spot on. I particularly enjoyed John Carel's set - I
hadn't heard him before. Minor played some great techno, almost turning me
into a trainspotter for much of his set. Monty followed in his inimitable
pumpin' acid house style and Tracy continued with a great energetic house
set. John Carel was the last DJ and brought things back into trance until
the ambient DJ trio took over with lovely winding down music.

Unfortunately the owner of the property showed up in the morning and was
extremely displeased with the situation. Evidently he knew nothing of the
party and the lock on his gate had been cut and No Trespassing signs
removed. Ahh, a bit risky. He called the cops and locked everyone in - he
wasn't interested in any payment and wanted someone in jail. The police
were a bit more rational and ended up citing Claire for criminal trespass
and something else and didn't detain her. They took down identifying
information on everyone there saying there was a slight chance we could all
be proscuted for trespassing. Ouch. We were stuck there for about 2 hours
after the party ended.

Looks like the next party will be a benefit for the costs of this last one.

I've long suspected that this is not the case at all. That it is based on the
lowest common denominator mechanism that typifies pop music. Is this a
desperate ploy by a scene to perpetuate itself in the face of lagging income
and/or interest? Can a scene that has this approach be considered underground
anymore?In the rave scene, has the word "underground" been reduced to a
substitute for "no flyers" or "illegal"?

Definitely something to think about.   This whole thread reminds me of the
transformation that the word "alternative" went through a few years ago...

Well,   after having been to Australia for 3 months,  I come back and
discover more trance parties (IE:  Freq-8,  6th house,  etc).   Then I
go to the DV8 when the Germans were in town and actually hear the same
Happy Hard Core songs I heard in Australia,   I'm beginning to think
that there is nope for the SF scene.   But there is always room for more
variaty,  thats for certain.

I don't think it is possible to constructively criticize an entire scene,
but it is very easy to damn the whole thing :) . I guess you have to do it
on an event by event basis. There are some really shitty, greedy 
promoters out there who are out to make that fast buck. But that is not 
the sum of things. Take Friends & Family, Pacific, and Cloud Factory. Always
free, or VERY reasonably priced, nice people, nice vibes, and some great 
music(IMO.) I don't know what parties you have been to in the past four
months, but I have always had a good time at anything thrown by the above
crews. 

In regards to constructive critism of events, if the promoters and D.J. 
don't seem to care, screw 'em and move on, it is probably not somewhere 
you want to be. I really believe that many D.J.'s are still playing what 
they want to hear. Isn't it possible for this to coincide with what 
people want to hear? If a D.J. is spinning stuff that he likes, and the 
crowd also likes it, you really can get a synergistic effect, as I am sure
you have seen at one time or another.

You are absolutely correct and I should have stressed this more in my 
original response. But remember this thread all resulted from your 
observation that there is not a lot of diversity in the S.F. scene, which
may or may not be true, depending on what events one has been to, and 
your idea of diversity. In your statement you said that no one plays 
techno around here. Is it possible that at the parties you have been to, 
that the D.J.'s are indeed playing what they, as well as the crowd want 
to hear, and it just happens that this does not include techno? So if a 
D.J. were to play techno because you wanted to hear it, and not because 
they wanted to spin it, wouldn't that go against our shared opinion of 
what and why a D.J. should spin? Questions, not meant sarcastically.

top 40, experimental, breakbeat, hardcore, punk, hip-hop, trip-hop, acid
house... sets?  i understand that many of the larger events i have played

it's really very interesting for me to hear how other people classify
my "style".  i'm curious how other people would describe the music that
i play.

Hmm.  While I admire her tact and willingness to take the heat so others 
can avoid trouble, I don't see breaking and entering itself as something 
that should be recognized, let alone lauded.  As someone who spent a lot 
of time way back when scouting for places to throw outdoor parties, I 
know that such spaces are indeed rare, but they are out there.  As for 
private property - some property owners just might say yes if you asked 
them nicely (or perhaps paid a fee or something).  I know many 
anarchists/socialists out there dismiss the notion of "owning land", and 
while I strongly sympathize, I think it's unfair to draw unwitting 
participants into the battle....

Anybody going to Massive Attack at the Fillmore, July 13? R There still
tix available? Got a spare? I haven't heard their latest album, 'cept
for that so-so soulicious-chanteuse-house song they keep playing on
live 105. I do like their first album, however, and most people seem to
dig the massive attack remix of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan (sp?) Musst
Musstt (sp? anybody got a kleenex?*-)).

I do like Tricky (Tricky Kid, or whatever) as a singer/rapper.
Recently, I've seen him listed as a solo performer. Does this mean is
he no longer part of "Massive Attack"?

Let me know whassup with this show/tour, or at least warn me if you 
think it's a waste of time and money, or if you think this show is the
synaesthetic manifestation of the goddess herself.... I'm gonna check
the tix situation 'inna bit.

Thanks!

Sp8tr!

That was just my opinion cuz I was there and felt really bad for her even
though she chose to break the law by cutting the lock and not preinforming
everyone.  Knowone has to help if they don't want to or feel they are a part
of it, but I'm sure that goes without saying.  Even though I didn't know
about the break-in til late in the game, I still feel I was a part of
it.....so I piched in.

Thank You to all the fun loving people that came out to our Sat. night party.  
Without everyone's teamwork the party wouldn't have worked.  We are already 
busy planning the next "light" party and look forward to seeing everyone out.  
I must apologize to those of you who were detained at the end of the party.  It
was very trying to be so tired and have to deal with such a sad situation.  We 
have learned a great deal from this experience!  The court date has been set 
for August 31st and a copy of the police report will be posted as soon as I get
the case report and formal charges from the DA.  I do not believe anyone
else will face charges. (The owner only seems to want revenge on me-)We are 
not discouraged but more determined to not get caught. He-he!  Any
suggestions or possible locations anyone would have will happily be taken.
A special thank you to Harmony who worked getting all the cars into the party 
quickly and efficiently!   Despite  the unfortunate last two hours, we hope
everyone enjoyed the energy, and beauty of the gathering itself. (We sure
did!)  See you soon! FEEL IT- LOVE!

who said the san francisco scene is lame?  who said it has no diversity?
i have only been here for a month i know, but in that time i have been
completely blown away!  don't take what you have for granted.  over the 
last four years i have raved all over the east coast, from new york to
atlanta (i have to say i've never made it to rollando) to chicago and 
just about everywhere in between, but i have never seen any place that 
compares to here.  
if music is the center of our scene, what is it that we aren't getting 
here?  sure, it's mostly house here, but in the time i've been here i have
heard just about everything else.  whoever thinks baltimore and new york
have better scenes needs to go check them out.  160-180+bpm all the time
gets boring as hell, no matter how much you like it (and i love it!), and
god knows people in the southeast have no idea what acid jazz/trip hop is.
don't get me wrong, we have diversity, too.  just before i left there was
a jungle party in d.c. - now i love jungle, too, but jesus, jungle all
night long  |b .  in one night here i have heard more variety than in months
of partying there.  don't get me wrong, i've heard some phat tunz everywhere
- fever (in baltimore) had flashback just before i left with old tracks
from the storm/catastrophic raves ... ahhh, flashback time again - but 
some of the ones i hear here just don't compare.  my friends told me that
Carlos (when he played in Va.) was the best dj they'd ever heard, they 
say when Dubtribe played a few weeks ago people were crying with joy and
holding their heads, and the best party i ever went to in the southeast
had Galen and Robbie Hardkiss headlining.  san francisco may be mostly 
house, but it's the best house in the world, and i, at least, haven't had
to look too far to find other stuff, and i haven't had to drive 6 hours for
it either!
a lame scene, huh?  i have never seen any other place where people from
four generations gather together on a sunday afternoon just to get down and 
watch the sunset in the park (try that in baltimore!).  sure, music is
crucial, but so are the people, and the people here are some of the best and
brightest i've ever met.  here i tell people at parties i study physics and
get responces like, oh really, i'm an engineer, or i'm a chemist or an
artist, or whatever.  my friends and i even talked about shakespeare with
a caltrain conductor.  try that in the southeast (even try to find a
train).  diversity!  every time i go out i come home thinking i have never 
seen any place as beautiful as where i've just been - frequency8 this weekend,
for example, or berkely marina for sunset - and then the next week i go out 
again and say the same thing!  
this ain't no lame scene!  this is the most magical place i have ever seen.
if you're not getting what you want, then maybe you're in the wrong scene, or
maybe you just want to bitch.  either way, it's cool.  there's space here
for everybody.  and i certainly haven't been everywhere and done everything,
so maybe there is something better somewhere else.  more probably it's just
a matter of perspective.  whatever.  but this place definately IS NOT lame!
and thanks to all of you who make it the way it is.

peace!
seth

Nope, the next Light party will also be free! (on public property!)  Many
thanks to those of you who contributed to the bail/fine fund.  That was very
cool.  If anyone should know an attorney that would be willing to give some
good advice on illegal trespassing, feel free to refer them to us.  Thank
you again everyone!

i think that this discussion is wavering. the topic is the *music* in
the scene, and not the scene itself. for some of us, the music is
everything, and it defines the scene. i love that fact that the scene
here is so vibrant and prolific and, well, big, but out of 6-10 parties
every night, i have to struggle to pick *three* out of a *month* that
look really good to me, parties where not only am i excited about the
lineup and the party itself, but where i know i'm going to have a good
time, because i know that i'm going to like the music there. If the
music ain't there, then man, i'm *bored*. i went to alot of parties when
i first moved here and the more money i spent and the more often i went
out, the more dissappointed i was. I went to see the orb earlier last
month and now the next party i'm looking forward to is the next Area 51.
Nothing else i've seen really turns me on. For instance. Went to United 
last month. coupled with the fact that 1)i'm 21 and i was one of the 
oldest people there (yes, i'm an over 18 facist) and 2)it was in 
Pittsburg (!), the music was flat out *boring*. Thank God Dan was on 
the bill...he saved my evening from being completely wasted. So as you 
see...great vibes are simply not enough for people like Jon and I (and 
others)...

> Excuse me? When was the last time you had a look in my crate?
> 
or mine...or heard my latin house, happy house, funk, retro, new wave,
top 40, experimental, breakbeat, hardcore, punk, hip-hop, trip-hop, acid
house... sets?  i understand that many of the larger events i have played
at i've played largely acid trance, but that's hardly my entire repetoire.

What's up with the litany of "styles"?   Does it really matter how many a DJ
can fit into his set? Does this impress anyone?  Shouldn't the quality of the
music, (IF it's of any quality), and it's ability to move people be the only
things that matter, not what "flavor" it happens to be, and whether or not
the night's diversity quota is being met?   I don't know if this is of much
relevance, but I was at a party friday night, (Climax).   Overall, it was one
of the best parties I've ever been to.   The space was great, the size was
nice, the vibe excellent.   I pretty much spent the night in the upstairs
room, listening to a bunch of Breakbeat.    It was THE SHIT!  The DJ's were
moving the crowd, people really seemed to be enjoying themselves, and the
music really didn't change much while I was there.    So I guess my point is,
(relevant or not) that as long as the tunes are good, it doesn't really
matter if some DJ is trying to move from "tribal acid funk" to "ambient
gabber didgeridoo"...

it's really very interesting for me to hear how other people classify
my "style".  i'm curious how other people would describe the music that
i play.

 I'm curious why people get so caught up in the naming and labeling game?
 Just play good music, that you like.   Any DJ that plays to please,
(pandering) to a crowd, belongs at weddings and birthday parties.   If you
don't like what the DJ plays, then go somewhere else.   If that somewhere
else doesn't exist yet, then do something about it.  Obsessing over
categories and styles can make people lose sight of the important things.
  But, to add my .02, I like all sorts of things I hear around here, as long
as they're short on piano riffs and divas.

I think what you said is all fine.. personally growing up in the same place
as jon and all I agree mostly with him.
There is nothing wrong with the scene here it is just different than what we
are use to and what we like .
It has also been hard for use to adjust to the scene here because we were
both a big part of the Ds scene...and  we try and go out to parties with Alex
 and have fun sometimes.. we do.. but I know for me I am only going because I
cant really be where I want to be.(and I like hangin with Alex!)

Would anyone go to a techno/chicago house party in SF if someone threw one??
 I have ideas and plans I just want to see what kind of response there might
be...... ........

later,

I think what you said is all fine.. personally growing up in the same place
as jon and all I agree mostly with him.
There is nothing wrong with the scene here it is just different than what we
are use to and what we like .
It has also been hard for use to adjust to the scene here because we were
both a big part of the Ds scene...and  we try and go out to parties with Alex
 and have fun sometimes.. we do.. but I know for me I am only going because I
cant really be where I want to be.(and I like hangin with Alex!)

Would anyone go to a techno/chicago house party in SF if someone threw one??
 I have ideas and plans I just want to see what kind of response there might
be...... ........

later,
nm
(imho....  when it comes to house there is nothing like ChiTown house!!)

I agree fully with this.  I was living with a DJ buddy of mine for nearly
two years and he happens to be one of the best (in my humble opinion) dj's
going among the lesser-known folks here in Vancouver (fellow canucks - DJ
oliver!).  He NEVER plays the same "label" of music all through a set - he
grabs all sorts of stuff that sounds good and moves your feet and heart and
makes you grin and bounce.  That's the kind of DJing I like the best.

Not to say that "styles" of DJing don't have their place (whenever they
play jungle I get a chance to sit down and chill ... *shudder*) .... but I
think it SHOULD be less important then the kind of VIBE that's created.

you're missing the point. bryce and ethan took offense to the labels 
that were put on them, and came to their defense that they spin 
everything. it wasn't a snooty thing. it was a correction thing.

yes, i see your point. also, reading over my last message, it sounds like
i say that there is only one kind of music in the midwest. what i wanted
to say was the scene is much more diverse here.

but don't lose hope, otherwise nothing will ever change.

I said SF was 'kind of lame'. I still have fun at parties where the music
sucks.  Maybe I am in the wrong scene.  Its a great city, theres tons of
parties, theres acid jazz, house, trance, disco, hip hopp, jazz hip jazz,
salsa, blues, grunge whatever...

But theres no gravity.

Do you know what I mean by that?
I guess not.

Actually, My girlfriend Nancy Mitchell and I are working on trying to get
something going in SF.  We promoted parties in the Detroit scene for a few
years before I moved here.  I have tried working with a few promoters and,
not many of them were willing to try something different.

All I have to say about having other promoters clue us in is.. ha ha ha :)
(not likely, we've tried).  Who knows... We may pull something off soon!


oh.. and I'm not SF bashing.  I'm 'SFravescene in its current state' bashing :)

After rereading my post I see the part about "opening your eyes" sounds kind

well, i guess you missed freq 8, which was a fantastic absolute 
blast, from the music, to the people, to the sun coming up as
we were still dancing like maniacs, then walking out and checking
out the light pastels playing over the ocean.  the scene is still
there, and the parties are still there, you just need to pick
your spots.

I hate this, I hate that, I'm tired of this, I'm tired of that, I was just
making an observation this, I was just noting that, I really meant to say this,
no what I really meant was that..... arrgh!!

I am sick of people sniping my city for stuff they have easy control over...

You don't like happy house eh?  Try any of the clubs or parties that don't
specialize in a genre then.  Techno is hard to find, but there are PLENTY of
people who still play it (I say still since I have gone through *my* techno faze).

try out the many DJ's here on the list who play that type of music.
The same can be said of acid or house or garage or whatever.

SF has one of *the* most diverse music scenes I've seen in a long time.  Yeah,
there are areas that are lacking in certain styles of music, but if you look
hard enough, or just ask "Hey, I wanna hear some techno, where do I go?" I'm
sure the 300+ memebers of SFRAVES would steer you in the right direction.

If you *still* don't find what you're looking for, the start a gig yourself.
All it takes is time, and some money.

SF = Hip-Hop, Trip_hop, Jazz, Acid Jazz, House, Garage, Techno, Deep, Ambient,
Raggae, Rock, Soul, Funk, Fusion, Punk, Hardcore, Gothic, etc. etc. etc.

I do wish people would live here long enough to sample the flavors before 
mouthing off about how so and so ain't all *they* expected so and so to be.

And if it ain't there...CREATE IT!

I'm outta here,
John

P.S.  I *LOVE* SF!!!!  And so do most of the 750,000+ residents.  I think there
is a reason people continue to move here.  The various scenes being a part
of that factor.

Much Peace.

Dear All;

	This weekend, one took the heat for many. I would like to offer 
my suppport, love, advice, & services to Claire & Gateway. Such unselfish, 
selfless, actions should never go unanswered. Actions like this must be 
the rule of our scene rather than the exception. We as a group of kind 
people are only as splittered as our intolerance for one another, 
selfcenterness, & selfishness.

	If you've ever had a brush with the crimial punishment in-justice 
system, it really sucks, trust me. Take the inititive to tell your 
friends who were there, who aren't connected via the net, that help and 
support are needed for a wonderful, caring, & selfless person, who saw to 
it that they had a wonderful time on Saturdaynight at Moon Lite. Make it 
your responsibility to make sure that those services and support reach 
Claire or Gateway. Our scene is my responsibilty, I hope you feel the 
same way.

Dear Claire & Gateway;

	I almost forgot, your unselfish actions just earned you a free
full body massage from me(bout 70 minutes, and is transferable to another
person of your choice if so desired), at a location & time of your choice.
I'm sure you will need it after all this is said and done. See ya :)!!!!!!

I don't like happy house carp. ALl they ever do is swim around in
listless circles, gobbling up floating fish pellets like there's no
tomorrow. Sometimes they'll suck yer finger when you stick it in the
water, if yer lucky, and that's it. Pointless glimmers of light in a
murky indoor pond. That's why I like happy house carp.

why is it so difficult for some people on this list to accept the fact 
that not all of us think it's the best place on earth?

there are pockets here and there of people playing harder styles of
music...but usually they're either difficult to find, or in a case like
this: ex, why zee threw a party and joey beltram was one of the
headliners. unfortunately the party was like $25 and the promoters were
not (and still aren't as their track record has proved) something i'd
want to spend $25 on. I mean...I personally would like to see more
Imported dj's....for a city with such a world class reputation i don't
think we see this nearly as much as we should...in addition to the
hometown talent in places like the UK you get foreign dj's all the time
at clubs...all the detroit pioneers, alot of new york dj's, people like
josh wink, laurent garnier, darren emmerson, (we even had justin
robertson here back in January...)

my point is, and has been, that there isn't enough harder music. 
ask Dutch, who is on this list, and who is one of my favorite dj's 
here. He's immersed int he scene and i'm sure he'll tell you the same 
thing. This is one reason why i'm looking forward to area 51. 
christophe, dutch, and carlos have delivered in the past and i'm almost 
guaranteed to have a good time at this party. i can't wait. 

i don't think this discussion can go anywhere else. I don't mean to put
down SF because i love it here....this just one thing bugs me and makes
me dissatisfied. especially because of the expectations i had when i
came here - do most of you know the reputation this city has in the rest
of the country? in the summer of '93 you couldn't go to a single party
without someone spinning the 'sf sound' or some big SF hit, how san
francisco was kicking it seriously live, how amazing the whole scene
was...and you come here and it's like the music hasn't really progressed
from '92, it's still 125 bpm acid house. the scenes in the east and
midwest went through slow breaks, hard acid, hardcore, progressive
house, gabber in places, happy breaks and jungle, the old-school
revival...yet here, if you want to party every weekend, you get house. 
before moving here i didn't think i'd ever look back, but i keep 
yearning to go to a party back in baltimore, or even Pittsburgh - or 
better yet, to bring the dj's and music *here*, to bring the parts that 
are missing into the picture to make it whole for me....

because if it's one thing that SF's got going for it, and going for it 
*bigtime*, it's the vibe.

freaky chakra and single-cell orchestra

Next time you plan to destroy private property for a party, please
put it on your flyer and phone message.  I like being aware of when
I'm about to participate in blatant criminal activiy.

Cool World usually has the emotional intimacy equivalant of paying $20 to 
hang out in a shopping mall for the evening.  

You're right about a few of the DJ's. Mark E Quark's a pretty neat one 
that I hope will have the opurtunity to spin at some smaller local gigs 
while in town. 

If so, check it out.

Hey all,

Moonlight was by far the best party I have ever been to.  It was so 
beautiful.  Not just the 2 million stars, or the gorgeous hillsides, or 
the awesome music, but the people.  WOW!  What a vibe.  I was so 
overwhelmed by it all that I lost my head and freaked for hours.  I met 
some amazing people and truly danced like I never have before.  Purly 
tribal.  Throwing my arms in the air and losing all inhibitions.  I 
could go on forever about this party and how perfect it was but if you 
didnt go then you better check out claire and gateway's next party.  
She truly is a visionary who knows what raving is really about.  

I also can say that any of us who had to deal with the owner, especialy 
the people who put the pary on, would do it all again without a second 
thought.  It was just so amazingly beautiful.

love chris

p.s.  thanks to brian phudge for some powerful (sober) energy and rick 
riffle for a ride (we should get more connected since we both live in 
Sac.).

And now, a message from Dorena,


I have never felt so much love from a group of people than at Moonlight 
this past saturday might.  The happiness that surrounded me was so 
overwhelming, and yeah the ecstasy I took helped too.  I was overcome 
with so much joy from the beauty of the people, the music and the 
scenery.  Pure beauty.  It were as if this party belonged in this 
valley, everything was so in synch,...just powerful.  For those of you 
who didn't make it, make sure that you make it next time!  We were a 
complete family, sharing our energy.

Everywhere I looked there was a smile in front of my face, I even think 
that the mountains were smiling down upon us!!  Although we came upon 
some negativity from the property owners, our positive attitude and 
outlook made everything go very smoothly and hopefully everything works 
out well in the end for claire and gateway.  And it will!

Bye bye, Dorena :)

  Goddamn, Moonlight was one to remember!  A heart-stoppingly gorgeous spot,
lovely weather, excellent music, a wonderful crowd of 150-200some people, and
just enough foresight and organization to prevent it from getting busted.
 All respects to all involved.
  Schedule-wise, I had the best opening spot you could ask for.  By 2:30 AM,
Consciousness Labs had everyone primed and ready to rock.  And everyone there
was so enthusiastic, it felt likethe records were just mixing themselves.
 Here's what I played:

2:30 AM
-------
TAGC - Magnesia
Bhasmantan - Black Hills
Pob - The Essence
Darin Marshall - 7th Hour
Holy Ghost - Mad Monks on Zinc
Mole People - Break Night
Dj Skull - Maximum Waveform
Mike Dearborn - Destruction
Skin Deep - Body to Body
Random Generator - Zone Paging
Blue Minds - Push
Atomik Locator - Overdose
Holy Ghost - Heavy Water
Claude Young - Concentration Factor
Outerealm - Welcome to the Storm
Hole in One - Gateway
Nigel Richards - Philadelphia Acid Experiment V2
Jam & Spoon - My First Fantastic FF
Pump Panel - Remover
Chemical Bros. - Leave Home (Underworld mix)
Psilocybin - Delicate Substance
Retrofit - Helium Bubble
Locker - 7 Deadlies
-----
4 AM

  I'm playing at the 8th House this Thursday, the 13th. (415-487-5436) is the
voicemail, it's on 1190 Folsom, by 8th, 21+ and $5 cover.  I'm going to bring
the wildest most fucked-up techno I've got, so if that's your thing, please
come!

Yes. And some police officers might also agree to be passionatly
hugged on street, under the same above mentioned conditions. Law
abiding and respect for private property should be the first
preconditions for a respectable rave. Last but not least, to emphasize
our commitment to legality, we should consume lots of Anheuser-Busch
beer all the time.

On a more serious side, I actually wondered how the SF party system
manages to survive without even collecting contributions for the
finest parties, while letting you get quite easily on the guest list
for others (thanks ameba!). This is a scene with genuinely great
moments, and one should take care that neither money nor a shortage of
it spoils it.

Perhaps someone can tell me how to "pitch in" now, for Moonlight in
trouble.

I love SF.  BUT, the music (not the scene...the MUSIC) is my least 
favorite.  I don't dis it..but I'm telling you, I like the music out east 
orders of magnitude better than I do here.  And it also seems that many 
people out here just don't understand constructive criticism.  No one has 
flamed the music here from what I've read...but they've been flamed for 
expressing dissenting opinions.  So, just lie down on the floor and keep 
calm...everything will be ok.  It's not the end of the world if someone 
doesn't like the same things you do.

Dear Brian, Lee & All;

	I care about & like both of you very much, we talked via e-mail
often, and I still care about & look forward to exchanging our feelings,
thoughts, and ideas. I respectfully, however disagree with the level of
navievity present at Moon Lite with regard to the break in. For people at
the rave, at least when they arrived and were present for a while, were
indeed very aware that this was a break in, and that we didn't have
permission to be there. Gateway didn't try and hide it, & were quite open
about it, for most of the people I talked with were aware of it, and if
they had a problem, had the option to leave once they got the news. 

	A message to all would be, if the people say that it's a break in,
take them seriously if you have a problem with that. 

	I stayed to pretty much the end, in fact I missed being one of the
people who got caught by about 15 - 30 minutes. I guess I inherited my
mother's, better than an AWACS survailence plane's radar, intution. I
enjoyed the party, helped out, had the knowledge, and am a co-conspiritor
by the laws defination and am just as responsible & accountable for the
consequences as the promoters. I feel that if you fall into that
defination, and if one is selfless enough to bear the brunt of the
consequences & shared responsibility, that they should be supported no
matter what, not that Brian's saying that we shouldn't support her. 

	In fact, my after feeling and wish is that we all would have said
that yes, I'm guilty, take us all to jail, and let them deal with the
impact to their punishment in-justice system. They would have had gotten a
bus, and I bet they would have talked with the farmer & never sited any of
us, cause we all no how police hate paper work, and that's 50x paperwork. 

	Tresspassing on so called private property which when you really
look at it, is just rented from the government. Anyone who pays property
tax and doesn't believe that is a fool, I dare you to stop paying your
property tax and see how quickly you lose "your" land. The crime of
tresspassing is just not that serious of a crime, it's at best a minor
infraction, and am surprised that she was even taken in to a jail where 
criminals are present.

	However this was a party, a rave by it's true defination, as I
understand it, and am sure I will be corrected by someone else's
defination, as they understand it(sarcasum present). I don't thing it was
a statement about the state of landownership in America, less I'm the
naieve one. It's about us, our music, our scene, our love for one another,
we who are made up of individuals, for we are the most diverse group of
kind people goin, and we will show the world that we shine, by our
individual actions in our group effort. 

	I remember when womyn would tresspass at the Senaca Weapons Depot,
in New York for the purpose of protesting Nuclear Weapons. Our actions are
a protest against the system thats said's we have to have a permit to have
a party, which in my opinion is against our constitutional right of
assembly, perhaphs it would have been better to hold the party illegally
in a public park, or government facility, and let them arrest us by
refusing to leave, as the generations before us did, maybe we need to make
our political agenda clearer by having protest parties where we make our
political ideas and statements clearer. I feel we would be much more
sucessful at doing this cause, we are connected world wide by the net,
unlike our 60's counterparts, but unlike them rave is not a national
movement, it's a worldwide movement don't ever doubt that for second. 
Remember that the people in power thought the younger generation was
disrespectful of the government when they pulled stuns like this &
protested nukes, war, hunger, gay liberation, racial & sexual equalality,
I think they called us "commie, pinko, fag, junkies" freaks, by any other
name. 

	For me it's about personal liberty, and the fact that today the
powers to be are tring to systematically take away your presonal freedom &
liberty, with more & more government restrictions, at every level. We've
had a lot more restrictions, then constitutional amemdendts garenteeing us
personal liberty, and I think it's about time for some new amendments to
that document so we can bring it into the 21st century.

	Lee, I got your post late, I don't remember seeing you there,
never the less. We all particpate in illegal activities; everytime we lite
up, drop, take #, it's illegal, and our government considers those a lot
more serious than tresspassing on private property. Remember Lee that
there's a war on drugs out there with a DEA. I don't remember a war on
tresspassing however. I was there and there was no descruction of private
property, I don't think she was cited with that. It wasn't a $10,000 lawn
on an estate either, it's where pigs graze, get real.

I think a lot of DJs only like music that the crowd will like - no division,
they aren't "holding back" at all.

Dear All;

	One final statement/question, if one/group of us throws a party
and is cited/fined/jailed by the powers to be for something relating to
the throwing of that party, and we fail to support or go as far as to even
shun/chastise that person/group, who will throw parties then, and will 
anyone be able to afford them? We either stand as a group, taking the 
good with the bad, or the only people throwing parties are going to be 
the clubs. Cause after this I would be kinda scared to throw a party, in 
fear that I would be judged, and left out in the cold, if something went 
wrong.

	I remember when F&F were cited by the powers to be, for something as 
unhinkable as assult on a police officer, and in the fire departments 
judgement we were in extreme danger due to overcrowding. I don't remember 
one anyone judging Ethan & Company, all I remember was a thread of 
nothing but support. Something to think about.

	All we have is each other, please don't forget that, else there 
is no scene, no PLUR, it must start with us, we are human, we make 
mistakes, and to forgive goes behond being human. Careful he who judge, 
less you be judged yourself.

ah yes but there was discussion of the problems and no one disregarded 
the fact that is was overcrowded and that another event like thhat had to 
be avoided at all costs  (spealing of the problems)...

I tend to be choosey about the laws I break.  And there are even some
laws, depending on how they are presented to me, that I respect.  If I
had driven the 1.5 hours to Santa Cruz to find out that a lock was
broken and a No Trespassing sign had been torn down on some guy's
property, I would have been pissed.  It's not the law-breaking as much
as the total disrespect for the owner's wishes.  I have no problem with
a party that trespasses, cleans up after itself, and leaves the land as
it was found.  

>  It wasn't a $10,000 lawn

The fact that the farmer earns his living from those pigs means nothing
to you, I guess.  

Also: this farmer will surely tell his land-owning friends to be on
the lookout for trespassers now.  And the Santa Cruz police will share
the story with their peers; not of a bunch of innocent kids just making
too much noise, but of a blatant, in-their-face, intentionally
criminal act.  I'm sorry, but the only PeaceLoveUnityRespect that
happened at this party was with ourselves.  I'm glad everyone had a
good time.  I'm glad I wasn't there.

i think discretion though is necessary to keep the long arm of the
law and authorities at bay, and out of our raving faces.  this is
best accomplished by keeping things as underground and out of sight
as possible.  freq 8 was a wonderful fab time, and attracted the 
attention of no one.  i think an effort should be made to stay off
private land, and not attract attention of the law, cause with that
attention, comes increased awareness and restrictions and busts and
crackdowns.

i also dont agree with associating political or anarchic agendas with
raves.  i rave cause in the presence of the dance and company, comes
a seperation of my mind that brings about a complete unawareness of
my body and mind physical.  i has very little to do with promoting
any political agenda.  the ability to do this is put at risk by 
confronting the authorities.  i dont think confronting the authorities
is necessary if extreme care and discretion are used to pick outdoor
sights.

	Lee, your initial statement was about destruction of private
property, If we had brought a bull dozer or two then we could call it
descruction of private property. There was nothing a group of 200 people
could do to that land, unless there was intenetion to destory it, by
occupling it and dancing on it, for less than 5 hours. The fact that the
farmer earns his living off that land has nothing to do with it, it wasn't
damaged. You remind me of my neighbors growing up who wouldn't let there
children play on the lawn.

	So, the police have been busting parties down there since I can 
remember, nothing new to the Santa Cruz police. Distubing the peace is a 
blantant, premeditated crime Lee, a crime is a crime is crime. To a 
District Judge, at this level, and to the police there all misdearmeanors.

	I wish you were there, than you mite be able to comment on this 
event actuately, and with some real prespective, other than 2nd hand hear 
say. Not what I expect from someone on staff at hyperreal.com, I'm 
disappointed Lee. For someone who said's Gateway wasn't responsible, how 
bout some responsible rethoric. It reminds me of the critic who used to 
review the movies without going to them.

I suppose we could take a poll, but it didn't sound like that from the 
people who had posted.

I disagree that someone who martyrs themselves on crosses of their own 
making (sorry for the strong language) deserve support.  I'm sure it was 
a fantastic party, really - but I'm also sure that the fantastic-ness had 
very little to do with the fact that it was a break-in.  

There used to be this implicit code of ethics when you threw a party - 
this was a very strong set of ethics, and to me it was what made the 
scene as vibrant and *peaceful* as it has been for 4 years now.  And when 
that code gets violated, the trust between party-thrower and part-goer is 
hurt, and that's a bitch to try and build back.  

To make people unwitting participants in a misdemeanor is just
unacceptible.  In our "three strikes you're out" world this puts them 33%
closer to a long time behind bars, particularly if they're already on
parole, and what for?

Tell that to the crowd at 15th and Guerrerro the other night.  The police 
were more than happy to haul them all off.

It's a misdemeanor, or a felony if you're on parole.  And despite utopian 
visions of what repetitive beats do for the terra, there was certainly 
potential for lots of property damage to occur.

*Exactly*.

Look, the question isn't even one of whether throwing unauthorized parties
on private land is an appropriate method for protesting land ownership. 
That doesn't matter.  The question is - what right does the promoter of a
party have to put their unwitting party attendees at serious legal risk?

OK, now just so everyone isn't confused, let's set this straight.  If
there is anyone who can play "Happy House," it's me, because I just
bought the "Once Upon a Time" compilation album of singles by Siouxsie
and the Banshees (a longtime favorite of mine).  I will gladly play
the track "Happy House" from that LP on demand :-)

Yes, because if I can make a distinction between people who Do The Right 
Thing and Do The Wrong Thing when it comes to throwing a party, then I 
can definitely choose who deserves my respect and support and who doesn't.
As long as there are enough promoters doing things right (which there 
are!) then we'll have a healthy economy of parties.

I distinctly remember threads about how people felt unsafe in the 
building.  I was genuinely worried as well - when I felt the upstairs 
floor give a couple of inches with every beat, I got *very* concerned.
F&F learned from it - and I think Claire will learn from this too.

Ultimately this gets down to: what are *your* fundamental goals when it 
comes to "raving"?  If it's just to get really sorted and have a good 
time without ending up in too much trouble, sure, a breakin is probably 
alright.  But if you'd like to see the memes and mindset perpetrate into 
other parts of our world, if you'd like to see as many other people as 
possible get a clue as to what this is about, and if you'd like to be 
able to have fun at the same time, then it requires a slightly more 
mature perspective on the planning and execution of the events.  Wouldn't 
be a wonderful world if the owner came out in the morning, saw what was 
going on, and joined in dancing?  Hell yes!  Are you going to accomplish 
that by cutting his locks?  Hell no!

'Nuff said.

One final comment - at a couple of the full moon parties and other outdoor
undergrounds I've been the one to go up to the cops and say "hello
officer, we're just having a party, here's my ID, you can check this out
if you like, just a bunch of kids having fun" etc.... and for a large
percentage of the cops, it flat out worked.  Honesty is indeed the best
policy at times.  "No booze, officer, maybe some pot here and there but
this is SF after all..."  And you know what?  After a few rounds of this,
I realized that at the end of the night, I was *happier* if a member of
the "other side" had come by, and left us in peace, than if they never had
stopped by at all.

	First, I'm not Gateway, I'm just supporting an event, that I feel 
is getting a lot of shit unnescessarilly, and am tring to keep things 
here in a real prespective, that's all.

	So out of all this I see the main concern is whether or not people
knew whether or not this was a break in? I was there, people were told to
come to a map point, extreme secrecy was exercised(more so than any other
event I've been to out here), people were made to turn their head lights
off bout 200 feet before the gate; this should have been the 1st
indicator, that it was a break in, that's if you didn't know. They were
then guilded in by flashlights, and told to stay very quite. The
rumor/scuttle butt was that this was a breakin, everyone I talked with
knew that, and if they didn't and their were a few, I told them myself. The
only other thing I think that Gateway could have done & didn't was put it
on the net(not a good idea for obvious reasons), and stick in on the
voice mail, (ditto). If you ask promoters to do this you mite as well call
the police yourselfs, cause not only are you providing them with the 
information, your giving them effidence. 

	Remember the old rule never commit a crime with a paper trail, I
like to extent that to never commit a crime with an electronically
recoverable trail. For those not up on what our government can recover
from electronic media, you should be very scared, for it's amazing what
they can pull off even a wiped drive.

	I think everything that could have been done, without sending up a
flare or leaving evidence, was. I wouldn't have put myself into a
situation where I could have been busted, for some very personal reasons,
you'll just have to trust me on that one. I think a lot of people were
told, and that word "breakin" is tossed around so carelessly that it
didn't have the punch or recognition that it needs to have with certain
people. 

	Also if your on parole, you're not suppose to be doing drugs,
drinking, and or staying out late, leaving you county of parole, doing
your piss test every month or every 2 weeks ...etc.  Anyone who has that
much to lose, like a felony, shouldn't be at a rave anyway, People need to
take responsibilty for their own actions, if your on parole and at a rave,
any rave, you need to ask yourself if this is the best place I could be.
If I was on parole, I wouldn't even think about going to rave. 

	I think this forum come use some positive suggestions with regard
to the proper way to do a breakin.

Hmmm, I think the party promoters may have put an unwitting farmer 
at legal risk too. My understanding is that he's liable for injury that 
occurs on his property, so if any of those ravers swimming in the pond 
had drowned (thank god no one did), I think the owner could have been held 
liable, or at least brought to extreme legal grief by someone who thought 
he *should* be held liable, despite his level of knowledge about the event.  
Now before the flames begin, I don't claim to be a lawyer, so I'll happily 
stand corrected on this point.

Why is it not so difficult for people to engage in tedium.  Fact is I nor
anybody said SF is a godsend.  Fact is there *might* be places better,
depending on your point of view.

I think SF is one of the best places on earth.  My stats tell the story:
Population 759,000 or 15490 people per sq. mi.  There is only one place
with more polupation density, New York City I believe...with that in mind:

Lowest Crime rate for it's size in the US.
*THE* most diverse population in the country.
*THE* most integrated city in the country.
The lowest incidents of rape in the USA.
One of the few if not only city/county municipalities.
Better than average public transportation.  You *really* don;t need a car
to live here.
Arguably the best food in the country, second only to say NY.
One of the easiest places to enage in entreprenurial activities.
A tourist mecca.
Best beers.
Best coffees.
Best Bread.
Best babes, oops I meant chicks, oops I meant wimmins ( double :)'s ).
Higest number of interracial people.
Highest number of interracial marriage, couples, etc.
Largest gay & lesbian population.
Largest sex positive population.
Some of the most easy going cops you'll ever find (ALERT:  I am comparing
this to cities of equal or greater density.  Ever tried Miami, LA, or NY
PD's.  Sf's are QUITE cool when compared to other big cities.)
Most muli-cultural events.
The most lax Marijuana enforcement (a low priority on the Law Enforcement
rouster).
Most diverse music scene since man became bipedal.
Some of the coolest people you would ever want to meet live here in lovely
SF (and the surrounding Bay Area I might add!).

So personally with all this going for it, I have a sense of pride about
where I've chosen to live.  SF!  I've been here 5 years now, my son was
born here overlooking BOTH the Golden Gate & Bay Bridges (now that's a cool
way to be brought into the world!  Besides, he's one cool kid!!!)

There is some shit I hate about this city, but when taken in whole, this
place is the bomb.  How the hell can 750k+ people be so wrong and stay in a
place they hate so much...get with the program.  Enjoy living here.  Or you
could *always* move to Concord, Kentfield, Orinda, BlackHawk...

So basically you found the people you wanted to hear, but either were to
cheap or couldn't afford to go, or you didn't like the promoters. There's
always something.  Thusly, happy house sucks?  SF has a stagnant non
changing scene?  ok.

One suggestion.  Maybe doing your own gig and flying out the talent you
like, have them spin for your friends and the SF community.  Charge
nothing!  Free admission!  I didn't think so...


>I mean...I personally would like to see more
>Imported dj's....

But as stated above you want to see them for $5, or better yet free.  I
don't like to school folx on the economics of parties, but if it costs $500
to $1k to get Beltram out here, plus some other world famous techno gods
you'd pay to hear, they would have to  have the place the size of Cow
Palace jsut to break even.  C'mon.

>for a city with such a world class reputation i don't
>think we see this nearly as much as we should...

No, you wouldn't since you have objections to paying what it costs to bring
such talent to the area.

>in addition to the

Ok, let's consider this for a moment.  Let's consider DISTANCE & the COST
of travel.  It is cheaper to go from Chi to NY than it is to get from
either to SF.  Basic airline economics.  Now who covers the cost of bringin
in the DJ?  The promoter.  SO it costs $500 for a RT tickect to from CHI to
SF.  AND you have to pay the DJ what they want to, to spin.  Now you're
talking $$$. SF is expnesive due in large part to it's lacation.  We're on
the other side of the country.  One reason you don't see much outta town
talent is due to this fact.  The reason people charge $25 for imported
talent, is partially due to the ticket prices.  With a littel greed (i.e.
capitalism) thrown in for good measure.

Disposing of expectations sometimes allow for even greater moments.

Uh, I could care less.  The rest of the country is run by a whole lotta
repressive republicans.  At least you can smoke greenbud here without too
much to worry about...I chicago so lax?  How about NY?  Do they have
smokeouts in the park like we do here every year (and in other locations in
the bay area).  BTW, did I mention tthat the best green comes from....nyah,
you wouldn't believe me.

Sf wha?  Sound did you say.  Can you please describe it for me?

Baltimore?  Pittsburgh?  Not to slam my brothas and sistahs in the great
white segregated NE, or right side of the country.  But I need more than
music to catch a vibe.  And If I can't smoke outside without some copper
messing with me, that ruins my vibe. If I don;t see hella colors dancing on
the floor, that's a vibe killer for me too.  If there ain't one gay or
lesbian brotha or sistah out, that kills my vibe too.  Pittsburgh, Penn.?
Isn't that the place where MOVE got bombed?  Isn't that the state that has
Mamia Abu Jamal in jail on trumped up charges?  How integrated is the scene
in these places (last time I *heard* Baltimore was a racist as it ever
was....)

Agreed.  So catch some and dance at the party of your choice.  It's all up
to you!

Dear All;

	In California law there is something called clean hands, meaning if 
you break a law and then try and sue someone because you got hurt in the 
process that it was taken into account and weaken your claim excessively.

I think the point Ethan and Bryce are making about variety is quite on
the mark.  In fact most DJs, even the Wicked crew, have a fair amount
of variety, though you won't really hear that if you just go to Wickeds
and Come/Unitys.  Anyone who's heard me spin knows that I'm fiercely
eclectic.  Take a look at my practice list from last night (a fairly
typical one in its diversity, I didn't do it to specifically to make
a point here but it illustrates it quite well), and tell me what kind
of DJ *I* am -- house, techno, trance, breakbeat or what?  

  Nick Lowe - Heart of the City (my traditional retro-opener)
  Xpando - Here for the Love (acid house)
  The Magi (Chris Nazuka & Derrick Carter) - Clap Your Hands (disco-house)
  Mad Mike - Trance Patrol (Detroit house)
  Danell Dixon - I Saw the Future (acid house)
  Atlantean Love Machine - Dub Your Wig (progressive house)
  Towa Tei - Technova (George Llanes remix) (trance)
  Luna Eclipse - Return Home (Aquatherium remix) (progressive house/trance)
  Bass Bin Twins - SF2UK (breakbeat)
  Bass Kittens - Jack the Biscuit (breakbeat)
  K&M - Funk & Drive (funk house)
  T-recs - Trancepiration (trance)
  Time Warp - Jungle Drugstore (trance)
  Chez - Groove II (acid house)
  I Pooley - Sure (Detroit trance)
  Grip - On & On (trance)
  Humate & Rabbit in the Moon - East (trance)
  Airfix - I Found You (progressive house)
  Remy & Sven - Tsjika-Boem-Tsjak (trancey house)
  Drum Club - Drums Are Dangerous (techno)

When you actually analyze the sets being played by DJs in San Francisco
even at the big events, many of them are actually quite diverse.  The
problem comes when they play a limited range of beats or of sonic styles
at any given event.  The availability of beat-matchable tracks has led
to over-reliance on the single-BPM set, in my view.  124 or 134 or
whatever BPM might be fine for, say, half an hour, but the ear and the
body both get tired of monotony.  Like many DJs, I tend to move upward
in my set, the one above goes from roughly 126 to 135 but I often play
somewhat lower and a little higher, and sometimes jump up or down by
quite a few BPM.  The range may seem narrow, but the effect is quite
substantial when you change by, say, 5 BPM.  If it's not done correctly
it can really be a bad idea, of course, but that's part of the skill
involved in playing records for an audience.  

If I have a criticism of the mainstream DJs in San Francisco, it's that
they rely too heavily on what I'd call the Strictly Rhythm sound.  Now,
Strictly is a great label with tons of output that is generally quite
high quality, and they have an excellent mix of well-known and unknown
remixers.  But they rightfully have an overall "style" which has become
the pivot point for a lot of the big-room sets in SF over the last two
years.  I don't want to criticize Strictly per se, they don't put out
cheeze and they are in many ways a model of how a serious dance music
label should be run, but to some degree DJs have used the ubiquity of
their catalogue as a crutch.  

The other thing to realize is that the audiences for this music have
congealed into somewhat separate microclusters.  In part this is because
what was fresh and demanded attention in 1990 has now become familiar
and background in 1995.  The tremendous push for innovation in dance
music has to a great degree run the course of the musical flexibility
available in the 4x4 beat and current technology, and so I hear much
more conscious efforts at standing out from the crowd which achieve
that objective but at the sacrifice of musicality.  Take Josh Wink,
for example, one of the premier remixers of the time and clearly a
major force on our music scene now and for years to come.  When I hear
him put out "Don't Laugh" or "I Am Ready" or other recent tracks, you
can hear how he uses the techniques that he's developed from years of
putting out records to produce tracks that are gosh-darn-guaranteed-
surefire "hands in the air floor fillers."  I greatly respect that
ability, but frankly after I hear those one or two times I've had
enough.  When something completely brilliant like Wink's "Meditation
Will Manifest" comes along, I want to play it to death because it
has such great textures and rewards you with different flavors each
time you hear it.  

People who produce records for a living have to go for the "floor fillers"
to pay the rent.  I have a bunch of respect for people like Wink and
Strictly who do put those out, but who also put out full-on musically
innovative work as well.  To me, then, the burden falls back on the DJ
to strike a balance between pleasing and teaching the audience.  
I have my preferences among the SF DJs, as does everyone, but most of
them seem to me to work hard at finding that balance to their own
satisfaction.  It's only when they clearly fall back on a standard
game plan that I start getting annoyed.  Punching a clock isn't the
way to play music in public, even if it's your job.  

But San Francisco is not dominated by any one sound or approach, even
in the relatively narrow circles we travel in.  Ultimately, as a
listener or participant it's our responsibility to seek out the new
and unusual and demanding and rewarding music out there.  It means
giving up a sure-fire good time, sometimes, but as long as the hits
outweigh the misses it's well worth it.  Otherwise, you might as well
stay at home and watch MTV.

Okay.  "Don't".  

I actually did write up a document a while ago on my experiences 
with renegades.  it was under an old email address alias which doesn't 
exist anymore, so send comments to me.  It was dated around August or 
September 93. NB I always refer to "public land" as the site for 
outdoor parties - by that I mean parks, unincorporated areas, public 
beaches, etc.  The URL is

http://hyperreal.com/raves/spirit/caring/Outdoor_Parties.html

BTW, the "spirit" archives are maintained by Lee Fogel.

I never did get around to writing something on site-hunting... maybe 
soon...

Well, Jon, if you don't like "fluffy diva house music" don't go to Spundae
and other events at DV8, or the End Up, or whatever.  Actually, I'm not
real big on that style myself, but like anything, I love it when it's
played well, at the "right" time (depends as much on the crowd as the
time'o'day) and not overplayed.  

Hmm, I wonder if fluffy diva house music includes the work of people
like Roger S, Frankie Knuckles and Serious Rope.  If so, I'm in trouble
because those are mainstays of my current playing!

I can't condone break-ins.  Using public land "off hours" is one thing,
breaking locks to enter private property whether a building or a field
is quite another.  I'm not a property absolutist; in fact, I spend a
good portion of my life in political work designed to oppose that
proposition.  But using private property without permission for our
parties is not only illegal, it's stupid.  I don't care how perfect
the site is.  No matter how stealthily it's done, eventually it will
be found out and the consequences will set all of us back because
as always, bad news travels instantly and good news takes the slow
path.

Sorry I'm so hard on this, but it's my strong feeling.

I was at the party with 2 friends.  We were among the first to arrive
and among the last to leave without getting busted.  Upon leaving the
party we had NO IDEA it was a breakin.  In fact, when I read the first
posting saying it got busted I was convinced the author was joking.

I am not exactly on parole, but my legal status is somewhat sketchy;
my immigration status is even more sketchy; getting busted would have
been BAD.  VERY BAD!  Had I known the party was a breakin I would NOT
have gone; had I learned this at the party I would have probably left.
I understand posting such info on the net is not a good idea, but
telling us at the mappoint would be reasonable.  Or at least at the
entrance to the parking lot.

I agree with Lee.  I should be able to decide for myself which laws I
may want to break.  And when.

But it was a great party.  One of the best.  I was very happy to have
been there, and am very happy for not getting busted.  Thank you
Claire for taking all the responsibility.  I will do what I can to
help you deal;  you should post an address for donations to help with
the legal fees.

Peace and love

Dear Lee;

	Sorry, in the heat of the moment, the Emotion/Intellect ratio
exceeded a value of 1, by a lot. I wasn't aware of the hurt my words
carried, perhaphs I should listen to my own advice and not take things so
personally, or least givem 24 hours. Lee, I assure you that hurt wasn't in
my heart when I wrote what I wrote, I'm just not wired that way, even
though I'm capable, hence by handle Brian Darkness, duality, even I need
to have an external source remind me of that, from time to time. 

	Sorry, Brian & thanks for saving my grace and helping me, see 
through some stuff with Lee that temporary blinded me.

Two things in response to jsl's comments.

First, be careful about categorizing the scene in the East Coast.
(MOVE was in Philly, not Pittsburgh, by the way.  And Kurt Schmoke,
one of the better mayors in the nation who happens to be African-
American, runs Baltimore hella better than Schaefer ever did.
Racism?  That'
s everywhere.  I've heard horribly racist comments in San Francisco
as well as my own town of Portland.)

Second, I just discovered one of the reasons that bigtime DJs don't
often make it to the west coast.  It turns out that it costs more to
fly to Detroit right now ($750) than to London ($600), which is why
I'm not going to the Detroit music conference this week after being
jazzed about going there all year long.  

I do wish more "name" DJs from out of town would come to the west
coast, and in fact if you look at the last year or so, it's starting
to happen.  It's just that they don't play the big "underground"
parties very much, so you have to watch the club listings carefully.
But if Roger S, Justin Robertson, Jeff Mills, Emma (DIY), Pierre,
Frankie Feliciano, Sasha and Mixmaster Morris aren't "big names" in
the DJ world, I've missed the mark somehow.  And they've all played
SF in the last year.

Dear All;

	For clarity, I'm not condoning breakin's & when Gateway makes
their statement, I know they won't either. I'm just tring as I said to put
things in perspective; tresspassing, is a minor offense, and should not be
blown into murder, or rape of a farmers land. Anyone who does drugs
commits a much more serious crime than does someone tresspassing, at
least in the eye's of our government. 

	Obviously, the fact that there were some people who appear to
have, either been uninformed of the status of this event, or just didn't
fiqure it out. I personally made every attempt to let people what was up,
and I believe so did Gateway. It's unfortuate this happened, and I don't
believe Gateway intentionally tried to get people in trouble with the law,
or make them accessories to a crime. I will still, stand by what I said,
if your on parole, say away from raves, there is way to much temptation
present there for all sorts of things.

Im not so sure that anyone is hip to the fact that the majority of the djs
that are taking the music to new limits are not in this city.  What I mean
is, they live here on the weekdays, they shop at all the record stores
(including my favorite: Sound Works), but they fly away every weekend to
all parts of the country.  This pack of rebel SF djs includes myself, John
Williams, Carlos, Graeme, DRC, and a bunch of others I'm sure. The
stationary djs are the ones that you always hear and always see on SF
flyers.  That is unless you like to venture to the sounds of Theta Blip,
H.A.L.F.(Happy Alien Life Force), Alex, Ethan, Mars, Goa Gil, Chizaru, and
many others if you look in the cracks.  A nice alternative to the syndrome
of the happy house movement is a party known as The 8th House Experiment
(8th House, has not one thing to do with house).  Its at the Cats grill,
1190 Folsom. Other that that, if your so unhappy about the music situation,
as so many of us are, do something about it.  Please!!!  If you are
unwilling or just unable to provide us with your own taste of nightclub,
just educate our fellow naive ravers, who were'nt around 5 yrs ago to
witness the root of it all.

By the way,  HOW DID HOUSE MUSIC EVER GET INTO THE RAVES?

                WHAT WENT WRONG???

P.S. I still love house music.

I know my last post was kinda sharp, but under the circumstances, it was
necessary.

Many people who are new to the area bring all their expectations with them.
I stumbled into the house scene after moving here from LA/OC.  It opened
my eyes to the possibilities.  I have made more friends and associates than
I could have possibly dreamt, and the people who I have met have been
genuine gems in many ways.

People will always have a bone to pick with something, but as many of you
have come to know me, the first question I always ask in "What are *YOU*
gonna do about it?".  Whether it was 18-- parties, or smokeless gatherings
I have always asked what action people planned to take against the elements
they did not care for.  After waiting a little while people began to RISE
to the occasion.  MOST notably Ethan & Bryce. Here are two guys who did not
like what they saw, and instead of droning on and on, they did the next
logical thing:  If you don't like it, change it.  They changed it by doing
thier own thing, right in the midst of SF for all to see.  After continuing
for a year they now have a rep, and are quite well known in the community
for throwing quality gigs (word on the street) @ more than fair prices.
They are well respected in the promoter & clubgoer community as a reputable
crew & family.  These days you nary here from them on the list about
"...promoter this..." or "...promoter that...".  Why?  They are too busy
doing their own thang, and suffer little from the distractions that come
with watching others instead of watching yourself.

The same can be said of the SMILE posse, who are just starting to push up,
but have not sacrificed their integrity just to get a name.  Their purpose
is true, and like F&F time will be on their side if they decide to stick it
out (I KNOW they will).  That's the whole point.  I think that the same can
be said of a SCruze resident who now does gigs in that part of the Bay Area
(Sean, is true non?).

Its not as if some criticism is not valid.  But what I have believed from
the start is that criticism w/o action or any intent to do such, is a waste
of time, and breath.  There are plenty of people who can point out all the
bad, but few are those who are willing to make a difference.  Making a
difference requires committment & will.  I admire those who show such
qualities.  Personally I would rather emulate a doer than someone who
observes.  Don't we have enough pundits?

So if the music does not suit you, BUY the music you want to play, become a
DJ.  Oh you don't wanna do that?  Then get the people you want to spin,
forma a posse, and throw your own gig!  If that doesn't suit you then try
to talk w/ the person throwing the event and change their minds.  If that
doesn't work, then you can at least say I tried.  Flights leave every day
from SFO or Oakland.

* I LOVE SF *
* SF & THE PEOPLE IN IT ARE THE BOMB *
* THE BAY AREA ROCKS d00D ! * "Heh, heh" "Uhh, huh-huh!"  "Yeah, rocks
dude, heh-heh!  Hey, I didn't know there we're zeroes in the word dude."
"That's cuz you've been munching too much
assmunch...huh-huh,huh-huh,huh-huh!"

I'm done wit this tedious old ass thread,

I would totally go. I think that the difference in all our culture of
ubringing(from only 1000 miles away to halfway across the globe) we can
learn. It's from this learning that we can grow. From this growing that
we can acheive. What we acheive is totally up to us but we can do it!

I'd go in a heartbeat. I would also like to see how a friends and family
would go off in Chic-a-go. I probably even take the weekend off and fly
down there to see it.

I stand corrected Phred.  Rightly said I might add...  I couldn't remember
the city, but the opportunity was too good to pass up ;).  Thanks for the
correction however....HOWEVER:

SF is the most integrated city bar none.  I lived on the SE for the
majority of my life.  Got to visit many places in the NE.  W/O a doubt SF
has the most integrated scene.  And that is VERY important to me as an Af.
Am.  Hell, when you go to a hip-hop event in this city its all about the
brown, red, black & white.  Now that's integration, and *THAT'S* beautiful.

As for Af. Am. mayors.  Wilson Goode was the one who bombed the HQ of move.
He was Af. Am. as well. Af. Am. mayor does not always mean good mayor.  I
am quite aware of this fact.  As for Baltimore itself.  C'mon, Baltimore
gives So. Boston a run for the money when it comes to racism (black mayors
HARDLY remedy racism, note: Detroit, Chicago, LA, for starters).

I'd rather be here than anywhere else.  Hearing it and living it are two
different things.  You may hear racist shit here, and the city right now is
playing eject the blacks (it won't happen :) ), but overall SF/Bay Area is
much better than the rest of the country when it comes to race relations.

There are some places in Oregon that give me the creeps.  I'd hate to get
lost going to Portland (the sound of dueling banjos comes to mind! :) ).

The other factor is the smaller promoters are not privvy since they have a
smaller netowrk of people to work with.  If you know they're coming, you
can get the talent at your party.  All these pople triple book up the ass!
You just gotta know who to ask.

Rightly said Phred :):) !!!

Peace bro,
John

 After reading the recent "H*ppy H**s* Cr*p" posts , I have noted two 
themes - 

#1. Newcomers and locals without extensive scene experience find it hard 
    to predict what the music is going to be like at an event.

#2. Predictable DJs are somehow "lesser" than eclectic , hard-to-
    catagorize DJs. ( not my opinion totally , just what I perceive 
    from the posts ).

 After 3 years of going to local events , I still feel somewhat in the
category of the folks in #1 above. This is because I still don't have 
a handle on ALL the regularly working DJs in the area , although I do
have a mini-list of favorites I'd go see if an event has them on its
flyers.
 
 But, this is seems like being a rock music fan , trying to figure out 
what style a band plays by who else is on the bill and whether it's 
"Molybdenum Alloy Metal Grunge" night at that club. There are "rock"
musicians who I'll go out of my way to see if they ever came here on
tour ( Bill Nelson ) , and there are tons of local hard working bands
who I know nothing about and don't have the time to check out.    
  
 There are so many DJ's in this area I couldn't possible know them all,
so I take a guess - DJ * is on the same lineup as Jeno and Garth,
so DJ * probably doesn't play gabber ( at least not at this event! ).

 If I'm in the mood for a good dose of a certain style , it's good to
be able to have some predictability in DJs. And , since I don't go out
as much as a S.F. resident would , I haven't burned-out on any DJ's 
individual style yet. 


 I wish I could come up with some grand unifying statements at this point,
but I'd rather go to bed!

Looking for any and all information regarding Hardkiss Music and the
Hardkiss brothers, be it positive or negative. Especially useful would be
information on releases before "Phases of an Out Of Body Experience", and
any after "Phoenix" (white label), especially the "Phoenix" rerelease.

Also, if you have any articles from magazines (urb and XLR8R especially), I
would love to get copies of them, or even the originals if possible.

Since the Hardkiss brothers are from SanFran, I figured this'd be the best
place to ask for info. I'm trying to put together a web page about them.

I'm sorry, I forgot to mention that I'd rather you email any of this info to
me, or at least CC: it to me, as this list does receive a lot of mail, and
I'm not from SanFran, so it tends to be of rather low interest. Honestly, no
offense. I will continue to read the list for a while.

Well good luck, I think the bottom line is you should go for it.
If your parties are good and the music is hitting then people will come
and you will get a following, if the party and or music is "lame" then you
won't get a following and you will loose money which is how it generally
goes.  Don't blame the "SF scene" if a certain type of music is not popular
here then in other places, 4 years ago Techno was very popular here, other
styles predominate now but lots of people (including me :) will go to a party
that plays Techno or hard trance or whatever if the music is good, if the DJ is
lame or his/her choices are cheesey, then I don't want to hear it.

Toni at the last Freedom played some pretty hard techno-y stuff, that made 
me put my head in a bass bin :) something I haven't done since the days of 
Techno at Toon Town :)

Yeah dude, and that's what it's all about.
If your into those styles maybe you should start throwin parties or hook-up
with others like you and throw a party together, it doesn't cost much to
throw an underground all you need is a generator for $40 - $50 and a
sound system, there are a lot of small systems floating around.

Now as far as BIG events, well they cost a lot of money to throw, it will be
hard to convince a large promoter to throw an event that s/he KNOWS they will
loose money on (because at least right now, a hard techno party won't
fill up  a large event, but if you look at the musical history of San Francisco
from the 50 , 60 on, San Francisco has ALWAYS been the home of the funky groove
thang, people here prefer that to jumping on whatever musical bandwagon
comes through at the moment.  As a DJ wannabe and someone who has been going
out in SF for a few years, the music has changed tremendously over time.
It still is groovy and still is funky.  SF people like to dance and this is
why there is so much VIBE.  It is really hard to exhibit any type of graceful
moves at 160 BPM, I suppose you could jump around but for many of us, it's not
trance inducing (maybe we're just getting too old :). It takes several hours
of dancing and music before large numbers of people can easily enter the trance
state the we refer to as the VIBE, if you start off at 140 and go up from there
most people won't be able to keep up for the 3 or 4 hours needed to break 
down there ego enough to enter trance.  I remember early parties that would
open with Happy House, get to Hard Techno around midnight, at high BPMs and
then on to some Tribal so that by the time 4 am came around, everyones minds and
bodies were conditioned for Jeno to come on and mash their Egos to a pulp.
Such is not the case today but... 

there is always tomorrow.

---------------------------------------


                           AMEN!!


That was the beauty of the Rave ideals in the beginning (at least on the 
west coast)  that raves where seperate from clubs.  They were a completly 
different alternative to clubs and clublife, and the music was not club 
music....It was Rave music, and TECHNO, music that had massive breaks and 
suprises coming in from all over, not just formula house tracks that will 
move the feet but not the mind!  Keep house in the clubs and house 
parties, but please dear god let me hear the "MUSIC FOR HUGE SPACE 
ARENAS"  at the raves.  Raves to me, are massive parties where the 
boundarys are being pushed on all senses, where people are gathered for 5 
or more hours on a dance floor to be taken on a journey through the most 
sonically amazing and avanced techniques possible.  Most house music 
relys soley on the groove and the beat, while not nearly enough attention 
is paid to the sound and the structure of the song.  I will give San 
Fransico credit for having some amazingly technically talented dj's, many 
who are very good at creating a groove and keeping a dancer on their feet 
for hours at a time.  This groove is not as hard to create as I once 
thought when I realized that most of the songs are all in the same BPM 
range and have similar moods (happy).  I am much more impressed with a dj 
who can push the boundaries further, but still be in control of the 
energy level while flucuating in a larger range.  Too much predictability 
is something that bores the shit out of me, especially when I am dancing.

Brian, I see where you're coming from, in fact I feel exactly as you do 
about most of what you mentioned here, but we must realize that land isn't 
"rented" from the government; they're *extorting* the money from us.  The 
land is ours, not theirs.  Just because they have the power to take the 
land, doesn't mean it's their right to do so.  Might doesn't make right.

> The crime of

> infraction,

Be this as it may, trespassing on privately owned land is still wrong, 
and should in my opinion be avoided.  Not only is it disrespectful of the 
owner and a violation of his/her right to privacy among other things, it 
may expose an owner to liability for things that happen on their land as 
a result of the trespass that he or she had no knowledge of or control over.  
Surely we can all agree this should not happen to an innocent party.

Don't be surprised; our government has done far worse to people for far 
lesser offenses.

Yes!! I wish I'd been there...

Unfortunately in this case, actions speak louder than words.  I think it 
was in effect a statement about the absence of respect for property rights 
in our culture, even if that was not the intent.

It most definitely is!  "Freedom of assembly" should be on the lips of 
everyone whenever a party is busted where the owners of the site have 
given permission for it to be held there.

Yes.  Public land belongs to we the people, not to some government agency; 
there is no need to get a permit to hold an event there unless it 
interferes with someone else's use of the land, who by the same token has 
equal rights to its use.

I couldn't agree more.  Ravers in Great Britain are way out in front of 
us on this issue.  (See "Raving Injustice" post for more on this...)

Well I was born in Baltimore and went to high school there, I also spent
12 years in the Boston area.  Baltimore is the gateway to the south, there is
racism there (as it is everywhere).  If I were to catagorize between Boston
and Baltimore as which is the most racist city, Boston would win HANDS DOWN.
In all my travels through out the world including Texas, North Carolina
and throughout europe, BOSTON was the only city that I called a nigger while
dodging a thrown beer bottle (this was in Harvard Square BTW :).

Baltimore has a large "hick" population, but the city is also 70% black
unlike BOSTON which is about 8% black but I don't know, I moved out here
because I got tired of having store security follow mw around everytime I went
into a shopping mall, which is the way things are in boston.


It's funny but I can't think of any other place that I would rather live than
The Bay Area, and after seeing the stats from the last election

	( http://www.election.digital.com/e/returns/returns/page.html )

I have definitely decided to move to San Francisco.

Doug, I appreciate what you're saying.  I just hope we can all keep in 
mind that there's a fine line between discretion and appeasement.  
Discretion is standing for your freedoms, but choosing when and where to 
exercise them, how to frame the issue in a non-confrontational manner, 
and so on.  Appeasement is retreating from your beliefs in the face of a 
threat, and allowing yourself to be intimidated.  I'm not saying you or 
anyone else is necessarily advocating this, I just want to get it said...

Appeasement has short term benefits.  It may allow a party to go off, 
prevent people from getting arrested, avoid ugly scenes with the police,
etc.  The problem comes when you look at the long-term effect.  It's kind 
of like borrowing money to pay for social programs, and passing the cost 
on to future generations.  Great now, not so fun for those who pay.

Imagine a situation where someone hijacks a plane and threatens to blow 
it up unless other dangerous terrorists are released from custody.  If the 
authorities cave in and release the terrorists (in other words, tolerate 
a wrong in order to avert a greater immediate wrong), the outcome is 
going to be much better for the people on the plane than it would if the 
authorities refused to grant the demands or attempted a rescue of the 
passengers and provoked a violent response from the hijacker.
However this sends others the message that you can get what you want 
through terrorism.  Terrorist acts will become more frequent, and the 
demands will become greater, as long at it is perceived that the 
authorities will always give in rather than risk an unpleasant situation.

In our situation, we are being asked to give up little bits of our 
freedom by the government, whether it's the right to dance without a 
permit, the right to set off fireworks, the right to do drugs, the right 
to attend events before reaching a certain age, etc.  When we give in on 
these points, we avoid having the police spoil our parties.  But we also 
send the message that it's okay for them to take our freedoms away, and 
this encourages them to continue doing so, since they now know that they 
can get what they want (power and control over us) from this type of 
"terrorism".

The long and the short of it is, if we give legitimacy to the authoritarian 
demands of the government by quietly doing their bidding on the implicit 
understanding that they let us alone thereafter, we merely open the door 
to more unreasonable demands, and soon we may not have the right to rave 
at all.  There wasn't a lot of partying going on in the former Soviet Union.

	With liberty and justice for all,

This message was going to be an input of an article on the rave scene in 
Britain that I promised to post here some time ago, but after staying up 
all night to get through my email and write a couple other responses, I'm 
just too darn sleepy to type it in (it's two whole pages of fine type) 
despite referring to it in my other post.  However I promise that I will 
find time to type it in soon.

Ah, if wishes were scanners... :)

my intent was really to say, be discreet and respect the law as much as
possible in order to not attract undue attention to yourself, in order to
accomplish your true aims.  society does pass laws and make restrictions 
that end things.  i think the movement in England is more restricted by
laws than it used to be.  i remember reading about ravers descending into
towns, scaring the shit out of the inhabitants, trampling shit, and then
laws were passed. 

i'm not saying to back down from agression, or to sacrifice in any way
your rights to assemble, etc, but if your know what your intent is, and
are self confident about it, it is probably best preserved by keeping it
as low key as possible.  is it really about confrontation ?

I was hoping some of you might be able to help me out.  I'm looking for a 
decent used mixer, something with a seperate EQ for each channel.  I 
don't know much about mixers at all (it's not for me, I'm buying it for a 
friend on the east coast) so I would appreciate any advice or 
recomendations anyone has to offer.  I'm looking for something around 
$300.  Thanks in advance and sorry to use up bandwidth with a non rave 
related post.  
	See everyone at Sunset this Sunday.

Smiles
Andrew

I love living here. it's the rave scene i'm dissatisfied with.
 
I'd love to throw my own parties, do my own thing. I can't afford that. 
If anyone wants to donate a few hundred or thousand bucks to throw a 
moderate-sized party with harder-than-usual music, my wallet's open. :)
I'm willing to support and help out jon and nantsee:). 
i'm willing to help anyone if they're going to throw parties i'm 
interested in...back east i helped out parties often, i even 
performed...
anyway....enough of this, as jsl said...

I'd like to see someone take a crack at it, actually.   Dutch's eloquently
blunt statement really got my wheels turning.

" HOW DID HOUSE MUSIC EVER GET INTO THE RAVES?

                WHAT WENT WRONG???"

I remember from the few parties I went to in '92, a certain energy, a
feeling, that I haven't found at any parties since.   It had a lot to do with
the tunes, the sound, but I think there was some collective vibe, something
different.   What has happened?        Tom

No, I believe you are absolutely correct on this one. And for those that say,
"Oh I would never sue if I got injured," you might not, but your families 
might. This has happened... more than once....

Drove up from LA to see WICKED Saturday night!!  All I can say is WICKED IS 
GREAT!!  They totally went off!!  I danced nonstop!!! (even though I had to dance in 
the hallway near the exit because of the heat inside!)  Wish it wasn't soo hot & 
crowded inside, but I still had a great time!!!

I love the San Francisco scene & always wonder why I moved away!!

I'll be back to catch WICKED again!

Try Ameba on Haight street, they have a wide selection of DJ Mix tapes
as well as knowledgable staff.  DJ Tracy's new tape is the Bomb by the way :)

Brian, I never think of you as someone who would intentionally hurt 
anything.  If a fly landed on you, I bet you'd offer it a free massage. 
So no apology is necessary.  Anyway, I don't tend to take these things too
personally.  Besides, it's fun to get flamed once in a while.  Now if
only I can get Niels to flame me, then I'd really feel special. ;)

Raving inspires idealism in many of us, and sometimes I think we can make
mistakes by trying too hard to perpetuate our personal vision of how we
want things to be.  I've been as guilty of this as anyone.  When we start 
stepping on people toes in order to push agendas of peace/unity/freedom/etc, 
that's when I feel a fresh perspective can be helpful.

I've met Claire a couple of times, and I think her heart is in the right
place.  I have contributed to her efforts in the past, and I plan to
continue supporting the Gateway Systems folks in the future.

Lee

Lucas-Arts does this, and Sega and Nintendo give you subscription cards in

i'm new to all this, but it seems to me that over time, scenes
change, the people in the scene change, the people spinning 
change, the political environment changes.  in sum : everything
changes !  as the media humps any new thing into the ground,
it seems like the rave scene is still somewhat untouched.
look at how fast Seattle came and went.  there are probably
a lot of people up there asking 'what went wrong'.  i'm
surprised at posts like this, as the whole rave experience
for me has been incredibly enlightening and fulfilling.

I think my Portland colleague Derek might be a *leetle* bit confused about
what "house music" is.  I was briefly under the same misconception when
I started getting into this scene in 1991.  At that point, house to me
seemed to be cheesy vocal-oriented discoey club-oriented slush.  There
was a lot of that then, just as there is now.  But that's like saying
that all jazz is just like bad lounge jazz with cheesy vocalists, and
ignoring the whole history of jazz from Jelly Roll Morton to Branford
Marsalis, with side trips for Ellington, Basie, Beiderbecke, Bird,
Byrd (Charlie that is), MJQ, Goodman, Miles, Hancock, Haden, Blakey,
Shorter and so many more who innovated, shaped and matured the many-
faceted sides of jazz music.  

House music can be cheesy, sure.  So can techno (or jazz, for that matter,
or rock, or classical, or any music made to avoid challenge instead of
putting it on the line).  But never let it be said that *techno*
(especially the fast, hard Euro-techno that has dominated the discussions
of techno since 1990) was the origin of raves.  Of all the different
styles -- and again ignoring for the moment the futility of applying
simple words to encompass music having so many more degrees of freedom --
acid house holds the claim to being the foundation of what we call
"raves," although certainly they developed directly out of the house/garage/
club/party/all/night/long movement of the mid-1980s, which is itself 
directly descended from the true disco scene (as opposed to the commercial
one epitomized by Saturday Nite Fever and all-o-dat).  

Some localities missed out on the acid house phase of raving, but the
"party style" of DJs, lights and all-night events continued with the faster
techno styles so many people came into this with.  And that's just fine.

But now consider: let's say somebody disses the music you really love,
whether it's jazz, house, techno, bluegrass, gamelan, Bach-Beethoven-Brahms,
Finnish reindeer herder songs, whatever.  Doesn't that usually mean that
they've just been exposed to the "cheese" in that genre, rather than the
good stuff?  I mean, you *know* it's good because you *have* heard the
good stuff, that's why you like it.  My own feeling is that it's our
duty to *spread* the good stuff to our friends who haven't heard it yet.
Even the styles of music I like the least, like Nashville "country",
turn out to have quite worthwhile practitioners when I've dug into them
enough.  

There is no need to bash someone else's preferences in order to build up
confidence in one's own preferred musical styles.  The real story of
music is that it's *software* -- you can't use it up!  "Listen all you
want, we'll make more!"  So if you don't like Word, use Word Perfect,
and neither of us should cut down the users of emacs just because it
looks like an undigestable mush to us.  There is a great beauty and
wisdom in emacs, if you put up with the superficial cheese long enough!!

Thank You to everyone who gave comments and opinions about the light party
on Saturday night.  In retrospect we've realized the mistakes in our vision.
We are learning through our experiences throwing events and part of learning
is taking responsibility.  Which we have every intent of doing.  To clear up
details of the event - no one was arrested.  The police were not angry but
co-operative and suggestive re: better locations to do these type of events.
The police did not arrest anyone however the owner did place a citizens
arrest which if he wants to prosecute will pay the court fees.  I 
do not believe he will pay the costs to prosecute 42 or more people. We will 
continue to have our celebrations however, we definately will keep them as legal
as events of this nature can be.  We expect that most people have common
sense and that if a party starts at 1am w/ a map point, your lights off and
are told
that it is important that the police not get involved that you consider your
personal situation and make a decision.  We realize many of you were not aware
until after the 2 hr drive (This is noted!) - our apologies.  We care about
what happened and the danger we created for someof the party goers - however
danger lerks in all forms - attention and awareness are your protectors! We
have taken full responsibility and can do no more than that.  We want to
communicate about these events - it can only improve them.  Lets be
respectful and considerate about how we choose express ourselves - more
people might listen and make change.  Thank You all again.  See you soon.
FEEL IT-LOVE!

Dear All;

	I've noticed a sudden influx of America Onliners(aol.com); it
would be truely wrong of me not to tell you people that you are getting
throughly ripped off. Netcom, Liberty, & Well(I personally don't like
them); as well as some of the other smaller providers will give you higher
connect rates, UNIX shells, Virtual & Dedicated ppp & slip, multiple
accounts for a lot less than your paying those big corporate nazi
providers. You will actually get to know your sysop, Dave at liberty is
great and will bend over backwards for you. Liberty also offers a great
deal; for every person you bring in, its something like $3.00 off your
monthly charge of $25.00; which gets you a real LINUX shell, a virtuall
slip connection, 4 hours a day of Internet & BBS access, a Galacticomm
Front End, no setup charges, 2 accounts; (one bbs internet address & a
LINUX address); if you get enough people to sign up, you canactually get
paid to be on there system with no upper limit, Liberty uses it's
subscribers as it's sales force. Do whatever you like; I personally I'm
not into selling people anything, well maybe selling them on the idea to
respect & love one another, buts that's it. See ya; in computers & the net
smaller is better.

Dear All;

	Well as many of you know I've been carless, well that day is about
to end, in about 2 - 4 weeks I will be receiving about $4000 to invest in
a used motorcycle;(looking for a super bike 450cc to 600cc range +100cc if
it's a real good deal), a 4 season/1 piece suit/ preferable gortex, &
a helmet. I am a 1st time rider, and will be taking the motorcycle safety
course. 

	Any advice on make, model, what to look for in a used bike, how to
tell if it's been in an accident ..etc, will be greatly appreiated, for I
know nothing about them. I've been told the "rice burners" are pretty
reliable, but the womyn like the Harleys; he-he; just kidding to all my
feminist womyn friends. I personally don't like Harley's way to big, &
noisey for me. But honestly & seriously any good sound advice would be
great, Black Adder has promised to help me shop, anyone else out there
that can lend a hand doing that would be great, thanks; please keep
responses private, and without the donor-cycle jokes.

Ummmm...and for now there are lot of good reasons why you may want to
use one of the "big corporate nazi providers."  For instance, if you
travel alot, like I do, then you can dial-in to the local pop rather than
paying for the long distance charge to SF.  That definitely saves you
money.  Also, AOL, Compuserve, Prodigy, etc. provide value-added services
that you can't find or find easily on the Internet.

So, let's take care not to make broad generalizations and associate
legitimate companies with fascism.  I personally don't see AOL,
Compuserve, and the like as dictatorships promoting aggressive
nationalism, militarism, and racism.

Which leads me to one final point.  There has been a great deal of
anti-establishment (almost anarchistic) sentiment in some of the postings
over the last few days.  I am actually surprised at the naivete regarding
taxes equal a lease payment to the goverment (NOT!), who owns the land
(the people or the government), and (dis)respecting other people's
ownership rights, etc.  People are fabricating "arguments" to support
their views and in the process they are perverting reality.  This is
rubbish and more than a little paranoid.  C'mon lets apply some
sensability *and* do the necessary homework before posting stuff.

Flame suit on.

Bradley

Take a look at their business practices. Right now the only thing keeping 
all the bigger services from focusing on their asperations of "owning" the
Internet is their greater fear of Bill Gates bundling Microsoft Network 
software with Win 95.

I already posted this to the Ambient and IDM lists with no response so I
thought I'd try here.

Does anyone have a copy of Ambient Dub Vol. II (a compilation) from (Beyond)
on Vinyl that they would like to sell or trade.  It is one of my favorite
compilations, and hold significant memories of really good times.

I'd really like to get ahold of it.

Dear All;

chicken shit to the bone.

I turn my back for ONE minute and you're all viciously attacking each
other!  What is this?  where's the PLUR I found down there?  I don't think
I've ever seen things get so snippy on this list.

Let the folks who want to be cowards and downers mumble along to
themselves.  Flaming back at them harshly just escalates things into a
pointless battle which has nothing to do with music or people or happiness
or joy, just a petty "NO!  I'M RIGHT" argument which is mostly ego and
little content.

Everyone has a right to their opinions.  If people can't express their
opinions in reasonable ways, that's their problem, not your own.

I hate saying negative stuff but I just felt I ought to say SOMETHING.  I
look forward to my SF Raves posts and hate having to weed through someone's
personal battleground to find my information.

peace and BEHAVE YOURSELVES!! ;)

Alot of people go to aol because they don't give a shit about unix shells,
slipp and ppp, and or/ the hassel.  Personally, I prefer a little bit of
everything- but think of the majority of AOL subscribers as non-tech
people.  We're talking about the mainstream consumer market here... The
same people who watch 'the price is right' religiously, QVC, etc.etc.
These people don't want to be bothered with trumpet winsock, and endless
config problems.. And hell- you can't even get support if COnfig PPP
doesn't work!  They want the easy way to the super highway...

My AOL account is free, and I don't think I would of ever checked them out.
But, The company I work for just happens to be one of their partners.
This doesn't make me an AOL fan, but I know more about their service and
how it works.  It's not all that bad- considering the internet access and
the user-friendliness..

personally- I like unix and eudora for mail..

-Jon

Oh.. and about the NAZI comment.  I don't think thats the case since we
("the Gateway to Afrocentric Culture") get full support from everyone at
AOL..

        I would have to agree here. Although you may or may not like what
you get for the money, a lot of these larger services aren't exactly the
greatest people to do business with because of the way the companies are
run.  For instance, last summer I actually used one of those ubiquitous
10-hours-free AOL disks.  Sure, I got my ten hours free.  I used them, then
never touched it again.  However, I was never informed that by using those
hours I was becoming an AOL customer, therefore requiring me to call and
cancel my service.  They claimed that this was in the initial login screen,
but I looked thoroughly for anything like that (aware that they were
probably trying to take my money) and didn't see anything.  Not only that,
but after I called to cancel my membership they still billed me for another
two months and I had to call again to have them remove the charges.  I've
heard that Prodigy is even worse about cancelling membership, though I have
no firsthand experience.
        I guess the bottom line is that regardless of the services they
provide, they aren't the best businessmen in the world.  If you don't dial
up from multiple locations or use some of their commercial services, you're
better off with a smaller company.  If you do, keep in mind that big
corporations are hardly sympathetic to your personal needs.

think of the house you live in, and the music you listen to..

theres:

Garage          the garage
Ambient         the roof (and maybe you bedroom)
Jungle          the stairs (running up and down)
Techno          the basement
House           the frame of the house
Trance          hallway (a really long one)
Dub             the bathroom
Disco           your mom and dads trunk in the attic
Grunge          the toilet
New Age         the living room


just a little thought..

Ah help!

I have never been to a full moon party but I know they are legendary and 
would love to go.

So if any one could send me some info on how to find out about it I would 
appreciate it.

Or if someone in Monterey or Santa cruz is going I would love to  hook up.
I can take three people in my car. ;)

See you guys , i hope,.....  :)

Really, me too.  In fact, just before I saw Jon's message I was thinking,
"Hey, I bet there are some sfravers going to Siggraph".  And ya know, I was
right. :-)

Any SF Ravers want to do a collective storming of the Siggraph show floor?
Electronic theater?  Parties?  Lunch?  Anyone on an expensive account we
can sponge off of?

One of the things that bothers me about Siggraphs are there are too many
stuffy type types and not enough kool kids types.  I mean the only true use
for computer graphics is RAVE GRAPHICS.  Dinosaurs and mouthwash commercials
are only a side line.

Let's see.  If I don't pay my property taxes, the government kicks me
out and "sells" the land to someone else, or maybe just keeps it for
itself.  All "landowners" have a landlord -- the US government.

What, then, are property taxes, if not rent?

> who owns the land (the people or the government), 

Right now the government does, because it can take your land for many
reasons.  Maybe there's a pot plant growing on it.  Maybe they really
want to build a road through there, or expand a military base.  Maybe
it's now a wetland so your house is illegal.  

I believe in private property, but I do not believe in land ownership.
You cannot own land any more than you can own the wind.  Look around
(at someplace not defaced by concrete, please).  Walk up to a tree and
tell it, in all seriousness, "I _own_ this tree.  You are now mine, and
must do as I say."  Tell the grass not to go to seed.  Tell the birds
to shut up because they're disturbing your late sleeping habits.  Tell
the bear not to fish in your stream and take your Power Bars.

Poot.

Land is not just a square of dirt and rock: land is a complex web of 
growth, death, and rebirth of thousands and thousands of different kinds
of plant, animal, mineral, gas, and whatever else.  We are part of this
web.  Our actions change it, and its actions change us.  If you hack down
an acre of rainforest to graze cattle for Jack In The Box, it erodes into
the stream or depletes itself of nutrients in 2-3 years (average arability
for clear-cuts of tropical rainforest).  If you spew enough pollution into
the air from cars, it gets hard to breathe and you die of cancer.  If the
Sahara spreads in Africa, climate can change in China or Britain.

If we persist in thinking that we can own land, that we can use it up and
discard it like a worn-out sock, we will choke to death in our own shit.
You can't throw anything "away" -- there _is_ no "away".  You can pay 
someone else to take the consequences for a while, but the earth is not
infinite.  Gods, we can't even go OUTSIDE without getting skin cancer!
Where's my right to walk in the sunlight without contracting a fatal
disease?  Where's my right to drink water from the stream without falling
sick or being poisoned?  Where's my right to breathe air that won't kill
me just as fast as cigarettes?

I know where it went.  People (Kodak, Monsanto, ConAgra, GM, me, you, etc.)
thought they "owned" land, and could use it up without anything bad happening.
Well, the Industrial Revolution dropped a big brick into the web, and we're
just starting to feel the bounce-back.

Why is it that we have to work so hard and go so far just to find a place to
dance outdoors?  This alone should say something.

To use a baseball metaphor, which people seem to understand ("three strikes"):
The Earth bats last.

> and (dis)respecting other people's
> ownership rights, etc.

What is that "right", in this case?  Someone gave someone else a bunch of
little green pieces of paper, and signed something at the county clerk,
and gives more pieces of paper to the government every so often in exchange 
for them agreeing to chase off
anyone else?  Why is this series of rituals more compelling than dancing
all night, which does a lot more people good?

Whose magic do you believe?  The magic of mortgage, lien, and enclosure,
or the magic of dance, moonlight, and agape?  Choose wisely.

Kinda late, I know, but my friend Ali asked if I'd post, so here ya go:

Sunset, July 2nd, Ali lost her 35mm camera at Sunset.

A note was posted on her car by some people found it, but since she 
wasn't around they took it with them so it would be safe.

If anyone has any info on who these people are, or how they can be 
contacted, please call Ali at: 415.323.9700

Thanks!

Hmm, psychodelics are the next big thing eh?  I'll put the marketing
guys on it ASAP..   :-)

But anyways, "me too".

I'll be at SIGGRAPH as well this year and am wondering where the
parties will be.  I'm not into the sneak-into-abandoned-warehouses
segment of the rave scene but would love to find out about good
hardcore techno playing in L.A. clubs that week.

Last year (in Orlando) there was a very fun SGI/Alias/Apple party at
Typhoon Lagoon where D'Cuckoo played (followed by a DJ playing house
& modern pop), a pathetic disaster of a party put on by ILM at some
club, and a GREAT come-unity-esque party put on by the "ACM local
SIGGRAPH chapters" at another local club.  Some people named Bruce &
Karmi also threw a raging event one night, renting out the entire
Disney/MGM-studios theme park from midnight-5am and using it for a
huge park-wide festival party.  Wow.

So if this year lives up to what happened last year..

Allan

Dear SFRaves Folks

 I just received a message from "Peter S. Russell" <russell@psrinc.com> 
, he wants to know if I want to buy his book . The cost of the book is 
$395 (plus shipping). The thing is , he says he thought I might be 
interested in his book because of a recent post I made. I was wondering
if this fellow is an SFRaver , or else someone who saw my posting at
some other newsgroup.

 Thanks -

	The following is the article on ravers in England and their 
experience with the heavy hand of the law I promised to post.  It is a 
photocopy that was given to me -- if anyone recognizes it and happens to 
know the original publication it came from (what the "NSS" referred to 
twice in the article stands for), I'd be interested in learning.  
	This isn't the first or only piece I've seen on this subject.  
There was a fascinating story in I believe it was URB magazine about a 
major bust of a party in (Milwaukee, Minnesota?) that was a classic case 
of government repression in action.  But I see the experience of the 
Exodus collective as just as important, even though it happened elsewehere.  
Read on...

The Exodus dance collective holds peaceful parties and wants to cooperate
with the police.  Yet thousands of youngsters will soon be criminalised,

(body of article starts here)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			RAVING INJUSTICE

	The Woodside industrial estate, near Dunstable, is dead at night, 
warehouses silent, no houses nearby.  But around midnight every Saturday 
it's the place to be for Bedfordshire youth.  Last week, there were 
2,000-3,000 people waiting patiently, cars nose to tail on both sides of 
the road and filling the car parks.  It's loud but orderly, the whole 
show marshalled by Bigs and his merry band of lieutenants.  "Ye kaan park 
there, that's dangerous, man, pull over, you wanna cause some kin'e of 
accident?"  Bigs is a "dread".  You don't disobey him, but his heart is gold.
	Bigs' "real" name is Paul Taylor.  He's from Exodus, the Luton 
dance and squatting collective.  Exodus' community farm was raided in 
January 1993 and all its equipment seized.  Police claim to have found 
Ecstasy tabs valued at (British Pounds)2,200.  Bigs was found not guilty 
earlier this year of possession with intent to supply.
	Supporters claim that police planted the drugs as part of a 
series of police operations (see NSS, 24 June) costing over (British 
Pounds)100,000, which, if successful, would have stopped the dances and 
destroyed the collective.  A senior serving police officer, chief 
inspector Mike Brown, who was negotiating with Exodus for licensed 
venues, has said there was political pressure to "get on the case."  He 
was given an hour's notice of the change of policy from negotiation to 
confrontation, "jaw jaw" being turned into "war war", as he put it.
	Exodus survived, not least because 4,000 supporters surrounded 
Luton police station after the raid on the farm, demanding the release of 
those arrested and the return of their equipment.  Now Exodus is back, 
busy putting on what it calls "demonstrations of the need for parties."  
There has been a dearth of parties and festivals this year, especially of 
the free variety.  Most police forces have been keeping a strict eye out 
for anything but the smallest and best-hidden "dos", seizing PA equipment 
and turning back punters as though the Criminal Justice and Public Order 
Bill, which will outlaw such events, was in force already.
	Around 12:45am, the Blue Star taxi firm brings the word to 
Woodside.  Lee is driving.  He's a dead ringer for George Micheal and has 
been helping Exodus stay mobile free of charge since the parties began.  
People wander back to their cars, engines fire up, and we're off, headed 
by the Exodus Land-Rover, green with a bright red star on the bonnet.  
>From the back of the Land-Rover, at a steady 30 miles an hour, it's an 
extraordinary sight, headlights stretching endlessly into the distance.  
Police sources reckoned the convoy to be more than 300 cars long.  
Someone said to me at the 24 July anti-Criminal Justice Bill 
demonstration: "You can't oppose oppression by dancing."  Yet there's the 
reply, lined out behind the jeep.  Dance mobilises youth in huge 
numbers.  As Billy Bragg put it, "Dance gives people a sense of 
community, a sense of togetherness that's lacking in our society."
	The Land-Rover indicates left, pulls up by the entrance to a 
narrow track, and Bigs jumps down, starting to wave people in almost 
before his feet touch the ground.  The car behind has been briefed where 
to lead the convoy so no roads are blocked, and the track is kept open in 
case of any emergencies.  A smartly dressed, white-haired man turns in.  
Bigs asks him if he's going to the dance.  He shakes his head, evidently 
confused as to how he ended up in a traffic jam at one o'clock in the 
morning.  Bigs makes space for him to get back out again.
	Up in the lane, the outline of a circular sandpit gradually 
emerges from the darkness, 500 metres across, surrounded by trees, cars 
parked on the far side, people settling into the dance on the near side.  
Glenn Jenkins is on the mike, Exodus spokesperson rapping to the tribal 
beat: "Public order section five/Government ready to take a dive/All 
tribes out there comin' alive."  There are at least 3,000 people out 
here, at the third party since Exodus restarted.  And that's without 
advertising, just a message a few days before on one phone line -- the 
bush telegraph.
	
	What is happening here in Bedfordshire focuses the spotlight on 
the massive problems of the Criminal Justice Bill.  "Thousands of 
Bedfordshire's young people are regularly doing something now that in 
three months time will make them criminals," explains Jenkins.  "We want 
discussions held with the police and the council to show that imposition 
of this bill by force to stop the parties would be madness.  What we're 
proposing is sanctioned gatherings, places where free parties and 
festivals can be held in accord with the authorities.  This is a real 
opportunity for an accord, rather than imprisoning and criminalising 
people.  We want Bedfordshire to be an anti-Criminal Justice Bill zone."  
Exodus is also waiting for planning permission on a large warehouse owned 
by P & O where it plans to establish a community centre and hold 
fortnightly licensed dances in winter.  This would help build up 
equipment for the free outdoor parties, more stalls, a fire engine.  
Exodus is more aware of safety considerations than most commercial 
outfits I've seen.
	The Bedfordshire police have already tried *de facto* to 
implement the Criminal Justice Bill through their previous operations 
against Exodus, blocking roads, trying to seize equipment and ban parties 
before they've begun.  They stopped the parties for a while, but not the 
demand.  And their actions are now being severely criticised.  Exodus' 
local Labour county councilor John Jefferson put a motion for "a full 
public inquiry into the Bedfordshire police's activities against members 
of the Exodus collective" to the Bedfordshire Police Committee.  Despite 
Labour and Liberal Democrat support, the committee's magistrate members 
voted with the Tories to defeat it.  Jefferson is now taking his motion 
to a full county council meeting.
	Exodus is insistent on an inquiry.  "The police have got to be 
made answerable so what they've done doesn't happen again," says 
Jenkins.  He is suspicious of recent police appointments, moving 
hard-line officers into positions previously occupied by officers keen to 
negotiate solutions.  An attempt by NSS to obtain an interview with 
Bedfordshire Chief Constable Alan Dyer was at first agreed and then 
refused.  When we asked Dyer about current policy towards Exodus parties, 
he pleaded ignorance to the fact that they were even happening.
	Meanwhile, at the entrance to the dance, Bigs is giving two local 
police "some lyrics" for trying to drive in without asking.  They are 
invited to come in on foot, on their own or accompanied, "for a cup of 
tea," but they refuse.  As they drive off, a barrel-chested figure on a 
bicycle swoops out of the darkness, says he's local and has heard "faint 
music".  He disappears up the track to see what is happening, to 
re-emerge about an hour later.  His name is David Taylor, an 
ex-policeman, now a fish merchant.  He stays chatting for over an hour 
and leaves his phone number.  He has a policeman's eye for detail.
	"I didn't feel at any time intimidated or frightened," he tells 
me.  "It was very orderly -- they even had a post with a red cross on 
it.  There was no menace, no idiots running about causing aggravation.  
And I didn't see any dealing.  There were some very young girls wandering 
around, but I think they were quite safe.  I got the feeling that the 
people at the gate could deal with any situation that arose.  They were 
running it very professionally.  Although I found the music crap."
	Returning home the next day, he asked around fellow villagers, 
whom police say reported noise complaints.  Two local newspapers reported 
"a flood of calls" and "a storm of protest" from local residents.  The 
district council has received six complaints.  Area environmental health 
officer Janet Wallace, who was called out by the police, says "there was 
a noise nuisance", that in some 70 houses was "unacceptably loud, like 
listening to your neighbour's barbecue".  She says the site was left 
"scrupulously clean" and that there was no further disturbance to the area.

	David Taylor's experience bicycling round the area that night was 
somewhat different.  "The people in the village had no idea it was going 
on.  It was just something faint coming from somewhere, nobody knew 
where.  We live eight miles from Woburn, where people like Tina Turner 
and Neil Diamond play.  You can hear those.  If you'd said to anybody, me 
included, before it happened, that there was going to be 3,000-4,0000 
people coming to your village tonight for a big party, you'd immediately 
think, I'm going to get my car broken into, my house burgled, there's 
going to be spaced out junkies everywhere.  It's fear of the unknown."
	I asked Taylor about the anti-rave provisions of the Criminal 
Justice Bill.  "If I want to have 200 people turn up on my land and do 
whatever, I should be allowed to do it.  You should be allowed to do 
anything you want that really can't be construed as detrimental to 
people's well-being in the near vicinity."  Taylor's final comment is 
disturbing given his first-hand knowledge of the police:  "Before long, 
everybody will get nicked.  I can just see it, busloads of police, wading 
in, crash helmets, big night sticks, a few dogs.  Because at the moment, 
Exodus is one up on the police -- not so much one up, but I think the 
police would think that."
	DJ Hazard is playing in the sandpit, tribal beats shaking bodies 
and minds.  Bigs has finished his marshalling duties at the gate and is 
quoting lyrics from Lynton Kwesi Johnson.  It starts to rain.  Tarpaulins 
are swiftly hung over the decks and PA.
	*"Even though they think they're bold/We know they're cold like 
ice with fear..."*
	The air feels fresh, the haze of dry red sand stirred up by 
stamping feet washed away.  Suddenly there's a flash and a great clap of 
thunder.  The crowd goes bananas.  "...And we are F-I-R-E."
	"When we say 'they' we're talking government," explains Jenkins, 
a former train driver and Aslef shop steward.  This transformation from 
union organiser to Exodus spokesperson gives him a unique insight into 
both old and new politics.  "We know they're worried, even though they 
give an impression of confidence.  The fire is the power of resistance of 
sound systems allied to community groups like us.  We're going to melt 
their Criminal Injustice law."
	Exodus is proposing a "blueprint for civic peace" in 
Bedfordshire, a Criminal Justice Bill-free zone.  Jenkins elaborates.  
"By the time the Criminal Justice Bill comes into force, we hope to have 
been involved in negotiations not just with our local police force, but 
with Liberty, local councilors and MPs.  We want to have a big 
round-table discussion on this issue.  The government's proposals for 
making us criminals and forcing the police into confrontation again can't 
be in anyone's best interests.  To do anything else when young people 
could be criminalised and have their heads cracked is criminal."
	Jenkins' argument is especially strong given the recommendations 
of the government's Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs.  In a 
suppressed report recently leaked to Duncan Campbell of the *Guardian*, 
the council said:  "We believe there are dangers in over-regulation and 
in resorting to the criminal law, which may well lead to conflict 
between young people and the authorities.  We recommend that the 
organisation of more legal raves be encouraged by local authorities 
exercising maximum discretion in the granting of licenses and by 
involving responsible organisers of raves in the process."
	I bumped into Eggy by the gate at dawn, 18 years old and wearing 
a legalise cannabis T-shirt.  A year ago he came to live at the derelict 
old people's home that Exodus had squatted.  They have a council license 
to occupy it now, as they do for the community farm.  Thirty people live 
there, with money from the dances being used to pay for repairs.  Eggy 
used to be in the army cadets.  He's called Eggy because that's how his 
shaved skull used to look.  I've heard what he says repeated in hundreds 
of different ways by hundreds of different people up and down the 
country.  Most politicians haven't heard it.  Most newspaper editors 
haven't heard it.  But among the coalition of groups protesting against 
the Criminal Justice Bill, the road protesters, travellers, squatters and 
ravers, the word is spreading swiftly.  "If they put through this 
Criminal Justice Bill thing, then everyone will rebel.  I'm going to 
watch it, see our freedom come.  In this way, the Criminal Justice Bill 
is positive, it's beautiful."  Standing in the half light, I ask Eggy 
what this is all for, the parties, Exodus, the struggles.  "We're doing 
it to save the youth, to save the people," he insists.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(end reprinted article)

	Although this may be a couple years old at my best guess, and I'm not 
sure how things have gone across the Atlantic since it was written, I do 
think it offers us some valuable lessons/reminders to draw on:

	(1) It is possible to stand up for your rights and be successful.
	(2) There is strength in numbers, and we have the numbers on our 
	    side, if we make use of them.	
	(3) Ravers will be more effective at preserving our right to 
	    party if we make common cause with others who have grievances 
	    with the government and work on coalition-building.
	(4) They will try to outlaw peaceful outdoors dancing, given the 
	    opportunity.

	A final note -- it may sound to some of you like I'm saying the 
government is our enemy.  I am.  :)  However, the individual people who 
make up the government are not.  I believe we should make every effort to 
extend to them the same love, respect, and compassion we would show other 
ravers.  They are human too, and I feel if they understand us better and 
do not see us as a threat, they would be more likely to respect our 
rights.  Fight the power, not the people.  Love on!
	
	One more time for liberty,

        Reply to:   RE>>Moon Light
Actually, I'd be suprised if anyone actually reads this by now, but...

Tell me again why we can't just ask the landowner's permission or even 
pay a rent? I mean, I have a lot of sympathy for the idea that only the 
earth owns the land, but I'd be pissed too if I came home to find someone  
throwing a party in my apartment (and I wasn't invited).

While I was living in New Mexico, I went to a number of outdoor events 
that were held on rented land. At least one of the landowners concerned 
was unrelated by family or friendship, just a guy who the organizers 
approached, who thought it sounded harmless enough, and gave them a key 
to the gate. It may give you a warm feeling to cut a deal with the cops 
when you're legally grey, but it's also fun to smile and wave at the police 
chopper spotlighting you while you're partying on private land with the 
owner's permission.

Maybe I'm ignorant of the local laws or the character of the local 
landowners, but wouldn't it be nice to smile before, during, and after the 
event (and maybe even get the cops to smile too!).

This is too funny.  I for one want to hear more from this "Peter S. 
Russell".  Anybody who's got the chutzpah to try to sell Larry an 
unsolicited $395.00 book based on a post he made can't be entirely 
without redeeming qualities.

Did he perhaps think you needed some reading material to share at the 
South Bay Lunch?  :)-

Dear Starchild,

I'm from San Diego area and the way I've been collecting the flyers is by going
to places that carry them.  I also have some friends in the LA area that collect
them for me.  I've already tried leaving my name and address on their voice mail
but they have never sent me any. 

I'm trying to cover my bedroom walls with rave flyers. So far I think I have
about 500 of them.  I'm willing to swap flyers with you.  Next time I  see some
I'll make sure I get one for you too.

*HUGS*

You're right, I've tried to leave my name and address on promoters voicemail and
they've never sent me any.  I'm willing to swap flyers with you.  I'll send you
any new flyer that I get. My address is:

Keihan Rafii
9369-F Discovery Way 
La Jolla, CA 92037

Unfortunately I dont have any of Mark E Quark's tapes. If you are interested
I'll try to get copies of some of his tapes for you.

Correction: the Moontribe gathering is *tonite* (wed.).  No one yet has
directions, but is shouldnt be too hard to join us: simply drive about 2
hours straight east of LA into the desert and thats where we'll be!  :)  :)

my guess would bE that progrEss is the thing; i went to the first 2 and the
2nd 1 was absolutEly wondErful (great non-club space, no busts, fabulous happY

you know, I'm getting really sick of this.  Just because people want quick
and easy access to their e-mail is no reason to equate them with National
Enquirer readers, and those avid watchers of the Price is Right.  Talk about
broad generalizations... get over it, that's not what the whole spirit of
this list is about at ALL... geez, to be considered less in someones eyes
because of the way they access e-mail!  I use Eudora and other such things,
but I find this is quick and easy, without any hassle, it doesn't diminish my
computer skills, but when you're working, and a student, you don't always
have time .  Enough said, the comments just seemed extremely childish.

Not that it really matters, but here's my defensive knee-jerk:

I've been on this list for years, blah, blah, blah.  Like Jon, my account is
free since I maintain a forum for the comapny I work for on AOL.  Yes I am
reading my sfraves mail when I'm supposed to be working :-) And AOL does own
the Internet in a sense -- along with MCI they now have primary resposibility
for the backbone since the NSF dropped it.  But its that AOL kiddie porn that
makes it all worth while ;-)

Tell it sistah! House music is based on itself. Techno is based on an
approach to sound. So many people associate it with the four on the floor,
92-93 pop-techno a la Charly or Anasthasia that burnt them out through
imitation (the House mode of progress). Heck, I hate that shit too. But
techno, in its purest sense, is the music that tries not to repeat the past,
continually bringing up new sounds and rhythms. Techno is the music that gets
copied.

Dear All;

	 I would just like to apologize to the list for the post regarding
David Alves & other, sorry, I unforturately let them get the best of
me(the pride that divides), and theres no good excuse for letting that
happen. Also, I will ***not*** be posting NON-Rave stuff through hyperreal
anymore, again sorry. Although if you are on my general distrubtion list
you may still get a NON_Rave related post from me, so if you don't want 
one of those, please let me know now, and I'll take you off, cause if you've 
posted at least once to sfraves, you are on that list.

Nah, that's just our inability to evolve (which includes the failure to use
our big brains and bigger tools to find a way to survive in a modified climate)

Ownership is a moot point.  There is no such thing as a planetary norm, it's
been changing ever since the cosmic dust started clumping together due to
gravity.  Feel free to cut down all the trees... just realize that you may have
to live in a dome or splice your genes so that you can photosynthesize.

Rights are a moot point.  You're a monkey, and you've got to learn to make the
best of your situation.  Some of us feel that working together and with
feelings of PLUR make the world a better place to live in.  Others feel
differently.  This will always be so.  Deal with it.

I don't see any effort being put forth to find a solution to this problem; all
I see is short term greed ($) outweighing long term greed (survival of yourself
and your descendents).

Our biology is incredibly complex -- we still don't know all the chemicals we
need to ingest daily in order to function correctly over a lifetime.  I think
it presumptuous to assume that we can reduce the earth's biodiversity by 90%
or more (as we are doing) and not take out something vital to us.

Besides, is it necessary to burn down your house to prove you've grown up
and can leave it?

We agree here.  I see a bunch of people complaining that ecological sustain-
ability will require major changes in their lives, not realizing that their
current life of blind consumption will require even more drastic change for
survival.

Yes.  So maybe part of that is raising my little electronic hand and saying,
"Hey, let's think about this, and maybe do something about it."  I have no
interest in becoming a replacement government or other coercive institution.
So what else is there?  Communication.

Were you born into "the scene"?  Neither was I.  I found out about it 
through communication; people talking (and typing) about their beliefs.
"This will always be so, deal with it" sounds suspiciously like a sales
pitch for fatalism.  I _know_ other people will believe differently, I 
didn't just fall off the turnip truck -- but at least it's there for
people to read instead of me just sitting in my room thinking "Damn, 
everything's so fucked up." which does no one any good, including me.

Hello,

Here are 3 recent CDs that I've enjoyed (all are US domestic releases and all
contain a mix of dance and ambient tracks) :

- Transmission from the Planet Dog

This is 2 CDs for *less* than the usual price of 1 , a compilation of 4
Planet Dog artists - Eat Static, Banco de Gaia, Timeshard and Children of the
Bong.

- G Spot   by   Speedy J

The best yet by Speedy J.  The ambient tracks are roughly similar to Global
Communication, and his dance tracks (techno) are excellent, much improved.

- The Trip-Hop Test (Part One)

Some of the tracks seem to be what I would consider Trip-Hop (ie Hip-Hop with
Techno/House sensibilities, ie Trippier), but some of this is also ambient,
and other tracks are yet their own style of techno.  Almost all of it is
excellent music, in any event...

Enjoy,

Ken

Basically I move around in my musical tastes. It was just a phase for me,
it may mean more to others.  That does not make my experience any less
valid than anyone elses.  Nor does it make my experience any more valid
than anyone elses.  All I said was do something about it.  You can analyze
the hell out of something with little to show for such an intellectual
effort (i.e. mental masturbation).  If you like techno fine.  I no longer
get into it like i used to.  I don't like fast music either, but that's my
taste.  I respect everyones taste.  Maybe some understanding instead of
preaching to the choir is necessary.


To each his own...I thought this was a dead horse by now, but once again I
am worng.  Obviously there are not enough soap factories around these days
;).

I'm out,
John

P.S.  All that really matters is that you catch your own groove and create
a good vibe.  To me it's near 120-124.  *YOUR* mileage may vary...

	I tend to disagree both with the statement that nothing 
"graceful" (that which produces vibe?) is going to come out of 160 bpm, 
and with this stuff about it taking several hours before the "vibe" comes 
out. Try starting with something slow but stomping (yes, stomping you 
see, a good kick drum is very important) and pick the pace up. I have 
seen the bpms go from hmm, 130ish to 190 in 90 minutes and people go 
through the roof. And who says there cannot be "soul" or feeling in fast, 
stompy beats... Jungle is fast and stomping and full of emotion (well, 
the good stuff is). Like any music, if it is done well, there will be 
more there than insane sounds (but those can be amazing as well)... If 
stompy won't do it for you, look at the hard trance that the Low Spirit 
djs spun, that had feeling, was fast, and harder, and very nice in me 
little opinion.

	3 to 4 hours to break down the ego?! Some of the most amazing 
times I have had, have been in the basements under this old city, a place 
called the Vaults, would get there around 10 to get in the queue, get in 
about 11 when it opened, and stay til it closed at 3 am. It didn't take 4 
to break down egos there, maybe the faster, stompier music had something 
to do with that. I don't mean to be negative, but everything seems to be 
looked at as good, even as the limits close in once again. I was spinning 
at a little party, some pretty fast stuff (~180 bpm) and this guy told me 
he hadn't heard stuff like that since 89 out here. `89?! I didn't know 
180 bpm techno was coming out then, much less that it was being played in 
SF (but in 89 I was no where to be seen, and wouldn't have like that 
repetitive shit if I had known about it then ;) )

Subject: Full Moon Rave outcome from last night?

Well, I went down there to Santa Cruz last night to the Full Moon event.
The site was really, really, really beautiful.

It was a bit amusing that the speaker cables didn't show up (at least they
still hadn't by the time I was giving up and leaving at 4:30am!) but since
there was no music/dancing, I just spent more time exploring the area. I'd
like to go back there for some events in the future. It's definitely one of
those scenic places you see and tell yourself, *this* is the California
that I love!

A lot of the people there were freaking out thinking that I was a police
officer because my Chevron jacket evidently looks just like a police
jacket. I got a uniformly cold reception until (that is *if* in many cases)
they looked close enough or got up the nerve :) to talk to me that they
would see that I was there to party just like they were! I really like
wearing that jacket because it's so warm but the recurring downside is
being mistaken for an authority figure. :)

Any comments from anybody else that went?

I completely agree... Just because something is fast doesn't mean it's not 
graceful, or that you cannot move gracefully to it. It's all a matter of 
easing yourself into the rhythm, and not feeling compelled to follow every 
single beat. I also find that a lot of the hard fast stuff, like the German 
hardtrance techno and goa is absolutely filled with "soul" and beauty, 
albeit soul and beauty of a very different interpretation than what is 
found in more housey oriented stuff. Personally, hardtrance moves me
physically, spiritually and intellectually the way no other type of
music does. I find it totally trance inducing.

It seems that ever since someone posted that he felt some of the good 
reviews were redundant, it seems like there haven't been as many rave 
reviews.  I could be wrong about this, maybe people aren't going to that 
many partys lately.
I just want to say that I like reading about what people have to say 
about the partys, even if its redundant.  Having said that, I'll give you 
a brief review of the gardening club last monday.
I've only been there once before and it was very crowded.  With markie 
and jeno spinning I expected a good crowd.  It turned out to be pretty 
sparse for the time I was there from about 12-2:30.  The music was good, 
and the conversation was good, would have been nice to have some more people.
Thats all for now, hope to you this weekend or tonight at 1015 folsom 
where I'm soon to be heading.

Subject:  labels and anger other thoughts
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

Hey everyone,

i just was reading a lot of the things on this list and I was struck by a
couple of things. It seems that some people bring a lot of personal shit
and anger to this list. I think we all have a lot of stuff like that for
some it comes out here because they don't have to see someones face as they
read something posted as an assault on them. Thats a problem with this
medium, it can't communicate emotions very well; and some people need to
feel empathy with someone who will read their negative post that becomes an
attack. After all we ALL share some of the same feelings about raves. I'm
not even going to attempt to define them. They are common threads running
through everyones experience that are inherently positive. That is why we
put up with this list even, when it degenerates into name calling and
wounded egos. We can maybe put some balance back into this list by maybe
posting more about the great times everyone had. I'm not saying everything
has to be happy, I just think we could all use a couple more positive
posts.

Also it seems like their is a lot of derogatory labeling going on.  The
next time you find yourself thinking something along the lines of "Gee,
goddamn hippies(or anyother word that trys to classify groups of people),
they are so fucked up(or any other broad derogatory statement)" try and
think of as many characteristics of that group of people as you can.  For
Example,
Hippie-
Someone who loves the earth
Someone who gets high
Someone who loves to dance
Someone who thinks they can change the world
Someone who thinks that they have something to offer
Someone that thinks hugging(even kissing) people you don't know is a good thing
Someone who trips into new places
and anything anyone can say that  makes someone a true "hippie"

These are all things that I have seen or heard refering to hippies in a
negative way. I think we can always find a way to relate to most people by
looking for the common thread. We all know what it is like to be
classified, and stereotyped and put in a box. For me raving isn't about
putting people in boxes. Its lifting us up beyond the boundries that we
have between ourselves. Letting the love that people naturally have in them
come out in a frenzy of dancing, hugging, and talking and much more. But,
labeling people makes it hard for this to always manifest itself. Still i
find it more on this list than I do in the raves that I have gone to. Some
people have a hard time adjusting to communication when the music isn't
pumping and they aren't in an altered state. But I do see a lot of good
things going on which is why I still like this list so much. It creates a
good sense of community. Its good to learn from all of the positive as well
as negitive things that are happening. Thank you.

Hugs, kisses and love
Gabe

ps-I hope I didn't write anything that seems like I was saying "I know THE
WAY, just do this follow the TRUE path" Sometimes its hard to communicate
ourpersonal perceptions without it sounding as though we have it all
figured out. Maybe I should practice saying things like "I think it might
be" rather than "it is!" anyways I'm rambling. goodnight.

You're not looking hard enough.  There are political parties that pursue a
more enlightened environmental stance (example... the greens), and scientific
research of all sorts is constantly ongoing.

Yes, but beside the fact that I think you're preaching to the choir here, this
is a *rave* mailing list.

But it *will* always be so, and you *must* deal with it.  Personally, I try
to drive my car into work as little as possible, preferring my bicycle as a
more green mode of transportation.  It's a little difficult as I live 2,000'
above where I work and I need to ride a short way along the busy highway 17,
but I persist, because I feel that it's right.  I'm also a member of the
Greens, which advocates grass-root political activism and has what I believe
is a proper view of what government should do for us.  I deal with it.  I
also believe that this thread isn't quite the proper way to deal with it, so
I'll drop it here, and I'll suggest that you try to find more constructive
ways to deal with saving the planet.  Just remember, while you're saving
trees here by not doing this with paper, the electricity generated to give us
this form of communication is largely produced by coal and oil burning
generators :-).  Damn, caught raping the planet again....

Subject: Pre-Burning Man Get Together
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

     Well, as previously mentioned a while back, I'd like to get a bunch of 
     us together prior to Burning Man to address some of our local needs so 
     we can have more fun and less trouble having to think about the 
     following:
     
     water
     rides
     tent space
     meals
     
     Coming to this gathering _doesn't_ mean that you have to share 
     anything at Burning Man.  It's just meant to connect people who are 
     going _and_ providing a forum for those who want to address some of 
     these needs.  
     
     Let's do it in two weeks (7/23) around 5pm at Sunset.  Look for a 
     white kid's bedsheet w/brightly colored numbers towards the right-side 
     of the the speakers (facing the dj, that is).  If you can't go but 
     want a ride or something, e-mail me privately and I'll make your needs 
     known when we meet.
     
     Looking forward to meeting some of you sfravers whom I haven't met 
     before.
     
     Hugs,
     Diane
     
     P.S. If anyone is driving from Reno, there's someone out there who 
     needs a ride.  E-mail me and I'll hook you two up!

Gabe,
Nice post.  
Personally I like most of what comes out on this list including the personal 
conflicts that arise.  What I also like about this list is that the 
personal conflicts don't usually last too long, where there is usually 
someone like yourself that comes foward to give the group another focus 
of what we have in common in addition to our differences.  Like you said, 
it all helps give a good sense of community.
I think that some of the conflicts on this list helps us get to know one 
another a little better as individuals.  What I also like about this list 
is that it usually doesn't take to long for MOST of the people to be able 
to rise above the conflict and experience that common bond that you 
mentioned that draws most of us to this list giving us a sense of harmony 
along with the conflict and chaos.

:)
peter

I'll be passing out the new Tandy Acid-O-Meter, which will hopefully
also register pH 0.0, i.e. very acidic.

The nice thing is that when you mix acid with bass, a startling,
explosive reaction often occurs.

Dear All;

	They were compared with Depeche Mode, Tangerine Dream, The Yello
Magic Orchestra, Kraftwork, and Brian Eno to name but a few. They are/were
definately one of the many significant pioneers of all electronically
produced music, & the hypnotic groove, yet touched many different genre's
from noise, to gothic & punk, to popular dance, and you will still findem 
on many a ravers shelf. 

	So whatever happened to New Order, anyone got a clue, anyone
really care besides myself, I hope so, else keep flames to yourselfs, I've
had my share for the year. I have a bunch of their CD's, most of which are
fried from too much play, and need to be replaced.  Listening to the
music, though a little on the dark side, is still fresh I think, even
after a decade, for I still like a ggod mix of digital & analog in my
diet. One of my favorite songs; True Faith, got me through a lot of tuff
times, for never have lyrics/music been written that so acturately
reflected a part of my life.

AAAAH... thanks for reminding me.
I was of course being facetious with my list,
but swing is an ingredient that could *really* work.
In fact, one of the most sublime experiences I have 
ever had on E was dancing to 1930s swing....
Now I'm inspired to create some kind of electronic mutation...
actually, I have written / arranged for a big band
in the past.   I'll keep you posted!

yes, I am familiar with Martin Denny.  I was lucky 
enough to grab a bunch of his records at thrift stores 
before this whole lounge thing took off and they started 
showing up at collectors stores for $25 +  :(
By the way, anyone interested in having a really warped
lounge experience should hear my friend Glenn spin at 
downhear next Wednesday.  He has warned us all that he 
is going to go off!

Dear All;

	Regarding house, I think my friends the Dead Milkmen sum it all up in 
just one statement:

		(Warning, This Is An Attempt At Being Silly)

		"I'm an artfag, and can dance to anything."

Don't say I didn't warn you - the Cool World party will be large, expensive,
and commercial, even if their DJ list is tempting.  However, I don't see
any sure bets this weekend until Sunset on Sunday.  Some of the other
parties could be cool, but it's guesswork for now.  

FYI, the KZSU link off this web page seems to have a lot of local music info.

That reminds me of when I went to the Halloween Friends & 
Family..Dressed as a cop!  Boy did I get some funny looks.  I had lots 
of room to dance, though.  Now that was a *really* scary costume!

They had a record out recently.  I've lost interest in them(not that I 
was a big fan in the first place) because they've become musically 
stagnant.  They sound pretty much the same that they did 10 years ago and 
are saying the same things.  Maybe if whassisname keeps taking his 
Prozac, they'll make a decent record again.  (He's taking it to "boost his 
creativity).

	Heres the list from cdconnection.com.

	I have the republic and spooky albums, and really like them -- kind 
of pop house, maybe a couple tracks could be called dark but they may 
have lightened up...  "true faith" is on the "best of" which just came out...  I 
don't see anything really new since republic though ('93).

PS looks like the album of "spooky" remixes I have is out of print.

I went to Oasis in downtown San Jose last night (wednesday) and had a
good time.  Kinda housey and a bit clubby but the feelings were
good.  Bernard was spinning a more techno-laden set than his usual,
similar in spirit to what Tracy has played at 1015 recently.  

Song ID please:  is there a half-ravish half-retro song by
Pumpkin-something (pumpkinhead?) called "the bong?"

Anyways, a mainstream-tastes thumb up for Oasis.  I now have an
alternative for those Wednesday nights where I don't feel like
driving up to SF for BAGG at Trocadero..  :-)

>jacket.

Yea my freinds and I saw you and it took us a second look to realize that you
were not the police=o)  Thanks to all who called me to let me know where the
thing was goin down.  I took 2 freinds who had never been to a Rave before
figuring that the full moon would be a great first experiance.  I was kinda
dissapointed it was a rather luke warm event.  I have not been to a full moon
for quite some time and it is not what it used to be.  There seemed to be a
lot of young drunk people ther when I arived at  2:30 and I saw a lot of the
cans etc. hit the beach which I later saw Mark from Ameba picking up...
 right on Mark!  at least someone there was being responsable.  

When the music finaly started around 6am it started off kinda slow with this
kiinda funky beat stuff...  it did not seem to be happining.  Then some of
that good ole four on the floor started happining and so did the party.
 Garth decided to take it back to the beginning of the party with a bunch of
non-solid groove stuff (some acid jazzy stuff slow hipy hoppy stuff etc.).  I
was very disapointed and most of the other people I talked to were also.  My
freinds were complaing about the music and wanted to leave so we did around 8
am.

This kinda brings up an experiance I had while sitting to the side of Dj set
up.  One of the people sitting with us who I had just met was sayingsome
rather interesting things to my friend about the Djs.  Actually it was kinda
disturbing.  He was pointing at all of the Djs and naming them and ranting
about how they were his "idols."    Idols?  What is up with that?  I know
that everyone has a right to there own thing but this kinda illustrates some
things that have been pulling the scene down IMO.  Since when was house or
rave about making idols?  Have we become that much like the rock n roll
world?  Will we end up like that?  I hope not.  My veiw of the rave scene is
that everyone should be important.  We don't need rave stars.  But if you
need to idolize someone why idolize a Dj?  All they do is play records that
other people make and they buy just like everyone else can.  My vote for rave
star for the full moon is Mark from Ameoba for picking up after everyone else
who were too busy dancing or running around with balloons etc.  That was one
of the brightest spots for me of the whole rave.

more + stuff
 I really loved the site and spent most of my time exploring the beach as
many others did.  I hope that there are many other things at this location
cause it is a great one.  In the light of dawn it looked just like a scene
out of KPT Bryce.  Did you all check out the echo of the sound sys off of the
back wall?  That was great!  It was like 2 sound systems the second one being
delayed about a half second from the first.  If you got really close to the
wall (which was a beautifull color of red) you could hear the different
frequencys being reflected off of different layeers of the cliff...   Really
cool...   a 3D sound wall!!!  =o)

See ya

cocktail ambient
hawaiian trance
lounge breakbeat
and don't forget EZ-listening hip hop (check out Coldcut's Autumn Leaves)

I'm actually fascinated with these possible styles and have done a couple
tracks along these lines myself.  They've gotten a suprisingly good response
from friends.

I've always felt there was a nice connection between cocktail/exotica and
modern electronic styles.  Try this:
Listen to Martin Denny's Firecracker then listen to YMO's remake and then
listen to Zero B's or the Shamen's remix of the YMO version(on the YMO
tribute remixes album.)   
RE the swing thing - there's a really neat track on the NinjaTune TripHop and
Jazz CD that has some big band swing over a nicely swung breakbeat(slow) The
rhythm or timing of swing really is the same as that in a lot of house,
hiphop and of course new jack swing(which I finally figured out is what the
British meant by swingbeat.)

Here's some miscellaneous suggestions if you're exploring:
Martin Denny - Exotica (definitive)
Ennio Morricone(his spaghetti western soundtracks are really amazing visual
soundscapes -- soundtracks in general are one of my favourite genres)
Esquivel(big band cocktail - the precision STEREO production, quirky
composition and flawless playing are weirdly reminscent of modern styles)
Les Baxter(cool cocktail cheese - just buy the album with the best cover)
And while we're at it there's some great - almost dub - reverby surf stuff
too(the Guitar Player compilation is good) 
BTW, I think the Orb has used all of the above.
 
Happy Trails!! ;-)

There's something deeply soulful about techno -- a music perceived by many as
the almost, if no entirely, souless.  Perhaps the ultimate expression of a
thing is the total abscence of it.

Yet another full moon madness
=============================

Well,   it got off to a very slow start,   thanx in part to a phuck up 
on the part of the sound crew,   where they must have forgotten or 
misplaced a box of critical cables needed for the sound system.

ut when it did actually start,  it started with some amazingly phat 
phunkey beats that got everyone off their blankets and from their fires 
and filled the dance area very quickly.

There was a Dutch Camara crew there,   doing something on our rave 
scene.    Other than those interruptions,   it went off amazingly well.

Garth started off the funkey beats,  and took things well into daylight 
before Jeno went on.    I was a little disspointed 3/4th the say through 
Garth's set,   especially up until the music stopped (due to a fight 
somewhere towards the hill area).   When Garth finally started up the 
music again,   the beats were better (a little faster),   and even more
people were up there dancing.   When Jeno went on,   things really 
started hopping.    Jeno took things well into the late morning,   
groovin to some amazingly trancey house.   A perect setting for such a 
wonderful day.

Somewhere during Jeno's set,   I went off exploring the cavey cliffs,  
getting off on some of the wonderful visuals that nature provided,  and
sent back to dance the reat of Jeno's set.

Markie mark came over and visited our blanket,  said he was going on 
next,   GREAT!!

When Markey went on,   things really started to hop,  as he slightly 
stepped up the pace a little more and played some really tracey stuff 
that really put my head out there...    

I'm ot sure exactly when Markey finished,  but somehere during his set,  
I took a swim the the ocean (WOW!!  What clear beautiful and COLD 
water).

Anyway,  it was well into the afternoon when the FMR finally finished,  
and Craig helped with the speakers,  lugging them back up the steep 
cliffs.

So concludes yet another sucessful FMR....

Well.......I do disagree.. djs are artist just like musicians.. they take two
tracks from different artists and make a whole new track!!  Mike Banks said
it best..djs take one mans soul and another mans soul and put them
together.....................
 
I will say there are some djs out here(sf) (and other places Im sure)ive
noticed that do just play records, and buy records that anyone can buy..those
arent the djs Im talking about though.

It is in my opinion much much more than that.  If you have ever been in
front of turntables and even just played records "that other people make
..." it can be an incredible, even religious, experience.  If you are able
to match beats and find two records that sound good together the feeling
escalates and, I feel, has no upper limit.  Bringing the_right_song in at
the_right_time can create a entire reality that was not present before you
started.  I personally have had an experiences like this while dj'ing, and
was so astounded/taken back by the shift in my consciousness that I ended up
screwing up the mix and watched the whole feeling/vibe/state of
mind/body/whatever just fade away.  I aspire to experience it more and
control myself once there.  

But, I never thought twice about vinyl until I stated touching it.  In fact,
two years ago I said many-a-time, "I hate records".

Not No More.

Perhaps the similarities don't end there. Raver and flapper have allot more 
in common then just music. Hidden clubs, illegal drugs, fast lifestyle s and 
the presence of emerging technologies. I have always thought we have more in 
common with the flapper lifestyle- then that of the hippy or punk. 

I will definitely pick up the NinjaTune disk- Fluke did a Peel session disk 
recently that has an amazing techno/swing track on it- I can't remember 
the tracks name- but the cd is white- It is well worth a listen to.

huh ?  saying something like that is worse than what the guy said about 
dj idol worship.  and i wouldn't take one persons words and apply it to
the whole scene.  while i wouldnt idolize a dj, i do admire what they do
immensely as i admire the work of any artist or band, especially the 
heavy mixer types.

Here's a thought for ya: some years ago someone was probably sitting around
going "what's this 'acid jazz' I've been hearing about?  You don't mean
they're actually combining good ol' fashioned jazz with that weird new
'rave' music, do you?  Boy, that's pretty funny."

Moral of the story: who knows in which direction music will evolve.  A
friend in the music industry told me that the new up-and-coming style is
hip-easy-listening, sort of Breakfast at Tiffany's with a beat you can dance to.

It was cows and it was on an old road.  We danced our asses off and 
still did not do half of the ammount of compaction to the land as those 
introduced cows did and do.

i could speak multitudes on this subject but i'd like to remind people
that the people who make dance music make it with the dj in mind. they
do *NOT* mind getting no credit by dj's for playing their music. As long
as it gets played, the word will get out and people will buy the
record.usually all it takes is hearing a good record for the masses to
run to their record shops going 'hey have you heard that track that goes
blah blahbla?' to sell thousands upon thousands of records. Alot of dj's
will just *tell* you what he's playing if you ask. The only people out
there making music and bitching about the fact that dj's don't give them
credit are only in it for the money anyway. Trust me. read magazines
liike Musik, the dance sections in Melody Maker or the NME or MIxmag or
DJ. The artists get their respect.

Ok I am kinda surprised that the bigest thing people rememberd about my post
was that I attempted to errode a little of the DJ myth.  I thougt everyone
would have liked my positive idea of making lpeople who pick up trash
heros... but I guess vinal is thicker than your average Hefty bag so here we
go : )

Totaly...  thats how you learn

Well I like to be full of surprises... =o)  I mean nothing bad towards the
people who are DJs I do it too.  I just get a little bent out of shape cause
I think it is a little out of control.   Besides I was not doing much today
so I figured I would start some trouble...  changes happen more often when
there is trouble.  Heh he heh....

Anothe kind soul  writes some support...

Well this was to be expected because Im challengeng the sacered DJ...  

another says...

>i could speak multitudes on this subject but i'd like to remind people
>that the people who make dance music make it with the dj in mind. they
>do *NOT* mind getting no credit by dj's for playing their music. As long

Well  maybe we have changed our minds...  =o)  Yea we do keep Djs in mind and
we put in a lot of things that make DJs look good.  The issue to me is not
totaly "who" gets credit...  it is more that no one gets too much credit...
 I know a lot of people write House and Rave style music are *not* in it for
the money or the recognition...  in fact a lot of them were attracted to the
idea of a NO ROCKSTAR music.  That is why most groups or persons making this
music do not push pictures of them on everything...  even the Orb if you
noticed were not Highly visable at the Warfield... I have seen them 2 times
ther and still can not tell you what they look like other than they have long
hair.  

Next...

>huh ?  saying something like that is worse than what the guy said about

Thanks for all the response and yes I have had 1200s and a Numark for many
years now but not as long as I have actually been making music.  I have
discussed this thread many times here before and my opinion is kinda strong
on it.  I really love house music.  One of the things I like about it is the
lack of huge media figures involved with it...  I take offense to all that
stuff in the Rave scene...  if I wanted that I would go to a Michel Jackson
concert.  It is hard for many to see my point of view and I respect that...  

Yes Djing is fun and it does take some practace but I believe if credit is to
be given it should be to the musicians who pour more money and time into
making that music for DJs to play than I have ever _seen_  a   Dj work on a
set.  As always I will back that up with an open invitation to meet me and
hang out at my studio to see what goes into making the record that the DJ
buys...  which now days he or she seems to get more credit for than the
musician.  

I have only had one or 2 people show any interest in my offer and none have
made it out yet but I assure you that I actually do not bite and love to
share making music with others...  I am tiered of just talking about how
great Djs are...  yes they have their place and they are important (I do it
too)  but I would prefer a scene that does not propmote idoltry and media
commoties...  I want everyone to be important.. I think the musicians have
for the most part have been doing their part by keeping low key.  (but then
again maybe Im just a dreamer)  Hey I would like to discuss this further but
in person would be better...  Ill put up =o)  Of course anyone who wants to
come can bring records too.

For you vicarious partyers...

Wed. night @ 1015 (ie Jack's House) saw a crowd of not 
more than 80 people -- which is no a not necessarily a problem, 
except that there's so much open space @ 1015.  It seemed kind 
of a waste to be having Tony (doin' good in the basement) and Emma (main) 
spin to just a handful of dancers each.  Mystic Bill finished the basement
set w/some ok stuff -- found it hard to dance to tho'.  Things
picked up upstairs when Jeno came on, and continued w/some hard 
Spun beats.  

The crowd looked sorta tired (ie the 50% of the people who
weren't dancing).  Kinda had the semi-party atmosphere of
a weekday weekly, which I was hoping would not be the case. 
Overall, a nice gathering, tho' I didn't see too many of... 
well, dem big grins that I have come to expect @ certain 1015 
parties I've been to. An alright night overall. Good for catching 
up w/friends.      

ps. Might check out Progress on Sat. Bring dem big grins (=

I make music as well.  I know what it takes.  It can come to gether really
easily or take quite a while and alot of effort.

I agree with you on many-a-point.

I don't think we should make idols out of dj's, but mass respect goes out to
the ones out there who really know what there doing, can read a crowd and
work the vibe.  

I don't think we should make idols out of dj's, but I don't think is't fair
to belittle thier(our) "art".  That's all.

I don't dj to be an idol, infact my most incredible dj'ing experiences have
been when I'm alone.

I was waiting for a flight in the Phoenix airport this afternoon, and
watched a bit of the Maury Povich talk show.  The theme was: klub kids!
Despite every effort Maury made to make it seem like clubs are weird
and dangerous, all the "kids" had their shit together, the moms in the
audience (some of whom hadn't seen how their kids actually dress up)
were flustered but not unappreciative, and it was really kind of cool.

Povich mentioned they had tried to take videotape at a rave and were
denied (yay!).  Other than that, what can you say when every single kid
they interviewed was either working or in school and ready to go to NYU
or something :-)

Then the OJ trial came back from recess and they cut the show off halfway
through, so I stopped watching . . .

It seems pretty unlikely to me that there was 180 bpm *anything* in 1989.
Remember, it was 1991 before the 140 bpm barrier was even approached by
the likes of the Prodigy and so on.  'The Bouncer' was considered *fast*
when it came out, and that's around 130.

Concerning idolizing DJs, here's my quote of the week.  It's Juan Atkinas
from an interview in DJ (UK) magazine . . .

  Man, it's weird.  I remember a time when being a DJ didn't mean shit --
  when I started doing parties the only time people noticed the DJ was
  when the fucking record stuck.  I'm from that school of thought.
  Sometimes I find it hard to understand how DJ culture got so fucking
  massive in Europe.

i guess i met you that night, david!  i remember thinking, now what is 
going on in this guy's mind that he would dress like a cop?! :)

i wore an sfpd jacket to Atomic Pig in the Oakland Coliseum Parking lot 
this year.  yup, strange looks!, but i think i also had a "funny" hair 
color so i definitely wouldn't "pass."  it's kind of fun wearing a cop 
jacket  you get to have lots of conversations with strangers about 
police brutality and stuff, cuz the jacket  is a conversation-starter 
(esp. if you don't look like a cop!)  on the downside, my friend who 
actually owns the jacket got pretty harassed by the piggies once for 
wearing it.   :(

Well, while we're on the topic of dressing up at raves, (wayne's chevron/cop
jacket) I decided to get decked out myself last week at Moonlight...
I was the guy dressed up as the devil with the white face paint, little red ho         
horns, and a gaudy silver disco shirt.  ...thought it'd be nice to turn the
"positive vibes!" giddiness upside-down and tiptoe around as MacPhisto himself.
Plus, how could I resist the opportunity to put myself in a place where I could
whisper to everyone, "Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale m                      
moonlight?"  --that was the clincher!  I'm mulling over Progress on Sat. night,
and if you see the devil stumbling about, smiling and giggling, say hi--it'll
be me.  I suppose I don't make a very *good* devil, though, I'm in too good a
mood... :)

DEfinitely!!!!! Wouldn't miss it for the world!!! I'm kind of surprised it
hasn't been getting mentioned......THE PRODIGY go on right at 10...it's 
kind of an early show, but the club will actually stay open until 4.....
My entire band (Smitten) will be going...one of will have a Smitten 
T-shirt on probably, so keep an eye open and say hello.....on a side note,
since the show is so early, does anyone know of a good party going on
AFTER the show??? I'm wondering if PRODIGY are going to play a second set
at a rave later tonite????

into techno and like me cant find what they want in SF.
thats it....... Im no preacher...........

The calendar that is mailed out is essentially "lynx -dump"ed from the
web page on Thursday and comments added to the top.  The advantage
of going to the web page (besides the snappy graphics), is that it
is updated throughout the week and may contain more information than
the most-recently mailed calendar.

I agree, alot of times I feel that the more unconscious I become (while 
awake), the more conscious I really am.  Less self-conscious, more unity 
conscious. I feel as we all tune more into the state of unity 
consciousness we become more of who we truly are.  There is a place that 
many of us experience at a rave with the help of techno music that we are 
all one.   There is so much soul in the music, the 
soul runs through us all.  For deep down in our heart, we have the same 
soul.  The more I experience the soul in me, the more I feel like I 
experience the soul in others.  Techno has definitely helped me with this.

I remember this dude about 2 months ago,  asking where there is trance music
in the Bay Area...   Well,   I'm happy to report that 8th house 1190
Folsom (Alley Cat bar and grill),  has a weekly dose of some goa like
trance.

I've been there the last 2 weeks,   and this is the LAST MONTH,  and last
night,  they had a live Techno band that was really great.    So,  check it
out...   It starts rather late,   but goes on until sometime after 3 am...

Greetings!

In my latest venture (the InterNet Salon), one of my plans is to have
a weekly Friday night get-together. My sound system (Liquid) is at my
office (great fun...easy to practice here :-), i'm in a warehouse, and
there's plenty of room to enjoy.  

Our first time out will be this coming Friday, the 21st, from 8-midnight.
Ethan, Logos, and E-ric will be spinning.  It's my Open House...stop by
if you can.

If you'd like to play some tunes some Friday night, drop me a line, or
drop by.  I'm also interested in hosting performers and other interesting
people.  

The InterNet Salon is located at 938 Harrison St., at 5th, in San Francisco.

Hello,

I had suspected, given his other viewpoints, that Newt was an
environmentalist, but up until now I've been unable to verify it.

But, in his new book, "To Renew America", Newt devotes a chapter to the
Environment.

Before he ran for office, he was the Coordinator of Environmental Studies at
West Georgia College, where he "taught students the concept of the ecosystem"
and the necessity of preserving them.

As I had heard, he did run for Congress in 1978 on a plank of Clean Air &
Water and was actively supported by the Sierra Club and League of
Conservation Voters.

After he was elected, he discovered that the major national environmental
groups had already allied themselves with the Left wing of the Democratic
Party -- despite the fact that conservation of the environment had been
started by Republicans (cf administration of Teddy Roosevelt).

He is very much in favor of preserving biodiversity, the Global ecosystem,
and the purity of air and water - but, he also feels that the current federal
laws are too heavy-handed and inefficient and need to be revised.  He cites
as an example, the EPA's insistence that the city of San Diego abide by
federal water treatment regulations designed for the Great Lakes region, even
though San Diego discharges its effluent far off the coast in the Pacific
Ocean.  The position of the City of San Diego is supported by scientists of
the Scripps Institute of Oceanography and would save the city $7 billion .

You can hear Newt talk about these issues on MTV's roundtable discussion with
Newt on Sunday evening at 7 PM (a 1 hour program).

I had suspected, given his other viewpoints, that Newt was an
environmentalist, but up until now I've been unable to verify it.

But, in his new book, "To Renew America", Newt devotes a chapter to the
Environment.

Before he ran for office, he was the Coordinator of Environmental Studies at
West Georgia College, where he "taught students the concept of the ecosystem"
and the necessity of preserving them.

As I had heard, he did run for Congress in 1978 on a plank of Clean Air &
Water and was actively supported by the Sierra Club and League of
Conservation Voters.

After he was elected, he discovered that the major national environmental
groups had already allied themselves with the Left wing of the Democratic
Party -- despite the fact that conservation of the environment had been
started by Republicans (cf administration of Teddy Roosevelt).

He is very much in favor of preserving biodiversity, the Global ecosystem,
and the purity of air and water - but, he also feels that the current federal
laws are too heavy-handed and inefficient and need to be revised.  He cites
as an example, the EPA's insistence that the city of San Diego abide by
federal water treatment regulations designed for the Great Lakes region, even
though San Diego discharges its effluent far off the coast in the Pacific
Ocean.  The position of the City of San Diego is supported by scientists of
the Scripps Institute of Oceanography and would save the city $7 billion .

You can hear Newt talk about these issues on MTV's roundtable discussion with
Newt on Sunday evening at 7 PM (a 1 hour program).

This is one of those posts where people try and hook up a ride to Sunset, 
I think they alluded to it being down on the beach somewhere in Santa 
Cruz this week.

So if anyone from the city is driving down there, and hopefully returning 
sometime later, and they have some free space to offer, I'll offer them a 
mix-tape for their troubles.

I really can't access my account over the weekend, so if that sounds like 
a fair deal my # is 406-4538. Thanks.

Dear all,

Just out of WEB @ 1015 Folsom. Surprisingly ravey club: no unity, but
TOUGH vibe.

In a while I'll unsubscribe from your list, make a .forward to my uk
account, go to a beach, talk maths to some friends until 1; they will
take me to SF airport, and I'll depart for London (home; and through
to Amsterdam, to pick up my kids and then for holydays in Greece...
((Huh, why am I telling you all this? Sorry, it's been a long
night.)))

Actually, I just want to say

	BYE and 
	THANKS and
	LOVE and
	HAVE FUN

to all of you whom I have met and read from during last 10 weeks,
which I spent among you. 

You are the best scene I have seen. (What have I seen? I lived mostly
in Amsterdam, a bit in Berlin in 1988, three years in Montreal, last
two years in London.) Yes, London is the most sophisticated scene,
they say; music-wise, at least, it is indeed, I think. But I am a wise
old (36) prof, and I don't like sophistication but simplicity.

You are the best scene people-wise; I believe, the only one I would
not mind sending my children at (in a while, though: they are only 4
and 5 now).  At most fun scenes, there is enough power-play going on
that you often end up, especially when you are young, with more
frustration than fun.  Here in SF, I have seen less of that than
anywhere else. Perhaps that's, to some extent, nature of your life
here: the absence of madness in traffic, even sporadic courtesies, are
also completely new phenomena for me.

Sasa, Cory, Michelle, Geoff, Tracy, Mark and many others: YOU HAVE
BROUGHT ME IN DOUBT. I see what you mean. We do have a chance to
CHANGE THE WORLD BY HAVING FUN.

Have fun,
-- Dusko


PS Let me add a comment on house, if I may. 

The question WHAT WENT WRONG?  reminds me on my grandmother. She
wondered WHAT WENT WRONG between her Johann Strauss and my brother's
Roxy Music. "They just slam those drums and add repetitive noises; it
is NOT MUSIC." My music teacher was trying to explain to her that WHAT
WENT WRONG had actually happened earlier, i.e. between Beethoven and
Strauss, and that already Strauss was NOT MUSIC --- but she did not
get it.

The two last centuries of music history have been built by whatever
each previous generation called NOT MUSIC. Each new step forward had
destroyed more of the sublime tonal structures and added more
primitive sound effects, just working on your nerves. Stravinski was
like that, Schonberg was like that, jazz was like that, rock'n'roll
was like that, punk was like that --- house is like that. 

House is NOT MUSIC --- if you compare it with what they thought to be
music a day before yesterday. I believe it is silly comparing it with
techno, as it is silly comparing it with ambient, and almost as silly
as comparing it with classical music. 

If I may simplify a bit, ambient is whatever Brian Eno says it is,
ambiental music, techno is a similar thing, but speeded up for
cheerfulness --- whereas house is something COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.
Distorted voices, dramatic rhythms, going on and on and on, not
letting you go, taking over controll, so that you dance all night,
exhaust your fears, and smile to everybody. No, that's NOT MUSIC:
that's a psycho-technique.

But then, when everybody is waving to it, we change the word --- and
MUSIC becomes house. A new step in history: a further degradation of
structure. Thereby, MUSIC BECOMES MORE SIMPLE-MINDED, BUT MORE
DEEP-HEARTED, MORE MUSCULAR THAN EVER.

Don't be my grandmother: it's silly to complain about this. THERE IS
NOTHING WRONG with becoming less sophisticated and more primitive. We
have been developping in that direction for quite a while. And it's
fun, isn't it?

PPS Perhaps I am exaggerating, but I believe that house is on the
verge of inadvertently realizing some unachieved abstract ideas of
avantguarde. 

Firstly, the DISONANCE, on which serious composers philosophized all
the time, is, as far as I can see, for the first time being used for a
concrete purpose --- an actual emotional effect.

Secondly, the idea of MULTIMEDIA, which conceptualists were trying to
reach by combining in galleries oil paintings with potatoes and
bycicles --- multimedia is in house a real thing: above all, a
symbiosis of sounds and drugs.  (I don't know how terribly illegal is
it to say this, but do I think it is true.  Anyone out there able to
really feel the skin span by pushing it only from outside, or only
from inside, not both?)

Finally, the TECHNOLOGY. The boundaries between
spinning/dubbing/sequencing/producing/playing/composing music will
soon vanish: there will probably be a continuous gamut of
music-making. Composing is so often just sampling or sequencing, while
DJs should be viewed in the house manufacture: they assemble the final
product --- a party --- from parts they acquired from musicians, while
these usually buy lots of samples, programs etc. from...
(whateverthosepeoplehangingoutinthestudiosarecalled) Some of them
really COMPOSE music: they give you a theme A, then B, then go back to
A but faster, then C.... then in the end return to A again, to
"resolve" the dramatic tension... 

This is probably where computers will come in. I don't mean that
everybody will be sitting at a computer and move around musical
phrases in colours. There will always be PHYSICAL ACTIONS OF PLAYING:
DJs will FOREVER love rubbing their records, just as other people will
keep blowing their guts into a saxophone, while others will slide
their bows over deep celli between their legs...

Oh, sorry. Hope you have all already deleted this terrible morning
tirade of mine, and nobody has been bored to death. 

If anybody who knows Michelle reaches this point, please tell her that
I really hope to see her. Pity she had to work.

  Mixed feelings on this one!  It was an excellent
chance for me to play hard and fast for a crowd that
was going to go off, hard and fast, but ... it was
a technical nightmare.  I blame John Carel for spoil-
ing me rotten on his Gateway Sound System!  John is
one of the precious few who makes it his job to hunk-
er over the amps and compressors for the length of 
the party, making sure nothing overloads and that 
everything sounds as sweet as possible, while booming
as loudly as possible.  Not so on Thursday!  I was 
left to fend for myself, and carelessly overheated 
the amp about 4 times -- meaning the sound cut out
at all of the peak moments of my set.  Sorry!  Even
more frustrating was the fact that one of the turn-
tables was completely lacking pitch control.  The 
green 'perfect pitch' light stayed on no matter where
the pitch slider was on the +/- 8 continuum, and if
it was allowing me any pitch control at all it was more
like +/- 1 percent.  So most of the mixes I had planned,
which made perfect sense at home were just impossible.
I had to mix very quickly, with my finger dragging fur-
iously, and had to scramble through records by trial &
error rather than by intuition.  Bummmmmahh!
  Highlights of the evening were:
- Allen@ameba playing Whitehouse & Cabaret Voltaire
- Allen@ameba following the same fashion intuition I
followed, & wearing 100% black
- Andrew@ameba's dj friend Kelly helping me keep the
unruly amp in mind
- ADSR's intro sample
- My shaved-headed roommates Mike & Cody both getting
mistaken for me & hearing 'nice set'
- My lovely friend Abby in Pippi coiffure

  Anyhow, what I played was:

Har har, yer a funny guy.  So sarcastic.

Get real, he's just a tool of the power structure already in place in this
country.  If he tried otherwise, he'd get knocked down faster than you could
say "JFK."  

I didn't see anything in your post about how he would protect the
environment, only save money by loosening standards (which may or may not be
too tight, that's not my point).  Maybe he knows that externalities such as
air and water pollution are already actionable under civil law, and that
adminstrative remedies are more economical than endless civil litigation.
Or maybe he has better ideas, e.g. auctioning pollution "rights."  I dunno,
he's so two faced it's hard to tell where he stands sometimes.

To illustrate:  (from SJ Merc)

"Gingrich proposed a referendum in which voters would be asked either to
impose far harsher penalties for drug offenses-including death to those who
import them-or to legalize drug use. "Either legalize it, or get rid of it,"
Gingrich told 50 state Republican organizations.

Brilliant leadership, Newt.  It typifies his habit of taking two extreme,
diametrically opposed views of the same issue, and inability to perceive
grey areas.  He knows full well that tougher laws would pass.  (It also
illustrates a fundamental flaw of democracy.  51% decide you should get the
chair for smoking a joint.  The other 49% have to stop or die.)

Subject: Car Sterio party - A concept
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

We all know what a hassle it is to get permits for amplified sound.
Last year,  Aaron from SPAZ had actually come up with this Boom Box
party concept where a sound sysem was fed into a small low power
FM transmitter,  and people would bring boom boxes in the hopes
of generating enough volume for a good vib.   I propose we go one
step further..... Car sterio systems (The beefy variaty).

I am willing to invest up to $250 for a small low power FM transmitter
from Steve Dunnifer (Of Berkeley Free radio fame) to put together a team
of DJ's and other interested people to put on a party that would not
likely to get busted for "Amplified sound".   This would open up a lot
more sites than previously available.

There are a lot of people around who have beefy car sound systems,  when
combined with several of them,  can produce a really good sound.

We can have these practically anywhere out in the open,  and without having
to lug heavy speakers,  and such.    I think I can pick an FM frequencey
somewhere below 92 Mhz that would permit me to throw out a signal strong
enough to cover any field with some good tunes.

This isn't a new concept of course,  SPAZ did it before,   but used a
transmitter tuned to a frequency that was used by another strong adjacent
station.

I already have my pair of 1200's,  a TIAC Model 3 mixer (which makes
beat mixing a dream - because it puts the right TT into the right earphone,
and left turntable into the left earphone... which most cross fader mixers
don't have).

All we really need are DJ's,  and a few other folks who want to continue
this amazing summer vibe an an unusual but amazing way.   Remember,  it
isn't illegal to play hour car sterio in a parking lot,  or have your
boom box booming in a park.

Comments anyone?

When Laura played there over a year ago, the sound guy, among many atrocities
that night, at one point removed the cartridge from the turntable not playing
a record, and walked away with it!  Leaving Laura to let the record run 
out and leave dead air while she put another record on the only working 
turntable.  Oy.

Nice idea, but it would still have to be somewhere remote, to avoid

Yeah although you don't have to worried about amplified sound and stuff, 
it is still illegal to have your car stereo too loud.  If a cop can hear 
it 100' away then he can give you a ticket.  So you can do it in more 
places, but you still have to be a tad careful.  As long as you are away 
from most civilization then I don't think the cops will hassle you.  Hope 
it works out...if it does we'll have to set one up down here in smelL.A.  
Later...

Dear All;

	Good idea, but naive.

	Better read up on frequency modulation, radio physics, and FM's
major modulation bandwidth limitation of the carrier frequency, before
spending any money. I believe the FCC limits the bandwidth of the input
information, meaning the music to 50Hz to 15Khz, not Techno friendly. 
Also due it's nature, FM frequencies, have a bandwidth which are
much wider than carrier frquencies would elude to, not to mention all the 
harmonics generated by all the radio stations round here. FM is and was 
never meant to be used for high quality audio reproduction, to many 
variables, and I feel most people would be very disappointed with the 
sound. Maybe PP Microwave would offer that, but they didn't teach us that 
in school.

	You would be better off with a van, a killer 200 - 300 watts car
stereo system, a mixer & turntables, some high quality cabinets, and a 
dedicated look out witha two way radio, and it would be much easier. This 
way if someone saw the police comnming, they would radio a head, and have 
the music shut down, the van doors closed, and when they got there they 
would find a bunch of cars, and people, in dead silence.

Sin;
Brian Darkness

Actually there is nothing illegal about the idea, and it isn't naive either.
It is perfectly legal to broadcast within 1 square mile(I think). I had to
study all this crap, I am a d.j. at a radio station out in Contra costa. Also
the frequency would have to be under 92.1

These are the sorts of arguments that make me think that Newt is a
complete cretin; not the sort of arguments that give me a warm fuzzy
about Newt's attempts at reversing his self-generated PR damage by
attempting to  appear more centrist than he really is.

The fundamental flaw in the republican environmenal equation is that
there is no equation in the first place. Money is a meanlingless
concept to nature -- you cannot assign an economic term like "cost
savings" to the environment. The environment is priceless, once you
damage it, throwing money at the problem will not erase the damage
done. Also, cutting $7billion doesn't mean the taxpayers will get back
the money -- it will be successfully and secretely redirected into
other hidden coffers, or applied towards repaying existing debts, or go
right back to the politicians. I think the republicans AND the
democrats will achieve the greatest savings if  they all fired
themselves.

The republican environmental deregulation policies are nothing more
than a "business plan" for a final divide and conquer of the earth's
resources. Steal more of the wealth of the land from the people and
hoard it behind the guard gates in the mansions of the rich. Ensure
misery and suffering among the poor so that you always have slave labor
and human cannon fodder; make it impossible to sustain yourself unless
you are willing to put on those greenback shackles of slavery. The
republicans (IMHO) seek a full reversion to feudalism where a few own
everything and everybody else is a serf ...

One of these days you'll have to buy air to breathe safely -- imagine
the business opportunities!

Last time the republicans attempted to deregulate a stable system we
got the S&L crisis, which made a few men and women rich while the
taxpayer got to pay the bills. Let's have at it again with the
environment. Those republicans are tired of this miserable life/earth
they've created, so they might as well seek their rapture and everybody
else's armageddon.

Gotta run -- serf's up!

Progress

info: 415.974.4391

Saturday, July 15, 1995


     I recently spoke with Jane, promoter of Progress, and wanted to set 
the record straight:

     Anyone with a ticket from the cancelled outdoor will get a $5 
discount to tonight's party, or a full $10 refund to go...

     She also welcomes any comments or criticisms; leave a message on her 
voicemail at: 415.974.4391 to dodge any digital misconceptions that you 
may have experienced here in recent past...

     Take it easy, keep cool and we'll see you tonight!

That's cool! I've met her before and she seems like a straighforward

Looks like they've done the right thing. THanks and good job!

Well,  I've built very good FM modulaters,  and if done right can have
excellent sound.   As an FCC First class commercial radio engineer,  and
with just the turn tables running on a sine wave inverter,  all the rest
will work on the DC,   so there should be little hum and noise.

I agree with you on the frequency...   I just checked the FM band from
here in Mill Valley,  and there are at least 2 channels partially free.
that are below 92.1.   But above those frequencys,  there are few free
empty spots on the dial.

Although Brian might be right,   I would venture to say that one can get
really good bass sounds from a properly equalized FM signal.   The main
problem might be to keep the RF (Radio frequency) from getting into the
sound system.    Good shielding and bypassing of Audio input is a MUST.

Umm, excuse me pardon me, but why are you posting this Gingrich propaganda
here on sfraves, Ken Stuart?  Whether Gingrich is an environmentalist or
not is subject to debate (perhaps in comparison to, say, Bomber Bob Dornan,
he may be), but that is not the point.

Your posting has virtually nothing to do with the purpose of this mailing
list, I object to it and strongly encourage you to refrain from doing this
sort of thing again.

I've heard plenty of techno broadcasts from college FM stations and it
often sounds better than some of the "wall o' bass" rave sound systems I've
experienced. At least this way the listener could control the level and eq.

Actually, the great thing to do would be to put the TTs and transmitter 
in the back of a van. Then organize a nice scenic drive around the area for 
10-20 cars (or to another party).

The surest way to circumnavigate any amplified noise laws is to can the 
car stereos and turn it into a walkman rave (ala antenna theater). Of 
course anyone without a radio would be pretty bored.

This also might be a nifty mappoint idea. Take Highway 1 south. When you 
pass Jones road, turn your radio dial to 91.5 for further instructions. 
Or just have people drive by the corner of Market and Church and tune in 
to 89.6 between 11 and midnight.

Fuck statistics. I usualy listen to the air signal in the studio @ KZSU
and other than being compresed when the dj get's volume happy, it sounds
exactly the same as whats going out. It's the car systems you have to
worry about. If the tradition holds, you will be supplied with 24 hours of a
good clean & legal signal to do what you wish with on winter solstice once
again.

Hay all y'all-

   Great time last night! I was amazed to arrive at the high-ceiling 
baroque pillared antechamber- classic location! 
   It took me a while to finally wander up to the balcony and check the 
vantage before soft-stepping the corridor to the beats provided by DJ 
Dani & friends- tres funky.
   The live ambient set was performed by Todd of ADSR, who made it down 
from the great white north (ottawa) to treat us to the chill. Jeno then 
took over the groove wheels and spun it out, followed by another Canadian 
DJ LUV.
   I've been travelling for almost a year and haven't been in the Bay 
Area for a while; i've been waiting for a time like that for quite a 
while...i was the haywire fool in the reptillian totem T. Great to be 
back in the City; looking forward to an epic summer...

Having discovered the point which the idea of music is driven to its end, I am 
proud to announce the advent through DJ technology, a new hybrid and 
solution to the never-ending genre wars.

Combination of Whitehouse and Jungle is the end of music:

Whitehouse brought sound to its conclusion once having discovered the 
Sadian principle: that which causes  the most intense  reaction to the nervous 
system is the best.

Jungle is the manifestation of the principle Cage put forth when he predicted 
that in the future machines would have to make our dance music: Jungle is 
the most extreme result of this approach.

No combination of records or genres can produce such a glorious result as 
these: the end of music.

Yes, you are incorrect. Having a not-so beefy but still adequately loud
stereo in my car, I know that I can be ticketed for it being able to be 
heard in excess of 50 feet. I still am willing to use it for your 
suggested purpose none the less as long it does not disturb neighbors, etc.

In regards to the stereo party I have a couple things to add.  First, have
you ever heard of a gathering permit?  I know this might sound
unconstitutional but, a gathering permit is something that you would have
to get if your expected attenDANCE was to be over 25 persons.  GOOD LUCK!
Second, if the men in blue ever got wind of it, they would surely stop by,
issuing noise volume tickets (or whatever they're called) to each sound
system owner.  I hear those tickets can be over a hundred bucks.  Lastly,
stop and consider the anti-rave variables.  Suppose an unhappy, sleeping
human was to hear the noise?

If you do get this off the ground, I would be more than happy to risk it
for the sake of adventure.

good luck

        Hey everybody,
        I just thought i'd pass along these words, which are now on 19" by
25" black and white posters that are being wheatpasted up around the city
right now.  They're for the party coming up this weekend (called either
'July 22nd' or '18+' depending on who you talk to). AK! i can hardly wait
to see spacetime continuum and turph live!
        Anyways, this is what's on the poster....

        it's not about the clothes you wear, how much money you have or the
        colour of your skin, who you sleep with, what language you speak or
your
        religion.
        These things are passing fads.
        You are today, this generation is more important than all before it.
        Wake up and dance to the beat of a different drum than history's.
        Wake up and follow your own path.  Seize the day.
        Forget the pain and fear and loathing of life, come together and
        celebrate.
        Lip service and intoxication will get you nowhere, we must change the
        way we think to change the way we live.
        Why do you belong? Where do you belong?
        It's not just about a party anymore.  Dancing is motion is music
        kinetic.   Release yourselves, unite as one and we shall all be free.
        Someday all music will be made this way.
        We are the future, this world belongs to you.
        Demand more, get more.
        Change yourself, change the world.

the text goes from 12 point (that's about a bit larger than the text you're
reading now) to like 200 point at the bottom (change yourself, change the
world). Interesting, i wonder if Jenny Holzer would have been a raver?
(sorry about the obscure art-skool reference..)
        just some ideas...i wonder what sort of affect this will have...

 I've been intending to make it to an 8th House , but now I see
that Capt. Crunch has said that the 8th House weekly will be no more
after July! Damn! Work is going to be a bitch for the next two 
weeks at least , and into the first week of August - I was looking forward
to my first 8th House in August.

 Will something similar be happening in August?

What is Techno?  What is house? Is there a middle ground?

To me techno is anything in the electronic spectrum of music.  This
includes ambient as well as Hard-core.  It takes you on a ride with goa
trance and drops you off between heaven and acid.  Its sort of difficult to
define, but the feeling is there.  You know when you have gone on a techno
journey.

House music is another story.  House just jumps into your soul and finds
you.  It will show you things you would normally never see.  And the
feeling.  Yea, you know the score.  Its on the soulful side of things.
That certainly doesn't mean it has to be mellow.

If you ask me, yes, there is a middle ground.  This cannot be difined in
print.  You would have to listen to feel it.  Feeling it is the only way.
Most of the djs that I know have a middle ground song or two in their set.
I know I do.  The stuff in the middle brings everything into perspective.

I was asked these questions just recently and thought about it.  I know
that these are the most vague of answers but, that's music.  You can't
discribe it any more that you can an emotion.  That's music.

peace

Wow, pretty cool stuff, and who is Jenny Holzer, (for those of us who 
didn't go to art school?)  Anyway, this kind of ties in with my weekend.  
I went to a party friday night, that I had been looking forward to for a 
LONG time.  Regrettably, what it delivered was far less than my 
expectations/projections!?  The end result of the party, and maybe a 
little sleep deprivation, was that I slipped into a WEIRD funky mood.  
This culminated saturday night in some pretty deep introspection.  I was 
hanging out at the Berkeley Marina before venturing to cool world, (I had 
to get out!) and I managed to work myself up pretty well, pondering "the 
meaning of life" type questions...  I kept asking myself "what's the 
point", "what really matters", and the like.  The worst thing was an 
overwhelming sense of disconnectedness, being terribly out of synch.  
Highly unsettling.  Coolio's world, on a positive note,  wasn't half 
bad.  We didn't dance much, just kinda grooved on tunes in the "small 
dome" which was the darkened end of a hallway.  I walked around a lot and 
met some REALLY cool people, and just *E*njoyed things.  About the only 
nice thing about all this, is that it's put the trivial stuff, (silly 
job, etc.) into perspective, showed that they really aren't that 
important, even though I haven't yet reached much insight about the 
deeper things.  It's kind of scary to see so many people so caught up in 
"career" and all the chaff of modern life, distracting themselves to the 
point that they probably never really ponder more important things.  
Perhaps a little knowledge IS a dangerous thing?!  I hope this random 
post doesn't annoy anyone too much, but I felt like sharing it, and 
asking if anyone has ever felt this, and how they dealt.   Take it easy.  Tom

It's all electronic I thought?
The common base for a great deal of both these musics - I hate to make
distictions or labels :(  - is electronic drum and base.

House music to some people is techno. Techno to some is house.
What's more of concern is that it's DANCE music.
One plays the music that fits the moment. Select the record or what have you
that represents the emotion and interconnect it to the next feeling and so on..

I dunno :)

Look at the parts and you can't see the whole. Look at the whole and you can't 
see the parts.

Kinda reminds me of something Heisenburg once said....

About the best I can do, since there is so little you can say about the
technical differences between house and techno, is that house is the
music of the heart and techno is the music of the soul.  And to me,
living without either of them isn't living at all.

Yes that is a tear you see in the topic!

This is good bye my fellow sfravers. I have mucch regret in this action
but it is something I must do.

I have been more tha double time busy with my career. By choice I have
biten off more than I can chew. Don't worry I definitely will not stop
goin to parties but I must unsvbscribe from sfraves. The reason being is
I receive many messages on my email privately. I don't have the time to
check my mail every day. almost every night lately I have been doing
sound or club work.(Being a sound engineer is NOT glamorous).
I need my e-mail time for my private messages because of the new
business I started.

NOW, I would like all of those who know me personally(either in person
or even just corespondence) to send me a private message. In the body
text just type:

add list

I have a new off-line reader and this will add you to my new mail list.
I lost my old one so even if you think I have your address send it.

I hope to add another e-mail address and have it just for sfraves and
other listserv areas.

To give you a hint, I haven't checked my mail in 3 days and I had over
100 messages to read.(Yow)

Keep the love close to your heart body and soul. Only you can predict
your future. Take hold of that future and control your life.
I love all of you. Even the ones I flamed. I hope to join all of you
soon again. Hopefully not more than 2 months.

SOUNDGOD@iccse.com is a very sad sfraver, alone in his computer world
yet always accompanied with the love of the world.

bye

> It costs too much to do Alcatraz.  I heard in excess of $100,000.

I went to Alcatraz a few months ago for the first time since I was very 
young, and was thoroughly entranced by the beauty of the setting.  You 
really can't get a feel for what the island is like by merely looking at 
it from across the bay.  There is a great deal of old stonework, ruins of 
buildings, and lush, verdant vegetation.  While I was there I kept 
thinking, Wow!  What a terrific rave site *this* would be!  

I was curious enough about the potential to discreetly inquire of the 
park rangers there whether anyone occupied the island at night, and I was 
told that two rangers spend the night.  But the place actually is quite 
big, and with the sound of the ocean and numerous places to be shielded 
from view, one might actually manage to hold a party there for 
considerably less than $100,000.   |)

Transportation to and from Alcatraz is allowed only by a ferry from San 
Francisco, which is actually very reasonably priced.  It runs daily every 
hour or two from near Pier 39, for something like $5 or $7 per person.  
If you want the headphones for the audio tour of the island, it costs a 
bit more (my friend and I passed on this).

I don't know much about sound equipment, but might a small generator be 
light (or easily disassembled) enough for one person to carry over, in 
say a large suitcase?  There's plenty of tourists on the ferry naturally, 
so a big heavy suitcase or two might not attract too much attention in 
the crowd.  Lugging it up the hill would be a pain though!  Only part of 
the island is open to the public, but like I said, it's large, and the 
tour is unguided.  My friend and I found it relatively easy to slip away 
and cross into some of the prohibited area to check it out.  You aren't 
required to leave Alcatraz on the next departing ferry -- you can stay as 
long as you want, up till the last departure, around 4:30 p.m. I 
believe.  Thus if a few suitably disguised ravers came over on each boat 
during the day, slipped away from the crowd, and simply never went back 
over, a good-sized group could be spirited onto a pre-arranged site on 
the island to wait until night for the party.

As an alternate to lugging sound equipment, maybe the stereo boom box 
idea currently being discussed could prove fruitful at this juncture...

On a brief sidenote, I learned during my visit to Alcatraz that the 
island has a short history of protests.  During the late sixties or early 
seventies after it was closed down as a federal penitentiary and before 
it was reincarnated as a tourist attraction, Alcatraz was occupied by a 
group of American Indians as a protest of the treatment of their people 
by the United States government.

It would certainly be a dramatic place from which to send a message about 
the Constitutional right to freedom of assembly.

	Paul Hardcastle also did another song, a "sequel" if you will to 
"19", called "19 - The Final Story".  It's not anywhere near as good as 
the original, IMHO.  Just thought someone might be interested.  "19" used 
to be one of my favorite songs, and it's got some great bits to be sampled.

        Hey, i LIVED like this for a long time, it sucks.  I don't usually
make sweeping statements but i'd have to say that the feeling of alienation
is _the_ worst feeling that a human being can experience. That you, and you
alone, are experiencing or thinking about something, that you are not a
part of _anything_ and that you are some sort of anomalous island in a sea
of ppl who have nothing in common with you.  Thing is, it took me a while
but i've realized that this is _never_ true.  The human commanalities which
bond us together will _always_ outnumber our differences. I won't get into
any personal political diatribes about how it is the project of advanced
capitalism to instill this alienation and divisive mindset in people in
order to create a spiritual vaccuum which can only be (supposedly) satiated
by consumer purchases (and we all know what a crock _that_ is).  Anyways,
it's good to be introspective, to question the self, meaning, purpose, and
all that. That's part of being a human with the unique ability to have
one's conciousness reflect upon itself.  Just don't forget the other side
of it which is that we're all hairless apes that need to go out and be with
others, to dance, to 'not-think', to laugh, to share physical contact.
         peace,

Tom,
I had a similar experience at the sunset party, which by the the way was 
beautiful way to spend a sunday.  For a while I was dancing, feeling a 
good trance sharing the energy with my surroundings, then I was was hit 
with some cognitive thoughts causing me to reflect on my life a bit.
A part of me didn't really want to do this, as I was having more fun a 
moment ago trancing out and feeling more of the vibe.  Then there was 
another part that was alittle caught up in some self importance trip.
Feeling a bit of a conflict, I decided to take a walk down by the ocean, 
to see if I could find a little more harmony with this conflict.
I spent a little time acknowledging and validating some of my thoughts and 
feelings that had pulled me away from the vibe for a bit.
Doing this helped me reconnect to the vibe within myself, and it wasn't 
long that I was feeling entranced with the beauty of the ocean and the 
rest of the surrounding nature.
After chilling for a little while with this beauty, I felt a resurgence 
of energy, and it wasn't long before I dancing away, and feeling open and 
connected to all the people there, even more so than before I was pulled 
away from my trance with some comtempative thoughts.
I don't think "a little knowledge is a dangerous thing".  I think what we 
DO with the knowledge can be dangerous.  It also can be a very helpful 
thing.  
Some comptemplating (not dwelling) of one's life can be great.  After all 
we do all have separate lives outside of (and connected to) raving.

 
:)

Markie said: "It's all electronic I thought?  The common base for a great
deal of both these musics - I hate to make
distictions or labels :(  - is electronic drum and base."

I think the labels are historical and useful in that context i.e they make it
easier to analyze and discuss the past.  The danger of course is in limiting
the present and future by forcing new tracks into categories.   Before disco
died(went underground) in this country it was becoming electronic.  As drum
machines and synthesizers became more common and affordable to more
musicians, various styles of electronic dance music came into being.  As was
the case in the past,  different styles evolved in different regions/cities:
   Electro-boogie(and later house and garage) in NY, House(deep and acid) in
Chicago, Techno in Detroit, Freestyle in Miami, etc.  The Chicago sound(deep)
seemed to be more directly influenced by the late Philly disco sound whereas
the Detroit sound was more influenced by the newer european electronic disco,
in particular the "colder" variety i.e. Kraftwerk.  That's just my
interpretation and that was 10!! years ago.  The styles have progressed
considerably from their roots and the more progressive the track the harder
it is to say what its influenced are.  Outside of "academic" discussion
however, I agree that labels and distinctions seem to encourage division and
that ain't no good.  The beauty of minimal, electronic dance music is that it
is so easy to understand it can communicate across cultural and language
barriers.  Like Afrika Bambaataa said so long ago, "Rock, rock, the planet
rock, don't stop."

I was at Alcatraz just last week. It cost us $9 each to take the ferry 
over, and then we could return on any ferry we wanted at 45 minute 
intervals. It looks like a good site, but there is no way you could just 
walk in and set up shop in a prohibited area without being noticed. There 
was security all over when I was there. As I understand it, the island is 
still "technically" Federal property, until it's restored, and then it 
might become a state park or something. I know this, because they told us 
if we took home a piece of the "rock" (literally), then we were 
stealing/vandalizing federal property.

Speaking of Physics:

A few days ago, I read in the paper how scientists have created a new 
form of matter.  By using lazers and magnetic fields, a group of 
atoms were cooled down (their motion frozen) to a temperature which was
as close to absolute zero as ever achieved.  As the atoms entered this
state of compelte stillness, the quantum mechanical waveforms that defined
them expanded, overlapping one another, until reaching a point where these
waveforms become equivalent to each other.

The result, according to the laws of Quantum Physics is that these atoms
lost their separate identities, and *become each other*.  Their individual
identities had been lost, and they became *one* atom representing a state
of matter never seen before (though predicted by Einstein 75 years ago).

I couldn't help thinking about what happens to our individual 
consciousnesses when we, as a group, enter trance states while listening
and dancing to music that resonates with our psyches, focusing and
"stilling" that parts of our minds that tend to separate us from each 
other.  We often talk about the "oneness" and sense of unity that can be
achieved when we sync up on the dance floor.  Some folks dismiss such
ideas as new age babble.  But as the forefronts of science open up
new understandings about our universe, the intuitive concepts of the
spiritual realm are becoming every bit as real as the material world
around us.

Whether it's lazers & atoms, or house/techno & minds, we humans are
discovering some pretty cool things as we push beyond the boundaries of 
reality.

Cloud Factory rave report
=========================

This weekend offered the highly commercial Cool World event...   But due 
to the high admission fee,  none of my friends could make it,   not even
to Progress...   But I was able to scrape enough gas money to get down 
and check out the Cloud Factory/ MESS (Mother Earth Sound System) event 
in Monterey.

We wait around for the info number to be updated,  and eventually got 
the info.    The announcement said that the Map Point was busted,  and 
cautioned us to be VERY discrete when approaching the site,   turn off 
the headlights as we approach a big Phat Cat mansion and look for the 
parking attendant.

We left rather late,   but pulled out of SF around 1:30 am,   heading 
south down to Monterey.   We eventually make it down there by 4:00 am.
(Boy!! what  non-smoker has to do to rave...  but outside events take 
much higher priority,  despite the long drive).

As I arrive,  Scott was spinning some older well known house toonz,  but 
after sitting in a car for 2 hours,   I didn't make it to the dance area 
until after I stretched,   but it didn't take that long until I was in 
the groove.   There were lots of breaks in the beat,   so my dance 
sessions were short,   but eventually another DJ went on that was more 
consistent.   It wasn't long until the sun started coming up,   and I 
was getting in the grove,   although there were few people dancing at 
that time.

The site was excellent,   I would have to give it a 9 on 1-10 scale.   
Way to go,   wonderful selection.   The party went to completion totally 
un-molested,   despite the fact that a house was about a half mile away.

The site was surrounded on three sides by tall cliffs,  and as I looked 
around,   people were up there on the cliffs dancing.    Quite a sight.

Down in the "pit" was really soft and fine sand/dirt that was ideal for 
a soft chillout place for our blankets.

Eventually,  things closed down at about 8:30 am,   and we headed back 
north to Santa Cruz where we suspected that Sunset was to be.   We visit 
all the health food stores in Santa Cruz,   have breakfast,   look up a 
few friends before calling the info line for directions to Sunset.

Sunset
======

As suspected,  Sunset was at a great beach in Santa Cruz,  and we get 
there just as the sound system was in its final checkout....   I took 
the opportunity to check out the beach area and explore...   Really nice
spot...

Things traditionally started off on the slow side,  but it wasn't long 
before the groove started setting in and the SF people arrive (after 
driving down from Bay Area).    As usual,  the SFRave quotient was 
really high.

After dancing my first set,   I head down the beach to the water for my 
first (And only) swim.    I was amazed at how nice the water was.   It 
was actually warmer than usual.  Or perhaps I was so hot from dancing 
that I might have cause an El Nino....

Ethan finally got behind the turn tables after a rough start,  and the 
music got progressively better.    All during Ethans set,  the music 
started to gradually evolve into some the most insane house/trance tunz 
I've ever heard.   The critical energy level really started to peak 
towards the end of Ethans set.

Mystic Bill (from Chicago) finally went on,   but after dancing to 
Ethans entire set,   I decided to chill and go swimming again,  but 
listening to Mystic Bill develop his set.   After about 20 minutes,   
Noticed that Bill's set was really evolving into this deep house 
(Chicago style),   quite different than our stuff,   but really funky 
and danceable.

As the sun was setting,  in true Sunset tradition,   people up on the 
cliffs were all lined up holding hands and shouting and cheering as the 
sun was setting.   WOW!!  What an incredible sight...   Not sure what 
the numbers were,   but estimates were far above 1000 people for one of 
the biggest Sunset parties ever.

Ethan finally came on,   giving me another chance to chill until his set 
develops.   He started off kinda funky,   with lots of vocals but as his 
developed,  the energy level really started to increase.   It wasn't 
long before people were shouting and hollering with approval,  as time 
went on.   As usual,  his set was primo...

Spun finally went on,  and continued the vibe and intensity.  For me,  
there were no breaks in the dancing,   all the way until the end,   
which took us well into 11:30 that evening.

There was talk about an "after party" at panther beach,   and also a 
party in Santa Cruz but because I was with other people,   it was 
decided that we make it back to Mill Valley.    We hung around by the 
fire to warm up before leaving as we started picking up the litter to 
clean up the beach after the party.

We eventually make it back the Mill Valley,  and I'm still smiling from 
such a wonderful vibe.

Sunsets are becoming legendary now...   Most people opting NOT to go out 
on Sat evening so they can save their energy for Sunset parties.

So concludes yet another wonderful weekend....

Crunchman out...

I guess I kinda meant it more as in "Looking for where something is going
you can't see where it's at, and, if you're looking at where it is at you
can't see where it's going."
[extrapolated from the ideas of momentum and position]

Hey everyone,
I had a great time at Sunset it was beutiful. The day that we left to go to
Sunset. My friend Travis opened a random book of poetry to this poem.

A Land Not Mine

A land not mine, still
forever memorable,
the waters of its ocean
chill and fresh.

Sand on the bottom whiter than chalk,
and the air drunk, like wine,
late sun lays bare
the rosy limbs of the pinetrees.

Sunset in the ethereal waves:
I cannot tell if teh day
is ending, or the world, or if
the secret of secrets is inside me again.

Anna Arkmatova
translated by Jane Kenyon


Cool huh. Lots of Love,
GABE

"the secret of secrets is inside me again"

The "shouting and hollering" definitely matches :)  I was thinking that 
when I read this, if your music was considered "house", well no wonder 
everyone thinks there's so much house music in SF!

I really liked that little explanation you wrote.  I didn't know that 
sorta thing still goes on (I guess I have my head buried in my CS books 
for class...ughhh).  Anyway, it is pretty amazing what science is doing.  
However, there always has bn previously a large seperation between 
science and mysticism of any sort.  However, i believe that may change 
soon.  Take for example the one subset known as "ravers".  A large group 
of them are intelligent college types.  In fact there is a large 
percentage down here of CalTech and Harvey Mudd students who go raving.  
Since raving in a way is a very spiritual experience (at least for me 
anyway) I can't help but see how the next generation of scientists will 
be affected by this new spark of intrest in mystism/religion of all 
sorts.  I, for one, will be pleased to see it, because I think IMHO 
scientists need to learn a few more morals.   I won't get into the 
"jurassic Park" lecture but I am sure you all know what I mean.  

Sorry if 
this isn't too rave related (but yes raving is EXTREMELY SPIRITUAL for 
me), but I was just kinda putting in my $0.02 on this thread.  I am sure 
you all have had at least one experience where you have been dancing at a 
rave and (this has happened to me both chemically altered and not 
altered) then you realize the oneness in the room.  It is something that 
developed over time without your conscious realization, in part it is due 
to the groove, in part to all the nice and happy people around you, but 
mainly I feel it is all part of the energy that is us (perhaps I am going 
off the deep end here).  But recently I have gotten into the idea of 
everything made up of energy (which science has confirmed since matter is 
simply a transition state of energy if I remember correctly).  I am quite 
convinced that we each have a pool of energy within us, and by releasing 
this energy within us we can change attiitude/make amazing things 
happen.  Thats why when you get a room full of people giving energy of 
consciously/unconsciously you feel so invigorated and unified.  Also that 
is one of the reasons I feel so tired after raving.  During each rave I 
go to (well I have been selfish with my energy once or twice) I just try 
to slowly release as much energy as possible.  Coming home from raving I 
am often extremely spiritually tired (but also in spiritual bliss) as 
well as mentally/physically tired.  This is just my observations and I 
would really like to hear other peoples ideas on this issue.  If you 
wanna email me or something, i would be more than happy to discuss this 
with you.  Oh and btw, yes I have read Celestine Prophecy and I thought 
it was an excellent book, but it is only a starting point.  

Well I have babbled WAY too much for one day...hope to see you all soon.

	-Christian

nice?  it was beautiful!  sure beats smelly wisconsin hick town barns

he is really very good.  it was nice for me to be in a new setting

about a month ago and felt the same way then.  i will need to adjust my

Us too!  If I may speak for the group...You have friends you don't even
know yet.

My two favorite things about raving in and around SF are:  1) You never
need to feel embarassed/shy about introducing yourself;  2) You don't have
to go through uncomfortable conversation closure, in that you can just
dance off and not feel bad that you didn't extend great and lavish exiting
lines like, "Well, I'll see you later."  Or, "Well, um, I'm gonna go over
here now, but I'm sure I'll see you before I leave."  It's not that they
don't happen, it's that they don't have to that makes it cool.

Some call it Sunset, I've taken to calling it Sunday Mass.

To think a boy from Buffalo could contribute to such a uniquely San
Francisco/Santa Cruz event.  So cool it made my toes curl.  Which made
dancing even worse cause I'd scoop up these huge loads of sand and send it
flying, inadvertently burying someone's foot.

THANK YOU PACIFIC!!!!  You guys rock!

See you all in two and two (and two),

Tony

P.S.  Was that Steven King or did I eat too many of those ;^) ;^) brownies?

Yeah, I thought that part about how Ethan was playing a lot of vocals
sounded a bit, erm, unusual.  But you know what, I betcha one of these
days he'll bust out the kickingest vocal set you've ever heard!

On 7/17 Starchild said:
On a brief sidenote, I learned during my visit to Alcatraz that the 
island has a short history of protests.  During the late sixties or early 
seventies after it was closed down as a federal penitentiary and before 
it was reincarnated as a tourist attraction, Alcatraz was occupied by a 
group of American Indians as a protest of the treatment of their people 
by the United States government.


That's because the island has been a sacred spot to the native people of the
bay area since long before we came along and decided to build a PRISON on a
sacred site. They manage to overlook this little bit of info on their touchy
feely tours.

Opus III, "Guru Mother" (1994 - pwl international... epm records... CD96291)

Kind of spiritual techno with a hint of eastern philosophy added for good
   measure.  Extremely kind.  A bit different from "Mind Fruit"-- less
   continuous, lyrics are kinder, less driving, more methodical, much less
   danceable and vocals more intense (imho: you can tell for yourself-- I
   sent to ftp://ftp.uqp.edu/incoming/lyrics/opus.iii/guru.mother)

Sorry- I don't have a way to do it, or I'd put up some samples for web access.

release the joy,
adam

The other very sad part of this was that the "19" that got all the radio
airplay and was hugely popular was withdrawn from the market. From what I
recollect it had something to do with him not getting the (CBS?) news
reporter's permission for the extensive sampling of his voice. (i.e. the
"None of them received a hero's welcome. guy"

"19" was then redone and re-released with another announcer's voice saying
the same words, and that's the one that I have on CD, but it's not nearly
as good as the original.

If anybody has the original one, I'd like to get in touch with you and get
a DAT copy of it.

thanks, -w

Yea...It was called "19" and I think the guys name was Paul Hardcastle? I
could be mistaken. That came out when I was a freshmen in high school at
Athenian.

Dear Lee;

	First, sorry for the lenght, but I think its really neat stuff.

	There is great promise from the science of nuclear fusion,
everything from materials, antimatter, to energy, unlike fissions
descructive nature.  Sometime in the 80's, I think it was at Princton
University, but somwhere in New Jersey, that a small town there became,
for a few controled seconds one of the hotest(temperature wise) locations
in our known galaxy, due to a sucessful nuclear fission experiment, or at
least thats what they said.

	Don't kid yourself, we are all connected, whether on the dance
floor, or sitting at our terminals. I'm an engineer, who happened to have
the opportunity of going to a massage school, who's whole philosophy was
based on the exsistence of the mind body connection. While I was there you
got thoughly emersed with Anatomy & Physiology, for 6 months. 

	Engineers tend to be know it alls, I'm no exception. I've gotten
to work with a lot of nifty stuff as a engineer, but before school had no
appreiation for the human body. After, however it is a much different
story, you just can't image what you are, what your made up of, its just
so trippy, 70% water, & the rest connective tissue, but also much more
than that, they often used the fish tank as an analogy. All these tiny 
little organisums connected, but separtated, yet its life, persistant, 
resilent, and self repairing for a time.

	We are all made up of cells, each with its own celluar
intelligence, summed & linked together through a communications system,
also made up of cells, and powered, & surrounded, by an electro static
field, that I believe actually transmits on some very suttle level. The sum
of these millions of organisums, their celluar intellgence, our genetics, and
environment makes us who and what we are. Anytime you pass an electric 
current through a conductor, there is a colasping & expanding electro 
magnetic field around that conductor. So we in a very real sense have a 
field of energy around us at all times, that is characterized by our 
mood, genetics, history & experience, diet ...etc. Electro magnetic 
fields also induce a current into conductors, so your energy field can be 
passed on to another person, just by walking by them, or touching them.

	Now hears the really neat part, everyone has a bacteia called
macro-fozes(spelled incorrectly), these guys truck around the connective
tissue of the body removing waist products ..etc. They also have another
important job, which is identifing whether or not something in the
connective tissue is foreign to the body or not, and either disposing of
it, or labeling it as foreign, which call other types of immune cells,
like T4, Killer T Cells, ...etc, to help. These cells are all surrounded
by energy, and respond to energy. So when you get the chills(immune system
response) for no reason, and you notice someone sleazey just walked up to 
you, don't doubt it.

	I was trained in a modality of massage called Polarity, which is
Energy Work, created & discovered by a engineer, Dr. Stone, in order that
he could help his wife who suffered from unknown cronic pain. 

	He borrowed some work from a sciencist(I'm forgeting his name),
that believed the body could be healed using certain kinds of energy &
frequencies. Rumor has it that in sample dishes containing cancerous
tissue, he was, through the use of a device(forget it's name too, but I
think its on display at the Smithosian) he created, was able to change the
cancerous cells back to normal, without any effects to the good tissue. In
fact this sciencist was able to do it with most diseases, totally removing
them. However, & mysteriously his lab was raided by the FDA(by all the 
branches of the government), all his equipment & notes either 
destoried or confiscated, and forbidden to do anymore research.

	Well, back to Dr. Stone & Polarity. He went aboard, to Tibet,
China, India...etc and studied medince over there for years, because the
Eastern modalities were the only ones, at that point in time even
acknowledged the exsistence of these fields, or energy; chi.  Dr. Stone
believed that these electromagnetic fields around the body could at least
be manipuated through a sequence of very lite massage treatments. 

	There are like 12 - 15 treatments that you do on someone
requesting the work, and depending on whats wrong. It's very powerful
work, and brings up a lot of emotional stuff with clients, during and up
to 48 hours after the secession. 

	It also has an effect on the therapist, it can be very draining,
even though the work is extremely lite, a few specific holds, and motions
and thats it. I've also felt good, better than when I've started, and like
there was something inside me that didn't fit or belong, its weird, and I
don't do the work very much. You can actually feel the field on some
people from time to time, it can be an electric feeling, or heat, or a
pulsing where there should be no pulse ..etc, the more training and
Polarity type work you do, the more you can feel it, it's an awareness
thing, sorta like the Force:). For some it takes years to master, others
minutes, and I feel someone should study it for years before practicing
it. 

	Also being an engineer I was really sceptical when they were 
telling me about it, but feeling is believeing, and I believe, & respect 
energy work.

	So yes, I believe(being an engineer), with reference to our
bodies, our universe, we are still infants in our knowledge, ignorant &
fearful of exploring the more cosmic aspects of the body, breaking the AMA
ivory tower/iron triangle, an outta pride, not fully acknowledging a
system of medince thats been around since the dawn of civilization, but I 
like to think were growing.

Dear Sig;

	I was refering to my friend, who's in a rather critical position 
in the miltary, and due to the raves close prosimatity to Montery, and 
the Presideo, and the fact that he lives a jaded double life, was much to 
risky/dangerous for him to be there. In other words it was a joke, sorry :)

Blatant Self-Promos from bands or promoters in SF is one thing, Zheam.  
BSP's from people outside the area, who join the list for one 
day, post their BSP, and then leave, is *not* cool.  

For the other SFRavers - Zheam has posted many messages to this and the
other rave lists, about once every two weeks, whenever he has a new record
out.  He has also sent forged mail shortly after his spam from a "satisfied
customer" to the same list of lists. Usually, since he isn't a member of the
list, they bounce to me and I don't forward them since I don't forward posts
from non-subscribers on principal.  However, Zheam has now decided to get
around that filter by subscribing to those lists, posting his ad, and
unsubscribing.  

I usually play a *very* light role in administrating this list - I don't 
believe in serious reprimands or unsubbing troublemakers or anything 
like that, I hope they would get a clue and context from the others.  
However, I also will not let the resource here be abused by marketers with 
no interest in the list itself.

Thoughts?

	Brian

I've got it and you can tape it if you want.  There was a second mix that was released later that had a cool acapella of the samples ("d-d-d-d d d-d-d-destruction"), if any one contacts you with a copy of that, I would like a DAT copy too ...  
To be honest, I never really understood the point of the song though.  I mean, if they only sent people to Viet Nam who were over 21, would that have been ok?

PS: Does anyone have that housey remix of "rain forest" that came out a few years back?

Rave party

 A large "rave" party at Four Mile Beach on Sunday drew hundreds of party-goers but created only parking problems, the Sheriff's Off=
ice said.
More than 100 cars were reported at the beach north of Santa Cruz. The party continued most of the day and was still going at 1O:30 =
p m, sheriff's Sgt. Gretchen Hurley said.
"Our past experience with the rave groups, the problem has not been with the party-goers themselves, our problem comes from just the=
 volume of them,'' Hurley said.
The California Highway Patrol said CHP officers and sheriff's deputies were ticketing illegalIy-parked vehicles.

As I remarked to folks at Sunset, the police weren't about to bust a party
when they were making a few thousand (at least) on the parking tickets.  Did
anyone on the list get one, and how much do they run?

If it's any consolation, the sheriff wasn't smiling about the whole thing.

This "What Is A DJ?" subject got me to thinking about my experiences as a
worship leader in a fundimentalist church (timewise, 7 years ago).  It was
my job, as with others worship leaders, to play the guitar and lead a
gathering of the faithful in song.  Every friday night I'd play in a band to
an audience of 2000 people.  Weds and Thurs I'd play solo to 30-70 folks and
once a month I'd go to prison to play for the inmates.  Anyway, all those
times I or the band never played with set lists.  We left the set list up to
God.   Somehow through a mechanism completely unknown to me, I (or the band
leader on Fri) would pick songs out on the fly (we knew hundreds) in the
right order to cause overwhelming emotional release.  Often I would enter a
trance state and when i came out people would be crying in joy, prophesing,
speaking in tongues, or dancing like crazy (it was a rock church).  I never
knew how it was going to come out, but if I prayed a lot (prepared my heart)
the effect was sure to be dramatic.

Anyway, that was a long time ago, but I was wondering, Is that was DJ's
do?

Well, I think just saying something to the list is pretty cool.  Because
you did, I'll be avoiding Zheams record.  I don't mind BSPs from folks who
give to the scene in one way or another, but Zheams tactic is pretty cheap.

Note that you didn't actually have to get a parking ticket if you
were willing to walk an extra 1/3 mile. I didn't (yay). There were
no parking signs posted along parts of Hwy 1 near the site; farther
away, however, you could park with no problems.

Hi to everybody I did and didn't meet at Sunset. I thought this party
matched the vibe of the Galen Birthday Party Sunset at the Berkeley
Marina... Niceness! It felt like Love Saves the Day with that
Amazing Certifiable Indulgent Dancing even though I only had a
Big Old No Good High Intelligence Treat!

Ethan, I loved your set!

In a very real sense I would say that you are correct. I've never been a
well-known dj or anything, but one party I played at it seemed as though
something took me over. It was like one minute, I was just playing killer
music but the next minute I looked up and saw the crowd, dancing and
cheering to what I was playing. That does something to you right there,
realizing that people are tuning in to what you are playing. I felt this
oneness with the crowd, feeling what they were feeling except building on
it with the music I was playing. It felt as though the crowd radiated this
intense energy everywhere, and feeling that made me more intense. It was
like a circuit of electricity in a sense, this circle of pure, primal
energy washing over everyone. I lost myself completely for a long time,
just keeping the energy escalating. It is one of the most powerful, almost
religious experiences I have ever had. One of my friends later on told me
that when he looked at me behind the 1200's he saw this intensity in my
eyes that he hadn't seen b4. I will never forget that ever...

	I'm sure it wasn't as much as $9 for the ferry when we went, but 
I think that was around December; prices may have risen, or they might 
charge more during the summer.
	According to the ranger I talked to, there were eight rangers on 
the island during the day to act as tour guides (and provide security, of 
course).  It certainly didn't seem like they were "all over".  It was 
easy to get out of sight of them and the other tourists.  Trying to lead 
a bunch of people at once into a prohibited area, or failing to be 
cautious and keep hidden would likely get you noticed, but done properly 
it seemed quite possible to me.  Perhaps after this discussion others 
will visit the island and provide more feedback.

This is Zheam ibn Ismail,

I wanted to clear up a few things especially to Brian:

First of all, I didn't sub and unsub from the list just to post my message
about my new release.  I have several email accounts and they get flooded
from time to time.  I'm seriously offended by Brian rush to judgement. The
reason why I recently subscribe is because I moving back to SF this fall and
wanted to no more about the current dance scene there.

Second, if anyone feel I'm abusing this list I apologize.  The only reason I
post what I did is not to make a cheap adveritsment or sale but just to
inform people of my new release as an independent artist.  There is not enough
people on this list to make an impact on my profits.  I only offered them to
go to those stores and listen to them for themselves instead of reading through
self-hyped dance magazines and posts by other people.  Nothing else.

And last, I'm work months and months releasing this 12" through my own channels
and anyone who been there know it ain't easy.   Please don't turn my hard work
Brian or Ellen, into one of your frivilous personal post. I worked to hard for
this, show some respect.....

The ticket was $33.  :(
But if that's what it takes to keep the Santa Cruz authorities mellow
I really can't complain too much.  Helps make up for some of the mess
we leave behind.

This may have been the latest Sunset ever, ending at 11:45.  I thought
Ethan's blistering set was the musical highlight, working the crowd into
a frenzy.  I really dug those records with the serated edges.

Spun's set wasn't as wild as at Freedom, still quite nice though; laid back,
but nevertheless laced with the usual Spun trippiness.  The visit
from a firedancer added to the pagan ritual feel of the evening and helped
break up the darkness of the night.  Didn't see the moon, but there were
plenty of stars, and a couple of UFOs disguised as airplanes.

Environmental Defense Fund
Action Alert -- URGENT

To:       EDF Activists
From:     Bill Roberts, EDF Legislative Dir.
RE:       S. 851, Wetlands Protection
Date:     July 17, 1995

    The dirtiest section of the industry drafted House "dirty water bill" has
resurfaced in the Senate in the form of the so-called Wetlands Regulatory
Reform Act of 1995, S. 851.  We urge you to add your voice to a nationwide
wetlands call-in day scheduled for Tuesday July 18 to help derail this latest
attack against wetlands protection.

    Wetlands provide habitat or food supply for 80% of all commercial fish,
naturally filter out pollution from water sources, absorb floodwaters, and
provide critical habitat for all waterfowl and hundreds of rare species.  The
United States has already lost half of its wetlands.

   If enacted, S.851 would:

    * Define 60% to 80% of wetlands out of existence.  S. 851 would set
    standards for wetland definition that have been discredited by the
    prestigious National Academy of Sciences.  For example, it would
    exclude many wetlands flooded even for months at a time because they
    are flooded in the winter or early spring, but not in the drier summer.
    According to these standards, S. 851's "unwetlands" will include vast
    portions of widely recognized wetlands such as Florida's Everglades, the
    Great Dismal Swamp in Virginia and North Carolina, and numerous
    areas bordering trout streams in the west.

    * Provide blanket exclusions from protective regulations for the few
    wetlands that do manage to survive S.851's definitional tricks.  For
    example, the entire oil-rich state of Alaska would be exempt from all
    wetland regulation.  Additionally, any wetland altered for any
    agricultural or forestry purpose, including grazing, would also be
    excluded outright.  This includes most of the forested wetlands of the
    south, the critical waterfowl breeding grounds of the midwest, and
    critical wetlands included in the San Francisco Bay Delta area.

    * Severely restrict protection for those few wetlands that survive
    both S.851's definition and exclusion hatchets.  Of the wetlands
    remaining, only those that serve as "critical habitat" for wildlife larger
    than 10 acres would receive roughly the current level of protection.
    Consequently, wetlands critical for flood protection or water quality
    could automatically lose protection.

   Contact your Senators on Tuesday July 18th and strongly urge them to
support wetlands protection by opposing S.851.  Contact the Capitol operator
at (202) 224-3121 to reach your Senators. Once you've completed your calls,
please contact EDF by email at Congress@edf.org to let us know you took
action.

Please don't turn my 12" Record into one of your posts issue.  As I said before
I apologize to those who are offended but lets get some shit straight once and
for all:

 *All I did is ask you to check out my record.  I didn't hype it up or offered
to sell it (in fact, I gave away plenty of free promos to people who wrote to
me and asked for one).  Why don't you talk about the shameless rave plugs that
usally go sour that get posted to this list?

*And for those of you who are tripping, there's plenty of other people on the
mailing list (like me) who is interested in hearing from other artists on the
net.  I can forward you plenty of email of people who wish to show me support,
but you don't want to hear that tho. I'm not going to trip either, people will
support what they like regardlessno  matter what Brian or other jealous peeps
thinks, and I hope they take it personal.....

 I would assume that tickets actually can start anytime after 10 PM... if I
recall there are many signs along the coast that specifically say
NO PARKING  10PM - 6 AM...  It would take them a little time to respond -
unless they were clock watching and waiting so that could account for the
11 PM ticketing....

I agree...as if spamming this list will make me want to buy anything from 
these limey people...

If we're lucky, it'll backfire, and nobody will buy anything from 
them...or maybe that's why they have to spam mailing lists...cause no one 
buys anything from them anyways!

Actually, we went out to our car sometime around 6:00-7:00pm to get a
blanket, and we saw the sheriff pull up and begin ticketing the line of
cars directly opposite the dirt parking lot where the path to the beach
started (where the signs said "no parking anytime").

They made bank, no doubt. They might even encourage future parties just for
the boost in parking ticket revenue...

     For someone who wants people to check out your record, you sure have a 
     bad attitude.  My understanding of sfraves is that it serves as a 
     forum for rave related issues.  If you want a forum to hear from other 
     artists on the net -- music, or otherwise, I'm sure there's other 
     newsgroups that exist or you can form one.  
     
     Perhaps it's artist's temperment or just a bad day for you, but to 
     toss an accusation (e.g., jealousy) and to hope they take it personal 
     is not the best way to advertise for yourself.  When you move to San 
     Francisco, I hope your plur experience will help you understand more 
     about our scene; and by reading the sfraves newsgroup you'll be able 
     to take things with a grain of salt.  Remember...it's all relative.
     
     Peace,
     Diane

Brian, 

Actually, they're still around.  I don't know if they're still putting out
albums, but I know they still do live shows.  A friend of mine from high
school just opened for them last weekend down in LA.  I'd like to know if
they've put out anything recently, too, 'cause their old stuff is really good.

Between the great music and the great people,  sunset turned out to be one of
the best parties in quite a while.  I did manage to speak with the sherif at
around 11:30 after all the tickets had been written. He had no complaints
about the people or the party
just the parking,  but given the limited parking if you carpool a 33.00
parking bill for a party as good as Sunset with no admission fee turns out to
be a great bargain.
One MAJOR DIAPPOINTMENT was the treatment of the the beautiful beach.
What  is the deal people?????  Bottles cans all kinds of crap all
over!!!!!!!!!
Your cleaning person is off on the weekends so please take out what you
brought in, the beach is not a club there is no payed staff picking up your
trash!!!!!!!
Most folks of course were quite considerate but those bad apples.....
Please if you see anyone leaving thier trash behind remind them how great it
was to share the vibe with them and "looks like you forgot some of your
things" .
Sorry to rant but after the full moon and Sunset I hope we can improve.

At least those plugs are local- and SFRAVERS want to hear that stuff.  It's
one of the most important components of the list.

AMEBA@Netcom.com  | 02:45 PM |5| Hey!  We're having a sale
Derrick Carter    | 12:15 PM |7| My New Record

I don't think Brian is Jealous, he is just doin' a damn good job of
maintaining this list.  If it weren't for him (and people like him) we
would be on IUMA, and posting to alt.rave all day long. :)

peace and respect (i'm not dissin you, and I'm not trippin either.)

It must have been erratic. I was in a No Parking Anytime area and didn't

That's why FMR's at Bonny Doon were allowed to continue until ravers
started destroying property.

I thought it was great that he did that  cause It helps me when Im searching
for new artists  for my work..but I realize now that  those post should be
somewhere on a list called bsp or something.

Well this would have to be a very private party.  I mean if you have 100+ 
ravers going on the island, there is a big chance you are gonns get 
caught.  Heck, come to think about it, I am pretty sure it wouldn't 
work, for this simple reason.  A lot of the ravers I know are...hmm... 
shall we say unique in their appearance.  If 100+ ravers went onto the 
island, I would think that they ferry people would realize...hmmm.. 
"those strange guys never came back".  Now I have never had the chance to 
visit alacatraz, but I would imaging that you pass through some sort of 
counting device (like the turnstiles at Disneyland).  It would really 
make sense from a security standpoint.  Correct me if I am wrong, but if 
I wanted to know if people were still on the island at the end of the 
day, that is what I would do.  Of course, you could always borrow a boat 
and ferry people to an isolated part of the island youself at night.  I 
mean if the sound from the sound system won't carry (which I am not so 
sure about) then a small boat engine should be nothing in comparison.  I 
guess that is just my take on the situation.  Hope to have been of some 
help...

Anyone thought about Angel Island, maybe?   It's that large island to the 
north - it has campsites on it, but no permanent inhabitants (I don't 
think - maybe a ranger?)

why not do Angel island ?  you can legally just, like, sail there
and legally camp there, so the problem of spearheading an entry is
solved.  you would have to scout out a discreet place to crank it
up and party down, but that should be do-able.  the problem with
Alcatraz is just mere presence will get you busted, and probably
committing a misdemeanor at that, so they could just open up the
old prison and toss you in :) 

LET'S DO IT !

     KKSF did the first amplified concert there a few months ago so I'm 
     sure it's possible to hold a permitted rave there.  Evidentally 
     there's one or two sheltered beaches where the winds aren't too bad 
     but I've never been there myself.  Also rangers do a search on the 
     island after the last ferry for stragglers 'cause I had a friend who 
     missed the ferry last year.
     
     If an industrious person has the time, money, and energy to pursue 
     this--much less anything!--it's a better bet to host a rave on Angel 
     Island than to get a citation from the feds for doing a renegade on 
     Alcatraz, IMHO. 
     
     Cheers,

Anyone thought about Angel Island, maybe?   It's that large island to the 
north - it has campsites on it, but no permanent inhabitants (I don't 
think - maybe a ranger?)

Hey, if this is the worst problem that occurred there with the law, I'd say
that's a pretty good sign of the local authorities attitude towards raves in
general.  I mean, if they wanted to they could make it much more difficult
than they have.  For instance, some of you may not have noticed yet but it
seems that certain people are taking ILLEGAL SUBSTANCES with them to raves.
Some people are even getting them there <gasp>.  Now, if the police really
wanted to give us any grief, that would be a perfect reason to start
something at a party.  I think what it comes down to is that most police
officers really are into just making sure that people aren't harmed against
their will (i.e. their rights are respected).  Sure, they have to ticket
parked cars because that's a pretty blatant breach of the law, but they do
let an awful lot of things slide that are illegal as long as no one is
getting hurt.

Well, now, this seems like an appropriate time for ol' Jake to put in his
two cents.  I remember reading about this same thing about a year or two ago
and being thoroughly amazed.  If anyone _ever_ tries to tell me that science
is dull and boring, then I tell them to have a look at quantum physics.
There are things there that are more magical then you'll ever read in a
storybook.  
        I was never interested in Physics until my senior year of high
school, mostly because I was totally ignorant of it.  After I started
learning about it, though, I was hooked.  I don't know how many other people
on this list have studied physics or at least dabbled in it, but I know for
sure that Brian has (being an Engineer and all).  Brian, I'd like to know if
your interest in the subject stems from the same place that mine does or
not, but I bet that it does at least in part.
        As opposed to people in many branches of science, I've found that
people involved in physics have a very strong regard for nature and
spirituality.   This is because you deal with it on such a primal level in
day to day life.  When you can see the fundamental tickings of the universal
clock so upclose, it is hard to feel that all of this is just a big
accident, that we're heading from nowhere to nowhere.  
        To be an effective physicist, especially in electronics or quantum
mechanics, you have to stretch what your mind is capable of believing.
There are lots of things that happen that defy what common sense would tell
you, for example that in certain instances electrons know that you're
watching them and behave differently.
        Now, tell me that you hear that and say, "oh yeah. physicists can't
appreciate spirituality."
        I've found that most physicists have a _very_ deep regard for nature
and what it can do that is very similar to that I've found in a lot of
rave-goers.  They recognize the interconnectedness of the whole world and
humanity's place within that chain.
        One example that comes to mind is a physicist I read about recently.
He was responsible for discovering Josephson junctions in the '60's, an
important discovery in quantum physics.  He dropped out of the scientific
community, feeling it was too stifling, and has since moved on to include
psychic phenomena and other less accepted ideas in his work.  Specifically,
he deals a lot with the way in which music and nature are intertwined, and
the way humanity uses that energy.
        Someone take that man to a rave!

Check out http://taz.hyperreal.com/raves/spirit/technoshamanism/
for a couple of articles on raving & physics.  One of them is a transcript
of a talk by Ovid Jacob, an ex-sfraver who is a Physicist at Stanford.
This talk was given at a few raves (including a Friends&Family) with a
backdrop of ambient music, and once with Dubtribe.  Ovid is very well
respected in his field (particle physics) and has told me that some of
his best ideas have come to him while trancing out at raves.  He even
dedicated one of his papers to the Albert Hoffman (among others).

Don't forget Relativity.  Weird shit happens when you start seeing things
in four dimensions.

Many of them don't.  The field requires a high degree of specialization if
you want to be able to make a significant contribution.  This was why I
chose not to go on to graduate school.

This sounds similar to Jack Sarfatti.  You might want to check out his
Physics Consciousness Research Group home page at:

http://www.hia.com/hia/pcr/

Getting back to raving:  I've always found the mathematical nature of
techno music to be very analogous to physics equations.  The way
sounds are used oftem speaks to us about fractals, frequencies, waveforms,
and spacetime.  This is true of much music, but *especially* techno,
which is music that is primarily *about* the structure of sound.

        Reply to:   Music labeling & physical raving
On the music labeling:
House, trance, techno, etc. are just names we use to help 
us figure out what type of sounds we like. We'll make up 
new ones when we get bored. 

I'm finishing up a book called "Trance and Music," by Gilbert 
Rouget. From the catalog description, it seemed like some 
sort of psychoacoustic guide to inducing trance states. 
Rather than turn me on to some sure-fire tricks to improve 
the music I've been trying to record, the book goes into a 
broad-based anthropological dissertation on the trance music 
of different cultures. The main theme of the work - backed 
up with empirical evidence to a fault - is that there is no 
discernible set of musical characteristics that elicit a trance 
response. Some trance music is purely vocal, some is vocal 
and instrumental, and it turns out that very little of the 
world's trance music is purely instrumental. It can be played 
fast, slow, or with a modulated tempo. The rhythmic patterns 
can vary every bit as much as the pitch and melody. It seems 
like people learn to trance to the music, rather than stumble 
upon music that causes a trance state. 

On the quantum mechanical implications of raving:
Quantum mechanics is just an analogy we use to help us 
understand the things around us. We'll contrive a new branch 
of physics when the universe gets bored with us.

Somewhat ironically, raving has helped me understand physics 
much more than the other way 'round. When I was in school, I 
became so disgusted with the quantum courses that I seriously considered bagging
my physics major in favor of music or 
literature. At the time, though, that would've meant leaving 
Harvey Mudd, and I guess the economics of the situation won 
out. I still think it's an ugly theory, but raving has helped 
me to lose most of the ego and objectivist hangups that rankle 
so hard with quantum. I did like your particle/vibe unification 
theory, Lee. :-)

The real problem arises when people lose sight of the fact that 
science is just a tool for understanding. Suddenly we're ready to 
kill, mutilate, and destroy "in the name of science." I guess that's 
another sense in which science and spirituality can merge. Perhaps 
that's reason enough to avoid making rave too much of a "cause."

take care!
-nate


PS - there's at least one other Mudd physics alum on this list, but he's 
prolly having too much fun as a house-luv'n thru-the-week-partying poet 
to ever admit he went to school with such a bunch of geeks. :-)

I'm going to pontificate about science and spirituality for
a bit, since this is a thread which I find quite
interesting...  Feel free to skip this message if you don't

You're right.. A lot of physicists don't understand and
appreciate spirituality.  As a physics student (btw, I just
passed my PhD thesis defense today!  yay!!!!!!), I think
that's a real shame.

Physics is the study of the physical world and its
properties.  It's a search for the underlying order behind
the universe.  To me, this has a spiritual flavor, although
some physicists would disagree.

In some sense, the scientific method may seem to be the
antithesis of spirituality.  However, it is important to
realize that the process of science involves much more than
the blind following of logical induction after logical
induction.  Some ideas come from great, intuitive leaps (as
symbolized by the fictional apple which fell on Netwon's
head).  These moments of enlightenment are the result a
tapping into an unconscious power within us, and a deep
reflection on the nature of the universe as a whole.

In my life, I've come to the conclusion that such progress
is most easily made as a part of an overall search for
harmony, balance, and meaning in life..  This is,
essentially, a spiritual quest.

yeah...  Me too.  I find myself making an analogy with
abstract mathematical systems moreso than physics
equations..  Take a 4 on the floor and add an acid squiggle
which doesn't repeat at the same rate as the basic rhythm,
and it's hard not to think of group theory and modular
arithmetic.. :)

Maybe physics is the only spirituality some physicists need. Who are
you (and who am I or anyone else) to decide on what form of
spirituality one needs to make better sense of the
world/life/universe/existence? Isn't that the ultimate point of 
spirituality, not the way it is attained/practiced?

Or must one ascribe to some fuzzy mumbo jumbo mystical explanation of
reality to be "spiritual"? And therefore, in your eyes, most 
physicists are not spiritual. ...

Sometimes I feel like the human mind has a special "bullshit" cortex
that feels pleasure when you can hold a deep belief about reality based
on "faith" alone, and that this "faith" is what people are calling
"spirituality" rather than the actions/practices/beliefs of the
religion/faith/etc. All questions bottom out at the articles of faith,
and these articles are held as being dogmatically true. 

Look at Christianity for a good example on this one -- certain
practices that we might find  innocuous or based on personal choice
(drugs, sexual orientation/interest/activity, abortion) are "of the
devil" with Christians. So you simply don't sit down with a Christian
and discuss the pros/cons of, say, abortion. Abortion is of the devil,
and you don't argue with the devil. 

Likewise, physicists/scientists bottom out their explanations on
"rationality" and the scientific method -- that parameters and their
effects can be individually controlled. Unfortunately, nature rarely 
works from a few small, well-behaved interactions, but rather, Billions
and Billions of fuzzy, random underlying interactions create an
emergent whole that cannot be parametrized or explained by a
rationalistic decomposition of reality into subcomponents. Nonetheless,
many scientists cannot let go of "rationality" as a method of
explaining reality. Rationalism is their faith.

I agree. I think most physicists would agree.

Sounds like that "faith" talking here. Yeah, you can ascribe it to
"unconscious power" and other mystic mumbo-jumbo, but sometimes the
time is ripe for a new idea to come into play, and all you really need
is a bunch of related discoveries/findings/developments, the
appropriate social milieu to foster communication/collaboration, and a
small intuitive leap resulting from a synthesis of ideas, a right
place, and a right time.

Of course, "reality" can be described through a variety of domains, so
one might look at the social/communicative/zeitgeist view I put forward
above in the "energy domain" and come up with a theory of "unconscious
power". SImilarly, you can look at any object in the
frequency/spacial-frequency or time/space-time domains and come up with
unique explanations for behavior in each domain.

I think it's probably most important to be able to take in lots of 
perspectives at the same time, and that's where empathy and
enlightenment come in....

the BSP thing is really not supposed to be that big a deal.  I hope
nobody here would object if someone here has something to offer they
want us to know about.  I *want* to know about these.

What I don't want, and most others don't either I think, is misuse of
this list for self-aggrandizement or profit.  Subscribing just so you
can post a promo fits that definition.  Subscribing so you can post
a promo and then stick around and participate in the list would be fine
with me.  

I also object to the idea that posting something here is like some big
favor that maybe we don't deserve or something.  We're friends here,
we're interested in each other projects and we want to know.  Doesn't
need any mo 'tude than that, word.

I'm not saying that the scientists at Fermilab should throw
away their accelerators and stare into crystals all day..
Believing in untrue things does not make you spiritual.
Spirituality is the development of the self.

Listen... I didn't mean to offend you with the use of the
words "unconscious power".  If I did, I apologize.  I'm not
saying that scientific developments come to us through some
kind of psychic link with the big electron in the sky!  By
"unconscious power" I didn't mean to imply that there was
anything mystical going on.  

What I was trying to get at is the process by which our
minds arrive at scientific insight.  Sometimes, it comes
through a series of logical deductions.  Other times, it
comes from an "aha" moment, in which we see what the answer
MUST be.  Of course, this insight is not useful unless we
can back it up our hypotheses using the scientific method.

I'm saying that we spend years and years absorbing it
all... trying to figure out how things work.. (this is the
deep reflections on the universe part) and that our mind is
somehow able to use that information to make leaps that we
sometimes can't explain right away.. "Aha!" we say, "I KNOW
that this must be the solution!"   

To me, these aha moments.. these moments of lucidity in
which everything becomes clear.. have aspects of
spirituality.. it's like an epiphany.

Then again, maybe something mystical is going on.  I think science is 
great, and helps us learn and understand alot.  Maybe there is some 
useful wisdom that isn't considered scientific.
I think that there are alot of valid experiences that science can't 
explain (yet?).  One can call these mystical mumbo jumbo, or one can say 
it is something that science can't explain yet.

I think the process of logical deductions is sometimes motivated by 
mystical experiences or an "aha moment".

I think spirituality goes beyond any definition, but also includes 
definitions.  There is alot about spirituality I understand, and there is 
alot about spirituality I don't understand.  Its feels good to have 
science explain some of the mysterys of the universe and to have "aha" 
(mystical) experiences which both can be helpful in bringing more of a 
sense of understanding to spirituality.
Thanks to those of you who have contributed to this physics and raving 
thread.  Its been an education.

I think the point Sho & I were making was that many physicists don't
see physics as a way to make sense of the entire realm of 
life/existence/reality/etc.  Usually, physics is seen merely as a
tool for explaining how a particle decays, or how a star is formed.
Just like christians who use their religion mainly to justify
their version of morality, or folks who rave just to get high and
hang out with friends - such a specific focus ignores the bigger
picture, which as you say, is the ultimate point of spirituality.

For example; in certain circles, theories of physics are merging
with theories of consciousness, time travel, alternate realities,
parallell universes, etc.  Most mainstream physicists have a dim
view of the legitimacy of extending physics into these realms.
Why?  Because they still think think that physics must reside in
the realm of more "rational" and observable phenonema.

> Likewise, physicists/scientists bottom out their explanations on

Only the less spiritual ones. :)  Actually, the forefronts of
even well established theories like QM and Relativity
challenge rational thinking.  Or at least they redefine what we
mean by rational thought.  There are paradoxes that defy logic.  
And once the mere existence of an observer affecting the outcome
of an experiment, the "scientific method" itself gets redefined.

There's a big difference between rationality that continues to
evolve into areas once considered to be irrational, and a faith
in a fixed concept (i.e. God).

I agree.  Physics appeals to me because it has the potential to
explain many things on the way to the *big* questions.  There's
something inconsistant (to me) about a belief system that claims
to tell my why I exist, but doesn't even attempt to explain why an
apple falls to the ground.

 My own opinion developed while I was in chemistry grad school is that I
observed two major types of scientists ( AT LEAST )... I'll call these the
technocrats and the dreamers - for lack of better labels.. Although both
groups were involved in studying science the technocrats usually plodded
along day to day building on other people's ideas and adding their own
contributions without any major insights. These people usually thought along
well developed channels and added only small increments to the overall body
of scientific knowledge. For them science was usually a job and not 
particularly a spiritual forum... 

  This contrasted with the dreamers. For this second group science was 
often a spiritual form of work. They immersed themselves in it and very 
often used intuitive insights to make "leaps of reason". They created 
ideas where none had existed before. These people were excited by their
work and were exciting to be around....

I'll give you 3 guesses as to which group was larger... and 2 of the guesses
don't count... many many of the famous early quantum phyicists fell into
the latter group (IMHO) and often wrote books on spirituality and/or the
meaning of life and had great interest in philosophy and arts. Many of the
scientists who simply plod through the system and then move into defense
contracts making a slightly better laser weapon or a better missle guidance
system often fall into the former...  Talk about generalizations :) 


But then I've noticed the same two groups in the arts... one copies other
peoples work adding their own small insights while the other group creates
stunning new styles of art by applying deep intuitive insights....

Oh well there seems to be a human condition buried in here somewhere...
While Michelangelo lay painting the Sistine there were 1000's of people
simply groveling to make it from day to day ( or wine bottle to wine
bottle ).....

All this tread about science etc. has brought me to something that attracted
me to " serious ravers " ( assuming it's possible to have serious FUN )

Science:
  I think Lee nicely summarized that the ultimate place for science is as
a methodology for unifying the whole of existence. And it's agreed that
many scientists don't use it this way....

Religion:
  When I consider religion, I assume the same - it should be a force to
unify all existence. Too often it's not.. For example Christians worship
a male god with no others... my line of questioning was always: Does god
have a penis ?  Answer ( after much confusion ) : I guess so - he's a man
and we're in his image.  My next question: So what does he use it for ?
Is there a Mrs. GOD ?  ( Try this line of questioning sometime - it's
especially amusing to watch young females struggle with it )  Bottom line
for me:  I have little use for a religion that ignores the beauty and
contribution that the female and/or female principle makes to the whole
of existence... there can be no true unity without it.

Raving:
  Many people go to raves to simply party and hang out. Often it makes little
difference whether it's a club rave or an underground. They are simply there
to be part of the scene or where the action is..  On the other hand, I was
both surprised and pleased when I found a group of people that experienced
raving as a means to unity - both self unity and group unity. Those whose
experience leads them to realize that it is fun to be high, aware and in
unity with both yourself and those around you. It is an expression of
ecstatic love to feel yourself moving to the beat of music and then to 
expand this experience to realize that you have become part of a larger whole
also moving to the beat of the music. This unity when experienced can take
us beyond our normal limits and move us into a state of ecstatic bliss...
exactly like the samadhi bliss state the masters describe when there is 
complete realization that all things are one... music has been used 
throughout history to help induce this unity state ( as have drugs, scents,
sex and visuals ).... raving in its purist form seems to be another 
manifestation of people seeking this unified state....

  And the beauty of it all is that during the experience the less thinking
that occurs and the more "doing/being" - the better the experience of unity.
ie this is not something to think about as much as it is to do.... so
let's get out there and smile, communicate and dance... these are special
times we are in so be sure to enjoy them.....

Just some ramblings from your local mad chemist/artist

	As a (former) physics undergrad I've watched the physics back and forth 
with some interest, but I do have to comment on this:

> For example; in certain circles, theories of physics are merging
> with theories of consciousness, time travel, alternate realities,
> parallell universes, etc.  Most mainstream physicists have a dim
> view of the legitimacy of extending physics into these realms.
> Why?  Because they still think think that physics must reside in

	Physics, by definition, concerns itself with observables.  The purpose 
of theory is to predict observables.  As the observations become more detached 
from day to day reality, the theories become more abstract and 
counter-intuitive, but nonetheless they are still only there to "explain" the 
observable universe.

	This is not to say that many theories do not have a philosophical basis, 
or that I think they shouldn't be used as models for things other than the 
physical world.  However, I think many physicists are a bit wary of the 
popularization of theory because they don't want to have to concern themselves 
with popular philosophical or spiritual implications when they create/extend a 
theory.  That idea is anathema to modern science...  look what happened to 
Galileo.

>It's not that uncommon among DJ's to not understand musical structure.

I understand, I used to live with a fairly good DJ who didn't know barely
anything about musical structure.  He has since started composing and is
learning more all the time, but at first, it was wierd how much he did'nt know.

I've heard good DJ's do this and if done correctly it can add to the mix.
I've sometimes dropped the needle into the middle of a song and got mixed up
in my head where the "one count" is supposed to be, and the song sounds
totally different.  I know it is possible to pull-off mixing on the off
count, but maybe this guy just didn't do it good enough.  I'm not trying to
argue or anything, I've just heard it done, and sometimes it sounds really
good. IMHO.

        Reply to:   RE>UNITY - science, religion, raves

Deep, especially the part on the raves.  So very true...  On the religious
tip, several Christian groups are opening up the idea of GOD being a being
not necessarily a person male or female, as well as viewing other ways of
worship (in other words other religions) as a means of bringing unity and
harmony to themselves and their surrounding environment.  I know quite a few
Catholics who practice or observe many of the Zen Buddhist rites, I also know
quite a few people who incorporate traditional Native American or African
concepts, ideas, and prayers into their Christian worship.  It's not so much
as New Age movement (by the way I know several Native Americans offended by
the New Age movement), but rather an expansion of bringing themselves in
touch with their surroundings and themselves... I would say it's all good :>

All this tread about science etc. has brought me to something that attracted
me to " serious ravers " ( assuming it's possible to have serious FUN )

Science:
  I think Lee nicely summarized that the ultimate place for science is as
a methodology for unifying the whole of existence. And it's agreed that
many scientists don't use it this way....

Religion:
  When I consider religion, I assume the same - it should be a force to
unify all existence. Too often it's not.. For example Christians worship
a male god with no others... my line of questioning was always: Does god
have a penis ?  Answer ( after much confusion ) : I guess so - he's a man
and we're in his image.  My next question: So what does he use it for ?
Is there a Mrs. GOD ?  ( Try this line of questioning sometime - it's
especially amusing to watch young females struggle with it )  Bottom line
for me:  I have little use for a religion that ignores the beauty and
contribution that the female and/or female principle makes to the whole
of existence... there can be no true unity without it.

Raving:
  Many people go to raves to simply party and hang out. Often it makes little
difference whether it's a club rave or an underground. They are simply there
to be part of the scene or where the action is..  On the other hand, I was
both surprised and pleased when I found a group of people that experienced
raving as a means to unity - both self unity and group unity. Those whose
experience leads them to realize that it is fun to be high, aware and in
unity with both yourself and those around you. It is an expression of
ecstatic love to feel yourself moving to the beat of music and then to 
expand this experience to realize that you have become part of a larger whole
also moving to the beat of the music. This unity when experienced can take
us beyond our normal limits and move us into a state of ecstatic bliss...
exactly like the samadhi bliss state the masters describe when there is 
complete realization that all things are one... music has been used 
throughout history to help induce this unity state ( as have drugs, scents,
sex and visuals ).... raving in its purist form seems to be another 
manifestation of people seeking this unified state....

  And the beauty of it all is that during the experience the less thinking
that occurs and the more "doing/being" - the better the experience of unity.
ie this is not something to think about as much as it is to do.... so
let's get out there and smile, communicate and dance... these are special
times we are in so be sure to enjoy them.....

Just some ramblings from your local mad chemist/artist

The bullshit cortex is quite amazing really.  Our minds seemed to be
designed/evolved (take your pick) to identify non-causal relationships. The
whole causality in reality bit is rather new to the human mindscape and
seems to be useful for a few things here and there. :-)  As a method of
thinking, causal analysis takes years and years to learn while we all do
non-causal analysis from the day we are born.

In my opinion, the human race has gotten a lot farther on non-causal
thinking that it has on causal. When you are chased by a tiger in the
jungle, the last thing you are thinking is A->B->C.  So, do not downgrade
the importance of non-causal thinking, or you may get eaten.

Ciao,

PT

There will be an outdoor party tomorrow put on by the :) crew.  Its usually
a variety of music that ranges from good 'ol breakneck Techno to some good
ass, deep ass 909 House, straight up your butt.  So if you wanna see the
sunrise with a group of good guys & gals, check it out.

Remember, there is only one kind of music...the kind that makes you dance.

Hope to see you all there!

       I agree, and i think that it's only recently that we/i in the west
have realized (in that 'aha' sort of way) how much a role things like
'simultanaity' or 'symbiosis' or 'synergism' play in reality. I think part
of it is that there is less dichotomous distinction b/n 'this' and 'that'
whether it be cause and effect or whatnot.
        to make this rave related-->when i'm out dancing and having a good
time i think "is it the music that's making me feel good or is it that i'm
feeling good and the music sounds better" well, i think it's both
simultaneously :)

HEY KIDS - I saw this episode of Next Step (on the Discovery channel) about
this weird game called Q-Zar which is played in a warehouse in Dublin,
California.  What it is is laser tag, but you're in this HUGE warehouse
with black lights and strobe lights and fog machines and guns that
compliment you  when you score a hit on someone .... totally Robocop in
feel ... you can run around in there playing space cowboy with 14 people on
your side against the other 15!!!

I don't know how much it is or anything ... this was just a clip from an
upcoming show.  But I thought if anyone knew where Dublin was and happened
to be nearby you might like to go check it out - sounds like a hell of a
lot of fun!!!

I find it interesting how our human condition seems to feel the need to 
make sense of everything.
 I find when I'm really involved in raving, my desire to make sense out 
of it deminishes.  I find that there is less need to make sense out of 
it, because raving is making so MUCH sense (sensations) to me.
So much so, that it seems that the making of sense is not happening, 
rather it feels more like the becoming sense, being sense. 
Does this make any sense? :)

What we like to think of as the "logical" part of our brain is 
probably a very (evolutionarily) recent development, and only
becomes necessary in a modern society.  Here's how it happened.

The Alice in Wonderland quote "What I tell you three times is
true" is basically the way our brain works.  The more we encounter
a chain of events, the more we link them together in our minds.
"OK, I ate the purple thing and got sick.  Thak ate the purple
thing and got sick.  Grog was drunk and ate it anyway, and he got
sick too."  This is valid reasoning, and everything from an
amoeba to a shark can do this.  It requires none of what we call
"conscious thought".  So why isn't it enough?

In a word: deception.  Most of the information we get about how the
world lives is second or third-hand, thanks to modern technology
like speech, writing, and more recently television, movies, radio,
and so on.

This information has been shaped, molded, cast, fired, and painted by
someone else -- someone responsible for making a profit on their
presentation, whether it be the latest Bruce Willis action-adventure,
a Disney film about a Native American woman who died of clap, or the
nine-o-clock news.  (And let's not forget the advertising embedded in
all of these.)  Therefore, their primary responsibility is to tell
you something you _want_ to hear, so you will choose to consume their
pseudo-experience instead of someone else's.

Because of this divorce of experience from reality, we can no longer
trust our senses to give us accurate information.  Sure, we know
_intellectually_ that TV isn't real, but our hindbrain doesn't know
that.  It sees these images of women caressing big cars, and the 
connection "expensive car = women" is reinforced, despite its lack of
grounding in any reality but the wishes of car manufacturers.

This is why I never watch television, rarely go see films, and don't
read the newspaper much -- because I know I can't trust my conscious,
logical forebrain to ride herd on my poor, deluded hindbrain.  I wish
my desires to be my own, and over time I'm finding some of them through
actually going out and _experiencing_ stuff.

I still read a lot, but I have some control over reading -- I can stop,
think, and choose.  TV and other real-time spectacles don't leave 
you that luxury.

Does this make sense to anyone?

Honey, who Does your hair?

downhear at Cafe Dunord is leading the lounge movement 
in San Francisco.  This is a Divine little party.

I've been waiting _patiently_ for an ostentatious, ultra beautiful,
painfully fashionable, hip, trendy to a tee, new wealth, upscale, give 
me service or get out of my fucking way, network, contact, elitist, yankee,
schmoozefest, artful, collaborative, flower, candle, fine cigarette,
speakeasy, this band sucks, Lounge Gathering that is all Vibe and
terribly fun to Arrive in this fair city of ours.

I like Mod.

I also like the mid-80's mall hairdo's that seem to be
increasingly popular with the clubset.

Black Diamond has the lounge Vibe in a dance setting.

this Is rave.

In from England, a trans-atlantic lounge dj informs me that this
type establishment is All the Rage.  He liked my tape.

John, your predeliction for blaming the perceived evils of the 
universe on modern society is starting to get boring.  Reality will
always be illusory to a large degree.  You were being deceived from
the day your momma stuck a pacifier in your mouth.  The animal
kingdom has always used deception in courtship, territorial
displays, evasion from predators, hunting, etc.  Plants too.
Things are never what they seem.  Solids are really mostly empty space.
The moon is bigger than it looks.

Since when?

> Does this make sense to anyone?

Sure it does.  In our neverending search for the truth, we often
end up deceiving ourselves.

I guess you don't allow yourself to dream or fantasize either.
Or do you think you are in control of those things?

Sometimes when I rave (here's where I twist this into relevancy)
a part of me starts to feel what a phony delusion this sense of
unity/vibe/oneness/harmony really is.  And for some reason, I
decide that it doesn't matter.  Absolute Truth must include
falseness; every path is real.  I wish you the best on yours.

It makes perfect sense.  I don't watch TV, and involve my self with as
little media as possible (never read the newspaper - never really have my
whole life).  I do read alot and spend much of my time reflecting and
working on my spirituality.  I've found that less media can greatly increase
a persons vibrational frequency.  I can now physically feel the vibrations
of a TV and am amazed at what it has the potential to do to a person....what
it is actually doing to people all over the planet.

There's one right by San Jose City College.... on Moorepark(sp?), I think.

I've played similar games before in New Jersey.  There's even indoor and
outdoor paintball places if you like getting a little more messy and physical.

        very much so...i'm so thankful that i stubled upon things like the
Tao te Ching and the concept of thing just being 'as they are' (in western
terms i call it 'shit happens' ;) and i think that i used to think too much
(especially about how and why i was thinking about thinking...) the
revelations i got both from raving and reading about zen and taoism allowed
my mind to hop out of it's own self-imposed labyrinth and have that
'dancing no-mind' sensation.
        now, if i could only do it at home at will...
                brad

ps-->once you realize that the most beautiful and important things in what
we call 'reality' are inarticulable and not easily quantized by things like
'rationality' and/or 'logic' you can begin to simply be and enjoy...well,
IMHO at least :)

A few years ago, this type of approach also made perfect sense to me; 
perfect sense, that is, until I started to feel quite isolated. 
Paradoxically, I also realized that the media concepts that I was so 
desperately trying to avoid, in my search for perceptual purity, in fact 
pervaded my life as much as they had in the past. These 
were communicated to me indirectly, via other people's behavior, via 
billboard advertizing, via junk mail, etc.etc.etc... There was no way to shut
out the reprehensible aspects of society by turning my back to 
them. They were there, everywhere. And working on my spirituality from 
within this idealized vacuum turned out to be utterly useless: the 
tenuous states of realization were always to be shattered by contact with 
the more "common" world. Any feelings of enlightenment just turned out to 
be levels of mental masturbation. I was really not all that different 
from my next door neighbor.

I now watch TV, read the paper, participate in all kinds of mass-media 
idiocy, and I am no worst off because of it, but I certainly don't take 
any of it seriously.

Isn't the rave thing all about breaking down barriers? Isn't cutting 
oneself off from the collective creating an *me*/*us* versus *them* 
mentality? Isn't this just another instance of repressing the Shadow and 
giving it more power?

 >I know it is possible to pull-off mixing on the off count

I love DJs who can pull this off, especially if I'm familiar with the
track(s) it can really blow my mind.  Many tracks seem to encourage this with
HEAVY accents(not the kick but some stabby percussive thing like a 909 lo
tom) on off beats that are as easy to beatmatch to as the kick.  Mixing
another record in beatmatched to these off beats and slowly increasing the
volume subtly shifts the location of the downbeat until you're in the other
record and somehow the 1 ain't where it was.   Its a lot like the syncopation
common in latin styles and can have a poly-rhythmic feel.  Speaking of which,
someone told me that there have been some records released recently in 3/4
and 5/4.  True?  Some acid tracks have 303 lines that are so convoluted that
identifying where they repeat is hard and with a kick on every beat,
continuous hi-hats, and other percussion elements that drift in and out it
becomes very hard to say whether its in any time signature let alone whether
its 2, 4, or 8 bar phrasing.

Yeah, its kinda weird how fast nostalgia occurs these days and I think its
getting faster.  Another example of an increase in the speed of life(MTV's
continually faster edits/shorter clips being another.)  I got to admit that
those giant "bangs hairsprayed straight up like fans a-blowin' in that
air-conditioned mall"  do something for me -- I know I need help.  Anyone
know where to score a Centipede upright video game? I need one in my living

Found this at a WWW site, thought it was funny and someone else might enjoy it!

You might be a redneck, if... You've
ever had to climb a water tower with a can of spray paint to defend your
sisters honor. Your mother does not remove the Marlboro from her mouth
before telling the state trooper to "kiss my ass." Your front porch collapses
and kills more than three dogs. Your richest relative buys a new house and
you help take the wheels off of it. You ever cut your grass and found a car.
Your wife has ever said, "Come move this transmission so I can take a
bath." You refer to the time you won a free case of motor oil as "the day
my ship came in". You own a home that is mobile and 5 cars that aren't.
You think the stock market has a fence around it. Your stereo speakers
used to belong to the Moonlight Drive-in Theater. You keep a can of RAID
on the kitchen table. You hammer bottle caps into the fame of your front
door to make it look nice. You've ever spray painted your girlfriends name
on an overpass.

Love, Big Z

I understand your point and partially agree, but:

Your right, we arn't that different, but:

We all carry aroung "baggage" from our past (childhood, pastlives, past
universes, etc., take it where you wish).  I feel in order to evolve
ourselves we need to heal our past and let go or our "baggage".  In order to
heal our past, we must face it, and in order to face it we must remember.
(I personally can't/don't think/reflect/change while I'm watching TV)  In my
former life (during this lifetime), I was cought up with the media,
Republican (the kind that just votes thier party straight down the line), a
marketing major, my dream was to own a nice house, car, and be rich....then
I would be happy.  Well luckily I found God....From the beginning I knew
that God was not male or female or necessarily even a person at all....you
see, God's picture was always printed on the little tiny squares of paper I
would eat.  I ate lots of those squares, and saw God lots of times.  Those
little squares changed me. (not them alone, but that's where it started)

I've since done a 180 degree turn and changed my entire life.  I no longer
need a little square of paper to see or know God (or what ever you want to
call it).  I now work on my issues, programs, patterns, blocks, baggage, and
barriers my self. I've replaced the little square with tools from my own
mind.  I can now remove barriers myself.  There is no TV in my house, nor do
I receive the newspaper.  I find it much easier to work on my issues without
media exposure.  And my issues are what I need to work on.  The only way to
heal this planet of ours is to heal ourselves.  We need to work on ourselves
first.  I really do believe that for each person who "wakes up" it causes a
huge change for the planet and entire Univers.   Now all this doesn't mean I
run when I see a TV, I just don't like the feeling it gives me.  I know I am
different than before, and I will continue to grow and change.  I feel no
need at this point to integrate media into my life.  I don't need to know
that 13 people were murdered today in my city, or that Tide is on sale, or
that Tampax keeps me "fresh".  I believe the TV is used to keep people in
one line of thinking, and that's _fear_ or _just plain lack thereof_.  I'd
rather write music, read or something (I feel) is more constructive.


>I now watch TV, read the paper, participate in all kinds of mass-media 
>idiocy, and I am no worst off because of it, but I certainly don't take 
>any of it seriously.

My hat is off to you sir.


>Isn't the rave thing all about breaking down barriers? 

Yes, I can agree with that, but try to explain a concept like "Vibe" someone
like I use to be.  Or Unity.  I would have never listened before.

>Isn't cutting oneself off from the collective creating an *me*/*us* versus
*them* mentality?

No, not necessarily.  It can, but it doesn't have to.  I don't believe that
what's shown on TV and the media is really what the "collective" is.  By
removing media from my life, I've become more Earth conscious.  I now _care_
about this planet we live on, as well as all of the life that exists here.
I don't think media is inherently "bad", I just don't like what I see it
being used for, so I don't subscribe.

Isn't this just another instance of repressing the Shadow and 
>giving it more power?

I'm not repressing it, or giving it more power.  Judging it as bad or wrong
is repressing it and will give it more power.  I don't want it repressed or
necessarily removed, I'd really just like to see it change.  

Oh, and about the issues getting to me anyway from other sources, the
important ones that I need to know about do reach me.  The more I evolve,
the more redily available the important information is.  When I need to know
it, it will be there for me.  I no longer need to chase.  This has been my
experience.

YES!

That church-going, TV-worshipping, elvis-seeing person living in the trailer
park down the road just might know some things about life that would suprise the
hell out of you.

Seems we labor under a few misconceptions in this evil modern society of ours:

- that wealth implies intelligence
- that intelligence implies wisdom
- that wisdom implies happiness

Some of the happiest moments of my life have come from doing pretty stupid,
seemingly-childish things that definitely didn't bring in any income.

Elitism doesn't bring you any closer to truth, it just limits the number of
people you feel comfortable saying "hi" to.

Can't help with the upright Centipede, but got lots of hairspray!! 
And speaking of the speed of life... It's funny how songs from about 4 to 5
years ago are now considered "old school" or "history of modern rock".  Are
things evolving that fast or am I thinking that slow...  Could it be that
inner child in me refusing to grow up?  Could it be technology is moving us
at a pace faster than we as cognitive thinking beings need to go?  Could it
be the stuff in the water?

I once mentioned to a friend how sick I was of retro-
60's, 70's, 40's, 80/50's- oy vey! She pointed out that historically
it is common at the end of a century for retro-styles to 
be all the rage. I just thought that was interesting... 

Also, perhaps the advances that we are making in technology 
are a bit frightening on some level, and people are consequently
using nostalgia as a buffer to make that scary techno stuff ok 
to assimilate. Probably not, eh?

One of my co-workers always tells me I look like a "dead-president's

It's the rave golden years.   
I don't think it's that fast - we're just getting slower.
(ok - I'll speak for myself)  

Seems like 10 years has always been about right for those
first bits of retro anything.  Rarely is it very interesting
at that stage.  With the notable exception, of course, of mall hair.

> (mall hair does it for me) --- I know I need help

sick but so very true  ;^)
should we start a support group?

Alright, first we hit Hickory Farms for all the free samples.
Then Baskin Robbins for ice cream.  Regroup at the fountain.
You can play Atari for at least 15 minutes over at JC Penney.
Intellivision at Monkey Wards.  I love the furniture section on 
the 3rd floor of Sears.  See's Candy - no really, it's my mom's 
birthday and she likes either the carmel snaps or the maple bars 
and I'd know _for_sure_ if I could just sample them.  Perfume 
wars at Macy's.

Have you even seen the girl working at Gemco?

There's one here in Reno at the Hilton. 
They also have this huge setup of virtual reality rides--
which I just got around to trying last night. The one I went on was built 
for two people and showed you a movie of flying over the desert or 
through space. This one actually turned you upside down and kept you 
there for a while. It was neat hanging in mid-air, especially when you 
didn't know what was going to happen next!  :)

I admire the change that you have affected in your life. And I agree that 
cutting oneself off for a while provides an ideal cocoon for 
introspective work. Yet, once on the other side of the process of 
breaking oneself down, and reintegrating the personality, I prefer to 
reconnect with the mass consciousness, knowing full well that it cannot 
have the same hold it had on me before. And my interest in the media 
comes partly from a desire to keep conscious of that state of awareness 
called middle America, knowing full well that most people live there. No, 
I definitely don't care that Tide or Tampax may be on sale, but I 
definitively do care that 13 people were murdered. I want to know what is 
going on, and how my state of mind stands with respect to other's.
  
Ultimately, I feel that the PLUR/community feel of some raves exists in 
the same way as does the "vibe" from the media, and namely as an 
interpretation of the world. While the former may appear better than the 
latter, it is nonetheless, a relative perspective.  Exclusively adopting 
one over the other may prove to be dangerous, not because of the 
pathologies inherent to a particular view-point, but rather as a result of 
the static and self-righteous characteristics innate in fixating solely on 
one interpretive system.

IMO, the sudden feeling of loneliness that some people have reported 
experiencing at the height of an rave, a feeling that has washed 
over me too, is a gut awareness that I am, within that ecstatic state, 
just as alone as I was before, albeit in a different way. And depending 
on my perspective, I am also just as connected. Both interpretations are 
true and valid. The one always seems to hit me when I am convinced that 
the other is other is all there is. Yet this is a good thing: I prefer to be 
blissed out and aware of the relativity of this state.

Hey -- this is actually directly rave related!

We've all been at parties where, for whatever reason, things just
ain't goin' off.  Now what do you do?  Some ideas:

-DJ trainwreck!  Can't keep the trance going.  Try to dance to both
records at once!  Do those little shuffle-stutter steps, kind of
a soft-shoe action.  For advanced ravers, try moving one side of your
body in time with one record and the opposite side with the other.
Guaranteed to burn calories and exercise brain cells.

-No strobes!  Get up as close as you can to a steady bright light, close
your eyes, and wave your hand in front of your face with fingers spread.
Guaranteed to cause cool psychedelic-style imagery if the light is
bright enough.  A steady motion is best, for optimal 6-10Hz flicker.

-Too tired!  You're about to fall asleep on your feet and your ride
won't leave until 8 AM.  Find a cozy place behind the stacks and go for it!
Amazing half-asleep dreams will ensue.  Wear earplugs for best muffleage of
irritating highs, and passage of dream-inducing bass booms.  After 1/2 hour
to 45 minutes you will be fresh as a daisy.  Go to the WC and splash water
on your face for best effect.

-Nobody's dancing!  The dance floor is as empty and featureless as the Black
Rock Desert.  Who cares?  Go dance anyway.  Unless the music blows people
will join you.

-Attitude!  People look at you like you're from Mars.  Run with it!  Pretend
you're a Martian, studying primate mating ritual.  Try to guess who will be
hit on next.  Inquire of the bartender the chemical composition of sour mix.
Ask people strange anthropology questions.
There are lots of solutions to the attitude problem.  Bubbles are good; get
the kit with the different pipes.  The kazoo is best for big single bubbles,
the four-jet pipe best for lots of tiny ones.  The straw is worthless and
gets soap in your mouth.  If a fan is available use it with the regular
wand for truly impressive quantities.

-Angst!  You're feeling terrible and alone and the sun's never going to
come up and you're hungry besides.  Find an unoccupied person and ask
them for an exchange of hugs.  Sometimes it'll take a couple tries but
it'll cheer you both up.  Do _not_ just sit there and look depressed, it'll
just get worse and worse.

Anyone got more?

It's the rave golden years.   
I don't think it's that fast - we're just getting slower.
(ok - I'll speak for myself)  

Seems like 10 years has always been about right for those
first bits of retro anything.  Rarely is it very interesting
at that stage.  With the notable exception, of course, of mall hair.

> (mall hair does it for me) --- I know I need help

sick but so very true  ;^)
should we start a support group?

Alright, first we hit Hickory Farms for all the free samples.
Then Baskin Robbins for ice cream.  Regroup at the fountain.
You can play Atari for at least 15 minutes over at JC Penney.
Intellivision at Monkey Wards.  I love the furniture section on 
the 3rd floor of Sears.  See's Candy - no really, it's my mom's 
birthday and she likes either the carmel snaps or the maple bars 
and I'd know _for_sure_ if I could just sample them.  Perfume 
wars at Macy's.

Have you even seen the girl working at Gemco?

I don't.  This may sound callous, but let me explain.

If they were people whose murder I could be doing anything _at all_ about,
like people who lived in my neighborhood, or who I otherwise knew and 
could help protect by building a community in which this is less likely
to happen, I would care.  I can't do anything about Bosnians trying to
shoot each other -- am I going to walk on over the border and tap some
guy on the shoulder and say "Put down that rifle, can't we all be friends?"
<BLAM>

The Big Lie of mass media is an implication -- that what happens around the
world is more important than what's going on on your street, in your
neighborhood, with your friends.  We spend all our time worrying about
Eastern Europe and not much taking care of ourselves and our friends; at
least most of us do.  This allows the most outrageous invasions of privacy,
liberty, happiness, and love to take place, because someone can always
point to someplace where things are worse and imply that we should spend
our time helping the people there -- which, conveniently, we cannot.  How
much of Live Aid got to actual refugees?  Very little.  How much did it 
matter, even if it did?  Zero.  The next year, there were still too many 
people on too little arable land, and kids still starved.  Meanwhile our
own country continued to consume its own natural resources at a frightening
rate, institute mandatory sentencing for most drug offenses, and give $2-4,000
of YOUR money to rich people in CA and TX via the S&L bailout.  (That's
from EACH of us.  Yep.)

This is why raving is important to me -- it is a chance to spread some love
around, and build a temporary community of people that care for each other,
while often pushing the boundaries of what is acceptable to society.

true... but I still would prefer to know about what is goin' on than not. 
And that knowledge isn't going keep me from "acting locally".
For me, it's also a matter of simple curiosity about events outside my 
immediate neighborhood...

	Angel Island sounds like another interesting site.  The reason I 
mentioned Alcatraz though is because I feel the beauty and uniqueness of 
the place make it an ideal location for a rave, other considerations aside.
If I had to be in prison somewhere and had the choice of where to serve 
time, it would quite possibly be there.  The cellblocks have a lot of 
character and charm compared to more modern jails.  It wouldn't be a bad 
place to get some writing and thinking done.

	I don't think there would be a problem of too many people trying 
to attend.  The time committment of most of the day coming over on the ferry 
and waiting, not to mention the risk of getting caught and facing legal 
repercussions, would probably be enough to deter all but the most daring 
(some would say foolish) ravers.  Also the illicit nature of the event 
would dictate that it not be widely publicized.  I seriously doubt you'd 
get as many as 100 people, unless Wicked tried to set it up as the full 
moon party.  :)
	The idea of getting there by private boat occurred to me, but not 
knowing anything about boating or sailing, I don't know how feasible it 
might be.  My suspicion is that the rangers who stay overnight on 
Alcatraz are more on the lookout for secret landing attempts than the 
possibility of someone coming by legal means and simply staying on.  
Also, the geography of the island would appear to make it *very* risky to 
attempt a night landing anywhere but the single boat dock, which would 
increase the likelihood of being spotted.
	I don't remember any turnstile going onto the island or anyone 
counting heads, but I could be mistaken in this.  It's also possible they 
count you when you get on and off the boat at the mainland.
	There's all kinds of pitfalls in this idea, to be sure, but 
that's part of what makes it so exciting.  Alcatraz is forbidden fruit, 
and we all know what tastes best.  Besides, just think:  If Eve hadn't 
picked that apple, we might all still be a bunch of Forrest Gumps walking 
around without a clue.  ;)

Honey, who Does your hair?

downhear at Cafe Dunord is leading the lounge movement 
in San Francisco.  This is a Divine little party.

I've been waiting _patiently_ for an ostentatious, ultra beautiful,
painfully fashionable, hip, trendy to a tee, new wealth, upscale, give 
me service or get out of my fucking way, network, contact, elitist, yankee,
schmoozefest, artful, collaborative, flower, candle, fine cigarette,
speakeasy, this band sucks, Lounge Gathering that is all Vibe and
terribly fun to Arrive in this fair city of ours.
...
this Is rave.

In from England, a trans-atlantic lounge dj informs me that this
type establishment is All the Rage.  He liked my tape.

Dave
---------------------------------------------------------

Everytime I encounter this lounge thing, I can't help but think of my
dad's box of circa '62 playboys I used to dig through as a kid: 
big hair, big breasts, with all the important stuff artfully concealed.

Not to revive any geographic flag-waving or burning (pleazse!), but my 
sources tell me LA's way ahead of SF on this tip.

Frankly, I can't see much in common between lounge and rave except
a bigass smile that leaves the uninitiated scratching their domes. And
I'm kinda wondering why this all didn't happen in the eighties, when the
well-heeled grin was definitely in. I guess that's first mistake 
fashion-clueless people like me make - trying to cast it into some 
socio-eco phenom.

The way I see it, lounge ain't rave, dave, it's wave, and hopefully I can 
duck under this big sucka.

-nate

(and just in case anyone thinks dave's jumping on some wagon, I saw him 
with a healthy stack of such ancient vinyl late last year, seeds for a 
budding DJ)

        actually the 'theory' of post-modernism is that the culture of
modernism reached its peak and saw that it could go nowhere so it exploded.
and now, we're playing with the fragments of past cultures and, i suppose,
hypothetical future cultures :) i would agree that there are those who
would prefer to live back in 'simpler' times thus the nostalgia factor but
seriously, yesterday was a simple time from the viewpoint of _now_ because
you've been there, know what i'm sayin'?

hey, i'm back from tahiti; no raving there whatsoever...

  the operator of a roulette (yes, they gamble now down there!) wheel
    in papeete saw a tiedye i wuz wearing, and said, "looks like a raver
     shirt".  when we talked about the subject for a while, it became \
      clear that the french are frowning on all-nite techno parties,
       due to connections with certain chemicals, etc...  also, someone
        did once try importing international DJ's down there (maybe on
         their way to australia???) but it never caught on; apparently
          locals are too much in to older styles of dance music due to
           the third-world timelag factor you see in outlying areas...

anyway, regarding the implanting of thots by tv ads, movies, etc., i'd
   like to say, "bring'em on!"  personally, i love tv and find ads to
    be an endless source of absolute hilarity, especially the type which
     try to make you look cool if you buy the product.  maybe i've got
      a built-in bs detector (probably not), but whatever the case, 
       tv is meant IMHO to be mind candy, and should be taken as such.
        even the news is now edited to fit the music, if you know what
         i mean...
furthermore, even the rottenest tv is ripe material for plagerism into
     high art by a talented kid with a video toaster, so why not treat
      it as a raw material?

just my 2 franc's worth...


ia orana!

Yeah, I know that feeling.  Sometimes I'll walk into a room and see people
watching tv and really feel like I have to leave, just because I don't want
to be around the television.  Seriously, I know people (and I'm sure you all
do to) who spend several hours in front of the tv and it really just starts
to take over your brain.  I guess Max Headroom wasn't too far off.

"She pointed out that historically it is common at the end of a century for
retro-styles to be all the rage."

fin de siecle [French, end of the century]
 : of, relating to, or characteristic of the close of the 19th century and
esp. its literary and artistic climate of sophistication, world-weariness,
and fashionable despair

And this isn't just the end of the century coming up in 5!! years its the end

too narrow, but I like it 
oy vey, the forties stuff is great these days.

I doubt it's even close.  But I don't know.

> The way I see it, lounge ain't rave, dave, it's wave

it's all the same.  it's all the people.  you tell me what it
takes for a party to be a rave ... is it club or a rave?  is alcohol
allowed or just cuz some people are idiot drunks does that ruin it?
how about nitrous? - you can't get any stupider than on that shit
and would you suggest that there aren't morons on e?

do there have to be lasers?  dancing?  what about ravers who dig 
chill rooms?  Do you have to wear baggy jeans?  What does the 
music have to be?  Can you rave while playing golf?
can you make fun of hippies, zippies, obnoxious bores?
Do you have to follow the rave code of ethics??
can you scam on mall babes?

narrow it down
to just what
you like
and then
stay there
don't do
anything 
outside of 
that cuz it
wouldn't be
truly rave
then
would
it?

who cares if your corny, or cheesy, 
or rude, or it sucks, or its obvious.
who cares if ya get slammed (vw)

pigeon holes are boring as shit.  so are half the raves being
thrown these days.  a room full of people going for it is as close
to a rave definition as I can think of.  open wide.
say aaahhhhhhh ...

I could not help but add this loving message to the topic-
<<<<<<<<<<<<Have SEX with your T.V.- It's safer>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>


In 1982 I was employed as a salesman at an audio/video store in New York City
and I would sit and stare at a bank of television sets. I have been involved 
with Zen meditation for over 20 years and while in a state of no- mind (at 
work) I discovered that the people on television were responding to 
fluctuations in my mental state. I was later to learn that I was producing a 
spot of bright light in the lens of the broadcasting television camera. 

Since 1983 I've been using this luminescent effect to wreak havoc in the 
incipient mind of the media/state. I have learned to control the effect so 
that I can induce more eye blinking, more stammering, etc. by changing the 
brightness and location of the spot of light which I cause to appear in the 
broadcasting TV camera. 

In 1991 I decided to create an experiment which would be verifiable to the 
public at large, so that I might prove the existence of the phenomenon to the 
skeptical community. So, I came up with the Thursday test. Every Thursday I 
illuminate the cameras of the ABC Evening News. Watchers of the show can do 
various things to prove the veracity of my claims. They can count the number 
of times Peter Jennings blinks on Thursday as compared with Friday or 
Wednesday. They can measure the reflected luminosity of the spot of light on 
Peter's eyeballs or they can count the number of mis-speaks. 

I've been zapping all presidential tv appearances since late 1983. If you 
watch the first 1984 Reagan debate you will notice my efforts. I zapped the 
presidential and vice-presidential debates in 1992 - in an attempt to prevent 
the re-election of Bush/Quayle. 

Millions of people know about this phenomenon and harbor knowledge of it
through a "cult of secrecy." There is no real conspiracy in the public, it is 
just that people do not tell others of this story unless provoked. There have 
been  quite a few pop songs written in homage; these usually use innuendo to 
refer to the phenomenon. 

My intent on Internet is to inform the public of this process. My intent is 
infinite and immaculate in its beautifully chaotic illuminative 
interventions; wreaking havoc with light. Photonic agents of bliss 
infiltrating the minds of commerce and
conspiracy.

Yeah, I know that feeling.  Sometimes I'll walk into a room and see people
watching tv and really feel like I have to leave, just because I don't want
to be around the television.  Seriously, I know people (and I'm sure you all
do to) who spend several hours in front of the tv and it really just starts
to take over your brain.  I guess Max Headroom wasn't too far off.

i don't wanna sound TOO critical, but regarding affecting the
  nightly news by gazing into a tv screen, i'm sure most peeple
    realize that NO nightly news is actually live; it's all tape-delayed.
does this mean yer gaze is transcending the space-time continuum, and
  if so, how does it know where to go, if the tape was shipped across
    the continent from the studio to the broadcast facility???

just a chaotic question

Hello,

I am the managing editor for URB Magazine, the underground dance music
publication. I am writing in an effort to reach out to the national on-line
rave community.

San Francisco is a very important place for me. We at URB feel that the Bay
Area is very important and should be represented to the fullest in the mag.
And as some of you may know (or not), Toph Evans, URB Magazine's San
Frandisco columnist, is splitting town and heading to Colorado. So, the
position is empty and the column is blank... Therefore, I welcome any and
all interested parties to submit in writing 1) an 100 word example of what
they would like to see in the column each month, 2) their affiliation with
the scene and 3) why they want the gig.

Also, the usual info:

Name (real name)
Address
Phone No(s).
e-mail address

Send it via fax (213.466.1207), e-mail (troberts@webstorm.com or
urbmag@netcom.com) or snail mail (1680 N. Vine St. #1012, LA CA 90028). And
please, NO PHONE CALLS. Thanks in advance for your response.

Dave-

This whole lounge thread is great...I think you started it didn't you?

There was a vague reference to Black Diamond in your first post and I just
wanted to let people know that if they like diversity (music, vibe, etc) they
should check this place out.

>> The way I see it, lounge ain't rave, dave, it's wave

Black Diamond is very much lounge (it's actually at a place called the
Oddball Lounge). No lasers, No fast pounding mind twisting
trance/techno/house. Not what most people would call a rave. But...

Big sound for a small space (Wicked sound system?) Great *diverse* group of
people, good vibe the couple of times i've been. No attitude detected. Good
beer selection with NO observed idiot drunks:)...

and the music... This is what actually draws me to this little gathering.
Very nice slower dub/triphop/??? but *heavily* techno influenced. Many of the
same elements that attract me to trance/ambient. This stuff definetely pulls
me to the dance floor and it's a nice change from the old standard
party/club. 

Anyway my 2cents. I just had a good time and thought with the lounge thread
and all it would be worth sharing. I would be interested in any other
thoughts on the atmosphere/music at Black Diamond (I know Ann posted
something a while back)

peace, 
martin

ps I kind of went back an forth between 8th House and Black Diamond last
night  and maybe the contrast/similarities got me really thinking...It was
just so interesting to go from Phillips set (Theta-blip) to who ever it was
at BD. Both equally danceable IMHO...

I could be mistaken, but I think the original post was a hoax/joke? It's just

i don't wanna sound TOO critical, but regarding affecting the
  nightly news by gazing into a tv screen, i'm sure most peeple
    realize that NO nightly news is actually live; it's all tape-delayed.
does this mean yer gaze is transcending the space-time continuum, and
  if so, how does it know where to go, if the tape was shipped across
    the continent from the studio to the broadcast facility???

just a chaotic question

Honestly, I'm too shy to dance around naked in front of an MTV crew, 
knowing that a bunch of horny meister brau drinking teenagers will be 
jerking off as they watch mtv.

I talked to Larry Harvey, founder of Burning Man, about the whole issue 
of media at Burning Man, and he told me that they all media crews must 
go be oked and go through a training session which educates them about 
the event and shows them how important it is to not interfere with the 
experience.  He loved the t-shirt idea "MTV sucks... We swallow"!  He 
agreed that seeing the media as a tool to get our messages out is a 
great way to look at the whole thing. MTV HAS NOT CONTACTED HIM TO GET 
HIS APPROVAL AS OF THIS DATE, HE SAYS THAT IF MTV IS GOING TO TRY AND 
BARGE IN WITHOUT GETTING HIS APPROVAL, THEY WILL BE IN FOR A BIG 
SURPRISE. HE WOULD LIKE TO TALK WITH THEM IF ANYONE HAS CONTACT WITH 
MTV.

He suggested having a media camp which could have some funny things 
like suggesting to people that instead of watching Burning Man they 
should just watch reruns they have playing at the Media Camp, or having 
two computers separated by a partition and tell people to communicate 
with each other on line... to get people to take a look at how what we 
consider to be so technologically advanced has actually taken us a 
giant step backwards in many ways.  If anyone would like to help with 
creating Media Camp, they can talk to Larry at the Pre Burning Man 
event called:

Also, I have an idea to start an area which would be completely media

helping with that idea can call me, Amy, at 415-771-3824.

I am really looking forward to seeing everyone at Burning Man!! It's

I am not a luddite by any maens.  Old fashioned in some cases but not a 
luddite.  I really see no need for things to be "exposed" the way they 
are in media today.  Reminds me of the "documentaries" put on by National 
Geographic and the like.  Just another excuse for them to photograph and 
show non-white breasts in magazines and television (when was the last 
time they did a "doc" on German sunbathers....).

Point is, not everything needs exposure, and certainly, not everything 
needs to be explained.  Some things should be left to the experience 
alone.  Not everything need quantification.  MTV is a commercial vehicle, 
hell-bent on profits.  They are no different than any large polluting 
resource conglomerate (read oil), taking, taking, taking, and in return 
charging you money to kill yourself and environs.  The only real 
difference is the medium.  Let's face it,  MTV pollutes the airwaves with 
mindless, yet sometimes entertaining drivel.  Using them to get a message 
across is like using Pete Wilson's brain to further realtions between 
the  U.S. and Mexico.  All you'll end up getting is dumped on.

This will be my first Burning Man experience, and I plan on having not 
only a good time, but a soulful one as well.  I would hato have my trip 
invaded by a bunch of media peddlers, who specialize in selling cheap wares.

Some things should be left sacred, some things should never be exposed to 
the light and scrutiny of day.  Some things are solemn, and should remain 
so.  Don't sleep with the enemy, or you'll awake in anger.

Don't beleive the MTV as illuminary messenger hype.  They suck and should 
not be allowed to have any recording equipment there.

Oh yeah, did I mention anything about that political sleazebag Pete 
"Double Affrimative A-Hole" Wilson.....


Slammin' beats,
John

This too will be my first time at Burning Man and I think it will be the 
experience of a lifetime.  I want to capture alot of it on film with a 
camcorder.  From those who have gone before, would it be a faux pas to 
take my video camera to Burning Man?  I don't want to have anybody mad 
at me! :)

love,
Amy

Wisdom implies happiness?!!??!?  Yes, that is QUITE  a misconception.  If 
anything it sometimes does the opposite for me. I remember coming out of 
my Political Science classes and geography/geology classes feeling 
like I was going to puke because of what I had learned.  Sometimes 
ignorance IS bliss.

As Dan Millman said in The Way of the Peaceful Warrior: "You must loose

kinda halfta agree - the best exposure is being drawn to it, compellingly
like a magnet, to a scene you always felt and imagined, and when you got
there and found, it was not to your surprise, but felt like something
inevitable.  wheres the romance of being turned onto rave culture from
mtv ?  look how commercialization and mass exposure sucked the life outta
seattle and kurt cobain.  it took a matter of weeks for media to turn
an underground culture into a paris fashion fad.  as gibson said 
'commercialization has become so sophisticated that its no longer to
do that bohemian thing'.

fuck mtv.

This isn't my FIRST burning man,  but I tend to agree with John about
"commercial media".   They always tend to alter the context of the story
to meet their commercial (and money greed needs).

	Hello,
	
	I'm planning on showing up at Sunset on Sunday - the recent
	talk on the list has made it irresistable, and as I'll be 
	meeting up with a visitor to the area, hopefully it'll be
	a chance for him to see the best of the SF scene.

	Last week, it seemed as if some people had an inkiling of 
	the location before the actual event - if anyone does know 
	, or at least has a rough idea of, where the event will be 
	taking place, it would be a great help.

	If not, could someone be as kind as to forward a phone 
	number I can use to get the location on Sunday ?

	Thanks, 
	Gary

Personally I have NO problem with individuals documenting the event.  I do
have a problem when that individual is sponsored by Bud, Snickers/Marrs, or
Slim Jim.

That's all I got to say about it.  Amy, do your do.  MTV however is an
entirely different question.  You don't treat somebody who has
mega-resources & access, the same as you would treat one who has limited
resources & access.

MTV's history however dictates it can never tell the truth.  Its just
another vehicle for someones agenda.

Out & Peace,
John

So is that to say we should not express our opinions since they have made

Erh...uh...BOLLOCKS!!!  As for Herbal E, they should try

Hello everyone,
just dropping a quick note to say that I'll be out and about tonight, dressed
up in my little red devil horns, so I should be easy to spot, and I'd love to 
meet more sfravers.  Don't mean to blatantly promote my existence; I ujust                     
thought that if you knew that Mephistopheles was an sfraver, you'd be more
inclined to introduce yourselves.... >;)

Amy,

I sometimes also think that ignorance is bliss but I wouldnt say that 
what you learned in school is wisdom.  Far from it.  It is more like 
intelligence or information.  Facts and concepts.  

Wisdom is what you learn at a rave.  What you learn about your self and 
the universe that really can't be explaned in words and most definetely 
couldn't be proved by science.  Inner peace may be complete wisdom.

According to the powers that be, there has been no talk of big media
exposure at the BM festival. On the other hand, Larry Harvey and Crimson
Rose will be on the Alex Bennett show Mon AM from about 8:00 - 9:00 talking
about the festival and the show at SOMAR. I think that's about all the
media they want, maybe even more than they want, but Alex has talked about
it way too much already, so it will probably be better to get real
information straight from the promoter(s). Remember, this started as a
small gathering for less than 100 people, and has grown to monster
proportions, but the feeling of building a community for a week is/was the
plan, and needs to be preserved. This is not a spectator event (much like a
rave) it's all about living together for a week (or however long you stay),
as a family.

See ya there,

Hey, I'm moving to SF this fall so like it or not, get use to me.  I hope to be
contributing a lot to the dance scene out there (I attend SJSU for two years).

I stand my ground firmly, I'm not about drugs or hanging out doing foul shit
like most people do at raves I've attended.  I'm about making good dance vibes
and other positive things to give props where I came from. Those who don't like
it...tough...

I showcased the end of music but was upstaged by a Dj once known as DJ 
Bryce (among other things) who issued an ultimatum that it was to be his last 
DJ gig. 

Other anecdote from Joe's Birthday: I asked someone what nerd was DJing 
and we didn't know so I went and looked. And it was Monte. We then 
wondered if he was a nerd or one of Joe's cool friends.

Well I just wanted to post a problem I had.  Last night I attended
raindance after driving 1.5 hours from S.F. I couldn't have asked for a
better location!!
It was absolutly beautifull. My G.F. and I danced and then crashed in the
woods. Since this was her first rave exeriance I was very excited about how
well it was going......Then we walked to out car at about 6:30 Sunday
morning and someone had smashed/torn her side mirror off her car. What a
dissapointment! I couldn't believe that at a small event with no one except
ravers for miles around that someone had caused this destruction. We didn't
piss anyone off or anything. This really sucks and needless to say she is
pretty dissapointed.

I know that this didn't have anything to do with the party or 99% of the
people attending, it just really upset me especially considering the crowd.

Are you sure that the car next to you didn't accidentally swipe your
mirror while backing out?

a friend of mine worships richard james and happens to be leaving for 
dallas monday so he's going to miss the aphex twin (bjork) show.
his girlfriend warned me not to mention it in front of him because his 
dream has always been to win the lottery (i missed the 50+
 mil cuz i was in dallas but dammit i know i was destined to win it) and 
pay for richard james to fly out from england to plat at a huge party.
but, alas, he'll miss his easiest opportunity to see him in his hometown.
so does anyone know if aphex twin will play anywhere else in the bay area 
or when the next bjork/aphex twin show is?
also, does anyone have tix for sale for me and carlos (whose acct this is 
- you know good ol' carlos with that damn glowing yo-yo of his)?
if not, we'll be begging at the door of the warfield on tues (dont tell mike)

 Hi folks -

 I was just looking through the latest issue of XLR8R , and I have
a question about terminology. 

 what is the difference between "jungle" and "drum and bass" ?

 ( I have other terminology questions , but I don't want to start
   any extra-long threads! )

drove out to freq 8 on friday night, and the map point was the small surf
shop right in Stinson.  the party was on Stinson beach, up about a half mile
back towards the city - pretty secluded, and the party was just really
starting to get off, a bon fire was lit was starting to roar and people
were crowding and dancing around it. a local from 'Bo' dragged me up
the rock above and we were dancing away high above the party.  

then, 3 cops showed up, and busted the thing up, claiming that someone 
had called in. highly unlikely considering how remote the site was.

more likely - they just did not want to have a party going
off and the corresponding liability. a bigger liability was the couple of
hundred who then had to then drive home in their current state.  cops suck ! 
they could not be reasoned with, instead saying, go up to a spot a half mile
further up the beach. a fine time to say that. the sight of people 
lugging equipment up a trail and over rocks at 3:00am with only a few 
flashlights was quite disheartening.

alas :(

Dear Sunset;

	It's truely ashame that the wonderful people of Sunset chose to
make it impossible for people who depend on public transist to get to
their events, by having them in areas that are totally inaccessable,
unless you have a car. Since I became vehicleless it's almost always a
problem if not an ordeal to try and find transportation to events, not
just Sunset. It often makes me feel like a beggar, or better yet a 
prostitute. 

	But Sunset, being a day time event, that has demostrated
responsibility to the authorites, still choses to limit there events to
locations inaccesable to public transist, when there are places available
that are accessable to public transit, eg Berkley Marina, the Park in El
Cerrito, GC Park, even The Marin Headlands ...etc. I would love to support
this event, as I know others would, if they could get to it. In fact the
only reason why I'm whineing, is that so many people in a similar
situation have said the same thing, and wonder why they continue to pick
the most out of the way, & inaccessable locations.  So Sunset/Pacific why;
inquiring, confused, disappointed, still loyal & dedicated minds want to
know?

Just a short report on the "scene" in Honolulu -

 Since I was just in Honolulu last weekend for a funeral , I was not
able to go out to any clubs or events. I did pick up some flyers , and
visited one clothing/music/spray-can culture store in Honolulu called
Funk Pistol ( located upstairs at 835 Keeaumoku , (808) 949-3103 ).
The gal at the counter told me that the rave scene had died down somewhat
since I was last there in 1993. 

 My last visit to Hawaii was in 1993 , and there had been a free tabloid
then called "DEEP" , somewhat in the same vein as XLR8R . DEEP covered the
local rave , hip-hop , and "Jawaiian" ( reggae & dub with a local Hawaiian
twist ) music scene. When I was back in Honolulu last week , I could find
it anywhere. The gal at Funk Pistol told me that it had folded - the editor
( Alan Thurman ) had moved to San Jose!!! ( Anybody know this guy ? ).
It was a very nice tabloid - too bad it folded.

 Even in Honolulu, there are DRC mix tapes! Funk Pistol had about four
copies of her "EARGAZMICA" tape. Local DJ tapes were represented by
DJ Felix ( who has also moved to CA ! ) and a DJ Pas-Sean . 

 I don't know if it's the same guy , but a DJ Felix C "from San Francisco"
and also our local guy DJ Harry Who will be spinning at a big rave called
"A MidSummer Night's Dream" on Saturday , July 29th. 9PM til' ???
Info number (808) 533-2080 .

 If anybody here on SFRaves finds themselves in Honolulu, I'd definetely
check out the Funk Pistol store.

In a message dated 95-07-20 18:24:36 EDT, you write:

every once in a while things show up, but most of what I've come across is
6/8.

Well, me and a group of about 40 others were still hopeful. At around 
4:30 am, however, word came from the F8 people that it wasn't going to 
happen -- 'twas too late. The rational side of my brain said, ok, they're 
probably right.  The other side said, "Who'ju talkin' 'bout Willis?!"... 
So I go down to tell the relocated partyers down on the beach that it wasn't 
going to happen. They all seemed to be in an late morning mellow funk 
accompanied/induced by the Jim Morrison (Doors) soundtrack playing off the 
boombox of a group of heavy-metalers (?), who were there before any of 
us. Initiative time. Went around to see if anyone had a mixed tape. 
Yes. Asked if my friend would lend her beautiful smile -- yes, but I 
guess she had dealt w/natives b4 because she knew what the best peace
offering would be. And wouldn't ya' know it, our long-haired friends had
their own peace pipe. Popped in my tape. He says: "This isn't rap, is 
it?" ... Well, for the next half an hour a handful of us danced to the 
Wicked boombox, while our new dazed and confused friends moved to 
the rhythm of their hacky-sack -- about 40 yards away.

with current video compression rates (and i DON't mean MPEG)
  MTV can take a whole weekend affair (like burning man) and turn it
    into a 60-second array of soundbite jibberish.  even if someone's
      trip gets compromised by MTV, at least it will only be for a
        fleeting moment... 
and remember how short the average MTV'er'
s attention span is, anyway...

Well, here is a thought: Maybe they think that since so many of us are 
friends, that people without cars could get rides from people with cars. 
Try giving someone a call sometime, it works wonders ;) I would have 
given you a ride if you had called me.....

Monty would like everyone to know that by virtue of the fact that he is not
responding electronically, and indeed, has no internet presence, he is not
a nerd. This does not necessarily mean that he is one of "Joe's cool

Part of the problem is finding locations where the authorities will allow
large groups of people to gather and listen to loud music. The park in
Richmond is one such place. (although they'll only allow it every six
weeks) GG Park costs $400 for a permit which is only valid from 12-6. The
Berkeley marina is touchy this year after the problems of last year and the
Sunsets that have been there this year have been without official
permission and have run the risk of getting stopped. The East Bay Regional
Park District does not, as a rule, allow amplified sound in any of their
parks to the best of my knowledge. It's been difficult for Pacific to find
viable locations this year due to prejudice against raves.

Your best bet in getting your comments to Pacific would be to leave a
message on the voice mail, 415 985-5264. I know they would gladly
investigate any location suggestions you might have.

was there from setup to teardown.

Hey, I'm moving to SF this fall so like it or not, get use to me.  I hope to
be
contributing a lot to the dance scene out there (I attend SJSU for two
years).

I stand my ground firmly, I'm not about drugs or hanging out doing foul shit
like most people do at raves I've attended.  I'm about making good dance
vibes
and other positive things to give props where I came from. Those who don't
like
it...tough...

Wow, this is really nice, I'm quite looking forward to it.   Now I have
something to look forward to, to live for.  My only question/hope is, will
you bring crates of really good house music to foist off on people?

To all SFRavers,

        My two roommates are moving out at the end of August, and I'm going
to be looking for housing.  What I was wondering was if anyone wants to find
a place together in San Francisco or take up the lease at my current
apartment with me.  The place I have right now is only one bedroom, but it's
a really big room. Moving out and getting another place wouldn't be a
problem, either, so if one or two of you were looking to get a place in SF
maybe we could talk.  I figured I'd try this before going through other
routes because this way I at least know that we share some common interests.
If anyone is interested, please drop me a line at reicja00@dons.ac.usfca.edu.

Hello everyone!!!,
	
	Hats off to the sunset crew for another beautiful sunday!!! 
(Thanks :)

	Well, as some of you may know, Harmony will be having a two year 
anniversary party in August. This post is to explain a bit about what we 
are planning for the night!! 

	On Friday, August 11th Harmony and Beautiful People will be 
gathering to celebrate the two year anniversary of our family!!

	Djs for the night are:

		Graeme		Trent		Dj Dan
	Ethan		James 		Brandon		Galen
				    (solid Grooves)
	
	Plus a live performance by solid Grooves recording artist:
				E.B.E. Audio

	Visuals by Michael Clay 	Lasers by Hollywood Dog

	Chill Area by the Crew (Harmony)

	Plus a whole lot of surprises!!! :)       $10    :)

Call the following numbers for more info: (408)486-9591 (408)450-3044

	This party will be 100% outdoors on a new, (never before used,) 
comfirmed, beautiful, private ranch. (By comfirmed I mean, not a 
break-in... LEGAL!!!) Actually the location is sooo bad ass, that we are 
basically giving the owners half of the door money!!! ( $5 a head!) 
Outragous?, well not for this space!!! It is perfect for our two year 
party!!!! The location is in the south bay, (San Jose side of highway 
17,) and it is a couple miles off the 680 freeway, (easy to get to!!)
	
	The party will be $10 and go from about 9pm., until 7-8am (maybe 
even later if the crowd supports it!) Feel free to bring anything you 
want, such as: Candy, toys, lights, and even tents! There will be plenty 
of room for them. But most of all bring every single little drop of 
energy you have, cause we want you to use it all!!!! Also our entrance 
policy is still in effect: You must have a smile on your face to enter 
the party, if you friends don't have one, give them one of yours!!!

	There will be plenty of free water (and fruit in the morning!) 
So feel free to eat up! 

	Also, if you are not on our snail mail list, and want to be, you 
can either call us at the phone lines, or mail me your info at 
ascend@netcom.com  If you have not been introduced to our mailing list I 
highly recommend it. We promote smaller parties in our mailer that we 
don't publiclly announce!!! Plus you'll be surprised at the energy 
that we put into everysingle mailer!!! 

	Well, that's all for now, and we all hope to see you there!!!

Peace, love and harmony to all beautiful people,

Greg

Ps. the phone #'s are (408)486.9591  + (408)450.3044

There seems to be a situation where people are unable to reach events 
they'd like to attend because it's beyond their reach.

There also seems to be a situation where the people who throw these 
events are sometimes left standing to do trash detail and other such 
bunk things that they could do without.   

Maybe if by agreeing upon a MUNI drop point and time to convoy to these 
events, both of these problems could be solved.

Just a thought.

from what i understand (and i am no junglist...just spent a lot of time in
chicago... so correct me if i am wrong), drum and bass is a type of jungle.
there is also dark jungle (that scary sounding stuff), intelligent jungle
(my personal fave, dj wickett from madison, WI who i am sure very few if
any of you have ever heard of spins some really great intelligent jungle.)
anyway, you get the idea i am sure:)

Hello everybody!!!
While I was at Funky Tekno in Sac last Friday, it kept bugging me 
throughout the night that many of you wonderful people were probably 
there, but I had no way to find you!!!

Then I came up with this idea: Why don't we have stickers printed up?
A sticker is small enough not to infringe on anyone's attire.
A sticker matches anything.
A sticker can be worn anywhere.
And hey-- a sticker can even be Funky! :)

So, here's my idea. To save bandwidth, anyone who is interested in 
participating in this project please mail me your ideas on what the sticker 
should look like. (Shapes? Colors? Pictures? Words? etc)

I figure that it would cost no more than $2 per sheet of stickers.
And, even better, we could take the leftover proceeds and donate them 
to a charitable organization in the bay area.

Anyone like this idea? 

Smiles~!!!   		          lv, Alex

Right on!!
Every once in a while there is a post on here that says it loud and clear.

Pigeon holes are a form of fear. People fear what they don't know and 
haven't experienced. Your post definitely made me think twice and realize 
how cloistered my "definition of rave" has become!!!
            Way to go! :) :) :)

a button of some type may be a better idea :)  that way, you can
'pin' it to whatever you're wearing, ~and~ use as a carte blanche to
get into clubs, raves, restaurants, etc :)  

i think it's a great idea !

You might have seen the article in the East Bay Express about Your Momma's
House cafe'. The place has a cool little concept, probably not absolutely
original, but it's the only execution I know of in the East Bay. DJ's come
in and spin while people lounge around reading, chatting, writing, doing
homework, whatever. They're down at the end of College Ave where it meets
Broadway, in Oakland. It's close to the California College of Arts and
Crafts and a big ole Safeway. Right next door to the Deep Threadz hip-hop
clothing store.

Merit, who runs the place, is trying to broaden the musical styles and so
I've been hooked up with the 11-1 Saturday evening shift with the express
mission of playing house music. There's also supposed to be another DJ
coming online next weekend, for another 2 hour house style set ahead of
me. Most of the other DJ sets I believe are hip-hop although I should check
that out.

If you're casting about for a place to chill out a little before going to
the map point, a place to meet some friends and shoot the breeze, or just
some coffee and munchies before hitting the club check us out.

Here's some of the set I played this past Saturday in case you're really
not into happy house carp (sic). I'm devising a really tweaky, retro acid
house set for this weekend.

The Black Science Orchestra		"New Jersey Deep"
The Bucketheads				"Tribal Rydims"
DJ Sneak				"Show Me The Way"
The Bucketheads 3			"Come and be Gone"
DJ Sneak				"Disco Erotica"
Roach Motel				"Work 2 Doo"
Morel's Grooves 8			"Officer Where's Your Brother"
Full Swing				"Freestyle Groove"
Matt Wood				"What Am I Gonna Do With You"
Houz' Neegroz				"How Do U Luv a Black Woman?"
Club Swing				"Survive"
Jump Cutz V1				"A Special Disco Re-Edit"
The Mole People				"Break Night"
Mark the 909 King			"Can You Dig It!"
Wink					"Higher State of Consciousness"
W.A.M					"The Drum"
Brian Transeau				"The Moment of Truth"
Kim English				"Time for Love"
Joi Cardwell				"Trouble"
Ruffneck				"Everybody Be Somebody"
Hustler's Convention			"The Chant"
MFSB					"Theme from Soul Train '94"
River Ocean				"Love and Happiness"
Glenn Underground			"Somebody Scream"
7th Movement				"Odyssey"
Disco Elements V3			"Feel the Body Heat"
Mr. Lee					"Pump That Body"

All I get from reading this is negative vibes...  if you hate all of the,
"foul shit" that ravers do then please stay away.  I mean we would all be
happy to have you but not ifyou are gonna come to just look down on us while
you bless us with your, "pure 'n possitive" persona.  Isn't there some quote
about casting stones or something that would be apropriate here? =o)

hey alexandra -

there is an sfraves badge available through the 'net apparently, but no one
ever wears them!

Here on nw-raves I'm the Badge Lady, and we wear our badges everywhere -
they're free (I make 'em up and mail 'em out) and they're pin-on or can be
worn as a pendant.

Stickers are a cool idea but they tend to become un-stuck after a night of
sweating .....

just a thought!

;)

well drum&bass and 'intelligent jungle' are basically 
the same. 'jungle' describes the ragga-influenced stuff, lots of   
ragga mc's, "bloodclot!", "booyaka booyaka",  that 
sort of thing. see M Beat and General Levy's "Incredible" (for an albiet 
commercial jungle choon). the drum&bass is best typified by artists like 
Omni Trio, A Guy Called Gerald and LTJ Bukem. it's also becoming known 
as 'drum & space' these days...

My god, you guys have to deal with THIS??  On _our_ list, we just have an
argument about the difference between abstinance and not getting any.

Zheam, if you're the same one who hangs out on Vrave, prepare for some
serious squelching.  The whole point of the rave scene is NOT whether or
not you do drugs or whatever ... it's about PEOPLE, VIBE, and UNITY.  If
you have decided that drugs don't fit your lifestyle, that's your business.
If, however, you feel it's your duty to insult other people whose
lifestyle choice includes drugs, you're in for a long, hard, lonely road
through university.

I too make music.  But I don't attempt to FORCE it on anyone through the
net.  I prefer to just play it whenever I get the chance.  It's a far more
effective way of marketing yourself than saying "HEY!  I MAKE GOOD MUSIC!
SO LISTEN TO IT!"

Good dance vibes come from the feel and soul of the artist.  From what I've
read from you so far, your music would be awful uptight, overperfected, and
soulless.

Well, I just wanted to say a few words about the first SF
party I've been to (not counting one I went to two years
ago).  It was wonderful!

The vibe at friends and family last weekend was so relaxed
and comfortable..  I hope this is an indication of good
things to come. :) Still, it was a bit of a change for me,
since it's been awhile since I've been to a party in a new
city..  I'm used to knowing a good portion (50ish) of the
people at any given party.. it's going to take some getting
used to, I guess, but I'm looking forward to it. :)

If raves are about people vibe and unity, isn't it the raver's job to
take care of those that are overindulging? Where do you draw the line
between the "anything goes" attitude expected by this community and the
care that a community should have for it's members?

I believe there's a difference between use and abuse -- a fine line
really. Perhaps Zheam has some experience w/ the aftermath of abuse and
that is the cause of his attitude-laden "if you don't like it ...
tough" posting.  Even if attitude is "unhip" it probably shouldn't be
condemned until you learn the full story -- don't judge a man until
you've walked a mile in his shoes and all that.

I've known too many casualties from people I knew in college -- 2
tweak-depression inspired suicides, a few of coke/acid phreakouts that
are nothing more than hollow shells of their former
hyperintelligent/creative selves, pathologically dysfunctional X-heads,
etc. It's pretty scary really.

I myself am in somewhat of a conundrum because I have a friend that
I've known for a long time that seems to be getting into tweaking at a
dangerous level (using Xtal-M to stay up for weeks at a time). I'm
pretty scared about this, and I'm trying to figure out a way to bring
up the subject in a non-alienating fashion. Any suggesions on how to
approach this topic w/o getting in his face in a rude and
non-productive way? After all, It's really none of my business telling
people what to do or think...

I guess I could buy him a copy of David Crosby's "So Far" autobiography
which goes into excruciating detail on the liver and immune system
damage he sustained while tweaking (remember that he recently got a
Grateful-Dead funded liver transplant). Albeit, his tweaking was of a
more expensive variety than my friend's, it's tweaking nonetheless.

Thanks,
	Niels.

Niels,
You bring up some good points in your post.  As far as your friend is 
concerned that's a tuff one.  Alot of drug abusers are often in denial 
about it.  Those that care for the person are left with alot of feelings 
of frustration and helplessness, as it is very difficult to help anyone 
unless they are open to it.  Am I cheering you up yet? (sorry, bad joke)

This is what I would do if I was in your shoes.  I would let your friend 
know that you were concerned, and share your observations that cause your 
concern.  I would also let them know that it is up to them, what they 
want to do with their lives, and to let them know that you are available 
for them if they want help.
If you get to the point, where they are willing to acknowledge that they 
have a problem, and are willing to except some help, then I'd be willing 
to give you some more suggestions based on the situation.
If he doesn't want to except the help, there isn't alot you can do, 
except let him know you care.  Sometimes people have to "hit bottom" 
before they will except help.  Letting someone know you care can 
sometimes open one up, as alot of the time their main relationship is 
with their drug as they are feeling quite isolated and cut off.  To 
releive the disconnectedness they turn to connect with the drug 
experience.  Unfortunately with a drug abuser the drug experience often 
causes more disconnectedness, and the vicious cycle continues, connecting 
in one way then disconnecting in a bigger way.  Your expression of caring 
can possible help them start to reconnect or feel a little more 
connected, reducing the need for the drug.  This is based on 
psychological addition.  If its physical addition, he could probably use 
some medical help.
Hope some of this is helpful.  Either way you got my empathy.

peter

You are right, there IS a line between use and abuse.  That's not the point
I was trying to make.  My point was that people shouldn't INSULT others for
their choices.

Of course, if someone's being an abuser, I do what I can to help, or find
out why they're getting into it so hard.  Most of the time if someone's
using drugs to the point where they HAVE TO HAVE THEM to have fun, there's
a deeper psychological reason underlying it....

I have drugs in my life as a choice.  I respect their dangers and monitor
myself carefully.  I don't NEED them to have a good time, but I like to
have them as a treat, as some ppl use alcohol or nicotine.  If someone just
calls me an idiot and weak willed and a junkie, it gets me angry, and I
think it's justified.

I believe the quote you are refferring to is "Let he who is without sin, cast
the first stone."  Don't ask for the biblical reference because that is all I
remember from religion class (I am a recovering Catholic :-)).  It is one of
the few sayings that I truely believe applies in this age.  There is so much
cynacism (sp?) going on; everyone I think needs to lighten up a little (comment
not directed at sfravers, just the world in general).

The quote I believe that is more appropriate is from Marcel Proust.  It goes
like this:  "The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeing new landscapes
but in having new eyes."  Don't expect to come to SF and have a good time
just because you changed the scenery.  Change your attitude and you will
enjoy yourself whereever you are.

As to Sindar's comments, I wholeheartedly agree here.  Even though I personally
don't get into (and I quote) "doing foul shit like most people do", I deeply
believe in the right of everyone to enjoy themselves as they see fit.  If that
means dropping some x, acid, whatever, ENJOY!  Just don't expect me to do it.

The point is about community and togetherness and positive-energy not
holier-than-thou attitudes.  If you want attitude, just go to some of the $25
cover/$15 per drink clubs in SF (there is more than enough attitude to go
around).  But if you want to enjoy the SF scene, leave you attitude behind
and chill.  You might actually enjoy yourself and meet some really awsome
people.

I agree with the latter statement, Niels, until it comes to our friends.
Then I suggest that an "in your face, it IS MY business" approach is
what's called for. Sometimes u gotta seem like an asshole to your friends to 
let them know the friendship is important...something like "tough love" 
I guess...

Hi everybody!

My name is Todd and I'm writing a story for URB Magazine on "speed"
(amphetamines). I would like to invite anyone who has or know someone who
has any experience =8B good or bad =8B=A0with amphetamines to contact me abo=
ut
being interviewed for the story. I can do it via phone, e-mail or in person
so your anonymity is secure if you want it to be. If you want to go on
record, then cool, give me a call (213.993.0291). I'm not looking to
slanderize the scene or the people, but give a good objective view on drug
use and addiction.

I'm on a tight deadline and would like to commence interviews early next
week, so contact me pronto. I think it's a worthwhile topic. Thanks in
advance for your help.

Sounds like time to call in the old skool. The good folks at Al-Anon know
how to deal with loved ones who are killing themselves with alcohol/other
drugs. Call them, they've been down the same road. Or check with Narcotics
Anonymous or Alcoholics Anonymous. (see yer local white pages) I know your
thinking 'AA like that's so unkewl, like omigod I could never' Well get
over it, this aint no game. This is real life...and DEATH.

"Drum & space" . . . HAH, the Grateful Dead have played that at every show
for going on 20 years!  Hmm, the Dead had the Gyuto Monks come out and
chant during drums&space at their last Shoreline shows, maybe we can get
LTJ Bukem to do a breakout when they play Madison Square Garden in the
fall ... nah, nobody would understand ...

Amy,
        Could you send this out to sfraves for me? I don't think mine got
through.

                                                        lots o luv,

Hye guys!
        Ok, first of all I don't even know if this will make it through.
I haven't posted in about a year and I just resubscribed. I'm not a sfraves
steady cause I commute back and forth between L.A. during school (Harvey
Mudd. Go Mudders!) and SF during summer. 
        But I absolutely HAD to subscribe to flap my lips about what a 
great party Frequency 8 threw last night (I don't know if anyone else has
flapped yet so I'll keep the details low).
        After driving over an hour on an incredibly curving road, and then
hiking down the beach for what seemed like a mile, it was absolutely
incredible to see the faint glow of light sticks finally guiding our way
hundreds of yards away as the dull THUD THUD of the music could just be
heard over the crashing of the waves. And then to walk around the rocks into
a cove and have the music hit you hard as the bright green lights
illuminated hundreds of crazy dancers. Absolutely incredible.
        Several things to note: 
        1) the music was wonderful
        2) the location was incredible
        3) the people were amazing (the vibe was great and the organizers
           knew their shit and were incredibly nice too)

        Unfortunately the cops busted it, but even then the cops were 
completely cool about it. Even with the early bust I'd still say it was one
of the best parties I've ever been too. 
        Hi to Jake (yes I told my friend Ami that you tried to find her) and
Reza (remember me? JASON!!! the temporary guru of the evening) and to Purple
Tiger, and hi to all you sfravers that I didn't get to mee this time. Maybe
next time... And a big hello to my wonderful friend Amy Starkey who I
haven't been able to see all summer long. 

Absolutely Incredible!

                                                        lots o luv,

                                                           jason

I dunno. I think the dead's drums and space is a great way to get
"rockers" to open up to other kinds of musics, rhythms, melodies, and
the experimental/improvisational. I wonder how many Olatunji or Mickey
Hart tribal rhythm drumming albums got sold from deadheads that turned
on to those sounds at a show? SO I kinda disagree that "people don't
understand" but maybe the monks were just a bit too much for 'em.

Course space is a real hit n' miss thing at a dead show anyways. I've
heard drumz/space sound at least as good as live electro-funk Miles
Davis, or as bad as some of those japanese noize bands that think that
music is the sound you get from kicking a spring reverb guitar amp
(turned up to 11) all over the stage.

I still find the dead boring nowadays when they play live (IMHO). But I
was really into their shows back when they seemed to be more innovative
and energetic. I still like to throw on my Frost Amphitheater '82 tape
(my first dead show) to hear just how good they used to sound, and that
includes a pretty intersting space. (Never heard the dead play more
up-tempo than that ever again...).

Plans are progressing along, and confirmed DJ's and live acts will be
announced soon, but I wanted to start people thinking now, so plane
tickets and hotels can be reserved for those who respect the Godfather...

Labor Day Weekend, Detroit..."Magic" Juan Atkins - Live!  Also, DJ's
from Detroit (Derrick May, Kevin Saunderson, Eddie Fowlkes, etc) and
some from elsewhere (Dave Clarke, etc).

Main party is Saturday, Sept 2.

More details as I get them...

yeah so I'm at Sunset and having a wonderful time and then I dance and 
dance and fluff about.  Somebody was smart enough to wet down the dirt so 
as to eliminate the dust cloud buildup which commoonly occurs during vibe 
escalation... perhaps no longer as dramatic but very very pleasant to the 
lungs.  

I drove to L.A. saturday morning to go to a wedding and I guess I am so 
addicted to Sunset that I drove back here that night so I could be rested 
and ready for the Richmond dance-o-rama.  Silly, I know, when SoCal has a 
lovely scene supported by wonderful people but this was one of those 
times where reason went out my wide open mouth as I hooted a farewell to 
the sun one more time.

Oh well.

Dear All;

	Emergency brake applied again, god it's the second time this 
week. People kill themselves, or develop emotional disorders, not because 
of drugs, but because they are all ready present/latent, get real. I will 
agree that drugs can bring these emotional disorders out quicker, but 
all in all they will show up eventually if that's what's in your psyci. 
People who tweek, and who stay up longer than 48 hours, don't eat, I'm 
sorry to say deserve what they get, YOU have to take care of yourself, if 
YOu are going to do harder drugs. This intails forcing youself to eat, 
regardless of how dry your mouth is, everyday, at least once a day, or 
whatever your normally used to. If you haven't slept in 48 hours, go tout 
to a drug store, get some benedryl, and take 1 tablet every 2 hours until 
you do sleep, and believe me you will after about 3 = 150mg.

	The human body is suppose to get 8 hours for every 16 its up, 
people who stay up for a week at a time, are asking for all sorts of 
problems, where's the maturity here, if you not mature enough to know you 
need to eat and sleep, you shouldn't be going drugs, be in college, or 
anywhere but attached to a leash, with your parents holding the other end 
of it. People need to take responsability for there actions, and not 
blame it of guns, drugs, and sex. YOU do it to youself, not the drugs, 
not the sex, not the guns, please do GROW THE FUCK UP, THE REST OF THE 
WORLD CAN'T WAIT!!!!!!!!

I'm one who got truned onto the "tribal drumming" thing through the Dead
and from that trancing out to drums (Micky Harts book Drumming at the Edge
of Magic had some influence) and drumming myself.  From that it took 
awhile before I figured out that you could trance out to drum machines
and techno but I finally got that to.  As far as people "not getting it" 
about the monks there, I was really amazed at the wide varity that did 
get it.  Teeny-boppers to frat types to old dreadlocked tourheads seemed 
to get it where I was.  The amazment level was quite high with only a few 
sinckers from those who didn't get it and some giggles from those who got
it all to well and could not supress the joy and amazement they felt.

I too know I create my own reality and all things, good and bad that happen
to me are created by me, for me to experience, learn and grow from.  I feel
this to be true for everyone, including tweakers.  That doesn't mean I don't
have compassion for them.  Many tweakers don't realize they're tweakers til
they're way deep inside tweakerville.  I too have teaked to a certain extent
in my own right.  Your words, especially the ones in all CAPS would not have
helped me.  I am not attacking you, I just feel a little compassion would do
much more good.

Dear All;

	I disagree when someones tries and applies THEIR sense of
compassion, reality, addiction awareness, or anything else for that
matter, on to another human being. Its not about YOU, its about THEM, and
THEIR reality, THEIR needs, THEIR desires, THEIR dreams, what THEY think is
compassionate, what THEY want. When you love someone, its about letting
THEM go and finding whatever, & whomever they want to be, without YOUR
guilt & the shame, even if it's to hell in a hand basket. For all YOU, 
know this person after staying up for a week, may have an experience, 
that changes them in a positive way for the rest of their lives, as a 
result, they may quit drugs, go into research and develop a cure of 
cancer. All this because WE are uncomfortable with THEIR behaviour and 
what THEY feel THEY need to do to get though life at this point, this is 
nothing more than oppression. If WE are uncomfortable, WE need to either 
leave the situation or person, or look at internaly why it's making us 
uncomfortable, but no, WE expect THEM to change for US; HA!!!, and go as 
far as forcing them to change for us, is this LOVE, I think NOT!!!!!!

	It just reminds me of "I know what's best for you", how many of us
have heard that, and hated it. HOw could anyone possibly know what I what
or need, all you can do is guess, unless you ask the person in ?. We used
to do a little excersise in massage school called "I Observe, I image",
observations are whatever the senses are, feelings, seeing, hearing,
..etc. I image is what we do with that data. So an example, you're sitting
on a bus, you see a stranger across from you; You observe that person
rubbing their face, most people will say with absolute certainity hmmm I
image their face itches. But you don't know unless you check it out, and
ask that person what they are doing, it's just YOUR imagenation, for all
you know they could be a secret agent signaling a bombing, or whatever,
you just don't know. 

	I'm sorry, but for me this is the root of oppression, people who 
are uncomfortable with the actions, lifesytles, hobbies ...etc whatever, 
and expect the others to change, for them. LIVE & LET LIVE, is & was an 
AA/NA slogan. All gods(not that I believe in one), have a right to live & 
be, and follow their natural path, whether in be to ruin via drugs, or 
excellence via other paths like education, or natural leadership. I will 
continue to fight for the highest forms of love & freedom, though they 
may never be obtainable, I will try an arroach them as the limit of x of 
f(x) as x approaches infinity.

Brian Darkness

Dear Brian;

	Just for you Brian :), She made the statement "80's Tuff love
Doesn't Work" public at a press conference sometime around the time of his
death. Just for the record, & what's the matter not tuned in, hon :).

Of course, if you really felt this way, you wouldn't spend so much
time applying YOUR sense of reality, etc. on to all the human
beings here on SFRaves.  :)

All I wanted to say is that what I learn from this list is what I've already
learned about SF when I used to live there back in '88 and that most of the
Cali people aren't true to the rave scene.  I've been visiting the Bay area
ever since I moved away and been there as recent as Spring Break and nothing
changed....:(

The fact that people can support a post about a $25 rave and then try to
chatise an independent artist who is offering thier mix tapes or a 12" for a
fraction of a rave tickets is proof that some of you people ain't real. Don't
tell about BSP are out to get a profit.  Can't no promotor or a pagan
moon-worshipping gathering offer the rave scene more than what the DJs  or
beatmaker contributes to the dance scene. That's why in the areas that are
real like the east coast, you hear of the Josh Winks, The Derrick Carters,
The Basement Boys, Frankies Knuckles and NOT the so-and-so event, or
production/promotion company. I will support any 12" artist or DJ in a minute
before I pay $10 or more for a one-night party...that what seperates me from
most of you people out there posting negative shit about me.....

PS:Don't worry, I doubt it very much if I do want to hang out with most of
you anyway and some of you like meclay, I swear on my religion that if you
said that shit in my face, it will be the last thing you fucking regret...

Well, folks, this is just exactly the type of fun-loving free-spirited 
happy-go-lucky person I want to have children with!!  Jesus Christ, 
Zheam, what the hell crawled up your ass and died?  I'm very new to 
sfraves, and I've not responded to anything I've read so far, but I 
feel I've just got to open my mouth on this one!  Most of the people 
whose postings I've read seem like really cool people.  I have to thank 
you all for being such a friendly community together, it's made me feel 
comfortable posting so quickly after subscribing.  And Zheam, I have to 
thank you for the same thing!  You've come across as such an asshole so 
far that I feel completely comfortable in responding to your little bad 
attitude trips, death-threats, & insults to our community here at S.F!  
Hats off to you brother, you've made quick work of your own musical 
death here...

Hi all,

I haven't received any sfraves mail since noon yesterday, and I can't 
quite believe it's been *that* quiet. Is it hyperreal or is it my service 
provider?

Is anybody out there?

:)

Okay, folks, like when you pass a big accident on the freeway, let's not 
stop and gawk or we'll only cause more trouble.  Ignore it.  It's not 
worth our time and collective angst.

In a previous post I said something like "don't judge a man till you've
walked a mile in his shoes" w/r/t Zheam ibn Ismail's pontifications
about drugs and "shit" that people at raves do .... Well, his last post
forced us to walk a mile in his shoes, and all that happened is shit
all over our feet.

What's with the attitude dude? Hie thee hence, removeth that corncob
from thine bungholio, and get thee to a ravery. Pronto that is.

Also, from a marketing perspective, you have failed utterly to make me
want to buy your record. I was actually completely on the fence w/r/t
you and your "BSP" until your last post... If you believe in the great
con of sales, you must repeat to yourself "the customer is always
right" like a mantra, till you turn blue....

Finally, If you want to be left alone, quit attaching a kick-me sign to
your back when you post. It's really not that unfathomable a concept.

	Love and Kisses,
		Niels.

It bears saying again, Zheam.  sfraves is interested in what you *do* as
well as what you say.  Show us you're not frontin' and we'll show you the
respect you're demanding.  You got to walk it like you talk it, my friend.

Need I say anymore?

Can't take the heat then get yer ass out the kitchen...  if you remember you
came talkin shit and so you should be man enough to deal with the reaction.
 Please spare me from any more well I do this n that...  I do music as well
and will agree with you that we get little or no respect for what we do but
the DJs and promoters who are killing the scene get all the props so I have
no problem with you there...  it's just your origianal post was a straight up
dis to all the people gong to raves...  blanket negative judgements will only
reflect back on you...  

but in the interest of proving you wrong about all the fucked up things most
people at raves are I offer you the same thing that I offer anyone on this
list I have ever gotten in an argument with...  come and meet me and we can
talk about it in person...  since you and I both do music Im sure we would
have some common interests.  I would be happy to share some of my music if
you were willing to do the same...  see not all Ravers are foul.

See ya

To be fair, the rangers said the complaint was relayed to them by the
sherrif's office.  No doubt the sherrif noticed the unusual increase of
parked cars on a Friday night and followed some ravers over to the beach.
The sherrif probably fibbed about the noise complaint.   The rangers
asked F8 to shut down for "playing amplified music without a permit."
They also suggested, somewhat discretely, that the party move up the
coast out of their and the sherrifs jurisdiction.   All and all, they were
rather nice about the whole affair, considering there were glass beer
bottles strewn all over the beach and intoxicated youths.

At least I got to hear MysterE's set.

Subject: MTV Special--Herbal E

Does anyone know who is doing the MTV look into raves and herbal ecstasy. I
have been constantly tormented by the herbal ecstasy people, who have offered
me money to endorse their shoddy product.  They have ripped off my logo fonts
from my book, put my on a GoDigal CD ROM Magizine study into rave scene and
took clips from a three hour video interview they did with me and inter-
spaced it with a blissed out surfer visiting a rave and taking herbal
ecstasy. Also, at a Megatripolis event (before I learned the truths of
Megatropolis first hand) in which I lectured, they advertised that I would be
there selling herbal ecstasy. I'd like to talk to MTV as author of the book
Ecstay: The MDMA Story with my regard to this noxious stuff A lot of kids are
being ripped off because of this stuff..

can't  talk long, I'm on long distance...

I'll I gots to say is that I have hung out with ravers of all levels in 
the sfrave community.  IE thir drug involvement, music tastes, etc.

The key to excptance from anyone is "being your true self". I am sorry Zheam 
has said what he has said about us. Idunno where he is coming from but I 
forgive him.  That is the coolest thing we can do.
forgive. that makes us stronger than just bullshitting him back.

Yo Zheam just be yourself man.  When people do stuff like give you shit 
for promotimg your record. Forgive them too..

The majority of people that I know that have unsubscibed from this list 
have done so because of the level<excuse the expression> of bullshit.

For evey one message that supposidly shouldn't be here on the list like 
self promotional stuff, there are 5 or 6 that are in response to that letter,
just more bandwidth...

If you want to maintain that level of consciousness that w"E", many of us  
have experienced frogiveness is a major key.

peace out
dan :)

You might just want to take a deep breath and look at what you just 
said.  "blah blah people in sf not being true to the rave scene" then see 
above.  I might mention that meclay is one of the most sincere people in 
the sfrave scene.  I'm not dissin on you but maybe you need to try and be 
a little more open when you come out here.  I add one letterto plur, that 
letter is a

and I make it 
peace
love 
unity
respect
acceptance

think about those before you come out to sf...it would make things a lot 
nicer for everyone.

sheesh man, has it not gotten through your fucking head yet? the reason 
why a post about a $25 rave *is* supported and your BSP isn't is 
because your post is OFF TOPIC. do you understand that? that means that 
what you posted HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH SAN FRANCISCO RAVES. It's not 
that some of us find (well, found, because i'm sure noone gives a shit 
about you now, with that last post) your post irrelevant to the scene 
as a whole but it's NOT APPROPRIATE TO POST IT HERE. you seem to have 
no clue about something we call 'netiquette' which are your basic 
Internet manners - one of those rules of netiquette is that when you 
post to subject-specific mailing lists, you keep on the topic of those 
lists, otherwise, the penalty for not doing that is that people get on 
your back and bitch at you and such.  This whole argument isn't about 
DJ vs Promotor or this vs that - it's about you not following the 
(really, really basic) rules. And being an asshole about it.

I've been working on a 3-d rendered, interactive DJ setup for the Mac,
and I've got a beta version up on the web for people to download and
play around with.  

It simulates a scene with two turntables and a mixer, and most of the
controls are functional, so you can crossfade, change speeds, adjust
the pitch, backspin, etc.  Again, it's for the Mac only, and please
let me know if you have any problems downloading it, running it, or 
if you notice bugs.

It's a binhex file located in the demos page hanging off my company's
web page:  Go to http://www.crl.com/~tactile, the click on the "Demos"
header next to the turntable.  This will go to the demos page which has
a link to download the file.

Mr. Almighty Zheam,

GET A LIFE! The San Francisco Rave Scene repeatedly continues to impress anyone 
who is new to it, or anyone who has visited it, because of one main reason. And 
thats the VIBE!

The spirit of all these folks on SFR and beyond is so great, it's positively 
ecstatic ( no drugs needed! ). Everyone who has ever visited here from the 
midwest.east coast says that, although there are good things about those 
'scenes', they still wish the people were as friendly and nice as out here. It;s
rreally really sad to see that you dont appreciate that, and that without even 
trying youre putting up this huge attitude!

By your own actions youre saying you wont fit in. I think thats fine with us. To
quote a friend, " We dont need any more bad-vibers anyways ". Think about it 
dude.

Regards, 

Sy

I disagree.  Although talk like this is threatening to what we beleive
this list should be about, the minute we isolate ourselves from such talk
we compromise those beleifs ourselves.  There are people who take
similar forms as the above at almost every party we go to, but it
would be wrong to tell those people that they have no right to be
there because they don't "share the spirit."  The presence of these
vindictive and mean spirited words challenge our faith in the
meaning of raving, and inspire us to grow large enough where
we can find a way to coexist peacefully with Zheam.  It is only
when we can understand his anger and accept him that we
ourselves will find our peace.
We have to give in order to get, and kicking people off the list
isn't giving.

What exactly is _Zheam_ giving _us_?

But this is true - kicking people off the list is not necessarily the
answer.  I think it's far better to just leave it alone and allow him to
yell at himself for a while.  This will be my last post regarding this
issue, as it's obvious that HE'S not changing his mind, and we're not
changing OUR minds, so this argument is going to go on and on.  Either the
whole thing will fade by itself or he'll decide this list isn't for him
after all.

Okay kiddies, I went and had a look at the sfraves badge
(http://hyperreal.com/raves/sf/archive, I think) and I see a big problem
right away - they're in full colour.  Very nice looking, but how can
someone who only has a black and white dot matrix printer make one up for
themselves?

Our badge is a simple black and white graphic which we copy onto brightly
coloured card stock, stick a wacky back on them and laminate.  Some of you
saw mine when I was there...

I think you might find it easier to have badges if you make them more
accessible to technologically challenged folk! :)

just a suggestion

That was no threat to "what we beleive this list should be about" it was
direct personal threat put in the harshest possible language.

Any person that threatened someone at a party I helped throw would
instantly be removed from the premises, not because they didn't "share the
spirit" but because they posed a demnstrable threat to the safety of the
other people at the party.

Are you suggesting that the world (or this forum) should simply tolerate
the active manifestation of evil while we all struggle towards
enlightenment? Given that this might take a while ;) I think not.

Let me refresh your memory. zheam said:

"...and some of you like meclay, I swear on my religion that if you said
that shit in my face, it will be the last thing you fucking regret..."

This is specific threat aimed both at an individual and at other
unspecified members of this group. Allowing him access to this group only
allows him access (email addresses, hence finger, hence whois, etc.) to
people he has suggested he would committ violence towards.

To do this is insane, beyond which I would suggest that defending these
abhorrent actions on first amendment or "meaning of raving" grounds serves
only to distort these all too important ideals. Free speach should be
protected and the "spirit of raving" and more generally of peaceful caring
coexistence should definitely be fostered, but none of this has *anything*
to do with protecting individuals from demonstrable threats to their
physical well being, ie, from what I've seen, I don't want zheam to have my
address (and I don't mean email), do you?

take it easy

This was a fairly small party with a special ameba/bolinas vibe to it.  
Starting off with the naked dj allen.  By the time the next dj (kelly) came 
on, a few more naked people were dancing around.  
There was a small break in the music when Mr. policeman came down in his 
best authoritative voice, demanding who was responsible for the music and 
saying that all the naked people can be put in jail, especially the men, 
because there were no complaints about the women.  
It didn't take long for Mr. policeman to soften up as he felt the 
friendly vibe and saw that it was just a friendly party.  Asked us to 
turn the music down a little, which was done, and said "you could do what 
you want when I'm gone, if I could take my clothes off, I would, I don't 
make the rules."  With that Mr. policeman frolicted a bit up and down the 
beach a couple of times with a smile on his face before leaving.
After kelly spun tracy played some good high energy music.  After tracy 
came rebecca who brought more of an ambient sound.  I left during her set 
taking  a nice ride back to to sf as the sun set.
Thanks allen for the education on the 13 moon calender, which was reason 
for this party.  All in all it was a friendly, somewhat mellow party, 
with a free spirited vibe on a nice sunnyday at a nice senic beach.

Zheam likes to intimidate people.  He is a paranoid freak who should relax
a bit and listen to what hes saying.  Sounds like he still has that
'midwest' conservative- paranoid mentality.  Hopefully, when he moves here
he will learn to understand the SF scene and appreciate it.  Doesn't he
want to be friends with anyone?

No this kind of talk is a PERSONAL THREAT. It is not someones thought on 
a subject. It is the threat of bodily harm, and it has no place anywhere, 
especially here.

Doesn't everyone own a color laserjet? ;) As far as someone making one 
for themselves, I would suggest the nearest Kinko's. They have all kind 
of neat printing equipment.

Ethan is right. There is a difference, you see, between a 
criticism and a threat of physical violence. If you have a problem 
w/this distinction then I'll make sure that that'll be the last 
distinction you ever make =). Please, let's be careful w/our choice

I can't seem to be able to down load this file- I received a message at the 
end of the transmission that states something to the point of,  "netscape 
needs more allocated memory or to quit all other applications." 

I adjusted the minium and preferred memory for netscape to 7320 megs and 
turned off all other non net inits and still was in the dark (I have 24megs 
total, with about 16 free)- I then tried another mac and still could not get 
the file- There maybe some sort of problem with the way the file was binhexed 
or you may wish to use another form of transmission, so that people will not 
have to make radical adjustments to obtain it-

Anyways I can't wait to see it!

I've been working on a 3-d rendered, interactive DJ setup for the Mac,
and I've got a beta version up on the web for people to download and
play around with.  

It simulates a scene with two turntables and a mixer, and most of the
controls are functional, so you can crossfade, change speeds, adjust
the pitch, backspin, etc.  Again, it's for the Mac only, and please
let me know if you have any problems downloading it, running it, or 
if you notice bugs.

It's a binhex file located in the demos page hanging off my company's
web page:  Go to http://www.crl.com/~tactile, the click on the "Demos"
header next to the turntable.  This will go to the demos page which has
a link to download the file.

I also remember hearing though (from I think it was the 
authorities...meaning police or highway patrol)...that it's good when 
people gawk and slow down when there's a big mess on the highway as it 
helps keep those doing the clean up safer from harm? Would you want to 
have cars streaking by you at 55mph or 25mph while you are helping clean 
up the seen of an accident?

Try loading direct to disk (on a mac, with sys 7.5 or drag n drop extension
you can just grab the link and drag it over to the desktop or any other
finder folder to do this). You don't wnat to have to cut and paste the
binhex into a text file anyway... Then just drag the text file over to
stuffit expander and you're good to go.

The demo is fun! I like it alot. There doesn't seem to be a headphones cue
type of function, though- mixing in the dark is HARD (not that I could mix
anyway :)

Besides all the BS attitude and general childishness that this child
displays, I smell a little bit of hypocrisy, the greatest luxury...

"I'm trying my best to ignore these sideswipes about me on this list but I
have
to respond to those most recent ones about me being holier than thou and
negative "

-much crap deleted-

"PS:Don't worry, I doubt it very much if I do want to hang out with most of
you anyway and some of you like meclay, I swear on my religion that if you
said that shit in my face, it will be the last thing you fucking regret..."

"I will support any 12" artist or DJ in a minute
before I pay $10 or more for a one-night party...that what seperates me from
most of you people out there posting negative shit about me....."

He's sure trying hard not to be negative, or holier than the rest of us.
    Smells like sour grapes too.

"That's why in the areas that are
real like the east coast, you hear of the Josh Winks, The Derrick Carters,
The Basement Boys, Frankies Knuckles and NOT the so-and-so event, or
production/promotion company."

I hope you're not comparing yourself to some of the above.   I'll bet those
guys don't resort to some of your regretable tactics, or sink to your level
of maturity, or rather, lack thereof.   I just can't see Josh Wink getting on
a list and telling people to run out and buy his new single.   If it's real,
and good, then it only needs to get played.   You would have been better off
trying to get a few DJ's to play your tune, to test the response, etc...That
is, if they would have played it.   I don't know, maybe you tried that
already?   


"All I wanted to say is that what I learn from this list is what I've already
learned about SF when I used to live there back in '88 and that most of the
Cali people aren't true to the rave scene.  I've been visiting the Bay area
ever since I moved away and been there as recent as Spring Break and nothing
changed....:("

Hmm,  It seems your skull is a bit thick, if you learned the lesson in '88,
and then again from this list, why even bother with us.   And who are YOU to
say what the rave scene IS, and judge who is being true to it.  I think your
thinking is foul.  Why don't you just go away?   Seems like it would make a
lot of people, yourself included, a little happier, or at least for the rest
of us, alleviate a needless annoyance.   You really need to chill, and think
before you speak, or commit anything to this list.       Tom

Anyone see the recent issue of the SFBay Guardian? The Best of the bay

Pacific's #. Expect an influx of new people...

Also, note that Silent Records (340 Bryant St. Between 1st & 2nd, 3rd

Last night I was reminded of a particularly inspired moment
in high school.  At lunch my friends and I started running through
the hallways yelling "fight, fight, there's a fight!".  By the time
we got to the main courtyard there were about twenty people in tow.
By the time we rounded the gym at least a hundred people were
following us. 

We thought we were pretty damn funny. 

I've been frightened more than once by people on this list.

I don't know which is worse - public fronting or private email.
The latter leaves you feeling very violated.  It's like you are
sitting around whistling dixie and then all of a sudden you've
become someone's personal fixation.  When someone actually 
demands that I spend time on their problems my reaction 
has usually been an amazed - "wow, this is real"

I find it very stalkerish.  Instead of the misplaced connection
that nutcases feel they have with very famous people, on sfraves
the distorted sense of intimacy derives from someone projecting how 
they personally think of the list onto everyone else.

I guess I accept it as part of the nature of sfraves.

Just a response from those of us who don't make or play music - we just
enjoy hearing it.  Where do you think _we_ hear all this great music being
made?  The vast majority of us don't have massive record collections...to
hear the best, latest music we go to parties.  I know many, many ppl who
upon hearing a particular track that they really like will go up, find out
what it is, and then buy it shortly thereafter.  Yes, DJs contribute a whole
lot to the scene, and they make damn good money from ppl who are willing to
pay $10 or whatever to see them spin at a party - I call that supporting the
DJ.  Promoters are a neccessary evil, and events are hyped up because of the
DJs playing at them.  You just don't seem to see the connection...

I'm sorry but treats like the one directed at Meclay have no business on 
the list. I can understand expressing anger, but not in that manner. I 
think things can be expressed in such a way that isn't so rude, imature, 
and treatening. So next time, think about what you are saying and how it 
will affect everyone on this list!

Peace, love and harmony to all beautiful people,

Greg

Well, I'll bet you a million dollars that this Zheam character has not 
been on sfraves very long or has met one single person off of this list.  
I laughed at everything he wrote except for the threat of bodily harm.  I 
have gotten the pleasure of meeting *many* of you off this list and know 
that every one of you are wonderful.  To see someone such as Zheam make 
such rude remarks and generalizations without taking the time to get to 
know us makes me laugh at his ignorance.  I know what sfravers are like.  
We all know what  the scene is about.  We all have our version of our 
"truth" within ourselves so we don't even need to feel threatened by the 
likes of Zheam.  If I were to get flamed by him, I simply push the D 
button and move on.  I don't need it, so I won't acknowledge it. 

love,
Amy

Kicking people off lists just doesn't work, either.  It only makes the
kick-ee more inspired to try and get back on, if not through the same
account, through other accounts.  Any barrier I put up can be worked around,
unless I want to make this a totally closed list whose entry requires filling
out a 15-question "are you a raver" form or something silly like that. 

Zheam's message was unusually harsh in that it contained a not-so-veiled 
threat of personal injury to another list member.  There are appropriate 
ways to deal with that behavior (which I have initiated).

I've said it before, and I'll say it again, a good malapropism always makes
my day!  With those kind of treats, who needs threats?  ;^)

Sorry Greg, I agree with you wholeheartedly.  As for Zheama I'm playing my
older brother's favorite game of the silent treatment.  I always hated
that.

Threats of physical harm are illegal.  It's true.  I saw it on a day-time
talk show.  :^p

D-Oh!  Now you know....

Stay cool people.  And appreciate what's happening this summer!

Amy -

i was refering to a strictly cyber fear ... i've had that
"i wish this person didn't have my email address" feeling that
Ethan seemed to be talking about.

maybe "gave me the creeps" is a better way to describe it.

also, i think we need an official "button girl".
it just sounds kinda cool.  i think the only job prerequisite
should be *extreme* perkiness.

Dear Zheam;

	Wow threats, my haven't we stepped down from our religion, which
one is it The New Church of The Neo-Neanderthraw Rednecks of Jahbip, can I
sign up so that I to can, rightously threaten people, and make them
something less than my high and mighty self, because of what they think or
believe. If God's on your side, I don't want to believe. You talk hate
Zheam, I felt a very derogatory note when you mentioned Pagan Moon
Worshipping. I got news for you and your god, WE ALL SHINE; LOVE, WE ARE
ALL EQUAL, NOT ONE OF GOD'S CREATURES IS LESS THAN ANOTHER BY VIRTUAL OF
ANYTHING, THE LEAST OF WHICH ARE BELIEF SYSTEM'S. 

	Hon, I lived on the East Coast, I grew up there, North, New York,
Philadelphia, Baltimore, DC; South, Gainesville, Jacksonville, Orlando,
whatever & where ever, I feel you will not find a more dedicated vibe, than 
here in SF. Also every soul I've met on this list has been nothing but
upstanding, kind, honest, human, examples; to live & learn from, all. 
Even when we've argued, and disagreed with each other, they've always had 
a hug and a smile for me when I ran into them at a party, even 
after I opened by mouth & inserted by keyboard.

	However, vibe is something that is subjective, and you are
entitled to your feelings & thoughts, less the threats, which are
unexcussable for any person short of a thug. Zheam, despite either your
inability, or fear to communicate what's really on your heart, I don't
believe you are a thug. Any FOOL can go out and hurt, that's only imagened
power, it takes someone special to change the minds of humanity, and lead
by example, and there are many examples of that here on this list, and in
our ranks. 

	Funny you should mention DJ's rather than music creators, I've
seen Josh(From Me Home Town) & Derrick, on more the one occasion & they
rip, but I wonder what they would think of you threating a bunch of people
you don't even know. Some people make a ripple when they come onto the
list, others make a splash, I was one of those. I find it helpful when I
use the words, "I'm sorry", "I was wrong", "I made a mistake", or just I
statements, speaking from the self, sharing your feelings; is & will
always be welcome by most healthy human beings. Cause when you point that
finger, a funny thing happens, you have 3 pointing back at you. I've
appoloized to individuals here, and to the entire list at times, ya know,
it feels good when I do it, it takes the pressure of me having to be right
all the time, it allows me to be human. Your also the 1st person that 
I've ever met that said the East Coast was better, when we got western's 
back there, the 1st ? was why did you leave(in an assotonishing tone). 
The scenes & vibes are different for every part of the country, just like 
the music you here in the clubs, SF's house DJ's couldn't find work 
except in the Disco's of North Central Florida, rather than the Techno 
clubs, cause its's a big trance scene down there.

	DA people on here aren't promoters, for the most part, you're
talkin about less than 5% of the people here, The promoters I know like
Ethan M. & F&F, Greg S. of Harmony, Pacific, Drenalin & others of The
Cloud Factory, Geoff W. of Full Moon, Matt, Claire, & Jake ..etc of
Gateway Systems & others to numerours but worthy of mention have never had
a $25.00 party, maybe you mean Cruel World, anyway. How do I know cause
I've voulenteered/worked for-em all, and my heart & my better than a AWACS
survailence planes intutition tells me so. I assure that you will be given
the same latitute if and when we meet. 

	But at 1st glance, you seem to have a lot to prove, and equally as
much to lose. If some generalalites can be made about the people on this
list, their creative, their innovators, intelligent; academically,
technicially, as well as street smart, some are very gifted; they made
their own way in life, make their own rules, believe their own hearts &
minds, are leaders; and lead by example, are kind, loving, forgiving,
open, honest, politically/evironmentally aware & active, alternative
lifesytle affirmative, for choices, for liberty, respectful, tolerant,
questioning, open minded, artistic; both traditionally & in the
contempory, musicians, engineers, scientists, students, healthcare 
professionals, bums, rouges, vagabonds, hacks, non-violent, but all equal. 

	You will get a lot of attention coming in like gang busters, but
all negative, and I think that's not what you want. If what you have to
offer is good, it will stand out, and people will regonize it for that,
and you will be an asset to OUR scene. But threating people will only take
away from your work, and the long hard hours I'm sure you've put into
it(heart & soul). Raves are people first, it's a party, I come to be with
kind people not just to here the music spin, that's what rock n roll's
become, I come because it's about me, them, us, everybody, not just one 
person, or group, and that's just my opinion.

	People are fearful of someone who's got something to sell, prove,
preach, no one want's to be taken or oppressed by someone elses reality,
or belief system's, and especially if they don't know the person that well. 
When people hear your music that's when they will decide, but you've
already got them wearing colored glasses. We all have our own paths 
Zheam, and if WE CHOSE we can change the direction that where on. Again 
I've found the people on this list to be understanding, forgiving, and 
most of all their aware of their own humanity, and when you see it in 
yourself, it's hard to condem others for it, or at least hold a grudge.

A button GIRL?  What about a button BOY?  Hmm?  How about both.
Extreme perkiness and huggability a must.

Yeah, let's put on the blinders and keep our lily-white list safe
from those bad people...

In the world where Zheam very likely lives, fronting with that kind of
threat is the only way to survive.  He is reacting as he has been trained
to.  I don't agree with his comments, as it is obvious (to me) that the
people on the other end are not a threat to him.  Maybe someday, he will
also realize that fact, but he certainly won't if he is exiled from the
community.

Oh dear, I guess my day's of being the resident obnoxious arsehole on SF 
raves is over.  I hope you are up to the task Zehm.
In reguards to some of the thing's you said you are sought of right about 
people who  
would rather pay more for a rave then for a record but then I also know of 
people who never buy a bands record but would go and see them live; your 
argument is the same and it does not wash.  Also, it sounds like you 
can't even give your record away so it must be really bad.  Do not diss 
the scene here either because while there are a bunch of pretentious 
wankers their number is small and most people here are, for Californians, 
a sound bunch of people who would be on the vibe if they could only work 
out what it is(and at least they are trying to find it with love in their 
hearts).  Other's, quite a lot in fact, are totally soughted 
people.  If don't like SF why don't you make like a bird a and go back to 
what ever stone you crawled out from.
To be honest with you Zehm, you seem like you are acting like an immature 
spoilt child because it's very easy to get stuff played out here, 
people/dj's have a very open attitude to their work here but with your 
attitude the only place you are likely to get a response from is maybe 
MTV.  Just chill-out and let love fill your heart instead of bitterness; 
(everybody) don't take it all to seriously because, at the end of the day, 
you are not worth it as a person.  Tell me, do you get laid often?  
I don't think that you do.  Maybe that is why you have your thumb 
shoved so tightly up your arse.  Remember: take it out from time to 
time so that your arse can have a rest!  Enough slagging, now for 
some advise.
Think about what you are saying more carefully.  Anybody who says that he 
would not like to know a group of people, merely on internet heresay, has 
no place OUR rave scene (we can not, obviously, speak for else where in 
the country) because there mind is obviously not open to new ideas.  Try the 
rock scene mate, ego heads have a better rate of success their then 
here. Hoping to meet you at a rave,
TRISTAN.
PS.  Acctually, come to trhink of it, I don't particually want to hang out 
with you either.

Dear Deleuze;

	This is what I was told to do by a Doctor of Emergency Medince at 
Alta Bates Hospital, when I walked in, said I been doing ##### for the 
past 48 hours and can't get to sleep, what can I do to help myself. The 
first thing he said was don't do #####, the next thing he said was go get 
some benedrly and take it until I slept, in fact he even gave be an IM 
injection of 50mg to start me off. When it comes to the body, or the 
health of myself or others, I assure you I'm slightly more liberal than 
the doctors, but not much, and would never addvocate doing anything I 
haven't discussed with someone much more knowledgeable than me, and done 
myself first. DISCLAIMER: Of course when in these situtions always consult a 
qualified health care professional before taking any actions. abOVE ALL 
PLEASE TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF WHEN DOIN THE HARDER DRUGS; GET SLEEP, & EAT 
REGULAR MEALS, YOU MAY FEEL IMMORTAL, BUT THEY MAY JUST PROVE HOW MORTAL 
YOU ARE.

Hiya

just a little note to introduce myself to everyone at least once now that 
I'm a subscriber to this mailing list
I'm down here at UC Santa Barbara but am from Sunnyvale and was 
introduced to raves for the first time last summer..only been to a 
couple, but have enjoyed them very much

just looking forward to gathering information on SF area raves and so 
forth since my knowledge is somewhat on the limited side..and hopefully 
I'll meet some new people along the way, especially when I come home for 
a month away from Santa Barbara in August

thank you for letting me take up some space
have a nice day

Michael Ball

hello everyone.  i'm new at this (raving) after having been dragged in
kicking and screaming by jake (with the 4ad .sig).  i love it, and i love
the people.
just one thing : when i was growing up, one thing i learned was to
wait.  if a member of this community wants to blast sfraves, let him, and
take the wind from his sails.  as a former asshole (high school and back)
i know the most frustrating response to a threat is a smile. i (and i
encourage the rest of us to join me ) am smiling.
ok, another thing : the other lesson i learned (rather recently, in fact)
was to forgive.  why not?  why fall prey to to the inhumanity that most
ravers i've met are trying to escape?

peace within us, peace behind us, peace under our feet
peace between us, peace over us, let everybody be peace.

     I just want to tell you all, especially Tristan and Zheam, that I love 
     you all for your many shades of grey (and not just in your hair), your 
     creativity, your humor, your sarcasm, your pettiness, your 
     insecurities, your aggressiveness, your needs to and for love and 
     attention, your perspectives, your ability to wank and tweak people's 
     emotions over the net--as well as to inspire them to take a stand, 
     etc. 
     
     For it reminds me to show respect to others, as well as to take a good 
     look at myself before I make a statement and to uphold what I believe. 
     For without faith in myself, there would be little hope in what I 
     could do in life for myself and others.  (It's not so dismal, really!)

     Love can be a colorless word if used too much so let's just cut 
     through this thread and learn to turn the negative aspects over to the 
     positive (yin and yang) by reaffirming what brought us to this list.  
     Let's acknowledge that there will always be flame wars and a few 
     (okay, more than a few) negative posts from time to time on this list 
     and it always fans out.  If we choose to feed a fire, then we've got 
     to take the heat.  We'll regain a balance much like nature only this 
     is in cyberspace.
     
     Okay, I'm stepping off my psyche soap box.  Someone help me walk on 
     these hot coals over to the bed of nails, I've got a bad knee and I 
     need a hug.
     
     Warm, wet, and squishy,

So what _can_ you do if a friend is (in your judgement) abusing liquor/
coke/meth/weed/H/whatever?

Make sure you and others aren't encouraging it.  "Oh man, he's
_so_ funny when he's wasted."  "Who cares if you got to work tomorrow?
It's an FMR, dude."  "Sure you don't want another bong hit?"

Let them know, sometime when they're listening to you, that you think
they're out of control, and that you don't want to be with them when
they are.  Make sure they know that you _will_ be there for them if they
try to kick, and follow through on both sides of your promise.  _Don't_
keep saving people from their own drug-induced stupidity unless it's
literally life and death.  (I once helped shepherd a friend through a
bad night of downers and JD.  He was trying to kill himself with a Swiss
Army knife, beard crusted blue from all the pills he had taken (prescribed
for him by some not-very-good psychiatrist).
His other friend and I kept him awake and alive -- his friend
by staring him down and saying "Look, motherfucker.  If you die, I'm dying
with you.  Every one of these little blue pills you eat, I eat.  Every shot
you take, I take.  Here's a fifth of JD.  Come on, let's get started.  You
want to die?  Let's go."  By this time we had kept him talking long enough
that his previous intake got to him and he fell asleep after only a couple
of rounds.  I hung around for a few hours to make sure both of them were
a) breathing and b) sleeping on their side so they didn't swallow their
own vomit and choke.  The next day he went into rehab.  It's not fun to
wake up in your own bodily fluids with police citations you don't remember 
and can't pay stuffed in your pockets.)

You can't force anyone to do anything.  Only you can change the way you
live.  If someone doesn't want to kick, they won't, and they'll just backslide
once you're gone.

Be careful of AA.  They preach (literally) a strange brand of recovery, which
trades your addiction to drugs for an addiction to the group (you're always
a 'recovering alcoholic' even if you've been sober for twenty years), and
a dependence on a 'higher power' taken usually to mean the god of the Bible.
This is usually preferable to death, but I find twelve-step zombies just as
dysfunctional as drug abusers, albeit in a more societally acceptable way.

Know what you're talking about.  Don't give advice from ignorance ("X drains
your spinal fluid") or you'll be completely cut off when they figure out 
you're bullshitting.

Offer alternatives.  What else is there to do that drugs are preventing them
from doing?  If you can't answer this, take a serious look at your position.

Be there for them.

Errm, this may be a bit old fashioned and analag but how about marking pens

last year at Radio! Radio! Rafaelle Senna brought color printouts of the 
badges and a whole little kit to make buttons and everything.  I lost 
mine about a month later while stomping at Groove Kitchen because the 
pin mechanism was prolly not best suited for raving...

	Man!  This recent rash of violent/political/wayoutphilosophy posts 
seems to have watered down the rave review posts.  I thought that I'd 
interject a couple of pennies here.

	Friends & Family (#?)  aka the Joe Rice birthday party --

	mmmmmmm baby..... a little lower.  This party scratched my rythmic itch
in one fierce way.  I hadn't been out in a while -- solyluna in Berkeley 
being my last official outing -- so this was just what the doctor ordered.
The space was choice as usual.  Just the right size for an intimate, high vibe,
goin' off sweaty mess.  Lots of new faces at this one, as well as the usual
cast of characters that over the last year I've become accustomed to.  And the
tunes!  Plus, visuals that keep getting better and better.  Even though it's 
the same people doing them, the stuff doesn't get stale.  Some of the old 
movie footage worked really well. 

	My memory's a little cloudy, so forgive me if this isn't 100% correct.
I got there after a wonderful Thai meal at _Basil_, which is a reasonably
priced, very groovy little place to grab a bite.  We arrived just as Ethan 
came on, and he led us on an amazing deep trance/techno journey that got me on
the floor right away.  A very solid set led into some high bpm stuff played
very well by jonathan (last name escapes me).  That boy came on and worked the
floor hard!  By the middle of his set, I had exhausted myself and set out to
find a ride home.

	Amazing this community we've got here -- within five minutes of 
asking around, I found a way home from a couple of people I had only met once
before (my ride being the early bedtime types).  Thanks again to Don and
Nathan for the ride. This party was such a contrast to the more typical 
kegobeer gathering I had attended last week.  Even if the face was unfamiliar,
it was friendly. 

	Next on in the main room was Joe's cool friend :-) who played a nice
slightly more funky set -- the pace had gotten a little monotonous by then.
Didn't last long, and I was out getting a superb backrub by our very own 
susie.  Ask her for one next time, you won't regret it...  Unfortunately,
I missed most of Joe's set, but the part that I herd was nice.  By this time
(ca. 3am), the chill space had filled up, and things were starting to thin
out a bit.  We moseyed around four, missing Bryce's set which sounded, uh....
educational!  (whished I would have heard the godfather on a big soundsystem)

	An evening well spent.

take good care of it,

steve

I just happen to pick up some Ma-Haung for a party I plan on going to
Sat. Night.

I trust alot of the people on this list so I am asking what the dosage 
would be for a 150 pounder to receive a decent energy buzz.

Each capsule is 375mg and the recomended dose is 2-8.
its not herbal e but it basically the same stuff. I know many of you hate 
erbal e. Its just that its safer than the real thing for me.

I feel very self-conscious asking this on the list, I hope no one finds 
it unapropiate. Sorry if they do.
Respond privately please.
thanks
dan :)

Yeah, but the hostility, threats and attitude sure won't make him any 
friends.  At least to me anyway. I run away from people like him - I 
prefer the friendly, likable types who at least smile every once in 
awhile and make me feel welcome. That's just how I see it, anyway.

This a good start.

AA has no preachers. AA members traditionally share their "experience
strength and hope." On rare occasions someone forgets this tradition and
gets preachy. I just tune them out.

A brand of recovery that has been working well for 55 years and has been
copied by nearly everyone in the recovery field. Including, almost
certainly the rehab your friend went to.

Well, kinda. However, for me, drinkin'n'drugin' took up at least 60 hours per
week. While recovery only takes about 6 hours per week.

>a dependence on a 'higher power' taken usually to mean the god of the Bible.

Not in the meetings I go to. Most of the sober people I know are into pre
x-tian spirituality. AA is different everywhere you go. Meetings close to
Haight street tend to have lots of pierced and tattooed nonx-tian freaks
(isn't that amazing?) You/your friends may find Haight area meetings more
to your liking.

Some are as dysfunctional. However they are the ones who are, in fact, not
working the 12 steps.

That sounds alot like the "one addict helping another" one finds in NA and AA.

Also, what are drugs making them do. (puke, crash motor vehicles, spend

Subject: (fwd) REASONS WHY E-MAIL IS LIKE A PENIS:


Some folks have it, some don't. Those who have it would be
devastated  if it were ever cut off. They think that those who don't
have it are  somehow inferior. They think it gives them power. They
are wrong. Those who don't have it may agree that it's an nifty toy,
but think it's  not worth the fuss that those who do have it make
about it. Still, many  of those who don't have it would like to try it.

It can be up or down. It's more fun when it's up, but it makes it hard
to get any real work done.

In the long-distant past, its only purpose was to transmit
information  considered vital to the survival of the species. Some
people still think that's the only thing it should be used for, but
most folks today use it for fun most of the time.

Once you've started playing with it, it's hard to stop. Some people
would just play with it all day if they didn't have work to do.

It provides a way to interact with other people. Some people
take this  interaction very seriously, others treat it as a lark.
Sometimes it's hard to tell what kind of person you're dealing with
until it's too late.

If you don't apply the appropriate protective measures, it can

It has no brain of its own. Instead, it uses yours. If you use
it too  much, you'll find it becomes more and more difficult to think
coherently.

We attach an importance to it that is far greater than its actual size
and influence warrant.  If you're not careful what you do with it, it
can get you in big trouble.

It has its own agenda.  Somehow, no matter how good your intentions,
it  will warp you behavior. Later you may ask yourself "why on earth
did I  do that?"

It has no conscience and no memory.  Left to its own devices,
it will do the same damn dumb things again and again.

Here's a suggestion: Put a filter on your mail. Unlike you being forced 
to receive junk mail like you do with snail mail, you can just filter out 
the garbage. I have noticed that when people receive automated replies, 
they tend to get real pissed >:)

Does this imply you enjoy making others angry?

If the other person is negative, does reacting to them negatively help
positively influence them?

If an individual emotes negative behavior, wouldn't it be in our best
interest to affect the individual as positively as possible to help create a
positive CHANGE away from negativity, as opposed to reinforcing it?  

Perhaps I'm being nitpicky, but this I don't understand.

It's pretty clear Zheam wasn't issuing a real threat, just behaving like
a net.bully   Third time, Zheam: frontin' don't go nowhere here.

I'm not for kicking him off the list, I am for having him stick around
and see that we work hard at supporting each other and being fair and
listening to our differences.   Even the Zippies figured that out after
a while :) :)

When someone is continually posting "Your an asshole Blah Blah Blah" 
messages it tends to make one a bit upset. So rather than posting back a 
nasty message myself, I choose to filter. It prevents me from continuing the 
cycle of negativity by removing the cause. I think it a very valid compromise.
I am happy because I don't have to worked up about some twit, and 
aforementioned twit is often pissed because they can't send me nasty mail, 
generally forcing them to direct their negativity elsewhere. And that makes me
feel GREAT, because I am forcing the anger, etc. right back at the person 
without involving myself further in their inadequacy issues.

An interesting question. But by doing nothing except refusing to accept 
negativity in the form of e-mail, how am I reinforcing it? Has it become 
my task to change the attitudes of the millions of disaffected? Sorry, I 
never signed up for that job. Involving yourself constantly with negative
people, situations, attitudes constantly will drain you.

I can only live my life based on my experiences, and beliefs that have 
come from those experiences. And what I have found in my own life, is 
that the individual had to decide their own mind set. Some people enjoy 
misery, hate and anger. Nothing is going to change that unless they want 
to change it. You can be as positive to them as you want, but unless they 
have the will within themselves to change, you efforts will have no 
effect. 

I see my job in life to be as happy a person as I can and to extend it to 
others. However, it is not my place to foist my happiness upon those who 
do not wish to be involved in it, just at it no ones' place to force 
their religion(spirituality,etc.) upon me.

No, I just think that we have differing views of how to relate to people. 
I respect your view and the way you live your life, but it is your 
formula for life. Please respect mine.

Dutch, Carlos and Markie:

are you confirmed to spin ravestock?

there seems to be *alot* of dj's who are listed on the flyer who say 
they were never confirmed or some even never asked to play. I was 
wondering if you were or not - as i'm keeping a list of the acts who 
are not going to show. It's growing, and a bunch of us are trying to 
unveil this huge-corporate-greed machine for what it is.

please reply to me privately.

It must be a problem with CRL.  They switched networks Monday and some 
messages must have gotten lost. I had the same problem, and only SFR was 
affected.  I am receiving SFraves now.

just thot i should add something positive to the mix; thangs have been
  getting down (esp on sfraves) lately...

i wuz on sabattical (sp?) for 6 weeks on the island of moorea last month,
  (it's right next to tahiti, about 2000 miles south of hawaii) just to
   get away from technology for awhile and to just watch the world go by.
my morning ritual was to make some breakfast, like eggs and bagettes with
  jam, and then to sit out on the beach with a cup o' java.  now, i wasn't
    just sitting ON the beach, i was actually halfway in the water.  over
      there, the islands are surrounded by a lagoon, which is as still as
        a mountain lake in the morning.  i mean you can clearly see clouds
         mirrored in it.
anyway, cut to the chase.  the lagoon has ZILLIONS of fish in it, and after
  a week, i had trained this rather large group of fish to recognize me as
    a source of bread.  i'd toss some little bits into the water, and the
      fish would come by and start nibbling the bread.  then, as their
       fear of peeple would pass, i'd stick a piece of bread between my
         two biggest toes and stick my foot in the water.  what a strange
          feeling, having hundreds of fish jostle for a piece of bread 
            around your foot!  these fish didn't have any teeth that i
              could determine, and so it basically felt like kisses or
                like a gentle touch. even after the bread was gone,
                  the fish would linger for up to an hour, hoping for more.
after a week, all i had to do was just plop my beach chair into the water
  and the fish would go for my foot.  over a hundred would show up within
    five minutes.  they knew the place and time, for sure.
hopefully, some of the pix i took will develop well, and i'll post them
  to my homepage; i even photo'ed the fish swarming around my coffeecup
    in about 2 inches of water; they were even swimming through the
      handle of the cup, if you can believe that!  

if yer ever in tahiti, make like a bastard for the lagoon with some bread.
  you won't be dissapointed!

Anyone up for a motorcycle ride down route 1 to Santa Cruz this afternoon?
I know it is kind of short notice, and the destination is not fixed, but I
thought I would bring up the option.  I am really bored waiting around for
the phone to ring at the office, and would rather go DO SOMETHING!!!

That sounds like an experience that you would never forget. The 
simplest things in life sometimes can be the most meaningful. Nature 
is truly beautiful and sometimes we all just need to take a break 
from eveything and just be with nature. Whether it be in the forest, 
a lake, a patch of flowers, we just need to appreciate our beautiful 
surroundings. I love taking long walks in the forest and just 
listening to all the truly beautiful sounds that emminate there. I 
feel like I am in another world, not bound by reality. It is a 
spiritual experience and after I decide to come back to the 'real 
world', I always feel so rejuvenated. I feel like I have received new 
strength to deal with the not so nice things we all so often have to 
deal with. 
 Please post or email me when you get your home page updated, I would 
love to take a short trip through your wonderful experience!

Luv to all! ;)

>Who's going to area 51 thhen?

Area 51 seems to be one of those hugh commerical $20 raves
that everybody likes to dis on this group but I heard the
last one was really good.  Is this one an exception, cause 
I'm interested in going but would hate to waste my time and
money if it's just a big glitzed out no vibe kinda thing.

hello friends--

this is heather, just back from the wasteland, and have to tell you how 
beautiful it is to be here, if only for a short time.  This seems to be a 
very special week, doesn't it?  The day out of time, the new moon, and 
weird and wonderful things happening every which way you look.  

The ever-growing new moon collective is celebrating the first new moon of 
the new Mayan calendar at a favorite place near Bodega Bay (where Glenn 
and I were married last June new moon)  on this FRIDAY.  It's about a 2 hour 
drive, but this party and this place are worth the trip.  The rangers are 
really nice, too.

We'll be starting at sunset and continuing well into Saturday.  Call (415) 
267-3076 for directions.  We will be dropping off directions at the 
amebas tonight as well if you want a written copy.

Things to bring:
--an open heart and mind:  this is a celebration of the sacred cycles
--extra warm clothes, as this beach can be quite windy and cold at night
--a flashlight per car is essential, as there is a rocky bit   
  on the way;  you need to be able to see
--blankets, sunscreen, lots of water, food, firewood
--flowers

One last thing--we are going to set up little bags with sand in them for 
ashtrays. They'll be up near the front somewhere.  Please, come and get 
one for your butts if you are going to smoke.

One other last thing--we are trying to put together a little first aid 
kit (I can't help myself--I'm a medical student).  If you have any of 
these things, and you feel like bringing them and lending them to us for 
the duration of the party, please bring them and give them to one of the 
new mooners. Also if you need any of these things, please come and find 
Heather.  We need/will have: bandaids, neosporin, emergency water, 
visine, sunscreen, tampons, condoms, calamine lotion, moisturizer, 
asprin, ibuprofin, antihistamines, a cellular phone.

A big warm welcome to the Hymns and Anthems Tribe--the circles are 
closing!

Hope to see you on Friday.  

This is (in the words of Mona Love)

The New Moon sometimes Afterglow always Great Day Times

>Who's going to area 51 thhen?

I'd been looking forward to this party all summer, as i don't go out 
all that much here, and i know that area 51 would be the real 
deal...but unfortunately i don't have enough money to pay for tickets, 
so i'm dealt out. I"m really bummed about it but c'est la vie. have a 
good time.

	Hey, y'all! It's time for me to stop slacking in college and
get a Real Job (tm), and the paths of time and tide are drawing me
towards the Bay Area. I'm coming to town early next week (strictly
during the week so I keep my broke self down to business) and then I'm
moving two weeks after that.
	Here's where I make a shameless plea and throw myself on the
sfraves commmunity's mercy: I need somewhere to stay on Monday and
Tuesday nights of next week, and I'm also looking for an
apartment. Although I'm not exactly sure where I'm going to be working
yet, I'm sort of assuming that the best place for me to live would be
somewhere in the East Bay. But I'm not too set on that.
	Anyway, I'll keep this brief to keep the signal/noise ratio
level of this list at its usual high level. :| If any of you would
like to help a friendly, clean raver / DJ / computer geek type out,
I'd love to hear from you. All thanks in advance.

yrz,
ozymandias

Im going, The D.J. lineup sounds great, and even though the raves that go on
at the Richmond Auditorium kinda suck, it still seems cool, they always have
phat visuals, its just that there doesn't seem to be a good vibe going
around. Hmmm maybe it's just me? But then again, If the vibe sucks, somebodys
got to try and change it!

   Lotsa action this weekend - two new moon parties, plus big parties
   Area 51 and Catastrophic, plus the dependable Organic. There'll be
   free parties on Sunday, one in Golden Gate Park (at the bandshell, I
   guess) and probably Sunset again. Then Wednesday is Come-Unity at
   1015.
   
   If I may plug myself, I'll be spinning at the gathering at the
   Internet Salon Friday evening, along with SFRavers Paraffin & Phred,
   and I'll be demo'ing my 3-d interactive turntable simulation on the
   Mac there as well.

Drugs can be a very positive thing.  They can open people up to the 
reality of the universe and the beauty of the inner being.  The lessons 
of certain particular drugs (IMHO psycadelics and especialy E)  can be 
the greatest gifts in the world. But we must be careful.

If we don't strive to live our everyday lives as we do when we are high 
than we must question our use of the drug.  We should get high to have 
a great time and most of all to learn.

Carry it over.  E has an afterglow.  In many ways this glow can last 
your whole life.  Hold on to the feelings of ecstacy as much as you 
can. Strive to reach the point where you no longer use drugs.  I know 
this must be possible.

I echo these sentiments...
Drugs can provide people with rich, rewarding experiences, or they can 
tear apart one's perceptions and make a person dependent on 
them...everyone's just got to find that fine line between use and 
addiction and make sure that they stay on the right side.

Hey all,

The main reason I pay for online service is to have sfraves.  The main 
reasons I like sfraves is because I find out info about raves.  To me 
raves include mix tapes, 12 inch records, house partys, and experiences 
from those partys as they effect our everyday life. SFRaving IS a way 
of life.

I may be out of hand as to the context of the list but please keep 
promoting yourselves.  The Power of internet is its ability to allow 
the underground to spread without the need of the media.

love chris

FINALLY!!! someone who actually makes sense on this admittedly touchy
subject.  You said this very well and I agree with this fully.

I must say though the only thing I wonder is why some non-drug users get so
defensive about it and class ppl like us with "losers" and "idiots"?  I'm a
26-year-old graphic designer who worked her way though printing school
courses, and have a steady job and a good enough income to live on my own
in a house with three cats.  I have never had to ask my parents for
finanicial assistance, although it's there if I need it.  I have a large
circle of very close friends, both drug users and non.  I graduated high
school with flying colours and am considering entering university to study
paleontology.  I read voraciously.  I make music.  I enjoy life to the
fullest.  I don't smoke, nor do I drink.  I choose to take e, acid and dope
instead, these being less harmful to my system and emotions.  And I also am
VERY aware of the dangers of these substances and treat them with
appropriate respect.

Now, why do I (and people like me) get classed as an idiot???

(sorry got a little rhetorical oh well it's been a long day.)

I had thought that the GGPark party was going to feature DubTribe until
Galen told me that Pacific & Jane-of-Progress were going to combine
forces and put on the DubTribe's welcome-back-from-touring party in 
Marin on Sunday, except that Jane didn't get the permits and left town.

So although Pacific is going to try to work something out, I'm still
wondering if perhaps I was initially wrong about the park party having 
anything to do with DubTribe.  Organic often likes to throw one
at the Band Shell after one of their parties, except that they usually
like to use Galen's sound system for them.

Clearly I'm confused. %^P  Anyone know if there really is  going to be
a party in GG Park? 

Anyway, whatever people do this weekend, enjoy!  Work pressure requires
me to stay low-key.

Lee

I'm helping a friend put on a sound healing workshop next Sat Aug 5 
during the day in the city.

The workshop is led by the Irish musician Phil Harrington (who I met at a 
Full Moon Rave in LA a couple of years ago). The process he has developed 
over the past seven years is called VOCE (vo-chay, Italian for voice). It 
consists of chakra toning, shamanic dreaming and ecstactic singing.

I participated in this process for four months while Phil was living in 
L.A. and I found it to be a great learning experience which opened up my 
creativity and produced profound states of consciousness.

If anyone is interested in more information please e-mail me privately 
and I will give you all the details.

peace,
ronan

Sounds like there's two, but on different nights.  Someone (415-679-3113) is 
doing an event tonight, while the new moon collective (415-267-3076) is 
coming out to play Friday.  When in doubt, go to both...

IMHO, it is because people that don't do our drugs have absolutely no 
clue what they do. When we do psychedelics, it puts us in another 
reality. This reality is something that only those who have also 
experienced it can understand. While we are in this different 
reality, we think and act differently also. People see us partaking 
in this reality while they cannot see it, cannot feel it, cannot 
understand it. And because of that a lot of people cannot relate, 
they become jaded, in some instances maybe even jealous. And they 
decide to call us crazy, tweeked, fucked up, losers, etc. It goes 
along with the syndrome of belittling other people to make yourself 
feel better about your short-comings. They don't reach the same state 
of mind as us, so of course we are the ones that are dangerous, we 
are the ones that need to be "turned around" so to speak. 
What it all comes down to is they can't even begin to imagine the 
experiences we have had, and how we use them to model the way we act, 
the way we talk, the way we think, the way we interact with others, 
etc. and that scares them.

Luv to all!

As long servers already know, I do not like big commercial raves because 
they are ussually frought with bad attitude from the organnizers and the 
security, high prices for a sound system that looks flash but sounds like 
shit and for spectacular vissuals that most of us can already do on our 
systems at home.  That's why I only went to the last one because I was 
helping out in the S.P.A.Z. room.  Imagine my surprise when I found out 
that of all the above was NOT true; it prooved that one can have a big 
all ages rave with out it being taking over by commercialism.  Area 51 
was probably the only big rave I have ever been to that still maintained 
that underground renergade feeling about it.  No small achievement by the 
organizers.
So if this Area 51 is even half as good as the last one it will still be 
a blinding party.  I'll be in the Alpha section and the Ameba room; 
please check me there.
Area 51: prooving that there is a vibe after commercialism.  See ya there!
TRISTAN.

I was just informed of a party happening tonight in Sacrmento at the Batting
cages.  It's called ONE.  I noticed it haddn't been posted to the list so I
thought I'd inform everyone.  The number is (916) 556-4684.  I don't know
who the dj's are for the main room, but I'm supposed to be spinning in the
ambient space (that's the bsp part).  Anyway, hope to see you there.
Remember, bring lots of water.  Later.

I saw the drug user thread and thought that I would share my non-user
opinion on the matter.

IHMO, ...

First, I went through an phase where I ended up doing
most drugs that were available.  You name it, there is a good chance I did it.
I merely state this to avoid the "You never done it so you wouldn't know"
shouting matches.

I have just found for me that music alone is enough to lift me to a higher
platau (sp?).  I get myself so worked into the beat, I end up half
hypnotized.  At times I have gotten so lost, that my friends would swear
that I was on something.  It is a awsome feeling to get
into this state and then feel the endorphens and adrenalin racing through
your system.  My body feel so alive and full of energy.  I can feel my nerves
just reaching out, grabbing hold of the universe and carrying me away.  The
ride is as much driven by you as it is your surroundings and environment. 

For me, however, it is much harder to reach that state when under the 
influence of some other substance.  While the rush/high is usally really good,
I personally get more out of the natural high I get from music and dancing
(couple it with and outdoor location and I am in heaven....).  Not to say that
if a good batch of schrooms were passed my way that I wouldn't partake, I just
choose not too as a general rule.

The point:  For me and my friends, this works out real well.  I can share in
their experiences and they can share mine.   I feel that the state I reach
is compatible and on the same level as their's.  We trip together, it is just
induced my another means.  But when the shit goes down, they also know that
there is a sober person around to help them out (rides/crashes/bad trips/etc). 

In my mind, it is not important how you reach a plane of higher 
consciousness, just make sure you visit it every so often.  If you find
it through exercise, music, drugs, go for it.  Just make sure you can also find
your way back home.

Party safe, responsibly, and most importantly OFTEN!

hugs
mike

I'm looking at getting a techno party together for SIGGRAPh, for all
of us propeller-heads that also enjoy repetitive beats...

So, email me if you'd be interested in coming, and include a guess
at how many friends might be with you (so I can make sure we have
a big enough space).  Also, if you are a dj and would like to spin,
email that info as well.

The party will probably be Friday evening.

FUTURE SOUND OF LONDON and FREAKY CHAKRA invited to join Lollapalooza
companion ENIT Festival

 Astralwerks recording artists Future Sound Of London and Freaky Chakra have
been invited to join the lineup of the ENIT Festival. ENIT is an all-night
electronic dance music event being held August 10-18 in four cities during
the Lollapalooza tour - Dallas, Phoenix, Los Angeles, and San Francisco in
conjunction with Lollapalooza '95.  Located in a venue away from the
Lollapalooza Main Stage, ENIT begins once main stage headliner Sonic Youth
ends.  The brainchild of Lollapalooza co-founder Perry Farrell, ENIT is a
proverbial 'gathering of the tribes,' combining live music, DJ's, dancing,
and avant-garde film into a full-on multimedia extravaganza.  
 Multimedia masterminds, Future Sound Of London will be screening Teachings
>From The Electronic Brain, a 20-minute film created by the band in
collaboration with graphic artist Buggy G. Riphead to accompany their
recently re-released ISDN  album.  Culled from Future Sound of London's live
broadcasts last year via the Integrated Services Digital Network, the initial
limited edition pressing of ISDN sold out within three days of release
(20,000 copies worldwide).
 San Francisco-based producer/remixer Freaky Chakra has quickly risen through
the ranks as one of the best up-and-coming American talents in underground
dance music.   Freaky Chakra's debut full-length album, Lowdown Motivator,
released this spring on Astralwerks, was met with overwhelming worldwide
acclaim from dance music press, DJ's, and partygoers alike for his unique
flavor that stands apart from his West Coast counterparts.  Live, Freaky
Chakra will be joined by fellow Bay Area cohort Single Cell Orchestra (billed
as Freaky Chakra vs. Single Cell Orchestra) in a soundclash of analog
electronics, funky beats, and soundtrack soundscapes.     
 Accompanying Future Sound Of London and Freaky Chakra on the festival dates
are Moby, ex-porno-star-turned-techno-diva-DJ Traci Lords, DJ Keoki,
Farrell's band Porno For Pyros (Dallas and Phoenix only),  U.K. ethno-techno
experimentalist Banco de Gaia, and German wunder DJ Sven Vath (Los Angeles
and San Francisco only).

-ENIT FESTIVAL DATES & VENUES-
Thursday, August 10 - Bomb Factory/Dallas, TX
Saturday, August 12 - Icehouse/Phoenix, AZ
Monday, August 14 - Shrine Auditorium/Los Angeles, CA
Friday, August 18 - Warfield Theatre/San Francisco,CA

I think this is one of the best posts I've seen on this subject.  Basically,
I think that you can only be your own moral police; you can try to help out
other people by sharing your thoughts and feelings with them, but ultimately
the responsibility for their actions lie with them.  So I don't really
understand when people start bad-mouthing drug users or non-drug users
because that is not the choice that the bad-mouther makes himself.  Do what
you need to to be the best person you can be and let other people do the same.

On a related note regarding other ideas from this post, have you ever
noticed that when you're with a group of people, especially a group of good
friends, if just one of those people are high on something, all the other
people with them start to feel and act the same way?  Some people say
psychosomatic, but I'd say just plain psychic.  Lots of things out there
that we still don't understand about the human brain, kids.

Well it seems like a lot of sfravers are going. That vibe must account

Actually, I think it's a good thing that this article showed up.  The more
people that react positively toward the scene, the better.  Sure, in the
long run this will probably lead to a bunch of glitzed-out hyper-commercial
raves, but that doesn't mean the smaller ones will disappear.  This means
that all us die-hard ravers :) will still have the atmosphere that we enjoy.
And I know that for most of us the scene is about the people anyways, so the
way I see it the more, the better.

   at the risk of sounding repetative, i too am going to Area 51.
i usually don't like supporting $20+ parties, but i really 
enjoyed the last Area 51...the music was great, the vibe was
pretty good (considering it was at the Richmond Civic...),
incredible visuals (lots of lasers...lots of aliens heads looking 
down on the crowd....i swear we were in a ufo....).  needless 
to say, i'm looking forward to this party...it's one of the 
few $20 parties that i consider supporting nowadays....

   oh, if anybody is interested in meeting me...i'll be wearing 
an elmo shirt and a black backpack..and i'll have one of my 
elmo dolls...i have blond hair...my hobbies include...(sorry,
i get a little carried away sometimes  =)

have a happy day-
 matt

Whoa, this is way long, you can skip to the bottom if you don't care about
my story.

An interesting thing happened to me last night at Thursday Night Market (a
event held every thurs. during the summer for downtown merchants in
Sacramento.  They sell stuff and theres music and what not.)  My girlfriend
Phelps and I were walking back to her car after the weekly movie they show,
Young Frankenstein...classic...(it's pretty cool, cuz they project it on to
the side of this old brick building, outdoors!)....Anyway, so we were
walking back to the car, holding hands see and Phelps looks down and just
stops and stares at the ground.  I walked forward a few feet.  She stands
there just looking an says something like "this is cool".  She pickes up
what she was looking at and says this is a cool flyer.  I caught a glimps of
the front and thought it looked like a rave flyer and pretty cool as well.
It said PARTHENON, AUGUST 4.  She turns it over and says "hey, DJ Dan is
playing.  I say "oh yea, let me have a look", I read the dj's: Karizma
(Sac), Swing Kid (SF), Donald Glaude (Seattle), Spun (SF), Jan Cooley (SF),
and DJ Dan (SF).  Then it says "Ambient Room Featuring: Rig-A-Tony's Ambient
Crew and I do like a complete back flip and say "WHAT?".  You see Rig-A-Tony
was my room mate for about a year and tought me about records.  I had hated
them previously.  I got my tables from him as well.  And at every Rave that
he does the ambient room, I've played.  I was trippin cuz he didn't say
anything about this to me, even though I've been termed as part of the Sac
Ambient Crew, who usually plays on Rig-A-Tony's system.  So I call him today
and he's all "hey, I was supposed to call you today".  Turns out I am
spinning at the show, and it is supposed to be a killer space.  The show is
at the Daily Grind Skate Park in West Sacramento, I guess there is supposed
to be like three sound systems, with the ambient room in it's own enclosed
space, with a door (YEEEAAAA!).  So there you have it, my funny BSB.  

PARTHENON
August 4
DJ's:  Karizma, Swing Kid, Donald Glaude, Spun, Jan Cooley, DJ Dan
Ambient Room:  Rig-A-Tony's Ambient Crew (Rig-A-Tony, Rick, Phil, Tim?)

And Introducing: Dr. Zimms (I don't know what that is all about)

Hello all,

After 3 wonderful years of partying in the Bay Area, Whitsitt and I are 
hitting the highways and byways of the United States for a while, to see 
the sights, party in other parts of the country, and hopefully do some 
parties.  It's been a great experience to live in the Bay Area and 
especially to participate in the house music community here, the parties 
and people are some of the most open, loving, and free that I've ever 
encountered.  The SFRaves party Connection II in Spring 1993, in the 
rain and cold at Berkeley Marina, was a huge influence in the formation of 
our sound system, and many other similar parties have continued to 
inspire us since then -- New Moon, Sunset, Harmony, Cloud Factory...and 
now we've decided to take to the road and visit and party with people 
across the States.  We hope to do as many free outdoor parties on the 
road as we can, and if you can help us get in touch with people who are 
interested in doing that, please do; I hope to be able to check my email 
while on the road, but a more sure way would be to call our voicemail at 
415.487.7681.  Any help in connecting us with people in any area of the 
country would be very appreciated!

But before we go, we're throwing ourselves a going-away party, tomorrow, 
Saturday the 29th, at the Chateau in Berkeley, starting at 9 pm and going 
quite late, $3, all are welcome, so come by and help give us a proper bon 
voyage!  Directions are: from SF, take the Bay Bridge and exit at Ashby 
Ave., go up Ashby to Telegraph and make a left, then make a right at 
Parker (at the 7-11), then drive 2 blocks and make a left at Hillegass, 
it's the big white house near the corner, 2545 Hillegass.

Also, just because Whit and I are leaving doesn't mean the Mother Earth 
Sound System will stop throwing parties -- remember Club Freaky on the 
first Friday of each month, and keep an ear out for free outdoor parties!

Well, until we meet again, remember to keep your feet "on-da-ground"!!!


Peace + respect,

scottie & whitsitt

Hello again!

Well, the time has come, and although The Great M.E.S.S. Adventure isn't 
happening _quite_ the way we expected, it _is_ happening -- we're hittin' 
the road!  Unfortunately, not all of our crew is coming along, but myself 
and Whitsitt will be venturing forth in his car, armed with turntables, 
mixer, slide projector, banners, blacklights, and enough records to last 
us across the country and back!  We have no set plans other than 
to see as much of the States and meet and party with as many of you as we 
possibly can.  We're leaving from Southern California around the second 
week of August, heading east thru AZ, NM, and stopping in Austin for a 
while, then after that our direction is undecided.  Ideally, we'd like to 
do as many free outdoor parties as we can, but since our small car 
precluded bringing along much sound gear, we're hoping to meet people 
that can help make it all happen.  But regardless of whether you have a 
sound system or not, we want to meet you and hang out!  Although I hope 
to be able to check my email on the road, it's not certain, so the best 
way for us to get in touch with you is probably by you emailing your 
phone number to our friend Jacob, at DJStonie@aol.com, who can then relay 
it to us.  Emailing it to my account couldn't hurt, either.


We hope to see you soon!!!


Peace + respect,

scottie & whitsitt

An Alta Bates ER doc has a lot more to worry about than you not being able to
sleep. Maybe when you stroll in with some arrythmia he'll give you some more
considered advice. A poor man's speedball doesn't do anything to help
anyone's habit and will more likely do harm in educating this person on how
to mask those pesky symptoms so they can get back to the dancefloor.

Your opinions are quite defensive.

How are you accounting for people who used to do all this and don't anymore?

Well,   whoever set up that New Moon Info number really fucked up BIG TIME.
We were already to head out to join the party,   but when I call the info
number...  I get recording that the mailbox is full,   so no outgoing
message giving the directions.

If anyone putting on these partys use voice mail,    please try and phone
the number to test it out,   or at least purge out any messages.    After
about 10 pm,  that number was totally useless,  so if you guys were wondering
why few people showed up,  thats the reason.

Did anyone go?   How was it?   I really wanted to go....  About 25 of us
were ready to head up there,   all waiting for the number to work again.

No such luck...

Dear All;

	Well I do drugs, and have on & off for a long time, Tried them
all, but there is nothing like getting a massage(straight or high it's up
you); I would strongely suggest that you try it once or even twice; 
straight just to see what it feels like; from a professional practioner,
or a loved one, near you & that you trust. When you bodies producing so
many endomorphes, from all the external stimulation, some people,
including myself, just leave the table; mentally, and also body wise to
some extent. It real neat when you can't feel them touching you anymore,
but they are, you kinda enter into of the coolest altered states I have
ever experience, it's just good stuff for everyone involved. 

	You can always take like 2 pills and then go, I've never given someone
a full body massage yet that was on E, hmmm  would be truely experience.

	Hope to see you at Area 51.

Did anyone check out the lectures going on last night? It was crazy! Some
funky looking costumes!!!! I think it was worth the 20 bucks. Did anyone go
to the after-party, how was it?

What's the deal with the sunset number this week.  The messages is quite 
mysterious.  Is there a new number that gives the real location now that 
the old number was published in the Guardian?  If anyone has any info, 
please e-mail us.

Love,

Alexis, Lydia & Stephan

this is a well-known internet hoax. please don't bother circulating it.
and I'm sure the cookies are as tasty as a microwaved poodle. Actually,
I've heard they're ok --   it's probably a conspiracy by the chocolate
and dairy products board to make you consume mass quantities. as
internet hoaxes go, it could be worse. TOSS THIS COOKIE...

New moon turned out to be a wonderful little party.  It was my first 
time going to one of these events and most certainly won't be my last.  
The people who put this on are very special.  They must have gone 
through a lot of effort to get the system to the location and even  
brought fruit and water for the morning.  The site was beautiful (goat 
rock) and the music was great.  Somehow the dj's new the kind of trip 
we would be on and played accordingly. 

Thanks again to the New Moon crew for bringing music to a cool chill 
spot!

love chris

ps I wish I had gotten crunchman's post b4 I left.  25 more people 
would have only added to the experience.

some things i need to say:
it seems that since i have been in the bay area, the parties i go to
keep getting smaller..and keep getting better.
in the midwest, i usually pay $15 for a "rave".
here the most i have ever paid is 4 (cybertrance waveform via frequency 8, one
great party)

for various reasons, the new moon party on friday/saturday was the best 
party i've ever been to. thanks go out:
thanks to new moon for organizing this
thanks to the dj's (if i'm here for the next one, i'll help!)
thanks to the person who donated the soundsystem
thanks to the person who brought the watermellon :)
thanks to the athorities for not busting us
thanks to the people who showed up for supporting a renegade of this type
thanks to adam for driving me there
thanks to billy for driving me back (carless and loving it?)
thanks to the beach for being so wonderful, great view, soft sand
thanks to every one i met, i didn't meet that was there, and that didn't go
          but sent good thoughts our way.

if you guys need help with anything in the future, i'm here (with two new
 turntables next month! er...new used anyway...)

how did the chateau party in berkeley go, to only person i talked to and went
was totally wasted while he was there and didn't remember anything :(

see ya...where the sun sets and the sand is soft.
i have to go back to missouri on the 12th unless i can get out of it, so if you
see me, come up and say hi cause i may not be back for a while.

sorry i couldn't go to area 51, (too poor), but it looked great and i'm glad
every one had a good time and it was a great concept and if it happens again
i will try to be there!

-rk

oh yeah, thanks for some increadible ambience and trance one last time before
i go back to the land o' house!

Nice story!  Reminds me of a Saturday Night Live skit in which Dan 
Akryod is talking about his book "Mauled", which is the story of how he 
attemtep to feed a Grizzly Bear a marshmellow out of his mouth.  :)

OK, this is minimally rave-related.  There is a 
depiction of a NY club called NASA in the movie 
_Kids_ (I believe this to be the now defunct(?) club 
started by DJ DB.)  The scene is only a few minutes 
long, and is good. The movie, however,is great -- a 
raw, honest, and fucking uncompromising look @ a 
significant portion of today's teenage youth.

ps. this is not a movie about raving.

Dear All;

	It's been a weird one, and it's still blue & fuzzy, but I think
I'll make it. I didn't go to a single party this weekend, yes very rare
fom me, I just wanted to stay home and commune with the boyz Ernesto, &
Archemedes. But a party found me, I think, I'm still tring to decide
whether it was an illusion or not. I never actually got to meet any of
them, more on that later. So could anyone tell me if there was some type
of house party in the Mount Claire District of Oakland, Sunday Monday,
located at the nearest x-street, which is the upper corner of Park Blvd. &
Way & Park Blvd. Thanks :)

     The sun's warm rays that have gently lit the sky this morning is just 
     a teaser to the warmth I've been feeling since last night.  Even with 
     the scuffle towards the end of the party, 111 Minna was great--or 
     perhaps it's because I didn't go out all weekend until Sunday ;) 
     
     Spundae afterwards helped me continue my happy trance journey to where 
     I am right now:  Work!  
     
     I feel like I'm glowing brighter than my monitor and I just wanted to 
     zap you all with my loving embrace that extends beyond the visible 
     light.
     
     I hope you all had a wonderful weekend and I wish you all could ride 
     with me to the ecstatic places I'm cruising right now.
     
     My antennas are up and my signal is strong!
     
     Love,
     Diane

I like the button idea. More durable than a sticker. Though I don't see any
reason why we couldn't do both (make the stickers round and then put them on
the button). 

                                                lots o luv,

I'm still glowing from the area 51 party and am still cruising as well.  
I glowed all day sunday.  The last 3 hours of the party really did it for 
me.  Carlos finished off with a GREAT set that wouldn't let me stop 
danceing.  I feel like the vibe got stronger near the end as everyone's 
energy came together.  After most of us joined hands and listened to a 
song that led us through some kind of group meditation thing the loving 
energy was filling the air all over the place.

_SORRY, NON-RAVE CONTENT_

Tho' I agree that this movie doesn't accurately describe
all or even most of today's kids (can any one movie or 
theory do this?) I've known and been some of these people. 
And unlike on silly shows like 90210, the language and the 
situations are not sugar-coated.  All representational art 
entails a certain degree of artifice. The condensation of 
events to fit a "day in the life" should not be hastily 
rejected as unbelievable or unrealistic.  

Because of the _non-rave content_, let's continue this thread privately.

I can feel your signal coming in load and clear.  Thanks.  There is now an

>From the posts I have seen, it seems like this was a great weekend for
going out (Area 51, etc).  Too bad I had to skip town for the weekend.  I did
manage to enjoy some of the New Moon on Friday night.  What an awsome place.
Thanks to the New Moon crew for a great time.  I had to skip out early to
go on a 2 day kayak trip starting saturday but I kept the vibe alive in my
head (probably helped by some positive energy still flowing from the party).
By the way, how long did it end up running?  I heard that they were trying
to make it all the way to sunday?  I kept replaying the sets spun at
the party for two days on the river through some of the most beautiful
river canyons.  Falling asleep under the stars through a meteor shower is
a pretty incredible sight.   The combination of the NewMoon and the trip
has got me one the biggest highes in a long time.

It sure is Diane!

It wasn't until the sound system was carried, dragged and almost floated
back the 1/2 mile along the beach and we spread out our blankets took off
our clothes and went for a dip in the nipple-hardening, bone chilling water
that we could objectively reflect back on the last 15 hours and ponder
where we came from, where we went, and how the hell we got where we were.
Unfortunately, a number of people never knew (where we were), and that is a
sad thing.  But for those who were fortunate enough to find New Moon, what
they found was a little slice of raver paradise.

This report is not intended to upset those that could not find New Moon,
but rather to try and share the engergy and power of what we did there.
It's not to rub your nose in it, but to help you smell the sand the surf
the sweat and the sounds of a most flavorful weekend.  Here goes:

The drive up there was long, given heavy traffic 11 miles before Petaluma,
and a nice slick fog that found us as we got close to the water on Route 1
near Bodega Bay.  The New Moon party was being held at a location 15-20
minutes North of Bodage Bay at a state beach called Goat Rock.  (Our first
positive omen was that after 30 miles tailing a slow-going car, Denise and
I realized that it was our friends Anne and Jeff from Sacramento that were
ahead of us. :^)  Once into Goat Rock we followed the road down toward the
beach and spent a couple minutes trying to find the parking lot next to the
enormous rock called Goat Rock.  We were lucky.  (Very lucky as it turns
out.)  We had arrived as the New Mooners were starting to carry equipment
down the beach.  I say we were lucky, because at least one car load of
people we know of arrived later and never found the spot.  You see, it's a
1/2 mile along the beach (some say a 1/4 mi., but I think it's further) and
you can neither hear the music from the lot to the spot, nor see much of a
fire.  The good in struggling with all of our stuff that far is that it's a
beautiful, secluded spot where the rangers don't hassle you, (hassle free
for two days!), the negative is that it's hard to find.

We trusted New Moon in finding such a nice place, and labored blindly with
the equipment for in the dark we could only hear how beautiful it was.  The
earth's contribution to repetitive beat music is the crashing surf, no?

Many loads of equipment were carried that night.  The energy started to
build as more people lent hands.  Finally enough equipment was brought out
so that the sound guys (Greg and Jason) could get that part rolling.
Someone started a fire (Morgan?), someone set up a shrine (Bill and Gaby),
someone directed other matters (Ann), we set up our tents; activity
abounded.  The generator started it's 13 1/2 hours of duty and the sound,
our life-blood, came on.  Nice ambient stuff to coincide with the constant
crashing surf.  We continued to settle in.

Things finally calmed down a bit and people trickled in.  At the site they
were erecting a tent over the tables to keep away the mist.  (Same tent,
BTW, that was in the ambient room of the Friends & Family bust party.  For
you trivia hounds.)

About midnight Jeff from Sacramento (aka BIOJeff of Hymns & Anthems) came
on and cranked things up.  Mixing some new with some "hella old" he brought
a good group of us away from the warm glow of the fire to dance in the
sand.  The wind played a bit with the needles once in a while, but part of
the New Moon creed is to bring in harmony the joy of our scene with the
elements and thus a few sliding needles only made for a more raw feel.  As
if the elements kept saying, "Hey, don't forget about us!"  No one was too
upset about a skip or two, accept maybe Phillip (New Moon) who was
recording the whole thing on dat.

Jeff threw down some really great trancy stuff that seemed to clear the
clouds from the sky as well as from our minds.  The stars were plentiful
and bright as Jeff passed the torch to Kelly(?) who, in a really cool and
deadpan presence, kicked ass.  I am not able to tell you exactly what she
was playing, but it was fucking good. (Anyone?  Music details please.)
People danced and chatted and sat by the fire and howled at the moon and
milled about, like a tiny Sunset at night, really.  By 3 am it was topping
out at maybe 60 or so people.

I went to bed in a tent at about 4 or 5.  Slept well with the music
floating around in my head.  Nice ambient stuff played throughout the
morning (DJ with green shimmering hair?) and then this really cool guy came
on and played some excellent house.  His name is Billy Haste and if you
don't have the pleasure of hearing him play, you'd be just as lucky to sit
and laugh with him for a while.  He played for a long time as people packed
up their stuff or slept in the sun or walked about or went swimming.  By
this time the generator had been working 12 hours (and only ran out of gas
once. ;^)

At about 1:30 p.m. or so our beloved life-blood was put to rest and packing
of the equipment commenced.  Rumors were spreading about a group staying at
the beach that night, but the New Moon people had to get the tables back
(thanks Joe!), so once again a handful of people carried all the equipment
back to the cars.  It was worth every back-breaking second I can tell you
that.  Leaving us with water and a nice blessing New Moon (Ann and Greg)
left us on the beach and we saluted them by derobing and running headlong
and screaming into the chilly water.  A tribute to their hard work and warm
hearts.

We stayed there all that night, about ten of us, watching the stars, making
grilled cheese (Rule of life #10: don't ever pass-up an opportunity to eat
a grilled cheese sandwich made by a Scottish woman on the beach. ;^) and
tending the fire. The waves played on, crashing against the giant rocks
along the coast.  We slept the sleep of lovers, friends and family.  Except
of course for me, because I had my face squished against the moist tent.
But alas, my comfort is trivial to the comfort of my family.  Plus,
everyone was so passed out I couldn't wake them to move them.  C'est la
vie.

We enjoyed a nice breakfast and another swim and drove back to The City in
a daze.

Thanks to New Moon, the DJs, and all the people who made it happen.  The
circle is complete.

Sandy and sunburnt,

Tony

P.S.  To those who missed it, I'm sorry for that, but rest assured there
will be others.  Now if only we could get a hand-truck that will work in
the sand...

	Thought I'd jump in on the subject, one thats been a fairly
	big part of my life the last several years.

	Much has been covered already; drugs can be a medium for 
	visting places that are much harder to get to through other 
	means; drugs are not for all; drugs are dangerous; drugs 
	can be pretty expensive (in a lot of ways); drugs are for 
	mugs; drugs make you thin, sext, cool...

	Drugs, for me, were a revelation - after being brought up
	on a Scottish working class diet of alcohol abuse, violence
	and the hard-man image, my first experiences with drugs 
	were eye-opening to say the least. Dabbling in E in
	particular, and just about everything else in general, has
	brought with it a wealth of experience and learning that I
	doubt I would have been blessed with should I have chosen
	not to jump down that path.

	Of course learning isn't always pleasant, and drugs can have
	a way of putting things over in a particularly nasty
	way. The axiom, 'there is no bad trips, only bad trippers',
	may be true but disreagarding its advice too many times, I've
	learned that chemicals can play around with your mind in the
	most unpleasant of ways.

	Drug use has brought me in touch with a lot of truly wonderful
	people (real and immaginary ;') and has also placed me in
	situations I'd rather not have been - the 'Drug culture' is 
	a mix of nirvana and the foul - the money involved brings 
	violence, there's addiction, greed and self-distruction. 

	Some of these things can be seen as personal failings (it could
	never happen to me), maybe they are, but some things have a way 
	of wearing you down.

	To end with something that has been said before, there's no 
	absolutes here - If you want to partake, do so, if you wish 
	to abstain, well...But before condoning or condemming, learn
	about the issues invovled, misinformation on drugs is very
	prevelant in this society - altough people on the list seem 
	much more informed than the GP - and when, if, you do choose
        to sample, or are simply continuing to do so, enjoy - and good 
	luck,

	Still learning,
	Gary

Alright, so everyone on this list could go on and on about the ups and
downs and other directions of drugs=8ABut I would like to just suggest a ver=
y
clear, concise and rather brilliant reference for some insight on the
subject: Aldous Huxley's "The Doors of Perception."

The book is quite short, but a deep provacative read. This puts words to
thoughts and feelings sensed in altered states as well as gives a vivid
description of a mescaline trip for the unexperienced. If you have the
patience, Huxley's brilliant command of the language, though with near
excessive sentences, may give you some clear images for the illumination
that fades too fast.

Give a peek through the doors - you'll be amazed how familiar it all is.

	This was a great party even for the $20 bucks with great visuals, 
great people and great dj's.

Greetings to all,
  I've been trying to download some of the lovely Stuff provided for all of
us from Hyperreal (trippy visuals), Unfortunately all of the ones I've tried
are compressed with 'Compact Pro' and I have 'Stuffit Lite'. Are any of the
downloads provided commpressed with 'Stuffit', or am I being an idiot &
overlooking something?
