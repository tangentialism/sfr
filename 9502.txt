Yeah, Mijos, imagine driving away from a party and chilling in the marina
(east bay) or presidio, and all car stereos tuned to the same rave station.
Open the doors, and de-tweak under the rising sun! Instant, mobile,
accessible, free raves anywhere! 

               Sounds like a sunday morning revolution to me!

Lotsa love,
 Milton and the E-Bee.....

Optimism is a refusal to give up.

Hmm, my previous message hasn't shown up yet...  Tonight(Wed.) you can try
Robert Fripp at Slim's.  Check with Bass to make sure it isn't sold out.
He's a guitarist who has become legendary among progressive and ambient
music fans. Masada, featuring the almost as legendary noisester John Zorn
will be playing Feb 5 at the Stork Club in Oakland. Laurie Anderson is
performing at Zellerbach Hall in Berkeley Feb 15-17.  Frog-S, weird old
school new wave, is playing Feb 5 at Cat's Grill.  Also look for UBZUB, just
plain weird, and dijeradooist(sp?) Stephen Kent or his group Trance Mission. 
I will continue to post non-rave events of interest to sfravers as long as
no one minds.

Someone posted a few daze ago asking about live ambient/trance/noise 
events in the Bay Area(if memory serves...).  I would highly recommend 
Robert Fripp's Soundscapes at Slim's tonite...  Fripp is a guitarist and 
progressive rock pioneer who has worked with Brian Eno and many others.  
He's reached god-like status in ambient circles lately.  If you go (I 
rarely go out on weeknights) you may want to pick up a ticket from BA$$ 
in case it sells out (or to avoid disappointment if it already has).  
I'll try to post more non-rave events of interest to ravers (and people 
who subscribe to this list but don't like being called a raver :-)), if no 
one minds...

Hi All,

Here's the info line message I recorded for friday:

Thank you for calling the Pre-Rave Info Line.  You can skip this
announcement at any time by pressing the # key.

Friday, Feb 3rd, there will be a pre-rave movie before the Kundalini rave.
It's an austrailian double feature of "Ballroom Dancing" and "Priscilla:
Queen Of The Desert."  The location is in Berkeley at the UC Theatre around
6:45 pm.

The UC Theatre is located at 2036 University Ave. The nearest cross street
is Shattuck.  Their phone number is 510.843.6267.  "Priscilla: Queen Of The
Desert" starts showing at 7:30 and "Strictly Ballroom" starts showing at
9:30.  Leave a message if you want a seat saved for you.

Look for me, I'm Purple Tiger.  On me, or near me, will be a flourescent
orange cap that sayz "Wired" on the front.  After I sit down in the theater
I'll hang the cap on the end of the row, but I don't know if it will be on
the left end or the right end.  If all else fails, call the info line and
leave a message, and then wait for me to run up to the phone to answer the
page.

If you get lost or need more directions, call the voice mail with a number I
can reach you at.  The voice mail calls my pager so I can reach you pretty
quickly anytime day or night.

I hope to see you.  If you have suggestions for future events or want to
help me organize new events, please leave a message.

Anyone know anything about this - where to get it, who did it, how to contact
them?  It was reviewed briefly in the JUNGLE issue of XLR8R.  Its one of the
first of its kind and guess what, it was done by a small, independent SF
label and its got music/pics/video from our beloved local scene.  

Enhanced Audio or CD+ is a new CD Audio/CDROM format, essentially a mix of
the two i.e. it plays like  a regular CD in your CD Player but if you  drop
it in a MAc or a PC with a CDROM drive you get lots of cool extra stuff like
video clips, lyrics, whatever.  This has been possible for a while, its the
standard that's new and since its being backed by Sony and Phillips it looks
like it will happen.

The Pre-Rave Movie for Friday night is not this Friday, its next Fri
Feb 10th.

This Friday, I instead suggest that people call the info line and
leave a message if you want to go to dinner around 8:30 in the city.
How does Max's dinner on Lombard sound?

Sorry for the bad info,

I had a lot of fun at Come/Unity.  If any party has managed to
consistantly embody the SF HouseNation vibe, this is it.  It got 
pretty crowded, but just right.  Great overall energy and friendliness, 
comfy chillroom w/Dubtribe and pretty good sets by the DJs.  Like all
CU's I've been to, the party really soared during the last 3 hours.  My 
only gripe is the 4:15 end time.   

Come/Unity is one of those parties where the separation between
party-throwers and party-attendees breaks down.  At various times
I found myself dancing next to to Simon, Garth, Carlos and Tracy.
It really helps the we're-all-in-this-together feeling when some of
the musical shamans are right there beside you.

It think it is also important to occasionally let people in the scene
know that they are appreciated when they do something we like.  So
whether it's giving $5 to a renegade party, or complimenting a DJ on
hir set, or just telling a fellow raver that you like their style; it's 
not so much about feeding egos as much as it's about the recycling of 
positive energy.

It's an awkward problem for the rave/house scene - the ego thing. On one 
hand, big egos cab produce self-centered attitudes and a sense of 
divisiveness.  On the other hand, it seems that some ego is required for 
people to feel that they've got what it takes to organize a party, become 
a DJ, communicate a vision, i.e. help make things happen.  I guess I see 
ego as a tool; what really matters is how you use it.

So I finally got a chance to thank Simon for keeping Come/Unity going 
(he pretty much took over after Malachy's accident 2 year ago).  I also 
congatulated Carlos on the success of Area 51. He tells me that another 
one is being planned, early spring, new location.  

Chatted with Tracy for a little while. She's a little bit "weirded out" 
by the attention her DJing has been getting.  But in a good way.  She 
confessed to now being completely devoted to the art.  Yeah.

Anyway, if you find yourself in need of a "sure thing" party wise, 
Come/Unity on the first Wednesday of every month is still worth
taking a day off from work for. :)

Ack!  I just got back in town on Thursday after being gone for a week,
only to find out Derek had to leave on business for two weeks before
being able to put out a calendar.  Well, here's all I've been able to
gather from last week's list and the one post made this week - if
people have fliers for other parties please post them, and if there
are any more for tomorrow night I'll make an addendum post to the
calendar list.

Both of tonight's non-weeklies look promising musically - Venus will
probably be smaller and low-key.  

Again, let us know if there are more!  Even if they're not for this
weekend, as I'll be doing this next week as well.

	Brian

yeah, did you hear that they just changed the laws about"pirate" 
radio...the fcc has till march to prove somehow that their laws are 
justified, but basically it looks like the huge licensing fees for 
anything over 100? watts will be lowered a lot.  
awesome idea.

The Future of * rave * culture:

1.  No reference to current, or future technologies (will we focus on mUsic)

2.  No debates with "zippies" (they will be extinct)

3.  125 BPM (not faster or slower, a perfect speed:  the go between speed)

4.  It will be very dark and minimal (turn off the fuckin stadium lights)

5.  It will be hot and sweaty (long live the sweatbox)

6.  Techno will be techno, House will be house ( the mixture sounds really
cheezy these days!)

7.  Disco will be disco, Techno will be techno (the mixture sounds really
cheezy these days!)

8.  We will stop Creating new Genres of Techno  every fuckin' time someone
does something new & innovative.  ( what's the latest one?  Deep tribal trip
dance hop jungle?)

9.  We will stop using Kai's Power tools on fliers.  ( A&A sucks big fat
dicks)

10.  We will stop giving props to people who don't deserve it.  (Hardkiss
dorks especially)

11.  Blah Blah blah..

Once again community comes through.  Community has been a party that 
consistantly has high energy and great music.  Last night there were 
times when the oneness of the shared energy made me feel such joy, that 
unfortunately it is beyond what I can describe in this post.  But I have 
a feeling many of you understand what I'm referring  to.  At the raves, 
as with all good raves our communication  is so good there is no need to 
communicate.  There is already a mutual understanding that is shared 
through our "vibe", our dance, our love for the music and one another and 
everything else there up to the point that I don't totally desolve into 
the oneness and beauty of all that there is. Sometimes I feel like  I 
go past that point into the oneness which just happens to include my 
separateness and all other separateness.  When I'm there there is 
incredible beauty in all our separateness, because our separateness 
combined takes us to the incredable beauty of our oneness.  I think an 
easier way of saying all this is there are times at raves when I feel in 
love.

I think it's kind of silly to predict the future of raves, that's imposing an
order on the chaos, which if you study history, has never worked.  What
happens in the future will be a natural evolution.  Maybe we don't want to
dance to music that's as slow as 125 bpm's, ever think of that?

Hyperreal is lagging but I hope you can all get this info in time:  There 
is a party called All Together Now presented by Kinetic.  4152411585.

And for those of you who missed Kundalini you can make up for your error

Theta*Blip, otherwise know as Phillip, the guy who is always handing out
cards for Venus and Aumbient Eight House.  He dresses very uniquely in a
sort of cyber-gothe style suggestive of child like innocense.  He wears at
at least one piece of rubber clothing, for example, a shiny rubber shirt
with 1 inch soft rubber spikes sticking out a 1 inch intervals.  He wears
his hair in black dreds and has an asexual cast to his features.  He spins
real nice, is always friendly, and looks cool too.

I've only had one conversation with Theta*Blip, but its one of
my favorites.  I happened at Nag Champa with my friend Chris.

Theta*Blip: Hi
Chris and Me: Hi
TB: (to me) What's your name?
Me: Purple Tiger
(Theta nods his head indicating appreciation)
TB: (to Chris) What's your name?
Chris: Chris
(Theta looks to me and says:)
TB: Whoa!  Someone sure wimped out in the name department!
(Chris looks hurt, I laugh)
Chris:  (meekly) Well, on the net I spell it "X" "R" "I" "S"

Later on Chris says to me rather indignatly, "Well, I guess I have
to go home and tell my parents they wimped out."

In truth though, Chris wasn't hurt, he was just playing a bit.  Its
an inside joke with me and Chris now, whenever we hear someone's name,
one or the other of us will repeat Theta*Blip's remark.

Hi,

Well, you may remeber me, you may not. I was subscribed to this list a few
months ago, while living in Scotland. After meeting my true love, a native of
the bay area, I emmigrated, and now we're renting a house in Moss Beach,
about twenty miles south of lovely San Francisco.

Before leaving, I collected a few phone numbers, which I promptly forgot in
the move, and so have been cast adrift from any connections since arriving
here in America. Until just now, that is. On a borrowed 386 with a 2400
modem, and an AOL sampler disk, I've managed to get connected (prior attempts
to purchase a machine have been hampered by lack of credit...) 

Things have been great since the move, I'm in love with the area in general,
and San Francisco in particular. Landing a job took a little while, but I'm
now working in Palo Alto, at the top of University.

Its great to be back on-line, as a way to meet people over here, and a chance
to find the choice places for a good night out (my previous attempt at a
night in San Francisco left a lot to be desired. )

Hello to everyone, and I'll look forward to talking, hopefully meeting 
, and partying with some of you here on the list,

Gary

I am asking anyone who can to help me out in assisting a fellow raver. 
Here's the story: After Tribal Funk in November Chuck Raeder and two 
friends of his drove from cow palace to Pleasant hill, Chuck drove Katies 
car to his place and then Katie and Jessica drove on to Martinez.  
Jessica was driving and after having been up all night was very tired. 
She fell asleep at the wheel and crashed the car. Katie was killed.  In 
the hospital they found e in Jessica's blood, although she hadn't done 
any that night. The D.A. is now charging Jessica with manslaughter.  I am 
asking anyone who can to help out with this.  Her lawyer doesn't know 
anything about e, so I have done a literature search on all recent 
journal publications which I am going to give to Chuck. If anyone has 
any legal experience with this sort of thing, help would be greatly 
appreciated. Justice is not being served in this case and help is greatly 
needed.  Katie's family does not hold Jessica responsible and doesn't 
want charges pressed, but the D.A. does.  

Personal mail responses are fine. Thanks to everyone in advance. 

Peace

Andrew Lawson

It was cool... It was him and three of his students from his workshop, and 
they alternated between Fripp doing spacey music with just him and a bunch of 
effects stuff (which was totally cool in quad sound:  he made the tunes spin 
around the room and play off of eachother in the most alarming and fantastic 
ways), and the three students and sometimes Fripp playing beautiful 
acoustic guitar.                                                                        <

At the beginning and the end of the show the four of them came out into 
the audience and played Discipline with variations on un-pickupped acoustic 
guitars (so that we had to be really quiet).  It was beautiful.  However, 
I think that the site, although really good, could have been better in that 
there was constant noise from the staff working there, and it was just a 
little too big.  The only thing was that during Fripp's  last ambient set he 
walked off the stage after a bit, and left all his equpiment going... still 
playing a loop.  It was nice for a bit, but it got boring, and after about 15 
minutes of the same loop, and still no Fripp, the confused crowd started 
applauding.  I should say confused and annoyed.  After a bit, the music faded, 
and then the 3 guys came out and played a song, looked at eachother 
questioningly, and then left the stage.  Everybody applauds anticipating an 
encore.  The crowd applauds for something like ten minutes.  I had given up, 
and started wondering what was going on... Finally fifteen minutes after the 
end of the show, the four of them come out again and do the final number in 
the middle of the crowd.                                                       <
                                                                               <
It was really cool, but what was up at the end.  Very odd.

But music and technology have always been inseparable - technology as 
"how much RAM does your sampler have" may become unimportant, but the 
pursuit of better ways to create music will always be a part of it.

They'll just have a different name. :)

Eh, I know lots of people who think it's way too slow, but this could be 
the beginning of a flame war we've already had... regardless, a wide 
variety of styles and speeds and types of music will continue to exist, 
and this should be seen as a Good Thing.

> 4.  It will be very dark and minimal (turn off the fuckin stadium lights)

Actually I'd prefer to see raves be daytime events, where we can SEE each 
other dancing and having fun and interacting - I can close my bedroom 
door and close off all the lights if I want to be dark and minimal.

Labels will become meaningless in the future (as if they had any real 
meaning now - ha).  Music will be typed by references alone - "this is a 
lot like this other piece, particularly in melody and bassline..."

Dear Andrew;

	With my limited experience in these matters; I can only tell you 
this; It's very important for the victum's family to make there wishes 
known to the DA with regard to them holding or not holding Katie 
responsible. I myself see no justice served if the victum's family; isn't 
interested in pressing charges. There has alrealy been one life lost as a 
result of  a human being making a mistake. I see no point in putting 
someone through the criminal justice sysrtem; who is already no doubt 
feeling extreme distrogte and gulity. Accidents happened; people die; I 
would like to see the trauma minized to all the parties involved. If you 
can provide me with a e-mail address I would be happy to write the DA on 
behalf of Kattie. But again the most important thing is that the victum's 
family speak out and in support of Kattie; both to the judge and the DA.

Well excuse me, but I think not. I've been to the future, and they are all

Since the entire economic system they were fighting collapsed, theyve

Well excuse me, but I think not. I've been to the future, and they are all

Since the entire economic system they were fighting collapsed, theyve

 No lie about the "Should be fun" part! Since I got there early , I
was able to dance on a clean floor with lots of empty room to bop around 
in. Clean , smoke-free air , and great music from Ethan to start the
evening with.

  I had originally planned to go to Kundalini , but Ethan's post made 
me alter my plans - I would stop over for awhile at Venus , then cruise
past Kundalini (which I guess was at Caeser's at 3140 Mission).  

 Well, I almost lost faith in finding Venus! It was behind a humble looking
,well lit bar - the space was actually a restaurant , but with the chairs
and tables cleared away to open up a dance area. ( Unfortunetly , I didn't 
write down the name of the bar or the restaurant  but it's at the corner
of 4th and Bluxome , between Brannan and Townsend ). Access to the
restaurant was through the bar.

 Nice decorations - day-glo starburst mobiles , faux cloth columns that
surprised one with their hollowness , paper pyramids with dayglo flames
and the eye of god(?) on each face . The orange speaker bins with the 
yellow and green horned figures were familier - someone told me they
were from SPAZ. 

 The music coming from the speaker bins was excellent! After Ethan was a
DJ I don't think I've heard before - DJ Theta Bret (??? - Ethan , please 
correct the spelling of this if it's wrong ). He had an great collection
of hard spacey trance , marred only somewhat by the amps being overdriven
a bit. Despite the slight amount of fuzz , I was really getting into
the music. I would stop my dancing and just sit and listen to what was
being played.

 Now , if the party is being held in a venue like a bar or club , where
the proprieters make money via alcohol sales , I usually buy a drink
to keep them happy and to encourage then to have the party again - and,
hey , I like a drink every once and awhile! So , I ordered a screwdriver,
for that healthy orange juice and the relatively clean alcohol. I'm 
telling you folks this , so you know that I wasn't under the influence 
of anything psychedelic ...

 Anyway , after the usual effects of the screwdriver had worn off , I 
notice a nice spacey/tranciness that stayed with me throughout the time
I was there. At one point , I was laying on the floor near the wall 
behind the left speaker stack . As the music from the main stacks and
the DJ's monitors vibrated my head and body , I did some "arm dancing" -
moving my upper limbs to the glorious vibrations all around me. So
nice it was.

 Ethan cleaned up the sound by adjusting the levels during the second 
half of DJ Theta Bret's set. Even better! By this time , a lot more folks
had shown up. I believe the good Capt. Crunch was the second guest to
arrive , and then Video Mike , Chris (? - 1st DJ at the recent Atomic
Dog - damn, I wish I was better at remembering names ! ), and a bunch
of other folks.

 I finally left at about 12:45 , with the party seemingly well in progress.
I cruised past Kundalini , but with no parking space , tired legs ,
and possiblity of a crowded , smokey space, I decided to pass. Anyway , it
would have been another $15. SO , I went to Sparky's , ate , and drove 
back home to Sunnyvale.

 -------------------------------------

 My apologies to all the folks who were expecting me at Kundalini! I hope 
you folks had as much fun as I did!!os

			Venus Report 
			============
			     By
			Cap'n Crunch
				    
I finally got the chance to check out Venus.    I'm amazed totally
with the energy and wonderful venue.   What really surprised me was
that so few people knew about it.    This was it's THIRD week at
this new venue,  and if you're looking for a great place to dance
to the high energy acid trance,   I would recommend you check this
out.   It's got MY seal of approval and it wasn't that smokey,
as long as people wouldn't smoke in front of the fan.

I estimate the venue could easily hold 150 high energy ravers,
with a bar in the front,  and the dance area in the back.

The venue is essentially a cafe,   although there IS a bar,  folks
under 21 are allowed in the back.    The cost is certainly a bargain,

The bartender is really cool,  and loves the energy and the business
it brings to his bar.    When I Asked for a coke,   he only charged
me a $1 for a HUGE class of Cola.

I told him that I would like to see 100 more ravers in here next week,
and he said "Great!".   So check it out,  next time you go out Fridays.

Without giving it's actual location (Call the Info line - 406-2124),   
it is not obvious when you approach this place,   but it is THERE,  
pumping out the most insane Hard Acid Techno Trance,  and a few more 
RAVE buzzwords thrown in for good measure.  :-)

When I arrived,  DJ Theta Blip was spinning the most insane hard acid
trance since Atomicon.    The SPAZ sound system,  although small,  provided
adequate audio energy into my brain.   Although I wasn't frying my brains
out,   I really went to a wonderful trancey state,  hopping around like
an idiot with a huge grin on my face for hours at a time,  or standing
in front of the fa to cool off.   :-)

Alex spun next,   and his music was a lot more varied,  but quite "different"
and certainly danceable.

Ethan finally went on,   at this point,  the BPM's were about 135-140
range,  and he put on the most insane trance I though imaginable...
I just couldn't get off the dance floor.    There was a voice inside
my head that said "Help!!  I'm trapped by this music,  and it won't
let go!",  so was bashed around by this music for what seemed hours
and hours.    Eventually,   the music started to fade,   the bursts
of music shifting between the speakers,   had me chasing the notes
all over the dance floor until they were ALL GONE!!

At that time,  dead silance,  and a reminder from the promoter,   "please
bring more people",  then we can stay longer,  till 6am or later....

So,  it's a mystry which rave I'll go to Sat night...  But without getting
an updated calander,   I'll have to check around wherever it is,  I'll
see you all there... Ready to Zap you with my luv phasers...

Till next time...  
C. Crunch

I would hazard a well-educatd guess that this is Moonbeam of Dubtribe 
Sound System, considering their involvement and support for Come/Unity, 
as well as the fact that she does, indeed, spin ambient music.

Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com

It was another great weekend.  Kicked it off with Kundalini at Cesar's.
Upon entering, I was suprised to find myself being frisked by none other
than an x-roommate of mine, infamous bike messenger Jerme Spew.  He's as
unravey as you can get but a nice guy nevertheless as was the rest of the
security crew, refugees from 924 Gilman St., which is under renovation.
Security was led by Nondo, who has years of experience at Gilman as well as
raves.  Well done, I hope to see him doing more raves as he is retiring from
Gilman.
The room was done up quite well, the spacious room not giving the feeling of
visual overkill that I got at Kundalini's last party at the Troc.  Things
got cooking as a diverse group of people slowly filled the room.  Upstairs
was a chill room filled with happy, friendly people. 
As the crowd focused on the music, all differences were left behind.
Unfortunately, the party had to end at 5 due to hassles with Cesar's. The
music was good but at times didn't flow well, the prime example being when
Spun came on and mellowed things out a bit too early - perhaps an inevitable
result of the early finish.  Galen had preceded him with an eclectic,
energetic set.  Garth closed things out with a typically satisfying set.
After that, I headed out to Milton's Mountain (Twin Peaks) to watch the
sunrise. Quite a few people showed up to wait a few hours in the fog for the
fusion-powered light show by Ra Sol. I got to meet many people there-more
than at most "real" parties.
Saturday, I checked out All Together Now by Kinetic in West Berkeley.
Although plagued with problems, the energy of the crowd put this house party
over the top.  The floor was bouncing with dozens of energetic young ravers,
unfortunately causing the records to skip.  They were able to ameliorate the
problem but it persisted through the night.  It was also quite stuffy
although a few of us were able to get some ventilation in.  Overall this was
the most intense party presented by Kinetic yet.  
I finally got to meet Brian Darkness, and he's really a great guy!  Don't
fear Darkness...
On Sunday, I headed forthwith and without delay (except for the big
explosion in the maze) to Kundalini's party in Golden Gate Park.  Yay!
Finally another party under warm sunshine (sometimes).  DJs were Travis,
Garth and Galen.  I only have to say that it was as good as any other party
there, which is pretty good, but I got an extra oomph of energy due to my
month-long cold being supplanted by Spring Fever!  
It was one of the all-around best weekends ever (though I am sorry I missed
Venus) and I'm looking forward to what looks to be many more incredible
weekends coming up.

DEar Sfraves;

	Lastnight I went to All Together Now with Ptiger. It was a great
party; penty of really friendly people; good music(with the exception of
the record skipping everytime people got zealous on the dance floor). I
really had a great time, no security; $5 cover; good extra cirriualrs(wink
wink). I wish I could find more parties like this. It had a great vibe;
more like a house party than anything else. I met more people there in one
night than I have since I started going to raves here in Cali. It was
really cool; and I feel really good today despite the obivous
non-alcoholic hangover. One note to DJ's everywhere; if the dancers are
making the turntable skip; try one of two things. Move your table as close
to the wall as you can; even if you have your back to the crowd. The floor
moves a lot less close to the wall; for instance I'll use the diving board
as an analogy. If you stand on a diving board where its attached to the
ground and jump up and down; what happens; basically not much; there's
very little if no displacement of the board itself. But stand on the far
edge of the board and jump up and down; and you have a lot of
displacement. Also for about $10.00 worth of hardware you can suspend the
turntables from the ceiling. The second suggestion should be done before
the party starts. Now I know someone's going to say that I'm stating the
obivious; but last nite it wasn't obvious to the DJ's until I suggested
it. But again I will say that even with the skipping it was a great party
and DJ's did a fantastic job. I would recommend another one of their
parties to anyone; well maybe not; I can be selfish sometimes:). Also 
I've never seem so many arractive womyn in one place; I just wish I 
wasn't so terrified of them; hehe.

Getting down and Wicked in San Francisco this weekend
=====================================================

By Cap'n Crunch

Well,   After Venus last night,   I decided to pull another allnighter
(Don't I Always!! :-)

Due to the calander not being updated,   I call Mark from Ameba who
informs me that WICKED was to happen in some warehouse somewhere.
So we stay home,   waiting for the info line to be updated,  and
chill,  listening to DMX,   dancing around.   After about 11 pm,
we call and learn it to be at 1015 Folsom -  Oh!  Goodie,  my 
favorite venue.

We actually didn't get there until about 1:30 am.   When we arrive,
things were really hopping,   with Thomas behind the turntables,
I immediatly headed for the chill zone and started stretching in
preparation for getting down on the dance floor.    I immediatly
wasted no time heading for my favorite dance spot.    Yowsa!!
the energy level was just what I needed...    Hopping around with
this big fat grin on my face.... Yow!!  my face hurts from all the
smiling I was doing. 

Then,  Jeno went on,   and literally tore the place to schreds.   By
about that time,  my mind was certainly out somewhere beyond the
galaxy.    WOW!!  It's getting easier and easier to get into the
"Trance state".    I danced Jeno's entire set before Markie went
on.

When Jeno finished his set,   I wandered around,  schmoozing will
all my friends.    As usual,  the vibe was nothing short of amazing
with this one exception.   There was this black dude about 5 feet
away,  threatening me if I get too close.

After a while,  Markie's music was drawing me towards the dance
floor,   which kept me there until things were over at 7 am.   My My!
how time flies when you're having phun.

After that,  we head back to Mill Valley for the $2 breakfast special
and chill until the Golden Gate Park rave.

This Sunday,   Kundalini is hosting a small rave from 1 - 5 pm at
the BandShell in Golden Gate park.    So we head out there to check
it out.    WOW!!  Galen was spinning when I arrived,   but I only
had 2 hours of dancing,  so my rave report will have to wait until
the music stops.    Galen did a most energetic set,   then when
5 pm came rolling around,   galen faded out what he was playing
into 5 seconds of dead silance,   then started up a slower tune
to finish off the event.    Then,   I fired up the Traveler
(My Powerbook) and started typing the floowing.

-------  Live report from the Bandshell --------------

Hi,   I am live from the bandshell.    Where the most awsome rave
put on by kundalini,   just ended.    Frazer Clark from the Zippies
is sitting here with me,    with a bowl being pssed around.

Frazer  typed the following....

The Summer of Love Part 2 Ambient Rave style began here today. 
The future community waas out with smiles, dncing and conspiring 
together to spread the meme world wide. See you all on the Peace 
Love'n Dance barricades!

---------

So,   this finishes off yet another insane weekend in San Francisco

C.  Crunch - Till next time and please keep the scene alive...

     WOW! Another great Wicked! As the Captain says himself, "As usual,  
     the vibe was nothing short of amazing "... Couldn't have put it better 
     myself. There were even MORE smiles and hugs and just a great sweaty 
     dance feel than the last great Wicked in November!
     
     Although it took a while for 1015 to fill up, MAN, when the Wicked 
     Steamroller started going.... Whooo  hooo! Jeez, I dont think Ive seen 
     so many people there at 7am, even by Wicked standards! It's so hard to 
     go wrong at a Wicked these days... The music, the people, the vibe, 
     etc..
     
     I friggin' danced my head off on the stage, trying to match the beat 
     to my blinky light! It was great to look up onto the second floor 
     balcony and even see a ton of people raving their bums off up there. 
     Definitely inspiring that cult feeling! The Cult Addicted to Techno!
     
     (: Rave on folks, and keep it smiling! :)

I'd like to mention the coffee house at 19th and P in Sacramento.
It is a nice friendly place with ravey vibes and party info.

In preparation for skiing, I was obliged to drink way too much
Pabst Blue Ribbon in a midtown bar - then, of course, I got a bug to
go dancing. 

I was under the impression (from calendar) that there would be djs 
afterhours at this little cafe.  Around 1:30 I found people lounging 
and listening to ambient music.  I approach Tom (owner/raver) and
and ask if anything is going on ...

Tom explains that djs do "show up" usually around 3am and then tells
me about a house party.  He gets on his computer and digs out voicemail
number for Miah's Party (Bring Love!).  Off to a surburban house where
for a $1 there are djs in the living room, ambitious decorations,
a keg out back, and 30 or so people dancing and hanging out.  

It was more than I expected to find (Sacto's Fruit Garden)
but for some reason I was unable to stop talking about Newt Gingrich
and his CIA-like control of TV Guide.

Anyway, I really liked Tom's coffee shop !! 

As per usual, it's hard to leave town and not feel like you missed
something fabulous when reading the weekend posts - especially GG park.
I did get my sunshine body-rock fix on the slopes, though. 

Love Ya
Dave

I'll be spinning ambient on Tracy's KZSU show from 12-3am tonight. It's
Stanford's station, so I imagine the range doesn't extend to the city. I
beleive the frequency is 90.1FM and she does ambient every Mon.

If anyone wants a totally twisted enhanced CD-ROM, you might want to check
out a thing called BlindROM v0.9  It's total hackware, lots of graphics and
music and no directions; when you put it in your CD-Player, you get a few music
tracks that are all a little, uh, different. (Gabber with gregorian chants
layered on top, a techno-funk that uses sounds of someone getting slugged
as percussion...) It comes packaged with a magazine, (or the magazine comes
packaged with a CD-ROM) The magazine would be a back issue now, so contact

KZSU's signal (90.1 FM) can be picked up in some places in
the city, just as I guess I'd estimate it can be received
from the bay on over to the tenderloin, but as you get much
further West there's a mountain in the way and you're out of
luck.  

It does come in up in Berkeley and over in Oakland, however.

You also might be able to get different left-of-the-dial radio stations 
my splitting your TV cable line into your receiver.  They may be on 
different frequencies.

Has anyone found KZSU on Viacom? That would be, huh huh huhuh, K00L!
Any other freakquencies we should check?

Viacom does carry KPOO (89.5FM), which I cannot get where I live (since
another station, KFJC, blocks it out). As tradeoff, KFJC (89.7FM) comes
in pretty well, and is a great station too. I've heard them play some
killer techno, acid jazz, dub, industrial as well as yer standard
kawlich radio fare. 

PS: I'm not sure when they're doing it, but KFJC is going to interview
interview local "Ambient" artist Robert Rich...

PPS: today is Bob Marley's birthday! So burn the chalice and give
thanks and praise! Why yes, thank you, that's Haile Selassie of you!

i also used to be able to pick up KZSU from my car radio as far away as Richmond in the East Bay. . 
. and you can definitely pick it up from the higher elevations in Berkeley [KALX 90.7, on the other 
hand, doesn't go as far] . . . but sorry i missed the broadcast. . .

KZSU's signal (90.1 FM) can be picked up in some places in
the city, just as I guess I'd estimate it can be received
from the bay on over to the tenderloin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

And we know reception in the tenderloin is a *MUST*...

This is the free make-up party Wicked promised for their New Year's Eve
fiasco.  It's being put on in conjunction with the Pure Space folks.

For those of you with Macs and CD Roms, there is an interesting
(mindblowing under the right circumstances) CD ROM called
Head Candy. It's essentially a 5-track Brian Eno ambient set
with killer, full screen graphics. Reasonably powered Mac
required.

There are a set of diffraction grating glasses that come with
the cdrom and boost the field of vision from the monitor to
a 9 x monitor size.

Like so...   ________   where the xx is the original monitor
            |  |  |  |  (I use a 27" Sony television ) and 
            |__|__|__|  the other boxes are color-shifted
            |  |xx|  |  versions of the original image (due
            |__|__|__|  to the diffraction grating.)
            |  |  |  |
            |__|__|__|

A nice trip, to be sure. An alternate way of viewing is to
enjoy your favorite CD's along with your favorite substances.
The graphics tend to sync up with any techno music.

On Sunday the four-headed anti-monster was driving back
from Berkeley heading to the park.  We were listening to
a tape of jungle mixed by Gamahl, and I just have to tell
you, in spite of being almost stuck in the freeway-blew-up
traffic, this music totally cracked me up.


In a good way, I mean.

Instead of trying to kill Bill why not get a few hundred hits of x and 
put it in congress's food/OJ then after they stop telling each other how 
much they really love each other someone propose that we legalize drugs (x 
anyways :) Even if they did'nt it would be fun to watch ;)

yeah, I fully agree with this.  Also, disco-esque techno songs are really 
cool, and I'm sure that there are lots of people out there that love 
Hardkiss( me for instance!!)

I too *strongly* recommend the Head Candy CD. Its Mac only right now but for
you PC folks a version should be out early spring. You need at least a 2X CD
ROM drive. My old drive choked and sputtered trying to get the full screen
video and audio. I upgraded just for this CD and it was well worth it. Don't
expect the latest in interactivity but just kick back and enjoy. Very very
trippy even when totally straight. 

The prism glasses do create the most wonderful mirror images surrounding the
original in the center. Sometimes you see a 3X3 grid but sometimes more like
a 5X5.  The farther away from the monitor you are the more the images spread.
The other images are color shifted but spread out so you sort of see a 3D
image with the coloring a rainbow along the depth. I thought this alone was
too much but then discovered that if you view the monitor up close from the
side that the prism glasses create layers of the original image some inside
the monitor and some projected out front. You can seriously trip on this
stuff. Its almost dangerous :)

Only drawback is that I need headphones. My landlord upstairs complained
about the loud music early in the morning, my favorite viewing time...

It was developed here in SF by ION (south park). They actually did the
imaging first and sent it to Eno who added the music. I first saw it a
MacWorld in the Ambient Lounge area. I talked with the developers who filled
me in on the story, very friendly indeed. (are any on this list?).

You can order extra glasses from ION. This would be a great addition to any
event/gathering in the chill area, and as -mk mentioned the graphics tend to
sync up with any techno music.

Have Mac, will travel.

peace,

You know, at the end of saturday's Wicked around 7am, there was an 
announcement made which had the words "next" , "saturday", "here", "free" 
and I was still trying to pull my ear plugs out and look for my coat and 
I just didn't equate any of it.  

It makes sense now.... wait a minute.... how many people can fit in

I think what Jon Williams said in one of the DJ magazines recently is
true.  Jungle is hard to find in the US, and most of what is available
is crap.  The really terrific stuff is on dub plates (one or at best
a few dozen acetate copies) or on limited releases that are snapped
up in the UK immediately.  Jonah did a terrific ambient-jazz-jungle set
at Nag Champa which really indicates the scope and flexibility of the
jungle format.

It does kind of suck.  It seems so unfair, like those under 21 don't 
exist, because they are not full-fledged loyal consumers.  However, there 
is something nice about a 21 and up party, especially dem Wickeds.  In 
review, from what I've experienced and heard, 21+ parties have more of a 
dance atmosphere.  Everyone seems to coexist a bit easier.  I don't 
know.  It's all just a theory.

Try Venus this Fri evening...   It's at 650 4th st at a cafe,
although it has a bar,   I think people under 21 are allowed.

Actually, the visuals are originally from a video disk, also called
HeadCandy, that was produced by Pacific Arts in LA, a Nesmith Enterprise.
The original music was by Michael Brown. I never heard it or saw this
original version, but the video disk version is probably much better
resolution. I did see the HeadCandy CD-ROM from ION and liked it a lot. I
only borrowed it for a few days, and still need to get my own copy. I saw
that the mail order catalog Dr. Mac has it for $29. Now that I finally have
a VCR, I wish it were a video tape, which would be smoother and better
resolution. There isn't much interaction in it anyway. Video feedback is a
wonderful thing.

peace, light, and reflection

Wed. Feb 8 in the basement of 1015 Folsom: BluePrint

10pm-6am     
$5

Jason Boyd, Covey Black, YT, Crunch (but not the Cap'n)

This is their second party. Their shooting for a permanment deal the second 
Wed of every month.

I went to the one last month and was pleased (if that means anything).
Good people (though not a lot), good energy, and friendly staff.

Last time, they had to shut down at 4am (due to lack of bodies). As usual 
for beginning parties, the more people that show up, the later they can 
stay open.

Love and Respect, 

Jonas

For some reason.. (in my most reasonable, non-judgmental voice:) there seems
to be a greater smile/hug quotient at the over 21s..ESPECIALLY at the
WICKEDS. Of course Wicked seems to bring some of the coolest people just right
outta the woodwork every month.. then u never see 'em again til the next 
WICKED :)

Precedence: bulk

Without any doubt, 95 has dished up some of the hottest parties this side
of the ocean and we are barely two months into it. The afteglow of Sundays
rave in the park is still with me, and I would love to see daytime rave
appearences all summer. Its time that we had our own Summer of Raving and
Loving. If not now, then when? If not us, then whom?

San Francisco is certainly the place that has both the history and the
responsiblity to make good on its promise of its patron saint St Francis to
spread love to all creatures great and small. Comming up, the 50th
anniversary of the signing of the UN Charter in SF -  What a chance to make
a massive impression on all the worlds people, lets create the hugest, most
splendidly exquisite summer of rave this year in SF that will bring smiles
to not only us ravers but to the all citizens as well. The birth of the
dawn of a new age begins on the left coast of America. And we are here.

We have the best communications system any rave nation could possess, the
raddest sound systems, and enough commitment to make good on any promise.
Wow did I say that?

	Remember that little party called Megatripolis a few months 
back?  Where did it go and when can we expect the return of goa gil back 
to the bay.  I'm desperately seeking a substitute for the drive he 
induced in me (unassisted by our littl(e) friend I might add) through his 
fast unyielding crescendoing tempo of body buzzing spinning. I guess I'll 
just have to find an alternative source of mind milk by going to the free 
Wicked party this Saturday.  If you haven't already heard, multi-color 
headed John will come your way to satisfy the new craving for fresh mixes 
and a unyielding style that will burn the soles off your shoes yet 
leaving an abundance of sole in your heart to take you all the way to the

Hi Chris!

we are a few people working (and living) in the diffrent fields
of nightlife and dance-culture from Frankfurt, Germany.
Our various appearence include DJ ing - Clubs and Bars -, writing
(journalism) about music and events for diffrent papers/magazines,
graphic designgs, etc.

Our latest project is now almost finished, the book about 
Techno Culture: 'Techno Style' and it would be great
if you could help us with some infos to be included in it.
This project has grown bigger and bigger over the past months.
We think that now every important/interesting label is included and
we are almost proud, that Karl Bartos of KRAFTWERK will contibute
the foreword. 

The book will have a huge impact on everyone in the scene: Musicians, DJs,
Graphic Designers, Ravers, Photographers, etc... . For the purpose of 
information for the global community we like to include an appendix
with the best Clubs, the most important Record stores, Pirate (or other) 
Radiostations, www pages, etc. .

Could you help? We need your list for your local area or for any city
you know of. I personally think it is very important to have these infos
from around the world. We would like to have included: Name, adress, best
days + opening hours (Clubs) but if you only have one of these things it 
will do.

Thanks for your help

Hello all,

I realize some of you don't appreciate non-rave material here, but this is
important enough that it could directly affect your online existence, and
since the online community here is important to the "offline" rave scene,
I deem this important enough to send to you.  Please contact your local
and more importantly federal representatives and let them know how you
feel.  It would be terrible to suppress expression as this bill is very
likely to do it it passes.  Also, pass it on to others who would like more
specific information.  This was retrieved from the woman whose email address
was at the bottom of the note from Chris Beaumont... later...

Dear Jack,

      As am I appalled!  Thank you for your concern.  At this point we are
suggesting that anyone and everyone (1) publicize the bill and its potential
ramifications and (2) innundate the Senate (& House) with letters, e-mail
messages, and phone calls to voice opposition and educate them on this issue.
   Following is a detailed analysis prepared by EMA's legal counsel that
specifies the consequences of such a terrible law. Thanks again!

                                     ANALYSIS

         S.314, The Communications Decency Act of 1995
                     Introduced by Sen. Jim Exon (D.-NE)

                                 Prepared for the
                  ELECTRONIC MESSAGING ASSOCIATION
                                            by
                    James T. Bruce and Richard T. Pfohl
                               Wiley, Rein & Fielding

                                   February 7, 1995




I.     Summary

     On February 2, Sen. Jim Exon (D-NE) introduced S. 314, The
Communications Decency Act of 1995.  Sen. Exon's bill, which contains
provisions intended to curtail transmission of obscene, indecent, or
harassing telecommunications, is identical to an amendment to the Senate
telecommunications deregulation legislation which died last fall with the
conclusion of the 103rd Congress.  Although ostensibly extending existing
federal prohibitions on obscene or harassing telephone calls to other
telecommunications devices, these provisions could greatly expand prohibited
conduct and would potentially make employers, service providers, and carriers
liable for transmission of restricted communications.  The likelihood of
passage of the telecommunications deregulation legislation in the current
Congress and the likelihood that Sen. Exon will attempt to again attach his
language to such a vehicle makes the potential passage of the Exon language
quite plausible.

II.     Analysis

     Sen. Exon's interest in the issues addressed in S. 314 was reportedly
spurred by reports of electronic stalking on the Internet.  Sen. Exon stated
upon introduction of the legislation on February 2, "I want to keep the
Information Superhighway from resembling a red light district.  This
legislation will help stop those who electronically cruise the digital
universe to engage children in inappropriate communications . . . or
electronically stalk users of computer networks."  The Exon bill would
address obscenity on radio and cable television, but of particular interest
to EMA members are Section 2, on obscene or harassing use of
telecommunications facilities, and Section 5, which extends the Electronic
Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) to include digital communications.

     According to Sen. Exon's introductory statement, his legislation is
intended to "extend and strengthen" the anti-harassment, decency, and
anti-obscenity restrictions on telephone calls in current law to all
telecommunications devices.  The Exon bill would not, however, simply apply
existing law to new telecommunications devices.

     Because of differences between existing telephone technology and
telecommunications technology such as electronic messaging, the Exon bill
would potentially prohibit a wide array of currently allowed electronic
communications.  Furthermore, the Exon bill would broaden existing law by
subjecting transmitters, as well as the individuals who send obscene or
harassing communications, to criminal liability.

     A. Restrictions on Nonconsensual Indecency and
       Harassment

     Current law, as codified in Sec. 223(a) of the Communications Act of
1934, prohibits any "obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent"
communications by telephone.0  (Communications Act of 1934, Sec. 223(a) (47
U.S.C. 223(a))).  Sec. 223(a) also prohibits intentional harassment by
telephone, including by anonymous calls, repeated hang-ups, or repeated
harassing calls.  (47 U.S.C. 223(a)(1)(A - D)).  Finally, Sec. 223(a)(2)
prohibits knowingly permitting a telephone facility under one's control to be
used for such purposes.  The courts have interpreted Sec. 223(a) narrowly to
apply only to non-consensual or unsolicited telephone calls.

     The Exon bill would make two fundamental changes in existing Sec.
223(a), with potentially wide-ranging, and possibly unintended, consequences.
 First, the Exon bill expands the prohibitions on obscene or indecent or
harassing telephone calls to communication by all telecommunications devices.
 Second, the Exon bill extends the prohibition against making obscene or
indecent communications to "transmit[ting] or otherwise mak[ing] available"
any such communication.  (S. 314 Sec. 2(a) (emphasis added)).  In addition,
the Exon bill would raise the penalty for such violations from the current up
to $50,000 or six months in prison, to up to $100,000 or two years in prison.
 (S. 314 Sec. 2(b)).

     The Exon bill provisions would have a number of consequences for
electronic messaging.  First, unless the court-created limitation on the
scope of the Sec. 223(a) anti-obscenity and indecency provisions to
nonconsensual telephone calls is applied as well to all telecommunications,
the provision would prohibit all "obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, or
indecent" telecommunications, whether or not consensual.  Services or
carriers that transmit "or otherwise make[] available" such communications
would be liable.  Thus, the amended Communications Act would, on its face,
prohibit indecent communications between consenting adults.  This provision,
unless limited to nonconsensual communications as the courts have done with
regard to the existing prohibition on such telephone calls, is most likely
unconstitutional. Nevertheless, the legislative history of this provision
should clarify that the amended language is intended to apply only to
nonconsensual communications.1

     Second, the Exon bill restricts anyone from transmitting, "or otherwise
mak[ing] available," "obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent"
communications. (S. 314 Sec. 2(a)(1)(B)).  This goes beyond and is in
addition to the existing prohibition on knowingly permitting a telephone
facility under one's control to be used for purposes prohibited by Sec.
223(a).  The Exon bill expands the prohibition on knowing use of telephone
facilities to knowing use of telecommunications facilities.  (S. 314 Sec.
2(a)(2)).  The latter provision may prove troublesome if service providers
are deemed to "know" about the use of Bulletin Boards for or Electronic Mail
for harassment or indecent remarks.

     These provisions could have a chilling effect on electronic message
services, providers, carriers, or anyone else who could be deemed to
"transmit[] or otherwise make[] available" prohibited electronic
communications.  Thus, for example, if someone sent an indecent electronic
comment from a workstation, the employer, the e-mail service provider, and
the carrier could all potentially be held liable, and subject to up to
$100,000 in fines or up to 2 years in prison.  This provision also has
potentially chilling effects on electronic bulletin boards, discussion
groups, and basic electronic mail communications.  Although some service
providers regularly screen bulletin boards to ensure that no obscene or
indecent remarks appear upon them, the incredible proliferation of such
bulletin boards makes comprehensive screening practically impossible.2
Bulletin Boards on the Internet, and, potentially, electronic messages,
include numerous postings making racist remarks, arguing that the Holocaust
never occurred, etc.  All of these could conceivably be considered
"indecent," or annoying, abusive or harassing, any of which could subject
employers, services, and carriers to liability.

     It is questionable whether the prohibition on obscene or indecent
communications, even if limited to nonconsensual communications, can be
accomplished in electronic communications without chilling the First
Amendment. Electronic bulletin boards and discussion groups blur the concept
of intent:  anyone perusing bulletin boards or discussion groups on the
Internet has the potential to stumble, as if accidently stumbling into an
X-rated movie theater, upon indecent material.3  Such an encounter may not be
"consensual."  The Internet practice of "flaming" fellow users very
frequently involves use of indecency.  Any such flame, which is by definition
nonconsensual,4 would subject anyone who "makes available" the communication
(again, potentially including an employer, service provider, common carrier,
etc.) to full liability under this section.

     B. Restrictions on Commercial Obscenity

     The Exon bill would amend current law which is intended to restrict
consensual obscene or indecent telephone calls, such as dial-a-porn.  Current
law prohibits use of the telephone to make obscene communications for
commercial purposes, regardless of whether the maker of such communications
placed the call (i.e., regardless of consent). (47 U.S.C. 223(b)(1)).
Current law also prohibits making indecent communications available to
persons under age 18. (47 U.S.C. 223(b)(2)).  Current law allows common
carriers to avoid liability under the provision limiting indecent material to
persons over 18 by complying with F.C.C. rules5and by offering subscribers
the right to block access to indecent material.  The Exon bill would extend
these prohibitions to all telecommunications.  (S. 314 Sec. 2(a)(3)).

     By simply applying existing telephone provisions to telecommunications,
the Exon bill would again create problems due to the unique nature of
non-telephone telecommunications. For example, may a service or provider be
liable if it does not check the ages of all members of a household, and allow
a family to block access to members under the age of 18? Numerous electronic
bulletin boards on line contain indecent material,6 and indecent material may
spring up in any discussion group, or even when a rap artist discusses his
lyrics, or a record company puts a new release on line, as has been done in
recent months.  Because subscribers are required to pay a commercial fee
(beyond their basic subscription fee, which would presumably be analogous to
a telephone common carrier fee) to access these services, indecent material
on these services may subject providers to liability.7

     C. Expansion of ECPA

     The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA), codified in the U.S.
Code at Title 18, generally prohibits unauthorized electronic surveillance,
such as wiretapping of employees.  (18 U.S.C. 2511.  See Alderman v. U.S.,
394 U.S. 165 (1969)).  The Exon bill would add conforming language which
amends the prohibition on surveillance to ensure that it covers all
electronic communications, including digital communications.  (S. 314 Sec.
5).

     ECPA has been amended before to account for the evolution of technology.
 When passed in 1968, ECPA prohibited surveillance only of wire or oral
communications. ECPA was amended in 1986 to prohibit as well surveillance of
electronic communications.  Sec. 5 of S. 314 would ensure that all electronic
communications, including digital communications, are covered.

III.     Status

     The Exon language is substantively identical to the amendment to S.
1822, Senate telecommunications deregulation legislation in the last
congress.  It is anticipated that Sen. Exon will again offer his language as
an amendment to telecommunications deregulation legislation which is expected
to be introduced by mid-February.  Sen. Pressler, Chairman of the Senate
Commerce Committee, has indicated his eagerness to address the legislation.
Sen. Exon is a member of the Senate Commerce Committee.

IV.     Prognosis

     Last year, Sen. Exon's language was adopted as an amendment to the
telecommunications deregulation legislation even though many thought it
hastily drafted and poorly thought out.  Nevertheless, this language could be
adopted as part of the telecommunications bill in a matter of weeks or
potentially added to any legislation pending on the Senate floor.

     A coalition of groups assembled last fall to address the threat to
online services created by the Exon provisions. The coalition included
representatives of the ACLU, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF),
America Online, Prodigy, ANS, CompuServe, and the Interactive Services
Association.

     The will of Senators to oppose such "morality" legislation, regardless
of how technically flawed, is always in short supply; in the more
conservative atmosphere of the 104th Congress, such legislation stands an
even greater chance of passage.



ENDNOTES

0     Courts have not defined precisely what constitutes indecency, although
they have held that mere offensiveness is insufficient.
1     Sec. 7 of Sen. Exon's bill, which requires that cable channels
"unsuitable for children" be fully scrambled for nonsubscribers, suggests
that he does not intend to prohibit indecent, non-obscene, consensual
communications. Sec. 7 does not prohibit such "indecent" programming as the
Playboy Channel, but merely ensures that it will be limited to consenting
adults.
2     This problem is compounded by the indefiniteness of the definition of
indecency.
3     The proliferation of such material on the Internet is evident in the
proliferation of bulletin boards devoted solely to sexual topics.  According
to a newsgroup list compiled by Digital Equipment Corp., the most popular
bulletin board on the Internet, after a bulletin board providing rules for
new users, is alt.sex.stories, which half a million Internet users log on to
each month.  The next most popular category is alt.binaries.pictures.erotica,
followed by the alt.sex discussion group.
4     One could argue, however, that the practices of logging on to the
Internet or entering a discussion group or bulletin board, constitutes
"consent," or waiver of the right to object, to whatever communications may
ensue.  The unresolved issue of consent demonstrates the difficulty of simply
applying existing obscenity or anti-harassment law governing telephones to
all telecommunications.
5     For example, F.C.C. rules require that companies require a credit card
for provision of services.
6     See supra note 4.
7     Although it might be argued that the basic subscription fee of on-line
services is analogous to a telephone common carrier fee, in this case the
carrier (the service provider) is providing both the basic communications and
the information services (i.e., the Bulletin Board). Thus the electronic
telecommunications carrier is analogous to both the telephone company and the
dial-a-porn operator for enforcement purposes.

Dear Ms. Reardon,

I am appalled at the prospect that this law could actually be
passed (S314), what can I do to help prevent that possibility?

Thank you very much,

Hi folx,

Bryce asked me to forward a posting of mine to your list.  Here goes....

From: Glenn Fajardo (Starwave)
To: owner-nw-raves; nw-raves
Subject: Options Galore (was: c-u-c-me (where?) and More!!!)
Date: Wednesday, February 08, 1995 2:04PM
Priority: High

Options, Options, Options and the need to COMMUNICATE to people that options 
are available to them is exactly the point that I've been trying to make. 
 Everything that I've been involved with from the first NW FMR the previous 
year to the Choc-Lit Factory to Earthspace has been about trying to 
communicate to people that options are available to them.  What's that? 
 You're tired paying $20 to $30 at the door for vibe-less non creative 
parties?  Tired of super hyped flyers promising everything in the universe 
and leaving you nothing but a hole in your pocket?  Tired of having 
travelled 3 to 4 hours to a party you've been anxiously waiting for the last 
3 months  only to arrive at the party as it's getting busted?  Well... what 
options do we have?  Are we just totally left to rely on the winds of 
fortune and the "good" graces of shallow and superficial promoters?  Do we 
just say "fuck it, the police and the city just don't give shit about us 
"kids"?  But wait!  Wait a minute!  We have OPTIONS, don't we??  Well, let's 
see.  We can:

1. COMMUNICATE- Initiate dialogues with promoters  to help them look at 
OPTIONS for throwing cheaper (for everyone) parties. Just making the effort 
to communicate gets your ideas out there as an option.  If the promoters are 
not receptive, you also have the option to do it yourself. Communicate to 
the promoters, the governing bodies, other people including yourself, that 
you have other options and that you have the ability to seek out and create 
other options.

2. CREATE-Everyone has the ability,( or should I say option?) to create  and 
cultivate the avenues by which we can focus and channel the energies that 
nurture us and allow us to survive.  If you consider dance and music to be 
one of the manifestations of those energies, would it not be worth it to 
create and cultivate an environment that would be conducive to experiencing 
it?  I've yet to see voter registration booths and truly informative kiosks 
on a consistent basis at any of the events I've attended.  I think that it 
can only help to provide those kinds of things at parties.  If the promoters 
won't provide them, we all have the option setting them up ourselves.

3. EXTEND-Push those envelopes, kidz!!!  Look within and behold the wonders 
inherent in each of us.  We are all reflections of the universe around us. 
 Look beyond the patterns that you've been conditioned/programmed to follow. 
 Create your own patterns, extend and enhance the knowledge within you by 
learning as much as you can and then sharing the knowledge that you do have 
with other people.  Sharing knowledge is one of the most gratifying ways of 
giving to others that I have experienced.

I guess my point is we should EXPLORE the possibilities and options 
available to us.  Provide possibilities and options for other people such as 
having a low-tech AND high-tech information medium.  Imagine the 
possibilities...  but, I digress.

Peace y'all

Tigger

Hello all...
I haven't been following the list as much lately so I'm not sure if 
these parties have gotten any mention before...
For the last couple of months in Santa Cruz we have had almost weekly 
parties in an old train station that was once converted into a 
restaurant, then to a nightclub then it sat empty for a year or so. 
Much Santa Cruz talent has been coming together for these parties- 
dj's Tom, Wool, Eric, Drew, Jason Hartley and myself(Christian)... 
computer visuals are often provided by Craig Larson...  
a really nice sound system by Randy Cone... and Andrew has been 
organizing and dealing with the business aspects... he has put in 
loads of time and hard work into this place.
There's been high energy, pumping and jumping turnouts each time that 
we all have come together. 

This friday (the 10th) it will be goin on... dj's Grame(La Paix) and 
Mars will be joining us, along with Eric and myself...  
I've never heard Mars spin before but word is that he spins hardcore!  
It starts around 11:00 pm and goes all night. $5 before 12, $7 after 
12 or $5 with flyer.  The voice mail number is 408.457.4955.

Love to have you all there!

James

Politely say "no" when someone offers you a quarter pounder with cheese.

WHY?

Because it takes 16 pounds of grain to make one pound of beef.  It only 
takes one pound of grain to produce one pound of bread.  So just remember 
how much of our resources you are helping waste every time you bite down 
on one of those greasy surprises.  btw, that doesn't begin to touch on 
the subject of all the toxic waste (cow shit) all those extra cows create 
for our rivers and lakes and other important waterways.  Think also of 
all  the people starving in Latin America becaus all of their land is 
being used to feed countries like ours beef that they cannot even afford 
to buy. 

well, gotta go, i'm off to cattleman's for a nice juicy one...

Well,  

It looks like the Cap'n will be leaving on 2nd Mar for Sydney,  to explore
the Australian rave scene and meet as many AusRavers as possible.
I guess I would call this a "Rave safari". 

I expect to take my flyer collection and do some serious trading,  as
well as trading tapes.

What would be Neat,   is for as many SFRavers to see me off on the
2nd of March.    My flight leaves at 7 pm,   and because it's an
international flight,   I have to get there by about 5 pm.

I know a lot of people will probably be working at that time,   but
perhaps a few of you SFRavers may want to have a small "Get together"
either in the afternoon,   or at the gate in the airport.    Or some
other arrangement by suggestion from the other SFRavers.   I think my
departure is on Thursday evening.

I will be met in Sydney by a delegation of AusRavers,   at which time
a picnic is planned,   then the Gay Day Mardi Gras parade that evening,
then on to Field of Dreams,  a big huge massive held at some sports
stadium.

Naturally,  I'll have internet access,   and plan to be putting out
reports on the rave scene over there.    While in Oz,   I'll still
be continuing with my job,   so I'll be earning $$ while over there.

Anyway,   I have left an open return,   and plan to stay between 1 to
3 months.

So,   don't know if I'll attend Wicked this weekend,   as I wanted
to check out Ravers In Wonderland.    I suspect that Wicked will be
very crowded,  as I am told it's the New Years Makeup party,  and
will be free.

Later...
C. Crunch

Oops! That's what I get for assuming. BluePrint will be 21+ (as per usual 
for 1015). Sorry for the confusion.

When will they realize that the more money and laws they throw at the

it's very hard to fight guerilla warfare or corruption. Whoever wins,
everyone loses. Oh, and what ever happened to the constitution?

hey all,
 know that this post is late and all but just wanted to say that Kundalini
was much fun last friday.  i havent had more fun dancing in a bit and the
lighting setup that they had going was much cool, esp the lasers off the
mirrors across the room which caused them to go all over the place. 
	the only think that sucked for me was that at one point in the
night i overextended myself and felt a bit woozy. that was the first time
something like that ever happened to me since i started going to parties
2+ years ago and it scared and bummed me cause i really wanted to dance. 
  	oh well at least i got to finish the night with garth which was cool. 
the trip up to Twin Peaks was also much fun, and dancing and watching the
sun rise through the fog was rather beautiful :)

god, i love raves :)

hey all,


   well i went back east between mid-Dec and mid-Jan  and was going to
post to you about the parties I checked out there and all  but i never 
got around to it.  Anyways i realized a few days ago why not just post 
the reviews of the parties i wrote for ne-raves earlier?  So here they 
are.  I hope it sheds some light on the e-coast scene for ya sfravers.

   Just for story-telling sakes,  my family lives in Hartford CT and i 
grew up there but i went to school in Washington DC for two years (92-94) 
and most of the raves i went to were either Baltimore or DC parties.

peace

DEC 17, 1994 -  GRAND,  Baltimore, MD

________________________________________________________________________

hey everyone,

    wanted to post and say thanks to u'world and everyone for Grand this past
weekend.  had a very good time..

    being away from DC/Balt and in SF i was itching to check out an party
again.  I got the train down from Hartford and made it into Baltimore in
the afternoon and hung out with Mikey Yang who was the man all weekend!
Thanks for everything mike!
    We made it to the pre-party at Ron;s house around 10 pm and chilled till
about 11:30 waiting for hossam ;)  but it was cool and got to meet a lot
of people incl. Mark (pflagging) whom id seen his posts and was finally glad
to meet him in person.  so around 11:30 we made it to the Paradox and waited
for the bus. luckily we saw mike & jen and dan and alan and everyone.  it
was so good to see all the old skool cats in effect!! :)
    so after all squeezing onto the bus i sat near this guy eric who had
spun at the first sunshine party and it was cool to catch up. when we got
to the party and got in things were crowded.  A bit too crowded, but it
got better as the night went on.  The chill out room was a little too dark
for my taste, but i guess there are reasons for that ;)
  the main room was hot, which i didnt mind cause when everyone is dancing
in a hot sweaty room it definately does wonders for the vibe  :D
   i danced for awhile but wanted to go around and see old friends and meet
new people so ended up chilling out a lot and walking around handing out
blow-pops left and right and giving hugs to anyone.
    there was this one girl i met during the night that i freaked out.
she looked like this other girl that was looking for some buds. so i went
up to her and was like:
    "hey, were you looking for buds earlier?"
    "no"
    "whats your name?"
    "why?"
    "you wouldnt like a blow pop would you?"
    "no"
    "cool. later"  :) hehehehe

    most people wern't afraid when i said hello.  met this really cool
kid from Baltimore who does the lights at Rise, and this other cool kid
from Philly who helps throw underground parties.
    it was also fun to see this other kid eric from Baltimore, who i had
meet two weeks earlier in San Francisco. cross-country connection!! :)
(The Pacific - Break-in party in Dec)


    the best part for me vibe wise was i beleive dj sun who was spinning
all these slamming old hard trance tracks from about two years ago.  i was
getting into it for awhile and then all the sudden the vibe swept me over
and i just busted out dancing the hardest that i have in awhile!! it was
so much fun  :)  i was just jumping up and down and yelling out in all the
breaks!! What is up with all of you baltimore people anyways, you gotz
to be more vocal when your all dancing.  I felt for a long time like i
was the only person yelling. Believe me its a lot of fun :)
   the lights in the main room were really well done.  i cant say enough
about the light behind the dj and the cat that was standing in front of it
hands in the air pumping shit up!  at one break in this really incredible
song i was just jumping up and down hands in the air and the guy in the front
was urging everyone to get them hands up it was like a real vibe connection
ya know :)

  so even though i didnt dance all night (just getting to old;) the vibe was
really cool and the people there very nice.  it was another quality
u-world event!

  the only low points about the night were the fight that broke out.  A
lot of people were really bummed out about it, and the pushers who were
dealing those fucked up drugs.  this one guy came up to me and asked:

"Hey you want some crystal-meth?"
"No."
"How about some cocaine?"
"No thanks.  I dont do that shit."

now  i ask you,  what is up with shit like that in the scene?

oh well.

WED DEC 28, 1994 - JUNGLE SKY

______________________________________________________________________

 just wanted to post a little review about the jungle sky premire
party at the cooler in NYC Wed. night.  What can i saw but im now
a Jungle Head! :)

 All the DJs kicked some serious booty but the best for me were Soul
Slinger and the dj after him.  I have not seen a crowd so into the
music in awhile.  I mean just glancing around everyone who was dancing
had this complete concentration showing in their faces on their dancing
and the music. I love to see that.
 The only thing i didnt like about the night was this one kid tried
to battle dance me at one point.  At first he wanted to dance in the
area i was dancing in, but i wasn;t about to give it up.  then he
started stepping on my feet and bumping into me.  I busted some steps out
for him and basically didnt give up my space but he kept trying, like
hooking his arm around mine, so i just moved away and he ended it all
with a shake.  I still dont like the shit tho.

So definately a good night.  OK crowd and got to finally sit and
talk with Kenny Eng,  who i danced with and 50 other people  on 2nd and
Bowery on New Years 92/93 after the party that night was busted.

   Lets just say im JUST as hyped about HEAVEN as i was about that
New Year's Eve.  All i know is that i have to last for the Afterhours
and the 4 hours of Dante!!! :)

DECEMBER 31, 1994 - Heavan

_____________________________________________________________________
Hey all, well here's what happened to me on NYE:

   In a way very similar to two years ago, but in many ways different.

   Left around 4 pm with my brother Kreig to pick up grandaddy raver
PJ (okay he's 22) and another friend of Kreig's Naomi.  We made it
to outside NYC and picked up another cool cat, Nat, and then to
the West Side Apt. of Another guy Rene, and dinner and meeting some more
friends of Kreig from Wesleyan.  After dinner and a discussion about the
city, Nat, Kreig, PJ and I made our way via the Subway to Heavan in
Queens.
   At the last transfer station there were several ravers i met
heading to the party who were nice.  We got to the stop and walked the
several blocks to the party, all the time seeing handfuls of people
walkingback to the subway asking for extra tickets.  The wait in line
was about 45 minutes.  Everyone was waiting at one door until Alan S.
walked by and told the crowd there were 2 other doors on the side
which a mad rush ensued.  We made it to one of the doors and things
were moving quickly until "Paul Paul's" busses arrived and all the
bus people got to go ahead of all of ther people waiting in line.
   Finally pushing my way inside and the quick bag check we went
inside the main dance room for a few minutes but it was way to
crowded for my taste.  We ended up hanging in the lighted chill
out area talking to people and meeting this friendly girl from
"CONNECTICUT!" :) and watching the action this kid told me about
the upstairs and the Jungle room.  We made it up the stairs
and into the jungle room which was not filled and offered a lot
of room to groove.  People were dancing, and although i was not
into the vibe just yet, i knew that in a few hours i would be
bugging out when the crowd had thinned a bit.  However just before
2, the lights came on upstairs and the music stopped and people told
us the party was over.  I hung with Kreig and PJ for a bit upstairs
pissed that i hadn't handed out the hundred Blow Pops i bought when
kreig suggested id hand them out then. Duh! :)
  After getting threatened to be arrested if not getting downstairs,
i proceeded to walk around through the crowd handing out blowpops.
I couldn't believe the response i got from a lot of people.  These
HUGE thank you's like i had saved someone's life :) met some nice
people and got a joke telling someone i had come all the way from
San Francisco for the party :) (there were other reasons besides
Heaven also).  I was also offered a smoke by several people which
was rather nice ;)  Kreig and I spent a while talking to this guy
with a microphone for a film crew and talking about the rave scene
while we had fun joking about it all. Eventually a little after 3:30
am we were kicked out of the warehouse.  We mannaged to stay at the
end of the people being kicked out and walked a block away from the
warehouse where for about 20 minutes it was a complete Deja-Vu of
New Years Eve 2 years ago.

   2 years ago Scotto's party was busted and about 100 people spent
the rest of the night at the map point on the corner of 2nd and
Bowery dancing the night away to Evan and Mars music pumping from the
white van.

   This time a car was pumping some music on a street corner
but it wasn;t that loud. For about 200 hundred kids it didnt matter
as they started bugging out to the music.  I had fun reminicing about
how similar this was to two years ago and kept yelling "Where's the
White Van?  Where is Mars?" hehehe :)  The cops nearby blew their horn
really loud but all this did was get the whole crowd whooping and
chanting.  This one kid went dancing around and yelling "They told us to
keep dancing!!" which i thought was worth a big hug :)  However unlike
two years ago the cops decided to be assholes and to not let us dance
and eventually was able to scare and intimidate everyone away, but
not after taking some well earned verbal abuse from some ravers.
   We walked to the subway station and met up with everyone else
we had been hanging with us earlier at Rene's west side apartment.
We all took the subway back to his apartment and chilled, cracked jokes
and had a good time.  However, Nat, Kreig, and this girl named Carrie
and i decided we really wanted to dance and around 7am headed out to
Caffeine on Long Island.
   When we got to Caffeine, they were still charging twenty dollars,
so after hanging in the parking lot for a half-hour we decided to go
back to the city and walk around, esp. cause at this time carrie and i
were a little too happ-e to want to chill;)
   So we headed back to the LIE and picked up a poor raver who
we freaked out by talking to a little too intently and got back
to NYC where we walked around and had some really intense and good
conversations going on.  Luckily it was a beautiful and sunny
morning and really cool to chill out upon.  Things ended and we
made it back to Rene's apartment for a bit of sleep and then a
ride back to Hartford.

  So even though Heavan was busted, and was probably going to be
one of the most intense rave experiences i had ever known (there
was just this feeling like it was going to be) New Years Eve
once again proved to be one of the funest nights of my life and
makes me rather glad i found out about raves and its being a big
part of my life all this time.

Net-Ravers saw: Jason, Hossam, Chris-bee, R-plan, Justin (dancing
to his own drummer:), Johnny, and Brian from Texas i think, and Kenny
Eng.

  well enough blabbering. keep living.

	in Paris try to look up a record store called USA IMPORTS. I 
can't tell you exactly where it is but last time I was there the folks at 
the store clued me in to some fantastic evenings on the banks of the Seine.
Have fun.

hello,

Well, given the amount of work I need to do, it's questionable exactly
*when* I'll get out to my next rave, so perhaps I should invest in some
tapes... if you could find a point of contact for the Goa Gil tapes I'd
appreciate it.

Also, I still totally love the love phaser productions of both Garth and
spun, especially the straight up hip hop/go go/disco funk on that beginning
sequence on the spun CD.  Anyone know where I can get more stuff like that?
That shit is THE shit, IMHO, of course...

When will they realize that the more money and laws they throw at the
problem... well it's just going to be become an arms/bribery race  and
it's very hard to fight guerilla warfare or corruption. Whoever wins,
everyone loses. Oh, and what ever happened to the constitution?

the what?  what's that?  isn't that something out of gradeschool history
that we don't use anymore?



and this, THIS, *THIS*...:

Today I read in the Chronicle that the House began debate on "a far
| more controversial measure that would give the police more leeway to
| conduct searches without warrants, provided they are acting in

----------------------------------------------------------------
since when have the police *ever* acted on good faith?  our gov't is
supposed to built on checks and balances, but this looks unchecked and
completely *out of balance*...

thanks for the info, Neils....btw, how's your grommet? [might as well turn

     the rave scene (.. I dont think she has internet access either ).
     
     (: Thanks, and keep it smilin' :)

Hi All,

Here's the information for the Friday Feb. 10th pre-rave warm up
event.

Friday, Feb 10th, there will be a pre-rave movie before the Kundalini rave.
It's an austrailian double feature of "Ballroom Dancing" and "Priscilla:
Queen Of The Desert."  The location is in Berkeley at the UC Theatre We'll
be meeting in front of the theater before the film starts around 6:45 pm.
Both films are outrageously funny comedies and are a much needed change from
the Hollywood formulism that fills movie theaters today.

The UC Theatre is located at 2036 University Ave. The nearest cross street
is Shattuck.  Their phone number is 510.843.6267.  "Priscilla: Queen Of The
Desert" starts showing at 7:30 and "Strictly Ballroom" starts showing at
9:30.  Email me or leave a voice message if you want a seat saved for you.

Look for me, I'm Purple Tiger.  On me, or near me, will be a flourescent
orange cap that sayz "Wired" on the front.  After I sit down in the theater
I'll hang the cap on the end of the row, but I don't know if it will be on
the left end or the right end.  If all else fails, call the info line and
leave a message, and then wait for me to run up to the phone to answer the
page.

If you get lost or need more directions, call the voice mail with a number I
can reach you at.  The voice mail calls my pager so I can reach you pretty
quickly anytime day or night.

I hope to see you.  If you have suggestions for future events or want to
help me organize new events, please leave a message.

Pre-Rave Info Line 415.522.3848
UC Theatre         510.843.6267

Thanks to Milton and the E-Bee for the suggestion.

PT

No tickets will be sold at the door. Why? Because tickets include 
free drinks all night (including Shirley Temples!). 

All night? Actually, I think the venue is only permitted

once it closes. Also, it _may_ go all night, I just don't know. 
Call up the ticket vendors and ask.

Lastly, I'm fairly certain that this party will happen in 
the South Bay. Please come, we need all the help we can get!

i'd like add a big NOOOOOO to Mitsubishi.

why? they've got such PRETTY cars!

  because, Mitsubishi is actually a giant conglomerate which is (amongst
    other cute activities) very active in chopping down rainforests around
      the world.  one lovely example is their activities in BC, Canada,
        where they clearcut for chopsticks (can you even BELIEVE that?)
  they are also very active in Iryan Jaya, a rainforest area in New Guinea
    where there is a war being fought between Indonesia and the natives;
      it is rumored that Mitsubishi is 'helping' the timber interests 
        against the natives (i.e. getting their hands bloody)
  if you ask their corporate hdqtrs, they'll say that the car business and
    the lumber businesses are two completely different companies, but as
      an employee of a large conglomerate myself (GM Hughes), i can tell
        you that all ya gotta do is follow the bux to the top; that's 
          where the policy comes from.
  so next time you see one of those racey Mitsubishi sports cars, don't
    forget to let the owner know EXACTLY what they are financing, aside
      from their own indebtedness ;)

if you want more info, just contact the Rainforest Action Network on
  Sansome St in SF.

seeya!

just so you know,
(not saying you are wrong)
but there are about 7 or 8 mitsubishi's in japan
after wwii, the mitsubishi monolopoly was broken up (much like ma bell)
sure they are still connected though...
but it might be imporant *which* mitsubishi is doing this...

may be it's Mitsubishi Electric (kind of like the ge of japan)...
i used to work for them ;)

If you want I can give you the number of some raver friends in Paris, or

weeklies have a distilled 
re-grouping -energizing feeling

I went to Move at 181, parked my brother-in-law's sportscar 
6 blocks away in what could only be called the Wrong direction.
I think New York describes the space pretty well.  It is a very
nice bar.  I was kinda tired.

I went to Simply Done on deharo.  This is a great party.
It was a veritable "who's who" of the scene (i'm a who, you're a who)
with limos outside and everything!  Definitely an after 12 starter.

Giraffes are tall but Gazelles are graceful
Some people are *insanely* beautiful dancers and I really
want to boogie in a south african wild animal park.  Cows and sheep
just don't Move around that much, ya know?  lions, tigers, zebras -
give me some open Range land and a few disco balls ...

Speaking of deharo, I'm glad that I'm not the only one who thinks
Valentines Day is The Raver Holiday of Choice.  This really ought to
have the national status of christmas or labor day.  It's got it all-
satin red puffy hearts, flowers, little gifts and warm intentions.

It's all about LOVE and i've got that Juicy Sticky Yummy feeling 
Ooozing out my skin.  I want hugs and kisses and Baby Chills tickling my spine.
One of those Shiver Wiggles that splash multi-color neuron glitter sparks
all the way down and then rebound off your toes for 
One More Unbelievable Zoom up up UP 
right out the top of your head.
Mmmmmmm, sweetie, 
take me home!!

i think
maybe
i'm on fire

>Oh, and what ever happened to the constitution?

They voted it down.

----- According to a post by Marshall Kragen ---
From: Marshall Kragen <mkragen@access.digex.net>
To: pagre@weber.ucsd.edu
Subject: Voting down the Fourth Amendment

I heard this discussed by Charles Osgood this morning and went to 
http://www.house.gov and pulled out the information.  As you can see, 
what the House in effect yesterday did was to vote down the 4th Amendment 
to the Constitution.   It was introduced as an Amendment to a bill named 
H.R.666, which would make more exceptions to the exclusionary rule.  As 
you can see from the excerpts of the debate I included, someone thought 
the amendment would hamper police in their efforts.  Someone else noted 
the irony of the number of the bill involved.

[From the congressional record:]


AMENDMENT OFFERED BY MR. WATT OF NORTH CAROLINA
            Mr. WATT of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment.
                                                                     PAGE H1332
            The CHAIRMAN. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
            The text of the amendment is as follows:
            Amendment offered by Mr. Watt of North Carolina: Page 2, line 13,
          strike all after the word `States,` and insert the following:
                                                                     PAGE H1332
          `provided that the right of the people to be secure in their
          persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches
          and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue,
          but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and
          particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons
          or things to be seized.`
H1335
MCCALLUM: These technicalities are killing a lot of our
          police officers` efforts and the prosecutors` efforts to get
          convictions.
            I do not see why we should allow an amendment like this one that
          would just totally wipe out the bill, and that is what it does.
...........

Mr. MOAKLEY. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number
          of words.
            Mr. Chairman, they are quoting the sanctity of the Constitution,
          and I was just looking through the Bible at Revelations. I would
          like to quote:
                                                                     PAGE H1336
            (13) And I saw a beast rising out of the sea, with ten horns and
          seven heads, with ten diadems upon its horns and a blasphemous name
          upon its heads.  And the beast that I saw was like a leopard, its
          feet were like a bear`s, and its mouth was like a lion`s mouth.
          And to it the dragon gave his power and his throne and great
          authority.  One of its heads seemed to have a mortal wound, but its
          mortal wound was healed, and the whole earth followed the beast
          with wonder.  Men worshiped the dragon, for he had given his
          authority to the beast, and they worshiped the beast, saying, `Who
          is like the beast, and who can fight against it?`
            And the beast was given a mouth uttering haughty and blasphemous
          words, and it was allowed to exercise authority for forty-two
          months;
                                       TIME: 1810
                                                                     PAGE H1336
            Skipping over,
            It works great signs, even making fire come down from Heaven to
          earth in the sight of men; and by the signs which it is allowed to
          work in the presence of the beast, it deceives those who dwell on
          earth, bidding them make an image for the beast which was wounded
          by the sword and yet lived; and it was allowed to give breath to
          the image of the beast so that the image of that beast should even
          speak, and to cause those who would not worship the image of the
          beast to be slain.  Also it causes all, both small and great, both
          rich and poor, both free and slave, to be marked on the right hand
          or the forehead, so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the
          mark, that is, the name of the beast or the number of its name.
          This calls for wisdom: Let him who has understanding reckon the
          number of the beast, for it is a human number, its number is 666.
.........
RECORDED VOTE

Isn't this the holiday that the Greeting Card Companies lobbied 
(i.e. bribed) congress into creating way back when?  And who the
hell is St. Valentine, and what made him the authority on romance?
Sorry for the cynicism - at least there's those 1/2 price chocolate 
sales the day after.

Only once a year?  Surely these things should happen on a weekly basis.

Well, perhaps once a month would suffice.  :-)

Ummm, but remember the *quality* of food you're eating is higher in 
meat than in grain;  that is, more protein, et al per pound. It's an 
"investment".  Cattle-folk have tested this inside and out--the net gain 
from beef is only slight, but there is a gain. (trust me, I had to write 
a paper on this subject :(  But, you're right about the Latin American 
countries being raped by the beef industry. Not to mention that beef 
causes colon cancer--yucky!

  Hi,

  I'm wondering if Catherine is still subscribed to the list. Before
  I arrived here, she mailed me some tapes, and gave me a chanch to   listen
to some local DJ's. Now I'm here, I like to repay the favour 
  and send her some sounds from a few British DJ's. If your there, or
  anyone knows her e-mail address, give us a shout.
 
  And, is it just me, or has the volume of posts died down. Back a 
  few months ago I seem to remember a lot more traffic...?

  Love to you all,
  Gary

Dance hard enough and you WILL get hot and sweaty, even if it's 40 degrees

And no problem getting enough fresh air outside, unlike in yer average sweatbox.

Yes!!  I've got it.  Unfortunately I don't have my own Mac to 
play it on.  But there's a girl down the hall that let's me
use hers sometimes.

The prismatic glasses are great in other environments too,
especially places that are mostly dark with a few splashes
of light.  Like a clear moonlit night or the dance floor
of most clubs.

I'm going to start wearing mine whenever I go out.  They're fun
to pass around to people and they look cool too.  :-)

Just thought I would comment on the new weekly in Monterey (formerly 'The
Pick me UP")...It was really fun last week.  There are some really good
people trying to get things together in Monterey, and it's just a short drive
from Santa Cruz (where I am)...and a fun way to break the monotony of the
week, if you can afford to go dance in the middle of the week (school/work
permitting).  Good dj's, happy people...what more could you want?  I'd like
to see some SFravers there!!!! =)

smile!

(oh yeah, it's at 511 Tyler St., the Xst is Fremont, off of Hwy 1, it's only
$5.00...and it's 18 and up...)  =)

YEARS.

              Two Tribes Present........

        UNIVERSE THE TRIBAL GATHERING - '95

    The Reunification of The Scattered Tribes of Dance Part III

"Mountains They Traversed, Over Oceans Deep and Wide, Crossed Desert and
Deepest Jungle To Bridge The Dance Divide"

* After the aborted events and frustrations of 1994, we are pleased to
  announce the first ever legal outdoor dance festival in the UK.
* Tribal Gathering - '95 will be the first Universe party in the UK for
  18 months, and the biggest yet - A mamouth multi-sensory 18 hour
assault!
* All generations are invited in spiritual communion with the earth and
  acknowledge membership of the global dance community and the enormous
  energy it represents.
* Tribal Gathering - '95 will combine the best of both worlds,
commencing
  with an 8 hours afternoon and early evening live session on 5 stages -
  climaxing with a full on, insane all night Universe ritual dance
  celebration of epic proportions.
* Two Tribes is a new joint venture between the United States of Mind
  (original Universe crew/Final Frontier etc.) and the Mean Fiddler
  organization. Both collectives have unrivalled reputations for staging
  Europe's most electrifying musical events. You can be confident that
  Tribal gathering '95 is the one UK event that definitely will happen!

            AN AWE INSPIRING DANCE DREAMWORLD!

Tribal Gathering '95 will be staged on 60 acres of panoramic Oxfordshire
countryside. In each of the five main monumental circus tents, seperate
production crews will compete to create the most breathtakingly stunning
spectacle and theatrical moods to compliment the mesmerizing musical
marathons!! For many of the live acts, such as Orbital and Plastikman,
this will be their only UK appearance in 1995. It is our intention to
make "The Tribal Gathering UK" an annual event, with a possible
extension
next year to a two-day event.

            WE ALWAYS DELIVER!

Universe parties have always attracted a uniquely diverse crowd of
beautiful party people dedicated to the new global religion of tribal
house music and all of its many mutations. Anyone who has attended
"Tribal Gathering '93" in Wiltshire, "Tribal gathering '94" in Munich,
or
who has ever joined our weekly celebrations at the Final Frontier in
London will know that we create the ultimate intense feelgood party
vibe.
As dedicated party people ourselves and organizers since 1989, we have
been progressively building up to this event. "Tribal Gathering '95"
will
be our most outrageously orgasmic organic event yet - The Ultimate Party
that
WE have always dreamed of going to! See you there, Cosmic Crew. -
Universe.

I'm definitely interested in going!  Can you give me a ride though?  My
plane's in the shop. :)  Seriously though, if anyone wants to charter a
plane, I'll make a hell of a breakfast for everyone on the plane on Sunday. 
I mean, I can't really afford to chip in for gas.  Okay, enough silliness. 
If anyone can go to this thing, I envy you even if some of the bands are a
little cheesy.  Talk about a massive though...

I just read that message and I could cry that it is on the other side of 
the world!!  If only San Francisco could have an event like that! (hint, 
hint)  It goes along with that summer of love post that I read earlier - 
I forgot who wrote it.  But wouldn't an event like that be incredible?!?  
Would it be *POSSIBLE* here?  I don't know much at all about putting on 
events, much less major ones.

That's the point.  Our bodies simply do not need that much protien.  
There are numerous studies out there by independent research firms that 
are not affilitated with the meat and dairy industries that show that our 
bodies only actually need about an 8% intake of protien out of our total 
diet to stay healthy.  You might be getting a higher quality of food in 
taste value, but you'll do a lot better for your body by eating whole 
grains -n- stuff.

Being that its difficult for many of us ravers to travel, how about 
trying to get as many raves going at the same time at different places 
all over the world with the theme of uniting all raves everywhere so 
that we can experience the energy and joined consciousness of ravers all 
over the world creating a world wide massive rave.  I had a little taste 
of this when I went to a full moon rave in Thailand.  Not only was it 
great to be raving with people from different countries it was also an 
uplifting feeling to think about my fellow ravers in SF also having a 
full moon rave at the same time.

  Hi,

  Well, since I've got on-line (two days ago), and started hearing about
  all the good goings on party-wise, I'd love to experience something
    over here first hand. 

  Going from the talk over the last couple of days, Wicked sounds like 
  a good bet, although I'd be open to anything else. Basically I'm 
  looking for somepeople who would be willing to meet me, to guide
  this neophyte around, this Saturday, and help make my first SF
      experience a happy one.

  Meet me earlier for dinner, to talk, or whatever...

  Hoping to meet some of the people here, and enjoy a night in SF,
  Love to you all,
  Gary

I second that - lets get our summer of love up and running - how about a
major networking
unity event where all SF posses pull together to plan the largest rave yet.
Perhaps something big enough to
get critical mass, and run on for days, (at least a summer-long event!!!!)

 Additional studies STRONGLY link Calcium loss to high protein diets and

CDT POLICY POST 2/9/95

SUBJECT:     SENATOR EXON INTRODUCES ONLINE INDECENCY LEGISLATION
------------------------------------------------------------------------

A.      OVERVIEW

Senators Exon (D-NE) and Senator Gorton (R-WA) have 
introduced legislation to expand current FCC regulations on 
obscene and indecent audiotext to cover *all* content carried 
over all forms of electronic communications networks.  If 
enacted, the "Communications Decency Act of 1995" (S. 314) 
would place substantial criminal liability on 
telecommunications service providers (including telephone 
networks, commercial online services, the Internet, and 
independent BBS's) if their network is used in the 
transmission of any indecent, lewd, threatening or harassing 
messages.  The legislation is identical to a proposal offered 
by Senator Exon last year which failed along with the Senate 
Telecommunications reform bill (S. 1822, 103rd Congress, 
Sections 801 - 804). The text the proposed statute, with proposed
amendment, is appended at the end of this document.

The bill would compel service providers to chose between 
severely restricting the activities of their subscribers or 
completely shutting down their email, Internet access, and 
conferencing services under the threat of criminal liability.   
Moreover, service providers would be forced to closely 
monitor every private communication, electronic mail message, 
public forum, mailing list, and file archive carried by or 
available on their network, a proposition which poses a 
substantial threat to the freedom of speech and privacy 
rights of all American citizens.

S. 314, if enacted, would represent a tremendous step 
backwards on the path to a free and open National Information 
Infrastructure.  The bill raises fundamental questions about 
the ability of government to control content on 
communications networks, as well as the locus of liability 
for content carried in these new communications media.  

To address this threat to the First Amendment in digital 
media, CDT is working to organize a broad coalition of public 
interest organizations including the ACLU, People For the 
American Way, and Media Access Project, along with 
representatives from the telecommunications, online services, 
and computer industries to oppose S. 314 and to explore 
alternative policy solutions that preserve the free flow of 
information and freedom of speech in the online world.  CDT 
believes that technological alternatives which allow 
individual subscribers to control the content they receive 
represent a more appropriate approach to this issue.  


B.      SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS OF S. 314

S. 314 would expand current law restricting indecency and 
harassment on telephone services to all telecommunications 
providers and expand criminal liability to *all* content 
carried by *all* forms of telecommunications networks.  The 
bill would amend Section 223 of the Communications Act (47 
U.S.C. 223), which requires carriers to take steps to prevent 
minors from gaining access to indecent audiotext and 
criminalizes harassment accomplished over interstate 
telephone lines.  This section, commonly known as the Helms 
Amendment (having been championed by Senator Jesse Helms), 
has been the subject of extended constitutional litigation in 
recent years.

*       CARRIERS LIABLE FOR CONDUCT OF ALL USERS ON THEIR 
        NETWORKS

S. 314 would make telecommunication carriers (including 
telephone companies, commercial online services, the 
Internet, and BBS's) liable for every message, file, or other 
content carried on its network -- including the private 
conversations or messages exchanged between two consenting 
individuals.

Under S. 314, anyone who "makes, transmits, or otherwise 
makes available any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, 
image, or other communication" which is "obscene, lewd, 
lascivious, filthy, or indecent" using a "telecommunications 
device" would be subject to a fine of $100,000 or two years 
in prison (Section (2)(a)).    

In order to avoid liability under this provision, carriers 
would be forced to pre-screen all messages, files, or other 
content before transmitting it to the intended recipient.  
Carriers would also be forced to prevent or severely restrict 
their subscribers from communicating with individuals and 
accessing content available on other networks.

Electronic communications networks do not contain discrete 
boundaries.  Instead, users of one service can easily 
communicate with and access content available on other 
networks.  Placing the onus, and criminal liability, on the 
carrier as opposed to the originator of the content, would 
make the carrier legally responsible not only for the conduct 
of its own subscribers, but also for content generated by 
subscribers of other services.

This regulatory scheme clearly poses serious threats to the 
free flow of information throughout the online world and the 
free speech and privacy rights of individual users.  Forcing 
carriers to pre-screen content would not only be impossible 
due to the sheer volume of messages, it would also violate 
current legal protections.

*       CARRIERS REQUIRED TO ACT AS PRIVATE CENSOR OF ALL 
        PUBLIC FORUMS AND ARCHIVES

S. 314 would also expand current restrictions on access to 
indecent telephone audiotext services by minors under the age 
of 18 to cover similar content carried by telecommunications 
services (such as America Online and the Internet).  (Sec 
(a)(4)).

As amended by this provision, anyone who, "by means of 
telephone or telecommunications device, makes, transmits, or 
otherwise makes available (directly or by recording device) 
any indecent communication for commercial purposes which is 
available to any person under the age of 18 years of age or 
to any other person without that person's consent, regardless 
of whether the maker of such communication placed the call or 
initiated the communication" would be subject of a fine of 
$100,000 or two years in prison.

This would force carries to act as private censors of all 
content available in public forums or file archives on their 
networks.   Moreover, because there is no clear definition of 
indecency, carriers would have to restrict access to any 
content that could be possibly construed as indecent or 
obscene under the broadest interpretation of the term. Public 
forums, discussion lists, file archives, and content 
available for commercial purposes would have to be 
meticulously screened and censored in order to avoid 
potential liability for the carrier.

Such a scenario would severely limit the diversity of content 
available on online networks, and limit the editorial freedom 
of independent forum operators.   

ADDITIONAL NOTABLE PROVISIONS 

* AMENDMENT TO ECPA

Section (6) of the bill would amend the Electronic 
Communications Privacy Act (18 USC 2511) to prevent the 
unauthorized interception and disclosure of "digital 
communications" (Sec. 6).  However, because the term "digital
communication" is not defined and 18 USC 2511 currently 
prevents unauthorized interception and disclosure of 
"electronic communications" (which includes electronic mail 
and other forms of  communications in digital form), the 
effect of this provision has no clear importance.

* CABLE OPERATORS MAY REFUSE INDECENT PUBLIC ACCESS    
  PROGRAMMING

Finally, section (8) would amend sections 611 and 612 of the 
Communications Act (47 USC 611 - 612) to allow any cable 
operator to refuse to carry any public access or leased 
access programming which contains "obscenity, indecency, or 
nudity".  

C.      ALTERNATIVES TO EXON: RECOGNIZE THE UNIQUE USER CONTROL  
        CAPABILITIES OF INTERACTIVE MEDIA

Government regulation of content in the mass media has always 
been considered essential to protect children from access to 
sexually-explicit material, and to prevent unwitting 
listeners/views from being exposed to material that might be 
considered extremely distasteful.  The choice to protect 
children has historically been made at the expense of the First 
Amendment ban on government censorship.  As Congress moves to 
regulate new interactive media, it is essential that it 
understand that interactive media is different than mass 
media.  The power and flexibility of interactive media offers 
a unique opportunity to enable parents to control what 
content their kids have access to, and leave the flow of 
information free for those adults who want it.  Government 
control regulation is simply not needed to achieve the 
desired purpose.

Most interactive technology, such as Internet browsers and 
the software used to access online services such as America 
Online and Compuserve, already has the capability to limit 
access to certain types of services and selected information.  
Moreover, the electronic program guides being developed for 
interactive cable TV networks also provide users the 
capability to screen out certain channels or ever certain 
types of programming.  Moreover, in the online world, most 
content (with the exception of private communications 
initiated by consenting individuals) is transmitted by 
request.  In other words, users must seek out the content 
they receive, whether it is by joining a discussion or 
accessing a file archive.  By its nature, this technology 
provides ample control at the user level.  Carriers (such as 
commercial online services, Internet service providers) in 
most cases act only as "carriers" of electronic transmissions 
initiated by individual subscribers.

CDT believes that the First Amendment will be better served 
by giving parents and other users the tools to select which 
information they (and their children) should have access to.  
In the case of criminal content the originator of the 
content, not the carriers, should be responsible for their 
crimes.  And, users (especially parents) should be empowered 
to determine what information they and their children have 
access to.  If all carriers of electronic communications are 
forced restrict content in order to avoid criminal liability 
proposed by S. 314, the First Amendment would be threatened 
and the usefulness of digital media for communications and 
information dissemination would be drastically limited.


D.      NEXT STEPS

The bill has been introduced and will next move to the Senate 
Commerce Committee, although no Committee action has been

I listened to Jean Michel Jarre's Equinoxe yesterday in the car while
driving around in the beautiful spring-like weather and was blown away!

hello,

I sent the following note to Larry Pressler of the Senate, if you would
like to use it as a template, feel free...

*

---------------------------------------------------------

To: larry_pressler@pressler.senate.gov

Hello Mr. Pressler,

I am writing to urge you to oppose and vote against the S314 bill that
would make network service providers responsible for the content on their
networks.  This is wrong for many reasons, not the least of which are
issues related to the fact that it's not the service providers business what
users are doing with their own media/transmissions/etc.  It is not the
place of these providers to police the networks, nor is it anyone else's
responsibility.  These messages/transmissions should be subject to privacy
protection and should not be examined as that is a violation of the users
private communications.  In the case where any "indecent, lewd, threatening
or harassing messages" (from the bill itself), are sent to people/parties
who don't want to have them, if this behavior is not stopped upon request
by the party not wishing to participate, then perhaps criminal action is
appropriate but not before.  It will also have an extremely negative effect
on commerce and the economics of the networks to have this law pass, so
I urge you most strongly to see that it doesn't!  Thank you very much,

If i read this right, S314 (see below) is an attempt at killing the
freedoms brought on by the new communications (read "internet") via a
"divide and conquer" ploy. That is, if every single internet access and
backbone node becomes responsible for the transmissions of data between
networks, there's a very good reason to believe that some networks will
start detaching from the internet because it would be too difficult to
comply with the new laws. How are they going to ensure/enforce the law,
by looking over the shoulder of each and every user? No, more likely
the public access of the internet will become much more
difficult/expensive to get; corporate access will continue, with
corporations vouching for the "decent" usage of the network by making
any abuse a firable offense (expect many corporations to limit internet
access to those on a "need to know" basis so as to reduce their
liability).

Ultimately this would begin to bring us back to the days when the Well
and various local underground BBSs were the only way for people to get
together in Cyberspace. The reason for doing this is clear -- trying to
divide the internet can only serve to reduce the number of people 
informed about the draconian, reactionary measures being planned by the
US Government. The internet is a threat to the system, we are staying
too well informed!

Like Jack said, net-stalking/threats should be dealt with via
restraining orders; pornography is going to happen no matter what, be
it on paper, a JPEG or GIF, or a drawing in a bathroom stall. 
Likewise, masturbation isn't going away either... Then again, I expect
that they'll soon make the killing of sperm/ovum/foetus a punishable
offense -- every sperm is sacred, and all those people jacking off to a
24 bit JPEG virtual-vulva (TM) are literally killing BILLIONS of
POTENTIAL CHRISTIANS!

I would hope that sense prevails and this is shot down, but I'm not
seeing a lot of sense in Washington right now...

Anybody know of any good Xwindows/Motif/Unix/Networking/C/C++/Objects/Lisp
hacking jobs in the Netherlands??? :-) Time to consider moving to a
place where freedom isn't an afterthought keeping the ghost of the
1950's American suburbia-uber-alles ethos alive......

I - SUMMARY
- -----------
     
     On February 2, Sen. Jim Exon (D-NE) introduced S. 314,
The Communications Decency Act of 1995.  Sen. Exon's bill, 
which contains provisions intended to curtail transmission 
of obscene, indecent, or harassing telecommunications, is 
identical to an amendment to the Senate telecommunications 
deregulation legislation which died last fall with the 
conclusion of the 103rd Congress.  Although ostensibly 
extending existing federal prohibitions on obscene or 
harassing telephone calls to other telecommunications 
devices, these provisions could greatly expand prohibited 
conduct and would potentially make employers, service 
providers, and carriers liable for transmission of 
restricted communications.  The likelihood of passage of the 
telecommunications deregulation legislation in the current 
Congress and the likelihood that Sen. Exon will attempt to 
again attach his language to such a vehicle makes the 
potential passage of the Exon language quite plausible.
     
     
II - ANALYSIS
- -------------
     
     Sen. Exon's interest in the issues addressed in S.314
was reportedly spurred by reports of electronic stalking on 
the Internet.  Sen. Exon stated upon introduction of the 
legislation on February 2, "I want to keep the Information 
Superhighway from resembling a red light district.  This 
legislation will help stop those who electronically cruise 
the digital universe to engage children in inappropriate 
communications . . . or electronically stalk users of 
computer networks."  The Exon bill would address obscenity 
on radio and cable television, but of particular interest to 
EMA members are Section 2, on obscene or harassing use of 
telecommunications facilities, and Section 5, which extends 
the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) to include 
digital communications.
     
     According to Sen. Exon's introductory statement, his
legislation is intended to "extend and strengthen" the anti- 
harassment, decency, and anti-obscenity restrictions on 
telephone calls in current law to all telecommunications 
devices.  The Exon bill would not, however, simply apply 
existing law to new telecommunications devices.
     
     Because of differences between existing telephone
technology and telecommunications technology such as 
electronic messaging, the Exon bill would potentially 
prohibit a wide array of currently allowed electronic 
communications.  Furthermore, the Exon bill would broaden 
existing law by subjecting transmitters, as well as the 
individuals who send obscene or harassing communications, to 
criminal liability.
     
     A - RESTRICTIONS ON NONCONSENSUAL
         INDECENCY AND HARASSMENT
     
     Current law, as codified in Sec. 223(a) of the
Communications Act of 1934, prohibits any "obscene, lewd, 
lascivious, filthy, or indecent" communications by 
telephone.[1]  (Communications Act of 1934, Sec. 223(a) 
(47JU.S.C. 223(a))).  Sec. 223(a) also prohibits intentional 
harassment by telephone, including by anonymous calls, 
repeated hang-ups, or repeated harassing calls.  (47 U.S.C. 
223(a)(1)(A - D)).  Finally, Sec. 223(a)(2) prohibits 
knowingly permitting a telephone facility under one's 
control to be used for such purposes.  The courts have 
interpreted Sec. 223(a) narrowly to apply only to non- 
consensual or unsolicited telephone calls.
     
     The Exon bill would make two fundamental changes in
existing Sec. 223(a), with potentially wide-ranging, and 
possibly unintended, consequences.  First, the Exon bill 
expands the prohibitions on obscene or indecent or harassing 
telephone calls to communication by all telecommunications 
devices.  Second, the Exon bill extends the prohibition 
against making obscene or indecent communications to 
"transmit[ting] or otherwise mak[ing] available" any such 
communication.  (S. 314 Sec. 2(a) (emphasis added)).  In 
addition, the Exon bill would raise the penalty for such 
violations from the current up to $50,000 or six months in 
prison, to up to $100,000 or two years in prison.  (S. 314 
Sec. 2(b)).
     
     The Exon bill provisions would have a number of
consequences for electronic messaging.  First, unless the 
court-created limitation on the scope of the Sec. 223(a) 
anti-obscenity and indecency provisions to nonconsensual 
telephone calls is applied as well to all 
telecommunications, the provision would prohibit all 
"obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent" 
telecommunications, whether or not consensual.  Services or 
carriers that transmit "or otherwise make [] available" such 
communications would be liable.  Thus, the amended 
Communications Act would, on its face, prohibit indecent 
communications between consenting adults.  This provision, 
unless limited to nonconsensual communications as the courts 
have done with regard to the existing prohibition on such 
telephone calls, is most likely unconstitutional. 
Nevertheless, the legislative history of this provision 
should clarify that the amended language is intended to 
apply only to nonconsensual communications.[2]
     
     Second, the Exon bill restricts anyone from
transmitting, "or otherwise mak[ing] available," "obscene, 
lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent" communications. 
(S.J314 Sec. 2(a)(1)(B)).  This goes beyond and is in 
addition to the existing prohibition on knowingly permitting 
a telephone facility under one's control to be used for 
purposes prohibited by Sec. 223(a).  The Exon bill expands 
the prohibition on knowing use of telephone facilities to 
knowing use of telecommunications facilities.  (S. 314 
Sec.J2(a)(2)).  The latter provision may prove troublesome 
if service providers are deemed to "know" about the use of 
Bulletin Boards for or Electronic Mail for harassment or 
indecent remarks.
     
     These provisions could have a chilling effect on
electronic message services, providers, carriers, or anyone 
else who could be deemed to "transmit[] or otherwise make[] 
available" prohibited electronic communications.  Thus, for 
example, if someone sent an indecent electronic comment from 
a workstation, the employer, the e-mail service provider, 
and the carrier could all potentially be held liable, and 
subject to up to $100,000 in fines or up to 2 years in 
prison.  This provision also has potentially chilling 
effects on electronic bulletin boards, discussion groups, 
and basic electronic mail communications.  Although some 
service providers regularly screen bulletin boards to ensure 
that no obscene or indecent remarks appear upon them, the 
incredible proliferation of such bulletin boards makes 
comprehensive screening practically impossible.[3]  Bulletin 
Boards on the Internet, and, potentially, electronic 
messages, include numerous postings making racist remarks, 
arguing that the Holocaust never occurred, etc.  All of 
these could conceivably be considered "indecent," or 
annoying, abusive or harassing, any of which could subject 
employers, services, and carriers to liability.
     
     It is questionable whether the prohibition on obscene
or indecent communications, even if limited to nonconsensual 
communications, can be accomplished in electronic 
communications without chilling the First Amendment. 
Electronic bulletin boards and discussion groups blur the 
concept of intent:  anyone perusing bulletin boards or 
discussion groups on the Internet has the potential to 
stumble, as if accidently stumbling into an X-rated movie 
theater, upon indecent material.[4]  Such an encounter may 
not be "consensual."  The Internet practice of "flaming" 
fellow users very frequently involves use of indecency.  Any 
such flame, which is by definition nonconsensual,[5] would 
subject anyone who "makes available" the communication 
(again, potentially including an employer, service provider, 
common carrier, etc.) to full liability under this section.
     
     B. RESTRICTIONS ON COMMERCIAL OBSCENITY
     
     The Exon bill would amend current law which is intended
to restrict consensual obscene or indecent telephone calls, 
such as dial-a-porn.  Current law prohibits use of the 
telephone to make obscene communications for commercial 
purposes, regardless of whether the maker of such 
communications placed the call (i.e., regardless of 
consent). (47 U.S.C. 223(b)(1)).  Current law also prohibits 
making indecent communications available to persons under 
age 18. (47 U.S.C. 223(b)(2)).  Current law allows common 
carriers to avoid liability under the provision limiting 
indecent material to persons over 18 by complying with 
F.C.C. rules [6] and by offering subscribers the right to 
block access to indecent material.  The Exon bill would 
extend these prohibitions to all telecommunications.  (S. 
314 Sec.J2(a)(3)).
     
     By simply applying existing telephone provisions to
telecommunications, the Exon bill would again create problems 
due to the unique nature of non-telephone telecommunications. 
For example, may a service or provider be liable if it does 
not check the ages of all members of a household, and allow a 
family to block access to members under the age of 18? 
Numerous electronic bulletin boards on line contain indecent 
material,[7] and indecent material may spring up in any 
discussion group, or even when a rap artist discusses his 
lyrics, or a record company puts a new release on line, as 
has been done in recent months.  Because subscribers are 
required to pay a commercial fee (beyond their basic 
subscription fee, which would presumably be analogous to a 
telephone common carrier fee) to access these services, 
indecent material on these services may subject providers to 
liability.[8]
     
     C. EXPANSION OF ECPA
     
     The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA),
codified in the U.S. Code at Title 18, generally prohibits 
unauthorized electronic surveillance, such as wiretapping of 
employees.  (18 U.S.C. 2511.  See Alderman v. U.S., 394 U.S. 
165 (1969)).  The Exon bill would add conforming language 
which amends the prohibition on surveillance to ensure that 
it covers all electronic communications, including digital 
communications.  (S. 314 Sec. 5).
     
     ECPA has been amended before to account for the
evolution of technology.  When passed in 1968, ECPA 
prohibited surveillance only of wire or oral communications. 
ECPA was amended in 1986 to prohibit as well surveillance of 
electronic communications.  Sec. 5 of S. 314 would ensure 
that all electronic communications, including digital 
communications, are covered.
     
     
III - STATUS
- ------------
     
     The Exon language is substantively identical to the
amendment to S. 1822, Senate telecommunications deregulation 
legislation in the last congress.  It is anticipated that 
Sen. Exon will again offer his language as an amendment to 
telecommunications deregulation legislation which is 
expected to be introduced by mid-February.  Sen. Pressler, 
Chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, has indicated his 
eagerness to address the legislation.  Sen. Exon is a member 
of the Senate Commerce Committee.
     
     
IV - PROGNOSIS
- --------------
     
     Last year, Sen. Exon's language was adopted as an
amendment to the telecommunications deregulation legislation 
even though many thought it hastily drafted and poorly 
thought out.  Nevertheless, this language could be adopted 
as part of the telecommunications bill in a matter of weeks 
or potentially added to any legislation pending on the 
Senate floor.
     
     The will of Senators to oppose such "morality"
legislation, regardless of how technically flawed, is always 
in short supply; in the more conservative atmosphere of the 
104th Congress, such legislation stands an even greater 
chance of passage.
     
     
- ----------------------------------------------------------- 
ENDNOTES:
     
1     Courts have not defined precisely what constitutes 
indecency, although they have held that mere offensiveness 
is insufficient.
     
2     Sec. 7 of Sen. Exon's bill, which requires that cable 
channels "unsuitable for children" be fully scrambled for 
nonsubscribers, suggests that he does not intend to prohibit 
indecent, non-obscene, consensual communications. Sec. 7 
does not prohibit such "indecent" programming as the Playboy 
Channel, but merely ensures that it will be limited to 
consenting adults.
     
3     This problem is compounded by the indefiniteness of 
the definition of indecency.
     
4     The proliferation of such material on the Internet is 
evident in the proliferation of bulletin boards devoted 
solely to sexual topics.  According to a newsgroup list 
compiled by Digital Equipment Corp., the most popular 
bulletin board on the Internet, after a bulletin board 
providing rules for new users, is alt.sex.stories, which 
half a million Internet users log on to each month.  The 
next most popular category is alt.binaries.pictures.erotica, 
followed by the alt.sex discussion group.
     
5     One could argue, however, that the practices of 
logging on to the Internet or entering a discussion group or 
bulletin board, constitutes "consent," or waiver of the 
right to object, to whatever communications may ensue.  The 
unresolved issue of consent demonstrates the difficulty of 
simply applying existing obscenity or anti-harassment law 
governing telephones to all telecommunications.
     
6     For example, F.C.C. rules require that companies 
require a credit card for provision of services.
     
7     See supra note 4.
     
8     Although it might be argued that the basic 
subscription fee of on-line services is analogous to a 
telephone common carrier fee, in this case the carrier (the 
service provider) is providing both the basic communications 
and the information services (i.e., the Bulletin Board). 
Thus the electronic telecommunications carrier is analogous 
to both the telephone company and the dial-a-porn operator 
for enforcement purposes.

APPLE'S BIG BYTE OUT OF HISTORY

Apple, the company that revolutionized the personal computer industry,
apparently thinks Newt Gingrich's Third Wave Information Age means
cencorship is back - especially when it comes to abortion and gays.

In a stunning move for a company long admired for its forward-looking
policies, Apple last week suddenly notified the producer of an acclaimed
American history CD-ROM that it was discontinuing shipments because of
complaints about mentions of turn-of-the-century abortion, birth control
and homosexuality.

After failing to get Voyager Co. - the producer of "Who Built America?" -
to delete the controversial sections, Apple informed the company on Jan. 31
that it was discontinuing shipments of the disc to public schools.

Apple's notice came only a few days after "Who Built America?" won the
American Historical Association's bienniel prize for "the most outstanding
contribution to the teaching and learning of history."

Since November, Apple has distributed more than 12,000 copies of the
Voyager disc, as part of its free software package bundled with new
computer shipments to public schools.

"Who Built America?" was a joint project between New York-based Voyager,
the leading U.S. publisher of CD-ROM discs, and the American Social History
Project at the City University of New York.

CD-ROM is the technology that combines text, photos, music and video into
one multi-media experience on a personal computer.  Like cd music discs,
CD-ROM discs can store immense amounts of information compared with older
methods.

Only a few minutes of viewing this disc shows you why Apple was at first so
enthusiastic.  With it, history comes alive.  You get not only a standard
text but original source documents, such as the complete video of "The
Great Train Robbery," the actual voice of William Jennings Bryan giving his
"Cross of Gold" speech, and survivors of the 1906 Atlanta race riot and the
1911 Triangle Shirtwaist factory fire giving you firsthand accounts of
those tragedies.

But in early January, Apple executives notified Bob Stein, chief executive
of Voyager, that they had recieved some complaints, the most troubling
dealing with citations of abortion, birth control, and homosexuality.

There was, for instance, the audio interview with Elizabeth Anderson, who
recounted how, beginning in 1910, she had had 12 abortions.

And the 1882 letter from a gay German immigrant explaining how he fled to
America from his native land after being arrested for a homosexual
relationship.

And the 1901 New York Times account of Murray Hall, a well-known Tammany
Hall leader who for 25 years masquereded as a man and was married twice,
though "he" was secretly a "she."

"Some people may not like the fact there was abortion in 1910, but you
can't deny it existed," said Steven Brier, the CUNY history professor who
authored the original two-volume "Who Built America" and then adapted it
for CD-ROM.

"It's unbelievable to have this project blown-off in this way," an angry
Brier said yesterday.

And for this to happen with Apple - long regarded by many as the most
creative and visionary of companies - is especially troubling.

I bought my first Apple 2E more than 10 years ago, and I came to believe
that Apple's healthy irreverence toward narrow-minded thought and arbitrary
authority was just the spirit that produced its pioneering innovations,
things like the Macintosh and the powerbook laptops.

It was Apple, remember, that not too long ago refused to build a new plant
in Austin, Tex., after the local government tried to penalize it for
providing medical benefits to same-sex domestic partners.  That time, Apple
stood on principal and won.

But now here was this public relations person, Carolyn Donohoe, giving me a
prepared statement late yesterday on the "Voyager issue."

Since the statement so clearly double-speaks for itself, I will quote it
extensively:

"It's not an issue of censorship.  However, Apple has recieved some
customer complaints.  As a matter of course, Apple continually reviews the
content of its bundles based on customer satisfaction and feedback.

"Currently, Apple is evaluating the bundle titled 'Apple Educational
Series: Elementary and Secondary Reference.'  To date, Apple has neither
formally notified Voyager nor made any public announcements about future
versions of this bundle."

With the November elections behind us, and with our nation's future being
increasingly shaped by a rabid history professor named Newt Gingrich, Apple
appears ready to join the cencorship posse, tossing its own once-proud
rebel legacy into the trash bin it helped make famous.

- -30-

The reason I phrased the subject of this email as a question is because I
don't feel right calling Apple's action censorship, but I do think Apple's
action to be utterly reprehensible.

If you would like to respond in an official way, please email:
michaels@voyagerco.com
He's handling this in-house.

England for da show. People interested(seriously) so I can get some 
numbers from several travel agencies on airfare, logging and da show. So 
email me if interested in putting our combined buying power together to 
see its its possibel to go to Two Tribes without breaking the bank.

Should Jungle be mixed with jazz?  What is an example of this??? Does it

 I've a couple of questions, hopefully someone will be able to help
 me out...

 Wicked, tommorow night. When does it start ? Also, when does it 
 normally get busy ? And lastly, when does it end ?

 The other party I heard mentioned, Ravers in Paradise. Where is 
 it ? I dont know the city very well, but I can always use a map. 

 I'll be coming up to SF tomorrow, hoping to have a good first 
 experience of the SF Scene. The times will help me with my 
 arrangements, for getting there, and getting home...

 If anyone can help me out, please mail or call. I'll be heading
 up to the city midday tommorow.
 
 A happy Friday to you all,
Gary

hi gary!

um, that's ravers in wonderland.  allen of ameba said the other day (or
was it mark?  sorry, i can't remember and credit where credit's due) said
you could get in for $15 if you wear a costume.  i think that's before
midnight...$20 after midnight.  i would go if it were cheaper, 'cause it's
at a club in berkeley kinda close to where i live. 

anthrax' advice: go to wicked tomorrow night!  but be sure to get there
EARLY because it will probably be jam-packed by midnight.  i am also very
pleased about the musical offerings for the evening.  my big kick right 
now is VARIETY VARIETY VARIETY, and it looks like that will happen...more 
so than at the usual wicked party, perhaps?

on that vein:  perfect evening includes rekkid spinners that do a set in a
solid, unmistakable style followed by someone else who does something
completely different.  i love that!  sometimes it works, sometimes it
doesn't.  but it does make you pay more attention to the music and what
the dj is doing with it.  maybe someday someone will write a graduate
thesis about dj's and raves and such and go on and on... but it
ain't gonna be me! 

love & kisses,

ann

  I just finished my new tape and am very satisfied with how it came
out.  I don't want to sell it for profit at all, I just want everybody
and their mom to hear it :D ... Hopefully I can get it mastered and
duplicated pretty quickly.  If anyone wants a copy, leave me mail with
your address or phone number and I'll get you one as soon as they are
ready :)

  I also have a question for everyone who has had their tapes duplicated 
before.  What place would you recommend to copy 250 tapes w/color cover? 

  Peace
  Love,
  Ernie

Hey Ernie, nice of you to offer your tape especially for free.  You 
didn't mention what kind of music is on it, assuming it is music.

I'm sorry, I didn't take very well to the tone of this response.  "You just
gotta know where to look"?  OK, *where*.  Or is jungle going to turn into
another realm of exclusivity where only the *true* junglists get to know
about all the goodies.  Sheesh.

Now, look again at what I wrote about Jonah's set.  I said, *very* 
deliberately, that he played "ambient-jazz-jungle."  I used that term 
to soften the usual hyphen-encoupled kind of labeling (of which ambient-
jungle is just the latest) and to indicate what I felt was the wider
stylistic sweep of what he was playing.  I didn't say he played jazz
because at least in the traditional sense he didn't.  Read it again.
However, there's no reason that some types of jungle and some types of
jazz couldn't be mixed together quite successfully.  I put an old mid-70s
jazz track (what would now be considered "acid jazz" I suppose, sigh) at
the start of my promo tape and nobody thinks it's out of place.  It's
there for a *reason*.  

As for mixing jungle and other styles, normally I too prefer to hear
sets or groups of tunes that are stylistically consistent, but consistency
gets boring too after a while and the really good DJs know how to move
from style to style or genre to genre and use the transitions to keep
things interesting.  

And as for jungle itself, ok, what *kind* of jungle are we talking about?
Not everything out there sounds like 'Original Nuttah' or the new bad-bwoi
sound.  Those who have delved into jungle seriously know that it is a
remarkably flexible and resilient style and reaches across the spectrum
from jazz to ambient to house to hardcore for influences on its rhythmic
underpinnings.  There are house (or techno or rock or jazz or whatever
genre) songs I wouldn't play back to back even in the same set, and the
same goes for jungle.  In my opinion, the only thing that can hold jungle
back is the desire to stand pat among some jungle devotees.

I still strongly believe in the lessons of house music, and one of them
is that "no one OWNS house music" (or any other kind for that matter),
it belongs to all of us and we must let it develop as it should.  And
just to prove the point, I played a remix of 'The House That Jack Built'
to start my set in Portland last night, and I played a DJ Pulse track from
the Moving Shadow jungle-oriented label to finish.

Just wanted to let SFRavers know who are interested:


Unfortunately,  Ravers In Wonderland  has been postponed until a yet to be
announced date.

The site that they were going to use has had it's permit revoked.  The
spaceowner told the party organizers that he had all of the necessary
permits, when reportedly he was actually running off of a "special
functions" provision of a recording studio permit instead.  It is
unfortunate that the spaceowner did not communicate to the party organizers
the level of risk involved with the site's stability before this happened,
or perhaps a usable backup site would have been found for tonight.

Since this did not happen, and a usuable backup site has still not been
found, the party's organizers have very reluctantly postponed Ravers In
Wonderland until a yet to be announced date.

You can call the party's voicemail number for updates on this situation in
the coming days.     Ravers In Wonderland    415-789-8522


For those of you who still want something to do AND are over the age
discrimination of twenty-one years, there is a Wicked happening
tonight in the city at 1015 Folsom.


Todd a.k.a. Infinity

P.S. -- I am not the same as "Infinitee", a new DJ who is involved in much
of the organizing with Ravers In Wonderland, (as I understand it).

Dear Sfraves;

	I'm not gay; but the more I hear about oppression against groups 
of people that live a different lifestyle the more I get affaird. When 
will it stop; that fact is if we don't stand as one; we will all be 
eventually singled out for our various egocentric differences; whether it 
be drugs, music religion or lack there off ..etc. It appears that the 
lines the goverment is drawing is over sexuall orientation; so this is 
where we must meet them head on; and not give an inch. I personnally have 
nightmares about Newt G. How can you have separtation of church and state 
when you have Minsters holding public office; they bring will them there 
distorted sense of morally with them and act on lesisaltion accordingly. 
They see the potiental of what the internet can do to fear politics and 
fear religion and of course they what to control it. I'm very concerned; 
make sure that if you have a gay friend to give them a hug and tell them 
you love them. Because I image that their feeling this conservative wave 
much more the we are.

FREE.    This was touted as a "Make up" party to make up for the fiasco
New Years,   and the last WICKED,   which some people say were not the
typical WICKED parties.

Naturally,  we correctly assumed that it was going to be packed,  and it
was.    We get there about 10:30 pm (Early for WICKED standards) and
already,  there was a line.    Although it was reasonably short,  there
was no delays in getting in the door,   although being 21+,  the door
people had to check ID's.

I walk in,   and learn that only the downstairs area was open,   and things
were getting set up in the main room.    The front room was used as the chill
room,  and at the same time,  in the upstairs front section,  a private
party was in progress.

There were perhaps 40 people or so,  when I entered,   but it was filling
fast.    So,   after stretching,  in preparation for dancing,  I head on
downstairs in the basement to hear Harry Who kick things off,  to start
dancing my first set.    After a short "warm up" I decided to schmooze
around,   and socialize for a while until the energy level started to
pick up.   Say!!  whatever happened to all the pillows that used to
be at 1015 Folsom?    I only saw two of them!!

About  half hour later,   the main room opens up,   and Galen was spinning.
Great!!  So I pick my favorite spot,   and started to "Get down" to Galens
set.    As usual,  his variaty was brilliant,  and he took me on a pleasant
and unexpected trip.   By about this time,   there were about a hundred 
people on the main dance floor.

Later on,  Robbie Hardkiss did a live set,   and deviated from the usual
housey sounds into some rather complicated beats,   but it made for some
interesting dancing.

Usually,  when I'm out there dancing,   and I get a break in the beat,
I'll usually leave if I've been dancing for several hours,   so I went
back downstairs to learn that Markie Mark was behind the turntables,
spinning some higher energy trances than upstairs,   so I stayed down
in the basement (dispite the humididity and heat),   and danced a
considerable portion of Markie's set.

Didn't see quite that many SFRavers as I had expected,   but the usual
dedicated crew were always there.    Hi to Bill and Gaby and all the
rest...

Eventually,  there was a short break from the Boom Boom,  and I figured
that I should think about cooling down.   I head upstairs and do a little
exploring,   until I realized I was in that other private party.  

I quickly leave,   and head down in the main room.    HardKiss had just
finished his set,   and I think Josh went on next in the main room.

I decided to wait until Josh's set develops,   and head back downstairs
to dance to Markies set.   By about this time,  every surface in the basement
was soaking wet,   and lo and behold,    I see madison.    Actually,  she
saw me first and hugged and kissed me to death....   Man!  Can she dance...

Markies set was reaching critical mass,   as people were cheering and shouting
as Markie was taking us through all beat possibilities.   WOW!   dispite
the fans,   it was sweltering down there,   but I just couldn't possibly
leave until Markie let me go.   Eventually he did,  and I head back upstairs
soaking wet.   As Willy Wong pointed out,  I wear as little as possible
when getting down in hot sweltering places.   But,  lets be practical!!

Upstairs,   Garth had just gotten on,   and he put me into a most incredable
trance state of mind.   I felt as I was dancing,  that everything was floating
and moving in perfect harmony.   As one looked around,   there were people
packed on the stage,   up in the balcony,   all dancing like there was 
no tommorrow.   Good old 1015 Folsom was simply "Bouncing" around big time.

Things were so packed,   that security opened a few alternate doors,  to
make it easy for people to get around.   I would estimate about 700 mad
raving lunitics were getting down and wicked at 1015.

Garth brilliantly guided my trance state from one musical space to another.
I just couldn't stop dancing,  so I danced Garth's entire set,    perhaps
stopping no more then 2 - 3 minutes for water break,  and/or stretching
as the need arose.

After Garth,   Mark farina went on.    I left the dance floor until Mark
had a chance to develop his set,   and headed by the front door to cool
off and schmoose for a while.   I wanted this to be the longest chill 
period,   as it was about 5:30 am by this time.    

After about a 20 minute break from dancing (Kinda long for me),  I head
back to the main room to check on Mark.   I was somewhat dissapointed
in what his set was developing into,   so I head back downstairs to
discover that Jeno was literally GETTING OFF.    I quickly run upstairs
to tell Craig and Denese that Jeno was on downstairs.

Again,  I fell into a very pleasant floating trance state of mind.   Jeno
took me o a most pleasant trip,    playing a large variaty of housey
trancey material.

I head upstairs to cool off again,  and discover that Mark finally developed
his set.   Towards the end of his set,   he went into some really slow
dub stuff.

Heading downstairs,  I finished dancing Jeno's set until closing time.
When Jeno stopped,   I head back upstairs,  the daylight shining through
the skylight,  and people walking around in a daze.

So,  finishes yet another fine (And free) edition of WICKED....

Till next time...

I just wanted to say hello to everybody on the sfraves mailing list.
I just joined this list and would like to know more about sfraves events
here in the bay area. I am originally from Milan Italy and really like the
San Francisco rave scene. I have a huge collection of
trance/ambient/techno/etc. CD's and would like to get in touch with someone
to possibly exchange opinions about latest releases. I joined the UKDance
mailing list but I rather be on this one where I can get to know people in
my same area.
By the way, I just bought a compilation from Silent Records called LOST
LEGION that is really great! And best of all when I opened the CD I found
out that it is made by an italian label called LOST LEGION ALIEN
COLLECTIVE. I found all the Silent Records releases to be the best and more
innovatives when it comes to pure trance/ambient. 
If anyone is interested you can contact me on my email address.
Well I hope to see you all at the next sfraves event!

CIAO A TUTTI!! (hi to everyone!)

Dear All;

	I have but just one comment for Senator Exon; for a person who 
doesn't even have an e-mail address he sure seems to know alot about the 
Internet(sarcastically). What a jerk. If S314 goes through what next; a 
small play scernio:

		Johnny and the Computer Store Owner(CSO)

Setting: Sometime in the future after and if S314 passes

	1. Johnny enters the computer store
	2. (CSO) How can I help you son
	3. (JOH) Well gee sir I want to get a modem for my computer
	4. (CSO) Well son we carry a full line of USrobtics modems; What
speed and features were you looking for.
	5. (JOH) I want one thats really fast and has a fax.
	6. (CSO) Well we have the new 56k with 28.8 fax and thats only $150.
	7. (JOH) Cool I'll take that one; here's the money
	8. (CSO) Could I see some ID son
	9. (JOH) ID ? what for ?
	10. (CSO) Well ever since Senator Exon got his bill S314; and 
the other bills that followed it; you have to be 21 to purchase a modem 
Its for you protection son.
	11. Johnny leaves computer store without a modem.

	(NOT MEANT TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY!!!!!, THIS IS AN ATTEMPT AT HUMOR)

	Please don't let this scerino ever become real; write Senator 
Exon; and tell him in a nice and respectable  way; that he doesn't know his 
ass from a hole in the ground. :) I thought the new goverment was for 
less goverment; sounds like more goverment to me; the ligational aspects 
of this would slow an alreadty stagent court system. Well at least the 
lawyers would have something to do. Isn't personnal injury enough for 
those guys. Sheezze.

Hey all,

Regarding Brian D's post, and all the other stuff on S314:

If you've never had reason to write the government and complain or show 
your feelings on a subject, please do so now.

I've never been one to take the time or effort to tell the pinheads in 
DC how I feel, but his S314 thing is scary!  

So I'm urging everyone to let them know! Here's an annotated list of who 
to yell at:

Senator Jim Exon(D-NE), the guy who wrote it.

Phone: 202-224-4224
Fax: 202-224-5213

and no, he ain't got no email. What's up with that? Some expert!


The bill will go before the Senate Commerce Comittee. Contact:

Senator Larry Pressler (Chairman of the Senate Commerce Comittee) 

email: larry_pressler@pressler.senate.gov


Also, theres a web info site at:

http://www.hooked.net/users/gmccann/freedom.html


Further, a guy named Jack posted a template letter to send to Larry P.
Check your mail and use it!

PLEASE HELP PREVENT S314 FROM PASSING!!!

I've only been online about a month. It doesn't take much to see that 
this bill can easily destroy everything that's been created, not only in our 
community, but the country as well.

I've forwarded most of the s314 stuff on this list to other rave lists, 
friends, employers, professors, and just about everyone on my address list.
Please do the same. If we swamp them with protests soon enough, maybe, 
just maybe they'll get a clue and vote it down. If not.....

Love and respect,

Jonas

I have a question.  there's a record on the "nice and ripe" label called 
rythm construction.  I want it. bad. really bad. but just recently it 
went outta print and the record store here (solid grovves) doesn't have 
it. so I basically wanna know if anyone knows of a record store around 
here that still has any copies or knows of anyone who would like to sell 
theirs.

Resent-From: info-gnu-request@prep.ai.mit.edu

Please read this information--it concerns a bill to give private
companies greatly expanded power over the use of information generated
for the government.  The apparent motivation is to perpetuate the
stranglehold which a single company, Westlaw, has obtained over access
to the records of US court decisions.

This bill is being rushed through the House, in what can only be an
attempt to evade public notice.  Even putting aside whether the bill
itself is a good one, such haste, for an issue which is not an
emergency, constitutes disrespect to the electorate.

The FSF is forwarding this information, which we received through the
CPSR and EFF.

February 7, 1995

We need help from everyone!!!!!!!!  Please distribute this
widely.  jamie love   (love@tap.org, 610/658-0880 or 202/387-

- -    Hearings set for today (Tuesday February 7) on bill
     containing special interest provision for West Publishing.
     Hearings will be held before the subcommittee on "Regulatory
     Affairs."

- -    House republicans have slated quick action on the bill.
     Subcommittee Mark-up is set for thursday and full committee
     mark-up is set for friday.  (Telephone and Fax numbers of
     committee members given below)

- -    House republicans introduce legislation with a section
     requested by West Publishing that will provide sweeping
     changes in federal freedom of information act, and prevent
     federal agencies from creating a public database that use
     the West Publishing page numbers to reference case law.

- -    The "West Provision" would also end its lawsuit with Tax
     Analyst, a Virginia publisher, who is seeking access to the
     Department of Justice JURIS database of court decisions in
     order to put the information into the public domain.  Tax
     Analysts alleges the JURIS database of court decisions are
     subject to FOIA and not protected by copyright.  A victory
     by Tax Analysts in this case will lead to a public domain
     database of federal court decisions.

- -    The West Provision in the legislation would extend far
     beyond West Publishing's struggle to maintain its grip on
     the market for legal information.  It would exclude all
     contractor generated records from the federal Freedom of
     Information Act.  Examples of databases that would be
     affected by provision would be the SEC's EDGAR database and
     the Department of Education ERIC database.

- -    Help needed in removing this special interest provision.
     Telephone and fax numbers for the Subcommittee on Regulatory
     Affairs are given below.

>From best we can determine, the so called "Paperwork Reduction
Act" bill was introduced late yesterday or will be introduced
early today.  We do not have a bill number yet.  There will be a
hearing on today (Tuesday February 7) before the "Subcommittee on
National Economic Growth, Natural Resources, and Regulatory
Affairs," more commonly referred to as the subcommittee on
"Regulatory Affairs."  Subcommittee Mark-up is set for thursday
and full committee (the apparently misnamed Committee on
Government Reform and Oversight) mark-up is set for friday.

A provision in this bill [Section 3518 (f) of the "Chairman's
Mark"] would do the following.

     If any person "adds value" to public information, the
     federal government would not have "any right to obtain,
     collect, acquire, disseminate, use or convert," the
     data, database or information product, or "any method
     used by the person to identify such resulting data,
     databases or information product," except "under terms
     that are expressly agreed to by such person."

This provision is being sold as a simple restatement of the law,
but that is a far from true (or more bluntly, a lie).  The
provision in the bill is so broad that it covers all contractor
performed work on behalf of agencies, and effectively exempts
contractor generated records from the federal Freedom of
Information Act (FOIA).  For example, since LEXIS "adds value" to
the EDGAR database by taking the incomming filings from the
government and putting them in a database, even if the government
had a copy of the database, it could not dissmeinate the records
without the consent of LEXIS.  Likewise, many databases, such as
the Department of Education ERIC database, are largely put
together by private contactors.  Indeed, if Oliver North had used
a private contractor for the White House email system, those
records would appear to be off limits to both FOIA and a
government supeana.  Moreover, the provison would apply even in
cases where the firm did not have a copyright or any other
protectable intellectually property right, a huge change in
federal law.

The provision would specifically apply to an active federal
lawsuit between West Publishing and Tax Analysts, over the
Department of Justice JURIS database.  West Publishing was a
contractor on JURIS, an online system run by the Department of
Justice, which contains several decades of federal court
decisions.  West Publishing is trying to prevent Tax Analysts
from obtaining copies of court decisions contained in the
government's JURIS database.  Tax Analyst believes the records
are subject to FOIA, and not protected by copyright.  If Tax
Analysts (fmi, Tom Field, 703/533-4400 or Eleanor Lewis 301/652-
3453) wins the law suit, which has been very expensive, it plans
to put the data into the public domain, creating a public
database of federal court decisions -- something that West
Publishing is fighting against.  Moreover, the West assertion of
its copyright of legal citations is being challenged in federal
court in New York by Hyperlaw, a small CD-ROM publisher (fmi,
Alan Sugarman, President, 212/877-1371, sugarman@panix.com).  If
Sugarman wins his case, the West provision would prevent the
Department of Justice from using the West citations in a public
database.


     WHAT CAN YOU DO?

We are asking people to send a brief message by fax the members
to the full committee, asking Congress to delete the special
interest provison for West Publishing.

sunday feb 12

i decided to set out early so that i could be sure not to wait in a long,
long line FOREVER in order to get into the free wicked at 1015 sat night. 
sure enough, not long after i arrived a nice fat line evolved behind me as
i waited to get in, circa 10:30.  but around 11 they started letting us
in.  as far as i could tell, nobody after that had to wait long at all.
silly me for thinking i had to get there early.  but i guess the wicked
crew know how to promote, by now. 

the mood was festive and excited. curiously, during the evening, it never 
seemed to get too crowded.  i had always heard over and over about how 
jampacked wicked's get, but this one was beautiful.  just the right # of 
people, i thought.  that is, there was always a place to stand, sit or 
dance as the mood hit. 

in the main room galen started out playing some new stuff, more 
"intellectaul" as someone put it, than his very lively, housey sunset 
sets from last summer.  i enjoyed it very much as it stimulated my 
mind as well as my body.  after that, i'm not sure who played, because i 
hightailed it into the front room because i wanted to hear darkhorse, who 
delivered evolved, beatiful, and very sexy "ambient," a genre of techno 
which defies definition, mysteriously.  

following darkhorse was another dj, who unfortuntely i can't tell you 
much of because i was roaming between the basement...strong beats...and 
the main room..more strong beats.  i was just then  starting to hear more 
hipswiveling housier rhythms and such in this music and was aboslutely 
loving the experience.  

because my psyche was only minimally enhanced i had to chill
out...starting around 3 or so (i know the time thanks to my brand new
indiglo watch, kudos timex megacorp) and that's when robbie hardkiss
started up in the front room..the i suppose ambient space.  his flow was a
little off (but it worked!), perhaps, i thought, but i liked very much the
music he played.  his style offers a shot at transcending the ordinary,
and i felt that i was glimpsing a possible future listening to his set. 
a dream, a good idea, a new twist on a musical theme, these things get me 
going without fail.

the folks at this party, howver, were what made my experience something i
will remmeber with fondness for as long as my brain holds up.  everyone
that i talked to was unabashedly friendly and fun.  and i also want to
say: do you people realize how incredibly fabulous you look when you dance
(or stand around, or whatever...)?  i guess i don't get out
much...(!)...but seeing such expressive, ecstatic dancing, (in the ambient
room (!)),and from EVERYBODY, was a treat for my soul. 

So thank you wicked, for a wonderful evening.

love,

ann

Because I image that their feeling this conservative wave
much more the we are.
------------------

This "conservative wave" is completely manufactured by the "conservative
media" (don't believe the hype about the so-called "liberal media" as there
ain't nothing liberal about it!), and really has more to do with what they
would like to see happening and what they're trying to make happen than it
does with what "WE ARE DOING"... they're hoping to engineer another 1980
style sweep but I don't really think the country is behind them this time.

Watch for lots of great new propaganda; be sure to show it to your
friends; discuss it, understand it, reveal it for what it is...

Hiya All,

Yes, non-rave galore ... I was shocked to see the thing about Apple censoring
anything due to sexual orientation since they are usually so open about things
like that. In this case I think the media has overrun the issue. I forwarded 
that message to an <unnamed>, very high up there and got the following response:

Hi Randall:

Good hearing from you, and I trust you're doing well. Thanks for sending me
the note about Voyager, but the facts are quite different. Apple has not yet
made a decision on whether to bundle this CD, and Voyager knows that. For some
reason, they have chosen to act out this scenario in the press, rather than
talking to us.

We have received a number of customer complaints, i.e., from school districts,
about this CD, and anytime that happens, we review our offerings. My sense is
that most of the complaints don't derive from the subject matter, but rather
relate to the fact that very young children can walk themselves through this
type of CD without adult guidance. Some of the descriptions of abortion (and
this seems to be the key issue) are rather graphic.

Hope this helps, and I hope to see you sometime soon.

Regards,

__________________________________

So, if this is the issue, I do agree that young kids should not be subjected to
graphic representations of abortion, etc. You should, of course, still feel 
free to hug your gay friends ... 8-) ...

So I'm urging everyone to let them know! Here's an annotated list of who
to yell at:

Senator Jim Exon(D-NE), the guy who wrote it.

Phone: 202-224-4224
Fax: 202-224-5213
-------------------------

Call the fascists, it's FUN!!!  I really enjoyed my call, Jim,
was it good for you too?  We should also publicize the names and
number of people in the legislature who oppose this; especially
if they would/were/will run against this guy.  Also show support
for the people in congress who oppose this...

Subject: a lesson in death (not rave related, you buggers!)
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

Some assorted ramblings, been a long time......

Mijos, last thursday the sun shone thru my skylight, illuminating my
cereal, and my chores fell off my mind and a trip to Bolinas materialized. 
Jenny and moi paired up with her rebel dogs, and the little red ball of
death (her b-mer) hurtled up hwy-1's curves towards a day in the sun and
wind.

                             And lucy on my tongue.

A perfect day, then it happened. A dead sea-lion, up on the high tide mark,
immersed in the sand. One of the dogs found it, and rolled oround on it in
ecstasy (go figure the canine pleasures!). And my understanding of it was
for the first time not touched by my grade school sentimentalism, instead I
understood the course of life, and the end is just that. I left a shell and
a colored stone near it, a reminder to myself and an offering the animal's
remains.

Not 5 minutes later, a seagull was found by the dogs, but it was still
alive. Injured, somehow, it couldn't fly, and stumbled and pecked in its
own defense. I ran and kept the dogs from damaging the crippled bird, and
as I picked it up, it knew I was no threat, that I had only the desire to
keep it from being mauled or drowned.

It sat in the sand, as I did, and we looked at each other for an hour. What
to do? The nature center was far away, and the bird was breathing heavy and
slow. I worked at one in Memphis, and this ird had no broken bones. They
would put it in a hot box and hope for recovery. But this bird had a wound
in its chest, looked like a buck-shot had pierced its sternum, and the
blood stained its feathers brown.

And I understood. Finally. We live our lives in denial, that we never age,
tie is our friend, we never die, it will happen to them, not to me.

This brid, this seal, live with death every day. They eat their fish, they
kill it, they go to the source. We use money. I got this paper, I give it
to the man at the counter, he sells me flesh. He in turn got the flesh from
someone else, for a lesser amount of paper. We seperate ourselves from the
source.

The bird, the seal, they know the source, and may become the source any
day. Like this day. They have no illusions, and they live with it every
second of their lives. Are they prepared?

The bird would not become a toy for all the dogs on this beach. The dogs
were contaminated by us, they were removed from the source. So I placed the
bird on a high point, hidden away from the dogs, but fully in the warmth of
the sun. It didn't try to run from me. It knew what I was up to.

It left this world safely and alone. Its own existence prepared it for this day.

A little boy walked with an older woman. Sometimes he would cling to her.
Sometimes he would run away and stare at the sea. As the wind died down, I
could hear him cry, sometimes he would cry in silence, no air left to
expell. This went on for an hour. Bad news, of some extreme sort, was being
dealt with. 

As I walked back past the seal, and saw where I left the bird, I wondered
what I will do when I am to leave. What will I do when I lose a friend?

I hope that bird told me enough.

We have received a number of customer complaints, i.e., from school districts,
about this CD, and anytime that happens, we review our offerings. My sense is
that most of the complaints don't derive from the subject matter, but rather
relate to the fact that very young children can walk themselves through this
type of CD without adult guidance. Some of the descriptions of abortion (and
this seems to be the key issue) are rather graphic.
-------------------------

I really don't think this matters much; the issue is still the same, will
Apple buckle under right wing pressure or not?  We'll be waiting...

Mijos, friday's 1015 (dubtribe, zendada,dakota): trip and a half!

Main room not set up yet, due to a hole in the floor, led me behind curtain
number 2, where disco and 80's rule! Lucky-star (Madonna) followed by Funky
Town, and gyrating hips powered by beer and collins glass cocktails.
Amusing to watch, but these guys were DRUNK. Tanked, pickled, blotto, and
very suburban.

So a frat boy sees my sailor suit and punches me in the arm (that male
bonding thing) and then lurches into the wall. People standing in the
doorway to the main room. People stumbling and pushing. Never has it been
so difficult to move around, let alone dance. Gringos can't handle their
liquor. Nuf sed.

A shame, I feel, to see Tracy and DubTribe perform for a crowd like this.
By 2 there was a mad rush for the bar, followed by the lay law (2am, alone?
Pick the closest body!) Not my cup of E :)
Reminds me why I hate clubs.The Doc was awesome, played a bunch of old,
predictable stuff, but hey, got my dancing fix. Followed by all-star
donuts, the hallmark of any good nite.

Wicked had an awesome chill room, good crowd, variety, same space, and
ins-n-outs. A marvel! Now, if we could work on that age thing......:)

Good to see some happy faces, and to spend my money on donuts and milk this
weekend.

Lotsa love,
 Milton and the E-Bee......

i hate to use the info-highway cliche, but...

  if the senator proposing this bill doesn't have e-mail access,
    it's to be assumed he's not really familiar with the internet.

  isn't that kind of like writing a traffic law without knowing
    how to drive a car?

  shouldn't the senator at least take upon himself the responsibility
    of plumbing the net's depths a bit himself before trying to
     control it?

am i being naieve?iaieive?

Um... If Apple's customers don't want something, why should Apple keep
supplying it to those customers? The schools that want to _CAN_ purchase
it for their own use. It's not like Apple is putting some code into it's
operating system to prevent an application from running (unlike an unnamed
other major OS company.)

Um... If Apple's customers don't want something, why should Apple keep
supplying it to those customers?
---------------

As long as the fundamentalists who DON'T want it available can't prevent
others who DO want it, then there's no problem.  Problem is, that's rarely
what they want; they're usually up to their ears in trying to control other
peoples media...



The schools that want to _CAN_ purchase
it for their own use. It's not like Apple is putting some code into it's
operating system to prevent an application from running (unlike an unnamed
other major OS company.)
-----------------------

One would hope not, but I'll wait and see before I make up my mind...

So a frat boy sees my sailor suit and punches me in the arm (that male

Hah!  Frat boys, you gotta love 'em... ever see that Beavis and Butthead

  if the senator proposing this bill doesn't have e-mail access,
    it's to be assumed he's not really familiar with the internet.

  isn't that kind of like writing a traffic law without knowing
    how to drive a car?

  shouldn't the senator at least take upon himself the responsibility
    of plumbing the net's depths a bit himself before trying to
     control it?

am i being naieve?iaieive?
----------------------

No, not at all, it's a control (-freak) type of issue; some people are
afraid of things they don't control.  Those people are usually fairly
dangerous...

Hi Milton,

Thanx for sharing your experience with us.  It's been almost exactly a year 
ago that we here in the Seattle lost a good friend in a very tragic incident 
at the Choc-Lit Factory.  The bird's wisdom was presented to us in  a 
different light under different circumstances.  Yet wisdom is wisdom.  As 
hard as the lessons are at times, I remain grateful and in awe of the 
universe around us and within us.  I think that the relationship of your 
story with raving is not so far off.  We cannot fully appreciate/celebrate 
life without acknowledging death.  We cannot be truly happy without knowing 
sorrow.  Only through a balanced understanding of the positive and negative 
elements around us (and again, within) can we effectively channel the 
energies that we come in contact with into a pure expression of who we 
really are.

Peace

Tigger

Date: Monday, February 13, 1995 11:30AM

Some assorted ramblings, been a long time......

Mijos, last thursday the sun shone thru my skylight, illuminating my
cereal, and my chores fell off my mind and a trip to Bolinas materialized.
Jenny and moi paired up with her rebel dogs, and the little red ball of
death (her b-mer) hurtled up hwy-1's curves towards a day in the sun and
wind.

                             And lucy on my tongue.

A perfect day, then it happened. A dead sea-lion, up on the high tide mark,
immersed in the sand. One of the dogs found it, and rolled oround on it in
ecstasy (go figure the canine pleasures!). And my understanding of it was
for the first time not touched by my grade school sentimentalism, instead I
understood the course of life, and the end is just that. I left a shell and
a colored stone near it, a reminder to myself and an offering the animal's
remains.

Not 5 minutes later, a seagull was found by the dogs, but it was still
alive. Injured, somehow, it couldn't fly, and stumbled and pecked in its
own defense. I ran and kept the dogs from damaging the crippled bird, and
as I picked it up, it knew I was no threat, that I had only the desire to
keep it from being mauled or drowned.

It sat in the sand, as I did, and we looked at each other for an hour. What
to do? The nature center was far away, and the bird was breathing heavy and
slow. I worked at one in Memphis, and this ird had no broken bones. They
would put it in a hot box and hope for recovery. But this bird had a wound
in its chest, looked like a buck-shot had pierced its sternum, and the
blood stained its feathers brown.

And I understood. Finally. We live our lives in denial, that we never age,
tie is our friend, we never die, it will happen to them, not to me.

This brid, this seal, live with death every day. They eat their fish, they
kill it, they go to the source. We use money. I got this paper, I give it
to the man at the counter, he sells me flesh. He in turn got the flesh from
someone else, for a lesser amount of paper. We seperate ourselves from the
source.

The bird, the seal, they know the source, and may become the source any
day. Like this day. They have no illusions, and they live with it every
second of their lives. Are they prepared?

The bird would not become a toy for all the dogs on this beach. The dogs
were contaminated by us, they were removed from the source. So I placed the
bird on a high point, hidden away from the dogs, but fully in the warmth of
the sun. It didn't try to run from me. It knew what I was up to.

It left this world safely and alone. Its own existence prepared it for this
day.

A little boy walked with an older woman. Sometimes he would cling to her.
Sometimes he would run away and stare at the sea. As the wind died down, I
could hear him cry, sometimes he would cry in silence, no air left to
expell. This went on for an hour. Bad news, of some extreme sort, was being
dealt with.

As I walked back past the seal, and saw where I left the bird, I wondered
what I will do when I am to leave. What will I do when I lose a friend?

I hope that bird told me enough.

Thomas was in Portland, Oregon playing at a show with Doc; they had a
snowstorm Sunday morning, quite a bit different than down here.  Wicked's
sound system is better suited for tight spaces like the basement.  If you
heard the bass during parts of Markie's set then you know what I mean.

well you're not getting it from me...i smoke about 2 cigarettes a week 
right now (i "quit" for new years) and usually smoke both of them at 
raves...i love to smoke and dance at the same time--we need good 
ventilation in those places ANYWAY--when i couldn't breathe in the 
basement of 1015 the other night it was because the air was saturated 
with sweat and had already been inhaled and exhaled to the point of 
complete uselessness....i hate alcohol probably about as much as you hate 
cigarettes, and true it does piss me off when it gets in my way at raves, 
but shit--we've all got different reasons for coming to raves, and imho 
that's a huge part of what makes it special.......but i ever wave a 
cigarette in your face i hope you will say hi and ask me nicely to move 
the smoke away from you because i certainly very happily will... :)  jessica

If your value system is such that "quality" means "more protein"!

(It seems to me that people who enjoy eating from the upper-emd of 
the food chain sometimes need reminding that their values are not necessarily 
universal)

Thanks, jase, for your informed view...this is not meant to flame, 
just an observation I want to share.

Please consider that second hand smoke very directly jeapordizes the 
health of the people around you. Someone drinking alcohol near you 
will not very directly violate your health (of course the alcohol 
consumer's behavior might, but that's a different topic altogether). 
Unless the people arond your smoke have previously consented to 
breathing your second hand smoke, you are passively violating the 
health of those people around you. I think it's extremely rude...I 
even thought this type of thing was rude and unjustified when I was a 
smoker, so I'd only smoke in places where my smoke would not directly 
effect anyone around me...but then I had to realize that every smoke 
does have an effect on somebody because it contributes to the smog 
layer. and then I quit smoking for entirlely selfish reasons :)

Brian, could you please amend the global rave database area option to 
reflect a more inclusice view of reality.

Regions of the planet not included:
Africa
South/Central America
Oceania
India/Asia

I believe the above additions will allow all those ravers in the rest of 
the planet for example Goa and Johannesburg to register their events. I 
trust this is just a small oversight and not an ideological stand?

Also, the higher on the food chain, the higher the concentration of
toxins, mutagens, carcinogens, caused by our somewhat lax
laws&practices on dumping and pollution.

Recently, for example, there were health department warnings that
people fishing in the SF Bay should avoid eating more than 2 fish per
month  due to dangerous concentrations of toxins.

Also, this is one of the reasons why you should never eat a tobacco
smoker.

I personally don't mind people smoking at raves, as long as they aren't
smoking tobacco. I would love to see more raves (also concerts, bars,
etc) where tobacco smoking was strictly prohibited and strongly
enforced.

The thing that I really hate about smokers is that they feel it is
their right to make you smell their putrid stench. And they get all
huffy and pissed off (as if their innate rights to be bothersome were
being violated) when told to smoke elsewhere, or when they're told the
law prohibits smoking in restaurants.

When I plan to be somewhere for a long time,  I very carefully analyse
people around me who might be smokers.    I look for lighters,  packs,
or other telltale signs of tobacco smoking things.   I simply avoid
those areas.   It is when a smoker invades my breathing space,  is
what I normally object to.    Naturally,  they don't intend to cause
any harm,   they just don't realize what they are doing.   The real
bummer is that I have to take expensve anti-allergy medication to
counter effect the smoke.    It works very good.    I don't get sick
while in smokey room as long as I am able to breath fresh air every
20 minutes if possible.   Thus the need to go outside every once in
a while.   Unfortunately,  it's VERY EXPENSIVE...   about $10 to $20
depending on quantity.    I consume about 2 capsels for 4 raves.
Thats why I like consecutive raving... :-)  So, to all you smokers out
there,  us non smokers only want you to be more aware of where you
hold your cigerette.    Just a few feet can make ALL the difference.
Direct smoke causes me ITENSE PAIN if any gets directly in my eyes.

Nuff said, My $.02

:-)  

Please note....  I didn't bring up this subject....  :-)

One handy hint for smokers that's obvious, but really works; use those 
pacifiers... it really cuts down on the amount you want to smoke.
\the only trouble is , when you finally do smoke you end up biting through
the filter which can be embarrassing, especially if you're in the middle of getting
a backrub :-). 

The real trouble is, once you start smoking at a rave, it's really hard to
stop, especially if everyone else in the group is smoking. The best solution
is to have an area that's either really well ventilated, or exposed to
the great outdoors. Babylon in Greensboro keeps the big fire-escape doors 
open, and has some couches and chairs nearby, but out of the escape route. 
Definitely a good place to go for those oxygen restriction moments.

\Oh, almost forgot... aparently ephedrine can also be used as an allergy 
medicine. Seems a bit of a waste though.

actually i think by going into a rave (or a bar or a club) you are 
choosing to take the health risk involved in breathing second hand smoke 
for a few hours...  which by the way is miniscule compared to the 
cumulative effects of car exhaust, industrial waste, and chemically 
treated produce...i think it is up to each of us to make responsible 
choices about things like cars, cigarettes, beef, etc, but we also have 
to live together and respect each others' imperfections and lapses of 
social responsibility...i just threw away an aluminum can this morning 
and now i have to smile at ten strangers to make up for the lost karma 
points...take care*jessica
ps seriously though if there were a non-smoking rave i would be psyched 
i wonder what it would be like though

I won't be able to make the Universe in May, but I do have a general
interest in visiting London, etc. to get an exposure to the scene.  I
definitely would rather go over there well armed with party knowledge than
to play it by ear.

Does anyone know if there is a bulletin for the London area that would be
akin to SFRaves?

Thanks - Happy Valentines Day - 

Paul

Here are some interesting statistics about smoking and second-hand
smoke. They're from Larry Laudan's "The Book of Risks: Fascinating 
facts About the Chances We take Every Day" At the very end are a few 
tips for conscientious smokers. Enjoy!

SMOKING (NONSMOKERS MAY WANT TO SKIP TO INFO ON SECONDARY SMOKE):

Among men, smokers are twice as likely to die prematurely as nonsmokers.
More generally, if you smoke a pack of cigarettes a day, you run about 
a 70% greater chance of dying this year than nonsmokers of your age and sex.

The proportion of cancer deaths linked to smoking: 30%

Most prople (roughly 4 out of 5) who get lung cancer are smokers
or former smokers. All the same, most smokers and former smokers never
develop lung cancer. (About 1 in every 250 smokers or former smokers 
develops lung cancer each year.)

Among nonsmokers, men are 30-50% more likely to develop lung cancer than 
women. But among heavy smokers, women may run twice the risk of lung 
cancer that men do. (This latter claim is still contested by some 
researchers.)

Cigarette smokers have a higher incidence than nonsmokers of 
cancers of the lungs, larynx, esophagus, bladder, pancreas, kidney 
and lip.

Smoking two packs of cigarettes daily is 10 times more life 
threatening than usual levels of cigar smoking and 14 times more
dangerous than usual levels of pipe smoking.

Smokers are 1000% more likely to develop chronic emphysema and 
chronic bronchitis than nonsmokers.

White men and women smoke cigarettes in roughly 
equal numbers. Black men are 50% more likely to smoke than black women.

Those teenagers who try smoking are 16 times more likely to smoke
as adults than those who do not.

Women who smoke are likely to have menopause 1-2 years earlier 
than those who don't smoke.

Older smokers have a lower rate of Alzheimer's disease than nonsmokers 
of comparable ages.

A smoker is twice as likely to commit suicide as a nonsmoker.

The average american consumes 2500 cigarettes a year. Because most do not
smoke at all, the use of cigarettes among smokers themselves is more 
than double this figure. (doing the math: 2500/year=7.02 cigarettes/day;
so an average smoker smokes about 15-17 cigarettes/day).

Your odds of stopping smoking on the first attempt: less than 20%

Many smokers will attempt to stop but fewer than 50% will succeed,
even after repeated attempts.

Smokers who quit smoking before age 50 run 1/2 the risk of dying in the 
next fifteen years as those who continue smoking.

Longtime smokers who quit gain about 5 lbs. on average; 1 in 20 
quitters gains 20 lbs. 

The state with the highest per capita loss of life due to smoking: 
Kentucky. The state with the lowest loss of life: Utah, where fewer 
than one in seven adults smokes.

Men are most likely to smoke in alaska. women are most likely to 
smoke in Nevada. Although men are more likely to smoke than women,
Oregonian women outsmoke their male counterparts.

SECOND-HAND SMOKE

The risk that you will develop a fatal cancer this year caused by 
exposure to secondary tobacco smoke: 1 in 80,000. This is roughly the
same risk as that of dying from accidental poisoning.

Paraphrased: smoking tobacco is the second greatest causer of cancer in 
America. The greatest: poor diet.

Drinking two glasses of milk a day poses a greater risk of death 
from cancer than a lifetime of exposure to secondary smoking.

If you keep a pet bird at home, you are 500% more likely to get lung 
cancer than you are from exposure to secondary smoke.

Eating a smoked pork chop once a week is twice as likely to kill 
you as secondary smoke will.

If you are exposed to secondary smoke but eat green spinach once a week,
you are less likely to die of cancer than if you are never exposed to 
smoke and eat no spinach.

Driving a small car rather than a large one is much more likely to 
kill you than a lifetime of exposure to secondary smoke.

All of the following substances carry possible human carcinogens, i.e. 
they produce tumors in rodents when administered in massive doses.
(This is the leading method that both the EPA and the Center for 
Disease Control use to determine the carcinogenicity of substances.)  
Importantly, the carcinogenicity is not due to any additives or pesticide
residues; it occurs naturally in the substance or its production:

Bacon, booze, bread, Broccoli, Cabbage, Celery, Coffee, Colas, 
Cooked meats, Figs, Fruit, Milk, Mushrooms, Mustard, Parsley, 
Parsnips, Peanuts, Pepper, Shrimp, Strawberries, Tap water (chloroform from 
chlorine), Tea (herbal)

Food for thought-

Jocelyn

p.s. tips for conscientious smokers: don't smoke on the dance floor.
if there are ins and outs, take it outside-unless there's some 
other prohibitive element to going outside; e.g. unsafe area, 
secret, non-permitted location that prohibits loitering, an hour 
wait in line to get back inside. If you're going to smoke inside-
find the least trafficed area around the bar- smoke there. Find 
someone near the bar (not at- nonsmokers need water too) who is 
already smoking. chances are, the area is already clear of those 
who do not wish to be exposed. Lastly, if anyone who is not 
smoking is within an arms length of you, take a step over to him/her 
and ask him/her if it would bother him/her. Put your cigarette out in 
an ashtray or carry the butt (unlit) to a trashcan.

  NO.  Despite recent restrictions on smoking, it is still legal to do so in 
clubs.  If you want no smoking in bars and clubs, get some signatures, put in 
some effort, and get a law passed.  In other words, get off of your whiny 
little ass, and do something about it.  No smoking in restaurants, fine.  If 
the community passes the law, I will abide by it.  Until then, in clubs, no 
dice. 
 
  When was the last time you mentioned to any event promoter, "Gee, we really 
ought to have some nice, ventilated room somewhere where the smokers can go 
and chill without feeling like second class citizens.".  Or has you attitude 
been, "Make them all stand outside in the cold and the rain and have them 
freeze their smoky little butts off.". 
 
  I try to be considerate about my smoking.  If there is some designated or 
preferred area where I can take my drink, and have a cigarette without 
bothering other people, I am happy to do so.  What bothers most smokers is 
when we are chastised, ridiculed, and harassed for doing something that is 
LEGAL to do, and when people want to make NO provisions for us to do so. 
 
  Remember, we live in a country where people shoot doctors for performing 
legal operations.  If it is legal, either change the law or shut up.

actually i think by going into a rave (or a bar or a club) you are
choosing to take the health risk involved in breathing second hand smoke
for a few hours...
------------------

yeah, let's get real people, I generally assume that I'll be coming
into contact with (among other things) the unknown when I go out.  Sure
it's nice to avoid cigarette smoke and I agree that the smokers (I'm *not*
a smoker, except at raves, go figure, for some reason I really want to smoke
at raves...) should be considerate about where they smoke vis a vis proper
ventilation, etc., but I really have to wonder what planet you think you're
on if you're doing e and complaining about 2nd hand smoke.  Especially if
you're doing e every week or more, I'd say you're in greater risk from the
complex amphetamines than from cigarette smoke...  I hear the complaints
and I'd like to see people cooperate on it, but outlawing this or that; I
ain't with it.  I think that smokers *should* be considerate and smoke in
"the right kinds of places" (i.e. outside, or not where there's no ventilation,
etc.), but I wouldn't want to see "no smoking" at raves in general as I think
that's going too far.  just my 2...

tips for conscientious non-smokers: go dance somewhere else ;^)

I think sweaty guys with no shirts and a lack of deodorant are
dangerous to my health and if one of em starts dancing near me
I Move Somewhere Else ...

And if the whole place is filled with em I Leave The Party ...

Personally, I think ravers and housey folks are about the Most 
conscientious smokers you'll find anywhere and all this preaching
is being directed at the choir ... 

Under most circumstances we All know that so 
much space is gonna be Shared so all this health concern
is a Mute Point - you're there by Choice - it boils down to how well
we respect each other In That Space.  There is no respect if you adopt
some bullshit moral high ground about who should move cuz of who's
behavior is the most harmful.  We're talking strictly about an
issue of personal comfort at a party - what have you done to
make yourself comfortable before you decide to share your
problems with me?

i used to drink
 i used to smoke
  i used to dance the hoochy coo

I've never seen uptight non-smokers in a huff at a hiphop
party ... maybe there's a lesson there about Vibe and Respect

what is legal or illegal is really irrelevant...

E.g., it's not illegal for u to allow smoke from ur fag to drift into my face..
		but it's not cool!
E.g., it would not normally be considered illegal for u to get shitfaced
and puke on me... 
		but it's not cool!
E.g., it's not illegal to bring a whistle to a rave and blow it non-stop
with no neat matching or rythm...
		but it sure as hell ain't cool!

So all I'm asking is:
		be cool.. that's all!

Subject:The Premierian Estates

Howdy People,

For those that couldn't get through the other day to order "The Premierian
Estates,"  the Funk Junkies informed me that you can now order 24 hours at
1-800-291-3014 Visa/Master. This tape will still be offered for $9 including
shipping.

For those who don't know, "The Premierian Estates" is an album collection of
11 rave/house/disco/funk groove released in Illinois by my newly formed label,
Black Raven.  This album recieved good PR and sales and I'm offering the
remaining copies to anyone whose interested in hearing some good Chicago dance
music.It is availiable on Digalog-cassettes only...

About me, I was raised in the Chicago house and new wave scene and specializes
in creating funky groove tracks that utilizes secret experimental techniques
passed on to me by many of the legendary Trackmasterz in the Windy City. My
style of music can be best describe as Lil Louis type tracks with a New Order
atmosphere....

If you like, I'm still willing to FTP some .au samples of this album to your
site and hopefully, I can get them archived at hyperreal.com soon....

Please e-mail me if you wish to mail-order or have any questions....

Peace,
Zheam

Need help checking some facts on the California scene:

Is there a curfew for under 18 year olds? I remember there being some

How many arrests were made in the New Years Eve bust of The Other New Years

Has anyone a copy of the headline story?

I used to smoke and that, I'm sure, did me a lot more harm. 
I just don't like smoke wafting into my face... that's all.
It's just damned uncomfortable.

I guess anytime people talk about "groups" and not about individuals, it's 
pretty easy to get phreaked out.  Smokers are not all alike.  Blacks are not

Subject: Smoking the Status Quo
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com

here's my 2cents on the smoking thing.

(and let the record state that I'm not a smoker)

Way back in the 50s, the US conducted a number of above ground nuclear
tests that managed to distribute radioactive plutonium into the earths
atmosphere. Turns out, that the best way to absorb plutonium is via the
respiratory system. So without our consent, a large part of the population
were exposed to significant amounts of radiation. Couple this with the
airborne introduction of other radioactive products as a result of -
uranium mining, poor safety controls (for instance in one case a couple of
rusting barrels o' plutonium remained outside one facility for years
increasing atmospheric radiation levels over new york state), accidentl
releases, scheduled radiation releases and degausing from powerplants and
such like.

We end up in the situation today, where the liklihood of lung carcenomas
has been significantly increased.  Now it is relatively easy to see where
this is heading - increased liablity by the Federal government for
instances of lung cancer, except for one problem: cancer does not carry
with it a flag saying "i was made by this particular carcinogin" So we see
the rise of attempts to pin the increase in cancers on other factors in the
population - hence the idea of "secondary smoke" as if this one single
factor should be responsible -, as one epidemologist working on pollution
control told me, "its the stuff you can't see that's the problem"  Of
course, the interesting thing is this - Smokers are more likely to get lung
cancer, as their resporatory systems are already stressed. I investigated a
story once regarding the effects of increased air pollution and asked a
state health official who it was that would most likely be affected: his
answer - the very young and the very old and those with a pre-exhisting
lung condition.  Couple this with the fact that kids nowadays have a
greater likelhood of being born with asthma and bronchial problems, and we
have all the makings of a great skapegoat - the tobacco industry. The point
that I am making is not that smokers are to blame, but that this is a
secondary catalyst for health and allergy problems in an already stressed
invironment. One has only to thing of the WW11 generation smoking 100s of
cigarettes a day without filters or low tar/low nicotine and living to ripe
old ages to wonder if there's something wrong with the humans circa 1990?

Another  unnerving prospect of all this anti-smoking stuff is the likelhood
that smoking itself will be banned causing all pot-smokers to stick out
like sore thumbs - then the mere lighting of something and toking on it
gives the cops reasonable cause for arrest - without the hitch of having to
first establish that its marijauna being smoked - imagine being spotted by
an infrared telescopic sight smoking in the privacy of your apartment -
doors gets broken down and the police arrive - yep its america post-1994
(Orwell was only out by ten years)

Dear Sfraves;

	With all the talk about smoking I just had to tell you all about
how I quit smoking cig's in 1982 and never went back. I will celabrate 13
years this September. I quit cold turkey; almost. At that point in my life
I was smoking both cig's and other substances(wink wink) ok weed;  for
those who didn't fiqure it out. I wanted to give up at least one of them
and since I didn't get much head satisfaction out of tobacco cig's I
decided that they where the one to go. I was smoking about a pack of
Marboro Red's a day; and at that time cig's were approaching a $1.00/pack.
First I said to myself that I would never pay a $1.00 for a pack of cig's;
I also did it before I started college; because I knew the pressure of an
engineering cirriculum would only tax and tempt me to smokem. So while
over summer break; one day I just put them dowmn and never went back. So
whats the secret; when I just couldn't stand it anymore; I mean when I was
absolutey nuts after putting it off and putting it off; thats the urge to
smoke; I would smoke a joint. It worked; the key is that when you get the
urge say to youself that; I'll wait an hour or a half hour and then smoke
a cig. Most of the time just by putting it off I would either get busy doing
something or forget about it.  But I always knew that if it just got to
bad; that I could smoke a joint.  Also; for at least the first six months
you can't even smoke one. If you have to smoke; smoke a joint; it helps
will the craving and it gives you a reward for not smoking a cig; a very
nice reward if I do say so my self. Also; don't get drunk; your resistance
will drop like a rock if you drink and you will me right back where you
started smoking cig's for what are they now $2.75/pack. God; I can't tell
you how glad I am that I quit;  and no I don't smoke grass continuously; I
only smoke occassionally for obbvoius reasons. It changed my life in a
positive way; and I wish each and evryone of you good luck. Also; when you
quit get rid of all your ashtrayes and cig reminders; this is also
helpful. If your tring to quit be kind to youself; go out and get a
massage or a good meal; love and reward yourself; look in the mirror and
tell youself that you are a great and wonderful person because you have
quit for x number of days.  Affirmations are very important; write them
down and put them on your bathroom mirror; and if you fall be kind to
youself as well; you are human and you are allowed to make mistakes; just
pick up where you left off. if you have no one in you life to tell you
that your wonderful let me know because I'm wonderful and your no
different than me; so I'll tell ya. WE ARE ALL FANTASTIC AND DESERVE LOVE
AND A GOOD LIFE SO DON'T POISON YOURSELF WITH CIG'S; ARE MAKER DIDN'T MAKE
TRASH;  THE HUMAN BODY IS A FANTASTIC LIVING THING; YOU ARE YOUR CELLS;
EACH CELL IS A BASIC LIVING ORGANISM. So love yourself and again if you
can't let me know; your worth it no matter what anyone else said's. I 
know this in my heart without ever having met you because again your no 
different than me; and I'm wonderful.

I'm a loving and wonderful person who fills the world with joy everywhere 
I go

I will take time to notice a rainbow; and notice how beautiful and free 
we both are

I am loved by my friends all over the world; and forever in their hearts 
and minds

I will take the time to hold a child and notice the wonder of new life 
and remember that I was once and still am this way; innocent and 
beautiful

  I try to be considerate about my smoking.  If there is some designated or
preferred area where I can take my drink, and have a cigarette without
bothering other people, I am happy to do so.  What bothers most smokers is
when we are chastised, ridiculed, and harassed for doing something that is
LEGAL to do, and when people want to make NO provisions for us to do so.
---------------

I have to agree, even though I'm not really a smoker.  It also seems to
have a "fashion" component; you don't see people complaining about other
things that are also health threatening, but it's currently all the rage
to bitch about smoking... whatever...

I know that commercial postings are in general frowned upon, so I am
only going to do this once.  I figured this might be of some general
interest to sfraves because we are providing an incredibly inexpensive 
way to get some local San Francisco techno.

This is the introductory edition of the Ultra Violet online newsletter.
Future editions of the newsletter will be *much* shorter than this first
edition and will not be posted to sfraves.  To be added to our mailing list,
send mail to mw@ultraviolet.com and we will add you.  We will send out a new
newsletter whenever we have new releases to announce (every few months or so).

--- Who We Are ---

Founded in 1994, San Francisco-based Ultra Violet Recordings was
formed to release high-quality, technologically-innovative electronic
music.  The label carries compact discs, vinyl 12" singles and
select integrated media products.  Ultra Violet seeks to showcase
the talents of artists who compose complex psycho-acoustic listening
experiences.  From dance to ambient, and dub to experimental, UVR
spans a vast sonic spectrum.

Ultra Violet Recordings is a collaboration between former Ultraviolet
Catastrophe members Mike Wertheim and Jeff Taylor.  In addition to
co-founding UVR, Mike was also responsible for starting Twitch, the
successful techno remix service.  Jeff Taylor, too elusive to interview,
was once quoted as saying, "Yes, I am Pink."


--- Submitting demo tapes ---

If you would like to submit a demo tape to UVR, please mail it to us at
this address:

Demo tapes will not be returned.


--- The Ultraviolet Catastrophe ---

The Ultraviolet Catastrophe (UVC) was a three-person studio project,
consisting of Jon Drukman, Jeff Taylor and Mike Wertheim.  UVC released a
chart-topping 12" single called "The Trip" on Twitch Records in the spring
of 1992.  "The Trip" was re-released in 1993 by Hardkiss Music, with remixes
done by Jon Williams.  The Ultraviolet Catastrophe also did a number of
remixes for Twitch Remix Service in 1992 and 1993.

The Ultraviolet Catastrophe disbanded in 1994.  Jon went on to start up his 
own studio, while Mike and Jeff went on to form Ultra Violet Recordings.
Jeff is currently creating music under the name Deluxe.

Ultra Violet Recordings has re-released the original Twitch version of
"The Trip".  Here is the catalog information for "The Trip"...

	Ultraviolet Catastrophe - "The Trip" (vinyl 12" single)
	catalog number UVR-01-01-1

	track	time	bpm	title
	A1	7:30	125	"The Trip"
	B1	8:30	125	"Trip Harder"

Rumor has it that some new remixes of "The Trip" are planned for release
on Ultra Violet later this year.


--- Deluxe ---

Deluxe is the solo project of former UVC member Jeff Taylor.  Ultra Violet
has released a full-length CD by Deluxe, titled Let the Magic Flow.  Ultra
Violet has also released one 12-inch single from Deluxe, titled "Futura".

--- URB Magazine review of Deluxe CD ---

>From URB Magazine, Issue #39.  Review by Tamara Palmer.

Deluxe - Let the Magic Flow (Ultra Violet Recordings)  

Deluxe is the first full-length solo project from San Francisco's Jeff
Taylor, a man otherwise known for his work in the trippy trio The
Ultraviolet Catastrophe and for the standout track on Silent's From Here to
Tranquility compilation, "Diaphanous" by The Dark Beautiful.  A long time in
creation, Taylor's opus is a tribute to the many musical influences that has
shaped his life, from dub to electro, and from advanced electronic head
music to the perfectly structured pop songs of Stock-Aitken-Waterman.

All of these genres and more are explored on Let the Magic Flow, making for
a very elastic, free-form work as a whole.  A piece never lingers in one
spot for long and always flows into the next track.  For the club-oriented
minds, there are two tracks in particular that stand out.   "Freestyle" is
for the harder techno crowd and "Eluxtria" is much more playful and housey.
Though these are geared towards the dancefloor, most other tracks are
intended for a more private listen.  Even in the more personal setting, the
moods are forever conflicting.  "Futura", for example, is aggressive and
robotic with its vocoded sounds, while "Sapphire" is gentle and melodic with
a passionate male vocal.  The most finely crafted track is called
"Snowcrash" which is at times chilling yet always driving in a Kraftwerkian
sort of fashion.

Deluxe's strength is found in the determination to probe varying types of
sounds within a structured, contained unit.  There is a sense of progression
in each track, which is not always a common trait in electronic music.
Enlisting the talented help of artists such as Young American Primitive and
Exist Dance's Mike Kandel for remix treatment on the album's singles, Deluxe
surrounds himself in good company.  He is earning his place there.

I hear a lot of complaints about lots of health threatening issues, 
what's more is that I see people who are dissatisfied with a 
situation and they'll go a step further than mere complaint in an 
attempt to change a situation / make more people aware of the impact 
of their actions

yeah, whatever. It's easier to not care, eh?

I can't say that I agree, but I'm kinda sick o' the topic as I'm sure 
so many others on the list are...BUT you've got a good point here 
that I hadn't considered...maybe this is the reason that I can't

this is definitely non-rave related.

it is, tho, important to anyone who believes in freedom of music!

KNAC, pure rock 105.5 in Long Beach, is going off the air at 2pm today,
  after nine years of playing music that the more pedestrian, yuppified,
    playlist-oriented radio stations have abhorred.  they were first to
      make metallica a major radio presence, they debuted alice in chains,
        and basically played any record which had an "explicit lyrics"
          tipper gore label on it; at KNAC those were considered badges
            of honor.
long mimicked by stations all over the country, KNAC persisted and led
  the pack of heavymetal/hard rock stations, never straying into the
    classic rock dinosaur vein, or the computer-programmed playlist.
      KNAC t-shirts can be spotted at clubs in europe and japan, their
        bumper stickers are displayed prominently on cars all over LA.
the point i'm trying to make is that this is one of the LAST TRUE
  INDEPENDENT voices of music on the airwaves, unfettered by coporate
    greed and unblindered by "politically correct" social mores.
we are ALL losing some of our freedom today.
  we are ALL losing some of our freedom today.
    we are ALL losing some of our freedom today.
      we are ALL losing some of our freedom today.
        we are ALL losing some of our freedom today.

I wonder if I ate a raver if I would get a residual E high...
Eat two or three and I could save $20 next time I go out. :)

Here are some interesting statistics about smoking and second-hand
smoke. They're from Larry Laudan's "The Book of Risks: Fascinating 
facts About the Chances We take Every Day"

>If you are exposed to secondary smoke but eat green spinach once a week,
>you are less likely to die of cancer than if you are never exposed to 
>smoke and eat no spinach.

Here's the answer: The smokers should get together and set-up a spinach
stand next to the DJ.

Well,   I suppose that the FMR didn't get off the ground,  or was
I dropped off the phone tree.    A friend phoned me up and said it
was going to be in Berkeley,  so we drive down there,  unsucessfully.

We go by MOVE really late (After about 2:30,  but didn't want to
pay $5 to get in,   just to learn where it was.   Couldn't see anyone
who knew.   After that,  we went by the old 24th and Illinois site,
but also empty.  

So,  did the FMR actually come off?    If so,   please post a report.

Thanx

 why are they going off the air?  I definitely agree that media

so I'm wondering what put them under?

Dear Sfraves;

	Lastnight which was Valentine's day I went out to see Robert Rich
Live. I didn't know anything about him before I went; but I was very
pleased at what I heard. He was really good; he started off each new song
by playing what looked like some type of electronic flute; pretty neat. 
He would play several notes and then do things with those sounds to create
a very daring; intellectually stimulating, & moving ambient soundscape. I
didn't stay for the whole show because it was Tuesday Night; and I was
sick with that vicious resilient bonchitis that going around. I wish I had
though because it was really cool; I was just able to float along with the
music in and out of some pretty heavy thought processies; very
stimulating; with out drugs!!!!!! If I'd had more money I would have even
brought a CD which they had for sale over in the corner. It was my first
time at 650 Howard Street; not a bad venue; however it was freezing the
guy at the front door kept the door open the whole time; not very cool or
energy efficent. Also Robert Rich play a string instrument which was like
a guitar only that it was flat and lying on a table; some pretty awsome
sounds out of it; he also had a Korg 01W + 2 other keyboards. For $7.00 it
was a pretty good show; at least what I saw and heard of it; the visual
portion wasn't bad for slides; and what looked like either CTHUGHA or
Fractal INT stuff on the monitors pretty tight all and all. I would
recoomend that if he comes back into town; that he would be worth checking
out; the audience was a real melting pot of people; races; ages and
musical genres. I'll give it :):):) out of 5 smiley faces; just kidding;
hehe.

I agree that if you're not a smoker it sucks to have to be around those that
are, but if clubs, etc. are made non-smoking then an outside area should be
provided for those who do.  Smoking is more than just getting that nicotine
fix, it's a habit.  I bet a lot of people would be upset if they couldn't
smoke any more.

no no no no no, but they are really really sorry--the problem was that 
the berkeley aquatic park was being patrolled by a cop car--law 
enforcement officials made it very clear to those of us trickling into 
the area early (3:30 or so maybe 4 i don't know) that the area was off 
limits.  so the party was never set up, and there was talk of moving but 
that never happened, and last i heard they're thinking about trying again 
tonight, and i have no idea where but i'm pretty skeptical of anything 
being pulled off at the aquatic park anytime in the near future.  the 
first cop car seemed to be on some sort of regular patrol (not in party 
busting confrontation mode), and the ones that came in later to help ask 
us to leave seemed pretty determined to get rid of us quickly and 
efficiently.  oh well...so once again the powers that be are against 
us...i doubt anything will happen tonight, but if it does, enjoy it for 
me, because i've got shit to do tomorrow and can't spend another night 
moonsearching.  :) jessica

Well, it finally happened last night.  After being run off by the 
authorities for being in the Aquatic park after closing, an making a 
series of phone calls.  We found out where the Party was at.  It turned 
out that after being run out of the park, everyone went to CB's loft to 
play some tunes.  I had a wonderful time.  Garth, Markie and Thomas 
played one for one for a few hours,  keeping a wonderful groove for 
everyone to enjoy.

Thank you Cb for opening up your killer pad for everyone.

See you next full moon.

Lot's of love,

Mark and Tracy Ameba

Hello and greetings from the Mother Earth Sound System!

We're a collective who have been throwing free outdoor parties around the 
Bay Area since the spring of 1993. Our love of Mother Earth, music, and 
grooving with people brought us together to put on parties, and now we 
want to come together with you. We'll be travelling around North America 
this coming fall, and are trying to establish as many connections now as 
we can.

Our collective right now includes four djs and a visual artist 
(projections, banners, etc), as well as a variety of musicians, 
artists, drummers, and friends that help us party from time to time, 
thus making the "Mother Earth Sound System" a loosely-defined group of 
people that basically just love to party.  However, our interest in 
coming to your town is not to just come throw a party, but to make ties 
with people...to exchange ideas (we do a zine with this in mind), to 
share talents (swapping records and mixtapes is always fun), and most of 
all, to share each other's company. 

We will be travelling as light as possible, so the more contacts we can 
make beforehand the better...if you can help us hook up additional 
sound/visual equipment, spaces to party, places to crash, or whatever, 
please let us know.  Our (us and you) success in this venture depends 
very much on how well we can work together to make it a truly collective 
effort.  Please understand that this appeal is directed not just to local 
party promoters and the like, but to _anyone_ interested in what we're 
doing (as a sound system and as a global "movement")...so if any of this 
perks your interest, tell us!  Tell us what you think of our proposal, 
whether you and people in your area are interested, what's happening in 
your area, what you would like to happen, etc. etc.   Let's start getting to 
know each other now and when fall rolls around, we'll be ready to rock!


Peace + respect,

of years, or more its all blurry,  so I am clueless as to the best parties 
there. when I last did go I was impressed by a small partie called 
'happy wensdays'. I'm not the massive party sort but like a good strong 
slammin' underground the best. any info via e-mail would be appreciated.
many thanks and much love
sean

	Yes the full moon did and didn't happen,  the big party in the
	aquatic park was foiled by the Police, basically the workers
	in the adjacent industrial area complained to the cops about the
	ravers parking and making noise so once a complaint was made the
	cops were oblidged to shut down the party (they got to the sound
	system as it was being set up).  I talked to one Berkeley cop
	who was quite nice and he told me that even though they often know
	we are there, if there are no complaints they can choose to ignore
	us but once 911 is called and there is a record they have to 
	respond.  It seems that once the word went out, lots of people 
	descended on the area and you can guess what happened after that.

	Anyway, he said that we couldn't have the party in Berkeley that 
	night. We told him we were just trying to regroup and would be out
	of his hair, which we did, the small warehouse where we all
	wound up was really cozy and intimate and totally renewed my faith
	in the Scene (at least for another month :)  It was nice to get
	a good groove on after a long hiatus.  After Markie,Garth and Thomas
	finished their trade off thing, Rebecca took the tables and played
	some really nice morning Trip-Hop complete with some really nice
	and accomplished scratching (yes ! and it worked too!)

	All in all a very nice party for those who had the energy and 
	devotion to find it.

Hello People,

I've recently added some audio samples of "The Premierian Estates" at the
hyperreal archive site for you to just check out and enjoy....

  These .au files can be downloaded at http://hyperreal.com/incoming/sounds
   and the files are "heifer" "intdes" "mech" and "malcomxc"

These are off of my new label Black Raven and I hope you enjoy the stuff we
new breeds are doing over here in the Windy City...

Peace, Love and Unity,
** Zheam (ausar@siucvmb.siu.edu)**

Dear Sfraves;

	Being a Cancer born on the 4th of July; as Cancer as Cancer gets; 
I have never been to a full moon. I'ma true moon child; I'm aware of it 
whether I can see it or not. Esp. on Valentine's day; I could have really 
used a good party; V-Day has always been a very bad day for my emotional 
state; coupled with a Full Moon; needless to say I was in a bad way. In 
the future I would really appreiated if someone would let me know about 
it. Thanks a head of time.

Dear Sfraves;

	Speaking of police; I had my first run in ever with a motorcycle 
cop; I've only been here in Cali for 4 months now, but in all my life 
I've never been harassed by a cop on a motorcycle. It kinda went like 
this; I was sitting in the UNICAL 76 station at the corner of University 
and I think Martin Lurter King; listining to Fad Gadget Down Under the 
Flag which I had cranked. I have an 84 Jeep Cherokee Wagoneer with a 
Pioneer CD 25watts a channel into 2 6.5 in MTX Coxial speakers mounted in 
the door; not what you would call a block blaster by any means. This cop 
as i'm sitting waiting for an open pump pulles over this womyn in a truck 
for reasons unknown to me. Gets off his bike and walks up to me and askes 
me is there any reason why I'm listining to my sterreo so loud. I told 
him it was a good song : For WHom the Bell Tolls I thing it was. He then 
proceeded to hassel me about the level of the music; the fact that i 
didn't have a seat belt bla bla bla ...etc. This is Berkeley right don't 
they have better things to do? Gee; obviously someone didn't get laided 
lastnight; what a pin head. I'm sorry for bitchin but I just don't 
understand why this had to happen. What a waist of tax payers money.

i don't think pot smokers will stick out.  there are far too many nicotine
addicts out there.  it will be interesting to see what happens if they
ban tobacco.  mass civil disobedience, gangsters and violence is what
i would guess.

Hi,

	I am going to be in the Bay area from 2-24 through 2-27.  I won't
have net access after tommorow (2-17), and I would like to find out what
is happening over the 2-24 weekend, if folks don't mind, would you send me
some names and numbers of clubs or parties scheduled for that weekend? 

Thanks in advance,
Rich

Hello from Seattle,

My name is Glenn (aka Tigger).  I'm involved with ATOI, Seattle.   In 
reading your introduction, I see that we both have the same ideals in mind. 
 I think that folx up here in the North West would be waaaay psyched to do a 
collaboration of some sort.  Please contact me as I'm sure that we can get 
into a wonderful, positive groove workin' with you guys.

Peace

Tigger

Hello and greetings from the Mother Earth Sound System!

We're a collective who have been throwing free outdoor parties around the
Bay Area since the spring of 1993. Our love of Mother Earth, music, and
grooving with people brought us together to put on parties, and now we
want to come together with you. We'll be travelling around North America
this coming fall, and are trying to establish as many connections now as
we can.

Our collective right now includes four djs and a visual artist
(projections, banners, etc), as well as a variety of musicians,
artists, drummers, and friends that help us party from time to time,
thus making the "Mother Earth Sound System" a loosely-defined group of
people that basically just love to party.  However, our interest in
coming to your town is not to just come throw a party, but to make ties
with people...to exchange ideas (we do a zine with this in mind), to
share talents (swapping records and mixtapes is always fun), and most of
all, to share each other's company.

We will be travelling as light as possible, so the more contacts we can
make beforehand the better...if you can help us hook up additional
sound/visual equipment, spaces to party, places to crash, or whatever,
please let us know.  Our (us and you) success in this venture depends
very much on how well we can work together to make it a truly collective
effort.  Please understand that this appeal is directed not just to local
party promoters and the like, but to _anyone_ interested in what we're
doing (as a sound system and as a global "movement")...so if any of this
perks your interest, tell us!  Tell us what you think of our proposal,
whether you and people in your area are interested, what's happening in
your area, what you would like to happen, etc. etc.   Let's start getting to 

know each other now and when fall rolls around, we'll be ready to rock!


Peace + respect,

Mr Darkness,
> Being a Cancer born on the 4th of July
> I have never been to a full moon.
> V-Day has always been a very bad day ...

I was also born on the 4th of July and I've never been to a full moon
either but this Valentine's Day was a very Very Good Day!!  I'll spare
you the details (ok, my first paper was accepted for publication) 
and Then
I went (beaming love) over to the city (anyone else just feel like
San Francisco was gonna explode with happiness on Tuesday???) 
and Then
fueled by the mysterious force of St Valentine I went to the DeHaro
party.  My 2-bit summary: felt like a Hardkiss Glamour production.
Definite shades of hollywood with disappearing chill rooms and
an early shutdown.  Crowd was on the young side.  I saw some
friends and beer was cheaper than the water (go figure).
Basically nothing could've shaken my mood :^)
and so Then
directions to the full moon were readily available
from folks running back and forth between 181 and DeHaro and being
lovingly removed from the building around 3:30 (after Mr H's one
turntable finale set) I was off for Home Sweet Home - after all, if I was
gonna find this full moon I needed some Lunch!!  A sandwich, chips, and 
soda later (maybe about 4:30) I tooled down to the Marina only to find
a heavy police presence - On Bull Horns "get in your cars and vacate 
the city".  I drove up to an officer who diligently searched my car
with his flashlight and confirmed that it was Not Happening.
Undaunted, I parked a few blocks away and set out into the park
hoping to run into any stragglers and see if it was moved.  I played
hide and go seek with 10+ cop cars in the park and on the tracks only
to find a few people who also didn't know where to go.  The full moon
was Beautiful on the water !!

Love Ya,
Dave

Hi all - thanks to Brian for taking care of this list the last couple
of weeks.  I spent that time working in Tokyo.  Highlight of the trip
was a visit to Yellow which was featuring NY's Danny Tenaglia and local
DJ Akai.  Both spun some great stuff and the locals were really getting
into it.  I'll try to write a (outsider's) guide to the scene when I 
get time. 

This weekend, Digitaria seems to be the main event, with guests
db, Josh Wink and Keoki; should be a great night of musique, and a big
crowd.  Sunday's Spundae has an all-star lineup too, and try checking
out Komotion on Friday night...

 Oh, ya...?                  RE>COPS
Didn't you know that you were a threat to society.  That loud music could have
produced a spark igniting that gas station further to set the entire city of
Berkeley on fire....What were you thinking!  

Please try to live a more productive and considerate life....Buy yourself a
gun, holdup a few convenient stores, highjack a few cars, kick an old lady in
the stomach, murder your fellow man, run for a public office, or just be an
attorney.

Remark: walks up to me and askes 
me is there any reason why I'm listining to my sterreo so loud. 

I told him it was a good song

Dear Sfraves;

	Speaking of police; I had my first run in ever with a motorcycle 
cop; I've only been here in Cali for 4 months now, but in all my life 
I've never been harassed by a cop on a motorcycle. It kinda went like 
this; I was sitting in the UNICAL 76 station at the corner of University 
and I think Martin Lurter King; listining to Fad Gadget Down Under the 
Flag which I had cranked. I have an 84 Jeep Cherokee Wagoneer with a 
Pioneer CD 25watts a channel into 2 6.5 in MTX Coxial speakers mounted in 
the door; not what you would call a block blaster by any means. This cop 
as i'm sitting waiting for an open pump pulles over this womyn in a truck 
for reasons unknown to me. Gets off his bike and walks up to me and askes 
me is there any reason why I'm listining to my sterreo so loud. I told 
him it was a good song : For WHom the Bell Tolls I thing it was. He then 
proceeded to hassel me about the level of the music; the fact that i 
didn't have a seat belt bla bla bla ...etc. This is Berkeley right don't 
they have better things to do? Gee; obviously someone didn't get laided 
lastnight; what a pin head. I'm sorry for bitchin but I just don't 
understand why this had to happen. What a waist of tax payers money.

What time of day was it?

Hey, man, I live right next to an all night gas station. At night, when I
am trying to enjoy the silence or my own personal music in my room, I don't
like to hear intrusive music blasting. I know how groovy it is to hear your
own music in the car, but... Even if you don't have a loud-ass system, the
threshhold of the neighbors sound level is definitely crossed.

As Lou Harrison said: Cherish, Consider, Create.

This is not a flame, it is just a perspective for your consideration.

peace,
Greg

Dear Greg;

	2pm in the middle of the afternoon; the traffic was so loud that I
couldn't even hear all of what the cop was telling me; even with my music
turned off. No he was just hasseling me; for sure. Ya know sound is a
funny thing; I just pulled out my ISO (International Organization for
Standards) #35 for Acoustics. Its not necessaially how loud something is; 
its a combination of many factors frequency, duration, sound pressure
level, sound power level, sound intensity level; and can be very
subjective. Obviously every human being is different; with that each of
our ears person to person is different as are our individual ears. So with
reference to law enforcement supposing to be a science, without a
calibrated measuring device tracable to NIST (National Insitute of
Standards & Techonology); formerly NBS;  law enforcement officials
shouldn't be able to at least bring into court any evidence to whether or
not something is too loud or not; yet they do. Its like taking you to
court for a speeding ticket without assigning a value to it; Oh he or she
was speedin; well how fast were they going; ah I don't know. Thats why
they have radar guns and speedometers which are calibrated and traceable to
NIST; so why not for sound levels? Whats wrong with this picture? So if
you ever get cited for disturbing the pleace these are things you should
bring up in your defense. By the way; with reference to radar guns; the
guns themselves aren't really calibrated; its the tuning fork they use to
calibrate the radar gun thats traceable. Yes a tuning fork which they
smack on the dashboard set to 91.7GHz I believe and hold it in front of
the radar gun;  These forks are calibrated for sertate speeds 50mph, 60mph
...etc. And if the speed denoted on the fork is the same thats displayed
on the LED display then its calibrated. Ew Ew what techonogly at work. I
used to be a Test Engineer so this is my field of expertise. Radar guns
are a lot of fun; especially when you have one and you drive down the road
zapping the cops; the perplexed look they get on their faces is worth a
million laughs; trust me.

Yes!

If anyone knows the real deal on the DeHaro V-day party, I'd like to
hear it!

Yeah, that was a weird party; I didn't see a single face I recognized,
but this didn't matter. For the first time in many years, I decided to
play along with this valentine's day thing -- got me a V-day date and
everything...

After an hour there, we had just started to get comfortable dancing; we
were hearing Andre Lucero spin some groooovy sounds (what da heck do
you call his kind of music?) when eventually the lights went up and
stayed up for a very long time. Since all the brightness was annoying,
we chilled in the car for a while, howled at the moon, etc. No sign of
a chill room anywhere either. Eventually, we go back in, lights still
on full blast, dance a few more minutes, then it shuts down.  We had
expected the party to go till 6AM, like any self-respecting party
should.

Not desirous to drive home right then we decided to explore the
building by vaulting over some chairs blocking a hallway; in the
closing hubbub, we weren't noticed by any security and had full run of
the building, which was quite interesting, and only partially inhabited
by businesses. (A new building, I guess)...

We evaded the security guards for about 2 hrs by stealthily ducking
into various mysterious dark side rooms, chilling out, having fun, and
discovering a beautiful (well to us) fullmoonlit garden of eden in the
back of the building. Around 4AM a security guard found us lolligagging
in the garden (actually, we were extremely lost by then anyways) and
escorted us out into the night.

So despite the disappointment in the v-day party, we managed to make the
best of the situation.

	Niels.

There will be some Cloud Factory activity this weekend.  We aren't sure 
when exactly but if you are interested call our temporary voice mail on 
Saturday.  The event will be Sat. night if we feel you all can deal with 
the cold, otherwise probably Sunday afternoon (noon-sixish?)  or perhaps 
both.  Dj's so far will probably Deaks, Tim Mcknew, Drenalin and others.

that number is 408.646.8567

love drenalin

ps that will be as far south as Monterey or as far north as a few miles 
past Santa Cruz up the coast so we'll tell you when we got it all figured 
out.  Best way to reach us is the voice mail or mail <elmo@cats.ucsc.edu> 
since I won't be in oregon to check my mail.

 Its late, matter of fact its almost next week, but I'll let you know  
 anyway.

 Last Saturday's wicked was the first event I attended in SF. I 
 showed up around 11, and after being by myself for all of fifteen
 minutes, started meeting a load of people - Thanks' Capt'n, Andre, 
 Jeff, Nathan, and others...

 I won't prolong the message, much has already been said. You
 have a wonderful scence.  Wondeful people, wonderful music, the
 little presents for my soul I purchased were wonderful too.

 Long may it last...And all take a minute to congratulate yourselfs.

 Ok, now for part two. I'd like some tapes, I'm willing to buy,   exchange,
whatever - but I need to know somewhere to purchase
 them, a quick review of whats out there, or someone to swap 
 with (Preferably all of the above...)  

 Hopefully I'll meet more of you the next time I venture out.
 Love,
 Gary

PS: Sorry if this is not rave related. On the other hand, if these laws
pass it is possible that they'll start charging $0.50 for each GASP OF
PURIFIED, BREATHABLE, NON-TOXIC AIR at raves, and the FREE TAP WATER
will be a PUTRID CARCINOGENIC SOILENT GREEN COLOR ... but at least the
dance floor will be nice and slippery due to MASSIVE OIL SPILLS and

by and large, the fed has had a VERY poor record controlling pollution;
  the environment should IMHO be considered a local issue, anyway.

when shit starts seeping out of sewers into the middle of the street
  in front of yuppie mini-mansions, there will be action taken. rest
    assured. the NIMBY law overrides all other legislation ;)

seriously, this could backfire in the newt's fat face, because of local
  people acting up.  if the fed had NO CONTROL over companies like
    lousiana pacific or weyerhauser, there would also be no backroom
      deals, since the slushfunds couldn't go anywhere.

this should be taken as just another call to THINK GLOBALLY,ACT LOCALLY.

In my case, the cop pulled over THREE WHOLE CARS at the same time, and
dissaproved of my very fine bell bottoms, so I called him a meter-maid with
a gun.

So he called me a punching bag and demonstrated a carotid choke hold on my
person, and threw aforementioned ass in jail.

COPS SUCK. COPS ABUSE POWER. Maybe not in Northern Exposure, but in real
life, real cities, they come on with attitude, and don't accept any in
return.

I know, I know, lay low, be a sheep in wolf's clothing, but I got my ass
kicked. And he was in an ornery mood when he hassled Brian.  Sometimes we
get some cool ones, it derives from our energy as well, but there are some
evil ones out there. Bullies with authority who have betrayed the trust
that we have given them, when we let them have this power.

Like the cops who took their badges off when they crashed a party at 1144
howard, and arrested 6 people, pounded three and used the word "nigger" as
freely as they wanted.

Like the cops in windbreakers over their badges, who stormed 938's new
year's party.

Like the cops who do shit like this all the time.

Like the cops who are not loved. Sucks, but they don't want our love. They
won't get my hate,either, and as little power as I can let them.

Remeber what the next Friends & Family party is about, good people, and
spread the word of what it will benefit. Unite our efforts, like a lens
concentrates the sun, and we can change anything we want.

Lotsa love 
 from one in the hive..........

It is time for us to diversify the texture that our pods dance upon!  Tile,
wood, concrete, tar, are the choices we are normally given.

Howabout a nice roomfull of fruit loops?  

Perhaps three feet of leaves in the fall?

I like the idea of snow.

No astroturf, thanks.

I have seen a  picture of a club in Spain that at certain points of the
evening floods the dancefloor with soapsuds, like, up to your neck.  

Perhaps a healthy serving of Christmas tinsel?

Geez................,

I tried to remember a time I had gone out to and event in SF on a Friday,
and somehow my besotted brain couldn't come up anything from out of the
"way-back-machine" files. So, imagine my horror when I arrived at 1015 Folsum
to actually "dance" this past Friday.

Who were these "semi-unclothed and unclean"  unravers who actually go out to
clubs NOT to dance to the music. Who are these unflegeling unenlightened
unpeople who are cluttering up the spiritual tranquillity of my dance world?

I know, I know,  the  the evolution of the Homo Unraver Sapiens is a slow and
sappy one.  Up!!!  from the tawdry and slimy club pits, where barely
pubescent life forms, struggle to cope with the tingling sensations of their
naughty parts.  Up!!! from the smoke-filled SOM meat-markets where the dating
game gong show oozes along eternally and repetitously through the muck of
spermatozical history. 

So, on Friday while I was dancing, I saw a little beached unraver lying in
the corner.  As I knelt down beside him, I ascertained that he was drunk to
the point of where his life force was endangered.  But, as he looked up at
me, a puff of tobacco smoke came out of his mouth, and he said weakly,
"Babes, I want more babes!!!" Babes!!!Babes!! Babes!!!!   he cried.

 Even in the face of genetic extinction, this unraver cried out for
 procreation!!! I was in awe!!!!!!

Well, I knew I was too far away to take him to the nearest emergency ward,
but I KNEW that is not what he needed.  I should take him home and subject
him to two non-stop weeks of candy-flipping shock therapy.  All the while,
reading passages from the Ram Dass' book,  HOW CAN I HELP   Also, a steady
stream of vocal samples like "You've got to believe in something, Why not
believe in Me,'  could be playing in the background.  Yeah!!!I could
introduce him to all my bi-sexual friends, and then he would never be in need
of a date of Friday night!!!!!!

But, as he lay there, I wondered what the whole would look like if he were
"enlightened" like me. I probably wouldn't be able to buy any of my favorite
tapes from Ameba. They would always be out. I probably wouldn't be able to
get into any of my clubs, even the ones I now loved to hate. And there just
wouldn't be any room for me on the dance floor,  even if I did get in!!!!!!
The Full Moon's would be have to canceled because of "too many" people
attending. And, I probably could never a get a phone call through to my
connection. That's it!!! I cried. Now you and your kind have gone too
far!!!!!!!!


No,  wait a minute, as I looked "down" on this little unraver, I smiled with
 newfound insight and respect. San Francisco is the "best of all possible
worlds, " and  "God is a raver who dances in heaven," (and sometimes at DV8),
and Jesus, I'm lucky to here at all,  on the dance floor listening to McDoc
Martin and the OverDubtribe.!!!!!!

Yes!!Yes!!!Yes!!! it weren't for these alcohol filled, tobacco smoking,
lust-driven, homophobic unravers, I wouldn't be dancing my happy little
e-soaked ass off right now!!!  The mother of all Epiphanies!!!!!!!!!
    Hosea & Right On!!!!!!!!!


So, I went right over to the bar.  Bought him another drink, bummed two
carmel unfiltered cigarettes, and talked the most beautiful, large breasted
girl I could find into coming over and "ministering" to him.  Babes!!! he
gurgled happily, and I knew this "scene" crisis had passed. There was a place
for him in the world, and I had returned him to it.  Dante was right!!! We
are not punished FOR our sins, but BY THEM!!!!!

Now that my world had snapped back into perspective, I again began to look
for my  place to dance, and mind my own miniscule, cosmic, comic business.

were here I'ld give you a big hug; I'm soo sorry that had to heappened to 
you. People wonder why society has a tendcey to be so fucked up; how can 
one wonder when there are sooo may victums walking around. Its sad. I 
remember sitting in a doctors office reading a Time Magazine; I saw a 
picture of a 7 year old Bosian boy lying on the ground in a pool of his 
own blood. The caption read boy shot by sniper. What kinda animal lowers 
x-hairs ona 7 year old and pulls the trigger; I just started crying. When 
is the violence going to stop; when will people realize that it just 
doesn't work and only brings more violence.

But, as he lay there, I wondered what the whole would look like if he were
"enlightened" like me. I probably wouldn't be able to buy any of my favorite
tapes from Ameba. They would always be out.
----------------------------
No, there would be more stores like amoeba... and more people making
tapes.



I probably wouldn't be able to
get into any of my clubs, even the ones I now loved to hate. And there just
wouldn't be any room for me on the dance floor,  even if I did get in!!!!!!
----------------------------
Again, no, there would be more clubs, more events, more voters who would
not allow police brutality, more money for the scene, and...


The Full Moon's would be have to canceled because of "too many" people
attending. And, I probably could never a get a phone call through to my
connection. That's it!!! I cried. Now you and your kind have gone too
far!!!!!!!!
------------------------------

More undergrounds... more than 1 full moon party, more than 1 of practically
everything.  More, more, more... more people... if we're all going to be
here together, we might as well spread the good ideas around.



But this part, I really like this:
----------------------

So, I went right over to the bar.  Bought him another drink, bummed two
carmel unfiltered cigarettes, and talked the most beautiful, large breasted
girl I could find into coming over and "ministering" to him.  Babes!!! he
gurgled happily, and I knew this "scene" crisis had passed. There was a place
for him in the world, and I had returned him to it.  Dante was right!!! We
are not punished FOR our sins, but BY THEM!!!!!
---------------------------------

Heh... he may learn yet...

Even better, why the heck are we sending the Mexican govt. 40 BILLION 
dollars in loans and aid in order to shore up their ailing economy, 
WITH NO STRINGS ATTACHED ON HUMAN RIGHTS OR FOLLOWING DEMOCRATIC
PROCEDURE! Meanwhile, that 40Billion dollars could be used on useful
things here at home, like infrastructure, or education, health-care,
etc.

"They" claim that this aid is needed because having the Mexican govt
fall could cause a recession on the whole amerikkkan kkkontinent.
Others claim that the failure of mexico would cause even more illegal
immigation into the US.... However, IMHO, the real reason is that
Mexico's failure would mean big losses for all those large US companies
that have recently  laid off workers in the US to move their
labor-intensive operations into mexico -- the NAFTA-enabled smooth
operation of their exploitation plants would be fucked by the resulting
economic/political instability. All those CEO's would have to give up
those big fat multimillion dollar bonuses they gave themselves when
they realize they're going to have to rehire all that expensive
unionized labor in the US.... As far as I'm concerned, I say fuck these
corporations, foreign investment/business is supposed to be risky, so
don't expect the government to bail you out (or rather bail out the 
country into which you've been investing and setting up off-shore ops)
when your greed outpaces reality.

So what if some greedy CEO can't afford that third yacht and the
vacation mansion in hawaiii... so what if Wal Mart had to cancel the
opening of more stores in Mexico because of the economic problems
there. Tough shit -- or like I've been saying recently
	"The right to profit is not a natural law"...

Ob-rave: hey, what's that song that goes 
"doo deeee dooo dum, boom boom boom"?

They contacted me for a quick report on the scene here. So thought I should
do a quick poll.


What's the best outdoor rave event of 94/95?

What made it special?

What would your dream outdoor event be like?

Hmm. . .
I thought that the Sunset parties last fall were wonderful.  Outdoors,
berkeley marina, beautiful views of the Bay and the Bridge, hundreds
of people, hardly any police, sunny, warm, breezy, friendly, dancing. . .

Looking foreward to summer '95!!

Subject: Massacre in the Chiapas fwd message was DISINFORMATION


I have just finished an interview with Professor George Collier in the
Anthropology department here in Stanford.  I will be putting the content
of this interview out on Monday, on inside Stanford at 5.30pm.  
Professor Collier has just written a book on the Zapatista movement, its
history, politics and aims and he has a doctoral student working at this
moment in San Cristobal de las Casas.

Professor Collier also received the well intentioned email about a possible
massacre and immediately phoned his doctoral student in San Cristobal.  She
(the doctoral student) said that all was peaceful in San Cristobal and 
there was no evidence of any fighting.

I checked the AP wire today for stories about Chiapas and the only story
on Mexico which may be linked to the situation was an explosion of a 
gas pipeline in the state of Tabasco.  Professor Collier told me today
that the internet is full of propaganda from both sides.  So beware to
confirm reports before you take them to heart.

Keeping you informed.

Dear friends,

	I'd like to take some time to tell you all about Harmony. We are 
going to have a party on Friday March 10th. We have a very 
beautiful confirmed south bay location. I really encourage the north bay 
families to make the trip. Djs are Tony, Simon, Doran, and Trent. Most of 
you have heard of Tony, Simon, and Doran, and know their different 
styles. But, you might be wondering what Trent spins like. Well I don't 
know who to compare him to, so I won't... but I did get to see him spin 
at a party not too long ago, and he came out with the most beautiful, 
crazy acid-trance. I'm really looking forward to hearing him again.

	Other x-citing things we have in store are visuals by ? Mark, 
ambient room by Dionysus Dreams, and a whole lot of love and energy. 

	I'd like to thank everyone who has helped make our past, present 
and future parties possible, and I can't wait to see you all again. 
Please call our voice mail @ 408.486.9591, for more info about this 
upcoming party on March 10th and future parties. If you want to leave

  Well, following what must be a major break-down in INS procedure, I now 
have my new visa, so tommorow I fly out to make a new home a golden land 
of opportunity (hmm- maybe "Grapes of Wrath" wasn't a good orientation 
guide). Now all I need to do is find somewhere to live. 

   I'm going to be working for EIT, which is based in Menlo Park; 
however Palo Alto and the rest of Silicon Valley seems to have all the 
atmosphere of Southend on a wet sunday afternoon. Since I don't have a 
drivers licence, I'd prefer to live in San Francisco, and commute in by 
public transport. Is this feasible, or is getting a car mandatory? 

Does anybody have any leads on any rooms to let? I'm looking for 
somewhere that's either clear for smoking, or with a covered balcony. 

Is therea anything good coming up in the next few weeks? grin.
I'll probably be flying to Carolina  next weekend to see my girlfriend, 
sort out shipping, and go to a lakeside rave-  anything nice and trancey/ambient
coming up the week after?

Look forward to meeting some of you in the flesh; Look for the jet-lagged 
Limey wearing an Animaniacs sweatshirt and a stupid grin.

Here is some information that I got from Amnesty International about
Mexico's current human rights situation:
14 February 1995

                      STATEMENT BY AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL
              REGARDING CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS IN CHIAPAS, MEXICO.

Amnesty International is seriously concerned about current developments in
Chiapas, Mexico, following the detention of alleged members of the Zapatista
Army of National Liberation (EZLN) on Wednesday, February 8; and Mexican
President Zedillo's February 9 detention order of people alleged to be leaders
of the EZLN.

The detention order was followed by Mexican army incursions into the
municipalities of Larra<i'>nzar, Simojovel, Morelia, and other areas on
Friday, February 10, and a restriction of access into the zones of conflict
preventing journalists and independent human rights observers from freely
entering the area.

Amnesty International calls on the Government of Mexico to lift these
restrictions and allow full and complete access to the zones of conflict to
independent observers, including human rights monitors.

Amnesty International has confirmed reports of aerial strafing against
civilian populations in the environs of La Garrucha, the ejido of Morelia, and
the environs of the town of Ocosingo.  Reports have also arrived alleging the
use of torture to force confessions of several alleged members of the EZLN
that were detained by the Mexican Federal Judicial Police on Wednesday,
February 8.  These reports are outlined in an attachment to this statement.

Amnesty International has reports of arbitrary detentions for short periods of
time, including that of two US Citizens, Ruben Cardosa and Robert Treinan.
They were falsely accused of inciting rebellion when in fact they are
free-lance journalists who were in Chiapas when the conflict began anew.  They
were released free of charges shortly afterwards.

In light of a long-standing pattern of human rights violations, particularly
the use of torture, Amnesty International is disturbed by unconfirmed reports
of summary executions, arbitrary detentions, and the use of torture by the
Mexican Army in the course of its operations.  Amnesty International calls on
the Government of Mexico to guarantee that the human rights violations
perpetrated by the Mexican Army in January of 1994 including summary
executions, arbitrary arrest, torture, and torture-killings are not repeated
now.

Amnesty International fears that these events may very well be repeated given
the fact that not one member of the Mexican army was prosecuted for human
rights violations, continuing a long-standing pattern of impunity for human
rights violators throughout Mexico.  Amnesty International documented these
and other violations perpetrated by the Mexican Army and security forces in
the course of missions in January of both 1994 and 1995 and raised its
concerns with government and other officials.

Amnesty International wrote then President-elect Zedillo in October of 1994
outlining a series of recommendations to rectify the human rights situation in
Mexico.  To date, Amnesty International has received no reply.

Representatives of Amnesty International USA today requested an urgent meeting
with new Mexican Ambassador to the United States Jes<u'>s Silva Herzog to seek
assurances of full and immediate respect of human rights both in the context
of Chiapas and elsewhere in Mexico.

I visited Amnesty's web page (io.org/pub/human-rights/amnesty/home.html) &
found NOTHING on the supossed going on's in Chiapas. The problem with this
total anarchy on the net is that people are very quick to beleive &
spread anything that sounds reasonable, especialy if it's some fun
anti-government kinda thing that lets them get all juiced up. There is
absolutely nothing in your post that gives any proof that Amnesty
International actualy wrote it but most people will probably just automaticaly
beleive it just from some name easily typed by anyone, I'm not claiming
that you did though or that this all was definatly mis-information but I
wouldn't be so quick to trust anything somebody sends you.

    Hmmmmm! Sat. night in Richmond? Big place, easy to lose yer friends, no

at Richmond would be last night. People, people, people....music,music,music.
That's a nice way to describe how Futur was. Tha place was packed! A sea of
heads bouncin' to tha pulsing beat. Energy so powerful, you could cut it with
a chainsaw. All in all, heart attack fun.
    To my surprise DjDan wasn't spinnin' tha same way he use to. In fact,
that was the best I've seen him do. Opon my trip up to tha DJ table I
expected to see Keoki or Winx spinnin', nope it wuz Dan spinnin' that crazy
acid shit! Also, Graeme was pretty impressive.... the music was just straight
sick!
    I'm lookin' forward to more possitive parties, like this.....$25 is
pretty lame to charge people, though. That was it's only down side, $15
dollars is tha right amount, less is better....keep tha energy, love, peace,
& happiness going.....

believe the worst, expect the best

Question: Who are we going to believe? In war-time, the first victim is the
truth. Which is why it is better to judge things by principles. I think we
can all agree that there already exists a precedent for human rights
violation in Mexico. SO we couldf rephrase the whole debate to "IF THIS IS
AN ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN - then why wait until people have been
massacred to act???? OR are we only moved by reports and pictures of blood
and guts. There is a military dictatorship on our southern border that is
being supported by the present administration. I think this is a total
disgrace, and quit frankly brings into question the entire American
Legislature. I suggest that if people are in any way upset by the prospect
of a massacre/torture occuring south o' the border, that we complain via
any means at our disposal, instead of having a CHANGE THE CHANNEL
attitude.

got to chime in and say that digitaria was a lot of fun.

  all the dj's rockewd it hard and steady all night esp. dj dan
and wink.

  i just loved the way that wink would make you dance and ina trance 
and just dancing along with this light bass line.  youd be like:
   "where is the bass?"   and then BOOOOM!  he'd hit you with it :)

  but all in all a beautiful site,  good vibes and a lot of dancing
smiling faces.  

see ya around

It's amazing how everyone thinks *jungle* is so new.  I love
breakbet/jungle/hardcore.. whatever!  But everyone seems to just use the word
jungle because they think it's so new or something...  It's  like always
using the words multimedia, interactive, and online (especially in SF).... 
It seems that the word that is used to describe the idea/phenomenon/object is
far greater than itself!  

o.k.  I'll quit babbling..

argh....

I was attacked twice this weekend.  First, by a posse of office
workers from the Bay Gaurdian.  Then, driving thru the mission a
truck full of teenage gangsters kept trying to stare me down at each
traffic light.  I kept blowing cigarrette smoke in response to this
silly puppy dog like aggression until I noticed his gangster woman
who was, well, kinda cute ...

consequence
another day, 
another fist in your face

These boys piled out of the truck - surrounded the car - and dramatically
grabbed their belt buckles in violent gestures that had something to do with
hiking up their baggy pants.  The police passed through the intersection 
responding to the fairly obvious showdown by flashing their lights and 
driving away.  Green light and we safely continued home.

(getting to the rave part here)
My friend, Trini Lopez, was rather shaken by the roadway incident and, to 
be honest, was in an odd mental state from our evening of anti-rave slumming.
His solution was to haul himself over to the Carpeteria party, throw down his
cash, and look for some family.  He kept mumbling - we're all in this 
together now ...

When I saw Trini the next day he said of the party, "All Intensity, No Unity"
So there is a second-hand review for ya ... I also heard of a digi-after-party 
in a mansion in the lower haight that Sunday morning - details of this would be
interesting - anyone make it?

Dave

US.... However, IMHO, the real reason is that
Mexico's failure would mean big losses for all those large US companies
that have recently  laid off workers in the US to move their
labor-intensive operations into mexico -- the NAFTA-enabled smooth
operation of their exploitation plants would be fucked by the resulting
economic/political instability.

This is the real deal, people.  Think voting time...

I'm heading to Utah to snowboard on Wednesday (2-22) and could use some
suggestions. I'll be in Salt Lake City for a week.  

I know I've read some posts from some mountain ravers on this list (and I
think from SLC). Someone mentioned that I should go to Mechanized and ask
around but thats about all the info I have. I could really use a good night
of dancing... help.

	Well we went out this weekend and pertied it up.  We don't know 
where everyone was but we had a great time.  On Saturday night Tim and 
Deaks spun for about five hours at the beach, both were really on.  After 
cleaning up we went to Santa Cruz (from Monterey) and slept for about 
four hours.  Then we got together for out afternoon adventures and 
finally headed up the coast to some cliffs above the water.  We set up 
around four and Deaks started again, at sunset Tim played a few songs and 
then I came on for a little bit.  Just as I was nearing the end DJ Cloud 
showed up and took over when I was done, I missed most of his set but I 
heard only good things about his set!  Then Donut went on for a little 
bit and Josh came on after that...then Deaks spun again for another hour 
or two.  We initiated our new speakers with style in the warm weather and 
I think we decided to definitely do a lot of afternoon outings this 
summer!!!  It was so nice to dance out in the daytime.  

love drenalin

I gotta leave my opinion too...

this was a super duper great killer fucking party. :)

Dan (the man) rocked it

Josh rocked it

Keoki half rocked it :D

db's got great records ;)

i saw some cool friends there...

one thing: back east we net.ravers have meeting places at the bigger 
parties, so that we can all meet each other...i go to parties here and i 
never meet any other sfravers other than the ones i already know...so 
mebbe at the next biggie we could arrange a time and place to meet y'all?

why would mexico be aggressive in chiapas?

  1. the PRI is worried about its legitimacy
  2. stockholders and financiers worldwide are nervous about the bolsa
  3. zapatistas have already shown their ability to disrupt politics by
       assasinations and terrorism
  4. there is a worldwide indigenous people's groundswell
  5. in the rainforest, no one can hear you scream

nah, the PRI will be _nice_ and _diplomatic_ and treat the mayans
  with the respect they're due


yeah, rite

Robert J, to my dismay:)
> San Francisco is the "best of all possible
>worlds, " and  "God is a raver who dances in heaven," (and sometimes at DV8)

So God sez: "Milton, I hate asking for help, but I want to try the SF
scene,you know, all this heavenly party stuff is nice, but techno on harps
bites the big one" so me and Jeff take Him to DV8, at his insistence, since
I personally boycott the joint. But God being God, and me needing a ride,
we went.

So some clown sez he get Him on the guest list, but when we get to the
door, the door dude sez" I don't care if He's Jesus, he's gotta pay" so I
floated god a fiver and we went in. They check his ID and go "Oh my God!"
and we go "ours too!"

At this point, God figured He didn't need any more attitude, and we went
off to the beach to play guitar, and He said:" Milton, you were right. I
shoulda listened to you the first time. Is the End-Up this bad too?"

God is everywhere. Except in a few people who have a propensity to wear
$200 heels and leather vests over their perma-tans.

(DISCLAIMER for the humor impaired: not an actual event. God doesn't need
Milton to get into DV8. Not intended to offend, and whatever the true
nature of your god/gods, I doubt that "He/They" can be miffed so easily.
I'm shure a little chuckle is appreciated by the Big Guy.)

I saw the same issue at the super-mark-it, and it made me freeze. he was
litlle, chunky and dressed in a puffy blue coat, white fur on the edges,
his mother had probably dressed him up for the cold and told him "stay out
of cross fire" but how in the world could he know some sick paranoid fuck
would deliberately pick him? 

His round little tummy kept his body from sprawling all over the blood, and
there was a stream of it as his life left him. I cried in front of the
whole line. what can I do? I cried more for the evil that one person can
contain, than over the loss of one life. Because that evil breeds and
persists, and that evil makes us the most vile of species. 

And the hope to expell that evil from our hearts is what keeps me smiling,
keeps me hopefull everyday when I wake up, makes me smile when I remeber
all the people I konw that think sorta like me, and that WE ARE EVERYWHERE.

That is a queer bumper sticker, I believe, but I think it should be used by
us and anyone with compassion in their hearts and peace in their souls. 

Lotsa love 'cause that's why we live,

Yes, i hope it is hoax, like the virus thing a while back (remeber that

Actually, Mijos, jungle is a place where big cats try to eat monkeys and
tree sloths, and you can walk around and feel really tiny in all those big
trees.
And it sounds really cool, unless you get loud, then everything stops and
they check you out and listen to you. 

And the jungle is older than any of us:)

YES!!! This was one of the stellar parties of last year, lotsa smiles, lotsa
swimmin, lotsa buds, lotsa good vibes, I still remember lying all 
cozy and warm in a big pile on the beach with a warm fire and some
great ambient music going on through out the night.  I'm there!

Well, all I can say is:

Thanks Ellen for bringing this party together.  Great crowd, lots of happy,
new and fun faces.  I had a great evening with Rob, Dave, Christina, and
my roommate Tom.  It was great seeing Ellen and Sarah (as usual) unfortunately
I missed Ellens set, but I heard it was awsome.  A big hug to my new found
friends Eden and Micheal and all of their gang.  Hope to run into more of
you at this really fun party.  Also it is only $5.

Luv,

Ron.

I made my first trip into the nighttime streets of SF last weekend, a
bunch-o friends and I drove up to check out  Futur.  Twas cool to meet the
few of those I was able to...the trip came together at the last minute, and
I was struggling to get #'s of many and failed.  So hello, Allen, (Joe Rice
- When ya' gonna get yer pal Frank Isaac online?)  Sorry to those I missed!
Futur was a blast - and damn if we didn't luck into the bestest after-party
ever...w/ keoki, derrick carter, josh wink, dan, charlie, graeme, jaggers,
-n- wade....the place was on McCallister with racks of amps and speakers in
almost every room, I don't even want to go into how beautifully the house
was decorated and all of the great people I met....wowzers!  Oh, the comfy
garden in back was an added treat as were the visuals on monitors in nearly
every room........Let's not even get into how incredible the music
was....MIND BOGGLING!  I even got to tape some of Dan's set, and the only
female to spin (although I neglected to get her name) as the airport
shuttle arrived surprisingly early to wiz us to the airport, since my
girlfriend was unable to partake in the pres's day holiday & we had to
split a day earlier than our friends........

Thanks everyone for being to warm and friendly!

I'll see you again soon!

See ya!   -M

Larry was asking about ambient music events that aren't
connected to the rave culture.  I just heard about something
coming up on March 14th at the Hotel Utah (at 4th and Bryant
in SF).  This is part of the Tuesday night Dark Circle
Improv series, which is mostly the kind of jazz music that
the SF Weekly (the old SF Weekly, that is) was calling the
"New Thing Part II", but on March 14th it's going to be some
pretty well respected local industrial ambient "groups":
Trance and Mandible Chatter.

Okay, some of the Jungle I've heard seems pretty
interesting... non 4-4 beat, with a murkier feel than most
techno, I'd say.  So I'm interested in seeing how real live
human beings deal with this in it's natural environment.
Where should I go to check it out?

Is this thing that's happening tonight really the place to
be?  The flyer I've got looks a little too hippy-hoppy for
my tastes:


hip-hop

the JUNGLE info: 415.995.4699


So what do you think?  The connection between Jungle (the
Jungle that I've heard anyway) and Breakbeat seems a little
weak to me, though I couldn't put my finger on why exactly.

Hm, I called the number above and they say that this event is
only $3!  Jesus, why didn't they put that on the flyer.  If
I'm up in SF tonight, I guess there's no reason I shouldn't
check it out.  And they even had the standard Woman with a
British Accent doing the phone message, so it must be
cool...

For some bizarre reason, Jungle is gaining a lot of support down here in
Texas, especially in Houston, so I hear more of it than I care to.  The
jungle stuff down here is defined as breakbeat that's heavy on the bass line
and sparse everywhere else.  I kinda thought breakbeat went away a few years
ago and I was glad to see it go IMHO.  Now this jungle thing has brought it
back.  Jungle has a lot of vocal samples in it, but the tempo is really fast
so all the samples sound like Alvin and the Chipmunks.  I think you kind of
have to be a major spaz to dance to jungle.  (Not that there's anything
wrong with being a spaz :)  

If you're curious about jungle, I'll give you a profile of what fans of
jungle appear to be like.  If what you see doesn't describe you, you
probably won't like jungle.  (Granted this is blatant stereotyping, but it
is in full acknowledgement of exceptions to the rule and is not meant with
any disrespect.)

Junglists are *very* fanatical about jungle, and will fight to the death
with anyone who questions jungle as the *ultimate* dance form.

Jungle is for people who like to totally spaz when they're dancing.  Jungle
is not about a mental trip, but a physical workout.

The junglists I've met are either not into E or any other drugs, or they
prefer speed and other amphetamines.

Okay, I'll stop, because I don't want to dis jungle, it just doesn't seem
very ravey.  I don't get a community feeling from jungle (or just plain old
breakbeat for that matter.)  I don't know, $3 is cheap, check it out and
judge for yourself, just be prepared.  I can't dance to it.  Take care.

Peace/Love/Soul

I realize I made a lot of stereotypical statements in my earlier post, but
it's statements like these which lead me to these conclusions.  This was
pulled off the txraves mailing list:

I take less issue with jungle as a musical form than I do with the
"attitude" that seems to be inherent in jungle.  It seems to completely
disregard the concept of RESPECT which, call me old fashioned, is still
pretty important to me.

My two cents worth.

jungle is an evolved form of breakbeat. you could still call jungle 
'breakbeat' if you wanted to.

you're not getting it. the Chipmunk theory of dissing breaks has long 
been dissed itself. current jungle does *NOT* include chipmunk samples. 
*listen*. and the tempo is only fast if you listen to it one way...dig in 
there and find the 'secret' funk-vibe and skank away.

ummm. yes and no. it's not about the speed. and in some sub-genres of 
jungle it *is* a big mental trip.

hmm. in places this is correct. see below.

not to diss you, but it's apparent that you don't get it, and it's not 
for you (i'll readily admit that there was a little while where i didn't 
get it.

Here's the scoop.

raves hit the UK, with acid house..things progress musically, house, 
techno, 'breakbeat house' (ie early XL recordings releases, happy house 
style)...this 'rave music' becomes the regular style to be heard at raves 
in the UK. it's happy, it's hard..it's great....some artists begin to 
push the envelope..things get faster, harder...a nw type of breaks come 
up, called 'darkside'..songs in minor keys, with screaming women and 
downright scary samples, another sub-genre comes up, 'drum and 
bass'...which is pretty much just that. (i lost the plot around this time 
and just couldn't get into the new-style breaks)...there were still 
people making the old-style 'happy hardcore'(as it's called now), and 
still keeping up with the new trends...but the drum n bass style 
grows...things mellow out a bit and a ragga/dancehall influence (which 
has always been around, really) beings to show prominently...this ragga 
influence (mc's etc) forms 'jungle' as it is today. now 'jungle' comes to 
represent a number of different sub-genres whichi won't go into 
now....the point is, that 'jungle' has essentially been around for a long 
time in different forms..and that it's coming into its own right now. 

The music is strictly a London ting, music made and played in the 
capital. Unfortunately there were some problems in the scene with crack 
being done at parties along with other quite icky drugs,but the people in 
the scene are trying to fight against it...like anyone they believe in 
their scene, are nice people, and just want to play their music and have 
a good time.

does this make sense..?


i really didn't mean the above as a flame...just an education of sorts. :)

I've heard some jungle that's basically sped up breakbeat (time-compressed
or doubletimed hip-hop drum loops) and some that uses some really original
syncopated drum programming that's one step further removed from breakbeat.
The only stuff I've liked has fallen into the latter category.

we all wear rainbow brite stars on our cheeks or something in order to 
give us a common recognizable bond deal. i'm new on this list so i don't 
even know any of you by name, but whats the harm in flipping out with you 
in person. any excuse'll do to groove.

	tonight i'm going to g love and special sauce. is that off topic? 
even if it is, they are smooth and sweet. wouldn't miss 'em for the world.

any other ideas for identifying marks. maybe we could all go around with 
our tongues touching our noses. i like it. . .subtle.

					always swimming,

>     2. Soldiers and police are arresting and torturing
>     civilians.  The village of Rosario Ibarra, in the
>     municipality of Ocosingo, was occupied by the Federal
>     Army on February 11, during which time soldiers
>     threatened and tortured various members of the community.
>     A representative of the community, who was not
>     identified, was reported to have had his arm cut off.
>     The soldiers also threatened to kill the children of the
>     women in the community if they refused to give
>     information about the EZLN.
>
>     3. In the community of Guadalupe Tepeyac, in the
>     municipality of Las Margaritas, the military violently
>     evicted people who had taken refuge in the medical
>     clinic.  These people were under the responsibility of
>     the International Red Cross (ICRC).  The ICRC was also
>     expelled from the zone, violating the Zona Franca
>     agreements signed in 1994.
>
>     In Guadalupe Tepeyac, hundreds of armored vehicles and
>     soldiers, supported by helicopter gunships, arrived in
>     the area February 10 and took up positions in
>     Aguascalientes, site of the first National Democratic
>     Convention.  This same operation was repeated in the
>     villages of La Garrucha, Champa San Agustin, Santa Lucia,
>     Monte Libano, Taniperlas, La Union, and others.
>
>     5. In order to isolate the zone completely, the Federal
>     Army imposed a military encirclement, reenforcing the
>     rearguard with heavily armed military roadblocks which
>     prevented the international and national press and
>     observors from entering the zone.
>
>     Due to the current situation, CONPAZ makes an urgent call to
>send faxes and telegrams to the Mexican government authorities,
>demanding the following:
>
>     a) A complete halt to the military operations that began
>     February 9.
>
>     b) A reinitiation of the negotiations and dialogue in
>     order to find a peaceful solution to the conflict.
>
>     c) Respect for the physical and psychological integrity
>     of the civilian population trapped inside the military
>     encirclement.
>
>     d) An opening of the military encirclement so that the
>     press and observors may be allowed to enter the zone of
>     conflict in order to verify the situation of human
>     rights.
>
>     e) The investigation of the denunciations made against
>     the Federal Army, punishing according to the law those
>     who are responsible of any crimes, in order to prevent a
>     repetition of the military impunity which has continued

acshully, according to XLR8R, now they've got this stuff called 
Timestreching where they can speed up any tempo and keep the pitch at the 
same level.  That way the voices sound normal and not all wierd.

That's true.  As raving goes, I was weened on Acen and the like :)  In 
fact, I still *love* the old school breaks from 91-93.

No no, given his locale, he is correct on this point.  I spent many 
evenings with the Houston rave crew this past summer, and for most of them 
jungle is definitely their cup of tea and not much else.

As far as the dance style goes, though, this is a pretty subjective 
thing.  You really can find this funky "half speed" groove beneath of the 
chatter, and some of the more swooshy, layered, "musical" jungle is 
definitely a head trip.

Greetings,

I'm looking for any SFRaver out there that can extract some audio files
from hyperreal and put them on cassette tape so I can take them to
Australia next week.    Simon Rumble from AusRaves has asked me to
bring to him,  some of the Audio tracke from Hyperreal.    I'll be
more specific as to which files as soon as I check with him.

Thanx

Dear Sfraves;

	I went to Digitaria Saturday night; it was a good time; I mite 
even say great; because I got to do bodywork/massage on people; and 
didn't have to pay to get in. The music was great; the people were the 
greatest; and all of the rooms were well done. But I'm sorry to say that it 
wasn't worth $25 bucks. Area 51 had much more to offer and was only 
$15.00. Area 51 had three rooms compared to Digitaria's 2. Area 51 had 
really good lasers; I don't even remember seeing any at Digitaria; the DJ 
line ups for both were comparable. Digitaria did have a live performance 
going on; but I really wasn't aware of live perfomers; maybe I was two 
stoned but; it wasn't appartently obvious or I didn't really feel their 
presents there. I can appreiate both the pro's and con's of a performers 
presents being appartently obvious; with the exception of the $25.00. 

	Another small note about Saturday night; was that i tried speed
again for the first time in 15 years.  The speed thats I used to do a long
time ago was better by far; it was a lot more unstable; meaning that it
would melt with hummidity if you weren't careful handling it. The speed
here in Cali seems to be a lot more trippy like Riddlin. I didn't like it
and would tell people to say away from it. It made me hal-lou-ci-ate
(spelled ponnectically); the images weren't very nice and if it wasn't for
some hydrocodone(Vicodin/Lortab/Lorcet) I proably would have ended up in
the hospital. 

	Hydrocodone Bitartrate is a semi-synthetic codeine narcotic analgesic 
which is currently used for relief of  moderate to moderately severe 
pain. It as most narcotics are habit forming. This drug for me makes me 
clammer and more alert; it knocks most people out; but with most drugs I 
get a paradoxical effect from them. Speed usually mellows me out and 
makes me less alert. I think this drug is wonderful; but its almost 
impossible to get it from doctors; I have found ways to get mostly 
anything I want from medical doctors; but don't ask me to tell you how. 
Like a hack my secrets are not forsale or available; you just have to go 
out there and make the same mistakes I did. Sorry but i do this to 
protect myself; because like most computer secrets once they are well 
known they are useless. I will say that; if you are a good actor; and you 
known a lot about pharmagology, and antomomy/phisology; and you present 
yourself to these people with an appropreiate converatve image that thats 
75% of it. You can get anything you want from a doctor just my giving them 
the right answers. I believe that these substances should be available 
without a prescibtion; but this will never happened because thew AMA owns 
to many congressmen and women, Good luck in your travels if you attempt to 
do this. It is illegal in some state to go to a doctors office looking 
for meds when there nothing wrong with you so be careful.

Dear Sfraves;

	Saturday night I went to digitaria. This night was different that most
nights for me because this time I brought my massage table a long with my
massage therapist hat(slang). I got there around 8:30pm and started
setting up the massage table in the chill room. I was finishd aroung
9:15pm and took my first client at 10pm. It was sooo nice once again to
touch and bring awareness into people's bodies, hearts and minds.  The
biggest and best surpise of all was that most of my clients were men. I'm
not gay;  but if you are a male massage therapist homophobia is a big
problem. I can only speak for myself and I guess a lot of other ethical
massage therapist's that its not about sex; its about respecting,
honnoring, trusting and worshipping the human body, mind and spirit. 
Celabrating even thought we are separtate; that we can come together for 
a brief period of time; and give each other uncontintional love; 
understanding and awareness. To touch and hold each other ina way that is 
respectful of the other person's boundries; while still providing them 
what they need; to sing, cry and learn together connected by touch. 

	The mear act of you or myself reaching out and touching another 
person; whether with clothes on or not; puts pressure on the surface of 
the skin; which also in turn brings heat to that area. The pressure also 
pushes clogged lymph and waist products out of the area and into the 
bodies drainage system, and with removal of the pressure fresh blood and 
nutrients come into to feed that particular areas cells. The heat thats 
transfered from one body to another makes our skin or connective tissue 
more liquidified; means that cells like macrofases; part of the bodies 
immune syustem can move around a lot easier. For example the human bodiy 
is like at least 70% water. So were sorta like fish tanks; only instaed 
of having glass walls we are wrapped with connective tissue. So if you 
have your hand on someones head; you are in also direct contact with their 
feet; via the coonective tissue. The fish in the tanks are the cells 
...eg macrofases, T4 cells, lymphocytes ..etc. Its really cool stuff and 
I kinda go off on it sometimes. So just my touching someone you actice or 
facillate there immune system. Think about that next time you touch someone. 

	I believe that everyone should go to massage school and learn 
about this stuff; I thing in general we would have a society that is 
healthier, happier and less needy. Touch is sooo important;we as beings 
get soo little respectful, loving touch in our lifes. So my massage work 
is very scared to me.
	
	Well bak to Digitaria; i charged the following rate scem for
events only. The first 5 minutes are free, with every minute after the
frist five is at the rate of $1.00/minute with a minum of10 minutes. I
wouldlike to formally make myself available to promoters in the future; 
or I will just show up at the event like I did on Saturday. Look for me
and my massage table a lot in the future. I'm trained and certifed in 1st
Aid by the America Red Cross and have Gestalt Therapy based counseling
skills which are avilable at no charge. So if you see me there and need
someone to talk with, or have an emergency medical issue please do not
hesitate to approach me with these issues, I welcome them and because I
have this training feel compelled to help.

Nice one .... mikebee,

once I new a girl from chicago who in 1985 listened to house music
 in her camero on her way to the tanning salon. However, this in no 
way has discouraged me from loving house music in its current form. 

the jungle party did have a bit o'hip hop flava but I'd say it was a good thing.
 congas, and MC rapping,.. I left early due to a goat burrito I ate.

Also, The Political opinions expressed recently  are MALFORMED cliche
 (my opinion) and I would reply to them if I was on the appropriate forum:
 (yuppies and hippies and  zippies oh my!).

Well I didn't go to to Digitaria, because I was in Columbia/St.Louis, MO
this past weekend.:) 

I basically stayed around Columbia on Friday night because majority of 
the people were too tired to drive to St. Louis after Graham/Wally/Clint's 
radio show. Plus I was pretty tired from the plane ride. So we rented a small 
sound system and played records all night long at the Interplane (Clint, Kuri,
Robi, Wally, Graham = Tan Pants Gang :)) house. For those of you who don't 
know what Interplane is, it's basically a mail order business for 
techno/ambient music.  

I had a great time despite what happened on the 
party on Saturday. I went to FUK - The Midwest Tour of Plastikman. The 
event was held in a downtown warehouse in St. Louis (a 2 hour drive from 
Columbia). They were actually  selling smart drinks at the party (I 
haven't seen those around here in a while) and plastikman merchandise 
(I forgot to go back and get some *doh*).

When I walked on to the main dance area, it was COLD. Dancing helped a 
lot, though it was hard to dance to people who couldn't mix. I mean, these 
were BAD mixes. I couldn't believe the djs would go from house to tweaky acid 
in one mix. I know they were trying to be diverse, but it just didn't work out.
The first DJ that was on when I got there continuously had train wrecks (or as
the Innerplane crew would say it, "shoes in a dryer"). The highlight of the 
evening was Plastikman and when Richie Hawtin came back to spin later on 
in the early morning. Plastikman was AWESOME. During the middle of the 
set, the cops came in and said we couldn't dance. The promotor of the 
party had all the permits (including the portipotties), but apparently there 
was something in the contract about dancing. Anyway some people left, the 
promotor wanted to keep the party going so she asked people to sit on the 
floor. Since we couldnt dance, we could listen to music. Later on we were 
able to dance, despite being stopped again an hour later. This time the 
captain was coming down. There was also rumours floating around that some 
task force was in town and that is why so many parties lately have been 
getting busted. Plus the promoter from That Girl Productions, NEVER gets 
her parties busted. I guess there is always the first time, even though 
you have permits, etc. But I admired the promotor for trying to keep the party
going despite the harassments.


The ambient DJs and the chill room was excellent despite
it being so crowded. I really got to sense an interesting "diverse" crowd
in St. Louis. There was the rave kids, the frat boys, the people dressed
in suits that came from a near by yuppie bar, and of course the
"rednecks." (I hate putting labels on people, but it's the best way to
describe the people who were there). I still can't get over the distance
that people drove out for the rave. One group of people we (Interplane)
was from Michigan. The people I met there were really nice. However we are
lucky to have so many good parties within a 5 mile radius. 

I had a great time while I was there thanks to Wally Winfrey for being a 
great host. And I have to thank Mike Brown for coming down from Ohio. And 
thanks to everyone else (Robi, Clint, Graham, Kuri, etc.). (Sorry I got you 
guys sick:()

It all comes fromthe same source...the newer programmed stuff (actuall 
not all that new...artists were programming their own beats as far back 
as '91...listen to Sonz of a Loop Da Loop Era's "Far Out") is just an 
evolved version of the old-school 'breakbeat' house music...I think both 
has its merits and am very excited about the new school (more on the 
intelligent 'breaks' tip than the ragga 'jungle' tip)...

The record to check out now for a fantastic introduction into the 
so-called 'intelligent breaks' genre is Omni Trio's _The Deepest Cut_ 
(whichis being domestically released with a different title)...This album 
pretty much has nothing but recent breaks classics on it (as Omni Trio 
have been at the forefront of the genre for awhile)...eat it up!

Timstretching has been around for *years* Back to '93 with Rufige Cru's 
'terminator' and even before then...but even still..Current breaks 
('jungle')tend to rely less on found vocal samples and more on sampling 
their own vocalist and manipluating the vocal as they please, sung at the 
same tempo as the song...

I just received a promo from Sm:)e Communications of an Omni Trio LP 
called "Music for the New Millennium."  Although it does have some good 
drum programming and song structures in line with what I'd call 
"intelligent" breaks, the production on the LP as a whole is still 
lacking in the eye-opening surprises I look for in music that is dubbed 
as "progressive" or "intelligent."  But it's still miles better than, 
say, Moonshine's latest jungle offering.

Hey, I haven't received my weekly colander yet and am very interested in knowing what's going on this weekend.  Could some one send me the colander at my e-mail address if it's already been sent out?

Also...

I really like the idea of a unique identifier to be used at raves to identify members of this list.  I'd love to meet you guys (and girls).

Hope to meet you all soon

Dear Cindy;

	If you want to travel or like to travel and go to raves. Here's a 
piece of advice/gem of a location to check out. Gainesville, Florida yes 
G-ville in North Central Florida. The Jaxsonville, Orlando, Gainesville, 
Adlanta, GA scene is hot hot hot and very organized and together super 
froendly and very accepting. I came here from there in G-Ville Keoki, 
Josh Wink, Pierre ..etc spun there regularly at a club called Simion's; I 
highly recommend checking out this North Florida scene; hey if i don't go 
to bloody england; I use my free ticket to go back there and visit; and 
your welcome to come along as a friend. Anyway I didn't read the whole 
review you did but the feeling I got was that you didn't have a very good 
time; sorry to har that and hope your next travel rave goes better.

WE ARE EVERYWHERE has been a slogan in the gay/lesbian community for a long
time, but it has *also* been a slogan among Deadheads for at least the last
decade.  My friend Bob who lives up in the Oakland hills is one of a group
that has been distributing WE ARE EVERYWHERE stickers at Dead shows for
years, I wouldn't doubt they've handed out a couple million of them, since
I see them everywhere like tollbooths on the Bay Bridge :)

Dear Sfraves;

	Due to numerous mail problems with my Internet provider; I'm 
asking all of you once again to express your sincere interest in the 
trip to see Universe in England on May 6th, 1995. The plans are as 
follows we would leave SFO on May 4th, 1995 and arrive in London, 
England sometime on the May 5th, 1995. Go to the show on the 6th; 
recover on the 7th and leave England on the 8th to arrive back here in 
SF on the 9th of May, 1995. So far I've gotten quotes from some travel 
agencies of airfare that's about $550.00 to $650.00 roundtrip for 20 or 
so people. I called today to find out how much it would cost for one 
person and it was about the same. Either these's a miscommunication 
going on here or 5 out 5 of the travel agencies I called are really 
crooked. I'm going to confront them on Thursday the 22nd with reguard to  
the price being the same for one person as for 20. But I still need to 
know some numbers for people so please express your interest to me 
again; sorry I can't as much as I scream at Liberty get them to get 
their BBS internet mail together. They just installed a new server with 
a T1 connection and it appears to be working correctly; knock on wood.
I'm going to try and go regardless because I already have free airfare 
across the country; and as a adult never ever been on a vacation just 
for me. It would be nice if I could go on the vacation will people I'm 
connected with. So I will keep you posted on things. Sorry for the 
problems.

                  Peace & Love From Across Cyberspace

That's true.  As raving goes, I was weened on Acen and the like :)  In 
fact, I still *love* the old school breaks from 91-93.

No no, given his locale, he is correct on this point.  I spent many 
evenings with the Houston rave crew this past summer, and for most of them 
jungle is definitely their cup of tea and not much else.

As far as the dance style goes, though, this is a pretty subjective 
thing.  You really can find this funky "half speed" groove beneath of the 
chatter, and some of the more swooshy, layered, "musical" jungle is 
definitely a head trip.

hi,

my name is brendan, and i am the keeper of the ne-raves faq.  i'll be in san  
jose for a physics conference the third week of march.  since i'm a poor grad  
student and our grant is expiring soon, i'm trying to keep the cost of my going  
to this conference pretty cheap.  is there anyone willing to put me up for that  
week or a few days that week that lives within about 45 minutes of downtown?

thanks,

Check out the prices on Virgin Atlantic - you should be able to do a lot 
better than that. It's $300 round trip from New Jersey, and that was 
booking the day before I left, with no saturday stop-over. They also have a 
direct flight from SFO to LHR. 

You can get good prices on Virgin through STA travel. I've never used the 
SF branch, but the number is (415)-391-8407. Virgin has the best economy 
class of any airline around (they have seat back tvs with loads of 
different channels and movies; on some aircraft they even have nintendos. 
Oh, and they used to use ProGen as the title music for the TC channels. 

If you're lucky, and get bumped to Upper Class, they even have a 
professional masseuse to give back and neck rubs...

	This is a message for all those who give a damn that 
 rainforrests are being clearcut in Northern Canada to make Pacific 
Bell's CA. phone books out of the trees.

	Clayoquot Sound is 650,000 acres of rainforrest on Vancouver 
Island.  A giant timber comp. called MacMillan Bloedel turns 48% of the 
timber into paper pulp.  PacBell uses about 20% recycled fibers in their 
phonebooks, although they claim anywhere from 90-100% recycled fibers.  
This is bullshit and everyone should know it.  I volunteer for CalPIRG, a 
student public interest research group that is putting severe pressure on 
PacBell to stop buying pulp at the expense of 1700 year old trees.
	If you wish to help put the squeeze on PacBell from the comfort 
and safety of your living room, call toll free 1-800 894-Bell.  Ask them 
how much of their phone books are made of recycled fibers and demand that 
they stop using trees from MacMillian Bloedel.  

	For all those in the Santa Cruz area, we are going to storm the 
PacBell palace on March 14.  CalPIRG, Earth First, and Greenpeace members 
will be there picketing outside the PacBell building off of Pacific Ave. 
in downtown Santa Cruz.  Support is needed and encouraged.  

Feel Good.  Do something.  Thankyou.
love Jake.
Oh yeah, if you got questions call CalPIRG in Santa Cruz at 408-459-4649.

Never before has one word so singly summed up the frustrations of a
generation and a planet in need.  This is not a request for information. 
This is the voice of a tired and weary spirit needing a hug.  His planet is
being destroyed in the name of hambugers and phone books and fuel to keep
the generators of death going; feeding the gnarling mouths of this political
machine that has taken over our mother.  A machine that fears the freedom it
was set up to protect.  Fearing so much, as to launch witch hunts, and
propaganda campaigns, ever watchful for the next sociological scapegoat that
they can ban in the name of the guilty souls who can't blame themselves for
what they've done.

So please, won't you listen to this cry?  Please... help.

Peace/Love/Soul

hey everyone. 

  went to the jungle weekly thing last night.  it was cool all in all got
there aroudn mindnight.  the first dj i heard was all drum and bass and
had the sound pushed up too high so it was distorting and his selection
was rather boring but the next dj, some lady spun some phunky toonz that
was good, and ocean who was spinning at the end before i left at 2 was
rippin stuff up. 
   all in all a cool crowd rather into it.  seemed to be about 1/4 - 1/2
people who go to parties there and the rest either from other musical
backgrounds or just there to check it out.  but cool over all. 
   if you wants to check out jungle id definately suggest checking it out.

If you have or are planning to get a CD-ROM drive and would like
to have a memento of the 1993 - early 1994 SF rave scene, I
highly recommend picking up Headtravel.  I found it at Tower, for
the price of a regular CD.  It contains over 45 minutes of music
(which you can play in a regular CD player) and a lot of images
of SF raves and flyers.  

The visual component is quite nice.  You get a multislide show of
our scene while the music plays.  The images go by pretty fast, but
you can click on them to freeze and zoom.  This also places you in
a mode where you can move a slider that will take you through the
images one by one.  The images are slanted towards Wicked FMRs,
especially the last few at Bonnie Doon.  But other parties are
represented as well.  Lots of familar folks, though I didn't see
many SFRavers.

Another mode gives you a 10 minute movie, which is mostly computer
graphics, but then changes to moving videos of parties, people
dancing, panoramas of SF, etc.  Very nice.  Another mode basically
takes you to some advertisements and the story of Wicked.

The music is pretty good too; nice bleepy techno/ambient from local
artists, though ironically, it's not the stuff that usually gets 
played at the parties shown here.

Here is Newt Gingrich describing some of the most important aspects of
SFraves....

--------------------------------------------begin excerpt---------------

It really, historically, is a very romantic country. You can't be
American without having romance in your heart. I mean, if you grow up
as a cynic, it's very hard to sustain the magic that's American. But
part of the conclusion I reached, oh, maybe 22 years ago, reading
Daniel Boorstin's work on the Americans, is that as important as the
mountain man is -- and you remember "Jeremiah Johnson," which is a great
film, and again, a very useful introduction to a real authentic American
-- there were very few mountain men. There were very few people who went
out on their own in the woods. The most common American pattern was the
wagon train. Wagon trains are collective enterprises. They are us
getting together. A wonderful scene in "Witness" where they have the
barn-raising. The community comes together. America is about
individualism, but it's about an individualism which then voluntarily
creates communities, which is the thing De Tocqueville is stunned by,
that here you have this enormous freedom. Does the freedom lead to
anarchy? No. The freedom leads everybody to get together.
But they get together voluntarily and they create the community they
want, and now in the electronic age, you can live geographically next
to 60 different people, not know many of them,
and then you can reach out to the people you want to create an
electronic community with by telephone, by fax, by computer, and you
suddenly have an extended family of lots of people, some of whom you've
never even met, but you were really excited knowing each other. So it's
the individual then merging into community. And one of the
characteristics of it is that idealism in the community draws the
individuals together. It's not rampant individualism. It is
individualism lived out idealistically within a community.

available at Newt's World Wide Web page:

Thats an interesting lecture.  Thanks for sharing that.  I very much see 
raving as a way to gain a sence of oneness through our individual 
expression.  Sharing the music through our dance, bringing us together, 
giving us a sence of community.

Atomicon,   yet another one
===========================

  Well,   this Friday was yet another Atomicon.   So we head out to 
our favorite map point to pay our $5 and get our hand stamped and 
directions to yet another insane Atomicon.    Just before I left,  
I logged into my new account at "sysx.apana.org.au" to verify that 
I have an internet provider in the land of Oz,   but right away,  
formost on my mind was getting to Atomicon.

  When I arrive there were about 80 dedicated hard acid ravers,   
and for the SF Scene,   where hardcore is literally non-existant,   
I really look forward to dancing the faster BPMs.   Oboy!!  Can't 
wait until I get to Sydney where its ALL fast.

  Anyway, I arrive during DJ Mars set,  and as usual,  he was 
tearing it up BIG TIME with the most amazing acid trance since Goa 
Gil at Megatripolus.

  Afterwards,   expecting some rip snortin Hard Core,   we get a 
more Housey sound from a DJ I haven't heard before.    He went all 
over the place,  as I tried to determine what direction his set was 
heading,   but as soon as think he is heading in a certain 
direction,  he just does something unexpected.   At first,   I left 
the dance area ad chilled,   but eventually,  his set stabilized as 
the energy level was increasing,  and more and more people were 
dancing.    I thought the transition to the slower beats was a 
pretty good idea to get in touch with those not used to the faster 
stuff.    I was expecting to hear some Gabber,   but that never 
transpired.   Sigh!!   I was dissapointed!!   I think Stone went o 
after that,   but his set disn't have the right amount of energy to 
keep me around,  so I left about 5:15 am or so,   and headed back 
to Mill Valley to smoke bong hits all morning long until the Cafe 
opened up for breakfast.

All in all,  DJ Mars set was the highlight for me,  as I was in 
Kandy land trancing BIG TIME.

Till Digitaria....  Keep on raving....

========================
       Digitaria
========================

It's now Saturday,   and the big massive scheduled this time is 
Phuture Digitaria at the Richmond Civic Center...   One of my 
favorite venues.

We get there about 11 pm,   lines were very long,   but moving 
fairly quickly.   After about a half hour wait,  we finally got in.   
Security was by Lyons Security (Pretty good folks),  and after the 
usual search through my fanny pack,   we were all let in.

It was a lot more crowded than area 51,   and when I arrived,   DJ 
Dan was about to start spinning.    His set developed quickly as he 
introduced us to some newer music a lot more trancey than DJ Dan 
normally spins.    My head was already prepared for the music,  and 
I wasted no time getting on the dance floor,  after scouting 
around.

Just before Dan went on,  Graeme was spinning Jungle,  but (sigh!) 
it only lasted about 20 minutes.    Jungle music still hasn't 
cought on here as much as anywhere else.

After dancing MOST of DJ Dan's set,   I decided to walk around,  
checking out the other attractions.   I noticed the video was OK,   
but no lazers like Area 51.    Boy!!  It was sure crowded,  Great
vibe!!   Gave me the oportunity to tell everyone about my trip to 
the land of Oz.

After a while,  I headed back to the main dance area,  to check out 
Josh Wink.    Naturally,  I danced most of Josh's set,  although he 
wasn't spinning as much Acid Trance as before,   and he naturally 
played the "Ha Ha! laughing song",  as just about everyone else 
these days.    Sheesh!!  although the song is quite a hit,  almost 
all the DJs in the area now play it.

DJ Keoki went on after Dan (I think - although my brain was pretty 
much mush by then,   as I was dancing pretty hard,  totally 
trancing out.    WOW!!  This guy was awsome.   It's really great to 
hear new talant in the mainstream,  although it's reported that 
Keoki was from New York.

At around 6 am,  Jeno went on.....  As usual,  I wasn't at all 
dissapointed,  as the energy level just got upped a few notches.   
WOW!!   Already 7 am (expected closing time),  and yet thousands of 
people are still around.    After learning that the rave was to go 
on until 8 am,   my smile facter went up even more,  as I was 
bouncing around like a crazed lunatic with a big fat smile on my 
face. 

The SFRave facter was pretty high,  and hello to all those that 
attended.    Annyway,  8 am came all too quickly,   as Jeno put on 
his last song,   I pulled out all the stops and danced like there 
was no tommorrow.

Anyway,  Phuture (Digitaria) was pretty good,  but hardly worth the 
rip off price of $25 ( $20 if you got there in line before 11 pm,
and was luckey enough to be handed a flyer.

Till next time,  Keep the scene alive....

    Yeah! Digitaria was a pretty sick party. Yet, to pay 25 bucks to get in a
party that wasn't as crazy as Area 51? My reply is: "PHUCK THAT!!!" I only
payed $20 ta get in, but I still regret it. If ya saw the head count at
Digitaria, you would think they would make a phuckin' mint with $10 each.
    Tha only reason I would go to another party that costs $25, is if all my
friends went.....yet that would be a BIG maybe. People ask, "Why do people
charge so much money just for one party?" I'd say, "Because people like us
will pay THAT much." So for that next time, I urge all ya cool cats ta think:
Is it really worth it to pay $25 for a party when I could go to a smaller
party (wit' friends) and have a good  time just tha same? Plus, ya save
cash.....nice. :)

Adios....

well..

$20 before 11pm....$25 after.
This one rocked ALL nite... from DB to JENO.. from 11pm to 8AM, i.e., 
9 hours. Some of the best DJs around.. especially good for those of us 
who don't get the chance to see these DJs much..

$2.22 / hour... for the likes of Josh Wink..keoki...DJ Dan..Graeme..Jeno..

cheaper than a movie and a lot of other things..

I think it was a friggin bargain :)

Now that is weird. Sorta like when I lived in the mid-south, early 80's,
and there were these police ordinances against "Devil dancing"  jayzuz!
Imagine if I was there with of Sin at the rave:
OFFICER: "sorry, son, you can't dance!"
ME: "I know, but don't tell anyone, I'm really shy about it"

Later, in the chill room:
That durn OFFICER again:"boy, lay off the happy massager. You can't carress!"
Me and the Bee:"got any gum, sarge?" 
oh come on! need I a permit as well to engage in oral sex, and is it
cheaper than the anal one?


>etc. But I admired the promotor for trying to keep the party
>going despite the harassments.
Yeh, should serve as an example to our "golden" scene. Promoters that give
a *^%$&*......even in the face of the law and all the negativity it brings.


FUCK PERMITS FUCK PERMITS FUCK PERMITS FUCK PERMITS FUCK PERMITS FUCK PERMITS 
Permits are about money. Permits are about organized crime (cops) getting a
piece of the action. Al Capone dealed in extortion/protection. What's
different from the cops in SF? You put 20 cents in the meter for
protection, or you lose $27. You pay a shitload of money for a liscense to
entertain 18 year olds, or they shut you down and haul you off. What's the
difference? They're legal, gangsters ain't. Cops got the edge. that's all. 

I've been to parties where they hire two off duty cops at the door, they
have no busts. hmmm.....sounds sorta whacked to me. Serve and protect
turned into nerve and collect.
FUCK PERMITS FUCK PERMITS FUCK PERMITS FUCK PERMITS FUCK PERMITS FUCK PERMITS

If a song izz really really good and a lot 'o' people like it, then 
what's wrong with it getting played often??  It's always cool to hear a

Till this friday. My motives were more to meet the invitation of one
wonderful human being, that human being being set on getting to the
warfield. So I went.

Man! Awesome band, but I can't fathom the crowd. Lotsa vibe, lotsa energy,
lotsa smiles, but moshin don't get me. Especially wit dis crowd. all white.

Thought I should mention: Ravers in wonderland lost their space 2 weeks
ago, when they were the only all ages party in town. They built their party
line-up around their space, and lost it 2 days before the party.
Rescheduled for this friday, folks. Is it the only "big" all ager?

Now they got Ceasar's latin palace. These boys lost 2 thousand bucks just
because of the postponement. Ceasar's costs a lot. I think they will be
lucky if they break even, given the bad luck. Ceasar's is the site of the
last Kundalini and Organic.

But they are doing this party out of love, and I hope it works. It is ALL
AGES, you can reach it by bart (short walk) and there is plenty of parking
around it, and they will throw more parties in the future, usually with a
theme (like this one, alice in wonderland:). These people respect you, and
may need some of our energy to pull it off.

Just so people know, when yer party gets cancelled or postponed, some of
the DJs want to get paid, anyway. And then paid again for another date. I'm
sure they are worth it, but never believe they're in it for love, after
that. My friends found that out recently, to the tune of 2 thousandie, the
hard way, the cold hard cash way, and many people who have done other
parties learned the difference between love and profession with some of
these djs. I don't want to ruffle any feathers. Professional is
professional, these are the terms that the "big" guys set to book them. You
can love somebody, or you can sell your love. I have no problem with DJs
getting paid, maybe they all should, but when someone is hurting due to
something REALLY BEYOND THEIR control, I feel it is callous of someone to
come up and say "hey, bud, you owe me $400. too bad yer losing money."

I just feel that this is what "kills our scene". You can blame speed, kids
from san jose(yes, I've heard this sed at parties!?), 14 year olds on E,
cool world, cops, etc, but what it boils down to is that the love is often
not there. 

Long live friends and family. Thanx to Ethan, Bryce, Deaks, Tracy, Galen,
Solar, Ronan, and especially to everyone who jumps up and down and screams
and cries and hugs and grabs and loves and smiles and dances and cares and
makes me feel as happy as a new born pup. That's what this is all about. 
                          No people, no party. 
So my new fuck list:
Fuck  police sanctioned abuse of power
Fuck permits/extortion
Fuck paying for granting a DJ the PRIVELEDGE to spin before our people.
They should be begging (many are!:)

I agree that $25 dollars is quite a bit of money, but at Richmond, at 
least there is plenty of room to breathe, non-assholish security, and 
*great* dj's.  There is no such thing as a free lunch, sonny.  A less 
expensive lunch would be nice, though.

Heh, this is an easy question to answer.  I prefer the smaller 'house 
party' vibe to the massives.  Of course, it's also great to be at a 
massive with a ton of your friends, but I've never seen a massive where I 
could run to the fridge at will and grab some cold cranberry juice.  That 
would be worth $25 :)

One thing we need to remember is that some DJ's have to live off of the
money they make spinning records.  When I say live I mean pay rent, eat,
buy records (a very big expense!), etc.  And so these DJ's must book
themselves in a way that allows them to make enough money to cover the
basic expenses involved in living.

If you book a DJ and then call them the evening of the party to tell them
it has been cancelled you have effectively ruined that DJ's chances at
making money that night.  Therefore I think it's a bit harsh to
automatically jump on a DJ for wanting to get payed even if he doesn't
play.  You as the promoter are paying the DJ not to spin elsewhere, and
even if your party doesn't happen that DJ still is not spinning anywhere
else.

Cancelling a party days or even weeks ahead of time is another situation;
and deserves to be treated differently depending on the amount of time left
before the party.

Throwing a party is a lot of work.  You must be willing to accept the
responsibility that comes with it.  When you organize a party you ask that
a great number of people give you their energy in return for something from
you.  Whether that something be money, love, happiness, or some other
object of life you must be willing to deal with everyones individual
expectations and the hassles that come when expectations aren't met.  It's
rough, and there's a lot of pitfalls and people who aren't up front about
things, but you have to realize this and prepare for the worst.

I'm not saying you shouldn't trust people to come through for you when
you're planning a party; I'm just saying you should recognize the pitfalls
and consequences involved and be prepared for them.  Each scene has it's
own, and each promoter has their own way of dealing with them.  That's what
makes a party unique (and what sets a good promoter apart from the crowd),
being able to recognize where the potential for trouble exists and
directing energy and scrutiny towards that area.

Thanks for listening, and remember to thank your promoters.

I know that I've already asked but since I've had NO response I thought
I'd try again.  Does anyone know what's going on this weekend?  What events
are happening?  Especially Saturday night.  I know, I know, this has nothing
to do with tragedies in Bosnia or Mexico, it has nothing to do with screens
and screens worth of proposed bills in congress or what Cyberspace means to
us as people but I thought this was a rave listserver.  maybe I was wrong.
If so, let me know and I'll unsubscribe.

I gotta respectfully disagree wid my buddy Milt.

For your consideration:


DJ X dj's for a livin. No other job. He's good and people pay to see him.

Dj X is asked by A to play at their party. 

DJ X sez:

"sure! $400. Is that cool?"

A:
"Ok... we'll pay u $400!"
DJ X:
"Cool.. it's a deal!"


B is also throwing a party. S/he calls DJ X.
"Wanna play at my party Sat Nite, huh, huh, huh???"
Dj X:
"oops.. sorry.. gotta play at 'A's party."
B:
"Well pay ur $400 fee"
DJ X:
"Sorry.. really.. I told 'A' I'd do theirs"
B:
"Ok.. well try DJ Y.. c'ya"


some time goes by... :) It Sat Nite.



DJ X gets ready for 'A's party. A calls up...
A:
"We lost our space, man, do we still have to pay u"
DJ X:
"sure"
A:
"Thats not fair..."


Well...Econ 101 class.. it's fair :)
DJ X lost out on $400 from 'B' because he stuck to his contract.
It's called "opportunity cost", Milton,  me oul' flower. 
Group 'A' needs to know the risks of throwing a party.. running a business etc.
Ya gotta pay for the food even if no one comes to ur restaurant...:)

Simply Done is the best party 
I have been to in a long long time.
Feeling a bit omniscient - i'll just refer to it 
as the Most Fabulous Weekly on the Planet.
I am, actually, at a loss for words...

Extract of House People
100% Superstars

Mr Hardkiss played the first non-bullshit set I've heard from him.
It was really good.  I don't know who played next - maybe Mark Farina.
I have not been connected to a dj like that in ages.  This party took
off around 1 or so.  You could call it old school but that is a load of
crap, in my opinion.  A party like that is timeless.  It is all times.
A seemless connection with every peak moment in the entire history
of, well, whatever the hell you wanna call it ...  
It is really really really fun
I was Worked 


Oooooohhh Sweeties!  I Have Some Sugar for You !!
Pacific is doing the One Off of my dreams this Saturday - 
The Fat Albert gang has hooked up with my school girl sweetheart 
Nancy Drew and I WANT IT TAG TEAM  - Can you feel the subsonic feedback 
loop we have going here??  Throw Down.  Spread the LOVE.

the Come-Unity anniversary are the sure shots.  Some things to

If life were about economics no one would throw parties, much less attend 
them.

> from san jose(yes, I've heard this sed at parties!?), 14 year olds on E,

I don't understand what the rave community has against us "kids".  I'm a 
14 year old raver, and it really sucks not being able to go to most of 
the really sic raves around here.   I mean if the only reason is so that 
alchohol can be served than that is just B.S., nobody needs booze to 
rave!  i am the Kid in the above description (except I'm not from san 
Jose).  I think many more parties should be open to all ages!
Just my 2 cents worth.

It will die out fast. It realy sucks to have this commercial sorta
charting going on within this music. 

"Hey man, have you heard the new Madonna? It's number one on the KMEL charts!"
"Yeah, Dj Pierre played it 18 times in one night. It's the record to have,
gotta get it."

"Can you beleive Jeno played that MC Hammer trak last night. Man that
record was played out weaks ago."
"Awww, Jeno's wack man. I heard he didn't even buy that Madonna record.
He's still playing progresive-christian-gabber, he don't even have any
power-pop-jungle-noise."

Very well said Milton. Unfortunatly this has been going on for along time
now. There's the Djs point of view that their scraping for money already &
they could have gotten booked somewhere else if they would've known your
party wasn't going to happen, but promoters often lose lots of money when
something goes wrong & are not able to throw more parties. I personaly
don't beleive it's possible to rely on Dj'ng to pay the rent & still be
playing for the love of it.

About the bad people from S.J., who "kill the scene".  I have to disagree,
there's tons of nice people down here and if you don't have a car well then
you're damn lucky if you can even get to a party.  Plus the 14 year olds on
E, what gives?  Didn't know there was an age limit on raving. . .

I agree.. If a DJ didn't charge the promoter, the promoter will probably
do the same thing again.. My experience with some rave
promoters is that they have this incredibly cavalier attitude about
people who work for a living..

Luckily, there are a few who don't.. and they have kept the scene alive..

A deal is a deal.. It would be different if the DJ hadn'ty shown up..
But since the promoter had scheduled him to play.. they should
pay him.. esp since he lost other engagements..

Any court would feel the same way.

yeah i almost was gonna go for exactly that reason, but then we all sort 
of decided not to go for various reasons (e.g. we were all sick with the 
same cold, etc) and now i remember my promise to myself--NEVER EVER more 
than $20.  so i hope our awesome scene can keep prices down so i don't 
have to stop raving for the same reason i stopped going to dead shows...

Dear Sfraves;

	I was reading Milton's rave and kinda have to agree. The scene is 
about music not about performers or DJ's. The music must come first and 
should come first and of course the people all of us. If you are a 
promotter and don't have a lot of money to invest don't hire big name 
DJ's, or you risk haveing what happned to Milts friends. Whether you have 
big name DJ's or not; people will come for the music not the DJ's; at 
least thats what I come for; I never know or care for that matter or 
spinning up there; I'm there for the music, my friends; my frieneds that 
I haven't met yet; to dance and particpate in a celbration of love life 
and the pursuit of happiness which to me = LIBERTY. Even if you didn't 
have any "DJ'S" if you throw a rave; people are going to come for the 
music; what and who is a DJ anyway someone who has a lot of really cool 
records and knows how to mix them. Its about the music; I image if you 
ask most "DJ's" this they will say that the people Us aren't here to see 
them; there here for the music. Thats what I thought it was about. For 
someone to make money at spinning records; in my opionion they should 
consider that a wonderful gift that all of us give to them. I'm not 
saying that there isn't any talenet or skill in what a DJ does; there is 
because I couldn't do what they do in a very c-he-sive way. But then 
again look at Goa Gill?. ITS ABOUT THE MUSIC PEOPLE!!!!!!!! THE MUSIC!!!!!

Dear Sfraves;

	Being a kid is realy tough. I remmeber not being able to go 
concerts because I was to young. It really sucked then and I image it 
really sucks know. The problem for most older people is thatkids do 
things(not that older people don"t) that seem to be really crazy, cruel, 
and dumb. The difference that when older people do it  we go to jail; so 
the numbers of instances that these unfortuate things happen are 
slim; with kids the damage gets done and theres no one to hold 
responsible. Liablility is another problem if something happenes to a kid 
at a rave; most of the time the parents sue the promoters; and win; for 
something that the kid did; and ended up getting hurt in the process. 
Which usually ends up with that particualr promoter going to jail or 
spending the rest of his life paying out of his pocket for something the 
kid did. It doesn't seem very fair if your the promotter to have to be 
legally responsible for someone elses kids; but throw an all ages thing 
and something happens to Bobbie; even if its Bobbies dump high fault and 
look who gets the blame. There nothing wrong with being young and there 
nothing wrong with being old and wanting that separttion. Another concern 
is of course that womyn/girl you end up talking with that tells you she's 
18+ and you take her home only to find the cops knocking on your front 
door at 7AM and thats when you find out she's only 17 and guess what 
buddie your going to jail. Doesn't seem very fair does it(scarcassitically)

The DJ's invest their money to purchase the records to play at the raves 
which you run to in order to meet those precious friends of yours whom 
you don't know.

> big name DJ's or not; people will come for the music not the DJ's; at 

Now who in the hell goes to a rave *solely* because of a particular DJ's 
presence, except for the most stylin' of club kids?  The fundamental 
mistake you've made is that you're *separating* the DJ and the music.  I 
went to Digitaria because (among other things) I knew Josh Wink would be 
there and I know that he plays good stuff.  The 'people' you are speaking 
for, if they have half a brain among them, will come for the music and 
the DJ--promoters try to get big name DJ's precisely because they bank on 
this concept.

> I never know or care for that matter or spinning up there

Then you deserve the next shitty party you attend.

Who is playing the music, smart guy?

It took me three days of practice before I could pull off a decent beat 
match.  A DJ is precisely what you said.  A lot of really cool records = 
a lot of money invested.  Knows how to mix them = practice.  Geez, think.

> in my opionion they should consider that a wonderful gift that all of

Oh my god, you are so completely full of shit.

I understand the need and desire for community, and the elimination of 
barriers, and the want to come together, but I refuse to expect anyone to 
put on a party for free, or render their services for free, so that I can 
forget about the effort involved in putting it on.  When I go to free 
ones, you can bet I donate when asked, because when I leave and go home 
to sleep, someone else has to stick around and clean up.

Who's gonna play the music if you aint got any dj's? *GOOD* music is the
most important thing. You need good dj's if you want good music, not
necesarily expensive dj's, but good ones.

Dear Sami;

	The reason were all part of this; I feel anyway is the music; not
the DJ's. No one told them to invest their money in House, Techno and
Trance records; they did it for the love of the musical genre. When this
genre of music first appeared there were no Josh Wink's and Pierre ...etc
just the music, the machinces making it, and the people creating it. I
will still stand by my statement saying that I go for the music, and have
never been to a "shitty party". The music and the people at the party
make the party not the DJ's; they are just the individuals who play the
music for the people. In the end the people decide whats played not the
DJ's; if a DJ were to start spinning trash; then the people at the party
would either tell him through body language ie not dancing, or verbally eg
the DJ sucks, play something else. Anyhow the music has always been
there to do what it does for me, no matter were I'm at, who I'm with, or 
for that matter who's spinning it. I think people put to much emphazies on
who's spinning rather than on who's created the music, how many people can
you walk up to on the scene and ask; who's that, that so and so spinning;
and get an accurate response, Rather; everyone seems to know who's
spinning though. Go fiqure; shouldn't the credit at least go to the people
who created this fantastic music, rather than who's cueing it up. 
If you remember the Cd Frequencies by LFO; they start out my saying: 

"House"
"What is House"
"Technotronic, KLF, or something you live in"
"To me House is Phuture Pierre Fingers Adonis etc"
"The Pioneers of the Hypnotic Groove, Brian Eno, Tangerine Dream, 
Kraftwerk, Depeche Mode, & The Yello Magic Orchestra"
"This sound is deadicated to you"
"House"

I don't here them mentioning any names of DJ's; though I'm sure they are 
indebited to a few. For if it wasn't for the DJ's spinning this new 
music in clubs; chances are that it would never have reached the point it 
has, but the DJ's still had to love the music in order for them to spin it.
It makes me annoyed that hardly anyones knows who created this music and 
I feel unless we honnor the creators; not the DJ's who spin it; this genre 
will go by and by. Because unless there is new input into the genre the 
DJ's will have nothing new to spin. 

	Sami I'm not saying anyone should put on a party for free; I think
you took a lot of what I said out of context. The point or my 2 cents
worth of the whole thing was the DJ vs The Music thing. I'm not 
separtating them; I just giving my version of what I feel is an important 
reality check here. Emphazises not separtation.

	If you going to quote me; please include the whole paragraph or
sentence where appicatable; not just the stuff so you can make your point.
I see you didn't mention the stuff about Goa Gill who doesn't beat match;
who just plays records.  Parties cost money there no doubt in anyones mind
there; if Miltons friends had to pay the DJ's even though the venue was
cancelled I would have had an impromptto house party somewhere at the last
minute and at least gotten my moneys worth eg gotten the DJ's who
requested to be paided to spin there. I don't like it when I hear about
anyone working hard to put something together for the benefit of all and
at the last minute due to things behond anyones control it going flatt. It
was unfortuate and my heart goes out to those guys. The world needs more
compassion Sami and I practice what I preech. 

	I see and am sorry we disagree; but to say that "I'm completely
full of shit" is wrong, for I speak from my heart, mind and soul, and am
not stating facts to be measured in true false. But stateing how something
makes me feel. You are not me; and not in my psyche; so to make that
statement I feel is inappropreiate behaviour for someone on the staff at
hyperreal. I have taken offense to your statement that I mentioned earier.
I don't mind critizium and in fact welcome it; its part of how we grow as
beings; but I draw the line at profanity and character assiation. I'm
sorry that you choose such strong words to make your point; I think it
could have been done in a much less offensive way. Anyhow people who know
and love me know that I do mean well; and have a heart of gold; so I bid
you well and hope than when we eventually meet; that we both will be able
to do it with a smile and a hug. Goodnight Sami & pleasent raver
dreams....:)

I must disagree with Brian Darkness minimizing the role of the DJ. They 
are crucial to a party. Yes they play other peoples music but mixing is 
an ARTFORM. Try beatmatching on a huge system and really creating a deep 
groove, its not as easy as you might think. Records also cost alot of 
money and DJing for a living is hard work. A party is a collective event 
and everybody's energy is important. I am not one to make DJ's into rock 
stars but they are definitely integral to a good party and thriving scene.

Dear Sfraves;

	First I would like to make a tone statement about my writing.
Unless otherwise noted my posts should be read with a smile; and are
always meant well and in a good nature. I have no animosity toward anyone
here on this list; and I never write/post when I in a bad mood. I callem
like I feelem. Thats it; if your reading more into than that your way off
base. 

	God I knew this one was going to get out of hand, I should have
stayed home and listened to my mom and became a podiatist. To again
clarify; god whatever happned to the written word. Where's the paverbial
hypertext god when you needem, and who the hell was it the asked me to use
paragraphs anyway. 

	Anyway; yes the DJ"s are important; they were the first people to
spin this music; but I find a lot of people know them better than they
know the creators of the music and I think and feel thats there to much
emphazis on them(DJ's) and not enough on the creators of the music. Better
yet; I'll even for the sake of clarity just say that there is not enough
emphais on the creators of this music in the scence; leaving the DJ's out
of it totally. But I will still stand by my friendly point. I don't know
that many people aside from the DJ's who at a rave can hear a song and say
oh thats LFO, Moby, 808 State ..etc, this includes myself. I feel that we
are not honnoring the people who create this music; thats all.
Arg!!!Beep!!!Click!!!!Crash!!!Bang!!!! Goodnight all and pleasent raver
dreams. I'm going to bed now with a smile on my face; a slightly
frustrated smile; but a smile none the less. :) It s good to be loved.

Then how about the precedent set in the media industry:
You spend Time writing an article with a Verbal contract to publish. If the
Editor spikes your article he pays you a Kill Fee, about 25% of what you
would have gotten.
Getting a full $400 for doing Zero Work seems like someone is getting
ripped off.
Unless of course, DJs have U2 aspirations....well then fuck rave ideology,
take the money and follow the movie industry precedent where you get paid
full rate for every call. And its Rave Hollywood, home of the million
dollar shit party, lets get the limo's and champagne for the future rave
royalty.

Well, life may not be about economics, but when money starts changing 
hands, it becomes business. 

The DJ vs. musician argument can go on forever, but if you compare it to 
the movie industry, I don't think most actors write their own lines 
either. Yet on the average, actors make quite a bit more than 
screenwriters. The DJs are the performers, and if it really didn't matter 
who was at the turntables, I guess noone (promoters and attendees) would 
mind if their names were just left off of the flyers and info lines. 
Obviously it does matter. Like an actor, a DJ is hired half for their 
performance and half for their reputation. A big DJ can give an otherwise 
unknown party a dose of credibility. And with 'no info til the day of the 
event' and a field of homogenous flyers a DJ is often the only way to 
distinguish one party from another. Whether they spin or not, they 
deserve something for that.

How much they deserve would be a large thread in itself. I don't know the 
conventions for performing artists, but I do know that a 'kill fee' is 
pretty standard in the graphic arts. If a client terminates a project in 
progress, they are usually responsible for paying for any work already 
completed (with a minimum of half the original fee). Sounds fair to me, 
though like I said conventions for performers may differ.

Hey, why is this even an issue?   If the party gets busted, almost always
the promoter has already collected 80% or more of what they're going to
collect otherwise.  With rare exceptions, the money is never refunded.
I say this as an unhappy customer of the "last" Chemistry, whose organizers
took my $20 for a party I never even got inside.  The DJs make the deal,
buy the records, practice, show up on time, give up the opportunity to
play other events, and someone expects them NOT to get paid?  Get REAL!
If there isn't an explicit agreement on a "kill fee" because of a bust
or whatever, the DJ should be paid 100% of the agreed amount period,
no questions asked.  This is and should be SOP.  DRC told me about
being booked in both Portland and Atlanta last year, and though she
didn't get to play in either place for different reasons, she got her
fee plus the agreed expenses.  That is how it should be.

I have a little problem with this "honor-the-creator" concept.  At a
rave, we experience music that is mixed and presented in a context that
completely transcends any one  "creator".  How about all the samples 
that come from other "creators"?  How about the technology that makes 
the music possible?  The recording engineers?  The party's sound system 
and the people that tweaked it for us?   

How do we "honor" all these creators?  It's simple.  We dance our asses
off and share our joy and give some money so that *everyone* who helped
make the *whole* thing possible will do it again.  

ps. Brian, the "sacred" art of massage that you so eloquently described
enables you to get into parties for free, after which you charge $1 a
minute (1st 5 free).  But DJs should spin for free?  Hmm.  Likewise, you
readily admit that even *you* don't know who the "creators" of the music
are.  Y'know, I bet that many professional DJs are as idealistic as you
are about the music.  But as we know, one of the most difficult things
in life is trying to live up to our own ideals.

otay... my last word.. :)

pick ur favorite 20-30 cuts from this/last year.
play them one by one..turn the records..pop in the cds etc.
note the gaps of silence btw songs!

what happens? 
Well at least for me.. pretty good music..but the intros to these songs
weren't that good.. and some sorta wimp out at the end.. and that silence
btw songs.. that really sux...no groove.. no crescendo..no "Ill take u there"

now let a good DJ take those same cuts... (I know all this is hypothetical)
and it's different... 
s/he mixes out the crummy intros...
s/he builds a vibe (no silence)...
s/he "takes u there" 

Now.. thats given that u can even get those favorite cuts. 
Any fool can buy 808 State at Tower...
but try buying some Atom/Astral Matrix/Trilogy/Robotman anywhere!!!
If ur "all digital" like Brian Darkness.. u cant even get tham at all..period.

imho, the music is the egg/sugar/butter...
but the DJ's make the cake. And some cake can taste good.. and some cake
can taste bad!

90% in agreement with you crunch.  We arrived at 12:45 or so, 
unfortunately missing the jungle set in the beginning and arriving well into 
acid set.  Nice change of pace from the housey vibes at Kommotion that 
nite.  Anyway, hard acid was just what I needed and Atomicon dished it 
out.  Unfortunately, they closed up at 5:00 or so, a little too soon for 
me.  What Atomicon needs is is Atomicon #3: more people, more visuals.  
Still burning in my mind is  "Zippy-dee-doo-da, zippy-dee-day" mixed over 
hard acid.  Unreal--

'til next time,

Anyone know where to get a copy of the Hardkiss CD Delusions of Grandeur? I
read about it in a recent issue of Wired, but I haven't been able to find
it anywhere... The techno/ambient buyer at Rasputins says it's just hype,
and it doesn't really exist. Is this true? Is it a promotional release
only? Any info would be appreciated.

*We are not Zapatistas*
*Testimonies of the Tojolabales: We were tortured by the
Mexican Army
 
Oscar Camacho Guzman, correspondent, Comitan, Chiapas, Feb.
15
 
Mario Alvarez is 40 years old and Alfredo Santis Jimenez is
33.  Both are Tojolabales indians and they are denouncing
the same act: "We were tortured by the Mexican Army."
 
"When the Mexican Army came into Chiapas," they explain,
"they detained us and then they kidnapped us.  From Friday
until Monday. In Tuxtla they put bags on our heads, they
beat us, they shocked us, they asphyxiated us.  Here are the
marks, all over our bodies.  They beat us until they made us
sign some sheets with knowing what they said, and then they
let us go, saying that if we talked they would return and
kill us.
 
Alfredo Santis and Mario Alvarez gave their testimonies on
Tuesday night, in the office of the Independent Center of
Farmworkers and Peasants (CIOAC), here in Comitan, where
they say they returned after being gone for four days.
 
Luis Hernandez Cruz, leader of CIOAC in Comitan, gave them
housing, denounced the acts to the mass media, demanded
justice and criticized harshly the president, because "a
military solution in Chiapas was not correct, as it is
causing persecutions and violations of human rights."
 
Alfredo Santis Jimenez speaks Spanish; Mario Alvarez
doesn't, and he gave his testimony with the help of an
interpreter.  Both agree; they both give an account of the
same events. Both of them "dared" to speak because even more
than the fear they have, they "do not want this injustice to
happen to others."
 
Mario as well as Alfredo Santis stated that they were
detained on Friday at the Chiapas collective farm, when they
were returning from work on the Nuevo Momon collective farm
to their respective communities. They also stated that in
Tuxtla they could see another "four or five" detainees and
that they also heard that among the detainees was "an
elderly man" whom they were saying had killed Coronel Hugo
Manterola in Nueva Mormon on the day that the Mexican Army
entered the conflict zone.
 
Continuing the testimony, taperecorded and filmed, of
Alfredo Santiz:
 
"We were working, over there on a small piece of land, and
when we got to the Chiapas collective farm, the armies (that
is what the indigenous call the soldiers of the Mexican
Army) were already there, and there they stopped us and
arrested us."
 
"They took us in an Army car to Comitan, spread eagle,
without our knowing where we were going.  They put a
military cap on us, a military vest, and they took us
covered with mud, inside the car.  From there we went to the
headquarters, and they made us spreadeagle again. They took
off our clothes, pants, shirts, everything. They put us
spreadeagle, and they put him spreadeagle on top of me, like
a cross."
 
"Then, They put us back in the same car that they had taken
us out of, and they took us to the military airport.  There
a doctor came and checked us to see if we had any illness. 
After the doctor checked us, a soldier came and took notes,
without our knowing what he was writing.  When he had
finished writing, he made us put our fingerprint on it.  It
was five or six pages.  
 
>From there, once we signed the papers, they put us in a
helicopter, to go to Tuxtla.  They took us on our knees,
with the soldiers, and once we got to the airport, they gave
made us spreadeagle. They called someone at the military
headquarters so that an army car would come and take us to
the headquarters.  Within a half an hour it came and they
took us again spreadeagle.
 
Then getting to the headquarters they put us spreadeagle and
they told us that I should prepare myself and that my
companero would go with them.  He was the first one to be
tortured.  I heard him yelling and then one of the torturers
came out to talk with me.
 
     "Now you have to tell me some things and if you do not
tell me the truth, you will have to stay here.  You are
going to tell how many Zapatista soldiers there are in the
collective farm, who are the Zapatista leaders, how many
arms they have".
 
What is one to say, that I am a member of CIOAC.
     
     "And what is this CIOAC" he asked.
 
"It is an orgnaization that works on projects for the
community" I told him.
 
     "No, no it isn't.  You have tell everything you have
seen regarding the EZLN, you have seen those of the EZLN."
 
I don't know anything, I told him.
 
     "Well, if you don't want to say, if you do not want to
talk, wait a minute.  Soon I am going to come back for you,
there you will tell me."
 
If you want me to do something, well kill me, but I am going
to tell you that I don't know anything, I told him.  About
10 or 15 minutes later, they came to get me. When I went in
where my compa was, he was hanging from his hands, with a
hood over his face, badly beaten, and they had taken off his
clothes, his pants, he was completely naked."
 
     "Now you see how things are", he told me, "if you do
not tell how many Zapatistas there are in your collective
farm, that's what we are going to do to you."
 
Sirs, what am I going to tell you; I don't know anything.
 
     "Well if you're not going to talk, lie down face up",
he told me.
 
Then he brought a chair that had an iron bar underneath, and
he put me face up, and he put the chair's iron bar over my
throat. Then one of them, the fattest one, came and sat on
the chair. I couldn't breathe.
 
     "You are going to answer my questions", he told me.
 
But what am I going to say, I told him.  He sat down again.
What am I going to say if I don't know anything. We aren't
Zapatistas.  Then when I was recuperating a little, he sat
down again. Then he brought a nylon bag, and he put it over
my head, tied it tight, and cut off my air.  I fell.  I kept
opening my mouth because I wanted to breath and couldn't get
any air. Then he covered my mouth with his hand, and then I
fell, and he picked me up again.  Then I saw him go for some
buckets of water, and then he threw them on me, all over,
and he went to connect an electric cable. He said:
     "Now yes, you are going to answer my questions".
 
Then he put his leg in my stomach, and on my head, but it
was when he put the electric cables on my private parts, on
my head, that I lost my mind.  With such torture that he did
to me, I tell you, then yes, yes the Zapatistas came to us,
because of the torture.  I told him that I am Zapatista,
even though the truth is I'm not a Zapatista.  But I told
him there were some who came to visit with us, with such
pain.
 
And he asked me what kind of firepower they had, did they
have 60 high power weapons.
 
I don't know, I told him.
 
"Why the f--- not"
 
And he put the cables on again, and he brought a knife. He
scraped our bodies, and he brought some pliers, and he
squeezed our tongues. He squeezed my tongue with the pliers. 
He told me he was going to pull out my molars. And that's
when I told him again, yes we have arms, a few small high
powered arms, but for war."
 
"No, how the f... are they not for war, if this weapon that
they have is for killing somenone. How the f...not?
 
And again he tortured me and asked "Where are the caves
where they hide the weapons?  How big is it?, Is it big or
small?
 
And I didn't tell him, and he put the cables on me again,
everywhere he wanted to, and then I told him that there was
a small cave where we hid the weapons, but it was because of
the torture and it wasn't the truth. And a federal Public
Minister told me he was writing it all down.  And from there
he told me:
"And the cathechists, how many cathechists are there. 
You're not going to say that there aren't cathechists.  What
do they say in the churches? What do they say during their
sermons?
 
"The cathechists carry out the word of God..."
 
"How the f... are you going to deny that the cathechists are
the ones giving the bad ideas to those who join the
Zapatistas and who say the government is bad, is rich.  Tell
me it isn't so."
 
And then he tortured me again.  He stuck his knife like
this, here, here and here (in the chest and back).  Then I
told him yes, that the cathechists sometimes look for the
parts that say that the rich are the enemies of everyone,
that they are rich and that whoever gets authority, as the
government, they always want all of the power.
 
"Then I have some names of cathechists and if you don't tell
me if you know any of them, I am going to kill you here with
a pistol."
 
"He put a large pistol like that (he said pointing to his
temple) and he had three names of cathechists.
 
"This Gregoria is from there?"
 
I don't know him.
 
"How the f... don't you know him?  This Guillermo is he from
there?
 
Yes
 
And this Roberto?
 
Him too, and like that I continued talking, because of so
much torture.  Well then he took notes again, and now I've
said everything that he asked me. He put me face down again,
and I thought it was because he was going to let me go. Then
he put the electric cables on me again. He put them here
(with one hand pointing to his buttocks and the other to the
high part of his back).
 
And that's when I began getting bent back, doubled
backwards, because of the electrical shock.  Then he put me
face up again, and he put coke in my eye. He filled it with
coke, and I couldn't see. Then I cleaned it out.
 
"Wipe your eyes" he told me.
 
I was face up, like this, and he had the knife like this,
and he stopped.  He had it high above me, and then he let it
go towards my eye, but it didn't hit me.  It came that
close, that close (right next to his head).  And he did that
five or six times; he'd hold it up high and then let it go,
but it never hit my eye. And that's how we were tortured. 
Then from there since I had said so much under torture, they
took us out, and they had written down everything I had
said."
 
"You have to repeat everything again." he told me.
 
"And I said it all again, and sometimes I forgot something,
because when you lose your mind, you can't remember what you
said. Then I would begin my statement again, but I missed
some of it."
 
"You are going to tell or I will put these on again."
 
"Then I struggled, struggled to remember, and I asked him to
help me a little because I just couldn't do it.  I was
really bad off, and so it was partly his statement and
partly mine.  Then after everything was stated, three others
came.  There are three of them who do the torturing.
 
"Now we are going to let you go free.  We are going to let
you go.  You have made your statement.  You helped us a
little.  But if you go and tell anyone that we have tortured
you or beaten you, if tomorrow we find out that you are
talking with anyone about being tortured, we are going to
bring you back here.  What you are going to do, if anyone
asks if you were beaten, or if anyone hit you, you are going
to say no.  You aren't going to tell anyone."
 
No, no I'm not going to tell, I said.
 
"Are you thirsty?" he asked me.
 
"Yes, yes I'm thirsty", I told him; I was really f...
 
Do you want a soda?, he asked me.
 
" Yes, and then he gave me a soda, a coke, but I couldn't
drink because of the pain here (pointing to his throat). And
about an hour later he came back again.
 
"Why are you sad? Why do you look like that? What's wrong?"
he asked me.  " Why the long face?"
 
"It's because I am in alot of angina and fire in my mouth."
 
"Why" he said
 
"I don't know. Maybe because I don't have a jacket nor
anywhere to lay down, just my poor body like this," I told
him.
 
"No one hit you? Are you being treated well? Have you
eaten?" he asked.
 
"Yes"
 
"That's what you have to say; if not, they going to get you
again."
 
"In the morning he came again early, " How are you?  How's
your angina?"
 
"It's bad. I couldn't eat. I hurt alot, because it's very
cold.  Just like that he came back every hour or two. Not
always the same guy.  Sometimes the one who tortured me;
sometimes a soldier came to ask how I was, if I was well, if
I was being treated well.  And that's how I was handling it.
It didn't matter that I was hurting here and here, and above
all my tongue, so much that I couldn't talk.  That's how we
spent Saturday and Sunday. After awhile a soldier came and
told us:
 
"Just wait awhile.  Now they've given us the order to kill
you. Just wait a little while, and we're going to kill you."
 
"Ay! We got sad again, and sometimes we cried.  What were
our children going to do?  But the day went by, and then
Sunday night the federal Public Minister came and said that
they were going to bring medicines. But it wasn't until
early Monday morning that they brought us the medicines, but
it didn't ease the pain.
 
And then the Public Minister read to us what we had said. 
And he said that they weren't going to torture us anymore.
And a little later they let us go.  They give us 30 pesos
for the bus, and they told us not to tell anyone, because if
we did, they would bring us back..."

Radio Germany: Mexican Police Use Torture - 2/21/95
17800khz 6:00 AM EST
Transcript follows:
 
     In Mexico, it is reported that police used torture on four
of seven people arrested two weeks ago on suspicion of being
linked to the indian rebels in Chiapas.
 
     The Mexican Human Rights Commission says that all seven
were forced to sign confessions.
 
     It was reporting on 24 complaints received since President
Ernesto Zedillo ordered an offensive against the rebels in
Chiapas state on the 9th of this month.
 
     The Commission alleges that the five men and two women
arrested in Varacruz were not even allowed to read what they are
claimed to have confessed.

First of all i need to say that i agree with *everything* that Sami said. 
My points are below.

but *where would raves be without them*? It took dj's like Paul Oakenfold 
and Danny Rampling to *bring the music to the people*..You would have NO 
RAVE and NO MUSIC. If English DJ's hadn't brought Chicago acid house from 
Ibiza back to the UK and start playing it...There would be NO RAVES and 
you'd STILL be dancing to sub-disco crap as if it were still 1985.

But you would NOT HAVE HEARD *ANY OF IT* if the DJ's didn't PLAY IT. You 
*WOULDN'T* have. it's simple. This music started in clubs and parties, 
played by DJ'S. the rave scene has always revolved around DJ culture! I 
LOVE it! I *am* a dj! It's about loving the music and wanting to share it 
with others! but when you're spinning - you come to a point where you 
either have to 1)start getting paid or 2) stop dj'ing, unless you're rich.i
can't afford to be buying records to keep up. maybe *you* can...

Man what can i say but that you really have no clue, and no respect for 
the people who take time and money to bring you good music. I agree that 
the music is the thing - but you don't get it. The DJ"s role is 
*invaluable*. It is *your* responsibility to know the music. i go to 
parties and see kids who have no clue what the music is...and it's up to 
YOU to seek out who does the music. I do it, other kids do it, other dj's 
do it, but most ravers do NOT do it, including you it seems, and that's 
the sad part. It's what i hate about raves today - the kids don't know 
the music anymore, and that's cause the make NO EFFORT TO. The DJ gives 
you all this incredible music and no, credit won't be given until you 
FIND OUT WHO DOES IT. How the hell do you think that records sell so much 
when the only play they're getting is by DJ'S (ahem) in clubs? people 
actually take the time to FIND OUT WHAT THE RECORD IS, thus making money 
for the people who made it (as well as recognition). YOU HAVE NO CLUE.

Man, ask the fucking people who created it and you'll find that 
they'llgive WHITE LABELS (with NO CREDITS) to dj's so it'll get played in 
clubs and people will dig it. For alot of artists, that's all they need - 
see peple getting off on their track!

no clue....when a DJ and a promotor make a deal (and dj's - use 
contracts. you'll be better off for it.), if that promotor says he is 
going to pay the dj the promotor has a *responsibility* to pay that dj. 
NOTHING is free, man.

What does this matter? I see you as making statements you have no idea 
about - being completely disrespectful, contradicting and mindless. This 
scene you claim to love so dearly works in ways you haven't grasped yet - 
my advice is start learning.

I have taken offense to 
your statement that I mentioned earier.

The reason that i back up *evrything* that sami said is that what you 
said has *ANGERED* me. You embody *everything* i hate about ravers today. 
Everything you said...i've bitched about it endlessly...you said things 
that *appalled* me - and the basic fact of that matter is you really nave 
no idea...your naivete doesn't bother me as much as your statements do.

 Anyhow people who know
> and love me know that I do mean well; and have a heart of gold; so I bid

Brian, i'm sure you do mean well...but you have *alot* of learning to do 
by your statements. I don't doubt that you're a nice person, just 
ignorant of how things work and a little self-centered in your view of 
this scene. If you'd like to know ,i'll be glad to tell you...Until 
then....realize that there is alot here that you do not understand.

see? you are completely missing the point. its not "djs VS music", the djs
are an integral part of the music!! who's gonna play it, if not djs, huh?
you? well then i guess you are a dj.

listen, if you've never done it, you dont know the incredible amount of work
and investment of $$ it takes to put together a set. you can't just walk into
a store and drop a wad of cash and expect to walk out with a wicked crate, it
takes literally YEARS of going to the stores, maybe twice a week or more and
listening to TONS of crap. then there is the hours and hours of practice, and
its sure not just learning to beatmatch, sequencing is far more important as
Goa Gil showed you. you think he hasn't spent alot of time thinking about how
the tracks will go together, trying to take you on a journey? and let not
forget the fact that at an average price of $10 a single (and you only play
one track off each single, price may vary depending on your blend of domestic
and imports:) for a 2 hour set assuming each tune is about 4 minutes long,

60 minutes * 2 = 120 minutes / 4 min/song = 30 songs * $10 = $300

starting to get the picture? thats $150 an hour, what most djs that have
"broken in" to some degree get paid. THEY ARE GETTING PAID AT-COST FOR THEIR
RECORDS. so quit bitchin when you don't even know what you are talking about

this trying to make some deep philosophical discussion over a very obvious
concept is quite annoying. think before you post.

namaste (and greetings from the nw)

i just gotta say, alot of my friends up here in vancouver are *itching* to
see Goa Gil spin (spin? i've heard he does everything on DAT).. to the extent
of driving down this summer specifically to hear him. or, alternatively, to
specifically fly to Goa beach to hear him :)

Where can this Kode IV be had? preferable mail-order... i'm assuming its a

Just to support what Lee had to say about "dj's as creators" - 

I don't think that DJ's are seen as a non - creative entity.  Exactly the
opposite - they have a tough job - there aren't too many artforms where the
"performer" is constantly listening intently to the audience for direction.
Most performers - take rock or whatever - use a set list.  This would be the
equivalent of playing mixed tapes at clubs.  Not quite the sam,huh?  The DJ
can dial in the exact mood of the evening.

As far as identity and music and the creator, I don't think that the
concrete identification of every record being spun is important.  What I
love about this scene is that there is an utmost focus upon the SONIC
component of the experience - there is no stage to stare at, no performer to
identify the music with.  They have all my respect through my ears and that
is all that matters.  If I hear something that is mindblowing you better
believe I am going to burn rubber over to the DJ to find out what it is.

In many parts of the world the idea of a singular "composer" is nonexistent
- there is simply a heritage of material to work from - one borrowing from
the other - the people of such a society can identify individual songs, and
certainly like some better than others, but the individual creator does not
neccessarily exist.  When the focus remains upon the music itself, and not
the personality, the biological growth of a genre will keep expanding.
Forever.

Darkness considers his words,

> If you going to quote me

The DJ works the crowd.  I have to believe that the creators
of the music have this in mind when they make it.

My friend realized the other week that "being a dj" for many
guys nowadays is the same as "being in a band" used to be.  
This was a revelation to her.  I thought it was obvious.
All those Heavy Metal bass players are spinning techno ...

I rarely recognize a dj or know who played unless someone
tells me.  This doesn't mean I don't have favorite djs.

I post, regardless of my mood.  If someone misunderstands
what you write - then you failed to communicate your ideas.
And on that note, I always "Get It", however, I also 
understand the concept of colloquialisms.

I like swearing although I've been told "it's beneath me".
Calling bullshit bullshit seems fairly straightforward and
easy to understand ... no confusion there.

Money in the Bank
I always encourage my friends to get Paid

I've also seen alot of misplaced innocence and trust when
people first get involved in a business deal.  It's a game
played by sharks - that game can be really fun if ya want to
play along but don't think you can bring your whole earth fantasy
world to the table and expect it returned in kind.  I personally
would stomp on ya the first chance I get.  If you can't deal 
with that you don't belong there in the first place.

To elaborate, I also think it is a matter of maturity to be
able to separate something like a business deal from your personal
feelings.  Call it a mutual understanding.  Getting stomped on
is one of the best ways to learn a few good moves.

I hope my manicurist isn't on speed,
Dave

I absolutely and totally agree.  I am no dj by any means, but *anybody* 
can slap on a record.  Not everybody can bring an entire room of people 
to incredible heights and milk it for all its worth!  It takes a great 
deal of talent to do that.  I respect that in a dj with those talants and 
anyone who has been to more than one rave can attest to what I've said.
my 2 cents for the day......

    I really confused 'bout all this Jungle shit. I mean, I keep hearing
people say they would like to hear more Jungle at parties. Yeah....I guess
that's cool 'n' all....to each his own. BUT, is it really possible to dance
to this stuff for more than ten minutes without passin' out? Don't get me
wrong, I DO like Jungle, as much as I like hardcore. Yet, I could only listen
to it, feel it, and maybe stomp my foot to it, but not dance to it. I've seen
people dance to it, but most people quit dancing, sit down, and wait for
something slower.
    Now my questions are: Is it possible for anybody to dance to Jungle all
night long? Would YOU guys prefer to dance to acid, trance, blah, blah, blah,
or would you prefer to dance to hardcore/jungle, blah, blah, blah?............
after all, it could depend on what kinda mood yer in.. :)

The issue started because a party lost their space a few days before it 
was going to happen, and the DJ's still demanded to get paid.  No money 
was collected, and an enterprising DJ could probably still find work on a 
few days notice (hours maybe?).  Of course if a party were to get busted 
*while* it was in progress after a good chunk of change had been 
collected, it's a whole different ballgame even if the DJ didn't play.

Umm, can we drop this stupid thread now?  It's obvious everyone has
different opinions about what they scene can and should be.  I was attracted
to the rave scene first by the music and then by the fact that everyone here
was respectful of others' ideas.  What was that old saying... PLUR?

Does this not apply anymore?  Has rave changed so much that it's just like
every other crappy part of society?  Everyone here is at a different level
of experience, it's a constant learning process and that's a good thing.  

Let me ask you this:  when you went to your first rave, did someone come up
to you and say, "No clue.  You just don't get it man."  If they had, would
you still be raving?

Dammit!  You guys were the most loving, giving people last summer and were
so supportive of each other.  That's always what has made the SF scene so
special.  Did we decide to give that up?  I didn't get the fucking memo.

Everyone's got their opinions, some of them you'll agree with, some of them
you won't.  But we're all human beings trying to do something positive here
in this scene, and we all deserve a fucking chance.  If raving no longer has
anything to do with trying to make things better, then I don't know what to
say.  Who's gonna rewrite the hyperreal archives?  I guess we gotta dump
that shit about PLUR and The Spirit of Raving.  (I for one still try to live
by what our good sister Laura wrote about PLUR.)

Hopefully the disrespect I've seen from a few do not speak for the
majority on this list.  If you still believe in what this scene was built
on, say something, otherwise I gotta start a new scene.

Dear All;

	Thanks for your many ideas thoughts comments with reference to
this DJ's vs Music thing I see I have a lot to learn; and welcome it; I've
learned a lot already Ouch.  I wish there was an easier softer way. I
never meant to be disrespectuful to anyone. I was just making what I
thought was a vauable point thats all, and look at what I learned from it.
I got the attention of some of the people who really contribute to the
scence; and learned from them; it was painful but worth it. I will say one
thing about this thrashing I got; that I'm feeling a little gun shy at
this point; and if you see me and my massage table at ravers in wonderland
I could really use a hug. Thanks & Ouch!!!! :)

     ..Good point! And lets not forget how much 'crap' techno and house 
     music is out there.... and every dj I know/see/etc., spends a LOT of 
     time going through and 'researching' for new material. It's part of 
     the job, but hey, that time spent counts too!

Jeez, I agree on disagreeing but I think Brian Darkness got trashed on!  
When I see those kinds of flames going on, it makes me gunshy myself 
cause I am rather sensative.  I do post what I feel, and I realize people 
may disagree with what I say, but I am not expecting to be burned to the 
extent Brian did.  I think if you are insulted, you should e-mail that 
person privately rather than totally trash that person.  It is called 
being respectful and *everyone* deserves respect whether or not you agree 
with what he or she says.          Think about it......

luv to all,
Amy

uhhh... Paul Okenfield? hehehe yeah right. There has always places to go
in the states to hear house & acid since the begining. Of course it didn't
get big until they brought the *rave* buzzword back from England. The guys
who created & played the music (Knuckles, Pierre) had alot more to do with

I don't get all these people who are expecting to get paid money in return
for buying & researching music they supposedly love. They have this notion
that they are spending time & money, not that they are just doing what
they want to be doing. Ravers gotta pay for parties, they do it not
expecting to get paid back for having fun, Dj'ng is not work. If the love you
get from playing the music for yourself *aint enough* & you have to go out and
play parties & get *paid* for it to be worth your while then you probably
should quit. I hate this notion of keeping up, this aint a race. I spend
all I can buying what *I* like, not trying to keep up with the latest hits.

> NOTHING is free, man.

Gee, I didn't know they had put a monetary value on love, fun, happiness
& anger already. I guess I just don't keep up.

You are so fucking self-rightous man. Who put you on the know-it-all
pedastal above all those supposedly ignorant ravers. While I may have
disagreed with some of the statements made by Brian, I was sickened by
this out and out attack on him made by you. There is no "right way" for
somebody to think.

But, and I always have one :), but in this case, the same DJs who do not
accept a postponement have also FLAKED WHEN BOOKED and not sed anything.
Imagine having "DJ sumthin' else" and the ho don' show!

Does HE come up with the 500 papayas? If they gonna play the game, it
should work both ways. But maybe I just need to chill out:).............

Of course these djs are doing what they want to be doing, but that 
doesn't mean they shouldn't get paid for it.  Yes, ravers pay to go to 
parties, but most have jobs and such and going to parties is done in 
their leisure time - committed djs pretty much devote their lives to 
music, and I for one appreciate it enough that I'm willing to pay for 
it.  As for djs quitting if they expect to be paid...well, I'd hate to 
see it, as most of my favorite djs wouldn't be able to keep spinning, as 
they'd have to find other means of paying rent, buying food, etc.  I'm 
glad you buy what you like, and the djs I know do the same, but in order 
to buy enough music to play good, original sets week after week, they 
need to get paid for the job they do.  And yes, djing is work.  For 
many, it's a full time job.  Just because you enjoy doing something 
doesn't mean it's not work...
Just my $.02.

Jim

I guess kids aren't included in your one nation?  Shit, how can you say
"I don't care if you are black, white, gay, straight, dumb, smart, big, 
small, man, woman, you all are good.  but if your a kid, sorry, you are a 
little shit, and I don't want you around."  Well fuck you.  If you wanna 
fuck some young chick, thats your fault... you are just as likely to pick 
her up somewhere else....  blah blah I could go on forever, but I really 
don't want to start a huge flame war (though I'm sure this will.).

Exactly. It's a business, that's what our scene has become, a money maker
for way too many people.And then people gripe about the Sound factory or

Maybe younger people dance better than the old farts? maybe the kids remind

dunno?I accept everyone as a human first and last. Age, sex, race, status,
FUCK THAT!

Keep bringin' your wonderful self to parties, and anyone who won't welcome

milton, i understand what you are saying, but understand this: parties don't
just materialize out of thin air. love is just not enough: at a bare minimum,
promoters are going to have to PAY for venue(?), sound, and lights, and the dj
is going to have to pay for records. all the love we can possibly generate 
isn't going to make Massive Amplifier Corporation X and Struggling To Survive
Smalltime Record Label Y *give* you what you need to throw a party. so, 
an expense in generated and the money has to be brought from somewhere. as
much as it would be lovely for promoters and dj's to do it for free for the
love of it, fact is...

why the hell should promoters and dj's be expected to bear the entire cost
of the scene?

with a very few, and i mean VERY FEW, exceptions, there isn't anyone getting
rich off the scene (drugs excluded). i'm not saying all djs should be paid
$400 an hour, nor am i saying all parties should be $20. i'm just saying that
nothing is free. and thats the truth, ruth. 

i think what some are relly losing sight of is the fact that economics and
a good strong community vibe are *not* diametrically opposed. like it or
not they have always been working together and until the world become one
huge commune (yeah right), thats just the way its going to be.

You say "parties are about fun". well, for those throwing it, its about fun
too but fun on a different level, [ideally] the joy of bringing fun to others.
fact is you are running around so much trying to keep things together that
often the promoters/djs get very little chance to actualy sit back and enjoy
the party. to take a more standardized view, the promoters/djs are creating and
the attendees, of which this list seems to comprise mostly of, are CONSUMING.
granted, the crowd creates too, because there wouldn't be anything to consume
if there was nobody there, but isn't that the way it is with all media, all
art? the promoter/dj creates a space where that can happen. and creating that
environment takes bucks. so whats wrong with that? nothing.

i've totally forgotten what i started talking about
please note that this is really a reply to the last several posts i've seen
and not necessarily yours, milton :)

oh yeah! i think the whole dj+money+canceled show thing is easily
resolved by taking mikebee's suggestion, that is writing up real live 
contracts, then if the dj doesn't show there is recourse... i can see this
becoming more and more the standard, especially (and probably only) where
big names and big money (hence big risk) is involved.

gee, be glad i only get sfraves at work kids, that means i won't be posting
any more after 5:00pm

Oh, pish! The same DJ's have flaked and the people involved (another group,
not RIW) refunded all attendees their money 'cause so-n-so wasn't spinning.
No court was involved, and the mofo got paid, THAT'S BEING PROFESSIONAL.
And they never hired the bugger again.

yes, and the mid-south (you know, tennessee, mississippi, arkansas,
kentucky, florida...) they go 8 hours! I miss the trip to monterey/SC and
feel most SF residents are a bit spoiled, "oh, Gawd, I mean, like, it's and

I miss the drive to Bonny Doon. I miss the Sc crowd. Gotta have more

I pick my party vibe-wise. F&F is about vibe; few people have heard the djs
before. But when you get there, you feel like a frat oy on E "what have I

Okay, and I thought my hormones were being carbonized! look, Sami and
everyone, Jeno can spin his balls till their blue, if thier's no vibe, his
music falls on def ears. See what happened at the last Spundae (YUK! -a
quote from several people). If there is no-one, no dancing, no scerams of
joy, you may as well go get a good tape and dance naked in the garage.

Just don't tell anyone:)

yes, but too many have lost sight of this. The party is the people. The Djs
make the music that bring the people. But if it werent for US than we would
just be so much white trash at a Lynerd Skynerd concert popping qualudes
and beer.

Or assorted ethnic trash as well:)

I remember when I was 14 and would sneak into punk shows and work the dance 
floor right on! If you stick to going to clubs for fun like I have you will 
have a ball ahead of you. While most of us are tied to day jobs and sobby 
worn out marriage love tales... 

Get your buddies together and throw parties, it will probably be better then 
hanging with us old shits anyways.. You guys will have lot's of fun to look 
forward to in your 20's like online clubs through the net or whatever 
services that crop up and new and fun electronic stimulus and sound. 

Enjoy the dissidence and keep away from selective service... Age is a matter 
of being.

Bud-E, lemme tell you, yer 2 cents are on the monet!

Maybe younger people dance better than the old farts? maybe the kids remind
us fogeys that we grew up with disco or -shudder-new wave and bad drugs? I
dunno?I accept everyone as a human first and last. Age, sex, race, status,
FUCK THAT!

Keep bringin' your wonderful self to parties, and anyone who won't welcome
you has got the problem. Boy, am i on a rampage or what? Sheesh!

And get yer hug from the E-Bee!

Phred sez from hiz hed:

>collect otherwise. 

Yes, but ravers-n-wonderland got postponed by losing their site 2 days
before, because the space owner was busted. They collected no money, told
the Djs ahead of time, etc etc.

If it was a mid-bust fine, maybe.

You have nothing to be sorry about. Some people were rude to you. They
should be sorry. Others disagrred, but were clear and cool, and my respect
goes to them. 

No one should make you feel you "don't have a clue" they have some learning
to do. No one should tell you yer full of shit. We all are, till we take
that long, hard dump.

And I'm not the one who stared all this anyway. Money did. (oops, here we

Does anyone know if promoters regularly buy insurance 
against possible damages to the site or in case of possible 
law suit from someone who was hurt at the site? Do the 
venue owners share any liability in such an instance?

Just curious-

Dear Zack;

	I here your anger; but unfortuately thats the way it is. I felt
the same way you did when I was your age tring to see bands like MDC,
Minor Threat, DOA ..etc and did get it because i was 18 years old or 21
depending on the club. As I got older and started making friends witha lot
of the promoters a lot of them got busted for the things I mentioned in my
last letter; these were my friends that got busted because some little
punks from the suburbs came down and ruined it for everyone. Telling me to
go @#$% myself doesn't help your cause it only demonstrates that kids
can't be trust esp. in a public forum like hyperreal. I would trust you
even after that response because I understand people make mistakes; esp.
kids and need a lot of second chances. But I would take Atherton advice
and throw your own parties; this way when you are 18 yourr already in the
biss. Yes I do care; but there not much I can do to change laws that have 
been on the books for 100's of years. Like the song saids gotta keepem 
separtated; it sucks and I know its does.

Which is why we need great big outdoor parties this summer!!!

Imagine a world where spring never stops, where children laugh and dance
along with the birds and the simple forest creatures, where musicians
meditate beside waterfalls, composing new tunes that are played late into the
night to an appreciative audience of young nymphs, techno kids, rainbow
hippies, shamans and all who welcome happiness. This idyll awaits all who
rave outdoors this summer.



Fuck curfews, alchohol laws and seedy interiors - lets boogie into nature
so that everyone can enjoy SPRING.
and would'nt it be good if it was all FREE!!

I'm not saying that dj's should not get paid. I just don't beleive they should
be doing something they love(d) for work. If you need every single gig
to have a roof over your head & food in your stomach you are going to
do things you otherwise would not do. Alot of those guys have been
playing 3+ nights a week for the past 3 years with no break, while it is
respectable that they are still able to do this I don't beleive most of
them realy enjoy playing anymore. Don't you think that is unhealthy for
both the individuals artform & the scene. As for djs quiting if they
expected to be paid, I was talking about up&comers/beginers buying all
those records cause they were hoping/expecting to get paid back for them.
Most of the big dj's don't even buy that many records anymore, most of the
"hits" are gotten free as promos & they got enough to last em' years already.

Dear Fellow Brian's

English and maybe Yiddish; but thats spelled like Bryan. It ccomes from 
Irish kings and usually is refer to great strengh. If anyone knows any

Heres my 2 cents worth, now lets let this thread die hard.
  I know two kinds of D.J.s   ...   Those who PLAY records...and love it 
  and those who WORK and generally bitch about it. after all you dont go
to a rave to WORK your records. Agreed records are tools to move people,
but the folks who PLAY thier records are ussually a lot more busy than
those who treat it as work. After all most people would agree WORK SUCKS,
I'd rather spend my time PLAYING anyway. 



    well on that playful note  Im off to work my ass off on the dance
floor tonite to Tracy at 1015 Folsum

      after all ...thats my job   





   lotsa love to all      GROOVE ON

Does anyone know of particular DJ's who tend to play faster stuff, like 140+ 
bpm, like Prodigy, or fast/hard/trance, like Harthouse?

I kinda get bored of slower stuff after a while, but I like both.  I need 
a mix, I guess.

business isn't necessarily bad. If it gives good value for money 
then you should patronize. If not --walk. 

Give me Wicked/F&F for even $20 versus a Cool World for free or a Sound Factory for
free.. and you know which one Ill choose.. :) I know which one is good value.

As far as this "scene" being a money maker for too many people..
I really don't know the answer to that. I don't know enuf about this "scene".
But when I see all those dj's out
there nite after nite.. they don't seem too rich to me... some of 'em seem
downright fuckin poor! I WISH some of them would get rich...they deserve it,
as far as I'm concerned. 
But.. I would bet that v few if any people have gotten rich off ravin.
As a matter of fact I would care to bet that v few even make a good living
off it. Mores the pity as far as I'm concerned.

Niels rants for no particular reason...

Yes, it's a racket. Go beyond the whole permit thing and look at the
places where the big bucks are being spent, and it's clear that  both
sides have much to profit from. Take the War on Drugs. The drug dealers
love it because it allows them to maintain high prices, pocket huge
profits, and make lots of money simply because they are operating
outside of the law. The cops love it too -- they get direct kickbacks
from seized drug property (houses, cars, boats, planes), they get paid
a lot of money because they are dealing with danger, they occasionally
get to steal drug-dealer money and supplies before it gets impounded as
evidence. It keeps lawyers, DA's, judges, prison guards, prison food
suppliers and prison construction companies well funded. A classic
"racket" -- both sides got the edge. And those of us on the outside are
the ones that lose....

Nobody wants to rethink "the system" because the system, good or bad,
is keeping a lot of people employed and fed. And that's ultimately what
people want and vote for. Any rational talk about legalization or
controlled distribution gets drowned out because $$$ rule over
rationality. We are addicted to this "war" because our addiction keeps
both sides armed and dangerous, powerful, and employed. Including
politicians and their "take back the streets" hype.

However, we need to separate the "system" from the "individuals". It
might be easy for some of us college educated folks to diss a cop
because they are working that job, as opposed to a more "politically
correct" job. But perhaps they didn't have the opportiunities we had
that allow us to vote with our feet and choose a less controversial
career path? Perhaps they need to put food on the table for their
family and children, and who are we to judge the compromises they have
to make in order to get by? (Yes, you can go too far with this line of
"just following orders" "just doing my job" and "not my responsibility"
thinking, but hopefully you get the point)....

Yes there are bad cops and good cops, just like there are bad and good
people. And just like any other *person* a cop wants some respect, and
wants to be judged by their merits, and not by the clothes, uniform,
and job that they're doing. Give them a little respect and they may
treat you with respect. Give them attitude, and they will fuck with you
because they can (yes, this isn't good, but it's just the way things
are -- and it's not just cops that'll act this way -- anybody in a
position of power will use it sometimes). But give a person a chance to
use their position of power for "good" and they may very well surprise
you. A lot of people, unless they're really fucked up, prefer good over
bad, prefer helping over hurting. Even cops.

I recently had a reason to call the cops on someone who has been making
threats to my person and property. I just wanted a report on the logs
in case anything happened. So I invited them into my house, gave them
some soda,  told them about my problems, and had them give me some
advice on my rights in such situations while they were filing their
report. They were very friendly and helpful. Of course, these weren't
downtown SF cops, they're from the Ingleside Station, and perhaps they
don't have to deal w/ the kind of scumbags that downtown SF cops have
to deal with (SOMA drunk drivers, partying drunk/drugged fratboys,
people fighting, thieves, panhandlers, hustlers, and gangsters acting
out petty turf battles, etc). And of course, I had called them, they
hadn't come to me looking for trouble... nonetheless, I have a much
better view of some cops now than I did before my encounter.

While they were in my apartment, these cops also saw all my music
equipment and wanted to check out some of the stuff I was doing --
turned out both of the cops were musicians and were totally into music.
They saw my massive stereo setup, and they were looking at my CD
collection going  "cool" "yeah" and oohing and ahhing over my reggae
collection, but they weren't into techno at all.... Finally, they hit
my P-funk collection and wanted to hear what it sounded like on my
speakers ... Pretty soon I had these two cops w/ their guns and belts
and radios flapping around bopping around my apartment listening to
"Flashlight..." and "Up for the down stroke" with da boomin bass...
they were telling me all about the good old days when they were younger
and partying to all of George Clinton's hits ...

So I spent about 1/2 an hour just chatting with these guys about music
and whatever after they were done w/ business... It was kinda fun cuz
normally i never get a chance to just "hang" with cops and talk to them
AS PEOPLE. I know that if I ever have any reason to be on their wrong
side (like getting pulled over by them) I'll recognize them, they'll
recognize me and hopefully give me some respect!

So like I said, cops are people too. Get rid of the "us vs them"
thinking and maybe we can all get along, even if we don't agree w/ some
of the laws they're enforcing. Just give 'em a little respect, don't
get in their face too hard, and don't give them attitude just because
they're doing what they're doing.... remember that they are working a
stressful, dangerous job and are probably more on edge than most of us.

PS: For the most part, I'll give more props to a cop walking a street
beat than some scumbag investment banker or stockbroker or lawyer
trying to sell the american public down the river so they can buy
another BMW and whatever else it is they need to fullfill their yuppie
dreams. But then again, I typically side with people that work for a
living rather than parasites (aka "upper management", financial types,
etc).

Dear sfraves;

	Just for the record; I don't have any hard feeling to all the 
comments I got back with regard to the DJ's vs Music thread. As I've said 
I don't mind critisum; I do mind the characater assination stuff; I just 
don't feel that it helps in someone tring to make or get his or her point 
across. It just closes the channels that are open; and most of the time; 
puts people backs up against a wall so even if they know their wrong in 
their hearts and minds they won't admitt it. I used to do this myself and 
found out by people telling me that it just didn't work; and that 
sometimes you just can't make the other party see your way. But when you 
use characater assination it just makes things worst. How many times have 
you gotten into a debate over something called the other party names  and 
stuff and had them say; oh your absolutely right I agree with you 
totally; its never happened to me; the oppsite usually happens.. I just 
don't feel it helps; I am much more interested in how something I said 
makes you feel. Like if I said something like I think there not enough 
emphaisi placed on the music and to much on the DJ's. And you responded 
to me by saying well Brian thats makes me very angry to hear that and 
this is why. Isn't that what your tring to communicate to me in the first 
place. Some of you did do that; and I want to make it clear that peoples 
feeling are very important to me; that I always have time to hear them, 
and I also understand that its riskey to do that. This is why I try and 
make it safe; I hope that I will never invalidate someone elses feelings; 
but being human myself I image I have and will on a rair occasion. But if 
we talk about it I sure than we can resolve it. Even if we don't agree; 
I'm still interested in how something I said makes you feel; and I 
promise I won't minize it. So please leave the character stuff out of it; 
I think were all worth wild; loving, capable intelligent people; who all 
have something important and meaningful  to say. Because I do and your no 
different than me. I really mean it when I say  the message is love; I 
have a smile and a kind word for everyone I meet most of the time. So 
like Amy said please be kind to one another; there are so many forces out 
there tring to tear us apart lets not be part of that; I remeber a song 
my Depeche Mode Flies on the Wind Screen. We have so little time compared 
to the big picture here on this planet; and are constantly reminded about 
death; lets try and live and love each day like its our last. I have no 
time to hate!!!!!

... stop wasting time let's do it today.

My humble first post from here in the Northwest.

1) People are people, no matter how old. We all have different things to
learn from the world and each other at different points in our lives. One
of the reasons I enjoy raves is that (at least here in Vangroovy) they are
the only all ages events happening. That means I can freely meet and
interact with a wider range of people.

2) Music makers vs. DJs? Huh? I thought the basis of _house_ music was that
the DJ was the music maker. Bring in some rekkids, your drum machine, a
sampler, a synth. You spin the beats & samples & riffs right into your set.
With vinyl your a DJ, without vinyl your a musician... humm, where's the
line? ...and as for DJ worship, the only reason I like to spin is because I
love the music and I can dance behind the tables as well as in front
(though, maybe not so vigourously).

Big rain-drenched hugs,
lar

Don't know about the djs in SF (I'm waaaay up in Vancouver B.C.) but 
here, one dj in particular comes to mind: Markem, formerly from LA.  He 
has three regular nights in local spots, plus any parties he plays on 
weekends, and he's still one of the nicest people I've met and remains 
very positive about his music and playing it.  He feeds off the energy of 
the crowd and you can just tell that he loves it, and loves playing a 
part in the creation of it.  I don't think playing/loving the music and 
being paid are mutually exclusive.  But, you do, and I can respect that.  
It seems we just have different beliefs and I'm happy with that - I don't 
intend to scream from a soapbox in order to try to change your mind...

let's go for a scotch in "the triangle".

Most of my friends think I'm starting to lose it but, hell,
I like some of those yuppie wall street folks!  There are beautiful 
people all around us ...

I took an (SF) police officer friend to the Pacific New Year's party.
He promised he wouldn't arrest me unless he was on duty :^)  
Yes, he had a blast!

Dear Sfraves;

	Well with a review I'm supoosed to be objective right; ok. First 
I would like to say that personnally I had and Ok time last night. The 
music was heavy trance very trance or trance trance trance; thats why I 
say For Sure, the visiuals I thought by far where the best I've seen that 
were obviously theme based; good produuction. Everything else seemed 
great.

	But my personal view is; its was my first time at Cearsars Latin 
Plalace and it jsut had to weirdest feel to me; I felt like outsider 
renting some land in a forgien hositile country. I have a bunch of 
liberal bummer stickers on my car ProChoice; Kill your television; Fight 
Aids not People with Aids ..etc maybe you have seem me a White Jeep 
Cherokee. Anyway I was putting my things in my car; and these three guys 
in the parking lot were throwing beer cans in my direction; it 5:30am i'm 
a lone ;yaeh right guys I'm going to start a fight with the 3 of you; 
dream on; get in my car and leave unmolested. 

	I thing the guys at Ravers did a fanstastic job for there first 
show; but I wouldn't go back to Cearser unless it was the only thing 
going.
	I rememeber back in those Punk days of mine; we rented a Elks 
Club in this neighborhood in Kensigten, Phila, PA; a very blue collor 
working class neighborhoor as are most in good old Phila. Well during the 
show a bunch of guys from the neighborhood came in and started clubing 
people and throwing M80's with bee bee clued to the outside of them into 
the crowd; it was really bad; and the cops didn;t do a thing.

	I would never what to see something like that happen here 
althought with the amount of hatred, and iggnorence on the streets 
Cearsers would have been a perfect place. But in there defense there 
security seemed pretty tight and organized; my car which was out in their 
parking lot with all my massage stuff in it; was undidtrubed; so I gave 
the parking lot attendent a fiver.

	All and all I thought it was a good party; I just didn't like the 
venue; it just had a weird feel to it. I asked a lot of people; they said 
the same thing. Good job guys(Ravers People); maybe a different venue 
next time, I'll definately go; if its not Cearsers.

Dear Neil;

	Yes; I'm inpartial agreement with you especially about the stuff 
lawyers bankers etc.. I know a lot more criminals who wear a tie, and a 
tan trench coat than I do others. Unfortuately these people raley get 
caught; and even if they get over on the system; instead of being veiwed 
as a crook; they are viewed as wyle bussinessmen. Go fiqure; and they 
never realy do any time, and if they do; its in prisions like Allenwood, 
Penn, in Allenton, PA; which  means you go home on the weekends; they 
have acessto a golf course ...etc. THis is the prison where a lot of the 
Watergate people went to ; and other crooked policaitians and bussiness 
men/womyn that get caught. I thing they should stick them all in some of 
the Federal Penns in states like New Mexico. Just my 2 cents worth

Dear sfravers;

	Plase make sure you forward this information; anthing about S314 
to your providers. I  found my provider here at Liberty weren't even 
aware of S314. So make sure you mentioned to you sysadmin people do you 
know about S314 and what are you doing about it. These are the people who 
also need to make their voices heard and heard loud. I just don't know 
what I would do with out by feed. I've met so many people since I moved 
here though this medium. If it wasn't here I wouldn't know any of you and 
you would know me; and I think that would suck. So I have as with all the 
stuff forwarded to my providers; don't be so sure that there aware of it; 
I'm also placing pressure on the them to get the message out to all the 
subscribers; the more people complaining the better. Lets shut him down 
Senator Exon.

we think ravers in wonderland was  pretty cool.  in spite of a slow start 
with the live stuff (too choppy) we came away from it feeling... well... 
awesome.  maybe it had something to do with beautiful fucking carlos and 
his jesus good tunes.  have you-all ever heard someone scratch like 
that?  he played those decks like an instrument.  thanks, carlos, if 
you're out there.  Hi to all the beautiful people we met ... hope to see 
you all again soon.

  Apologies -- I was going to send a reply to another group, realized I 
had selected Peter's post to reply to, then dorked out by hitting 
control-x instead of control-c.  :<(   
  Apologies.
  But, just so you'll get something out of this besides an explanation of 
my folly --

mind of the expert there are few."

2) "Without hope we live in desire."

  If you/we can dance/rave with those thoughts cycling through in synch 
with the music, I am redeemed.   :<)

Don't know, but there an Atomic in the N. Parking lot at the Oakland

get in two parties, not bad for a Sunday. :-)

I called the Organic line and they had no mention of a free party today
on Sunday.  I had heard a rumor a few days back that mentioned a
possibly Wicked/Organic in the Park but I guess it's not true.  Organic
will be having a 2nd anniversary on March 11th.

-----

I went to the Out-A-Sight on Friday.  Mike and I made our trek to the
map point.  A quiet cafe with a short line.  A muddled Fisher Price
stereo rumbling as people were hanging out eating chips, smoking,
talking.  The directions weren't wrong, but we got lost anyway.  It was
right off of Mission.. near MOMA.  A map point near the party.  Thank
you folks!

A straight forward security, no problems.  A quick frisk and a metal
detector to check for weapons.  They should do these type of checks more
often.  They had a few rooms: two dance rooms, one small hallway
connecting the main dance room to the bar/chillout room.  To get to the main
room one had to climb up the stairs.

The sound in both rooms were too loud.  It was the first time I had to
wear ear plugs.  Kleenex this time, but I'll have to look at Larry's
tips for ear plugs because the highs were drowned out.  The bass in the
main room could have been a little stronger.

Since the music was too loud upstairs, I headed down to the bottom room.
Markie (?) was spinning some trip-hop, funk, a big mix of non-4/4 beats.
He also played Josh Wink's Acid Break part one.  I didn't stay for long;
it had a weird vibe.  Maybe its because I'm used to boom boom boom boom
rather than boom chik dum dum dak.

Went back up the main room.  Caught the end of Garth's (?) set and Spun
got on.  Don't what to say Spun.. didn't really pay attention.  THEN,
Robbie Hardkiss came on!  Wow!  There were times on the dance floor I
just stopped to look at him just groovin to the music, fixing the
beats, smoking his cigarette.. Does he usually use more than 2
turntables?  Beautiful layering... took the energy up and down,
sideways, diagonal.. what a mind workout.  It was interesting to hear a
lot of breaks, but they were not predictable. Its my first time hearing
him, but if this is usual, go dance to his music!

I for some reason danced sometimes to the background sounds.. the space
free flowing 'ambient' sounds going from here to nowhere.  Sort of like
doing Tai Chi to trippy dance music.


The visuals were not very good.  Pictures of the space, flowers,
silohuettes of naked woman, fractals, various odd pictures.  The SAME
ones all through the night.  At some points I wish they could have had
it turned off or had gone into some sort of interesting theme of
pictures. The visuals were projected right above the DJ.  I would have
liked to see the people dancing behind me, but the visual lights kept
getting in the way.

Two bathrooms; one in main room, on the bottom room.  (Do people ever
review bathrooms?)  The bottom room was dark but I felt bad for the DJs
because ever once in a while the bathroom lights would just flood the
room.  Maybe the promoters could use a red bulb instead of white.  Also,
the bottom room had a small down ramp that people did not see and saw
lots of people mis-stepping, losing their balance.  Bad accidents could
have happened there.

I thoroughly enjoyed myself.. and my wallet said to me the morning after
"You should let out sometimes, I don't like having to smell your hot
sweat all night!"  For $8 a very fun party.  Better than the Palladium
or City Nights.. ;)

Overall I had a good time at spread love, but as far as an objective 
rating for a rave, I say it was just ok.  The party was held at the old 
oasis, is not such a bad space.  I never did understand why more party's 
haven't been held there.  I like the access to the roof, which provided a 
nice place to chill and get some fresh air.  Unfortunately they closed it 
off not long after I got there about 2am. 
Some of the people working there seemed a little obsessive compulsive 
with their cleaning.  First they insisted on taking my water bottle at 
2am.  At least they provided cups after that, But I had to use about 5 
cups.  Everytime I left my cup, and it had water in it each time, I found 
it missing.  Even when I stood near it, I had to keep the clean up guy 
from taking it.
There weren't that many people there, and it seemed to take some time 
before people got into it.  Didn't care to much for charlete's set.  I'm 
not that good with recognizing dj's so excuse me if I make a mistake.  
She just about emptied the dance floor by the end of her set.  I'm not 
sure who came on next, but I thouroughly enjoyed that set.  
Unfortunatedly it ended about 4am when they closed the place.  Pretty 
early for a saturday night or any night.
Could have been better with more people and longer party.  Give me some 
good music and a dance floor and I'll usually have a good time.

Hello,

Two points.  One, it is not legislation that is needed to protect free
speech right, but rather for an electronic free speech case to come
before the Supreme Court.
Two, as I posted a few months ago, Newt is in favor of more freedom and
less government intrusion into the electronic networks, so this is
unlikely to pass the House.  (for more information, check out the
position paper at the WWW page at pff.org ).

Hello,

I think there is simply a small misunderstanding here on the part of
Brian D.  Let's see if I can explain it clearly...

In the old system, artists played music on stage and they also recorded
music which we listened to at home. In the late 70's, dance clubs became
popular where DJ's spun vinyl, matching beats to make a seamless groove.
Previously, dance clubs usually had live bands.

Then, in the 80's, house music was created where DJ's began to *create*
music by mixing together different elements.  In this music, the DJ's
*were* the artists.  Those who recorded the vinyl were *also* artists,
but that their art was *for* the DJ's, who were the ones who appreciated
it.

Then, some of the musicians who made especially popular vinyl that was
coveted by DJs (and had dancers asking the DJs - "what was that you just
spun") reverted back to the old system and began making LPs to sell to
people to listen to at home (eg 2 unlimited).

Thus, many of the most popular musicians who make vinyl for DJs now
*also* make LPs for people to listen to at home.

However, that is really two entirely different things.

The last time I was in the Bay Area, back in August, one of the
soul/dance FM stations had (on Friday at 4 PM) 4 DJs spinning on 8
turntables, a mixture of hip-hop and some house.  There was no way you
could identify any particular vinyl that was spun, but the result was
actually pretty good (unfortunately 99% of the time that station just
has top 40 pap).  The point is that what they created was *different*
from the vinyl they used to create it with.

So, since this seemed to provoke so much anger, instead I propose
that people respond postitively and post the DJ's and titles of their
favorite DJ tape(s)!

respect to all,

Ken

I was told (on thursday) that there'd be something going on at the
bandshell on saturday -- went to check it out and saw nothing.  But
perhaps people that told me were confused as to the date, so maybe it
is happening on sunday.

PS: I was explicitly told not to post the info (probably a good thing
as it was the wrong info in the first place)... whatever...

I'd say "ok" was generous.  The Oasis is the center point of San Francisco's
Little Tijuana District.  It was thankfully a cheap party - one that didn't
come together very well.  If anyone cares, the pacific connection was a loose
one.  Senor Love Daddy threw it.  

I was invited to a party (new nightclub) on Minna street that Saturday.  This
was a very nicely done acid jazz affair with dj's, a band in a great intimate
setting, and a kitchen for afterhours cooking ...  I don't really know if
this is has happened before or will happen again.  There is a jazzid up
connection (mushroom jazz).

There's gotta be something about taking a weekly to the weekend or a weekend
to the week that helps a party happen.  I suppose this is the thinking behind
map points and such.

hang in there,
Dave

O.K.  Kids can be a pain in the ass and they do do crazy and irresponsible
things, but so do adults.  Laws do suck, but some were meant to be broken.
 To Brian Darkness, maybe you aren't aware of the ages of many people signed
on to sfraves, but quite a few of them are "kids" who I think could be
trusted.  "Kids" can be some of the nicest and most open people I know.  I
figures that raving ws about peace, love, unity, respect, etc.  But you know
what most of the posts on this mailing list have shown me?  That it's not.
 Eveyone is alwasy bitching at each other and so on, and it seems pretty
pathetic.  We should all try to be a little nicer to each other.

Dear Zack;

	I accept your appolloy and am impressed; most people have trouble
saying the words I'm sorry; I don't know if when I was your age; I would
have had the wisdom to do the same thing. Thanks. and yes if someone would
read this mail other than yourself and find something in the content to be
inappropreiate I could conceivablly either be sued, or jail. In the letter
that I sent to the elf queen; there just two many lawyers out there
itching to sue someone for somethink; look at that Mcdonnalds case that
Howard Stern talks about so much; where a little old lady while going
though the Mcdoonals drivethur spilled the hot coffee in her lap that she
had just purchased form them; and sued them and won something like
$1,000,000. With reference to mi nors the judges are even more leaient to
the claiment(the person sueing)

	I'm a health care profession Zack and I do really care about 
people; I became an engineer in hopes of changing the world in a positive 
way. I as engineer was never in charge of the important decsions and if I 
reached a point inthe company that I was making those decisons I wouldn't 
be doing the engineering(design) that I loved so much. But I found out 
that if I can change myself for the better; and if I help just one person 
in a positive way; than I can feel really good about that. The world is 
abig task to take on, and to change the world you must do it one person 
at a time. 

	I would like to appolloize for my sarcasstic remarks in the first 
letter I was just tring to me funny; sorry if you took them the wrong 
way; I quess I just didn't understand how frustrated you and your friends 
are about this whole issue. Well anyway Zack have a goodnight and 
pleasent raver dreams......:)

Dear Elfqueen;

	I agree; its ashame that the laws designed to protect kids; 
usually end up inhibiting them to. Its a real trade off Protection vs 
Freedom when your under 18. The benefits are your not responsible, the 
negative side is that no one trusts someone who can't be held responsible 
or accountable for their actions. Most adults wish they were children 
again; and most kids wish they were adults; go fiqure the grass is always 
greener on the other side. Personnally I like my freedom and my childhood 
was filled with nothing but horrific pain; it isn't till know that I've 
found some peace in all that and am reliving my childhood the way in 
should have been. I would trust a kid at a rave in a second because I've 
seem all ages shows work for everyone.

	Unfortuately will the number of lawyer on the street willing to 
file litagation over anything it makes it hard unless you have a lot of 
money to take the risk and throw and all ages show. 70% of the worlds 
lawyers live and ppractice in the US, I thing there a problem here; when 
you go to other countries law suits are not uncommon but no were near the 
epicdemua they are here in the US. If there is to me blame placed it 
should be placed there; everyone scared of getting sued; and no one whats 
to take the risk. 

	It really sucks; unfortuately when your a kid; most I think are 
pretty milatint about there rights; and want to do a lot about them. But 
once they reach 18; there no more need to do that; and it jsut keeps 
getting passed back to the next generoation to deal with; and 
unfortuately never does. You have my sypathy; even though I'm sure that 
not what you want. 

	I will say however that even with all the laws they did nothing 
to protect me as a child; all the bad stuff that happened to me still did.

NOT TRUE. dj's don't just "play the muzik".  At least good dj's don't.  
there's so much more to being a good dj than beatmatching.  a dj works 
the crowd and brings the vibe to people around.  a shitty dj can play a 
few good tunes and make people dance, but it takes a good dj to really 
send people into the groove and get the muzik flowing right.

>  I think people put to much emphazies on

acshully if you talk to any dj, they will put *a lot* of emphasis on who 
makes the muzik.  true, it's really unfortunate that most party attenders 
never bother finding out about the creators, but most dj's and others who 
buy muzik do.  Also, people like Josh Wink aren't just famous for their 
awesome dj'ing skills.  Winks also puts out some of the freshest records 
around and is really respected for his muzik. also many sf dj's such as 
harkiss, spun, doran, and tony make muzik too.

> requested to be paided to spin there. I don't like it when I hear about

look at it from the dj's point of view.  what's he supposed to do.  
starve??  Also, speaking of 'for the benefit of all'  there are *lots* of 
dj's out there who are willing to spin for *free* if it's a free 
non-profit party.  so dj's out there do have plenty of love for the 
scene.  but if a person who puts together a party gets paid, the dj's 
should definitely get a piece of the action.

I think that it might not be out yet, but at Organic (the one with 
hardkiss about amonth back) they were giving delusions og grandeur tapes 
out for free.

Dear Sfraves;

	I recently got into a debate witha friend over the pro & cons of 
PC vs Unix Based BBS's. I like the Unix operating system a lot; and am 
even thing about creating a LINUX partion on one of my harddrives. But I 
not aware of many applications avilable that I would use for it.

	Anyway I use a Galacticomm Board(Liberty) and am very familar 
with the interface; it offers a lot of things I haven't been able to find 
on Unix based boards. I would just like to hear some other peoples 
thoughts on this topic; thanks; oh without starting a major thread; just 
put them to me in private unless you feel its worth posting in the 
general mailbox.

Couple of good ones I picked up in London last week are 
Techno Nations 3, (Kickin Records, KICK CD 14) and 
Ambient Auras (Diverse Dimensions in Ambient Dub) (Rumour Records, CDRAID 519)

I also picked up Trance Atlantic from Volume which isn't too bad (Volume, TACD1)
double cd, and you get the usual 200 page book of pretty pictures.

Hi folks

This is the text of a leaflet handed out at an Anti-Criminal
Justice Act demo in Edinburgh, Scotland. The CJA is a piece
of nasty class based legalisation being used to increase
social atomisation and protect private property against those
who could use it (eg squatters) or those protesting injustice
(eg Hunt sabs or strikers).

Iain


Fight The Power!
Party Hard!


The Criminal Justice Act is bad news. That's clear. The government 
wants to make the rest of society as 
boring as they are! It attacks our freedom to 
party and protest. There's only one thing left for us to do. Kill 
this act by partying and protesting! Its up 
to us, no one else will do it for us.

While claiming the C.J.A. is to protect us, its 
clear that all it does is protect rich landowners, bosses and the 
state against the few "civil liberties" remaining for 
us. Most of the Act is concerned with criminalising all 
direct action and unauthorised demonstrations, particularly 
against pickets, hunt sabs and road protesters -
even hillwalkers. Its main aim is to give the police 
even more power - the right to stop and search anyone, 
an end to the right of silence, the introduction 
of plea bargaining, exclusion zones, "aggravated trespass" 
and paranoid "anti-terrorist" laws. The only 
freedom it protects is the freedom of power to do 
exactly what it wants....

We must recognise the C.J.A. for what it is, a piece 
of class based legislation for and by the rich and 
powerful. It was never just about targeting squatters, 
hunts sabs and ravers. It's a direct attack on all 
working class people. Liberal protest ain't going 
to work. Only direct action gets the goods. Why 
else is the C.J.A. trying to ban it?

Remember this is just the latest in a long series 
of attacks on our class. We need to link up all our 
struggles and fight to win. By fighting isolated 
struggles we can be picked off one by one. But by 
uniting together we can win. Just look at the Poll Tax. 

Our fight so far has some great features in it. Unofficial 
mass demos where we took over the streets and 
made them ours. D.I.Y. gigs, raves and parties which 
have raised lots of money and awareness for the fight 
as well as providing many a good night. Excellent 
pickets and solidarity marches. Over the country a 
network of mutual aid and support is spreading, a 
network of angry people who know how to party! 

We must organise and make all this stronger. By 
doing this we can make this act unworkable. By mass 
defiance, direct action  and solidarity we can win. 
So let's party and protest. We don't need boring speeches 
to tell us what's wrong or what to do. Its OUR 
lives, OUR liberties. We need to organise ourselves 
to take the power back. No one else is going to do it. 
No one else can. The only parties we need are the ones with 
loud music. The ones we organise ourselves. The ones 
that play OUR tunes. 

Let us experience the freedom of protest and party hard 
until the C.J.A. lies along side the Poll Tax in the 
dustbin of history.

the dead were here (in slc) early last week and the usual festivities went on.
Along with that on monday and tuesday nights some of our local dj's went
down to the parking lot and played some music. They played a lot of disco
and a lot of rave music. The groovy thing was that everyone, and i do mean
everyone, got involved and started dancing. There were a bunch of school
busses around with dancing deadheads on them. Overall it was a really
groovy thing. once again a positive example of how groove and rhythm (which
are fundamental) united everyone.

i would have to say the FUSION 2 is one of the best cd's of the year.
another would have to be SAVE THE LAST TRANCE FOR ME. I love this cd (with
the exception of love and contradiction) but arachnophobia makes up for it.
Another favorite would have to be the cd I bought in germany that has a
groovy remix of The Ultimate Seduction.
        Perhaps these are too basic but I dig em.

        thanks
        f-amous
        p.s. is that laughing song out on tape or cd and if so what is the
title of it so that I can order it, also is it true that the new strictly
rhythm has josh wink mixing (and includes the laughing song)...any help
would be appreciated.
        thanks again in advance-

okay. although my tastes currently range outside what you mentioned i'll 
try my best...

1. Psychotrance 2 (moonshine records): This is labeled 'hardtrance' on 
the liner notes but i'd just say nice trance with good beats. it's 
basically a mixtape done by Darren Emerson (of Underworld, a brilliant 
musician and DJ) and it's got some AWESOME tracks on it, including 
'Liquid Summer' by the ubiquitous Josh Wink and 'Anthem' by TWorld, on 
Emerson's Underwater label. This rocks.

2. Underworld - Dubnobasswithmyheadman (tvt/waxtrax): Darren Emerson's 
band, a techno/house/rock tour de force. Brilliant.

3. DJ Culture : In the mix with Sasha and Dave Seaman (moonshine): 
Another mixtape deal...This album is disguised as a compilation of 
records on the Stress label, and i think is a good introduction to what 
dj's do...sasha (one of the best dj's int he world) takes 10 or 12 
records and give you an instant party - he and seaman use some of the 
same records (read the liner notes and you'll notice that some the 
records were *made* by sasha and seaman) and sasha's half *KICKS* - i've 
been known to groove hard in the car many a time with this. It's more a 
showcase for sasha (and seaman's) dj talents (programming, mixing...) 
than the music itself...but the music kicks - and it comes with a full 
tracklisting.

4. My Terry Mullan mixtape, which ill be glad to make copies of: Terry 
Mullan is a DJ from Chicago/St.Louis and is massive in the midwest and 
east. And rightly so - he fucking rocks. This tape is how house music 
should be done, with a mix of funky SF-style house, brit trance-house and 
hardbag (handbag/hardhouse mixed. :) Tape includes 'Bells of NY' by Slo 
Moshun (a *true* classic, the miles better 'xen mantra mix' is on here), 
'trapped in my handbag' (or something like that) by someone whose name 
eludes me but is a stormin track and even mo'...contact me for a copy 
(though i won't be able to get on them til next week)

5. Dance Hits UK(moonshine): why does moonshine always have extremely 
crap titles for their otherwise decent compilations? argh. Anyway, this 
comp is mixed by 'tall' Paul Newman, a UK dj famous for the Brighton Zap! 
club in England..mixes a very nice concoction of 
hardhouse/handbag/techno...includes Slam's ' Positive Education' (and if 
you havne't heard this yet your live is incomplete...:) and 'Pilgrimage 
to Paradise' by Sourmash (a tearin' acid hit from last year)...i think 
the beginning is a little boring but the middle and end more than make up 
for it.

6.the Trip Hop Test (moonshine): This comp is a mix of laidback, slow 
grooves and house stompers like 'My Mercury Mouth' by the Dust Brothers 
and 'Tales From The Woodshed' by Brainclag. The best thing i've seen from 
moonshine thus far - brilliant

7.The Serious Road Trip: I've tried to only recommend domestic cd's, but 
this is an exception. You can probably find this at most import shops 
(like Mod Lang or Streetlight) for between $20 and $30. IT's worth it. 
It's a Bosnian charity album which features the best in dance music - 
lionrock, the orb, the dust brothers...tons more - it's *three* cd's, 
with the third cd being Orbital performing "Impact" live from the 
glastonbury festival summer 1994. It's definitey moving to hear 70,000 
people go off to a cool techno band. :D

I think that's all i can remember now...i'm not looking at my cd 
collection....if i find more recommendations then i'll let ya know....

I bought a comp recently that contains 'tales from the woodshed' by 
Brainclag. I distinctly remember this being dropped at Friends and FAmily 
5 and how massively it rocked the house - does anyone remember who 
dropped this track?

i'd like to add my compliments to the cast and crew who put on the Atomic
Pig...it was an extra special production this time, and a marvellous
celebration of the Year of the Pig (i was also born in a year of the pig,
so this was a great birthday party for me).

I would like to humbly bow out of any compliments for bringing music or
adding to the production...i was a mere spectator and dancer at this
event...please direct your regards to the rest of the crew, mentioned
above for bringing together another special event for us all.  They put
on another spectacular event, in a series of spectacular events!  Way
to go!

I was just reading a copy of XLR8R from a couple months ago, and there was
an article on mix tapes by Allen Jebian.  In the article, he mentions a
mix tape he has from Richie Hawtin (and debates about tracks by Vapour Space)

I just wanted to verify that Richie Hawtin has NO authorized mix tapes.
Any you may see are either bootlegs or lies.

I'm having my knee re-reconstructed, so I'm unsubbing from sfraves for a 
while, as I will be out of it for at least a week or so...(I'm being 
fixed on Thursday (hopefully))...and don't know when I'll be able to go 
out again (I'll be on crutches a while)...


Have fun for me and send some vibes my way...

 I warned Bryce that he was going to wear out his smile if he was going 
to use it so much! I was in danger of fatiguing mine as well...

 I was late getting to the Oakland Coliseum , and therefore I was unable 
to park next to the Atomic Pig site - I ended up on the other side of
the complex. When I finally found the Atomic Pig setup , M was playing
a comedy/jive recording of Lord Buckley - very obscure , but strangely
appropriate for the evening's events , as the Lord Buckley cut was about
a wild party that was putting out music so wild even the snakes came
in to dance! 

 Some folks had brought colored chalk , and began to draw pretty pictures
on the asphalt. Sean began to set up his black light and laser - another
bunch of guys (ID ?) were setting up a bar of lights in the far back
of the dance area.

 I went off on an unsuccessful buying trip through the parking lot - just
not the right "vibe" from the sellers , and then I realized I forgot my
wallet in the truck! Speed-walked back to the truck - luckily my wallet
had fallen inside, not outside . By then I decided that the "powers that
be" were trying to tell me "Don't Buy Any Shit TODAY!", so I decided to 
listen to them and headed back to Atomic Pig.

 By this time , Fred Heutte was spinning jungle dub tune ( sounded way
cool, and nice to dance to! Omni Trio , I think). The rest of the
eveing I spent dancing , chatting with folks , resting , and cruising 
the parking lot. Lotsa good vibes & smiles & tranced dancing all around!
I didn't hear everything M put on , but the sets by Fred, Gil , Galen ,
and Ethan were great!

 Misc. stuff:
1. The grandfather guy: Did anybody notice the late-fiftyish whitehaired
   guy who was hanging out behind the generator? I never did get to talk
   to him - it seemed that he was watching the crowd , and he disappeared
   when Atomic Pig wrapped up at 10PM.
2. The other GD parking lot parties: Some folks told me that there had 
   two other parties , one each Friday and Saturday , in the Coliseum
   parking lot . Who put these on , and did these have anything to do 
   with Atomic Pig having to shut down early?
3. The strategic importance of the Grateful Dead : I can't imagine doing
   this in the parking lot of a heavy metal concert ! There seems to
   be more tolerance at the GD shows. As I was walking the aisles , I came
   across two different living-room speaker setups , one playing Pink
   Floyd , and the other playing speed metal. And then there are the 
   punk rockers too.

                That's it for now -  Larry Ching / larryc@netcom.com

ALERT: S314 Online "Decency Act" Threatens All Online Providers
---------------------------------------------------------------
Feb. 10, 1995

EFF is working with the Electronic Messaging Association and
others to  oppose the Exon bill, S314, the Communications
Decency Act of 1995. We believe policy makers should take into
account the ability of those using the net to avoid materials
they find offensive. There will likely be increased use of
labels and headers to help people avoid unwanted materials and
guide their childrens' use of the net in the future. Meanwhile,
it is  simply a bad idea to make it a crime to "transmit"
offensive material,  especially when the "transmitter" is
passive and not monitoring the  content of "transmission".

This bill would perpetrate the online equivalent of making
anyone who  builds a street liable for the fact that you can go
to the red light  district on it. This bill if passed into law
will gravely chill the free  flow of information online and
inappropriately criminalize sysops and  sysadmins for wrongdoing
over which they have no control.  

It is clear from recent discussions with Sen. Exon and his staff
that the  sponsors of the bill were apparently unaware that the
bill, as written,  criminalizes essentially everyone involved in
networking with the sole  exception of govt.-decreed common
carriers like telephone companies. The possibility of a re-write
was being considered as of Feb. 8.

*** PROTECT THE INTERNET!  READ THIS MESSAGE ***

This document is an electronic Petition Statement to the U.S. Congress 
regarding pending legislation, the"Communications Decency Act of 1995" (S. 
314) which willhave, if passed, very serious negative ramifications 
forfreedom of expression on Usenet, the Internet, and all electronic 
networks.  The proposed legislation would remove guarantees of privacy and 
free speech on all electronicnetworks, including the Internet, and may even 
effectivelyclose them down as a medium to exchange ideas and information.

For an excellent analysis of this Bill by the Center for Democracy and 
Technology (CDT), refer to the Appendixattached at the end of this 
document.  The text to S. 314 is also included in this Appendix.

This document is somewhat long, but the length is necessary to give you 
sufficient information to make an informed decision.  Time is of the 
essence, we are going to turn this petition and the signatures in on 
3/16/95, so if you are going to sign this please do so ASAP or at least 
before midnight Wednesday, March 15, 1995.

Even if you read this petition after the due date, please submit your 
signature anyway as we expect Congress to continue debating these issues in 
the foreseeable future and the more signatures we get, the more influence 
thepetition will have on discussion.  And even if Congress rejects S. 314 
while signatures are being gathered, do submit your signature anyway for the 
same reason.

Please do upload this petition statement as soon as possible to any BBS and 
on-line service in your area. If you have access to one of the major 
national on-lineservices such as CompuServe, Prodigy, AOL, etc., do try to 
upload it there.  We are trying to get at least 5000 signatures.  Even more 
signatures are entirely possible if we each put in a little effort to inform 
others, such as friends and coworkers, about the importance of this petition 
to electronic freedom of expression.

(Appendix) Analysis and text of S. 314 (LONG but excellent)

******(2) The Petition Statement

In united voice, we sign this petition against passage of S. 314
(the "Communications Decency Act of 1995") for these reasons:

S. 314 would prohibit not only individual speech that is 
"obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent", but would prohibit any
provider of telecommunications service from carrying such traffic, under
threat of stiff penalty.  Even aside from the implications for free
speech, this would cause an undue - and unjust - burden upon operators of the
various telecommunications services.  In a time when the citizenry and
their lawmakers alike are calling for and passing "no unfunded
mandates" laws to the benefit of the states, it is unfortunate that Congress
might seek to impose unfunded mandates upon businesses that provide the
framework for the information age.

An additional and important consideration is the technical feasibility of 
requiring the sort of monitoring this bill would necessitate. The financial 
burden in and of itself - in either manpower or technology to handle such 
monitoring (if even legal under the Electronic Communications Privacy Act) - 
would likely cause many smaller providers to go out of business, and most 
larger providers to seriously curtail their services. 

The threat of such penalty alone would result in a chilling effect in the 
telecommunications service community, not only restricting the types of 
speech expressly forbidden by the bill, but creating an environment contrary 
to the Constitutional principles of free speech, press and assembly - 
principles which entities such as the Internet embody as nothing has before.

By comparison, placing the burden for content control upon each
individual user is surprisingly simple in the online and interactive
world, and there is no legitimate reason to shift that burden to providers who
carry that content.  Unlike traditional broadcast media, networked media is
comparatively easy to screen on the user end - giving the reader, viewer,
or participant unparalleled control over his or her own information
environment.  All without impacting or restricting what any other user
wishes to access.  This makes regulation such as that threatened by this
S. 314 simply unnecessary.

In addition, during a period of ever-increasing commercial interest in
arenas such as the Internet, restriction and regulation of content or the
flow of traffic across the various telecommunications services would have
serious negative economic effects.  The sort of regulation proposed by this
bill would slow the explosive growth the Internet has seen, giving the
business community reason to doubt the medium's commercial appeal.

We ask that the Senate halt any further progress of this bill. We ask
that the Senate be an example to Congress as a whole, and to the nation
at large - to promote the general welfare as stated in the Preamble to
the Constitution by protecting the free flow of information and ideas
across all of our telecommunications services.

It must first be noted that this is a petition, not a vote.  By "signing" it 
you agree with *all* the requests made in the petition.  If you do not agree 
with everything in this petition, then your only recourse is to not sign it.

In addition, all e-mail signatures will be submitted to Congress, the 
President of the United States, and the news media.

Including your full name is optional, but *very highly encouraged* as that 
would add to the effectiveness of the petition.  Signing via an anonymous 
remailer is highly discouraged, but not forbidden, as an attempt will be 
made to separately tally signatures from anonymous remailers.

Because this is a Petition to the U.S. Congress, we ask that you state, as 
instructed below, whether or not you are a U.S. citizen.  We do encourage 
non-U.S. citizens to sign, but their signatures will be tallied separately.

Signing this petition is not hard, but to make sure your signature is not 
lost or miscounted, please follow these directions EXACTLY:

1) Prepare an e-mail message.  In the main body (NOT the Subject line) of 
your e-mail include the ONE-LINE statement:

SIGNED <Internet e-mail address> <Full name> <US Citizen>

You need not include the "<" and ">" characters. 'SIGNED'should be 
capitalized.  As stated above, your full name is optional, but highly 
recommended.  If you do supply your name, please don't use a pseudonym or 
nickname, or your first name -- it's better to just leave it blank if 
it'snot your full and real name.  If you are a U.S. citizen, please include 
at the end of the signature line a 'YES',and if you are not, a 'NO'.  All 
signatures will be tallied whether or not you are a U.S. Citizen

CDT POLICY POST 2/9/95

SENATOR EXON INTRODUCES ONLINE INDECENCY LEGISLATION

A.  OVERVIEW

Senators Exon (D-NE) and Senator Gorton (R-WA) have
introduced legislation to expand current FCC regulations
on obscene and indecent audiotext to cover *all* content
carried over all forms of electronic communications
networks.  If enacted, the "Communications Decency Act of
1995" (S. 314) would place substantial criminal liability
on telecommunications service providers (including
telephone networks, commercial online services, the
Internet, and independent BBS's) if their network is used
in the transmission of any indecent, lewd, threatening or
harassing messages.  The legislation is identical to a
proposal offered by Senator Exon last year which failed
along with the Senate Telecommunications reform bill (S.
1822, 103rd Congress, Sections 801 - 804). The text the
proposed statute, with proposed amendment, is appended at
the end of this document.

The bill would compel service providers to chose between
severely restricting the activities of their subscribers
or completely shutting down their email, Internet access,
and conferencing services under the threat of criminal
liability.  Moreover, service providers would be forced to
closely monitor every private communication, electronic
mail message, public forum, mailing list, and file archive
carried by or available on their network, a proposition
which poses a substantial threat to the freedom of speech
and privacy rights of all American citizens.

S. 314, if enacted, would represent a tremendous step
backwards on the path to a free and open National
Information Infrastructure.  The bill raises fundamental
questions about the ability of government to control
content on communications networks, as well as the locus
of liability for content carried in these new
communications media.

To address this threat to the First Amendment in digital
media, CDT is working to organize a broad coalition of
public interest organizations including the ACLU, People
For the American Way, and Media Access Project, along with
representatives from the telecommunications, online
services, and computer industries to oppose S. 314 and to
explore alternative policy solutions that preserve the
free flow of information and freedom of speech in the
online world.  CDT believes that technological
alternatives which allow individual subscribers to control
the content they receive represent a more appropriate
approach to this issue.

B.  SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS OF S. 314

S. 314 would expand current law restricting indecency and
harassment on telephone services to all telecommunications
providers and expand criminal liability to *all* content
carried by *all* forms of telecommunications networks.
The bill would amend Section 223 of the Communications Act
(47 U.S.C. 223), which requires carriers to take steps to
prevent minors from gaining access to indecent audiotext
and criminalizes harassment accomplished over interstate
telephone lines.  This section, commonly known as the
Helms Amendment (having been championed by Senator Jesse
Helms), has been the subject of extended Constitutional
litigation in recent years.

* CARRIERS LIABLE FOR CONDUCT OF ALL USERS ON THEIR
  NETWORKS

S. 314 would make telecommunication carriers (including
telephone companies, commercial online services, the
Internet, and BBS's) liable for every message, file, or
other content carried on its network -- including the
private conversations or messages exchanged between two
consenting individuals.

Under S. 314, anyone who "makes, transmits, or otherwise
makes available any comment, request, suggestion,
proposal, image, or other communication" which is
"obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent" using a
"telecommunications device" would be subject to a fine of
$100,000 or two years in prison (Section (2)(a)).

In order to avoid liability under this provision, carriers
would be forced to pre-screen all messages, files, or
other content before transmitting it to the intended
recipient.  Carriers would also be forced to prevent or
severely restrict their subscribers from communicating
with individuals and accessing content available on other
networks.

Electronic communications networks do not contain discrete
boundaries.  Instead, users of one service can easily
communicate with and access content available on other
networks.  Placing the onus, and criminal liability, on
the carrier as opposed to the originator of the content,
would make the carrier legally responsible not only for
the conduct of its own subscribers, but also for content
generated by subscribers of other services.

This regulatory scheme clearly poses serious threats to
the free flow of information throughout the online world
and the free speech and privacy rights of individual
users.  Forcing carriers to pre-screen content would not
only be impossible due to the sheer volume of messages, it
would also violate current legal protections.

* CARRIERS REQUIRED TO ACT AS PRIVATE CENSOR OF ALL
  PUBLIC FORUMS AND ARCHIVES

S. 314 would also expand current restrictions on access to
indecent telephone audiotext services by minors under the
age of 18 to cover similar content carried by
telecommunications services (such as America Online and
the Internet).  (Sec (a)(4)).

As amended by this provision, anyone who, "by means of
telephone or telecommunications device, makes, transmits,
or otherwise makes available (directly or by recording
device) any indecent communication for commercial purposes
which is available to any person under the age of 18 years
of age or to any other person without that person's
consent, regardless of whether the maker of such
communication placed the call or initiated the
communication" would be subject of a fine of $100,000 or
two years in prison.

This would force carries to act as private censors of all
content available in public forums or file archives on
their networks.  Moreover, because there is no clear
definition of indecency, carriers would have to restrict
access to any content that could be possibly construed as
indecent or obscene under the broadest interpretation of
the term. Public forums, discussion lists, file archives,
and content available for commercial purposes would have
to be meticulously screened and censored in order to avoid
potential liability for the carrier.

Such a scenario would severely limit the diversity of
content available on online networks, and limit the
editorial freedom of independent forum operators.

ADDITIONAL NOTABLE PROVISIONS

* AMENDMENT TO ECPA

Section (6) of the bill would amend the Electronic
Communications Privacy Act (18 USC 2511) to prevent the
unauthorized interception and disclosure of "digital
communications" (Sec. 6).  However, because the term
"digital communication" is not defined and 18 USC 2511
currently prevents unauthorized interception and
disclosure of "electronic communications" (which includes
electronic mail and other forms of communications in
digital form), the effect of this provision has no clear
importance.

* CABLE OPERATORS MAY REFUSE INDECENT PUBLIC ACCESS
  PROGRAMMING

Finally, section (8) would amend sections 611 and 612 of
the Communications Act (47 USC 611 - 612) to allow any
cable operator to refuse to carry any public access or
leased access programming which contains "obscenity,
indecency, or nudity".

C.  ALTERNATIVES TO EXON: RECOGNIZE THE UNIQUE USER
    CONTROL CAPABILITIES OF INTERACTIVE MEDIA

Government regulation of content in the mass media has
always been considered essential to protect children from
access to sexually-explicit material, and to prevent
unwitting listeners/views from being exposed to material
that might be considered extremely distasteful.  The
choice to protect children has historically been made at
the expense of the First Amendment ban on government
censorship.  As Congress moves to regulate new interactive
media, it is essential that it understand that interactive
media is different than mass media.  The power and
flexibility of interactive media offers a unique
opportunity to enable parents to control what content
their kids have access to, and leave the flow of
information free for those adults who want it.  Government
control regulation is simply not needed to achieve the
desired purpose.

Most interactive technology, such as Internet browsers and
the software used to access online services such as
America Online and Compuserve, already has the capability
to limit access to certain types of services and selected
information.  Moreover, the electronic program guides
being developed for interactive cable TV networks also
provide users the capability to screen out certain
channels or ever certain types of programming.  Moreover,
in the online world, most content (with the exception of
private communications initiated by consenting
individuals) is transmitted by request.  In other words,
users must seek out the content they receive, whether it
is by joining a discussion or accessing a file archive.
By its nature, this technology provides ample control at
the user level.  Carriers (such as commercial online
services, Internet service providers) in most cases act
only as "carriers" of electronic transmissions initiated
by individual subscribers.

CDT believes that the First Amendment will be better
served by giving parents and other users the tools to
select which information they (and their children) should
have access to.  In the case of criminal content the
originator of the content, not the carriers, should be
responsible for their crimes.  And, users (especially
parents) should be empowered to determine what information
they and their children have access to.  If all carriers
of electronic communications are forced restrict content
in order to avoid criminal liability proposed by S. 314,
the First Amendment would be threatened and the usefulness
of digital media for communications and information
dissemination would be drastically limited.

D.  NEXT STEPS

The bill has been introduced and will next move to the
Senate Commerce Committee, although no Committee action
has been scheduled.  Last year, a similar proposal by
Senator Exon was approved by the Senate Commerce committee
as an amendment to the Senate Telecommunications Bill (S.
1822, which died at the end of the 103rd Congress).  CDT
will be working with a wide range of other interest groups
to assure that Congress does not restrict the free flow of
information in interactive media.

Subject: What makes a good DJ...
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com

What makes a DJ a good DJ?

Good records?
"Working" the room?
An inspired performance?
Inspired performance more than 10% of the time?
Good technical skills?
A good attitude?
Punctuality?
Willingness to work pro-bono?
Helping with the party?

I think everyone's got different answers to this. I certainly know
mine aren't the same as many people's. The important thing to remember
is THERE IS NO OBJECTIVE TRUTH on this issue. Respect other's
opinions, because you're both right.  It also helps when you present
opinions if you label them as such; otherwise, it looks as if you are
trying to set the objective truth for everyone.

Likewise, what is a party about? The music? The vibe? Drugs? Hugs?
None of the above! It's not about anything. It's what you want it to
be. If you consentually agree about part of it, then that's true for
you as a group. People go for different reasons. The party is about
many things to many people.

Please _do_ tell us what it means to you. Tell us why, too. :)

Sean

Good records and the ability to match the music to the crowd and use the
music to affect the crowd.

Technical ability.

Attitude (towards the music, the scene, the people, etc.)

Perserverence.

A cool name to attract groupies ;-)

[All the above in no particular order]

EDITOR'S NOTE: Milton did not write about Dj's getting PAID last week.
Our staff mis-quoted him, due to a typo. The true content of Milton's text
follows:

>what I disagree is on a DJ showing up, telling the promoters "I don't care if
>>your party got cancelled, I'm still getting LAID."

It seems Jeno  had something warm to go home to, but Carlos only got a
hummer. Explains who has kids at home to feed:)


Lotsa love,

3. The strategic importance of the Grateful Dead : I can't imagine doing
   this in the parking lot of a heavy metal concert ! There seems to
   be more tolerance at the GD shows. As I was walking the aisles , I came
   across two different living-room speaker setups , one playing Pink
   Floyd , and the other playing speed metal. And then there are the 
   punk rockers too.


There was also the stalwart drumming circle and suprisingly a disco cirlce,
but in passing through I heard some heads yell:  "Fuck that disco shit!" 
It had a pretty substantial group writhing to it though.  But nothing like
the Pig...

As a post-seasoned Dead fan, never before have I had the pleasure of
watching the Deadheads, self-proclaimed freaks that they are, stand with
wide-eyes and looks of disbelief while watching a group of people dance and
smile and spread love through music and respect.  (Which is also the
foundation of the Dead gestalt, though that has been tested and strained
for a very long time now.)  

It was a treat for sure.  There were just enough brave Deadheads to enter
our circle to show the timid ones that our tribe was peaceful and wouldn't
be boiling anyone at dawn; except, of course, for the blue vested security
people who shut it down at 10p.m.  Ah well, if they didn't stop us, we may
still be there right now, and then there would be no e-mail.  ;^}

Not that anyone cares, but I was so moved by this parking lot scene I had
to immediately whip out my journal and write:  "Talk about the melding of
parallel social groups:  I'm watching a Rastafarian try and dance to a rave
beat in the middle of a Dead show parking lot..."

Thanks to the all for making it happen.  :*}

Yeh, mijos, it was sweet. Phred was doin' his kewl stuff (especially his
sweet, playful Brazilian song) as I arrived with David Abel, we helped set
up his lights, Dave loves to bring them to parties. Dave is the dedicated
Head and raver from detroit, he wears that red sweatshirt with the yellow
and white diamond pattern on it.

Sean had his impossible to catch loop, it's off balance and when you throw
it up, it usually lands on yer face!

Bryce and Jeff tried to cheer me up, but my broken heart was set for
feeling sorry for itself( a stupid but self-indulgent trip), and I
apologize to anyone who may have felt put off or ignored, I really didn't
want to talk about it right then or have to lie to "how are you?"

All's good now, what a difference a rave makes:)
I really enjoyed seeing all these wonderful people together. I hope more
parties like this one happen, and that we all stick together.

Lotsa love,
 Milton and the E-Bee...........

Atomic Pig was the closest I've ever been to a Dead show, and it was a
lot of fun :). Deadheads have such a cool vibe that I can now see how
people can just drop out for a while and tour with them to see Dead
shows. Kinda funny too watching them try to get tickets before the
show. One envisions being the ticket fairy, giving away tickets at
random just to see their reaction :).

This party had a great vibe, a really friendly crowd of oh, three or
four hundred people, and some great music. I got there just before
Phred opened up the dance beats with a *great* set, the best I've
heard him play. I was smiling and dancing his whole set; people were
even dancing in the bathroom line about 1/2 block away :). Gil
followed with a fine set, bringing up the energy, and Galen really got
the vibe going with a strong dubby house set. People were hollering
when Ethan took over, and they kept hollering as he worked the groove
like an old master, building up to a great climax a little after 10
when we had to close up.

Another great free party :). Don't miss the next one!

  Actually, the Technics 1210's (European 1200's) were the most popular 
Christmas present this year in Europe this year (England, Germany, France...)
So I doubt they are going to stop selling them.

Dear Sfraves & Co.

	I image since the introduction of CD's into the market place; 
that company the make turntables are rethinking whether or not they woill 
continue producing them. I feel that the price of turntables and needles 
and cartridges will eventually go up; with less and less demand. This 
could be a problem for DJ"s wanting a good quality turntable. The reverse 
could happened meaning the price could go down; but I feel this is 
doubtful; although if the price does go down; I sure the quality will 
too.
	I image the effects portions of Cd's will get better so to allow 
for things like sracthing ..etc. You proabbly could get that effect with 
a laser diode placed inside a pen type reader; and have the Cd's on a 
rotating device with the readle surface face up. WHatever effect this 
produced I image it would be interesting to say the least.

Sincerely
Brian Darkness

Unifying the tribes, is THE only way to GO-

I speak from experience, having participated in the underthrowing of the
Apartheid System.
As long as we always keep in mind that the geography of division exists as
a means of controlling us, then we will not fall into the trap that so many
subcultures have - like creating a Rave Elite - lets open up the scene to
all who care to love and dance.  - as long as we can at least agree on the
fundementals - love of life, liberty and the pursuit of true happiness then
we can all dance together, like a fractal tribe iterating through the
rainbow colors of infinite soundscape. Bring on the ravefarians, ravepunks,
raveheads and any possible combination of culture we can come up with - We
are the new Fourth World - loving our way into the future perfect state of
happiness.
Way to Go SFravers - Deadhead Raves are way cool.
Lets think up even greater admixtures to up the evolution.

See I think you are one of the few.  Many adults with crappy childhoods 
attribute their depression to all other kids and decide that all kids are 
evil.  I've delt with their shit a lot.  I wish everyone could remeber 
that I'm not the kid who called them fatty when they were a kid.

 Zach asked what others think so here's my .02 -


 Personally, I think to some extent our culture needs more outlets of
 celebrations that the best raves represent AND many of those celebrations
 ( raves ) should be truly all ages - large extended families celebrating 
 together. What comes to my mind are village dances and celebrations of
 so called "primative" tribes. Instead, our so called "advanced" civilization
 pairs up and sets at home comatose in front of millions of boob tubes -
 what a way to promote mental and physical health.

 When I went to my first rave I was somewhat age sensitive being in the 40
 plus group and knowing that most "sensible" people my age would not
 approve of such activities. But at my first Come Unity I immediately flashed
 upon the ideas expressed above - here was a group of people coming together
 to celebrate in a way that could transcend culture, ethnicity and AGE. 
 Music, visuals, and dancing - all those brightly painted Indians dancing
 and singing by campfires had a good idea after all :-)  Also, I felt 
 saddened when I realized our society attempts to fragment itself into sex,
 age and ethnic groups - losing all sense of communal celebration in the
 process. So if I had my way, I let raves become REALLY all ages.

 Of course, many people worry about drugs, bedtimes and all types of other
 potential problems. Sure these exist and should be dealt with however there
 is no need to be so drastic as to totally forbid participation by any truly
 interested person. Unfortuanately, our society has become dare I say
 sick in its allowance of the propagation of moral standards into unjust and
 poorly conceived laws ( ie caberet, drug laws etc..). So much so that we
 find ourselves in the midst of a "war on drugs" that has become a war on
 ourselves with armed to the teeth armies on BOTH sides roaming the streets
 shooting each other like third world war zones - trapping innocent victums
 left and right. And still we have time to worry about someone underage
 actually having a good time celebrating with music and dance....

 Now I call that really civilized ;-)

	Yeah, I know, this question gets asked all the time. Most of
y'all might as well hit 'D' now, but if any of you want to help out a
comrade in need, please read on. I already checked through the bpm
list archives (btw, should Hyperreal include some kind of pointer to
bpm@dhp.com? It was ridiculously difficult for me to find), and bpm
was exactly the way I remember it being when I was subscribed a couple
years ago -- high on fluff, low on content. 
	I finally have enough cash to buy myself an SL1200 to go with
my Denon DN2000. I am ecstatic! My girlfriend and one of my friends
put on a rave that went _extremely_ well this weekend (uhh, that's by
Missoula, Montana DiY standards, BTW -- nobody's running out to buy
themselves an Infiniti anytime soon), and out of the blue they handed
me $410 in cash, with the explicit condition that I use it to buy a
turntable and _not_ music (ahh, how well they know me!). I personally
think this was a damn swell thing for them to do.
	Anyway, my father raised me to be a competitive shopper, and I
know how much the 1200 market fluctuates. I'd like to find an
SL1200MkII with an Ortofon Nightclub cartridge and an Anvil case for
under $600. Obviously, the cheaper the better. Somewhere in my
darkest, deepest heart of hearts lurks a gently fluttering dream that I
might be able to swing a $500 deal if I'm cagey. Does that sound like
I've been hitting the pipe too hard? Do any of you know any companies
that might be willing to swing me some kind of package deal?
F'rinstance, somebody (on nwraves) mentioned Full Compass Music
in Wisconsin, who apparently sell 1200s with 680 clone cartridges for
$350. Are they still this cheap, and does anybody have full contact
information for these people?
	And, to make up for all of this bandwidth hogging, I've come
up with an idea -- if y'all (I know that sounds hokey, but it's the
only real way to concisely indicate a plural 2nd person in English)
help me do the research, I'll keep a list of the cheapest places to
buy 1200s on my (soon-to-be-unveiled) Web page. Does that sound like
something useful? Is somebody else already doing something like this
(I would have thought so, but I didn't find anything).

ObNWRaves: X-1 (you can blame me for the name) in Missoula, Montana
this weekend was a hell of a lot of fun. Three sound systems, three
DJs, one local live act, tons of smiles and hugs, lots of cheering and
whooping, and an unvarnished good time for everybody! The vibe is
strong here, believe it or not (this is coming from someone who more
often than not ends up being disappointed by the vibe at Portland
events). I now feel confident in inviting the nw-raves posse to trek
out here for our next party (and anybody that wants to come out here
and spin is welcome to, of course. Groovy Dave? Spokane's only about
three hours away). It's all about having a good time here.

semi-ObSFRaves: Any of y'all know of any decent jobs in the Bay Area
for a newly graduating C/C++, HTML, and Unix wizard with strong
editing and technical writing skills? I'd really love to get down to
the SF area, but I need a job first.

ObIDM: Keep yr eyes peeled for ::AOAIOXXYSZ:: numbers two and three,
out soon. I've been up to my butt in midterms, helping out with the
rave, and my (ever-ballooning) Web pages, but my load should be easing
soon. All I'll say for now is that if you haven't heard anything on
Shiver records yet, you're really missing out.

thanks for your forbearance and help,

Yes it's true, I played my one current jungle track to start my Atomic Pig
set :-)  'So Fine' by DJ Pulse on Moving Shadow (natch).  I actually own
the Moonshine domestic release (on yelllller vinyl!) of 'Original Nuttah'
but that's because it's more of a museum piece :)  Actually, I'm not sure
'So Fine' is by DJ Pulse, the credits are a little vague on the matter.
But whatever.

Did my little mini-Africana-house set to start off with, then off to the
races with some other up tunes, including that current chugger white/black
label G.O.D. Limited.  The name alone makes you wonder what big NY remix
heavyweight put that out, it suuuuure has a familiar sound!

The tune Milton mentioned is 'Ligeirin' by Heitor, the sound is definitely
that of West African pop (soukous, what have you), and even has a "Cote
d'Ivoire" remix (plus one by 808 State :), but I believe he is Brazilian.

I had a great time.  Got to mix in my tie-dye for both my Deadhead and
raver friends.  A long-time dream come true :)

see you in the future!

	Ah, c'mon everybody, go easy on Brian! I'm sorry to contribute
to what is not that useful a thread, but I've been talking about this
stuff a lot with my non-DJ friends, and I think a lot of them have a
much different perspective on things than most of the DJs I know.
	Although I sweat blood over my sets (check
http://www.mbc.umt.edu/~ogd/aaxz/mixtapes/ for a sampling of what I
play), if you're careful and know your labels well, it really doesn't
take that long to put together a good crate. I just started buying
vinyl in August and have put ~$500 into my vinyl collection (OK, so
I'm ignoring my 600+ CDs, which I also spin out), and I now have well
over 100 really solid records that I play constantly. If you know what
you like, you don't have to hang out at the store all week. There are
no vinyl stores around here, and I've bought the vast majority of my
records used from friendly folks on the net.
	Plus, unless you're completely obsessed with being on the
cutting edge, you can get quite a bit of mileage out of older
music. People are always asking me to play their favorite songs, even
if they've heard them recently (sometimes in the same night) which
leads me to believe that songs don't get worn out nearly as fast as
many DJs fear. In fact, people around here often complain that I don't
play _enough_ stuff that they recognize! I played Moby's remix of
Orbital's "Speed Freak" and 808 State's "Cubik" this last weekend and
the crowd went absolutely nuts. Old songs have their own power.
	I DJ more out of love for the music and the crowd than for any
sort of material reward or ego gratification. I've only made money off
my spinning three times out of the many times I've played out, and I'm
perfectly happy with that. It makes me really happy to see the crowd
going nuts, but sometimes it's really hard for me to remember that
it's not really _me_, per se, that's making them so happy. I'm only
contributing. 
	Even knowing that makes it hard for me to avoid getting a big
head. Luckily, there are a lot of people around me who care enough
about me to (semi-)gently let me down when I'm being
self-aggrandizing. Even though sometimes I wish more people would tell
me what a great DJ I am, I think I'm healthier for the lack of it.

MY POINT:

	I have very ambivalent feelings about the prominence of DJs,
and a lot of this feeling comes from talking to people who are more
interested in raving than music. DJs and techno freaks think that the
DJ is important. People that just like to dance and have a good time
don't. The anecdotal evidence I've gathered supports that pretty
strongly. This makes me question why I place so much importance on the
DJ. I think it's mainly because I am one.
	I've come to the conclusion that yes, it _does_ make a
difference who's spinning, but only to a point. And it can be
extremely destructive if DJs forget that their only importance is in
how well they can entertain a crowd. I know I'm at my peak when I'm
taking the energy of the crowd and pushing it right back to them. When
everything's going strong, the DJ is part of the crowd, not above it.
	Also, giving DJs prominence feeds DJ Ego, which is one of the
most intractable and annoying forces known to humanity. Once it sets
in, it's really hard to root out. It destroys friendships. It breaks
up strong partnerships. It makes people bitter and upset with each
other for no good reason. DJ Ego has killed more scenes than I care to
count, and it came very close to killing our scene here in Missoula,
too, despite everybody's best efforts to avoid it. When the DJs start
thinking that they _are_ the scene, bad shit generally happens. I
won't name names, but Portland has had problems with this for years.
	I think that ideal DJs are faceless artists who are more
concerned with perfecting their own skills and keeping the vibe strong
than with gathering props. Raving should be all about the vibe. It's
that simple. To me, at least.

Hey all!

**HUG**

Sheesh... Didn't read my email in a week or so, and another big debate is
happening on the net...

Anyways... Since I haven't written in a long time, I decided to jump into
the debate on the subject of "kids" at raves...

Lemme try to be deep here (work with me people... hehe), what are "kids"
anyways... Does age really make people children? I think the rave scene is
about positive vibes, unity, peace, and love... It's not about age! I know
many people under 21 years of age who bring positive energy into the rave
scene. Many underaged ravers bring such loving vibes and energy into the
scene, it can only be considered wonderful...

I think the real "kids" of the scene are those who have no idea what the
scene is about, and simply go to raves to get high... Age should not be an
issue when parties are concerned. We are all out there to have a good time
and spread love and positive vibes... The only people we should be weary of
are those who cares nothing about unity, peace, or love...

Hey... Maybe I am biased, after all I am not 21 years old... But HEY! Don't
tell me I can't kick ass on the dance floor and spread love like any other
21+ ravers! :)

Love and hugs are always free!

Sincerely,
dragonfly

I beleive they have already discontinued both the 1200 (the ONLY turntable
realy usable by a Dj) & the 1210's, I don't know about their other models
though. There are still plenty new ones around & when those run out there
will still be plenty of long lasting used ones to tune up, which means big
bucks for those places selling parts for em'.

The 1210's actualy have a stronger motor & suck shit for mixing. They are
very jerky & do things like speed up the platter in response to your
slowing it down. *DON'T* buy one of these, even if the black covers do
look cooler. My friend has had his playing for over a month to try to wear
down the motor & they are still tight. Although if any of you don't care
about this & still want to buy some, I beleive he still wants to sell em' &
get some good ol' 1200's.

All the benefits we as adults realise from these celebrations are just as
important if not more so to the children who will live and shape the coming
millenium. May they do so hopefully, with love and peace in their hearts.

which is why the responisiblity for changing the world, rests unfortunately
on the shoulders of 18 year olds.
This IS the most under-reported fact of this century. I think they can do

Sort of, in that there are some versions of unix out there with a program 
called "unzip" which recognizes pk's format.  If you have a number of 
different accounts on different machines, give it a try on one of them 
and hope for the best :)

I'm going to Frankfurt this Sunday(March 5th) to attend a music(as in musical
instruments) trade show and was wondering if anyone out there knew
clubs/parties, record stores, or even better -- PEOPLE! -- in Frankfurt.  I
promise to write a detailed review of the scene when I get back!!  And if
anyone wants me take mix tapes or anything, I'd be happy to.

still in shock,
phuture

A matter has come to my attention that is of the utmost importance to all
of us online.

Simply put, a couple of senators have proposed a particularly
heinous piece of legislation titled the "Communications
Decency Act of 1995"  (Senate Bill S. 314).  Basically, the
bill would subject all forms of electronic communication --
from public Internet postings to your most private email --
to government censorship.  The effects of the bill onto the
online industry would be devastating -- most colleges and
private companies (AOL, Compuserve, etc.) would probably have
to shut down or greatly restrict access, since they would be
held criminally liable for the postings and email of private
users.

Obviously, this bill is designed to win votes for these senators
among those who are fearful of the internet and aren't big
fans of freedom of speech -- ie., those who are always trying to
censor "pornography" and dirty books and such.  Given the
political climate in this country, this bill might just pass
unless the computer community demonstrates its strength as a
committed political force to be reckoned with.  This, my friends,
is why I have filled your mailbox with this very long message.

A petition, to be sent to Congress, the President, and the media,
has begun spreading through the Internet.  It's easy to participate
and be heard -- to sign it, you simply follow the instructions
below -- which boil down to sending a quick email message to a
certain address.  That's all it takes to let your voice be heard.
(You know, if the Internet makes democracy this accessible to the
average citizen, is it any wonder Congress wants to censor it?)

Finally, PLEASE forward this message to all your friends online.
The more people sign the petition, the more the government will
get the message to back off the online community.  We've been doing
fine without censorship until now -- let's show them we don't plan on
allowing them to start now.  If you value your freedoms -- from
your right to publicly post a message on a worldwide forum to your
right to receive private email without the government censoring it --
you need to take action NOW.  It'll take fifteen minutes at the most,
a small sacrifice considering the issues at hand.  Remember, the age
of fighting for liberty with muskets and shells is most likely over;
the time has come where the keyboard and the phone line will prove
mightier than the sword -- or the Senate, in this case.



Here's what you have to do to sign the petition:

send an e-mail message to:  S314-petition@netcom.com
the message (NOT the subject heading) should read as follows:
SIGNED <your online address>  <your full name>  <U.S. Citizen> (y/n)
eg.  SIGNED lsewell@leland.Stanford.EDU  Laura Sewell  YES

If you are interested in signing the petition, I would highly suggest
investigating the details of the situation.  You can find out more on
the Web at    http://www.wookie.net/~slowdog    or in the newsgroup
comp.org.eff.talk

Dear Sfravers;

	Once again I looking for a clean home; so that I can share my 
life with some other people. I don't smoke cig's; but don't care if you 
do. I have two male siamese cats that are very friendly and loving; they are 
litter trained and declawed and nuetered. I keep odd hours; like most 
ravers do; I have an upper limit of $550/month with utillites included. 
I'm very quiet, considerate and communicative; you can see that from my 
posts. I love people and always do things to try and help out a roommate; 
80% of the time I'm never to busy to help a fellow housemate do whatever. 
I'm a licensed massage therapist,have a BS in Electrical Engineering, and 
am a Certified Electonic Technican. I really don't have a geographical 
preference as long as its close to San Francisco. I have a computer and 
spend a lot of time logging. I don't have a problem keeping my cats in my 
room; as long as its big enough.

	I don't like mean, rude, excessively drunk, selfish, 
inconsiderate, violent, illresponsible people. I expect that the rent I 
pay is and even derivative of the total rent; unless my room is either 
bigger or smaller; I'm not willing to sublet and pay for someone elses 
rent just because they hold the lease.

	I have some living room furiture; most kitchen appliences, 
blender, microwave, toaster ..etc. A great stereo 100watt+; a great 
computer 486DX2-66 with 500megs of harddrive space. Lots of artwaork 
everything from fine $$$ to stuff I found on the street. I also have my 
own car.

	If any of this sound interesting to you please either call me at 
510-254-0933 Ct Active or e-mail me at the addresses list below; placing 
the word roommate in the header to get my prompt attention.

  Me too, well one actually...If anyone would like two hours of Dave
  Clark (The Baron of Techno) dopr me a line...This guy is one hell
  of a DJ, but as I'm no TechnoHead...

  Also, I've a variety of tapes that I guess are rarer here - from the 
  1FM essential mix Saturday show - Paul Oakenfold, Andy 
  Weatherall, Darren Emmerson and other sexy british DJ's.

  Sound quality suffers (only slightly, ) but good tunes all the same,
  let me know if anyone is interested...

it was definetely a great time, although i wish i had gotten there 
earlier.  had an amazing time danceing, all kinds of people hanging out.  
the best thing i saw the whole night was about 45 minutes before it 
wrapped up, when a deadhead dad with his little son on his shoulders 
asked his son if he liked raves, and this little kid goes yah, they're 
cool. :)

willl c you all later, hopefully at come/unity's anniversary on wednesday...

ahh, the dead, a rave, what's the difference anyways, a whole lotta 
people having a good time.
