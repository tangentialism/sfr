Since you (Tim Beauchamp) mentioned stereos and a thunderstorm rocking the
house.  Why haven't we heard a really kick ass thunderstorm mixed in to an
ambient set or something?  Does this make it rave related?  Jeff

     Crunchman,
     
     Most of the big labels and their ever present lawyers have given on up 
     pursuing these dastardly rascals who make these analog tapes, because 
     they feel their wares are superior, casettes are inferior and degrade 
     rapidly after two generations, and that mix tapes are a niche market.
     
     Copyright law affects all areas of this music we love.  It seems the 
     familiar sounds we love to groove to are somebody elses to profit 
     from.  The birds own the tweets, the drummers own the beats, etc.
     
     Mix tapes usually use lengthy portions of existing music from 
     "original artists".  The tapes we listen to fit into the law as demos 
     of a DJ's talent, and so far haven't been pursued aggresively.  As 
     long as major labels (defining major might get hairy here... I think I 
     mean anything bigger than ma and pa ops) don't get involved in 
     distribution and it stays fairly underground, nobody gets crazy, 
     because it's just a DJ trying to let people know what he/she mixes 
     like, or historical audio accounts of an event (the FBI won't chase 
     you down for having music in the background of your wedding video for 
     example, and then showing somewhere else).
     
     Label releases and CD's are a different story.  Those have to put the 
     money where their mics are (or however they get the samples of music 
     featured from other artists) to stay legit.
     
     Bizarre enough for ya?
     
     Check out
     http://www.io.org/~macos/
     for a rundown on some artists trying to fight labels and take music 
     back to something it was before this century... something that anybody 
     could play, when nobody threw handcuffs and a fine at you for playing 
     Chopin at your piano.

Question... Do the DJ's that make up these tapes have to pay royalties to

they have to pay?  I'm most curious...

Sorry, didn't mean to for this particular pesimistic view of modern man
to be discriminatory.  On the assumption that vegetarians are descended
from the same creatures as non-vegetarians (i.e., those same communal
hunters) yes we all share this (un)intelligence way of living.

As for ambient sounds with thunderstorms--I'm sure there is plenty of
this in the form of music `formerly known as ambient' (and probably
still known as such in most other groups in society--i.e., ravers have
redefined the term it seems) Brian Eno I'm not sure about (though he
created quite a few Ambient albums) but of course those Nature albums
must have had thunderstorms, or is thunder against the relaxation-basis
of their existence?  Hmmn...

Either way, not a bad idea mixing in such natural sounds into the 
`New and Improved' ambient.

Sleep is a sign of caffeine deficiency--consult you local Pete's

Don't forget that if we had not had a meat based diet all those millions 
of years ago we would either be dead or still on the plains.  A totaly 
vegiterian diet is one of the most unhealthy diets one could choose; our 
motabalisms are designed for meat and fruits, not vegtables.  If you want 
to be really healthy go to an organic butcher and eat nothing but prime 
cuts of meat or sea-food along with potatoes; providing you drink milk you 
will eating a far more healthy diet then if you totaly went vegiterian.  
Remember we are merely primates and all primates eat meat in one form or 
another.
And if you think that you are doing the environment a service by going 
veggie then think again: We spray over 90% of our crops with 
incectersides causing greater illness in Humans then Mad cow desiese ever 
has or ever will.
So the key here is to not go vegiterian but to go organic.  There is an 
organic butcher in Sf on Lombard Street up in the Marina district and you 
can buy organic fruit and veggies at Rainbow groceries on (or around!) 
14th Street and Howard.  For something to be able to be called organic it 
must have been grown in soil that has not had pestersides sprayed into it 
for the last twelve years; and I wonder how many fruits and veggies you 
could say that about at safeway.

You should read a short story by Roald Dahl called "The sound machine" 
about a guy who invents a machine, quite by chance, that can record the 
pain felt by plants as they are being cut.  At first he merely listens 
to roses being cut.  Next he cuts down a tree while listening to the 
machine and thing's start to get really interesting.......

Everyone who does eat meat, however, should go to a slaughter house or go 
to a farm and spend a day watching animals being killed; or, better yet, 
kill a few animals yourself while you are there.  If you can not do this 
then you have no right what-so-ever to be a meat-eater and you should 
become vegiterian which is, as I have already stated earlier, a very 
unhealthy diet to have.

     Doing the happy morning dance while shaking their heads wondering if 
     the whole damn thing was a dream and opening their eyes to a 
     beautiful, albeit a little less beautiful but a lot more real than the 
     one they spent the night in.  The cradling arms of ecstasy releasing 
     us like children back to the playground after a hug from mother.  
     Dried sweat and dried tears making us look like binge drinkers who'd 
     suddenly decided enough was enough in a moment of clarity, with a 
     taste in our mouths like vanilla and cotton.  Pupils indescriptly 
     looking wrong as we continue to look at one another and smile... 
     thinking rejoice, for we were there.  How many dreams can you come

     So by show of hands, who is going to Juggernaut and who is going to 
     Chrysalis?  I think I'll hit C, but that room with Dutch, Theta Blip, 
     Radley, and Surge at JRGNT seems like such a nice place to get lost 
     for an evening ... It would be nice to see some familiar faces this 
     weekend.

     Ever wonder what SoCal Raves are like?
     
     Anybody who feels like travelling the weekend of the tenth should 
     consider LA... the event is called Opium/Visions of Shiva (they were 
     passing out flyers at Freedom, funky gatefold yin/yang).  If I get 
     friends fly free, would anybody want to go with and split fares 
     ($40-$60roundtrip)?  I'd be flying out of San Jose Friday 8/9 night, 
     and coming back Sunday 8/11 night, and I've got a place to crash while 
     we're there.  The past Shiva events have been  supposedly pretty 
     groovin (haven't gone personally, but I'm on a good recommendation 
     here).  I could also have a friend pick up presale tix for $15 and 
     pass the savings on to you!

Mike,

     I believe my argument should have been understood to mean that the
capacity for language i.e. wernicke's area in the brain, evolved because it
was easier to coordinate a group hunt with language than without.  Of course
advanced society would have been difficult if not impossible to develop
without agriculture and the ability to store enough food to allow us the
leisure to develop our cognitive abilities.  If you look at animals that hunt
cooperatively (like wolves for example) they have a higher developed
'language' and social hierarchy than deer or herbavores in general.  They
have to or they won't survive.  Likewise in our pre-agricultural period we
had to cooperate and communicate in order to survive.  Lets face it, we are
pretty weak and unarmed compared to the rest of the animal kingdom. This may
be the very reason our brains became so highly evolved.  If we could get
everything we needed nutritionally from grazing like a cow (Which requires
four stomachs and bacteria I might add) our brains would probably be much
like a cow's we wouldn't require more.  Hope this helps yet I have no idea
how this subject got so far off base.    Jeff

Is it to early to be all excited about this?  Maybe, but I have heard so 
much and I just can't stop thinking about it :).  (It's all Tony's fault).

I hope a lot of people are going, because I heard it was amazing :).  I 
have never been, so I was just wondering if there were few good people 
willing to share few good advices on what is the best way to get there 
(rent an RV, van, bum rides :P), just little tricks and tips that would 
be helpful.

Thanks and have fun for the rest of the week (and weekend of course).
Hugz,

Hi Jason-

 You are definitely right about the output level falling off towards the end of 
the tape.  I forgot to mention this to my friends who now have possesion of 
this tape.  The story behind this is that the phone rang during the last song, 
and instead of turning down the volume on the amp or just moving to another 
room, I lowered the level output on the channel that the song was coming 
through.  I guess you live and learn.  Anyway, I hope you enjoy the tape, and 
I'll probably have a new one ready soon in the future.
 And here is my two cents on this DJ mixtape idea.  I like it, but I'm way too 
busy right now to help organizing it.  Maybe some time down the road I'll be 
able to contribute.

-Todd

Hm, I'm not so sure about this.  There is a big difference between
listening to a single, autonomous, unmixed song and listening to the
same one which is part of a much larger progression (that being the
mood the dj creates through his or her track selection and mixing
style).  Besides, with an import 12" running around $10, often with
as few as two or three tracks, getting an hour's worth of mixed
music feels like a bargain.

If you are a dj yourself, you'll most definitely seek out the featured
songs that you liked because you'll need the track 'clean' before you
can do anything with it :)

Me too. It is getting really close and its definetely time to start 
getting your shit together. Out little subcamp is having out first 
planning meeting tomorrow night. 

I learned alot from last year and it pays to coordinate with your fellow 
campers. Pool your resources. Last year many of us brought duplicate 
stuff to share and we ended up just lugging a bunch of extra stuff back 
home with us (we could have used that precious space for water).

My main contribution to our subcamp is to construct a central 
tarp/canopy that will *not* blow over in high winds. A nice central 
shaded area with carpet and lots of comfy cushions is crucial for 
chilling and sleeping in the hot afternoons. My tent was just too damn 
hot. Last year I ended up chasing our central tarp across the playa 
several times during the storms and I don't want to repeat that this 
year.

I saw several people who must have learned the hard way and had big 6"+ 
dia. wooden poles with 24"+ stakes to hold up their tarps. They had no 
problem standing up to the storms that passed.

My $.02 on the subject of reliable shade...

peace,
martin

Hey all,

common that you need not post it in your descriptions before parties, it's
that you're all beaming with light and love!  Some of you might not be
aware of that, but I see and feel it every time I see you, and that's one
reason it's such a joy for me to be among you in all the beautiful
experiences we share.

I love you all!

Eric

P.S.: I'm feeling much better.  Thanks for everyone's support.  I think
Nancy and I are clearing things up, and understanding each other better :)

This is an interesting argument, and one I've often heard/used before   
myself.  But now that I rethink it, maybe it doesn't make as much sense   
as it seems on the surface.  Is it really true that if I find a task   
unpleasant, I am in the wrong to hire someone else to do it rather than   
not do it/have it done?  If I would really find a slaughterhouse   
revolting, but I eat meat, it doesn't necessarily follow that I am living   
under an illusion.  It only follows that I don't want to see a   
slaughterhouse.  If I am aware of what goes on in a slaughterhouse, why   
would I be obligated to go see it?  It seems there are plenty of things I   
am aware of, that I don't feel should be changed, but that I still don't   
particularly care to see.
Thoughts?

Everyone who does eat meat, however, should go to a slaughter house or go   

to a farm and spend a day watching animals being killed; or, better yet,
kill a few animals yourself while you are there.  If you can not do this
then you have no right what-so-ever to be a meat-eater and you should
become vegiterian which is, as I have already stated earlier, a very
unhealthy diet to have.

It's been really interesting reading everyone's take on vegetarianism.
Though some of it I tend to disagree with and some statements I know are
just plain wrong, I think it's cool that everyone is being really civil
about their comments.  I feel really strongly about vegetarianism, but
I'm not into preaching about it.  Ultimately it's always up to the
person to decide what's right for them, and where their "point of
moderation" lies on the continuum.  The questions on "what about plants?
they feel too" is a really good one, IMHO.  I could go off on this
question for a while, esp from the view of the religion of Jainism (yes,
like my last name).  I won't bother now, unless people really want to
hear about it, 'cuz it looks like this subject has been discussed a lot
already.

In the meantime, thanks to all of you who responded wanting Indian
vegetarian recipes, etc...I want to respond to all of y'all but work is
VERY insane right now and I might not get a chance till...well,
hopefully not too long!

In the meantime, here's the name of that book I mentioned:
It's called "Lord Krishna's Cuisine:The Art of Indian Vegetarian
Cooking" by Yamuna Devi.  It's a phat book.  She gets really into the
detail of everything, and calls for the use of a lot of spices. 
My daily cooking is of course more simple and fast...when I get 
some time I'll send those of you who asked a recipe or two!
				                             
Who knows, if we ever have a get-together again with food maybe I can
bring something yummy! :oD

bye!

IMHO, if you don't visit one, then you really DON'T know what goes on
in one.  To be honest, I find it a lot harder to take certain vegetables
for eating (esp carrots, onions etc where you are killing the entire
plant for its food) when I pick them myself.  For that matter I don't
like buying cut flowers or even plucking one now that I grow my own.  It
just seems unneccesary, esp the flowers...kill a plant for decoration?
(though I've heard that some plants prosper if you harvest the flowers)
I'm sure many people might find this ridiculous and extreme, but I
really feel like you're NOT really conscious of the energy of the
plant/animal unless you visit/take it/kill it yourself.

Just my thoughts :)

This is such a beautiful perspective.  Funny, I saw Ted Nugent on 
Politically Incorrect a few weeks ago, and he said the same thing about 
killing animals.  Harvesting food makes for strange bedfellows.  ;)

P.S.  Don't get me wrong I think Nugent is a pig, but he does have a 
point about how removed american society is from how we get our meat.

I may be missing the context here, (I missed your first post about it), but
are you really saying you think a vegetarian diet is unhealthy?  That
statement is crazy.  I'm not trying to flame you, but I would like to know
your justification.  Thanks.

Hey all,

I was wondering if anybody out there knows what the deal with the Prodigy
performing at the Trocadero tonight. Adds in the SF weekly state that this
is a free event, but that one should listen to live 105 for details.
For obscure reasons that frequency seems to be taken over by KFOG and
some religious station on my radio so I can't get the details...
And since it is  supposedly _free_, I'm concerned there may be a catch.
Mrs. Frying Dutchman would really love to go...

Ok, so I need to do some SERIOUS vibe generation this saturday.  I've 
been told Chrysalis really represents the beauty of the Sf scene, and is 
brimming with PLUR.  But Juggernaut has some DJs listed that promise to 
rock my world, but good.

Recommendations, and reasons why they are different, anyone?

Thanks!

I once had a discussion with Seth from the list about meat v. veg. and he
made a very interesting point, that actually turned me back towards meat for
a short time.  (Had sushi twice, but then quit again)   He pointed out that
inorder for the average human to sustain life, he/she must consume life.  We
must destroy it and make it part of ourselfs.  Pretty brutal if you really
think about it.  It's really just a matter of where you draw the line as to
what level of life you want to take.   I personnally draw the line with
animals, but again that's my choice.  My discussion with Seth didn't change
my behavior in the long run, but it did open my eyes to something I hadn't
yet seen.  Thanks.

..Imagine if you will......Somewhere kids are laaughing. Somewhere records
are spinning......but...some more barbeque fluid needed to be sprayed on the
fledgling Full Moon flame last Tues night.

Being an Alumni of various Full Moon Madness....when the message flashed
about 12:30 that the Full Moon was ON decided to go to sleep for a few--jump
in the car and try to make it by 5:00 in time for sunrise..

Well, I made it by 6:00...about 10-15 of the hale and hearty..a "brace of
kinsmen"...undulating to the some acid jazz of Markie....nice tunes,great
sound system, great spot down from the Lighthouse from Half Moon bay...Tracy
and Mark showed up a little later......All this party need was people...

Probably just a temporary set-back...but this is a party that should never
die...While in the past the cult of silence (lack of promotion) was one of
the magic draws for this party..it this case...it succeeded in silencing
itself..

Thanks to Geoff,Markie,Mark,Tracy,and Brian Darkness...for trying to fan the
fragile flame.....And hey...I didn't go to the Fnf...but I did go the Full Moon,
( I mean the Halloween Full Moon in 94 with 1500 mad revelers on the beach)...

I think I'll remember that a little more than last Tuesdays......

For a topic that has so many opinions and one that I've personaly have seen
fight over, this has been a really great thread here  calm, cool, and
collective replies to one another too. No body really jumping on anyone
else for eating this are that. Too bad all the threads that have way too
many strong opinions can't end up being like this one is doing.

I do have two questions,. 1. Why is it that SF seems to have the most
Vegetrians then any other city in the Bay Area. and 2. If a cow was raise
as gentle and as good as humanly possible, free from and harm, then given
something that when it goes to sleep it just never wakes up. No pain or
suffering.  It's that more exemptable(sp?) to eat it then?

Personally I fail to see the logic behind this. Our society is already so
far removed from the time were everybody had to build their own shelter,
gather their own food etc. It's like stating that if you cannot build
your own car you shouldn't be allowed to drive one. And as far as the
moral issue is concerned, by the time the world will be severely over-
populated (give it a few more years) I can assure you I will have no
problem killing a chicken to survive. Besides, the whole discussion
seems to be a luxury problem, so many people do not get to choose
what they eat, they're just hungry. IMHO the best way to assure a
better life for the animals (and crops) we're growing and eating
would be to reduce the number of people on this planet. Otherwise
we will have keep coming up with more industrialized ways of feeding
us all. For now, the fittest are surviving, and that's us...

Thanx much for the run-down.   I was always curious about that...   I used
to make tapes of segued songs (Not techno,  but new age) and always just
circulated
them among friends...   I've thought about selling the tapes,  but was advised
against it...   But I understand now,  because House and Techno music is so
underground....  The lack of a radio station that plays it 24/7 makes it
very clear just how "Underground" this kind of music is..

Although,  in talking with a friend in Moscow,  they have a radio station there
that plays house/techno/rave music 24 hrs/day,  7 days/week,  featuring British
and European DJ's.    It also turns out that Russia is now getting famious for
hosting huge massive raves with 100,000 plus people,  out in the woods near
Moscow.

Moscow areas and the Crimean areas like Yalta are the rave "Hot spots" in Russia
so I'm told.

St Petersburg (formerly Leningrad) has a rather weak scene but has some
pretty good
clubs..    I'va asked my Russian friend to pass me more information on the
Moscow
scene.

After living in Russia (just before the coup),  I can understand the tolerance
the authorities have for raves.   Things are much more free over there...
contrary to US beliefs.

Possibly, but I still wouldn't do it myself, because I couldn't kill the animal.

The only problem with this logic is that if more or all of the planet were
vegetarians, there wouldn't be to much starvation.  I'm sure someone has
gone over the stats how much grain it takes to produce a pound of meat, as
opposed to how many people that same grain could feed.

Just my thoughts about your thoughts.

Yes, IMHO. (I still probably wouldn't eat the cow for health reasons,
but that's another story.)

Other veggies may disagree for other reasons.

The problem is that no matter what solution, the exponential explosion of
human population is going to catch up with it at some point. And think
about this, if every other living animal that is now being bred for
human consumption would be set free to breed, eat and live happily ever
after, where would they go? Where would they graze? And what about if
we would stop killing rabbits or rats eating our veggies? Some way or
another you would have to stop them from eating our food, which even
if you don't shoot or poison them means they will die because of you.
These are pretty complicated and hard to solve problems, especially
since with us humans around it will be hard to create a stable eco-
system (unless we give up most of our modern ways of living).

And on the heart-problem/meat thing, how are these numbers if all
these meat consumers would have regular exercise and eat their
veggies at the same time?

Why can't we all just agree to disagree on this subject. Many people (like me) are just 
not too interested in becoming vegitarian. Don't you guys watch the Simpsons? Remeber 
when Lisa Simpson wanted to become a vegitarian? She tried to make everyone else one 
too, but then after Abu and Paul McCartney had a little talk with Lisa, she realized 
that she has to accept the people for who they are and not impose the vegitarianism on 
them.

The problem I have with paying others to do the "dirty work" is it
often results in a lack or loss of respect for life taken to survive.
Children often seem to believe that meat comes from "disneyland" in
clown containers etc.... I can live with any meat eater who takes
full responsibility for killing what they eat... that doesn't necessarily
mean they actually have to do it - but they should be willing to if
asked and not be squemish about it...

 My relatives were like that - all hunters - all very willing to kill and
prepare meat and not particularly squemish about it... as I child I saw
rabbits, frogs, squirrels, deer etc. killed cooked and eaten. It's a dirty
(actually bloody) job so I wouldn't say anyone has to kill/prepare the
meat they eat on a daily basis... no reason for that.. but they should
know and respect where their meat comes from (and we should have more  
respect than we do for plants also)...

 I became vegatarian (actually I eat seafood) when I realized that there
were certain animals that I would not comfortably kill as I had seen
done by my relatives... my guideline for eating became if given the 
opportunity would I kill it myself? My answer was no for mammals & birds
so I no longer eat them... for fish and shrimp my answer was yes I would
kill and prepare them- so I continue to eat them... EVEN though I  am
seldom the one doing the killing- the point being I "sanction" their
death by eating them....

 So if you or anyone else feels comfortable with actually killing animals
I for one have absolutely no problems with you eating them...actually
I would prefer you eat them - with respect rather than kill for no reason.
On the other hand, there is something dishonest (IMHO) about not being
willing to take life yourself- being totally disconnected and in denial
about it- if you insist on eating it...  it's like you should look your
"victims" in the eye and "honor" their contribution to  your life....

Does that make sense ?

A typical animal has to eat about 5-10 calories in grain to produce 1
calorie of meat. In other words, grain production is a more efficient
food producer than meat production by a factor of about 5-10.
(Knucklehead has just posted more complete stats.)

However some animals can survive on land which is unsuitable for even
low-intensity, permaculture-based cropping. So in a situation of severe
over-population, there will be *some* scope for meat production.  This
meat production would be guaranteed to be "free-range". There would be
no scope for dairy or egg production, apart from on a hunter-gatherer
level.

Somebody unsubscribed my wife from SoCal Raves, as well. Is this some
trendy way of lashing out at random? I can just see it: drive-by unsubs.
Some guy sitting in a clock tower somewhere unsubbing people, "just

Absolutely. That point has been made by many a punk band, who sell *CDs* for $8.

I still haven't figured out the economics of mixtapes. I've talked to
people at every step of the way: DJs, record store owners, mixtape dealers
(yes, there are some of those,) and they all claim to make very little on
each tape (about $1-$2 seems to be the average claim.) So where do the $15
to $18 go? You get $2 for the DJ, $2 for the middleman. Does that mean
duping and art is costing $11 to $14 per tape? No way. So here's my theory:
$5 to $6 to the DJ, $5 to $6 to the middleman, and $5 to $6 for duping and
art, meaning everybody's making a healthier profit then they're letting on
(and more power to them,) and the duplicators are ripping everybody off.

I still buy a fair number of mixtapes. I just stay aware of the economics,
and figure that DJs get paid to play, so that takes care of buying records
(it's their overhead, so to speak.) Mixtapes are just a potentially
lucrative sideline. You don't hear people like Eli Star or (cough, spit)
Keoki complaining about how they make so little money from mixtapes! But
then again, you have people like Joe Rice who practically give their tapes
away, and those are often my favorites anyway.

Peace, and thanks for hanging with me this long...

I bet that everyone on this list respects your choice on that. I really
haven't seen any hassle another because of there choice, at least not
publicly.  I eat meat too. I don't think I can give up BBQ'd Beef Ribs, or
steak. Probally the other forms of meat I could give up easy, but not those
two.

     More amazing insights from the gentleman who wrote 'wang dang sweet 
     poontang'.  I wish I could be that deep someday.  And yes, he does 
     have a point, but there's few things as cruel as bowhunting (if you 
     consider lengthy death cruel, and if you empathise with critters).  
     Did I mention he's a republican?

This is such a beautiful perspective.  Funny, I saw Ted Nugent on 
Politically Incorrect a few weeks ago, and he said the same thing about 
killing animals.  Harvesting food makes for strange bedfellows.  ;)
     
P.S.  Don't get me wrong I think Nugent is a pig, but he does have a 
point about how removed american society is from how we get our meat.

This will sound brutal and unkind, but people pen up animals so that they 
don't breed freely and eat up all the food.  But people are doing exactly 
that:  they are freely breeding and eating up all the food!  

I saw this show on Oprah one day (yes, I unashamedly watch television!) 
and the topic was on large families.  There were all these people 
cheering about families of 10, 15 and 17 etc. memebers like they are 
proud of it!  How can women turn themselves into brood mares like 
that???  What's more, how can they possibly *afford* all those kids?  I 
don't see anything wrong with having one or two kids - I'm even feeling 
somewhat guilty for wanting *one* child someday.  Yes, human 
overpopulation is a topic that much concerns me.  I think its one of the 
reasons why people are so terrible to each other.   Remember the rat 
experiments where they were forced to live too many in the cage?  The 
rats ended up killing each other and dying of stress related causes.   I 
think the same thing is happening, to a certain extent, to humans.

love,
Amy

meanwhile, the writers of the show are trying to push vegetarianism on us.
The Simpsons is hands down my favorite show and TV, but that episode pretty
much bummed me out because the show never stooped to ABC-family-style
preachiness of that sort in the past, and all of a sudden the irreverent
brutal jokes become few-and-far-between amidst Apu's garden of delight and
Paul McC's cocky liverpool salad humor.

I'm sorry for the negative vibe of this post, but I feel very strongly
about the Simpsons. =)

PS... did anyone get last season's finale on tape? I hear Cypress Hill was
on it... I kicked myself right in the ass (not an easy feat, to be sure!)
when I found out I missed it. Will they show it again before this season's
premiere?

Filet mignon, every November 8th, for my birthday dinner.  I love it!
That's the only time I know I'll be eating "red meat."  The rest of the
time, maybe I'll use lean ground beef in my chili or spaghetti, but usually
I'll mix it or substitute it with ground turkey.  Santa Maria tri-tips are
also delicious!  My dad has a preparation for cooking them on the BBQ that
can't be beat :)
I don't think anyone views us as horrible people for the things we eat.  As
long as we respect everyone's right to make their own choices, and as long
as enough of the earth's resources are preserved, people of diverse diets
can co-exist relatively peacefully.

Bowhunting isn't that cruel, but there's no non-cruel way to kill, is
there?  The animal is shot to bring it down, then it's throat is supposed
to be slit to kill it.  Humans have hunted that way for milennia.  We
should poll some indigenous people for their perspective on this whole meat
issue.

In Japan there's two types of beef that are supposed to the the best
and most expensive in the world.  The cows live the life of luxury
(without freedom but then there's something to be said for that too)

	- fed beer-soaked oats
	- massaged 3 times daily

then slaughtered for some really tender beef.

Don't sound to bad to me.  I wonder if there's any like-minded canabals
out there looking for livestock?

SUBJECT: RE: meat vs. veggies

  Now, I swore I wasn't going to get into this meat vs. veggie thing
  because it's just not an issue with me.  People are going to eat how and
  what they want, as they have a right to.  Though this is a pleasantly
  civil discussion, I'm surprised the thread has lingered this long.

  Personally, I have no problem whatsoever in lower life forms being
  killed for my culinary pleasure.  I am also satisfied that I need not
  justify that decision with anyone other than myself.  Neither does a
  vegitarian need to justify his/her decision.  My diet is healthy and
  balanced, and all health tests concerning such things as cholesterol
  are excellent so all is just peachy on the nutrition front. :)

  I did however have to comment on the below items...

>I agree with rick, even if I do eat meat...take a look at these FACTS, I
>have alot more where this comes from too

  Uh, no, these are not "FACTS", these are statistics/trivia as currently
  presented.  Statistics can say anything.  This is not to say they are
  or are not true since there are too many unanswered questions to even
  get to that point yet.  Questions such as how were these figures
  arrived at?  What sort of study was conducted?  Who conducted them and
  when?  Etc., etc....

>   * Risk of death from heart attack by average American man: 50%

  Define "risk of death."  What exactly does that mean?
  Who is the "average American man"?
  Does this say that a fit 19yo male has a 50% chance of dying today
  of a heart attack?  Or is this a 58yo man who smokes 3 packs of cig's
  per day, eats an obscenely high fat diet, is 100lbs overweight, and
  sits on his ass all day long?

>  * Risk of death from heart attack by average American vegetarian man: 15%
>  * Risk of death from heart attack by average American purely vegetarian
>    man: 4%

  Again, who is this "average American vegitarian"?
  Is he of the same age as the prior "average American"?
  Are ALL other variables the same except for diet, or does this
  "average" person also exercise regularly and does not smoke?

 As you can see these are fairly meaningless statistics without
 appropriate back up.

Maybe the cows would prefer to be out munching grass? Has anyone

they'd prbably tell you that when they go out and kill an animal, they use
the meat, the skin, the bones and other parts for more than just food.
They'd be pretty shocked to see some meat packing slaughterhouse here where
maybe half the meat is used and the rest of the animal is either thrown
away or sent to McD's. I think there's a helluva lot more respect and honor
involved when a group of people get together and bring down an animal that
they need to survive, than when a group of people build a meat packing
plant in some former central american rainforest so fat white trash hicks
can enjoy a royale with cheese. People never ate meat like they do now;
even in Europe no one ate meat regularly until just this century; meat was
just too valuable and the animals too useful to kill em for burgers. Mass
consumption of meat is an american invention (my cousin in Poland was
watching NBA basketball and his first comment was "there's so many fat
people in America!" --you think that has anything to do with our eating
habits?). I think the pioneers were too lucky to find all this empty space;
it's bred an attitude of arrogance in americans that makes us think we can
do any damn thing we please and ain't nobody gonna get in our way.

I do still eat meat, but I'm tryin' ringo... I'm tryin' REAL HARD to be the
shepherd.

well, i certainly don't think this is a bad idea.  whether or not the dj's
and artists get paid for an individual tape, they still benefit from the
added exposure to new and receptive ears - that is, if those who make the
copies also transfer the dj/artist/tracks/labelcontacts/telephone#s and
really whatever came with the original (cover art included) to the copy.
on an individual level trading works for everyone and never gets out of
control because it's limited by the number of new people one can meet but
when centralized on the internet the number of copies is sure to increase.
i don't know if it's good or bad, i guess we all want to get something for
nothing?  feels better that way?  personally i think it's in the best
interest of community to start directing funds to others in our community
rather than trying to get things for free.  rather than going out to buy
something from a personally anonymous company spread your money (energy) on
those you feel are doing good or to quote someone "put your money where
your mind is".  create your own economic network.  perhaps a way to make
the tape collective more palatable to the djs and artists who will
eventually be willingly or not donating to the cause would be to take a
collection for tapes traded (i'm thinking a dollar or so) and have a vote
or tally the tapes sold and throw a party, invite the dj's who sold the
most tapes and spread the money back to them so they can buy more records
to make more tapes for you to buy and then trade some more.  the essence of
this message is reallly that in order for any community to sustain and grow
energy (money) must flow.  the alternative is a dead-end where dj's don't
make enough to buy records to support the artists to make more records to
be played in clubs where new faces get turned on and want some tapes to
take home - but oh there's no tapes anymore, or clubs either because nobody
wants to pay anymore they'd rather pay for drugs and shoes and bits of
glitter than for music.  if you've got it, spread it around, if you're
empty now dupe today and tomorrow when you've got a little to share
remember those who got you through hard times and buy a tape, alternatively
why not send something you have made?  energy exchange doesn't always have
to use money for a vehicle, knit a cap, write a story, bake some cookies,
make dinner, rap on someone's answering machine, collect some sand dollars
on the beach, learn origami.......

it might make you feel better, but the point is, you are still eating way up

really, i was wondering the same thing. how my lifelong diet is somehow
unhealthy, even though i am much healthier and have a much faster metabolism
than most people i know.

me and my unhealthy diet will challenge anyone to a food/tennis contest.
first i eat as many veggies as possible, my oppenent eats as much food as
possible. then we play. i'm feeling pretty confident about my chances. ;)

	Are you sure you don't want to narrow "food" down to "meat"? _My_
unhealthy diet consists of lots of sugars, caffiene, and other stims.
You SURE you think you will have more energy than I do? ;-)

Maybe the cows would prefer to be out munching grass? Has anyone 
thought to ask them?

heh. =)
but just meat would signify a carnivore, we're talking about omnivores.
while sugar, caffeine, etc, may help you feel better, they only inhibit you
in a sport where supreme concentration for hours on end is required (i.e.
tennis). and with sugar, you're going back to the issue of simple
carbohydrates and complex carbohydrates. sugar might make you feel good for
a while, but after that short time you're going to burn out and not be able
to compete at maximum ability in any sport of long-duration. i'm sure my
diet that consists of mostly complex carbohydrates will have a signifigant
advantage over any that consists of simple carbohydrates and stimulants.

i'm still feeling pretty good about my chances. ;)

I can say this about the energy veggies give you, everytime I go to Fresh
Choice...for those who don't know it is a all you can eat salads and pasta
place. I load up on salad and pasta..no meat. I get full, but it doesn't
feel the same way. I don't feel a bad full like I do with meat. I also get
a little high of the food. It a great natural high, and I feel great.

Just throwing in another 2 cents.

I don't know if I want to face the harsh life of Playa living with only

Here's a thought for everyone in relation to our current veg/meat thingee:

Name a country outside of the industrial world (especially the U.S.) that 
is rich enough to provide a healthy year-round *vegan* (not just 
vegetarian) diet.  You'll be hard pressed to find one.

The Third-World lacks the resources to provide the required food 
year-round that a healthy vegan diet requires.  Milk and eggs are usually 
a necessary supplement.

So, eating *vegan* in the U.S. is actually quite a luxury.


the devil's advocate,

KaySEE

the use of the earth's resources is involved. hemp entered my mind, 
perhaps because of some connection between current inefficient use of 
resources, and alternative more efficient methods/resources.
if we are considering compassionate ways of livng and using what the 
earth has given us, hemp is a crucial element.
instead of clearcutting forests for cattle, plant hemp?
hmmm...

(and to my friends on nw-raves, too :)

Well, I'm a Taurus, Eric (May 18, 19647)...How about Galactic Signatures?
(Mayan Calendar).

According to the Mayans, I'm a Red Planetary Serpent (Chicchan 10) and
TODAY is my
super-duper power day!  Today is Red Planetary Serpent, this is the wisdom
for today and the vibration I was born into and carry with me...

"Kin (day) 205 of the Tzolkin:  INSTINCT

Tribe:  Chiccan - (CHEEK'CHAN) "Serpent" East, Red.  Focus in the
intrinsic wisdom of your body.  Honor the perfection of your physical
temple.  Call on your instinct.  Merge with the vibrant life force
pulsing within.

Tone:  10.   Manifestation.  Meet my challenge.  Perfect my
manifestation, Produce!  "Planetary."

from Galactic Mayan Calender, Ben 4 Productions, Portland, OR...
made by Sister Sky Compton.  If anyone wants any info about these
calendars let me know...natural time is BAD-ASS! and lot more fun than the
Gregorian calendar.

happy manifestation!

madame shakti, aka, bren :)

p.s.

we just started a new year, Blue Self-Existing Storm year and this is Moon
1, "Magnetic Bat"  which is Moon of Purpose.  Why did you come to this
planet?  What is your purpose?  Call the Ahau voiceline for a special
message...

Wheew!  Apology accepted whole heartedly! :)  I'm glad we can be at peace,
because we obviously think in similar circuits.  The booth idea is great!
 Hope it can be acomplished!  As for the tape, I will get back to you... I'm
leaving in seconds to go to the desert(burning man practice).  Hope all is
well!

Everything you need to know is on the Burning Man web page.

If you don't have Netscape I strongly urge you to find someone who does.
You will find everything on this page extremely helpful....

I'm excited too!!!!

The VW camp (Vince and Wayne) :-) will be getting there Wednesday
afternoon/evening to stake out our little place in paradise...

I assume at this point that we will once again be located exactly between
the main camp and the rave camp, just like last year. We would *love* to
have our little oasis on the playa to be at least as large as it was last
year where we had 7+ RV's, the 22' VMAR rig, and an assortment of cars and
other vehicles that comprised our town... members included Cyborganics,
Organics, F&F people, SFR people, etc.... there were at least 50 of us...
and I am hoping to also get the Syntonics and Brits (Theta) also co-located
with us.

More info as the date approaches!

I was just thinking that meself.  Count me in.  We could circle the
wagons, as it were, and throw some tarps/parachutes/tanned hides across
the courtyard--just like last year.  Anyone got a trampoline?

Think theme!

Subject: RE: Stats on meat and veggies..long
X-Mailer: <PC Eudora Version 1.4>
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

First, I want to say that the meat industry statistics were very 
interesting.  I'd read something similar before, but some of the 
things in this struck me as strange.  Now I take a couple of
humorous jabs, so don't anyone get mad, but...

   * Sacred food of Native Americans: Corn

Yeah, so?  The cross is a sacred symbol, but industrial punks across the
world will hardly be likely to give up their earrings anytime soon...

   * A driving force behind the destruction of the tropical rainforests:
     American meat habit

Mmm.  I've heard a lot of reasons for the demise of the rain forests, but 
the primary reason, as I understand it, is so land-starved farmers will
have someplace to put crops.

   * Amount of meat imported anually by U.S. from Costa Rica, El Salvador,
     Guatemala, Nicaragua, Honduras and Panama: Less than the average
     American housecat

Huh?  Do we import housecats from these countries or do housecats import
meat from these countries?  Or do we import meat that totals less than
the muscle on one housecat?  And who the heck out there is eating 
housecats?  And what about carcats?  Or tentcats?  Or dirtcats?  Don't
they count?

   * Current rate of species extinction due to destruction of tropical
     rainforests and related habitats: 1000/year

It's my understanding that scientists can't identify and cross reference
that many new species in a year.  Horrifying statistic, given that
number, but hardly provable.

   * Length of time world's petroleum reserves would last if all human
     beings ate meat-centered diet: 13 years
   * Length of time world's petroleum reserves would last if all human
     beings ate vegetarian diet: 260 years

More strange statistics.  I say we revoke those cows' driver's licenses
*immediately*!  Where exactly does all the petrol go, and how is it
that the cows are using 20 times the petroleum that the world's cars,
buses, trains, plastics industry, chemical industry, etc., are using
combined?  Don't they know *anything* about public transportation?

   * Percentage of raw materials consumed in U.S. for all purposes presently
     consumed to produce current meat-centered diet: 33

We expend a third of ALL our raw materials on cows?  Our wood, metals,
water, etc.?  Since the population of cows in this country is lower than
one third of the human population, I have to assume that these cows are 
wearing better clothes, driving better cars, living in better houses, 
typing on better computers, eating better food -- well, that actually
might be true -- in short, living better lives than we do.

   * Where feedlot waste often ends up: In our water

I thought that water tasted funny...

   * Milk Producer's revised campaign slogan: "Milk has something for
     everybody."

What happened to "Got Milk?"  I think we're dating these statistics 
here.

   * Part of female chicken's body that produces eggs: Ovaries

Whew!  That's a relief!  My cousin told me the egg fairy came around
every night, grabbed the poor sleeping chickens, and shoved the eggs 
up into them!  After hearing this latest development in the "Where Do
Eggs Come From" controversy, I for one will sleep better tonight!

   * Foods males in U.S. are conditioned to think of as "manly": Animal
     products

Depends on where you're from.  I knew a guy that claimed to have 
disassembled and consumed most of the parts of a VW Bug.  What a man!

   * The dye used for many years by the USDA for many years to stamp meats
     "Choice", "Prime", or "U.S. No. 1 USDA": Violet dye No. 1
   * Current status of Violet Dye No. 1: Banned as proven carcinogen

Do they still use it?  Probably not.  M&M's used to be made with red 
dye #4, but as soon as it was banned, they stopped.

   * McDonald's clown, Ronald McDonald, doesn't tell children: Hamburgers
     are ground up cows who've had their throats slit by machetes or their
     brains bashed in by sledgehammers.

Someone forgot electro-shock and pistol.  Sledgehammers 
aren't used anymore and the machete, or more accurately the cleaver, used 
to slit their throats is done after they're dead.

Y'know, lest anyone think I'm just taking a silly-minded swing at
vegans in general, let me just say that these statistics, at least 
the useful, non-inflammatory ones, are good to know and helpful in 
possibly making a decision to change one's diet.  I agree that people 
eat far too much meat, and I'm already trying to change the things I 
buy at the grocery store in order to taper off my meat consumption.

Y'know, you folx might want to watch this kinda of sentiment.  It speaks of 
ignorance, hatred, and discrimination.  This kind of comment, along with the 
vast assortment of references to inbreeding, stupidity, and slovenliness in 
regards to people from our southern states, is offensive to some.  You'd be 
surprised how many people on this list are from the South and proud.

Now you're probably sitting there thinking one of two things:

1. How can you be proud when there's still a lot of racism in the South?
2. Then why is it that every ignorant, gap-toothed weirdo on a television 
talk show seems to speak with a southern accent?

First, racism is everywhere in this country.  I'm not going to try to defend 
anyone that even so much as tells racist jokes, but don't put off racism on 
the South as though that's it's last bastion.

Second, there are just as many ignorant, gap-toothed weirdos here as there 
are there.  I won't name names, but there are some right in our own scene 
that astound me with their strange local form of ignorance and arrogance.

A Southern accent does not make you a bad person.

oh, well I should've chosen my words more carefully, but I didn't say
"southern," I just said "white trash hix." I hope no one's going to rise up
in defense of white trash...  ("white trash need our compassion! The low
ratings of the Jeff Foxworthy Show clearly show anti-white-trash
discrimination. The noble white trash once ranged free and unfettered
accross the continent, but now is limited to the 48 continuous United
States. The republicans are trying to take white trash off the endangered
species list? those NAZIS!" =)

I'm OK with the south.

I got problems with white trash.

big difference.

take care,

hey,

i just thought i'd point out re: how much grain it takes to raise a pound
of beef vs how many people that grain could feed... there is a *huge*
surplus of grain in this country, ask any farmer..the government has programs
that pay farmers not to plant certain grains and just leave the ground as
grass in order to keep the grain prices high enough for farmers to make a 
living..

i don't think many of the starving people in the world are starving because
the cows are eating their food, i guess is what i'm tryin to say :)


giving away too much of his past,

I have problems with them all (but not because they eat meat.)

Yea!  I finally finagled an e-mail account...So now I won't get any work 
done, but at least I can post using my own true identity.

P.S. Anyone need any more reasons to go veggie?!  Thanks Robert for that 
list!! It's a good reminder to all of us that our individual choices 
really can have an impact on the world...  I'm only a semi-veggie (white 
meat about once a week), but this thread has inspired me to make new 
choices more often!  :) :)

	Fact is, in order to survive, our bodies kill hordes of microbes every 
day.  Since they are probably a "higher" form of life than our individual cells, 
and since they outnumber the body itself, it seems like we all ought to kill 
ourselves and let the microbes feast.

	Exactly my point - I have no problems with someone choosing to be
vegetarian or vegan for health reasons (heck, I have no problem with people
being anything for any reason, as long as they do the same for others and
don't preach their "wisdom"), but to be vegetarian out of a misguided "meat
is exploitation" feeling shows an incomplete line of reasoning. If you
avoid eating or doing things because it hurts some other form of life,
you have to draw the line somewhere, and once you do you have set an
arbitrary standard, just as do people who eat cows and won't eat dogs or
humans. The line of "I won't eat cows or domestic animals or any kind of
meat" is no less wrong (or right) than the line of those who won't eat
fido but will eat bessy.
	The extreme of this would be the jainists, who won't hurt even
insects and so sweep the ground before them to make sure the insects have
safely been moved out of the way, and who avoid bathing because it may kill
lice or other nasties crawling on their bodies. And if you look at it,
even they have drawn an arbitrary line because they still kill plants, and
by even moving or existing kill organisms too small to be seen.

	Ultimately, being alive means that you must, by necessity, live at
the expense of other things which are alive. It is impossible for that NOT
to be so. And, IMHO, to be overly concerned about that which you are
impinging on is just a downward spiral which gets you nowhere. Just do
what you need to do to feel good about your life, and recognize others may
have different ideas no less "right" than your own.

> PS but then those damn microbes are carnivores, so fuck 'em.
	Omnivores - they eat anything they can digest, including their own.

Just a warning from someone who's had experience:  Be careful calling

nor are people being fed by the government telling farmers not to grow 
grains. 9o% energy is lost when you eat a cow that has eaten grain, 
compared to you eating grain. given that figure, if all of us turned 
vegetarian, there would be quite enough food for everyone, at which point 
meat could be reintroduced responsibly into our diets. thats given that 
everyone took responsibility for their human brothers and sisters, and 
our home - earth - but the world is just not that simple. people choose 
their right to consume meat over others rights to survive, and to support 
an industry which exploits and destroys *our* home, teh earth. theres 
nothing wrong with eating meat, but playing along with an inefficient 
system when alternate symbiotic ways are available, is downright selfish. 
currnetly it is nearly impossible to avoid 'playing along' but enough 
people are coming to terms with what has been happening, and the current 
state of the world, and this is a good thing - cuz enough people together 
can really make a difference. see you at burningman.

well .. try to find a place that will spend than amount of money on 
killing their cows.  it's not economical to kill them pleasantly just 
because we may find it discturbing.  as for raising em, that's what 
free-range is for ... again, not too economical if you're trying to feed 
a LOT of people but fine for the few that are willing to make the effort 
to look.

also, would you WANT to eat a cow after they'd shot it up with whatever?

but there are sugars in fruits and vegetables too, and caffiene will burn 
you out in the long run after giving you that short boost.  

also, one of the reasons ppl feel so tired after a meal of meat seems to
be that the body uses extra energy just to digest proteins.  speaking for
myself i NEVER get tired after a huge plate of veggies, but i do find i
get kinda stodgy if i've eaten meat, even if it's not a large amount.

Hee hee...i love it.  where i come from, getting called white trash is
something of a compliment.  

here's my fave "white trash" delikacies:

1.  velveeta and rotelle tomatoes

get you some velveeta.  melt it slowly in a pot.  then, you add the
chopped-up rotelle tomatoes that come with jalopenos.  

2.  lime jello with those little marshmellows and fruit cocktail.  mix in
some coolwhip for an extra flavor.

yum!

well, since vegan doesn't include fish, you are right in some respects.  
however HUGE numbers of people in Asia have subsisted on rice, fish, and 
vegetables with maybe the odd egg thrown in for thousands of years, and 
many people of Asian descent can't drink milk due to lactose intolerance.

I realize you specified third-world countries, but such large parts of
China qualify i figured that my observations still have merit. :)

Subject: long weekend, taping philosophy
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

can't keep up with you all, as I had a grand slam weekend of fnf, sunset,
and the two furthur shows in sacto & shoreline . . . then see these killer
threads

first, a brief weekend recap:

fnf -- my first.  More than lived up to the anticipation.
sunset -- lying drowsily on a blanket in the sun, feeling the bass under me :)
furthur at cal expo -- about 110 degrees.  Bring shade to Burning Man.
furthur/shoreline -- the past & future collide, old deadhead friends coming
out of the woodwork, new raver friends saying hello, everyone smiling at my
cookie monster/steal your face shirt  . . . the all-star jam of
Truckin'/Other One with about 20 people on stage (including Dead bassist
Phil Lesh), followed by an amazing White Rabbit (with Jorma Kaukonen & Jack
Casady of Hot Tuna of the original Airplane) rocked my soul . . . Remember
what the Doormouse said . . .

the mixtape thread perks up this Deadhead most.  I agree with
Tim/Knucklehead that it should be up to the DJ whether her tape is copied &
distributed freely, and give 50 bonus karma points to Joe Rice for feeling
similarly.  I love listening to music while traveling, and can conjure up
those images listening to the same tapes later . . . and love hearing tapes
of Dead shows & raves I've been to more than other tapes for the same
reason.  I'm glad to hear that Joe is interested in the stories of his
tapes -- copies getting passed around acquire a life of their own.

It was great that the Dead allowed audience taping, and that philosophy
helped them a little to spread their music and attract enough fans so that
they didn't worry about money from record sales, but only from the live
shows.  I would love it if everyone shared the view that copying some tapes
is ok, but understand why this isn't the case.  We need to support the DJs
-- some need that support in the form of tape sales.  Others need it in
other ways and won't care if some tapes are freely traded.

The irony is that when it comes to "bands" I'll trade bootleg live shows
freely, 'cause most people who get into bootlegs have already bought most
are all of an act's official releases.  The same isn't the case for DJs,
although people who enjoy a particular DJ and make a point of seeing her
have spent money for parties that sometimes makes its way to the DJ.  One
thing about the raving community that I love is the lack of separation
between "artist" and "audience" -- we are all both and neither at the same
time -- so I feel a lot more responsibility to the DJs than to bands whose
members I'll never speak to . . .

about recording quality -- how good are the tapes that are sold at stores
or at raves?  The DATs I've heard from parties are great, and despite Paul
Anthony Rose's scoffing at 2nd & 3rd gen Dead tapes, I believe that a few
people with the right equipment using good quality analog tapes could
spread tapes out, but only if DJs consent and people are organized.  "Tape
trees" work, and I'd be willing to help with some of the organizing.  The
real limiting factor for most people listening to music away from parties
isn't tape decks, but speakers and amplifiers . . .

so if any DJs are willing to have their tapes spread via sfr, it can be
done . . . maybe a group donation from people who get the tapes to
hyperreal will absolve us of our copyright abuse sins . . .

peace, love & tapes!

FEED YOUR HEAD!

Food for thought:

Did you know that since 1960 more than 25% of Central America's forests have
been cleared for raising cattle and that for each hamburger rquires the
clearing of 6 square yards? One-third of all the carbon dioxide put into the
atmosphere comes from the burning of the forests to make more room for
cattle. Seventy percent of all U.S. grain production goes towards feeding
cattle along with all the energy burned by farm equipment and
transportation. It takes a gallon of gasoline to produce a pound of beef.

        Well, folks, I seem to have just this minute become embroiled
        in a bit of a mess.  A while back I happened across a funny
        bit of text called "The Tao of Programming".  I found it online
        and asked the owner of the page if I could make a copy.  He
        said yes, so I put a copy on my page and added a link from my
        main page to this copied page.  

        And I looked upon the page, and saw that it was good.

        That was over 8 months ago.  I just received the following
        message:

        Irritable little chap, isn't he?  Well, I guess I'll be taking
        it down.  Lords knows, I wouldn't want Infobook angry with me
        (shiver), much less incur the awesome wrath of one 
        John L. Joseph.  I'll leave it up one more day though so that 
        anyone that wants a little chuckle can check it out...

I just did a search and found over 1000 references to the "Tao of

Never fear john,
        This year there will bve a special "rave camp" a.k.a. the Techno Ghetto
which will be 2 miles outside of the main camp. There will be at least 6
sound systems  present. the camp will have a 1/4 perimiter within which
people can camp, there will also be porta-potties.  Around this 1/4 in
diameter perimiter
the sound systems will be located, some of the louder sound systems like the
Purple people pusher my be deployed on a vector further out from the camp.
The camp might also have it's on Internet feed if I can get someone to loan us
a pair of spread spectrum modems so that we can bridge a 56K link from the
main camp.  The Wicked will be having a large scaffolding structure complete
with lights and such supplied by Dimension 7.  The rave camp will have it's own 
rave rangers including your's truly Sub Commander Lycos :)

just a little ol' test email to see if my Eudora's *finally* working
properly once again.  What a pain to have to cut & paste every message I
want to respond to from eudora into netcom to reply & send.  Yuck!  Good to
be back again, once again not knowing where I am.

Love
Shawna

            
          Do not go gently into that good night!
         Rave! Rave into the dawning of the light!

Right on T!

I hate the term white trash.  I remember a melanin challenged friend of
mine equated it to that OTHER word, you know, the mark fuhrman word, you
know, the N word.  Yep, same thing, another way to objectify and dehumanize
people.

I guess some will always have a need to use such words to elevate
themselves at the expense of others.

Whatever, this planet needs a...break.

Save the rationalizations and explanations.  Been there, heard that, AND
it's still stupid.

Later.  I can say this, I've met more country ass MF's here in California
than I ever met in my home state of Florida.  At least in Florida you
always know where you stand...more than I can say for many other places,
Cali included.

They certainly are delicious.  And there is little we can't eat.

Insects to higher order mammals. Nothing eats like a human.
(or kills like one, a predator gone amok).

Oh, the delights of being at the top of the food chain.


Yummy!

:)

Right on T!

I hate the term white trash.  I remember a melanin challenged friend of
mine equated it to that OTHER word, you know, the mark fuhrman word, you
know, the N word.  Yep, same thing, another way to objectify and dehumanize
people.

I guess some will always have a need to use such words to elevate
themselves at the expense of others.

Whatever, this planet needs a...break.

Save the rationalizations and explanations.  Been there, heard that, AND

Hi everybody,

This is not really rave-related..but you are all such an awesome group
that I thought you could me help me out with this...

Does anybody know of any web sites dedicated to collecting and posting
dreams?  I mean the kind you have when you're asleep!

According to Iriquois tradition, dreams can tell you about
medicines.  Supposedly the healers know which plants to use to treat
illness because somebody dreamed about them.  

Native traditions often have parallels in our high-tech world.  Case in
point: Sterling's collection of short stories "Globalhead" and other
cyberpunky stories.  But I'm looking for closer analogies than dreams in
fiction.  I'm interested in hearing about dreams that told somebody how to
do something new.

Another thing:  can anybody point me to whatever Francis Crick has written
about dreams?  And also a good review of the current status of dream
research?   

Yes, I should be sleeping,

Ann

Good day,

Sounds like this was alot of fun.  Sometimes I really hate living in the valley; like when it
hits 107 degrees and I have to go outside and prepare my motorcycle for sale.

Aargh!

Take care,
                    Jason

Good day,

>Most of the interview focused on crunch's former life as a, um, telecommunications 
>expert :) People were calling in from all over the country to talk to the legendary capt. crunch.... 

This name is a total blast from the past.  I had no idea that the Crunchman was the infamous
Capt. Crunch.  

My salute to you, as you helped inspire many adolescents to consider telecommunications
as a "hobby".  All fun and games until the feds came knocking on my friends door
and carted away his beloved computer.  It was time to get out before I could be 
prosecuted as an adult.  But the friendships I forged then are still with me today.
Thank you Ma Bell.  heh heh heh

Take care,
                    Jason

> Anthony Rose's scoffing at 2nd & 3rd gen Dead tapes, 

hey...dont make it personal...I guess I should have added IMHO... have
dead tapes that I still listen to (acid jam '68), despite the sound
quality, the vibe and feeling from the music can still be felt... what is
better than driving 8 or morehours to a show listening to the dead on a
crappy box with your friends?  but I cant really say that  techno/house
can carry the same feeling for me over the loss of sound quality usually
associated with 3 or more generations. unless of course you are dealing
with dat...or some really good recording equipment.
	I have had beatiful moments with one of my brothers listening to
great house/techno  music and copied the tape only to be
dissapointed that it wasn't really the same. Although I still listen to
the tape when I get that feeling...there is something missing.
	now...to move on...i would definately copy soemones original
mix-tape, maybe 2nd gen mix-tape...and BUY a mixtape for under 12
bucks...and I feel that nost of the people that show up to (uhhh out on a
limb here) cool parties feel the same way...I am still trying to think a a
cool/(organizationally uncomplicated) way to spread mixtapes so that
1. DJ's that are worried about it can make some cash
2. make it easier for people to hear new music 

of course DJ's will get exposure for any of this...

me too...

shooooot....forget that...why not keep it underground as a list...once a
week or something like that a list comes out to sfraves with tapes
available and people can order them from maybe a rotating address or
something...

Well, I'll be bringing my beast of a BBQ to Burning Man hopefully. I think
this will be alot of fun. So if you want to use it, look for me I should be
at VW Camp or whatever there calling it...Vince and Wayne..The VMAR truck
and all that. One note though, I'm not going to be hovering over it like I
do at the BBQ&BEATS so you want something you cook it. If I happen to be
there I'll keep and eye on it, but I won't take responsiblity if you come
back after a while and find your food black as coal if I'm not around. If
you can find Heat resistant paint, I might even let people paint things on
it.

See ya all at Chrysallis

Hey, man...
I've thought of this one before, but it's a no go.  You can only have 3 watts of amplification before the FCC comes down on your ass.  3 watts equals about a 2 mile radius.  There's a station here in San Jose, but 2 miles?  What's the point?  A whole 20 people, MAYBE, could pick it up.  You know what sucks though?  LA has thier own dance music station - run and funded by Moonshine Records.  They play a wide variety of dance - EVERYTHING.  NO GRUNGE!  WOO HOO!  Sure, there's bad dance music, but there's also A WHOLE LOT of good dance music.  The concept itself rocks.  Maybe someday.
I think we've all have secret Pump Up The Volume fantasies....

hello world!  i hope your day is treating you well (you need to treat it

why?  1)i went out dancing with sarah aberant to natural last night, and
that was fun,  2)my roommate, who was studying for the bar exam, is now gone
(try living with someone studying for the bar.  good, dont!), 3) i'm looking
foreward to dinner with friends both tonight and tomorrow night, and
4)chrysalis!

so, other than that, i have ABSOLUTELY nothing to be happy about!  love to

Well, I have two friends in from out of town and I will be taking them to
their first rave experience this weekend.  Don't know yet what I'll be 
wearing except for my hat.  One of my friends brought in 2 white navy hats. 
I'll probably be wearing one of those and he'll probably be wearing the other.
He'll be the taller of the 2 of us.

cya there

Hi there everyone! I have been lurking on SFraves for over a year and a half
now and I post privately to most of you, but now I have a question for the
whole group. I am trying to see if anyone knows a rave promoter named Nikki.
I have been stopped at Friends and Family parties and Sunset parties  by
people saying "Hi Nikki". This has happened more than a few times now and I'm
just wondering if we look a lot alike. I was the person in the flourescent
dress at Friends and Family hanging out with Amy Starkey's group. Does anyone
know Nikki and does anyone have a picture of her? Just curious to see if I
have a twin out there.

 This description of "jainists" should really be "jain mahrajis", or jain
 monks or nuns.  Sorry to be picky, but it seems like every person who
 ever talks about jainism always refers to EVERY JAIN as being the way you
 described above (it would be nice if it were true, but it's not).  It's
 like saying that ALL christians don't ever curse or have sex, 
 if that gives you some perspective.  Like you said, everyone draws that line
 somewhere.  Jainism, however, doesn't "arbitrarily" draw it (if you look
 upon the definition of arbitrary to be "selected at random and without
 reason" as defined in Webster's...there is a reason for that line; 
 it has to do with the fundamental belief of AHIMSA (nonviolence)and 
 how many souls and senses there are in a life form.
 Jains believe that the least you can do with, and the less you can hurt,
 the better off everything is.  So yes, there is a hierarchy of the senses
 and of souls in the view of jainism.  I'm just trying to explain that
 this line is not drawn arbitrarily, as you so described; whether one
 agrees with the line of reasoning is a different story altogether :)
 Also, in the way you have described the jain monk/nun above, you are
 wrong, they avoid most all plants, and live on grains like rice and
 dropped fruit...they specifically avoid green leafy vegetables, potatoes,
 onions, garlic...etc...for the reasons i have described above..

 Well said, I guess the only fuzzy line is what is "overly concerned" ;^)

Good day,

Lot and lots and lots and lots of water.  If you don't drink it, you'll want to get clean 
with it.  RVs are great if you can aford one.  Alot of us took shelter in Brian M.'s
last year during the Saturday afternoon's high winds.  A rented van would be a cool 
haven also, no tent to take up or down.  

Take care, 
                     Jason

Good day,

After a few days, we finally had our tarp tied and staked well.  It was the tarp's eyelets 
that began to tear away that promted us to take it down on Saturday afternoon and
not bother after that.  The small canopy style sun tents that you often see at outdoor 
raves, over the DJ,  seemed to be the most durable when the wind kicked up in the late 
afternoon.

Take care,
                     Jason

>>I have a picture with you lying on the ground outside at the party, Jason. Your smile

Are my eyes open or closed?  I spent about an hour with them closed, just listening to 
the music and mix of jumbled and distorted (me) conversations going on about  :)

Take care,

P.S. Can't wait to get a computer that is web-graphics friendly, I want to see some of 
these pictures that people keep taking :)

Yeah, and if I have to listen to 2Unlimited one more time, I'll smash that
radio, even if it does mean ruining a perfectly good dashboard.

Groove Radio still sucks. Maybe it'll get better, but for now it plays the
lamest vocal techno and salsa house possible. Not to mention Snoop Dogg
every hour on the hour. Why, Swedish Egil, why? Oh, and any involvement by
Moonshine (like *that* would improve things?) is only peripheral. They
wouldn't have that kind of money anyway.

Literally, any one transmitter can only have 3 watts.  To get around that 
you could have multiple transmitters.  How serious are you?

  A friend of mine from back in Ottawa just wrote to me.  Apparently
Ottawa is starting to have a problem with nitrous (and an especially large
problem because people are *really* uninformed about it).  He said he'd
heard of a campaign down here (in the Bay Area), of flyering raves with
nitrous information, called "No Nitrous".  I've never seen any such
flyers, so if anyone can tell me more about this, I'd really appreciate
it.
  Thanks...

yah, dance radio stations kinda suck. there was one in Toronto called Energy

Sorry this is a little late, it's been a tough week :).   Chrysalis 
ought to be good for Saturday, and the Juggernaut Festival has a huge
lineup and should be a juggernaut.  In the weeklies, MAD has returned
to Bahia, and Hedquarters is supposed to be nice; and Mission Rock
seems to be hosting more events for the summer.

Between work and travel, I haven't been keeping up with the sfraves
mail, so please send me mail directly if you have updates for the
calendar.  Thanks!  I'll be at Siggraph next week but I should be able
to send the calendar from New Orleans :).

	They have their work cut out for them...  here are a couple more URL's:

	I spent all of 10 minutes looking for those -- 2 in Sweden, 1 in 
Germany, 1 in Austria and 1 in the US.  I also found some deadends on Excite, 
meaning they are making an effort, but I think they'll end up spending more on 
lawyers than they lose in book sales if they go international.

	Sure this is rave-related -- its just like the labels trying to restrict 
mixtapes, right?

     Hey all,
     
     Does anybody know where I can pick up a copy of this ?? Have been 
     looking (in vain) for a while & am about to special order it if 
     necessary. Any pointers would be appreciated !!
     
     TITLE: AUNTIE AUBREY'S EXCURSIONS BEYOND THE CALL OF DUTY - THE ORB 
     REMIX 
     PROJECT
     RELEASED BY: DEVIANT RECORDS (e-mail deviant@volume.demon.co.uk) CAT 
     NO: DVNT12CD (for the CD)
     
     Also, while I'm here ....
     
     Trainspotting Review : Go and see it !! 
     Not as ravey (?) as it could have been but well worth a looksee none 
     the less. Powerful & funny. 
     Brw: (By ra' way) the subtitles in the Volcano club scene were in the 
     original - not added for US consumption !!
     BrwII: The Volcano is actually a dodgy wee club in Glasgow. Sweatbox !
     
     Amusing story : Met a lady in the bar after seeing the above. She had 
     intended seeing it as well but was thwarted in her ambitions by a 
     dearth of available viewing situations (sold out). Turns out this was 
     the *third* successive day she'd gone to see it and met a similar 
     fate. Hello ?? Is there anybody home ?? I suggested an earlier arrival 
     time for the next day. She seemed quite happy with this advice.
     
     I have some friends visiting from Scotland so will hopefully be 
     hitting Chrysalis tommorrow (they may want to be Juggernauted). CU 
     there.
     
     Why don't you give the next person you see a big smile ? Have a great 
     weekend & stay safe !!

I just found out today that I might not get the days off to goto BM
28,29,30 and if I don't go those days I will not be going at all. I just
can't justify the drive up there for 1 1/2 days if I can't get weds-fri
off. My supervisor will let me know Monday if we can work it. This is all I
need, to be stressed over the weekend. This sucks! I was in a good mood

So, we have a show sent out over the net with a handful of interested
people who tie this into their 3 watts transmitter and brodcast it in
their little area.  Given enough interested people we could have most
of the bay area covered.  Hell, we could have pockets of coverage all
over the world, then we begin sending a subliminal ...

Hear that hissing?  It's the sound of another powderkeg about to go off... ;)
     
- E
     
     
     Oh... I thought it was my tank leaking (just kidding!).
     
     Do what you wanna do.  I just wonder why the hell people do it at 
     raves because you almost always end up with a headache, it drains your 
     energy, and it's not conducive to dancing, meeting people, or the all 
     nite journey sensation that for me goes along with rave-type partying. 
      It's not a social drug, rather an intense but VERY short personal 
     voyage.  It also fucks up the scene, because :
     
     A. The tanks/balloons are really visible
     B. The people falling on their faces as they let go of their balloons 
     make it look really dangerous.
     C. Lines of people jonesing for another hit of "hippie crack"
     D. That low voice when you exhale is too comic.
     E. Too much money to be made to stay sane.  I've seen people make 
     hundreds or even thousands of dollars off of a 30 pound tank.  I heard 
     that at a FMG event down south that a nitrous dealer pulled a gun the 
     guy who politely asked them to leave... I won't even get into that.
     F. I've seen more people 'fishout' (black out and go into spasms) from 
     nitrous than any other drug.
     G. If Officer Eager pulls you over with a tank, you can't eat the 
     stash.
     H. Too much nitrous being sold out there is NOT medical grade.
     I. Cops have been getting a bigger and bigger hard-on for nitrous 
     dealers as people die.  In LA just before I moved, two kids died from 
     lack of oxygen sitting in a car with the windows rolled up and a tank 
     with the valve left open.  I don't know whether to say "pity", or 
     "duh".  I guess I'll say both.  I feel sorry for everybody involved on 
     that one... imagine how much the cop who found them dead and blue must 
     love finding nitrous dealers.  Probably thinks it was a nitrous 
     overdose rather than an oxygen underdose.
     
     I feel it should be kept away from raves, and despite some really cool 
     effort from promoters and the general population, the only way to keep 
     it out is to not buy it if you see it anywhere at a rave.

There are tons of stations playing good music!!!!!
My school, Foothill College KFJC 89.7 FM in Los Altos Hills is always
playing progressive music.  Friday nights Mr. Goodwrench plays the best new
techno,
jungle, acid house, and anything else he feels like from 10-2am.  He can't
beat match for shit but he's got incredible taste.  They have parties up
there all the time, in classrooms even!!  Mix Master Morris was interviewed
on air last time he was here.  If you can get it in on your radio it is
definitely worth checking out.

Other stations:
Stanford University 90.1  (mostly dub and hip-hop but there is variety)
San Jose State 90.5  (Monday mornings are great)
Bereklely 90.7

Hope this has been a little helpful.

Is Chrysalis going to be indoors or outdoors this weekend?  I really love
the Plurry vibe at Gateway's parties... but I kinda want to go to a huge
Massive at least once this summer.. (besides BM if I make it..)

Who's going to Juggernaut?

Sunset is having a boat party this weekend right?  Is anyone going? I think
$20 is kinda steep for a Sunday event.. but they have to rent the boat.

HAVE A GREAT WEEKEND!!

PLUR,
Aaron.

You should be careful before you label ANYONE.  Like I've said before, it 
is an easy way to box someone in a category, and then dismiss them.  You 
cease to look at the individual.

Michal, you might be surprised that I spent 18 years of my life growing 
up with what you might call "white trash."  Hey, I'm the first person to 
crack jokes about where I am from, town of 60 people, gun racks, Ford 
trucks and all.  Yeah, lots of people are ignorant and racist from where I'm 
from.  But my family lives there, it is a beautiful place, and it is a 
part of me.  You know me, know how I am.  Would you box me into that 
category?  I doubt it.  So, just be careful about "who you got problems 
with!"  (but, if you want to hear some good, funny stories about 
hickville, just ask.  There's plenty to fill 10 stereotypes!!:)

much respect,
KaySEE

Well,

I don't think I want 2 B @ Planet-E (or, is that Club-E) nor the Cannery
(ends @ 4AM) tonight.  So what's the real 411?  Anything else worthwhile
tonight or am I just going to stay home and have an imaginary rave while I
mix???

Ok, I'm convinced!  Thanks everyone who took time to recommend a party 
this weekend.  I've got a friend in town, and we're coming to Chrysalis, 
then to the boat party on Saturday with some other friends.  I'd love to 
meet more sfravers!  I don't know what I'll be wearing, cept I have 
fairly long brown hair and gold round glasses.  I'm 6' and I'll be with 
my buddy Susan who's about 5'6" with long dark hair.

Please come say high!  ;)

> instead of clearcutting forests for cattle, plant hemp?

	Nice thought, but any time you replace a native forest with a
non-native weed you are doing just about as much good as clear cutting to
plant grass to feed cattle except you get a plant that is somewhat more
useful (you will of course be pulling more nutrients out of the soil
becaue you can use the whole hemp plant and not be leaving shit behind to
enrich the soil).
	Anytime you actually move resources away from where they are, you
are greatly changing the balance of an ecosystem. Hopefully, everything
including ourselves will be able to adapt to whatever is left...

It's just out the past week or so - for stuff like this your best bet is
Mod Lang in Berkeley, on University between Shattuck and Oxford. Or try
Rasputin's (who've just hired Markus of Hedquarters as their techno buyer
which is a good sign)

Dear All;

        Yeah, yeah, I get no respect, no respect I'll tell ya. I was sitting
@ Thursdaze last night, good crowd kinda young, but good never the less.
This guy comes walking up to me and starts talking to me. In the
conversation he basically told me that he felt that I was stuck up, because
I kinda hung out by myself and didn't really talk with anyone; no respect
what did I tell you. 

        Well my response to him was, yeah I'm either stuck up, or I'm
sitting on something soooooo good that I don't want to tell anyone about it,
or share for that matter. Well, I immediately got his attention and we
talked a little more and he left feeling good, as well as me. 

        Ya know ya never know, when you see that shy person in the corner,
are they shy?, are they famous?, are they stuck up?, or are they totally
hooked up and protecting themselves from all da sharks out there? ; you
never know until you ask, it's just your imagination until then no matter
how clear something may appear to you.

        We spend a lot of time up in our imaginations. In massage school my
classmates and I did a lot of work on this very thing. It's a simple
exercise, called I observe, I imagine. Observations are whatever you see,
smell, feel ...etc the senses, your IMAGINATION is what you do with that data. 

        Ok here's an example, your sitting on the bus across from an old
man. You see the man rubbing his face, and you say I observe him
rubbing/scratching his face, I imagine his faces itches. But until you
actually go up and ask him, no matter how sure you are what he is doing, YOU
JUST DON'T KNOW, it's in your IMAGINATION.

        Try this with a friend, sit across from each other and take turns
observing the other person, and try and guess. But you will find all you are
doing is guessing, because we can't read other peoples minds, though often
including myself are very guilty of this.

        Thought for food, peace and see ya at Nikita Tonight.

Peace
Brian

You can't really say if people were meant to eat meat, or vegetables. We do
what we do. Do you think the early cavepeople played loud dance music and
danced around till the wee hours of the morning, do you think that they
occasionally indulged in E, Acid, or whatever else. People can do whatever
they want. We weren't MEANT for anything, that's why we're sooooo versatile,
so we have choices in our paths. Right????

projection, or intention?
that is the question.
although you really cannot be sure, i have experienced many times things 
that i can only call psychic experiences, and im sure the others sharing 
this would concurr.
i mean, among like minded, open people under the right circumstances, 
enough empathy is generated as to produce a like or group mind, where, 
well, im not totally sure of this, but it felt like we all were really 
aware of what the others were feeling/thinking, and that my *projections* 
were indeed programming to an extent the others' intentiions, etc. and 
although we all never said anything, im sure we were all mutually aware.

little catch, you must dress up as an EVIL DO'ER. I will entertain bringing
along those boring people who refuse to dress up. I'm going in full bondage

music & artwork will be diversified, so lots of everything. Call before
10pm, as I will starting calli you back with the details after that.

Peace

Hi all!

 Here's the deal: I need a ride to SF (from Santa Cruz). In return I can 
get one (maybe two) people in to Juggernaught for free if they are 
willing to help set up (tear down help would be nice also). We should be 
in SF at noon on Saturday. Ideally I would like to take up some 
equipment, not too much - mostly slide projectors and exstension cords. 
So a big vehicle is not essiential (some room would be good, an empty trunk?)


 Please call or write ASAP if interested: first come, first served.


I hope everyone's weekend is simply fabulous, =)


Ran

Wow, thank god and thank you, I thought I had dropped into the twilight

you to be vegetarian (duh! really?), and then going off on poor white trash
(allow me to introduce you to my 10th generation Tennessee hillbilly family
sometime) ...

but finally, something worth thinking and talking about!  Hoooeeeyy!!

I was doing fine until I got to here ....

  Okay, I checked with a number of people on this.  No one was too sure
about the maximum power of a transmitter allowable for unlicensed
broadcasts.  However - there is currently a gray area, wherein you can
work.  Here's the story:
  The FCC won't accept license applications for under 100watt stations.
So when they tried to go after Free Radio Berkeley, the court ruled in
favour of FRB, saying the FCC couldn't go after smaller broadcasters
unless they were given the chance to broadcast with a license.
  Thus, you have a legal precedent for running a pirate radio station of
up to 100watts (approx 1 mile per watt, roughly) without getting in
trouble.  If on the other hand you choose to broadcast illegal or
particularily subversive material, you might be in a different sort of
trouble.  On the other hand, for a music station, the precedent might hold
up well.
  Also (I am told, by folks experienced in the field), there are almost
never jail terms for illegal broadcasters.  Usually just an equipment
confiscation, sometimes as much as a fine.
  Interesting stuff...
  (BTW this is all FM.  I know zip about AM.)

Dear All;

        Nitrous has been linked to sterility in young adult male, & female
persons. Repeated long term exposure to this gas has a VERY HIGH PROBABILITY
OF MAKING THE RECIPIENTS STERILE.  Ask your dentist if you doubt my words.
There is an especially high risk for people, like dental assistants who are
PASSIVELY around the gas in the work place.

        I will pose the ? if there is a very high risk for people who are
just PASSIVELY around the gas; what is the risk involved for those actively
breathing it over long periods of time? Especially low grade
gas(non-medical; not fit for human consumption) usually found at raves &
Grateful Dead concerts.

Peace
Brian

ps Sorry to burst your balloon, pun intended

Hi all!

 Well, a ride came through (again!) at the last minute and it looks like 
I'll be helping the Mantra crew at Juggernaught. YIPPEE!!! =) I really 
hope all is well for everyone and that everyone has a smashing good time 
tonight.

 For future thought; I may be in this same situation (needing a ride for 
me and some equipment) every weekend until the end of summer (and 
longer?) at least until I buy my own vehicle (soon oh soon). Driver of 
course gets in free but will usually need to provide some assistance 
setting up. A ride back to Santa Cruz the next day is pretty key also. If 
anyone is interested please contact me. Vehicle should be a van, truck 
with shell or similar. I'm very flexible and the perks can be interesting.
 


May the dance floor rise to greet your feet,



Ran

Hi All,

I just got the good news that I have to go to New York, starting next 
weekend, for a business trip. I'll be there from Saturday, August 10, 
through Wednesday, August 14. Now, here's the OBRave: do any of you have 
suggestions for must-go-to parties, clubs, shops, restaurants, galleries, 
etc.? I'd really love to see the scene there...any ideas you have would be 
very much appreciated.

Thanks.

:)
Kathryn

I lived in VA for 5 1/2 years (came there as an exchange student last 
year of high school).  That year we had a cop come to school and talk 
about different laws.  Not having sex before marriage was one of the 
topics (also any other position but missionary is illegal as well in VA).

The reason they still have those laws is because it would cost them too 
much money to change them...  Nobody gives you tickets or anything like 
that.  In college the health center gives away free condoms and they put 
you on the pill no problem.  So, it's just one of those silly laws.

Just wanted to inform ppl who thought that was an inforced law :).

Hugz - see some of you at Chrysalis.

Yes, I am saying that being a vegiterian diet is un-healthy.
  We, as a race 
were concdieved as meateaters (which includes fish and sea-food) 
therefore we need meat.  It's a bit like asking a lion to go vegan.  
There is countless fossil evidence, going as far back as Lucy, that shows 
that how we survuved on the 
plains was by using our hands to use a stone to hit the bones of dead 
animals and extracting the marrow from it.  Sure we eat plants and fruits 
as well but meat was the main stapple of our  of our diet.  Haven't you 
ever seen 
2001? Man learned (or was taught, depending on how you want to look at 
it)  to kill, he eat what he killed and he survived and we are here 
today.  Then one day, about thirty years ago, some brilliant person came up 
with the idea that there was a whole untapped market out their and called 
it vegerterianism.  It was a real winner: the emerging psuedo left-wing 
group were lining up for shit like this because at last they had found 
something that was truely alternative.  All these people had to do was 
find a few obscure, but prominet scientists to back up their claims, 
shoow examples of the very few cults around the world that do not 
(which is not to say they don't eat meat) kill and 
wallah! The industry that was vegiterianism was born making billions and 
billions every year selling us stuff that we don't really need.  And 
we've fallen for it and should know better.

I seem to remember mail to your account had been bouncing for a few
days....

For the record, the only time I (the list admin) remove people is when
mail starts bouncing from their site, and bounces more than just a couple
of times.  Because this list is so high volume and thus the amount of
"bounce" messages are likewise so high, my tolerance is somewhat low for
system problems and such... and I also don't save bounce messages so I
can't show you why you were unsub'd.  The most common occurances I see are
full mailboxes - aol and netcruiser people are particularly guilty. :)

Anyways, just remember to never take accidental unsubscribing personally;
if you go so much as a day without mail you should figure something might
be wrong.  :)

Sorry for the delay... I'm cc'ing this to SFRaves since the discussion
never seemed to close there.

I would be comfortable with having hyperreal host a page and a CGI script
or two whose purpose was to allow DJ's to post information about tapes
they are willing to sell to the public; but I'm not quite ready to create
a mixtape area where people who buy DJ tapes can connect to copy those
tapes with others.  I'm fine if it happens informally on the list, I can't
really control that and wouldn't want to anyways, but formally hosting a
service like that I'm sure would put me in hot water, if not with the
copyright police than at least with other DJ's.  

Those are my thoughts...

	Brian

Decided last night to venture out into the real world, see how others 
spend their weekend party nights.  So, with some NRR friends, I trekked 
out to the mythologized "Triangle" area of San Francisco.  I had heard 
that there were "cool bars" along this stretch of Union Street, with lots of 
young people, all smashed as hell and happy.

Friday night, already drinking as the sun goes down.  A few more beers 
and we were ready to hit the scene.  Now, I know alcohol is controversial 
in some rave quarters, and I think we're all pretty much in agreement as 
to the effect widespread drinking would have on our scene, but going out 
drinking with friends can be a _total_ blast.


However, there must be cooler bar scenes than this, especially in San 
Francisco!  Okay, I'm pretty prejudiced, but the Triangle looks like the 
Gap exploded.  It's where ex-Greeks go to die.  Everyone was young, 
white, Marina district aspiring yuppies, overdressed in overpriced clothes, 
and eyeing everyone else.  The bars screamed with the noise of dozens of drunk people; people pushed 
passed others roughly; if you met anyone's eyes it was a come-on.  Forget 
smiling, unless you want to go home with someone.

A good friend of mine, a non-raver, bar junkie, said to me that the key 
was just to stay with your group, having a great time with them, and 
ignore the crowd and scene around you.  That sort of statement comes as a 
shock to me, after two years raving.  I _expect_ differently, even out in 
the world, even in a pick-up bar.  I wanted to connect with the people 
there, have a mutual experience, even just some friendly vibes, but in this 
context connection is only for the purpose of hooking up.  And that's 
cool if that's what someone wants, but to consider the Triangle and the 
adventures it offers as fun for a typical Friday night - the prospect of 
that as one's usual party plans is too depressing for me!

By 12 we were super-smashed, and wanted to dance.  Along the way we found 
Pierce Street Annex.  A two-dollar cover got us into a packed bar with a 
teeny, packed dance floor.  Worn-out hip-hop blared - Tone Loc, 2 Live 
Crew - interspersed with some 70's disco.  The music, so familiar to me, 
just sounded dead.  No innovation, nothing new and creative and 
stimulating.  For the Union Street party crowd they spun played-out 
music, and it was like something stale and lifeless.  It was hard to 
dance to (I'm used to just a little faster BPM!), but the couples on the 
floor (ONLY couples dancing!!) just swayed, hands grabbing at each 
other.  The low point for me was when the sexist song, "you ain't 
nothin but a hootchie mama" came on.  Telling women you're worth nothing, 
except perhaps if you're sexually attractive to the pig screaming out the 
mysoginistic lyrics (whose own attractiveness to you is immaterial).  
When it came on a great cheer of delight went up from the crowd, and 
everyone (including enthusiastic women) screamed along with the words.  
Whew.

All-in-all, though, a great night with fun had by all, each in their own 
worlds of their own friends, mate, or hook-up of the evening.  My friends and 
I were going _off_.  But this great individual fun all takes place in one of 
the strangest atmospheres I've ever been in.  And what made it all the 
stranger was that no-one else seemed to find it strange!


Woke up with a hang-over :P.  It is weighing on my head as I contemplate 
heading out to Chrysalis tonight.  Raving to me is special, and with so 
many fucking great parties that I couldn't miss, I've just been doing too 
much of it lately!  But the dissatisfactions of last night (especially 
dancing!) left a yearning for a redemption of this week-end...But who 
knows, maybe a good night's sleep will be it.


Perhaps see you all tonight?!  If I do go, I'll wear my SFR laminate, and 
some silly get-up. :)  Have wonderful fun whatever you do!!


Peace, 
Nancy

Derek, you should have known better than to use a word like "svbscribe"
without replacing the "u" with a "v".  :)

Subject: Request for calendar info


Hi everyone,

After more than four years on sfraves, and getting 1500 messages behind,
I've had to unsvbscribe from the main list.  I'm going to be out of
town for a week and really busy at work in the near future, so I don't
think I'll be able to catch up.  When things let up I may be able to
resvbscribe.

Anyway, I will still maintain the calendar, but I need a volunteer to
forward event info from sfraves to me (at dhchung@hyperreal.com).  I
get a lot of info from other people via email already, and other stuff
from flyers, but there are still a few events a week which get posted
to sfraves but don't get sent to me directly.

Sometime in the near future I'm also going to have a form on the web
for entering events, or work on integrating with GRID on hyperreal.

So are there any volunteers?  The volunteer should be someone who
keeps up with sfraves and doesn't get way behind like I have been.

Thanks,

Derek

It seems to me unless the DJ gets permission (to redistribute for a
profit) for all the songs they have on their tape, they're breaking
copyright law by selling those tapes whereas anybody who has such a
tape and trades with another is doing no worse (and possible doing
not as bad since they're not making a profit--of course the owners
of the copyright might be as unhappy about it).

The problem you describe is only an issue when the DJ has all the
appropriate permissions (the rarity I believe), they then are protected
and trading their tapes might not be cosher.

Of course, if the purpose of these tapes is for promotion and not
profit then people trading tapes should be looked upon favourably.  If,
on the other hand, the DJs are looking to make a profit with all this,
they should be getting all the appropriate permissions and shouldn't be
writing for promotion only on their tapes.

Merely my take on the legality of such--I'm all for a location to buy,
sell, trade all of the above.

Hey all! 

Definitely weird to be typing this out from what *looks* like my account,
but it's really Matt's account, cleverly disguised!  Well it's soon time for
Chrysalis, hope to see many of you there.  Look for me in my Silver outfit,
and I've dragged out my bright green feather boa! (thanks for reminding me
of my boa, Nancy!)  Wheeee!  Anyway, I'm sitting here in SF getting ready to
go, really looking forward to it.

And that's about it!  If you see me come say hi!  I'll be there with Matt
Lanier.

Love,
Shawna

The River would like to thank the really nice group of people who came
out to Pt Molate for "Shine" - it was really an exceptional group of
open hearted individuals

Special thanks to David for sharing his exceptional sound system with us

Amazingly, there wasn't a scrap of garbage left behind.

Look for us at Burning Man and for an all-night full moon beach party
in early autumn.

Good Sunday morning sfravers, rise and shine!

Looking for posts on Chrysalis!  Heard rumours it was in San Rafael (thats up

Well, I'am back after being away for 2 weeks. My poor mail box got
overflowed since I havent read mail since. As part of my trip I was in
Vegas this past weekend. They have a weekly called Utopia saturday nights
on a club called Epicenter. Lucky for me it was across the street from my
hotel. We walked in expecting just to hear some techno and to leave early.
Oh, how wrong I was. I asked the girl selling the tickets who was spinning
and she said a DJ from Florida, another one from SD, and finally a live
performance by Rabbit on the Moon. Let me tell you, this is been one of
the most spectacular live shows I ever seen. The music is just awsome, and
there was this man that kept comming on stage with the most incredible
customes you can imagine. I cant even beging to describe them. If you ever
have the chance just go see them. BTW, hello once again to you wonderful
people.

ah those awesome laws that no one has money to change :)  we have two

in Gastown (one of our communities) and women can't show their ankles on

Hey all, what's up?  It's a beautiful day out today.  What's there to do for
people who can't afford to take a nice sunset cruise?  Any outdoor activities
going on today?  

So, I was just wondering who stayed for Juggernaut Festival last night.  My
friends and I went to check it out, but weren't too pleased with what we were
encountered with.

We arrived at the 18th & Illinois location at the time when the party was
still being set up.  One section was open to us, and it was a hassle to get
inside.  Then when we got in (anyone could have gotten in for free, 'cuz we
saw people all around us handing each other used tickets).  I was so appalled
by the manner of some of those so called "ravers".  It was more like a drug
dealing session.  Walking in a party, it's a slight turnoff to have a bunch
of 17 year olds practically yelling out drugs to sell to young innocent kids
who haven't the slightest idea what's being pushed in their faces.  We were
literally walking through a tunnel of people saying, "E, E, Acid, Liquid,
Shrooms, E, Doses, etc, etc.  Every name that you could think of.  This
wasn't supposed to be a dealer's market.

I'm sorry if I'm offending anyone out there, but it was just so surprising
seeing how many young people are out there at these parties just to make
money.

If any of you stayed past 2:00, was it worth the $25?  I'd like to think
differently, but as of now, I won't go to a party that charges more than $15.

I really hate to be negative, but I had to voice my opinion.  I just miss
feeling the good vibes, good feelings, smiling faces, hugging arms.  That's
what every party should be like!!   

Peace....   Karen

Did anyone notice that last nights 2 big parties (Juggernaut and Chrysalis)
were both next to fish markets?

What does this mean?

There are no coincidences.

god, what can i say...

chrysalis last night was my first rave... won't be my last. just blown away.

more positive energy than i've ever seen in one place. i could feel it
everywhere, all around me, positive, loving, electric energy.

from hand lotion to hugs, personal contact so wonderfully natural, two (or
three or four or five) people feeling the energy and love of the whole
place in- between their fingertips...

smiling at people, they smile back. you both know how happy you are and
positive energy dances in the air between you.

the music. the music! my god... i'd liked what i'd heard of techno, etc.
(which wasn't that much) but this stuff was just incredible. and it just
kept getting better and better. in other settings i'm often reluctant to
dance, but with the music and the people and the vibe, my body became one
with the beat... it was great!

nothing i say can describe how i feel but i think you all know...

thank you everyone on this list for being such a great community, i'm happy
to have joined you...
thank you to all those who responded to my newbie queries the other day,
you made me feel welcome here...
and an extra special THANK YOU to matt l. and shawna who personally
introduced me to my first rave and took it upon themselves to make sure i
had a great time. i love you guys.


feeling plurry,

First things first.

If the FCC decides to harass you, they are legally empowered to sieze your
broadcasting equipment. This will include your turntables and tape
recorders as well as the transmitter. Be prepared to deal with this. (Or
keep the decks away from the transmitter!)

This was a preliminary injunction against the FCC.

This is still up in the air (no pun intended). Hopefully, you don't want to
spend as much in legal fees as FRB has to prove their point. (FYI, I
believe that there should be an unlicensed part of the broadcast spectrum
for low power local broadcasters...)

>(approx 1 mile per watt, roughly) without getting in
>trouble.

??? Where do you come up with that figure? If that was true, I'd be able to
pick up almost any commercial station across the country.

Antenna design, Antenna Height, surrounding terrain make all the difference
in the world.

>If on the other hand you choose to broadcast illegal or
>particularily subversive material, you might be in a different sort of

The important thing to remember here is that your station MUST NOT cause
any interference to a licensed station. The second you do, they will be
after you. And you should know that a lot of commercial broadcasters have
had legitimate complaints about pirate broadcasters with noisy/distorted
signals (the RF - radio frequency part is noisy, causing interference to
other stations. The audio can still sound fine if the RF is noisy).

If you want to legal scoop on unlicensed transmitters, read the FCC's
regulations, "part 15" which covers unlicensed transmitters.

If you want information on buying an inexpensive commercial grade
transmitter, check out this ad I scanned from the classifieds of a
Broadcast engineering magazine...

  I'm glad someone cleared this up for me.  As I mentioned, all of this
was 2nd or 3rd hand knowledge to me, I have not looked into any of the
legal stuff myself.

  This was just my understanding (I did say roughly, right :) based on
rather limited experience, and a few conversations with people in pirate
radio.

  Didn't mean to be spewing misinformation, sorry :)... I should have upt
some "as far as I know" disclaimers in there...
  Oh well!

bad news, folks . . .

according to KRON's news update, police confiscated 40 LBS. of herb from
the cannibis buyer club's hq in sf, and altho not interested in prosecuting
members who get herb for medicinal purposes, they want to get at the people
selling to the club, who they believe also sell to regular folk . . .

people we know work for the club, and we should give them all our support
in this most critical time in their history

don't go down quietly -- i think i read at chrysalis last night (btw, it
was amazing) that the statewide medical marijuana initiative qualified for
the Nov. ballot (Prop 215?), and probably the powers that be are striking
now before there is a chance for the people to disagree . . .

and let's hope juries will treat medicinal growers like medicinal users,
and not convict

Dear list members,
I just picked up a flyer in the castro giving the following information.

An "out of sf" team headed by Pete Wilson and Dan Lundgren has just busted 
the "cannabis buyers club", an organization that helps provide medicinal 
marijuana to dying AIDS patients, (marijuana is one of the only drugs 
that helps them keep their appetite, etc.) There will be a protest 
tomorrow, at 8:30 AM at Castro and Market, plus there will be a hearing 
at 1:30 pm at Courtroom 1A, (Judge Cahill) Dept 8 at 850 Bryant, tomorrow 
(Monday) I know this isn't rave related, but I think this is important.
The people who receive their cannabis from the Cannabis Buyers Club are all
sick or dying. This is a cheap shot by some very unsavory political 
characters. I'm sure that there will be other protests, There may be one 
going on right now in the 1400 block of Market (the CBC site)
If you live near there, it might be worth checking out.

IMHO Wilson is the worst governor this state has ever had.

PROTEST!

Well, Dionysus Dreams was there providing a slide show and supplemental 
lighting for the Mantra room. Natrually I have a bias on this event. I 
think that while the overall event was flawed, the Mantra crew pulled 
together (under less than ideal conditions!) one of the more amazing 
"rooms" I've ever seen. San Francisco Acid was well represented by that 
room!!! The room was PACKED all night long and into the daylight hours 
and was fully going off all night. People were climbing the walls! I 
checked out the other rooms (this event was spread over two piers), an 
outdoor room next to us, and the other two rooms at the other pier. The 
main stage was devoid of any music or anything for quite a while. 
Apparently the decision to use that space (for Juggernaught) was made at 
the last minute (due to unspecified problems) and renting generators 
became a problem for some reason (like the shops rental shops closing). 
So the main floor had no power for most of the night. When it did get 
gowing, there was a standard BRIGHT green laser, some intelligabt 
lighting, fog and the video screens (which looked the same two hours 
later). The music was coming from a DJ buried admidst equipment on the 
stage. Very uninspiring. 

 Meanwhile the Mantra room was going OFF the whole night with beautiful 
sets from Theta Blip, Dutch, Surge and from a live group whose name 
eludes me (sorry!) but who played some incredible music!

The door scene was rather lame. Most working crew had to deal with no 
laminates (horrors) so we had to sweet talk the guards just to walk around.

Well maybe outside the Mantra room this was going on (I never saw it) but 
in the Mantra room people were too busy dancing to hustle the young, 
reckless crowd. There did seem to be a bit of a youngsters scene going on 
elsewhere at Juggernaught with a slight Gangsta feel in the air.

I think it is great you are voicing your disasatisfaction with a poorly 
run, expensive, event. I certainly didn't think the show worth $25, 
despite the Mantra room.

Thanks for this post; this really hit home, as I had a similar
weekend; I was unfortunate to attend Terminator at the Trocadero on
Friday (friend's recommendation)... not to bash someone else's scene,
but I was thoroughly miserable by the end of the evening, and even
into the next day. now I know why goth people are so gloomy :) oh
well;

fortunately, Chrysalis :) :) :) happened the next day to revitalize my
soul; came at 11:00, stayed till the bitter end. well worth it; I have
a smile permanently attached to my face and keyboard :) the ambient
room was key- the anxiety of the week was replaced by bliss and
peacefulness...

does anyone know who was spinning in the ambient room at around 3 or
4am? There was a woman (why are there so few female dj's ???) followed
by a man; they were playing this somewhat soft, ambient-like music
with a slow almost hip-hop like beat underneath it; I don't know how
to describe it, but if anyone knows who I'm talking about...

Steve

Don't quite know where to begin.  I've only ever posted once before.

Chrysalis, w0w!

It was so beautifull.  The music was great and I can't believe how quickly
the time went!  Having only gotten the chance to go to only a few in the
past, Chrysalis definately set the scene for me.  The people were fabo!
It's too hard to imagine that I got there close to the beginning and then
the next thing I know it's 5am!

Plain bl0wn away by all the positive people, vibes and happenings.

Peace!

Hello,

In the spirit of community building at Burning Man, I am setting up
a mailing list to facilitate communication between those people planning
to camp at the "vw-camp", which will be located exactly half-way between
the Main Camp and the Techno Ghetto at Burning Man.

All I know about this camp so far is that it will be built around Vince's
VW bus, which will arrive on Weds and leave sometime after Monday... and
even that is not certian :)

So, if you are interested in helping to build a community around this bus,
send me an email and I will add you by hand to this mailing list.  Please
don't request to be on this list unless you plan to camp in the vicinity
of vw-camp, and please don't be asked to be removed from this list.

to post to vw-camp, send a message to:

vw-camp@schwa.eng.sun.com

 Well my supervisor signed by vacation request. Even though she told me she
will regret it later. She is actually one of the best people I have ever
worked for or with. So I'll be heading up on Weds 28th with the VMAR crew,
Vince and Wayne and everyone else that will be caravaning together.  I
remember reading all the post last year. I was one hour away from going
last year. This year I'm there. If everything goes as planned, I should
have me BBQ with me for everyone to use.  Just a reminder about the BBQ.
Since it will be probally hotter there then at the BBQ & BEATS parties, I'm
not going to be hovering over it as I usually do. So your in charge of your
own food if you want to cook it. I'll keep an eye on it if I'm there
though.  I'll also have a big surprise at the end of the trip which
involves the my BBQ pit.

Now, if only I had a ticket.

Dear All;

        The bust, though a temporary set back, I feel was inevitable. They
were operating above the law, and all the people who were involved in the
arrest were just following the laws WE THE PEOPLE PUT ON THE BOOKS. You as I
are just as responsible for the arrest as the police. I a registered voter
in California however took the time to sign the petition to try and change
these injustices.

        This event will hopefully bring HOME to the uninformed TV audience
of hopefully at least the regional area that the idea that the need for
medical pot is a sound, humane, and medically necessary one. An idea that
must come about in OUR time, so register & vote, register & vote, register &
vote people, for it's the only way to un-legislate these dumb laws.

Peace
Brian

That was Claire.  She's not only one of the founders and organizers of
Gateway Systems (who threw the party), she's a great ambient DJ, and an all
around amazing young woman.  Following her was Rob, also an indispensable
part of Gateway, and following him was Joe Rice, of fame beyond measure.

=)

Glad you had fun!!  Look for gateway at Burning Man...

Did anyone catch the energy spheres that kept popping up from other dimesions
in the front chill room?  They would appear out of nowhere, bounce around
and check us out for a couple of minutes, then they would hyperspace back
into their own dimension with a loud burst of energy.

I also enjoyed the guy doing the dynamic alter.  Unlike a boring static
alter, this person had the basic alter ingredients, a padded board, cloth,
candles, flowers, pins, and other assorted goodies that he arranged and
re-arranged in ever-changing configurations.  He quickly incorperated
other items that people donated to the alter, including Sunset fliers.

I felt safe knowing that I was in a location where if anything happened to the
soundsystem, they could just go upstairs and get a new one.

Dear All;

        Anyone have a 486 or better laptop they would like to loan me, I
want to purchase some GPS software and antenna to track my progress and
location while in transit and at Burning Man.

Peace
Brian

ps GPS = Global Positioning System for all you not MIL/GOV types.
GPS is a satellite based system that gives you your precise location on the
planet in degree longitude, latitude, direction of travel & heading. Basic
navigation stuff that used to be available only the military and has been
made available to the general public willing to shell out the bucks for the
required software and equipment.

        They also have hand held units non-pc based that fit into your
pocket, soo cool for that camper/adventurer/solider of fortune. I'm such a
geek = >

I wasn't there...but I bet you they were Clair and Rob.  Clair plays
beautiful music, and it wouldn't surprize me one little bit if Rob did,
too...I haven't had the chance to hear him yet.  

I gotta get out more!!

It was really sad.  The first indication that this was going to be a bad party was calling the number early Sat evening and hearing "um, we've run into some technical difficulties, lost our space, moving everything to the new location, will update message at the very latest 9:30"  9:30 - no new message, 10 - no new message, 10:30 - no new message.  11pm - Yeah!, finally get directions.......We (Jason Green and I) arrived there at around Midnight to find one of the rooms not open yet.  So we headed down the street to the other pier.  Walking in was like walking into Gangsta/Drugfest '96.  Every single drug known to man was offered to us within the first 10 steps of the party.  We immediatly headed to the Mantra room which was going off already.  This was the best room all night, and I really dont even like Goa!  Code 4 put on a long fast crazy live set.  Listened to a little bit of Dutch's set.  Decided to head over to the other pier.  Getting thru the security was harder than !
going through customs.  We were searched.  Asked for our ticket (had to dig thru my pockets for it amidst all the other fliers), asked to see our stamp, then searched again!  Something was wrong with the generator in this room which looked more like a concert stage set up than anything else.  The DJ booth was surounded by intela-beams (SP?) and the guy running the lights and laser was placed infront of the DJ.  They had some computers set up with Video Games for people to play off to the side. One of which was a Doom like
You-have-a-gun-shoot-everything-that-moves Game.  If you're going to have computer games at a Rave, they should be nice "Fluffy" games.  Not shoot em up games.  Decided to head back to the other pier since the Mantra room seemed like our best bet.  When we got to the entrance of the other pier, we easily walked right past security at the front gate, and past the guy taking money and tickets.  Would have been super easy for anyone to get into this party for free.  The rest of the night was pretty much the same.  Crappy music, Crapy people.  If there was a vibe, I never found it.  Ok, Kenny Larkins set was good, although he never played live as promised. I never saw Jonah Sharp there, And unfortunatly, missed Freaky Chakra's set.

But there were positives, My car didnt get broken into, The Manra Room was super cool, And I got to hang with my buddy Jason for the night, even though I hang out with him all day at work, it was still cool.

This one is my favorite.  It seems to be a strange law to inforce.  I'm sure all the guys can remember back in Math Class when you were called up to the front of the class to solve the problem on the board and your were..... ah, well, lets just say that wasnt a roll of quarters in your pocket......Would you get fined (or arrested!) for something like that?

     Many happy notes shot forth from the speakers.  The chill room 
     couldn't seem to find room for another soul, but was most divine.  
     Even the cops meandering through seemed like nice people.
     
     After a mostly harmless and pleasant evening, I ventured back slightly 
     tired to my car in the beautifully scented parking (like a scratch and 
     sniff Quincy episode) available at Chrysalis.
     
     I stood slack jawed and stared at my 87 Suzuki Summersault.  To my 
     horror I saw two fat blobs of somewhat consumed blow pop core gum (I 
     can tell) in my back seat.  It's bad enough I own a 
     crappy/tacky/unstable car.  Please don't make it worse by flicking gum 
     in my backseat.  One of you know who did it...
     
     Grrrrrr kill kill kill.... there.  Now I'm over it.

Jeez, right then and there I would have said "Forget it!"  Especially for 
an event that size.  If your intuition said "No way" as early as the info

I think that ALL food has it's place.  And it depends on your genetics, 
where you are born, availability of resources, etc.

I like it all.  After all, I am human, and there is little I caanot 
enjoy, when prepared to my taste.

I would eat a cat or a dog, any bird, anything hat swins or crawls in the 
ocean, as long as it tastes good.

As for things being good for me?  Whatever.  The earth is so polluted, 
the oceans are dying from overfishing, the land is toxic due to years and 
centuries of abuse from aggie chemicals, the air is getting worse.  I 
think that much of this is illusional.

I am from the South.  I cannot tell you how many people I know who have 
lived over 100 years eating salty, greasy, fat laden food.  I cannot tell 
you the number of people who drink & smoke and eat, what we might call, 
unhealthy.  Yet, many of these codgers live to be 80-100+ years old.

In the end, I think it is how one lives ones life, and how one deals with 
life.  I dion't think things will ever be so simple as to be narrowed 
down to one quotient, food.

Food is just one ingredient to a long healthy life.  And yes, I do think 
you can live a long healthy life and not be a vegan.

Some of the healthiest people I know are omnivores.

Live long & consume mass quantities,
John

> My question is *why*?

I did have a good reason to go.  A few weeks ago I ran into Dutch who told me that Kenny Larkin is coming to town to play live.  They were trying to track down a certain Mixer for him to use and I just happened to have one so I lent it to him.  On Friday I gave it to one of the Space Children Crew.  So I had to go to the party to retrieve my mixer, which was never used, because somebody failed to borrow or rent the remaining equiptment that Kenny needed to play live.  Luckily, we were on the guest list so I really didnt loose anything that night other than a good nights sleep.

DENIAL is a very powerful force!!  You keep hoping your intuition is 
wrong.  :)  And, then when it was right, you beat yourself up.  Takes a 
couple of times, and then you learn!!

Not for much longer. The world's oceans are being fished at *three
times* the replacement rate. I like fish, but don't eat much 'free
range' fish because of this.

Fish farming of vertibrate fish has the same concerns as any other
farming: over-crowding, disease, possible unnecessary suffering,
additives in food, etc. Farming of shellfish isn't as bad, IMHO,
because they're grown in conditions very close to 'natural'.

Perry Farrell's ENIT Festival is getting rolling for summer. Call (212)
330-9134 to hear the current lineup recited by Perry himself - Black
Grape, Love and Rockets, Farrell's own Porno for Pyros, and Lady Miss Kier
(Deee-Lite). Rumor has it the tour will feature top UK DJs in each city
like Carl Cox and Andy Weatherall. Exact tour dates are as yet
unannounced.

 ---
Many will remember last year's uneven San Francisco ENIT fest included
DJ/performances from
Sven Vath, Moby, Tracy Lords, DJ Spooky, Freaky Chakra and Single Cell
Orchestra. etc...

Dear Yous;

        I agree but I still love fish like, dolphin, shark, sword, halibut,
monk, salmon, shell, red, ...etc. America is one of the very few countries
that does NOT have an fish agency, equivalent to the meat people who rate &
inspect meat products for disease & quality.

Peace
Brian

 There is a little advert for this ENIT festival that is happening
later this month. The advert is in yesterday's ( Sunday's ) San
Francisco Chronicle "Pink Section". I'm at work, maybe the Chronicle's
web site has a web page about it?

i think it's cos somewhere waaaay down inside there's a little voice that 
says "but what if it DOES go off ....?  man i'll be so sad if i miss 
that!"  even though nine times out of ten it doesn't, that still small 
voice is what keeps ppl going to the big crap fests ....

Hey all you SFR kiddies out there,

Something to think about while you're revving up them engines this week:

"Based on the desire for total mobility
 and a serious physical pursuit of religious freedom
 the auto drove mankind further than the wheel
 and, in remote areas, even today
 is forbidden as a device too suspect for human conveyance.
 This articulate conception has only brought us all more of the same -
 Thoughtlessly locked into phase two gridlock
 Keyed up,
 On its rims,
 And abandoned
 On the expressway"

						- Blondie
						  "Europa"

Mr. Jake

Who's sick of L.A.

        Well, of course I',m a bit skeptical, but I think this should be
fun. Prodigy is an arena-rave band and should go off. Massive Attack, Black
Grape...bands I'd love to see. Outdoors in some field...contacting
aliens..there's only 12 tour stops, so it should be quality. Did I mention
it's from Dusk till Dawn? Anyways...sounds better than any other festival
coming around...

Usually I write glowing happy reviews of raves I have been to over the
weekend... but I have a few things I should say about the Juggernaught
"Festival".

On Sat, I picked Randy up from Santa Cruz in the morning, then headed up to
SF.  After last minuite space relocations, we finally arrived at the
location to set up.  Eeewww.. that fishy smell ;)  <good thing ravers all
carry inscense>

So then the Mantra crew went to work putting together one of the better
trance rooms I have seen.  Raven and Jennifer did a great job setting up the
altar, and setting the ambiance of the room.  I worked with Randy on the
lighting and slide show, which was quite pleasing IMHO.  I then got to hear
some of my FAVORITE music ALL NITE!  Goa/Psychodelic/Yum Yum/Psychokinetic
trance was spun by Anna, Dutch, Theta-Blip, Surge and Code-4.  The Mantra
room definately went off, despite some difficulties and negative energy
surrounding the rest of the party.

About the rest of the party...  There were numerous problems, and security
was pretty bad.  It was such a hassle to even try to go over to the main
area, which was pretty whackt 'cept for the junglists.  The sound for Planet
Rock, the area outside the Mantra room, was nice and clean and the people
who like breaks/house were having fun there. The fire felt nice.  I kinda
wanted more of an ambient place to sit and chill though.

I'm sorry that people feel bad about going to this event... I wish all raves
could be Plurry, vibe-filled, massive, perfectly put together, and cheap...

Thanks Adam for the flight ;) 
Good to finally meet you Raven. <hug>

havE a grEat wEEk! ;)
Aaron.

BTW:  I happened to lose my *red blinking bike light* over by the fire at
the party.  If by the slim chance that anyone on SF-Raves picked it up,
please mail me.  Thanks.

Greetings and salutauions,

Well after spending a restful Friday @ home (sorry for all those who
responded to my Friday post that I didn't return, Im a Monday - Friday, 8-5,
posting person).  I was charged and set for a Stellar Saturday.  

Arriving in Richmond @ 3pm, I helped set up with the River crew and chatted
with a few of the DJ's and others unitll the music started.  Nice ambient set
with Bonnie, mixin' dem CD's. Not too danceable, so I streched out on a dock
and did some simple meditating (till I realized the dock wasnt anchored to
anything and started to drift upstream).  Jumped off and kicked it with a few
non-SFR's till Ronan took control over the turntables danced thru his and
Cyr's sets, helped breakdown and headed to SF...

Got to the city @ about 10:30ish.  Dropped by a friends for dinner and made
my way to Chrysalis @ about 11-or-so.  Danced furiously till about 12:30-1am
i guess. Saw many of you there (Wayne, Shawana, Tim, Matt) talked to a few
too (Rikki, Brian, Roger) but I chilled mostly in the Trip-hop room next to
the main room talking to a few newbes and catching some ZZZ's (Wow, I guess
the flame isn't burning so great for me this summer).  I did get up
periodicly and dance in 30 - 40 minute intervals but it was a nice relaxed
event for me this time around...

Sunday (After regaining conciusness) I more or less spent cleaning my record
collection and watching Planet of the Apes,
 "Get yer stinking paws off me you bloody ape".

All in all I'd give the weekend a solid 9.725 (in Olympic terms).


So next weeks plate is even more appetizing:  F-8 on Friday night and I hear,
something eARTHy is coming dOWN TO a city near  you on Saturday...
   

"dance with me...."

Adam

presale :)

you know im not sure if I wrote a review yet. Its been a crazy weekend.
You know about the delays
You know about crappy security (which took water bottles, fuqrs - sorry,
but im pretty unforgiving about this, and no free h20 inside)
general confusion.
I dunno, I saw a lot of people out dancing and having a good time.
I kinda put drug dealers and people handing out flyers in the same league.
If they stay out of the way of my dancing, i don't really care.
Didn't pick up a real ganster vibe, though there were a lot of latino kids
there (are people mistaking the two?)

really, the mantra room saved the event for me. certainly not worth $20.
But really nice to be dancing with back to speakers and seeing sun rise
over the boats and have my stpd silly grin echoed by the kids around me. My
sense of tiem is skewed, but around 1 am ish, there was some great musi=k
coming out of the setup next to the mantra room.

take care

It's really weird, I guess I was one of the only ones (at least on this 
list) that thought the party went off.  I agree that the door scene when 
we got there was really burnt.  Usually, I would totally let a large mass 
of pushing people at the door put me off, but I was determined to keep a 
good attitude, cuz the music was gonna make it all worth it.  

We were into the outside set-up the most, two huge stacks of speakers 
facing the moon and the bay.  It was a bit cold, but there was a huge 
bonfire going with lots of nice people sitting around it.  We hung out by 
the fire most of the night(you could here the music perfectly, due to the 
large speaker set-up) and took periodic trips to the dancefloor.  The 
bonfire was like a big outdoor chill area.  On our trips to the 
dancefloor, it seemed like most everyone was having a good time dancing.  
A very mixed crowd (age and background), which I don't see much in SF and 
I thought it was cool that all these different people were having fun and 
going off together, though it sort of scares me to see kids that look 
about 12 out at parties.:) (prob. because I'm so old!) 

I guess I didn't really notice the drug dealing aspect so much, I tend to 
just ignore that type of stuff anyway (like I would really by drugs from 
some random person at a party).

I really loved the music.  Yes, it was mostly house, but really acidy 
with lots of  deep bass.  The indoor room looked really cool, but I am 
just not that into that sort of music.  We didn't go into the other rooms. 
We went over to check them out once we heard they had opened, but when we 
got there all we could hear was hardcore, and I can't get into that, reminds 
me too much of LA.:)

We left about 5 or so (I wasn't feeling well), all in all pretty happy with 
the evening.  

Cheers***
Cami

Other than having a little trouble with the directions, I had a great night. 
I saw a few familiar faces there, but I was stuck in dance mode most of the
night :) and didn't really talk to anyone. Sorry bout that. :)  The two friends
I brought both had fun (It was their first rave).  The one from Pittsburgh was
still on east coast time and so he crashed in my car around 2:30, but the one
from Denver danced till 6:00.

Well it's the way most likely to be effective--I don't forsee any
meaningful revolutions in our near future.

Hello everyone!
Dano here.  Thanks to all who dropped in last Tuesday, we appreciate the
support and hope to see you again tomorrow night.  For those of you who
missed us- we missed you!  And we hope you can come down 111 Minna st.
for our new weekly club called Fly! Featuring Dj's Dano & Keith plus
weekly guests.
The music will be eclectic but most likely a broad range of trippy house
with dashes of trance and a hint of techno!!! MMM....goood!  TNT Blast!
will be providing a live video mixing extravaganza which should be
superb! We will begin around 9:30 and hopefully will go until 2:30 or
3:00. Donations appreciated to help cover our costs.

We hope to see you all there showing your support and smiles :)
Feel free to contact me for answers.
Peace
Dano

I'm sorry that Juggernaut wasn't so great, but... um..
"ghetto rave"?  What is that supposed to mean?

This discussion makes me (as basically an outsider to this issue) wonder
how many people of this list (among which there are likely to be a few
pot smokers or at least legalization proponents) are members of organizations
like NORML or the medical cannabis lobby. I'm not sure about the impact
of peoples votes if it's not preceeded by lobbying, advertizing and in
general making some facts known to the general public which is still being
brainwashed by the DEA, the local and federal government etc.

I'm considering the rather risky and fiscally dangerous purchase of a
dual cd mixer, cuz I've got so damned many ambient cds and now I wanna
start spinning in earnest.  It sucks having to mix between a Sony 5-disc
changer and a crusty old Discman on my Numark. 
Anyone out there have any suggestions on cd mixers, with pitch control and
all that, of course?  I'm hoping to spend no more than ~800...


	thanks,

Good day,

>>:^(  I do have about 200hrs of Dead, and some Janis, My Bloody Valentine, Spiritualized, 
>>Jane's, Mr. Bungle, Bob Marley, Phish...if any of you  would dig some of this stuff, I'd be 
>>happy to trade for your favorites.  Partial to trance, but open to anything.

I've noticed that Deadheads and regae folk have much in common with ravers.
The most immediately receptive newbie I have brought into the scene was
also into the Dead and various underground events related to the music.

Take care,
                     Jason

Hello everybody-

 I need to clean some records, and I'm wondering what's the best tools for 
doing this.  Somebody told me that rubbing alcohol and a lint rag work, but I'd 
like to get other suggestions.  Thanx!

Cheap way: wash them in warm water with detergent and a soft cloth, and
leave them in a dish rack to dry. This works well, and i've used it to
get serious gunk off records. 

More expensive but not necessarily better: spend $$$ on special
cleaning fluids from a specialist hi-fi store.

Do *NOT* do this. Washing records with normal detergents can leave 
residue on the vinyl. Bad, bad, icky, icky...

Hi all!

 Well, in my exhausted delirium I forgot to thank the folks who really 
deserved it:

A-RON :   Thanks for the lift and the hard work and support. You really 
	  helped to make the evening fun for me.

Dagny :   Thanks for your help also. Your warmth, humor and overall vibe 
	  are so very beautiful!

Raven :   Beautiful alter!! Thanks for protecting my glass head. ;)

Jennifer: Thanks to your energy flow! You really helped lubricate the 
          whole process of decorating the trance room (we did it!!!).

Anna/Ceiba: You folks kicked some seriously sic tunes. Thank you (and 
            sorry I forgot your names in my first post!!)

Owen/CCC : Thanks for the lift home Owen and big thanks to CCC for 
           letting me snooze at their playpen.

Gia :   Thanks for your help and energy at the end of the show. KISS!

 I would also like to add that the system next to us was playing some 
great house and I even liked some of the jungle being played at the next 
pier. I was so busy how ever that I could barely spend any time at these 
spots. The bonfire looked pretty cool also. And did anyone catch the moon 
as it came from behind the rusting hull of the ship close by? Very nice.


Peace all


Ran

I sit at work on a gloomy Monday afternoon.  I'm glad the clouds have 
waited till the workweek to come and shroud us in grayness.  I'm 
listening to KALX on my walkman (my boss prefers KFOG on the office radio!).  And then some 
strange, experimental techno comes on, and my blood starts pumping.  
First, some sounds circling each other (the dj explains, this group mixes 
cd's together).  They almost clash but instead manage to blend into 
beautiful ambient.  Then, it gives way to pumping bass, and takes me 
away.  I am suddenly alert, tingling, on this dark cold day.  Strange 
sounds start morphing into almost-decipherable words.  Then, the 
suggestions become more and more intelligible, and it comes together: 
"Marijuana is the flame, heroin is the fuse, ecstasy is the BOMB!"
Over and over again.

Suddenly, waves are coursing through me.  The music transports me to that 
feeling - that unbelievable feeling - of the anticipation and excitement 
of trance dancing and soaring chemical highs and giddy happiness.  It is 
as if the experience is now encoded in my cells, and it sometimes only 
needs the sound of the music (the conduit to the original experience) to 
take me there again.

I have noticed this reaction before - when the coolest aerobics teacher 
at the gym puts on his house and trance tapes - eschewing the lame, 
'80's synthesizer aerobics crap favored by all the others - and suddenly 
I can fly through the work-out.  The music gives me energy.  The music 
releases the endorphins that I have associated with raving. The MUSIC can 
be the drug!

This doesn't happen every time I hear the music outside, but it is a 
delicious surprise when it does.  :) :)

Nancy

Hi,

It's no bust, it's a 22' truck... many of you have seen it there last year,
too... it's our home away from home! :-)

Good day,

This is rave related only in that it will help a fellow raver get to Burning Man and
build some sub-cabinets for future deployment at BBQs and other small New
Moon type parties.

I am selling a :
                            1991 Honda Nighthawk 750 motorcycle
                            New dunlop tires, battery, heavy duty chain
                            National cycle flexiglass 3 windshield,
                            GSXR-750 clutch springs, spare Redline 
                            hvy dty clutch discs, 1 helmet, 16,000 miles

                                                    $2800 o.b.o.

This bike is not PERFECT cosmetically.  But is a damn NICE bike.  I am the origional 
owner and can vouch that it was maintained by one of the best mechanics around, me.
After a knee injury I am unable to ride such a heavy bike anymore, without possibly 
re-injuring my knee should the bike begin to tip.  If you or anyone else you know might
be interested, they can contact me at this e-mail address or by phone @ (916) 852-0127.

Take care,
                     Jason

The Dutchman has a point here.  The public is still being fed a disproportionate amount
of disinformation on the subject of drug prohibition in general.  And Marijuana's medicinal
uses in particular.  I have signed petitions when they were presented to me.  But, there
needs to be more people willing to help educate mainstream America about the costs
involved in the war on drugs, seizure laws, incarceration, and medical issues both pro
and con.  Without this angle, even lobbying won't get you anywhere, because there will
be no public support should such a measure or law come up for a vote.  Protests can
only benefit the cause, if you can get some kind of unbiased media coverage to make
sure the people who might be sympathetic to your cause are reached.  It doesn't help
if your protest is percieved by the majority to be without merit due to the slant some a
reporter has put on the facts in a 15 second slot.  

Here in Sacto. I have seen nothing on the news that portrays the club as positive.  
No interviews with the AIDS or cancer patients that will be so adversely affected by 
the government's actions in this case.  Even a 10 second spot, with one person, 
could pull the public's heart strings enough to make a difference, if not now, in the 
future when a measure comes up for a vote.

If anyone has info about NORML or sister organizations, I would be interested.

Take care,
                     Jason

Good day,

>>Being a massage therspist, I have one word for lotion, please not. The massage oils I 
>>use, I feel and know are much better than oily, slimely, clothes staining, un-natural lotion.

I totally agree with you on this one.  Maybe you could put some information onto the list 
regarding the various types of oils and location where happy ravers could pick them up.
I know that here in Sacramento, food co-ops are one of the most accessably places
to purchase oils.  They are sold by the ounce; you bring in or purchase a small bottle,
and just fill it up.  Alot of people frequent these co-ops for their organic/ vegan cooking
needs anyway.  If your really into it, various scents can be added to the bulk oils.
These essences are the basis for aromatherapy, and add an extra dimension to
the massage.   i.e. calming, warmth, alertness etc.  

Let the creativity flow...

Take care,  
                      Jason

 It's at the Bahia Cabana restaurant/club at 1600 Market St. I think that's
at the intersection of Franklin, Page, and Market . Going southwest on
Market , past Van Ness, the club will be at a corner, on the right.

 Enjoy !

Dear All;

        I personally like water dispersible combination oils the best. When
I say combination oils I mean oils which are made of 2 or more different
oils eg Hybrid Safflower, Hazelnut, Pecan, Grape Speed, Sesame, Almond ...etc.

        Try and find oils that are all natural(including the scents if
scented) & without preservatives. Also, purchase products that state that
they use NO animal testing.

        I also use different makes & scents in different life situations
....eg I have different  unscented & scented oils for clients than I do for
friends & lovers. The aroma association is not a wise one because you never
want to link your bedroom to your business. In my school of thought it's
absolutely and totally unethical to have sexual relations with a
client(someone who pays you money for the massage). I hold a state license
and am bound by a code of ethics set forth by the AMTA( American Massage
Therapy association) and also strongly & personally believe in them.

        The two scented oils I use for friends and lovers are One On One's
Honeysuckle & Mango Peligroso; available at GNS(The General Nutrition
Store). They smell editable, and I image they are because they have only
natural ingredients and also have a very passionate essence to them.

        Because I'm a therapist and when I'm practicing I usually use an oil
that is not scented, unless requested otherwise. In my training and school
of massage thought it's considered improper to use a scent that is not
picked by the person receiving the massage. The person giving the massage
should NOT put anything that theirs onto the person receiving it; a scent
picked by the therapist would be an example of this. Also, in the practice
of massage the massage is about the person receiving it, and should NOT
fulfill any needs of the person giving it. It's a wondrously special
gift/experience from someone else to yourself.

        I've experienced some of the most cosmic experiences on the table.
There are times, and without the aid of drugs I've experienced narcotic like
states in which I dream. In these states I'm totally disconnected from my
body; also floating above it, meaning I can't even feel the therapist
working on me; but I can hear. On the occasions when I dream I never
remember what I dream, until I find myself there in the middle of dey-sza-vu
experience and it all comes back to me.

        Go out and get yourself one today, you deserve it, your body
deserves it; what have you done for your body today?

Peace & Massage
Brian

FYI

 I saw on CNN today (monday) some coverage on that bust and I felt the 
coverage was pro-medical pot. The spot ended by saying that pot can help 
AIDS patients and glaucoma patients.

Don't use alcohol, detergents, or tap water. Alcohol will degrade the PVC on
the records. Detergents and tap water leave deposits on the records, leaving
them in noisier shape than before you started.

I only use Discwasher D4 cleaning fluid and brush. Ususally, just three
drops on the brush will do the trick. Also, using an anti-static gun helps
to prevent dust from accumulating on the record, and reduces static noise on
the stylus.

(Just some thoughts on our "Democracy")

We don't live in a democracy and we never have.  But even "our" government
officals speak of the great democracy.  This rhetoric has never been right,
and it will never be right until reformation occurs.  The "U" "S" in USA
means United States...which is a UNION of states.  If you don't agree, read
the Constitution or Bill of Rights.  They speak of union, not democracy.  

Up until the New Deal and FDR we were doing ok, but FDR set up socialism
with excessive government intervention after the war.  Power was stripped
from the states, and this is when socialism took roots in America.  Sadly,
we are still in the throws of socialism.  For all you socialists out there,
it doesn't work and it never will.  History has clearly proven this. 

People need freedom, an identity and the ability to do right OR screw up and
pay the price; not to mention a real voice.  In socialism, we might just as
well implant that chip in our brain now and all wear the same uniforms.  If
the USA keeps up at its current rate, it won't be long.  The government has
taken responsiblity for everyone and everything.  It has lulled the masses
into beleiving they are not responsible for themselves.  It has become its
own living entity of sorts, like a beast, and will not go quietly. Socialism
and communism are the same thing, with only a different approach.  And this
is where the US in now.  Teetering on full-blown socialism or communism (but
given a different name of course, to avoid provoking Jane/John Q. Public).  

Voting and a democracy are two very different ideals in the USA. Since the
electorial college and "representatives" which actually decide what laws
should be put on the books, who should be president, who should be in
elected office, etc., the act of voting does little these days.  The only
way to let our voice be heard is to beat the government at its own game and
go through the "proper" channels so to speak.  Lobby.  Work it!  Of course,
we do not have to go quietly either.  With regards to Pot and the bust in
SF, I think that weed should be legalized.  Alchohol and tobacco are legal,
and are much worse for you.  The news reports have convinced me that the
establishment in SF was raided because it was selling to far too many people
who were not ill, nor sick, nor medically needy.  Sadly to say, greed caused
this problem.  And greed, my friends, is a very real enemy.  In lieu of only
blaming the government, why not those who abused their privilages?

Anyways, I encourage everyone to keep voting, but also to become much more
involved with what "our" government is doing.  Speak up or shut up, right? 

Love,

Troy J.

Ben is totally cool, surprisingly wise for 19, and I bet he'd make a great
roommate.  And if he moves up here, we'll get to see him more often.  ;)

Hello everyone!
Dano here.  Thanks to all who dropped in last Tuesday, we appreciate the
support and hope to see you again tonight.  For those of you who missed
us- we missed you!  And we hope you can come down 111 Minna st. for our
new weekly club called Fly! Featuring Dj's Dano & Keith plus weekly
guests.
The music will be eclectic but most likely a broad range of trippy house
with dashes of trance and a hint of techno!!! MMM....goood!  TNT Blast!
will be providing a live video mixing extravaganza which should be
superb! We will begin around 9:30 and hopefully will go until 2:30 or
3:00. Donations appreciated to help cover our costs.

We hope to see you all there showing your support and smiles :)
Feel free to contact me for answers.

Hi Jason-

 You are definitely right about the output level falling off towards the end of 
the tape.  I forgot to mention this to my friends who now have possesion of 
this tape.  The story behind this is that the phone rang during the last song, 
and instead of turning down the volume on the amp or just moving to another 
room, I lowered the level output on the channel that the song was coming 
through.  I guess you live and learn.  Anyway, I hope you enjoy the tape, and 
I'll probably have a new one ready soon in the future.
 And here is my two cents on this DJ mixtape idea.  I like it, but I'm way too 
busy right now to help organizing it.  Maybe some time down the road I'll be 
able to contribute.

-Todd

The original sample "Marijuana is the flame, heroin is the fuse, LSD is the
bomb." is from an old Dragnet episode.. =)  I was watching TV one day when I
saw this and laughed my ass off.  The episode is about the Dragnet cops
Friday and umm.. the other guy talking to someone who is supposed to be
Timothy Leary about LSD and drug use.  They spend the entire episode inside
his house in LA giving him a lecture on drugs..

It sounds like that old Radioactive Goldfish song that was popular in
early '92.  Other samples included "The world...is changing" and "The
beutiful world of lsd"  Somewhere I once saw the video, it had a bunch of
Koyanistaqsi clips in it.  I actually have this orange 12"!, along with 
Eon's "The spice must flow" and an autographed N-Joi 12"!!!!!

Yep. The illusion of democracy in the US seems stronger than the reality.

Excessive government intervention was (and is) bad.

Depends what "socialism" means. Communism is dead. Good riddance.
Socialism as in state-sponsored or community-sponsored welfare and
health is alive and well in most of the first world countries, and in
many parts of the USA. The Bay area has some excellent public housing
schemes, for example. Further afield, even 17 years of right-wing
rule in the UK has left the public health system in excellent
shape, along with housing and welfare schemes adequate for their
needs. If the British _conservatives_ see the need for socialist
measures, maybe socialism isn't such a bad thing after all?

That seems to equate "socialism" with "enormous hierarchy with tendils
into all parts of society". Given this definition, your comments about
"socialism" are true. But there are other forms of socialism which
aren't as sinister or dangerous.

What about the recently-announced welfare cuts? That doesn't seem like
the action of a government taking responsiblity for everything.

> for themselves.  

I don't think the government is to blame for this. It seems to be more
a function of the media pushing messages like "the problems of this
country are too big for you to do anything about" and "sit back in your
safe little house and we'll keep you happy".

What will become a living entity? Is it socialism itself, or big
government? The they are not the same thing.

Approach is everything. Communism approached socialism by means of
central control and big government, which proved to be a Bad Thing.
Western countries approach socialism by way of varying degrees of
democracy, which is by comparison a Good Thing.

hey happy ravers
   (and budding revolutionaries),

sorry to propogate such a totally NRR thread, but i've really gotta take
exception to some of this.

> we are still in the throws of socialism.  For all you socialists out there,
> it doesn't work and it never will.  History has clearly proven this. 

_that_ is a very sweeping statement and certainly needs a lot more support
to be convincing.

> It has lulled the masses into beleiving they are not responsible
> for themselves.  

IMO sounds like you're arguing for this sort of taxonomy: 

capitalism    (good)    = each person responsible for self
socialism     (bad)     = no person responsible for anybody

that's just silly - i don't think any rational political/economic theorist
would attempt to support socialism under that definition.  basically, that
set of definitions ends any debate on the merits of socialism by defining
socialism to be a system that by definition has no merits!

you might try this set of this definitions instead:

capitalism  = each person responsible only for self
socialism   = each person primarily responsible for self
               AND everyone responsible collectively for everyone
                     but within some limits

IMO it sounds like actually you are just objecting that in most socialist
societies these limits are too loose - that people don't have enough
individual freedom and too much communal responsiblity.  ok, fine.  where
to draw those lines is a damn good question.

but PLEASE don't just assume that anyone with socialist leanings secretly
desires a BIG BROTHER state that wipes their nose and makes their bed for
them.  it's quite frustrating to be misrepresented that way.  thanks!
matt.

Actually, there were quite a few wild parties last night.  Once we heard
you were going to Burning Man, the corks flew, the music started, and the
party... wait let me check, shit...it's still going on!  Who has time to
email when there's so much to celebrate!?

=)
Glad the BBQ a will be in attendance (and you too!).  Now to score some
heat resistant paint...hmmm...

Well put. My only disagreement with Wowser's post was the way it said
"socialism" when it meant "big brother government". Big brother
governments can be built on right-wing philosophies as well as
left-wing. Nazi Germany is a good example of the former.

The US government may be becoming a big brother government, but that is
nothing to do with socialism. There countries which are healthier
democracies than the US despite being far more left-leaning. Examples:
Germany (and most of europe) and Australia.

This is debate is infected with old cold-war propaganda: for decades
the we were taught that "communism/socialism = bad", so that now, when
certain people in the US see something "bad", they immediately label it
"socialist".

The brain's powers of association can be such a wonderful thing.  I don't
have a good
deck here at the house, so I find myself listening to my favorite mix tapes
while
driving about.  It completely changes my mood and reaction to the drivers
around
me.  All is well in the universe, as I find myself thinking of the
wonderful people
I have met and the special places we have created. BA DU BUM, BA DU BUM...

Take care,
                 Jason

Good day,

>>I need to clean some records, and I'm wondering what's the best tools for
 doing this.  >>Somebody told me that rubbing alcohol and a lint rag work,
but I'd  like to get other >>suggestions.  Thanx!

Some people go as far as to use purpose built machines that spin the
records
in a solution; some are alcohol based, some aren't.  Any contact with the
grooves on the records, including playing them, to some degree, can begin
to affect the sound quality of the records.  How far you are willing to
take this,
and how much you are willing to spend to keep your vinyl investment
maintained,
will vary greatly from person to person.  The type of paper sleves that
come with 
many records can also be detrimental, in terms of wear.  If you are
interested in
products regarding vinyl care, there is a neat mail order audiophile
company that 
offers free catalogs, Audio Advisor.  Their # is 1-800-451-5445.

Black Adder mentioned NOT TO USE COMMON DETERGENTS ON YOUR VINYL.

Here's another reason:  no one wants this residue building on their
expensive
                                  needles and in turn affecting even more
people's records

Take care,
                Jason

I think you can probally get it from an automotive place. Maybe a place
that is geared more toward race cars. I'm going to check on it. I also will
be putting cloth around it with lighter fluid and setting it on fire.

I'm glad you had such a wonderful introduction to the community.  You
couldn't have
asked for much better guides than Shawna and Matt for your first outing.  I
would
have liked to have gone to Chysalis this weekend, but a very special
birthday/house
party here in Sacramento was too good to pass up.  I wish more people could
host
such parties.  But, there tends to be too many finicky neighbors to always
make this
feasible.

Thought for the day:  Be tolerant of those around you 

Take care,
                Jason

Oh, you weren't at the SFraves meeting/party last night?? We decided that
we'd take it easy today after Andy Weatherall and Josh Wink showed up for
that surprise set. Thanks for the good time, guys!

ok, i remember learning about standing waves in high school physics, now 
im trying to remember teh formula for how to create a standing wave in a 
tube at a specific frequency. the variables go like this: frequency, 
volume of tube/length, something in coordination with wavelength... 

anyone?

Hi everyone! I hope you are all having a wonderful day, I certainly am. I
was just listening to this old hardcore tape I have called easy groove,
and I have also been jonesing for some faster music since that early
morning hardcore set at fnf, as well as the amazing set by sven vath 
at nikita a few months back...can anyone recomend some good FAST
stuff?...I am not really interested in some of the gabber people have
talked about with negative energy and negative lyrics...just something
that has fast<fast> and hard<hard> beats...thanks!

visualize it... the length of the tube has to be a multiple of the wavelength.

| )|
|( |
| )|
|( |
| )|
|( |

unless the tube is closed at one end, then it's a multiple of the
wavelength plus one-half of the wavelength.

I'm going to cross-post this to the list because it's desperately in need
of some traffic and the day is just c-r-e-e-p-i-n-g by.

BTW: tom, why are you asking?

lineup does look rad, but then again so did Juggernaut's....

Nation looks kinda iffy to me (judging by the info on the flyer); anyone
have any idea if they're previous parties were any good? If the sound
system being trucked in from all over is the main attraction, what does
that say about the other aspects?

I'm going to Hunny.

The only formula I can remember with out looking anything up is:

y=sin(kx-wt)

where k (wave number) is:
k=(2*pi)/lambda     (lambda is the wavelength)

and w (angular frequency) is:
w=(2*pi)/T          (T is the period)

x is the horizontal displacement
y is the vert. disp.
t is the time

Don't know that this will help much.  The formula for a standing wave in
a tube deals with harmonics and I don't remember the equation.

its an open tube, and now i need  teh wavelength formula. i cant believe 
how much of this stuff has rotted outa my brain... 
im trying to get a specific frequency to resonate, hence teh need for 
these little formulas.

I'll definitely be going to Nation, purely because I'm English and 2 of the
UKs top DJs are there (Sasha and John Digweed). It's worth going if only to
hear them spin, because they're amazing artists and technically brilliant
aswell. The rest of this event I feel doubtful about....especially after my
experience with Juggernaut this Saturday. However, Spundae have been known to
throw some pretty kicking parties, so who knows. It could be good, but I have
no expectations.
Yes, it will for sure be at Pier 45. This is a massive warehouse space that
has potential with the right decor, and it's really beautiful when the sun
rises over the water. 
Hope to see some of you there.
Love and light

Our tweaker neighbors upstairs are driving us nuts and although we love
our place and the area, I think it's time to move on.  It's getting really
old listening to them re-arrange their furniture every night.  So, if
anyone out there knows of any nice 1 bdrs. in the $900-$1100 range opening
up in the next month, I'd love to hear about it.  We need a place that
accepts cats, and parking and laundry would major pluses.  Yeah, I realize
the rental market *really* sux at the moment, but it seems most of the
better pads get snagged via word of mouth.

My fellow Americans (snicker), socialism = Big Brother Government.  

There is far too much greed and corruption for socialism to become anything
else.  The government is power hungry and only until recently have they
relented some of that power back to the states.  I praise the recent welfare
reforms!  Yahh!  But there is still a lot of work to do.  Taking care of
yourself and everyone else is a wonderous ideal and should be practiced.
But in this world, we need not be socialists to accomplish this.  It is more
a matter of genuine love and concern for your brothers and sisters.  To this
end, I know of many fantastic people who do just this!  

In my opinion, the only ones who deserve any type of subsidy are those who
are honestly and seriously disabled, widows and orphans.  When people talk
about taking government checks, they are talking about stealing money from
you and I and all other taxpayers.  The government has no money of its own,
rather it steals it from us.  I would gladly give SOME, but not for every
type of social program under the sun.  The US's "concerned" disguise in
recent years has done nothing but create generations whom are welfare
dependent and desire nothing better.  Why work when someone else will do it
for you and give you a percentage?  Thus, when I talk of socialism, I think
there is only one kind.  Big Brother Government.  Of course, it makes all
the self-proclaimed liberals out there feel better when they think they are
helping a problem by throwing my money at it.  But I think they are fooling
themselves.  People must work to survive here.  People must take individual
responsiblity before they can help others.  Why even God was reported to
say, "I can not help those who don't first help themselves".

I would be interested in hearing other's definitions of socialism.  But I
hope we can remain cool and just talk openly and without offense.  Take care
guys and gals and shine!!!!!! 

Love,

Troy J.

	Its just a resonant system, where the length of the tube has to be an 
integral multiple (or integral-and-a-half?  I think it depends on whether the 
tube is open or closed) of the wavelength.  Wavelength is related to frequency 
by the transmission speed, for instance the speed of sound.  Theres usually some 
tricky real-world stuff involved in driving the column correctly.

	So, for every tube, there is a set of frequencies, corresponding to 1, 
2, 3, etc wavelengths, which will resonate (ie, create standing waves). There 
may also be half and quarter-wave resonances, I can't remember exactly when.

Andrew

PS things get trickier if you need 2-D or 3-D waves, like for microwaves or 
some lasers, but I assume you're thinking about digereedoos or something where 
only one dimension is comparable to the wavelength.

[ seduced aain into posting to SFRaves ]

Hi Tom -

 Did some web searching:

 http://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/demobook/chapter3.htm

 has an experiment with sound waves in a pipe . The pipe is atteched to a 
supply of lab gas and there are holes drilled every inch or so. Theend
opposite the gas supply end has a loudspeaker attached in an airtight fashion. 
The gas coming out of the pinholes is lit, and the frequency of sound 
from the speaker is varied. The height of the flames mirror the intensity
of the standing wave at each hole location! Sounds like a neat ( but
dangerous ) sculpture for a rave!

 Experiment depends on speed of sound in methane, but the speed of sound
in ordinary air is given elsewhere on the page.


And - the mother of all didjeridu sites:

 http://www.mills.edu/LIFE/CCM/DIDJERIDU/didjeridu.homepage.html

 Calls itself the "Didjeridu WWW Server" . Has a link to didjeridu
construction, so they probably have a discussion of pipes and
acoustic standing waves and tones and such.

The amount of money that welfare reciepients are "stealing" from us
is extremely small compared to the amount of money the Pentagon and
related Defense Contractors are stealing from us.  the Pentagon does not even
want or need 150 or so new C-130 cargo planes yet the government is giving
them the money for them anyway.  Why is the government spending so much on 
the military?  When the time comes when the people decide that our government
needs to be ousted, they will use everything in their power to keep
power.  Bombs.  Rockets.  Missles.  Helicopters raining death.  Don't
think they would hesitate to use all of these against revolting Americans to 
keep their power.

Lets look beyond what the corperate-controlled media is spoon-feeding us
and determine the real problems in this country.  It sure as hell ain't
welfare recipients.  Remember that Media Coprerations are just Corperations,
and they will say whatever it takes to keep the laws in their favor.

Very sorry for the non-rave content, it will be my last public post on this
subject.

Thanks for the info.  It's encouraging.  I almost never watch television news anymore
due to their bias and lack of informative stories, prefering to fill broadcasts with 
emotional black holes.

I am not sure to what extent I believe anything that I see on television. 
Public TV's
news seems to be the only sector of this media form that at least makes an
attempt (?)
to represent both sides of a given story and foster a debate on the
subject.  I'm 
interested in hearing any of the specifics that may surface regarding this
incident.
If the people responsible for growing or selling marijuana for medicinal
purposes were
indeed involved in selling to the general public, then they ARE guilty of
jeopardizing
the health of those they were trying to help.  Greed is such an ugly thing.

Amen brother!

Well after reading some postes on socal raves, the event in LA is 37.50.
Tix through ticketmaster and the event in La includesMeat Beat Manifesto,
The
 Orb, Love & Rockets  and porno for pyros.  Still, if this is going to be
the line up for the event up here I'll save my cash for Burning Man(mostly
because all my cash is going into school and moving).

Peace

	When you get a secure netscape link, you're supposed to be able to track 
the crypto data which forms the basis for the security back to some "trusted" 
crypto data you already have.  A certificate is basically a bit of data which 
identifies who you are talking to and mentions a "certifying authority", who you 
should already trust.  You'll see this both in the security options, which I 
think are the ones you already trust (didn't know that? :-), and in 
"view->document info" when you have a secure connection.

Andrew

PS actually this is the "secure sockets layer", which is not 
netscape-proprietary.  If you want to know more look up ISO standard X.509.

This is true only in systems like communism where there are inadequate
checks and balances on power. Socialism within a democracy does not
necessarily imply big government. Example: in New Zealand,
state-subsidised health and housing are administered by corporations
separate from the government and administration. These corporations are
run along lines which would make Wall Street proud. Bosses get bonuses
according to how efficiently they deliver services.

Ok, here we get down to splitting hairs of definition. IMHO, if a
society has a sufficiently large number of people doing as you suggest,
then that society *is* a form of socialism.

This is a tricky issue: how do we help people without discouraging them
from helping themselves? I don't have the answer, but I'm deeply
suspicious of simple answers like simply giving up and saying "we won't
give out welfare because that'll just make them lazy". Cutting back on
welfare is false economy: it increases poverty and crime, which may
well end up costing each of us more than welfare taxes ever did.

Sure! Personally, I agree with much of what you are saying, it's just
that I think you're applying the wrong label ("socialism") to what we
both don't like: manipulative, interfering government.

Greed and corruption is not unique for socialism. It actually perverst any
polital system known to man (and religion, this one especially for you)

Let's first see how they work out. We might be in for some surprises since
there will a lot of people without money and not all of them may find a
job that easy.

I'm glad you think so.

Which is what socialism was originally based upon, love for the people that
the rich and mighty didn't seem to care for. As with any system, it has its
problems.

>To this end, I know of many fantastic people who do just this!

It's hard to see this work for an entire nation though.

Where I'm from, the government allows people to be unemployed for a period of
time, to get either their act together, get an education, apply for jobs. It
gives people time to breath. It will certainly be misused by some but then
again
also many people try to pay less taxes then they're supposed to and nobody
seems to have problems with that. As a European, it seems that many of
the social problems in the US actually have to do with the lack of any social
safety net leaving no other option than crime to survive. I'm still
fascinated by how fast somebody can go from being an average working
class person to being homeless here, just by misfortune, not being able
to pay insurance etc.

In Holland we feel that each of us can fall back on welfare in case we
get in to some sort of trouble (lose our jobs, get sick etc.) We all
pay for it and in case we need it, it is there for all of us.

> The government has no money of its own, rather it steals it from us.

Ah, a freeman. Well, some of that money is also used to your benefit I
would say, to build schools, roads etc. You wouldn't want to do that all
by yourself, would you? That's the idea, everybody contributes some and
we all profit by more safety, quality of life etc.

That's why you are allowed to vote.

I wonder how many people are really happy with living on welfare. Although
I don't know the exact numbers I'd say its usually just enough to get by
on. Have _you_ ever lived a "luxurious" life on welfare?

Because you will have little money to spend/get bored/meet no people etc.?

And when I think of Big Brother Government I think of Watergate, laws that
try to restrict the Internet, what people do with their own lives and
deaths, that sells your country's nature to Disney and MacDonalds etc.
Every political system has its drawback's but you're problems seem more
to be with:

Your hard earned money. And what about those bad self-proclaimed conservatives
who feel better when they think they are helping a problem by cutting off
the money. Both have their (dis)advantages, calling names doesn't help and
usually simple solutions to complicated problems don't work.

> But I think they are fooling

Yep, survival of the fittest, may the rest rot in hell.

But then again God seems to be the most powerless being in the universe
judging by the state the world is in.

The "self-proclaimed liberals out there" really gave you away in my eyes.

OK...I am getting some idea...but what does it mean that i "trust" these
people? Do yhey have a site certificate to my site(computer), if so, what

	This is getting off raves, but basically the web is very client-server 
oriented so "they" don't really get any access you don't give to them, either by 
putting something in a form or executing a Java applet (or a Javascript...).  


	The basic idea to to prevent malicious third parties from interfering 
with or watching your session.  You have to trust someone to tell you you're 
talking to who you think you are ("on the Internet, no-one knows you're a dog"). 
Your browser comes with a certain amount of built-in trust (how sweet :-).

	You don't have a certificate unless you go to a certifying authority and 
get one (this is a real-world process, usually involving $$$ except for PGP).  
In the web, you don't have much use for one unless you run a server.  If I 
understand correctly the browser does generate and give the server something 
called a "session key", but its not valid after a short period and in any case 
isn't used for "incoming" connections (on the client).

Andrew

PS If your browser and the server are both from the same vendor, and use some 
proprietary and possibly secret protocol to exchange info, all bets are off.  
Beware large monopolistic corporations headquartered in the NW US with geeky 
guys named Bill running them.  This is not an official SCO position, Bill.

STATEMENT FROM DANIEL S. GOLDIN, NASA ADMINISTRATOR

     "NASA has made a startling discovery that points to the
possibility that a primitive form of microscopic life may
have existed on Mars more than three billion years ago.  The
research is based on a sophisticated examination of an ancient
Martian meteorite that landed on Earth some 13,000 years ago.

     The evidence is exciting, even compelling, but not
conclusive.  It is a discovery that demands further
scientific investigation.  NASA is ready to assist the
process of rigorous scientific investigation and lively
scientific debate that will follow this discovery.

     I want everyone to understand that we are not talking
about 'little green men.'  These are extremely small, single-
cell structures that somewhat resemble bacteria on Earth.
There is no evidence or suggestion that any higher life form
ever existed on Mars.

     The NASA scientists and researchers who made this
discovery will be available at a news conference tomorrow to
discuss their findings.  They will outline the step-by-step
"detective story" that explains how the meteorite arrived
here from Mars, and how they set about looking for evidence
of long-ago life in this ancient rock.  They will also
release some fascinating images documenting their research.

NASA BRIEFING WEDNESDAY ON DISCOVERY OF POSSIBLE EARLY MARTIAN LIFE

        A team of NASA and Stanford scientists will discuss
its findings showing strong circumstantial evidence of
possible early Martian life, including microfossil remains
found in a Martian meteorite, at a news conference scheduled
for 1:00 p.m. EDT, August 7, at NASA Headquarters, 300 E. St.
SW, Washington, DC.  The team's findings will be published in
the August 16 issue of Science magazine.

        Panelists will be:

-  Dr. Wesley Huntress, Jr., NASA Assoc. Administrator for Space
Science,
         Washington, DC
-  Dr. David McKay, principal author, NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC),
         Houston, TX
-  Dr. Everett Gibson, NASA JSC, Houston, TX
-  Dr. Richard N. Zare, Professor of Chemistry, Stanford University, CA
-  Kathy Thomas-Keprta, Lockheed-Martin, JSC, Houston, TX
-  Dr. William Schopf, Professor, Department of Earth and Space
Sciences,
         Univ. of California, Los Angeles

       The briefing will be carried live on NASA TV with two-
way question-and-answer capability for reporters covering the
event from participating NASA centers.  Audio of the
broadcast will be available on voice circuit at the Kennedy
Space Center by calling 407/867-1260.

       NASA Television is broadcast on Spacenet 2,
transponder 5, channel 9, C-Band, located at 69 degrees West
longitude, with horizontal polarization.  Frequency will be
on 3880.0 megahertz, with audio on 6.8 megahertz.

Good day,

>Hey Jason, was this the party at this girl's apt. in Sacramento? Curious...if it was, did 
>you get a chance to hear Pankaj spin, he's an Indian guy.  I went to school with him.
	
The lineup was in two rooms, one upstairs(like a bedroom), and the main dining area
that opened up into the living room.  It was in the heart of downtown Sacto .  I think I remember 
someone who looked Indian spinning, but I really wasn't keeping track of who was on the 
decks.  And I only ventured upstairs to see where the stairs led to, finding a small room with 
about six people crashed or curled up together in the early morning hours.  Biojeff spun around 
1 am and again, later in the morning.  Louie was on when I split to have a few beers out on 
Jeff's balcony (remember his name because Sheri, the birthday girl, was trying to get the group 
I found in the back room motivated to dance).  We were a bit busy passing around some 
morning organics :)  Amy Starkey and Melanie did most of the decorations and set up the 
altar (GREAT JOB).  If this sounds like it, and he spun the downstairs, what time did he go
on?  How do you pronounce his name?  I hate butchering people's names.

Take care,
                    Jason

  Maybe not the recipients themselves, but the system that perpetuates

  to be questioned.  Doling out more checks constantly sure as hell isn't
  the answer, that's been proven.  How to solve this problem is another
  debate for another venue...

Alright. . .I admit it- I flaked on MAD last night.
I was really looking forward to going, then all this emotionally draining
stuff fell on me and left me with little energy to do anything, and certainly
not enough to go out and dance with.
To be honest, I am still feeling wiped out.
UG!

best wishes to anyone who did make it out there and had a good time. . 
BTW, who is all going to Hunny?

Last summer at a Berkeley house party I randomly met a guy named Pankaj, 
a dj from New York, who was out here on vacation.  I was going to New York for 
vacation in a few months, and got his number so he could escort me through the scene out there.  However, by the time New 
York came around, the little scrap of paper with his number on it had 
long since been lost.  I found raves/clubs/dj stores on my own in my week 
in New York :).  

This summer a friend of a friend, who I've never met before, moves out here 
from New York.  She likes to rave.  We all coordinate an evening out - she's 
in San Francisco but calls to ask me could I pick up her friend in 
Berkeley?  He is also visiting from New York - he's a dj named Pankaj.  

Then, I get on the internet today, and find a post from _another_ New 
Yawka, who is also connected to, the same, Pankaj (pronounced Punk-age).

Random coincidence, or proof of the invisible web that connects us 
all...?  It's a small world after all!

(Glad to hear he got to spin out here!)

	Yeah, isn't it ironic that the military-industrial complex can seem like 
the most successful form of socialism in this country.  So is it better to 
generate bombs or bums?  There is always another way...

Geez, it's only Tuesday and we're all debating how we're going to party 
on the weekend!!  Are there some impatient people out there, or what??! ;)

First of all: Nation
This line-up looks like a once-in-a-great-while opportunity.  I have 
NEVER gotten to see any English dj's but I have heard from more than 
one Brit that these two are the shit (all of these people have also 
bagged on the e we get, but that's another story...)

I don't know how this is going to fare on the underground-feel scale 
(probably quite low!), but Spundae the Club does know how to throw a 
PARTY!  I went to both their Labor Day and Memorial Day extravanganzas, 
and they did not disappoint.  Awesome dj's, awesome sound, decorations in 
the club, and, after the 2AM drinking crowd left, a true happy feeling of 
those who came just to dance and have FUN.  Two of the best nights out 
dancing I have had.

Spundae HAS thrown some "raves."  The last Nation was last summer 
(remember the hype?).  $25, but I heard from those that went that the 
music and the night and even the people were totally worth it.  Does 
anyone know of any other Spundae "raves"?  I think there were a couple...

(P.S. Advance sale on this party is $20.  Also may be a different crowd 
(more clubby and older) than the teens that were targeted for Jugg).


Nikita - Carl Cox and 10-Year Anniversary

Whoa, everyone!  This is 1015's 10-Year Anniversary!  This is a club with 
money to burn and I have a feeling they're going to do it up for this 
night.  The lasers and sound and production are all top just for their 
average Friday night.  But lots of promotion means huge club crowds, and they're 
also bringing back club favorite dj's from over the years...a glance at the 
flyer shows Top40-type house dj's, hiphop and even 70's/oldskool flava.  
This looks like a night of sound nostalgia, NOT cutting-edge dance 
(except maybe Carl Cox?).

But what interests me is the historical meaning implicit in this club's 
10-year anniversary.  Although those of us who know the underground - 
where we are treated to the newest, most exciting music - would scoff at the idea of 1015 as 
revolutionary, the fact is that this club's presence in our beautiful 
city introduced this area to a LOT of dance music over the years.  
Without clubs like 1015 dedicated to (for the club scene) 
purer, less commercialized dance music, I think our scene and movement 
would be less vibrant and thriving as it is today.  1015 opened in 1986 
(just when techno-dance was really emerging) and provided a home for it 
in the mainstream world of danceclubs.  (I know there are many small 
weeklies, monthlies, etc., around - but I'm thinking of 1015's role 
as a major danceclub in a major city).  1015 has also played host to 
Wicked and Come-Unity, among other raveclubs.  What if no clubs were 
gutsy enough to play this music?  What if all of them were like those 
awful little bars I went to last week-end in the Triangle, where all the 
party people thought that dancing to "Wild Thing" was the ultimate?!!

Aside from Spundae, Nikita's the only real mainstream weekly I can think 
of that plays the music I want to dance to.

Then there's the other option...

Hunny!  All I know is any party whose flyer has an orgasmic Piglet on it 
has got to be good!!  This is the first party put on by one of the 
members of the extended Harmony family...recommendation enough to me.  
(Oh yeah, DJ Dan!).

Who's doing what this weekend?

Been Flaking at Work Way Too Much Today,
Nancy :)

Does anyone know?

Is F-8 indoors or out in nature (as usual)...?  The line-up is kickin', 
but I don't like cold, dark beaches at night!
And do we HAVE to get tix beforehand at F-8 (complain, complain).  I live 
over the water and far away....

I called them earlier; 200 presale tix, and that's it. Nothing at the 
door, so get your dollar ready for the bridge :) The party's indoor, 
but I don't know where.

Hunny's looking good for this weekend, esp. in light that Mars and
Myster-E will be at Wish this Wednesday.

I'll be at Hunny this Friday.  The line-up is awesome...  (Dan, Cloud,
Greg, etc.)  I like the fact that this party has not only some 
dare-i-say big djs, but also some lesser known ones as well.  For
those of you who haven't heard Cloud, Greg, or Gerlando Piro spin
before, now is your chance  =)  

The music should be incredible and diverse... (not just 
Techno OR House OR Breakbeat OR Whatever... But a good mixture) 
I have a strange feeling that the music's gonna kick my ass  =)

The people throwing Hunny care about the scene and aren't just 
out there to make a quick buck (don't worry, i'm not saying the 
other parties this weekend are).  So I'm going to go support them...

I'm ready to dance up a storm  ;)  and I hope to meet more SFRavers
while I'm there...

you have to distinguish between socialism as economic policy and as social
policy. in Sweden, for example, you pay higher taxes, but your children
actually get an education... the US has the _lowest_ Quality of Living
Index of any industrialized nation. the US is also the most capitalistic,
and one of the most socially restrictive.

the dictators in this country are the capitalists... the 20 or so
corporations that control 95% of the media, and the other large companies
whose owners/executives also are involved in the ownership/control of those
media corporations. (see Noam Chomsky's _Manufacturing Consent_.) all of
the "socialist" policies in this country are facades set up to make you
think that the poor are being helped... but the rich keep getting richer,
the poor keep getting children, and the media keep indoctrinating us to
think that everything's going to be okay.


my point is that capitalism, not socialism, has led to the forces that keep
us oppressed. remember that all of our "socialist" policies were enacted by
governments, which (whatever they might have said on TV) were absolutely
beholden to large corporate interests.

all this IMHO, of course.

very true.

also, the _total_ amount of money (adjusted for inflation, blah,blah,blah)
that the government has _ever_ spent on welfare is _less_ than the amount
of money that it is currently spending on the S&L bailout.

no one said they have a good life, but these people arent out looking for 
jobs to improve their lifes. I live in a very high welfare part of 
oakland, and i can see what goes on, and what they do. absolutly nothing, 
no one works, crime is still high, eveny with throwing tons of money at 
it. if giving people money doesnt help, then how about taking it away? 
what else are we left with? huh? giving more money? yeah right. get 
people off welfare, have them get jobs (which there are plenty of), and 
get them to function in society. things will be hard for about a 
generation, but people will learn how to live when the government isnt 
there supporting you not to work.

Not at all! I have had a lot of good times at 1015 a couple of years 
back. Anyone remember Boogie Buffet? Nice.....

It's been a while since I took physics, but here it goes.

My favorite Disney cartoon has always been Winnie the Pooh!!!...so
of course I'm going to go and seek out the Hunny this Friday. I like 
all the characters but my favorite has to be piglet. 

I posted this back in May I think after hearing that there was gonna
be an upcoming party called "Honey". I had thought that the promoters
had thought of the idea for their party from a movie called "My Dinner
with Andre" which is about Andre's (a playwrite) realizations about life
thru leading an improvisational theatre group. The way he describes what
happens at these plays in the movie, you would swear he's talking about
a rave!! It's weird but the quote even seems to fit the "Tao of Pooh"
too! Check this trippy movie out...it's well worth it.

Here's the excerpt from the video "My Dinner with Andre". The setting is
a restaurant and a famous playwrite, Andre Gregory, is having dinner 
with his friend Wallace Shawn. Their conversation is about Andre's
experiences at Finhorn (SP?) where people are able to grow plants in
soil that has no nutrients in it all among other scientifically
unexplainable phenomena and also about his experience at leading an
improvisational play with beatiful music in a Polish forrest with people
who could not speak English. When you read it, think to yourself of the
reasons why YOU go to raves?

Peace and Love,
John

----

Andre to Wallace:

"Finhorn people see it a little differently, they're feeling that there
will be these pockets of light springing up in different parts of the
world and that these will be in a way invisible planets on this planet,
and it as we or the world grow colder we can take invisible space
journeys to these different planets, refuel for what it is what we need
to do on the planet itself and come back. It's their feeling that there
have to be centers now where people can come and re-construct a new
future for the world and when I was talking to Gustav Bjornstron, he was
saying that actually these centers were growing up everwhere now and
what they're trying to do, which is what Finhorn was trying to do, and
in a way which was what I was trying to do...I mean these things can't
be given names but in a way these are all attempts at creating a new
kind of school or a new kind of monastery and Bjornstron talks about the
concept of reserves - ISLANDS OF SAFETY where history can be remembered
and the human being can continue to function in order to maintain the
species thru a dark age. In otherwords we're talking about an
UNDERGROUND, which did exist in a different way during the dark ages
among the mystical orders of the church ... and the purpose of this
underground is find out how to preserve the LIGHT ... LIFE! The culture!
How to keep things living! You see, I keep thinking that what we need is
a new language ... a language of the HEART, a language as in the Polish
forrests where language wasn't needed, some kind of language between
people that is a new kind of poetry, thats the poetry of the dancing bee
that tells us where the HUNNY is! And I think that in order to create
that language you're going to have to learn how you can go thru a
looking glass into another kind of perception where you have that sense
of being UNITED to all things ... and suddenly ... you understand
everything!

My comment on this thread (just throwing some kindling on the fire):

  There is a general sentiment here that people on welfare ought to "get
a job" (to paraphrase).  Who determines whether these people are
contributing to the world?  In my opinion, every person is important
regardless of whether or not they choose to contribute to this "society"
by having a job.  As a worker, I am happy to see my tax dollars going
towards subversive (whether intentional or not) behavior in the form of
non-working people.  Much happier than when I see my tax dollars going
towards bombing foreign countries.

  (well... if there wasn't a wiretap on my line before, there will be
shortly!)

>My comment on this thread (just throwing some kindling on the fire):
hmm. i'll toss some on myself.. =)

the US spends more than twice as much money on "defense" spending than its
four greatest threats combined (iraq, iran, russia, and china, i think..)
(don't ask me to back up this statistic, i'm too lazy to go find the source.
besides, it should be blatently obvious). is it really neccessary? didn't we
live long enough under the shadow of the cold war to realize that "to
prevent war, we must prepare for war" is an oxymoron? didn't the recent
rejection of the US's cryptography postition by a group of scholars who were
allowed to see the gov'ts top secret cypto-scare presentation have any
impact on anything?

regarding socialism: socialist policies exist (social safety nets, health
care, welfare, etc..) because people, in general, don't give a fuck about
anyone but themselves. it is wonderful that some people can go beyond this
(read Wealth, by andrew carnegie), but don't expect because you can see a
better way to live means that everyone will necessarily follow it. communism
had the best intentions in the world, it was unworkable, and people took
advantage of that fact. capitalism seems to be workable only because it is
self-propagating. but how long can it last, before it ruins the world?

i, for one, would be much happier to live in a more "socialist" country than
the US. i grew up in canada, i can understand what a great thing it is to
have a state health program. i've seen people not go to the doctor, simply
because they couldn't afford to. that disgusts me. "every man was created
equal", until capitalism, where money can buy you rights. socialism is an
attempt to right the scales between the haves and the have-nots, restoring
the idea that every man is created equal. universal access to the basic
needs of human living: food, shelter, medical attention, etc... our world is
so unbelievably fucked up - where there aren't enough jobs to go around, or
even if they were, they wouldn't be the jobs that someone desired or would
enjoy (see: emotional income). something is wrong with the world. punishing
people for being born into a system they can't cope with by stomping out
welfare isn't the answer.  superficial solutions are not what is needed.

going back to canada, before i moved to the us, my home province of ontario
had just elected a new, right-wing conservative govenment. fueled by
selfish, individualistic memes oozing north across the border, the tories
(nickname for the progressive conservatives -- an oxymoron!) proceeded to
slash every social program they could get their hands on. and don't think
they were motivated by what the people wanted, they were pushed by big
business. the government proceeded to give out special favours to it's
friends, privatizing Pierson International Airport in Toronto, which was
making millions of dollars for taxpayers, as an example. but, as seen,
governments are not responsive to the people, they are responsive to MONEY;
specifically the money of big corporations. don't think for a second that it
is otherwise.

anyway, i'm just going off here.. i'm not bagging on anyone.

everyone from the US should realize, though, that the US is not the greatest
country in the world merely because the media and the educational system
portray it as so. take a long, hard look at what the US does, in matters of
foreign policy as well as internal, and decide for yourself.

Personally, I could care less if they have a job or not. I just don't 
want *my* job to have to pay for their lack of one. Welfare is a trap. It 
rewards women having litters of children, and promotes failure as a way 
of life.

Personally, I could care less if they have a job or not. I just don't 
want *my* job to have to pay for their lack of one. Welfare is a trap. It 
rewards women having litters of children, and promotes failure as a way 
of life.

Well said. That pretty much sums up it.

Oops. I meant to say sums it up. :)

Are you serious?  There are "plenty of jobs out there?"  

Did you know  that most jobs get dozens of  applicants?  And that most
people spend months looking for a job before they find one?  And that
people spend months, sometimes years, in temporary employment with no
health insurance or retirement benefits?

It seems to me that around here, the  ONLY industry where there are plenty
of jobs is the computer industry.

Please correct me if I'm wrong.  And if you know of any openings out
there, do let me know.

Looking for work myself,

Ann

I went to the nation party last year. It was on Saturday July 3 at the Sound
factory. I had hesitations about going to the Sound Factory on a Saturday
Night for starters. I had even more hesitation about going to the Sound
Factory on a Saturday night of a holiday weekend? I tried talking various
friends into going, but the conscenses was SoundFactory Satuday night 4th o'
July weekend, NAUGHT! The lineup was Lil Louie with Kenny Dope, followed by
CJ McIntosh, with Sasha closing. I went around midnight. The place was packed
with every cologne and perfume wearing clubber in the city and surrounding
locals. I don't remember there even being much of a line to get in, which is
a bonus in going to an event like this. I found it hard to dance early on
lots of beer swilling cologne and perfume types standing around. But the
dynamic duo was laying down those phat NY salsa house grooves that can sweep
away any bad vibe. Keeping mind and body focused on the music instead o' the
crowd was the key at this point in the night. Around two CJ came on playing
his female vocal and horn drenched house thang. This is not my favorite genre
o' house music but the bar closed and the crowd that goes with it slowly
dwindled. I found myself taking a breather on the risers off to the side and
found myself perfectly possitioned behind this pole which diverted the lasers
that were pointed at me. The laser light just missing my eyes and yet still
surrounding my field o' vision. Way cool, probably had to be there then?
First feelings o' tiredness, ho hum? Anyway five o'clock Sasha hits the
decks. Lets CJ's last Horn drenched house track dwindle to the last groove
and floats into some swishy ambient thang which gradually builds with some
tribal type acoustic drumming into tribal dance and gradually upping the bpm
into heavy harder deeper progressive hard house verge o' acid trance sick
shit continuing back through the progressive groove tribal drum swish ebb
flow ebb flow ebb flow... What the fuck just happenned 7AM lights on party
over whoa!!!!! Creatively and musically the best set I heard in 1995. I will
be going to see Sasha again this year. I've heard similar tales of Carl Cox
last year also at the Sound factory. This is a music appreciation thang not a
squishy melt down hug me and my fuzzy bear kind o' scene. Big Sound, Big
Visuals, Big Bucks. I'll save my squishy bear hugging for the New Moon?  ; )
  Have a great night, PEACE! Cid

Yes, it remains an evil necessity. The biggest single threat to the 
U.S. today aside from terrorist attack, is China. In a non-nuclear 
scenario, with a population over a billion people and a fairly advanced 
military, they would probably wipe the proverbial floor with us. 

Ponder this: The U.S. currently offers most favored nation trading status to
             a country that is one of the biggest perpetrators of human 
             rights violations in the world, practices infanticide, and 
             and violates any copyright they feel like. Is this the
             action of a country that doesn't have anything to fear?

I don't remember a proposal to "stomp out" welfare. I do remember a 
proposal to cut it off after a person has been on it 5 *years* Currently, 
there are people living off of welfare all of their lives, and are having 
children, that know nothing different, and also end up on welfare. The 
situation tends to be very cyclic, and needs to be dealt with. People in the 
system are losing their work ethic, if they had one to start with, because 
they are not made to do *anything* for the money they receive. I would like 
to see more vocational training within the system, to lessen the myth that 
you have to have a 4 year degree to suceed in America. 

What do you propose that will solve these problems?

Hello all...
I was wondering if anyone out there has a software BPM counter for the Macintosh - one that you can hook up an audio source to, not just tap the mouse button or return key every beat (I have one of those if anyone is interested - it's shareware).  If nobody has one, does anybody know if such an animal exists?  Thanks!

exactly.
it is a really oldfashioned misconception to assume things would get 
any better if everybody just worked harder. 
to see that people, *ravers*, on this list still hang on this belief 
and consider it a goal to _'function in society'_ and persecute everybody who 
doesn't touches me quite strangely. yeah really, how can a *raver* be sooo 
convinced that working, in the sense of 'getting a job', like, at mc donalds 
or somewhere,is the ultimate way to spend your life? 
who says that you have to justify your existence by struggling and working 
yourself to death? 
normally you don't earn money by making the world a nice place for 
everybody, but by producing needless stuff, talking people into buying 
needless stuff, do research in the name of progress (a concept that is
totally questionable nowadays), generally by contributing to the 
limitless growth that is a consequence of capitalist economy and 
inevitably fucks the world up. i mean, hey, how many of you actually bake 
bread or teach children (or other sweet things to think of) to make a living?
*i don't*.
i think somebody who doesn't work might actually cause less overall damage 
than somebody who does. 

concerning the socialism definitions that are around, IMO it is not 
accurate to define it by some fuzzy social security criteria.
socialism is a type of  economy and thus the definition is in 
terms of economy: 
     socialism = state owns the main means of production. 
this was the difference between socialist and capitalist countries, 
everything else moreless being just a consequence of this feature.
(btw, communism then means: _everybody_ owns the main means of production.
ask me how that is supposed to work...)
since the factories and everything are state property, there is no 
competition between several providers of a certain product. the 
consequences are
a) possible bad quality of the product and unsufficient 
supply 
b) the state as the proprietor of the factory doesn't have to worry about 
fighting any competitors. that means, there is no need of reinvesting all 
the profits into  production, no need to shower the country with stupid 
advertising campaigns, no need to fire people for the sake of 
efficiency,no need for growth to make more and more profits. instead, the 
gains can partially be used for social things, for education, culture, 
health care, whatever.
c) no big winners. no jet set. 

c) - boring. life -> grey.
a) -  very bad. gaps in supply of jelly bears, no cool clothes. life -> grey.
b) - kind of a neat idea. only if there is no pressure of 
possibly loosing ones job and everything, some people tend to get lazy and 
stop giving a shit on doing their work ok -> gaps in supply of jelly bears...
i think that's why they tried to replace that non existing economic 
pressure by political pressure, but i'm not sure.
i still wonder why things started getting so weird and wether it 
would be possible to have socialism without all that ideology and big brother 
nuisance.
ok, so much for politics.

finally, remember what is said about the cute little birds and can't be 
wrong for ravers :
they don't seed, they don't harvest, and the Lord feeds them anyway.

That's very sweet.  Very philosophical and very unrealistic.  Tell ya what, 
let's have one of these folks, randomly picked from the general population, 
move into your house.  This person will eat your food, sleep in your bed (no 
sex!), use your stuff, and lead any kind of life they want.  They don't have 
to get a job or pay rent.  They can sell drugs if that's what they choose to 
do.  Or they can just sit around watching your TV all day.  Doesn't much 
matter, since you're supporting them.

Now, since I think we can safely assume that you'll tire of this arrangement 
fairly quickly, let's do this instead:

We'll let this person move in to your house and we'll pay for this person to 
get training.  This arrangement will last for a finite period of time, say 
2.5 years.  During this time, this person cannot be convicted of any 
felonious crimes, or the entire deal is off.  They have 2.5 years to get an 
AA degree or certification or both.  If this person has children, we pay for 
daycare while they're going to school.  Then we give a business some kind of 
incentive to hire this person, say arranging a tax writeoff for at least 2 
years of employment.  And then they're out on their own.  During that 2 year 
employment stint, either the business or the new employee can exercise the 
right to have a counselor made available to the new employee to help them in 
ironing out any problems adjusting.  This would be a one time offer.  And 
after that, that person is cut off from the dole for a minimum of 7 years. 
Sound expensive?  Definitely, in the short term, but immensely cheaper than 
supporting this individual for his/her entire life.  And the fact that they 
only have this free ride for a short time gives them vast incentive to make 
the most of it.

Y'know, Welfare was never supposed to carry people throughout their lives; 
an honor system was assumed.  Well, that fell apart, didn't it?  And now 
we've got people who look at Welfare as their God-given right.  It's time we 
yanked the nipple out of these people's mouths, looked them in the eye, and 
said, "Y'know, I like you and all, but you've *got* to start pulling your 
own weight."

"Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day.  Teach him to fish, and you 
feed him for a lifetime."

Poverty is also a trap. Would you rather that *your* job payed for more
police, more prisons, and higher insurance premiums caused by people
stealing? I strongly suspect that slashing welfare is false economy,
and i've yet to see a strong argument against this.

To put it another way: handing out welfare is arguably undesirable from
a moral viewpoint, but is quite possible that it is a position of
minimum harm to society as a whole.

Uhhh....hello? Isn't this exactly what is happening now? Is the crime 
rate going down, is the standard of living increasing? 40 years ago one 
income families are the norm, now two income families are struggling to 
get by. Social (IN)security is a pipedream for most of us as it will be 
bankrupt by 2009(if memory serves.) Perhaps you are equating block-grants 
being given to the individual states with doing away with welfare 
altogether, which is simply not the case.

Anyone seen the flyer for "Megga Buzz One?" It's some huge-ass party that's
supposed to be happening at the end of this month.

What's the deal with these people? The flyer is almost ALL TEXT. Dj
listings, more lighting crews than I care to remember, a "ravemart" area
with vendors and water for sale (???), essays on "small party vibe with
5000+ people" and a paragraph explanation for why they didn't print the
location on the flyer ("It would, like, spoil the surprise if you guys knew
where it was"). Plus the fact that they named it Mega Buzz One, like
there'll be a Two or a Three...

kinda scary. Anyone remember Cyberfest?

wow. what makes you believe china has an interest in doing so?
how would that look like? thousands of little yellow critters coming over 
the ocean in their small little boats/airplanes and wipe the floor with 
*you*?
(seriously. is there any evidence they intend to start threaten the us?
please inform me.)
i mean, hey. are you sure you aren't a victim of your chief ideologists 
desperately blatant attempt to replace the byegone enemy in order to 
justify further spending your beloved *taxpayers money* on 'defense'? 
selling weapons to the government has become a pillar of economy in the us
(and they pay quite well for those airplanes and tanks), 
like in a bunch of other countries, and i imagine things would start looking 
quite shitty if this pillar ceased to exist.
so, are you sure the necessity for those chinese's plan to invade 
the us doesn't lie somewhere in there?

why didn't they offer that status to the late soviet union than?
unfortunately i don't have the top ten of the biggest human rights 
violators in the world available right now, but i think there are more reasons
beyoind sheer dismay why there is so much about infanticide and human 
right violations in china in the media. 
check out the turks for more interesting, really disgusting human rights 
violations. just for example. and did you know they still kill people for 
being said to be witches in south africa. 
so where's the great brouhaha about that? does it mean the us fear those 
countries if they don't lay embargos on them or invade them right on the spot?

Wasn't Cyberfest that god-awful event out in Pleasanton a few years ago?  
That ran me out of the scene for several months!  Even my poor karman 
ghia hated it, broke down and refused to go anywhere after that -- it was 
so mad at me.  Had to catch a cab back to s.f. at 3:00 am after it shut 
down!

Sure, these things are bad.  What i was trying to say was that reducing
welfare could well make the crime situation go downhill faster, with
even more crime-related costs.

That may be the case, but that is not an argument against the
principle of welfare, only a particular system for providing it.

No i'm not. I'm talking about the measures to limit eligibility for

Sure, it may be ugly. But it's not clear that cutting welfare
will improve the situation.

  Here's my objection, though your argument is interesting.  There are not
so many people out there that each of us has to support one or more of
them alone.  I give a small portion of my paycheck up to a pool, and that
pool is used to support thousands of people.  The tax/welfare system is a
far better system than each of us trying to support another individual.
It does make me sad that many of these people, liberated from the bullshit
working lifestyle, turn to non-stop TV, or violence, or crime, instead of
pursuing more positive interests.  But I still am happy to pay my small
share to support them.

  Okay, very nice.  In the real world, however, there are people who can't
find jobs.  Or who will find a short-term job every once in awhile, but
end up spending more than seven years in total on welfare and get cut off.
How do you deal with the fact that we live in a bigoted society, where
someone who is black, or female, or ugly (by society's standards) may have
a hard time or find it impossible to find work. 
  Also, there are people who don't want to work.  I'm all for that.  And
there are people who are not willing to work below their skill levels, who
demand that a job meet their needs.  And I'm all for that too.  Nobody
should *have* to work in a miserable environment.

Personally, I could care less if they have a job or not. I just don't
want *my* job to have to pay for their lack of one. Welfare is a trap. It
rewards women having litters of children, and promotes failure as a way
of life.

  This is also talking about social security as if it came out of a
seperate pocketbook than that which pays for the military.  The social
security program may go bankrupt assuming that we continue to hand
billions and billions (is it into the trillions yet?  Can't remember) to
the "defence" industry, and don't increase funding to social security,
and... 
  Suffice it to say, that's a bogus statistic.

  In fact, cutting welfare would only make these people POORER, and would
thus have a tendency to increase crime rates, infant mortality, etc.  The
only obvious solution (since there are NOT enough jobs, and I will stand
by that!) is to *increase* the amount they recieve.  The problem is that
this goes rather strongly against the morals/ideals of the capitalist
founders and rulers (and citizens, but that's not important) of this
country.

Megga Buzz One  is from Feelgood Entertainment.   These guys (and gals, I
assume) regulate the Buzzline and are associated with COOL WORLD.  Im not
saying that massives are BAD, nor that Feelgood Ent. is out for the money. 
But can we say coroperate rave???
Actually, I  my intrduction to the scene was @ one of thoses massives in LA
in 1990.  So in a sense, massives like Megga Buzz have thier niche in the
underground...  even if does, at times, cast a negative light on the scene
sometimes...

Well what kind of oils do you use? I know lotion sucks, if you get crappy
lotion, you'll be wishing there was a shower near by. Wouldn't your oils
make you all oily??? Lotion is just cool for hand rubs. Anything else and it
just isn't too cool.

Yeah, that was Pankaj (don't ask me how to pronounce that!).  I remember

Oh, and just in case people like partying this weekend (and you probably
do), me and Elvis (the king), will be throwing this phat-ass disco party in
the middle of pier 29. We rented out an old Lucky wharehouse complete with
all the sound equipment and lasers. My old work lent me the money and the
vehicles to make this all possible. Tickets will be $2.50, at the door or
free with a hug. There will be people from Terri's Treats walking around
passing out "E" , doses, Special K, killer skunk, crack, Heroin, and other
lovely treats. It will all be free once you get in. Please respect the
property and no sex in the chill rooms like last time (those cops were
pissing me off). 
Spread the word.

like Matt C. stated, they/we are not in this for the cash. You will be

    Now as far as the price to get in... It will be $15, however if you 
get to the party before 11pm you get in for $10. There is no limit on

We will all be dancing our asses of until 6am. It is going to be a 
blast!! So come a kick it with "the Pooh" and have yourself a fun

Things are not only bad, but they have been getting progressively 
worse. So should we continue the downward spiral? Continue to hand money 
out, in perpetuity, to anyone who doesn't feel like working, and doesn't have 
enough self respect to be embarrased by the fact that they are contributing 
nothing to their own upkeep, or the well being of others from whom they 
are leeching from? I think I will pass.

There are some *serious* deficencies in the current welfare system. The 
issue of the working poor is a prime example. People out there trying to 
make it. Let's give more money to them, and less to people that can't 
seem to get off their ass to work.    

Saying that the crime-rate is going to increase if we cut people off 
after five years is unlikely at best. Please read the following. It can 
be found at http://www.newsarchives.com/archive/dec1495/rgd.htm/


Report: Welfare Recipients Seeking Work in Wake of Benefit Cuts 

    HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -  A change in the state's welfare system that cut 
    benefits to encourge recipients to seek jobs apparenlty is working, 
    according to state officials.

   Figures released Wednesday shows that the number of welfare parents who are 
   employed has gone up 30 percent since cash benefits were cut in July.
   
   Cash benefits for a typical family of three were cut in July from $581 a 
   month to $543 a month for welfare families in non-subsidized housing and 
   $500 monthly for those in subsidized housing.

   State statistics show that only 12.7 percent of welfare recipients reported 
   that they were working in June 1995, the month before the cuts in cash 
   benefits were enacted.

   The number of recipients working has increased every month since then, and 
   reached 16.5 percent in November. That represents an increase of about 30 
   percent.

   ``People are going to work,'' said Joyce A. Thomas, commissioner of the 
    Department of Social Services, which oversees welfare programs. ``It's 
    working.''

   A review by the legislature's Office of Fiscal Analysis shows that welfare 
   reform measures are having a dramatic impact on parts of the state 
   budget. The state expected to save $133 million in two years because of the
   measures, but the statistics show that even more money is being saved in 
   some categories because the number of people on welfare has already dropped.


Weird huh? Tell people they aren't going to get as much money, and 
suddenly more people become employed. Must be some kind of voodoo magik....

I think it is safe to extrapolate this to apply to people that know that 
the free-ride is going to end after a period of time.

But can't you see that the way things are being done now isn't working?

	So, You're Elected to hold the gun to each person's head who wants to 
make their life better, but does not want to pay for those who don't.

	Just make sure you don't make us miserable doing it, or we'll all 
starve...  and you'll run out of bullets.

	It makes me feel so warm and fuzzy thinking how nice the world will be 
once we're all happily under your gun.  I'm sure we can all trust someone with 
your confidence.

My boyfriend at the time did sound for that show and he gave me mixtapes 
of the sets done by Masters at Work (so-so) and Steve Loria (great).  I 
didn't hear those artists mentioned in your review.  Were they in another 
room spinning?

just curious,

You know, I for one get real tired of this "I can't believe a *raver* 
would say XXXX." Who are you to tell me, or anyone else what they should 
believe to be a "raver?" Do I get kicked out of the "raver" club if I 
don't agree?

No one is talking about persecuting people who don't "function in society."
Let them run free and naked in the woods, unfettered by society's 
shackles, foraging for food and shelter. I don't care. When they want me 
to pay for their freedom, *THEN* I start to care.

Clinton: US to Press Search for Life on Mars

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Clinton Wednesday hailed the discovery of
possible signs of primitive life on Mars and said America will pour its
scientific prowess into the effort to confirm this stunning breakthrough.

``I am determined that the American space program will put its full
intellectual power and technological prowess behind the search for further
evidence of life on Mars,'' Clinton said in a statement as he left on a
political trip to California.

``If this discovery is confirmed it will surely be one of the most stunning
insights into our universe that science has ever uncovered,'' Clinton said.
``Its implications are as far-reaching and awe-inspiring as can be
imagined.''

He referred to a statement from the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration saying that study of a meteorite, believed to have broken off
from Mars and landed on Earth about four million years ago, ``points to the
possibility that a primitive form of microscopic life may have existed on
Mars more than three billion years ago.''

Clinton noted that the United States plans to launch an unmanned spacecraft
on a Mars exploration mission in November. He said he had directed Vice
President Al Gore to convene ``a bipartisan space summit'' at the White
House later this year ''on the future of America's space program'' including
how to pursue scientific questions raised by the Mars meteorite.

``We are committed to the aggressive plan we have put in place for the
robotic exploration of Mars,'' Clinton said.

No, it means that they don't matter enough for the U.S. to care 
about.(not my opinion, but proof should be in the lack of action.)

I doubt if everybody on welfare has that attitude. On another note, the
current situation is a result of many things like the position of blacks
in the US for the past few hunderd years, proper sex-education to teenagers,
and the basic theme that it's all about money, no matter how you get it.
Some of these issues will remain unresolved, even by cutting welfare.
If your poor, it will still be tough to find a job without a car, proper
housing, education etc.

This a very interesting and encouraging statistic, but I wonder what is
happening to the remaining 84% of welfare recipients. Are they starving?
May those be the people who either make money through crime or really
are not lazy but cannot find a job? What will happen to them? And $500
to $600 isn't very much for a family of three. How do they pay rent,
get their kids an education, eat properly etc.?

Except for those 84 % that remain. They are probably feeling the pins of

To me it seems that many political and social measures in this country
are based on treating symptoms. If there is a homeless problem, being
homeless is made illegal. I wonder if we really understand what the
problems are of those on welfare and why they remain on welfare for so
long. Saying they're all a lazy bunch of parasites sounds a bit too
easy. Remember, you may be the next person being laid of when your
company decides it's stocks should rise. And the older you get, the
tougher it gets to compete with the ever increasing number of young
people after the same jobs.

If we chose to misinterpret it as you have, yes. Take a look at your pay
check stub sometime. There is an item seperate from Federal withholding, 
it says SSI. That means Social Security Insurance. Hmmm.... seems like a 
seperate deduction to me.....

(My apologies for continuing a blatantly NRR thread.)

Risk factors for being a libertarian:
- White
- Male
- Unmarried
- No children
- >= middle class
- Works in computer industry

When I pointed this out to a diehard libertarian, his response was,
"Whaddaya want us to do?  Have affirmative action?"

There is definitely not a shortage of good jobs out there.  But there is a
shortage of dedication and drive.  A friend of mine works at a small branch
at a bank, who was looking for an assistant manager.  The job was almost
entry level, minimum experience required.  Only TWO applicants applied.     

Another friend of mine owns her own janitorial service.  She pays well.  She
cannot find reliable people to work.  They either call in sick, show up late
or quit after about a week.  

There are many more examples of this to be found.  Reliable people are very
scarce, education or not.  Let's face it....there are jobs out there,
regardless of what the media or the White House says.  But there are not a
lot of people who are willing to work.

  Seperate deducation yes.  However, the decision on how much to make that
deduction can be easily changed.  Saying that the social security program
will go bankrupt in X without further explanation *is* bogus, because
changing the percentages would be an almost trivial task, if they wanted
to do so.

  Well, the problem with that is, I don't see the government doing
anything good with my money.  I can make a donation to food not bombs or
give food away on the streets, and I am doing better and more than if I
paid higher taxes.  Because our current government will spend my extra
dollars on bombs, or to spy on its own people.  I can do better.

I used to think that there were certain basic things that people got
from raving.  A feeling of connectedness towards people different from
ourselves, a less judgemental attitude toward things we don't quite
understand, a greater sense of empathy towards humanity in general...

Obviously, this was an idealistic view of mine.  People go to raves for
many reasons, often it's just a place were they can hang out with their 
clique, never letting go of their certain view of the world.  Oh well,
I guess raving really isn't any different from any other scene.

Although I often find myself in agreement with this simplistic viewpoint,
something tells me that it is more wise not to judge an entire group of
people whose world I have not lived in.

To me, this egocentric attitude of I-know-what's-good-for-me-so-fuck-
everyone-else is a bigger problem in our society than a few people
taking advantage of the welfare system.

Let's throw around some numbers.

Approx pop. of the USA:     250 million
Approx unemployment rate:   6%  (this is being extremely conservative,
				because I haven't heard a recent figure.)

Thus, there are approximately 13 million unemployed people (counting only
those who are eligible to work) in this country.  Are you saying that
there are 13 million jobs available in this country?  If so, I'm afraid
you are simply wrong.

  What you're talking about in your message is a natural cycle.  Jobs
become available, jobs get filled, some of the workers don't work out.
But the unemployment figures stay the same, and the number of jobs
available at any given time also stays pretty much the same.  What happens
is that some people find jobs, and others leave or are fired, and
occasionallly new jobs open up.  It's a rotation, not a massive number of
available jobs.  At any given time, there are a fair number of jobs
available - but check again in a few months, and it will be a different
set of jobs.
  And by the way, number of applicants is not really representative of
anything... depends too much on the visibility of the opening, the
desirability of the opening, etc.

You could have discovered this by looking at this week's SF Guardian, 
pg. 39, "Clubs and Events/Places to Experience Electronic Music"  :(

I haven't been to C/U in a while, but I know that they don't really 
need any extra exposure.  Though it isn't that underground, it is
comparatively low-key, and is best served by responsible word-of-mouth.

Practicing what I preach, I've mouthed the word "ComeUnity" to a
newbie friend, who I'll probably be bringing out tonight, and for 
whom C/U will be a good entry-level experience.  

Rok.

I never said that all people on welfare have this attitude. That would be 
a very stupid generalization on my part. Welfare was designed to be there 
until people got on their feet. Well, now we have people that can't seem 
to get on their feet, ever, that are perfectly capable of standing up on 
their delicate tootsies and doing something to earn a living. The number 
of these type of people, the long term recipients, is increasing. 

I totally agree that we need to deal with the root of the problem. And 
throwing money at people is not dealing with the root of the problem, it 
is dealing with a symptom.

Of course they are not starving. You have to factor in Section 8 
housing, food stamps, and the free medical care. The point of me posting 
the article is that there are a good deal of people out there that are 
living their lives on welfare uncessarily. I would never, ever, want to 
do away with welfare. It does need to be changed, and their are a million 
ways to do so, to encourage people to work, rather than discouraging them 
as the current system does now.

I don't believe that was the issue. You said:

And all I am saying is that it *does* come out of a seperate pocketbook.

Who does? I certainly don't like many of the things the government does 
with my paycheck either. And I think an excessive amount is going to 
defense, and to welfare. Do I get the option of not paying?

100% correct. There *are* cliques, things going on behind the scenes, 
stupid "power" struggles, etc. Because anyone chooses a scene to identify 
with, this does not change the fact that they are human beings and 
subject to all the strengths and weaknesses that being human entails.

I am not judging at all. I don't care what people who chose to function 
outside the strictures of society do. Again I am just saying I do not 
want to be financially responsible if that is their choice. How is that 
judgemental?

Hey all,

Since I can't bring myself to join in this pseudo-political debate (for
the first time in my life!!!!) maybe this will keep my fingers at bay.

I make no claims as to the accuracy of the following table which a
friend got from his accountant May 11, 1996--though I see nothing to 
lead me to beleive it is inaccurate.

NOTE:  This does not say where any of the money is coming from, I believe
somebody mentioned Social Security having its own special income as does
unemployment (at least to some degree) so not all this is coming from
the general tax and therefore not all these items are `competing' for the
same funds.
				   $$$$	  Share
    Social Security		   $352	  21.8%
    Defense			   $264	  16.3%
      (not including pensions)
    Net interest on the debt	   $242	  15.0%
    Medicare			   $179	  11.1%
      (minus premiums paid)
    Medicaid			   $ 99	   6.1%
    Welfare			   $ 75	   4.6%
      (but not food stamps or
      unemployment)
    Pensions			   $ 68	   4.2%
      (civilian & military)
    Education & job programs	   $ 57	   3.5%
    Veterans			   $ 38	   2.3%
    Transportation		   $ 38	   2.3%
    Food stamps			   $ 27	   1.7%
    Unemployment		   $ 24	   1.5%
    Law enforcement		   $ 20	   1.2%
    Environment & resources	   $ 20	   1.2%
    Health			   $ 19	   1.1%
      (but not Medicare or
      Medicaid)
    Earned-income tax credit	   $ 18	   1.1%
    Science & space		   $ 17	   1.0%
    International,		   $ 17	   1.0%
      including foreign aid
    Agriculture			   $ 13	    .8%
    General government operations  $ 11	    .7%
    Regional & local development   $  9	    .5%
    Energy			   $  4	    .2%
    Disaster relief		   $  4	    .2%
    Commerce			   $  3	    .2%

    TOTALS (after rounding)  $1.62 trillion 100%

Column 2, which I have labeled $$$, was originally ``Fiscal
'96 Spending (In billions)''.

Column 3, which I have labeled ``Share'', was originally
``Share Of Total''.

I say we cancel our loan and stop paying that debt!

The Bahia's pretty nice; as I was telling someone else, my usual 
complaint is that there are too many places to sit there, but 
other than that, the dance floor's pretty cozee, and the visuals
are enjoyable.

I'll be there; say 'hi' - I'm on the short side with bleached hair
and clear-framed sunglasses;

not enough jobs? hmm...let's say we crack down and cut off all illegal 
immigration into this country and deport all aliens. who's going to work 
in the fields now? who's going to do grunt labor? gee, i now see jobs 
that americans can do. there are plenty of jobs in this country, but 
americans just dont want to go out and do hard work. the aliens will do 
this, but not the welfare americans. trust me, there ARE tons of jobs out 
there that people can do.

Some of you may remember my glow neckless body suit from F&F Holloween.  I'm
rolling out my new and improved "ultra-comfort" version at Burning Man.
I'd like to assemble a troupe of glowing wireframe people that descend in
mass upon Burning Man and later at Raves.  If you like to be under the
bright light of performance, and wearing those lights, drop me an email.

hiya -

This is directed to any musicians on the list.

I've decided it's finally time to break down and add a TB303 to my
arsenal... Unfortunately, they are of course hard to find, so I've
been looking at clones. The Fatman seems nice, as does the Syntecno
"TeeBee" TB303. Also, it seems that it would be nice to have MIDI to
ease some of the sync/timing issues.

So do any of you more musically inclined SFR'ers have the scoop on
these clone boxes? Of course, if you know anyone who's selling the
real thing, I'd love to know :)

Thanks!

Steve

You might also look at Roland's MC-303 -- it's supposed to clone
a few of the popular x0x's in one easy-to-tote box.

Troy, were you napping when I posted last week that I was looking for
work?  Something part-time, hopefully, while I go to school to learn to be
a programmer.

I am dead serious.  Please tell your two friends that I would love to send
them a resume.  I love to  clean, and I bet I would love the hours.  But
I hear being an assistant bank manager pays better.  The thought of being
an assistant bank manager, I admit, has not once entered my head until
now, but I would be willing to give it a shot.

Yet, the more I think about it, the more lovely it seems to me to get
to work in a bank.  Whenever I go to my credit union, I feel very welcome.
The tellers tell me how my money's doing and usually seem to recognize me.
I think they play this game where they try to remember every customer.  I
also enjoy getting to meet lots and lots of people- one reason I go to
raves a lot.  I bet you lots of ravers work in banks, too.  In fact, my
boyfriend ran into one of the tellers of HIS credit union at the FnF
party.  We then both agreed: that credit union is pretty cool.

By and large, my banking experiences have been very positive.  Although I
have absolutely no idea what goes on in a bank -except from that Jimmy
Stewart movie It's a Wonderful Life- I'm sure that I could
learn.  So please tell your friend that I am available for an assistant
bank manager training program.

Respectfully yours,

Ann Loraine

I can't tell you about the TB303, but the Fatman is cool as hell. First 
of all, you get to build it yourself :) A very good project to start out 
on, and you can patch and mod the Fatman and when you get good you can 
start building your own instruments. I guess this message doesn't tell 
you what you should get, since i've never used the tb303, but if you get 
the fatman, and you like building stuff, you'll be very happy :)

I have from reliable source that Sasha is slated to start 2:00 - 2:30 am.

I was a bit leary about this one, too, but the line-up is hard to resist.
I have not been going to massives because of all the hype/bad-vibe, etc.,
but I was hoping that I could meet folks from the list and we could spread
good vibe and totally pos-vibe the place out.

Despite the hesitation, I know the folks at Spundaes are quality
people/promoters.  Even though they mass-advertise, I have always had a
good time at their parties.

So, I have no idea what I'll be wearing (I'm the type who has fourteen
possible combinations to choose from and decides as the cab is honking
outside :)

But, I am 5'8", have really short, dark hair and an Amish/Abe Lincoln type
goatee about my visage.  There can't be all that many of us, so take a
chance and say HI!

I'll be at community tonight too!!  YEAAAAAH!

Arkay a.k.a. Rob

Yes, but it seemed that there were certain things about raves (music,
ecstatic dancing, openness, vibe) that attracted certain kinds of people
and perpetuated certain kinds of attitudes, despite all of our
differences.  And it seemed that many ravers had similar outlooks about
life because of this.  That's why you sometimes hear people say "I
wouldn't expect a raver to feel that way."  For some, it felt
like more of a cultural phenonemon instead of just another scene.

I have to assume by this that you are also against NEA grants that
help support all those freeloading artists.  I guess what I found
judgemental about your statements is the presumption that many people on
welfare are doing it as a choice for freedom or some kind of preferred
lifestyle.  I suppose this is true in some cases, but I think it unfairly
stereotypes and oversimplifies a complex social problem.

Yup, raving bank worker here.  And my co-worker is a raver too!  And we have
another friend who works for BofA who raves also ("and he told two friends,
and they told two friends...").  There's quite a number of raving bankers!
And with regards to Wowser's post, I got my job by temping there a while
back, and my experience with people is that he too is right, that often
people are not willing to work that hard.  The reason I got hired permanent
from temporary was because all my co-workers were so blown away by the fact
that I could actually photocopy pieces of paper!  Apparently the temp before
me was unable to photocopy a 8 1/2 x 11 sheet of paper. So yes, while this
of course doesn't entirely account for the unemployment in the country, it
is still true that some people cant or wont do the job at hand, have
certainly seen it first hand over & over again.  They either flake on the
job, or don't really bother trying to do what it really takes to get
employed, and then complain that there are no jobs.  This especially pisses
me off when I see other people out there who are busting their asses to get
hired and still cannot succeed.

  Some misleading numbers that is.

  No, the % (which seems about right, might be even lower) is a
  portion of the work force.  Thus, you can drop about 100 million or so
  off that population (I don't know the *exact* number).
  Thus, the number of unemployed would be a few million less than you
  indicated.

>those who are eligible to work) in this country.  Are you saying that
>there are 13 million jobs available in this country?  If so, I'm afraid
>you are simply wrong.

  Seems *you* are the one saying that actually...

  Having no one available at all to hire except by raiding another employer
  would be rather unhealthy, thus a 0% unemployment rate would not be so great.
  What happens if business picks up, who would you hire?  You could not
  because there would be no one to hire!

>  What you're talking about in your message is a natural cycle.  Jobs

   True, so a reasonable amount of unemployment is expected and
   healthy.  There are plenty of jobs, certainly, but no one said they
   drop in your lap - you have to *gasp* WORK to get them.   What a concept!
   And typically most people find jobs within a few months (varies obviously
   but that time frame will do for this discussion).

   Let me comment just for the record that the unemployed are those ACTIVELY
   seeking work vs. those welfare recipients that are not doing anything
   to be gainfully employed.  And unemployment payments are are not
   related to welfare payments.

>  And by the way, number of applicants is not really representative of

  If you are truly needy, most any job that pays will be desirable.

hello all-

if you believe this is not proper for discussion on sfraves, please delete
this message now.


Good!  you're still reading, which means that you care about our brothers
and sisters who are part of the gay/lesbian/bisexual/transgender (glbt)
community.  this letter was forewarded to me by a friend on a glbt support
list, and i feel it is very appropriate.

please keep reading.

 President Bill Clinton has been taking way too much advice from his
right-wing advisors like Dick Morris on the subject of DOMA. He needs to
know that we will not sit back and allow him to score election year points
by denying basic rights to lesbian or gay Americans. It is the most
important battle of our political lives and no matter what we think about
the timing or the politics behind this issue, we cannot afford to sit this
one out. This is an experiment in using the net for grass roots politics.
Your voice will make a difference.

   To participate in this experiment:

  1. E-mail this message, exactly as it is, complete with this introductio
to at least five of your friends. Add it to any mailing lists you are on.
Please, distribute as widely as you can.

   2. Copy the message below the line, without this introduction, to a new
e-mail message.

   3. Address that new message to:  president@whitehouse.gov

   4. Fill in your name, street address and the date  in the appropriate
places top and bottom. The White House tosses e-messages with no street
>address.

   5. In the subject line, write VETO DOMA

   6. Hit the send button and your copy of message will be on its way to The
White House.

   If you follow all of these directions the President  could receive a few
hundred  thousand messages titled VETO DOMA. It would be too much to ignor

    We can and will make a difference in 1996!

The White House

Dear Mr. President:

Republicans in Congress, with the help of many Democrats will
probably pass the so called Defense Of Marriage Act, or DOMA. They created
the bill from ignorance, from hatred for gay Americans and out of he desir
to embarrass you in an election year. You helped its progress when, to mak
yourself look good in a election year, you announced early that you would
sign it. Now, you must change your mind and do the right thing. Veto DOMA!
We will not allow you to make political gains by creating pain for of gay
Americans.

DOMA is a dangerous threat to the civil liberties of gay Americans and to
the Constitution itself.  As Jim Crow laws once did to African Americans i
the South, DOMA would use the mighty power of the federal government to de
to one class of citizens, gay Americans: income tax benefits, pensions,
social security survivor benefits, access to partners in federal hospitals
immigration rights, and so much more that we have not yet considered. DOMA
would create for the first time under federal law two  classes of
citizenship with different rights for gay and  straight Americans. This
divisive law threatens one of our most important Constitutional principles
equal protection under the law.

You must do the right thing Mr. President speak out against the hatred,
eschew the politics of division and rise above the political expedience. D
the right thing for your country and its citizens. Veto DOMA. Raise your
voice against  this monstrous injustice. Use the power of your veto pen to
bring us together, instead of your signiture to divide our nation by
creating a new federally ordered apartheid system of injustice.

Not if we can help it. But what evidence is there that the costs caused
by reducing welfare won't accelerate the downward spiral? 

Is there any evidence that the downward spiral has anything to do with
welfare at all? For example, the "war on drugs" has swallowed up far
more tax dollars than welfare in the last few years, and has arguably
caused more problems.

Ok, lets take a look at it. (By the way, welfare is also going to be
denied to recent legal immigrants.)

Ok, so some people made extra effort to find work when welfare was cut,
and about 4% of those on welfare found work. How many of the 80% or so
who weren't working and didn't find work made extra effort to steal?
It seems likely that at least some extra crime would result from the
measure.  (I'm not suggesting that the crime is justified, only that it
is likely.)

Lets look at other aspects. The extra 4% of those on welfare who did
find jobs, took them out of the available pool. This will reduce other
peoples' incomes to some extent (there must have been more than 1 or 2
applicants for at least some of those jobs). It may, after some time
lag, cause other people to go on welfare.

It doesn't appear that the measure provides child care. There will
almost certainly be downstream costs in crime (again), reduced
educational performance and hence welfare. Forcing parents out to work
without providing adequately for their children is a wonderful way of
sustaining the "welfare trap".

There seems to be no substantual evidence that, taking into account all
the costs, this measure actually saves money. Sure, the state's costs
went down in the short term, but how much will police, court and prison
costs, public health costs, property insurance bills, and welfare costs
go up in the future?

Cutting welfare is false economy IMHO, and i haven't seen any strong
evidence to the contrary.

The newspaper story is a good example of how to put a slant on a story
by selectively quoting statistics and by ignoring the wider picture.
"Limbaughing, n.: lying by selectively choosing data to confirm
a desired result."

That's a wildly sweeping statement. A proportion of the people on
welfare couldn't possibly support themselves in any way. They're being
cared for. Some proportion of the people on welfare genuinely can't
find work despite extensive searching. They're being looked after. That
bit of the system seems to be working ok.

Sure, there are problems with the welfare system, but there is no
substantual evidence that cutting welfare will make things "work"
better. As i suggested above, if you want to blame something for things
not working, take a close look at bigger-budget items like the "war on
drugs". Welfare spending is a relatively small part of the budget,
although our political masters want us to think differently.

Personally i think that the welfare system needs to be tweaked and
experimented with to get it to achieve better results. This is being
done in various States. What i don't support is the Federal goverment
cutting a 12 billion dollar chunk out of welfare. That seems to be a
rash populist move, with potentially disastrous consequences.

  Whoops... quite right on that one.  I suspect, however, that the
percentage is quite a bit higher - I know, for example, that in Canada the
unemployment rate is over 10% much of the time.  But I don't know.

  Here I don't follow you.  I was arguing against the people who claimed
that there were enough jobs for everyone.  There aren't.

  Yes - in fact it is widely agreed upon that 6% unemployment is ideal in
a capitalist nation.

  And what I have been saying is that I don't believe people should have
to suffer through a job that demeans them.  I know this is at odds with
the fundamentals of capitalism, and I'm going to stop arguing on the list
for that reason.  I am... uhh... pretty far left.

No one really knows--there haven't been any authentically communist 
enterprises long-lived or extensive enough to really come to grips with 
the issues and see how things go in practice.  They tend either to be 
crushed by anti-communist pressures or to slide into totalitarian 
right-Marxist statism of the sort we generally know as capital-C 
Communism.  It's common to use the latter outcome as "proof" of 
communism's fundamentally evil and flawed nature, but it's really only 
indirectly connected to communism as economics.  The real culprit is the 
accumulation of power--when typical human greed and dominance are 
asserted within a communist economic system (along with the traditional 
structures and apparatus of "state"), that's what you get.  In a 
capitalist economic system, you slide into corporate right-capitalist 
statism of the sort we generally know as American democracy.

The Spanish anarchists took a good shot at establishing large-scale 
industrial communism, with some success.  They didn't last long, of 
course (they got it from both sides), but they did enough to think about. 
 A sort of specialized, limited agrarian communism through reform and 
redistribution of land ownership has been undertaken, again with some 
success, in a number of places.  There are other hints of effective 
communism in groups like the Mennonites and the Amish, kibbutzim, etc.

The US has actively encouraged and supported, through means far more 
direct than favorable trade relations, numerous governments whose respect 
for human rights, democratic values, etc, can easily compete with China's 
in the "most horrendous" sweepstakes.  Guatemala comes to mind.  Not to 
mention South Vietnam.  In all the cases, it's not a matter of pacifying 
a hostile nation, but rather of: a) maintaining alliances and lines of 
influence that support the exercise of American power in the geopolitical 
realm; and b) maintaining favorable conditions for American economic 
growth, i.e. efficient access to resources (including labor) and markets. 
 (The two categories intersect and overlap in many ways, of course).  Any 
fear of China is not fear of blood in the streets and the red flag over 
Washington, but fear of a closed Asian market, or, to a lesser extent, of 
an Asian political bloc not necessarily aligned with American interests.

The MC-303 is brand new (if it's even out in the US yet). It's all sample
based, with loops from the TB303 and drums from the 808 and 909, etc.

It's been a rough couple of weeks for me lately. I'm still in
emotional turmoil over my moving over to my fiancee's house in the
Oakland Hills. She shares this monster of a house, located in a
cul-de-sac, with seven other people, two of them being married. I
really have come to love everyone who lives in the house, but I'm
having a hard time adjusting to suburban life here.

I consider modern suburban development to be evil for several reasons:

    1. Suburbs cause widespread destruction of wilderness areas, through
    deliberate low-density population development.

    2. Suburbs are costly to our resources: water that keeps lawns green,
    gas required for us to drive everywhere, since most modern suburbs
    have poor public transit, few stores and conveniences within
    walking distance, and bike-unfriendly streets.

    3. Idiotic road layouts, with windy, wide streets with speed bumps,
    cul-de-sacs, and traffic funneled onto crowded main access roads.

    4. Loss of identity, with ticky-tack architecture.

Although I was born and raised for 8 years in a suburb (an old-style
one planned in the 20's), and lived for 10 years in a small-town, I
have, for past 14 years, lived in urban areas, which I now prefer over
the 'burbs. Now I find myself in the middle of the suburb. 

Is there anyone out there in raveland who feels the way I do about the
'burbs? What can I do to regain my sanity, and have everyone be happy
(especially myself)?

Some thoughts that came to mind yesterday...

The recent bust of the marijuana buyers club in SF got me thinking
about our scene. With the ongoing discussion that has been going on
the past few months criticizing the use of nitrous at parties, I've
come to realize just how responsible the underground rave scene is --
perhaps even more responsible than the above-ground, commercialized
rave scene altogether.

The emphasis towards having people be present, aware, and conscious in
the scene, in the interests of generating PLUR, promotes responsible
use of those mind-altering substances that enhance the scene. Alcohol,
which dulls the senses, and decreases one's awareness, is either
forbidden or strongly discouraged. The mere sight of a nitrous tank is
untolerated. Pacific, in particular, should be applauded for imposing
a "zero tolerance" rule for nitrous at the Sunset parties.

Compare this to the legal scene, where alcohol, a depressant that
often leads to irrational and violent behavior, not to mention auto
accidents, and tobacco, a sedative with addictive effects comparable
to heroin, are the legal drugs today. This comparison is best observed
at venues such as Wicked, when the scene changes from club land to
rave land at 2:00am.

It's amazing how screwed up US drug policy really is. It may take many
years to undo the 50+ years of bad decisions made by our
government. We all must stand up and confront the bias that is imposed
on our society, and fueled by lobbying dollars from the likes of RJR,
Phillip Morris, and Seagrams.

But this is for one reason because it's such blatantly open drug use
which could cause problems with the police and result in shut-down
of the party. In Holland, were nitrous is freely available (together
with many other wonderful things) nitrous is still found at under-
ground parties, or even supplied for free, without anybody really
caring about it.

I'm not sure if our scene is allowed to condemn other people with
respect to what they eat/swallow/smoke or drink. As if we know what
the effects of (any) drug use will be in the future. People can still
be complete assholes or reckless, even when on E.

Just called Roland and had a lovely conversation with their automated
fax-back system. Once it hits the stores, it'll be $895. That's a
pretty good deal if does what they say it'll do.

I found this on the web: gives a review and a comparison with
the classic gear.

Thanks, guys. I think I may have found my box :)

6% unemployment does not mean that there are 13 million people looking for
non-existent jobs.  Have you heard of structural enemployment?
Come on--be fair.  As Lisa Simpson says, "your reasoning is specious."

Well guys and gals, I spent a couple of hours trying to track down some
honest, simplified bar graphs or pie-charts as to the spending of the
Federal Government (in response to the recent flood of our political posts).  
What do they do with our money?  I searched the web in vain, and found that
all the sites were far too complicated to present a whole, simple picture.
There are a bunch of people throwing statistics around, and I think it would
benefit us all if we found a .gov site or similar that explained 'simply'
how our money is spent.  Does anyone have any suggestions or know of any
sites where this type of information can be found?  If you do, please post
the site so we can all become more aware.  Thanks!!!

Love,

Troy J.

Subject: Inspirational story about *jobs*
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

A friend of mine told me a very heartwarming story today about finding jobs.
I was talking with her about some of the misguided views I found on sfraves
about the sociopolitcal environment in the USA, but also about some of you
who really seem to be aware of what has been, and still is happening.   

Concerning the "lack" of jobs, she told me about one of her friends who had
been paralized from the neck down in a swimming accident.  He was only about
twenty at the time, and had been attending college to be an accountant.
After the accident, which left him a parapalegic, he continued on with
school and eventually ended up working as an accountant anyways.  He used
his mouth and a pencil to do his work.  He supported himself until the age
of 65 and never took any type of SSI or government assistance.  At 65 he
reluctantly took social security, because he had retired.

I was touched by that true story and just wanted to share it with you all.
Indeed, where there is a will....there is "the way"!!!!  I think a lot of
people have lost or have never developed a working ethic.  We all have a lot
to learn from people like the parapalegic accountant....

Love,

Troy J.

Hokay, so I'm glad to see that there are a few folks out there who 
are attending Nation Saturday. You can count on me being there, along 
with a large representative of the transformational community...

The best part is that Saturday, at 11:45pm (Sunday, 2:45 am EST), 
I'll be celebrating my exact birth time at the rave -- my 100000'th 
birthday in computer years. That's 32 to you and me. ;-) 

I invite everyone to come out and celebrate with all of us (including 
Jamie, my raver fiancee) at the pier. It will be a blast. The lineup 
is phat. Together, we can bring a higher state of PLURness to 
massives such as this one. Spundae has an excellent reputation for 
putting on the big shows.

Ann, the job was not in California or I would have responded to your post,
however there are jobs to be found at banks in CA...depending upon where you
live. Check out the web sites of the major banks and there you will find job
opportunities.  From tellers to everything else.  A good start is:

        www.usbanks.com (choose "about" and go from there)
        www.wellsfargo.com (Same thing)

Good luck,

Troy J.

And this is often at or near minimum wage, which is barely enough to live off
of!  40 hours a week at $4.25/hr = $680.00 minus _alot_ in taxes!(Anyone know

it's funny how some of these ravers start phantasizing about people

well you know, i just allowed myself to wonder a bit. no need to get upset.
nobody kicks you out of the club if you don't do it yourself.
but if i keep reading on this list that money is not the thing to 
make you happy, but, all and forever, PLUR, and if i keep reading posts 
that have people contemplating about the evils of mc donalds and 
advertising campaigns, and if i keep reading posts that show people are 
aware of environmental problems, poverty in the third world and the connection
between these puppies and capitalist economy, and if i keep reading that 
people are reflecting what they, obligated by their special quality of being 
*ravers* could possibly do about and against that, then i start drawing 
conclusions about those californian ravers nature.

and if then, all of a sudden, posts emerge, virtually written by the same 
people, that recommend 'move yer butt and get yerself a job at mc donalds', 
or in advertising, posts that express not only disapproval, but hate against 
people that don't work and produce 'litters of children', dear black adder,
and if i see these people being all concerned somebody could steel 
their money from them and have a good time (not concerned, of course, 
about those oh so necessary spendings for defence), then i can't help 
being a little puzzled.

yeah sure you don't care the fuck wether i consider it useful what you do.
i got that.
but wether your job provider considers what you would like to 
do, or what you're good at, or what you think would be of advantage for 
mankind as a whole being useful (for his business), this *is* important. 
is it not? for he won't pay you a penny for something he *feels bad about*.
but thats ok. i understand.

about me, i like my job. i'm only aware of the fact that what i do 
(theoretical biophysics) is completely unnecessary in the sense that it 
doesn't do any good for anybody. they could as well pay me for doing nothing. 
but, at least it doesn't cause any damage, a thing that can't be said about 
too many jobs that are out there. i imagine you would agree with me when i 
say that maybe some solid 50% of the goods that are produced/services offered
are sheer luxury, if not completely needless and are just produced/offered to 
keep the circle of economy moving, all on the cost of nature.

this is why i called the belief that one had to work to justify ones 
existence **oldfashioned**.  this is something that used to be true when the 
means of production weren't so high developed as they are today. today, 
everything that is really needed can be produced by a fraction of the 
population with the help of all those machines.

if the *sheer fact* that a country is starting to develop a certain power 
is enough reason to assume this country was about to invade the 
united states, what about the contrary. must not all the damn countries in the 
world then be totally convinced the us was about to invade them?
what makes you believe the us doesn't carry those thougts (permit the 
simplified assumption that a *state* as such could have thougts), but 
china for instance does?
something in the general evilness of all those communist,chinese,arab
and what-the-fuck unamerican little suckers out there? 
seriously, must not every country in the world then be totally shaken by 
fear of being chopped by north america?

i think this little thougt experiment should show that such world view is 
rather schizophrenic and paranoid.
it hasn't led to any good in the past and won't do so in the future.

Saw this in Time Magazine.  In a poll, 12% of the respondants said that they
"use E-mail or the internet", and their astrological signs break down as
follows: 
 
Taurus:         18%
Libra:          11%
Sagittarius:    10% 
Scorpio:        10%     
Aries:           8%
Capricorn:       8%
Gemini:          8%
Aquarius:        7%
Cancer:          6%
Leo:             6%
Pisces:          4%
Virgo:           4%

Somewhat interesting.  The 4 most frequently reported signs on sfr (Aq, Gem, 
Can, Pis w/ 11, 10, 9, 9, making up ~39%), are in the bottom half of all
e-mail/Inet users, comprising only 25%.  Then again, only 97 people on this
list responded, and who knows what cross-section Time polled?  Oh, well, it
amuses my mostly-asleep brain.

Hah! :)  I always associated that with the Bay Guardian!  Although I guess the

Not to offend you anti-corporate types, but my friend and I have always

Firstly, you need to read "the New republlic" by Plato and anything by 
John Paul Sarte and then re-think your definition of the words, socialism,
government and democracy.
Secondly, when a person recieves a welfare cheque he is not benefitting
from Government generiousity or stealing from fellow tax payers.  He/she
is recieving a bribe so that he/she will just go home and keep quiet.
Remember: no moniterist Government can afford to have 100% employment so
each unemployed person actually keeps five people in work.  If there weere
not welfare recipiants you, Wowser, would not even to be able to afford
your computer or anything so stop complaining and be thankful for small
mercies.  In short, capitalism can not function without unemployment and
welfare so the very thing that you crtizise is the very thing that keeps
the system that you tradgically believe in.
And finaly. socialism, democracy etc are all words that are used to pull
the wool over our eyes and, in practise, they mean nothing.  These ideals
can only be truely achieved in a society where there are no laws, no
governemnt or elections, no police and everyone is paid the same
regaurdless of what they do because each individual understands the fact
that they are just as an important as everybody else.  This system is
called Anachism and it is the only way that man can carry on living in
large societies and survive.

according to the stat posted, social security is the biggest chunk of our
budget -- and is paid for by a regressive tax.  The percentage is flat up
to a certain level of income (I forget what, sorry) and after that income
is social-security-tax-free.

yet, basically everyone gets equal social security, tax-free, even rich
people who paid proportionately less than poor people for social security,
and who ostensibly need social security less (yeah, i know, it's supposed
to be a deal based on what you pay into the system . . . in which case we
should all stop if we're sure it's going to go bust).

maybe that's why social security taxes are untouchable . . . whatever one
thinks of welfare + food stamps + unemployment, we pay almost 3 times as
much in social security.

the big shift in income by decade in the 80's wasn't just from poor to
rich, it was from young to old.  According to Geoffrey T. Holtz's amazing
book "Welcome to the Jungle," using U.S. Census figures, from 1973-91, the
median income of 15-24 year-olds and 25-34 year-olds fell by more than 27%,
while the income for all other age groups has risen, particularly for those
over 65.  In 1970, the median 20-24 year-old male had an income 67% of a
median 45-54 year-old; in 1990 the 20-24 year-old made 34% as much (for
25-34 year-olds, the decline is from 92% to 69%).

a government site that says "simply" how tax dollars are spent?  goos 
luk.  it's not in the government's best interest to allow the average 
person access to that sort of info.  you might find out just HOW out of 
proportion the military and Pentagon budgets are.

Brian mentioned using hybrid oils, of one or more of the types listed.  Almond oil can often be 
found rather inexpensively.  These do not have the slimey feel of lotion and, with a simple
hand towel or paper towel do not leave a staining (clothes) oily residue behind.

Take care,

Tristan, dear man!  It amazes me with what apparent ease you hand down   
grossly unsupported and high-handed blanket statements!
If you really understand all of this as well as you claim to, then why   
don't you back down a bit from the absolutism and condescension, and   
argue your case with some reasonable explanations for your claims?  I,   
for one, would really be interested if you actually know what you're   
talking about.  But it's not at all clear from this message that this is   
the case...

Firstly, you need to read "the New republlic" by Plato and anything by
John Paul Sarte and then re-think your definition of the words,   
socialism,
government and democracy.
Secondly, when a person recieves a welfare cheque he is not benefitting
from Government generiousity or stealing from fellow tax payers.  He/she
is recieving a bribe so that he/she will just go home and keep quiet.
Remember: no moniterist Government can afford to have 100% employment so
each unemployed person actually keeps five people in work.  If there   
weere
not welfare recipiants you, Wowser, would not even to be able to afford
your computer or anything so stop complaining and be thankful for small
mercies.  In short, capitalism can not function without unemployment and
welfare so the very thing that you crtizise is the very thing that keeps
the system that you tradgically believe in.
And finaly. socialism, democracy etc are all words that are used to pull
the wool over our eyes and, in practise, they mean nothing.  These ideals
can only be truely achieved in a society where there are no laws, no
governemnt or elections, no police and everyone is paid the same
regaurdless of what they do because each individual understands the fact
that they are just as an important as everybody else.  This system is
called Anachism and it is the only way that man can carry on living in
large societies and survive.

I don't see the working lifestyle as bullshit.  I see it as selling my 
services.  I'm not a slave.  I'm a contractor.  We all are.  We contract 
with our employers, selling our services.  The minute you don't like the 
arrangement, you can begin marketing your services to other bidders.  I am 
contracting my services to a company.  I have an agreement with them to 
perform certain duties, produce certain items, and in return for the hours I 
spend I am reimbursed in the agreed upon currency.  And then you want me to 
turn around and give part of my money to some mystery person, someone who 
has given me no guarantee that they're making an effort to get off the dole, 
to support themselves?  No, I don't buy it.

We live in a capitalist society.  I don't think anyone that's had to buy 
food, pay rent, an spend money at the gas pump is going to argue this point. 
 If you wish to live in a communal society where everything you gain is 
pooled so that others can use it without question, you need to go find that 
society.  Putting a person that has no money and doesn't want to earn any in 
a society based on money is like throwing an animal that can't swim into the 
ocean.  That's the reality of life.  Another reality is that people 
generally don't like to see that which they've worked hard to earn given to 
someone who has made a living off government subsidies for doing nothing.

And in this program they could get training for a different job.

I say bullshit.  People of every race, color, creed, personal hygiene, and 
Vogue/GQ factor manage every day to find gainful employment and support 
themselves.  I know -- I'm a systems engineer, and I occasionally have to 
work with some of the ugliest, smelliest people in the world...  ;)

>  Also, there are people who don't want to work.  I'm all for that.

And I'm not.  Fine, you don't want to work for someone else?  No problem.  
Write a book.  Paint.  Do something that produces something that is 
marketable.  Or move out to the country and start farming to support 
yourself.  I don't care, but don't put your hand in my pocket like you've 
got the right.  If you want my help, you're going to have to start by 
helping yourself, and the program I propose gives people the chance to do 
just that.

>  And

Again, I don't care what they're willing to do, this becomes a question of 
what I'm willing to do, and I'm not willing to wipe someone's ass just 
because it's 
beneath him to do it himself.  He'd better swallow a little of that pride 
and get busy.  What I propose gives a person a chance to determine for 
themselves what kind of job they want, to obtain the skill sets they need, 
and gives them time to apply themselves in the pursuit of finding gainful 
employment in their selected field.

Don't be disingenuous.  If he doesn't like fish, then he better learn to 
hunt or farm.  Or starve.  And if someone isn't *intelligent enough* to do 
that, then so be it.

It's impossible to "simply" represent something as complex as our economy
without twisting the facts around... Unfortunately, depending on whose site
you look at, you're going to get stats that send very conflicting messages.

"Oh kent, statistics can be used to prove *anything* ...14% of people know
that!"

I have been looking for the same thing. With a couple hundred thousand

And this is one more reason that working is so unattractive to the 
welfare recipient. What other reason than self-respect would one 
have for working for minimum wage(which is SUB-minimum) when a person can 
collect welfare/Medicare/Food Stamps/Section 8 housing for doing nothing? 
What incentives are being offered to these people?

I'm sorry, but I deleted the mail from who wanted a ride to HUNNY from
Santa Cruz.  I live in Boulder Creek, but I will be in Stockton this
weekend.  We usually go to SF every weekend, so if anyone ever needs a
ride any other weekend, please just ask.  We'll always find room for
you!!!!  Look for me at HUNNY.  Not sure what I'll be wearing, I have
medium length dark red hair.

Good day,

I have been trying to stay out of this one for a while, but this message has touched a 
nerve.  I had probably on of the *best* work ethics an employer could hope for.  In Jan.
95, I injured my knee on the job and continued to work while going to physical therapy.
Before this injury, I was working 45-60 hours a week at my job in an attempt to pay off
debt that I had incurred several years earlier.  Two months into P.T. I reinjured my knee
lifting weights.  To make a long story short, it became progressively harder to continue
with my duties at work by Feb. of 96.  My injury had become a permanent disability.
Despite my 7 years of experience and skill, this employer became upset over how my
weekly trips to the therapist, for this condition, was inconveniencing him. (he couldn't
seem to keep the times straight and would schedule work in these slots anyway, or
would over book the schedule and have a FIT when I reminded him that the doctor's orders 
were to not have me standing more than 40min of every hour)  This still caused some 
pain, but I felt that I was making some progress with the condition.  They *asked* if
I could do anything about the doctors orders.  When I said that they were in place to
make sure the condition didn't worsen, I was sent home.  It seems the alternate 
desk job that I was most qualified for, was the technical service duties that were a small
part of my boss' duties.  Unfortunately, these were his most cushy duties and he was 
quoted as saying "what! You want to give him your job", to a felllow employee, after I had 
been sent home.  This man was quite incompetentwhen it came to tech service, and had 
a hard time remembering a conversation you might have had with him yesterday.  When 
he was out of town and I would take over tech, upon his return, he would find that everyone 
was interested in talking to me because I was courtious and knew what the hell I was talking 
about (he often didn't, and customers picked up on this)  So what did this great work ethic 
get me?  A hellish trip through a Worker's Comp. program, where I  have yet to collect the 
training that is due me.  By the way,  pro-businness legislators have restructured this 
program with a cap of $16,000 for schooling, money to live off of, ($700 a month less than 
I was making without O.T.) counselors fees (up to $4500) and any other expenses.  I am 
fighting with the insurance company to get part of a disability settlement that is mine, as a 
lump sum, for the sole purpose of extending my training from a 2 mo. CNA  to a 5 mo. CNE 
program.  They have cut off my income, without even contacting me, when the claims 
examiner was fired and had not turned in any on the required paperwork to my employer 
etc. etc. This alone cost me 45 days of crucial time, where my money to retrain is limited.  
Not to mention, causing even more friction between the employer and myself; we both 
thought the other was dragging their feet.  They haven't even taken me off of the payroll, so 
I can get my hands on the profit sharing money that I earned while in their employ (working 
on this).  These are the same people who want to enact sweeping welfare cuts.  I say cuts 
and not reform, because THEY would like nothing better than for NONE of THEIR money 
to go to these FREELOADERS.  Do you really feel that $13,000 in disability payments will 
make up for not being able to spend more than minutes dancing; nix on mountain biking, 
free climbing, hiking or just standing for long periods of time.  And I am trying to spend
$6000 of this to train myself to a level that would have been taken care of before "reforms"
were enacted.

Please think about the people who use these safety nets in earnest, before you gut them 
due to the abuse of some.  Without help from my friends and family, both emotionally and 
monetarily, I would be livivg in absolute depression right now.  The very orange 286 relic 
I am typing on right now, was donated by a good friend of mine.  When the my WC checks 
stopped temporarily, without help, I would have been out on my ass, with legal costs due 
to breach of lease, unable to get a afford deposits for a new apt.  Some people for various 
reasons, do not have any of these internal safety networks and should not be punished for 
lack of them.

I realize that drawing a parallel between WC and welfare is stretching a bit.  But, my point is 
that any "reforms" that are enacted aren't going to help society or recipients in any way if they 
don't include such things as education and child care for those you are trying to get out of the 
system.  Who is going to watch "welfare mom's" kids while she's flippin' burgers for $4.25 
an hour?  What do care worker's get for this on average?   $7-8 dollars an hour.  This means 
we must train those that are willing to work into at least $10 an hour jobs if you expect to get 
anywhere.  I haven't even seen any education guarantees from those who are proposing
reform, because this cost with child care is often more expensive than Welfare alone, in the
short term.  And our representatives are concerned primarily with the short term, quarterly
earnings of their big business pals.  

This will probably be my only public post on the subject of socialism, wefare etc.

Thank you for your time.

Take care,
                    Jason

Compare this to the legal scene, where alcohol, a depressant that
often leads to irrational and violent behavior, not to mention auto
accidents, and tobacco, a sedative with addictive effects comparable
to heroin, are the legal drugs today. This comparison is best observed
at venues such as Wicked, when the scene changes from club land to
rave land at 2:00am.

Hmmm.....  I am not sure if I completely agree with your statements in 
the above paragraph.  Maybe I should start with smoking - I quit 3 1/2 
weeks ago after 10-11 years of smoking.  The only times I crave a smoke 
is early in the morning after partying all night (going to after party 
and watching other people smoke).  Maybe I am different than other 
people, maybe I just didn't get addicted to nicotin (I could not imagine 
wearing a patch or chewing Nicoret because that's just nasty - I enjoyed 
the ritual of smoking).  Maybe getting off heroin (if I was addicted to 
it) or any other drug would be as easy for me as getting off cigaretts, 
but I can't tell (considering that I wasn't addicted to anything except 
for chocolate at one point :P).  But, I know many people would not agree 
with me - I am sharing my personal (as well as 2 of my roommates 
expereinces because we all quit smoking).

The other statement that I didn't like was that alcohol leads to auto 
accidents...  I agree with you, but it just sounded like other 
recreational drugs (I just love that term :)) don't.  I have seen people 
so messed up on E, acid or whatever that they can hardly walk.  I can't 
even imagine one of them trying to drive a car.  Don't you think that 
auto accidents would be caused as well?  I think the reason there are not 
as many accidents like those is because there are less people using those 
drugs vs. alcohol. 

I have never been to Wicked (maybe I will go one day), but I am sure it 
can compare to 1015 with the cluby/bary atmosphere.  I am sure alcohol 
has some affects on that, but I think that more problems are caused by 
the general attitude of the bar/club sceene (this is speaking from 
personal experience because I just stared raving 6 months ago and I used 
to be one of those people).  When you are part of that sceene there are 
certain rules to follow if you want to be accepted (at least I felt that 
way).  You have to be serious (smiling too much *will* get you in 
trouble), can't talk to just anybody and pretend you are a small step 
from God (I feel flames coming my way - I just want to say that this is 
how I felt as part of the club sceene for years.  I am also not saying 
that all clubby ppl are like that and ravers are not.)  You have to 
pretend you *don't* care otherwise you will get hurt.

The reason I love raves is people who make it.  I can walk around with a 
smile and I won't get shit for it - I can talk to people because I just 
think they are neat, not because I want to go to bed with them and I can 
be myself and not pretend I don't care.  I can give hugs and be silly and 
most people won't care.  If I need help from somebody, I can ask one of 
my friends that I met at the rave and they will help me (hey Tim).....

But, if you know me I am sure you heard me in early morning hours say "I 
wish I had a beer right now."  There is no better way to end a party than 
with a nice, cold beer :).  Some people jokingly said that maybe I was an 
alcoholic (maybe I am I just don't know it), but I love the taste of 
beer after 
partying all night.  Also, because I don't drink that often as I used to 
I get messed up on alcohol fairly quickly.  I don't think that my 
attitude becomes like it used to few months ago, because I know the 
environment that I hang out in does not require me to be a snotty bitch.

Anyway, this is getting too long, I am at work, but I just had to get 
some things of my chest.  SOrry to get so sidetracked, but I guess I 
really don't feel like working right now :))).

Hope to see some of you soon,
hugz & smiles
Branka

I'm very glad that Jason shared his experiences.  I am enjoying the
current debate over sociliasm, jobs, welfare, etc., but it's been very
theoretical and abstract.  I think that the best way to learn about these
topics is to talk about them in general, and also talk about them as
they relate to specific people.

I hope to see more posts like this one!

See you,

Ann

For those who are interested, Cody's books in Berkeley now has copies of 
the American version of Ecstacy by Saunders and Doblin.  It includes some

for those of you who pay taxes, every year in the tax booklet
that includes your 1040 tax form they include some very simple pie
charts that show where the money comes from and where it goes.
it's even simpler than the table that was posted earlier
(which looked accurate, btw).  don't tell me you've thrown those
old tax booklets away!! :) for more detailed information, check out
"the american almanac" available at your local crown books.
it has lots and lots of great statistics on any and every topic
to argue over.

expenditure information is definitely not a state secret, in fact there
is probably no information that is (or should be) more public.

Congratulations!  I'm not a smoker myself but lotsa family (asians and
the smoking thang, don't you know) and friends do, and from what I've seen
it's pretty damn hard to quit.  I think I've only known about three people
that have successfully quit, six counting you and your roomies.  I don't
know if you are genetically blessed or have a better mental approach to it
or both, but I still suspect that nicotine is REALLY addictive.  Most of
my friends from high school that just wanted to "try it" are still smoking
today.

Hmm...  Well, it seems to me like the alcohol "scene" seems to encourage
driving under the influence, as well.  I mean, you go to a bar/club, get 
loaded, the place closes, what are you gonna do?  In an ideal world, the
driver's been sobering up for a couple of hours, but it doesn't always
happen, and as you say, there's a lot of folks drinking out there.  At
raves there seems to be more recognition of the fact that, yes, you're
going to have to go home at some point.

Although, maybe it has less to do with the "scene" than with the pacing
of the drug.  Booze is an "incremental" drug where you can drink another
beer, get a bit more loaded.  Repeat at relatively short intervals of
time for added fun :)  With  pills it seems more "all or nothing," pop
something and you know you're committed for x number of hours.  So maybe
you're more psychologically prepared that way, "Okay, for the next x
hours I'm not even going to THINK about driving, then after that I should
be okay."

Or maybe I'm just looking at the world through rose colored glasses and
there are a lot more people driving high than I think?

	Well it isn't simple.  You can't just look at federal spending...  I 
seem to recall the federal gov't was initially charged with very little *but* 
military spending, with the states and municipalities handling the rest.  The 
balance has changed a bit this century, but still to figure out how the money 
taken from a citizen by legal force of arms is spent you have to add up:

	Federal taxes
	State taxes
	Property tax
	Federal, State and Local Sales tax (inc. gas, liquor, cigs, etc).
	Tolls for public roads/bridges, incl. parking
	...

	Basically anything collected by someone with a gov't badge when you 
haven't committed a crime.  Then you have to do a calculation where you figure 
out that citizens contibution in each area (defense, infrastructure, education, 
research, welfare, retirement, etc), which means estimating the total amount 
collected from that person by each tax, taking the percentages, classifying, 
adding them together, and dividing by the total to get the total percentages.

	Enough info is public to do a pretty good job of this (I think), but 
since it varies from individual to individual its hard to calculate.  I'd love 
to see a web site that took some basic info -- zip code, homeowner status, and 
income, for instance -- and made a pie chart.

	Then to be really interesting you could subtract out the benefits that 
individual receives -- health care, road use, education, gov't salary, welfare, 
etc (don't forget "protection") -- and find out which end of the stick they're 
holding...  Of course, handling intangibles like "liberty" and "security" is 
difficult (how much more should they cost you the more you make?  What if you 
don't want them, or like the kind you get for your money?).

As evidenced by some of the mail here, not only have they lost the work 
ethic for themselves, but they want those of us who have a work ethic to 
indefinitely support, without question or requirement, the bums that don't.

My girlfriend is coming into town today and she'll be here for a week.
Unfortunately I still have to work during the day.  I was wondering if
any cool things were going on next week during the day that she could go
to.  Also what are some good things to do around the bay area at night
next week.  (18+ things for the most part)

Thanks,

This is such a healthy, reasonable attitude that I had to look at it twice to make sure
my eyes weren't deceiving me.  I warn you that this approach can be quite expensive
in the short term, and will require more money than is currently being spent.  Alot of
people ( i.e. Republicans) aren't willing to consider such a long term view and have
pushed to cut such training programs in the past for the purpose of tax cuts to their
contributors.

Oh no...I've become involved...I really did try not to...Just feeling political I guess.

Take care,

Boy, don't I just LOOOOVE mornings @ work after dancing all night long... >=P

Well I went 2 Wish last night and I'd like to thank all of the SFR familily
that helped make it a success.  I must admit, without US the vibe just
wouldn't be there. It felt like what I'd assume ComeUnity was when it first
started.  And I realley enjoyed the non-club feel, bumping into each other
(and getting bumped into) w/o any negative 'tudes being thrown around...

I tend to shy away from clubs but I'm actually glad I made it out.
Hope to see some of you again @ F-8, dancing like CrAzY (& how my feet will
feel it...).

BTW: For thoses who dont know me, I was the one dancing shirtless for most of
the night (when I had the t-shirt on, it was black)...


"Dance with me.."

I'm not really into the Come-Unity scene at all but I went last night in
support of Andrew aka Astral Matrix.  Garth was on when I got there playing
some pretty good funky stuff but then got more into the "Can you feel it"
kind of housey stuff that drives me crazy.  I went outside and talked to
some friends paying close attention to my watch waiting for the clock to
strike two.  Just before two I went into the ladies room to make sure I
wouldn't have to leave in the middle of his performance and realized once
again why I don't really like Come-Unity.  I'm not going to get into it.
Now on with the review.  He started off with what I think was Pink Floyd's
Dark Side of the Moon.  Whatever it was it was wonderful. Then he brought
in the beats.  That unmistakable Astral Matrix acid sound was pounding
against the walls and back to him.  People were very excited and pushing
their way to the front to see who was responsible.  Played some slamming
stuff that I haven't heard before.  It has been a long time since I have
heard Andrew play anything.  The last song he ended with was probably my
favorite of the night as I have only recently started appreciating all that
jungle has to offer.  It was a slamming drum n' bass track but had a
soothing melodic kind of sound over top to give it an extremely well
produced sound.  I had a fabulous time and couldn't help but think about
seeing him in the desert at Burning Man.  There are going to be so many
things to do, see, and take, but I must say that by far I'm looking forward
to hearing Andrew yet again but this time out on the playa in the middle of
the desert.  See you there!!!!

	Umm, I guess you've never heard of the US government, or heard of people 
who didn't pay their taxes.  What happens in Germany if you don't pay?  I'm 
pretty sure you will eventually see some guns.  We here in the US have some nice 
folks called the IRS.  They have an enforcement arm.  These are some very 
special police. Debtors prison doesn't work, so other methods of coersion must 
be used.

	I'm not against taxes, but assuming that everyone will gladly pay for 
people who don't feel like working is the real fantasy.  And if not everyone 
pays, those who do will slowly pay more and more as more and more people start 
to get tired of paying.  Isn't there something called the "tragedy of the 
commons"?

	Nor am I denying that the main objective of collecting taxes (at the 
US federal level) is to buy more guns.

find yourself some porn mpeg's.

that's what I do with my extra HD space...

porn, porn, porn. Just can't get enough of that wonderful porn. I got porn
in my system folder, porn that opens automatically on startup, porn icons
on my desktop, porn fonts, a secret porn section on my webpage, a little
extension that changes all the "cancel" buttons to read "porn," a porn
spreadsheet app (row porn, cell porn!), and 56Mb of porn stock photographs
in my images folder --jpegged!


if you repeat a wod enough, it loses it's meaning... I've just erased
"porn" from my vocabulary... what does "porn" mean?

Yep. Hate 'em for exactly the reasons you put forward. The happiest
time of my recent life was the year or so after i moved from
Wollongong, a soulless suburban satellite city of Sydney, into Sydney's
old inner suburbs.

Maybe explain to your beloved just how much you're uncomfortable with
the situation, and see if you can come to some compromise.  Maybe she's
got an unrealistic idea of what living in the city is like. The media
image of inner cities isn't exactly balanced.

Good luck!

Jeremy, who's really thrilled because he's just got accepted for a
beautiful old appartment in downtown San Jose.

   I'll probably be dead friday night after f-8, but I'm dying to listen to
some GOA this saturday with fuckin' caban ripping it up! But first of all I
would like to know, when does this party kick off? Is it really in Santa
Cruz? Is it a day party or is a night party? But most importantly of all,
if anyone happens to live in the sf/east bay and are heading over whenever,
my friend and I would really appreciate a ride there, complete with good
vibes and gas money...

Unfortunately, I'm leaving for the Midwest on Sunday, for another 
semester of school. I won't be back in the Bay Area for a while :( so 
this is going to be the last weekend I see you guys :(

I can't express what a wonderful summer its been right now.. so I'll get 
straight to the point:

Friday: Hunny, N.A.S.A., F8, FedEx
	 I think i'm going to have to go to Hunny. Normally, I would go 
	 F8 parties without a second thought, but this one is indoors..
	 hmm. N.A.S.A seems to be the only outdoor party.. is anyone going
	 to it? i'd like to be outside one last time.....

Saturday: Nation, How Deep?...
	 Nation.. is anyone going to How Deep? Is there anything else going
	 on sunday night? maybe out on a beach? hmm..

Sunday: departure :P

right now it sounds like Hunny and How Deep? and maybe also F8..

Tristan, have you ever read "Atlas Shrugged" by Ayn Rand?  I'm more of an
objectivist than anything.  I do not agree with you about me not being able
to afford my computer (or whatever) should their be no welfare recipiants.
Where ever did you get that?  Also in an anarchy, everyone would not be paid
the same. That is text book socialism.  We could do well in an anarchy
provided everyone would leave everyone else alone.  But there is too much
hatred, fear, crime, LIES and GREED for this to happen.  

I like most of the other stuff you wrote.  I doubt seriously if the New
Republic, which was written a very, very, very long time ago could even
begin to address pointedly the issues we are facing today.  I do think,
however, it is a wonderful book and a valuable tool.  Capitolism = freedom.
There is no other formula because of the nature of human beings.

Thanks so much for relating your story!  I really feel for you and the 
trouble you're going through.  YOU are the kind of person that support 
programs were originally put in place for.  The problem as I see it is that 
the assumption was made that people had the integrity to use only as much as 
they needed to get back on their feet.

I absolutely agree with you about education and daycare.  I honestly feel 
that reform of support services should come in three parts: 

1. Strict limits.  The number of years a person capable of gainful 
employment can collect the services, primarily.

2. Expansion of services to include college and training funding and daycare.

3. Incentives to businesses to hire people in the program and keep them on 
for a minimum of 2 years.

The expanded services would require a LARGE up front investment, but the 
payoff would be more and more people permanently off the dole with real 
skills, real jobs, and real experience.

I know this doesn't really apply much to your situation.  It sounds like 
your private hell is being created by Worker's Comp. problems.

Hmmm.....  I am not sure if I completely agree with your statements in 
the above paragraph.  Maybe I should start with smoking - I quit 3 1/2 
weeks ago after 10-11 years of smoking.  The only times I crave a smoke 
is early in the morning after partying all night (going to after party 
and watching other people smoke).  Maybe I am different than other 
people, maybe I just didn't get addicted to nicotin (I could not imagine 
wearing a patch or chewing Nicoret because that's just nasty - I enjoyed 
the ritual of smoking).  Maybe getting off heroin (if I was addicted to 
it) or any other drug would be as easy for me as getting off cigaretts, 
but I can't tell (considering that I wasn't addicted to anything except 
for chocolate at one point :P).  But, I know many people would not agree 
with me - I am sharing my personal (as well as 2 of my roommates 
expereinces because we all quit smoking).
(SNIP)
It's called self control.  I have it as well.  In the ongoing course of
raving (Wow, almost 7 yrs. now) I've been introduced to almost every known
"Recreational Drug" and binged on them from time to time... But I choose not
to contenue usage.   To this day, I smoke non-tobacco products about once
every 4 months (If not longer).  Anything else stronger is consumed more on
an anuall basis.  I don't smoke cigaretts, & only drink alcohol in social
situations(ie. offered a drink, and it would be rude to refuse).  

The other statement that I didn't like was that alcohol leads to auto 
accidents...  I agree with you, but it just sounded like other 
recreational drugs (I just love that term :)) don't.  I have seen people 
so messed up on E, acid or whatever that they can hardly walk.  I can't 
even imagine one of them trying to drive a car.  Don't you think that 
auto accidents would be caused as well?  I think the reason there are not 
as many accidents like those is because there are less people using those 
drugs vs. alcohol. 
Ive driven on Alcohol, pot, LSD,ketamaine (Boy was THAT hard)..    And
although im not ness. PROUD of my accompishments , it's mostly control (& a
bit of luck)that kept me from being caught.

Well, I can tell you a little breakdown of Bukem's name.  

1) "LTJ" = DJ in Italy
2) Bukem = Book'em (from the expression "Book'em Dano")

I just hope people dance, instead of mostly standing around watching as
happens a lot in the BA (at least at parties where jungle is not the
primary genre). I thought it was interesting how in the basement
of 1015 last night, they had thin drapes partially covering the dance area 
around the dj (Jonah, the time I checked), who was spinning jungle and
more downtempo breakbeat.  Any spectating that was done was of dancers'
silhouettes -- silhouettes that were purposefully projected onto one of
the drapes to absolutely beautiful effect.  This was one time I didn't
mind just sitting around and watching.  The broad daylight might deter
the timid... but who knows?  Maybe these visiting dj's will help bring
jungle to a new light.    

Rok.

Fellow Groovers...just wanted to let those of you who were not able to
attend Reggae on the River '96 that it was a BLAST! I had soooo much fun
just hangin' out in the sun, feelin' IRIE and listnin' to Reggae.  We
happened to get one of the BEST (IMHO) campsites on the river (for those of
you who went, we were right at the entrance to the main swimming area). 

Just some time to relax and chill out with good people and good vibes.
could it get better???

 YES!!! ...just so happened that 3 campsites down was the "funky-futuristic"
but "retro" Wicked bus with the crew. So after the reggae show let out on
Saturday night, the luggage doors on the side of bus came up to reveal Phat
speakers and rekkids, the turntables came out, and we had GARTH on the
river! It was so much fun! Me and my buddies grabbed our glowsticks and
busted the groove until about 4am Sunday morning when they finally made them
shut down because of noise...

Then after the last show Sunday night, they busted out with the beats again!
This time it was a different DJ that I didn't recognize. He busted out the
house grooves mixed with some niiiice reggae beats...till about 4am. Does
anyone know who that DJ was???
If anyone was there, I was the one with the black "hemp" hat on with the big
checkered jacked and Big Happy-Ass-Perma-Grin on... =P

Woke up the next morning sitting upright in a lawn chair...feeling great...
it's a beautiful thing =)

And so as we're driving back towards the bay area, I'm thinking..
"Awwwwwwwwww Yeah! This is just what I needed..A little time away from the
hectic-ism of working and responsibilities....as well as a booster shot of
house music to rekindle the internal flame o' funk...Yeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaah!
=) =) =)

Lookin' forward to groovin' wit ch'all soon,

Morgan

ps. If anyone from the Wicked crew monitors this list, I just wanted to say
thanks! You guys multiplied the fun factor bigtime!


*** Put your head back, reach up as FAR as you can, and smile as BIG as you
can. Now do you see?! The Perma-Grin will be with you...always. ;) ***

Seinfeld-isms
>From the Washington Post:

What's with the people who put carpeting on the lid of their toilet
seat?  What are they thinking -- "Gosh, if we have a party there may not
be enough standing room; I'd better carpet the toilet too."

What's with this weird hotel custom of leaving a peice of chocolate on
the pillow?  I awoke thinking my brain had hemorrhaged some sort of
fecal matter.

Have you ever noticed that the waiter who takes your order is not the
one who brings your food anymore? What is THAT about?  And which waiter
are you tipping, anyway? I think next time I go to a restaurant I'll
just say, "Oh, sorry, I only eat the food.  The guy who pays the bill
will be along shortly."

Whould somebody please explain to me those signs that say, "No animals
allowed except for Seeing Eye Dogs?" Who is that sign for?  Is it for
the dog, or the blind person?

Why do people give each other flowers? To celebrate various important
occasions, they're killing living creatures? Why restrict it to plants?
"Sweetheart, let's make up.  Have this deceased squirrel."

Can't we just get rid of wine lists? Do we really have to be reminded
every time we go out to a nice restaurant that we have no idea what we
are doing? Why don't they just give us a trigonometry quiz with the
menu?

If airline seat cushions are such great flotation devices, why don't you
ever see anyone take one to the beach?

Why do they call it a "building"? It looks like they're finished.  Why
isn't it a "built"?

Why is it when you turn on the TV you see ads for telephone companies,
and when you turn on the radio you hear ads for TV shows, and when you
get put on hold on the phone you hear a radio station?

Why is it illegal to park in a handicapped parking space but okay to go
the bathroom in a handicapped stall?

How come you have to pay someone to rotate your tires?  Isn't that the
basic idea behind the wheel?  Don't they rotate on their own?

All the king's HORSES and all the king's men? Are you kidding me?  No
wonder they couldn't put Humpty together again. Just what did those
idiots expect the horses to do, anyway?

Did you ever notice, when you are sitting at a red light, that when the
person in front of you pulls up a couple of inches, you are compelled to
move up too? Do we really think we are making progress toward our
destination? "Whew, I thought we would be late, but now that I am nine
inches closer, I can stop for coffee and a danish!"

Isn't it weird that we drink milk, stuff designed to nourish baby cows?
How did THAT happen?  Did some cattleman once say, "Oh, man, I can't
wait till them calves are done so I can get ME a hit of that stuff."

Have you ever noticed how they keep improving your laundry detergent,
but they still can't get those blue flakes out?  Why do we trust them to
get our clothes clean?  These guys can't even get the DETERGENT white!

Did you see these new minivan ads?  All they talk about are cup holders,
kiddie seats and doors.  What kind of advertising is that?  When you see
an ad for a suit, do they say, "And look at the zipper!  Carefully
hidden, but easily accessible when you need it!" I think not.

Who is this guy Louis Freeh who is head of the FBI? People keep calling
him Louie, like he was the king of France or something. And what's this
with his last name?  What does this mean, that he gives away the letter
H?

Sometimes suburbs can be nice.

El Cerrito, where I live 'cause the rents are cheap and it's got TWO whole
BART stations, started out kind of as a suburb.

Now it's just about as urban as you can get and still have lots of trees,
room for kids to play, and places for taking long walks.

Did I mention the rents are cheap?  $650 for a 2-bedroom fourplex apt.  

Any more El Cerrito ravers out there?

That doesn't make it RIGHT. The feds need to give up some of their billion

funding in site for new ones.  Even for history!  The maps and info in these
donosaurs made my teacher for World History nuts!  He eventually just gave up
and made photocopies of the J.C. text used near us and passed them out AT HIS
EXPENSE(and illegaly, I might add)!  That is simply wrong!

"Little boxes, on the hillside, and they're all made out of ticky-tacky,

And they all meet, at the golf course, and they all drink their martinis dry,

This is an excerpt from a song my mom taught me as a child.  It was written
by a woman who was locally famous in the berkeley area in the late 50's-early
60's.  My mom was always a little out of it [for a non-drug using,
semi-but-not-realy-hippy:)], so she can't remember who it was, or just how
famous this wise woman was.  Anyone out there ever heard it?  It really stuck
in my head.

Since the 50's, housing has grown in a way different than ever before.  It
used to be that a town would grow slowly out of need for one in an area (a
factory site, a mine operation, etc.), and people would move there and build
houses on plots of land on a street/road in the rural area.  Now, they build
all the houses, streets and mini malls first, with 5' inbetween each one, and
then move in the people.  This causes a severe lack of community, which IMHO
retards respect between people in the area.  This is in part why people are
so uptight and unfriendly these days.  If a community were allowed to _build_
instead of being pre-fab, then I think it would promote individuality which
is the healthy human condition, again IMHO. Just my .02

Just got off the Nation information line and heard something I feared might
happen -- They shut down the Pier 45 location.

According to the voicemail, the Mayor's office went back on its word.  They
are urging everyone to call him (well, his secretary, actually) and tell
them how pissed off you are.  I sort of have a hard time doing that after
seeing a half-page ad for the party in the SF Weekly (after all, what did
they expect would happen after doing such high-profile promotion?)  But
it's kindof a bummer, since this would have been the first decent massive
in the city in quite a while.


I wonder if they'll be able to pull this off somewhere else?

I had a chance to check out the MC303 recently and it is really cool!  Although, It doesnt sound anything like a TB303.  At least the sounds that I heard, I didnt get too deep into it.  It has all your basic generic techno sounds, preset patterns that you can copy into user patterns and edit, or you can create your own patterns.  Its basiclly an 'Insta-Techno' Box.  You dont need to know anything about writting music to use the thing.  Its got a Tap Tempo button on it for the DJ's so you can easily sync it up to your records.  The downside is the sounds are not editable, other than Filter Cutoff and Resonance, which sounds really cool on the drums.  Its deffinatly worth picking up.  Its cheap ($895 retail, I've been quoted $550 street price).  Its  a great tool for getting idea's down and then sending the sequence to your computer and adding better sounds or whatever.

You might also look at Roland's MC-303 -- it's supposed to clone
a few of the popular x0x's in one easy-to-tote box.

My mother taught me that as a kid too - in Dunedin, New Zealand. There
was quite a strong beat-generation thing happening in that little
university town in the late 50's - early 60's (right down to sit-ins at
the university), and suburban blight is no respecter of international
borders and thousands of miles of ocean. :)

While i'm in reminiscing-about-my-home-town mode: I was back there in
late June (I've lived outside NZ for nearly 6 years, and outside
Dunedin for nearly 9) and found one of the best underground Goa parties
i've ever been to: especially amazing, considering the population is
only 100,000.

If there isn't I will volunteer to provide one if people think that's a

"Little boxes, on the hillside, and they're all made out of ticky-tacky,
little boxes, little boxes, and they all look just the same

There's a green one, and a blue one, and a red one and a yellow one, and
they're all made out of ticky-tacky and they all look just the same

And there's doctors, and there's lawyers, and there's buisness executives and
they all have pretty children and they all go to pretty schools.

And they all meet, at the golf course, and they all drink their martinis dry,
and they're all made out of ticky-tacky and they all look just the same..."

This is an excerpt from a song my mom taught me as a child.  It was written
by a woman who was locally famous in the berkeley area in the late 50's-early
60's.  My mom was always a little out of it [for a non-drug using,
semi-but-not-realy-hippy:)], so she can't remember who it was, or just how
famous this wise woman was.  Anyone out there ever heard it?  It really stuck
in my head.

Since the 50's, housing has grown in a way different than ever before.  It
used to be that a town would grow slowly out of need for one in an area (a
factory site, a mine operation, etc.), and people would move there and build
houses on plots of land on a street/road in the rural area.  Now, they build
all the houses, streets and mini malls first, with 5' inbetween each one, and
then move in the people.  This causes a severe lack of community, which IMHO
retards respect between people in the area.  This is in part why people are
so uptight and unfriendly these days.  If a community were allowed to _build_
instead of being pre-fab, then I think it would promote individuality which
is the healthy human condition, again IMHO. Just my .02

After some fruitless searching on the web, i asked my late 40s
office-mate. The answer is:
   Malvina Reynolds
   
Have a look at
ftp://ftp.leo.org/pub/rec/music/vocal/lyrics/uwp/folk/l/little_boxes
for some slightly different lyrics.

Apparently she also sang Morningtown Ride.

	Or just because at underground parties, things tend to be 
centered toward a social setting for the most part where people interact 
(this whole thing about the burning man participate thread could be tied 
in here). Few people in SF seem to be social once the nitrous comes out 
so from the expereince of watching parties become loads of people sitting 
around sucking on balloons, disconnected, the underground scene I would 
think has gotten fed up with it taking a party that was amassing energy 
and then have the people sucking down nitrous disapate that energy. In 
other places, nitrous doesn't seem to burn people in quite the same way, 
so the drug ain't the problem, it is how people react after taking the 
drug.

	Quick comment. Alcohol's effects seem to be dependent on the 
culture you are consuming it in. Yes, around here alcohol tends to act as 
an excuse for people to allow a certain side of the culture/bred 
insecurities (ok, I am talking out my perception arse here) to be 
released or acted upon. In other places, people either are not brought up 
in such a way that the cause of whatever the alcohol relaxes to be 
present, or they learn to not relax that part of them, in effect, the 
problem is not one that other people have to deal with, it is something 
the individual has to deal with.

	I would agree with the relucance to critize one for their drug 
intake. It is the behavior that one exhibits that is objectional. If one 
cannot keep oneself "in control" or at least surround themselves with 
friends or people that can handle the "uncontrolled" behavior then they 
are not being responsible for their actions and that I feel can be 
condemned to great lengths. There are times when shit will hit the fan a 
lot harder than one expects, but shouldn't that be the occasional and not 
the habitual use?

	There was a broadcast on NPR a while back about how the drug laws 
came into effect through Nixons campaigning for whatever offices he was 
running for; it was by the author of a book called Smoke and Mirrors: A 
story of American drugs" (or something like that - the Smoke and Mirrors 
part I remember). Anyway, I have been looking for this book now, if 
anyone gets a hold of it, can you tell me where? He sounded quite in the 
know, and while he said he was not in favor of legalization, he thought 
the perception of the American public on drugs has gone rampart and that 
most claims the DEA makes about what will happen if ANY scheduled drugs 
get legalized for any purpose is a load of shit... Anyway, read away...

   Basically, it means that you made an SSL connection to their
site.  These certificates are most commonly issued by VeriSign (for
Netscape Commerce Server) or possibly by some other CA if it's an
Apache-SSL server.  The signature from a "trusted" CA helps prevent
against man-in-the-middle attacks against RSA.

   That was my first thought, too, but any arbitrary CGI can issue
cookies whether or not it's running on an SSL [cert-needing] server,
so I kinda doubt it.

   No, they don't have a site certificate for you.  It means that you
trust that their SSL-speaking server (in this case HTTPS) is who it
says it is as opposed to a man in the middle.  I'll illustrate:

   One possible attack against public-key cryptosystems w/o
certificates like this is as follows.

	a. You want to encrypt something to Eve.  You contact Eve's
	   host, and ask for her public key.
        b. An interceptor catches that request, masquerading as Eve's
	   host.  Since TCP/IP doesn't have real connection-level
	   authentication, you don't know this.  The intruder sends 
	   you a public key that it controls the private key for, and
	   catches Eve's public key from the real Eve.
	c. You encrypt using this (fake) public key from the
	   interceptor.  It decrypts the message, using its private
	   key, then reencrypts it with Eve's public key and sends it
	   to her, keeping a copy of the plaintext.

    The certificate is a signed document from a
Netscape-binary-trusted source, like VeriSign, that says "this public
key really does belong to the site it claims to."

    This doesn't grant them any special access to your machine.

   Well, sort of.  

   It's got sampled sounds of the x0x's, but it doesn't do analogue
generation of the sound.

   It does look remarkably cool, though.

Perhaps I am being a bit dull or am just in a mood...but who cares if we 
have found some microbes that may have existed on a meteorite that may 
have come from Mars several million years ago!!!???

Could these microbes have appeared on the meteorite as it crashed on to 
earth or even picked them up while hurtling through space???
And even if it did come from Mars who cares, there is nothing on Mars now 
or maybe we'll find out more when we spend all this money to launch probes in a 
couple months.

We could be spending this money in so many other different programs that are 
necessary for people to live and to keep living right now...if we don't 
start curbing population growth and the ills befalling our environment 
and so many other things there won't be any life left on earth either in a 
couple hundred years...and perhaps in a couple billion years someone on 
some other planet will find out that there once was microbes living on earth 
too, yahooo...

Maybe we will find some new chemical form that cures AIDS and cancer by 
exploring space but if we just explored our planet more and spent some 
more money on research here then we could find those cures here on our 
planet.

Getting off the soapbox now...geez I need to get off work and go have 
some fun!!!

Peace,
G

Gonna have to second this statement. I just built a FatMan last week. Very
cheap(170), very easy(takes around 30-35 hours to build). Easily emulates a
303, not to mention longer drone sounds and other creative synth uses. With
the FatMan you get more than a little bass station. Midi implementation
includes pitch bend only, but CVs are included for gate,pitch,velocity, so
you can actual sync certain aspects of the sound to an analog rhythmer.

Electronics aspect is basically just like following model instructions.
Very easy. Modifications can be easily performed based on your need(LFO,
Subharmonic Generator). As you determine what you want you can also come up
with your own. This is a great introduction to electonics for muscial
purposes. PAiA also has lots of cool little kits like phase shifters, ring
modulators and other good experiments.

This is not a self contained acid box though. It is more and less. No
sequencer, no on the fly grooves. Just cool analog sounds made in 1994 =)+)

Hope this helps.

   Does anyone know where the How Deep? party is going to be?  My
friend from Chicago is coming out on Saturday, and we'd like to go to
help him unwind from his flight (12:30).

the Perseid meteor shower is at its peak the morning of August 12, around 
3 or 4 am.  look to the northeast.  they're predicting up to 100 meteors 
per hour.  you should see some nice ones on the 10th and 11th too if you 
look :)

I agree with the first part, but the second I have problems with. It is not 
up to me to decide what political philosophies others must adhere to be 
considered a "raver." Doing that would be judgemental, and in my opinion, 
incorrect. When you become entrenched in socioeconomic/political/religious
dogma and offer that as the "official" party line, you begin to turn 
away people that you once would have welcomed with open arms. People 
have to find their own truths. Far too often people are spoon-fed their 
truths by their government, their religious leaders, their political 
party, etc. Invite people in. Allow them find their own truths.

You assume incorrectly, and one has little to do with the other. 
Comparing NEA funded artists, who are offering something back to society 
in the form of their art vs. those who are doing nothing, are two 
different things entirely. Furthermore, I never made a presumption that 
people on welfare were doing this as an expression of freedom. I was 
addressing the subject of those individuals that David Lowe chooses to 
support because they wish to live as subversives. I have stereotyped no 
one, and have oversimplified nothing. All I have said is that I do not 
wish to support those that choose to live outside of society, offering 
nothing, and taking much.

And this is what I have a hard time reconciling: Your caution against

What evidence is there that the current system is not functioning as

As a drain on the economy, most certainly. And I wholeheartedly agree 
that the "war on drugs" is costing more than welfare, and is a serious 
waste of revenue. The problem with these type of arguments however, is 
that they divert attention from the issue at hand. These tactics are used 
within the government all the time, and in my opinion is why nothing ever 
gets done. Want to talk about welfare? Let's talk about welfare. Want to 
talk about the bloated war machine the U.S. maintains? Let's talk about 
that. But when you are discussing one issue, stick to it.

By all means, I made the effort to find some statistics to validate my 
feelings, if you are going to make claims based on your feelings, find the 
numbers to substantiate them. 

I have provided you with some indication that an alternate approach may 
help slow or alter the deteroration, and you counter with conjecture.

This article was based on a study done over several months, and by the 
fact that it was done over a period of several months, refutes your 
assertation.

I have never stated that this is the absolute solution to the problem. 
There are several things that need to be done, including adequate 
day-care for the working poor, vocational training, and a host of other 
items. But handing people money in perpetuity for nothing, as is being 
done now is not the answer.

Do you know? Please provide any data that you have to this effect.

And your statement is a good example of how to avoid the subject by invoking

Then by all means, if they can't find jobs, let's put them to work. 
The re-introduction of public work projects would be a great starting 
point. If they can't find work, and are willing to work making our 
country a better place in whatever capacity, by all means let's allow 
them to stay on welfare. But do not continue to allow people to sit on 
their asses collecting money for nothing.

Who said cutting the system? Not I. Altering, absolutely. 

It is rather silly to attempt to give "substantial evidence" of the results 
of a proposal before putting it to in effect. 

It also would be nice if we could stick to the issue at hand. All these 
problems are big enough to be dealt with one at a time.

Well, at least that is a start.

And what exactly does "an Asian political bloc not necessarily aligned

I just heard on the 10 o'clock news that there is a 1/100 chance that if
you are caucasian, male or female, you could possibly have a natural
resistance to the HIV virus.  They have been watching and studying two gay
males who have repeatedly had unsafe sex with numerous partners not knowing
whether these men they were having sex with had the virus or not.  The
study is going to be published in the upcoming Journal of Science and
Medicine.  That was all the info. I got on the news although, Dennis
Richmond did also mention that this gene or whatever it is, I can't
remember, must be passed on from both the father and the mother.   Do you
know how many caucasian people there are on this earth?  1/100 is alot of
people with chances of not picking up the virus even when engaging in
unsafe sex or needle use.  I'm sure it will be in the papers so keep your
eyes peeled for it.

I think we have gone through this before: TALK TO *ME* 

I never posted anything good or bad about McDonalds, or working in 
advertising. You make sweeping generalizations, putting all "California 
ravers" into a specific category, and do not seem to be able to 
differenciate statements made by various *individuals* Verstehen Sie?

I challenge you to show where I have ever expressed *hatred* towards people 
that do not work and produce "litters of children." I have said the 
following two things:

1) The current system supports women having litters of children.
2) I do not wish to pay for those who choose not to work and want me to 
   support them.

Now, you could probably reasonably say that I hold a certain level of 
disdain for both groups, however hatred is a very powerful and draining 
emotion, and one I would not invest.

Because by your statements, have already decided what is "useful." You 
can judge my job as "good" or "bad" but when everything is said and done 
how *I* feel about myself and what I am doing is what matters.

To them it may very well be. All one can ever attempt to do in this 
regard is work at a job that you feel good about.

Your field doesn't do any good for anyone? No one in your field has ever 
proposed something, postulated something, or made any positve 
contribution to the field of science?

Is luxury valueless? Personally, I prefer wiping my butt with soft tissue 
rather than leaves, running water is a delight, and hey, four walls and a 
roof beat a drafty cave any day of the week.

Define "really needed."

You are confusing the issues. I never stated that the China was about to 
invade the U.S. or visa versa. You asked what possible reason China 
would have for doing so. That is the question I was answering. A reason 
does not equate to intent(necessarily.)

Time and time again, the U.S. has found reasons to get involved in 
conflicts that are not their own.

Well, I feel that your experiment has failed miserably. However, being a 
paranoid schizophrenic, I would ask my other self, but if I did they 
would catch me. You know my other self is out to get me, right?

I wasn't aware that the MC303 was digital samples of a TB303. I'm an
analog snob when it comes to synthesizers; although I did have a blast
playing the new Korg Prophecy. More tweaking knobs than I've ever seen
(for a digital synth, that is) and just some killer patches.

I need to clarify my position:

My statement about alcohol and auto accidents was meant to point out
that it is a very dangerous drug, and yet it is legal. It wasn't meant
to say that driving under the influence of other drugs is any
safer. Alcohol makes one tired, and lose sense of judgement and
awareness. Often times one doesn't feel inebriated, and it lends
towards irrational behavior. On the other hand, ravers who partake in 
alternative substances tend to be more aware of their condition, and 
are less likely to drive under the influence (my personal opinion, 
based on the experiences of friends). So why should alcohol be any 
more legal than marijuana, MDMA, psylocybin (SP?) mushrooms, GBH,
or LSD, among others?

Our government's stance on drugs is purely arbitrary. It could be 
argued that our drug laws violate our constitutional right to freedom 
of expression. Until very recently, no one in office has dared step 
forward, and speak out against the so-called "war on drugs", and 
propose reforming our laws. Even now, it is still very much a grass 
roots effort (and a feeble one at that). 

Actually, I think that ravers who partake in such alternative 
substances instead of alcohol tend to be more aware of their 
condition, anyway, and are less likely to drive under the influence. 
By the time the party is over, the effects have worn off.  

BTW, I knew a couple of classmates from my high school who got into a
car accident after smoking pot. One of them is paralyzed from the
waist down for the rest of his life. The other was in physical rehab
for six months. It was not a pretty sight.

if you dont have any skills what are you going to do? of course you're 
going to flip burgers. if people didnt treat high school like shit, get 
an education, and then apply to colleges (and if the schools took people 
based on grades, not "who's a minority") then they wouldnt be flipping 
burgers for 4.25 an hour. "oh but there's no money to go to college." 
fine then, take out a loan. graduate. get a job, pay the loan back. if 
people put some effort into things, they wouldnt have to be on welfare. 

and for those who just cant do it, fine then. there are still jobs out 
there for people with almost no education. UPS. pays 8.35 an hour. part 
time. full medical/dental/vision. stock options. .50 raise every year, 
1.00 raise on the 4th year. union protection.

thats just loading/unloading trucks. 

if people got off they butts and looked they could find a lot of jobs out 
there for what they are qualified for.

Ya, I'll second that!!  The Prophecy is the coolest synth I've heard since the Morpheus.  There are a couple of patches in the Prophecy that sound more like a 303 than the MC-303.  The Morpheus is also a good synth for psudo-303ish sounds because of its amazing filters.

Subject: Nation Lost their site...
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com

  I received a call last night from a friend telling me that Nation lost the 
  site for their gig (at Pier 45).  There's been alot of planning and for 
  the plug to be pulled at the last minute, it's very upsetting and 
  difficult to find a new venue.  Evidentally, Enrique (sp?) is getting alot 
  of run around from the city and no answers as to why they lost the site.  
  My friend, Ramiro (who's pretty political) mentioned that this was really 
  a case of discrimination of the type of party more than anything else.  He 
  asked that as many people call to complain to the Mayor's ofc.  The phone 
  number is 415.554.6490.
  
  I called the number this morning, and per Mayor Brown's spokesman, da 
  mayor is very cautious to release a statement until he receives all the 
  facts.  The spokesman said he's received calls from as far as Seattle and 
  Chicago, so I guess things are already underway.  In any case, I thought 
  I'd pass this on in case you want to voice your opinion.  And if you feel 
  compelled to, please pass this onto anyone else who might be affected by 
  this or understands the situation--after all...isn't it time we really let 
  the city of SF, much less the Bay Area know how many raving voters 
  contribute to the economy and overall city scene affirming the diversity 
  and positive energy shared?
  
  Have a great Friday and I hope to see some of you out there dancing this 
  weekend!
  
  Lotsa love 'n hugs,
  Diane

As I guess everyone knows, the Bay Guardian has a couple articles about 
SF's underground scene.  The articles are good, but I think it is kind of 
ironic that they are brining above ground the "underground."  It saddens 
me in a way.  I'm not sad that the "scene" is more popular.  I'm glad 
that there are lots of wonderful people with whom to share it.  I'm just 
worried a bit about this "outing" of the scene.  What if some of us don't 
want it outed?  But, maybe that's selfish.  I just really admire and love 
the way information is disseminated by word of mouth and phones and 
computers.  I'd hate to see this disappear.  But, I guess as long as 
there are dedicated people, there will be a dedicated "scene."

I didn't think the Oakland Hills was actually a suburb.  It's still 
urban, just not as urban as a downtown area.  I though suburbs were off 
shoots of urban areas like Walnut Creek and Concord.  The 
Berkeley/Oakland Hills is still pretty much city.  But, correct me if I'm 
wrong.  Hey, I came from a very rural town, so what do I know?  :)

Dear All;

        Didn't you all know that according to our clueless ancestors who
settled this country that life as we know it is supposed to be long,
painful, unenjoyable except for church, and totally & absolutely work ridden
until the day we die. Also, that anyone who thinks otherwise should either
be converted or if that fails killed.

Peace
Brian

Dear All;

        I strongly recommend, that people on this list that feel strongly
against Socialism, & Communism go out and date someone for a length of time
who grew up in those governmental environments, & I guarantee it will change
you and your isolated little world, as it did me. Or go there and live in
one of these countries for a length of time and know what it is to be a
Communist or Socialist.

        We American's God forbid never travel to live and experience other
places like many of our European counterparts. They have a much better
global understanding of the planet that we could ever imagine. Even in this
day and age we are still the isolated and clueless America.

Peace

Isn't Nation scheduled for Saturday?  Tonight there's Hunny, Frequency 8

Yeah, that was what he told me too.  Apparently, da Mayor is "currently in a

Yes, and the big news is that since I wasn't so happy to not be able to

and convice to add 3 more rows. Those seat will be free, EXCEPT, you
will have to be naked and painted with some satanic drawings (the painters
will provided by HELCO for a small fee, or you can do it ourself).
To register for this "program", get to the HELCO campsite as soon as
you arrive on the Playa, naked (because they will either to check your
painting or they'll  paint you). Don't forget to bring your id, because
they will have to take your name (if you're under 21, forget it, the TV
will be there, and the Project doesn't want any problems with the justice).
BTW, the small fee (I don't know how much) for the painting job is just
to cover the cost of the paint... No profit made.

you'll watch it on MTV or CNN, do you ?).

Since I was the originator of the joke... I confirm... all that

no tickets, no fence... I'm not sure it will be no MTV or CNNlike...

COME ON PEOPLE.. you should have known it was a joke... Can you
actually believe that someone would bring 500 seats on the Playa ????
Fence the man ?

It just shows that we all need to be there soon...

Good day,

Congratulations!  I was able to give it up almost 6 years ago.  It feels so good not to 
smoke.  Parties were also the hardest part of the equation for me to resolve.  I could easily
smoke a second pack, being up most of the night at a party; normally a 1 pack-a-day
person.  

>I have seen people  so messed up on E, acid or whatever that they can hardly walk.  I can't  
>even imagine one of them trying to drive a car.  

Luckily, most of them can't imagine it either and have enough raver sense not to try.  My
perceptions can get extremely skewed, but logic tends to prevail in the realm of psychs.

>You have to  pretend you *don't* care otherwise you will get hurt.

I was never much of a clubber because I could pick up on this.  It was easier for me to just
avoid the scene altogether, not being very good at being dishonest. ( I considered this a 
flaw at some point? )

YEEESSS!  I am a much more outgoing person in this scene because I feel accepted for
who I am and don't feel threatened about expressing myself. 

>But, if you know me I am sure you heard me in early morning hours say "I  wish I had a beer 
>right now."  There is no better way to end a party than  with a nice, cold beer :)

If you go to Burning Man this year, I'll have to take you up on this.  Beer is one of my favorite 
foods in the post party afterglow.  Jeff gave me a Pyramid Apricot Ale last Sunday moring,
when he wen't back onto the decks.  Time + 1 beer =  temporary energy source.  I had 
fogotten this axiom.  Two to three is good to mellow the crash, and an excuse to keep your
friends up conversing for a few more hours.  (  "Wou ja like anutha pint, mate?" )   

Take care,
                    Jason

The problem is that driving under the influence is not very well defined
when it comes to drugs, so people rely on their own gut feeling. Which
seems just as unreliable as with alcohol to me. I've seen plenty people
driving while they had taken drugs (usually quite some time after the
actual intake) and still find it hard to say if they are save drivers.
Taking the average time of action of for instance LSD and the overall
tiredness that comes into play I wouldn't say recreational drug users
make safer or more aware drivers than drinkers.

In one sentence: it's not the drugs, it's the people.
A bottle of beer will not kill anybody, a drunk driver will/could.
{One of the beautiful things of raving in Holland for instance is
that the country has a working public transportation system, you
just take a train or a bus home (you may have to wait until 7 am,
but you just sit in the park watching the birds and the grass).}
If the responsibility that people today show with drinking and
driving is an example, I wonder what traffic would become like if
LSD was freely available to anybody... ;-)

I fully agree that the policy in this country regarding drugs makes no
sense. But perhaps it's smartest to to start small, legalize marihuana first.
It will keep kids from sniffing glue to get high and is generally
pretty innocent. The harder drugs I would be more careful with, 95%
of the people is not ready for them I would say. A start would be
to stop harrassing the users.

Have they? Ever inspected your pupils the next morning? Ever seen
trails after moving objects weeks after LSD use? And they're still
very tired I would say. People believe what they like to believe,
I would be _very_ reluctant to drive after using any mind altering
substance, the risk of hurting the people you love isn't worth it
to me. And there are still people passing out on alcohol-free parties.
Several people have given me rides home after raves, being under
some sort of influence, and I trust them with my live in that sense
but one still takes a risk doing so.

I'm sorry to hear that.

Hope everyone has a great weekend even though Nation was cancelled at
pier 45...supposedly it's still gonna happen just not at pier 45? Call
their infoline 415.764.2922 for more info.

I called the Mayor's office to voice my polite concern saying that his
decision could adversely affect the support from a growing registered
young adult generation in his current and future political aspirations.
Eventhough I was not planning on going to Nation this action against
Nation affects our entire underground scene and I believe we should
voice our concern to the mayor in a polite, responsible, and informed
manner. Here's his number again:

415.554.6490

On a lighter note here's some funny translations to get your weekend
off on the right foot!

Peace and Love Always,
John
----
The name Coca-Cola in China was first rendered as Ke-kou-ke-la.
Unfortunately, the Coke company did not discover until after thousands
of signs had been printed that the phrase means "bite the wax tadpole"
or "female horse stuffed with wax" depending on the dialect. Coke then
researched 40,000 Chinese characters and found a close phonetic
equivalent, "ko-kou-ko-le," which can be loosely translated as
"happiness in the mouth."

In Taiwan, the translation of the Pepsi slogan "Come alive with the
Pepsi Generation" came out as "Pepsi will bring your ancestors back
from
the dead."

Also in Chinese, the Kentucky Fried Chicken slogan "finger- lickin'
good" came out as "eat your fingers off."

Scandinavian vacuum manufacturer Electrolux used the following in an
American ad campaign: "Nothing sucks like an Electrolux."

The American slogan for Salem cigarettes, "Salem - Feeling Free," got
translated in the Japanese market into "When smoking Salem, you feel so
refreshed that your mind seems to be free and empty."

When General Motors introduced the Chevy Nova in South America, it
apparently unaware that "no va" means "it won't go." After the company
figured out why it wasn't selling any cars, it renamed the car in its
Spanish markets as the Caribe.

Ford had a similar problem in Brazil when the Pinto flopped. The company
found out that Pinto was Brazilian slang for "tiny male genitals". Ford
pried all the nameplates off and substituted Corcel, which means horse.

When Parker Pen marketed a ballpoint pen in Mexico, its ads were
supposed to say "It won't leak in your pocket and embarrass you."
However, the company mistakenly thought the spanish word "embarazar"
meant embarrass. Instead the ads said that "It wont leak in your pocket
and make you pregnant."

An American t-shirt maker in Miami printed shirts for the spanish market
which promoted the Pope's visit.  Instead of the desired "I Saw the
Pope" in Spanish, the shirts proclaimed "I Saw the Potato."

Chicken-man Frank Perdue's slogan, "It takes a tough man to make a
tender chicken," got terribly mangled in another Spanish translation. A
photo of Perdue with one of his birds appeared on billboards all over
Mexico with a caption that explained "It takes a hard man to make a
chicken aroused."

Hunt-Wesson introduced its Big John products in French Canada as Gr Jos
before finding out that the phrase, in slang, means "big breasts." In
this case, however, the name problem did not have a noticeable effect on
sales.

Colgate introduced a toothpaste in France called Cue, the name of a
notorious porno mag.

In Italy, a campaign for Schweppes Tonic Water translated the name
into Schweppes Toilet Water.

Japan's second-largest tourist agency was mystified when it entered
English-speaking markets and began receiving requests for unusual sex
tours. Upon finding out why, the owners of Kinki Nippon Tourist
Company changed its name.

Nation:
I called the Mayor's and no comment was all the Secretary could say.
I tried to pose the inquiry from the perspective of a local buisness
person who was selling tickets to the event. This did not help.

The Voice mail sounds like they are working on alternate spaces
and no protest is planned (was there one?)

Ron D Core taught me to not give the Pre-sale ticket money to promotors
till after the event. and by the way Ron's party Blitzkrieg will be the
last tickets Ameba ever sells. Usually we accept free tickets for the
service but I don't want to be a guest list raver any more.

The underground will always stay underground...  Just because an article talks
about a few events dosen't mean the scene has become commericalized.  I've
been to parties where when someone sees an SFR laminate they say,
 "oh, boy I guess were commercal now..." (sad, but true..)
 
You just have to go "deeper" to find it @ times (Ie: CCC, SPAZ, Down to
Earth, Blessed ect...).

"dance with me..."

Dear All;

        Regarding the quitting of smoking of tobacco. I successfully quit
smoking cigs in 1982 and have never ever gone back. How did I do it, by
smoking pot when I just couldn't stand it anymore. Yes, I would roll and
light up a joint and it would take care of the craving for me, and in
addition it got me high; giving me some positive affirming feedback that I
was doing the right thing.

Peace
Brian

Does anybody know of a Seattle based "raves" group or what parties will be
going up around the 24th, 25th and 26th?  I've heard about Electrolush, but
I don't know where it is held.  Anybody have some news for me?

Thanks!!!!!

I go for my daily ritual of morning coffee on Telegraph.  (Ah, gotta love 
Noah's Bagels!!)  Telegraph is usually an assaultive experience, but at 
this hour it is calm, almost beautiful.  But outside the store a crowd 
begins to gather: three cops are arresting a child.

I know this child.  I've seen him many times on the street.  Tiny, maybe 
eleven years old, with huge baggy clothes, huge baggy Afro, and 
skateboard that he gets lost in.  Always a cigarette dangling from his 
baby mouth, stoned eyes dully taking in the mayhem that surrounds him.  
He appeared in my house one day, slyly pretending to be "looking for a 
friend."  Later we discovered several items missing: a cable box, a 
portable stereo.  A few days later the alarm came from the other co-ops 
(student housing): look out for a little black kid - he's robbing all the 
houses.  Alert the police if you see him anywhere.

I've seen him since, but I didn't call the cops.  And finally today they 
caught up with him.  The crowd is hovering on the edge of hostility, 
unsure whether rage is the appropriate response.  Three large white men 
are handcuffing and harassing a small black boy - it's quite a 
spectacle.  Pigs!  Street punk!  Which is right?  Who is to blame?

I think of all the articles I've read recently about the explosion in 
crime of young teenagers.  Fastest growing segment of youth violence - 
more violent, less repentant than older teenagers.  I read that if 
someone is 16, 17 committing crimes, there is a chance at 
rehabilitation.  They may have had some different values implanted 
somewhere.  But the most dangerous are those 11, 12, 13.  They are lost.  
They had nothing else to begin with.  The statistics for these children 
are, basically, hopeless.       

Whenever I saw this boy earlier, I always had the impulse to go up to 
him.  To grab the cigarette from his mouth and ask him what he's doing to his body??  To 
tell him that he's a worthy, valuable person, who deserves to develop his 
mind in school, and deserves a loving home.  To guide him towards 
agencies or somewhere that may offer him hope.

But did he ever have a chance at that?  And now that no-one has 
intervened in a constructive way, arrest at 11 may have sealed his fate.  
The development today of juevenile hall over school and family is like an 
irrevocable path...someone, parents, society, the police, has robbed 
this boy of his possible future.

I walked quickly past the scene, silent.

It's best to get all the facts prior to voicing a protest. What happened
and why, from BOTH sides.  It's good that you were polite, that gets you a
lot further than being arrogant.

What "decision" did the mayor make, and why?

Well, I'm still smoking and don't really care. See it as my little contribution
to the overpopulation ;-) I always find it funny that so many official people
are paranoia about smoking _here_, while nobody seems to mind _exporting_
smokes all over the world. And I can't help but chuckle when I see the
sign asking people not to smoke in front of the air-vents here at UCSF.
While they are located at street level with all the busses, cars and trucks
going by everyday, producing more nasty hydrocarbons than I ever can
in a day. Oh and on the subject of cancer, as a chemist I found it very
interesting to learn that some of the chemicals involved in some of the
synthesis routes of our beloved party snacks are carcinogens. I hope the
chemists really purify their merchandise...
And finally, I've always wondered if the nicotine is the real problem,
I've heard that is solved in about 6 days or so. I feel it's more the
social aspect, or the killing-time aspect that drives people crazy in
the end. I can do without smoking for hours when I'm real busy, but when
I'm relaxing I smoke much more.

Dear All;

        Is commercialism so bad? When Europe has 50k people at a May Day
celebration, or large rave is it commercial. We tend to envy raves like
that, yet when a promoter here in the bay does one, they are trashed, go figure.
        
        So, Ulrike(or anyone else who has lived in Europe or has spent some
time on the scene there) are events like the May Day celebration considered
commercial, and is that considered a bad thing. Please respond publicly hon,
thanks.

Peace

Your message came through.... but also reminded me yet again that
our current world view has moved away from responsibility of self
to the view point that we ( or in this case the boy) are what others
make us.... Not responsible for ourselves... R. A. Davis murderer
because of what his parents and society did....  M. brothers murderers
because of what their parents did.... small unknown boy arrested
because of parents etc... see a thread here?

same as people on wellfare because of what society did to them....

Unlike John  Bradshaw I don't buy it.... but it seems lots of others do...
I'm not saying others don't influence but utimately the choice (lady or
the tiger?) is up to the individual.... but then 20 years ago I was
lucky enough to have been influenced by a master who taught me the MOST
important gift a human has is their dynamic will power... and that will
power self directed (yes with help from others) can accomplish anything
so NEVER turn that over to others without great care. This is why
Tony Robbin's motivation seminars work for so many... lack of this 
will power is why so many stay oppressed and on wellfare... and when
we find ourselves saying:  " They" caused me to.... we have given that
will power away.... and the battle for self-worth and self-motivation is
lost... from there on we believe whatever we get comes from others -
even if we steal it....

just a comment,

Mike

I completely agree that we should get the facts before protesting.
When I called I just asked for what the reason was why Nation wasn't
being allowed to use the Pier 45 space. The secretary's response was
that the mayor has no response at this time...it's not clear whether
or not the mayor himself made the decision or not but the secretary did
say that the police department had a role in the matter. One would 
think however that the city, mayor and police, have known that this 
event was going to happen for quite sometime and thus if possible 
should have notified the Nation promoters that they were not going to
be able to use the pier in order to give Nation adequate time to make
alternate plans.

Peace,
John

Dear All;

        I strongly recommend, that people on this list that feel strongly
against Socialism, & Communism go out and date someone for a length of time
who grew up in those governmental environments, & I guarantee it will change
you and your isolated little world, as it did me. Or go there and live in
one of these countries for a length of time and know what it is to be a
Communist or Socialist.

        We American's God forbid never travel to live and experience other
places like many of our European counterparts. They have a much better
global understanding of the planet that we could ever imagine. Even in this
day and age we are still the isolated and clueless America.

Peace
Brian

Although I haven't been to MayDay myself, I have attended a few similar events
in the Netherlands. I'd say many of them are commercial, just because it takes
such a large amount of money to throw them (reflected in tickets price,
the same bunch of DJ's at every party, stands with "rave mechandise" etc.).
To say they're seen as bad depends on your perspective. If you are into
gabber/hardcore, chances are (in Holland) you prefer huge parties, the
bigger the better with state of the art lighting/sounds/visuals etc.
But then again gabber is in the hitparades back home and probably already
pretty commercial in itself. Many people (including myself) with broader
interests etc. prefer smaller raves. The music is more adventurous,
the atmosphere more intimate and friendly, and the locations more fun.
The larger events (and some clubs) attract nowadays every dimwit who
got his/her hands on pills and are now "really into the house thing",
the small scale parties are more spread by word of mouth rather than
huge flyers and more difficult to get to if you don't were to ask
(similar to here in SF I would say).
The scene is so big there, that there is something for every one, which
(unfortunately) results in quite seperated groups ravers going only to
their kind of events...

Evidently there's an electro night starting at the Top on Saturdays. This
Saturday I'll be playing along with DJ Pasta (Portland, OR). I'm afraid I
don't know much about it, but I'd expect it to be free.

HedQuarters @ the Voodoo is also well worth checking out on Saturday
nights. Nice downtempo and drum & bass on the intelligent tip.

Well I'm off back to NZ real soon so I'd just like to say 
thanks heaps to everyone that I've been lucky enough to meet 
over the last few months and I hope that everyone has a 
really choice future.  I am definately sad about leaving but 
I have learnt so much while I've been here and I will 
definately take all the plur and energy home with me to 
share with others so I guess a little bit of San Fransisco and SF 
raves will be transplanted to NZ and maybe sometime in the future you 
might meet another Kiwi who will tell you that they had heard about 
Sf raves and you'll know that the legend has survived!
Well anyway best I get back to the horrible job of packing, hope to see 
some of you at F8 tonite and the psychadelic trance party on Sat.

	Whoa, what do you think college is good for?! Teaching skills? 
There you have something quite wrong. From what I have seen, college
either pampers you (like stanford) or teaches you how to deal with
complete beuacratic shit (Berkeley). I have yet to meet someone coming out
of college that has the skills needed to do the most important things in a
job like working with other people.  College isn't aimed at giving you the
skills needed to make things better for anybody except your future CEO,
but instead breeds, or at least allows to perpetuate, some type of narrow
vision of how one is SUPPOSED to live. College has destroyed the visions
of some of the brightest people I have ever met because the delusion that
an American university was supposed to be about learning and investigating
an academic field, and not about handing homework in, competing with other
people for spots and the like, simply turned them away from participating.
	And then let's take a look at this loan thing. Take out a loan? 
On what credit basis? Who is going to give you this loan? What if you 
want to study an art and not a tech field which might someday get you a 
job which can pay back the loan... If you are in a low economic class, 
who is going to make getting a loan an easy enough process to leave one 
with enough energy to keep going through the education assembly line? No 
where is there any type of plateau for someone to take a break and build 
confidence back up; if one's confidence is ever broken, who is going to 
slacken the avalanche of shit to allow that person a quick break because 
that person from a low economic class has already busted their ass far 
harder to get to that point then little suburn daddy bought you a car to 
take to college person... Granted, each person has a different load of 
shit to deal with and each person will have their own rock bottom as 
their beliefs are twisted and stretched, but it seems that colleges are 
set up with functions that are aimed more toward a certain lifestyle of 
comfort and politeness and shallowness...
	And finally, what if you don't know what you want to do with your
life but you know you don't want to controbute to the wanton destruction
of everything around you? What if you don't want to perpetuate this chain
of go to school, get a job, have job become your life - not of your own
free will, but because your potential is so great that your manager keeps
dymping stuff on you til you end up working 60+ hour weeks. Going to
school and getting a job is NOT what many people's life is about. Why
should it be?  When going to school, getting a job and "advancing" society
means moving resources around at a rate the local ecosystems cannot adjust
to the point where all the moving we do creates a tidal wave that
eventually crashes over us.... Maybe schools should teach people to think
a little about what they are doing out there in the world in addition to
the competition and the like that they are currently so good at
amplifying... Our economic system is not divised for this many people. To 
keep it going, it has to keep coming up with more bullshit things that 
people don't need and for many, just should not have because they are 
really beginning to interfere with other people's lives with them. In the 
process of providing these things, we are moving resources far more 
quickily than anything has been forced to adapt to before including 
ourselves.

	And they are looking for certain people who can lift 80 lbs packages 
and work with dust that is known to cause cancer in constant exposure. 
Both these will limit your life span and probably give you problems over 
the rest of the course of your existence. Why should someone want to do 
that? To profit UPS? To make us, the people who bought into the fucking 
system, not have to take care of those who didn't want it anyway? Telling 
people to go get a shitty job to make their life even shittier so that I 
can go out and spend the money I am entitled to in my comfy job on drugs, 
parties, travel or the like doesn't seem quite right when they don't get 
to do the same...
	Yelling about how other people need to get off their butts does 
not help. It doesn't go anywhere. What I see from this anger is more 
resentment that the yeller cannot let go of things to go and live in then 
way he or she wants to because he or she is scared and because of that, 
he or she is pissed off. Granted, I am making assumptions but so be it. 
No one is going to be able to fix things on their own, but you can make 
an effort to help those around you and yourself.

You know, I found something very relative to this subject laying on a 
desk today(coincedence? I think not...):

"If the colleges were better, if they really had it, you would need to 
get the police at the gates to keep order in the inrushing multitude.
See in clooge how we thwart the natural love of learning by leaving
the natural method of teaching what each wishes to learn, and insisting
that you shall learn what you have no taste or capacity for. The 
college, which should be a place of delightful labor, is made odious
and unhealthy,  and the young men are tempted to frivolous amusements to 
rally their jaded spirits. I would have studies elective.
Scholarship is to be created not by compulsion, but by awakening a pure
interest in knowledge. The wise instructor accomplishes this by
opening to his pupils precisely the attractions the study has for 
himself.The marking is a system for schools, not for the college; for
boys, and not for men; and it is an ungracious work to put on a professor."

Nation has found a new site - they've yet to call back and confirm this

Oakland instead of the city.

Hi All,

I totally agree with our Frying Dutchman.
I have been to some big events in Germany, and I consider these events 
as commercial. You cannot throw such big parties without help from the
commercial side. The German techno scene became really big over the last
years and a lot of companies (from the music business, as well as from 
other areas: fashion, tabacco, drinks) saw their chance to make profit. For 
them, the techno scene is a market, and they saw the potential of this 
growing market. Youth people in general represent good, solvent consumers. 
Companies like Camel, Adidas, etc. tried to catch trends, were successful, 
and also helped to accelerate the growing of the scene.

Is it a bad thing? 

On one side, there are events you couldn't realize 
without help from the commercial side (sponsoring, advertisements, 
publicity like TV broadcasts, magazines, ...).
Like the Frying Dutchman said: the big events often have amazing light, 
sounds, visuals, dj line-ups, ... Some of the events I went were really 
awesome. 

On the other side, it also has its drawbacks. Same as here, commercial/
big events tend to have a bad vibe sometimes. Sometimes there are 
a lot of people who just come because it's a big event and everybody is 
going. They don't know what techno is about. All they think is that
people go there and do drugs, and that's all they wanna do there.
Or some big events are just rip offs: announced djs don't show up,
bad organisation, ... I was also disappointed by some of the big 
events in Germany.

I wouldn't say every big, commercial event is bad. 
You just don't know how the party gonna be. If it's a bad
party, the disappointment is bigger because of your bigger
expectations and higher costs.


In my hometown Munich, the growing scene and partial commercialization
showed some interesting effects. Here are 2 examples:

We had (I think 2 years ago) a rave combined with the so-called
'Camel awards' for best dj, best live-act, best event... in town. 
These awards were voted by readers of a techno magazine and was 
sponsored by Camel. The space was awesome. I've never seen such a light
system and visual effects again. It took place in a film studio and
only invited guests (maybe 1.000 or 2.000 ?) got tickets (I was working
there). After the winners got their awards, the rave started.
The funny thing was, when they started the party, the room became 
more and more empty. DJs and location were really awesome, but the 
'guests' rather stormed into the VIP lounge...

Another example is the 'Kulturstation' in Munich. It's a location
sponsored by the city where young people can through their parties.
The rent is quite cheap comparing to other locations. It's also the 
place were techno started in Munich. There were the first techno 
parties in town.
Over the years the parties moved to clubs and bigger locations.
But after a while, people started to throw their own small parties
again at the 'Kulturstation'. And these parties are usually pretty
good, no matter what kind of big rave is in town the same night.

Like Frying Dutchman said, a big scene has something for everyone:
All kind of music styles and all kind of events.
Some are good, and some are bad.



Thomas

PS
I'm going to see Carl Cox at Nikita tonight.
Hope to see a lot sfravers.

I just read "DJ roundtable" article in the Bay Guardian.  

I was soo impressed!  

I especially liked Graham's DIY attitude:  

"We don't need to rely on big studieos and major labels anymore to make
music."  

Right on bro.

"When punk came along it took control of the music out of the hands of the
majors and put in the hands of the people who really made the music.  And
it's happening again now. Majors look at our music and they don't
understand what we do or how to promote it, and they stay away.  So it's
quite exciting.  It really is in our hands at the moment."

Just like the parties where the music is played is in all of our hands at
the moment.  We create the space, the vibe, the setting, the social
experiment.  

I especially like the fact that Rave can't be packaged for a mass
audience.  It loses its magic, and the magic is what makes the rave.

Have an awesome weekend!

Ann

This debate is certainly dragging on a bit. I get the feeling that
after a week of debate, anyone's views which could be changed, probably
have been. having said that, i'll shut up. :)

I am curious as to whether they were at fault in this accident.  Also, if they were, did they
feel that being under the influence had any effect on the situation.  I am not condoning
any actions here.  I am just curious.  Also, if someone falls asleep at the wheel or 
is not at fault in an accident and is under the influence of marijuana, they will be prosecuted
for being so, regardless as to whether it had any bearing on the events that transpired.
Is this really fair?  From past experience, marijuana does not have nearly the impairing
affects that the legal drug alcohol does.  It does impair, just not to the same degree.  

Take care,
                    Jason

Falling asleep at the wheel while smoking marijuana!  No way!

I for one can be made quite sleepy by this particular stimulant.  As far
as fair goes, should a person who drives a car knowing they're very tired
be `let off the hook' because they fell asleep and couldn't help it?
In other words, perhaps falling asleep should be considered more neglegant
rather than being under the incluence being considered less so.

I have fallen asleep at the wheel when I knew I shouldn't drive and can
only be grateful I did no damage to anyone or anything (except my car!)

A car is a dangerous weapon which most people aren't trained well enough
to handle.

As far as making generalizations about drugs in relation to EVERYBODY ...
keep in mind that all substances (drugs or not, legal or not) have
different effects on different people and different effects on the same
person under different circumstances.  Legalize it all, educate the
people and let us kill ourselves if we want to but provide thorough public
transportation to avoid our killing others on the way.

Driving under the influence of ANYTHING that impairs your judgement is 
asking for trouble.  Even if this accident was not the fault of the 
people who were stoned initially, they might have been able to react 
faster and avoid such serious damage if they hadn't been stoned.

To think that just smoking up means you're okay to drive is a deadly 
assumption.  don't make it.

Many thanks to all of you who have responded.

I'm starting to feel better about the living situation, and am
starting to look at it from the positives. Never do I have to hunt for
a parking space when I get home, or risk having my bumpers bumped by
some yahoo. I don't have to put up with noise from the neighbors, nor
do I have to be so conscienteous about my noise (except for my
housemates). Rockridge and Montclair aren't such bad places to hang
out at when I don't feel like travelling all the way into the
city. And when I do, the city's only 1/2 an hour away.

Besides, now the the Central Freeway is about to be torn down, the
traffic situation on the East Bay will be much better.

Just got back from the Greek in Berkeley. DCD put on an incredible
vibe in the open air of the night. 

The scene was quite perfect: sunset glowing above the horizon before
fading into dusk, the twinkle of headlights on the bridge, a warm and
friendly crowd, an awesome mix of acoustics...and not to mention an
intense performance by Lisa and Brendon, backed by many
percussionists. What a scene! The light show consisted of a perfect
blend of white, yellow, orange, cyan, blue, green, and violet,
reflecting off the big columns, and onto the stage.

It was an incredible way to kick off the weekend. I'm really 
looking forward to Nation tomorrow, wherever it will be!

For those of you attending Hunny: I'm sending a mellow, happy, thread 
of turquoise energy towards your way. Hope you felt it!

It was a one-car accident. Excessive speed through an S-turn on a
windy 2-lane country road. Most certainly the driver was at fault.

As far as I'm concerned, anyone who cannot control the wheel for any
reason -- DUI, excessive tiredness, recklessness, or just plain
incompetence -- is responsible for their actions. I think it is fair
enough to subject them to the appropriate consequences, regardless
of whether they hurt anyone else or not. I want to personally feel
safe driving on the highways and streets, and not have to fear being
hit, and possibly killed, by someone operating their vehicle in an
irresponsible manner.

Every drug (including prescription ones) has a certain
responsibility the user must accept when taking it. I do not care
what substance a person chooses to imbibe, so long as it doesn't put
any danger on myself, my friends, or others.

As the ads would suggest, "Be high responsibly."

I recently got back from an almost 2 month vacation in indonesia.  In case you were 
wondering, there is a bit of a techno scene.	
In summatra they call the techno music disco and there isn't too many places to 
experiece the music.  There's much more of a dance scene in Bali, especially Kuta beach. 
 If anyone is planning on going there let me know if you would like more details.

Now that I'm back, I'm looking foward to sharing the energy with you all on the dance 
floor.

Yes, but the differ4ence is that in Europe when there is 50k at a rave it
is a free party; here there charging $20 a pop; and that's the difference.

Is it just me or does DCD sound like a poor impression of 1980's
style Caberet Voltaire?  To me there last album sound TOO similer to "Long
Arm of the Lord" which was a Cab album from 1985.  Probably me just
tripping.

Yes it is fair. Just because one is not at fault in an accident does not 
alter the fact that they were driving under the influence, which is a 
really STUPID(and yes I am being very judgemental) thing to do. It is 
also something I see far too many people do. If you want to risk your own 
life, fine. But don't risk mine or my loved ones, or anyone elses for 
that matter, because someone can't be bothered to behave responsibly and wait 
before wrapping themselves in a few thousand pounds of metal and heading down 
the road.

As far as your past experiences, they are entirely subjective, and I am 
sure their are unbiased studies that have been done that refute your 
"feelings." Hell, I would go dig them up if you like, but I doubt that would 
make a difference, right?

It was really a very nice show. It was also nice to see performers that 
were so appreciative of their audience. What a pleasant suprise ;-)

Dead Can Dance blew me away, it was so beautiful, like the biggest chill
room in the world, the Greek is a perfect place for music, and their music
is so pure and beautiful ... really timeless, like going to church and
hearing the angels sing for you.

Sorry, that's not true. Most of the big events in Germany are quite 
expensive. I think Mayday was about $40 the last times and other
big events are at least $20.
However, some events are free like the techno parades in the big
cities (Love Parade, ...).

After reading the article on the dj's, I'm not sure if the extended 
exposure will help or hurt the scene.  Maybe people who decide to go out 
as a result of reading the article will now go mainly for the music 
rather than the "club scene".
An increased interest in the music will help the vibe imo.

Well, at one point, I thought Brendon sounded a lot like Echo and the 
Bunnymen. Jamie told me that her sister thought Brendon Perry is the 
reincarnation of Jim Morrison. Well, a mellower one, perhaps...

I only heard their new CD once, and I never heard that particular
Cabaret Voltaire release before. I'll check it out...

Does anyone know anything about this? It's another Gateway party,
and it's next Sat (17th). It wasn't on the SFR calendar, and the info
number still had the old Chrysalis message, so I didn't know
if it was still happening or not.

The flyer is just too adorable for me to miss this one :)

Really?  My 19951040ez tax booklet totaly disproves this(on the fed level).
First, on page 8, it states that you must file if single and your income was
__$6,400__ or more.  BIG $3,600 difference there.  Then, the tax table on
page 29 states that a full time min. wage income is taxed $1226, about 15%.
(full-time employment is 40 hours a week, this = 1920hrs/year. @ 4.25/hr,
that = $8160/year)   This makes the actual wage about $3.61 an hour (85% of
4.25) 3.61 X 40= $144/week, or $579/month after taxes.  Rent = -+$350/month,
food, at 6.00$ a day ( $2 average per meal... a megar sustainance) 180= $ a
month.  Bills (pg+e, water, phone, etc.)=  + - 40$ a month.  The balance is
___9$___ .  Oh yah, there are state income taxes, too, so that is gone
anyway...How will you get to work?  What will you do if you need
medical/dental help?  How will you get new clothes(they wear out)?  How will
you wash your clothes? How will you buy toothpaste and deoderant?  How will
you ever do anything for fun except go to the park near your house on your 2
days off a week?  I call this barely existing, not living.  

Something's still got to give...

	Have you ever seen a tax table?  They don't charge "average taxes" for 
someone making minimum wage.  In fact, you have to make about $10,000 to even

need to file.

I know that the state taxes pay for most school stuff.  But you make it sound
like they pay nothing, when they do.  The role of education in society is too
important to let it go underfunded, by the states or by the fed.  We need to
change this; one way I can see is to make the fed more responsible for
education by making them give education more money. But everyone says "That
sounds nice, but where will the money come from", and I say cut "defense" by
a few % and give it to schools.  More money=more priority

What states/feds spend on schools is less than what the states/feds spend on
defense?  How can this be? The fed income tax is about __354%__ higher than
state income tax (figured from 1995 fed and state tax booklets).

I do not belive we build our war machines to defend ourselves anymore.  We
are now the world police force.  We use all those resources to PUT DOWN any
other country we believe is not in our best interest.  It is no longer
national defense.  It is now INTERNATIONAL OFFENSE.  If you can not see this,
we need to do some serious discussion here.  I am not free because the CIA
uses the military to prevent a socialist system from developing in a Central
American country.  We protect our intrests, which is a far cry from protcting
our citizens.  Why?  Because our decision making system in this country is
extremely subject to vested intrest.  This is because you must have money to
lobby for a law.  Who has money?  CORPORATIONS.  Who wants an exploitable
capitalist system in 3rd world countries? CORPORATIONS.  We police the world
to prevent communism so we can exploit cheap labor/materials without US laws
protecting people and the environment.  Why?  Because they can save money
that way, and get richer.  By they, here, I mean the board of directors of
any corporation.  It is a swindle, my friend.  You don't want to be swindled,
do you? They use much of those $ to spy on YOU.  And that has been true since
the early 50's when they have had satelites that could read newspaper
headlines from orbit (from an ex- air farce recon specialist I spoke to last
weekend- he SAW the satelite pictures then)...think of where technology is
now!! Some military is needed, I can even see that.  But it is way out of
perportion to the threats and the TYPE of threats that are real today.

We did. A group of art students had a meeting and we demanded a drop in the
sallaries of the execs in the school system to pay for books and art
supplies.  Guess where that got us...

It is an issue, because the feds do spend $ on schools...just not enough.

Agreed.  I know of people myself with dual stateship collecting in both...NOT
friends, just know 'em.  We need reform.  We can all see that.  Just how to
do it...

Unfortunately about 3 years ago I fell asleep on the way home from a Wacky
Citrus.  That's what I get huh?  Anyway I was about 2 exits away from my
house and I fell asleep going about 80 and careened into a bus.  If that
bus had not been there I would have gone off a cliff and plunged to my
death(along with two of my friends).  That was a serious wake up call. I
stopped partying for almost a year.  I learned one thing that day.  I have
control over my own life.  I can decide before it is too late that I will
not get behind the wheel of a car if I'm not feeling like a am capable of
it.  Please people, you must be careful.  I wasn't even on drugs.  I hadn't
taken them and that was why I fell asleep.  My trick now is to smoke a
doobie, roll down the window, and listen to extremely loud country music.
Works every time.

I agree!  You should be spanked soundly for even trying to drive
intoxicated...oh wait.  You might like that :)!  The problem is that
chemicals often effect your _ability_to_know_ if you are ok to drive or not.
 You think you can do it cuz you're high, but your body is not up to dealing
with emergencies quickly enough.  It's even true when you're sober much of
the time, that by the time those breaklights come on in front of you, it is
too late for your body's reaction time to do a thing about it!  This is why
tailgaiting is so stupid.  By the laws of physics, you simply will not be
able to stop in time when you are that close.  Please don't endanger yourself
or others if you don't have to.  Be responsible for yourself by planning to
not have to drive.  If the situation comes about where you want to/must drive
when you planned not to (part gets broken up, you now want to leave beacuse
your ex showed up, etc.) you must continue that responsibility and stick it
out.  Drive to a close safe parking are and chill for a few hours...or better
yet, always have a sober person in your troop.  Then you can get as fucked up
as you please and still get somewhere in safety.  Plus, they can talk to cops
and stuff...
Oh, and I don't mean to rag on you, it's just that I don't like to be silent
on important issues.  (: (: (: (:Keep your negative's in check!:) :) :) :) :)

In a message dated 96-08-08 06:55:12 EDT, you write:

<< if the *sheer fact* that a country is starting to develop a certain power 
 is enough reason to assume this country was about to invade the 
 united states, what about the contrary. must not all the damn countries in
the 
 world then be totally convinced the us was about to invade them?
 what makes you believe the us doesn't carry those thougts (permit the 
 simplified assumption that a *state* as such could have thougts), but 
 china for instance does? >>

Or, what even makes us think our government is NOT currently invading those
other countries?   Lets not be naive here.  We (The USA) have our clandestine
fingers in the whole world's pie, folx.  Our CIA has effectively brought war
to quite a few if not all Third World countries in "secret wars" that we the
public do not hear about. They use the military, and if you talk to
disgruntled military personel, you will hear about how many GI's we actually
loose each month, how much fighting on a large scale that actually occurs
with US troops in uniform.  This doesn't even take in to account gurilla
movements we fund while simultaneously condemnig them, puppet governments we
put in to place with "coups" WE staged/instigated, or assasinations WE
perpotrate in the name of DEMOCRACY.  Our government LIES to us, and you
better not forget it or we are all in DEEP trouble.

Peace, but not if they oppress us,

Friends, as you know Roger Kumar's summer of pleasure has come to an end, 
and it is back to the frozen tundra of Missouri for him.  While he was 
here he certainly added to our scene with his generous posting on the Web 
of his many party pictures.  I just wanted to say a hearty thank-you!

Just yesterday he and I discovered that we are next-door neighbors!!  All 
summer and didn't even know it...the rave world is small and our virtual 
community is but a village, but sometimes someone is, literally, right 
next door and we still may not know!  How closely we all orbit each 
other, sometimes meeting by chance and then discovering the person was 
practically right next to you the whole time....

Tripping,
N.

the party is hapening, these guys are doing the best they can to make 
the best of the situation with their new location.  they will be 
running a map-poit and the party will be in the city.  it will be 
interesting to see how good they can make the party work out with only 
a one day leadtime on the location.  well if anyone can do it , its 
probably them.  They realy need your support, so plese go out to this 
party, it promises to be a realy good event.  Even though the location 
is kindof dirty and grungy and somewhat smells like fish... it is on 
the water, and they will have a ll the dj's, and there are real cool 
ships to check out, so i think it will be a good party.
hope to see you all there.
p.s. coming up on labor day weekend is Megga-Buzz On E.  This will be 
probably the best all around party for your hard earned dollar.  the 
best thig is that the advance tix are only 18 dollars and the party is 
a benefit.  i can't wait.
peace.

"Trainspotting" was awesome.  Imagine an American film dealing honestly 
and humorously with drug use and youth culture?  No, what we get from our 
mainstream studios is mainstream, homogenized crap...but that is a 
different thread.

Marginally rave-related:
Super-cool was the inspired use of techno as a soundtrack!!  The 
throbbing beats of the club scene (with familiar faces high on e and the 
intoxicating music), the plaintive tones of Underworld, jarring techno at 
the end...Here is a film that presents the emotional range of techno, 
that actually _respects_ the music.  The ONLY time I have heard it in 
American films, tv, etc. is as a joke, the stock portrayal of clanging 
noise with no redemptive musical worth...

Must be because the film's European, where techno is actually mainstream and 
popular.  But any other music for this subject would have been glaringly 
discordant...new, exciting sounds to accompany the trip to the edge, the 
life of young heroin addicts in Scotland.  Like the character says, 
"everything is changing...music is changing..."

But mainstream American entertainment will not acknowledge that.  Even 
major recording studios still think electronic music is a fad that will 
blow over, rather than seeing it as the beginnings of future music... Our 
big-budget studios, our mainstream culture, is decrepid, plodding along 
mired in the past and what will safely sell to the under-stimulated 
masses....

Well,

It turns out that the hacker war against me has excelated to a whole new
level,  and I'm asking for any UNIX guru's out there to please help me.

I didn't even know it was possible,  but these hackers have "subscribed"
me to over 4000 mailing lists,  thus completly cutting off all incoming
mail to me.    This afternoon,  I had over 4000 messages,  ALL of which
were to "Majordomo's" subscribing me.    As far as I know,  it's still
going on,   so for the time being,   I've switched over to a new account
on another system.   But I have a feeling that soon THIS account will
be spammed as well.

I find this outright harrassment,  and want to know if I have any
legal recourse.

For instance,  if an email request comes into a Majordomo account,  is
there a way to identify the source?

Anyway,   I could use some help from any UNIX hacker to help me out...

Crunchman

Hi all!!

 Wow. Yet another incredible party last night. Hunny was yummy! ;)

But right now I need a Trance party and the one for tonight (by CCC and 
friends) has their message line down (GASP!!). Can anyone help me out on 
this please? Where is it? What time? I really would like to go!!!!!!  =)

Also; is anyone in or around Santa Cruz going?

Also; I've misplaced all my phone #s so I can't call anyone unless they 
give me their #. Mine is (408)427-1666.

Peace all,


Ran

systems out of commission for a bit, even if power is returning around the
bay...anyone have any information to share about, say, the Hunab Ku party?
Or anything else.

Dear All;

        I know three people (New Yorker & 2 German Nationals) visiting SF
who are staying near the Pine Street Area of SF who need a ride. Please
contact 415-928-3596. If you could help them out they would be able to help
out with gas, + other wonderful things.

Peace
Brian

Hi all!

 I'm going to try to make this one!! =) I'm coming out from Santa Cruz. 
Anyone else with room for a paying rider? I may have a ride but that is 
not certain right now (will know by 9:30 - 10:00 pm)). If I do have a 
ride and someone needs one, write me here or call (408)427-1666.


Heart energy to all,


Ran

.......I agree!  You should be spanked soundly for even trying to drive
intoxicated...oh wait.  You might like that :)!  The problem is that
chemicals often effect your _ability_to_know_ if you are ok to drive or not.
 You think you can do it cuz you're high, but your body is not up to dealing
with emergencies quickly enough.  It's even true when you're sober much of
the time, that by the time those breaklights come on in front of you, it is
too late for your body's reaction time to do a thing about it!  This is why
tailgaiting is so stupid.  By the laws of physics, you simply will not be
able to stop in time when you are that close.  Please don't endanger yourself
or others if you don't have to.  Be responsible for yourself by planning to
not have to drive.  If the situation comes about where you want to/must drive
when you planned not to (part gets broken up, you now want to leave beacuse
your ex showed up, etc.) you must continue that responsibility and stick it
out.  Drive to a close safe parking are and chill for a few hours...or better
yet, always have a sober person in your troop.  Then you can get as fucked up
as you please and still get somewhere in safety.  Plus, they can talk to cops
and stuff...
Oh, and I don't mean to rag on you, it's just that I don't like to be silent
on important issues.  (: (: (: (:Keep your negative's in check!:) :) :) :) :)

always wondered if it would work to simply change your return address and
sub someone to a list. I don't think it takes a hacker to figure that out,
prolly some mischevious jerk with a wicked sense of humor...

So lets get this straight: You ran into a bus after falling asleep, while 
sober. And now, your solution to this is to ingest a CNS depressant before 
driving? Yup sounds like real sound reasoning to me. Please, anyone out 
there, please let me know if you see Nancy anywhere near a party that I 
am attending, so I can leave before she gets on the road.

As we were driving back from eats, we heard this on the radio:

The rave party that was supposed to happen at Pier 70 (nation's new 
space?) has been cancelled. 

I am not sure if there was another party going on there tonight or if 
that was where Nation was moved.  I guess I would just keep calling the 
vm #, though, especially if you have tickets and still want to see some 
amazing djs.  Hopefully, those Spundae people have a couple more tricks 
up their sleeve or they are going to be out of a bunch of money.

Cheers***

Hi!

 Still looking for a ride to the Trance party near Half-Moon Bay. I'm in 
Santa Cruz. Anarch, are you out there? Calls can go to (408)427-1666, but 
email may be best.

Thanks,


Ran

...I was already gonna post this but I figured now would even be a more 
appropriate time with all this rave shutting down...

		...we should have the right to rave
		...we only want to spread SM:)ES and happiness, and dance

(off of flyer I was handed @ HUNNY)

	Why are you at this event? The rave scene is not just about techno.  
	This scene is not just about drugs this scene is no just about fashion.
	It is something special about unity and happiness.

	It is about being yourself and being loved for it.  
	It should be a harbor from our society.

	BUT our scene right now is disintegrating!!!!!!!
	Old style ravers -- remeber when everybody HUGGED all the time 
	-- not just to say hello and goodbyes?
	Remember when people just said hi to be your FRIEND?
	Remembver how good that felt?
	Why don't we do it anymore?
	New comers -- you are wanted and you should know that this scene 
	is about openess.
	
	We all share a bond -- the desire to groove to a good beat ALL 
	night long -- and no one is an island.
	Everyone needs friends and the OUTSIDE WORLD is tough enough.
	We don't need fronts and attitudes in our scene.
	Open your hearts and let the good feelings flow =)
	Look around you, pick a person, ask them their name, and make a FRIEND,
	eliminate boundaries.
	
	OPEN your hearts and minds, RAVERS UNITE and keep our scene alive!!!

Nation has been busted and I have heard that they will be doing a party 
at 1015 to make up for it Sunday. All who bought tickets from Ameba can 
get refunds...(I know the ticket #s so please don't ask for a refund 
with tickets from elsewhere). WE will be closed sunday till 5 so that I
 may witness LTJ Bukem in front of City Hall. I will be open from 5-7pm 
for Sunday evening refunds.

PS thanks Ron D Core for good advice

Good day,

That's because we, the participants, are such an important part of the equation .  And you
can't very well sell the participants to the other consumers.  Damn, I knew it was flawed :)  :)

in a small but tight through-alley club called Simons...years ago for me 
before the place blew up into "the scene." 

 On the Nation hotline, a very upset/shocked spokesperson says riot-geared 
officers showed at the new location. Im not sure whether to be offended or 
flattered or entertained at the riot fear. It took me all of a second to 
get over that shit and move on to tomorrow night 1015 
Folsom--Nation...folks ,i dont care if its a club, warehouse, outhouse, in

it is ALL green eggs and ham.

 To the Nation people, I say Bless you for your effort in what must seem 
like a cursed mission.
 To the police policy makers, thanks for the workout...a strong wind makes

Subject: why did Nation get busted?
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

I was listening with frustration to tonight's reports that Nation had been
shut down (before it even started) by the SFPD, complete with riot gear and
barricades down at 18th & Illinois, also known as Pier 70.  This was the
second SF location that the Sundae crew tried to have this party at, after
being stonewalled out of their legit Pier 45 location earlier this week. This
certainly seems like overkill by our local government, given the most
always-peaceful nature of raves and ravers. It's a shame to see San Francisco
join the ranks of other cities (London and Los Angeles, to name a few) that
make a show of shutting down raves, rather than observing things on a
case-by-case basis, and only responding to complains from neighbors or unsafe
situations.

The folks in charge of Nation also promote Nikita and Spundae,at 1015 Folsom
and Club DV8 respectively, which means that the bulk of their experience is
with throwing parties in legitimate clubs where promoting both the specific
event and the location is not an issue. In the big club scene, that makes
lots of sense--everyone gets to see how exciting the location is, and plan to
meet their friends there, etc.  In the rave scene, announcing the location
for a party ahead of time gives the neighbors plenty of time to complain to
the police and the mayor, who then, to please the taxpayers, have a big stake
in seeing the party not happen.  This can lead to the "barricades and riot
gear" situation we saw tonight, where the police are not just busting a
party; they're making a statement over busting the party, to show the
neighborhood that they're responding actively to everyone's complaints.

That started me thinking about all of the very small undergrounds that I've
been to in San Francisco, and how, for the most part, these go off without
difficultly, even if/when the police do visit. As a case in point, I was at a
small underground last weekend, and the cops visited this party in the wee
hours, noted that "everything seems well under control", and left without
further difficulty.

The small undergrounds seem like mostly groups of friends who want to play
records for their friends. That's different from trying to re-create the
"superclub" atmosphere at an underground.  Underground parties are all about
"vibe", and superclubs are mostly about the venues and their world-famous
DJs. If you think of the rave scene as a little microcosm, it's interesting
to see the way in which the scene is self-regulating, even when the police
count as part of the microcosm. 

I'm feel bad that Nation didn't get to happen tonight; I imagine that they
lost a lot of money, and there will be a lot of disappointed folks
(especially under 18 and out of town) that miss Sasha and the rest of the
crew.  Kudos go to the folks at Nation for arranging a makeup party on
Sunday, and offering to refund tickets not used--they're really acting
responsibly in the face of adversity and police harrassment.

Sign me...
    ...a thoughtful sfraver

As I'm writing this message, I realize how much I appreciate having my
computer and other gadgets back after a most powerless day...
certainly I was powerless in both senses of the word. I also had a
chance to reflect upon how unprepared I am for a major earthquake, as
I stood in an endless line at Safeway, clutching my D batteries and
canned vegetables.

But I'm glad it happened today and not yesterday, because I would
not have been able to experience Hunny :) :) Dutch spun a wonderful
set; I think I danced the hardest at that point. I had never heard
DJ Dan before, and he played some rilly tripped-out crazy stuff;
fully enjoyed it; I'll look for him again. Unfortunately, I wasn't
able to pay too much attention to the other sets because I was tired
from a long day's work :(

The voicemail sort of was apologetic about the space (Jerrold Ave
Deli); I didn't think it was that bad except for the super-slippery
dance floor...

There was a very special feeling there last night; of course, I can't
describe it, but I'm sure you know what I'm talking about :) I stayed
until the end; enjoyed all of the group hugs, meeting random people,
and the total vibe. I was exhausted, but I couldn't bear to leave. The
party ended with everyone joining hands and dancing in a circle.

It was a beautiful night; I drove home with a stupid grin on my face
as I pondered how odd it is that we move our bodies to sound...

Steve

Good day,

Actually this was someone else's story that I was curious about.  I don't condone
cruising while high.  But I think the laws as current, could unfairly punish someone
who had, in the recent past (last night for instance), smoked and been involved in an accident
that no fault of his own.  Does this person really deserve this kind of aggrevation considering
the hypothetical circumstance?  It would be the same as having zero tolerance for alcohol; 
also stupid if you are responsible, count drinks and bide your time.

Take care,
                    Jason

In school and working two jobs, I awoke to find that all of cars that had been around me at a 
stop light were gone.  I quit the other job proptly.
 
>A car is a dangerous weapon which most people aren't trained well enough to handle.

Tell me about it.  How many people take defensive driving classes?  Or learn to handle
a vehicle at and beyond its limits in a safe environment.  Read books that discuss 
sujects such as trail braking, weight transfer, vehicle's equipment and it's designed limits.
I think people should understand these techniques and practice them before they are
ever handed a liscense.

Take care,

Good day,

I was trying to make the point that people who may use marijuana and drive at some later
point are not given the same chance to prove sobriety.  There is no easy way way to test
someone's level of exposure or time there of.  I have done some biased tests contrasting
marijuana, alcohol, and sleep deprivation related to reaction times, using a device
that was designed to improve drag racer's reaction times.  Alcohol, even at levels considered
legal, slowed rt's at almost double the rate of marijuana.  After 4 beers in one hour, I had to 
stop. It had become ridiculous, having trouble hitting the small button while making an 
attempt to react fast.  Marijuana faired better, but I would consider quite dangerous soon
after exposure.  I say soon, because, it depended on the level of exposure and time spent
chillin' .  Somewhere between 45-75 minutes after last exposure, rt's had returned to a
level that would be considered normal (95%).  This simply was not the case 1 hour after 
consuming 4 beers, or even 2 hours for that matter.  Sleep deprivation suprisingly had the best 
reaction times, though carries the possibility of missing whole events due to lack of 
awareness.  Judgement is subjective.  Though an attempt to test motor, reaction, and
reaction based judgement was done using a combination of video games (driving based) and a 
law enforcement hogan's alley (no real guns for this one folks!  paint guns).  The object with
the particular video game was not to be hit by or in turn hit any other vehicles (speed was
to be as constant as possible) and stay in between the lines.  Alcohol bombed.  Marijuana
ran into nothing but was occasionally hit by another car.  Sleep deprivation narrowly
avoided several accidents but regularly veered into another lane.  Alcohol killed several
innocents, missed many targets and cause fatal delays in reaction times.  Marijuana 
also caused fatal delays, but only one innocent was shot in all of the testing, target aquisition
was suprisingly good.  Sleep deprivation killed one innocent, caused fatal delays close to
sober, but was the only source of a target not noticed.  It popped up with another from a different 
angle and was not noticed until after several others had come up.  These WERE not 
100% flaw free tests; done by three high school students with a project due and alot of
time on their hands.  Two of the three participants scored their highest hogan's alley
scores after a good lunch, about 1.5 hours after smokin' a standard joint. (white paper, brown bud)

BTW:  We didn't have the balls to turn in the test stats for pot.  This was a HS science class 
after all.  The project recieved a B+ grade on its comparison of sobriety, alcohol, and sleep
deprivation.

Make what you will of this.  I will stand by some of the generalizations that can be made using 
this info.  Driving while high is always sketchy.  Driving while nodding, can be worse in 
some cases, as you might not be awake to even attempt a reaction.  

Be careful and responsible ravers so I can see your smiling faces time and time again.

Take care, 
                   Jason

Again, thank you for clarifying your statement. This begs the question, 
"Are there any tests out there to determine if someone is under the 
influence of pot, rather than having injested it up to a few days ago?" I 
believe I remember something about a saliva test, but am not sure.

Okay, here's the scoop.....
It's all conected to the Canibis Buyers club raid and that is connected to
the fact that we are having an election this year.  The DA of California
(I can't remember his name) is a right-wing arsehole and he wants to be
Wilsons (yes, I did say Willson) Running mate in 2000.  The best place to
make his presence felt is
at the Republican convention which is now going on in San Diego.  Now, as
we all know, Republicans like there people to be seen to be tough on crime
in the same way a pervert likes to watch porn: it turns them on.  And, as
far as every Republican is concerned, San Francisco represents everything
that they say is wrong with the US as a whole so if they are seen to be
tough on crime here they can say that they are winning it on a national level.
Hence raiding the Canibus club (because, as far as
they are concerned, those pesky AIDS people deserve everything coming to
them anyway) and stopping and making the SFPD raid Nation because Nation
was a major come together type party in a very prominent part of town in
what is the biggest single
underground movement in San Francisco (ie. rave culture)(because, as far
as they are concerned, Drug taking party goers are only one step above
project living gang bangers).  Which puts our Mayor and DA in a very
awkward position legally because you know if it was left up to my man
Mayor Willy Brown he'd just say no.  But his hands are tied because he has
to answer to the (supposidly) higher power of the Stae or he would loose
his job. But our DA has already said that he won't be prosucuting anyone
from the Cannibus Buyers club raid and you can bet your life that he won't
be prosecuting anyone for the Nation raid either.  I'm afraid that until
the election is over we are going to see a lot of this sort of thing going
on.  At least we can be thankful in the small mercy that we have such a
cool DA; they must be having kittens in Republican party headquarters down
south.  Just my $0.02!

Good afternoon!!!!!

Well, it's Sunday, and there's nothing better than a day with absolutely no
responsibilities to take care but dancing in the sun....

Today's free party in Civic Center should be really cool, especially since
there'll be some jungle.  I've only been to a couple of parties where people
were spinning jungle, so this should be a treat for us.

Then off to Sunset party to watch the sun go down...

Hope to see many of your smiling, happy faces out there.....


:-)  Karen

P.S.  Anyone checking out the meteor showers tonight after midnight?

Last night I went to see EAR at the Kilowatt.  There were two people on 
stage amidst some strange electronic equipment and lots of wires.  A 
throbbing, droning noise commenced.  It was funny to see a nightclub 
crowd almost all standing there with their eyes shut.  I sat down, shut 
my eyes and went into a trance.  Highly recommended despite the lack of 
beanbags.  EAR is playing again tonight at the Kilowatt(21+) across from 
the Roxie at 16th and Valencia.

I know this comes a few days late but I wanted to say thank you to everyone
involved in the frequency-8 party on friday. after meeting matt lanier for
the first time (hi matt!!) and getting one of his famous hugs, I found out
that many other sfravers were at hunny. thanks also to terry for the laminate
which is actually what caused matt to say hello. a great time was had by (most)
everyone there, there was a special feeling in the room that night! I also met
nick, and found out we are both leaving soon for MIT where we will be starting
school come september. is it only conincidence that we met? wish us well, and
we'll keep you posted as to what they're up to on the other coast! love to all:

This could very well spell the end of massives in the city of San
Francisco. Nation's apprupt cancellation at the hands of the city's
finest will drive the scene way underground. The spirit of
cooperation has ended. Who will be next? Martin getting booted out
of Home Base?

Anyway, after repeated attempts to find a vibe in the city, I
eventually headed home, sat out on the terrace, and listened to the
insects enjoying their own rave. Occasionally, they would synchronize
their chirps, and then break up into their own riffs.

  Unfortunately, you probaly can't do a thing about it.  Majordomo mailing
list managers allow third party subscriptions without verification (i.e.
anyone can subscribe anyone else), and there is no legal policy against
that.  It's poorly designed software, and everyone knows it.

  Since it is 99% certain they would be using a hacked account or an
anonymous remailer, no.  Unfortunately.

  I do hope that the situation improves in short order.  Meantime, perhaps
you could build a mail filter of some sort to handle the problem.
Something that scanned for messages from <majordomo@*> containing the text
"successfully subscribed" (or whatever it is) and trashing that message to
/dev/null, as well as sending a reply back saying "unsubscribe
[myaddress]". This would not eliminate the problem entirely, because it
usually takes a few minutes to unsubscribe you, during which time you
still get messages from the list.  But then, even if they have automated
the subscribing process, you will at least be continually unsubbed
automatically.

  Good luck.

Funny you should say that, track #2 on Spiritchaser has a spoken intro that
totally reminded me of Jim Morrison & his poetry reading.  Then on track #3,
is anybody reminded at all of that song from Sgt. Pepper's Lonely heart club
band, the George Harrison tune with the zitar thingie, think it's called
something like We Were Talking?  Listen to it, you can almost sing the words
along with it!  But other than that I still totally love the cd.

Love,
Shawna

But again, it does bring up the issue that, even tho it may not have been
the stoned person's fault, could the accident have been prevented if the
person were not impaired?  Defensive driving really does include knowing how
to best handle it when somebody else on the road is being a moron, cuz
really the primary issue should not be "who's fault was the accident" but
"how do you prevent an accident to begin with".  Cuz if there's an accident
which is one person's fault but could have been entirely prevented if the
other person hadn't been impaired, to me both people are really at fault in
that situation.

Hi all!

 According to a person I talked to at the GOA Beach party this weekend 
(who claimed to be part of the Nation work team) there was a disgruntled 
local promoter who called the mayors office and claimed there would be 
gangs and lots of violence surronding the Nation party.

 Yet more fuel for the rumor mill.

 My sympathies to the entire Nation production team for the loss and 
heartache they experienced this weekend. Thank you Nation for your heroic 
attempts!!

Just to add fuel to the fire, I have heard similar rumors, with a certain 
space owner threatening to take such actions if parties weren't held in 
his venue. Interesting....

Saturday night is here.  It's 11:00.  The promising Goa Trance party 
turns out to be 23 miles south of Half Moon Bay - an immense distance to 
someone who can rarely be motivated to even get on the Bay Bridge. 
_Nation_ is emitting bizarre vibes, and besides, I promised myself I wouldn't go 
unless I got a pre-sale.  (Luckily for me, I did not!).
 
So, where does one go on a Saturday night if one wants to dance?  One 
stupidly listens to one's non-raver friends and goes to the place that 
they praise: Nickie's on Haight.  Ah, the bar scene.  Does it ever 
change?  Does it ever get any cooler?  Or is it just what it is, accept 
it or leave?  70's funk/disco night (how old is THAT?!).  Packed.  
Pick-up energy rampant.  I clutch my boyfriend for protection.  We pound 
beers in the desperate race to find fun.  We scream along with the 
others, "ring my belllllll! ring my bell!"  Amazingly, the room is 
getting even more crowded.  We are intimately squished with 100 drunk 
strangers.  We go outside for some air.

Some pulsing beats come wafting through the air, and we follow them down 
Haight to their source.  A few doors down from Nickie's, there's Joe Rice 
spinning at the Top!  We gleefully enter (for FREE!).  He is spinning a 
beautiful set - on the mellow tip, but with the underlying beats that can take you 
away.  The Top is a haven after the crush of Nick's.  Not too many 
people, places to sit, mellow vibe, bobbing heads to the groove.  But no 
dancing.  The Top has no dance floor!!  Joe tells me it was a pool table 
or room for dancing...(swoosh! go the balls into pockets, the pool cues 
glow a trippy red under the colored lights).

2AM too soon - we are still frustrated in our attempt to dance tonight.  
After-hours clubs, after-hours clubs - fuck, I've been raving too long!  
I don't know any!  We head down to Club Universe (pounding house for the 
gay crowd).  But we stupidly go to the back of the building, and enter 
(unbeknownest to us) an entirely different club.  House sounds good, and 
we delve into a crowd of several hundred beautiful, dark-haired men (I am 
the _only_ woman in the room - it would be a dream come true if only any 
of these gods were interested, but alas...).  We are happy, but suddenly 
the music changes.  "Hola, Mi Familia!" the dj booms, and we realize we 
are at _Futura_, a bi-monthly for gay Latin men.  Salsa and slow 
Mexican-flava softhouse drags the tempo down loooowww, _for the rest of 
the night_ :(,  and we slowly sway with the rest of the crowd. 

So at 4 we surrendered to the inevitableness of the night: no hardass 
crazy dancin for us this night.  But we had quite an adventure trying to 
find it! ;)

August brings my busiest summer ever to a close and I was wondering if any of
you wonderful people out there have any idea of how to make the summer go out
with a *bang*!  Lot's to do... but unfortunately I have no transportation
anywhere and live in the snooze capitol of the Bay Area (Fremont).  For such
a large city there are few parties or clubs here that I'm aware of.  If
anyone is interested in hosting an end of summer bash on our side of the
water before school starts back up, please do so and let me in on the goods.
 Yah... it'll be pretty hard to find a location, but even harder for me to
find a ride across the bridge.  The void that is the bay once again keeps me
from my higher purpose.  Just think how many east bay ravers would worship
your good vibe efforts forever.  Me especially.  Thanx, and if anyone else
has an easier solution PLEASE let me know!!

Thank you to those of you who came out last friday. It was a really 
good first party. Personally, I expected a larger crowd, but we ended 
up with the exact number of people we needed to break even with... 
(until)

Difficulties and mis-communications with the space owners resulted in a 
loss of a lot of money. (shit happens)

But all in all, it was fun, and I finally got to play again. (Just next 
time I am going to try to play at the begining of the night, so I am 
not so tired!!!

Peace,

Greg :)

August 9 -- a dilemma for this Deadhead.  On the anniversary of his death,
do I mourn Jerry with the Deadheads at many of the small gatherings
organized in the area?  Or do I celebrate my current life and new family at
Hunny?

A t-shirt an old deadhead friend gave me (he had scores extra at the end of
a tour) told me the answer:  the whole Winnie-the-Pooh crew is on their way
to a Dead show, Tigger with floor tickets, the hare with taping equipment,
Kanga and Roo holding a peace flag, Winnie with a big pot of Hunny and
shades, piglet resplendent in tie-dye riding on Eeyore, who is smoking a
big fatty . . . the quoted line is "Goin' on a Feeling" from the Dead song
"Saint of Circumstance."

So, I was drawn to living in the now, and know I had a better time at Hunny
than I would have had anywhere else that night.  Although the owners at
Jerrold always put out their non-scene vibe (and i'm sorry to hear of the
$$ problems for the organizers), the Beautiful People party a couple months
back and Hunny have worked for me.  There weren't that many people, but
those who were there were dancin' and smilin' up a storm.  With the crowd
not overwhelming for the space, it was easy to sit and talk and connect
with folks, and I ran into a number of people I had only a seen a couple of
times and wanted to see again.

As for the music, I guess I'm starting to lean towards trancier stuff, as
Dutch and Greg's sets had me movin'.  The Fnf/Gateway
4-speakers-in-the-round set-up has been spoiling me (I love going to the
middle of the 4 speakers and spinning around), but with the small floor 2
were more than enough.  The decorations and lights were great, with the
appropriate depictions of pooh characters.

Altho 6 o'clock now seems early for me for an end to an evening, the
sunrise over the east bay was beautiful, and I got a good morning's sleep
before hanging out in the sun with friends.  All in all, a positive
evening, even after two impossible weekends to top in fnf and chrysalis.
But, when am i going to rest before Burning Man . . . I know I'll be out
again next weekend, and I guess i'll have to rest the weekend of the
24th-25th . . .

Had fun at the Civic Center. I was mighty pleased to see that this fair

Bukem blew me away, and I'd love to know who was playing the

SWEET!  =)

Hi folks!

 Yes Hunny was very good! The sound was very good (a trifle loud but that's 
what ear plugs are for). The music just ripped!!!! As I was working the 
slide show I didn't catch everyone's set(s) but here is a quick run thru; 
 
DJ Dan: 	really good with a lot of variety- really enjoyed it.

Jon Williams:	interesting acid/house sounding set- very danceable.

Dutch:		hard trance that drove me insane!! :)

Greg Sandler:	folks you really have to check Greg out!! He is the SHIT 
		(IMHO). Large variety of sounds and styles blended 
		together in a hypnotically seamless fashion. All his 
		songs were fresh (no overdone remixed samples here!). I 
		danced so hard to his set despite my exhaution. Also 
		possible that Greg may be the worlds most humble DJ. An 
		hour after his set he was seen sweeping the main dance floor.

 The deli was nicely decorated with all sorts of lighting; intelligant 
lights, disco lights, fog, video screen, laser, black lights galore and of 
course my slide show. I felt that the fire alarm strobes someone left on 
were a bit much (6 hours worth) but it was interesting to drive home with 
no lights blinking. :)

 Personally I felt the management at the Deli sucked big wazoo's. They 
couldn't turn off the strobes while we were cleaning, couldn't reset a 
breaker that blew, would not turn on the air conditioning (the dance 
floor was nice but it was hot upstairs), they forced us to schlep 
equipment around while we were trying to clean up and of course 
they ripped off the promoters. Another BIG problem I experienced was 
having some of my equipment packed into someone else's truck. I really 
wish folks would ASK before touching equipment that you do not know for 
certain who it belongs to.

 Met all kinds of nice people there. The only one whose name I remember is 
left jab and of course Janelle and her boyfriend (Rob?). Ran into other 
folks that I've just met in the past few weeks (HI EVERYONE!!!) The vibe 
was outstanding and the circle at the end of the evening a very nice cap 
to a delightful party. Good work folks!!!

Hugz and such,


Ran

But you're never alone when you go! Everyone's there together, sharing

Due to the unusually large number of Seth's in the Bay Area scene, I've
decided to adopt a new dj pseudonym.  My last name just doesn't have
the flashiness or simplicity of say, a Joe Rice or a John Carel :), so I
had to figure out something else. The name Seth, when translated from
Egyptian, can be spelled a number of different ways, and one of them is 
"Sutekh".

My first use of this new name is on the MAD flier for this Monday night
(8/12).  So, in case you saw a flier and wondered "who the hell is that?",
now you know.  Or maybe you're still wondering "who the hell is that?"??
Either way, I hope to see some of you there.  Introduce yourself to me if
you get the chance.

In case you've never met me, I'm a member of Consciousness Lab, and have
played in chill rooms at a bunch of Gateway parties and a few others.  I
also do a radio show on KALX every Thursday night.  My gigs playing dance
music have been limited, but I'm hoping that'll change soon.

Hope to see you at Mad,
			Seth

OK. although it's funny again. normally people complain about bad 
generalisations. you don't want to be called a nice person here.

a) there were some posts saying 'holla, black adder, couldn't have 
said it better. thanks for making these points so elegantly.' 
i think i remember amy r., i'm not sure, but there were more.

b) to treat you as the individual you crave to be treated as:
if it really is the case that you think mc donalds is a bless for 
mankind and advertising industry makes the world a nicer place to live in
(i *know* you never said that, but if you suggest people to work in 
these fields better than doing nothing, and if you call work in these 
fields a contribution to society, i must assume 
that you, to a certain extend, support these statements), 
*then* i must say YOU, as an individual, are no doubt a good friend and 
a darling with your loved ones, but i disagree with your opinions to such 
a degree that i would call them, uhem uhem, quite dangerous. but, i know, who 
am i to do this and that, and you no doubt won't spend a single sleepless 
hour for the reason of what i just said,
so everything is just fine.

yeah you are probably right.
there is a certain attitude in the way you say things like 'litters of 
children' (it's hard to explain though, maybe i'm not getting it right  
because i'm no native speaker), i think i mistook that for hate. excuse me.

everything that is really needed means everything that is really needed 
included your tissue toilet paper and most everything a person could 
dream of, as far as material goods go.
don't you *see* that your supermarkets and shopping malls and sax 5th 
avenue department stores are stuffed, you sometimes can't help asking youself 
*gosh, who needs all that crap*, and they are so *without* the work of all 
the unemployed and welfare people. 
it lies in the nature of technical progress that a decreasing number of 
people is able to produce an increasing number of goods. 

as if that lack of work wasn't a bless, your working ethics demand that 
these obsolete people do something. so what do you want them to do?
of course, you can have them clean doggy poop off peoples backyards 
(excellent business idea!). if they are a bit educated, you 
can have them program, so that every stupid text processing software 
comes kicked out in a new release every ten minutes.
no problem, as long as somebody wants to buy it.
point being: i wouldn't really call this a contribution to society.
this is mostly a contribution to *economy*. 
(what gets us to the subject that *some people* think capitalist society 
can be seen as nothing more than the hunting ground of capitalist economy.)

a *good* contribution to society would be if you took care for hiv 
positives; or if you put up a nice playground for children where they 
could roam around and build wooden shacks and paint on walls or whatever, 
and you would be there to watch that nobody gets hurt and give them advice; or
if you organized some kind of neighbor-exchange-help-babysitting-stuff, god, 
whatever,i don't know. just something nice.
like i said, normally you don't get paid for that.
you can tar and feather me, i will never call frying hamburger patties at 
mc donalds a contribution to society, with the positive emphasis that 
statement apparently has for you 
(a *good* contribution to society nonetheless might be if mom in her little 
corner cafe does so. i think there's a visible difference.) 

*my* working ethics (yes even me has some...) demands that i do my job ok.
it doesn't demand that i and everybody else do *some* job on every cost.
this society is so damn rich, just milk those capitalists a bit more 
instead of letting them enjoy all the profits and the working people pay 
for all the expenses of the economy. 
i totally agree with you in the point that somebody who lives on welfare 
and watches tv all day long is not necessarily a morally outstanding person.
to drive the agreement to an almost painful threshold, i also think that 
those people, au contraire, sometimes tend to be a bit more on the down side, 
fucking lazy drugdealing punks and litterbugs that they are.
but, for me, things wouldn't get any better if all these people suddenly 
started to appear in late night commercials trying to sell me some 
patented device to mop the kitchen floor. (apart from the fact that i'm 
pretty convinced that *there are just not enough jobs*)
maybe this would work out for them, because some of them seem to have major 
problems killing their time now, but i wouldn't feel better and, IMO, the 
state of the world wouldn't be a bit better if they did. worser, if you 
ask me.
but anyway.
have a nice day everybody.

but then there's no need to keep the defence expenses high, 
which was what you originally stated. it is indeed paranoid logic to 
mistake a possible reason for an intent.

true enough. so why do you support that behaviour with your arguments.

well i guess i just want you to admit that you live in a motherfucking 
plague boil of a country not worth wiping russias butt with. (joke)
somehow i like it that you refuse to do so...

I used to go clubbing all the time on my own and have been to a few raves
on my own as well.  I even went to check out a brand new club by myself a
few years ago cos i was bored.  I always end up meeting folks (new friends
or old!) so it doesn't matter if i start off the night by myself :)

This past Friday i went to the Perseid party by myself and had an awesome 
time.  if i'd waited to go WITH someone i'd never have made it there :)

mayday (~80K? people) is super super commercial. and it is no way for free, 
but something like 50$ or so if i'm correctly informed. 
love parade in berlin is super commercial as well. it had like *500 K* 
people wallowing through the inner city streets this year, the whole shit being 
broadcasted on mtv. this one was admittedly for free (you can hardly build a 
spike wired fence around the city center), but the parties  thrown in the 
night were 25-40$ affairs. 
i don't think you can prevent raveland from being commercialized (where 
there are loads of people keen on gladly spending their money for parties with
*underground vibe* commercialization is just around the corner; and here 
in germany some of the pioneers of the scene are amongst the big winners of 
commercialization and actively working on it), but it's not always a nice 
view. commercialization in itself is not necessarily bad, only it 
strangely comes along with loss of charme and vibe.
it doesn't make sense to complain, but WON'T YOU GUYS LONG FOR THOSE 50K 
MASSIVES!!!!! 
i don't want to frighten you, but, uhem, i'm afraid those notes in the 
bay guardian are a very very bad sign...:)

In case I haven't made my position clear in the last 20 or so posts on 
the subject:

1) I do not care if people work or do not work.
2) I do not want to pay for people that choose not to work.
3) I get upset when people want me to pay so they can sit on their ass.
4) I do not think that the people in 3 constitute the majority of people
   on welfare, however I do believe they account for a significant 
   percentage.

And all these things sound great. Let's have people do that. Let's bring
back public works projects, and let people do community service if 
they want to continue to receive welfare. But make them do *something*
for the money that they currently get for doing *nothing.*

By all means, lets destroy the concepts of initiative and drive. Lets 
take away things people have gone out and *earned* and give it to those 
that do nothing. What a brilliant idea.

That said, I do believe there is a great deal of corporate greed in the 
world. And it is getting much worse, not better. However, "let's take some 
more from them" results in taking more from *us* When you raise taxes on 
business the costs get passed onto the consumer. What's the answer to 
this? I don't know. I haven't the foggiest clue. I do know that "let's 
just take more from them" has not worked, does not work, and will not 
work. All of us end up bearing the costs, not the people you set out to 
make pay.

Look for Allsop (Alsop?) cleaning products, they are the sh*t!  I think
they have a vinyl cleaning kit, and I know they have cassette player

Believe it or not, U.S. military expenditures have been lessened, now 
that the "cold war" is "over." And the trend continues, which is a good 
thing. Things are being scaled back. It cannot all be done overnight, as 
some would wish. It is also important to remember that a lot of jobs are 
being lost as this occurs. It is a balancing act.

I don't like a lot of things that the U.S. is doing. Sometimes I am

There is a mailing list at nwraves@hyperreal.com, and they have a web site
as well which you can get to from the sfraves site.  Electrolush is easily
the best weekly in Seattle, and it's held at the Showbox on 1st near Pike
(across from the Pike Place Market) but I think only on friday nights.  The
Showbox is open on Saturday, but unless things have changed (which they may
have) Electrolush is only on friday.  If you're interested I could hook you
up with some friends of mine up there who frequently go to parties.  Just
let me know.  --David

Something I have to get off my chest.

At the last four events I have been to, everyone has been facing the DJ in
a concentric circle pattern.  Not only does this spook me, but it is
anti-thetical to the whole rave vibe, IMHO.  It is about you, about us,
about being free.  Not facing the *star*.  Please STOP.  Face your
neighbor.  Be your own star.

What do people think?  Am I missing something?

arkay

P.S. - and FUCK all DJs who are cultivating this star status mentality. (I
don't care if I get flamed for that).

Please include me in the list of people searching for the illusive Moonpup.
A friend of mine would like him to spin at a possible upcoming party.  Thank
you.

extending his trip and staying there through september as well.

any more or updated info, email me and i'll give you his addy.

I'd have to agree.  Arkay, you're definitely not missing something ;o)
I think sometimes the pattern is less conscious than
people think...sort of how like sometimes people's eyes gravitate to the
TV if it's on, etc...and usually one faces the speakers, which are
usually aligned with the DJ...what I like to do, if there is space, is
just sort of bounce around to different areas, try to dance with others
for a bit, and then move on...I also like to spin sometimes, but usually
this isn't very easily done without bumping into someone =) Generally, if
you start to tilt around to dance with the person behind/beside you, they
are pretty receptive.  Even if it's just for a while :o)
And it's a lot more fun than staring straight ahead at the person's back,
or at the floor, but I have to say at times I am guilty of floor staring
:) I think it's the long hair %^)

peas,
shamini

Subject: HUNNY review and deli gripes.
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk


HUNNY was a nice mellow party.. good for a friday night.  Initially there
were some bad vibes present ( assholes harassing and grabbing a female
friend at least 4 times  <WTF?>)  This made her almost want to leave, and
party elsewhere... But we put on our own positive vibes, and drowned out
that negativity.  I understand the need for a safe, non-bustable space like
the deli, but THE DELI SUCKS (IMHO).  People have had cars broken into (more
than once), and there seems to be quite an asshole factor there sometimes.
There are hardcore water Nazis, and $3 for water <sigh>.   

PLEASE UNDERSTAND, I am not dissing the promoters of this event.  They did a
great job of decorating and putting a lot of energy and effort forth.  I
think that if this party had been elsewhere... (east bay perhaps?) it would
have GONE OFF!  

Dutch blew us away with some hard-driving Psycho trance... I was expecting
the funky breaks from DJ Dan, but he played some slightly experimental stuff..  

We left slightly early, and headed to the east bay to chill.  We ended up at
Lake Temescal park in Montclair.  This is a great little park to chill at
early in the morn, cause it opens at 5:00 (though the gates for parking
don't open untill 8:00), there's lots of grass, a playground, and a little
beach where you can stretch out in the sand.   I don't know if it would be
good for a party though. (cause there are lots of homes right there, and the
sound would travel well over the water)

So, Hi and Hugs to everyone I saw at HUNNY, and Have a great week everyone!

Aaron.

BTW:  Standing on your head, and doing yoga positions is great while you're
mashing out. =)

Being knee deep in the job search myself I though I'd pass this along.
 There's a 2 mo. contract position available doing software installs, basic
mac enviro set up stuff.  It's 40 hrs/wk , TEMPORARY but probably pass pretty
well.  Let me know if you're interested.  Also let me know if you hear of any
design related positions/contracts.

nope... people need to focus on SOMETHING. as soon as someone busts out a
pair of glo-sticks or starts breakdancing, people stop facing the DJ, but
until then he/she's the closest thing to a focal point. I don't think DJ
idolization is much of a problem except at big parties where people come to
see a specific dj... smaller UG's seem to have less of this.

 This is a good one, since I talk to a lot of DJ's and on more that one
occasion has this information been relayed back to me:

DJ's generally enjoy people facing them for purposes other than fame.  I know
some DJ's that like seeing famillar faces while they spin, bringing down the
nervousness level between DJ and crowd.   Others look at the crowd in order
to see if what they're spinning is "right" or "off" (This is my MAIN reason).
  Some Dj's have said they watch the crowd as a visual monitor, watching the
crowd move helps them stay onbeat or singals if they're on the droves of a
trainwreck.  Some people watch a DJ to see if the song is really being mixed
in or if it's just a really sick record.  And then theres the "newbe" DJ's
that are watching and taking notes as how to be more adept @ thier art.
mimicing and praticing the very same mixed in the confines of thier home...



As for "Star Status" well, as I always say, "we create our own reality.." 
When I spin, I generally step from out of the crowd myself (since im dancing
like crazy) not kicking it with ,what seems like, an inner circle behind the
turntables.  While dj'ing im hardly aware of the crowd @ times, putting
myself as much into the music as possible.  Im trying to cure myself of this,
since the crowd can "feel" @ times when it's being neglected.. When I step
off the "vibe platters" I join the crowd, dancing away reality, creating my
own.
If you believe in your heart that all of this is just to pump a Dj's ego,
then it might be time to step back and look at your own...


"dance with me...."

Dear All

The Mantra people are all deeply sorry to have to inform you that we lost our
space at Clemintina Alley this Sunday, and there's no chance of getting it
back =( 
It was all very short notice (we found out late Saturday night/early Sunday
morning) so we had no time to think of another place.
We had some heavy conflict with the management at Cat's and so they kicked us
out. I'm sure that it's all good in the end, and time for us to move on to
something with a higher vibration. To be honest, I personally didn't feel
good about this club, and thought the staff and management were a bunch of
wankers. AND someone actually stole beautiful sacred things from my altar
(talk about bad karma) I see this as a sign ofsomething being "wrong" in the
energy fields around Mantra. Time to  shift gears and move on elsewhere. I'm
glad we're out of there, but really sorry to let everyone else down.
We will be taking a short break from Mantra until after Burning Man (we may
throw a free party before then, check our info # 415 331 1500 x888)  We hope
to be back in a new location possibly on Friday nights. Look for our new
flyers.
Thankyou so much for supporting us and bringing your good vibes into our
space. We love you all (yes, even the thieves) and hope to see you soon at
our next venue.
Love and light from Mantra

I have mixed feelings on this issue, because I see dj'ing as an artform and
occasionally I really enjoy looking at art.  I will usually spend atleast a
few minutes up front at a party watching the dj do his/her thing....not all
night, just for a few songs.  I don't see it as worshiping, I just respect a
good dj and periodically like to see him/her make it happen.  

On the other hand, if that is all a person does is stand up front and watch,
well I'm not into that.  Maybe we could hook up some kind of video system
for these people and sit them in a room with a bunch of moitors showing
different angles of what the dj is doing.  Ya think :)  Maybe get a comentator?

I don't mind having everyone face the dj.  I don't see it as worshiping 
the dj.  I find that when most people are facing the same direction 
there is more of a sense of unity.  
When I've been to parties where everyone is facing many different 
directions the energy has felt more scattered to me.

I'd like to know why I had to pay $15 last night on top of $20 for my
original ticket to Nation (yes I know I can get a full refund eventually) and
still not get to see Sasha.
The only reason I went to this event at all was to see Sasha, one of the best
DJs we have in England (and of course John Digweed who did spin a blinding
set).
So where the fuck was he???
I understand he played a 5-6 hour set at 1015 on Saturday night, and that he
was too wasted to play on Sunday aswell.
So my next big question is why weren't we informed on the Nation/Spundae info
line that he was going to spin at 1015 on Saturday night???? I would much
rather have seen Sasha than driven to Santa Cruz for the goa party (much as I
love the trance scene, I would have done anything for the chance to see Sasha
play in San Francisco).
So I appreciate everyone at Nation/Spundae for trying to get this off the
ground against heavy opposition, but I am also extremely frustrated at not
seeing Sasha last night. I would never have gone to this event last night and
paid $15 if I had known that he wasn't going to spin.

the near shutting down by the S.F. Popo and a few other instances...  I had
the privlige of playing ticket taker (such a glorious job =P).  But a
delightful time neverless, conversing with everybody that popped thier heads
outside for a breath of fresh air (aploigies to thoses who had a hard time
getting in and out after 3AM, cos, well, I want'ed to be dancing on the floor
too ;). 
I must say DRC left an impression on me, it was an honor to hear her spin...

Saturday: After: helping cleanup from the F-8 event, a birthyday partie in
SJ, the power outage causing 2hrs to get from SJ to SF, and Nation getting
shut down (not to mention staying up for 36+ hrs) I pretty much shut down
myself on Saturday night...  But from what I hear, nothing much was agoing on
anyhow...

Sunday, Civic Center Dancing in the shadows of city hall.  The coolest
feeling of feeling the vibe from the dragonflies contenusly buzzing around
the speakers and turntables.  The police playing babysitter, checking up on
is every 1/2 hr or so.  People smiling and having a grand ole time despite a
few other people running around w/ cameras and camecorders(ecch, defenetly
not a photogenic person). Left @ about 4ish to do some shopping to add to my
vinyal collection.  Left the City @ 6:30 and spent the evening intergrateing
the new tunes to the allready ultra cool tracks I posses...

Weekend highs: Meeting some new SFRavers (You know who you are),  having a
really deep discussion w/someone about truths and realities discovering im
not alone in my quest.

Weekend lows: Calling to find out DOWN 2 EARTH was cancelled, Having to "step
up" on a drunk guy who was forcing himself on a girl...

But weekends were made such fun...   Sorta sad to se it go...

Till next time,

"dance with me..."

     I didn't know anybody in the Bay area who raved.  I just went one 
     night.  Nobody brought me.  I almost like it better alone because 
     there's no babysitting, or that clique-iness, or you and your friends 
     just talking about stuff and wrapped up in the subjective experience 
     (group viewpoint, close peer relationships,etc).  You walk in, the 
     journey begins.  This is getting tougher now as I get to know more of 
     you, but it's really beautiful.  That's how you seperate the vibey 
     ones... they come out at you.  They share and speak for the group.  If 
     you can, go alone someday.  It really helps you appreciate the 
     intangible aspects of the whole thing.
     
     Plus, now when I find those people I met when I was alone, it's really 
     beautiful.  Thanks to everybody who reached out... I'm still touched 
     and that's why I go.

I have mixed feelings on this issue, because I see dj'ing as an artform and
occasionally I really enjoy looking at art.  I will usually spend atleast a
few minutes up front at a party watching the dj do his/her thing....not all
night, just for a few songs.  I don't see it as worshiping, I just respect a
good dj and periodically like to see him/her make it happen.  

On the other hand, if that is all a person does is stand up front and watch,
well I'm not into that.  Maybe we could hook up some kind of video system
for these people and sit them in a room with a bunch of moitors showing
different angles of what the dj is doing.  Ya think :)  Maybe get a comentator?

how bout we just go with the flow and let people stare at teh dj if they 
want, maybe its their best friend theyre looking at, maybe theyre a dj 
too and enjoy seeing the actual act happen as well as hearing it. 
different people do different things for different reasons and im not 
about to pass judgments. ive stared at djs many a times just awed by what 
im hearing, and actually seeing the human being navigating teh vibe with 
their choice of record. as far as rock concert feel goes, well, im quite 
intuitive to go to those parties that i want to be at:)

hello all-

my take on this whole "should we or should we not face the dj?" is this -
YOU FACE THE DIRECTION YOU WANT TO FACE!!!  YOU LET OTHERS FACE THE
DIRECTION THEY WANT TO FACE!

i find that it changes as the course of the rave progresses.  sometimes a
crowd in general is feeling bonding centered, where people are really hipp
on meeting each other.  sometimes a crowd in general is very other centered,
where most individuals are collectively concentrating on something other,
like a dj.  and there are individuals that are in their own universe and
want to stay there.

IT'S ALL GOOD.  do what you are going to do where you are going to do it.
if you don't like the vibe of this party, either get people to turn around
(unlikely), leave and go to another party (more likely), or find your space,
create your own vibe, and the people who are on the same plain as you will
come.  guarenteed.

let each dance in his or her own way.

love to you all, regardless of the universe in which you choose to reside-

Well... usually I am too busy meeting people or dancing to be watching the
DJ much.. but I remember one instance when I did.  It was at Carlos'
birthday party at the deli (beginning of summer), and he finally came on at
like 5:30 in the morning after Dubtribe and other good DJs..   I was really
tired from dancing all night, but Carlos was throwing down the BEST music.
So I was up in the balcony right over the turntables, and could look down
right over the mixers and tables.. but I could only see Carlos' hands.  I
also could look out over the whole room, and see all the happy people
RUSHING to the music.  

So I think that watching DJs is fine, as long as you're not being annoying
to the DJs themselves or anyone else. Hehe... this reminds me of a story
about this naked girl jumping on DJ Dimitri's tables during some party. =)

hello all!

i'm having a small dinner at my place (my jerk roommates are gone!) for
anyone going to mad tonight!  everyone is invited.  yes, everyone is
invited.  we'll eat at 8, hang out, and then go out to mad.

who's up?  i don't have food for everybody, so i'd love for people to bring
stuff!  i'm up for it, so let's keep responses to this public so people can
know what's already being brought.

i'll be e-mail accesible (duh!) and phone accessible.  


love-

matt l

I already have plans to go out to dinner tonight in SF with some friends, but
maybe I can talk them into stopping by mad afterwards.  Hopefully I'll see you

 I myself was a little miffed about the Sasha incident.  I actually left around 
3.30 AM because I had to get to work early today.  I was disappointed that 
Sasha hadn't yet played, but my body was beginning to shut down from lack of 
food, water, and sleep.
 I do have to say that I have one of Digweed's mixed CD's, and he did rock the 
place this morning.  But that's no consolation when you've paid good money to 
come and see the best DJ (imho) in the world.  
 Just thought I'd let you know how I feel.

Mail*Link SMTP               just another boring night in the east bay

August brings my busiest summer ever to a close and I was wondering if any of
you wonderful people out there have any idea of how to make the summer go out
with a *bang*!  Lot's to do... but unfortunately I have no transportation
anywhere and live in the snooze capitol of the Bay Area (Fremont).  For such
a large city there are few parties or clubs here that I'm aware of.  If
anyone is interested in hosting an end of summer bash on our side of the
water before school starts back up, please do so and let me in on the goods.
 Yah... it'll be pretty hard to find a location, but even harder for me to
find a ride across the bridge.  The void that is the bay once again keeps me
from my higher purpose.  Just think how many east bay ravers would worship
your good vibe efforts forever.  Me especially.  Thanx, and if anyone else
has an easier solution PLEASE let me know!!

Finally got a new radio for my office at work.  (some of you may remember me
being bummed a couple of months ago when my other one was stolen)  Music is
soooooo cool.  It makes such a difference in my mental attitude duing work.

I'm listening to the new Orbital "In-Sides"  It's a really good album if you
haven't heard it yet.  

Wearing a suit, tie and a name badge, but still feeling the vibe :)

The company where I work just hired Value.net to do their ip 
routing, based on the recommendation of an employee.

My experience has been that their routers go down at least once 
per day.  usually it's only for a few minutes, but it sucks 
nonetheless.

so value.net is a misnomer, as is best.com, IMHO.

	You might want to just coat the inside with tin foil and let 
people throw food on it because anyone who wants to stand around cooking 
over hot charcoal during the daytime is pretty insane...

Consider this a personal response, and in no way representitive of my 
employers viewpoint(although I hope he would agree): You are full of shit. 
Period. I am the Sys Admin of Value Net. I bust my ass to make sure the 
system stays up. Our routers and everything else do not, and never have gone 
down on a daily basis. 

1) I have network monitoring utilities that tell me when something goes 
   down. In two seperate locations for redundancy.  
2) I have hooks to paging software to page me if a piece of our equipment
   goes down. 
3) We were down on Sat. night for approximately 1/2 hour while we drove
   to get the back-up generator. This was the first unscheduled down-time
   in *MONTHS*

If your employer is having problems, *CALL US*. Suprisingly, unlike many 
other smaller ISP's, you will get a human, that will talk to you promptly. 
But please before casting aspersions on myself and the company I work for, 
get your fucking facts straight.

quick weekend report - nation obviously wasn't happening so we decided to
go to the old standby, 1015.  haven't been in a while due to imposing,
round-the-block lines but we quickly got to the front of the line around
11:30 only to be denied entrance due to my tennis shoes.  weak!
decisions decisions... sound factory or club universe?  we decided that
it was too early for universe (too meat-markety before 2am) so we dropped
down $10 for some mediocre club house being played at excruciating volume
at sound factory.  after it let out we went back to 1015 where they were
more than happy to take my cash and tennies..  the main floor was rocking,
and the music was out of sight!  was that sasha who played until 8 or so?
also, when did they rearrange the dj setup?  with the new setup the
crowd lines up facing the dj in that concentric half-circle, stare at
your neighbors back mode being talked about in the raves vs. rock concerts
thread.  anyway after dancing my proverbial ass off for four hours,
i needed to chill so we went to the other old standby, the endup for
a beautiful sunny sunday morning kicking it in the backyard with some
heinekens and a fattie.  the mighty dub katz at +8% got my attention
so it was back on the dance floor for a couple more hours before returning
home around noontime for some chili verde, a hot shower and a nice long nap..
i'm not as bummed about missing nation as i am about missing the LTJ bukem
drum&bass freebie.. damn!!!  see yall next time...

It would appear that there is a problem with Majordomo at Hyperreal. 
Before making assinine jokes, how about taking a few minutes to examine 
your mail headers?

The ultimate irony of our Saturday night (spent, you probably recall from 
my last post, in fruitless pursuit of a killer dancefloor) is that Sasha 
was spinning at 1015!!   ARRGHH!!  I was originally thinking of Nation 
_only_ to see this renowned dj.

We rejected 1015 on our travels through SF that night because I have been 
to that awful thing they call a party on Saturday nights, RELEASE.  Two 
times, more than a year ago.  Back then, it was cheesy 70's and the 
weakest clubhouse imaginable, with meat-market mentality goin' full 
force.  But Sasha's appearance there makes me wonder...is 1015 as bad 
Saturday nights as it used to be?

What kind of music is played now?  How's the crowd?  Cost?  Closing 
time?  Any info/reviews/opinions would be great!

Thanks,
Nancy

Okay, good point, Matt!

Sounds like a good time, and it'd be nice to meet some of
y'all :) I'll bring some veggie patties for fellow veggies
and veg-curious.

***This is a bricklayer's accident report that was printed in the newsletter of
the English equivalent of the Workers' Compensation Board. Thanks to John
Sedgwick for this report.***

Dear Sir:
     I am writing in response to your request for additional information in
Block #3 of the accident reporting form. I put "Poor Planning" as the cause
of my accident. You asked for a fuller explanation and I trust the following
details will be sufficient.

     I am a bricklayer by trade. On the day of the accident, I was working
alone on the roof of a new six-story building. When I completed my work, I
found I had some bricks left over which when weighed later were found to
weigh 240 lbs. Rather than carry the bricks down by hand, I decided to lower
them in a barrel by using a pulley which was attached to the side of the
building at the sixth floor.

     Securing the rope at ground level, I went up to the roof, swung the
barrel out and loaded the bricks into it. Then I went down and untied the
rope, holding it tightly to insure a slow descent of the 240 lbs of bricks.
You will note on the accident reporting form that my weight is 135 lbs.
     Due to my surprise at being jerked off the ground so suddenly, I lost
my presence of mind and forgot to let go of the rope. Needless to say, I
proceeded at a rapid rate up the side of the building.

     In the vicinity of the third floor, I met the barrel which was now
proceeding downward at an equally impressive speed. This explains the
fractured skull, minor abrasions and the broken collarbone, as listed in
Section 3 of the accident reporting form.

     Slowed only slightly, I continued my rapid ascent, not stopping until
the fingers of my right hand were two knuckles deep into the pulley which I
mentioned in Paragraph 2 of this correspondence. Fortunately by this time I
had regained my presence of mind and was able to hold tightly to the rope,
in spite of the excruciating pain I was now beginning to experience.

     At approximately the same time, however, the barrel of bricks hit the
ground, and the bottom fell out of the barrel. Now devoid of the weight of
the bricks, the barrel weighed approximately 50 lbs. I refer you again to my
weight.

     As you might imagine, I began a rapid descent down the side of the
building. In the vicinity of the third floor, I met the barrel coming up.
This accounts for the two fractured ankles, broken tooth and severe
lacerations of my legs and lower body.

     Here my luck began to change slightly. The encounter with the barrel
seemed to slow me enough to lessen my injuries when I fell into the pile of
bricks and fortunately only three vertebrae were cracked.

     I am sorry to report, however, as I lay there on the pile of bricks, in
pain, unable to move and watching the empty barrel six stories above me, I
again lost my composure and presence of mind and let go of the rope . . .

Hi all!

 As some of you may have heard I lost my day runner (with all my phone 
#s) and am feeling a bit sad. Would those folks that I have had phone #s 
from please write me and let me know what your #s are again?
 Thanx in advance!! :)



Peace out,

That's a very strong possibility:) However, I've got a free copy of HotDog

Just my .02 worth.  People are not mindless cattle and should not act as
such.  I wholeheartedly agree with the Dj's view.  Since most ravers are
seeking the vibe, perhaps they should focus on just that.  Love.  

The invisiable energy of Love projected out of themselves like a river,
towards their brothers and sisters would perhaps make a wonderful focal
point.  Especially when shared with the DJ, lighting people and everyone
else participating, the focal point need only be Love.  The evidence of
things unseen lay in the ability to focus upon everything.  Taking in all
welcome and even unwelcomed sights, sounds, colors and experiences--and from
there projecting what is appropriately righteous for Love.

Well they said that was Sasha going on at 6am and I'd say he was by far
the best DJ of the evening (though I liked most of the others)
Unfortunately my aging, decrepit body was unable to muster the energy
to dance--at 7:30 when I left there were plenty of people still shakin'
their thang.

Amen!  although I would argue that the movie had the strongest anti-drug
message I think I've ever seen in a movie, precisely *because* the 
movie didn't beat you over the head with its message.
I got the soundtrack--it's great!

I reguarly have difficulties accessing the 'net.  Very often, about once
per day, normally accessible sites become completely inaccessible. 
Netscape times out -- tells me it can't find even AltaVista.  I
complained to the higher powers in our organization, in fact the one
that recommended you, and he responded to me "oh, one of their routers
probably rebooted" and shrugged.  Case closed, as far as he was
concerned.

Now if you want to tell me I'm full of shit because I said your routers
go down once per day, then you go right ahead.  Maybe they don't and
maybe I AM full of shit on that matter.

But if you're trying to tell me that I don't experience delays and
network problems regularly, then YOU, dear snake, are full of shit,
because I do.  Full stop.  End of matter, as far as I am concerned.

All that equipment and you STILL can't get it right?  ;-)  Maybe you
should get some monitering equipment for your monitering equipment!

I'm really surprised, Black Adder.  In all the messages I've read by
you, you normally come across as being very reasonable.  You certainly
never seemed as STUPID as you do now.  I mean, come on, now!  I JUST
TOLD YOU THAT MY COMPANY IS A CLIENT OF YOURS AND YOU JUST TOLD ME I'M
FULL OF SHIT?  That's pretty stupid Black Adder, really really stupid.

I had looked forward to meeting you once.  And now I can only look
forward to some asshole sysadmin upstream from me reading all my
correspondence and trying to figure out exactly WHO I am and WHICH
machine I'm on so they can FUCK with me.

Good luck with your routers, snake,
p.

I know lots of people who do. Personally, I try to go with a partner
(ideally my wife) whenever possible, to have somebody on a similar
wavelength who can bounce all the good vibes back at you. I don't think
it's dangerous, or anything like that. It's just so much more fun when you
can share the happiness with someone you care about.

Driving there and back with people *is* a good idea, if only to avoid
falling asleep on the way home.

On this thread of driving while impaired (once again, I have to say duh!
how can someone actually make an argument that driving high, drunk, spun,
exhausted, whatever, is actually ok?)....

For those who have seen the California drivers license handbook recently
... they no longer refer to "accidents" ... because they are really not
accidents, they are COLLISIONS!!  There is no accident about having a
collision with another vehicle, a tree, a pedestrian, whatever.  Even if
someone else caused it, if you're driving consciously and seeing what's up,
you can avoid it.

Someone, somewhere is responsible, either for
-driving when their reaction time was less than usual
-for being a lousy driver to begin with (ever watch how some car's wheels
are drifting in their lane on the freeway?  these are people who cannot
steer their car without over-correcting, there oughta be a school for
that!)
-for allowing themselves to be distracted (I think handheld car phones
should be outlawed for most of the population)
-for not taking care of their car (I overheard two girls at FnF talking
about leaving during the night, even though their car had no headlights --
for crying out loud!  that's so ridiculous!)

Driving is a big responsibility, and if you're not up to it, that's ok,
just don't do it.

Ranting (and not much raving lately!)

I think it's important as an human being to learn to be so comfortable with
yourself that you can do anything alone.  Movies, restaurants, traveling,
whatever.  You don't have to do it all the time, and it's fun to be with
friends, too, but if you are dependent on other people coming along to go
anywhere, you'll end up going where THEY want, and not where YOU want, a
lot of the time.

Besides, even when you go to a party with friends, half the time you're
wandering around alone anyway!  Extra advantage, you get to leave when YOU
want, no negotiating!

One of the biggest breakthroughs in my life was when I was visiting my
sister in Phila, and it was my birthday, and I wanted to go out and dance
... but had no one to go with me, so I went alone and found a club that
looked interesting, asked the door guy what kind of music they played
(house was the right answer) and went in and danced for 2 hours.  I was
probably the only person there alone, and was one of the only people
dancing solo on the dance floor, and was definitely the most tattooed and
pierced woman there (come to think of it, I was probably the only one not
wearing tight jeans and a half-shirt with poufy hair), but I had fun,
because I did what I wanted to do!  Was it a little scary?  Yep.  Was it
worth it?  Totally!

Ok, my turn!!  Hmm, now I can't think of anything to say.  Good salad, good

y'alls should come out!  Lotsa fun, and each time I do it I end up meeting
new people, very cool.  Ok, next person.

um, i think this is supposed to be private mail? seems you sent this to 
the list as well, not a bad thing but weve been keeping planning off teh 
list to keep from cluttering mailboxes (unfortunetly im doing the same 
cuz i deleted everyones email addresses)
in ideal conditions we will start on time, but some of us are helping 
with that other party friday nite and there is always chance for lag due 
to unforseen circumstances. two djs have agreed to dividing time 
remaining after setup, altho i like set schedules i wouldnt want to argue 
that way since im playing, and i dont mind sharing the time either.  

i talked with le le today, he'll be coming up from LA friday.

other than that, all seems good.

I just got back from "Trainspotting."  Yow, excellent movie even if
the initial part of the "friend reaccumulation period" in London
did drag a bit.  Overall good cinematography, good screenplay, good
acting...I wanna read the book now.  Anyone read it???  Comments
(book v. movie)???

"Basketball Diaries" actually had a similar anti-drug message.  Though,
I should say there was little humor in "Basketball Diaries" and
certainly no techno.  :>(  Still it is worth the watch.

Do they really have a dress code there?   (What a concept!)
Does that require the wearing of uncomforable shoes?  (To dance in??????????)

 To tell you the truth, I kind of like going to raves by my self.  Up 
until this summer I always went with large groups of friends or with my girl 
friend and her friends.  Although they were all great people, I found 
that I didn't meet that many NEW people.  When I wanted a hug, I could 
always find the friends (that I came with) and I usually didn't wander as 
much because we had a central meeting spot.  But this summer my friends 
always found excuses not to go party and my girl friend was gone for the 
summer, so I hade no choice but to go by my self.  There was some great 
parties that I didn't want to miss because I didn't have anybody to go 
with.  And at all of those parties (BP, SFR picnic, and FnF) that I went 
to by my self I met some wonderful people. So my point is most people 
that go to raves are friendly, open, loving people that are always happy 
to meet new people and make friends.  Trying going by yourself, you might 
like it.

Love, mew, mew, purrrrr, plurrrrrrrrrrrr

P.S. another plus is that you get to leave when you want to leave, no 
more complaining friends to deal with.

This is a "humble thought?" You are claiming that our service goes down 
on a daily basis, which is patently false. I am in charge of the routers 
you claim go down every day. Yes, I am pissed. Have someone tell you that 
you do a shitty job and you are incompetent, when they don't have clue one 
about what goes on, and see how you feel. 

I notice you didn't include the rest of you "humble thoughts" saying that 
"value.net was a misnomer." You're a real humble guy alright.

Well, it seems there are two people at your organization that are very

If you had half as much interest in knowing the reasons that you can't 
get to sites sometimes as you do as casting aspersions on people and 
things you know absolutely nothing about, you never would have posted 
your original statement. 

Inability to reach certain sites can be caused by many different things 
that have absolutely *NOTHING* to do with your provider. Perhaps some 
disinterested third party would be kind enough to offer you some 
education on the subject. As for myself, I am seemingly too incompetent 
to do so.

Maybe we should spend our money buying clues for the clueless. Here's a 
quarter. Buy yourself one. Because *you* do not have an understanding of the 
issues involving connectivity, this does not constitute failure, 
incompetence, or inability on *my* part.

I am reasonable, up to the point where someone who has absolutely no idea 
what they are talking about slams the work I do, my ability to do 
that work, and unfairly accuses my company of lousy service in a public 
forum.     

This is not work. This is not my work account.  I can, and will say 
whatever I feel like from this account. And as I have pointed out before 
all the opinions expressed are mine alone.

Really? So you could make snyde remarks about our service? Personally I 
could care less now. You seem to have an overinflated ego if you think you 
are that important for me to throw aside any vestige of professionalism on the 
job to "fuck with you." It would be entirely improper for me to use any of the
information at my disposal to negatively affect yours or your employers 
service, and I would never do so. Again, as before, you make suggestions 
that have no basis in reality.     

> Good luck with your routers, snake,

Good luck on your clue hunt. Wait I think I see one! better grab it while 
you can!

Oh, I don't know... It is kinda like a ring side seat to a bloody boxing

 Sasha was "ON!!" at 7 and was going off.  The hotline said he was to be on 
at 11pm..I stayed till 6 because Dennis Taylor was shreddin unbelievable. 
Im sorry you missed it..and your point is well taken about DJ's 
appearances.
its 4:00pm and I just woke up. God bless my bed.

                                     L., l.
So where the fuck was he???
I understand he played a 5-6 hour set at 1015 on Saturday night, and that 
he
was too wasted to play on Sunday aswell.
So my next big question is why weren't we informed on the Nation/Spundae 
info
line that he was going to spin at 1015 on Saturday night???? I would much
rather have seen Sasha than driven to Santa Cruz for the goa party (much as 
I
love the trance scene, I would have done anything for the chance to see 
Sasha
play in San Francisco).
So I appreciate everyone at Nation/Spundae for trying to get this off the
ground against heavy opposition, but I am also extremely frustrated at not
seeing Sasha last night. I would never have gone to this event last night 
and
paid $15 if I had known that he wasn't going to spin.

Okay, here's a thought; I've been to a couple of parties and weeklies
where alcohol is served. But after a drink, I usually feel tired and
numb, and for some reason it just seems incompatible with my usual
rave experience.

So I was thinking, has anyone ever thought of serving coffee ???
It would seem like the perfect beverage; keeps you awake, makes you
hyper and tingly... not bad.

I'm assuming this isn't an original idea, but I haven't seen it
done yet. Anyone with a spare Cappuccino maker or Mr. Coffee lying
around?

Well, I am pretty insane when it comes to my BBQ. I've done it a few other

because I was hired by a company to do there company picnic. However I will
have things to keep me cool and I'm not going to be hovering over it that much.

I totally like your idea about the tin foil and have actually done that once
before and if it hot it cooks pretty good. I plain on cooking at least my
food when it starts getting dark.

Thanks for the suggestion and the concern. I just might even do that doing
the day and flaming it up at night.

     This discussion reminds me of another from awile back which was 
should the DJ be on the dance floor in the first place. I feel that the 
DJ should be there right with everyone who is dancing and I agree that 
there is a sense of togetherness when everyone is facing the same way.
For me, the DJ acts as sort of a guide while I'm dancing. There is 
nothing like being right up front near the DJ and seeing him or her 
really getting into their set. It gives me an extra boost of energy
to keep right on dancing=).

BAD NEWS = 3 friends that consistantly flake at the last minute have once 
again remained true to form and bailed out of our pimpin' Burning Man RV 
at the last possible moment (when the $$$ came due). 

GOOD NEWS = We have space for 2-3 more people in our tribe. Warning, The 
trip is still pretty EXPENSIVE though.  If you're SERIOUSLY interested 
shoot me a private email and I can give you all the specifics. Looks like 
we'll be leaving Wednesday, 28th p.m. Warning #2, the other 4 people 
confirmed on this RV are completely inconsiderate, never sleep, and like 
really loud music. Nuff said...

hey steve (and all)-

bring my cappuchino machine.  i think it might be a healthier alternative to
those who use other substances just to stay awake.  anyone else interested?

yo,

Whatever you set up for next weekend, or whenever for that matter, let me
know...  I reside in Fremont as well...   So at least you have some mode of
transportation, eh?  And if you want to try to devise some kind of
houseparty-type thingie (it seems the rage in Fremont) I do DJ (Trance,
hardcore, and cyber) and have tables and a mixer (No sound system tho...)...


Spins,

Adam

Actually I was told by the people throwing this event that Sasha was coming
on at 2.00am, after Digweed who was spinning at 12.00.
What I heard after he didn't come on at this promised time, was that Sasha
was too tired after spinning for 6 hours the night before (plus he was
hanging out at the drum and bass free event getting even MORE tired) and he
wanted to go and sleep for a while. Hence he came to 1015 at around
6.00-6.30am - exactly the time I got fed up and left 'cos I thought he wasn't
going to show and I start work at 8.00am.
I wish now that I had stayed, I'm sure he was spinning his usual brilliant
stuff and I missed it =( 
Fortunately I'm back in England a lot so I do get to see him play frequently
over there.
Love and light

for a while at the Boogie Buffet (sunday mornings1015 folsom) the promoter
hired  a friend with an espresso machine to come in and set up at the bar.
he made some fabulous concoctions -> mocha-oreo-lattes, torani sodas, and
just good coffee.  a totally delicious way to dance. and not a bad way to
make a living if one could afford the initial expense?

I know of many ravers that do the choclate covered coffie bean thing for that
natural buzz.  
Others use more exotic natural stimulants, such as Ma Huang, Bee Pollen,
Royal Jelly or Gensieng (my favorite), all that are legal (still).  The idea
is totally not new however, just look at the ingredents of Herbal E.  
But if I were to advise anyone on the natural kick, I'd recommend to go to
GNC and pickup the ingredents seperatly.  Such combinations of varied herbs
could have less-than-appealing results (it's less expensive as well)...

Yes, it was definately anti-drug...especially having the baby in it...I 
didn't think it was very comedic at all.  Perhaps the narrative was 
sarcastic but not comedic...subtle difference.

I've never been to a bad rave, and I don't mind that much (well...no, I
really don't) when I miss some of the best times, as I have this year.  I
look ahead, and I get the feeling that every year will bring better
parties, as people learn what works best and what people like most.  My
only concern is that prices will continue to increase, till even the most
intimate, super-underground parties cost $20+, but even that won't deter me
from spending time with my wonderful, beautiful friends and family, and
from celebrating life through dance.

Party on,

Subject: What's wrong with flyers?
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

Hey, why is it that so many people complain about being handed flyers at
parties?  It's not like that's gonna ruin the vibe or anything.
Personally, I like coming home from a party and looking over the six or
seven flyers I collected the night before.  Heck, sometimes I even pick 'em
up off the floor!  They're worth grabbing for the artwork alone, sometimes,
and a lot of creative energy goes into some of them.  You can look through
your flyers, decide which parties you want to attend, and throw the rest
away.
I save some flyers, even of parties I don't attend but that are still cool
parties, so I can mail them to Sarah A. Fleming, who wanted to flyer up a
wall in her room (anyone remember her?  She used to be on this list) with
flyers of good parties.  I know other people who like to put 'em up on
their walls, too.
How 'bout this: if you see me, and have flyers to get rid of, lay 'em on me :)

Peace, love, etc.,

  Save those flyers! Otherwise, in 20 years, you'll find yourself in an
art gallery looking at the "Original Art from 1990s Raves" exhibition,
gasping at the prices they fetch, and muttering, "Why did I throw them
away?  :<( " 
  ... not to mention that, when you're a 40 year old insurance salesperson
in Fresno, you can pull them out at look at them fondly as memories of
your wild and carefree youth.   :<)

Dear All,
                I was concerned when I saw these and other comments in
response to the recent ELECTRONIC MUSIC discussion in the Bay Guardian.
        As far as I can recall (and my memory dims as old age draws near),
the ELECTRONIC MUSIC discussion was about just that, ELECTRONIC MUSIC.
Admittedly, all of the people who took part in the discussion consider
themselves part of the 'underground scene' that you hold so dear (as most
of us were exposed to the wonders of electronic music in the same way i.e.
in the middle of a crowd, under a strobe light, and out of our minds), and,
although the 'scene' WAS discussed at the table it was not mentioned in the
article, and most definitely not 'outed'. The only reference to the 'scene'
that I saw was the boxed out club listing of 'places to hear electronic
music'.
        What was printed (admittedly misquoted in places and sorely lacking
in others) were our opinions and feelings about about a form of music that
has changed and shaped our lives for the past ten years. I don't see that
as a bad sign. We were not asked to participate as 'scions of the scene',
we were included because (as pointed out in the introduction) we are
involved in producing electronic music and running labels which specialize
in electronic music. There were some glaring omissions from the list; Jeff
Taylor from UVR, Darin Marshall and Graeme, Freaky Chakra, Single Cell
Orchestra (although now in NYC), but overall I felt that the article was
positive, and IMHO exposure of this nature is a good thing.
       In short; knowledge is power, and life (and the 'scene') is what you
make it - contradict at will.

May I throw some water on the fire?  BA is right, the web is just that, a 
web of connections.  Your ISP is not directly connected to everything on the 
web.  The URL will be resolved using data on one of a number of domain name 
servers on the 'net.  Then the connection will go through several nodes 
before hitting the address you're aiming for.  Any one part of this could 
have very heavy traffic, affecting the overall connection.  To blame it 
solely on the ISP's routers is naive at best.

>>  You certainly
>> never seemed as STUPID as you do now.

This and your other comments were not called for, including the suggestion 
the BA might use his position as the sysadmin unethically.  Calm down, 
folks; there's absolutely no need for this kind of thing.

BTW, I just finished reading "Marabou Stork Nightmares" by the same 
Irvine Welsh.  A very brutal novel but at times funny in a sick and 
pathetic way.  It's about an abused boy who grows up to be a soccer 
hooligan.  The POV is this character in a coma as his life and various 
hallucinations go through his mind.  Near the end he becomes a raver, 
learning the positive posibilties as well as limits.  Despite this 
experience, in the end his hatred for everything is turned inward on himself.

I like to look at the dj sometimes because I know a lot of them and it 
makes me smile to see my friends having a good time up there and 
enjoying themselves.  

Another thing that it seems you havent been exposed to is the shamen 
idea.  that is where the dj is a "leader" in the sense that he is helping 
ebb and flow the vibe and movement of the party.  he is the shamen.  a 
very respected position in our tribe but no means for fame or recognition 
beyond respect and love.

love drenalin

You should have gone to the CCC Goa beach party.   That was the only thing
happening as far as I'm concerned.   Full on Goa trance,  of the HARD kind,
cool atmosphere (Outside on the beach),   dancing until about 9 am,   free,
what more can you ask?   Of course,  it WAS an hour from SF down hiway 1
but it was phat...

     You could also recycle them!  =)  (instead of throwing them away)

     And that's why they bug me.  Recycling that stuff requires chemicals 
     of the funkiest caliber.  I don't mind flyers, just don't push them on 
     me.  If I think it's cool, I'll take it.  If I look at it, and I don't 
     want it, take it back.  The part that sucks is too many people who 
     just don't seem to give a shit get paid for handing x-number of them 
     out, and that's why you see them in huge piles at the end of the 
     night.  The other thing that kinda bothers me is when I'm in a great 
     space dancing with friends or zoning or whatever, and some corporate 
     butt munchkin comes up thrusting a piece of hard cardboard at me.  No 
     I've never been outright papercut or wounded, but it's distracting.
     
     I do have a wall of them at home.  And that's the part that makes me 
     sick because I only take the ones I really like (either sentimental 
     value, aesthetic value, or a damn cool lineup and I plan on going).  
     This means hundreds of them are out there somewhere, and will never be 
     put to good use.  They failed.  They didn't advertise, they weren't 
     kept, and they're floating around lost in the wind somewhere hoping to 
     get stuck to a chainlink fence in a bad part of town or rained on or 
     something.  I'm getting bummed now.
     
     I guess whatever it is; dogma, flyers, drugs, etc... the choice 
     whether I take it or not should be mine and not yours.  If you pass 
     out flyers, be cool with people who don't take them, and don't dump 
     them in big piles at the end of the night.  If you do, you really 
     suck.

yes, you are right.  it is ludicrous to subject anybody to this kind of talk 
and I apologize to the sfraves community at large for doing it.  it's not 
good for anybody -- even me -- i was awake all night agonizing over the 
exchange.

Diane Greer, I hope I answered your original question to your satisfaction.

i hear that one about fliers, the amount of work that goes into them (not 
to mention the $$$ alone) makes them all collectors items in my book. i 
keep every flier and coated my dorm room last year with them!!!  
excellent wall paper :)
			and whats up with not letting people bring them 
into big, commercial parties?  at 'plastik' they gave me SO much shit for 
bringing in fliers.... what, like i had coated them with 'lsd' or something!

Hey, old-time SFR'ers!  Anyone else experiencing deja-vu...?  Guess 
every old subject becomes new again...and we never did get the coffee thing 
going, so maybe it _is_ time to seriously discuss it again!

I'd wager that any underground would welcome a happy DIY raver who comes 
with coffee machine...as long as charges are at cost.

Hey, I'm a happy DIY raver, but my original thought was to provide the
coffee free of charge, or maybe for $0.50 a cup, since that would be
roughly half of cost.  Now, I wonder if one would be allowed entrance with
a coffee maker at the door...
Maybe we should organize an sfraves coffee collective?

Love & caffeine,

     Basically, you're screwed fellow SanJosean...
     
     Nothing worthwhile in San Jose on Tuesday.  Only weekly worth a pigs 
     butt is Velvet Shop (IMHO) and that's on Thursdays next to Toon's 
     (just moved from Agenda).  Good progessive happenin.  Everything else 
     is deep house (which I'm not a big fan of) or club type music (mumble  
     'pump up the volume' while twirling finger in martini here).
     
     Raving out of San Jose is not the ideal arrangement.  I recommend 
     writing off the week as a wash, and living LARGE on weekends.  Give me 
     a ring if you want to rideshare up to the city some weekend, or just 
     hang out.

Agreed.  That's about the only use for a $25 party (not intending to attend
it of course), one flyer can make several tape case covers!  All the pretty

waiting for the space owners to say yes, and they finally did!

    It will be in San Francisco, starting at 9pm and going until 6am 
(or possibly later). We want you to bring your best toys, smiles, and 
positive energy for this family gathering. We are limited to only 
selling 200 tickets for this party, due to the size of the space. So 
make sure you come early to ensure that you get in!

    We will have a map point at F-8 on Haight which will open at 8pm. 
The map point will stay open until all the tickets are sold. We have 
not set a ticket price yet, so call the Harmony voice mail to get more 
info. 

    We are really looking forward to seeing our family back together 
again for a night of pure, positive energy!!! Hope to see you there!!! 
Keep shinning and smiling!!! We love you!!

Peace,

Harmony

Ps. More info to follow... (yeah!!!!!!!!!)

I was also thinking of something in the iced coffee/iced espresso
genre... such a thing would be refreshing as well as stimulating.
The only problem would be logistics, ie. coolers or refrigerators,
people to distribute the actual java, etc. I don't think anyone would
be up for spending the whole night passing out coffee, but 1 hour (or
whatever) shifts could certainly be doable. An "on your honor" system
might even work, as well.

$0.50 sounds like a good price, esp. compared to the usual $3
smart drink or water price. That and the smiles it would bring 
would more than cover costs :)

Thoughts, comments, suggestions?

Steve

IMHO train-Spotting was non-judgemental when it came to drugs: it
portrayed them in a detached (and cynical) way. Despite showing the
sordid details of the heroin scene in Edinburgh, the film also showed
just how nasty alcohol can get. It also made the point that the heroin
users weren't stupid.

The scenes with the baby were deliberately ambiguous. We don't know
what killed that baby - the baby didn't look as though s/he had starved
to death.

What the film did do was invite the audience to make their own
judgements about what was going on. In England, it was criticised by
conservatives for being pro-drug because it doesn't explicitly condem
the drug use it portrays.

hey all...just back from a trip to Seattle,Victoria,VAncouver, and Banff.
Arrived to find 717 messages from SFR so I've got a a lot of reading to do..

Unlike my trip to the chicago underground a few years ago..I didn't make it
to any parties while away to report on.  I tried to see Ethan when he played
in Victoria, but the ferry wanted $80.00 to ferry the car over so I could
drive to the party...Besides Garth Brooks was in town, selling out 180,000
tickets for three nights...and it seemed that everyone in British Columbia
was trying to stay in Vancouver.   After looking for a hotel for hours, we
ended up sleeping in our car in Harrison Hot springs or the way to Banff.

However, I read in the B.C. paper about raves in Israel. Seems like
promoters are putting on "Rave" or "Moon" parties in the desert. The article
said they had brought in Domino from the UK and paid him $7,000 to spin. The
most intersting thing in the article was about the secret police, going
underground to arrest the sellers of X. They agents were bragging about
putting away sellers of X for 25 years, and possession for x and acid was
5-10years!!!!!!....FYO

                                   Good to be back...SpinSilver

I have a comment, a thought, and a suggestion regarding coffee.

comment: it sounds like a GREAT idea! :)  I am not beyond other stimulants,
but I have found that I don't like to do them at raves.  Coffee would be just
the right amount to keep awake.  It should indeed be iced, 'cause it's
usually too damn hot at raves in the first place.  That and so you don't
spill scalding coffee all over when you get bumped. 

thought:  Coffee is a diuretic (I think), and would thus promote dehydration,
especially in large amounts (and in combination with other things).

suggestion:  Where there's coffee there should be free (or _very cheap_) water
available, and the caffeine purveyor (sp?) should have a sign or something
letting people know they should drink water.  Of course free water requires
coordination with the people throwing the shindig.

Sorry if I'm wrong or worrying to much about it.

I don't go to a whole lot of raves, but I would be glad to man the
machines for an hour or so at any that I do go to.

People this Friday and we both need a ride from Santa Cruz to SF.

(but they will have to pay for these). If you are interested please call 
me at (408) 427-1666 or write me here. Thanks for reading this!  =)



May soft poofy things gently brush your face,



Ran

Oh yeah, the vehicle should be a hatchback, small pickup or have a large

someday I'll open one, at least I'll mail it back to anyone who submits a

should known before creating a masterpiece of my own?  Should all mail
viewers display the same?  Sometimes I dont understand some peoples ascii art

Sorry, I know this isn't the sfraves employment network, but Steveo needs
work or he wont be able to pay his ISP bill.

I've found quite a few, but most like DICE are strictly high tech.  The

The following folks have expressed an interest in this idea.  State you
interest now or forever hold your peace, as this potentially high-bandwidth
discussion should probably go private at this point.  Does anyone have any
suggestions from the last time this was proposed?

Steve,
	I was kinda into this a couple years ago, although I personally never
was into having a "cool sig".  Back then there were some
newsgroups (alt.ascii-art, alt.binaries.pictures.ascii) for this stuff.  
There is some pretty amazing ascii art out there.  I don't
know the newsgroups' states now, but I'm going to send out a faq from
back then, and then an example of the kind of stuff they used to post.  
So the next two msgs from me will be those.  Keep in mind the faq is from '94.
Hope you like Star Wars...  Sorry to everyone else if you don't care, I just
thought you might be interested!!

Oh, yeah, two ways they can get screwed up. 
1) Tabs - different users have different Tab values (8chars, 4chars, etc.)
   Using Tabs in ascii-art can guarantee that it might be screwed up.  Always
   use spaces.

2) The width of the art.  If your shell/viewer/whatever is 60 columns, and my
   pictures are 80, the lines are going to wrap.

3) Ah, one more.  If your viewer uses some kind of proportional font (can't
   remember what they're called, but you know, when the width of different 
   characters is different...), you will have problems.

If you like these I have more...
And I'm sure there are websites devoted to it.

-mike

   1.  What is ASCII art?

   Any image that can be sent over the net, received and immediately viewed
on any standard terminal type or communications software, and can be printed
on any printer.  This requires the image be made by using only letters,
numbers, puntuation marks and symbols such as:

               / \ | - _ + = # . , : ^ ' ` " ~ % @ < > ( ) [ ] { }

   These characters are part of the ASCII (American Standard Code for
Information Interchange) set.  This part of the ASCII set, called the
'printable' set, is used for text files, which is what is sent over the net.

   ASCII art should be viewed with a non-proportional font, also called a
'mono-spaced' font.  In other words, your software should display so many
letters per inch, regardless of the actual width of the letters.

   Most ASCII pics are viewed on a monitor that displays 80 characters
across.  But some ASCII art is wider, say, 81 to 132 characters across, and is
meant to be printed.

   Some gray scale art may look like a negative image when viewed with light
colored letters on a dark background.  This is because it is meant to be
printed with dark ink on light paper.


   2.  What are the different kinds of ASCII art?

   The first four use the standard printable set.  They are:

   o  Line drawing - Such as the light bulb above.

   o  Lettering - Large and styled, like the title "ASCII ART FAQ" above.

   o  Gray scale pictures - These create the illusion of gray shades by using
      letters for their light emitting value (assuming you are viewing light
      letters on a dark background).  Here is an example of how they break
      down by light intensity:

      Darker    .'`,^:";~
        /\      -_+<>i!lI?
       /||\     /\|()1{}[]
        ||      rcvunxzjft
       \||/     LCJUYXZO0Q
        \/      oahkbdpqwm
      Lighter   *WMB8&%$#@  (light value scale from Jorn Barger)

   Here is a gray scale pic: (from The Scarecrow)

   o  3-D images - They can be viewable by people with similar vision in both
      eyes.  You try to focus as if you are looking at the back of the
      monitor.  The image should pop into focus and create a 3-D illusion.  
      Other 3-D images are viewed by putting your nose on the monitor glass.
      For more information, see the alt.3d group.

   There are also Picture Stories, Geometric Articles, and Picture Poems.  A
Picture Story is what it sounds like, a story told with accompaning ASCII
pictures.  A Geometric Article is where text itself is formed into shapes. A
Picture Poem is a Geometric Article that is a poem.  Examples are shown at
the end of this FAQ.

   See the long version for examples.

   The other kinds of ASCII images contain 'control codes' for animation and
color.  These pics have to be processed before they can be sent over the net.
This processing changes the control codes to regular 'printable' ASCII
characters, so the pic can be sent as a text file.  This is called
'uuencoding'.  The file is processed back again after it is received.  This
is called 'uudecoding'.

   o  ASCII animations - You see an animated image produced by a sequence of
      changing ASCII pictures.  The speed will depend on the system you are
      using.  ANSI escape sequences are in the long version of this FAQ.

   o  Color - You can view color ASCII pics, if you have a color screen and
      'ANSI' color compatible software.

   Examples are in the long version of this FAQ.


   3.  How do I save, 'uudecode' and view animations and color images?

   You need to do the following if you want to save an animation or color
image from a newsreader, uudecode and view.  Type the name of the file where
I have 'FILENAME'.  On a Unix system, the process is usually as easy as:

   o  Press the 's' key while you are looking at the post in your newsreader
      (or while the message is selected in elm if it was mailed to you).

   o  Quit your newsreader (or elm) and go to where the file was saved.

   o  Type 'uudecode FILENAME'.  This may change the file's name.

   o  You may need to decompress the file if it has a suffix such as .Z or .gz
      or .zip (among others).  For .Z, type 'uncompress FILENAME' and for
      .gz, type 'gunzip FILENAME' and for .zip, type 'unzip FILENAME'.

   o  Type 'cat FILENAME' and press the return.

   To slow down an animation while viewing on your Unix host, you need to type
'cat -u FILENAME'.

   If you have uudecoded a file and downloaded it to your PC, you have
to type 'type FILENAME' and press the return to view it.  If you have
uudecoded and downloaded it to your Amiga, open a large Cli/Shell and type
'type FILENAME' and press return to view it.


   4.  How can I learn to make ASCII art?

   Unfortunately, there aren't many text books on the subject. :-)  A good
way to learn is to study how an artist has made a picture.  What characters
are chosen.  How are the characters laid out?  How is a texture made.

   You can also modify existing art.  Take a piece of art you think could be
improved.  Make a copy.  Now work on it.  When you are good at that, try to
improve a really good pic.  Then see if you can fix a damaged file.  Now take
some small pics and put them together into a big composite image.

   See question 6 for info about the file 'asciitech.aa'.


   5.  Are there any ASCII tools?

   Not many.  The Emacs editor offers some help, if you know how to use it.
Q-Edit is an ASCII editor with block cut and paste.  And TheDraw can do some
ANSI tricks but is limited by RAM size.  There are Unix and DOS scripts for
flipping an ASCII pic (like modasc by Ric Hotchkiss).  BBSdraw is available
for the Amiga.  So is CygnusEd, which allows column editing.  And there's the
TPU editor for VAX.


   6.  Where can I find ASCII art?

   You can FTP ASCII art (single pics and archives of dozens or hundreds of
images) from many sites, including these:

      ->  Host: mordor.ind.wpi.edu
          Path: pub/ascii/art/pictures
                pub/ascii/art/movies

      ->  Host: ftp.mcs.com
          Path: mcsnet.users/jorn/ascii-art
                Jorn's FTP site

      ->  Host: ftp.ncsu.edu
          Path: pub/ncsu/chking/Archive
                Chris' FTP site

      ->  Host: ftp.cs.ttu.edu
          Path: pub/asciiart/sullivan
                Steve's FTP site

      ->  Host: ftp.cs.uoregon.edu
          Path: pub/juan/Ascii
                Juan's FTP site

   The following is a gopher server:

      ->  Host: cs4sun.cs.ttu.edu
          Path: 11/Art_and_Images/ASCII

   The long version of this FAQ contains a longer list of sites.  And it
tells you which sites have animations and lineprinter art.

   If you need more technical info about ASCII art, get Jorn's file called
'asciitech.aa' in Jorn's 'ascii-art' folder at his FTP site.  His site also
has many files of ASCII art.

   Jorn and Chris' FTP sites also have the big Scarecrow's ASCII Art Archives.
The Scarecrow's archives contain hundreds of pieces of art, special sections
on sig art, bbs art, and more.

   As well as a file called the Most Often Requested Edition.  It contains
the pics that people request the most on the group.  It has pics for wishing
friends a happy birthday, Star Trek, flowers, dragons, hearts, and so on.

   There's also the long version of this FAQ (containing complete examples of
all forms af ASCII art, plus ANSI escape cods, and examples of Figlet fonts).
You'll also find the Scarecrow's files of humor, GIFs, etc. (which are listed
in the answer to the next question).


   7.  Can I get The Scarecrow's files via email?

   Yes.  If you do NOT have FTP available, you can get filos by email.

   8.  How do I make those big letters?

   You can make lettering like the above subtitle "ANSWERS" by hand, or
use a program called Figlet.  With Figlet, the letters you type are
automatically turned into big letters.  There are over 30 fonts for use with
Figlet.  Some host systems also have a program called Banner.


   9.  Where can I get Figlet?

   You can FTP Figlet from:

      ->  Host: ftp.isu.edu
          Path: pub/figlet

          This is the official site and contains the latest fonts.


   10.  How can I make gray scale pictures?

   You can make them from scratch if you are a very good ASCII artist.  An
easier way is to use a program called 'ASCGIF'.  There is also Gifscii (with
a version for the Mac), ANSIrez and GIF2ANSI for the PC.  These programs
makes an ASCII pic from any image you can convert to a GIF.


   11.  Where can I get gray scale converters?

   You can FTP ASCGIF from:

      ->  Host: usc.edu
          Path: archive/usenet/sources/comp.sources.misc/volume30/ascgif

      ->  Host: wuarchive.wustl.edu
          Path: usenet/comp.sources.misc/volume30/ascgif

      ->  Host: ftp.uu.net
          Path: usenet/comp.sources.misc/volume30/ascgif

   You can get GIF2ANSI from:

      ->   BBS: Exec-PC (414) 789-4210
                GIF2ANSI.ZIP is in the "Mahoney MS-DOS" file collection.


   12.  What is 'anti-aliasing'?

   The short, plain english explanation is that special care was taken to use
letters for their shapes.  This makes the picture or font look smoother.


   13.  How do I have my sig automatically added to my posts?

   On most Unix systems, name the file you want to be used as ".signature"
and put it in the top level of your home folder.  Your news software should
pick it up.

   If you're using elm for your mail, and elm doesn't pick up your sig, you
need to put the following in ypur elmrc:

localsignature = ~/.signature
remotesignature = ~/.signature

   If you're using vm (in emacs) for your mail, place the following in your
.emacs file, which will add the .signature file:

(setq mail-signature t)

   If you're using pine (with pico) for your mail, place the following in
your .pinerc file:

signature-file=~/.signature


   14.  How do I use an animation in my plan?

   On most Unix systems, name the file you want to be used as ".plan" and put
it in top level of your home folder.  It does not work with all finger
commands.  Putting an animation in your plan is not universally recommended.


   15.  Where can I post ASCII Art?

   You can post any of the above types of ASCII art to alt.ascii-art or to
alt.binaries.pictures.ascii groups.  To make it easier for us readers, put
one of the following identifying words at the beginning of the subject line
of your post:

     LINE - Standard ASCII line art.  Line pictures and large lettering.
      GIF - Gray scale image.
      BIG - Wider than 80 columns and-or longer than 24 lines.
ANIMATION - Animation.  Usually uuencoded.
    COLOR - Color.  Usually uuencoded.
      3-D - 3-D art.
  REQUEST - Request for a certain picture or type of picture.
   REPOST - Repost of a previously posted pic.
     TALK - Discussion, no pics included.
   BINARY - Binaries (software like Figlet and ASCGIF).

   If someone requests a picture only days after it has been posted, and you
would like to fill that request, please email the picture to the person
requesting it.  It's better than reposting so soon.

   Try to eliminate unnecessary blank space to the left of the pic.  If
you're posting a collection of pics, try to keep each pic on its own lines
(and separated from other pics by a couple of lines).  Check for tab damage.

   Most guidelines for posting apply here too.  Try to keep quoted materials
to a minimum.  One exception to the usual rules are the use of sigs.  Because
alt.ascii-art and alt.binaries.pictures.ascii are about ASCII art, it is
within the scope of the groups to post sigs.

Hey, some of us have already passed that marker, dude!  How about an
80-year old insurance agent?  Actually, I was an insurance agent when I was
18 years old!  The youngest licensed accident and health agent in the state
of California!  Now how scary is that??????

Hi all!

 A very sublime, deep and strangely beautiful party. My humblest thanks 
to the CCC crew for this. My first full on Goa party. Really loved it and 
the vibe. Not so warm and friendly but mysterious and transcedent. I 
especially loved the beggining of the music that night. It made me dance 
in very new ways; a treat I don't often encounter. Also thanks for the 
morning fruit handed out.

 BUT SPECIAL BIG THANKS TO ANARCH!!!!!!!!!!!!! Without whom I would not 
have made it to this rare and touching space. =)

kisses,


Ran

The guy to talk is Dano. He has a Tuesday night event called Fly! (tonite!)
at 111 Minna. Here's his contact information.

You may contact Dano at "inertia" <inertia@sirius.com>

Marcy and I are going down there tonite to show our support. And hopefully
we'll get a look at that mixer again, too!

apparently, much of the state of Nevada couldn't wait two more weeks, and

we needn't worry about the playa, right?  there will be nothing to burn

a friend and raver buddy of mine is going to las vegas for a week or so from 
august 26th on (crazy enough, wouldn't volunteer to spend my holidays 
there, but hey, people are different).
could you sweet ravers possibly help him out with some information on 
what's going on there, or some information on where to get information?
i know that infamous burning man thing is happening at that time, is it
somewhere near there maybe? 
grateful - ulrike

Dear All;

        Well after seeing some of the worlds best DJ's @ Spundaes Nation
like Mark Hunt, & Scot Marc Spairo from Orlando, Florida, DJ Taylor from LA,
and of course Sasha from England I thought it would be enough, but as we
were leaving 1015 a friend of mine asked me if I wanted to go to an after
party over a friend of his house.

        I was initially trying to avoid going to the End Up, because it's a
scary place, so I decided to go with my friend and just thought it was going
to be a bunch of people sitting around partying. AAAAA well it was, but we
ended up having people like DJ Taylor, DJ Scot, & DJ Mark, as well as some
of SFR's greatest DJ's in front of a very large box of records spinning new
Techno genre music for the rest of Monday & well into Tuesday day & night.
Rose, former owner of LA's Sketch Pad was also present, wow she's sooo nice.

        Wow, Wow, Wow, you think I like to have a good time, those guys
party their brains out putting me well under the table. Between the four or
five of us we had everything. It's Wedesday @ 6am and I just got up after
sleeping 24 hours, wow, wow, wow.

        All of these people are just sooooo nice, sooo down to earth with
the exception of our habits. I felt like I was back on top of Simon's
rooftop cafe, and it felt soo good. It's sooo wonderful how the music takes
you back to places and times along with how you felt back then. Did I
mention Simon's, Northeast Florida's greatest club and Techno venue, he
Simon was in the crowd. What a couple of nights indeed.

        I would just like to thank Taylor, Josh, Scot, Mark, & of course
Kevin for such a wonderful night and a rare opportunity to directly support
our world wide scene, I won't let you down Kevin, and I promise you that I
will continue being the person I am & respect you wishes, for I know no
other way to be.

Peace, Love & Thanks For A Bunch of Wonderful Nights
Brian

Dear All;

        Yes, 1015 Folsum has a dress code Saturday Night; which I am for. I
feel most ravers spend all their money on drugs, and not on clothes. Though
I agreed trendy clothes are over priced, please do not complain. This is a
rare happening, and I personally like getting dressed up, and often feel
over dressed at raves causing me to dress down. The scene needs a place for
people who take PRIDE in their appearance wearing something more than, yuk
dirty blue jeans, dirty tee shirts, a baseball cap; even if they are clean.
These people often wonder why people of sexual interest walk away from them.

Just Something To Think About
Brian

Whats up with with this shit?  This is exactly the sort of club attitude
that drove me away from clubbing 10 years ago (oops, showing my age). 

If people want to dress up, go for it. Just don't tell ME how to dress.
I just don't understand some peoples (and club owner/promoters) desire
to CONTROL others especially how one dresses.

I will never support a club/restaurant/job/etc. that has a dress code. I
would hope most people would boycott this sort of thing. Whats next... a
return  to the velvet rope and the doorman only letting in those that
look cool enough? I don't want to be a clone and I DO want to celebrate
DIVERSITY.

People who have control problems should control their OWN lives and give
everyone else a little room to be themselves...

peace,
martin

Yes, there would be a need for water.  I'm willing to help provide FREE

This all sounds great and I'm all for it, but the only thing I'd be concerned with is, well, to put it bluntly, Coffee Breath.  You usually have to stand pretty close to a person and yell in their ear to overcome the beats from the system, and if that person has been drinking coffee all night, and maybe smokin' cigs, their breath will probably be less than desirable.  Maybe a box of mints next to the coffee maker would be a good idea :)

I was also thinking of something in the iced coffee/iced espresso
genre... such a thing would be refreshing as well as stimulating.
The only problem would be logistics, ie. coolers or refrigerators,
people to distribute the actual java, etc. I don't think anyone would
be up for spending the whole night passing out coffee, but 1 hour (or
whatever) shifts could certainly be doable. An "on your honor" system
might even work, as well.

$0.50 sounds like a good price, esp. compared to the usual $3
smart drink or water price. That and the smiles it would bring 
would more than cover costs :)

Thoughts, comments, suggestions?

Coffee is just a bad vibe as far as I'm concerned. Not as bad as speed, but
similar.  That's my opinion.

> Yes, 1015 Folsum has a dress code Saturday Night; which I am for.

What do they require?

Most clubs are way too hot to wear lots of fancy clothing in,
at least if one intends to dance a lot.  One could have quite a dry
cleaning bill even if  one didn't keel over from the heat.

Dress shoes are really incompatable with dancing

> I feel most ravers spend all their money on drugs, and not on clothes.

I think most of us spend more of it on music than either of those, actually.

>The scene needs a place for people who take PRIDE in their appearance

That place is anywhere you want to be.
Most parties seem to have lots of beautiful and beautifully-dressed people
dancing.

Some of the rest may not yet have figured out what appearance they want
or how to get it.  It may not be available in a store.

If 1015 is legislating a particular appearance, it would be useful to know
what that is.

>wearing something more than, yuk dirty blue jeans, dirty tee shirts, a
baseball cap

So, just in case I happen to show up at 1015 on a Saturday night in clean,
tiedyed jeans and a tiedyed tshirt and Birkenstocks, would they let me in?

hello all-

allow me to vent for a moment.

this morning, i came out to my car, thoroughly enjoying my vacation
(especially yesterday, sarah!) and find that it's been broken into for the
second time.  gone was:
        1 backpack
        1 pager
        1 portable stereo
        a bunch of cd's
        1 dc - ac converter

all that stuff is replacable.  this stuff is not:
        1 chain with my sfraves laminates and ticket on it (why the hell did
they want that?)
        1 bag of tapes with mix tapes from friends, and tahoe tapes, and
some of my music

i can deal with replacing the big stuff, that's life in the city.  but why
did they have to take the stuff that has the memories?  at least i didn't
have christina (my guitar) or boris and natasha (computer and ricochet), or
i would most likely be out shooting people today.

thanks for letting me vent, and i'm off to find another consulting job to
replace this stuff.

i hope this teaches me that no object is worth getting this worked up over.
i still have each of the memories attached to each thing, and that they
cannot steal from me.

love to you all-

Dear Andy;

        Though I'm not absolutely sure of what the dress code is for 1015 on
a Saturday night I think it's no jeans, nice shoes(no sneakers(No Nike Air),
sandles, ...etc), however I wear my boots with the reflective strip up the
back and get it.

Peace
Brian

        I agree, so I wear cool party clothes like Pose, Lip Service(great
inexpensive vinyl clothes usually round $60 if ya shop around for a pair of
pants, I've spent much more on blue jeans & if your thin they make you feel
so hot(not temp) & sexy; vinyl clothes are just soo erotic & contrary to
popular belief are not hot), watches by Storm, Dog Pile, Hookups, Pig Pen,
everything from Verso(my fav), sunglasses by Chris Roth, Boots by Parachoe
...etc. These clothes are designed for partying/dancing.

        Not to brag, but there are nights when if you count the sunglasses,
watch and jacket, the value of these clothes can approach a $1000.

        I'm mainly talking about people who wear their tour dead shirts &
clothes from 1970. People the Dead are dead and you are sooo out of fashion,
it's not cool to not take a bath and not wash your clothes for a year. You
don't even look like a raver, you look like a clueless stoned Dead Head. I
was one and could see it if the band was still going, but it died when
Jerry(RIP) died.

>Dress shoes are really incompatable with dancing

        Get a pair of boots, or shop around and find something that looks
nice and feels comfortable. Most guys are clueless when it comes to
shopping, I personally spend the entire day walking & driving from shop to
shop to shop; from the Haight to the Castro, to downtown. Most of the time
you cannot walk into a one store and find something different or cool. There
are days when I do the above mentioned and don't buy anything.

        People have asked me if I shop in London, Paris, LA and New York and
I'm so honest I always tell them no, right here in the bay area. It feels so
good when people pay you an honest compliment.

> I feel most ravers spend all their money on drugs, and not on clothes.

        DJ's yes, but most ravers I feel no. Nice or nice expensive clothes
are of little or no value to an addicted raver. This is why I have to guard
my clothes or stick them into the check at the club or rave.

>That place is anywhere you want to be.
>Most parties seem to have lots of beautiful and beautifully-dressed people
>dancing.

        At clubs yes, at raves no.

Peace

ps People take pride in your appearance for no one else will, it's a
statement of how much you care about you, and to a lesser extent what other
people think. Once again believe in yourself, hey I'm worth clothes that
cost twice what I can afford, how bout you.

Dear Matthew;

        Sorry to hear that you stuff got stolen, but dude where do you live;
in the city. Mannnn you should know better than that guy, anytime something
like happens to me, I look at it like it's my fault. Because I know better,
why did ya leave stuff in your car, that momentary laziness will cost you
every time.

        These people who break into cars check them every night, they are
always out there. I lost a $320 pair of sunglasses and close to $400 of
other stuff, I was lazy and a fool to think that it wouldn't get stolen.
These people will trade that stuff for a $5 crack rock, even if they know
it's valuable.

        I get really annoyed at people who leave stuff in their car and it
gets stolen and they complain. You live on hostile streets, be aware and
protect yourself. Complacently will get you robbed and/or hurt/killed. Sorry
to be soo strong but hopefully you will learn a lesson from it.

        Please don't get me wrong I hate the people who do it, and the law
who does nothing about it except take a report over the phone. These people
are scum, addicted, and maybe just plain hungry, I cannot understand how
they live with themselves it is beyond me.

Peace

     I think it's financial.
     
     Maybe they figure people who dress nice are more willing to drop cash 
     for booze.  It's a little easier to imagine the well dressed pimped 
     out wondergent spending money on drinks for him ,and his potential 
     lady of the evening than somebody who just wants to get out and enjoy 
     shaking their ass to some well driven beats (you filthy grimy bums!).

     P.S.       Mysterious dress codes are still used to keep up

> Yes, 1015 Folsum has a dress code Saturday Night; which I am for.
     
What do they require?
     
Most clubs are way too hot to wear lots of fancy clothing in,
at least if one intends to dance a lot.  One could have quite a dry 
cleaning bill even if  one didn't keel over from the heat.
     
Dress shoes are really incompatable with dancing
     
> I feel most ravers spend all their money on drugs, and not on clothes.
     
I think most of us spend more of it on music than either of those, actually.
     
>The scene needs a place for people who take PRIDE in their appearance
     
That place is anywhere you want to be.
Most parties seem to have lots of beautiful and beautifully-dressed people 
dancing.
     
Some of the rest may not yet have figured out what appearance they want 
or how to get it.  It may not be available in a store.
     
If 1015 is legislating a particular appearance, it would be useful to know 
what that is.
     
>wearing something more than, yuk dirty blue jeans, dirty tee shirts, a 
baseball cap
     
So, just in case I happen to show up at 1015 on a Saturday night in clean, 
tiedyed jeans and a tiedyed tshirt and Birkenstocks, would they let me in?

Ooo...POSE!  How cool...I'm happy that you have so much money and time
and energy to spend (I would say WASTE) on your clothes.  I would rather
spend my time, money and energy on something else, one example being
music.  Whether it's practicing my singing, playing sitar, 
going to a show, a rave, etc...I really dig nice clothes too, but 
I usually would rather spend $35, say, on burning man, than on a 
pair of cool Pose(r) socks.  Myself, I would feel pretty stupid 
wasting 1000 dollars on clothes,even if I did have it
(I work at the VA--not likely!)
I guess it just depends on what you think is important...your inside, 
or your outside. I prefer to hang out with people who are beautiful.  
It doesn't have anything to do with what they wear.  It has to do 
with their energy (I guess you don't understand that yet).  
They could be naked, scarred, conventionally "ugly"...wear clothes 
from 1812...I really don't care. I find that people who are all 
caught up in their appearance are generally shallow, stupid, boring, 
petty, etc...of course this is all just MHO, but hell, you're 
spoutin' off yours, so I feel free to do the same...

I don't doubt that you "were" clueless and stoned.  DeadHead, I doubt. If
you knew anything about the Dead you would know that the music never
stops...it has taken new and exciting forms, but that's off topic...
I go to raves to dance to great music, meet cool people (not their cool
clothes), and generally have a good time.  I wear what I feel comfortable
in (which is actually not dirty tour shirts.  and yes, i take a bath every
day...I'm aquarius, I can't bring myself out of water!)
It's not a huge issue for me.  It wouldn't even be an issue now,
except you are trying to pass judgement on people who don't dress and
think about clothes the way you do.  Get a clue!  If dirty tour shirts 
bother you, don't talk to people who have them on.  I certainly am not
going to talk to someone who is preening about at a rave, concerned more
with what he/she is wearing than even being there, really.  Not that I
mind well-dressed individuals...but I do mind when those individuals tell
me what MY priorities should be in life.

That's your own issue...you're all caught up in the "look" scene, the
"material" scene, so you're going to have to deal with the "paranoia"
scene too..."they want what I have, so I'm going to have to GUARD my
STUFF!!!"  Obviously we don't live in a perfect world; unfortunately the
majority of people have to deal with stuff getting stolen because wealth
is not distributed evenly, and MONEY and THINGS have become more
important than LOVE and THE PERSON HIM/HERSELF...

<sigh>

Ok, enough venting for one post.  Flame away...

Just curious, why do you feel that way? To me, coffee has always meant
happy times with friends engaged in good conversation. no bad vibes there.

Dear You;

        Please don't tell me that I was judging people because that wasn't
my intention so please don't stick words in my mouth. I love everyone and
will hang out with a bum on da street as well as someone who's dressed nice
for the record.

        You never bothered to ask me what my intentions where behind the
post, so I guess I just have to say them. My intentions where to support
people in making their personal appearance shine and stand out, dressing
nice is but one way to do that.

        Why did you assume negativity, I was trying to help others be more
than they are.

Peace
Brian

It's better than paying $1000 for an outfit.  In my opinion ofcourse.

Rick, I think many will disagree with this statement.  Coffee has been a

So what exactly does it mean to "look like a raver"? I thought this
scene was about freedom of expression. As far as I'm concerned, the
only way to be out of fashion is to compromise your own fashion for
someone else. Clothing should be a statement of who you are as an
individual, not of how well you fit into a "scene". Everyone's got
something different going on upstairs, so let's dress just like it and
stop the sneering.

a happy message as I iron my kilt,

Steve

of course you were judging people. no one needs to stick words in your
mouth, you've already thoughtfully provided them:

>>        I'm mainly talking about people who wear their tour dead shirts &

You're gonna have a helluva time trying to pass remarks like that off as
"loving" and "supportive," big guy.

while insulting everyone else because they don't look like a "raver?" I
don't think anyone felt it necessary to ask you intentions because THEY'RE
PRETTY FUCKIN' OBVIOUS.

this is my first and last post on the subject; sorry for taking up
bandwidth but this kind of shit really bugz.

Dear Brian:
Hon, I have enough money, and if I wanted more, I could easily get it.
Obviously you didn't read through my post.  Money and clothes are not
the end-all and be-all of my life.  What you don't understand is that
for many people (including people on this list who have corresponded to
me and are not taking the time to respond to your posts) is that wearing
$1000 of clothes, or worrying about what they wear, has nothing to do
with how they feel about themselves.  It has to do with what they do with
their life, not what they wear.  I appreciate that you are trying to make
people feel better about themselves, but maybe you should face the fact
that many people are not as insecure as you and don't need clothes to
make them feel cool.

obviously, you and I have differences on what we think is important to
the rave scene.  let's just leave it at that.

Dear You;

        Please don't tell me that I was judging people because that wasn't
my intention so please don't stick words in my mouth. I love everyone and
will hang out with a bum on da street as well as someone who's dressed nice
for the record.

        You never bothered to ask me what my intentions where behind the
post, so I guess I just have to say them. My intentions where to support
people in making their personal appearance shine and stand out, dressing
nice is but one way to do that.

        Why did you assume negativity, I was trying to help others be more
than they are.

Peace
Brian

Brian,

FYI regardless of your intentions your post did come across as quite
infalmatory to more than just Shamini.  And its the actions/words we
must base our initial reactions on *not* what someone claims they
intended after the fact.  You make a public statement and you'll get
reactions based on it--don't expect everybody to ask you what yopu
really meant before replying publicly.

Oh, and nice/expensive/trandy/whatever clothes DON'T make someone "more
than they are".  And re-read your original post, you were judging people.

On the subject, I like seeing people dressed outrageously, attractively,
or whatever but I don't condem others for dressing any other way.

Dear Tim & All

        Yes, they do when we decide whether or not to associate with a given
individual we first see the person, unless we are blind. How they appear to
us is the first part of the equation; different people weight it very
differently. If you smell or look out of place your ability to attract/repel
another is definitely lessen/increased by the later. To say that it isn't
your just lying to yourself. 

        I feel like I'm apologizing for something I didn't do; insult
people. If you were dressed like I mentioned in the previous post, and you
walked up to me at a rave or a club and asked me my opinion; as a friend i
would tell you that I thought you either smelled if you did, and/or looked
out of place. I wouldn't lie to you and say, yeah man you look like the
shit, because that wouldn't be honest.

        I'm sorry if I offended anyone, but again it wasn't my intention,
maybe you shouldn't be so insecure. If you were offended and you say you
feel good about the way you dress, what's the difference what I say,
especially since you feel I don't have a clue; for in the end it only
matters what you think. So a so called attack from me shouldn't bother you
in the least, right.

Peace
Brian

My oh my, what a thread (no pun intended)! Here's my $0.02, for what
it's worth:

Dress codes are very elitist, and are totally contrary to the rave
scene. As far as I'm concerned, clubs that impose standards on what
one wears are way too concerned with asthetics. I've been denied
entrance to clubs in the past for wearing jeans or sneakers. OTOH,
when I lived in New York City, I visited clubs where my date and I got
to bypass the line, and enter -- purely because of our appearance.
Whenever this happens, I choose to not go to those places again --
in both cases, the attitude of the club owners and employees just
bothered me too much.

Last year, on my birthday, my (now ex) girlfriend was denied
entrance at the Palace in Sunnyvale because she had a two-piece outfit
on. It didn't matter that she had a mere 1" of midriff showing. It
didn't matter that many other ladies entering the club were wearing
far more provocotive and revealing outfits than she. They had a hard
and fast rule, which, as the manager put it, was "to promote having a
certain clientelle at our club." And she had the audacity to turn us
away, on my birthday! Needless to say, I never have ventured near that
place again.

When I first went to raves, I dressed up for them. I also noticed that
I was paying a lot of attention to how I looked, and was concerned
over the care of my clothes (silk shirt, linen dress pants, leather
jacket), etc. All that took my attention away from the people there.
Nowadays, while I still like to look somewhat fashionable, I dress in
more comfortable and casual clothes, and focus more energy on all
those smiling faces.

PLUR,
E. Nygma	(masquarading as George -- this sendmail configuration on
		shellx.best.com really sucks!)

P.S. I love the variety of fashion in our scene. Let's keep it diverse.

hello all-

i'm going to speak my opinion now.  flame me privately, and keep it off the
list, as flames should be.

i've been on sfraves long enough to know that the positivity and negativity
ebb and flow dependant upon many factors that we don't understand.  but
nonetheless, there are months of nothing but positivity, followed by intense
bursts of flame war after flame war after flame war.

i need to ask if something can be done: can we take flame wars private as
soon as they neither benefit the bystandards nor relate to raving (what this
list is ostensibly about?)

i am the first to admit that about 95% of my posts are off topic.  but i am
also first to admit that i make every attempt that 95% of my posts are
positive in some way, and if they are not, they are done privately.

yes, within any family, there are good and bad times, but i am of the belief
that, for our own collective mental health, we should make every attempt to
let positivity outshine?  that does not mean smoothing over negative issues
as has been suggested; rather, it means to approach issues with... i'm
starting to preach here, and won't subject you to that.  i have made my point.

love to you all, and may you have a good day.  i will see some of you at
wish tonight.

love-

matt

Dear All;

        I would be happy and thrilled to discuss this over the phone with
anyone who feels strongly about my fashion SUGGESTIONS; by home number is
510-595-7988. I still stand behind what I said, and am willing to explain
myself; however since I'm being misunderstood via e-mail due to my lack of
ability to communicate using the written word I will not respond to people
using the e-mail format. You have my number I would love to talk to you, a
filter is already setup to trash incoming mail, once again sorry I was just
stating my opinion and it was clearly misunderstood. Once again sorry if I
offended you it was not my intention; hey I feel really good and am
sincerely in a wonderful and blissful mood.

Peace
Brian

Seems to me you should be taking your own advice, Brian... why are you
bothering to respond to all these people?  What's the difference what
they say?  Maybe _you_ shouldn't be so insecure.

Seems to me that comfort should be one's primary concern when dressing for
a rave.  You want to wear something that will allow you dance and jump
around in comfort.  You must expect to get dirty in some way, and would do
well to select your threads accordingly.

Till we all rave naked,

My question is - why do you san francisco people leave *anything* in your 
car?!?!  When I move there, I plan on having nothing in my car.  I've 
heard too many stories about break ins.  Like you said, that's life in 
the city.  Sorry for your loss, Matt.  You know what to do next time...

     Greetings Wonderful People,
     
     I wear comfy clothes to raves because they feel good.  Some wear funky 
     clothes because they like them.  Some wear gnarly vinyl and monkey 
     boots because it feels good.  If I saw all vinyl at a rave, I would 
     puke.  If I saw all cereal box shirts I would puke.  If I saw all tye 
     dies, I would puke as well.
     
     Stop roasting each other's most beautiful attributes!!!  We're all 
     assholes in charming, unique and different ways if you dig long enough 
     to find out.  I like looking out and seeing people 16 to 60 freaking 
     out having a good time, and looking like they came from all over the 
     place to be here.
     
     I know this doesn't seem like such a big deal, but it's gotta be 
     said...
     
     Embrace diversity or we're going to end up just like everybody else.
     
     Love,
     AndyW
     
     P.S.       Sorry my gateway is rather slow, so if somebody already 
     said this I'm just agreeing...

If you went back and did research, I think you might find at least one or
two very understandable factors that lead to many flame wars... ;^)

Positive or negative, I really wish this list contained more rave related
topics.  I'm really not on it to be part of a social/support group, but
rather to (hopefully) exchange ideas and information pertaining to the Bay
Area Rave Scene.

With all due respect (for I certainly love an occassiona NRR =), even if
100% of a person's posts are positive, if they aren't rave related to some
degree, at some point, then they are misdirected...

So the question is then, do you want to be with people who are repelled by 
sneakers?  (and since when did the idea that someone smells bad 
get associated with casual dressing?)  As I understand it, we are talking
about someone who can get into a rave and not a club by their dress...

Who are you to tell people that they are out of place?  If, 'as a friend',
you feel that you have this right, then I'm sorry, but you are in fact
insulting people.  You are also judging them, something you have been
denying doing for several messages now.

This is true, but I don't think that I am responding to this issue because
of any insecurity.  I feel that you are taking on an attitude that judges
people, and your claiming that it is based on trying to help these poor
people who don't wear the right self-respecting clothing bothers me.
I thought one of the things we were achieving with the whole rave movement
is simply letting people go out and have fun in whatever form they choose,
and accepting their choice as one of the many raindrops of life.

anyway... what's a beautiful day without a bit of a storm.

Hello fellow ravers,

 Well, for the record (whose record? Nobody's ! I just like typing...) I'd
have to say I used to do the rave getup back in 92-93'.  You know, funny
hats, Bert 'n' Ernie - type shirts, anything plastikey.. But I came to
several realizations in the past years, these are:
       - The merging-into-society factor turns to nil if your trying to
escape from a busted underground.
       - The police jackability factor goes way up when your driving in the
wee hrs of the morning with such clothes on.
       - My dancing style turns my clothes into a sog stained mess,
regardless what im wearing...
       - I like dancing shirtless anyways.

But the main reason is...  

                  When I dress up nicely, I have to keep beating all the
ladies off me with a 4ft kendo bokken...


                             (ok, I lied.  But hey, we all get to dream big,
right?)

Allthough there is some validity to Brian's statement in that since my change
of clothing style 3 yrs ago, (now I wear mostly black, ang greys) I can count
the number of people actually walking up to me and socializing on one hand.
which, in a way, isn't that bad since thoses that do chat with me I tend to
keep at true and honored friends...


"Dance with me..."

Adam

Oohh... another opion I agree with.  What would be fun about a room filled
with 200 uncomfortable people looking like they were cloned from an original
pair of club goers.  I'd miss being able to show off a sexy stomach.  the
boycott starts right here.   JUST SAY NO TO DRESS CODES.

I agree with Tony *completely*.

It seems that about 1 in 10 or maybe even 1 in 15 messages on this list
actually have to do with

  "Raving, the culture music and activities"

-- which would ideally include directly relavent posting related to
upcoming party info, party reviews, music and DJ info and reviews.

Rather most of the messages on this list for some time seem to have mostly
to do with

  "Raving, a 12-step support group"

I really wish there were a digested or moderated form of SFR that contained
only rave and rave culture information. I really don't care if that means
that it's dry and lacking character if that also means that the information
ratio increases. I like information. Unfortunately, it seems that the
internet is containing more and more content daily but the
content/information ratio is sinking like a dropped anchor, down, down,
down...

Until then, it's just filter SFR and all the other rave-lists that I
subscribe tointo their very own virtual dumpsters and I read them when I
have time to kill.

Friends, I don't know exactly how to say this with just the right tone,
but something needs to be said.  I've known Brian Darkness since he started
posting to sf-raves.  He's had his moments (don't we all), but on the whole
I'm glad he's around.  

The incessant string of posts from him today is a  whole nuther matter.
Berating styles of dress, putting down Deadheads, bragging about wearing
expensive brand-name clothing.  This is frontin', and I'm not saying
anything here I haven't already said to him in person in email.

The final clue is that he's turned off incoming email.  

I think this is not the time for flaming or getting all upset.  Whatever
it was that started this, let it work its way through.  Brian, I hope you
come on back when you've had enough riding on the high horse.  

I just don't think being argumentative with Brian is going to do any good
right now, especially since he's shut off email contact.

Wish I knew a more diplomatic way to deal with this . . . but there it is.

peace out
phred

To The People Who Flamed Me(With The Exception Of Those I Successfully
Clarified My Position With):

       I offered you the opportunity to discuss your strong, insulting,
insinuating comments & feelings over the phone with me. It's been over 2.5
hours now and only one person had the guts to get back with me. If you felt
so strongly about it; why didn't you call me, what better way to resolve
this situation, huh.

        No, but you would rather cause chaos, & negativity on this list
because that's all your about and all you have to offer. I despise who and
what you are, you fake your feelings just to cause trouble and try and make
others feel bad so you can feel good, or just feel some thing. You twist
peoples words just to get a rise out of them, & I'm an easy target for that.
To say there aren't people on this list who regularly do that, is wrong
because we have a lot of them.

        If you believed in what you wrote you would call me, I feel that you
are just gut-less cowards hiding like children behind your terminals;
waiting like vultures to prey and twist anything anyone states. I honestly
hate you, and if I see you out on the scene I will be happy to just walk
away from you, this is the only time I've ever snubbed anyone or ever will.
You know nothing about peace, love, friendship, honesty and what it is to
help another.

        MEAN, HEARTLESS, JEALOUS PEOPLE LIKE YOU SUCK

        People who know me, know just what kind of person I am; a good one
who has no hate for anyone on the planet except people like you.

        I sincerely apologize to anyone who unnecessarily has to read this,
this will be my last post on this topic, and I will not offer anyone, any
suggestion on anything.

Sincerely
Brian

Hi all,

Now that the bullets have stopped flying over, I can come out of hiding
and ask a RR question (for a change!);

What is that record that has the lyrics: "acid funk" repeated over and
over again? Is it by the hardkiss bros? Anybody know about title, artist,
lable, availability (on CD? I left my turntable back home in Holland).
I love records with very deep dark voices on them (anybody know "Black
out" with the bible text, and "Rise up from your grave"?).

The Frying Dutchman.

P.S. Hi Thomas, it was great meeting you at Carl Cox/Nikita, I'm sorry
we sort of lost each other at the end of the evening, but then again
I saw very little of any of the people I got there with in the first
place, I guess it was one of those nights... (and very crowded).

I believe it is a Hardkiss record that is available at Soundworks in
SF or you might wanna try Solid Grooves in SJ...I THINK it has a 
picture of a skull made out of naked bodies on the the cover, make 
sure you listen to it first though!

Maybe that's it.  If one is not thin, one may require leather or silk to
get the same effect.

They're doing pretty well if they can still fit into their clothes from 1970.

I don't particularly care about being fashionable.  Tiedyes were so
out-of-fashion
a number of years ago that I had to make my own.  I still do.

When I can get the right materials, I will make myself an outfit of tiedyed
leather.
Could this be a new fashion trend waiting to be born? ;^)

>Nice or nice expensive clothes are of little or no value to an addicted
raver....

You are absolutely right!  They just get all grungy and sticky, and if they are
as fragile as a lot of fancy clothing, probably torn as well.  We are all
addicted
to DANCING.

I was way wrong on this off-topic stuff.

This 1015 on a Saturday Night thread is just killing me.

I feel like I am watching "battle of the rave kidz<tm>" on Geraldo.

Keep it up, after reading this stuff, I gotta admit that there's more
entertainment on my internet connection than my cable TV.

ps: Brian D. and I own the same style of Lip Service black vinyl pants, and
I have gotten nothing but compliments on them when I have worn them out to
parties. Comments? :-)

OH MY GOD!!!! CALL THE MARINES!!!!! There are kids dancing around (off the
streets) having fun and loving eachother. It's hell out there boys and the
MAN knows it. See, the MAN wants us all to be like ultra-violent. He wants
us to kill for our country, he wants us to be a bunch of assholes! Don't
listen to them, that's not very cool.\
     Anyway, pretty stupid to stop something thats doing some sort of good
for people. Better than cruisin the strip all stoned to hell, or sitting at
home being all lazy and fat. Get up and dance people. We need some
polititions on our side. Anyone know how to spike the water system???? E, E,
E, E, . . . 

 Happy government, good government.

Yeah I'm gone. . . 

Luv Yall,

Yknow, I usually have to go alone cuz none of my friends don't dance. It was
one of the best times I've had, but I wish I had a friend to share it with.
     I have to warn you though, one minute you're doin your thing, boogying
down, and the next minute, some drunk off her ass chick starts rubbin up
against you and pulling her skirt up n all. Just warning you of some of the
dangers. Be safe! Carry anti-drunk off their ass, It's a people repellant
available in most stores near those lovely towns of Strawberry,
Jingerdingle, and Pumgernipple. 

At least I was serious for a minute, I'm gettin better.

Mail me if you need someone to go with sometime. I live in San Lorenzo.

I am not dancing naked. Unless its at a spa place or something. But most of
these places are just nasty, it's bad enough sitting on the floor with
clothes on.

I didn't go to nation for some reasons, and I didn't read all my mail yet so
don't get all upset if you've heard this 10000000000 times before.
   I kept hearing rumors about how there was going to be a Ravve documentary
filmed at Nation, and also a music video, and something else. Was this true?
If so, do you guys think that it would be negative publicity? They did
documentaries on Skateboarding, BMX, and other not so known sports and that
didn't really hurt them. But of coarse, raving is something that is looked
up upon among high school kids and most other people. I'm kinda afraid that
soon if these things happen, there won't be any parties worth going to anymore.
    I think that with all these new people, will come a new scene, vibe,
aura, and atmosphere. Everything could evolve into just another preppy drug
orgy. That's what basically most people think raves are about. Everyone I
know that don't rave think it's ll just a bunch of drugged out kids. They
think that they'll see sex everywhere because of the "E" rumors.
    People just don't know very much at all. I know I'm worrying a bit too
much, but, this is a fairly big deal were involved with, big money, tons of
people. I bet WILD 107, LIVE 105, KOME, and KMEL will be having their own
raves soon. When that happens, I'll just have to have my own, you all will
be invited. Old house music, old rave music, new rave music, and fresh dj's,
but older ones too. And a list of people who aren't allowed to enter. Dream
come true eh??? It'll happen.

Keep it alive!

Well, friends, that is were the concepts of sharing and unity come into
play. If you want to sit down, just find a volunteer to go first and
the rest of us can sit on his/her naked body/clothes.  ;-)

	often the dress codes are gang related.

I just wanted everyone to know how much I enjoyed the free Jungle party on
Sunday. The mission rock was a great place to have it, and the crowd really
blew me away. The dancefloor was PACKED and the atmosphere was really
friendly. Raymond Roker (URB) spun a pretty good set..most of his mixing
was excellent..his mellow style lost some of the crowd, though.  I like the
mellower side, but not at 11pm. Another DJ who I didn't know was on next,
but you could tell as soon as Bukem hit the decks. Having heard Jungle in
London last year, I can honestly say that the British have a special knack
for it (it's their music after all). There's some good american Jungle
DJ's, but the way Bukem dropped those bombs...it was truly a thrill.
Oh..and being a free party didn't hurt either:)

     ==============================================
     Well, friends, that is were the concepts of sharing and unity come 
     into play. If you want to sit down, just find a volunteer to go first 
     and the rest of us can sit on his/her naked body/clothes.  ;-)
     
     The Frying Dutchman
     =============================================
     
     
     I'll bring the 'Slip and Slide' if somebody else brings the DJ's and 
     the audio gear!
     
     
     
     So I'm writing this^ and I think, wait that could be really nifty.  
     Maybe not naked, but bathing suits or something... and then I got this 
     vision that we could throw a festive at a water park like Raging 
     Waters and have it go into the evening.  And then the Bosch-like 
     nightmare started... (you should be getting that 'starting a dream 
     sequence' wavering on your monitor now)
     
     The chill wading pool
     ---------------------
     Lots of people on GHB groping one another in a state of body buzz 
     bliss.  Lifeguards working overtime to keep people from bobbing their 
     heads underwater.  One kid starts bad tripping, screaming "there's 
     water all over me".  Poor sod... another poor raver is crying because 
     their Elmo got all wet, and doesn't feel quite right anymore.
     
     The Main Pool
     -------------
     Three foot waves make consistent audio impossible (Boom Boom Gurgle 
     Gulr-oom Boom Boom).  DJ getting pissed because splashes are getting 
     the mixer and vinyl wet.  Speakers hanging from above, water is 
     killing the bass.  Raging, but the water is making everybody tired.  
     Bike lights are shorting out everywhere, but glowsticks are going 
     strong.  Everybody on E is getting stomach cramps from drinking the 
     pool water.  Ravers wearing vinyl don't notice the difference between 
     this and a "normal" rave, <bless their waterproof souls!>   ;)   
     
     Hardcore Trance
     ---------------
     Hundreds of people running into each other as they get disoriented 
     after the combination of splashing water and strobe lights.  Nobody on 
     any drug whatsoever can tolerate it, but in the melee to get out, more 
     splashing occurs.  The scene only gets worse from there.  Eventually 
     in the interest of public safety, the promoters make this chill pool 
     number two.
     
     Drum and Bass/Dub Room
     ----------------------
     Occasional splashes of water killing spliffs left and right.  
     Outbursts of Jungle causing severe problems as water keeps splashing 
     out of pool onto the mellow Dubbers trying to get their hookah started 
     up.
     
     Other Areas
     -----------
     A small group keep alternatingly jumping into the jacuzzi and coldest 
     pool around while giggling like crazy.  Others wading around picking 
     wet flyers out of the various pool and building a large 'flyer mache' 
     artform shaped like the mound from 'Close Encounters' near one of the 
     DJs.
     
     Cops come and Threaten to Shut Off Water... and Power.
     
     As the gents walking back to their cars, some realize what an awesome 
     synergic effect cold, water AND *X* have on their manly dimensions.
     
     Everybody goes to 1015 folsum and gets pissed because bathing suits, 
     beach towels and flojos don't qualify for the dress code.
     
     And then I wake up.
     
     Hope I'll see some of you this weekend... if I can get out of this 
     cooking hell hole!!!!
     "San Jose, it's hotter than you think"
     
     Loving You!

After these messages, we'll be right back! Actually what you wrote below
is not a dream. We used to have "indoor-tropical-swim-paradise" parties
in Holland (the climate does not often allow outdoor events) where people
were indeed partying in their bading suits, swimming etc. You just put
everything you don't want to get wet in a locker and off you go. Sadly,
these events lost their appeal (although I never went there myself, often
too commercial for my taste) after a girl was raped at one of them...
Now back to our feature persentation:

Sorry for filling your mailbox, but these connections are a part of the
beauty of the sfraves list:

Someone named Tiffany (address on Cc above) just wrote to me about the
history of raves (doing a masters thesis on house music) but her return
address turned out to be invalid, so I can't return her mail.

On the outside chance that Tiffany is on this list, try again, with a
better return address. Or if anyone else has a guess who this is, let me
know.

Thanks!

Richard

All I know is that I draw the line at places where the mini-backpack per

Aha, Thanks for the clue. That post from the no-longer-home Tiffany
was received Aug 19 but the header read

So are lost posts to hyperreal suddenly becoming disloged? Unstuck in
time? Twilight zone?

I guess I have to jump on the bandwagon here.  What do you mean "look out 
of place?"  Are you implying that there is only one way to look i.e. "in 
place", and that's the way to go.  I don't buy that.  Why don't we work

I believe you're close.  Just as people on this list sometimes
complain about a "gangsta factor" judging by the age and dress of
partygoers, so nightclub promoters wish to limit the "street" look of
their patrons with a dress code.  It's more for appearance, of course
real gangsters aren't going to be kept out.  I remember being told to
take off my baseball cap while in the Sound Factory, but I just stuck
it in my pocket until security passed.

There is always a comfort level when it comes to dress.  Just as
someone wearing a suit would feel self-conscious at a rave, I would
feel strange if overdressed (too clubby) or underdressed (grubby
sweats) at a party.  It is good that there are places to go where
people can wear Armani suits or vinyl pants and feel special but not
like a total weirdo.  Although it is fun to wear attention-getting
clothes, there are few places (Burning Man) where one is encouraged to
be strange/jarring/out-of-place looking.  But we were talking about
shoes.  As far as the no tennies policy, that would be conducive to
reducing the street factor; however, dress shoes are just way to
uncomfortable for dancing.  I haven't found any kind of non-gym shoes
that are conducive to dancing.  And Brian, remember one thing:  some
gym shoes are very stylish, beautiful, and colorful, if not dressy.
So those wearing the fabulous platform vinyl Adidas would be left
outside the club.

Hi all!

 Well as some of you may have heard, Dionysus Dreams will be helping out 
the Beautiful People party this friday. Sad to say I will not be doing 
any audio creation but I do promise the best visual enhancement I can 
muster up. Any of you who would like to help make this interactive by 
playing with my toys during the party are welcome to do so - do please ask 
first and let me show you the knobs, buttons and whatnot. Anyone with a 
slide tray of slides they would like to show should email so we can talk.

warm embraces yall,


Ran

bart. take bart to the city, party all night and get back on in the
morning. or better yet, stay the day and find yourself a place to live,
and i mean live. sorry, my disdain for fremont is personal, as i had
the unfortunate experience of spending most of my adolescence there. i
shudder at the thought. but it's not all bad really. i've always thought
someone should load their gear in a truck and we rave on top of mission
peak on a full moon night in winter.

as far as raving in fremont goes. ha! the cops there would give up
even a freshly baked jelly to bust a rave.

	right.  no problem.

	though i do know this is more than close, i know people

I really hope to see some of you guys that I met at F&F, and hopefully meet
more of you out there!!


See you there  :-)

Yeah, we can all dry hump to Joe Rice's set. It surely inspires Joe :-).

See "So you want to be a chill room DJ" article in the SFR archives and in
XLR8R for more info on other chill-room-fun.

They obviously have a Macintosh with a reset clock. 1904 was the
giveaway... in Mac 'history' Jan 1, 1904 12:00am is the beginning of the
world. Ask them if they removed their battery about 19 days before sending
that email.

Some people actually threw a party at a waterslide place in San Jose about
4 years ago.  I think it was called Creation.  Anybody remember it?  It was

I wasn't there, but there were at least some undercover cops at
that one who knew what to think, according to all those who got
busted on various drug possession charges.  - Lee

Get a pair of regular Doc Martin leather shoes.  The sole is patent air

Precedence: bulk

Okay.

This has been said many times before, but I will say it again. 
 
WHY ARE 90% OF ALL THE POSTS ON THIS LIST MEANINGLESS BULLSHIT?

Please let me define "MEANINGLESS BULLSHIT:"
Clothes, blah, blah, movies, blah, blah, I flame you, you flame me, blah, blah, "Hey everybody!  Just wanted to say that I'm studying right now!"

WHY WASTE BANDWIDTH WITH THIS????  Ever heard of PRIVATE e-mail???

I don't think it would upset me as much as it does if people would do two things:

#1. THINK BEFORE YOU POST.
Ask yourself "Do the other 1000+ recipients REALLY need to know what I am about to shoot off into e-mail land?  It is pertinent -SFRAVES- information that people will find at least SOMEWHAT beneficial, informative, or entertaining?  Or is it just plain BLAH that people REALLY don't need to know about?"  This is where NRR comes into play - even though we really shouldn't HAVE to have this classification, because this is a RAVE RELATED e-mail list, but apparently people just can't seem to grasp that, so we have a tag for this sort of thing: NRR.  EVERYBODY KNOWS THIS TOO.

(and if you absolutely MUST post your non-rave post...)

#2. PUT A TOPIC IN YOUR HEADER.
Here are a few (among SO many) examples of posts that DO NOT CUT IT in this aspect: "Check this out!"  "Hi!"  "Wow"  "Cool!"  "Read this..."  ETC.  I'm sure you get the picture.  How is anybody supposed to tell what is inside a post such as the above described?  The only way is of course to open it up and read it.  Now, A LOT of e-mail comes in through SFRAVES, EVERYBODY in this list knows that.  So, for people like myself (and many, MANY others) it gets VERY TEDIOUS to weed through all of the untitled posts throughout the day just to try to find something of content.  It is really very simple, and I fail to see what is so hard about doing this.  This has been said, asked, requested and BEGGED before, but PEOPLE STILL DO IT.  I find it VERY inconsiderate and rude.  Especially for people that work jobs where REAL, WORK-RELATED e-mail comes in on the same program,  and you have to swim through bullshit to get to it.

PLEASE, PEOPLE!!

One last thing.  Doesn't anybody have anything BETTER to with their time besides talk back and forth about such topics?  I mean COME ON!  I know some people are at work, and have to entertain themselves somehow, but USE A LITTLE IMAGINATION HERE.  I am not in any way trying to insult anyone, but I just think that we are all very intelligent people, and we can do more with our minds besides GAB.  The rave scene/movement is a very advanced, creative, technological, spiritual thing.  SFRAVES - *RAVES*, right?  But most of the time when I am reading the posts on here, I feel like I'm stuck in a really bad episode of SAVED BY THE BELL or something.  

Disclaimer:  I am completely aware that with this post I have probably started FLAME FEST 96, but I really don't care.  The only reason I just don't unsubscribe is simply this:

THERE IS ACTUAL **RAVE-RELATED INFORMATION** ON THIS LIST - THAT IS WHY IT WAS STARTED.  I FIND THIS INFORMATION BENEFICIAL, AS DO OTHERS.  PLAIN AND SIMPLE.

Sorry for rubbing anybody the wrong way, and please everyone, be CONSIDERATE of the other 1000+ recipients on this list - YOU ARE NOT THE ONLY ONE.  YOU AND 10 FRIENDS ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES.  There are A LOT of people one here.  Respect everyone, please.

I wanted to say thank you to everyone on SFRaves for providing
endless entertainment these past 4 years...  I'm leaving for England
next Wednesday, so I have to vnsvb for the time being.  I'll be
back soon, but we all know how many messages flow through this
group  =)  (I've made the mistake of going home for the summer,
not checking my mail for a month or so, and then being over
my quota by a couple of megs...)

If anybody has any suggestions of places to visit, (pubs, clubs,
outdoor gatherings, record shops, beautiful towns/villages, etc...)
please feel free to email them to me.  After Friday I'll have 
limited access to my email.  But, I should be able to check it 
one last time (Tuesday night) before I leave...

Also, if for some reason this address  elmo@cats.ucsc.edu  should
stop working, I also have an account at  elmo@cloudfactory.org
that will work...  I'll hopefully be able to check both from time
to time, if I find any computer terminals in London...

I hope everyone has fun at Burning Man, the Cloud Factory camping
Trip, the Harmony 3 Year Finale, and any other parties that will
be going on while I'm away...

hugs and smiles-

Here's what Jason Green might call a really lame post, but I wanted to
express it anyway.  I found this on the Web, and wanted to send it from my
heart to yours.  Hope you enjoy:

We Have Always Known

Our souls entwined, eternally
Journeying onward, reaching for forever
Searching for what we have always known

Crawling blindly, we stumble into one another
Feeling, talking, discovering
Learning what we have always known

Lights appear to guide us
Our paths exposed - our travels explained
Paths converging, entwined forever
Showing us what we have always known

Physically apart, filled with sorrow
Fires build - warming, shrinking the distance
Reminding us we were always together
Showing us the paths we can take
Discovering what we have always known

Choices arise, worries cloud our minds
The lights dimmed, the fires cooled
The eternally entwined stretch and pull
Parting - a gap, more than physical distance between us
Ignoring what we have always known

Straying from our path, pulling apart
Crawling blindly again
The lights too dim - the fires too cool
Losing our way in the travels of our lives
Forgetting what we have always known

Our love pulls on us, rejoining the paths
Drawing us together
The lights brighten
The fires gain heat - all greater than before
Repeating what we have always known

The future calls, the distance ignored
Walking upright, our paths bathed with light
Our hearts filled with fire
Our love shining, pushing us forward
Yearning to be joined again
Reaching to hold what we have always known

One day, our paths combine
Our souls mated together
Our lights illuminating each other
Our fires warming us - the ONE
Becoming what we have always known

Our love explodes, bathing us in our beauty
A glow surrounds us - lighting our heart
lifting our soul, guiding our life
Being the ONE - living the path
Finally knowing what we have always known

Looking back -
Always knowing each other
Understanding our paths were always one
Learning the lessons we needed
Discovering our truth
Taking the journey of what we have always known

Living forward -
Never straying, never apart
Bathed in the beauty
Enhanced by the connection
ONE
Living what we have always known

- Jon L. Grimes

     Yeah, but Docs ( well the boots anyway ) are sure hard to break in. I 
think I still have my blisters from 5 years ago;).

i think, brian didn't have in mind to deny that true beauty comes from 
the inside and what more of that kind of pc truths might be essential for 
you. yes it's true. true beauty comes from the inside.
i know him, and he would definitely be the last one to treat somebody in 
normal casual or even stinky old clothes with less friendliness than anybody 
else. (sounds hard to believe after he went off here so pissy several 
times, but its true nevertheless)
i believe he just wanted to point out, and this is my opinion too, that he 
thinks you somewhat owe it yourself and your friends to look nice at a 
party, to make that event even more special for everybody. maybe sf as the 
old hippy pit it is is not the best place to make such a remark. 
i guess the way he chose to do so was kinda strange, telling everybody 
how much time he spends to shop for clothes (man some people *work*) and 
how fucking valuable his outfit is; but hey, he was on top of the world and 
the air is kinda thinnish there.

as for me, i totally love seeing these cute kids with their baggy pants 
or little silver dresses and piercings and reflecing orange dyed hair when 
i'm out at a party and i always appreciate it if i notice somebody has made an 
attempt to look special (and i try to provide that myself), be it in a 
fashionable or individual way, successful or not. 
i like seeing hats and boas and everything, i wish we would have more of 
that stuff in berlin, where the scene is kinda more *cool* you know.
i especially like it when guys dress up a bit beyoind (sp?) the usual jeans 
t-shirt doc martens thing, in some kind of britpop kinda way, or, 
i *love* seeing guys in gaultier-like kinda gay clothing, i like seeing 
those skirts and little half-seethrough poloshirts with knitted collars and 
whatnot, and i absolutely like seeing if they do funky stuff with their 
hair, like fixing it in cute little horns or something like that.
you know this is just a little eye-thing, nothing really important, but i 
like it. i don't give a lot on brand names btw, they get worn out so 
quickly if everybody has them, so something funky from a thrift store or 
selfmade may be much nicer and more successful in many cases.
i'm really sorry brian is so pissed, i guess it's not really anybodies 
fault, i already noticed that he has his little ways when it comes to 
email correspondence, always taking things too personally.
in the end, i think, both sides opinions are not that far apart 
in that thread (compared to that socialism thing at least), so if this one 
could fall peacefully asleep, why shouldn't everybody be able to leave as 
friends now.

c'mon brian! :) smile :)

whoa can anybody tell me why my emails always grow that long?
thanks for the response on my vegas post, but actually i'm still pretty 
clueless about whats going on in vegas itself apart from the fact that it 
apparently is not much. anybody???

hey jason (and others who don't like nrr posts)-

as offender #1 of your distaste for nrr posts, i shall disagree with you now.

for me, rave related means related to the people who rave.  if raving were
just going out to dance and listen to good music, i would agree totally with
you.  for me, it is much more than that, though.  i have observed that
raving is a lifestyle that tends to extend beyond the bounds of parties,
into your social interaction, many people's job interactions, even affecting
such personal things as their very view of the world.  raving is not the
same for everybody nor should it be, but many people have had the experience
of feeling their life change at a rave.

thus, i tend to believe in an all inclusive definition of raving which is
more of a lifestyle than a party, and many i have talked to agree with that.
you may disagree and that's fine, but it remains that people will post what
they believe to be rr material: for you, it may be party reviews; for me, it
may be the social network that has been built around the raving lifestyle.
both are good and correct, and our only disagreement comes in determining
what's rr and what's nrr.

i post alot of stuff that is rr for me, because it relates to my friends who
are ravers, or the changes in my life that came from raving, etc.  our
definitions are not the same, and we'll have to compromise on that.

thus, disagreeing with the content of many posts is fine, deleting many
posts is fine, but holding others to your standards is a losing battle.  

i hope this has come across the correct way, for i mean no offense to anyone.

love to you all, and may your day me as rr or nrr as you wish-

This is the official Sun Microsystems policy on email, and I think
it has a lot of relevence to sfraves.  Enjoy:

---------------------------

Everyone knows that Sun lives by e-mail.  Well over a million e-mail
messages travel between Sun's domains (Corp, Eng, UK, etc.) each day.
The average message is 16,000 bytes long, so the total traffic exceeds
16 gigabytes every day.  And that doesn't include the e-mail traffic
between users in the same domain.

With numbers this large it is easy to see that Sun not only lives by
e-mail, we could die by it as well.  It is necessary, therefore, to
occasionally remind everyone about proper e-mail usage.  This is that
reminder.

Please keep these things in mind as you use e-mail for your work and
pleasure:

1. MESSAGE SIZE
We often think of e-mail as virtually instantaneous.  How many times do
we send documents to people while talking to them on the phone and
expect them to receive it within a few seconds?  It is easy to forget
that there are limits to what our e-mail system can do.  It does take
longer to send large messages.  For example, a 10MB (~10 million bytes)
report attached to an e-mail message will take at least 24 minutes to
go over a 56Kb link to a small office.  All traffic over that link will
be affected and will increase the time required to deliver the
message.  We have seen people attempting to send up to 40MB attachments
in e-mail, and we are starting to impose 5MB limits on the systems that
handle inter-domain e-mail.  If you have a message larger than 5MB you
need to find a different way, such as ftp or a web page, to share that
information.

2. INFORMATION FORMAT
Information format is often related to message size.  Graphics, word
processor documents, and audio files can be very large.  Are they worth
it?  If you are sending a 500,000 byte postscript file of three slides,
each of which has five lines of 20 characters each, the answer is
probably no unless the recipient needs to print them out on
transparencies to use for a presentation.  Non-ASCII formats also
require special software to process them.  If your recipient doesn't
have the right software then they cannot use the information.  Keep in
mind that more and more employees are working on laptops or remotely
connected in ways that don't allow them to run many of the applications
that we take for granted.  If special formatting is required or adds
something important, then use it.  But if you can get your message
across in plain text in the body of the message it will get there
faster and be more easily used by everyone.


3. MULTIPLIERS
If you send an e-mail attachment that is 1MB in size to 100 users it
will consume 100MB of disk space around the company.  If all of those
users share a single mailbox server, which is very common in the field,
then you could quickly consume 100MB of disk space on a single
machine.

When a mailbox server runs out of disk space it often starts bouncing
e-mail until the problem is fixed.  Additionally, the users cannot fix
the problem themselves because they cannot even delete messages!  So it
is very important that you consider the multiplier effect when you send
out large messages.


4. KNOW YOUR AUDIENCE:
Much of the e-mail we send goes to mailing lists (also called aliases)
containing many users.  In addition to the multiplier effect you should
keep in mind the purpose of each mailing list and choose the correct
list for your message.  For example, if you want to sell your car (and
live in the Bay Area) you should send your e-mail to "forsale@sun.com"
and *not* to "allhome@sun.com".


5. DO NOT REPLY TO ALL
There are two major options when you reply to a message: your reply can
go to the sender only, or to everyone that received the original
message.  Your mail program uses one option or the other as the default
(you can change the default or explicitly choose which kind of reply to
use for each message).  When you are typing your reply you can look at
the top and see who the reply is going to.  Do not reply to everyone
unless everyone needs to see the reply.  In general, not everyone needs
to see your congratulatory reply about the new VP's promotion.


6. CONTEXT--BUT NOT TOO MUCH
We all get lots of e-mail.  If I get a reply that says "I agree" but
nothing else, I will have no clue as to what you are agreeing with
because I presented 3 different choices in my original message.
Conversely, if your reply says "I prefer option 2" and then you include
my entire 1000 line message and 4 attachments I'll be a bit miffed
about the waste of disk space and network bandwidth.


7. CHAIN LETTERS, CRAIG SHERGOLD, VIRUS ALERTS, ETC.
The forwarding of chain letters is against company policy.  They are a
complete and total waste of Sun's computer and network resources (isn't
that redundant?).  I've also called several 1-900 numbers and the
psychics all agree that the risk associated with not forwarding chain
letters is so small that you cannot assume that your broken leg is in
any way related.

Virtually all of the Good Samaritan pleas (send a postcard or hat or
letter or whatever to some poor waif in a hospital in some foreign
country or Texas so they can get into the "Guinness Book of World
Records" for collecting the most postcards, hats, or letters) are
hoaxes.  If you can't verify the truth of the request for yourself by
calling the recipient then it is a hoax.  And did you ever notice that
the person who forwards the request never claims to have verified it
for themselves?  It is always a "friend" who has verified it.

Finally, if there is a real virus threat you will be notified of it by
our own Network Security Group.  If you think that you are the first to
hear about some threat, don't send it to everyone in your office, send
it to "nsg@Sun.COM".  They will investigate it and make any needed
announcement.


8. NOBLE CAUSES AND JOYOUS OR UNFORTUNATE EVENTS
There are many noble causes that deserve support, and Sun employees are
known for their caring and generosity.  Similarly, from time to time
our co-workers experience things that are wonderful (birth of a baby,
promotion, anniversary, winning the lottery, etc.) or tragic (death of
family member, death of self, serious illness, etc.).  If e-mail
arrived via a large mailing list for each one of these causes and
events we would all be quickly overwhelmed, so please avoid the use of
building or area aliases to announce these things.

If the cause you wish to support is large enough in scope you should
ask Corporate Affairs to sponsor and announce it.  If it is not that
large, use fliers, special interest aliases, or special-interest
newsgroups to publicize it.  For personal events, send e-mail to the
person's immediate co-workers and friends only.



SUMMARY
E-mail is an important tool for running our business.  But like any
tool is can be misused, overused, and abused.  The above guidelines are
intended to help you avoid being labeled as an abuser of e-mail.  If
everyone follows these guidelines maybe we'll hear fewer people
complaining in the hallway about how much useless e-mail they have to
go through each day.

I know there are many people who do not listen to this show, but I do and 
today one of the guests (among stripers etc.) was a directory of BM.  It 
was interesting to hear him talk about it (although I didn't really learn 
much more than I knew).  Lori asked about the rave and the guy (whatever 
his name is) said that there will be the biggest rave of the year with 6 
sounds systems just 2 miles N of the main camp.

Does this sound like Nation?  I hope BM is not being over commercialized 
and it doesn't get busted by Black Rock Desert police :P.

Hugz to all and I will be seeing you probably only at outdoor events till 
BM (although I might change my mind).

*i* think it's mostly interesting though.

and there aren't really that many foggy subjects.
everything quite neatly classified - meat vs. veggies, clothes vs. ravers
 -  what about these could give rise to the expectations that a party is 
being announced or something?
a little delete key hitting should not be too much of a workout to extract 
all that valuable rave information in the end. like in real life.
isn't your work email marked private btw?

still i feel the need to apologize for putting myself into that clothes 
thread - i did it because brian is my friend. so everybody has their 
reasons to post something i guess, exactly like you.

No, Jason does have a good point, even if not phrased in the
most diplomatic of terms.

As a user of Hyperreal as a development tool, I'd like to request
that people read over the following guidelines, which apply to
*all* email lists:

	- is your post relevant to the purpose of the list?
	- have you made more than two posts to the list today?
	- is your message better suited for private email?

Those questions, I believe, are fair and reasonable.  The net, like
anything else, is a finite resource :)

Thanks,

	Sami

I have tried to send this a few times but I have not seen it come back so
here you go...


I suggest reading the initial Welcome to SFRaves message you get when you
subscribe to the list. I recently had to resub to the list and I actually
read the Welcome message, I havn't seen it in a long time. To my surprise
90%-95% of the post on here are all off subject. The welcome message explain
what is rave related or not. Most all of the people on here, including
myself love to hear about other things that happen to us that are not rave
related. But for those that don't want to hear it or see the flames all over
the place, they have to live with it if they want to stay subbed on this
list. I know there is the delete key, but the should have to be deleting
10-20 post that envolve 2 or 3 people flaming each other publicly. So let
have some respect for everyone and take it off the list and make it private.
If someone want to read the flames then they should ask to be included in
there flame war. The CC: is good at times, but lets not over use it. We
don't need to include sfraves in every single post. I kinda like the flames
myself, it gives me a better and true understanding about what kind of
people are on the list and how they truly are as a person.

Anyway that's my 2 bits on this matter...

thanks to Ran, Wayne, Todd Manley and Jeff Thorne for their responses. here's
what I found out:

1. while there is information about intimidation mixers on the web, there is
no mention as yet of the blue.
2. intimidation's email address is intimidation@dingding.demon.co.uk and they
have not yet responded to an email I sent yesterday. I'll keep you posted if
they do provide any additional info.

>5. DO NOT REPLY TO ALL
please please please do not reply to all (esp. when i am one of the cc:'s)
nothing is more irritating that getting your name in the cc: list at the
start of a flame war and getting multiple copies of everything. :(

>6. CONTEXT--BUT NOT TOO MUCH
this has to be my biggest complaint. if you are responding to specific parts
of a message, then cut out the irrelevant stuff. if not, at least chop off
the other person's 20-line ascii signature file.
we owe it to organic.com to not suck up too much of their bandwidth, as they
are providing it to us for free use.

>--->MEGGA BUZZ ONE!!!<---

I got somethin' to say abou this Mega Buzz party.  Yes, its comercial. Yes, its a Massive.  Yes, you will be searched 8 times before you can enter the party.  Yes, there will be $3 bottles of Water (Probably $4, or $5). Yes, there will be people there young enough to be my kids (I'm only 25).  Yes, there will be guys there frontin' their stuff for the Girls.  Yes, there will be Girls there fontin' their stuff for the guys.  But I'm going anyways.  Simply because of this:

Harry Who?, Mattski, Erik Spire, Liquid, Mei-Lwun, Jay Hartley, Chris.

Representing the South Bay.  Repersenting the TALENT of the South Bay.  San Jose (and Santa Cruz) are forgoten cities in Rave World.  I'm glad people are starting to notice  and respect San Jose as a driving force in the future of OUR scene.

But dont fear!!!  we plan on making a Marathon run to the desert to catch the Burning!

peace,

   But what about the few who might be on PCP or something like that.
They'll see everyone swimming around having fun and try to joinin only to
notice that it's not a pool of people but a waterslide that has teeth, which
swallows them up. They're going down this monstors throat only to eventually

Wait one minute now. . . I remember hearing some old story about this mean
old lady who could do special things. She was pissed at this chick for some
reason and decided to move her house. Somehow she made up a whirlwind and
picked up that chicks house and moved it somewhere else. The only crappy
part was that she accidentily killed her sister in the process.
  Now all you need is a whirlwind maker thingy.

Or we all (hundreds) can go nicely and ask???? Cut the phone lines first though.

post such as the above described?  The only way is of course to open it up
and read it.  Now, A LOT of e-mail comes in through SFRAVES, EVERYBODY in

gets VERY TEDIOUS to weed through all of the untitled posts throughout the
day just to try to find something of content.  It is really very simple, and
I fail to see what is so hard about doing this.  This has been said, asked,
requested and BEGGED before, but PEOPLE STILL DO IT.  I find it VERY
inconsiderate and rude.  Especially for people that work jobs where REAL,

Excuse me sir, is your post RAVE RELATED (NRR)??? 
   Why do you have such a problem with this? What do you expect this list to
be like? You can only talk soooo much about raves n all. See, there's real
people out here with real lives (REALLY). And these people are interested in
things that are similar in nature. WEIRD! OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHH!
     This list was more for the rave community than it was for just straight
out rave talk (I think). If the people like movies, than they talk about
movies they like. If they found out about some drug doing weird things to
people, they should let others know.
     I guess you didn't realize that you're also contributing o this garbage
mail. See, you're one of us now. You can't leave, we'll find you and eat all
your pretty white marshmallows.
     But still I agree with a couple of your points: 
People should have a subject other than , STUFF, THINGS, ?????.
Everyone should try to explain their views on a subject without pushing
their views on everyone else, thus starting an argument. People can talk,
it's a magical ability, so why not talk instead of scream. Makes sense??? Yep.

Hope I didn't piss you off. (too much)

You need a hug or somethin:\

Jason is right on.

I, who have felt that being a part of SFRaves has changed my life in a very
positive way, have been contemplating leaving this list because of the
volume of crap that has been rampant lately.

Jason is right.  We have to think before we post, and self-edit the content
for general interest.  If you have a need to say "it's a beautiful day and
I love you all" create a personal sublist of people who actually know you,
and will be happy to hear from you.  It's a lovely thought, but if 500
people each spend 15 seconds to read that message, that's over two hours of
other people's time taken on ... sorry ... non-productive fluff.

I also concur that flame wars are private and should remain that way ...
Many of these discussions shouldn't happen in the first place, but copying
them to the entire list is ridiculous ... and it's NO accident ... when I
see flaming messages sent by one individual to another, with a cc to
SFRaves, I have to wonder what twisted psyche is at work.  Hey, you want to
fight and be nasty?  Don't copy me on it, I don't want to watch, and
frankly it just makes those involved look foolish, mean-spirited, and
ignorant.

Yes, we are like a community, and yes, there are subjects that may not be
directly rave-related that are of interest to a majority of people in our
group. Jokes and stuff can really be fun.  But use your head, and be clear
in your message heading what's in there.

Half the messages I write, I delete before sending because I ask myself
"does this message really add anything new to this discussion" and "is it
worth the time to ask people to read it?"  .... and the answer is NO half
the time.... maybe if we all judged our offerings a little more
objectively, the volume of crap would die down....

Hope to see things improving soon... or   : (

	A statement about how much I care about me or a statement about
how much I want other people to think that I care about myself? Do I care
about myself? There are others to do this than to "dress to impress". To
each their own. Should I pull my dreads out because I do not care about my
hair being styled? I happen to like my comfy black jeans that have been
with me through the posh hotels and Scottish glens alike. Traveling with
club clothes is impractical for me and it eats up money that I could spend
on records, plane tickets, or gas for the generator. I would think expense
impressive clothes might make me feel good if I was looking for external
validation of my own worth, especially in things like watches. Why should 
I participate in a game I dropped out of a long time ago? And what right 
does anyone have to demand that I play it? I will probably think some 
clothes are cool like the reflective jacket Brian has (unless you are 
going to something that one has to be stealthy at because a glowing 
silver jacket would only be stealthy against an aluminium building) but 
they are not something I will wear so why buy one?

Help - I'm a little confused.  Is it right that this group is throwing 
another outdoor Goa Trance party on this Saturday night?  
Or is someone confusing this Saturday with last week-end?

If this is another party, will it be in Santa Cruz-area again?  Free?  
And what does "CCC" stand for?

And how come no-one ever does this in the East Bay?  Say, Berkeley 
Marina?  ;>

Hello Jason and the 90% silent majority,

(.......... thinking......)
(................thinking some more........)
(....................wow, all this thinking is really making me really
dizzy......)

Ok, now I got it.  

The diversity of this list is truly amazing.  After reading the Horiscope
posts (which, BTW, was TOTALLY NRR) one can tend to realize that about 90% of
the mail generated is by >10% of those subscribed...  Why?  Well, I'll tell
you... 
Because most of thoses subscribed are hesitant to post, mainly cos of
retailation posts like yours, Mr. Green.  

I was unawares of the Limit of 2 posts-per-day as listed by the Hyperreal
staff...  And as for Rave related, well are we all not ravers? Dosen't that
thread keep us alive.  Through NNR posts this week alone I:  -Found other
ravers in my city
    -Introduced, and welcomed new ravers to the list
    -Found out about two underground venues this weekend

So I ask the "silent majority"  yea, you that guy or gal who sits behind that
terminal to voice up...  I do the same thing to... Read a post and, want to
answer and then say, "Nah, it dosen't matter anyways".

Well it dose.  really.  

And if you "the silent ones " out there choose not to respond, well, I guess
im wrong and will gracefully slip back into hibernation. Till the list
becomes more liberal (which will happen someday)...

Note: this isnt a post for you: Tim (knucklehead), Amy, Kaysee, BA, Geoff
white, Matt K, Brian D. nor the other "Regulars"  You have broken through the
shyness level.  But the ones that less frequently post, or not at all.  waht
do you think of all of this?  is it cool?  a waste of time? Please voice your
opinions...

Aside from dancing, this is really my only other mode of expression, since
I'm not too sociable to ones I don't really know...

***Standing in the shadows***

Don't say something in public that you do not wish public response on. 

If you are going to make controversial, assinine, or just plain mean 
statements to the entire list, expect for them to be dealt with in a 
public fashion.

Nobody bitches when people post flowery, unsubstantial, and wholly 
"inappropriate(per the charter of the list)" messages. These also go to 
the same number of people as the flames do.   

I like the flowery, "inappropriate" messages once in a while. I like the 
flames once in a while also. When I find either in amount greater than my 
liking, I hit the D key. 

This issue has been brought up again and again. The charter of this list 
would seem to be outdated, and in need of revision, to reflect the more 
"communal" nature of this list which encompasses a lot more now than it 
did at its inception.

Geez, ok you got me to post...I usually don't because I don't have much 
to say or someone else on the list has already said it for me, and also 
because I don't go out to raves to much anymore as none of my friends 
want to go, I don't have the energy to stay up all night and my 
girlfriend hates me being gone all night.  But anyway...

This list was turned off once due to infighting years ago, I hope it 
doesn't have to happen again.  Though it might give people some time to 
think about what this list is and what it means to them...it will also 
give my finger a break from hitting "d" so much!  :)

As a long time member of the SFRaves list I must say I am getting sick of 
hitting "d" so much that I have been thinking about purchasing Eudora so 
I can kill all the incessant uninteresting threads that have come our 
way so recently. Anybody know of any other program to do this on a unix box, 
I am using Pine right now to read my mail on this acct.

Thats all I am going to say for now,

Gioni

Just checked out Burning Man's home page.  One of the attractions is 
entitled "RAVE!"  Here will be the six soundsystems (almost all from the 
Bay Area!) positioned in a _quarter-mile_ radius.  Does this alarm anyone 
else?  (Much bleeding noise as pounding techno will carry VERY well over 
the stillness of the open desert).  Basically, six competing sound 
systems grouped together in a small space.  

Also, they have named this area the "Techno Ghetto" and write that here, 
in an "overpopulated underfunded area", "loitering youths will form rival 
gangs."  Although I know this is in keeping with this year's theme of 
"Hell," I find the allusion of a rave camp to rival gangs inappropriate 
at best, and antithetical to the message of the rave movement.

I don't want to nitpick, but I get the feeling that the "RAVE!" area 
(including choice of its name, "RAVE!" sounds a tad cheesy-commercialized) 
was designed by someone who is not too familiar with our subculture.

Still going,
N

	There is a little story about this that I have not heard the full 
version of. A little while back, there was a daytime party in the Marina. 
Cops came round to check it out and caught some people underage drinking. 
That lost the Marina for any use with amplified sound. The aquatic park 
is off limits as well without permits (so there is a fee and its is 
restricted to certain hours, and if you apply for a permit, I think you 
will need to get around the precidence of underage drinking now). East 
bay locations are difficult because there are residental areas everywhere 
and you will generate noise complaints if you are not on EBMUD land. 
EBMUD land though is patrolled and few people are willing to take the 
chance or manage a shuttle into the party.... Shuttles have been run 
before, but they are difficult to manage especially in the morning when 
300+ people all want to leave on the NEXT shuttle...

Procmail will do it. It will allow you to set up all kinds of filters. 
Where to get it? Do a search on the web, as I don't have the address 
handy. Good luck.

[ to SFRaves list ]

 Hi, this is the "departed" Larry Ching / larryc@netcom.com. Given the
recent posts about the ever-green topics of appropriate posts, ratio
of posters to the total number of SFRaves subscribers, and flames, I
thought I'd share some of my recent SFRaves experience .

 Some of you folks might remember that I had announced that I was going to 
unsubscribe from SFRaves. I didn't go into all the reasons, but here
are the main ones:

1. Need more time to concentrate on self-improvement and other "chores".  2. Reading about upcoming parties too tempting - I go to rave, makes for less time to devote to 1. 
3. Reading posts involving opinions, politics, philosophy, good/bad
   clothing, "who's a gangsta?", etc. too time consuming - also 
   tempting - if I get involved in the discussion, even in a passive
   read-only way, takes up too much time and mental energy that could
   be put to better use.
4. Too many people posting ( Hey, what's  Larry mean by that? ). It
   just gets too confusing to me to keep all of youse guys and gals 
   identified and individualized in my poor head! I'm sure if I had a 
   more extrovert personality , I could remember distincly everyone's 
   name/birthday/favorite shoes/favorite intoxicant/favorite diety/etc., 
   but the sheer number of folks gets me dizzzzyyy !...!...! 

But, having been away for a few weeks, I found: 

A. I miss reading the "nice" and "positive" posts . It was like having 
   gotten used to the voices of friends and neighbors in the ambient 
   soundtrack of my life, and to then have those voices go silent.  
B. I was still interested in reading people's reactions to the weekend's 
   raves, especially for "hard" information ( "Promoter X really screwed 
   up","the location was really beautiful","too crowded", etc ) and folks 
   feelings .  

So, how am I handling being subscribed to SFRAves again? 

DELETE/DELETE/DELETE - Thank god for the "Subject:" line - once I see 
  what conversational path a subject is going, I can get pretty ruthless
  with the DELETE on any future posts along that same line. Since I do
  archiving of my own email, it trims my mail storage requirements 
  quite well.  Also helps to keep me out of the flame wars. 

SFRAVES DOESN'T "NEED" MY OPINION - There are more than enough folks on 
  SFRaves to comment on any given topic, my input is not all that unique 
  or irreplacable. With this attitude, I have successfully restrained myself
  from making at least 8 posts which would have been variations on "me too!",
  "try this brand of ***", "that's YOUR opinion, here's the FACTS", or
  "you're an ignoramus with a poor grasp of truth, society, spirituality, 
  and/or physics" within the last two weeks. ( this post being a major lapse! ).


 ... that's my opinion ...

Well, not to throw the ol' "me too!!!", but I'm going to have to
second that. Probably what makes this list esp. appealing is the fact
that we all, for the most part, live in the Bay Area. Unlike other
mailing lists, where one person may be from Nebraska and another from
Italy, we all actually have a chance to *meet* each other in various
social settings and possibly form future friendships...

Agreed, I have also met people through this list that I would not
ordinarily have said "hi" to at a party, and this is due to the fact
that I liked something that person had to say, and wanted to get
to know him/her better.

Before this list, I was a reader of alt.rave - Take a minute and
point your newsreaders to this unfortunate newsfroup. After
reading a zillion posts about "was jesus gay???" or "MAKE MONEY
FAST!!!!", you'll return to SFRaves appreciating all of "crap"
on the list.

No matter how loosely, it's all RR, because it's about us and
our lifestyles as ravers.

New-ish to the Bay Area, and new-ish to the list,

Steve

        Reply to:   RE>From my heart to yours - NRR

No, I wouldn't call that a really lame post.  I just get frustrated with social battles, as well as just plain NRR "gab" (movies, clothes, etc.)
Sorry if I came across that way!

Here's what Jason Green might call a really lame post, but I wanted to
express it anyway.  I found this on the Web, and wanted to send it from my
heart to yours.  Hope you enjoy:

We Have Always Known

Our souls entwined, eternally
Journeying onward, reaching for forever
Searching for what we have always known

Crawling blindly, we stumble into one another
Feeling, talking, discovering
Learning what we have always known

Lights appear to guide us
Our paths exposed - our travels explained
Paths converging, entwined forever
Showing us what we have always known

Physically apart, filled with sorrow
Fires build - warming, shrinking the distance
Reminding us we were always together
Showing us the paths we can take
Discovering what we have always known

Choices arise, worries cloud our minds
The lights dimmed, the fires cooled
The eternally entwined stretch and pull
Parting - a gap, more than physical distance between us
Ignoring what we have always known

Straying from our path, pulling apart
Crawling blindly again
The lights too dim - the fires too cool
Losing our way in the travels of our lives
Forgetting what we have always known

Our love pulls on us, rejoining the paths
Drawing us together
The lights brighten
The fires gain heat - all greater than before
Repeating what we have always known

The future calls, the distance ignored
Walking upright, our paths bathed with light
Our hearts filled with fire
Our love shining, pushing us forward
Yearning to be joined again
Reaching to hold what we have always known

One day, our paths combine
Our souls mated together
Our lights illuminating each other
Our fires warming us - the ONE
Becoming what we have always known

Our love explodes, bathing us in our beauty
A glow surrounds us - lighting our heart
lifting our soul, guiding our life
Being the ONE - living the path
Finally knowing what we have always known

Looking back -
Always knowing each other
Understanding our paths were always one
Learning the lessons we needed
Discovering our truth
Taking the journey of what we have always known

Living forward -
Never straying, never apart
Bathed in the beauty
Enhanced by the connection
ONE
Living what we have always known

- Jon L. Grimes

No, Jason does have a good point, even if not phrased in the
most diplomatic of terms.

As a user of Hyperreal as a development tool, I'd like to request
that people read over the following guidelines, which apply to
*all* email lists:

	- is your post relevant to the purpose of the list?
	- have you made more than two posts to the list today?
	- is your message better suited for private email?

Those questions, I believe, are fair and reasonable.  The net, like
anything else, is a finite resource :)

Thanks,

	Sami

Yes, Adam,

I must agree with you on some things:

Adam Guevara wrote:

I've been lurking with an occasional post for about six months now.  
Generally, the stuff that comes through is completely irrelevant to my 
life, but I'm perfectly happy to <D> anything that looks uninteresting, 
without complaint.  

I don't mind the NRR stuff.  Again, SFRAVES is my connection to cyberspace 
-- it is my only sub, and it is the only place where I have an audience 
that identifies with computers/music the way I do.  That, to me, is 
what rave-related means.
 
In regards to posting, most of the posts I have made to date have gone 
unanswered, and my most recent response to a post sent me into an 
unintended flame-war!  Discouraging?  Discouraging!

  - Hug O' War -
I will not play at tug o' war.
I'd rather play at hug o' war.
Where everyone hugs
Instead of tugs.
Where everyone giggles
And rolls on the rug,
Where everyone kisses,
And everyone grins,
And everyone cuddles,
And everyone wins.
-Shel Silverstein

This Saturday August 17th, Gateway Systems happily presents Hug O' War with
Alex, Ernie Deaks, Minor Minor and Joe Rice.  This event is $10 in SF.  This
is a 
fundraising event to help cover costs of Gateways Burning Man Rave rentals.

Just because a few people have decided to willfully, or out of
ignorance, ignore the established purpose of this list, doesn't
make that purpose outdated.  Seeing  a lot of garbage by
the "No Littering" sign doesn't invalidate that sign's intention.
I would *guess* that if asked, most of the few hundred lurkers here
would prefer posters to at least try to stay true to the original 
charter. 

Because SFRaves doesn't have much of a police force, it's citizens
are free to abuse this resource and commit heinous crimes of
expression against each other and the community.  Perhaps, like a
good rave or succesful TAZ, we can self-regulate and generate some
kind of harmonious vibe.  If not, we can try to make it happen in 
other places, or wait for circumstances that would make our
involvement more worthwhile.

Ok, I'm not going to tread over ground that has already been covered.
I just wanted to weigh in on excessive posters.  Ok, ok, excessive is all
relative, but I really don't think any individual should be averaging more
than a couple posts a day.  People should remeber to exercise
responsibility when practicing their freedom to post.  If you haven't
figured it out yet, some of us are MORE FREE THAN OTHERS.  Some of you
have SFRaves on ALL DAY, while at work or wherever.  Because of your
unusual time-space relationship to the list, you end up feeling the need
to post or respond to messages more frequently and more quickly than those
who might check their SFRaves mail "only" once or twice a day, and not for
hours at a time.  When you respond to a post, realize that you are
potentially silencing another opinion that may be rendered
frustratingly redundant by your zipitty-quick response (actually,
tedius redundancy seems to be a virtue on the list these days).  Also, 
you are at an unfair advantage when entering a debate -- not only do
you have more airtime, a lot of times your challenger might not even be on
the floor to answer your charges.  Think of everyone on the list as
delegates to the SFRaves convention.  Don't hog the podium.  Don't abuse
your freedom.  Don't loiter around the convention center.  Go outside...
or back to work, as it may be.  

I understand that there is more to excessive posting than boredom.  I'm
sure that lonliness and/or a sense of dislocation (age/space/etc) also
play a part.  Just understand there are limits to this medium.
Respect the freedom we have by respecting the responsibilty we share.  

Rok.  

ps.  Some of us are no longer here because they lack the privalege of
     large quotas on their accounts.  That's sad.

Well on this I can speak from personal experience. Many moons ago, as 
some others now are, I was perturbed by the large number of "off-topic" 
posts. So, I emailed the List God, and said "List God, would you consider 
creating other mailing lists, for those that wish to discuss all the subjects 
not directly related to raving, as people are wont to do? They are ignoring 
the commandments you have given us." And the List God, in his greatness said 
"No." Several moons after this, after a continually increasing number 
of off topic posts, I again posed the question to the List God. And again the 
List God, in his greatness, said unto me "Nay, it shall not be so. For 
SFRaves is a community, and as a community, is about much more than raving." So 
realizing the futility of my meager efforts, and my unworthiness to 
trouble the list God, I too joined the unwashed masses and experienced the 
guilty pleasure of posting what once were "off-topic" messages.

P.S. The commandmants really need to be changed to reflect this....

Hello Nancy =)

CCC stands for the Consortium for Collective Consciousness, and yes they are
involved with throwing another party this Saturday, only this time it's an
indoor location. 
It's in San Francisco, and "free" but they are trying to raise money for BM
and so are asking people for a donation.

Hope you can make it

Love and light

	First off, a quarter mile is not a small space when the systems 
are pointing on an outward vector so sound mixing should not be a problem 
(except maybe for an ambient system). And why does this idea of competing 
sound systems come into play. Six systems is not a huge festival, and 
only we in the Bay Area consider more than one system to be competing. 
We have Gateway (trancy and some techno), CCC (psydelic trance), 
Spaz/etheon (live acid, more acid, and gabber), Wicked (straight out 
house), and the happening which is Thomas Trouble's thing and I am not 
sure what they are doing... Burning Man Ravecamp(tm) will have something for 
everyone, and be a place to hear sounds you haven't heard before... Get 
over this thing of competing, no one seems to think an ambient room 
"competes" with the main floor, why should it be a problem with different 
types of music...

	Nope, it was thought up by some people from some of the sound 
systems going up. Talk to the people who thought it up. Or better yet, 
before talking about everything being commericalized, look into what you 
are talking about. How many times are people going to object to the same 
thing before they go and TALK to the people involved before they say this 
and this don't add up. In some cases I thik that is warranted as when one 
attempts to communicate with someone (like a promoter) but never gets a 
response, but no one has asked the BurningMan project where the money 
goes or who thought up a name or where the festival first came from... 
Instead, we the group of "PLUR"y people who are removed from the common 
indecenties of the normal people out there go around assuming, now how is 
that different from anyone else?!

Dave, I meant "competing" in the sense of having to share a space where 
the sounds may collide.  I didn't know they would point _outward_.  That 
makes a big difference!

Sorry if I was unclear.  I meant the term "rave" itself, its connotations to 
the mainstream (something I was just _about_ to write a separate post 
about, but didn't get a chance to).  I did not mean at all that the systems involved _or_ BM is commercialized.

I thought the allusion to rival gangs was a little weird, but I'm the 
first to admit if I took a humorous thing too seriously.  Yes, I wrote 
down my impressions from reading BM's descriptions without researching 
everything first.  Maybe clarification (like stating, "I may be totally 
wrong on this" or whatever) was in order.  I didn't mean to 
inadvertently insult anyone involved with BM or "RAVE!"   All props to them for 
creating something like this for everyone!

Ok, I'll Bite.

Personally, I sometimes enjoy the somewhat/non -rave related posts more than
reading 8000 long posts reviewing the weekend's raves (not that I don't like
those, too!)  I feel a lot closer to the people on this list (whom I haven't
even met) from the NRR posts than from the RR.  And I do feel this list is
(or has become) about the "ravers" as much as the raves.  And I like the "have agood day I love you" type posts.  It's posts like those that make me feel
there's enough love here to forgive me when I post something stupid (is that a
disclaimer?? :)  
 
I do agree that there's a problem.  Some solutions are (and most ofthese have
already been suggested.  I'm encapsulating)
 
1) Put NRR in the subject (been said many many times).  But put it at the
BEGINNING of the subject line.  My mail list shows only 30some-odd characters
of the subject line, so take a long subject, throw in a 'Re:' or two,
and I don't see the NRR at the end of the line until I read the mail.  There
should probably be more descriptors in use, like SRR (Somewhat), RAOL (Random   Act of Love), and FLAME ;)  How about something to distinguish Up and Coming
Raves, Rave Reviews, Humor, Music, General, Movies, Eating Habits,... On  
second thought, that's too structured.  F**k it, but if people could at least
be descriptive in their subject headings...
 
2) Update subject lines.  When the thread changes direction, change the subject line. 
 
3) When including other people's text, only copy what's neccessary!!!  If it's
neccessary to copy 180 lines, so be it, but if not, don't.  And don't copy  
the sig if it's in extra 50! 

4) Try to be concise.  This one is the most difficult, and I know I find myself
hard put to write short posts at 80 columns.  Long posts are great - when
they're filled with good info.
 
5)Find and use the delete key.
 
6) Flames probably should go private sooner, though I hate to say this, because
I sometimes really enjoy reading them.

Too bad we don't have a sister list for the non-rave stuff, but I guess that's
not to be.
 
I don't love you all, but I like most of you ;^)

I hate to post a "me, too", but these suggestions are brilliant, folks!  
Let's follow Mike's outline and then we can have all the discussion we

The RAVE! area is actually called the Techno Ghetto.  There's a mayor -
Turbo Ted.  They have put a lot of thought into what should and shouldn't
be involved to suit the unique needs of ravers.  Here's a URL of the map
that shows how everything will be set-up:
http://www.sirius.com/~shag/burn/  The theme camps sound fun...

Nancy, I can understand your point, if the sound systems were facing one
another there would be a huge problem, though it might be fun for a moment
to stand in the exact center and implode.  No, the systems will be facing
out and larger systems will be even further than the 1/4 mile.

For it's size and increasing popularity Burning Man is doing all they can
to keep it from becoming commercialized.  The fact that MTV is making the
conscious decision NOT to attend counts for something, at least.

My experience with this has been bad. I was once on another mailing list
that was once split up into "on-topic", "off-topic", and "purely
informational" (the domain name policy lists at the InterNIC)

What happened? Well, some people who subscribed to only one list
missed a lot of great stuff, many people CC'ed msgs to all three
to ensure that they reached everyone, most people complained about
posts that were misdirected, etc. So, in an effort to reduce traffic
on one list, the traffic increased to nearly ten-fold for those who
were subscribed to all three. I was getting nearly 500 msgs a day
before I couldn't take it anymore.

Just my 5 drachmas...

Well I can't decide- I'm hedged on the issue. I believe we have a community
which should be able to come to some sort of compromise. There isn't just
ONE way this list should work, and it angers me to see people on either
extreme being so stubborn. Noone is better than anyone else on this list
and we shouldn't be so quick to criticize without at least trying to
understand another point of view. How does this sound:

Don't be shy about posting something that you really want to
share...something that you would want to tell your friends at a rave or
wherever...But think before you post. If it's really NRR, (the poltical
discussion we had last week which was interesting but totally irrelevent to
the list IMO) temper yourself.

We should be able to come to some sort of consensus on this, folks.

I wanted to rehash my post because it did seem to be totally against NRR 
messages.  

I do like and appreciate most of the NRR messages however as of late 
there seems to be a lot of negativity not just in the NRR posts but the 
RR as well. 

People jumping down each others backs etc...many posting to the whole 
list as opposed to a personal PRIVATE reply.  Further we must all 
remember that messages can be easily misread or miswritten.  We should 
remember to add a :) if something is in jest.  Also people should reread 
a message before posting it.  Does it say exactly what you wanted it to 
say...could it be misunderstood in any way, how can I shorten it or 
change it to truly represent what I want to say.

I am as guily of this as any other, however I do not post very often at 
all...

I am sure Brian meant no harm with his "clothing" post but it came across 
as being very offensive.  And I remember another post of his that did the 
same thing.  I don't won't to single him out though because everyone is 
guilty of it in some fashion or another.

And when you reply to someone's post go through the same process.  Did 
they really mean that...could I take that in some other fashion, can I 
look at this in some other light?

And remember this list is large so try to keep it private if no one else 
really needs to read it.

And no flames!  Please support all argumentative posts with some solid 
reasons.  We can argue positively and come to a good compromise or 
solution.  Flaming gets no where.  A good debate is always helpful, like 
the meateaters vs. non-meateaters thread.  No one was waging a personal 
battle against another...everyone was just expressing their opinion and 
trying to back it up with solid reasons...though the thread did linger on 
a bit too much and I did start hitting "d" quite a lot towards the end.  :)

Thanks,
G

I can't count the number of times i've seen someone get flamed and then 
come back with a hurt message saying "come on, i was kidding, you all know 
me better than that."  Well, we DON'T know you obviously or you wouldn't 
have gotten misunderstood.  Email is a wonderful thing, but it's not the 
telephone or video - we can't read each others' deeper shades of emotion 
and wit with only text.

Don't be afraid to post, but don't get all defensive and angry if someone 
misreads it and flames you.  The best response, I think, is to not 
respond to senseless flames that are obviously just attacking you without 
any sort of clearly defined reasoning.  And don't take flames from ppl 
who've never met you so PERSONALLY!  :)  if someone feels like venting a 
little steam on me through email, who cares?  it's not hurting me any.

     Anybody have a general idea of where the CCC GoaTrance event will be?  
     My car is the flakiest thing that ever lived.  I live in Campbell/San 
     Jose area.  Let me know if you've got room.  I'll pitch in for gas a

     like to get schnokered this weekend (I'll even use the blinker 
     thingy!).  I'm a stay till out the sun fries my tired doggy butt type, 
     so you needn't worry about me running up to you at 2:30 saying we 
     gotta jet (been there, it sucks).
     
     Also, found some delightful heritage info on Goa, a Portugese 
     settlement in India and some great stories (jealous, but keep

     There's so much out there...

	techno ghetto and rave are indeed lame names, but for me, solely
	because they are hackneyed and overused.
	however, the people doing these camps are very well familiar with
	our subculture.  they are a part of it, have no fear.

Well, as I noted earlier, I was there, but I didn't see anyone get
busted although there were lots of uniformed police there.  In fact,
though I didn't have anything "on me" I was nonetheless quite obvious
to all or "pretty out of control" as a friend who I got to know months
later said.  (I was fairly new to raving and associated activities).
The cops were cool about it, but the management insisted that I leave.
In any case, I wasn't searched myself.   Lee, do you know who was
busted or was the story based on my incident?

I will post a more full review unless someone complains that I'm
hogging bandwidth.

I agree with Tony (and now Leslie) *completely*.

It seems that about 1 in 10 or maybe even 1 in 15 messages on this list
actually have to do with

  "Raving, the culture, music and activities"

-- which would ideally include directly relavent posting related to
upcoming party info, party reviews, music and DJ info and reviews, and such.

Rather most of the messages on this list for some time seem to have mostly
to do with

  "Raving, the 12-step support group"

or better said: "SF Raves, the 12-step support group"

I don't rave because I want or need a 12 step support group. Raving's not a
12 step support group. But based on a lot of the postings to SF Raves, it
seems pretty clear that some of you are intent on *making* it a 12-step
support surrogate.

Well, last time I checked, I didn't see anything in the charter for the
list about that.

I wasn't directed to begin my postings to the list with anything resembling
"My name is Wayne, and I am a Raver. I am not ashamed."

If those of you that wish to spam the list with your off-topic dribblings
continue to do so, I would at least hope for a digested or moderated form
of SFR that contained only rave and rave culture information. I really
don't care if that means that the moderated digest would be dry (i.e.
lacking all the *useless* dribble) and lacking character if that also means
that the information ratio increases to something worth subscribing to.

I like information. Unfortunately, it seems that this list specifically and
the internet as a whole is containing more and more 'content' daily but the
content/information ratio is sinking like a dropped anchor, down, down,
down...

Until then, all I can do as a defensive measure is filter SFR and all the
other rave-lists that I subscribe to into their very own virtual dumpsters
and I read them when I have time to waste.

Thankyou so much.  That was nice of you to think of me and all the other
leo's.  I don't mind you asking how old I am as this is going to be kind of
an exciting one.  I'm turning 21 on Tuesday.  I know, I'm just a baby.  I'm
determined to go to every bar that wouldn't serve me with my fake id.  Like
Stars!!!!!  Surprisingly enough though, most places don't even card me
anymore.  It's been a long haul and I have waited a long time.   I'll be
celebrating by going out to dinner and then to a few bars.  A few days
after that I'll be celebrating at Burning Man.  I swear 96 has been one of
the best years of my life so far.  Has it been for everyone else?

It was posted here, about some guy who turned on some girl he
didn't know to a hit of e.  She turned out to be a narc, or
working for some narcs, and he got busted.  It should be in
the archives somewhere.  I later heard that more than one person
suffered a similar fate there.

I too, as I'm sure many others, share the same frustration with loving the
list sooo much, but always fighting to keep up, and still having enough time
to do all the things that make life great.  Even with the semi-lurk opt, I
still spend well over an hour a day sorting, deleting flaming, etc. The idea
has been proposed before to have seperate lists for music, partys, politics,
etc, it was shot down like a fat duck. ...I understand why, that negates the
common ground we share.  But let's not completely ignore possible situations
to the shared frustration that in the last month has made myself, and 3 other
people I know and love leave the list.  It may not appropriate to call some
official meeting or something, especially since most of us don't have much to
do with the actual operation of this blessid list we are all so grateful for,
but let's think about it and talk it over, especially when we see each other
in the field, or on the dancefloor as the case may be.
I think the key will be a solution that uses the same principals that have
made the list work as well as it has thus far, minimal governing rules,
common sense, and having faith in PLUR. (pleease don't flame me on this)  And
for those who feel that hasn't worked so far, I invite you to check out an
AOL chat room or some other open forum of more than 20 or so average
citizens.  I love this list and everyone on it.  And damnit I want to be able
to stay here, especially when school starts.  So please, if you agree with
some of the pro-reducto opinions speak up (as self defeating as that seems),
and whether you do or not, please at least consider some of the guidelines or
possible solutions that have been proposed.
I'm still grinding it over in my head, but the solution I've been thinking of
targets the flames and flamers, maybe somehow a sublist for any conflict
beyond two volleys. If you've got no interest in conflict, simply don't
subscribe to that list. Yes, as an sfr'er once put "Without friction the jade
is not polished",  ...but with this much the jade is worn thin.
BTW, I know I've often been the first one to violate the two posts a day
guideline (not a rule or limit), but I just recently really starting thinking
about solutions, so forgive my hippo, Crissy.
Thanks for listening,
StEvEoberk,
(the raver formerly known as steveosac)
BTW #2 I think the "using the subject heading" is THE most important of the
guidelines (guidelines, not rules).

I'm not so concerned about Jason's viewpoint. I think most all views are 
important and deserved to be heard and talked about at some time 
(although perhaps only with oneself or a close friend). Hence my intial 
displeasure with someone trying to tell 900 plus people what to do in a 
public forum.

 My biggest motivation for posting was the hypocritical nature of his 
post. His post was not rave related at all. He was mearly voicing his 
(and some others) opinion on email ethics and more importantly on what 
was bothering him. He also requested that folks take certain postings to 
the private sector. Not a bad suggestion; why doesn't he heed his own 
advice? If he had taken a concise, respectful approach to a complex and 
delicate issue (communication among humans) I would have been happy to 
show the same respect.

Sami, I really appreciate your posting of these guidlines. I have questions 
tho; who developed these guidlines? Is there any real justification 
for them (other than common courtesy) and are there perhaps times when 
guidelines need to be ignored. 


Just some thoughts,

Of course.  The complaint that many on the list are voicing now is
that people are showing very little discretion about the forum in
which they express their views.  No one is questioning anyone's right
to voice their opinion -- only where they do it.

Ah.  So you're saying that, while there are off-topic posts, no one
should complain about them lest they themselves make an off-topic
post?  Right :)  This is the classic self-referential argument.  Jason
probably realized that his post was 'hypocritical' in that it was not
rave related but expected people not to do the obvious "look who's
talking" thing and understand his point.

What difference does that make?

These are things I've picked up after having been on the net for a
number of years.

> Is there any real justification for them (other than common courtesy)

Common courtesy.  Bandwidth.  System load.  Netiquette.  Hyperreal is
a machine that provides a number of email lists, web pages, and tons
and tons of information on topics that would not be allowed elsewhere
in a non-autonomous environment.  The load on this machine is immense --
at peak, it uses a full T1 all to itself.

This really is a resource.  We really are part of a community.  The
messages we send to each other impact others around the world both
in their content and the very act of propogating them to all the
members of the list.

> and are there perhaps times when guidelines need to be ignored.

Sure.  Like when someone sees things getting out of hand and decides
to make an issue out of it (as Jason did).  Most of the off-topic
stuff that does fly through here hardly constitutes "a time when
guidlines need to be ignored".

Hey,
    Funktion is very excited to present Dr. Alex Patterson of the Orb next
Thursday at our club. Despite the apparent cancelation of the Init (sp?)
Festival he we be here. Daum of Freaky Chakra and Glimmer of Dope will also
be spinning. All the relevant info is on the calander except that we will
have to charge $7 this time. The Orb is one of the few ambient/dub acts to

I got that one sunshine. Here's one back.
--------------------------------

 From the Wall St Journal (exact date unknowm, roughly summer of 1991)
"...Medieval War Machine Impresses The English but Scares the Sheep..."

..Nor is the piano the strangest thing to startle the sheep. A few min-
utes later, a car soars by - a 1975 blue two-door Hillman, following the
same flight path and meeting the same loud fate. Pigs fly here, too. In
recent months, many dead 500-pound sows (two of them wearing parachutes)
have passed overhead, as has the occasional dead horse.

 It's the work of Hew Kennedy's medieval siege engine, a four-story tall
30-ton behemoth that's the talk of bucolic Shropshire, 140 miles North-
West of London. In ancient times, such war machines were dreaded imple-
ments of destruction, flinging huge missles, including plague-ridden
horses, over the walls of besieged castles. Only one full-sized one
exists today, designed and built by Mr. Kennedy.

  Mr. Kennedy and his partner have spent about $17,000 (U.S.) assmebling
the Trebuchet (pronounced tray-boo-shay) from ancient texts, some in
Latin, and crude wood-block engravings of siege weaponry. The big
question is why. Mr Kennedy looks puzzled, as if the thought hadn't oc-
cured to him before. "Well, why not? It's bloody good fun!" he finally
exclaims. For several hundred years military technicians have been trying
fruitlessly to reconstruct a working trebuchet.

  How it works seems simple enough. The heart of the siege machine is a
three-ton, 60 foot tapered beam made from laminated wood. It is pivoted
near the heavy end, to which is attached a weight box filled with 5 and
a half tons of steel bar. Two huge A-frames made from lashed together
tree trunks support a steel axle, around which the beam pivots. When the
machine is at rest, the beam is vertical, slender at the top and weight
box just clearing the ground.

  When launch time comes, a farm tractor cocks the trebuchet, slowly
hauling the slender end of the beam down and the weighted end up. Several
dozen nervous sheep, hearing the tractor and knowing what comes next,
make a break for the far side of the pasture. A crowd of 60 friends and
neighbors buzzes with anticipation as a 30 foot, steel cable sling is
attached- one end to the slender end of the beam and the other to the
projectile, in this case a grand piano (purchased by the truckload from
a junk dealer).

"If you see the missle coming toward you, simply step aside," Mr. Kennedy
shouts to the onloookers.

Then, with a great groaning, the beam is let go. As the counter weight
plummets, the piano in its sling whips through an enormous arc, up and
over the top of the trebuchet and down the pasture, a flight of 125 yds.
The record for pianos is 151 yards (an upright model with less wind re-
sistance). A 112-pound weight made it 235 yards. Dead hogs go for about
175 yards,and horses 100 yards; the field is cratered with the graves of
the beasts, buried by a backhoe where they landed.

Mr. Kennedy believes that dead horses are they key to his success in re-
constructing his trebuchet. That's because engravings usually depict the
trebuchets hurling boulders and there is no way to determine what the
rocks weigh, or the counterweight necessary to fling them. But a few
drawings show dead horses being loaded onto trebuchets, putrid animals
being an early form of biological warfare. Since horses weigh now what
they did in the 1300s, the engineering calculations followed easily.

Finally, there's the prospect of flinging a man into space - a living
man, that is. This isn't a new idea, Mr. Kennedy points out. Trebuchets
were often used to fling ambassadors and prisoners of war back over
castle walls, a sure way to demoralize the opposition.

Some English sports parachutists think they can throw a man in the air
and bring him down alive. In a series of experiments, they've thrown
several man-sized logs and two quarter-ton dead pigs into the air; one
of the pigs parachuted gently back to earth, the other landed rather
more forcefully.

Trouble is, an accelerometer carried inside the logs recorded a centrif-
ugal force during the launch of as much as 20 Gs (the actual acceleration
was 0 to 90 miles per hour in 1.5 seconds). Scientists are divided over
whether a man can stand that many Gs for more than a second or two before
his blood vessels burst. "It would be splendid to throw a bloke, really
splendid," he says wistfully, "He'd float down fine. But he'd float
down dead."

On the whole, I agree, if you make statements to the list, sometimes the
reply should be to the list also.  (Although several of you know that I
have made private responses expressing my opinion on what I felt were
questionable posts... private, so as not to fan the flames nor publicly
embarrass someone.)

What I'm referring to, however are the times that:

1.  The original response or flame or whatever was NOT to the whole list.
I often see messages quoted in responses that never came over to the whole
list... where it was a private discussion, but the responder now wants to
take it public by cc-ing SFRaves.

Perhaps people might take the time to write TWO messages --- one
appropriate to the list with information or general opionion (i.e. "1015
Folsom's dress code is....) , and then one to the person you have an
personal issue with (fill in your own blank here, please.) ; )

2.  The manner of communication is obnoxious and uncivilized.  Name-calling
and personally attacking another person is NEVER appropriate. Period.
(Clue: are there words like "stupid" or "idiot" or "clueless" directed at a
specific person?  Not to mention the expletives I've seen addressed at
individuals on here.)   What's the point?  It makes them feel terrible,
makes you appear like the stupid idiot, not them, and other than some
vicarious sense of entertainment for some, does nothing positive for the
group.  It's the end of real communication when you do that, but if you
feel you must, please keep it private.

I patiently delete intelligent articulate debates that I have little
interest in (like vegetarianism vs carnivores, socialism debates, etc.)
even though they are really NRR.  But they are at least civilized and are
clearly of interest to others in the group.

Over and out (on this topic at least!)

Wrong! I'm saying (listen carefully) that if you want off topic posts 
private you should make your own off topic posts private.

I just like to see people walk their talk and not expect others to do 
their bidding while not subjecting themselves to the same discipline.
Teaching by example OR calm, resoned discourse is often more efficient at 
getting desired results.

A lot really. At least to me. It means more coming from a sysop or like 
individual rather than from some yahoo who is disgruntled 'cause their 
delete finger is sore.

Ah... now we start to see some real reasons for intelligant use of email 
and related technology. How much simplier if someone had stated this as a 
reason for responsible posting instead of spewing emotionally laden 
debris sure to agitate and upset people.

Says who? hmmm Or perhaps you like when just anyone of unknown 
qualifications tells large groups of people how to behave.

Jason, I truely mean you no ill will and I am sorry if my rash statement 
hurt you in any way. I prefer to let people communicate and work things 
out for themselves rather than censor them. If you really are dedicated 
to keeping this list rave related, I would appreciate you deal with folks 
on an individual basis. However I certainly will not chide you for 
requesting this publicly in the future.


Peace all,


Ran

friends,

i subscribed to sfraves as a complete newbie, had never been to a rave.
this was about three weeks ago. i wanted to go to a rave, and hoped through
the list to find a good event and hopefully some nice people to make this
new experience a little smoother.
        i ended up going to Chrysalis with matt lanier and shawna, and i
had the time of my life... how did i end up meeting them?
        by replying to a friendly, inviting post by matt regarding who was
going to chrysalis.

and what, you might ask, made me think that matt would be receptive to my
newbie interest? none other than his "totally NRR" posts encouraging
everyone to have a wonderful day, etc. i felt a positive vibe coming from
matt, i acted on it, and i am incredibly glad i did.

now i see flame wars about this, i see matt and others thinking of leaving
this list, and i am deeply saddened.

i would not have had such a wonderful introduction to raving had it not
been for the screwball off-subject inbox-cluttering posts of one really
nice guy.
        if that isn't rave-related, i don't know what is.

please, please, pretty please, with a glow-stik on top,

_peace_
_love_
_unity_
_respect_

my friend jeff asked me to post this-

                     READ IT !!! IT'S A MUST !!!
     i checked this party out last night at the cats alley. jungle in the
back room and chicago house in the main room. i was inspired by my friend
india, who's totally into jungle music. i met her childhood friend jessy
and the rest of the girls. they showed me how to appreciate the art of
symmetry through dancing. the rest of the kids on the main floor displayed
a tremendous amount of discipline and creativity in their dancing. they
also portrayed their unique personalities through their clothing.  i was
reminded of the parties i used to attend in new york. this summer, ive
been going to parties here in sf at least twice a week. i extremely
suggests to those of you that i've met in the past to strive for
perfection. by this i mean, we should bring out the professional dancer in
all of us. that's what these parties are all about, not only dancing  but
presenting ourselves as if we are performing to each other. respecting
ourselves, others, the dj and the MUSIC at the same time will give us 
great time and good luck.
      REMINDERS:                                                        
it's about more than just fun! when we are at the parties we should
not forget to think about our career my young brothers and sisters. how
are we going to support ourselves without using other people? having a job 
leads you to become independent and responsible living creatures.we
could still go to parties, right guys!! it does makes a big difference.
since 1991, i've been going to parties. based on my opinion and past 
experiences we should always think what are the goods things we can get 
out of those parties and learn from the negative ones.i totally awakened
myself to what im going to do in the future. through those parties, i
discovered the purpose of my existence:        

.                i remember myself as a person                          
                 who likes to make or invent things                    
                 that i could offer to anyone i care
                 about,                                                 
                 who loves to buy clothes appropriate                    
                 to my body and taste, and                              
                 who dance to familiarized myself to                    
                 the wonders of kinetics                                
                 but i was disorganized and not disciplined. 
                 i found out that i could do more and                    
                 through further exploration,                          
                 i'll achieve my
                 long waited perfect self.                                   
                 the message that i would like to share 
                 is
                 know thyself and the life you chose                   
                 will be easier and enjoyable.
     
       i recommend to all the bytes to participate to this upcoming party
     
                         THE BURNING MAN !!!!!!!!!!!!


       today my friend sarah's fortune cookie said,                       
"you are capable,competent,creative,careful. prove it."

hi all,

it's the last week of school..and i'm finishing the final project..it's a
game where you go to a rave and try to hook up with your friend who's
brought you back some sticky bud from the land of happy mj.

this rave is my total fantasy party..eight rooms with trip-hop, junglistic
ambient, chicago house (thanks sarah aberant for your rad post), space
music, techno, etc...and of course, a juice bar complete with spirulina
smoothies.

hazards include undercover agents, tweakers (sorry if you're a tweaker),
germ-coated water bottles, and noise complaints.

this is so much fun..writing code seems to me a lot like writing
prose..only the computer reads it and tells you right off whether it sucks
or flies.

neophyte computer nerd,

ann

Hi everyone.  I've been lurking in your lights for some time now.  For
the most part, it has been enlightening, beautiful, and fun.  I want
extend a sincere hug to everyone of you.  I love the vibe that used to
permeate through this list, Starchild's spiritual insights into the
community, warm and fuzzies being spread around in the form of hugs,
kisses, and poetry, new toys people plan on sharing at the next party.
With all the :( :( on the list right now, I'd like to recommend that
everyone put a lollipop in their mouths, and think about the silent E (for
empathy) after PLUR. 
A bit about myself:)
Staight from the doc's office-
I'm 20 years old, 6'1", 165 lbs, short black hair, and completelyacko.
Why I'm here-
Why not?
The trip began with Cool World part II :p in Oaktown.  I was so
overwhlemed by the scene that I danced all night in front of the speakers.
Since then i've progressed to wallflower status.  But still too shy to
mingle.  I love the music and the beautiful people, and hope to feel at
home one day.
What I do- I'm currently in the middle of a seven month hiatus from UC
Berkeley.  One of those I want to see the world again for the first time
thing.  I work as a personal care attendant, and am currently hunting for
a day job.  
What's fun-
guitar, swimming, basketball, dancing, computer, reading, and munching on
candy.
What's not-
Zoning out, depression, apathy, thinking about all of the above.


That's me in a nutshell.  Love ya all.

Hey all,

        Greg Sandler of Harmony has asked me to promote tonight's Beautiful
People to the list.  Many of you know how sweet this party is gonna be
already.  On behalf of Harmony, I highly encourage everyone who can to
attend.  Greg was concerned that perhaps the party was too under-promoted;
we need 100 happy ravers out there tonight for the crew to break even.
        I'll be there, of course, and I'll have hugs, smiles, candy, water,
love and positive energy to share.  Please call the Harmony voicemail# at
(408)486-9591 for details, and join us, starting at 9pm, in SF, for a night
of fun and excitement as only the Harmony family can bring it to us :)

Much love,

Eric

hello all -

when i went to bed last night after unsubbing, i got to thinking:

1) have i responded maturely to this recent conflict over nrr posts?

2) is leaving the list the correct way to respond to disagreement?

3) is there a better way to handle my disagreement?

and i realized, NO, NO, and YES.

i took many of yesterday's posts quite personally, and because of that, i
tried to take it out on ya'll.  sorry.

i realized that leaving a community is not the proper way to deal with a
disagreement, and i almost walked out of a community that i feel very
strongly about.  that would be silly and irresponsible of me.

so, please accept my public apology for the following things:
        1)nrr posts: i'm a prime offender of totally nrr posts.  i shall not
discontinue posting, but i shall let the positive energy in others shine
through while i exercize more discression to those who don't
appreciate/don't have the time to wade through my posts of mindless, totally
heart related blathering.

        2)guilt trip:  i tried to pull a guilt trip on the list, and felt
like shit for it.

        3)taking ya'll too personally.

so, i love ya'll, and hope to see you soon!

love-

I ABSOLUTELY agree with this. Posting someones private correspondence to

Internet.

I am glad you have made the determination of what activities and modes of 
discourse and interaction are appropriate for all of us. I think you are 
about the fifth or six person to do so. Which one of you is "right?" What is 
appropriate or non-appropriate anymore? Why should any of us be subjected to 
enforced positivity, hiding our real feelings as to not upset anyones' 
delicate sensibilities? 

Those questions nonwithstanding, I agree generally with what you are 
getting at. What I object to is everyone dicatating to everyone else what 
is appropriate. There is only one person that I know of(apologies if 
there are more that I am not aware of) that is qualified to make that 
determination, and we have yet to hear anything from him on the subject, 
probably because he is too busy with "real" business, as opposed to the 
soap opera that is SFRaves. 

                                   Black Adder, 
                                   (who really needs a cool soap opera
                                    name like Lance, or Murdoc, ya know

Hello,

I will be in the Bay Area soon, and I will have Thursday Night (8/22)
free... so I could use some recommendations.  Here are my needs:

- SF or East Bay 
- PLUR/vibe is the most important aspect, music/DJs is next.
- I'm rarely in the bay area, so I'm not looking for the best dollar
value this time....
- If possible, I'm looking for something that ends by 2 am or not long
thereafter in order to get at least some sleep before Friday...
- Warnings about areas that are high risk for car break-ins would be a
BIG help, because I need my car to get around and to drive home!

A mini F&F would be ideal :-), but I don't have quite that level of
expectations. :-)

PS  After I wrote the above, I noticed that Dr.Alex Paterson will be
at Funktion on this exact night, so that is my default choice until I
hear about something better.  (Opinions about Funktion would be a
help, too!)


Thanks,

Ken                         <*>

Hey y'all.  
I hope I'm not out of line sending this to the list; I thought it was
important enough to send here.  I think there will be enough people on
here who will care about this issue, though in a great sense it is NRR (I
could make justifications for why it IS RRR :oD But I won't)
Ok, enough blabbering.  Here it is.  My apologies in advance for those who
may take offense!
love,
shamini


     
Save Bert and Ernie!!!!

Subject:        Petition to Save Sesame Street
     
This is a petition to save Sesame Street.
     
All you do is add your name on the list and then forward it to 
everyone you
know. The only time you send it to the included address is if you are 
the
50th, 100th, etc. Send it on to everyone you know.
     
PBS, NPR (National Public Radio), and the arts are facing major 
cutbacks in
funding. In spite of the efforts of each station to reduce spending 
costs and
streamline their services, the government officials believe that the 
funding
currently going to these programs is too large a portion of funding 
for
something which is seen as "unworthwhile."
     
Currently, taxes from the general public for PBS equal $1.12 per 
person per
year, and the National Endowment for the Arts equals $.64 a year in 
total.
     
A January 1995 CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll indicated that 76% of 
Americans wish
to keep funding for PBS, third only to national defense and law 
enforcement
as the most valuable programs for federal funding.
     
Each year, the Senate and House Appropriations commitees each have 13
     
subcommitees with jurisdiction over many programs and agencies. Each 
subcommitee passes its own appropriation bill. The goal each year is 
to have
each bill signed by the beginning of the fiscal year, which is 
October 1. In
the instance of the Corporation of Public Broadcasting, the bill 
determines
the funding for the next three years. When this issue comes up in 
1996, the
funding will be determined for fiscal years 1996-1998. The only way 
that our
representatives can be aware of the base of support or PBS and 
funding for
these types of programs is by making our voices heard. Please add 
your name
to this list if you believe in what we stand for.
     
This list will be forwarded to the President of the United States, 
the Vice
President of the United States, and Representative Newt Gingrich, who 
is the
instigator of the action to cut funding to these worthwhile programs.
     
If you happen to be the 50th, 100th, 150th, etc. signer of this 
petition,
please forward to: kubi7975@blue.univnorthco.edu. This way we can 
keep track
of the lists and organize them. Forward this to everyone you know, 
and help
us to keep these programs alive.
     
Thank you.

OK, I have only one right answer at the moment. It's not James Brown or
Ofra Haza. Look to the guitar!

Contrary to the rumour floating around, the ninja gig isn't sold out yet.
there are tickets left,
 but not for long. Sorry, no more reservations, please goto Bulletproof
629 Haight.
The gig is at mission rock. 21 over

Also I have 3 CD's to give away. First 3 emails to reach me, that answer
this, which big American rock artist, is featured in colcuts sample heavy
remix of paid in full by Eric B and Raqueem.

The CD's are Funky Porcini, Dj Food, Earthrise.

See ya Saturday

I'm 31.  What's the prob?  My question to you is, how old are you when 
you're at a rave?  I'm about... oh... 8?  Although a really pretty girl 
walking by can make me 16 in a big hurry...  ;)  Old enough to understand 
it, young enough to find it wonderful and new each time.

It's getting closer.  The ripples travelling back growing like the 
anticipation of a great change, like ghosts of dancers, like premonitions of 
adrenalin...  Can you feel it?  The children whisper, just beyond the range 
of hearing, murmur and giggle to themselves, peeking out to see if it's here 
yet, hiding but waiting...

...for the sun to set on a hot dry Friday...

...for night to fall...

...for the world to grow quiet and drowsy...

...for the cool night breeze to stir...

...for the people to come together...

...for the music to scale upward....

...for the bass to pound...

...for the lights to sear...

...for the dance to begin...

...thesmilethehugthesweatthestomptheshakethescreamtheboomboomboomboomboom....

Can you feel it?

The party will NOT be at the Deli!!! We have a map point at F-8 on 
Haight st that will open up at 8pm. It will close when the first 250 
tickets are sold. The party will get started at 9pm and go until 6-7am? 
The cost is still undeterminded. It will be somewhere between 10-15$ 
(maybe on a sliding scale)

We will be making a donation to the Gateway/Burning Man trip fund. They 
need to raise quite a bit of money, and we really want to help. So that 
is where most of your admission $ are going towards.

Anyways, we hope to see you there, and keep the positive energy flowing

Also, if any of you know Matt from Harmony, it was his birthday 
yesterday. He will be working the map point first shift. So when you 
get there, ask for Matt, and tell him HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!!!! (He will be 
very happy!) 

Peace,

Harmony :)

If you are going to BP, or the Church Party, maybe I'll see you out:

Me:  Vertically challenged; short/no hair; glasses.

I'll be wearing a purple tie-dye, a blue and white striped velvity shirt,
blue cords with flaired cuffs, and a pair of cranberry-red Doc Martin
shoes.  All (except for the shoes) purchased at the "1LB for $7" clothing
store in Lower Haight, with a combined value of less than $20!

No wig.

Mrs and Mr Frying Dutchman might make it to BP tonight. If so, look
for the light-blue "three seconds memory" t-shirt and/or the Uncle
Sam hat. Purchased in Amsterdam (~$20) and @ the tibetan freedom concert
($20), respectively ;-). Not sure what Mrs. Frying Dutchman will sport,
bought her at Russian Mail Order Brides Inc. (1000s of lonely Russian women
looking for YOU!) for $5000. And if you'll believe that, I have a bridge
for sale in New York too.

The Frying Dutchman, no wig either.

I would be inclined to agree with Leslie on this one, but not because I
think it is "wrong" for people to be flaming other people on the list the
way they have been.  It *is* my personal opinion that people should not be
treating other people they way some people have been on the list, but
contrary to popular belief that opinion is not involved in my agreement.  
Seems to me that most of the flames that have been getting sent out, while
flaming away, are also trying to make valid points along with these flames.
Yeah, a few of these flames simply say "you're stupid, you suck".  But most
of them say "you're stupid, you suck *because*..."  Point being, in addition
to the flames, people are also attempting to convey their own opinions &
thoughts on a given subject. I would also assume that because people are
attempting to make these points, they would like it if the other people
reading the posts would get these points.  However, most people, especially
the ones that the posts are aimed at, completely fail to see the actual
point because all they see are the flame sitting on top of it.  This is
human nature.  People don't usually realize that when making a statement,
it's a two part equation:  the point being made + the presentation of the
point, how it's perceived by others.  Basically, I think you're shooting
yourself in the foot by sending out your thoughts/opinions in the form of an
enormous flame unless you don't give a shit about whether or not the other
person understands your point, which you obviously do or you wouldn't have
bothered to include your opinion/thoughts.  A true debate happens with two
parties successfully share their opinions/thoughts about given subjects and
make the other understand where they're coming from, even tho it may not
change their respective opinions.  The recent veggie/meat discussion is a
very good example of that.  Lots of people expressed their differing
opinions, and I'm sure (myself included) that many people came away with new
information & thoughts on the subject, without necessarily changing their
own opinions on it.  I'm sure that would have happened *way* less had
everybody's posts been "you suck you fucking vegetarian/meat-eater" rather
than of the sort we saw.  Point is, I'm sure everybody here would like to
have their opinions/ideas/thoughts heard and understood by everybody else,
even if it doesn't change everybody else's opinions.  The only way to
successfully do that is to remove the flame factor (imo), with the exception
being if your only point is in itself to send the flame.  So if you're
interested in getting your point across, in addition to your flame, think
about what you're saying and how you say it, I think that will insure an
actual exchange of ideas & information rather than just telling people they
suck.  Much more practical, don't you think?

Love,
Shawna

p.s.  You all suck!  ;)

light art beautious marbled paper by Jovian Design, classic Schwinn 10

pieces of drek), SF books, other clothing, luggage, toys, weird stuff, 
practical stuff, and just 'stuff'-- prices: bring small bills and lots of 
change..NOTE, I've never had to throw anything away and it's time to 
lighten my load. (me rent mongo house with tons of space for 12 years!)

This is a sad message for me to write... I have loved being a part of this
SFRaves family so much during the summer.  You are all such beautiful
people, and have so much light and good vibes.  I came back to California
expecting to be immersed fully in this beautiful thing we call 'raving' and
I wasn't dissapointed.  

Carlos' Birthday, Second Chakra, the *Light Campout*, Sunsets, BBQ+Beats,
Berkeley Untitled party, FRIENDS AND FAMILY!!!, _Mantra_ at Juggernaut, and
HUNNY.  Wow... special thanks to Gateway for an amazing campout, Friends and
Family for transcendental VIBE-rations, Mantra for filling my body with
beautiful TRANCE MUSIC...

The Trance scene in San Fran is sooooo alive!  I will be going back to
Boulder CO for school, and the trance scene there is slowly up and coming.
But, I have so many good ideas for filling the Denver scene with good VIbes
and energy!  If anyone would like to DJ/Visit in the Denver/Boulder area,
drop me some mail.

To ALL the people I have met, and EVERYONE on the list.. I send out a 

<HUGE PHAT *GROUP HUG* THAT LASTS FOR 10 MINS.>

Alright.. everyone feeling good?!  NOW lets go out this weekend and PARTY HARD! 

I will TRY to make it to Burning Man 96, and I will definately be back in
the SF scene soon...

Please, write me mail at ---------->  gutman@ucsu.colorado.edu
this account will be going away soon.

I'll be on the list for a few more days, then you can reach me at the above
address, or on the Mountain-Raves list!

LOVE AND LIGHT!
Aaron.

Hello all you Beautiful People!
If you're going to the party of the same name,
please say hi to me there :)
I'll be wearing a black t-shirt with the Green Man on it.
It shows his face, with a white owl flying below, through
some trees.  His hair has some red berries in it, and the
picture is surrounded by a golden torc (Celtic necklace).
It's a new shirt, and it makes it's first rave appearance tonight!

See ya there!

Greetings everybody,

I've been working hard on the site again, and I've just about finished
prepping the shopping cart system on x-radio.  In about a week we'll be
ready to start taking orders.

If anybody's interested in checking it out, using it, and giving me
advice on how it can be improved, I'd love you for it!

We've got a great new selection of music that we'll start loading this
weekend (you can see the stock list on-line), so get your RealAudio
player and start tuning in.

Best,
pauly

 I don't knoww the exact address, but it's on the last block of Haight 
St. before Golden Gate Park. It's on the same side of the street as the
market, near the bar. It's a small store with a small door, so it's easy 
to miss.

The main problem with this post is that it is really old !

Within the last year, Newt made commercials for PBS asking people to
become members and donate money.

And during the same time period, Newt has made some enemies on the far
right, due to his continued support for environmentalism (cf Human
Events April 12, 1996 article entitled "Gingrich's Green Record
Concerns Conservatives:  Environmental Radical May Have Friend in
Speaker").

Hi all!

Just a question.  Are sfraves and nw-sfraves the same thing?  I am looking
for some information for the Seattle area and thought about subscribing to
"nw-sfraves", but I didn't want to make the mistake of susbscribing to this
list twice.  Feel free to respond privately.  Thanks!

Love,

Troy J.

PS.  Hope everyone has fun this weekend.  Don't be afraid to RaDiAtE!

  It was yummy!  Yummy great big gobs of happy energy oozing from
everyone and splashing all over the place.  Hurray for all the beautiful

  Interesting - since I moved to San Francisco, I've been spoiled.  Now I

But you can't forget. .. There are people who can't dance (not cuz they
suck, but because they can't), and there are people who just go for the love
of the music. See,

  Hey, I had fun, best damn stuff that chick had(y'know, the chick) was
pretty friendly. Yeah, who's gone???? No, anyway I was wondering if anyone
from here saw me last night???? Yea'h, me and my girlfriend were dancing
over by the bar-speaker-thing.
Just wonderin??? Wanted to apologize for any pain inflicted upon you by my
key chain. I just basically danced the whole night though. Did anyone else
notice that we were at this bad-ass skater party???? (like, inside joke or
whatever). Cool videos, a lot of good people (allthough I regret it when I
dance the whole time and don't really meet anyone new). I guess I'm not like
that. I'd rather dance. F*** yeah.


Did I say STOP???? No???? Well then keep on
dancin!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

One of the principles of raves that I was taught is that it is up to
each and every individual to provide the vibe for a party.
Circumstances will be circumstances (particularly the physical
ones), but the vibe is the product of the expression and attitude
each of us brings to the event.

Let us all do our share to bring a positive vibe to this list 
(including myself)!

Well, I guess I gave my part. If not nice warm loving togetherness, then at

i have just decided that i am going to Burning Man...

problem is, i share my car with others who need it for school/work, and
thus have no way of getting there...

does anyone have space in their car for a loving friend? (will share
expenses, help out any any other possible way, love you forever,
etcetera...)

also, can some of you who have been to BM before give me some info on
survival gear/whatineedtobring...

thanks

This post brings up one of the major problems with human society.

First off, I should say that the following may be obvious to some (and
so excuse me), but perhaps it is not to others.

Second, I should say that I agree entirely with the above post.  

>From my experience, vibe consists of two things:

1) Being positive.
2) Accepting everyone as if they were a close friend.

Usually, the second part is done by limiting to a relatively small
group.   In the case of a rave, you define things such that "anyone
who is attending this rave must be cool".

It's sort of a circular argument, but oddly enough it works.

Until it stops working.  :-)

IE if everyone is positive, and accepts everyone else, then that is
generally self-supporting.

HOWEVER, if the event is attended by a significant number of people
who are not interested in doing this, then that can bring down
everyone else - because then the event starts looking like anywhere
else in the world.

It is easy to be positive and respect everyone, when almost everyone
else is doing so.   However, when a significant number of people are
acting negatively, it becomes much harder, simply because both
positivity and negativity are "catching", ie are transmitted from
person to person, sometimes without their consciously knowing it.

Thus, the trick is to be positive and accepting even in the face of
negativity (this is what is usually termed "spirituality" or
"saintliness").

So, once one knows the value of the "vibe", one must be continually
vigilant, ie one must be constantly remembering to avoid being
negative and to instead be positive and accepting.

The biggest problem with raving in general, I think, is burning yourself
out ... whether its on substances, or by letting other parts of your life
get ignored because partying takes up so much time, or whatever.

I hope to be raving for many more years (it's been 3 years now, and I'm
42), but definitely I have to stay aware of how much it's taking out of me,
vs. how much it's giving back....  Sometimes I have to step back, take a
break, remember all the other parts of who I am.

I have several friends, though, who are 25-ish, have been partying for
several years, and who are uncomfortable at parties with lots of really
young kids who are taking too many drugs, and sort of spinning off into
nowhere ....  they say it reminds them of their own less-mature years --
been there, done that.

Maybe the kind of parties you're attracted to, and the kinds of people who
are there, change as you mature and spend more time in the scene.  But
raving is a little like religion for me, and I hope to have it all my life!
Raving makes you young and keeps you young if you do it right!

As Shawna likes to quote .... Do not go gentle into that good night!!!

re-certification class, and was wondering if we have any American Red Cross
Certified Instructors on dis list, or someone who knows someone who could
re-certify myself privately for cash dollars before I leave on da 26 for
Burning Man. I promise to make it well worth your time, thanks.

I wish this was not my last party of the summer, but alas my plane leaves today
for Boston where I will be going to school at MIT. many thanks to harmony and
all the beautiful people (and beautiful sfravers!) who I met for the first time,
met again for the first time, and shared a wonderful night with. those of you
who want to keep in touch (and get the report on the east coast scene!) this

I guess most americans see this kind of pre-alzheimers senility as 
endearing -- hell, that's why they all voted for Reagan... I can see
the average voter thinking now "hell, that guy's almost as stupid a
blithering idiot as I am -- better make him president!" That's
TV-demokkkracy for ya! I'm sure it would make the late Joseph Goebbels
proud knowing that "the big lie" works even better when it's
transmitted on every network simultaneously 24 hours a day.

A friend sends me this, and swears it arrives from authoritative source. 
Scary.

>From the "sometimes things are better left unreported" file

The following verbatim account of a segment of a Bob Dole appearance a
week or so ago at a cotton cooperative in Bakersfield which is sure to
make you think either

(a) he's completely unhinged, and therefore should never be president; or 
(b) he's completely unhinged, and therefore should absolutely be
president. You decide.

"My wife was here six days last week, and she'll be back next week, and
she does an outstanding job. And when I'm elected, she will not be in
charge of health care. Don't worry about it. Or in charge of anything
else. (Muffled crowd gasp.) I didn't say that. It did sort of go
through my mind. But she may have a little blood bank in the White
House. But that's all right. We need it. It doesn't cost you anything. 
These days, it's not all you give at the White House - your blood. You
have to give your file. I keep wondering if mine's down there. Or my
dog. I got a dog named Leader. I'm not certain they've got a file on 
Leader. He's a schnauzer. I think he's been cleaned. We've had him
checked by the vet but not by the FBI or the White House. He may be
suspect, but in any event, we'll get into that later. Animal rights or
something of that kind. But this is a very serious election."

Hi all,


 Well my ride to SF cancelled due to circumstances beyond her control. As 
such I am desprately looking for a way to get to SF from Santa Cruz. I 
want to go to the Goa party and possiblEly got to the Gateway party also 
and then also maybe to the Mutabt Ninja Tunes party at the basin.

 If anyone is inclined to take me on as a rider please call @ (408) 
427-1666 or write hear. Calling is best. Getting a return trip would be 
nice but not essiential. I'm VERY flexible on time. =)


Thanks in advance and again thanks to those who help yo insure this list. 
Much respect and thanks!!


Hugz,


Ran

Friends,

A friend of mine asked me a question about a presciption drug called
"Rohypnol" found only in Europe,  but can be found underground here in the
US, and I was wondering if anyone out there might know anything about it?  I
think it goes by the street name of "Rophie"?  

Anyway, it seems as if his MOM gave him this pill to help calm his nerves,
because he's been a little edgey lately.  Well I think that might be the
so-called date rape pill, you know the pill stupid guys give to women that
totally incompasitates women, and knocks them unconscious, leaving them
totally vulenerable to whatever that guy wants.  

Before he took his mom's advice and take the pill, he wanted to know if what
the medication was all about.  So if there are any nurses, doctors, or people
studying to be anyone of those, or anyone who might know a thing or two about
it, please send it to me! Thank you,  

Your friend,

Antone!

Friday night I was given a flyer, actually it was clear plastic, that
advertised a rave to be held on sat night..i called the number on the flyer
and was given a ticket/map point..i purchased the ticket at 970 minna street
for $12... the map indicated the rave was happening at Mission Rock...when I
presented the ticket at the door, i was told there wasn't any pre-paid
tickets and that they were sorry "someone" ripped me off...now the question
is WHO actually ripped me off...was it the promoters of the rave, or are
there people out there that would do that to a fellow raver??? either way it
sucks...its not that $12 is a big amount, its the freaking principle...if
anyone out there knows who promoted that rave, please e-mail me.....thanks

My BP excursion didn't go off.  The price was a bit too steep for a po'
little college student like me. :p  $12 Did you go to Gateway's Hug O'
war party last night?  It was the first indoor rave experience for three
of my friends.   I thought it would be a perfect climax for my friend
Ernesto's 21st Bday...and it was so.  The look on their faces on the way
home, I tell you, it was beautiful...

For me, (mainly the dancing aspect) raving  helps me connect more to myself.
Dancing helps me open up to my feelings and experience the flow of life.
If I start to feel burnt out on raving, I take time to evaluate why I'm raving and what 
raving is to me.

now i know why you guys all seem to like this boy so much :)  He played a 
VERY wicked set at Summer Love here in BC last night and just ripped shit 
up.  and in return we managed to impress him with a little of our own 
home-grown style!

Live sax on the house stage .... wow ... the man just could do 
UNBELIEVABLE things.  it was soooo so dirty FUNKY!

and to cap it all off - not one, but TWO raging car fires and almost a 
third, stoppd by th timely arrival of the Fire Departmnt.  Seems someone 
had the engine running for toooo long over very dry grass.  Fortunately 
from what we heard no one got injured, the fire started under the car and 
spread to the fuel tank through the exhaust .... and they got the people 
out of the first one shortly before it went KABOOM!  then the car next to 
it caught .... *shudder* man oh man i FELT for those pooor people!

Definitely one of our more unusual happnings :)

Wow, I guess one of the benefits of being at work on
Sunday is that I get to be the first one to write a
review of Viberation!  

When I first got out there around noon, it was kind of
overcast and windy, and we had to set up in a different
part of the beach than previous parties at Bonny Doon
since there were people already sitting at that spot. 
(grr!)

But everything got set up okay, and soon the party was
up and running!  It was almost like it was two parties,
at first it was overcast and the voicemail had just gone
up, and it was happy people smiling and chillin'.  Then,
BOOM!  It's sunny, people start coming down the hills,
everybody running and dancing!  I don't know if it is
because of the close proximity (in time) to Beautiful
People or if everyone is just resting up for Burning Man,
but this was the most substance free party I've ever been
to, and it didn't seem to affect the vibe one bit!  I
brought my friend from New York, and he was amazed at the
positivity and energy that seemed to be emanating from
everywhere!! 

Thanks to everyone who made this party go off!  Adam, Michal,
Knucklehead, Ran, Branka, I'm sure I'm forgetting tons of
people, (there were more SFRavers than you could shake a
stick at!).  And thanks to Terry, we're gonna miss you
big guy! 

Smiles,
     Chin

Some one just told me that you can get a ferry to Angel Island that leaves
on Friday And picks you back up on Sunday night.  Angel Island is really
beautiful and it occurred to me that this would be an amazing location for
a party, like an all weekennd thing.  Presumably getting a permit for it
can be no more difficult then getting the permit for burning man.  We
would need to recruit a few people that have boats.  Although I have a
sneaky suspision that I am not the first person to come up with this idea
and that there must be a good reason why no-one has done this already.
But if not why not that's what I say.
Tristan.

Well well well...

the crew had a great time at Viberation; thank you all for coming out and
supporting our *first ever* party! It was a going away party for many of
who are moving away or going back to school, and I'm glad the summer went
out with a bang for everyone!

Look for more viberation events in the future...

Hello,

If you are not getting any posts from sfraves, do the following:

Send a message to    majordomo@hyperreal.com

that has a message body consisting ONLY of the word "which", ie:

which

(the subject line doesn't matter - make one that let's you know what
it is about, such as "sfraves test")

IF hyperreal is working, you will get a response like this:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>>>> which
The string 'kstuart@mail.telis.org' appears in the following
entries in lists served by majordomo@hyperreal.com:

List                    Address
====                    =======
sfraves                 kstuart@mail.telis.org

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This response shows you are still subscribed to sfraves and that
everything is working - this will mean that everyone is too busy
dancing to send messages.  :-)

If you don't get any response at all, it means hyperreal is not
working (which seems to have been the case this time).

If for some reason you were unsubscribed from sfraves (normally this
would be due to your ISP having severe problems and sending lots of
bounces and error messages back to sfraves), then the "which" command
would produce results that would NOT include "sfraves", and you would
know to re-subscribe (assuming that your ISP's problems were fixed).

This same method works for ANY mailing list which is serviced by
"majordomo" software.


Cheers,

Ken                         <*>

Yes, yes, those familiar circumstances.  Last summer was definitely the
burn-out stage for us.  I mean party after party after party, etc.... And
getting higher, and higher, and higher.  Oh, when I look back at pictures and
hear stories, and just plain out stepping out of my shoes to what I was like,
I can only say that it's good to be alive!!!!!
Sometimes you just don't realize how deep you get into this scene (although
it's hard not to when you absolutely love the music, people, vibes, energy,
etc.).  For me, it just became the time back in January to leave SF to go to
school, and now that I'm back for the summer, I appreciate everything a lot
more, and I'm enjoying every party I go to........without the drugs.  I have
just learned how to spread my time out more so that raving is still a big
part of my life, but not my whole life.  School comes first for me now.

Agree 100%!!  I can't even begin to describe it.  A lot of my friends who are
settled down and don't really go to parties anymore wonder what it is that
still drives me to go out.  They tell me that this scene's getting old.  Now
who's going to tell me I'm too old to dance?  I'm only 22!!!!   It doesn't
matter if you're 60, you're NEVER too old to dance!  For me, dancing is a
release, it makes me feel good!!  It's like a soulful journey.  House music
does it for me.  When I go out dancing I like to let myself go with the
music.  Yeah, I tend to go to many parties, but I give myself a few days to
rest and then I go back.  It's like an addiction, but a positive one with
absolutely no comedowns.

Good day,

>to enjoy it, also, for i missed a few of the people who went to bp instead.

I'm glad you had a good evening to counter that nasty little break in incident.  Getting rippred off 
always leaves me with this empty feeling.  Going to a really good party, and being with
friends has got to be one of the best ways to fill it up :)  I know what you mean about otherwise
material objects having strong emotional attachments or memories associated with them.
I had some speakers stolen from my van a few years back, and it wasn't the bigger new ones
that I mourned, but these old 6x9's, in Jason built custom boxes, that had been with me on 
innumerable road trips and outings to beaches and parks.  I used throw them up on the roof, 
where you could hear them a few hundred yards away, until the vibrations would knock them
to the ground, only to be picked up for another go at it :) 

Amy mentioned a party that was supposed to be happening in a church on friday night.  Was
this the same party? (St. John's Divine Rhythm Society)

I drove out on Saturday to check out Viberation on the beach.  It was a little cool for this Sacto. valley 
veteran (100+ for the last 2 weeks), but the music and the sound were superb.  It was the second 
time hearing Tom and Le Le, a coupla ripper sets.  Jonathon's set sounded good, but I only 
caught the last few minutes and was still settling in.  I had hoped to hear Tim spin, but got delayed
leaving town and missed him.  Sorry man :(  You have to be really dedicated to drag a sound 
system back up that hill.  (Thanks to everyone involved!) 

Take care,
                    Jason

P.S. The coffee idea is a great one; iced coffee could even be brewed ahead of time and put
         into coolers (even less work at the party).  Let me know if I can help out with this.

Sunday night was kinda funky...almost like there was something in the air.
Something hot.  Sticky.  That ol' swirling confusion again.  YUK.  It was a
strange night for dreams.  A strange night for reality.

How did everyone else fare this weekend?  

Love,

if memory serves, there are six campgrounds on angel island. if you
don't have reservations for one then you are kicked of the island
at sunset. angel island is a state park and wildlife reserve. not
a chance you'd ever get a permit. and nowhere to run if you get
busted...

how's about cronkite beach in marin? that's where i went to
spot the comet some months back. The full moon backlighting on
the waves and lagoon was amazing. the hills around seemed pretty
much deserted to me.

Rophies are available in Japan too.  It's very much like a
tranquilizer.  Usually knocks you out in 5-10 minutes. A friend of
mine has an out-of-US prescription.  I don't know if it messes with the
adrenal glands, but I've never seen her get excited about anything.

Hello,

What he said makes perfect sense if you know two things:

1) His wife is the head of the Red Cross, which does more good for
people in one day, than the entire government has done in the last 30
years.

2) The Clinton administration illegally obtained over a thousand FBI
files on all their political opponents.  In the days of Nixon, a
staffer was sentenced to years of prison for looking at ONE file of a
political opponent.

PS   If you think there are a lot of messages in sfraves right now,
try starting a Clinton-Dole debate !   I propose that now that equal
time has occurred, this thread should stop right now.   Read
alt.politics.* and leave it off of sfraves.

PPS  A large portion of the following are jokes (Dole has a reputation
for cracking more jokes than virtually anyone).   Oftentimes, jokes
need tone of voice and body language...

Saterday night at Mission Rock with Ninja Tunes was great.  We arrived
pretty early, around 8:30 to enjoy the last of the daylight on the water.
Mission Rock can really be a cool venue.  The Ninja Tunes tour had their
own laser which they projected on a huge cargo ship across the water.  
NT also had a ton of live video mixing equipment, and a bank of Macs with
Internet connections.

The music was great.  I think that was NT's own sound system, and it 
roared.  Mission Rock is also probably one of the most acoustically
perfect venue too.  With no walls for the the sound to echo off of,
the beats were especially clear.  And speaking of beats, they were phaaaat.
The best music I heard was from around 9pm-11pm.  The music had lots of
tempo changes, going from funky breaks, to jungle, to hip hop, to electronic
wierdness, to just plain wierdness, and back again.  It takes a bit of
time to get used to the tempo changes, but once you are into the groove the
changes make the music especially interesting.  This fresh music was
a welcome changes for a SF music scene that I personally feel is getting
stale.  We bought a Ninja Tunes CD at Soundworks on Sunday and have enjoyed
it quite a bit.

Unfortuanataly, Mission rock was +21.  I really don't have a problem with
people drinking.  But the fact is that young people simply have the energy
you need to have a dance party really go off.  I am sure some of the jungle
sets would have been better if there was more 17-20 year olds banging their
bodies to it.  Oh well, there were plenty of people getting into it,
and I don't think there is anything wrong with the people standing around
the DJ trying to see what they were spinning.  There were several tunes
that I, personally, would have really like to know what they were.

I hope we continue to see this sort of new, innovative music in SF.

Hello everyone!
Dano here.  Tomorrow is Tuesday already and we're looking forward to
seeing all of you who made it to "Fly!" last week.  It seemed to me like
it was our first night with a genuine vibe at work! We appreciate the
support as the owner will be deciding our fate over the next few
parties.  If you have thought about coming, we would love to see you.
For those of you who missed us- we missed you!

FLY! @ 111 Minna St.between 2nd & New Mongomery / Mission & Howard

The music will be eclectic but most likely a broad range of deep trippy
house with dashes of trance and a hint of techno!!! MMM....goood!  TNT
Blast! will be providing a live video mixing extravaganza which should
be superb! We will begin around 9:30 and hopefully will go until 2:30 or
3:00.

We hope to see you all there showing your support and smiles :)
Feel free to contact me for answers.
Peace
Dano

I used to live up there when the military housing was still being used. 
Beautiful area. However there are quite a few park rangers around.

You're darned right we can bring a positive vibe to this list!  As I said
to many people at Beautiful People, Thank you for the love and support!!!
I'm beyond amazement at how loving and wonderful the people I've met

When I first started raving the experience was so new  and exciting.  In the 
recent past I've found that the newness and excitement has died down for 
me a little bit.  I found myself thinking I *had* to go to a party rather 
then I *want* to go.  When this happened I decided it was time to take a 
break to preserve the excitement and wonder.  

I've also found my personal evolution in raving interesting.  I've 
learned about the music and have become somewhat picky about what I 
listen to.  I don't have such a distaste at suffering the ignominious 
club crowd in order to hear some first-rate music anymore.

I can also see other people's evolution on this list--from when some 
first start out to when some have been in it for years and years and years!!

But, I agree, I think sometimes you have to take a step back and 
acknowledge what you are getting out of raving, what you are putting back 
in, and most importantly how you are enjoying yourself!

Ken,

I've noticed how my attitude about attending a rave varies with the
size of it. I go to massives with the sense of adventure, seeking
out to find what the world has to offer.  I also prepare to encounter
people and cultural elements that repulse or scare me, in the quest
to find new people, friends, and cultural elements that excite me. 

OTOH, at smaller venues, I expect to be more intimate with the folks
there -- not that this actually happens, though. I also tend to feel
safer in such a place.

I think this is much more likely to occur, at least in portions, at a 
commercial massive with lots of advertising. The target audience is 
much bigger than the more traditional "rave" audience, and includes 
uninitiated teenagers, gangs, woman-chasing ginos, etc.

It's amazing how the vibe of the promoters, the venue owners, or the 
folks working the door will affect a rave. Many reviews I've read 
here often refer to the nature of the door people -- did they smile, 
how thoroughly did they search, what they rejected, etc.

This is a key to living a great life. How powerful and fulfilling a
life one leads is largely a function on how one chooses to be,
circumstances be damned. Do you decide how your life is going, or do
others decide for you?

Thanks to Harmony and Gateway for two disticly different, yet grand parties @
the D-7 warehouse.   

Friday: BP - wonderful, Dancing the night away in front of the speakers. 
That warm feeling when a perfect stranger walks up to you and says, "It
really is magical, isn't it?"  
The whole D-7 warehouse seemed brighter more alive...

Saturday: Hug'o'war - What a difference.  The lighting was darker, the music
trancey.  But the vibe was still positive.  SF trance is really giving it's
own style to the scene (Really liked that Pac man song)... 

BTW on friday I was the guy with the Black pants and red cap (shirtless) and
saturday I was the one with black pants and hooded shirt (but I was mostly
shirtless that night as well).

"dance with me ",

-Adam

Hey Antone,

Rohypnol is a legal prescription drug (and apparantly easy to come by for
smuggling purposes) in Mexico.  A couple of years ago it started gaining
notoriety in Florida and some of the deep-south states, when, as you
reminded us, women reported being dosed and then raped.  The effects, I've
heard, are sorta like drinking a 12 pack of beer, and I imagine, the
potency is magnified if mixed with drinking.   They were dubbed "roofies"
because  the idiots who were using it, I guess, don't know how to spell,
and were reading "rohypnol" as "rophynol".    Anyway if you're looking to
get drunk, why not just down a 12 pack?  I guess the answers to that are
obvious:  tastes great, less filling... don't need to pee, no puking, and
hey, it's a great way for losers to get laid.

Peas to the underground,

Here's a guess at what happened to you.  I went to the Ninja Tunes party 
on Saturday that was at the Mission Rock Resort.  Tix were available at 
Bulletproof in advance.  We got to Mission Rock at midnight and there was 
a huge crowd to get in the door.  We got in relatively easily because we 
had tickets, but I'm not sure about everyone else.  When I was in line, a 
woman told me there was another party just down the road on China Basin 
but she couldn't afford to go and the map point was on Minna Street.  Is 
it possible that you bought a ticket for one party and then went to the 
wrong one?

Here are my five ways you know it's a going to be/has been a great party.  
Every one of these 
things was inspired by the last three Harmony parties I've been to!!  
Those parties were magical and magic things happened throughout those 
weekends!!


5. Good karma that day- (e.g. I came *very* close to losing my wallet and 
money before a party, but *someome* was looking out for me, and made me 
open the car door and look on the ground and therefore saved me from 
losing credit cards, dinero, etc.)

4. You flip on the radio to a random college station en route to a party 
and to your surprise they are playing *good* electronic music (not KMEL's 
cheese house-mind you!!)

3. You hair and make-up and outfit that you so carefully put together is 
a complete disaster by the next morning!

2.  You make it home *after* the newspaper!!

1. You spend your week recovering from your weekend!

:)-K

You may have accidentally bought a ticket to "Out-A-Sight", which was
going down at Jelly's on China Basin. A single map point (973 Minna) 
was being used for two events, and Ninja Tunes was one of them. The
tix for Out-A-Sight were $12 each. Point towards
http://www.outasight.com, and you can contact the promoters there. 

BTW, Out-A-Sight truly was! Doc Martin laid down an intense house 
groove that had everyone jumping!

Steve & ninjkool,
What an absofuckinglutely wonderful first post of the day to read, especially
when TODAY is MY 24th B-day and I start school in the fall.  What a trip! I
shit you not, FIRST post read this morning!  Thanks so
much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Going to find my bloo balloon,
-StEvEo
P.S. though I'd waste some bandwith here: I responed to this post because it
was just way way too cool.  I think some of us are not too sure about what is
and is not RR.  Maybe some examples would be in order. P.S. I'm not being
sarcastic, I support the pro-reducto cause, but think there is middle ground.
 Read my post about :(solutions(:. I also don't intend to make more than one
other post today, unless people keep sending cool shit like this! IMHO
Positivity and creative visualization is very rave related, it's what has
built this house.

Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com

hello all-

i'm back from my vacation, i actually went a full day without touching my
computer!  (that was wierd).

i've been thinking about the collective freek-out that happened on sfraves
this week (you know, people yelling about nrr posts, too much volume, etc),
and i must say one thing:

I'M GLAD THAT WE'RE A FAMILY.  FAMILIES FLAME EACH OTHER, GET MAD, YELL, AND
EVENTUALLY WORK IT OUT.  I WOULDN'T HAVE IT ANY OTHER WAY.

so, to everyone, whether you're a lucker or you name is eric p [=)], thanks
for being part of this grand experiment called the electronic community.
we're on the forefront of a type of communication and lifestyle that may be
a large part of the future.  we're the pioneers (and many thanks to the
earlier unix guru's that made it possible) of the internet culture.

so everyone, sfraves has had growing pains over the past 4 months with the
religion debate, the veggie-meat, socialism, clothes, and nrr stuff.  but
these growing pains (and the fact that we seem to work through each of them)
signifies, at least to me, that something good is happening.

so, i dedicate all my energy of this exact moment to you all [stop and feel
it for a moment.  stop.  stop.  stop.  wait just a second more], and i hope
you like it.

i love you all, and flame me privately if you don't like it-

matt l

Saturday was the strange day for me.  I got up and my neighbor was
cleaning his driveway.  and then another family a few houses down was 
cleaning their yard, and as I proceeded downtown I counted 12 separate
people in a three block stretch cleaning the sidewalk and yards.  and I
asked if there was some neighborhood cleanup thing I missed and was told,
no... it just seems a good morning to clean up.  and that was just the 
beginning of a very strange day... so that night I went to Tribal Funk.
It was only three blocks from my house and it was...
very clean.  All that cleaning must have cleared the air making the party
just shimmer in lack of dirt.  But I think a little dirt is important...
I found the party didn't capture my interest for too long...
Everybody was very friendly, the music was very strong and the lighting
was great... but I think a certain amount of dirt is necessary to inspire
you to let go and strive for that clean feeling.  That process of filtering
away the crap and rejoining that crystal clarity is what feels so good,
and if everything is already perfect, there's not so far to go, and not
so much to feel.  Although it was a lot of fun listening to the music pound
through that big space.  

I guess that means I need to start looking at things a different way,
let go of my current perspective and start exploring others,
to create more dirt.  maybe that's part of the reason I'm moving away 
from Santa Cruz next month... I've finished my cleaning here,
and the winds seem to be blowing.

Life is pretty interesting.

The location was the same as for Bass Instinct, but inside it was a whole
nuther world!  The Harmony crew decorated the space beautifully, as usual.
The lights and visuals were the best I've seen at a Harmony event in a
while (thanks, Ran!).  The familiar tapestries were there (Harmony, We are
the Flowers of Life, I am the sun - you are the moon - together we are
radiant, and a very nice mushroom tapestry I've never seen before).  Happy,
friendly faces filled the place, and the music was outstanding the whole
night through!  The music was so good that my upper body kept groovin'
during the times when my legs couldn't take any more :)
It was never too dark to see who was who.  There were wooden platforms on
either end of the space, with people dancing or chilling as time went on.
If there was a single negative vibe in the whole house, I sure didn't
detect it.  As always, the vibe was one of happy love and community,
everyone having a great time, and everyone eager to share their joy.  I
knew at least half the people there, and made some new friends, both from
the list and from beyond (so to speak: I don't think I met any aliens
there, but ya never know ;)).
I'd be willing to bet that, if you went to the space right now, you'd still
feel some of the vibes left over, mixed with those from the Gateway party.
I'm halfway tempted to drive up there, just to see.

Thanks to Harmony, and to all who attended, for a truly enchanted
evening/morning!

Love,
Eric

It did feel like something was in the air.  And what a trip, it WAS a strange
night for dreams.  I woke up all pissed off - I know it was something I was
dreaming, but bits and pieces come and go.  

Anyways, besides that, and besides Sunset getting broken up, it was a fairly
good weekend.  Went to Good Family on Friday.  It was a good party, crowd
faded in and out at times throughout the night, but it was fun.  It also felt
good to support my friends who threw it.  Thumbs up for them!  The only
unfortunate mishap was that they lost their original space, and the result
was the party location at Big Heart City.  Luckily it worked out well.
 Everyone who provided the music did a fantastic job!!!  :-)
Hey, anyone catch Star Wars in the side room?

Hope you all had a great weekend.........

Happy Monday!

:-)  Karen

this show was phhhbbbaat!  I was sad to miss Hug o' War, but seeing as DJ
Food and Coldcut are my fave triphop artists, I couldn't pass it up.  
I particularly liked the first couple hours of the Ninja Tune repertoire,
when they were playing more downtempo, experimental freak-out triphop, and
less people were on the dancefloor.  As far as I understand, the setup
consisted of 4 turntables, with all of the Ninjas (I think 4
people) swapping on and off the tables and tag-teaming all night (which
amounted to about 8 hours... wow!).  

I think the bulletproof folk got a little liberal with the ticket sales,
because Mission Rock started to get really crowded after midnight, so much
so that I started getting really claustrophobic and left around 1am.  But
it's all good, cuz I was tired as hell anyway.  I had heard enough Ninja
to reinforce my love for that wacky label.  

I hope other folk had a good
time at Chrysalis!

Did you feel it?

I stepped up to the gate at F-8 at 8:30 and bought the first two tix to 
Beautiful People.  Feeling pretty proud about this, I grabbed a phone and 
left a message for the ever wonderful Leslie Ayres to tell her where the 
party would be.  Then it was off into the night.  Why wait?  I headed 
straight for the location and stepped in.  Things were just getting 
stabilized.  Adam (RLunatic) was helping get the final touches on the 
decorations.  This man, as usual, was showing us all how to cut loose.  The 
glo-stick flashin', Dr. Seuss hat wearing, glow-in-the-dark paint streaking, 
PHREAK!  LOVE THIS GUY!

I'm getting smarter about dressing for dancing.  Tank top, baseball cap to 
keep my hair out of my face, belt to keep my britches up.  It was a small 
vibey party so I could bring a back pack without fear of it being stolen -- 
a nice feeling.

After taking a quick look around I was not very confident about the size of 
the space.  I really didn't think it would hold 250 dancing ravers.  Maybe 
150, but 200?  I still don't think there was ever that many at one time, but 
it was never overcrowded.

The music was fantastic!  The set that stood out: Minor Minor.  The vibe was 
perfect.  The visuals were cool.  The sound was POUNDING.  I danced my poor 
ole body into oblivion.

And Brendan (Runway_Model 99) was Mr. GQ for the night.  This man shows up 
in a dress shirt and tie!  WOW!  I bow to his sleek motif.  An hour later I 
saw him dressed to dance, t-shirt on and glo paint in his hair.  The man was 
partyin'!

Leslie showed up around 1:30 (yes!).  I love talking to Leslie -- she's such 
a sweetie, but she never pulls a punch.  We watched a couple getting 
*seriously* nasty in the chill space.  Voyeur that I am, I got quite a kick 
out of it ;)

There was a lurker there, Amy Pedersen.  She attends San Lius Obispo, and if 
you've never met her, she *really* shakes it.

Kirsten was there, and we shared deep, dark secrets (ooooooo!)  She is so 
cute and so much fun to hang with.  And we danced.  And danced...

This party was what I needed.  BIG TIME.  No bad moments.  All night long, 
no bad moments.  It went off perfectly.  I guess the most frightening part 
of the whole evening was when I saw a hamsta scurrying across the floor.  
Seems they stowed away in my back pack.  I guess *everyone* wants to go to 
BP!  I followed him to see where he was going.  He zipped back behind the 
curtain against the back wall.  I peeked back there to find about 100 
hamstas bopping among the stuff piled behind the curtain.  The lights 
filtered throught the curtain, and they were jamming hard core to the sets 
being laid down.  Oh, and there were squirrels too, dressed in their gangsta 
wear, chilling and frontin' and making time with some of the girl squirrels, 
who of course were wearing their tightest bootie britches, with little holes 
cut out for their tails.  Some of the hamstas had a dance circle going.  I 
saw this one little guy shaking it, then flipping on his back and wiggling 
his feet in the air.  These guys really know how to move...

I danced until I was too pooped to pop.  I packed up and headed out around 
5am, bid everyone good night and stepped into the cold, sleepy hamstas 
waving from my backpack, to head home...

...thesmilethehugthesweatthestomptheshakethescreamtheboomboomboomboomboom....

...the music soaring, pounding, slipping, slowing...

...the black of night fading to pastels...

...the tired little children, smiling, rubbing their eyes...

...a squeak of tennis shoes sneaking away...

...the last ripples flowing outward, dissipating...

...a shift in reality...

...the world begins to awaken, and stir...

Did you feel it?

Wow!,

    What a weekend! We want to thank everyone who came out to BP and 
once again combined their energies to create a very funfilled positive 
night!! We could not do this without you!!! What you all create 
(positivity, love, peace and happiness) is the driving force behind us. 
It gives us great pleasure to be able to contribute whatever we can, to 
help make your night as positive as possible. It is really a beautiful 
feeling, for all of us!!

    So thank you, thank you, thank you!!!

    For those of you who asked, BP was $15 because we were tring to 
raise money for two different purposes. One was the Gateway Burning Man 
trip, and the other was the Harmony 3 year Anniversary. We were able to 
raise a little money for both of these ventures, and thank everyone for 
help us achieve this. We are really interested in getting our parties 
down to $10 again. And hopefully someday (in the near future) will!! 
(Not at the 3 year though... :(   )

    Speaking of which... Tickets for the 3 year anniversary are almost 
ready!! We have already sold some, but we are only selling 1000, so get 
ready to hit the stores. They will hopefully be availible in stores by 
September 1st, or sooner! (Housewares on Haight in SF., and Solid 
Grooves on So. Bascom Ave in SJ.) If you wish to pre-purchase your 
ticket(s), you can! Just call the Voice Mails #'s to find out how! 

    This party is going to be totally worth everysingle penny! 
(Actually, more!!!) We are going completely crazy with our budget. 
Which means more good things for you!!! You'll see!!!

Peace and positivity,

Harmony :)

Also, there is some talk about us putting together Beautiful People pre 
party for the 3 anniversary party. If this actually does take place, it 
will happen on the weekend of the 6-7th of September, which is the week 
before the anniversary party (September 14th). So keep your ears open 
for this one!   Nanu! Nanu!

:)

Well, all my weekends have been great since moving here, but maybe I'm
just picking the most wonderful places to go... After such a fantastic
weekend, I almost feel relieved to be back in my messy cubicle; if I
had any more fun, the very notion would have lost its meaning.

Beautiful people was. That's all I have to say about the event :) So
many of you were there! Thanks for the smiles, the hugs, and the good
conversation :) [you know who you are :)] I danced my *ass* off...

Saturday afternoon was spent sleeping at home, and then sleeping on the
beach in Santa Cruz listening to some groovy tunes; showed up late
to Viberation, but it was a good excuse to make the trek down. 

It was about 9pm, and by this time, I had spent the entire day limping
around... seems I killed my legs and ankles @ BP... Briefly, the
thought of skipping Hug o' War to rest passed through my head; my
body, even at 21, just can't handle the torture I used to endure.
I should probably take it easy so I don't get worn out, I thought.

wait a sec... That sounds like my mother talking! So I packed my
Slinky(tm) and cruised up to Hug o' War. This was an event not to
miss; there was some serious turntable wizardry going on here (who was
that before Joe Rice again?). The "Happy Happy Joy Joy" song put me in
just the right frame of mind for the nite [No, not a cheesy techno
remix; the actual song :)].

Thanks, Gateway and Harmony for two truly special parties!!!! Even
though they shared the same space, I never had the feeling that I
was at the same place two nites in a row. Actually, I never had the
feeling that I was any place in particular... 

To the friends that I missed, I hope your weekend was just as wonderful!

Steve

     Whaaaaaa!
     
     Sounds like what I needed, but couldn't get to.  Spent a good portion 
     of the weekend driving the porcelain bus looking for Ralph.  I thought 
     of the great veggie vs. meaters debate as I cursed the evil chicken 
     burrito that put me in this cruel space.  Again and again.

     To the BP's and the CCC's and St. Johns Divine Rythym Society... keep 
     the info coming (I loved that SDream review).  Maybe if you share I 
     might be able to put some other memories of the weekend in my head 
     (even if it is somebody else's weekend).
     
     After a weekend like that, it's a blessing to hear from all of you.  I 
     feel better now.
     
     Love,
     AndyW

In addition (and more ominous), Rohypnol leaves the user with little or no 
memory of events which transpired while under the drug.  Also, traces of the
drug leave the system within a few days.  Prosecuting the fuckers who rape
women with the drug's aid is difficult because the victims are unsure of what
happened, and if they aren't tested very quickly, the drug is gone from their
system, which makes prosecuting much more dificult.  And there are probably
numerous cases where the person is so unsure they don't bother saying anything.
There have been a few reports of Rohypnol abuse in the Bay Area.  Not a great
way to get laid, but a great way to rape someone.

I think Rohypnol is a colorless, relatively tasteless liquid, but I'm not sure.

PS: why does Florida seem like the obvious place to find such a thing?

Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com

Well, did anyone go to the Oracle BBQ on Friday? Hmm... Maybe it was just
too underground :) In any case, anxious for the weekend, the BBQ sounded
very appealing; a chance to lounge in the sun (and get paid for it), and
hopefully find some salad to munch on.

So as I walked to the field, I heard the muffled *boomboomboomboom* that
sounded oh so familiar to me... I paused with a moment of gestalt, and an
excited anticipation for what was to be this past weekend. 

As I drew closer to the field, of course I was tricked; the familiar
beat was soon layered with the cheesy bubble gum house that could only
reek of bad wedding DJ... but nonetheless I was thrilled to be away
from the evil Sparc 20.

Then I discovered the whole reason I was there: Mr Wedding DJ decided
to throw down some line dancing song (similar to the Electric Slide or
the Hustle); I'd never heard it before, but apparently everyone else
had... What was once a quiet gathering of developers and corporate
types blossomed as crowds of happy Oracle employees shared the
lawn with the DJ. Everyone was dancing, and smiling. A feeling of
childishness youth happiness freedom shined from the faces of my 
co-workers;

Once the song ended, a few people decided to stay and continue dancing
"freestyle". But after a few minutes, the party died down, and people
returned to their shells... perhaps they wished to keep at it, but
maybe they were too shy... maybe they thought they didn't know how to
dance... noone wants to be singled out... as quickly as the happiness
came, the inhibitions soon followed. oh well; I had my last handful of
fruit and walked back.

just some thoughts from my cubicle -

Steve

Well, seeing as it's a slow monday on sfraves and that there isn't 
already a barrage of reviews, I thought I'd put in my laudatory comments 
about BP and the Ninja Tunes Tour.

Friday/BP

It was a beautiful small space fully decorated to the hilt like every 
Beautiful People that I've gone to.  This one held special meaning because my 
best friend and I went together to BP in May.  It was only our second rave 
together and our first *amazing* one.  That was a most memorable night 
that we both cherish.  She is now leaving me for Europe (can you believe 
that? :P ) so this was our last weekend partying together.  And this 
third BP turned out to be as special as the first and the second.

This was the smallest party I've ever been to and also the smallest space 
I've ever been in.  But it really worked well, especially with creating a 
community vibe.  It was easy to find your friends and safe to leave your 
stuff lying around.  There was a really long bathroom line because there 
was only one toilet, but it was cool because the line meshed with the 
dance floor.  So you could boogie while waiting for the bathroom, 
if you were able to uncross your legs, that is! :)

Someone had brought flourescent paint that adorned many ravers.  And 
Brendan brought his day-glo "disco" stickers, the ones you see in Mexican 
music stores.  Turntables in spanish would be tocadiscos, eh? :)  These 
stickers were everywhere!

The dj that really stood out was Minor Minor.  He played from 12:00-2:30, 
and it was a great set.  I was amazed at the versatility of his sound.  
He played mostly trance (at least from my limited knowledge), but stuff that 
varied from the more housey trance to low-key hardchore.  I was amazed at 
how well he mixed these different sounds up and made them flow so smoothly.  
I remember checking a couple of times to see if the dj had changed because it
sounded different, but, NO, it would still be Minor Minor!

Gregg came after Minor Minor, and he did a great job.  I heard more than 
one person say, "Wow, he's rippin' it up!"  Gregg provided my friend and 
I with the sweetest part of the evening.  He stuck in Born Slippy by 
Underworld, and we got all sappy and glowy reminiscing about the 
Orbital/Underworld show that we had such a great time at!

I had some really nice chats with people and had a lot more people than 
usual talk to me out of the blue.  I can't figure out if that was the 
party, the size of the party, some freak of nature, or my new perfume I 
was wearing!!! :P 

We left around 4:30-5 because we had big days ahead of us.  I still got 
hardly any sleep, and felt like I was in a hallucinatory haze.  Sleep 
deprivation, can you get addicted to THAT?! :)  But, the masochist in me 
decided my body hadn't had enough punishment yet, and we ventured out to 
the Ninja Tunes Tour at Mission Rock.

Saturday/Ninja Tunes

I'm really glad I went to the Ninja gig because I got to hear a lot of 
music I never hear in SF.  We got there around 1 a.m. and danced to some 
really funky, groovy Trip Hop and Jungle.  The jungle was really good, 
more funky than what I've heard (which is admittedly very little), and 
much less spastic.  Somehow the music worked miracles on my decrepid body 
and got me shakin' it for a little bit.  However, after about an hour, my 
back and knees decided pavement just wasn't made for dancing.  

Mission Rock Resort is really interesting.  It is two floors, with inside 
bars and outside decks.  It looked a bit dilapidated, and I pondered the 
thought of a 7.1 at that moment, then I quickly *didn't* think about that!.  
The music was upstairs and downstairs 
outside.  It was a bit cold which turned into a blessing in disguise when 
you really worked up a sweat.  It felt really heavenly to not overheat.  

At around 2:30 a.m. Jonah Sharpe came on.  I hadn't heard him before, and 
I have to say he played the *exact* bassy, techno-ish, trance  (maybe 
psuedo Trip Hop kind of like the Chemical Brothers but not quite) that I 
love.  Some was akin to what I've heard Ethan play, 
and some was a bit more on the techno side with a lack of organic sounds.  
If anyone could describe (one word or less--just kidding!!) what exactly he 
was playing, I'd love to know.  I don't want to pigeonhole the music, but 
I would like to be able to look around for more of it.

I have to stick in a couple words about the crowd (bizarre).  It was this 
strange mixture of ravers, clubbers, regulars (it's a bar) who probably 
got trapped there, and this SF hipster element looking for the next big 
thing! (no offense to anyone, I absolutely hate labels, but need a few 
for descriptive purposes:) I found the crowd enormously entertaining, 
fun-loving, and 
interesting.  It was less friendly than some of the raves I've been to, 
but much more friendly than some of the clubs.  Anyway, it was fun being 
around a very large diverse crowd.  

It ended at 4 a.m. and my very tired body is still in recovery :-/

-KaySEE

(who is now sig-less because the sig (bad words and all) ended up on letters 
meant for future graduate advisors--very embarrassing!  I accidentally 
sent it to my dad once.  That was not good.  
I'm an adult, but there are always things you just don't want to explain 
to your parents!  Especially narrow-minded, preachy parents! Arg!!!  Time 
to get a separate email account!!)

Greetings to all the beautifull people who attended last fridays
happening. It really was a great moment and we had a lot of good vibes
around...
A friend of mine really was tripping heavily on the music, especially
from 1 am on. Who was the DJ ?
Can anyone remember a song where vocals where played backwards ?
Who can tell me if and where to find it ?
peace, love & happiness all over you,
TOM

	rohypnol is the so-called "date-rape drug" which is getting a
	little hype these days.  seems evil people sneak it into a
	victim's drink and rape them.  why is this easy?

	apparently rohypnol renders a person under its influence rather
	delirious or passed out, and basically they don't remember a
	thing from the experience.  rape victims usually only know they
	have been sexual because there is evidence of the activity, there
	are no memories.

	kind of sick.  and considering the effects, it doesn't even sound
	very interesting to take recreationally.

F*** yeah I will, there weren't a lot of people (all the better) and
R.Lunatic made the day even better by passing out fruit the whole time. My
friends weren't really into it, but now at least I know the meaning of the
word VIBE.

Boogie on. . .

What I don't understand is how this drug is easily in the hands of all of these
people.  How is it that it is so easy to get?  Does anyone know?  Obviously it
sounds like too dangerous a drug for just anyone to get (meaning non-doctors,
etc...)

ORC:  The CCC party at the Sandbox was pretty cool.  I walked right in as everyone
was sitting on the floor, getting ready to do meditation.  I felt a little
awkward walking in as everyone was seated, looking straight at us, but it was 
really cool, everyone trying to gel together like that...the end of the 
meditation was like, whoo!  Talk about opening your eye...though some people found
the loud vibrations and lights to be uh...too much...
it was pretty cool dancing on sand, too...albeit more difficult...
I had a really good time.  You?

While out and about this weekend at a second-rate party called "Top 
Secret," I picked up a flyer for "Open." I was reading through and 
noticed how much more interesting than the usual Chicago tripe it seemed 
when I realized that the listed phone numbers were for SF and it said  it 
was "brought to you by same people as 2nd Chakra."

There I am trying to figure out why some SF flyers would be at this 
Chicago rave when I was introduced to the two girls who has brought them. 
Seems that anybody with a wad of flyers gets into raves around here for 
free, so they brought what they had handy.

I can't wait to hear how this country-wide promotion affects the turn out.

I was gonna say the same thing, but then I thought "Yeah, but those things are
fun (for a number of people anyway), and some of them are very addictive, 
both of which create a demand."  But like you said, rohypnol doesn't sound
like the kind of drug that would be sought after for recreational use, and
I would guess that only a very small segment of the population would sink
so low as to use it for raping someone (The stories I've heard happened with
college and *shudder* high school students).  So why would it be widely
distributed (although I'm not sure it is)??  But maybe someone gets a kick
out of passing out and not remembering, or maybe if you take it in small
amounts you just get really high, or maybe the ease with which you can
"get some" and not get caught, or ...  The scary part is that a lot of people
don't consider "date rape" to be nearly as bad as "rape".  How many people
have you known that try to get someone drunk...?  Hmm.  On second thought, I
guess there's a LARGE segment of the population that would be interested in
rohypnol.  F**k.

Angry again,

Maybe it's an evil black-budget conspiracy, so Dole/Kemp '96 can slam-fuck 
us all this autumn and we'd never know if it was a Dem or a Republican 
that did it.   ;)  Ok, ok this is not meant to start anything!  ;)

C'mon, the whole plot to keep the ghettos filled with cheap addictive 
chemicals worked so well, and after the great CIA experiments on american 
citizens using LSD and other such fun secret party-punch additives...

Just imagine...

"Hey Chief, the boys in the Lab got a great new control-chemical to 
release in small areas to do sociolgical experients with... first we 
slip 'em  this new drug, then dose 'em with acid, and lead 'em to the 
voting booths... and we can get laid too!!!  The poor suckers won't know 
what happened excpet their orifices will be sore as hell!"

Hi all!

 Just wondering who might be going to Open on Friday and Hallucination on 
Saturday. I'm just going casually to Open (no equipment :) but I may be 
performing at Hallucination (ambience!!!) and am looking for the brave 
soul who would like to assist and get in free and such.

Cheers,

Ran

Hi folks!

 Please don't expect this to be as good as the other reviews;

Really nice little space although another bathroom or two would have been 
perfect. Very nicely decorated. Great sounds (a bit more house than I 
expected which was a nice change of pace). Incredible vibe! The people 
who came really made that party go off!!!  =) It was very nice to meet 
Leslie finally. What a sweatheart!! Big thanks to E for helping to carry 
some equipment and his support of our efforts.  :)


Peace all,


Ran

Hi again!  ;)


 Vibe Ration was so much fun! I don't think I have ever felt more free at 
a party before. I just did whatever goofy dance I came up with and it all 
felt good. Of course Adam was just going off!! It is such a joy to see 
this guy in action. Yo dude-you are one of the best! 

 I really want to thank the folks who encouraged me to try just a little 
harder at this party. Such support and enthusiasim really feels good. :) 
A big pleasure to meet Tim finally. And of course Larry and thanks to 
Chin for reintroducing himself. People look different at parties at night 
so it was nice to meet people in the light of day.

 To the folks who did the decorations; I don't know if you noticed this 
but the party looked really nice from a distance (say by the waves). Good 
job all!!! It was a pleasure to be part of this party. 

 We're goin' ta miss ya Terry!!!!  :(


Hugz to all,


Ran

the friend's name is Terry!  But anyway, I was wondering if there is anyone
out there that might know of a way that I could get my hands on one of those
Lamenants?  If you do, please email me back directly with all the 411!

[ to sfraves list ]

 According to an article in today's ( Tues, Aug 20 ) Chronicle, the 
Park Bowl at 1855 Haight St. is going to close, to be replaced with
a big Amoeba CD & vinyl store. Sheesh - "newbies" to the local scene 
used to confuse the Ameba store with the Amoeba store across the bay -
now, people will really be confused! They'll just be two blocks away 
from each other.

 The last night for the Park Bowl's "Rock & Bowl" will be this 
Saturday. Any news about whether there will be a last "Pack n' Bowl"
this Thursday? The article was all about "Rock & Bowl" , not one
mention of "Pack n' Bowl".

Since I had so many resposes to my post regarding possible 
space in our RV, I've decided to make this info available to 
the entire list.

Unfortunately, our group has decided on a smaller RV so we 
won't have any extra space. But I did happen to come across 
the following posting recently added to the Burning Man

Anyone interested in renting a motorhome cheap cheap? I have

Oh, and did you see the clip on that same tape where the guys home videotaped
the car accident on the freeway, and the cars where up in flames???  (I know,
it wasn't a very positive image, but it was there)  I know that tape, we've
watched it before.  It's pretty cool, huh?  
Oh, you skaters and snowboarders......... :-)  This Winter.............

 Strictly speaking , Pack-a-Bowl only refers to the Thursday night 
event with "rave" music provided by DJs - other days, it's rock music.  
 
 The last night for the Park Bowl's "Rock & Bowl" will be this 
Saturday. Any news about whether there will be a last "Pack-a-Bowl"
this Thursday? The article was all about "Rock & Bowl" , not one
mention of "Pack-a-Bowl".

     I know that SoCal raves have the graphics for their laminates 
     available on the Hyperreal site, as well as instructions for how to 
     print them.  We might consider that... You can also make your own 
     design.  If you have access to a computer (in this forum this IS a 
     rhetorical question), you can spark up paintbrush or macpaint or corel 
     or whatever it is you use.  Make a groovin design (we KNOW YOU CAN!!!) 
     Go to a kinko's or something if you want to print it out really nice.  
     Have it laminated.  Buy some really nice string.  Couple bucks tops.  
     Embrace your individuality while proclaiming your community.
     
     Peace,

Friends,
     
I know the guy who used to make the sfraves lamenants has moved away, I think 
the friend's name is Terry!  But anyway, I was wondering if there is anyone 
out there that might know of a way that I could get my hands on one of those 
Lamenants?  If you do, please email me back directly with all the 411!

Hey kids,

If you haven't yet had the chance to listen to SF's microbroadcast radio
station,  Radio Libre (103.3) tune in now.

If you want to catch my show, I'm on tonight from 9:00-10:30.  (I'm on once
a month), combining music an an odd array of twisted parables,
action-packed vignettes and potty-mouth humor.  The stories I tell on-air
are often borderline crude, but with always slightly sauteed in a sauce of
satirical social conscience.

Tonight's Line-up (Tuesday August 20)

Music: Ambient
Some of the Stories I will tell:
        Grandpa Fidget and the Poison Plot
        Looking to Score (featuring the Telegraph Ave. hippies)
        Fodd Not Bombs vs. the Nazi Cops
        The Hunting Trip
        Dumped at the Drive-In

        ...and many more!
        Please tune in tonight.

In 2 weeks (September 3rd) Max Love and King Me are on the air at the same
time, 9-10:30.  Their show is looser than mine, more spontaneous and
bizarre, (in the tradition of Negativland) and certainly worth listening
to.

In any case, Radio Libre is all about freedom of the airwaves.  The FCC
looms over them, and threatens to make their lives miserable. If you
believe the airwaves should be returned to "the people", start your support
by simply tuning in to see what's going on.  Many of the programs feature
music you will *never* hear on any other station, and all DJ's work for
free.

Any questions about Radio Libre, contact me privately, I'm fixing to
unsubscribe from sfraves for the day

Peas to the underground,

Ha! I bet you thought you all got rid of me, huh???

I have another batch of laminates that I will be leaving with
Adam (rlunatic@ix.netcom.com), and I *know* you guys will have no 
problem finding him! He's the *CRAZY* one with the Dr. Suess hat that 
dances like MC Hammer with glow sticks!! ;) 

I am also leaving the original image file on disk with Mike Migurski
(lachim@uclink4.berkeley.edu) in case more need to be printed. Don't 
forget that Mike designed some really kick ass "SFRaves" T-Shirts!
Mike, do you still have more of those???

First of all, I'd like to give a huge mental hug to everyone who
helped out and attended Viberation. It was everyone's contributions 
that made the party turn out as well as it did. I hope everyone had a 
great time and was able to make a few more friends.

   Special thanks to: The Viberation Crew for your enthusiasm with 
this project, The DJ's (Tom, Tim, and Le Le) for spinning x-tra phat 
sets, Epicenter for providing the kick-ass system, Randy for hooking 
it all up, Mike Migurski for designing the flyers, Chin for the giant 
Snoopy, Loren for being the designated free fruit distributor, Adam 
for just about *everything*, and last but definitely not least, the 
Harmony crew for your incredible selfless efforts with this party.

   N-E-wayz, As I leave I'd just like to say that you all are the 
greatest bunch of people I've ever met. Collectively, you've really 
redefined what "raving" means to me. The energy is so great on this 
list, together you can accomplish anything. I wish all of you good 
luck in your future endeavors, and I hope to see some of you again 
soon. But don't worry, sfraves is only an email away and my computer 
is coming with me. I intend to be lurking in your hearts forever.

Love alwayz,

CT

Speaking of Rohypnol, guns drugs, and otherwise...

Did anyone else see the San Jose Mercury News' series on Cocaine, 
specifically "Crack," and how the CIA basically funded its transport 
across the border into the US in order to fund the Contras in South America.

Very interesting...though I have heard this before, I have never seen it 
documented and referenced in a major newspaper.  It ran starting Sunday 
and ended today.  If anyones interested its on their webpage at 
http://www.sjmercury.com/drugs

Peace,

This is a rave related, but non-SF related post.  I'm forwarding this in
case any SF DJs were up in Ottawa for this party.  It's also an
interesting story...

Subject: Field of Dreams - some more info

I really don't want to post this yet but before rumours get completely
out of hand, I have some more info to add to the Field of Dreams story.
Before I get into it though, I'd like to make it clear that I'm speaking
for myself as an individual and not on behalf of Ottawa promoters or
ravers.  I also have no connection with Orion productions however, I saw
a lot of what went on behind the scenes to salvage things.  I'm working
with a number of people here in Ottawa to piece together what happened
this weekend at Field of Dreams because a lot of people deserve to be
acknowledged for everything they did to turn a disaster into one of the
most beautiful experiences I've ever witnessed.  When we have a clearer
picture of what happened, we'll write up a statement giving out thanks
and respect to all those who deserve (and there's a *lot* of them) but
we want to take our time with it to make certain no one gets missed.
Please do not take anything I say here as fact, I'm only trying to
explain what I saw happen - I really wanted to hold off writing this
until I could confirm more of it.

Basically, it's known that FoD was a massive undertaking with a lot of
talent that, had it run smoothly, would have been an incredible party.
For whatever reason (and I won't speculate as to why, I honestly don't
know), people didn't show.  Also, the party was really disorganized
right from Friday.  Anyhow around 1 or 2am Saturday, some of us heard
the promoters were panicking and getting ready to run (I don't know for
certain if this is the reason they were leaving but they were definitely
leaving).  An Ottawa promoter, without warning and who had nothing to do
with the party, was told he was to take control of the party.  He
grabbed two others of us and told us what was going down.  Our first
reaction was to try and find some of the DJs who hadn't been paid and
were quite likely stranded to try and get them taken care of before the
promoters left.  We weren't able to get them quickly enough though.
That's the bad shit, what comes next is so incredibly positive that I
don't think anyone should dwell on what went wrong or who's to blame,
etc.

After this point, it was pretty hectic for the next couple of hours.  I
don't know exactly who did what but we managed to get the main stage
turned on and organized some of the DJs to finish playing the party.
The sound company running the main stage would not turn it on until
they'd been paid up front even though it was set up and ready to go.
The promoters had been taking everything they got from the door sales
(which wasn't much) and trying to pay for the system all weekend.  Why
they let us use the system at all I'm not sure because they were still
owed $2500 (CDN) but nonetheless, they let us move the party there,
knowing full well they weren't going to be paid, which was pretty damn
cool of them.

Next, Lenny Dee, Carl Cox, and Electric Indigo agreed to play even
though they hadn't been paid in full or in some cases, at all.  Carl
Cox, as I understand it, had received some of his payment but was still
owed a lot.  Although these three played until the end of the party,
there were a lot of other DJs there and I don't doubt that a number of
them offered to play without getting payed as well.  In order to try to
keep the party going, we had to get some money to the sound company and
we also needed money to keep the shuttles running.  There was absolutely
no money to pay off people and none of us could cover it.  A silent
investor in FoD who was not himself a promoter but stepped in to salvage
things, went on the mic to explain that we needed money to keep things
going and keep the shuttles going.  We passed a collection box around
and people literally threw in all the money they had on them!  From a
crowd of maybe 800-900, we raised close to $1200 in a few minutes (don't
take the numbers as fact, I'll need to double check them).  As far as I
know, about $1000 of that went to the sound company with the
understanding that we could use it until noon.

Until 7am, the DJs spun absolutely incredible sets.  The vibe was like
nothing I've ever seen before.  It was so powerful it just overwhelmed
you.  A lot of us truly experienced what the rave is all about in those
few hours.  We all knew we were experiencing something unique and none
of us held back.  I have honestly never seen people dance with such
complete abandon and joy.

In the meantime, we spent most of the morning scrambling around trying
to explain to people that they weren't getting paid and trying to ensure
all the DJs and ravers weren't going to be stranded.  Security did stick
around and agreed to keep watch on the sound systems even though at that
point, I'm sure they realized they weren't getting paid either.  At
around 6:30am, 21 police cruisers surrounded the site and we thought we
were being shut down (this sound system was incredibly loud and we
weren't more than a couple hundred yards from residential).  I'm not
exactly sure who it was that called them however, when I spoke to some
of them they said they hadn't come to shut down the party but they were
expecting a riot when the sound system was shut down at 7am.  I'm not
sure who decided to do this but I assume it was the sound company - as I
said though, I don't know why they let us use at all so it was cool that
they let us go until 7am.  We explained to the police that the last
thing anyone was going to do was riot and they were really cool about
the whole thing.  They didn't try and move into the party or even stop
anyone who tried to leave.  They stuck around to make sure things went
smoothly as the party shut down but most of them left when they saw we
were all leaving peacefully.  

At 7, we went on the mic to shut the party down.  The crowd was totally
cool with it and no one gave us a hard time.  We tried to give respects
out on the mic but things were still in total confusion and there was no
way we could thank all the people who deserved it.

We spent the next couple of hours trying to get shuttles back to Ottawa
and Montreal since the other bus company had to be sent away since none
of us could come up with the money to pay them.  The police helped us
find shuttles and the fair ground owners paid for three of them.  We
used the remainder of the money collected to pay for a fourth shuttle.
We had hoped to hold onto some of it to help pay to get some of the DJs
home but at that point, the priority was to make sure no one got
stranded at the site.  There were still a number of people who didn't
make the shuttles but we managed to find rides back for every one of
them so no one was stranded.  Everyone's car was packed but people still
agreed to take back stranded ravers.

We sent someone back to Ottawa to take care of the DJs and see if an
afterparty could be organized since we had some legendary talent sitting
around in Ottawa and a lot of them didn't get to play during the
weekend.  Sunday night, a more or less unannounced afterparty ran in a
small Ottawa club with Motomasa, Smoove Dee, Christian Vogel, Roy Davis
Jr., Dietrich, and Prototype all playing for free.  Neil Landstrumm was
also there to play but we couldn't get equipment for him to do live
P.A..  Carl Cox had planned to come down but declined later because I
think he needed the rest.  Needless to say, it was an awesome party.

There's a list of respects and thanks that's unbelievably long after
this weekend.  I don't want to list them off now because I don't want
anyone to feel slighted if I miss them.  All of the DJs were wonderful
even though most didn't get paid and some even lost money since they had
paid for their own transportation.  Everyone we had to deal with who was
owed money didn't give us a hard time - they understood what had
happened and a lot of them went out of their way to help out.  A number
of the Ottawa promoters helped out to make sure the DJs were taken care
of.  I can't say what happened in Montreal but I believe some DJs may
have ended up there and I hope they were taken care of as well.  There
were a couple of individuals who really deserve to be recognised but
we'll get to that later.  Most important though, the ravers from
Montreal, Toronto, New York state, Ottawa, and I'm sure other areas,
were incredible.  The solidarity I witnessed this weekend as they pulled
together to save the party was like nothing I've ever seen.  Speaking to
a lot of them afterward, they were all so cool and understanding about
the whole thing that I've got the utmost respect for them.

While the Ottawa scene can't fully repay all those who deserve it, we're
doing what we can to make what amends we can.  We will get out a
statement giving out proper acknowledgement to everyone but we want to
do it properly so please be patient.  We lost track of a number of
people in the confusion and we still haven't heard the whole story yet
so it's going to take some time.

All I can say though is it was an incredible experience.
Understandably, a lot of people are upset and we all sympathize with
them, but I hope that we can focus on the positive things that happened
this weekend and build on them.  It would be a shame to waste this
opportunity.  To the inevitable mud slingers - trying to fix blame isn't
going to help anything, what happened happened, let it rest.

peace and respect to all,

Sean

p.s. If anyone can bounce this off to relevant mailing lists and
newsgroups I missed, it'd be much appreciated.  Although the event was
local to the Ottawa/Montreal area, a number of international DJs should
be recognized for what they did.

Need a ride to Burning Man? Or perhaps just someone to go with? 
Then read on!

I have reliable transportation, but I'm seriously considering getting
5 other people together and renting an RV. Brian Denny has already 
expressed an interest in coming along, but of course the more the
merrier. We're both pretty flexible about arrival (although the
closer to Wednesday the better).

So if you have no secured plans and don't mind spending 5 days with
random strangers, then drop me a line or call. My home/voicemail/pager
number is listed in my sig.

Cybertribe,
 
Well, I'm finally back on the East Coast and back at work after spending
ten days out in San Francisco.  I flew out on Friday, August 9th, and flew
home on Sunday, August 18th.  I stayed the whole time with friends in
South San Francisco and San Jose, but had rented a car to be able to get
around on my own.
 
This was the fourth time I was out there in the last four months.  What
can I say?  I had such a great time every other time I visited for a
weekend, that I keep going back.  I had met a girl in particular who I
thought was completely amazing, and that got me thinking a lot about
moving out there permanently.  So, I decided that I should go out there
for at least a week and see if SF was really for me.
 
The first time I ever went to San Fran was four years ago the week of my
21st birthday.  I stayed with a friend from college and my best friend
from Minnesota had joined me there.  This last trip was *exactly* four
years later, and brought back tons of memories of that time.
 
Sunday, August 11th was my 25th birthday, but this definitely was not the
best birthday of my life.  I did get to spend some of it with my friend
Sandra from Princeton, NJ who is living in San Jose (and who is the
nicest, most caring, most understanding person I have ever met).
 
I don't know if this time I could actually say I had the time of my life 
this past week and a half because I had a lot on my mind and on my heart.
But nevertheless, it was very interesting and I learned a lot.  I
also got to do a lot of soul searching.  I filled up the weekdays by
interviewing for jobs (which ended up being very gruelling), and the
nights by going out to parties.
 
I'm going to send a follow up message to list the parties and raves I went
to and DJed.  Peace to all the SF ravers that I got to meet and hang out
with.
 
One love.

Cybertribe,

Here's a list of the events/parties I checked out in San Fran this past
week:

8/9/96
------
Friday night, I went to a few parties: FedEx, Hunny(?) at the Deli, and
then to Nikita at 1015 Folsom St. to see Carl Cox blow the spot up.
 
 
8/10/96
-------
Saturday afternoon, this guy Mosha threw a party out in Richmond on the
Bay (at the Sunset spot) which I was going to spin at, but it got broken
up by the cops before we got there.
 
Saturday night was supposed to be this big party called "Nation" with
Sasha and John Digweed, but the cops didn't even let the party start.  So,
Jimmy Tennant from the Bagok Tribe threw a party at his place in South San
Fran and I DJed there for hours.
 
 
8/11/96
-------
Sunday morning, went out for a birthday breakfast (yummy =] ).
 
Sunday evening, hit the "Sunset" party at Richmond.  Fukin' phat.  Saw a
few SF ravers there and NYC raver Mike Gee.  I was introduced to this girl
Toni from Rhode Island by Raf and Jan, and we bought tickets for Nation
off them which was moved to that 1015 club.  People cheered as the sun
went down.  Hella nice. ;)
 
Sunday night, went to the "Nation" make-up party and ran into DB from NYC!
Soooo funny to see him out there.  He invited me out to robot wars this
past weekend, but I never made it over there.  [DB if you read this,
sorry.  By the way, I still have your baseball cap from Structure last
year--I'll bring it up to Temple or something.]  I also finally talked to
Sandra Collins after meeting her exactly four years ago.  That is so crazy
that it's been that long.
 
 
8/12/96
-------
Monday night, went on rides at the Santa Cruz boardwalk. =]
 
 
8/14/96
-------
Wednesday night, DJed at "Groove" at the Deli. Carlos and Dreamer went off
as well. It was definitely slamming.
 
 
8/15/96
-------
Thursday night, checked out Funktion at the Maritime Hall and ran into
Kevin Gimball from Special K prods. in Philly and O'keef who spun there.
>From there we went to Natural at Mission Rock, and to ThurZdaze at the
Deli.
 
 
8/16/96
-------
Friday night was a crazy fukked up night.  After an interview at Organic
Online, I went down to Haight St. to eat and go to a couple shops and ran
into this girl from Seattle who was down in SF interviewing, too.  She
was buying tickets at that Frequency 8 record shop for the Harmony party
that night called "Beautiful People."  I had never heard of any of the
DJs, but kept it in mind for somewhere to go that night.
 
After going back and picking up the guys, we headed out to the Good Family
party, but it was pretty slow.  We didn't stay around long enough to find
out if King Britt ever made it out there.  Next, we stopped by Stompy but
Derrick Carter never showed (Mark Farina and Preston played).  After that,
it was off to the Deli where "Five" was going on.  It was overpacked with
waaaay to many heads in there.
 
My friends wanted to go over to some girls' house over in the East Bay,
so we ended up splitting up.  I wanted to check out this Irian Jaya party,
but had left the flyer at home with the info number on it.  How did that
go off???  I ended up driving back over to F8 alone to see if they were
still selling tickets for B.P.  They were closed, but a note on the door
said, "The party's at 150 Folsom St.  There still may be tickets
available.  Please come join us!"  I was like, "Right on!" (heh) and headed
over there.
 
This party was the *BOMB*.  I walked into this place and was just like,
"Now this is a party!"  The music was mostly trance, and I had no idea who
any of the DJs were.  All I know is that i danced a lot and I met "hella
people" there.  If you were there, please e-mail me...
 
 
8/17/96
-------
So, on Saturday, after going to bed around 3 in the afternoon, I got woken
up and dragged out to Antioch where this dude Sausee was having a house
party.  I spun there for a while, then we headed over to Jellys to see
Doc Martin spin a three hour set.  That guy is *AMAZING*.  The crowd was
so into it.  The place closed at 5am, and everyone was chanting for
"...ONE MORE SONG!!!"  Incredible.
 
 
8/18/96
-------
Visited a friend in San Jose, flew out of SF at 10pm, arrived in
Newark, NJ at 6am.  "Boy are my arms tired..."
 
 
SF has an amazing rave scene and it's much different from the New York
City scene in so many ways, that I don't even know where to begin.  I
just know that I love it, though.  There have been so many times in the
past year and a half where I've totally wanted to never go to another
party again and quit DJing because of how shitty the parties and the
people were here on the East Coast, but SF reminds you why you got into
it in the first place.
 
My SF trip was definitely an interesting experience despite it turning out
completely different than I had ever planned...
 
Peace,

Oh, not to worry, I'm sure there will be more.  =)

There were times, I remember, way back when, that the list would actually
go for a couple days nice and slow and calm.  I wouldn't panic...

Ah, there, see a nice person just posted about his visit here (DJ MARS).
Now that's uplifting!

     I know that SoCal raves have the graphics for their laminates 
     available on the Hyperreal site, as well as instructions for how to 
     print them.  We might consider that... You can also make your own 
     design.  If you have access to a computer (in this forum this IS a 
     rhetorical question), you can spark up paintbrush or macpaint or corel 
     or whatever it is you use.  Make a groovin design (we KNOW YOU CAN!!!) 
     Go to a kinko's or something if you want to print it out really nice.  
     Have it laminated.  Buy some really nice string.  Couple bucks tops.  
     Embrace your individuality while proclaiming your community.
     
     Peace,

Friends,
     
I know the guy who used to make the sfraves lamenants has moved away, I think

the friend's name is Terry!  But anyway, I was wondering if there is anyone 
out there that might know of a way that I could get my hands on one of those 
Lamenants?  If you do, please email me back directly with all the 411!

HEY BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE... IT'S A BRIGHT, SUNNY DAY!!   MUMSIE AND DADSIE HAVE
DECIDED TO LET ME LODGE AT THE HYATT (FISHERMAN'S WARF) THIS FRIDAY/SATURDAY,
ALL EXPENSES PAID.  A WELL DESERVED VACATION IF I DO SAY SO MYSELF.  I WAS
JUST WONDERING WHAT SORT OF UNDERAGE TROUBLE I COULD GET MYSELF INTO ( IN THE
SENSE THAT THERE WILL BE DANCING AND GOOD MUSIC INVOLVED).  IF ANYONE HAS ANY
INFO ON COOL SPOTS I COULD BE AT LET ME KNOW.  I'LL SEE YOU IN THE CITY.

Subject: Harmony tickets & how to get them...
To: sfraves@hyperreal.com
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com

Hello everyone,

    I have now gotten finger pains from writing each of you personally, 
so I'll do it all at once!... :)

    Harmony tickets are now availible, however they are not yet 
availibe in the stores. They are availible via MAIL ORDER only (right 
now). This was specifically geared for our mailing list, but hey you 
guys can jump on this too!!! 

    We are selling the tickets at stores starting September 1st. In the 
mean time you can purchase them from your own couch, in the comfort of 
your own home!!! 

    All you need to do is send the following:

1) Your complete name, or at least one that you will recognize in your 
mailbox.

2) Your complete address, including ZIP CODE!!!

3) A money order for the amount of $20, for each ticket you request.    
        For example, 1 ticket=$20 , 2 tickets=$40, etc.

    Please only send money orders, NO CASH, NO PERSONAL CHECKS, NO 
PAYCHECKS, AND NO MONOPOLY MONEY!!!! (and this includes Camel Cash)

4) Also, on a peice of paper tell us wether or not you would like to be 
on the Harmony/ Beautiful People mailing list. If you are already on 
it, then please do not sign up again. But if you are not on it, you 
should be! It's cool!!!


Now all you have to do is send these things to the following address:

HARMONY
Po Box 111084
Campbell Ca. 95011-1084

You might want to consider doing this quickly, cause they go on sale 
elsewhere during the BM festival, and we might sell out. We are not 
responsible for any lost or stolen tickets, and each ticket is 
irreplacable. (So please hold onto them!!!!)

Any other info will be given on our Voice Mails #'s 

(408) 486-9591  &  (408)450-3044

Hope to see you there!!!!!!!!

Peace and positivity,

Greg :)

Don't use aol if you have a choice. But if you don't have a www browser then
you'll have to go to the www through aol (I'm sure they have a space for
that). After that, find
www.hyperreal.com        and you're on your way, after that just keep
clicking on items related to what you want such as sfraves.

Lack of knowledge isn't stupid, not using the knowledge you have IS.

Go to Elevate next weekend! You can find info on the SoCal Raves section of
Hyperreal. It'll be in the Angeles Crest National Forest, and it'll be
guaranteed extra-PLURy. Actually, LA has a thriving techno scene. Just
don't look for clubs, because there aren't any worth speaking of. Louis XIV
host soccasional clubs, and there are a few others (Karma on Friday nights,
for example,) but avoid Magic Wednesdays at all costs!

Just check out the SoCal Raves Calendar. It's all there...

Have fun. I'll be at Elevate m'self!

Halleighluia!! (help me out w/the sp. on this Matt).  Excellent party.  I was
just a bit leary 
about going to a rave in a christian church, but was overwhelmed at the
amount of mutual respect and acceptance.  No false fronts, no "hey dudes, we
can relate to your people" type shit.  Honest to goodness good vibes
throughout.  Didn't know of the D.J.'s but they all played well.  The
organist's set at 6am was definitely the bomb.  Drummin on my new Djembe (:
was therapeutic indeed! Got to see some old friends and made some new, hi
Jonathan, Rachel, Lisa, Paul, Burger King! Big thanks to St. Johns!
Good to see progress towards scrubbin them age old stains off the walls of
Christianity.

I guess you didn't know that Monday, is a good day, cuz it's basically the
beginning of a new week with new experiences. Just don't get operated on or
buy a car made on that day.

Subject: Burning Man RV Rental!!!
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com

Hello fellow desert travelers!

I've found an RV company that's willing to rent me one for $109/day.
I think the price is definitely right, and I was glad to know that
they were renting three other RV's that were going to Burning Man.

So who's up for this? I've already received some interest from my last
message... The camper sleeps 6 comfortably, but I'm sure we could
squeeze in a couple of more if needed ;)

I'm planning on leaving Wednesday or Thursday, depending on when
others can leave. If you can afford this, and the idea of bathing
and having shelter appeals to you, please let me know as soon as
you can!!!

Thanks!

Steve

nother interesting book from the drug ere, was a book titled
Hows the Narcs Created Crack
documenting the creation of crack cocaine as a direct result of the war on
drugs, also deals with issues such as the unconstitutional use of the
military to enforce domestic policy.
i read it a long time ago (like 89?90?) and can;t remeber author, or even

Hey, I was just surfing the web and came across THE DJ. it a 24hr online
radio station on the web. It had techno, trance, hip-hop, and alot more
other stations. It's pretty cool, right now I'm listening to REZ off of
Logic Trance 2 on TheBeat channel and just listened to"Eternal Spirit" off
of Logic Trance 2. which was on the Trance station. On MegaBPMs channel
"WEB" by DR. Galactik on Circumference 01 is playing. Those are the ones I
have been listening to. They don't mix, just one after the other like
playing CD's I think it's just like the DMX channel that the cable company
has. This is cool.

Just goto (www.thedj.com) you might  need to get real audio first for your
mac or pc so goto www.realaudio.com for that.

The trance channel plays just that and MegaBPMs play techno. They must have
about 40 types of music channels.

Hello People!!!!

    I am sorry if some people on this list get offended that this is 
not rave related, but for me it is!!!! My early rave days were filled 
with the whole sesame street crew. Parading around parties, decked out 
in my favorite SS clothes, hugging my favorite SS charactors, and 
spending way too much money to do it was a part of my raving career! 
Take a look at the theme for the Beautiful People parties!! (Sesame 
Street has always and will always mean something for the Harmony crew)

    SS was, and is still a big part of some of our lives. What about 
our future generation(s)? What kind of programming will our kids get? 
World Wrestling Federation, shoot'em up cartoons, and sitcoms!! 
Mindless, thoughtless, and sometimes filled with violence!! Now tell 
me, when was the last time you saw Ernie throw Elmo out of a wrestling 
ring. SS shows kids how to be friendly and share with eachother. As 
well as teaching them how to read, write, and tie their shoes! I feel 
SS is extremely important, especially in today's society. So please, if 
you feel the same, put your name on this list, and send it out to 
everyone you know!!! 

Thank you,

Greg :)

Hey y'all.  
I hope I'm not out of line sending this to the list; I thought it was
important enough to send here.  I think there will be enough people on
here who will care about this issue, though in a great sense it is NRR 
(I
could make justifications for why it IS RRR :oD But I won't)
Ok, enough blabbering.  Here it is.  My apologies in advance for those 
who
may take offense!
love,
shamini


     
Save Bert and Ernie!!!!

Subject:        Petition to Save Sesame Street
     
This is a petition to save Sesame Street.
     
All you do is add your name on the list and then forward it to 
everyone you
know. The only time you send it to the included address is if you are 
the
50th, 100th, etc. Send it on to everyone you know.
     
PBS, NPR (National Public Radio), and the arts are facing major 
cutbacks in
funding. In spite of the efforts of each station to reduce spending 
costs and
streamline their services, the government officials believe that the 
funding
currently going to these programs is too large a portion of funding 
for
something which is seen as "unworthwhile."
     
Currently, taxes from the general public for PBS equal $1.12 per 
person per
year, and the National Endowment for the Arts equals $.64 a year in 
total.
     
A January 1995 CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll indicated that 76% of 
Americans wish
to keep funding for PBS, third only to national defense and law 
enforcement
as the most valuable programs for federal funding.
     
Each year, the Senate and House Appropriations commitees each have 13
     
subcommitees with jurisdiction over many programs and agencies. Each 
subcommitee passes its own appropriation bill. The goal each year is 
to have
each bill signed by the beginning of the fiscal year, which is 
October 1. In
the instance of the Corporation of Public Broadcasting, the bill 
determines
the funding for the next three years. When this issue comes up in 
1996, the
funding will be determined for fiscal years 1996-1998. The only way 
that our
representatives can be aware of the base of support or PBS and 
funding for
these types of programs is by making our voices heard. Please add 
your name
to this list if you believe in what we stand for.
     
This list will be forwarded to the President of the United States, 
the Vice
President of the United States, and Representative Newt Gingrich, who 
is the
instigator of the action to cut funding to these worthwhile programs.
     
If you happen to be the 50th, 100th, 150th, etc. signer of this 
petition,
please forward to: kubi7975@blue.univnorthco.edu. This way we can 
keep track
of the lists and organize them. Forward this to everyone you know, 
and help
us to keep these programs alive.
     
Thank you.

Hey, I was just surfing the web and came across THE DJ. it a 24hr online
radio station on the web. It had techno, trance, hip-hop, and alot more
other stations. It's pretty cool, right now I'm listening to REZ off of
Logic Trance 2 on TheBeat channel and just listened to"Eternal Spirit" off
of Logic Trance 2. which was on the Trance station. On MegaBPMs channel
"WEB" by DR. Galactik on Circumference 01 is playing. Those are the ones I
have been listening to. They don't mix, just one after the other like
playing CD's I think it's just like the DMX channel that the cable company
has. This is cool.

Just goto (www.thedj.com) you might  need to get real audio first for your
mac or pc so goto www.realaudio.com for that.

The trance channel plays just that and MegaBPMs play techno. They must have
about 40 types of music channels.

Anyone else going to Open this friday??  Looks like thats where I'm going to
end up.  Probably be going with a group of friends, but I hope to see some 
other familiar faces there and maybe meet some new people.  I'll more than
likely be wearing my white sailor hat that I've been wearing a lot recently, and
I'll probably have a pair of glow-sticks.

Hope to see you all there. :)

Hello,

I'm going to be in the SF Bay Area tomorrow for a few days and I'd
like to know what are the best radio stations for dance music (and
possibly ambient music).    [I'm not naive enough to ask about
"rave/house/techno" radio stations, since I know we are fortunate if
there are a few late night show devoted to our music.]

Please respond quickly, as I will be leaving Thursday morning (and
won't have e-mail access while I'm down your way).

PS  Info on anything else that is relatively new would also be
appreciated (ie "the best new Indian restaurant just opened at
.....").


Thanks,

Ken                         <*>

I only caught the tail end of this cia thing, so I apologize if I'm
repeating things already discussed...I've heard similar reports about crack
and its true importers, and I find it fascinating (and extremely
frightening).  Part of me wants to dimiss it as conspiracy paranoia, but
when you consider what's going on socially with crack, it seems
all-too-perfect.  ( I use the word "perfect" loosely).  You introduce crack
into an social class that is "undesirable" (and therefore a potential
powderkeg), and some interesting things start to happen:
1. When you smoke crack, you think about only one thing: smoking more
crack.  Therefore, your mind
    is not focused on your horrible living conditions, or on *doing*
anything about your living                  conditions.  All you need is
another rock and you'll be set.  And another, and another...

2.  Find a crowd of peoples who have been oppressed and in poverty for 400
years and offer them a way to get rich quick, (ie by selling something that
is illegal and very much in demand), and what happens?  Violence.  The
crowd  destroys itself from the inside out.

The thought genocide taking place in such a subtle and unprovable way is, I
think, scarier than anything the Snazi's ever did.  If any of this has been
planned,  it's an extremely diabolical plot and I'm not to sure how
comfortable I feel with this government hanging over my head.

If anyone else has any ideas, or have read anything about this, please
share it!  None of us is free unless we're all free!

SUBJECT: SW-NRR: Farewell & Seeking Some Help
Some What NRR...

 To those that may be interested I will unfortunately be involuntarily
 unsubbing from SFRaves.  Since the "re-sizing" (new buzzword!) fairy
 struck yesterday I will no longer have this email account, and the
 job that went along with it, as of this Friday.

 I will definitely be going to Burning Man (transpo TBD) though!! Hopefully
 will see many of you out in the desert.

 For those that I have not already told, and that may be many given the
 swirl of chaos this week, please email me here and I'll provide all
 necessary contact info.  If you don't get this note until Friday,
 please use:  rapier@trex.org

 I'll miss you and all the enjoyable discourse until I get back on-line.
 (the above "rapier" addy is completely incapable of handling the volume
  that SFR generates.)

 Of course since I am to-be unemployed I am blatantly seeking job
 information and contacts.  Please contact me privately for more
 details - certainly would be appreciated.

 Thanks for your patience and caring if you've read this far!

 Hugs to all,

  R

And even more clever, use the erupting violence to build stronger law
enforcement agencies and introduce new laws restricting the personal
rights/freedom of everybody, "for the good of all". Create conditions were
forfeiture of the property of citizins, bugging their houses and having
kids tell on their parents is accepted by society.

I doubt though if such a thing could be though up by the CIA, it would
require intelligence. For now they would be mostly interested in selling
drugs to invest the profits in secret military/political scams outside
the US, I guess.

Don't confuse "government programs" (usually the works of fumbling
politicans cheesing between John Q. Public and Dick C. Stockholder), with
the CIA, which isn't really considered the brains behind "gov't programs"
as we know them.  Most CIA conspiracy theorists agree that the spooks are
diabolical, clever and operate independently of the White House and Capitol
Hill.  Who knows if any of it is true, but their are many people who
believe it's true.  Then again, my old landlord plans to lead the human
revolt when the aliens land.  Who nose what's real and what's paranoia?

all "stories" that people hear, or read do contain some truth. but by the 
time the general pubic get word of this "information" it usually doesnt 
contain all the facts, and is usually twisted in a certain direction.

as for someone saying that the CIA operates and acts alone is completely 
wrong. the CIA does what the president tells them to do. after the 
president gives an order, the CIA will find the best way to deliver.


just a thought for all of you.

It would appear to very real considering that the Mercury has recently 
declassified docs to show some very good links.  And I do believe it is 
very true.

I'll give the CIA the benefit of the doubt though and not say that they 
were targeting blacks...they just wanted to make some money so they 
hooked a supplier who had connections to Nicaragua and the Contras there 
with a potential dealer in Rick "Freeway" Ross who happened to be from 
South Central who had lots of gang connections.

It was the bumbling bureaucrats who indirectly targeted blacks by 
creating minimum sentencing laws and such.  Since a professor stated that 
crack is about 50 times (he was forced to put a number on it) more addictive
or powerful as powder cocaine and given the get tough on crime stance 
that number became 100 times more addictive the lawmakers decided to make 
the minimum sentence for crack offenses 100 times more restrictive that 
powder offenses.  So one ounce of crack gets you the same jail time as 6 
pounds of powder.  This is where blacks get singled out.  A majority 
of crack arrests involve blacks whereas powder offenses usually involve 
whites.  This is due to the relatively cheap prices of crack versus powder.

I must say I can't believe our gov't has done this when everyone gets so 
peaved about drug use...The recent figures came out saying that ~10% of 
kids aged 12-17 have tried illicit drugs.  Maybe this is because of all 
the misinformation and lack of education that the goverment gives us...

Later,
G

There are definitely elements within the CIA, and even more so in some other 
government agencies, that are operating without authorization from 
Congress or the President.  To learn more about these people and 
institutions, listen to Dave Emory Sunday nights from 7 to 11 on 89.7 
for the whole story.

What are you complaining about?  With Ameba on Haight Street Ameba will be
doing even better then they are now.  And it will be a great record store,
much needed after the moving of Rough Trade last year.  I can't wait!

It's simple. Clinton is an asshole. I think he took his namesake's
advice of "free your mind and your ass will follow" and so his mind
flew the coop and we're left with his ass. What a pathetic excuse for a
sell-out liberal. And Dole means "penis" in Iranian. They're two sides
of the same losing equation. Is the revolution on the SFraves calendar
yet?

I think he should leave the jokes for the comedians. They're not funny,
especially at his wife's (women's) expense. Fact is, we got this
golfin' goombah wanna-be hollywood sycophant running the country right
now -- but we'd be better off with Hillary, or Sox for that matter.

If Dole wins, he'll probaly croak within a year and we'll have a
fucking doofus ex-football player as president. Rah rah rah. Go team
go. What next, perhaps we can have pro-wrestler as president?? Tag-team
mud wrestling would certainly be easier for the amerikkkan populace to
understand than talk about taxes and defecits. Also, imagine the
adverizing profit that could be made and all those cute spandex
outfits! I've always thougth the WWF should be running things in the
first place.

I know this. Still a stupid joke. There's no excuse for bad humor. Of
course, we won't go into how the Red-Cross helped mutate simian immuno
deficiency virus into the AIDS plague in africa via their massive
dissemination of tainted monkey based vaccines. Nope. That would sound
too conspiratorial, expecially for a nice christian/white republican
woman like Mrs. Dole.

I personally would rather have a very good idea if there's any
ex-marine/CIA cocaine-dealing gun-runners lurking around the white
house (e.g. Oliver North wanna-be's). If they're so worried about this
kind of crap, then get rid of the goddamn FBI in the first place. But
hey, it's  all just "national security" when the republi-cunts are
asking for the info.

PS: ob-rave. i want everybody to know that I'm having a positively
wonderful day and I just want to ensure that everybody continues
beaming out yer infectious good vibes like fleas hoppin' offa dead rat.
Everybody have happy happy happy day!

So does anyone know the answer to this? If we show up at the trailer

 - Good point ... it'll be nice to have more choices in recorded music
in the area ( Amoeba/Ameba/Frequency 8/Streetlight/some other store I
can't remember the name of just yet ).

 I was mainly thinking of some poor person who was told (verbally) to
buy a ticket to Tribal Future at "Ameba", going instead to "Amoeba", and
being told there that "no, we don't have any tickets to this Tribal
Future thing!!!".

 Trivia Question - who was first in the SF Bay area, Ameba or Amoeba?
Might be a crucial question if any kind of silly-ass trademark
infringement legal hassle comes up. 
 
 Since I'm here - let me ask this to SFRaves again :

 Last post about the subject had the info that Pack-a-Bowl had been
cancelled awhile ago - still, one last night for not-quite-old time's
sake seems like a good idea to me.

  Don't forget HouseWares, also on Haight. Very nice people, and an
explanding selection of tapes and CDs. Ameba, F8, and Housewares all have
turntables for vinyl fanatics too. It's amazing how much good
techno/house/etc. you can score on that one street.

Subject: Ameba/Amoeba -> cd purchasing situation? 
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

I don't see this as much infringement. Amoeba on Telegraph has never been
interested in the whole House music genre. I used to be a really dedicated
customer of this establishment. Until I started buying mainly House types o'
music. I actually haven't been there in a year or so because they had the
same house music cd's a year ago that they had 3 years ago. If this situation
has changed please correct me. Amoeba on Telegraph is still in my opinion the
best place to buy used rock-n-roll cd's. This is there specialty. I actually
wish they would change there possition and sell more house music. This would
drop the prices on house music at Rasputins which seem high. Rasputins also
burns through house music buyers. So there selection of new house music
varies with the buyer. There are periods when they buy alot o' house and
periods when they buy lots o' trance and periods when they buy lots o'
ambient. Rasputins has by far the best house music selection and price on
"cd" of any stores I've been to in the Bay Area. If others disagree I would
greatly like to open a forum on this subject. Another good option is
electronic ordering o' cd's. I found a url http:\www.gemm.com which has a
large search engine for searching music with options to buy from different
venders throughout the country. I haven't purchased anything here yet but the
prices seem resonable. They sell vinyl this way also. If its in print they
have it. If its not they may still have it. Have a great day, PEACE! Cid

rasputins used to be one of my favorites but their selection has gotten
really bad and except for used stuff I rarely buy anything there now, but
I hear they recently got a new buyer so things might improve. 

mod lang (on university) isn't the best place for house music, but in
general I think they have a better selection of "electronic" musics than
amoeba or rasputins... 

selection-wise I think soundworks (valencia/clinton park) is one of the
better places for cd's (and vinyl) in the bay area, and they let you
listen before you buy (unlike the east bay shops).  the prices are good
too.  and lots of house... 

openmind (divasadero/oak) doesn't have the largest selection, but some
real gems have been known to pop up in the used section from time to time,
and the buyer (tomas) knows his shit. definitely worth checking out...

I recently picked up a flyer for a new place opening up at the end of the
month in oakland called dropbeat, supposedly they will do mailorder and
will have a web interface...

probably the best www mailorder place I've found is modernmusic
(www.modernmusic.com), out of baltimore.  they can get most anything,
their prices are good, and the service is excellent (my last order was put
in on a friday afternoon and arrived monday).

Well, it's that time of the year to pack up and head back down to school.  

Just my thanks to those of you I met this summer and to those I never got a
chance to meet, see you SOON!!!

And if any of you head down toward to LA area, feel free to e-mail me at my
school address.  I've only been to a couple parties down there, but it's not
the same, it's not San Francisco!  Any suggestions to those of you who are
familiar with the scene down there?  

I've only been to Family, and I'm set on going to Moontribe's out in the
desert.

Well, I'll be back in December, or actually the end of September (Hemp
Festval in Golden Gate Park).....  :-)

Hugs & :-),

Hi it's me again.

Just wanted to find out about a tape I'm looking for.  A tape of mine got
ripped off and I can't find it anywhere in the stores -

                             (Jeno) - Inside the Mind.

If anyone knows where I can find it, please E-Mail me before tomorrow
(Friday).

Don't you hate it when someone "borrows" something from you and you never see
it again??????

Thanks so much!!!  :-)   :-)

They did, but he was quickly frustrated and won't be working there.

The main electronic/house buyer for Mod Lang has left to start a store
called Dropbeat, which'll open on 8/30 in Oakland. Considering his UK
connections this should be a killer shop.

Only if they have decks there.  (Think they will?)  Mod Lang has lots of
great stuff, but no turntables, which is frustrating.  Of course, if you
know music as well as THE Joe Rice, I'm sure it's not a problem...

=)

TR

P.S.  Was it here that I heard Mod Lang doesn't have decks on site because
the needles kept getting swiped?  Sounds like an opportunity for an
invention:  Needle Locks...Anyone?

Ha - you should see my pile of ill-chosen used record store buys. One day
I'll melt them all down and make a special vinyl DJ suit to wear so I can
get into 1015 on a Saturday night. =)

One of the major points made to me by Mike, who's opening the store, was
that they will have listening stations.

Greetings SFRavers from Sunny San Diego,

  Well,  I'm finally settled into the Loft,  A really hip community of
ravers,  graphic artists, DJ's and Video producers here in DownTown
San Diego.   We got a T1 link to the net,  and I have my own 7200 Power
PC with 128 Megs and stock full of the latest and greatest Java,  C++
tools and tons of graphics programs.

  I'm their Web master and System Admin,  which is really needed around here,
as not that many people are computer savvy.

  Anyway,  I'm doing my first gig as a DJ at Orgasm this friday,  and doing
video at Blitscrieg in LA on Saturay for my first Hardcore rave.

  Anyway,  I'm trying to get Justin's Email address,  the guy where I
stored some of my stuff,  so if he's still on the list,   please Email
me,  because after Burning Man,   I'm going to have to get this stuff..

  Anyway,  we're working to establish a strong rave scene down here in
San Diego dispite the fact that it's so oppressed and such a strong
police resistance to raving down here.   Nore than 90% of attempted parties
get busted,  and it's almost impossible to get permits to do anything.

  Anyway,  just checking in to let you folks know whats going on....

One more thing...  I still haven't cleaned up the mess made by the
Uni_mail bomber,  but since ho also bombed the whitehouse.gov site,
the secret service is stirred up like a nest of angry hornets...  and
soon I think he'll be busted...  In the meatime,  I'm using crunch@vcomm.net
as my main address.

  Radion says hi...

Crunchman

All,
	Can any one recommend some good record pools
(are they worth the money?) for music styles of acid
house, breakbeat, and trance? It's been a couple of years
of buying from the stores and I wanted to check out alter-

hi Troy,
Maybe you could post to some of your lists about the part time position
here at graphic imagery....

The candidtate must be a high school graduate, attending school for or have
an interest in graphic design and printing. We do not actually have presses
on site, we do all the pre-press organization and production.
Mac skills are a plus. We would like someone to make back-ups and archives
of our computer files, output information sheets, make copies, etc. Ability
to do so and familiarity with macs will be necessary.
The position pays $8.00/hour. There will be miscellaneous duties such as
packaging or handling shipments, filing paper samples, updating list of
works in progress, archiving and backing up mac files. Duties may vary from
day to day and so do the hours. It would be ideal to have someone on
Fridays but the exact hours and days are flexible. We need someone for 3-4
days a week for about 20 hours total/week.  We are a green company with
many great learning opportunities for the right individual.

Fax/send your resume to:

Yup, Yup!  Last year was the crazyiest year for me.  Party Friday,
Saturday, sunday morning afterparty and sunset...every weekend.  Even week
days.  This year I've been more selective and appriciate every experience.
Next month I move away to school (San Luis Obisbo) and I will finally get a
chance to work on someing for my self.  My school/career/life.  Raving will
always be with me.  But it's just my time to take a break.  One good thing
- i'm very central to both socal and norcal scenes so if i get the chance
I'll be back here and down in LA to chech out a new scene (for me).

I go for the music, to dance, and the great, interesting and fun people you
meet.  In that order.   I will finally go out this weekend.  I haven't been
to a party since....  hmmmm...  Unity in July.   Any good sugestions???

Yes!

I finally got mail.  I guess I should have unsubed, cuz I had over 1000
emails to skim/delete.  Went to 5 on friday around 2 am (I worked my last
day and my boss made me stay at work till 1 am.  can u say Dikhead)  By
this time most of my friend were already in the city so i went by myself.

5 was at THE deli.  I heard no sound walking up to the door (probably
muffeled by all the people) and security said they weren't letting anyone
else in.  ??   I guess they were closing at 3 am. and were charging 10
dollars for an advertized "give back 2 da scene" 5 dollar party.  What the
fuk?  I got to peek in and the place was so packed you couldn't move 5
feet.  Well, this wasn't gonna ruin my evening soooo....

 i met this guy josh passing out flyers for Good Family by 3 high guys.
Don't these guys help with ThurZdays?  Well a new promoter a new party.  So
I went.  Ten bucks.  ( the flyer say 13.oo presale?)  Young crowd but
Astryl Matrix was on.  Yeah he was!  Danced for awile.  Talked to a few
friends I knew but I was in more of a dancing mood so I didn't met too may
people.  Watched a little Star Wars.  Got my pipe'o'green took/toked and
returned.  And left around 4.30 cuz It's been a hard week at my new job.

	Don't be too sure.  The CIA may be stupid (or there may be a plot to 
make us think they're stupid, propogated by James Bond movies), but they've been 
at this game for awhile.  Here is a quote from an interesting article I found on 
the net (http://home.dti.net/lawserv/leary.html):

                 Copyright 1994 Osprey Productions/Grand Royal

   Was Timothy Leary a CIA Agent? Was JFK the "Manchurian Candidate"? Was the
                  Sixties Revolution Really a Government Plot?

                          Tinker, Tailor, Stoner, Spy

                                by Mark Riebling

[...]

1969: Leary critics will eventually point with suspicion to his close
connections during this time to an international LSD-smuggling cartel,
the Brotherhood of Eternal Love, which is rumored to be a CIA front.  The
Brotherhood is controlled by Ronald Stark, whom an Italian High Court
will later conclude has been a CIA agent since 1960, and the
Brotherhood's funds are channeled through Castle Bank in the Bahamas, a
known CIA "proprietary." For two years Leary lives at Brotherhood
headquarters, located on a ranch in Laguna Beach.  During this period,
the Brotherhood corners the U.S.  market on LSD and begins distributing
only one variety of the drug, "Orange Sunshine." Stark says he plans to
distribute the product to CIA-backed guerillas fighting Chinese
occupation; he reportedly knows a high-placed Tibetan close to the Dalai
Lama, and wants to provide enough LSD to dose all Chinese troops in
Tibet.  In the U.S., meanwhile, Stark provides enough Orange Sunshine to
dose the hippie culture and radical left many times over.  This is the
"bad acid" on which Charles Manson's followers murder Sharon Tate, and
on which Hell's Angels stab to death a black man during a concert by the
Rolling Stones.  The Summer of Love has been supplanted by a Season of
Hate.  Because of this, many countercultural insiders -- including
William S.  Burroughs, White Panther leader John Sinclair, and Merry
Prankster Ken Kesey -- will eventually entertain the theory that Stark,
Leary, and Orange Sunshine are all part of CIA plot to discredit and
neutralize the radical left.  According to former radicals Martin Lee
and Bruce Shalin, widespread use of Orange Sunshine "contributed
significantly to the demise of the New Left, for it heightened the
metabolism of the body politic and accelerated all the changes going
on...  In its hyped-up condition, the New Left burned itself out."

Looks like a lot of people are looking for the ultimate rave this
weekend. This'll be my last weekend for a looooong time :(, so I'm 
looking for a great one to go out on. I have fliers for Hallucination
and Omniscience, both of which look good. Any opinions out there?

 Well I have a bias as I'm working at Hallucination so I'll refrain from 
commenting except to say that Hallucination will be more hardcore acid/trance
with Omniscience looking to be more House oriented (It's being brought to 
us by the SF House collective).

 I'm sure both will be outstanding parties.

Go to Open!  Go directly to Open!  Do not pass Go, do not collect $200!
Instead, get there b-4 11pm, bring a flower, and get in for $10 :)  This
sounds like a mind-blowing experience, so let's go out into the East Bay
and celebrate Openness :):):)

Love,
Eric

Hi All

Anyone interested in sharing a van to/from Burningman? Putting 5 people
in a seven-seater rental van will cost $80+gas per person, and leave
enough room for a couple of bikes and lots of gear.

We'd be leaving late Thursday afternoon. South/East bay pickups
preferred but not essential.

If you're interested, email or leave a message at my work number ASAP.

Jeremy

     Have any of you heard the BT album "IMA" : I'm listening to it here at 
     work and I gotta say it's absolutely amazing, deliciously spun housey 
     trance.
     
     I'm well pissed that the whole Nation debacle meant he didn't do his 
     PA. Btw, were many of you at 1015 on the Sunday, and who stayed for 
     Sasha ?
     
     
     Peace.

Friends,

Hey y'all, I just wanted to let everyone know, that I have my first interview
as a teacher @ 4pm tomorrow.  It's for a 1st, 2nd, or 3rd grade class.  The
school district has openings for all three grades, so they are doing one big
interviewing session, and interviewing teachers for all grades!  I hope to
get a 3rd grade job, but I'll be happy with a 1st or 2nd grade job as well!

Wish me luck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Your friend,

Antone!

Hi all!

 I'm looking for a few good ravers to help me set up at Hallucination on 
Saturday. Also need to be available for tear down at the end of the 
evening. I already have my ride covered. Interested people should contact 
me here and leave a phone #. I'm hoping for folks that I know or know 
someone I know. Any tech, systems design folks are super and of course 
live events experienced people are ideal.

 Gaurenteed free admission is your pay and the more folks that help the 
easier it is. No whiners puhlease. :)


Hopin' your tank is full,


Ran @ Dionysus Dreams

 errr - what's the symptom that reveals this needle's "fat" condition? 
Skipping tracks? Lousy high end? Faint sound? Tonearm wanders about
like a drunk moth circling a flame?

 OR - does the speed control have "78" as one of the speed options?
Is "78" the ONLY speed option?!!?
>

 Depends - what make is it now? What make is the turntable? Can you see
four little wires coming out the end of the cartridge, or is the end of
the cartridge round and attached to the tone arm such that you can't see
the wires that carry the signals from the cartridge ? Or ....?

 awaiting more data -

Subject: NRR...just a story I heard once (somewhat long)
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

I was in a very trying period in my life a fews years ago...struggling to
make sense of this senseless world, struggling to see through the layers of
muck and grim, and struggling to discover answers to some very profound
questions.  I found more traps than anything else in the maze, but I did
meet up with some very interesting people at that time.  A man who claimed
he was the 'most powerful being I would ever meet' told me a story.  

Of course he was a liar about his "power", but he did stir something within
my mind.  With tears in his eyes, he was not only engulfed in the story, but
acted as though he actually remembered what he spoke of...

"Once upon a time, beyond what many know and find courage to remember, a
very large group of children lived in a special place created by a being who
was wholly gentle and loving, but all powerful.  The being was called God. 
Since the children were created in His image, they were quite 'powerful' by
today's standards.  The children grew quickly as did their abilities to
create.  They created music, art and other forms of expression all without
the assistance of instruments or paint or paper.  But their jealousy of each
other grew, and they began to create other things as well.  Ugly things.   

The children began to squabble and bicker.  They gathered only to fight.
Over Time they became prideful of their "power" and grew to disregard their
Father, God, because they felt He was too powerful. They slowly grew to
resent God, for He could do anything.  But He just gave them love, and this
was all He desired in return.  For to God, these were His children.  As Time
passed, the children fought more and more with each other and ignored God
completely.  They elected a "power" whore to be their leader. They wanted to
be Gods, not children.  All of them, that is, except for a young boy.  

There was a boy was a bit different.  He liked being a child to God because
he loved God.  He was in awe by God and sat and watched him every day.  This
boy appreciated his own talents but did not consider them as "power", as the
others did.  So while the others sought to learn more "powers", this boy
simply sat by God's side whenever he could and listened and watched.  This
was where this boy was most happy.  To this boy, Love was the "gift".

But strife broke out in the special place and the children began to fight.
They began to make war against their brothers and sister.  Sinister, secret
wars full of manipulation and greed.  When these wars of illusions began,
the young boy would call out to the other children...in a very special way.
He would beg them not to fight with his heart and his soul.  They could hear
his words but his lips did not move.  He would remind them of the beauty of
their great Father.  But they would not listen.  They rebelled against him.
They played tricks on him.  They often tried to hurt him.  Still yet, he
sought only to remind them of Love.  Of all they had.  The children despised
him for speaking truthfully.  They secretly hated him because of his love.
The children began to hate him and vowed to teach him a lesson.  Who was
this boy...speaking to them all the time about Love?  After all, they were
Gods!  How dare he speak to them about such things?!?  He was just a boy!  

One day, when the boy was speaking to the other children, they gathered
together in a place where he could not feel them.  They stood before him,
but he could not feel what they thought.  What they felt.  They had hidden
themselves in anger and secret hatred.  Suddenly, the other children focused
all their "power" and energy together and directed it at the sky.  A large
fire-ball appeared.  It swirled and shimmered with unspeakable heat.  It was
filled with their anger.  Their pride.  Their greed.  Their lust.  Their
hate.  It was huge.  It was horrible.  Instantly, the children directed the
fire-ball towards the young boy.  It moved with lightning speed and struck
the young boy before he knew what hit him.  He feel to his knees in pain.
It seared his flesh.  It ripped open his young heart.  It scortched his mind
and burned the young boy completely.  It destroyed the boy.  His screams had
been horrific.  His pain unimaginable.  And within a mere matter of moments,
the young boy existed no more.  Only ashes.  Not even his memories remained. 

The children stood before a pile of ashes, and for the first time, they knew
regret.  They had destroyed something beautiful.  They had destroyed it for
nothing.  And that is what remained.  Nothing.  Fo God appeared instantly.
He was horror stricken by the ashes he saw before him.  It was a loss which
could never be replaced.  In fear, the children tried to destroy God with
another fire-ball, as they had killed their brother.  They focused all of
their powers against God, but they failed.  For God's power was absolute.  

God's tears filled the skies. WHY?!?  Why have you destroyed someone I loved
so dearly?  There was not an answer. In His anger, he condemend the wicked
children to feel Life no longer, and he tore what remained of His love away
from them.  He scattered the children to the four winds and the earth
swallowed them up. Only after learning the value of what they had destroyed
could they ever come together again.  Only after finding what remained no
more, could they be made whole.  Sadly, the lesson remains unlearned..."

I have to agree with your assesment of BT.  I've been a big fan of his for the 
last couple of years, and his "Ima" album is absolutely amazing.  



>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

     
     Have any of you heard the BT album "IMA" : I'm listening to it here at 
     work and I gotta say it's absolutely amazing, deliciously spun housey 
     trance.
     
     I'm well pissed that the whole Nation debacle meant he didn't do his 
     PA. Btw, were many of you at 1015 on the Sunday, and who stayed for 
     Sasha ?

I didn't see anything about the party 
omniscience (8/24)
on the calender.  Does anyone have any info about this party.  It looks like it has 
great potential with a killer line-up.

Well, it looks like I'll be going to Open and Hallucination this weekend.  
Since I'm not going to Burning Man and won't be around the weekend after that I
need to get in as much as I can this weekend. :)  Hopefully my body will be able
to take it.  So for those of you not going to Open tonight maybe I'll see you
at Hallucination.

Okay, I'm kinda bummed about this so maybe someone can help me out.

I have an Apotheosis "O'Fortuna" album.  Unfortunately it somehow got a piece
of what appears to be gum stuck to one side of it.  A lot of people use this
record so I have no idea how it happened or who did it.  It is dried on pretty
good.  Anyone have any idea how I might get it off without damaging the record?

It only effects about the first 45sec of side 2 so it is still playable but I 
would like to get it off since the record is out of print.

thanks,
jay

I *believe* I've heard that rubbing alcohol will not damage the grooves,
but please please please don't use it until someone who knows for sure
backs up this idea.

hmmm.. anyone remember that simpson's episode where bart threw gum in lisa's
hair, and marge spent the whole episode trying different substances in
lisa's hair to get it off? - eventually just making a big mess and having to

  Hey... I'm still going to San Fransisco on Saturday and I need to know what
sort of UNDERAGE trouble I can get into.  Hallucination sounds good but the
voice mail doesn't tell me where it's at.  What a quiet weekend to go to the
city.  If worse comes to worse I can get my walkman and trip down the street
to some funky tunes in my own little world.  ( Hey, who cares if those people
think I look like I need to be locked up?)  I need to feel the beat.   Let me
know what's happening... I'll be checking my e-mail all day for responses
before I leave tonight.  Thank you beautiful people for making my weekend so
bright.  Oh, and pounce?  Here's some warm fuzzies coming your way to scare
off the evils that have been bugging you.  Have a great weekend everybody....
I'll see you in the city.

Hey, has anyone heard anything about the movie Synthetic
Pleasures?  Seems like the music will be ambient/techno,
here's a synopsis from the web site (www.syntheticpleasures.com) 

"Is reality obsolete? From low-tech function like body piercing
and artificially-stocked fishing pools, to the latest in bionics and
VR gaming, Iara Lee's cyber-age intellectual survey - call it a
*.DOCumentary - downloads a Future Shockful of data and
defines the parameters of advanced technologies that delete nature
and reprogram mankind. Cryonics defy death; the Internet exists
outside time and space; smart drugs and surgery upgrade the
mind and body. But are we headed toward human optimization,
or system crash? Timothy Leary, RU Sirius, Lisa Palac, John
Barlow and others offer sound bytes against a mesmerizing
screen display of cutting edge computer-graphics and archival
clips. Exhilarating and disturbing, Synthetic Pleasures raises
issues nobody today can afford to abort / retry / ignore."

Sounds like it could be good, could be bogus, but probably worth
a look!  It'll be showing in SF, Berkeley, San Jose, and Palo Alto
so maybe we could get one or more groups together.  

One more thing, the web site has, of all things, a Glossary.
Here's their entry for "Rave:"


       rave: usually refers to a party, usually all night long, where loud
       "techno" music is mostly played and many people partake in a
       number of different chemicals, though the latter is far from
       necessary. At a rave, the DJ is a shaman, a priest, a channeller of
       energy - they control the psychic voyages of the dancers through
       his choice in hard-to-find music and their skill in manipulating
       that music, sometimes working with just a set of beats and
       samples, into a tapestry of mindbending music. A large part of
       the concept of raves is built upon sensory overload - a barrage of
       audio and very often visual stimuli are brought together to elevate
       people into an altered state of physical or psychological
       existence.

P.S. No, I'm not affiliated with them in any way, there's just flyers

Hey, we've all got to lighten up about death every once in a while...:


1994's MOST BIZARRE SUICIDE

       At the 1994 annual awards dinner given by the American
       Association for Forensic Science, AAFS President Don
       Harper Mills astounded his audience in San Diego with the
       legal complications of a bizarre death.  Here is the story.

       "On 23 March 1994, the medical examiner viewed the body
       of Ronald Opus and concluded that he died from a shotgun
       wound of the head.  The decedent had jumped from the top
       of a ten-story building intending to commit suicide (he
       left a note indicating his despondency).As he fell past
       the ninth floor, his life was interrupted by a shotgun
       blast through a window, which killed him instantly.
       Neither the shooter nor the decedent was aware that a
       safety net had been erected at the eighth floor level to
       protect some window washers and that Opus would not have
       been able to complete his suicide anyway because of this.

       "Ordinarily," Dr.  Mills continued, "a person who sets
       out to commit suicide ultimately succeeds, even though the
       mechanism might not be what he intended.  That Opus was
       shot on the way to certain death nine stories below
       probably would not have changed his mode of death from
       suicide to homicide."

       But the fact that his suicidal intent would not have
       been successful caused the medical examiner to feel that
       he had homicide on his hands. "The room on the ninth floor
       whence the shotgun blast emanated was occupied by an
       elderly man and his wife.  They were arguing and he was
       threatening her with the shotgun.  He was so upset that,
       when he pulled the trigger, he completely missed his wife
       and the pellets went through the window striking Opus.

       "When one intends to kill subject A but kills subject B
       in the attempt, one is guilty of the murder of subject B.
       When confronted with this charge, the old man and his wife
       were both adamant that neither knew that the shotgun was
       loaded.  The old man said it was his long-standing habit
       to threaten his wife with the unloaded shotgun.  He had no
       intention to murder her - therefore, the killing of Opus
       appeared to be an accident.  That is, the gun had been
       accidentally loaded.

       "The continuing investigation turned up a witness who
       saw the old couple's son loading the shotgun approximately
       six weeks prior to the fatal incident.  It transpired that
       the old lady had cut off her son's financial support and
       the son, knowing the propensity of his father to use
       the shotgun threateningly, loaded the gun with the
       expectation that his father would shoot his mother.  The
       case now becomes one of murder on the part of the son for
       the death of Ronald Opus.

       There was an exquisite twist.  "Further investigation
       revealed that the son had become increasingly despondent
       over the failure of his attempt to engineer his mother's
       murder.  This led him, Ronald Opus, to jump off the
       ten-story building on March 23, only to be killed by a
       shotgun blast through a ninth story window.

       "The medical examiner closed the case as a suicide."

TA-DA!!!- Alex

I don't know what you look for in a party, but I think this will be the one
to go to tonight.
Also, though I can't testify personally, I have heard "rave" reviews about
Davenport & Trance.

 Based on my experiences with Jeff Dullum, who is one of Nexus' key
coordinators, they are very much committed to our collective purpose in
this ravedance we do.  The most unique element of their parties, I think,
are the chill rooms, which tonight, as with 2nd Chakra, will feature free
massages from massage therapists, *live* butterflies flapping around
(can't quite figure that one out yet),  acupuncture, and aromatherapy
(Huh?).  Nexus is also interesting in that they work with local artists,
displaying sculptures and paintings at their venues, and performance art
(e.g. the lady dancing with a chandelier on her head at 2nd Chakra)  Also,
there will be many, many many pillows to swallow you.

If you have any toys that talk, make sounds, etc (preferably of an
"ambient" nature), please bring them to the chillroom and talk to one of
the geeks behind the turntables...there will be an interactive ambient band
playing...we want to sample your toys and/or your beautiful voices.

The party definitely is in the East Bay tonight.  Directions will be posted
at 5pm.  Call the # on the calendar.

Ok, so anyway...

This man joins a monastery and takes a vow of silence.  In taking his vow 
though, he is allowed to say two words every five years.  After having been 
in the monastery for five years, the monk approaches the abbott and says, 
"Bed.  Lumpy."  These being his two words, he is silent for another five 
years.  After that time he meets with the abbott again.  He says, "Food.  
Terrible."  And again he is silent for five more years.  Then he comes to 
abbott one last time and, after five years of silence announces, "I'm.  
Leaving."  The abbott stands up and says, "Fine!  Leave!  All you've done 
since you got here is complain!"

The ameba/amoeba thing is exciting to me. Obviously I have little 
respect for intellectual property rights so it would be hypocritical for 
me to complain about a phonetic duplicity on Haight Street.No one from 
the Amoeba has said anything to us which I find rude. When people call 
us about Primus cds I just say we don't have any.I wish more young wierd 
people would open businesses on Haight. F8 has been a great addition.

Regarding the current 13 month calendar movement: I am entirely 
dissatisfied with the direction the Northern California representatives 
of this movement have been taking. I have formally announced the 
formation of the Thirteenth Collumn splinter group. Propaganda will be 
available soon.

Lately I have been contemplating the cautions of Eastern mystics in 
regards to Psychedelics. They say they cause holes in a persons aura. I 
had discounted this for a long time but I think as is the case for most 
mystic truths, often metaphors are needed to explain complicated things 
in a simple way.

PS: any HTML geeks know about the leftmargin or topmargin commands?

Greetings :
Since I just joined this list, I guess I should introduce myself.
My name is Bruce McDonough.  I'm a student at SFSU studying computer
science, and hope to graduate with a BS in May.  I've been in San
Francisco for almost three years, and have been to lots of parties.

My first one was a Full Moon Rave at Bonnie Doon Beach in September
(or October) 1993.  That event changed my life.  I'd never experienced
such a kind vibe before, and so many beautiful people.  And the music :)...
Since then I've been to Wicked (6 or 7 times), F&F (4 or 5), C-U (5 or 6),
Harmony, many many weeklies and other assorted parties.  Oh, yeah, about
4 BulletProof Boat Parties too.  I grew up in Escondido, Calif., about 30
miles North of San Diego since age 7, before that I lived in Connecticut.

I'm 28 now and look forward to graduating from school and (finally) maybe
making a decent living.  I've definitely had my share of diversions in
life.  I love rockclimbing, hiking, reading, writing, taking trips ;),
and DANCING.

I believe that the global house movement definitely is making the world
a better place, I just hope the kids don't lose it all to drug abuse.  Anyone
choosing to use any mind altering substance should definitely do the
reading and research required to make wise informed decisions.  Love is 
probably the only free high.

peace,
          Bruce McDonough

I KNEW that sounded familiar!  Hmmm... Maybe I should go back and
look at their glossary entries for "ecstasy" and "techno music"
too!  :)

     "Is Reality Obsolete"
     
     I don't mean this as a personal blast, but I'm getting kinda weary of 
     being reminded how awesome all this technology is.  Most of us are 
     actually sitting at computers (I do know people that print al of their 
     e-mail out before they read it, not too green if you ask me)... most 
     of us actually go to amazing parties, most of us dance and some even 
     make futuristic beautiful / scary / grooovin music.  I hate being 
     patted on the back when we're not even close!!!!
     
     The trailer looked stupid.  Too CYBER-Cool.  I'd rather just drop some 
     whatever (or not) and curl up with some friends I love and watch 
     Powaqquatsi (or the one before which I haven't the vaguest notion how 
     to spell) or something that's actually art rather than hyped up 
     techno-snivel.
     
     I would pay to see those gnarly FSOL images come to life (i.e. 
     Lifeforms domestic album cover or inner sleeve of domestic ISDN) ... I 
     just don't want some new thing with Leary going blah blah blah with 
     'shocking' new realizations while quoting Neuromancer and showing me 
     fractals.  It makes it look like we're dying (same place we were in 
     '89).  We have to evolve.  Does anybody feel we have to get past 
     "Strange Days" to pull this off?
     
     I think it's about being 'this way' for life, about having ideals we 
     can live with and doing it better than those before us, regardless of 
     the barriers or boundries every is so used to (age, color, blah, 
     blah).  Big deal, we have the tools (computers, communications, 
     connections).  Even Bill Gates has gotten over it and is now asking 
     "Where do you want to go today?".
     
     Pull for progress... remember the sense of possibilities you had after 
     the first rave that went off for you.  The togetherness, the 
     community, the not caring about the stupid stuff and being scared by 
     how much you cared about ideas and people and beauty and life and 
     breathing and touching and sharing.  The themes we all revel in remind 
     us of childhood, because that's the last time we felt it before it got 
     scared out of us.  Go back.  Find it.  And walk back into your life 
     with the gift of being reborn and honest for the first time.  I don't 
     expect anything from any of you, but you all amaze me with your 
     generosity and openeness.
     
     Love,
     AndyW

The strongest impression that my first rave left me with was "People NEED
this!"  At another party, I commented to a gal that I hope we can carry the
sentiments and ideals out of the parties and into the larger world, to
which she replied "We're planting the seeds right here."  Make it so!  :)

Hey all

Well I've been on this list now for almost year but it's been off and on.
I contribute when I can and so I decided to invite some of you all to a BBQ
on Spunday.

M=EE amigo Kiddee is having a BBQ for some friends on Sunday and asked me to
invite any cool ravers.  What better people to invite than the ones on this
list.  I can't ask all ya'll to come but those that are interested please
email me privately.

She plans on having a few of her friends spin.  I'm trying to get a friend
of mine to go out and I invite any dj's on the list that would like to come
and spin as well are encouraged to do so.  the place is in Concord.  The
time... hmmm.. aprox 1 pm???  not really sure on this one.  I personally
don't know all these people but if they are anything like the friends i
have met then it will be lots o fun wit cool people.

We'll probable head out to sunset after around 6 or 7.

Have a good weekend all.

:)

I was wondering if anyone could help a friend of mine out who
needs a ride to Burning Man (not back, however, as he can come back with me)
leaving from SF or somewhere not to far on friday evening after working
hours.  Surely someone has an extra seat they want to share with
a nice raver type guy.

If you can help, please write me email and I'll have him get a hold of you.

thanks,
-john.

     Just wanted to ask for a bit of help for this weekend. I won't be
dancing for a bit cuz I have an MX series to contend. I'll be racing this
weekend (sunday) for the first time since. . . the second time I tore
ligaments in my knee, which was about. . . two years ago??? Damn, has it
been that long?? See, I'm usually doing pretty well, but the past couple
years have just sucked. . . When I was 16, I was riding down by the bay near
my house with my friend and I landed wrong off a jump costing me an Anterior
Cruciate ligament, A medial collateral ligament, both my miniscus, and about
8 months. After the eight months was over, I was better then ever, I got
super-serious with my health and was pushing myself harder than ever to
improve. About six months later, I was practicing down at Little Oakie in
Madera when some dork's bike ghost rid in front of me causing me to his it
at about 45-55mph. I all remember was hearing the impact of the bikes and
then laying there with my bike (and a couple others) laying on top of me. My
knee again, hurt like hell, and I knew that I re-tore another ligament. I
did! That was  about another 5 months off my bike and then the second ride
back, I permanently broke my right foot. I broke my navicular in my foot, in
half, shattering one side into ???? pieces, and the other side was just
slightly crushed. The doctors recommended surgery but thaty would have just
made me worse off (they wanted to fuse my bone, limiting my movement in my
foot to barely anything). 
        Now it's about 10 months later and I'm ready to race again. I dance,
go to the gym, try to run, and ride. My foot kinda works, and it's better
than the doctors could ever make it. Just watch me dance and you'll see. But
watch me walk and you'll see how it effects me.
        So anyway, there's a brief history on me. I'm racing this weekend.
I'm gonna do my best. And I'm going to at least get top ten. Damn, I should
be intermediate by now, but I'm still just a lowely novice, one class away
from the bottom.

       So wish me luck!

Have fun boogying down all.

LUVYALL

Aryck

Hey all! 

Such cool things have been happening, what a great week this has been!
Ecto's coming to the Bay Area in time for my birthday (yippee!), I'm gonna
go up to visit Brenda & the Ahau Collective, BM's just around the corner, I
suddenly have two weeks of vacation, and the coolest thing happened to me
last night:  

For Burning Man, my co-worker Laurie was going to lend me some of her
camping things, like a tent, solar showers, etc.  Very nice of her!  Anyway,
after work yesterday I was supposed to go over to her house and pick these
things up.  So I head over there to do this, and she shows me all the stuff,
and we have a beer, and the evening progresses like you'd expect a normal
evening too progress. 

In the past Laurie has told me at various times about her family life & how
she relates to her husband and 15-year old daughter.  They're your typical
dysfunctional family, both she and a co-worker of ours (also a friend of
Laurie's) have told me stories of Laurie's daughter, and how she's gone
completely off the deep end, even to the point of having beaten up her
mother on a couple occasions.  Things have really gotten bad, and there is
almost no relationship between mother and daughter, it seems they pretty
much don't do anything but fight.  

So I come over, do the tent thing, do the beer thing, do the hang-out thing.
Laurie's daughter (Jennifer) eventually comes out, out of curiosity I would
assume, and talks to us some too.  Eventually, she finds out from Laurie
that I am a raver, and does eventually join in the conversation, talking to
me about how she wants to go to raves when she starts driving, and much to
my amusement produces that in/famous flyer we all remember from Lucky Charms
back in March!  I laugh & tell her what a joke that party was, and the
conversation has become pretty light hearted & amusing.  Eventually,
Jennifer pulls out her cd's and starts blasting them on the living room
stereo, mostly clubby stuff you'd hear on KMEL & whatnot.  It's funny to me,
because upon learning I was a raver, Jennifer really came out of her
sullen-teen shell and participated in the conversation, and became quite
lively, which was really nice.  She was still somewhat rude to her mother,
but it was an improvement.  So we're sitting there in the living room
listening to this music & talking about the rave scene & rave music, and I
think "hey, maybe I should play some of my mixtapes for her, maybe she'd
like them!"  So I hop up and run out to my car & grab my plastic produce bag
fulla mixtapes & such & bring 'em back in.  I pop one (a housier one,
perhaps an easier transition from clubby music than it would be to, say,
goa) in and start playing it.  So now we've got the stereo blasting with the
knob at 11, and Jennifer's up & boogying all over the living room floor,
havin a good ol' time, she really seems to like the music.  She says "jeez,
I could just dance for hours!" and keeps on going.  Then I hear Laurie,
who's sitting on the couch watching, say "hey!  I can dance for hours too ya
know!"  And before I know it, she's up and boogying too, and the two of them
are dancing their asses off in the middle of the living room with this
mixtape blasting at full volume!  So of course I hafta hop up and join them
so that all three of us are going, and it's then that I realize that two
previously entirely disparate people, an unhappy mother & daughter, with
nothing in common & no enjoyment of each other, have suddenly been unified
in the love of music and dance together, each with big smiles on their
faces, perhaps the only happy activity they've engaged in together in quite
a while.  This blew me away!  I mean, isn't this what a large part of raving
is about?  Again & again I am amazed by the unity I see in a large group of
people at a rave, even when people are off doing their own things.  I never
see anything like that anywhere else, and of course, with the same music
thumping at high volumes, I saw the same damn thing happen right in that
living room with just the three of us.  Folks, I think I just witnessed the
world's smallest rave! :)  And it may have only been temporary, I'm sure
things reverted back to normal after I took the tape out and left, but it
does give me hope for them (and others) that if even for a little while they
were able to put aside their problems & hurts, and just dance together.  Heehee!

And to you know-1'ers, you all be pleased to know that it just happened to
be Kenji's mixtape that did it! :)  Thank you Kenji!


Love,
Shawna

            
          Do not go gentle into that good night!
         Rave! Rave into the dawning of the light!

     earlier, i tried to post a party a friend is throwing tonight. The 
     party was not posted. Yeah, it's a commercial one, but...It's too late 
     to send it to the calender.
     Is there some sort of rule regarding this ?
     
     If anyone wants info, e-mail me.

yeah!!!!!  thank you for sharing that,. shawna!  at this very moment the
AHAU family are upstairs having the same type of experience with "the
poeple on the fourth floor".  basically, in th4e Modish building, teh 4th
floor tenants have been somewhat estranged from the rest of the building
bu through channeling love through our music and having our manifestation
classes, ect, we are unifying!  can't wait til you get here and love to

Shawna told such a great story about a mother and daughter and music and
dancing...

"Folks, I think I just witnessed the world's smallest rave! :)"


RIGHT ON SHAWNA!  I loved your story,it shows how music and dancing really
connect us all!

As I read it, it triggered a memory of a wonderful New Years Eve at home
with my mom (who was visiting from the east coast), my husband and my
daughter who was then around 11 years old.

We were just lounging around with a fire in the fireplace, listing to great
old jazz on the radio, and suddenly a cool song came on and we all got up
and danced, laughing and feeling silly at first ... and for the rest of the
evening, at any given point, at least 2 of us were dancing. Between breaks
for champagne and caviar (it was New Years after all!) I danced with my
mom, she danced with my daughter, my daughter and husband danced together.
My mom died four years ago, but I'll never forget that night, and I know
she loved it as much as I did.

Moral of these stories?  Dance with your moms and your dads, folks! Dancing
and music bring people together, and we don't need raves to do that!  It
may start off awkwardly, and you have to know when it's the right time and
choose music they'll find appealing, but share that wonderful part of your
life with them, too.

Love, Leslie

  My parents both decided to drop in on the rave that my brother and I
organized, back in Ottawa.  While my dad stayed only for a few minutes,
more a show of moral support than anything, my mom got drawn into the
music (DJ Sunshine, from seattle - who could blame her?) and danced with
us for an hour or so.  It was great!  I was glad that both she and my dad
got the chance to see me, my brother, and my older sister dancing, and
happy, and join us.  I think it helped them to understand us better.  That
was a great night!
  My mom even scared off some of the younger & more trendy ravers!  Go
mom!  & you should have seen the grin on her face.  She even danced (for a
few minutes) to some really hard jungle!
  Anyway, all this to say - I agree.  If dancing is an important part of
your life, share it with those you love!

The thing I always get to with this, is that at the end the question
is always one of freedom, and I think the holes then just become more
fuel for the fire... which then begs the question, just what sort
of blaze are you looking for.

Holding your balance is tricky though... burn too strong and it gets away
from you, gaping holes through the fabric of what we think we are,
leaving weak spots that catch us off guard and throw us for a loop,
but burn too weak and you get bored.

It's all good though, and you just gotta remember that the person
behind the mask is always you. 
the only one who will ever judge you is you.
and the only one that can set yourself free is you.


have a good weekend all, till BM...

Subject: Orgasm review
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com

Greetings,

Here's the latest reports from the Southland....  Ocean temp = 72 degress...
beaches at Coronado are amazing...

This evening,  went to Orgasm,  which a number of the DJ's from the loft
here were going to spin.    The 2nd room got canceled,   but the main room
hosted hardCore and Gabber pushing up to 240 BPM's and gangstas slam dancin
people into the speaker systems....   Massive amount of madness next to each
speaker bank....   I've never quite seen the like of this since I left
Australia.

The vibe was really strange.....  Most were latono,   and eyed me with
suspician as I walked around checking everythng out.   Good hard Techno was
playing,  pushing up to about 150 BPM's and that was in my comfort range so
I wasted no time in getting on the dancefloor.    Huge crowds gathered in
one of the largest "rap circles" i've seen since 16th and Harrison (remember
the Hayes theator).... Yukkk!!   Who wants to!

In the meantime,  I picked the least crowded speaker and got into my
usual trancy spaced out blissful dance patterns with a big phat smile on
my face,  ignoring all the insanity around me.

I was wearing my loose mushroom shirt I got at Ameba,  and as I looked around,
everyone was smiling and groovin to some insanely hard techno....

Soon,  that gave away to some gnarly hardcore as the BPM's started to climb
through 160,  pushing up towards 180....  In about an hour,  things reached
240 BPM's....  Nobody was dancing except a few of these dudes in the
rap circle dancing so fast it seemed like a blurr... Everyone else was huddled
next to the air conditioner vent as the temperature pushed towards 120 degrees
inside.

Later on,  just as I thought this insanity would never stop,   the turntable
wound down to silance....  Soon afterwards....I heard the usual "nursery
rhime" La ti da...  Duf Duf Duf .... Omigawd....  Happy Hardcore....  Almost
the same songs I heard in Australia... brought back memories as I was blissfully
bouncing off the walls...

About 2 am came around and our own Steve Pagen got behind the tables and
started playing the sickest funkiest shit I've heard since I left San
Francisco....

I immediately continued my bouncing off the walls,  while the younger crowds
dwindled down as the "Kiddie Kore" Clan went home to their Mama's and
girlfriends,  and us "Old Skoolers" started groovin to the sick stuff from
Pagen's turntables.   the vibe started to change into a much better one....

During one of my chill sessions as I was standing by the door,   I heard
"Pow Pow Pow Pow!" in rapid sucession....  The security at the door
said "Get inside!" and pure panic broie out as everyone bolted across the
dancefloor towards to back of the dance area.    Steve had already pulled
the plug on the music and was calmly putting the vinyl in the jackets and
getting ready to leave.    Jason,  (the other DJ from the Loft) said
"Lets book" so we bolted out the back door and headed into the alley
way with the rest of the crowd.  By that time,  the place was swarming
with cops....

We met at my car and waited to see what happened next as I dashed inside
to claim my stuff.... Cops were chasing everyone out of the venue...

So we hastily left the scene....

Hmmmm!!   The San Diego scene down here needs some lessons from the San
Francisco vibe.... I can assure you....  I got my work cut out for me...

Tommorrow night....  "BlitzKrieg", yet another LA Massive HardCore
rave.... (My favorite.... :-)  I'll be doing the Video (and getting payed)
using the "Bit Bopper" as we make our video "gobo's" dance to the toons..

Report from LA coming up....

The Crunchman from the Southlands...
  (sort of has a nice ring to it   :-)

No, not the Ramones. The Nazis. As in their method of waging war. It
means "lightning war". It is how they captured nearly all of europe in
the late 30's on their way to mass genocide and World War II. I guess
ravers will seek "unity" at any cost, even if it recalls the spectre of
fascism. Take a look at the movies of Nazi spectacles of dance and
music in Berlin and you might think it's like a rave, recalling hidden,
mysterious, primitive rituals. I've always thought "rave" had the power
to manipulate in this direction if put in the hands of manipulative,
power hungry people, combined with sheep-like, ignorant, drug-addled
followers.

IMHO, BlitzKreig is a highly stupid and questionable name for a rave.
There really is no excuse for ignorance, no matter how much "they" try
to make you think knowledge isn't hip or cool. Ravers think they've
reinvented what it means to be human, that every lesson of the past is
folly, that they're striking out for new, uncharted territories. Y'all
should get that fucking pacifier out of your mouths and suck on the
firehose of knowledge. Childlike innocence is no excuse. Those who
don't know their history are condemned to repeat it...

Ah, if only I lived in SF.  I'm telling ya, as soon as I move there in 
Dec. my doors are open to weary travelers...:)

from THE VANCOUVER PROVINCE, Thursday, August 22:

NEIGHBOURS NOT AMUSED
---------------------
The local rave scene is raging, syas Tyler Stadius.

The 29-year old DJ was one of several platter spinners working last 
weekend's 22-hour dancefest on the Tsawwassen Indian Reserve.

The neighbours in South Delta were not amused.

"It was all highly exaggerated by the newspapers," says Stadius.  
"Completely."

"It was loud, of course, but put it this way ... from the road, where you 
entered, you could barly hear the music."

Despite the hassles - noise complaints and police shutdowns - Stadius 
says raves are more popular than ever.

"It doesn't make an impact," insists the co-owner of Bassix, a Vancouver 
music shop that caters to the music and fashion whims of the all-night 
dance set.  "They'll always continue.  We'll just find a way of working 
within the restrictions."

There's a rave of sorts somewhere every weekend somewhere in the Lower 
Mainland.  Tipped off by flyers and phone messages, ravers find their way 
to warehouses or fields wheere they groove to the newest beats.

The size may vary, the venue may change, the musical style fluctuate, but 
the vibe transcends.

"A lot of the raves try to cater to more than just one style now by 
having more than one stage," says Stadius.

The biggest problem facing local rave organizers is finding a location 
and getting the permits.

"You'll get everything you need and when it comes to the night of the 
show the police will find somthing else to shut you down," says Stadius.

ROTFL
I think this an accurate summary of my biggest fear about things in general.
i dunno. im gonna catch synth pleasures.  friend of mine saw it at the film
fest. and thought it was worth seeing. whether b/c it was a god flick, or
b/c it was a gross misrep, i dunno. but i groove on the tech futuristic
trip, so what the hell. castro next friday... I think i learn alot from
peoples misreps, too. helps me focus what im looking for.

take care

     Hi all :
     
     I need some help; Irvine Welsh author of trainspotting and the 
     excellent book of short stories "the acid house" (get it in booksmith 
     in upper Haight), has a new book out in Britain called "Ecstacy",I 
     beleive it's a collection of stories relating to the  sociological 
     impact of rave culture and it's relationship with mdma.
     
     Anyway, is there anywhere in SF or the bay area that specialises in 
     book imports or has anyone seen this book for sale ?
     
     I appreciate any help on this one,
     
     
     Ciaran

Dear All;

        Before I give big bucks to a service to watch Ernest o Kitty &
Archimedes, I thought I would offer them to one of you. Responsibility &
commitment are a must, or we will have dead kitties from lack of food and
water, and that would make me very sad. So if your interested please no
later than Sunday to commit to kitty sitting, thanks. Contact me @

Peace

     Me : "Oh, that's this one here, mom "Dragonfly records presents a 
     journey into trance mixed by Paul Oakenfold" "
     
     Mom : "Oh, I love that one, put in on."
     
     Recent phone conversation "We all miss you here, and the music you 
     used to play in the kitcen"
     
     
     Right on Ma !

  My parents both decided to drop in on the rave that my brother and I
organized, back in Ottawa.  While my dad stayed only for a few minutes, 
more a show of moral support than anything, my mom got drawn into the 
music (DJ Sunshine, from seattle - who could blame her?) and danced with 
us for an hour or so.  It was great!  I was glad that both she and my dad 
got the chance to see me, my brother, and my older sister dancing, and 
happy, and join us.  I think it helped them to understand us better.  That 
was a great night!
  My mom even scared off some of the younger & more trendy ravers!  Go
mom!  & you should have seen the grin on her face.  She even danced (for a 
few minutes) to some really hard jungle!
  Anyway, all this to say - I agree.  If dancing is an important part of
your life, share it with those you love!

I have it on both my Mac and my PC here at work. Infact I have it coming
from my  Mac and brining it in to an editer and I'm tring to see if I can
mix it all together. Not sure of what make you have, but 4 people plus
myself here at my work have it on Mac. I've heard to pretty good Trance and
Techno tracks.

And for all those who makes there own music, check out the sight.
(www.thedj.com)  I read something somewhere on there site that you can send
in your music if you have it on CD and they will put it on there stream or
whatever they do.

        Hello beautiful SFpeople!

        I used to be on this list a way long time ago but certain life
changes (or calamities) have forced me to pare down my time spent on
mailing lists, and to be honest i was going nuts because i wasn't near SF
and i wanted to be (naturally!) :)
        I'm now well on my way to moving though, and will be coming in in
September, hopefully for good.

        Geez, i guess i'd better give you an intro here..
        Ok, my name's Brad, i do multimedia stuff, i'm living near Toronto
at present but i will be making the aforementioned move within a month
(yay!).
        Musically i'm into a lot of different things: Goa Trance is high on
the list, ambient stuff a la Pete Namlook/SpacetimeContinuum/Irresitible
Force but i'm also a sucker for Detroit/Chicago style techno, the harder
the better.

        One of the good things about being where i am right now has been
that i've been able to catch a lot of amazing djs. Three weekends ago i
went to an outdoor party nearby put on by Plus8 records with Richie Hawtin
and Jeff Mills spinning 4 hour sets.  My brain was permanently altered.

        Last week i went in to Toronto to see Cajmere (head of
Cajual/Relief records from Chicago) spin along with Dubtribe.  Brief
review: Cajmere is sexy as hell and played everything from traxxy vocal
house to his harder Green Velvet stuff. Dubtribe are, well, Dubtribe. :) I
had two people come up to me within a minute of each other to say "OH MY
GOD!! I've got chills running up my spine from them" while they were
playing. One of those awesome synchronicity/feeling the vibe things (it's
way more than just a metaphor!).

        Sun rays and smiles,
                        brad

        Ha ha :)

        On the other side of the spectrum:

        Dad: Brad! What the hell is that racket? It sounds like a pile driver!

        Brad: Oh dad, that's a classic! X-Track by Circuit Breaker! It's
like 9 minutes of a single drum machine run through a couple distortion
pedals :)  Richie Hawtin did it, he's Canadian you know! (Trys to appeal to
my dad's sense of national pride ;).

        Dad: Well, that's just noise.

        Brad: Yup, that's why i love it! :)


        hope everyone's having a good weekend!

                peace in, peace out,

     Hello all:
     
     
     I've been on & off Sfraves for the past few months and feel it's time 
     to introduce myself :
     
     
     Mt name's Ciaran (pronounced Kier-on) O'Hara and I hail from the 
     Republic of Ireland. I came to San Francisco for the first time in 
     1994 for 5 months while I was still attending college back "home", 
     although if home is where you feel comfortable then San Francisco is 
     my new one/second one.
     
     I came back here in October 1995 and have been settling in here since.
     I was going to raves and clubs in Ireland for a while before coming 
     out here. I first danced to the music about 91-92 when we had a rave 
     in college. It was under the influence of a rather common 3 letter 
     acronym that I enjoyed myself. 
     
     That was still a kind of  one off incident, and I think the real 
     conversion for me was seeing the Orb play in Dublin about three years 
     ago. I went to the show with a group of friends from my hometown and 
     at the venue we all made base on a few benches. In all there was a 
     group of about 20 of us : all merry pranksters taking the electric 
     kool-aid acid test. What a night that was. No looking back since. 
     
     Spent the summer of 95 in Ireland and that was the time that I really 
     started to go off. The weather was amazing and every weekend was a 
     different party somewhere : East coast (Dublin), west coast(Galway), 
     South (Cork), North (Derry). Also got to Edinburgh and went to a club 
     there called pure, Jeff Mills played that night.
     
     Some acts I saw that summer : Orbital (I had a true spiritual 
     experience seeing them play open air to about 30,000 people), Carl cox 
     (twice), Laurent Garnier (amazing), Chemical brothers (blew me away).
     Dance, particulary techno & trance became the soundtrack for my life : 
     driving my car, going clubbing, etc.,
     
     I was a bit apprehensive coming back to San Francisco because i 
     worried that there would be no dance scene here. How wrong I was !
      In the past few months I've seen almost everyone I could want to see 
     perform :
     
     Tall Paul Newman (were any of you at the Submerge party in March ?), 
     Goldie; Underworld & Orbital @ the Fillmore; Chemical Brothers(again), 
     Carl Cox(again) and most recently John Digweed & Sasha at the 
     compromised Nation.
     
     Tend to look for smaller, more spiritual type parties these days but 
     will go to one of the clubs if there's a DJ I really want to hear  I 
     also want to get into organising my own parties as I feel I have a lot 
     of ideas and energy to give.If anyone wants to collaborate, e-mail me.
     I've also been doing what I'm thinking of callig rave poetry,but more 
     of that some other time.
     
     I've met some  special & wonderful people on the dance scene here & 
     Look forward to meeting some more of you out on the dancefloor!
     
     
     Peace,
     
     
     Ciaran

What? I've been listening to it on my Mac just fine. The RealAudio

	Hi! I've been reading the posts here on SFRaves for about a week
and decided to finally introduce myself to all the wonderful people I've
been evesdropping on.
	My name is Stan and I'm a 3rd year Berkeley student. Born in Kiev,
Ukraine. Live in Texas for a part of my life I can't quite recall, and
spent some time in L.A. before moving up to Berkeley (and one step closer
to nirvana). :)
	My first rave was Chrysalis several weeks ago and it was an
amazing experience. I had just started listening to ambient music and
mentioned to my friend Brian Denny (high Brian ;> ) that we should go to a
rave sometime soon. Well, a week later he calls me and tells me that he
joined a list called SFRaves with really wonderful and loving people and
was so amazed by the friendliness of the people that he contacted one of
them (hey Matt L. !!!!) about meeting before the party. Well, Brian and I
met up with Matt and Shawna (yay!!). What can I say? I was amazed by the
openness and intensity of the party. I had a great time. The experience is
still difficult for me to put down into words; it was a truly spiritual
experience. Since then I've met a lot of great people at parties and hope
to continue the friendships I've started and to start many new ones.


Love and hand-lotion,
Stan



	High time we made a stand and shook up the views of the common man
	And the love train rides from coast to coast,
	D.J.'s the man we love the most

Yaaaay!  I am so pleased to actually see whole rooms or even whole parties
devoted to goa, lately this has really been happening a lot lately (like
every weekend for the past three/four weekends??)  Yippeee!!  I just love
the psychotic-ness of a room filled with wall-to-wall floor-to-ceiling hard
goa! :)

Now if I could just manage to get around to making it out to one of them...

See you all at BM!  Oh yeah, isn't CCC gonna have a setup out there?  Wow,
goa in the desert. :)  Heehee, I am soooo looking forward to this!  I'm sure
it'll be some sort of a transcendental experience assuming I don't die in
the desert somewhere.  And even if I do, wotta way to go! ;)

A warm, affectionate hug to all ravers,

The SF rave scene is growing into a beautiful, loving, exciting 
environment.  Unfortunately, there are those who wish to interfere with 
and destroy our harmless fun- namely those wearing badges who drive black 
and white cars.  It seems that lately, the more underground raves, namely 
those held outdoors (usu. on public land) which do not happen weekly 
(like the ones in discos), are getting busted fairly regularly.  This 
would imply that the cops must have some inside sources of info, and 
unfortunately, the most likely source is the SFRaves Calendar.

I am NOT saying that the SF Raves calendar should be discontinued!  In 
fact, it's the best thing that's happened to the rave scene (besides the 
invention of E).  What I am saying is that the location of raves should 
not be made easy for the cops to find.  All it takes is one cop with one 
subscription to SF Raves, and after a few phone calls, he can bust a good 
majority of them.

Solution: NEVER give out the location of any underground rave over 
VoiceMail or other publically accessible medium.  ALWAYS use map points.  
I know, map points can be a HUGE hassle, but the only way a cop can track 
down a rave from a map point is to follow the cars to it.  And if you're 
leaving a map point and you see a black and white behind you, pull over 
at Taco Bell, take a leak, then proceed to the rave.  They'd have to use 
undercover cars and people to bust us after that, and I think that'd be 
too much of a hassle for them.

Another thing that tends to give away the location of a rave is the 
abundant number of cars in obscure locations.  This problem can be 
reduced if we all carpooled.  Not only would we be making the likelihood 
of bustation less, we'd also be helping the environment.  Perhaps people 
can leave their cars at some map points (like if they're in the parking 
lot of some 24 hour establishment like Safeway or Food 4 Less.

I'm sure there are a bunch of other ways to make raves less bustable, and 
all these ideas, like mine, will make raves more of a hassle to get to, 
but if it assures that we can all party until the sun rises, then isn't 
it worth it?

On another note: The E that is being dealt in the Bay Area is 
deteriorating in quality.  In other words, some people who are selling it 
are cutting it way too thin so they can make a bigger profit.  There's 
nothing wrong with making a profit, but making a profit at the expense of 
another person's trust in you is selfish and does not belong in our 
family atmosphere.

If your E doesn't hit you within 1/2 an hour, IT IS BUNK.  Even if you 
think you feel it a little, it is bunk.  You should KNOW, without a 
doubt, that you are e-ing.  So if you get dealt bunk E, do yourself and 
everyone else around you a favor; go up to the chump who tried to rip you 
off and tell him or her that he is dealing bunk shit.  Make it obvious, 
so that nobody else who sees what's going on will buy shit from him or 
her.  If a group of you bought the shit, go back as a group and let the 
dealer know that you do not enjoy being ripped off.

I'm not suggesting physical violence (which never solves anything), I'm 
saying that it would probably only take one or two confrontations like 
that to embarass the dealers of bunk E out of pulling that stunt again.  
I've confronted an E dealer who was selling bunk shit, and not only did 
he give me my $ back, but he got the hell out of there because other 
people who were sold bunk shit saw that and came back for their cash and 
to give him a piece of their minds.  THIS WORKS.  No threats necessary.  
Also, ask around about who the person is dealing it, and tell people not 
to buy from him or her.  It doesn't take long for word to get around and 
a bunk E dealer to be shut down.  If you're afraid to insist on getting 
what you paid for, then you're getting what you deserve.

Why am I so ticked about this (who wouldn't be)?  I was in Holland a 
while back and I got to try the PURE 150 mg dose, and let me tell you, 
that Xperience will make you a believer.  Besides, it goes for only about 
the equivalent of $3.60 over there.  Do a little research on the net and 
learn about E (and how friggin harmless it is).  1/2 an hour is all it 
should take before you're flyin' (unless you ate a big steak and potato 
dinner beforehand, since eating before Eing is a no-no).  Don't accept 
anything less than the best- let's keep the raves a pure Xperience.

with regards to your statements on e trip start times .... at least ... i 
have had e that kicked in in over two hours.  As a matter of fact, that's 
how i usually know if it's going to be a wild ride.  :)  anything that 
hits me within half an hour is usually very speedy ...

Hi!,
I'd like to introduce myself, my name is Gavin Cook. I'm a ravin' 
citizen from Denver, CO. I'm moving to San Francisco at the end of 
September, either the 23rd or the 30th. I've been dancing into the wee 
hours since the summer of 92, though not continously:). I was one of the 
original beggars/promoters/founders of MtnRaves. I can't wait to get 
into the scene out there. I'm working on finding a place to live and a 
intresting job, If any one has any suggestions...

I'm a Macintosh geek/guru, 6'6", Love acid & hardcore tracks (any thing 
with a heartbeat above 140. <grin>) Um.. I want to be an industrial 
designer, but I haven't found the right school. <BeginGeekTalk> I'm into 
making my own tracks; I've got a SH-101, Alesis DM-5 & MMT-8, & a 
Digitech StudioQuad. Oh, & my head phones regularly save my life! I'm 
just starting out (have been for about 2.5 years)> I'm addicted to my 
Sony Playstation, & I just read that Metrowerks is releasing a PSX 
compiler for the Mac next month!<Rayman sez..."Yea"> & I won't keep you 
hanging, It's coming to Windows in a few months too.</BeginGeekTalk>

Well, I just wanted to say Hi & see if I can meet a few ppl. I'm a 
little nervous, I'm 21 & I've been living with my mom since I finished 
High School. She is partially disabled (chronic pain), & needs my 
physical & mental support sometimes. I feel bad leaving my sister (16) 
to have to help out mum on her own, But I've got to get on with my life. 
This is hard to say to strangers, but I know the feeling of community 
that there is in MtnRaves, & I hope that I can become a part of SFRaves 
too.
PLUR,  gav

I`ve been on the list for some weeks now, and I`ve discovered that all the
new people introduce themselves..
I haven`t done this yet, so I figured it was about time..

My name is Sune Alexandersen, and I live in Asker, a suburb to Oslo, the
capitol of Noway.... I hope to one day be an actor, allthough I haven`t done
much on stage yet... Some homemade stuff, and a tour with my old school....

If any of you don`t know where Norway is, I can tell you that it is in the
north of Europe...(Scandinavia..) This should be an excuse for some of my
bad spelling....

I`ve been into techno for about 2-3 years or so, and especially jungle....

The friendlyness on the 313 and the SFraves lists has surprised me over and
over....
I`d really like to go to America once in my life and join a party....

There are many (?) parties up here in the north, but the scene is kinda
destroying itself `cause of all the drugs...
Don`t get me wrong, I`m allso just out for having fun, It`s just that the
norwegian scene has become so dark and depressing `cause of all the drugs...
I`d like to quote a subscriber to the SFraves list, Bruce Alvin McDonugh:
quote "I just hope the kids don`t lose it all to drug abuse. Anyone choosing
to use any mind altering substance should definetely do the reading and
research required to make wise informed decisions. Love is probably the only
free high." end quote..
(hope you don`t mind me quoting you, Bruce.....)

E, speed and acid are particularly hot in Norway....

If you got any questions about the norwegian techno-scene, you can e-mail me..
Or if you simply just want a dancing e-mail-penpal from Norway!!!


Well, take care everybody!!!
may the vibe & the force be with you!!

               peacelovehappinessandunderstanding...
                                a warm bearhug to all from Sune!!!

I`m from Norway...
The Norwegian scene sounds like shit compared to this..
All you can see at raves are space-cadets(acid) and workout-people(e)..

People DO care in Norway... They don`t wanna look funny, and they don`t
wanna be different... 
You`re cool if you got the FRESHEST Carhartt jacket, the COOLEST Fila
sneakers, the HOTTEST and the sexiest "bellybutton"....

If you`re nor pretty and/or hip... Your nothing...

Offcourse I don`t have to worry about this... I`m pretty, I got fancy
DC/VANS shoes, and i get all the "chicks"..... Or maybe not???

Offcourse we have our moments here in Norway... But there`s less and less
moments like this......

CAN SOMEONE PLEASE GIVE ME MONEY SO I CAN EXPERIENCE A SFRAVE???!!!??

(or please send me some thoughts when you`re out there on the floor)

        Hi all :)

        One other thing is that one's expectation of events-to-occur based
on past experiences and an over-analysis of things as they're happening
really inhibits uhhh certain experiences.  I think that the more you think
"is this it?" "oh wait! is *that* it?" "is this as good as _____ time i did
it?" the more you'll inhibit the experience, perhaps to the point where it
won't happen at all.
        I always just go out, dance, turn off my mind, put away all my
conceptual boxes and get ready to resonate and rock with what happens :)
        BTW, this post in no way condones the use of illicit
substances...but if you wanna do them i've found (from a friend of a friend
;) hee hee) that experience is a two way street: it's not only something
that happens to you, you happen to it as well. :)

        Peace in, peace out,
                        brad

        Wow, geez. Talk about culture convergence. I would have written
this exact stuff about any party on the east coast of North America, (and
specifically Montreal where i used to live). I feel for ya, i've been
there.
        But when you see everyone trying so hard to be something that
they're not, it gives you a lot of room to be who you really are (if that
makes any sense!)  You're realizations give you an edge that other's may
not have, and so they're doomed to be insecure, "tryhards" until they can
"get it" about what raves can REALLY be about.

        :) Now you TOTALLY are reminding me of myself.  Well, i've been
trying to make it to SF for about a year now and it's finally happening!
All in good time :)
        Oh and as far as GABBER stuff, check out Industrial Strength
Records (they have a new 2 CD comp with tons of great stuff on it). IS is
out of Brooklyn, so i guess it'd be an import for you, but well worth it.
No cheesy stuff! :)
        Good luck & peace,

can this thread either
        1)clean up the language and personal insults
or
        2)go private?

i like reading good threads that discuss pertinent raving issues (e, cops),
but after a certain point, the personal insults get a bit annoying.

thanks, and keep up the good discussion, but take personal insults and shots
at specific people private.

love-

matt l

Agreed. Actually, you can use The DJ on anything that supports Real
Audio.  The Evil Sparc 20 at work has also had a successful run-in
with the DJ.  So all platforms are covered here (PC Mac UNIX).

I didn't see any options for C64, however.

Hey peeps,

Well I went to OPEN on friday and because the promoters feared losing their
space in the city (or did they lose it for sure?) the held the party at the
Pittsburg roller rink.  Haven't beeen there is a while.  The dj was set up
infront of a black tarp across the rink on the left and the chill room was
behind it.  A lot of sound bleed in the chill area but plenty of mattresses
and pillows to stay comffy.  The MUSIC for this party was INCREADABLE!!!
Yeah I love every minute of it.  I got there around 11.30-12 and Tony was
up spin the shit and got me warmed up for Eric Davenport.  mmmmMMMM yeah I
really started to move to the house and trancy rhythms.  Then Hipp-e went
next and you could tell there was a dj change when the bpm bounced up and
the energy just in the music got faster.  Damn, I couldn't stop moving but
I had to or I would collapse from no energy and the heat.  Hipp-e's a cool
guy and invited me and my friend Ann (mostly invited her but..) to an after
party but we never made it.
The music slowed to a stop and BOOM Trance started up a great set, mixing a
little of everything (trance->jungle->funky->hardcore->etc.) I can't wait
to hear more of him and the LA style when I move.
   The people were very friendly, and young.  The crowd was small though.
There was no concentration of energy because everyone was so spread out.
This party could have devinatlly rocked if it had a sufficent number of
people to contribute.  I miss out on the masses of people jumping, whaling,
yelling and screaming when a great build comes and conects with the crowd
and the crowd goes off.  The music was there but the crowd wasn't.

        After Trance came Terrence Toy and he layed down some funky beats.  =
Ahh.
Around 6 they turned on the lights but kept the party going till 6.30- 7.
When the end was near all the people that helped with the party got all the
hardcore ravers together in a circle infront of the dj booth and we all
danced together for about 10 minutes to the last songs.  Great party.  I
had a lot of fun.  Nexus does a great job and I hope more people come out
for their next gathering.

In the corse of the night I got a massage that just blew me away. Saw and
danced with Adam L and James(?).  What up bro? Got several hugs and candy
from strangers and danced so hard I was unable to go out to Hallucination
Saturday.

Maybe I'll see ya at sunset around 8.

Paz

Um, actually, I think it was private and our friend Ben committed one of 
the biggest nettiquette no-nos by posting a public reply to a private 
message.  Sometimes I think there should be a required 
nettiquette/mail-list faq for all newbies.

good morning! (well, sort of)

Hats off to Dutch et al for still piecing together a damn good party
in the face all of the difficulties! I had a great time and came home
with all of the required dancing injuries :) Wished the ambient room
went down (esp. after all the lugging), but oh well. At least we
didn't end up at the deli...

Doesn't the SFPD have anything *better* to do with their time? Like
give people parking tickets, or something ;)

The pros and cons of such a name were massively argued on SoCal Raves, by
people who would know something about the people involved.

I don't think your critique, while echoing some of the opinions already
expressed a month ago, belongs on a list centered 500 miles North of where
the people concerned are based. SoCal has come to a concensus about Dr.
Freecloud's and Blitzkrieg (they support the organizing group, they agree
to disagree on the name,) so back off...

Besides, who died and made you moral arbiter of an entire generation?

those words rung out to ravers waiting at the big heart back up location, 
after the cops shut down the original one, and we moved to the third 
spot, the ever wonderful ACME, home of so many past experiences - where i 
thought shurely i'd never return. but hey, this isnt a complaint about 
$2o, this is a story about persceverence and dedication. in my heart and 
mind, i feel everyone had done their best, and in the face of adversity 
our family came together under the pounding rhythm for yet another nite. 
yeah, i was expecting a fat set up, fat lazers, fat sound, fat 
decorations, delicious trance, and everything else for my $2o, but 
instead witnessed something different... something unique, and props to 
those who put it together, this is one raver who appreciated it all :)

Funny, I got a strange vibe just reading that, but it's probably because
I'm "latino".

Hi all!

 Well, I'm still pretty beat ;) from the weekend. It really hurt to have 
our original site shut down by the cops. The party site was probably the 
nicest outdoor scene I've ever experienced (8 GoldScans hung from a 
crane!!), and I had set up a nice little ambient space with help from the 
Gateway crew.

 Tearing everything down after a full set up (I was SO ready to go off!) 
was very frustrating and disheartning. With a lot of help it went quickly.
We proceded to Big Heart for a long wait and finally the word came to go 
to Acme. I was intrigued to go as I've never been to this most infamous 
of spots. The Gateway crew, again, kicked really hard under less than 
ideal conditions (you all should try to set up heavy, delicate equipment 
in a packed room sometime) to quickly create a space that was very nice. 
The two lasers certainly helped!!

 The music was, of course, perfect all night long. Minor Minor started 
off and really kicked the party into a spacey high gear from the start. 
At the end we got to hear Very fresh tracks from KoxBox that were being 
mixed on Dat.

 The crowd was so friendly and kind! I really enjoyed the chance to just 
socialise and dance.

 I must say that Dutch was very inspiring all night long. He never gave 
up and tried his best to take care of all of us. I know it broke his 
heart to have our original site busted.

 I also want to thank my crew!!!! Martin and Steve for transport and 
setup. Martin again for teardown. And of course our firestarter Brendon 
(Anarch) for set up and helping to make the original ambient site 
hospitable. 

 To all the folks I hugged both newly met and otherwise; THANK YOU! You 
really helped to make me glow with pleasure!!!!  =)


Love to all of you,


Ran

Dear Persons;

        The expert speaks = >, hmmmm you obviously haven't done real E or
some of it's cousin's. The amount of time it takes can depend on a lot of
variables like was it a pill, or is it powder, like you said how much it's
cut, what's the condition of your stomach, you metabolic rate/body ..etc,
and/or is it a relative of E like MDA, MDOH, MDE, or 2CB ...etc.

        Don't buy powder it you don't want cut in it, you can't screw with a
pill, and that's the bottom line. The powder in the bay area is sooooo weak,
gets you off for at most 4 hours and limits you to maybe 4 - 5 successive
doses before you are doing very expensive speed.

        Some of the cousins of MDMA like the one mentioned above don't have
these problems and the high is soooo close to MDMA the most people can't
tell the difference, plus you get visual stuff with the cousins.

Peace
Brian

Dear All;

        Before I give big bucks to a service to watch Ernest'o Kitty &
Archimedes, I thought I would offer them to one of you. Responsibility &
commitment are a must, or we will have dead kitties from lack of food and
water, and that would make me very sad. So if your interested please no
later than Monday night to commit to kitty sitting, thanks. Contact me @
510-595-7988 if your interested.

Peace

Scott & DJ Mark. Now that's if I can get a cheap plane ticket & someone to
watch da kitties. 

        However, I do wish everyone with the exception of those two

What's really bad is I'm suppose to work, and they are really short handed,
and I have no way of telling them or giving back their ticket.

Ben Edwards -- 

Listen you pathetic fuck. THe first rule of netiquette is don't repost
private mail back to the list. I guess you're just too addled by all
that E you claim to be taking "harmlessly" once a week to be bothered
by that.

Apologies on the language/tone of my last post. I just got really
ticked off that this guy decided to repost my private mail to a public
list w/o permission. I made that mail private in the first place
because I didn't want to start a big flame war about E (and I've
already flamed E enough times in the past 4 years of SFR membership).
But when some fool says "E is totally harmless" it just gets to be a
bit much.

Who is organizing this rave?  Do you know the person/people personally?
If so, please tell them my e-mail address so I can arrange a time to go
and meet them and beat the crap out of them.  What are they going to be
calling raves next?  How about Hiroshima or the Klan club?  Talk about
being insensitive.  If this was England the organizers would quite rightly
be arrested and charged with promoting racist sentiments which is a crime
punishable by three years in jail; but as this America stupid and ignorant
people can get away with saying stupid and ignnorant thing's.
This is without a doubt one the most offensive thing's I have ever heard
in connection to raves and I am very angry about it.  If I ever meet the
organizer of this rave he won't be meeting with me again.  This is
obviously a strictly money only affair and I urge everybody to boycott it
as much as possible.
Tristan.

regarding e and the amphetamine question. Ina galaxy far far a way (say
'89, when there was adam and eve and other nifty analogs floating around) i
did a bit of research to find out what form of chemicals some friends of
mine were imbibing with great regularity. anyway, despite the word
amphetamine existing in MDMA, i came out with the impression that it was
not considered an amphetamine. I am not sure if this was a classification
of external effect (ie it acts an empathogen) or b/c its chemical effects
were different (it doesnt
_act_ on the the body like a methamphetamine) just curious, anyone with
some chem/pharm knowledge care to help out?

hmm.. my thought on map points. It seems to me that any rave can be busted,
its just a question of whether or not its worth busting. if its easy to
find out about (posted, address on VM) its really easy to bust. if you have
to send someone to actually go to some map point, maybe it just becomes a
pain in the ass. i dunno. maybe it even cost more for the poilice to send
someone undercover to go to the rave. this is kinda interesting to me:
anywya know any of the cost-benefit- shit the pol goes through when dealing
with this kind of hting?

Greetings and happy Monday =P...


Well this weekend was full of suprises, suspense, anticipation and
,ultimatley, a really good party...

Friday: after woork a few of my co-workers and myself made it down the the
local pub where we all were exchanging stories of our past.  Funny, how they
speak of thier "wyld days" of the past (ie. years ago) while I was talking
about last weekend...  I need to find a workplace w/a younger crowd (well,
i'll settle for at least a younger @ heart crowd).  Alas, such socalizing
(coupled w/a horrible cough I had since Monday)kept me from any raving for
that night...

Hi everyone =)
Can anyone out there give me specific directions on how to get to BM from
SF????? I had a map online but lost it and now I can't get back on the net to
get another one :(
I'm leaving tomorrow and desperately need to know how to get there, 'cos I
haven't got a clue (being a foreigner and all). I could probably find my way
to the Nevada Black Rock Desert, but I could do with some help along the way.
Plus how easy is it to navigate across this desert and find BM???
Love and light

 Great! MAD is on tonight! I thought it would be a good chance to be with 
you Burning Man attendees one last time before you disappera from the SF
Bay area ( I'm staying here this year ). 

 I'm going to my mother-in-law's birthday dinner and party  tonight - then,
maybe I'll bring a bunch of my neices and nephews to MAD! I think the
youngest one is over 18 years old.

I noticed.  I remember writing the message cause it was kind of long, but  
when I received it there was nothing there.  I think I messed it up.  I use
elm to read my mail and run vi externally to write mail.  I think I mis-typed
when I went to save it so there was nothing to send.

Anyway, I don't feel like writing everything again.  I had a really great 
weekend and met lots of new people, especially while waiting for Hallucination
to get going.  Definately worth the wait.

Angela and I got there about 12:30.  As we walked into the homebase warehouse 
we first passed through the ambient space.  After quickly moving thru that we
 got to the first room where garth was tearing it up in the wicked room.  
There as a giant budda set up behind the dj and some nice video projections as well
 as some flashing lights which were sometimes blinding but also had a hypnotic
effect.  Of course the wicked sound system sounded great.

Being that we just got there we proceeded to the big room to see how that was
set up.  Of all the parties I been to at this location, this party had the best 
visual set-up imo.  Lazers, video projections, giant budda behind the dj in
this room as well, and great lighting effects. The sound system in this room
was amazing.

Also in this room tracy was having an incredible set.  WOW! tracy in one room and 
garth in the other, both having great sets :).  And we just got there :)

After dealing with the confusion of which room to enjoy as we bounced back and 
forth a few times between the two rooms we settled in for awhile in the wicked 
room when markie came on.  Markie played a great set showing alot of variety
in the music he played as he did a great job mixing the many unique sounds.

Got to see some of dubtribes set.  I enjoyed the messages he was gettting 
out though I didn't relate to the amount of anger I felt in some the songs
and didn't get all that into the lyrics of asking "god to have mercy on my soul."
Musically I thought dubtribe was great and really enjoyed his third world singing
lyrics.

Enjoyed some of jeno's set, but also used some of this time to rest.  Carlos had a
good set, but the crowd was getting small and low on energy by then.  After a short 
rest I was able to dance hard once last time as I got inspired by angela who 
continued to dance hard inspite of the mostly low energy of the now dispersing
crowd.

We left probably just a little before it ended about 6:45.  This party was a bit 
less crowded than other parties I've been to there which I think made the vibe 
a little less chaotic with less traffic everywhere.  Overall i think the vibe had 
a nice happy one, which I think would have been difficult for there to be any other
kind with so much happy house music.

I have been sitting on the fence on going to BM this year. I don't quite 
know why, as I had a marvelous time last year. Today when I was doing a 
search on excite, I made up my mind when I saw next to the ads for the 
Ford Explorer and Microsoft, an ad related to Burning Man....eeek.... have 
fun you all....

I dunno. I kinda liked the name. The poster is cool, too. Big AK47's on the
cover. I have two of them hanging in my office.

You have to remember that the music of choice down in LA is hardcore. And
there's basically no E, so everybody's on acid or speed and dancing their
asses off to the hardest and/or fastest thing they can find.

Besides, LA has *every right* to have their own version of a rave, and if
that means guns, gabber and blitzkrieg, that's their business.

I think they should call their next rave D-Day or something as a followup.
At least both sides would be well represented... :-)

I would not generalize the LA scene like that.  The E to Acid to Speed
ratio in LA is basically idenical to the ratio in SF.

It is true that there is a larger hardcore scene is LA, but that city
is so big it supports many scenes.  I was there this weekend and
went to a *killer* outdoor rave in Angeles National Forest arragned
completely by socal-ravers, with the complete blessing of the forest
rangers.  The music was not hardcore, the people were great, and the
vibe was off the scale.  Oh, did I mention it was donation-only?

I think this party could have just as well gone off in SF, look at
all the gabber-heads on sfraves!!  Probalby MORE than socal.

Blitzkreig was busted before 11pm.  Bad name karma?

Take the right-hand fork, which is Highway 34.  Go North on Highway 34 for
approximately 12 miles.  Blackrock desert will be on your right.

Near the 12 mile mark you should see a 24" white dot on the asphalt to your
right and a vehicle parked several hards off the road.  The vechicle will be
marked with the BM symbol.  Leave the asphalt of Highway 34 here.  Follow
this dirt road til you arrive at Black Rock Station.  They will direct you
from there.

See ya.

To all SF-Ravers.

This Saturday will be an unforgetable night.  

We have worked so hard to make this a very special event.  It is our 
way of bringing in new people and new faces into the raving comunity.  
We expect a lot of new and first time ravers at this event, and we need 
the support of the old school ravers to guide the new ravers in the 
right direction.  It is alway the responsability of the older 
generation to pass thier knowledge to the younger generation so that 
traditions will continue.  We hope that all of you who consider 
yourselves the "safekeepers of the oldschool vibe" will come out and 
show everyone how it is done in the San Francisco Rave Sceene.  

This party is all about the Bay Area underground.  We are exclusively 
showcasing all the bay area dj's - only.  We have 3 massive rooms for 
the three sound systems representing the sound of the bay area.  Sound 
systems form the North Bay, South Bay, and Major Bay areas with all 
their own dj's. (for complete linup call 415-569-6226)  

Our vision is to throw a large party, but maintain the small party 
feel.  For this reason we made it a local showcase.  We feel that the 
musical consistancy and harmonius vibe will come through the dj's 
knowledge of each others styles.  This is why the vibe at a small party 
is so good, because the dj's are all friends, and know eack other.  We 
hope to showcase this vibe at our event to all the first time ravers so 
that they will fall in love with the sceene as we all did.  This is 
very important, especialy now, that we bring in a lot of new blood into 
our community, and except it with open arms.   Our rave sceene has a 
very high turnover rate.  It is hard to maintain a consistant folowing 
of support.  The 3/4 of the sceene seems to be turning over every year. 
 this is twice as fast as it was 2 years ago.  At this alarming rate, 
our sceene might disipate unless something is done.  We hope that this 
party not only brings in new people that will rejuvinate the 
underground folowing, but it redefines peoples perspectives on what a 
lage party can be like.  

The ideas of raving never used to be so philisophical.  they were 
practiced a lot more than they were talked about.  Lets sweep the dust 
of the old hats, and whistles and pull out the bell botoms, candy and 
platforms and lets do it like it used to be done, so that everyone, new 
and old, will be proud to call themselves ravers.  

Our reasons for doing this party are very simple - we want everyone to 
come together under the unifieing sounds of house music and to feel the 
positive vibe of everybodies energies all flowing with the music.  We 
want to bring in new people, and we want to respark the fire in the old 
ones.  

We have done everything we could on our end.  We have a secured - Fully 
Permited location to go all night long, and we have packed it with an 
incredible production, and we have goten out the word.  Now all that is 
left is for people to suport the party, and at the same time, support 
their underground community, and help out their rave sceene. 

Tickets are only $18 in advance.  We did everything humanly possible to 
make them this inexpensive.  This is something we are trying to do to 
show people that large parties do not have to cost a fortune.  This is 
a realy good price, because you are getting more than 3 large parties 
for the price of less than one.   We are also donating a portion of our 
procedes to the Bay Area Homless Alience.  Just think- your partying 
will help the less fortunate this winter.   We encourage everybody to 
buy tickets and please arive early to help set the tone and the mood 
for the evening.  

We will be filming this party so that we can someday cronicle the rave 
sceene, and we hope to see you in the vidio.  Wear your best outfits to

I've read in several different sources, net and book, that E is (or can be?)
neurotoxic, that it burns out the serotonin receptors in the brain.  Anyone
else care to comment on this.  I'm sure others must have read this.  I wonder
if there's been any new data on this.  I did research a couple years ago.

 Hey!  
 With these questions lately about E, etc...I was just thinking,
 a great book that you might want to check out is
 PIHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved) by Alexander and Ann
 Shulgin.  Shulgin was often deemed the father of MDMA, though he didn't
 really invent it.  He did invent an incredible number of other
 psychoactive compounds.  This book, PIHKAL, is killer.  I would highly
 recommend it to anyone interested in drugs for research of any sort. 
 He goes into the chemical structure, the making of, the metabolism by 
 the body, and for us not-so-huge-chemistry buffs, a brief explanation 
 of the drug's effects, as per about 8 different people, and the different
 effects at different dosages.  Plus there is a nice little "fictional"
 story in there...and a great spot on personal freedom... 
 There are about 250+ drugs in there that are discussed, including MDMA,
 MDOH, MDA, etc...which are all phenethylamines.
 I know you can get the book at Great Expectations on the Haight.  I'm
 sure other places will have it too.
 Sorry if this has been discussed b4.
 Happy reading!

busted at 12:30 am...

Boy,  it was really great to dance to Happy Hardcore just like in Oz,
but then the music stopped at 12:30 and it turns out that the owner of
the land (it was an outside rave) called the cops and said "Shut it down"
after pocketing the $3000 for the use of the land....  Sheesh.
talk about being a Phat cat asshole...

Well,  that makes 2 raves and 2 busts in one weeekend.... SoCal raves
get busted a lot more often down here.  I WAS able to get to an outdoor
underground rave put on my the Moontribe people this weekend in the
Angeles National Forest...  It was PHAT!!!

Well, I hadn't been sure up 'till today - I won't be able to attend
Burning Man this year due to work and money complications.

I bought a ticket, thinking I could go, so if anyone out there in
raver-land is still ticketless, I'm going to let my ticket/info pack go
for $25.  You'd have to come pick it up in the Upper Haight.

Mega-bummage, but I'll get over it.

On a happier note, I got my Harmony 3-yr ticket!  Hurray!

Take care all....

Bruce,
John's Hopkins University in Baltimore, renowned as one of the top notch
med. universities, released a report last fall that E does just what you
suggested...in monkeys. Reported "brain damage" (their wording) included
terminal depression! Question is, how much does it take?  Unfortunately, I
never read the actual medical journal  ( I just saw a snippet in the
Chron.)  I mean, did these docs dose our little ape friends out of their
minds every day for  4 weeks?  Or did they send them out to one or two
kickin parties a month for a couple of years?
It's hard to say unless you read the article...but I encourage anyone with
enough time (or internet
access) to do a search.  I actually spent two days in the Cal Library
trying to find the article, but couldn't.

Bottom line...while E is a beautiful thing and has potential to change the
way we keep in touch with our emotions and with our fellow humans, I think
that there is a certain danger in doing it even once a week.  My personal
theory is that our serotonin levels, which I believe can replenish
themselves if given the chance, can actually dry up at the source (thus the
"brain damage") if partying is done in excess.  My advise is, that until we
know more about the JHU study and what it really means, we ought to ALL
consider what sort of permanant damage we might be doing to ourselves.  The
trick, I feel, is to take what we have learned through E and practice a
opening up "cleaner" doorways to our super-consciousness.  We've all been
there, and so we know that it exists.   Can we get there on our own?
Better cautious now than terminally damaged ten years down the road.

Anyone with more hard fact on this, please submit them.

Evolve.

          There's no substitute for education. You, obviously are, well
educated. Don't stop, never stop, when you feel that you're done learning,
your life is over.

        I knew about the Lightning War. It wasn't a racist thing. It was
just a plan to try and win the war as quickly and painlessly as possible but
HA, it didn't work.

        I like how you think!

     That's not entirely true. You can have perfectly clean
methylenedioxymethamphetamine and you could have screwed it yourself by say,
eating a meal a couple hours before, or even a sandwich just a little while
before. In my experiences, food in your stomach makes a huge diffirence
between a good trip and none at all. Me and my girl dropped it and I was
having a good time while she (80lbs lighter and a chicken sandwich in her
stomach) didn't feel much at all.
        Another time, I gave her a hit and it didn't do anything to her
really, for about 2-3 hrs, then it hit waaaay hard. 

        Don't eat for 6 hours before, save your food till you feel it (best
food you'd ever have).

Thats what happened to me this last weekend. I bought my E from this
girl, and after it didn't kick in for 3 hours, I was totally ticked off!
I grabbed my friend, we went back to my car, and just as I was about to
put the key in to leave- BAM!! It hit! I just turned to my friend and
said: "Dude, we have to get back in there RIGHT NOW!" :-) And then
everything was cool.

"Painlessly" for the Germans ;)  The Blitzkrieg was meant to conquer quickly
before adequate defenses/reinforcements could be mounted, and especially to
strike terror into those under assault.  It actually did sort of work (witness
the early stages of the war), but Hitler and the Germans' egos were bigger
than their brains.  They abandoned the air-raids of England just prior to an
invasion (which if successful would have prevented the US from establishing
air bases there...), and they got bogged in a multi-front war.  They probably
would have ended up being defeated anyway, though.


As far as the rave, though I think it's a lame name (AK-47's on the poster?),
let them use it.  It's their right.  People don't have to go (although they
will...)

Thats what I read too. But who really cares. I mean, people wouldn't be
shootin up if they didn't like what it did to them , and what people like,
they want, and most persons don't care whether "eventually" they'll get hurt
by something.

        Here's an idea by me: See everyone. . .drugs are drugs. No matter
how good it feels, anything that alters your normal state of mind is
harmful. Basically everything kills brain cells, shit, aging kills brain
cells. But drugs mask everything. Alcohol, speed, crank, mdma, pcp,
nicotene, ketamine, whatever, even if it's natural, it's bad. There are
flowers in this world that can give you the best trip of your life, then
kill you. It's a natural defence of the plant to have this effect. Y'know
how the monarch butterlfy and some other creatures are poisonous to
animals??? Same Idea. It's the poison that slowly kills your mind and body.
        So drugs are basically bad. Sure I've done . . . several diffirent
things, and since I first started, I can really tell a diffirence it made
with me. My memory is pretty bad. I have to remember to remember something
in order to remember it.

        If you don't stop f****** yerself up, then at least moderate it. I
know girls who've been using drugs commonly found at raves for about 5
years, and it takes her about 2 minutes to finish a sentence. Now tell me
that's not the drugs that did it?
Yep yep yep. . . you know I'm right. 

        The less amount of "us" doing drugs there are, the less amount of
"us" will do them.

Yeayh, who's smart. . .

 I am not sure if I agree with that statement.  I know people who get sick
(throwing up) if they don't have any food in their stomachs.  I think it
depends on ones body what is the best way to go about it.  Some people
shouldn't eat, some should eat a light meal and some shoud eat a lot.
Everybody's body is a little different.

Sorry anyone I may have offended.

And I know school didn't really start yet.

>>Herbal Ecstasy and other legal highs<p>
>>Many people are worried about taking Ecstasy and are turning to safe,=
 legal

>>We bought as many "herbal Ecstasy" products as we could find and made a
>list of all the ingredients. These included: Tibetan Ma Huang, Wild

>cola nut, Gotu-Kola, Fo-Ti-Tieng, Green tea extract, Rou Gui (rare form of
>Chinese nutmeg), yohimbara (relative of yohimbe), Calamus, Kava kava
>tincture, raw ephedra, tincture of ephedra, broom and lettuce opium=
 (Lactuca
>virosa), also in resin form for smoking. Then we sent the list to a German
>expert on psychotropic plants. <p>
>>Her verdict was that most of these ingredients have a speedy effect, but
>not basically different to drinking coffee or Red Bull. Only one ingredient
>had extra effects, the herb called Ma Huang in Chinese and Ephedra in
>English, whose extract is the drug ephedrine. This has a stimulating
>"shivering skin and muscle effect" which some people associate with=
 Ecstasy.
>"You feel shivers up and down your spine, especially in the roots of your
>hair. It makes you sweat and you feel your muscles and skin more intensely.
>It can act as an aphrodisiac, especially for women. A major difference from
>Ecstasy is that this herb helps you to concentrate your mind on a task, so
>that some people find it a good drug to use for mental work." <p>
>>Ephedra or ephedrine makes your heart beat faster and makes you breathe

>unpleasant and may cause muscle spasms and even a heart attack. The safe
>dose varies according to the individual so that its easy to overdose unless

>National Formulary, ephedrine is "not recommended and should be avoided
>whenever possible" and must not be used by people with heart disease,
>diabetes, hypertension or kidney disease. Side effects include racing=
 heart,
>dry throat, anxiety, tremor and cold extremities. The maximum dose is 600=
 mg.=20

>dried herb in a cup of water for at least 3 minutes; then strain and drink.
>Start with one teaspoon per person and try more if it is not strong enough.
>It is astringent and bitter, but is more palatable with a little milk.<p>
>>Other herbal highs include Khat or qat, a herb that is chewed in the=
 Yemen;
>tastes foul but gives you a buzz since it contains drugs similar to
>amphetamine and ephedrine. Khat is increasingly sold in clubs but should be

>>Poppers (Isobutyl nitrate)<p>
>>Legal in Britain, sold in sex shops and some clubs in small bottles. When

So maybe drugs do harm you physically a bit.  But that is a risk that
I think the world can take, espically if certian chemical compounds are
the key in awaking a society that is quickly slipping into complete, and
total global insanity.

I will choose a tiny bit of physical toxicity if it will snap myself
and the world out of a 2000 year old bad trip...

Note:  I am NOT flaming in any way, shape, or form.

It just saddens me to see that to some people the party is a measure of 
how good the drugs are or if they are on drugs at all.  That is an 
attitude I'd worry about.  I guess to each his own.  I am the first to 
admit to the relationship between raves and drugs and don't frown upon 
it.  It is just something I feel that one needs to evaluate.  Why do you 
go?  What do you want to get out of it?  I know the drug aspect is low on 
my hierarchy of reasons why I rave.   I personally don't need substances to 
dictate whether I have a good time or not nor whether I decide to stay or not.
The people and the music do that for me.  I've heard the comment that 
"this party isn't that great, but maybe if I do E it will make it better."
That just isn't what I think about raving, but that's just me....
Hmmm... maybe I'm being "holier-than-thou".  I dunno. :\

check out "e is for ecstasy" in the hyperreal drug section... very useful,
pretty long and totally nonpartisan (warn't written by a raver OR a fed!
=).

I think the author's conclusion was that seratonin levels in the brain does
seem to be lower among e-using rats but: the doses they gave to rats were
something like the equivalent of a person taking 20 hits, twice a day,
every day (!!!) and that lower seratonin levels don't necessarilty mean
something's wrong or that e's causing it because people just don't know
that much about neurochemistry anyway.

drugs are chemicals... so is food and water and O.J. (not *the* OJ =) and
oatmeal cookies and greasy McD's burgers... The line between "drugs" and
anything else you put in your body to alleviate hunger,thirst, fatigue,
stress etc. is pretty hazy; which is why I'm totally against "outlawing"
the borderline stuff, like pot and e and 'shrooms...

>I will choose a tiny bit of physical toxicity if it will snap myself

oh it's been a longer trip than that and I'm sure the christians on this
list (and non-christians like me) might take offense at the implications...

I got a bad feeling from it too, and I'm not even latino.  Do you sense a

However the problem becomes that the world does not see the chemicals as 
a key, but rather an end unto themselves.

My $0.02, it's very likely that many synthetic drugs are bad for you in the
long run (depending on how enthusiastic one administers them...). However,
many people are into mountain climbing, car racing, hanggliding etc. Lots
of people are killed while taking part in such activities too. The bottom
line for me is that my body is mine, and mine alone. We have a limited
number of years on this planet and we can use our body (and mind/soul)
in whatever way we feel gets us the most out of those years. One can
live a quite and peaceful life, but to experience things that add intensity
and meaning to it all, one has to take risks every now and then. Every
time you get into your car you take the risk of ending up as a statistic.
Even if many of us may end up in the funny farm 30 years from now, at
least we (hopefully) lived our lives to the fullest. Moderation and
diversity in how we get our kicks is probably the best way to go.
And the body can take a lot of damage without showing any effects, especially
the brain which is capable of letting other parts take over functions
which are lost by accidents etc. Alcohol kills brain cells and you don't
make any new ones and still you can be social drinker and not become
senile early in life. Another interesting find from all the E research
(found somewhere among the hyperreal stuff) is that people expected regular
E-users to become more aggressive due to serotonine depletion, while in
fact the opposite turned out to be the case. Short term memory appears
indeed to be affected, which is also a side effect of legal drugs like
prozac (even though that drug influences serotonine levels in a different
way). In any case, we will be in good company in the psychiatric wards...

What'r you guys talkin about, the original post was talking about some other
group of people. Haven't you ever met a "Latono" before??? Damn they can get
crazy. . . They're from that weird ol raving country called LatVille, there,
they have diffirent dance rituals and initiate newbies by staring them down
until the newbies give in and introduce themselves. After the introduction,
the used-to-be-feared "Latono's" become friendly and even talk to the the
little newbie. I've even heard of them being friends!!! WOW! 

        The moral to the story is: People are afraid of things they don't
understand, so. . . get to know them, and all will be well.


Crazy ravers. . . .jeeeeeez.

Hello everyone,

    Well we have decided that it would probably be a really good idea, 
that since some of you sfravers are going to BM, we have tickets for 
the three year anniversary/finale there.

    Anyways, we will be giving some tickets to Wayne. Of course you 
will probably find him at the VW camp most of the time. We don't know 
how many to give him thought, so if you would, please respond to me 
privatly if you would like to have tickets put on hold for you at the 
VW camp. If you don't respond, the might be sold out (or spoken for) by 
the time you find Wayne.

    At the moment there are tickets @ Solid Grooves 368 so Bascom ave 
in SJ, and @ Housewares 1322 Haight st in SF. And you can still mail 
order you tickets. Just send a money order of $20 per ticket along with 
your complete address and name to: Harmony
                                   Po Box 111084
                                   Campbell CA 95011-1084

    Also, tickets are $20 and they are good for all 24 hours of the 
three year anniversary event. Hope to see you there, and have fun at 
the BM!!!! (Damm, I wish I could go!!)

Peace,

Greg :)

        You don't smoke do you??? I can't tell you how many times I've heard
someone say that. I'm one of those people that do all that crazy stuff like
flying through the air and landing on soon to be broken body parts.
        But drugs are a diffirent story, you do have a limited time on this
earth but, would you really want to spend 1/3 of it on drugs, 1/5
recuperating from the drugs, and the rest living with the aftermath of the
drug use??? I just try to persuade people from doing them because eventually
you'll have to live your real life, and if you spenmd all your time in a
made up world, you can't give your full attention to making your REAL world
the best it can be for you and whatever offspring you may have. 
        It's cool sometimes, but realize that you can't always live like that.
I don't mean to start an argument, I'm just venting my thoughts.
Nothing wrong with voicing yer opinion.

Hello again!

    Well this is a little short noticed, but here we go!!

    The Harmony Anniverary party is costing a bundle. In fact, even if 
we sell all the tickets @ $20 we might not break even. (This means we 
are probably spending a little too much money!) But we have always put 
%100 of all revenues straight back into our parties. We don't take 
paychecks or anything! ;) This makes the party more enjoyable for all 
of you!!!
    
    But anyways, the 3 year party's budget has gotten completely out of 
control! We do not want to make any budget cuts, cause that would just 
take away from the party. We want to spend as much as we can to make it 
as intense as possible!!! Because of this, we are planning a smaller, 
more intimate family party/ fund-raiser for the week before. 

    It's going to be a "Beautiful People" party. It will be in San 
Francisco, on Friday September 6th. (The purpose of this party is to 
raise money for the three year party) The admission cost will be $15 :( 
Now we know that some of you just went and purchased your anniversary 
tickets. We also know that $20, even for this party is kinda harsh on 
the pocket. So, if you come to Beautiful People, with your actual 
Harmony 3 year ticket in your hand, we will let you in for $10 (or 
maybe less... hopefully less, but we'll see...) 

    There will be a lot more information about this Beautiful People 
party coming up. So keep your eyes and ears open!!! Call the infomation 
line for more info... (408)486-9591   (408)450-3044

Peace, love and harmony,

Greg :)

Although I don't like MASSIVES persay, this is wholy a good idea and would
be one reason I would go to this party.  I'm leaving for the weekend to
secure a job in San Luis Obisbo so I'll be missing out on BM (and this
party).  Just a few comments (OPINIONS) on what Ray wrote.

Vibe doesn't come from the dj's directly, but rather indirectly through the
feelings and conections the crowd makes with the music the dj is spinning,
the people around them and through connecting with ones self.  I have never
felt this "small party" vibe at a large gathering with the exception of a
few of the Gatherings parties, and a few parties way back when (I don't
even recall the names but I do recall my experiences).  IMHO to create this
"small party" vibe in a large party, you must have an experience crowd and
a crowd willing to give more to the party than they are taking.  If
=46eelgood Ent. pulls it of I will be most impressed.

I'm not sure I understand what your trying to say here.  Almost sounds like
the scene needs this party to go off to continue its existance.  Hmmm.  It
seems that in the past year or so Promoters have come and gone, or just
changes names.  The scene isn't dieing its just changing.  I see this next
year will be a great year for parties since most of the new promoters will
be around of at least a year and better parties come with more experience
(ie Nomad, bagok, utra 5, GK).  Those promoters who have been around for a
while I hope will continue to stay around and produce quality parties
(Gathering, Wicked, F&F, space children and others).  The influx of new
"blood" into the scene does produce a demand but this is not a necessity to
solve these "problems" we share with our scene.
PLUR is what we need more of and spreading more positive energy to our
scene will do more good than adding more newbies to the scene.

I dislike catagoizing people.  But a raver doesn't have to have all those
physical items to promote positive energy.  Though I've been known to carry
a whistle or two, some stickers, candy and the occational vicks bottle, but
I don't have to show my suport for a party.  <there's those ear muffs>

My REAL world includes drugs now and then in the fringes.  I don't rely 
on them, i just enjoy them now and then - kind of like going to a movie 
that lasts for hours and stars ME!  haha.  :)  I enjoy the feeling of 
being straight a LOT.  But i do also enjoy the sensation of being kinda 
out there.  It's a change fom the norm, and i like to mentally shake 
myself up a little now and then, whether it's reading a difficult book, 
watching a well-crafted, mind-stretching movie ("rosencrantz and 
guildenstern are dead" is one of my faves!), eating something i've never 
eaten before, or ingesting a little substance ...

IMHO
pounce :)

DANCING alters my normal state of mind.  Does that make dancing harmful?
I hope not.  Dancing alters my state of mind so much that any drugs I may or
may not have taken become irrelevent.

Or unmask everything, depending on the drug.

 Just wanted to mention here that this article isn't clear on the fact  
that some wild mushrooms can be fatal if ingested. Most wild mushroom 
toxins have no known antidote and if you have ingested toxic mushrooms 
then all the doctor can do is pump your stomach (useless if you wait 
until you feel really ill).

Well fam', just got back in from the Seattle trip.  All is well.  I think
they are facing a lot and most seem to be dealing with it quite well.  There
is really not a "scene" there...like what we know and love in The City.  But
such is the diversity of this planet.  I think we should be thankfull for
what we have in SF as far as dancing and music goes.  Truly, it is one of
the best places in the world!!!!!!!  Seattle was great, however, it was most
difficult to find any rave scene whatsoever.  There was a lot of that rap,
hip-hop stuff they call "rave" music, but to me its not even close to what
the SF DJ artists can produce at a happening and viby event.  One supposed
rave party sported a "break dancing" contest...which is far from the rave
scene I know and love in SF.  The outdoors, hiking, shopping and ambiance of
Seattle are hard to beat though.  It's a fantastic place to be.  But as they
say, "I left my heart in San Francisco".  I did not make it to Electrolush,
but have heard good things about it.  I thought there would be other
gatherings to be found, but either I missed out or there were none.

Love,

Troy J.
(Wowser)

PS.  Does anyone know about the scene in Vancouver, BC?  By what I saw in
Seattle, BC seems THE place to be in the Pacific NorthWest.  Any comments?
(Feel free to send me a personal note on this)  Thanks!

hello friends,

some of us take lots of drugs.

some of us take no drugs at all.

some of us believe that drugs will decrease the quality of our life.

some of us believe that drugs will improve it.

i'm not going to tell you what i think, because it doesn't matter.

i love all of my family-- and that means YOU, no matter how much or how
little of various substances you choose to ingest...

the next time you see me at a party, i will gladly give you a hug
regardless of either of our states of intoxication...

plurally,

brian

ok, you can go back to fighting now...

This is great!  Now that they are going to start cracking down on drugs,
we can finally convict the CIA!  Oh wait, they are helping with the

Dole Ad Says Drugs the New 'Nuclear' Threat

SANTA BARBARA, Ca (Reuter) - Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole
picked one of the most chilling images in American political history Monday
to drive home his campaign theme that drug abuse is as great a threat as
nuclear war.

A stark new black-and-white Dole television campaign ad uses the famous
image of a little girl picking a daisy -- first used in 1964 by Democrat
Lyndon Johnson, who followed the girl's image with that of a nuclear
mushroom cloud.

``Thirty years ago, the biggest threat to her was nuclear war,'' the
narration says. ``Today the threat is drugs.''

The new commercial was released Monday in Santa Barbara, where Dole is on a
working vacation, and in Washington. Paid for by the Republican National
Committee and authorized by Bob Dole's presidential campaign, it will appear
starting Tuesday in selected markets, including Chicago where the Democrats
are having their nominating convention.

Dole, campaigning near Chicago Sunday, accused President Clinton of
``raising the white flag'' in the war on drugs after a survey last week
found that illegal drug use from 12-17 year-olds had doubled in the past
four years.

In that speech, Dole did not use the nuclear imagery but he did call drug
trafficking the ``moral equivalent of terrorism.''

The new ad, which dissolves from the ``daisy girl'' to harsh images of a
crack pipe, a heroin spoon and a needle stuck in an arm, attacks Clinton's
drug record and concludes ``America deserves better.''

The ad will rotate with another one, released last week as part of a $3.5
million ad buy, on Dole's economic policy and his pledge to slash taxes and
balance the budget.

Dole was in a secluded cottage on the grounds of the luxurious Biltmore
Hotel in Santa Barbara. He had some meetings with advisers, but no public
events scheduled Monday, and his aides said most of his day was devoted to
relaxing and soaking up the sun in the nation's biggest state, with 54
electoral votes.

He has a few campaign events scheduled for later this week, but the plan is
to maintain a fairly low profile during the Chicago convention. Similarly,
Clinton vacationed in Jackson, Wyoming while the Republicans convened in San
Diego to nominate Dole.

Dole Brands Drugs Moral Terrorism, Vows War

PALOS PARK, Il. (Reuter) - Campaigning within shouting distance of Chicago
on the eve of the Democratic convention, Republican presidential candidate
Bob Dole Sunday vowed an all-out war on illegal drugs which he decried as
the ``moral equivalent'' of terrorism.

Harshly attacking the White House for what he called a ''Don't Worry, Be
Happy'' stance on drugs, Dole promised to deploy all resources necessary to
fight drugs -- including the army, the navy, the Coast Guard, the Central
Intelligence Agency and the National Guard.

Citing the study released last week that showed that drug abuse has doubled
since President Clinton took office, Dole blasted what he characterized as a
``Don't Worry, Be Happy'' attitude of the Democratic administration.

``This president has been known not for his eloquence but his silence,'' he
said. ``This administration replaced the unambiguous message of ``Just say
no'' with this message: 'Just say nothing.'''

``We will treat drugs for what they are -- the moral equivalent of
terrorism,'' Dole said. ``The terrorism of drugs destroys our young peole
and hijacks America's future.''

Breaking with a tradition in which candidates do not venture close to their
opponents' nominating conventions, Dole made the speech at a picnic and
rally in a park in affluent suburbs southwest of Chicago, where the
Democratic convention begins Monday. Dole campaigns in Oregon later Sunday,
and starts a working vacation in Santa Barbara, California, on Monday.

In a speech that dwelt far more on stopping drug traffic than on prevention
and education, Dole noted the traditional reluctance to use the military to
confront domestic problems but said drugs come from abroad and are thus not
only a home-grown problem.

He said that if elected he would call on his defense secretary and military
leaders to draw up battle plans for the war on drugs, including contingency
plans for interdiction along the southern U.S. border.

``Now, one would hope that such interdiction by U.S. military forces would
never need to take place. But just as U.S. combat readiness is a deterrent
to those who would challenge us in a war, so will the knowledge that all the
capabilities -- I said all the capabilities -- of our federal government
will be used to reduce the flow of drugs across our border if necessary,''he
said.

In an oblique reference to recent reports that some White House staffers had
used drugs in the past, he said his own stance would be ``zero tolerance''
from the White House on down to every workplace and school in America.

``In the Dole administration we're going to return to what works -- a clear
and forceful policy of zero tolerance. That's zero tolerance. Zero tolerance
for drug sumugglers, zero tolerance for drug pushers. Zero tolerance for
drugs in the workplace and zero tolerance for illegal drugs period. Zero.
Zero. Zero.''

umm.. and this comes from Mr "I-don't-belive-tobacco-is-addictive"?
uh huh. 
tobacco addiction and lung cancer are obviously morally just causes then;
else how could dole support the tobacco industry?

maybe big drug cartels should start contributing to the republican campaign
fund. bet we'd have a complete reversal of opinion then. hmm...

Bruce,

I've heard and read the same thing!  That's why one must take long intervals
off the drug before they use it again!  Plus I've read it has a much better
effect on you when the intervals  between use are longer vs. every weekend!

your friend;

Antone!

Hello Everyone! 
I will be again venturing to Burning Man this year, with one slight
problem. My friend told me last December that our RV rental was taken care
of. I found out 3 days ago that she never made any reservations.

So, I was wondering... does anyone have space for two people, preferably
in the VW camp or nearby?

Or, if there is no space available, would any of you wonderful people be
willing to let us wash our contacts, faces, and maybe even let us use your
stove a couple of times?

I'd realllly appreciate it! :)              love, Alex

Dear All;

        An aid to republican candidate Robert Dole was said to observe the

Dole campaign headquarters was yet to comment on accusations that Bob Dole

Hello everyone,

    Well we have decided that it would probably be a really good idea,
that since some of you sfravers are going to BM, we have tickets for
the three year anniversary/finale there.

    Anyways, we will be giving some tickets to Wayne. Of course you
will probably find him at the VW camp most of the time. We don't know
how many to give him thought, so if you would, please respond to me
privatly if you would like to have tickets put on hold for you at the
VW camp. If you don't respond, the might be sold out (or spoken for) by
the time you find Wayne.

    At the moment there are tickets @ Solid Grooves 368 so Bascom ave

Does this sound familiar to anyone? I believe there was a story
recently on NPR about the Korean government using the military to bomb
students who expressed "unsafe" political views. Well, what's the
difference?

Everyone's looking for a good witch hunt.

   So, for the past day or so I've been thinking if I should actually take
my Big BBQ to BM?  It would be nice to have it, but is it worth dragging it
out there. Let me know what you all think.

For those that don't already know, my BBQ is about 6' long and about 3' wide.

Some of us like quieter camping, some of us like huge mega-theme camps.  
Some of us like being in a rave environment 24-7, while some prefer the 
diversity the main camp offers.  One thing I could bank on is that most 
all of us sfravers will be at the Techno Ghetto once the night comes. :)
See you on the playa, wherever you may be!

love,
Amy

You will find most people identifying themselves primarily as a raver (that
is, don't necessarily get/don't care about the Burning Man experience, may
just think that Burning Man is just a big rave) staying at Rave Camp. This
camp is isolated two miles away from the actual Burning Man event to create
a sound-proof safety buffer.

You will find that most all SF Raves people that are more diverse (i.e.
they can tell you about the things that they do in their life of which
raving is probably just one of them) in the Irrational Geographic Mega
Theme Camp, one component of which is the VW Camp.. We will have approx. 18
RV's in this camp... and most of these people are high-tech types.

I don't know where anybody else is staying.

Dear All;

        If everything comes together today like I have assurances that it

you need to locate me while at BM, ask any Black Rock Ranger with a walkie
talkie, and they will be able to locate me for you. 

        For all those wondering about; well you know what, yes I do & yes I
will.

Peace
Brian

   Just letting you all know that I have 2 yes and 2 no. It will be for
anyone who wants to use it. But if there is not enough people interested in
it then I'll leave it behind. If I bring it and it doesn't get used, It
would be a waste of time and energy to bring it. If I decide on my own to
not bring it, and people wanted to use it and brought things to BBQ, then
that would be a bummer too. So I'm leaving it to the majority. I'll let you
all know if it will be there or not by 3pm today. So, if you either do or
don't think it's a good idea, let me know by 2:30pm. Thanks...

Hi All,

I was at my companies, Excite - the search engine, all hands meeting
on Monday when a product manager anounced that he was looking for
some employee volunteers to possibly go to Burning Man with a company
rented truck filled with water bottles to hand out for free at BM
as a promotion. Of course the bottles will have our logo/url on them
but he said there will be no large advertising banners and whoever
wants the water will have to go to our truck to pick it up...it will
not be handed out like flyers. Concerned, I told him that this could
possibly backfire since a positive vibe is something which cannot be
bought, sold, or commercialized. We all know that what makes real
underground parties so special is that positive vibe and what creates
it is UNCONDITIONAL LOVE freely given without concern for ego
gratification or identification.

My purpose in this post is not to start a flame war but to ask for
your valued opinions on our product manager's idea (good or bad) ?
Personally, I don't think it would be a good idea for the reasons
stated above.

Thank you all for your input and I'll gladly forward your constructive
criticism to our product manager!!

Peace and UNCONDITIONAL LOVE always,
John

Hello all,

I'm shopping around for a mixer with a digital sampler and was

would be a good buy?

Thank you for your help!

PS: Special thanks to Peter Sandifer from the list for letting me

  HEy all.. it was a great weekend.  Just had this wonderful Idea (not my
own-- the credit goes to a friend)  to have a huge party in a movie theater.
 Buy out the place and party in-between the seats while Trainspotting plays
on multiple screens.  And if that doesn't convince you all that drugs are
bad... then I don't know what will.

     STOP FIGHTING!!!                    <<<<RAVEON>>>>

[ to sfraves list ]

 I didn't get to make it to MAD after all last night, but I assume it
went off as usual! 

 I'd like to say "Aloha" and "Au Revoir" to all the ravers I know who are
going to Burning Man ! Be careful, have an ecstatic time, and come back
to us with a minimum of toasting , dehydration, and aches!

 Looks like Sunset will be doing a burning in solidarity will you all
at the Black Rock Playa this Sunday - I definitely will make an effort
to send a psychic "hello" to all of you in Nevada during it!

Which is, incidentally, exactly what bugs the "old school" BM people about

No, youre not being "holier than thou". Actually that night I spent a
lot of time thinking about exactly what you bring up. Now, understand
that I don't go to raves just for the drugs. But youre right, that night
I was not having a very cool time untill the E kicked in. Partially it
was because I thought I just blew $20. But I just kept thinking: "So is
this it? The only way I am going to enjoy myself at parties is if I'm on
something?" It scares me. I can't keep doing this all my life (none of
us I think can really expect to reach a ripe old age and continue our
weekly/biweekly/monthly indulgence of E or other such substances). I
might start getting invloved in promoting parties even if I'm just
handing out flyers. I'll be sober, but I'll feel better because I can
say that I'll have given back to the scene and helped promote it.

And that, my friends, is why we're all joining forces to create a proper
Burning Man Vibe at Irrational Geographic -- the event's only "Mega Theme
Camp" rather than stay down in the Techno Ghetto or somewhere off in the
fringes taking away the core BM experience but not contributing to it.

See you on that beautiful, featureless, other-worldly place, our home away
from home. The Playa.

truthfully i have no idea where i'll camp, it may be at teh rave camp, 
but realistically, how much time do you think i'll spend at my tent? i'll 
defnetly be wandering around maincamp and everywhere else to see *all* of 
burning man and create some of it along the way, so i hope just cuz i may 
camp in a certain area it doesnt classify me as 'thinks BM is a big rave' 
lets just go out there and make it happen, BM will be 1o,ooo different

 My boyfriend and I happened to flip to this on TV,  and saw this whole
 speech...it was the FUNNIEST thing we had heard in so long!  We were totally
 ROTFL!  Just the way he said it...you had to see it.  It's funny, but also
 really scary...now we don't really do that much anymore, but even if you don't
 do, have never done drugs, I still think that you should be concerned about
 what this guy is saying, if you care anything about people's personal freedom. 
 Everyone has to draw their own line, I guess...but the way he is talking 
 about drugs, and drug users, and "waging war"...it's totally scary to me. 
 Just completely uneducated.  With this guy as president we can forget 
 about ever learning from drugs...research on Ibogaine, etc...or even 
 other psychoactives...you can tell just by the way Dolt talks that 
 he has no clue of the beneficial aspects that could come from researching 
 drugs, even in the strictest of manners...
 But I'm sure he'll have no problems with tobacco or alcohol or their lucrative
 industries.
 
 Let's get out there and VoTe, PeoPle! :-)

you'll be so juiced up on adrenaline you won't even *think* about e.  It's
a different buzz, but it don't make your spine go crunch...
Actually you can often find Technics for less...but in any case it is money
much better spent,  you're contributing to the scene, you're expressing

I personally believe that Burning Man should remain a sanctuary from such
activties.  Imagine, if you will, the impact of such a give away next year,
and the year after, and the year after.  Undoubtedly the marketing snowball
effect will occur at Burning Man, and has already begun, but why add to the
giant wad of marketing gluttony?  Is it really an effective campaign? Will
people really save their bottles for the precious URL, or even go back home
and say, "Damn, that free water sure was nice, I should go check out their
web site?"  I seriously doubt people will remember where the water came
from in the first place.

Why doesn't EXcite hand out...oh, I don't know...something more soul
searching?  =)  Something more EXy, or something.

Thank you for not selfishly seeing this as an opportunity to get a free
ride to BM, John.

Burning Man attendees are not a target market!  They just want to be freaks
in an environment as free from the corporate world as possible.  We get
that all day, every day, "We deserve a break today?!"

That's my take on...

Thanks John!

Tony

Of course not, I hope I didn't give that impression and it's not how I live
my life. As I said, moderation and diversity in your kicks, be it mountain
climbing or dropping the occasional E is the key. In your original post you
warned about drugs being dangerous, my point was that there are many other
(legal) activities which can be equally harmful, but for which _your_
right to decide to take part in them is accepted in this world. I'm not
trying to say we should all just watch our lives slip by being doped.
I defend your and my right to do with our body/lives whatever we feel
like.

You are talking about an extreme situation where a person is fully
occupied with drugs, raving etc. I agree completely with what your saying,
but this was (as I felt it) not the message of your original post, which
just stated (very generally): "drugs are bad". I can assure you (despite
my "virtual name" on this list that I lead a very happy and satisfying
real life, in a very real world. And to be clear, I have been in a
phase that you describe, living from one rave to another (while still
getting my PhD, mind you) and my guess is lots of people go through
such a stage. It's very educating, about yourself, your friends and
the world and usually last only for a few years at most, after which
other things (in the real world) need your undivided attention.

> It's cool sometimes, but realize that you can't always live like that.

Again, I agree. But let's say your hobby of choice is mountainclimbing
or car racing, you start a family, have kids etc. realizing that you
could get killed in an accident while enjoying yourself. What to do?
We all take risks and I fail to see the difference between _moderate_
drug use and some sports and other activities.

Precisely, and I hope I didn't give you the impression that I am flaming
you, I just wanted to clarify my point of view. I think that in the end
we agree on most of this issue.

Now I got to get back to my precious crack pipe... (just kidding!),

They already are, and their profits are directly linked to a continuing
"war on drugs" policy. It's a policy that ensures maximum profits for
both the lawmakers and the lawbreakers, and it's the people in the
middle that are getting shut out.  The Mafia, especially the  Cuban
Mafia have been been a strong supporter of Republicans due to their
traditional anti-castro/anti-communist stance. You see, they're still
pissed off about having all their casinos and US-run businesses
nationalized by Castro some 30 years ago... But they've been gainfully
employed in the last 20 years by importing cocaine from south/central
america, and now heroin too. Remember that the Mafia rose to power
during prohibition because they were making huge profits in
distributing and making illegal alchohol.

The other group that are big republican supporters are police, prison
guards, prison commissary, and prison construction companies. The
employees of this "sector" make up one of the most powerful
pro-republican political action committees in the US, and they have
everything to gain by ensuring that 1 in 4 black/latino males are
incarcerated for drug-related offenses (since there are no other inner
city status-job programs for black/latino youths).

And of course, it is well known that the CIA helped set up the heroin
importation business in the US in the early 70's as a means by which
they enabled various Thai/Laos/Cambodia "warlords" to amass power in a 
supposed "fight against communism" in Vietnam and the rest of Southeast
Asia. The CIA again used money from the illegal drug trade to finance
"underground" anti-communist operations happened again in the 80's -- 
the rise of cocaine abuse in the US can be directly attributed to the
CIA's use of cocaine sales to buy weapons for the contras in another
covert fight against the communists in South and Central America (since
congress wasn't about to give money to the contras -- c.f. Olliver
North and the Iran/Contra affair). George Bush, as head of the CIA, set
up Noriega's government in Panama as the main conduit for cocaine trade
in the late 70's, and this continued on until Noriega grew too insolent
and powerful with our help; so Bush had to "invade" Panama and capture
Noriega as a drug dealer in the late 80's to keep him from telling us
the real deal.

So when you hear the republicans ranting about how the US and 
Reagan/Bush were central to the downfall of communism, please consider
that this was a Pyrrhic victory at best because we now have a nation at
war with itself over Crack/Coke/Heroin as our addictions financed this
supposed downfall.

Prohibition is big business. Drug importers can make massive profits
due to the clandestine and risky nature of their business, which
requires lots of political side-taking (bribes and high-level contacts)
to ensure that their business remains unfettered, and that their
competition gets caught. Those that make the money off the bribes have
everything to gain. ANd of course, it is keeping a lot of police and
prison officals employed.  It's simply good business all around and
that's the #1 goal of the republicans. All that "christian morals" and
"family values" stuff is just a useful whitewash for what is really
going on, as the other big drug business the Republicans support is 
"christianity" -- this "opiate of the masses" allows people's
attentions to remain misdirected at false threats and evils -- enabling
all this heinous shit to happen right under everybody's noses w/o much
popular dissent. After all, our main objection to "communism" that
rallied Amerikkkans to fight it was their supposed "godlessness."

BINGO!  It's the same attitude you see at a club.  Someone isn't having a 
good time, so they order another beer.  And another.  Until they're lost in 
the haze and wouldn't know if they were having a good time or just a drunken 
time.  The PEOPLE and the MUSIC do it for me.  And often, even if the music 
isn't quite there, the people make it right.  No drug is going to replace 
that.  I'm not saying I'm innocent here, but for myself, I've had just as 
good a time without as I have with.

     I'm back...
     
     Good to see we're all worrying about all the right things.  Is the 
     moral of the story don't take water from people with a gold tooth, or 
     avoid fat chicks doing the bounce.  If a gangsta wants to go to a 
     rave, let em go... just no fussin and fighting.  I think we all need 
     to take a deep breath and let go a little.
     
     As for the big promoted raves, if it wasn't for this list I would 
     never know about the small ones (thanks for this list BTW!), and I'd 
     be stuck going to the big ones.  I like the small ones more because 
     it's more like an intimate party and less like a concert or other 
     super size event (kinda that "I love the friends I have gathered on 
     this thin raft" feeling).
     
     I've been to great, peaceful parties thrown by people who obviously 
     run in gangs, and I've gotten my ass kicked in Venice by "mellow peace 
     loving" rastafarians.  How far is this shit going to go on before 
     somebody starts throwing all white rich kid raves?
     
     Relax, think about why you go, and decide.  If you want to split a 
     ride let me know.  If you need help, let me know.  If you're in 
     trouble and I can help, let me know.  Raving is about letting go of 
     that so and so looks like this and that bullshit.  Walk up to the next 
     person that freaks you out at a rave, and say hello and smile.  See 
     them smile back?  That's vibe.  Do it again.  Lay it down.  Spread it 
     wide.  Not a DJ, not the decorations, not the venue.  Let go of your 
     rage, there's a beautiful person inside.  
     
     Peace,
     AndyW

 Just wondering if this was going to be another: see you're preppy
ex-grilfriend and her friends dance around with a buch of gangstas next to 
the circle of overweight women doing "the bounce" ??? Or is it just going to 
be a big drugfest with people losing their mind trying tabs for the first 
time from some guy with the gold tooth, while freakin with some half naked 
bimbo slut girl , and everyone going back to school the next day thinkin, 
"I'm cool, I went to a rave.". Hope not.
Sorry anyone I may have offended.
     
And I know school didn't really start yet.
     
Too much, too much.
     
If someone passes a bottle of whatever around, don't even let it touch your 
skin.
     
The best parties I've been to were the smallest ones. If I wantd to go to a 
carnival I'd go . .. to a carnival.

(a non-denominational) AMEN to voting!  Part of the reason why many of us 
feel unrepresented by any public figures in govt. is because we (as an 
age group; specifically newly egligible to vote) are among the least 
likely to vote.  It really does count for a lot(esp. considering what a 
small percentage of the population does vote).

Pertaining to Dole, and conservatives in general, two of my grandparents 
are as right-wing conservative as one can get, and they say things like, 
"Liberals first, Cancer SECOND."  We're talking shocking, even for a 
non-Democrat like myself.  (If you're curious, they're quoting a guy 
named Ken Hamblin, a talk show host after Rush Limbaugh on the AM 
channels.)  In fact, I'd considered myself a Republican until I had to 
hear Rush Limbaugh every morning while I visited them.  (And I'm NOT 
flaming any Republican ravers- I just find that anyone making statements 
like that is sadly closed-minded.)

Peace,
Benjamin

corresponding place. Please contact Oliver through private E-mail.

Thanx,

The Frying Dutchman

[ to sfraves list ]

 Just being a worry-wart here : I gave/sold my two BM tickets to two
folks here on SFRaves. I made sure to give them a signed letter from
me, stating that I had transfered my registration tickets to these
two guys ,a nd if there was any problem, I could be reached at 
phone number so-and-so.

 Maybe a little overkill, but when I asked about having someone else
use my tickets , the BM rep on the phone told me that , as a minimum,
the BM gatekeepers will want the person(s) holding the tickets to know
the name of the person the tickets were purchased by. The tickets
are numbered, and mine were not in consecutive order.

 SO - if you're usingsomeone else's ticket to get into Burning Man, make 
sure you know what name they used to order the tickets! Or, you might 
have to pay $40 at the gate!

 Your alarm for the day ...

All drugs are bad when not done in moderation.  Also, all drugs are
different, so to group them together and say "Bad drugs! Bad!" is
like saying, "Isuzu Troopers have a tendency to roll over, therefore all
vehicles have a tendency to roll over."  Some vehicles are easier to roll
than others, but anyone can roll any car if they don't drive moderately.

     Hey...
     
     I went to Elevation in LA too (I wasn't going to blab, but now that 
     you brought it up)... holy fuck that was live.  I was the guy who 
     showed up at 4:00 am with the teddy bear stuffed in his pants truckin 
     his ass off!  We have to do more of those!!!!  ...and I question that 
     whole no E in LA comment too ;)  It was soo totally fun... We need to 
     put that sense of adventure back every chance we get!!!  Too fun 
     driving Cruchman's car through the most fucked up dirt roads I've ever 
     seen (did everybody make that wrong turn?) Driving by the forest fire, 
     with the moon stained red (erieee)..  and finally almost giving up, 
     and right as we're standing there hearing Boom boom boom whispering 
     through the canyon.  Running through the blackness to find the source. 
      It was the morning of my best friends birthday and we were together.  
     Coming to a clearing and finding these gorgeous folks dancing and 
     standing around meeting and greeting... DJ going off on trancey ass 
     house ... people looking out for each other... meeting everybody... 
     had to jet because a newbie we brought freaked out (it was a bit over 
     the top for a first rave)... too much, can't wait, my birthday is the 
     20th of september... how come there's no party ( I could throw my 
     own.. mmm?) ... I love this community.
     
     All hail VIBE!!!  It WAS off the scale.  Energy, love, and the this 
     night could go on forever feeling.  Can't frame it, can't put it up, 
     just remember...
     
     Long live the underground.... everywhere.
     
     AndyW
     
     P.S.       As for those asking about the Blitzkrieg event, the name is 
     Ron D. Core, and the crew is Dr. Freeclouds, one of the most awesome 
     promotion crews/record stores there are (even though I'm not into 
     hardcore/gabber).  I don't think he needs his ass kicked, but if you 
     agree that that was a bad name for an event, you can visit at:
     
     http://www.drfreeclouds.com
     
     I hope you weren't serious about that... there are better ways to 
     change a mind that bashing it in.  I think that's why we have a 
     problem with the term Blitzkreig in the first place.  I'm sure he'll 
     understand if you take your time to explain it.  Not everybody 
     understands how severe WWII was (most of my family lived through it in 
     Poland, where the Blitz was most deadly), and how close to home it is 
     for a lot of us.

Hey,

So not much is being mentioned about the non-burning man ravers.  I really
don't think MEGGA BUZZ is the only thang is going on.. (But I could be
wrong...) 
What else is going on during this three day Labour day weekend.  I think that
Spundae has a traditional labor day sunday biggie-type clubbish thing.  What
about this Friday'n'Saturday???

Just curious,

Adam

 Well, so for the it 5 yes 4 no .  I just got off the from with a few
U-Haul places to get a trailer for it. Since the back of my truck will be
full of camping supplies and bikes, I'll need a trailer to haul the BBQ in.
This will cost from $140-$200 for the trip to BM and back. not including
the $250 deposit. So, if I can't find a cheaper means of transpo for the
BBQ, it will have to stay behind. I can't put it in the back of my truck
because there won't be any room for anything else. I'll see what I can do.
I'll let you know. By 3pm what the decision is.

Interesting piece in todays SUCK on the current state of audio on the web -
thought you folks might dig it.  Also, if anyone has any 1200s they would

White Riot 
Remember the whole concept of "noise pollution" from the '70s? 
It's not really a problem anymore, thanks to the insulation and isolation Sony 
introduced with the Walkman in 1981. Today there are extensive lines of
personal 
noise-cancellation products, which generate an equal and opposite sound wave
for every unwanted burp, fart, and squeal the modern age can hurl at you. If
you'll just slip these luxuriant headphones on, you'll be whisked away into
an Elysium of soundlessness. Nonsense, we say. Never mind the Quiet Zone
2000. Let's have some rigorous hardware handshaking. 

For some time we've been searching for a plug-in, add-on, extension, or
preference file that would allow that pure rush of information - the white
noise you hear when your modem connects - to play in the background
throughout the workday: ambient music for the info age, Muzak for the
digerati. Instead, a handful of modem manufacturers actually have the nerve
to offer silent dial-up. Actually, the coding for silence was a cinch,
easily predating the invention of the modem back in 1963. For some reason -
apparently there were more pressing concerns - it took thirty years for
manufacturers to respond to the simple question, "Does it have to make that
godawful sound?" Whatever. 

So far, the underwhelming success of online audio has been entertaining to
everyone outside the entertainment industry. Despite the hype, there was no
real reason to fear that RealAudio or TrueSpeech would compete with, say,
the Delco in the dash of your ratty Ford Fiesta. The excitement of streamed
audio quickly gave way to the same old dry hump we've grown accustomed to:
chronic downloads of .aiff, .au, .mpeg,  and .wav files. But last week, an
upstart California firm announced the imminent release of their
audio-streaming server,  in collaboration with Dolby Laboratories (the same
people who brought you the ubiquitous but not-very-useful-after-all  Dolby
Noise Reduction). Liquid Audio, they claim, will be the first real
breakthrough in quality streaming, though they tactfully avoid the one word
that would have had us shaking our leg: "stereo." 

Still, they managed to raise a few eyebrows by asserting that such a
breakthrough - when or if it ever materializes - will do wonders for the
music industry by making quality, seamless sound available on the Web. The
kicker is their claim that this 
technology will be a real comfort to musicians, labels, and publishers who
are already 
royally pissed at the quantity - never mind the quality - of unlicensed,
uncredited, and unapproved online copies of their heavily copyrighted audio. 

Whether it's noise gates, compression, and streaming, or Clipper chips,
SurfWatch, and 
Terms of Service, it's clear the online industry is concentrating on its
filters in an effort to provide some kind of guarantee on content quality.
We're here to say, "Filters be damned!"  Give us a straight shot of the real
thing. If Huxley, Leary,  Alpert, and the gang considered the unstupefied
human mind short of a trickle valve, a door of perception waiting to be
flung open, we say turn on the firehoses. 

We can only hope that cable modems will come with audio monitors that'll
reproduce the 
blast of six-figure bps in surround-sound. Who cares about sheafs of online
newspapers and new media hacks? With their reheated news clips and metamedia
punditry, who knows what they're actually gibbering about anyway? 

Like any moron raised on late-twentieth-century radio, it's not like we're
listening to the words. In fact, we can barely hear them above that annoying
ringing in our ears - is that the modem connecting or the siren call of
tinnitus? What difference does it make? It's an incurable condition either way.

Is anyone in Fresno going to BM?  If so, could you possibly give Marty a 
ride?  She's one of my absolute best party buddies and she used to be on 
SFRaves before school and nursing sucked up all her time and energy.  We 
were going to go, but my car took a $1300 nose dive (right on the San Mateo 
bridge, btw) and now I'm not going.  She's got a tarp for shade and a bunch 
of supplies, she just needs a ride there.

Reply with your number and I'll pass it on to her.  Thanks so much!!

I wrote something like this once. A script in Lisp that would grab all
AU format audio files from web pages that could be found on the web,
then download as many as it could in parallel and start playing as many
as it could in parallel as soon as  they were done downloading. It
would do this until you stopped it or the machine crashed, whichever
came first. In terms of load, it pretty much rendered an SGI
workstation completely inoperable -- you'd have to power cycle the
machine as it stopped noticing keyboard input after a while. Then
again, this was the same keyboard/workstation that Marc Andreesen had
spilled beer on back before he sold out. I think the machine was cursed.

Anyways, the audio was very, very noisy. It was cool to hear occasional
recognizable snippets of ren and stimpy (you eeeeediot!) flow by, mixed
in with all the other internet cacophony. It was of course completely
random, playback determined by what audio file would allow itself to be
could be found first, which backbone was fastest, and the overall load
on the internet. Since this was back in '94, of course, there wasn't 
as much crap out on the web as there is now. And the internet wasn't as
slow due to all the lame advertizing crap people are filling their lame
web pages with. After all, we all know the internet was built solely
for the purpose of playing back all the audio files you can find on it
at the same time, and not for making money or commerce.

Anyways, I let this beast run over a long lunchtime back back when "my"
company was still a startup, just to annoy the hell out of people (or
was it art, i'm not sure). I can't do stuff like that now as our new
masters would probably figure out a way to fire me for abusing the
internet...

[Yet another new mailer for me -- PINE on shellx.best.com...]

I'm leaving for the rave -- er, Burning Man -- on Thursday afternoon,
with plans to reach the site Friday around noon.

I'll be joing a camp with several friends and friends of friends in the
outskirts -- a sort of "Suburban Hell" theme, I guess. The site will be
marked with a giant helium balloon, if anyone is interested in coming to
visit (although, given this is my first BM ever, I'll probably spend very
little time at my tent!).

Jamie will be there with me, offering to give astrology readings to anyone
interested.

Hope to see and meet you,

E.N.

Sadly, my group of 2 RVs is intent on camping somewhere in between the main 
Burning Man Camp and the Rave Camp (closer to BM Main than Rave).  So it 
looks like I won't be with the Irrational-VW Camp. Bummer...

But Happily, I've managed to keep our group together and we'd love to add 
more raving freaks to the mix.  So far we've got 2 RVs and 1 small sound 
system sheltered by the Solle Boogie Crew Tribal Sweat Lodge.  Feel free to

Either way it's all big & beautiful!!!

Some people asked where you can learn about information that is
currently politically censored by the government and corporate
amerikkka. There's tons of books out there on the CIA, vietnam war, 
military industrial complex, etc. that you can find that report on
these. they may either be true, false, or embellished. I don't have any
names I can quote off the top of my head right now.

More important are the sorts of media-deconstructions that show how
you've been lied to in the press and TV news, e.g the award winning 
documentary "The Panama Deception" done by some public broadcasting
syndicate back in the early 90's. Also Noam Chomsky's "Manufacturing
Consent" which can be rented in many video stores (e.g. Tower). These
should be required viewing before submitting yourself to the televised
brainwashing of the Republican or Democratic National Conventions.

On the radio, there's a weekly program in the late  afternoon (4-5PM)
on National Public Radio syndicate hosted by Jerry Brown (88.5 FM, I
think) -- I forgot the name of the show, I think it's something like
"To the COntrary". I listen to this show occasionally and it is very
interesting. Last time I listened in there was a very good, 
eye-opening interview with Gore Vidal on the lies inherent in our
moribund two-party system, and the hopelessness of our future as
Americans unless there is a serious revolution that takes down our
current corrupt government.

On the more conspiracy-theory end of things, is Dave Emory's show on
Sunday 7PM-10PM on 89.7 KFJC. SOme of the stuff he says sounds totally
outrageous, and some of it is. I remember hearing about the
Iran/Contra/Ollie-North/CIA-drug-running stuff on this show back in the
mid-late 80's and early 90's, well before it was ever mentioned in the
mainstream press.  Everybody was dismissing this as conspiracy theorist
paranoia, and it was so out there that it sounded very outlandish to me
as well. The eye-opener happened when, a few year later (after Reagan
had come and gone, and Bush was in power), articles on the exact same
things that Dave Emory had been ranting about suddely began surfacing
in the main stream press (usually hidden deep inside the paper, rarely
on the first page). Still, you'd barely hear a squeak about it on the
TV news, other than the Ollie North hearings which totally obfuscated
what actually happened in the Iran/Contra affair into a psychodrama of
a courageous ex-marine who was proudly serving his country "right or
wrong".) People simply failed to notice how they had been manipulated
to keep supporting the corrupt Reagan presidency, as he heroically took
credit for freeing the US hostages in Iran, something that Carter had
failed to do with all his diplomacy. What people didn't want to hear
was that the CIA had done a deal with the Iranians to hold on to the
hostages until after Reagan was elected, at which point they magically
gave back the hostages, in trade for arms they needed to fight a war
with Iraq. This was financed by cocaine trade money funneled by the CIA
in order to hide that (and US covert support for the contras) from
congress. People didn't want to hear that Bush as VP and CIA director,
had set this up, and now he was president, as this proved that the
fundamental "balance of power" inherent in the design of the US govt.
had been subverted.

After all, the linkages between Iran/Contra/Reagan/Bush/CIA/drugs was
the third fundamental turning point in showing most of us that the USA
was neither constitutional or democratic. The second being Nixon's
resignation after watergate. The first loss of innocense being the
assasination of Kennedy by Republican Cuban Mafiosis who found Johnson,
and later Nixon to be much better aligned with their anti-communist
anti-castro, pro-defense, big business stance. (this is alluded to in
Oliver Stone's melodramatic portrayals of standard conspiracy theory
dogma in the movies "JFK" and "Nixon". He unfortunately did a great
disservice to the hard investigative work of all the conspiracy
journalists by making it seem so tidy and unbelievable).

Finally, for articles that aren't censored by Corporate Amerikkka,
check out the Utne Reader (which thanks to my girlfriend's subscription
I now read much more regularly) or the NorthCoast Express. Feel free to
read ONLY the "people" and "fluff" sections of USA Today, Time,
Newsweek, Wired, Business Week, Washington Post, New Yor Times,
Chronicle, etc. for information that hasn't been filtered and censored
to have the appropriate political spin of the day. But they're a joke
w/r/t  the news or unbiased opinions on public policy. THese sources
are controlled by the same powers that empower the US government
(ABC/NBC/Time-Warner/Westinghouse/General-ELectric) and they're
inherently biased to spin reality into popular consensus that
translates into political and corporate profits.

Want to do something about it?-- argue with people spouting crap like
"Reagan/Bush was a true american hero", "the republicans are
responsible for maintaining the moral and economic interests of this
nation." At the same time, realize that Bill Clinton ain't all that
either. He's really no better than the republicans and is available for
sale to the highest bidder.

Me? I'm voting for Ralph Nader and the Green Party. He's the only
person who in the last 30 years has been consistently pro-people, a
staunch advocate of consumer's rights and social responsibility.
Meanwhile,  both the Democrats and the Republicans have been
consistently pro corporate-america, anti-environment, anti-people --
their only concern is ensuring an unimpeded free-flow of dollars into
corporate and political coffers. The rest of their messages about "the
dream of america" is just a bunch of crap they use to con and dupe
people into voting for them.

A good book i've just read is
   _Ruses for War: American Interventionalism Since World War II_
which is a moderate, broadly-researched book on wars. And how the CIA
misleads the president and the media about them, the president misleads
congress about them, and the media misleads the public about them. Very
scary stuff, and highly recommended. I can dig up more details (like
the author's name :) if anyone's interested.

In light of the tone of the previous E-mail I sent, I will now communicate
on a more positive note..........London was the shit........awsome vibe,
many sound sytems, many different directions of music to choose from, and
many many cool people.... 
 
I have to say in 4 months I heard no-one (not one single person) dis anyone
elses party, or analyze (or is that anal-ize) what the scene should, could,
or would be......if only etc........nor discuss incessently the pro's and
con's of drugs vs. no drugs, musical styles vs. musical styles, or whatever
other dribble I see written from time to time (all too ofton) here on SFR.
(sorry, I guess thats a flame....huh) 
 
It was a whole new experience, one I'm sure I will miss......I reckon I can
only speak for my-self, when I say we have a lot to learn in the Bay Area
about co-operation harmony, and  imagination. 
 
It seems that we (including me at times).......love to TALK & BITCH about
whats wrong, and what we ought to do to change the direction etc..... I
only hope that some of you could see what harmony there is amongst the many
different rigs (sound systems) and how well the community works together to
overcome the current legal status (new laws pertaining to raves and
clubbers in general).......all I can say is.....I was inspired by the
attitude of the average party go'er (no not party goa).  
 
I saw and heard of the most insane concepts, very inventive and at the same
time sticking it to the police and government........for instance..... 
 
there was a huge party north of London, and every-one had to go in cars up
the motorway (freeway) to get there. Now the police got word of the party,
and set up a road block to stop the people from attending, and it created a
traffic jam that went for miles...... 
 
......so while they were stuck on the freeway, they dug up a portion of the
road and planted a couple of trees in the middle of the
highway.........awsome stuff...... 
 
they also have major street parties called "reclaim the streets" where they
meet in force and create many clever diversionary tacticts, and before you
know it they have overtaken a neighborhood and have a massive party before
the police know what hit em.............. and by then it's to late for the
bill (thats english for fuzz) to react or stop it.........If they tried,
they know the people will probably riot.........or so they think!!! 
 
It's these kinds of idea's that are inspirational to me, and I find the
British scene to be more mature, more inventive, more creative, and more
established.........we could learn from our distant older cousins.........(
I swear that is not a dis of our Bay Area....... just an insight of
Britain's scene) 
 
It's now no suprise to me that the theory that you have to be a british DJ
to be succesful, means something more than just a theory........they
brought with them a vibe we lacked here in 1990, and without their
influence, DJ's like me would'nt have been inspired and been as successful
as I have. (and it has grown to include many other U.S  DJ's in the mix
now)...........Those British DJ's who have had success here, did so because
of  an understanding of a vibe and attitude that was learned in the U.K in
the late 80's and early 90"s and they brought it here, it is because they
came from an environment where creativity, the musical environment, a
childlike imagination, and the state of the nation's economy gave rise to a
nation of house groovers and shakers. 
 
An additional factor that helps the British scene thrive, is that most
party goers are broke, and unlike America where I feel alot of woman looks
at you as a comodity (security, job, house, car  etc...) everyone just
faces the fact there all broke and gets on with it.......if you meet
someone, you fall in love, you live together, and you deal with the issues
of life together.  Money is not as big an issue, as it seems to be here.
It's about a persons vibe, and when an entire nation (generally speaking)
has that attitude, it helps to create a scene that will thrive for many
years to come. 
 
Some other basic differences are the volume of drugs and alchahol that are
consumed. here, I find that at a night club you will have about a 50-75% of
people drinking. where as in the U.K 98% are drinkers. In an underground
environment here, you will find very few alchahol drinkers, as they tend to
do drugs, (most commonly an E instead of drinking.), where as at an
underground in the U.K, people are poppin E's like there goin out of style,
in addition to drinking up a storm........it's completely mental. 
 
One of the elements I have to say we have the upper hand on, is the
consumption of cigarettes. In the U.K it's 99%, but here only about 40%. I
attribute that to healthier attitudes here, as well as the attitude that in
the U.K, the future is bleak, so have another drink, smoke a fag
(cigarette), pop another "pill" and roll another spliff. 
 
One of the most glaring differences, is the "Festival" attitude. While we
have Burning Man and an occaisional other Festy, Britain is innundated with
massive Festivals all summer long.......I went to a festival in Normandy,
France, and about 5,000 people showed up, and it was considered a failure,
where-as here a festival of 5,000 would be a good turnout. 
It is not un-common to get 35,000 people at a festy in the U.K, I have
heard estimates that next years Glastonberry festival will draw upwards of
300,000 people (no thats not a typo). 
 
All in all, I have been to good parties here and good parties there, I have
attended crap parties here, and crap parties there........I've heard good
and bad music both here and there, it's all really rather personal (based
on your own musical tastes). I'm not even sure I can explain why I feel the
U.K has it goin on, I think it's just a matter of fact, that the U.K. party
scene has had longer to devope and mature, and the average age of the club
goer in the U.K reaches into the late 20's and mid 30's (and the rest),
whereas here I run into lots of people in their teens and early 20's. 
Certainly being 37, I feel that I have more in common with an older crowd,
as the conversation gets deeper.  We here should talk about more than
drugs, music, clubs, & sex, and leave the debating to the polititions.  
 
well I'll have more to say on further postings, until then, I gotta get
some sleep.............. ...........something I need in the U.K or here in
California, it seems that wher-ever you go, some things remain the same. 
                                                                           
        MOONPUP.....wish you were here...

Well, just remember that Burning Man is not a rave: that seems to be
a pretty big misconception floating around, and a lot of people are 
applying rave ideals (i.e., no corporatism, keep it underground) to the
Burning Man festival.  Indeed, there will be a rave camp, where I would
bet that logo-splashed water bottles might not be so welcome, but water
giveaway is certainly a nice thought.
	Burning Man, according to a quote from its original
founder, has quite a lot to do with two simple things: temporary
community, and all the issues that that concept raises, and dada-ism,
which is the artistic movement centered around all things absurd.  

  Interestingly, dada-ism is a pretty big tent, since nearly anything can 
be justified as absurd.  (i.e., "what do you mean you don't want our water 
bottles here?  they're just being distributed as an artistic statement!")
So in a way, it's hard to say that anything doesn't belong at burning man,
given the fact that the festival is held beneath a dada-ist umbrella.
It's supposed to be silly and nonsensical; and subverting commercialism
is almost always a humorous thing.  For example, the rock band U2's last
tour dealt with nonsensical themes, like subverting corporatism and 
exploring its ironies.  I'll bet that there will be a lot of that at
Burning Man this year, given the fact that they're expecting 10,000
people supposedly.  Anyways, my point is to just remember that BMan will
be weird and wonderful, and I hope that it stays inclusionary.
Sorry to ramble like that, by the way! 

see y'all in Black Rock City,
Timothy

party goers are broke, and unlike America where I feel alot of woman looks
at you as a comodity (security, job, house, car  etc...) everyone just
faces the fact there all broke and gets on with it.......if you meet
someone, you fall in love, you live together, and you deal with the issues
of life together.  Money is not as big an issue, as it seems to be here.
It's about a persons vibe, and when an entire nation (generally speaking)
has that attitude, it helps to create a scene that will thrive for many
years to come. 
 
Some other basic differences are the volume of drugs and alchahol that are
consumed. here, I find that at a night club you will have about a 50-75% of
people drinking. where as in the U.K 98% are drinkers. In an underground
environment here, you will find very few alchahol drinkers, as they tend to
do drugs, (most commonly an E instead of drinking.), where as at an
underground in the U.K, people are poppin E's like there goin out of style,
in addition to drinking up a storm........it's completely mental. 
 
One of the elements I have to say we have the upper hand on, is the
consumption of cigarettes. In the U.K it's 99%, but here only about 40%. I
attribute that to healthier attitudes here, as well as the attitude that in
the U.K, the future is bleak, so have another drink, smoke a fag
(cigarette), pop another "pill" and roll another spliff. 
 
One of the most glaring differences, is the "Festival" attitude. While we
have Burning Man and an occaisional other Festy, Britain is innundated with
massive Festivals all summer long.......I went to a festival in Normandy,
France, and about 5,000 people showed up, and it was considered a failure,
where-as here a festival of 5,000 would be a good turnout. 
It is not un-common to get 35,000 people at a festy in the U.K, I have
heard estimates that next years Glastonberry festival will draw upwards of
300,000 people (no thats not a typo). 
 
All in all, I have been to good parties here and good parties there, I have
attended crap parties here, and crap parties there........I've heard good
and bad music both here and there, it's all really rather personal (based
on your own musical tastes). I'm not even sure I can explain why I feel the
U.K has it goin on, I think it's just a matter of fact, that the U.K. party
scene has had longer to devope and mature, and the average age of the club
goer in the U.K reaches into the late 20's and mid 30's (and the rest),
whereas here I run into lots of people in their teens and early 20's. 
Certainly being 37, I feel that I have more in common with an older crowd,
as the conversation gets deeper.  We here should talk about more than
drugs, music, clubs, & sex, and leave the debating to the polititions.  
 
well I'll have more to say on further postings, until then, I gotta get
some sleep.............. ...........something I need in the U.K or here in
California, it seems that wher-ever you go, some things remain the same. 
                                                                           
        MOONPUP.....wish you were here...

It's Fall again!!  Baby-faced freshman flooding the streets, old friends 
back from tours of exotic places (grr...), and ridiculous lines at 
Ned's.  It's that time again -- time for a big ole raging co-op party!!

I got conscripted to be Social Manager at Castro Co-op again, and am 
proud to announce our first partee of the year:

This Friday Night
9PM - 1AM
DJ spinning clubhouse, funk, old skool
$4 (but kegs will be flowing)
at Castro - 2311 Warring (street behind I-House), cross street Channing


It's the first Friday night of the year and there are no Greek parties (:P) 
and no other co-op parties, which means that the Cal rager of the week-end 
will be at Castro!!  Just imagine it, dancing smushed up with several 
hundred of your closest friends, all slobbery drunk, all singing, "She's 
a Brick Howwwse!"  Ah, college parties...

Hope you can make it!  But I'll be at Burning Man :)

Rave kismet, or random coincidence?

Among the new people moving into my co-op at Berkeley is one of our very 
own SFRavers!!  Jack Chang and I are now - coming as a complete surprise 
to us - housemates!

So far all I know of him is that he's tall, quiet, and makes a mean 
falafel.  Oh yeah, and I suspect he's a raver =).

Subject: grass is always greener.....(unlike the british skunk)
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

In light of the tone of the previous E-mail I sent, I will now communicate
on a more positive note..........London was the shit........awsome vibe,
many sound sytems, many different directions of music to choose from, and
many many cool people.... 
 
I have to say in 4 months I heard no-one (not one single person) dis anyone
elses party, or analyze (or is that anal-ize) what the scene should, could,
or would be......if only etc........nor discuss incessently the pro's and
con's of drugs vs. no drugs, musical styles vs. musical styles, or whatever
other dribble I see written from time to time (all too ofton) here on SFR.
(sorry, I guess thats a flame....huh) 
 
It was a whole new experience, one I'm sure I will miss......I reckon I can
only speak for my-self, when I say we have a lot to learn in the Bay Area
about co-operation harmony, and  imagination. 
 
It seems that we (including me at times).......love to TALK & BITCH about
whats wrong, and what we ought to do to change the direction etc..... I
only hope that some of you could see what harmony there is amongst the many
different rigs (sound systems) and how well the community works together to
overcome the current legal status (new laws pertaining to raves and
clubbers in general).......all I can say is.....I was inspired by the
attitude of the average party go'er (no not party goa).  
 
I saw and heard of the most insane concepts, very inventive and at the same
time sticking it to the police and government........for instance..... 
 
there was a huge party north of London, and every-one had to go in cars up
the motorway (freeway) to get there. Now the police got word of the party,
and set up a road block to stop the people from attending, and it created a
traffic jam that went for miles...... 
 
......so while they were stuck on the freeway, they dug up a portion of the
road and planted a couple of trees in the middle of the
highway.........awsome stuff...... 
 
they also have major street parties called "reclaim the streets" where they
meet in force and create many clever diversionary tacticts, and before you
know it they have overtaken a neighborhood and have a massive party before
the police know what hit em.............. and by then it's to late for the
bill (thats english for fuzz) to react or stop it.........If they tried,
they know the people will probably riot.........or so they think!!! 
 
It's these kinds of idea's that are inspirational to me, and I find the
British scene to be more mature, more inventive, more creative, and more
established.........we could learn from our distant older cousins.........(
I swear that is not a dis of our Bay Area....... just an insight of
Britain's scene) 
 
It's now no suprise to me that the theory that you have to be a british DJ
to be succesful, means something more than just a theory........they
brought with them a vibe we lacked here in 1990, and without their
influence, DJ's like me would'nt have been inspired and been as successful
as I have. (and it has grown to include many other U.S  DJ's in the mix
now)...........Those British DJ's who have had success here, did so because
of  an understanding of a vibe and attitude that was learned in the U.K in
the late 80's and early 90"s and they brought it here, it is because they
came from an environment where creativity, the musical environment, a
childlike imagination, and the state of the nation's economy gave rise to a
nation of house groovers and shakers. 
 
An additional factor that helps the British scene thrive, is that most
party goers are broke, and unlike America where I feel alot of woman looks
at you as a comodity (security, job, house, car  etc...) everyone just
faces the fact there all broke and gets on with it.......if you meet
someone, you fall in love, you live together, and you deal with the issues
of life together.  Money is not as big an issue, as it seems to be here.
It's about a persons vibe, and when an entire nation (generally speaking)
has that attitude, it helps to create a scene that will thrive for many
years to come. 
 
Some other basic differences are the volume of drugs and alchahol that are
consumed. here, I find that at a night club you will have about a 50-75% of
people drinking. where as in the U.K 98% are drinkers. In an underground
environment here, you will find very few alchahol drinkers, as they tend to
do drugs, (most commonly an E instead of drinking.), where as at an
underground in the U.K, people are poppin E's like there goin out of style,
in addition to drinking up a storm........it's completely mental. 
 
One of the elements I have to say we have the upper hand on, is the
consumption of cigarettes. In the U.K it's 99%, but here only about 40%. I
attribute that to healthier attitudes here, as well as the attitude that in
the U.K, the future is bleak, so have another drink, smoke a fag
(cigarette), pop another "pill" and roll another spliff. 
 
One of the most glaring differences, is the "Festival" attitude. While we
have Burning Man and an occaisional other Festy, Britain is innundated with
massive Festivals all summer long.......I went to a festival in Normandy,
France, and about 5,000 people showed up, and it was considered a failure,
where-as here a festival of 5,000 would be a good turnout. 
It is not un-common to get 35,000 people at a festy in the U.K, I have
heard estimates that next years Glastonberry festival will draw upwards of
300,000 people (no thats not a typo). 
 
All in all, I have been to good parties here and good parties there, I have
attended crap parties here, and crap parties there........I've heard good
and bad music both here and there, it's all really rather personal (based
on your own musical tastes). I'm not even sure I can explain why I feel the
U.K has it goin on, I think it's just a matter of fact, that the U.K. party
scene has had longer to devope and mature, and the average age of the club
goer in the U.K reaches into the late 20's and mid 30's (and the rest),
whereas here I run into lots of people in their teens and early 20's. 
Certainly being 37, I feel that I have more in common with an older crowd,
as the conversation gets deeper.  We here should talk about more than
drugs, music, clubs, & sex, and leave the debating to the polititions.  
 
well I'll have more to say on further postings, until then, I gotta get
some sleep.............. ...........something I need in the U.K or here in
California, it seems that wher-ever you go, some things remain the same. 
                                                                           
        MOONPUP.....wish you were here...

Me and my friends aren't going to BM  :(  but dancing on the beach sounds 
beautiful (as it always is).  Like whereabouts would this beach be, who'd 
spin, etc.  Saturday sounds perfect.  Is anyone else interested in this?

Rave 'til the grave,
Benjamin

Burning Man is almost here, and I'm almost there! I wanted to wish
everyone who's going a safe journey and a wonderful time. I'm sure
I'll see so many of there; I've already met so many of you, and I
can't wait to meet more of you this week :)

I'll be back on Tuesday to catch-up on all of the rave reviews and
flame wars ;) I'm planning on taking plenty of good quality photos; if
anyone is interested in scanning them for the web (or just taking a look,
to see what it was like), drop me a line.

love to all -

Steve

I think he spins a weekly somewhere in the city, but when and where, I 
dunno.  Anybody else know?  (We're talking about on Friday, Saturday, or 
Sunday.)

I'm not sure...   About $7 - $10,  some place in that range...   do you
know where I can get them duplicated?    I want to make about 100 copies.

How much would that cost per copy...   including price of the tapes.

You're on my list...

First,  I have to design a killer graphic tape insert cover,  and
I'll be having Craig design it...  He does really good spacey
art.

So,  if anyone knows where I can go to have copies made,  please let
me know...   I don't know how much money I'll have for the tapes and
duplication,   but if anyone out there knows about this,   please let me
know.

I didn't realize that so many people are going to want this tape....


After all,  it's Crunchman's FIRST DJ tape....   YAY!!!

I got really phucked up last night and spun the set...  A few
places where I got a little sloppy,  but what the heck....

I think Niels hit the nail on the head with his remarks about drugs  ie:  E.
Drugs are NOT glamorous and they are very dangerous and have caused a great
deal of harm.  His knowledge of E seems right on and I hope those of you out
there who mindlessly pop pills into your mouths that some stranger sold you
at a rave will listen to a few words of wisdom from those who are obviously
concerned about not only your well-being, but all of ours.

yes. it is the _abuse_ of drugs that is problematic.
i would argue with anyone who said that "drugs are dangerous, period" - as
someone who might not be alive today if it hadn't been for a certain
perscription drug. and yes, it is a drug, even though it comes over the
counter - legality of a substance has no relation to it's safety. there are
many legal drugs that are dangerous, there are many illegal drugs that are
not, and the reverse.

Hello,

Well, I respect this latest posting a lot more than the "the sky is
falling because of the Republicans" posts from a year or so ago.

However, if one were to vote for a small party simply because of their
stand on the issues, it seems pretty clear that the Libertarian Party
most closely represents the viewpoints and interests of ravers.

Whereas consumerism and social responsibility are laudable goals, the
methods of the Naderites have always been LAWS.

LAW means:

1 - Someone decides what is right and what is wrong.
2 - The police put you in jail if that "someone" doesn't like what you
are doing.

This seems to me to describe the history of raves pretty well.

No, I am certainly not proposing an*rchy, however, I do feel that, to
quote Thomas Jefferson "That government governs best that governs
least".

The Libertarian Party believes this, in fact, their platform includes
legalising every action that doesn't have a victim.

Beyond that, their principle is to only allow the least government
necessary to provide an orderly society, which then provides the most
freedom.

PS   To me, the only politician who has any personal integrity is
Jerry Brown (unfortunately, I don't always agree with him).

PPS  If one views Werner Herzog's documentary of the Iraqi occupation
of Kuwait, called "Lessons of Darkness", or the British documentary
about the Iraqi military occupation of the Marsh People in southern
Iraqi, both of which were environmental disasters; one gets the
impression that the only problem with arming Iran against Iraq was
that they didn't arm Iran enough.


Be seeing you,

Subject: Burning Man

I have held my toungue on Burning Man.  I did post a story, which I had
hoped would relevate an epiphany with some.  Clearly, it did not.  While
many unsuspecting individuals are clamoring to go to their first BM, excited
by the aspect of a large rave, I feel they know or understand little about
what Burning Man is really all about.  It is not a rave, but rather a
celebration of death.  It is purely negative.  It disgusts me.  Do those who
are so excited about going not realize what BM is REALLY about??!!??  

I have read many of outraged posts about partys sporting insulting names
like BlitzKrieg.  But I wonder, why does no one seem insulted by the THEME
of Burning Man?  I, for one, am insulted.  Sicked, actually, that our
society celebrates the supposed death of Love/Life/Spirit and galvanizes
together only to rally support for forces which seek only to destroy Life.
BM is not about renewal.  It is not about Love.  Burning Man is about fear,
confusion and death.  It is about being lulled to sleep and living in hate
and pain and isolation.  It is about NOT learning from mistakes made in the
past, nor is it about trying to reconcile any opportunity for rebirth.

This, my family, is my opinion.  I'm not scared to tell you all how I feel.
Burning Man is a blatant astrocity, it is something for which I will offer
no hope.  Those who attend are blinding themselves.  This is their choice.
Thank you for allowing me to express myself here, even though some of you
might not understand from where it is I come from.  
  

Love in LIFE!

Troy J.

Brendan hit the nail squarely on the head.  Abuse anything, and it is 
dangerous.  Moderation is maturity.  Pavlovian reactions like 
automatically saying, "Ooh, drugs, bad... Baaaahhhd" is bleating like a 
sheep in the herd, well versed on the latest media propaganda.  "Just say 
no."

Hi Wowser,

together. You dont back a damm CLUE! If you are not attenting please dont
bother us that are. And do not tell me you are telling me because you care
for me and love me. Because I dont give a rats ass about you. So please
keep those "the world is comming to an end" opinions to your self. To
think I actually didnt pass jugdement on you that last time... bah cant
trust anyone anymore...

I really haven't changed that much. I think the difference is that the
sky has fallen, and people are beginning to give the republican
congress the respect it deserves, i.e. the same as you'd give to a used
car salesman. I do blame republicans for a lot of evils, but democrats
are just as guilty. THe two party system is not democratic, does not
represent the will of the people.

I don't think so. At least personally, I see the libertarians and
republicans as greed-based ideologies.

I disagree with the libertarian party, as I do feel we need laws to 
limit people's inherent greediness and power-seeking tendencies. I
might prefer to see people organize in smaller autonomous groups that
could decide on what laws they want to impose, with free movement
between groups, etc. At the same time, if a group decides they want to
pollute another group's river, or enslave certain members of their
society, or prevent the free flow of people/goods/information across
group borders, then clearly a larger structure needs to impose itself
to ensure the good of the whole.

This doesn't mean that we need to maintain the current national versus
state governments, but since it's what we got, it's best to go with
that. (revolutions tend to "throw the baby out with the bathwater"
and typically result in more suffering than the status quo).

The best way to succeed, IMHO, is to have laws which don't take morals
or religion into account, as these are variable and can't be dictated.
What doesn't vary is people's relation with each other,  and our place
on this earth. To this end, I think we need laws that always ensure we
put nature above man, people above profit. Libertarians believe that
people have a inaliable right to profit, while ignoring the zero sum
nature of profit (profit only comes at someone's expense). I believe
that greed/profit is one of the most evil things on earth and needs to
be opposed with extreme force. People do not have a right to make
money, businesses do not have an inalienable right to exist or do
business. The ability to make money is a privilege, and not a right.
This privilege should be taken away from you if your profit motives
comes at the expense of workers, customers, people, nature, etc.
Basically, we value money in this country far too much -- it's the only
thing that actually matters and this is why our society is falling
apart. We need to change this sick attitude if we want to survive and
pass on a  healthy and happy world onto our children.

I am also opposed to "progress" as an end in itself. This seems to be 
something that libertartians are obsessed with unfettering progress. I
think we are progressing far too fast, far too fast for us to
understand what our progress is doing to us, too fast to introspect on
whether we need all the blessings of consumer society. A biological
organism that suffers from extreme and unchecked progress is called
cancerous. We are building a cancerous, self-destroying, self-consuming
society by focussing on progress, profit, and change as an end in
itself. THey should be a means to and end, and that end is global
survival of all people, all plants, all animals in harmony.

That's what I believe. Your mileage may vary.

I agree with you on this. THat's why I like his show on NPR as well.
He's a pretty "green" libertarian. Some would just say he's a liberal.

>Iraqi, both of which were environmental disasters; one gets the
>impression that the only problem with arming Iran against Iraq was
>that they didn't arm Iran enough.

There's a much deeper history here. You see, the USA originally
supported the despotic government in Iran, namely the Shah of Iran, who
we've been arming and helping stay in power since the 50's via a police
state that we're 100% responsible for setting up. The  muslim
fundamentalist overthrow of the Shah happened as a popular reaction to
the USA's support of a very ruthless, unpopular government in Iran. So
then we (or rather, the CIA) started giving Saddam Hussein lots of
armaments and financial support so that he could build up his own
dictatorial police state in the hopes that he would lead the fight
against our new enemies, the popular Iranian/Muslim fundamentalist
government. But then Saddam Hussein got a little too powerful and
started thinking on his own, using the army/navy/air-force we helped
set up, train, fund, etc to intervene in the region. The invasion of
Kuwait was a simple pretext by which we could reign in "our man" who
had become a force unto himself... thus our "blitzkrieg" against
Iraq. I can't blame Saddam, because we made him who he is. 
It's really the same exact story that played out in Panama with Noriega.
We made Noriega who he is, and then we shut him down when he
stopped following our orders. 

The moral of this story is that the USA should not intervene in the
affairs of other governments. Most every country in the world hates the
USA for the henous shit we've been perpetrating after world war II. If
you travel outside the US, you'll begin to get an idea of how horrible
we actually are -- no better, in many ways, than the Nazi's.

Man are you stupid. Are you so arrogant to believe that you are wise 
enough to know what is going on at an event as large and complex as 
this?!?!?  Are you actually discounting the varieties in human experience?

Your coming from a brainwashed, fear based, dogmatic, archaic form of 
crowd control known as the Christian Church (NOT to be confused with real 
Christians).

And the celebration of Death, an intregal aspect of life.

While the above comments are my own opinion, I readily agree that I may 
be wrong. Which is more than I can say for most folks who spout nonsense 
about things they haven't experienced.

I congratulate those going to burning man and wish that I could join you!

Peace,

Ran

you must be fucking joking........ 
 
first of all, it is obvious you have never been to a burning man
celebration. 
 
second of all, where did you get so bitter? 
 
third of all are you a catholic or a born again christian? 
 
4th of all, while I agree it is NOT a RAVE, last years BM was one of the
most exciting and enjoyable experiences of my life. 
 
further more, many a rave could learn a lot from the harmony, creativity,
spirituality, and overall organization, of the BM 
 
and last but not least get the fuck off your pedistal and enjoy life while
you are still alive and healthy, your post is one of the most negative I
have ever had the misfortune to read. I find your opinions of drugs and the
BM to be both offensive and narrow. 
 
I reckon you have been watching too much television.........get out and
live life, and allow us the freedom to enjoy what it is we do to enjoy
life, after all 10,000 people can't be wrong........and besides when did
you ever go and witness the joy of BM. 
 
It's obvious from your previous post about the harms of drugs that you know
very little about life and it's mysteries..........or about our family that
you pretend to say you are a part of............this family that you
condemn is even more special to me than my real family, because I CHOOSE to
make them family, not because I was born into it....trust me you are no
family member.......you have to share and experience and relate to this
family, something I'm afraid you'll never understand. 
 
GET A LIFE and leave us in peace to make our own individual desicions.

All right, kids, to put this whole death-and-destruction-in-the-Southland
thread to rest, here's a genuine on-the-ground review sent to me by some
friends down there. Remember, it was busted on Saturday, and this is the
makeup party thrown last night. Guess their violence-baiting karma caught
up with them. I still don't think a San Francisco-focused list was the
appropriate place for people to vent their spleen, but there you go...

Illicit substances(which is what I believe you are referring to) are 
tools. Use these tools without thought, consideration, and respect, and 
they can harm you. Use them with a little intelligence, and they can open 
the world.

Making blanket statements about a given subject is easy to do, and 
likewise seldom correct.

Do you? Apparently not given your obvious lack of understanding. You make 
sweeping generalizations. Death is only negative to the narrow-minded 
religions that do not appreciate the *FULL* cycle of life, which includes 
the concept of death. Because *you* fear it, does not make it inherently 
"bad."

You must have a lot of past experience with BM to make such a 
statement... oops... guess not.

Good. And I am not scared to tell you what an assinine, and ill-informed

I think some of us understand all too well where you are coming from, 
thus the harsh responses you are receiving.

Life is a cycle...learn the *complete* cycle....respect it...cherish it......

I will think that if you do just a bit of research, that you will find 
similar opinions regarding commercialism among the earlier attendees.

actually, U2's record label sued negativland. from what i read in an
interview with the edge, he thought it was a pretty cool thing negativland
was doing. and i believe the record label has reversed it's decision, and is
allowing negativland to distribute the single. the only problem is now with
casey casem (sp?) who threatens to sue their ass off should they market it.
(incidently, it's a fairly long clip with casey swearing, saying about U2:
"these guys are english and who gives a shit" - or something similar - , etc..)

incidently the single "the letter U and the number 2" is available online, at 
http://sunsite.unc.edu/id/negativland/samples.htm

ok. lets all be nice about this.
constructive, intelligent criticism = good
flames, flames, flames = bad

and try and remember that there are people on the list who are christian,
and who subscribe to quite moderate view; so let's try not to offend them.
but why would you want to offend your friends? or anyone for that matter...

so let's have an intellectual battle, if one must take place. but don't let
it descend into a schoolyard brawl.

thanks.

Just an aside on this one;

 I was at a lecture by Greg Baldwin who produced a film with quite a bit 
devoted to Negativeland and a smaller part dealing with commercialism, 
artistic copyright and tha U2 thing. Basically it seemed that it was the 
record company and their lawyers that wanted to sue... U2 just seemed to 
not think much on it at all... at least that was my take on Mr. Baldwin's 
film piece.



Peace,

Just goes to show I should read all my mail before posting (sigh).

That Greg Baldwin film shows Casey Casem swearing like a truck driver (as 
the movie critics say) thru video/audio sampling and manipulation. When 
Negativland played in the city a few months back I believe the video 
footage shown was created by Greg Baldwin, with some clips from his 
documentry (?) on NegativeLand theat I mentioned in my last post. I 
highly recommend the film/video and can get the title of it if someone 
would like.

Peace,

Ran

Anyone interested can email phin@west.darkside.com for Phineas Narco's
online tape catalog.  He has tapes of the U2 recordings (the original CD,
with the classic "Special Edit" radio mix plus a half dozen other
variations), a lot of mostly unpublished Negativland/Over the Edge stuff,
other improv radio stuff, and lots more in similar vein.  If you feel like
sending away for U2, I highly recommend Over the Edge "The Experience" as
well.  It's a 3-hour live-mixed audiocollage based around a Jimi Hendrix
documentary produced a few years ago.

hi all!

have a great time at BM!!!

i'm going to a job interveiw at stanford friday.  please wish me luck!
it's a hella cool job, working for a hella cool scientist.  someone i've
admired for years.  i feel so lucky to have a chance to spend a day in his
lab.

alas, i cannot go to BM.  i have to admit, i was a bit put off when
someone told me that the theme of BM was hell.  but i have since learned
that this isn't quite true.

the origins of BM.. celebration of the end of a bad love affair...seems a
bit negative, i suppose.  but i think that all ends are liberating,
because they mean that you can now make a fresh start.  

i read the tarot cards, and whenver the card of death comes up, i tell
people that it means the END of something and that it signals the
BEGINNING of something else.  so burning down a wooden man is a positive
thing, in my mind.  and remember...the man will be rebuilt to be burned
down again next year!  (i hope)  so even the one who is utterly destroyed
is renewed.  

it's like love.  you end a love affair, but you try again with someone
new, usually.  life is about trying, failing sometimes, and then trying
again.

so everyone have a fabulous time!!!!

love,

Ann

Wayne, that's a low blow. I don't think I agree with Wowser's reasons
for agreeing with me in a different post, even though he did agree with
me. Actually, I might partially agree with him on moral grounds if it
weren't for an inherent christian slant that seems to pervade his
posts. Christianity really gets my goat... errr... I mean it perks
my horns.... errrr... I mean it makes me see red..... ummm... I mean
it makes smoke come out of my ears... Hmmm...

Besides, I wouldn't be caught dead saying "love in life."

W/r/t wowser's post -- why is it when some great christian
pre-renaissance artists depicts a gory portrayal of the sufferings of
hell, it's "ok", but when you have a theme like "a year in hell" it's
not? Perhaps you have to go to hell to understand heaven?? Or at least
choose which side you're on? Shouldn't people have freedom of choice in
this matter? Besides, if there's less people in heaven, then you can
drink more champagne, eat more caviar, and have more angels all to
yourself bending over and showing you their cute little cherub cheeks.

Also, there's lots of celebrations worldwide that are 100% death
related, e.g. Mexican "Day of the Dead" celebrations which have been
folded rather neatly into Christianity, even though they speak back to
Aztec/Indian roots. Do you also have a problem with such celebrations?

[ to sfraves list ]

 I'm another one not going to BM - going to spend the next few days working
on some long-delayed chores , including building some subwoofer speakers
for my home. Saturday is scheduled to be a "heavy lifting" day, so I may
not be in the mood for anything physical that night. 

 However, I am scheduling Sunday's Sunset - my wife Mary and I plan to
attend the mini-Burning Man , and we even have something of our own to
burn!

 See you folks around ...

  Well I'm not really condoning the commercialism here... I was just sort
  of trying to check out what happens when you look at commercialism 
  under the light of dada-ism.  Personally, I'd rather not look at 
  corporate logos over Labor Day weekend, but my point is that if one is
  invoked *cleverly*, then it would be difficult for me to justify 
  scoffing at it, given the fact that dada-ism (and the BM founder is
  clearly a dada-ist) gave such a big push to this event.

	No no no--the 'artistic statement' bit has to be taken literally 
  and not sarcastically here: sure, if the 'artistic statement' line of
  defense is merely an *excuse* for some company to make its presence
  felt, then that's lame.  But if it is done intelligently and for
  genuinely artistic or declaratory purpose, well, then who am I to
  comment?  But you're right--Satan forbid a big Coors billboard! :)
  (the official BM theme this year is Dante's _Inferno_)

    Ooooo....nice. I forgot about that.  Oops!  (although that oversight 
  doesn't really invalidate the example.)  Staying with pop music, though,
  another example would be Rolling Stone magazine's decision to run a
  cover photo of Nirvana, with the singer wearing a "Corporate Magazines
  Still Suck" T-Shirt.  [Kurt Cobain had been told not to wear any clothes
  with words on them to the photo shoot, so he showed up wearing the
  T-shirt. The photographer was panicked, fearing that that his editors 
  would be furious with him for not being able to get a good cover shot,
  but the editors got such a kick out of it they cropped the picture to
  emphasize the message, and ran it on their cover.]
  Anyway, I basically meant to say that commercialism at Burning Man is
  far more complicated an issue than commercialism at a massive rave,
  given the weird ideas behind the Burning Man concept.

  pedantically yours,

  Timothy

Ok,

It's Wensday. 
We have a bunch ole people in intrest of tossing a beach party.
I believe these people would be willing to help set up/tear down the
soundsystem, move the generator ect.al.
I know of a few locations...
(I hope) we have some DJ's.  
(Well, I'll spinn for 1-2hrs.)

I guess all we now need is some organization, a sound system, some big cars,
and hopefully some nice weather...

Or...

It's PUMP (housey-type music)

So what's everyone elses opnion???

        Yep, this is from the MAPS (Multidisciplinary Association for
Psychedelic Studies newsletter):

        "The 5 mg/kg dose of MDMA injected in the primates is about 3 times
larger than the typical human dose of 1.7 mg/kg. Dr. Ricaurte has
previously shown that subcutaneous injection of MDMA is roughly twice as
toxic as oral administration (this varies somewhat depending on brain
region), and
that repeated dosing is more toxic than single administration.(6)"

        So, he didn't find severe modifications of the 5-HT (Serotonin)
uptake axons with "recreational" doses of MDMA to the monkeys, so he used
larger doses, subcutaneously (shootin' em up).

        "In order to cause substantial serotonin reductions in multiple
primate brain regions, it was necessary to administer subcutaneous
injections of 5 mg/kg twice daily, four days in a row, for a total of eight
injections. The relevanceof the data from this study to the human
therapeutic or recreational use of MDMA is not clear."

        That's about 45 times the "recreational" human dosage.  (5mg/kg is
3x as neurotoxic x 2 for injecting it x 8 injections) So, i dunno, i mean,
i don't know of anyone who's shooting up 5mg/kg doses of E twice daily for
four days in a row.  Maybe i'm just swinging with the wrong crowd ;)  I
think as well that the linkage between lower primate neurological reactions
and human reactions hasn't been fully worked out, we are somewhat more
complex than monkeys neurologically (i won't get philosophical here ;) so
*as i see it* the findings point to only a few things:
        *In significant, regular dosages* MDMA causes "abnormal" regrowth
of certain neurological pathways (in some areas there is heightened
regrowth, in others there's lesser regrowth). To me, "abnormal" regrowth
doesn't constitute "brain damage."  The link between the regrowth and
impaired or dysfunctional neurological functioning hasn't been established
100%.  In fact (this is totally just me talking from..uhhh...personal
experience) i may venture to say that MDMA's neurological re-patterning may
be beneficial in some ways.  Many researchers thought that serotogenic
depletion would cause anxiety attacks, hostility, depression and impaired
memory function in users, yet many users find just the opposite.
        Here's the URLs for some more info, the second one is the most recent:

        http://www.maps.org/news-letters/v5n3/nih.html

        http://www.maps.org/news-letters/v6n1/06108neu.html

        Here's one other quote from the article:

        "In terms of human use, Dr. Ricaurte was cited as stating that
"people could probably take normal amounts of MDMA three or four times a
year without noticing any neuropsychiatric problems but people who took
seven or eight doses a night could be inviting problems."

        I think that's a fair assesment. ;)

        Well said! I think if there's one thing that i've learned about
MDMA (from friends of friends ;) is that when i go and look for something
to fulfill a certain desire (like peace, or feeling love, or whatever) i
realize that it's all within me in the first place.  In that way, i think
that MDMA isn't habit forming, because every time you do it you come closer
and closer to permanently releasing the things that you're trying to 'find'
with the drug, but from within. It's like you have your own permanent
supply of love :) (free, never cut with anything, and you don't hesitate to
share it) ;)
        Also, i think that MDMA as a therapeutic tool is something that
should be examined as well.  Addictions/Behaviours can be self-modified
through "self-metaprogramming" or through a competant therapist (be careful
who you leave your sensorium with though ;).  A friend of a friend told me
that MDMA acts sort of like a backup hard drive that you can use to
rearrange your main root directory and rebuild your desktop ;) (I think
that was the geekiest metaphor i've ever heard) ;)
        Don't take all this stuff i've said about E as gospel truth, i'm no
chem student nor neurologist, but i think that there are certain obvious
facts within the research itself that shows that "brain damage" is unlikely
if one is MODERATE.
        As well, MAPS is a solid, reliable and sound source of a lot of
information.  They have a bit more credibility than something like, say,
High Times.
        But, as with everything: balance and moderation = safety!

        paix, amour et l'ecstasy ;)

I wouldn't be so sure they could learn alot.  I would say there are some

I always love the discourse of late.  Plenty of "fuck you's" and "fuck
off's".  Peace, love, unity and respect...truly the unattainable.  Anyway I
am glad that we give each other so much quarter to express ourselves....not.

ahh yes, the accusatory.  "You never get your head out of TV, so sit back
son, I'll learn ya the facts of life...". I always hated these kinds of
speeches.  Gets right off the subject, and denigrating in tone.  Nope,
don't argue to cinvince, just deflect using insults and inflammatory
language. A discussion with real value (sarcasm, explicit).

good morning merry flamethrowers...

insulting and outcasting someone are not good ways to deal with differences...
enough people responded to Troy J. in a way that essentially said "you
stupid bastard, you're not one of us...", and i find that scary.

now i couldn't disagree more strongly with Troy's opinions. but i
understand that he is a human being, entitled to his opinions, and
deserving of my respect...

and what about Unity? making someone feel excluded does not foster love.
and it won't help change someone's opinion.

i may be totally crazy, but my feelings are that PLUR should be something
more than a buzzword, more even than a group of warm feelings that we feel
at parties. PLUR should be a personal and political philosophy (at least it
is for me)... and i'm not seeing that in this discussion.

maybe we should form an sfraves-alter-ego list for getting all our
aggressions out... :)

plurally,
brian

ps      for those of you getting tired of my intervening in your

this thread got me pretty upset... i promise in the future i won't try to

Once again, the problem with this comes when you try to implement a
system to decide WHEN the profit motive comes at the expense of
others.

You either have:

- People who subjectively decide WHEN to intervene, OR
- A system that decides on the basis of criteria - however, you still
need people who subjectively decide in the first place on WHICH
criteria to use !  :-)

ALL socialist systems require people to decide when a wrong has been
committed against "Nature" or "The People".

BUT, you yourself just stated:

"The best way to succeed, IMHO, is to have laws which don't take
morals or religion into account, as these are variable and can't be
dictated."

and this EXACTLY applies to a system which protects "Nature" or "The
People".

There are millions out there who say that morals and religion are not
variable, but that it is entirely variable where one draws the line
between making a living versus greedily destroying nature and
exploiting people.  Sure the extremes are easy to see, but where does
greed start - $40k per year?  $80k ?  $120k ? $300k ? 

All systems of socialism require someone to decide all these things.

AND what happens time and time again is that the Hitlers and the
Stalins gravitate towards those positions in the government that
decide such things.

This is why communism, an otherwise well meaning philosophy, never
works - because the worst people always spend all their energies
getting into positions of decision and power.

SO, the most freedom is obtained in a system where YOU make all the
decisions.

That system is called the Free Market.   If people want Jeno DJ tapes,
then THEY choose by buying them, and more DJ tapes are made.

In a socialist system, someone else has the power to decide that Jeno
DJ tapes are not healthy for people and nature and to ban them.

In a socialist system, decisions are made by bureaucrats and
lawmakers.

In a free market system, all decisions are made by the People, not by
someone else.   You vote by what you put your money into.

For example, laws are not necessary to protect the environment.  I am
a member of the Rainforest Action Network.   They use my money to
embarass corporations that clear the Rainforest, and have been
successful in convincing them to stop.   If enough people used their
own choice to donate these organizations, these problems could be
overcome without resorting to any laws.

Ken                         <*>

Warning:  I went to an Iner Sircle (can't even spell) party back in 
April.  It was THE worst, most scary party of my entire life.  Actually, 
one of the most threatening experiences ever.  The crowd was very shady, 
and extremely un-vibey.  I'll send you my review, 
if you'd like.  But, I would strongly advise against this party, unless 
they've somehow changed their act.  Leftjab can back me up on this one.  
But, you decide.

And this being a non-communist country, we must have great, beautiful
and well-meaning people in positions of power!

The problem with many western democracies is that people are interpreting
the idea of democracy as meaning that the majority has the right to
tell everybody how to live their lives, instead of leaving everybody
doing their thing as long as they are not causing problems for everybody
else. In America, I'd say the average Joe makes very little decisions
of any importance.

Pfff, what do you think is happening right now in this free market here?
America is supposedly the ultimate free market and at the same time a
country that attempts to limit personal freedom quite a bit. A Jeno tape
is one thing, gay marriage or medical marihuana another...

Hahaha! So who are making the laws here then???

Unless the voting system has become so corrupted that you end up with
only 2 choices, both extremely similar and run by people who's
only interest is to sell themselves and the products of their sponsors
to you. Having a few more (big) political parties in this country
would be an excellent start IMHO.

This demonstrates just the ridiculous power of the media in this country,
which to me is probably one of the most frightening aspects of it.
It essentially means that who has the most money will get done what
they want, like the tobacco, prison building and arms lobbies for instance.
And these are probably not run by "the people".

Just my $0.02, no flame intended. I agree communism is going nowhere, but
also think capatalism to the extreme doesn't work. There are systems which
are in the middle (social-democratic) of all that, which can be found in
some places in Europe and which do quite well.

my car was struck and totalled by another individual who was driving with

(which the police officer said will probably occur) my insurance company

anyway, keep me in your thoughts as i lay here and recoup, and try to find

You're right, I might not understand where you're coming from,
but then again I might.  I think you've taken a view of this festival
that clearly differs, even directly clashes with my own... so I thought
I'd just mention what it means to me, and you can decide if we are really
on such opposing sides or not.

Death is a tricky issue, because yes it is the concrete manifestation of
life's worst fear, an end, but I think that one of the most important
points of life is realizing that fears and perspectives that hold us
back and keep us from being free with our life are illusions... that
the infinite spirit driving all things and ourselves is immortal and
invincible, and that these fears of death or of anything else must be
faced head on so that we can learn to move straight through them and
move our life to new directions and realizations.

I view Burning Man as a celebration of the breaking down of fear, that
confrontation with hell, where within we realize just how alive and free
we really are.  We live in a society and reality of many restrictions
and constraints, shaping our spirit into a tightly focused expression
of life that fears it's own demise, but as we go from moment to moment
we learn to lift constraint after constraint and we find that we are
always still here, and usually changed for the better.  

It is not by simply realizing that you're alive and then staying in that
same perspective forever that keeps you alive.  rather, it is by letting
go of what you currently view as your life and moving on to a new view,
which keeps the energy flowing... and that flowing energy is life itself.
stagnant or trapped energy is doomed to die.

Burning Man is solely about renewal, about rebirth.  It is entirely
about love.  It is only through facing your fear head on, and letting
go of the hate that created it that you learn to love.

Hell is a pretty solid manifestation of all the things we as living
beings fear, and by putting all our fears into the fire and letting them
burn we release the energy trapped within and let it grow into new
forms of life.  Burning Man is a festival where many different kinds
of people come together and let each other express themselves without
anyone trying to judge or condemn anyone for how they are choosing to live.
It is a festival where people try to respect every idea that someone
chooses as their own truth.  It is a festival that challenges you to
stop judging and start living... free and without fear.
It is a festival that challenges you to love life.

That's just my take on it all.

> Love in LIFE!

	O.k. Everyone take a deep breath, count slowly backwards from 10.
It'll all be o.k. 
	There's so much argument going on around here about BM and what it
means. I cut this from Ronald's post and am using it out of context but I
think it makes a good point:

	I don't think I'm being overly presumptuous by saying that we're
all more or less responsible individuals who have the ability to make up
our own minds, to define our own lives and gather our own meaning from the
world around us. Arguing over what BM "means" or what a rave is "about" is
like trying to convince someone of what they should get from a piece of
literature. Just because one feels that a rave is not in the "spirit of
raves" does not mean that everyone else will draw the same conclusion from
it. I've found that people infuse events with their own meaning. What this
implies is that even if you consider a rave to have a bad name or a bad
vibe, it does not follow that others will get the same impression. 
	Yes, I agree that a democracy is *not* (or should not) be about a
majority enforcing it's worldview and way of life on a minority. Nor
should a rave scene be about defining what raves should mean to other
people. Take a little personal responsibility and define your life for
yourself. Let others draw meaning as they will. All the flames in the
world won't change ignorance or stupidity.
	There's a difference between supplying knowledge and info (i.e.
posting the hopkins' research report and debating about it) and arguing
about whether people "should" or "ought" to do drugs or go to
lightning-storm parties. 
	There's a fine line between explanation and justification, between
providing information and prescribing courses of action, between accepting
what others do as their own responsibility and trying to change them. 
	I guess what course of action *I'm* trying to prescribe, is that
we don't prescribe courses of action. Be your own person. Make your own
decisions, but make them informed and wise (whatever that means). 


Love and bean-bags,
Stan

Stan

	did you ever consider that lsd and color tv arrived for our
consumption about the same time? here comes all this explorative color
pounding and what do we do? we outlaw one and fuck up the other...there
are some basic grounds for outlawing lsd, dmt, stp - it can take a man
permanently out of his mind - but so can picking beets, or turning bolts
for GM, or washing dishes or teaching English I at one of the local
universities. if we outlawed everything that drove men mad, the whole
social structure would drop out - marriage, the war, bus service,
slaughterhouses, beekeeping, surgery, anything you can name. anything can
drive men mad because society is built on false stilts.

well lets see it only took me 2 days back from London to put my foot in my
mouth....... again...... 
 
I guess I'm just too passionate about my drugs, music and burning man......

 
I just wanted to say to you all that when I say things that appear
offensive and narrow minded, it's not intended that way, I havn't been on a
computer for 4 months, and I forgot my manners......I would like to
apologize publicly to Wowser, and all the people who had to read MY
negative comments. 
 
It's funny how I learn my lessons in life......(over and over) 
 
I guess after a 4 month stint in London, it made me see how different
things can be. 
and I get insensed whan I see someone dis the things in life that give me
freedom of expression, and make my life worth living....I try not to talk
about things I know nothing about, (like politics/religion/etc.....) and I
only talk of what I know.......and I felt at the time Wowser seemed to be
talking of something he does't understand or relate too, and I couldn't see
the reason to dis something that so many of our community seem to take to
heart in........maybe he knows something more about it than I do....maybe
not...... 
 
I can see where I deserve to be flamed for my response to Wowser,
especially my comments about religion etc.....I was out of line....so be it

 
for those of you who see me as just an opinionated guy with a big
mouth....I guess I deserve that......for those of you that have gotten to
know me closely enuff know that I am not being percieved correctly, and
that I try to be genuine and kind, and I am not the kind of person who
would hurt others on purpose. 
 
sometimes I forget that my insensitivity at times like this, can insult and
hurt, and I can only be humbled by the experience. 
 
I will be taking some time off from this flaming nonsense, and just
observing the wars from a distance........I thank those of you who stand
behind me at times like this, and I appreciate the opinions of those that
flame me, believe me it's embarrasing to show my weaknesses in front of 400
plus people, especially when I consider myself to have been growing away
from this kind of public display, (slowly) over the past years or so..... 
 
I too have my dark side, and I allow it to be judged by all those who read
these posts.... 
 
I will now endevour to quietly head off into the burning man, another
lesson learned, and another perspective gained...... 
 
I hope to see some of you there and I hope whatever you do this weekend,
enjoy youself....

well it only took me 2 days back to put my foot in my mouth (again) 
 
I just spent an hour writing an apology to Wowser and everyone in general
for my flaming posts of Wowsers BM and Drug comments. 
 
I lost it due to a glitch in my computer, and it was really powerful
stuff.....I don't have the energy to rewrite it all, and besides you all
don't want to read my wordy explainations and apologies anyway..... 
 
so I'll just say that I was wrong to flame Wowser so rudely (and publicly),
and I humbly hope you all will not condemn me too badly for my latest faux
pas.... 
 
I was out of line with my religion comments, and I hope you understand that
it was purely my passion for BM, Drugs and Music, that got me so riled
about someone condemning something I have so much respect and passion for. 
 
I'll leave it simply at that and I hope you all enjoy your weekend.

Subject: MegaCyber Buzz Carnival
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

Dear You Guys,

Yesterday someone dropped a message poking fun of the "carnival" raves, and
I came really close to adding a note to that.  After all, it's *so* easy to
make fun of...all you have to do is say MegaCyber Neat Planet Buzz Fest,
Part 3, and suddenly it becomes very funny, who can deny it?
But then I remembered how I used to scrap with my girlfriend about things
like this.  She always used to be protective of the "underground", as if,
"how *dare* these people show up at *our* parties, even start throwing
parties?"

I remember one of the most fascinating things I discovered when I moved to
San Francisco was the sheer size of the parties.  "Jesus, they're throwing
parties in the *civic center*?"  I was astounded that something so cool had
spread to so many people.   Granted, I'd prefer to give foot massages than
go toe-ta-toe with gangstas, but hell, I've been to many of these
G-parties, and I've only been messed with once.  I think that there are
enjoyable aspects of the harder edged parties as well.  At the parties
I've been to like this, I've had a fine time soaking in the attitude, the
swagger, and even the stupid-ass circle dancing.

In an interview about a year ago, Barry Weaver said that people should
chill out on the spiritual thing and just consider that they're dancing and
having a good time. While I have no plans to "chill-out" on the spiritual
thing, I think there is something to be said about just cutting loose,
being a little hard, and showing off in the middle of the circle dancers.
It's all about having a good time, isn't it?  People have good times in
different ways.  Some people are scared to get all soft and huggy, for fear
it will be interpreted as a weakness.  But a gangster at a rave just might
be the first step toward something positive.

There's a whole lotta lovin to learn.  People like us our blessed with this
insight that we can empower and heal ourselves through dance.  But if we
start becoming elitist and hoity-toity about it, aren't we re-creating the
very establishment  we went underground to escape?   House music has a
*very* powerful effect on a human being, and so it's bound to attract a lot
of people, and not everyone is going to be coming from the same point of
view.

The second thing that struck me about SF was that you can actually *choose*
what kind of party to go to.  In many other cities, there is one party per
weekend, if you're lucky.  I don't think there's anything wrong with the
rave scene spreading...in fact it might even be necessary, if we're going
to achieve this critical mass that we've been talking about for so long.
If we're going to change the world folks, we need a big army.  (And we need
to train 'em well).  I guess the kid  who was making fun of the
MegaBuzzCyber Cool carnivals wasn't really objecting to their existence,
but questioning whether or not it'd be worth going to.  Anyway, if you love
house music, doesn't that mean you should love *everything* about house
music?  I dunno.  I lost my point and...


...here comes my boss.


Evolve.

Hey all,

I wondered if any of you out there had experience with sampling sound from
videotape soundtracks. Is it just a cable you plug into your VCR and your
stereo or sampler and off you go? What is the copyright law concerning say,
single sentences or words as spoken by movie charachters on video? I know
lots of records who sampled stuff from movies and I have a hard time
believing all the artists involved pay copyrights to the makers of those
movies...

Perhaps it may have something to do with transcending them.

My beautiful sisters & brothers,

        (Who's he talkin' about?)  Thanks in LARGE part to all y'all who
beamed me positivity, I feel much happier now :D  Another newfound source
of joy is my shiny, brand new Mac PowerPC9500/132, with 48 megs of RAM (is
that enough?), 2 GB of disk space, and an ATI Xclaim video card.  All I
need now are a monitor and a modem, and the big fun begins!
        OBRAVE: I'll be able to use the machine (affectionately named Led
Zeppelin) to beautify scanned photos of raves for people to put up on Web
pages, as there's a lot of interest there lately :)

Share my joy!!!

Eric

	Now wait...  thats like 6 doses every 12 hours for four days. How much 
sleep did the poor monkeys get?  Did they do a control with something "proven 
safe" like caffeine?  What are the neurological symptoms of sleep deprivation 
anyway?  I hear psychosis is among the psychological symptoms...

	Of course, if they did such a control and the caffeine-monkeys tore each 
other's throats out while the e-monkeys just got a bit down, I can see there 
being some problems with publication...

So let me guess John; you support Wowser's assesment of BM? Or are you 
just taking the time out to criticise the reactions to Wowser's post 
without also commenting on Wowser's post.

 I thinks that the reason why Wowser recieved such a hostile reaction 
from many people (myself included) was that he attacked something that 
many people here hold dear; the right to gather and party. Two elements 
in life thet you, unless I'm mistaken, also cherish. So whats up John? 
I'm certain you have more insights to share with us.

 PS I do not agree that Wowser should get off the list. I feel he is 
welcome to share his opinions with us; just as we are welcome (or should 
be) to share ours with him. I do appreciate John's comment's; I'm just 
curious why he is deconstructing the reactions to Wowser rather than 
Wowser's post itself.


Peace,


Ran

hello all-

this morning, i realized just how short life is (if you're confused, see my
earlier MATT'S IN THE HOSPITAL message).  i almost was killed this morning,
and i got to thinking, what's so important about my car, my computer, my
guitar, etc?  how am i gonna use them when i'm dead?  what's so important
about making a good paycheck?  how can i spend it after i've been committed
to an institution for going crazy from working too hard?  

i'm sitting on my couch, home from the hospital, still shaken up, but
getting better.  i just thought i would share my experiences with anyone out
there who is a workaholic, and tell them "SLOW DOWN!!!  SLOW DOWN, OR THE
WORLD WILL FIND SOME WAY TO SLOW YOU DOWN, AND YOU MAY NOT LIKE IT!"

so, with that said, i'm gonna take a hot shower.

p.s.  matt's happy go lucky, filled with love posts will return soon, so if
you don't like it, just filter me out entirely.

love to you all, and i hope your day goes well-

matt l

Maybe it was one old-timer's way of saying to another to chill out a bit,
in a non-obtrusive(IMO) way.  Maybe it was someone, chosing an example, to
ask everyone to chill a bit.  Maybe I was just taking time out of my very
busy life to add, what I saw as value and a certain perspective to the
entire dialog.

Deconstruction is difficult without an explosive.

There's plenty of inflammtory rhetoric is spewed here, with good and bad
intentions.  Choose your battles wisely and make them worthwhile.
Otherwise you'll be in the same tired war over and over again.

You're creating a black-and-white polarity here between "communist"
and "non-communist" countries.   If you read carefully, I said
"communism, a philosophy".

Every country's government is a spectrum between the free market and
socialism/communism.

The reason that we have power-hungry people in our government is
because the government itself is powerful.

If we take away a lot of the government's funding (ie taxes), then we
take away its power and then we take it away as an instrument for just
those power-hungry people that everyone here is against.

I can hear someone say " but that will just leave the corporations to
do whatever they want " and there are three answers to this:

(1) A lot of the power of the corporations comes from their leverage
in the government due to lobbyists, which then gets them legal
exceptions to normal free market forces, which vastly increases their
influence.

(2) One of the few legitimate activities of government is anti-trust
action, ie enforcing existing laws that prevent monopolies and other
corporate actions that go against free market forces.

(3) When anti-trust laws are enforced, individual corporations only
encompass small segments of the economy - unlike the government which
has power over every aspect of your life.

You seem to be misunderstanding what I am saying.  The effect of
democracy in the polling place is nothing compared to the decisions
made by average Joe in what he is going to do with his time and money.
Every time he chooses between watching a TV show or going to
"Harmony", between buying a six-pack of beer or the new Orbital CD, he
makes a decision.

In a socialist system, decisions are made for you by other people who
think that they have your best interests at heart.   Didn't you think
you were getting rid of that when you moved out at 18?

Exactly... except that America is not the ultimate free market.  Over
the last 30 years, the government has had more and more influence, and
your free market choices are less and less.   For example, Hong Kong
has more of a free market than we do.

As far as the other choices you mentioned above, the Libertarian Party
(which was the subject of the post you are replying to) is in favor of
allowing you to do all those things (in fact their platform dispenses
with the word "medical" above).

Exactly.   Our current government has become too socialist.

But if your tax money is returned to you, you can give it to people
like the Rainforest Action Network.   The amount of tax money
currently collected by the government is so vast, that if private
groups like RAN had access to it, they could do a MUCH better job of
protecting the environment than the apathetic government bureaucrats
could ever do.

Paying taxes is equivalent to flushing your money.   Whatever your
concern is, a private action group that is enthusiastic and motivated
can always do a better job of it than the government.

It takes a big person to admit wrongdoing.  Go ahead and take that foot 
out your mouth, it doesn't belong there anyway.  (Families are for

Hello everyone,

    Well, I have gotten soooo much positive responce to my post! So I 
guess that means that we should do it!! However, if all of you want to 
do this, we all need to work together to get it done!!! 

    First, we need a sound system... I don't know where we can get one 
now, since most of the underground systems are going to BM. But i will 
check it out. If needed, we could possibly all pitch in and rent a 
sound system from an actual sound company like JK or Santa Cruz Sound, 
etc. It would only cost a minimal amount, and might be the best idea. 
But if any of you know of anyone with a system, please speak up!

    Second, we need a crew... We can use the "HUNNY" (not harmony) 
voicemail, to organize a phonelist. If you want to help call 
(415)263-4885. Leave your name, and phone number, even a pager number 
if you have one! Also leave any spaces (locations) you might know of. 
As well as sound systems. Please do not post onto sfraves regarding any 
spaces or info about what space we will decide upon.

    Third, we need some dj's. Jondabomb has already offered to play, I 
could play (if it comes down to it :) , but we need some more. So if 
you're up for it, call the voice mail.

    Forth, get as many people as you can to come and help, cause this 
party will take a lot of energy!! 

    And last, let's have a fucking bad-ass time!!!!

Peace,

Greg :)

Yeah, but if you ENJOY that which makes you permanently out of your mind, 
well, then- we can have none of that in this modern society!  No sir!  Of 
course, one can still enjoy life doing much of what you listed (from 
doing drugs to digging ditches) without losing one's mind, if done in 
moderation and handled maturely.

Peace,
Benjamin

Why don`t we all add a SFRAVES in the subject-line??

Troy, yes Burning Man is about death.  But without death there is no
regeneration.  It takes the death of animals, vegetables, trees and many
other things to sustain your life.  Is your life what you would consider
sickening or "bad" because it asks for death every day?  When people throw
out aspects of themselves that are no longer healthy or useful and "burn"
them with the  effigy on Sunday night, they are making room for positive
change and rebirth.  I know I will "burning" and mid-wifing many things
that evening. I believe that is a very sad state that our culture cannot
embrace the dark as well as the light.  In the dark we learn about our
fears and the things we allow to limit ourselves.  I think "burning" and
destroying symbolically is alot more healthy and positive then having to
resort to Prozac don't you?

Ya that is true, but people who make records try and make up for that by
charging ~7-12$ for a single and DJ's who make tapes try and make up for
the fact that everyone will dub thier tape by charging 15 bucks for
it...dont get me wrong nothin wrong with it, it's just economic scence.

On the radio, there's a weekly program in the late  afternoon (4-5PM)
on National Public Radio syndicate hosted by Jerry Brown (88.5 FM, I
think) -- I forgot the name of the show, I think it's something like
"To the COntrary".=20

Not to be nit picking, but.... I believe the show Niels is referring to =
is called We The People, Its Jerry Brown's daily show on KPFA 94.1.

Hello happy ravers, and unhappy uh.... flamers. As a newbie to this list =
I've been trying to hold my tongue for the obligatory week before =
posting, but holding my tongue "Mah me thoun lahk pith" when I talk :)   =
 Ofcourse I sound even worse with my foot in my mouth.

	I think I'm going to have a ball at the next few parties trying to =
match the posts I've been reading to all the familiar faces.
=09
	Regarding the great E-debate, I've read PHIKAL cover to cover and I =
highly (no pun intended) recommend it for its wealth of  unbiased (sort =
of) knowledge concerning psycho-active compounds, the "fictional" book =
at the beginning was great reading as well.=20

I've also read everything else I can find on the subject. Everything =
else I've come across has been slanted badly for or against, and both =
sides twist the numbers.=20

One thing that is clear, is that eventhough this compound (mdma) has =
been around for ages, there hasn't been enough information made public =
for accurate assessments of the long term effects of standard =
recreational doses over long periods of time. (long sentence.Ughh.)

	The findings of brain damage in lab animals that I have come across =
(the findings, not the animals) all describe absurdly high doses at very =
short intervals. Conspicuously absent from the data of most of these =
studies is a control group. This tells me that either the researchers, =
or those presenting the data, are trying to draw conclusions that the =
data won't support.	=20

	Ok, I could talk for days on the subject, but I type rreeeaaalll =

of making that decision on our own, but its so hard to get any unbiased =

If you get "Agent" a great combined news&mail reader, then it will
separate your e-mail according to ANY criteria you devise (for example
you can have it look for "sfraves" in the To, CC, From and Sender
headers).   Then it puts all your e-mail into separate folders based
on these criteria.   For example, all my sfraves mailing list mail
goes into an "sfraves" folder automatically - BUT it doesn't have to
be mailing list mail, it can look for e-mail from specific friends and
do the same.  Anything that doesn't meet any criteria goes into
"inbox" folder.

It does cost something like $30-$40, but they provide excellent
technical support and frequent updates with great new features.

I'm just venting here-

A few months ago theron was discussing his new tape he had made.  Some of
you know him and can probably relate or let him know of my anger.
May it was and a few sfravers also comented on how good the tape was.  Well
I thought i would be good and contribute and purchased a tape.  I
corresponded with Theron and he sent me this:


thanx for your interest in my mix. you can get it directly from me by sendin=
g
$10 and your address to:

theron kagnoff
2000 broadway #1004
SF,CA 94115

it's 16 new goa/psychedelic trance trax beatmixed and blended by yours
truely. i'm quite pleased w/it and it sounds like others are fond of it as
well. most of the trax on it i review in the latest xlr8r magazine.

enjoy!
-theron

Well I did and nothing happened.  A few months went by and no tape but the
check was never cashed.  I figured it was lost in the snail mail.  No use
in canceling a 10 dollar check cuz it costs 10 dollars to do it.  No big
deal right.  Well a few weeks ago I get my bank statement and my check is
deposited to Theron Kagnoff.  Hmm ok well I figured he would NOW send me
his tape.  No TAPE!
I emailed him but his email is out of service and I am out of 10 buckes or
a "was-gonna-be-fresh" mixed tape by theron.

If any one knows him please drop him a line and see if he can send me the
tape, or my 10 bucks.  If that doesn't happen tell him a BIG FUCK YOU!!!!

No Peace.  No Unity.  No Love.  NO RESPECT!!!!

Austin

I am not talking about physical death, Melissa.  That was the point.  Within
each of us IMO there is not found both darkness and light, but rather a
struggle to break free from one into the other. I know I may well be in the
minority here to think such, but this is my freedom and my right to do so.
I do not beleive in the yin/yang.  Rather, I beleive we are the line which
is found in the middle; and in this world, in our short existances here, is
where we are given the opportunity to seek out a rebirth.  This rebirth can
be into Life or into death.  Preferably from the dark and into the light,
for this also breaking free from death into LIFE.  This has nothing to do
with religion, but everything to do with the human soul.  Surrendering
onesself over to legions of dark things and abandoning conscious thought in
the name of self-discovery is utterly the biggest deception I know of IMO.

There was talk of boycotting the BlitzKrieg rave in LA because of the name
and what it meant to people.  Many people voiced their opinons about how
dreadful and inappropriate that name was.  BM is not about rebirth, it is
about celebration of permanent death and about surrendering to utter lies.
THIS is my opinon.  This is how I see the world.  I am free to do so.

        Actually, i read that while half of the caffeine monkeys were
tearing each other's throats out, the other half were found wearing black
berets, smoking cigarettes and quoting Satre. Go figure.

Even though I'm not going to BM - I finally feel compelled to say
something about "your" interpretation of BM.... I know the people who
created the BM ceremony (and suspect that you don't)... and I can tell
you that they have no such intention as you ascribe to them... but
if truth be told they have NO INTENTION AT ALL....

  The BM ceremony is a ceremony without any overt purpose - the creators
of this ceremony were adamant that they DO NOT want to impose any
reason or dogma to the burn... it's about personal interpretations and
values... each person is free to make their own... or none at all...
Thus, you are free to your personal interpretation of it just as everyone
else... BUT where you make a mistake is applying your own personal dogma
to everyone else - the creators of BM are not responsible for your negative
interpretation of their symbol - you are. You are trying to make a general
symbol an ABSOLUTE symbol which is the exact reason that Christianity has
become so corrupt and valueless to so many people.... but that is another
story. Just quit trying to tell everyone else YOUR TRUTH as if it is THE
TRUTH... it hasn't worked in the past and it doesn't work now...

StEvEo's 1st ANNUAL HUMAN CARCOPHONIC ORCHESTRA!

Saturday eve (round bout 8:30pm(look for the flyer on the main message board
in town) on the playa, we'll be conducting an experiment in sound. The basic
idea is this: A large goup of people making lots of noises (chants, favorite
rave choruses, operatic singing, grunts, doo-wops, zerberts, etc.)
It would be nice to have a couple didges and and drums, but primarily human
noises. It will be "chaotic freestyle" for the most part but we might try
"conducting" a few volleys with several people on similiar rhythms. Please,
if you have any interest in tribal sounds and communal harmony, come by and
support this seemingly loopy idea of mine! Thanks,
-StEvEo
P.S. Remember to look for the superbly designed HUMAN CARCOPHONIC ORCHESTRA
poster, it will have our location and time.

Hi all!

 Does anyone out there know when they plan to burn the man on the playa? 
I would like to have my own burning celebration (out with the old... 
willingly giving up something to support something new) and would like to 
roughly coincide with the folks at BM.

Thanks!


Ran

just some obsolete thoughts from my side.
what i like about wowser is that he seems to be a considered guy and he 
really *tries*. 
i never found myself agreeing with him in any way, but i sorta like his 
attitude. he really really is a couraged and humble fighter for the Lord, 
not being afraid of inconvenience nor giving shit on his reputation.
i think thats gorgeous.

i can live quite well with that kind of people, as i can with the ones 
that aren't up for saving the world but just wanna party.
the thing i kinda dislike is what sometimes comes through 
on the list here, people behaving like their partying and doing drugs was 
the way to save the world. you know i strongly suspect saving the world would 
be way more painful than dosing everybody with ecstasy and doesn't have much 
to do with just going with the ceaseless flow of fun events throughout the 
year in a happy daze.

concerning the arguments you found to kick wowsers little butt - i think 
they are not worth the figurative paper you typed them on.

the fact that something is well organized and creatively done alone doesnt 
make it good and supportable in any way.

10000 people can very well be wrong. just imagine that being said about 
the third reich or something (not that i'm making comparisons, god forbid).

some people putting effort into organizing something is no reason to 
appreciate it. 
..ohhh, i put so much effort into preparing that little baby coffin and 
sprinkling blood all over the altar...
(not that i'm making comparisons again)
  
' get a life and leave us in peace to make our own individual decisions ' -
you would say that to jesus too, would you,  
you wicked, wicked faithless little snob you :)

anyway i'm happy to notice raveland is nothing more than any normal 
amusement park and this list doesn't contain more plur than any arbitray 
24 hour nautilus, because thats something i always suspected and 
thats something i can *relate* to.

Umm... Tough question. I think that copyright law is some thing like 15 years must pass until 
something is considered "Public Domain". This means that you can use OLD material that has 
been coprighted once this time limit passes. Unless of course the owner of the copyright 
applies for an extension, Which I belive is possible. IMHO, if it's a snippet you're 
capturing from some obscure SciFi movie for a track you're going to play live at a party, no 
one is going to care. If on the other hand, you're U2 (sorry), You'd definitely have to get 
the owners ok.

I had always thought that this was part of the reason that "White Labels" were made. If you 
has a killer track with some funky samples, which were some one elses, you put it on a White 
Label so no one knows who to sue )>.

Any one care to give us a "White Label" history lesson?

If you're using a sampler you'll most likely need 1/4in to RCA cables. Every VCR I've ever 
seen has RCA plugs on the back. HI-Fi VCR's will output in <STEREO> but older ones are mono. 
Mono is usually adquate though.

It is a great .sig. BTW, I did not know where it came from till I saw 
your .sig, but there's a sample of a girl saying "I am for you" in a 
track by Paradise 3001 called "When the magnetic flow fails". It's on 
their Sunspots cd/record.

It is a great .sig. BTW, I did not know where it came from till I saw 
your .sig, but there's a sample of a girl saying "I am for you" in a 
track by Paradise 3001 called "When the magnetic flow fails". It's on 
their Sunspots cd/record. It's really trippy (for lack of a better 
word).

heya.....thinking about Wowser and possibily joining a 24 hour Nautilus gym,
and "hey you get off of my cloud"......don't you just the love the smell of
poetry in the morning??? No, I think I quoted that wrong from Apocalypse
Now.  But, there has been so much flaming going on recently.  I guess most
people were just getting "fired up" for going to Burning Man......Maybe we
need to remember not to play with matches....

uh?? Maybe we need to remember what Voltaire said about PLUR,...."I may not
agree with you, but I will defend until the death your right to say it..."
This from a guy who spent most of his life as a professional pariah. When we
really "flame" someone, it's the same as burning them at the stake as some
kind of heretic or witch. The truth is, we only have as much freedom as we
are willing to allow someone else.....I am afraid that if we allowed some
people on this list to be in charge of the world or this list, it would be
the smell of napalm morning.....sulphur,sulphur, everywhere.....and such a
lot of stink!!!! 

                              thoughts from a burnt man...SpinSilver

P.S. favorite e.e. cummings:

        "you shall above all things
        be glad and young
        for if you are glad and young
        whatever life you wear
        it will become you
        and if you're glad
        whatevers living
        will yourself
        become......'

ok heres the latest...... 
 
we still have space available in the van I rented 
 
for those that want a breakdown of the cost and argue that $75 is too much
to pay 
 
it is a 15 passenger van that we will remove the seats and add phutons to
make space for equipment (backpacks etc....) I am looking for 10 people to
split the costs 
 
the van was $500 (tax/insurance etc..) and I expect the gas to run as high
as $200 so as you see it's costing me in the neighborhood of $700 
 
As it is I have made consessions for 4 people who have to work friday day
and I am waiting to leave friday at approx 7pm or so........ we will be
returning sometime late monday afternoon........I still have room for as
many as 4 people 
 
I am stressing out trying to organize 10 responsible people who won't back
out after committing   ............so far over 20 people have called,
booked, confirmed and then cancelled. In addition I will be doing all the
driving. 
 
I wish I could afford to be the pide piper and take you all for free, but I
am as broke (if not more so ) as the rest of you........ 
 
so please, if you truly need a ride and are willing to share a vision of
collective travel and enjoyment.....call me at 415-337-6666

Ulrike,

        Please remember that not all of us are like the loudest "voices" on
this list.  There are many within this community who truly believe that our
unconditional love and positivity is a valuable inspirational force, and we
hope that it will help us to take the reins and steer this world away from
the brink of disaster toward which it is very likely headed.
        For my part, I love every person, with my whole being.  That
doesn't mean I LIKE everyone, but I wish to continue to radiate light and
joy, and dose the world with my love, always to be kind and considerate of
others.  I don't know how many people pick up on this, but it's the most
important thing in my life, and I do hope it's appreciated.
        I've found people through this list who are of a like mind-set, to
varying degrees.  I hope that you will make it over here soon, and
experience firsthand what I'm describing.  I, we, await you with open
hearts.

Love,
Eric

It looks like my BM car-pooling plans have fallen through, so i'll be
driving my little hatchback up there, leaving this evening.

There's space for one more person (or maybe two really really small
people). If you're interested, email or phone on (408) 882-7385.

Thanks to everybody who responded to my "sampling from video" questions.
Seems we have a lot of DIY musicians among us! I hope to return to making
music after a pause of about 4.5 years (of raving) once I'm back home...

[ to sfraves ]

 This may be poor timing on my part ( with so many folks going out of
the area and away from their terminals for Burning Man ), but I was 
hoping to get some experienced answers -

 I'd like to explore the playing of MIDI instruments and sound samples
with my Mac. So, if anyone is making music with a Macintosh computer,
please give me the benefit of your wisdom:

1. What sequencer software would you recommend? It must be able to
   sequence MIDI events and the playback of sound samples.

2. What MIDI interface is good/bad?

3. The only sample playback card I know of for the Mac is SampleCell.
   Are there other and/or cheaper alternatives?

Equipment: I have an old Mac II w/accelerator , NuBus expansion slots,
           not PCI. I already have some sound manipulation software.

 Thanks for reading this!

Thought some of us might get kick out of this


>>  TOP TWENTY REASONS WHY CHOCOLATE IS BETTER THAN SEX:
>>  1)      You can GET chocolate.

>>  8)      Two people of the same sex can have chocolate without being
>>  called nasty names.

Hello! I'm sending this with the hope that everyone hasn't left yet.

My friend who I was supposed to be going with officially flaked last
night. All of the other people I know from around here who were going left
last night. My sister and brother-in-law got called into work.

I'm going to drive my car out there, but I'm a little leary of driving
that far with out having somewhere to stay.

I have a little tent from the 1960's, but that's about it.

I could probably track my friends down out there, but I would feel much
more comfortable if I could secure space in an RV before leaving.

If anyone has any space, even if too many people are already going, 
please, please contact me hopefully before friday. :)

					love, Alex


Oh, and for anyone out there who I happen to meet, I have really long
parted in the middle red hair.

Dear Friends & Family,

	Greetings!  I am back, after being away most of the summer
(Washington D.C. and Hawaii primarily), and procrastinating rejoining the
list because of the high volume of mail.  
	Hi again to those of you I had the pleasure of meeting (for the
first time, I think!) recently -- Matt Lanier, Wayne Correia (sp?), and
apologies to those I'm surely forgetting.
	
	The specific reason I'm here now, writing this, is that Chikako
[now my fiance!  :)] and I had hoped to attend Burning Man for the first
time this weekend.  We had made tentative plans to hook up with Amy
Starkey and her friend, but I neglected to get Amy's number, and I don't
have her email address.
	Amy, if you're reading this, please get in touch!  My number is
(415) 626-3036.  If we do not reach Amy or she's already left, we will be
looking for a ride to BM late Friday or early Saturday (unfortunately we
both have school on Friday) and are of course willing to chip in with gas
and other goodies.   8)
	Much looking forward to this, and to Harmony in a couple weeks!
Love & phat (sp?) hugs to you all!  ;)

Groovily yours, & sorry for the bandwidth,

In my book that would describe a fanatic. A type of person I don't really
find gorgeous. And the only thing he is *trying* is to put his particular
set of values upon us.

There are different ways of saving the world. And the discussion was not
about saving the world versus wanting to party. It was Wowser claiming
that BM is an evil event and other claiming he had no idea what BM
was really about, or put differently, BM not being an evil event which
will send its attendees eventually straight to hell but rather a celebration
of community and a place for people to get together and exchange ideas.
Or something like that.

Are you on the same sfraves list as I am? I can't remember anybody stating
that, except for the occasional post every now and then in which somebody
suggests that some people might lighten up a bit if they would indulge
into some mind altering chemicals. I don't think people on this list are
so naive.

Who said that? It's not about saving the world, the original discussion
was about Wowser claiming that BM was a bad thing to attend.

Hahaha, although I haven't been involved in this discussion until now
I would say Wowser's arguments are about as meaningful as those of his
opponents. He says BM is evil and bad for us. Period. Just because he
thinks so and without delivering real argumentation except that anything
which has to with the darker sides of life must be evil. His opponents simply
claimed that they had a different opinion on that issue and that he
may not have a good idea what BM is about.

Agreed, but people have also explained their opinions about relation
between dark and light, that there is no life without death and that each
ending can be a new beginning. Wowsers response was "that's not the way
I see it".

Next time he comes around, yes. It's been ~2000 years now...

I would say the plur on this list is somewhat higher than sampled on
average around us. People, however, get easily irritated by Bible
thumping folks, who, without other arguments than a 2000 year old book,
try to determine what's wrong or right for others to do. Christianity
has had its 2000 years to impregnate people with fear and lies, stood
at the beginning of the Inquisition and progroms against Jews and
essentially still tries to force its message down our throats instead
of just offering it for us to consider. I think that gives us the right
to put a few cynical remarks in a lousy E-mail sometimes...

Hello everyone,

    Well, ok, we have the sound system, we have a space, we have some 
of the djs: Ethan - Trent - Jondabomb? (please confirm Jon) - ? - &? 
We need a commited crew! So everyone that posted (or those of you who 
didn't) saying that they could or would help, please call the voicemail 
and leave your name and phone number. I will make a list and we can 
figure out a meeting place, and who will work when-doing what. So this 
is going to take a whole bunch of your involvement, cause most of my 
crew is at BM. So if you have any friends who can help that would be 
even more apprieciated. Also, if you could spread the word about this 
party in general, that would be help as well! 

    So let's all put in our strongest efforts and pull off this 
party!!!  

Peace,

Greg :)

     Hi all :
     
     Someone told me that some ravers (not SFRavers) were a bit unprepared 
     for the desert last year. I don't want to be one this year. Following 
     on from this does anyone have any practical raver-related tips to 
     surviving the weekend (in addition to the official tips or the 
     guardian feature) ?
     
     All suggestions gladly accepted:)
     
     
     (Sorry if this has been dealt with already, I've been off the list for 
     a few days)
     
     Peace,
     
     
     Ciaran O'

WHOAA!...I have been moving for the last two weeks an my computer has been
in a box....I never realised how much I would miss being on line and
reading all of these posts and being a part of sfraves! :-) well...I
actually went to one of those 5 minutes on line for a quarter boxes at a
cafe, last week when I sent a really hurried post regarding OPEN, sorry
for the brevity and any confusion that may have caused! 5 minutes is not
enough time to read and reply to all you guys!
	Well I went to OPEN with two rave virgins and anothert of my best
friends, after finding the spot way out in some east bay roller
rink...sheesh...we wnt in and basically we all had a blast...the
"butterfly room" was somewhat of a joke...although really cool, for all
the hype I was kinda dissapointed, Other things I noted were many younger
people around...one image that sticks with me is a teenage girl, dressed
up complete with teddy bear, pig taiils and a pacifier in one hand...and a
cigarette in the other...sheesh!
	There was a really rad jungle set done in the ambient rom around
3-4 am, from an amatuer perspective seemed quite technical with scratching
and stuff really neat. One last note...the life of a cup at this rave was
very short lived...the little cup was hardly noticed :-(
	But all in all we had a great time and enjoyed eachothers company
and danced alot and had fun which is what really matters anyway...peace
and love to all of you!

I know I know this is really late...but you never know...someone out there
may be on the verge of going to burning man but doesnt want to make the
trip alone, so when this hypothetical person reads my e-mail he/she will
sya...gee, two really cool guys from berkeley are looking to go to burning
man friday after work and will help me pay gas and I will have so much
fun, I guess that I
dont have to sit at home all weekend, (subliminal part) Im gonna write
tony back an e-mail and offer him and his friend a ride to burning man,
(end subliminal part) and then I will get a call saying
sure LETS GO!!! and everyone will be really happy! But since I am a poor
planner and didnt think of getting my plans together until now I am at the
mercy of said hypothetical person with room for two in a vehicle...


ps. I dont have a phone yet but will be checking my e-mail often until
tomorrow...

Venue: Remote, but not too remote ;)  Roomy :)  A little too much delay in
sound from corner to corner, though, as speakers were placed in each.
There were groups dancing in each corner, in front of the dj, and all
throughout, and still there was room to move around :)
Dance/chill area separation: insufficient to separate sound :(
Air: not hot OR smoky :)
Lighting: Impressive; radiating lights above turntables, a clear plastic
person with blinking colored lights inside suspended from the ceiling.  A
couple house lights on made the place to lit up, though :|
Music: Wonderful and dancy throughout, only one near-trainwreck, well
recovered.  Dj Trance was in rare form, and Moshe was a madman with his
scratching frenzy in the chill area! :D
VIBE: Not intense, but very pleasant and positive.  Friendly people.  Hare
Krishnas were cool.  The crew were enthusiastic.
Features: Free massage was excellent!  The butterflies were beautiful, but
it was just a glass case.  I was hoping for something more interactive, but
that might have gotten out of hand...
This was the first party in a long time where I didn't know at least 1/3 of
the people.  It was refreshing, but I missed everyone who wasn't there.  We
got to bring in water :)  I left my candy bag unattended in both areas, and
it was unmolested the whole party through :D
Overall: I greatly enjoyed the party!  Excellent job on the part of the
Nexus crew; I hope to attend their events again.

Peace,
Eric

window that she wished to take the $3 million she had in the bag and open 
an account with the bank.
     
She said that first, though, she wished to meet the president of Chase 
Manhattan Bank due to the amount of money involved.  The teller seemed 
to think that was a reasonable request and after opening the paper
bad and seeing the bundles of $1000 bills which amounted to right around $3 
million, telephoned the bank's secretary to obtain an appointment for the 
lady.  The lady was escorted upstairs and ushered into the president's 
office.
     
Introductions were made and she stated that she would like to get to know 
the people she did business with on a more personal level.  The bank 
president then asked her where she came into such large amount of money. 
"Was it an inheritance?" he asked.  "No." she answered. 
"Was it from playing the stock market?"  "No", she replied. 
He was quiet for a minute, trying to think of where this little old lady 
could possibly come into $3 million.
     
"I bet." she stated.
     
"You bet?" repeated the bank president.  "As in horses?" 
"No." she replied, "I bet people."
     
Seeing his confusion, she explained that she just bets different things
with people.  All of a sudden she said, "I'll bet you $25,000.00 that by 10:00 
o'clock tomorrow morning, your balls will be square."  The bank president 
figured she must be off her rocker and decided to take her up on the bet.
He didn't see how he could lose..  For the rest of the day, the bank 
president was very careful.  He decided to stay home that evening and take 
no chances; there was $25,000.00 at stake.
     
When he got up in the morning and took his shower, he checked his balls to 
make sure everything was okay.  There was no difference; they looked the 
same as they always had.  He went to work and waited for the little old
lady to come in at 10:00 o'clock, humming as he went.  He knew this would be a 
good day' how often do you get handed $25,000.00 for doing nothing.
     
At 10:00 o'clock sharp, the little old lady was shown into his office.
With her was a younger man.  When he inquired as to the man's purpose for being 
there, she informed him that he was her lawyer and she always took him
along when there was this much money involved.  "Well," she asked, "what 
about our bet?"
     
"I don't know how to tell you this," he replied, "but I am the same as 
I've always been only $25,000.00 richer."
     
The lady seemed to accept this, but requested that she be able to see for 
herself.  The bank president thought this was reasonable and dropped his 
trousers.  She instructed him to bend over and then grabbed a hold of his 
balls with both her hands.  Sure enough, everything was fine.
     
The bank president then looked up and saw her lawyer standing across the 
room banging his head against the wall.
     
"What's wrong with him?"  he inquired.  "Oh him," she replied, "I bet him 
$100,000.00 that by 10:00 o'clock this morning that I'd have the president 
of Chase Manhattan Bank by the balls."

Hello All!

I was at my companie's (Excite - the search engine) weekly Monday 
all-hands meeting today when one of the product managers anounced 
that he was looking for some volunteers from Excite to POSSIBLY go
to Burning Man with a company supplied rental truck filled with 
water bottles to hand out for free at BM...of course the bottles
will have our logo/url on them. Concerned, I warned the product manager
that this BSP could possibly backfire noting that what makes real
underground parties so special is that positive vibe which is some-
thing that cannot be bought, sold or commercialized. We all know 
that it's unconditional love given freely with no IDENTIFICATION or
GRATIFICATION of one's ego is what creates the vibe. 

My intention in this post is not to start a flame war but to ask for 
your valued opinion on this product manager's idea. He has said that
it would just be made available for the taking, out of the back of a
truck and would not have banners posted all over the place. Also,
the water would not be passed out intentionally, like flyers, but 
people would have to go to the truck to get it. 

Personally I don't think it's a good promotional idea for the reasons
stated above...I will gladly forward your opinions to him.

Peace and UNCONDITIONAL LOVE always,
John

clearly, you're taking the intent of Burning Man a little TOO seriously,
if it has any intent, it's a bit more satirical than anything else.

So there is this thread about love and how burning man is not about love 
or renewal or rebirth or putting a lot of energy into something 
completely useless and futile because at the end of the day everything is 
completely useless and futile but you might as well do something 
completely useless and futile that is fun or what have you. Then there is 
this question about whether that involves love. And then there seems to 
be loads of people saying it is all about love or it is devoid of love 
which makes me wonder if these people have the same idea of love and I 
doubt they do.
	So, let me inject something a thought here. To some, like myself, 
love has nothing to do with playing with fuzzy animals and depending on 
support from those "loved" ones or lying around in big cuddle piles (all 
of which can be nice) or whatever else I have seen "love" described as or 
when I have been a part, have had people tell me that they just love me. 
That's nice, but I hope it's not because I chose to wave around a stuff 
animal and merely smile. And if these are things that make up an event 
that is "filled with love" then I agree, Burning Man is pretty devoid of 
love.
	To me, the greatest love comes from those people who let me be 
who I am at the moment, and who aren't going to start placing all kinds 
of conditions on how I interact with them. They are people who are not 
going to let me ask too much of them or let me lull myself into some 
whinging state in which I cannot deal with my own shit on a day to day 
basis. They are the people who take responsiblity for themselves and let 
those around them do the same. And I have found burning man to be a 
ffestival full of these people.
	So before going out and yelling about how this place is evil and 
how people should not go, why not let them go and decide for themselves 
whether they think it is evil, whether they enjoy the saracasm of the 
events or whatever they find in them? Why not let them go out and look at 
themselves and see if they are how they want to be, or if they might 
learn to more how they want to be out on the playa? Saying something 
about your feelings on the subject is your right and often leads to 
discussion that might let you see someone's views, buyt some of this 
thread seems like I-know-what-is-best-for-everyone, and I for one, don't 
like other people demanding to live my life for me. Please let me make my 
own mistakes because, to a certain degree, it is the best way I learn...

I hate to be so blunt, shallow, and mindless, in that I truly don't
understand exactly what burning man is meant to be or mean, but it's
interesting to see people offer all these great birth/death concepts, and
other really deep thoughts in regard to what burning man means, and I'm
sure that there were some spiritual agendas that the promoters had in mind
when they began the concept many years ago. 
 
I actually feel that I don't fully understand how deep the concepts and
reasons for BM are, although I have more insight now about it than I did 2
days ago, and from what I am starting to realize is that it means different
things to different people. 
 
After being in the UK all summer and attending a few festivals and seeing
the rave element in it's grandest scheme, I have a huge respect for BM
because it INCLUDES a rave area in it's concept as well as all the other
elements it has to offer.  
 
What makes it my favorite event to attend is that it is all inclusive, and
not just about one concept (like rave).  While the festivals in Europe
cater primarily to a rave element and audience, the BM offers one a chance
to see and hear and participate in many different perspectives of life well
beyond just raving. (excuse me for using the word "rave", but it does help
to make the point.) 
 
It is this element of BM that turned me on so much last year (my first BM),
in addition to the fact that they offered a rave camp and besides, I got to
hang out and be with some of my favorite people in the world.  
 
My parents were hippies and musicians when I was a child, and I hung out at
hippie communes, jazz festivals, nudist colonies (yes I was around in the
60's and 70's) and had many different perspectives and experiences to help
mold me into the cyber hippie freak that I consider myself now. DJing in
the 90's and playing many different styles of music, (not just house,
trance, techno, or triphop etc...) is just another perspective to help make
me even more varied and diversified as an individual. 
 
It is the very mixture of hippy/cyber/rasta/gay and whatever other elements
etc, and the variety of people that are extremely varied in life, age,
backgrounds, race, and beliefs, etc... that gives me a feeling that this is
an open minded and futuristic place, while at the same time has basic
humanistic values that trancend time, race, sex, and values. and gives me a
feeling of being a child back in the 60's. 
 
I remember last year I was astonished that some ravers hung out in the rave
camp only, and never even walked over and checked out the BM camp. I felt
what a shame to close yourself off to such a glorious experience, just
because you are so into raving, that you could'nt explore the elements of
BM beyond just your interests. 
 
 
 
(here comes the really shallow and mindless part). I truly have to say that
one of the main reasons I attend BM is that I get to do lots of drugs, get
naked (legally), and in general just be as wild & free as I can possibly
be. This world is far too uptight and rigid, and we rarely get a chance to
release the kind of emotions and energy that BM offers. 
 
This summer I went to a festival in France and I saw 2 girls (excuse
me.....women), that were topless and rolling around in the mud. I had to
approach and ask if they had ever heard of BM, they had not so I began to
tell them about the mud people at last years event. as I began to explain
it I decided to join them, and so I got naked and took a running start and
literally dove in with them.  
 
Now at last years BM I thought wow, I could'nt possibly roll around naked
in mud (well I could roll around naked, just not neccesarily in mud), I
thought who wants to get that dirty with no showers around etc....., but
aftrer rolling in the mud with my new friends, I realized the irony of the
situation was that once I got totally covered in mud like that, nothing the
rest of the weekend could affect me. I did'nt need to worry about sitting
in the dirt fields where the cow's shit, or walking through a stream bare
foot and getting my feet dirty, or getting dirty climbing a tree, etc....
The fact that I had already gotten completely covered from head to toe in
mud, meant that I'd already been there, and so it gave me a sense of
freedom I had never felt before. 
 
well anyway I hope this helps to clarify my position on why I am so
emotional about the BM event. It has helped to give me more freedom than I
could ever find before. (and without even fully understanding the true
spiritual elements) 
 
so don't be suprized if you see me leading the charge at mudhenge 
 
I would just like to add one last observation, and that is that I think
anyone who has ever thrown an event, or plans to in the future could learn
a great deal from the organizers of BM. they have captured an ora,
imagination and feeling that trancends beyond anything I've witnesses
before. In addition they have the backing of the local authorities because
they approach all aspects of it with dignity, respect, and care. 
 
I hope to see as many of you out there as I can possibly can.........I
can't wait

Not to forget the cool Egyptian motifs - pyramids, sphinx's, etc
which added a nice touch, I thought!

Very young crowd. And the famous juice bar, where I had the pleasure
of meeting Raven for the first time, hi Raven! (Hope you had fun at
BM!).

But I had to leave early as I was saving my energy for crewing at
Hallucination the following night! (hi Ran, Steve, Brendon the 
firestarter, etc!).

I know this is a long shot, but I'm driving down to L.A. this weekend
(there's some cool stuff going on down there, as always.) I have some extra
space in the car, and I wouldn't mind the company. I've got mixtapes, bring
some of your own, you know the drill. I'm leaving tomorrow afternoon, and
I'm coming back Monday afternoon. Anybody up for a trip to see our southern

John, you're so rad and we love you. I'm sure everyone would 
appreciate the free water. And although Burning Man seems to become 
progressively commercial, I'm sure your intentions will shine through
your product manager's.

Safe travels to everyone attending Burning Man.....

Dear friends & family,

	In my haste to send off my last message from school earlier today,
I neglected to put a subject on it, so for anyone who may have skipped or
deleted it, Chikako and I are looking for a ride to Burning Man sometime
around 5pm Friday or later.  We need to be back by early Tuesday morning,
and will of course pitch in for gas, and share goodies.  I also have tapes
and CDs for the ride up if desired.
	We are in San Francisco near Market and Noe, if that makes a
difference, and can be reached at (415) 626-3036 or (415) 270-7887
(voicemail).
	Thanks for any help, and apologies for the repeat message.

Burning with anticipation,
				<<< Starchild >>>

 There is the survival hints page at the Burning Man web site:

 http://www.istorm.com/burningman/required.html

 Also - a local "sexy naked people" tabloid called the Spectator has
an article about Burning Man in this week's issue! I saw it on a 
local newsrack, among the skin mags. The article is illustrated with
photos of naked gals at BM, naturally. Some seem to be covered with 
the mud from that storm that happened last year.

 no that doesn't describe a fanatic. read it again. it describes a very brave
 person.	
 you *think* wowser's a fanatic. that would roughly be somebody with these 
 features who additionally cannot be reached by arguments and reason anymore. 
 maybe he is one. you know i believe it's our better features that can 
 make us a fanatic eventually if they grow just a bit out of proportion.

It's time for us to say good-bye.  To all those who are not going I'll
dance and sweat my ass off for you(it gets HOT out there!)
And to all those who are going... see you there!!!!  We will be traveling
in a Burgandy Subaru and we answer to the names Melissa, Krishna, and Erin.
Does anybody know where the VW camp is going to be?

Hi everybody!

 Well the summer session at UCSC is drawing to a close and that means the 
powers that be at this fine university are kicking us out for the three 
weeks until next (fall) quarter starts. Oh I could pay more money to live 
here but I'm broke (the starving artist/student) so it's sofa surfing 
time! :( I'm moving on Aug. 31st.

 My phone will be off for the next three weeks but will be back on, on 
Sept. 24 (should be the same #). In the meantime I can be reached here or 
at work (UCSC Media Services).

 Yes, I am stressed... moving, finals, unrequitted love, poor finances. 
However I'm very thankful for the friends and aquaintances I have... You 
all, delibrately or inadvertantly, help and I thank you all.


Peace,


Ran

  Okay, I'm real bored too.  I won't be able to come out to the beach
party due to work, work, and work.
  *sigh*
  But my love and energy will be there!
  Have fun!

Dear You Guys,

Anybody out there feel like you did when you were young and all the cool
kids got to go to a really neat party and you had to stay home because your
parents wouldn't let you go and you knew all the cool kids were having fun
without you and probably didn't even care that you weren't there?

I'm off to Black Rock Desert!  I'll bring the best vibe I can and 
I'll take all the fantastic raver spirit from SF I can.  I'll be
wearing a preposterously large blue and yellow Mad-Hatter style
hat (some of the time at least), and, of course, my little red devil
horns.  so come say hi if you spot me.
see ya

Nah, that's when I get a bunch of my cool friends and throw my own cool

[moonpup gave his point of view on Burning Man]
Thank you, moonpup!  I thought I didn't understand the concept of BM
either, and that was a large part of my decision not to go.  It appears
(from your observation and others') that Burning Man is all about freedom
and release.  I think that's something that everyone on this list, in the
larger rave community, and many people in the global community can
appreciate.  To all who aren't attending this year: if there's one next
year, we should all seriously consider going!

Peace,
Eric

I've seen a lot of talk about the MEANING of Burning Man, and I've not
said anything until now.  When I went last year, somebody who had gone
before had the sense to tell me that there is NO real meaning.  It is
what it is and also what you make of it.  It's whatever you want it to
be.

So last year I pondered a bit (during the eight hour car trip), and
decided that for me, the Burning of the Man was going to represent the
burning of a lot of behaviors and traits in me that I didn't like.  Last
summer was a very introspective summer for me, and I learned a lot about
myself.  I had become very intimate with the monsters, demons, and
angels that make up my personality.  Burning Man last year was the
culmination of those thoughts and experiences, and during the actual
ritual I worked hard to burn the demons and free the angels.

This year, frankly, I haven't thought about it much.  I've been so busy
with my daily life that it's only been until last night that I realized
it's almost upon me.  Today, I finish packing and wait for my ride and
start thinking about the meaning of B.M. for me THIS YEAR.  I have no
answers yet, but I can tell you that it is NOT solely a RAVE for me,
although I probably will.

When I'm there I draw on the spiritual energy of the place.  Think about
it: it is a prehistoric lakebed.  The place is OLD, VERY OLD, and there
is some STRONG energy there.  You can feel the energy, and with a little
work you can tap into it.

One other note: the theme of being free is very prevalent.  There's
something very special about going to a place where there really no laws
and nobody really cares about what you're doing or why you are the way
you are.  Everybody is accepted as is.

HERE'S A GOOD STORY FROM LAST YEAR TO ILLUSTRATE:

My friend C. and I were near the man after he had been burned.  I was
dancing around the fire, but C. was about twenty feet away, in the
moonlit darkness.  It was a while before I noticed about seven cops
(local, state, I can't remember) standing away from the fire, watching. 
I was a little weirded out, but I ignored them.  My friend C. was
smoking a cigarette, a little behind and to the side of them, also
watching the fire.

After a while the cops turned to go and, as they walked passed him, one
came over and asked him for a cigarette and a light.  C. said sure,
picked up his backpack from the ground, gave the cop a cigarette and a
light.  The other cops had all stopped and were standing around
nonchalantly.  The cop said "Thanks a lot" and then they all turned and
walked away.  They were very cool, he said.

It was at that moment that my friend C. realized he was standing there
stark naked except for his shoes.


Anyway, I leave in a few hours.  Hope you all have a marvelous time
here.  Remember: IT IS WHAT YOU MAKE OF IT.  I think that applies to
more than just life -- uh -- Burning Man, I mean. :-)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

DEATH OF AN INNOCENT

I went to a party, Mom, I remembered what you said.
You told me not to drink, Mom, so I drank soda instead.
I really felt proud inside, Mom, the way you said I would.
I didn't drink and drive, Mom, even though the others said I should.

I know I did the right thing, Mom, I know you are always right.
Now the party is finally ending, Mom, as everyone is driving out of sight.
As I got into my car, Mom, I knew I'd get home in one piece.
Because of the way you raised me, so responsible and sweet.

I started to drive away, Mom, but as I pulled out into the road,
the other car didn't see me, Mom, and hit me like a load.
As I lay there on the pavement, Mom, I hear the policeman say,
the other guy is drunk, Mom, and now I'm the one who will pay.

I'm lying here dying, Mom.  I wish you'd get here soon.
How could this happen to me, Mom?  My life just burst like a balloon.
There is blood all around me, Mom, and most of it is mine.
I hear the medic say, Mom, I'll die in a short time.

I just wanted to tell you, Mom, I swear I didn't drink.
It was the others, Mom.  The others didn't think.
He was probably at the same party as I.
The only difference is, he drank and I will die.

Why do people drink, Mom?  It can ruin your whole life.
I'm feeling sharp pains now.  Pains just like a knife.
The guy who hit me is walking, Mom, and I don't think it's fair.
I'm lying here dying and all he can do is stare.

Tell my brother not to cry, Mom.  Tell Daddy to be brave.
And when I go to heaven, Mom, put "Daddy's Girl" on my grave
Someone should have told him, Mom, not to drink and drive.
If only they had told him, Mom, I would still be alive.

My breath is getting shorter, Mom.  I'm becoming very scared.
Please don't cry for me, Mom.  When I needed you, you were always there.
I have one last question, Mom, before I say good bye.
I didn't drink and drive, so why am I the one to die?

************************
Someone took the effort to write this poem.

So please, forward this to as many people as you can.
And see if we can get a chain going around the world that will
make people understand that drinking and driving don't mix.

TOGETHER WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE, so please forward this letter
to as many people as you can.

hi all!


 well more shit for ran; i had a bicycle accident today -- some kid was 
skateboarding on the bike path at ucsc -- where you are not supposed to 
-- some rules are good it seems-- and he jumped off just before i reached 
him -- in an attempt not to hit him i hit the board, flipped and tore a 
ligament in my left shoulder. incrediblly painful! so now i have to move 
tommorrow by myself without the use of my left arm and i missed the play 
that i helped to direct for class this summer -- sigh --

 anyway, i can only type with one hand now so my posts will look a little 
bit more sloppy than usual -- sorry.


peace


ran

There are plenty of US who have not gone, for one reason or another.  This
is year number two that I had tentative plans and they fell through.  Oh
well, no biggie, hopefully next year, if I still have an SO, then I'll go,
otherwise my ass will be at home next year as well.

For this weekend, I have my son for the duration (very, very cool!!!), so
we'll be doing the city, scamming on wimmin, and doing father and son
stuff.  I would rather be doing this than crackerjacking in the desert.

There is life outside of BM, rave, parties, etc.  I like it all.

Peace & have a good weekend,
John

P.S.  Also there will be a BBQ at my son's godfather's house, so we'll be
cruising by there.  Sultan will get to see his dad get a bit irreverant,
all in all the formula for a great weekend.

Peace.

hi,
I'm looking for a ride to the Harmony three year party on Sept. 14th.  I live
in SF (lower Haight).  I'd be willing to pay for gas, and also share some
party favors.  Or if anyone else is without a ride maybe we could rent a car
together and share the cost.  I hear that this party is going to be really 
good.
thanks,
Bruce

  Yup, it is gonna be a PHENOMENAL time :)
  I'm looking for a ride too, I'm in upper haight.  I'd split costs of a
rental, but I can't drive... but I'd be willing to split anyway, if there
were a couple of other drivers.  Gas costs also willingly paid, of course.
  I'm excited already!

	**** You couldn't have said it better...
		Raves are for those who want to go and enjoy...as long as
		they don't start shit it's all good  =)

		You just spread the vibe you can and have fun yourself...don't
		worry about the "GANGSTA's".

	Remember:

I visited the Burning man website to see if the modern miracles of
internet-broadcast were taking place, and they aren't. 

Perhaps something has happened?
last year I visited the site and read a small but existing Black rock
Gazette which had some of the days events.
This year promised so much, yet so far...nothing.

	people, you've got to come! leave all your prejudices at home ... lose
	them all together :0  
				**DONT ASSUME**
		...that just because this has been the MOST advertised 
event of the summer, that will deffinately 'suck'... you know what ...
							'''it might not'''
	take your vibe, your glowsticks, your smiles...
		and meet us by the right front speaker of the HUGE
								(new) room.

  Hey people.  Looks like I won't make it to the beach party tonight.  (What
a surprise.)  This always happens to me.  Thanx to all the wonderful people
who offered me rides and hope you all have a great time.  It takes alot of
effort to say this... I'm totally tired and bummed about not going.  If it
changes at the last minute I might see you there.  If not.... bring me a
souvenier.  Thank you again.  I'm out...
