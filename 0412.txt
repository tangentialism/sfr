Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Question for the geeks

There's no way USB can supply 5A @ 5V. That's 25W per USB port. Your
4-port USB hub will need up to 100W.

FYI, each USB port can supply 500mA (x5V = 2.5W). See
http://www.usb.org/developers/usbfaq/#pow1


FWIW, I think PCMCIA should be able to supply as much power as USB.
While I don't have the official specs, keep in mind that a PCMCIA Type
III slot can power a 1.8" hard drive (the same kind used in an iPod
maxi), these drives can consume up to 2.5W @ 5V.

It's ridiculous to think a PCMCIA Wifi use only a few mA, the radio
module needs much more than that. The typical CardBus wifi adaptor
should use 300-600mA in transmit and 20-50mA in power-saving idle.

What's more likely is that the USB adapter does draw a little more
power (maybe 20%-30%) to raise its radio output and lack power-saving
mode, but the chipset itself should consume roughly the same amount of
power as CardBus adapters.

Nick, I suggest you turning on power-saving mode in the usb wifi
driver (if it has such mode) or simply lower the radio output power
and see if it makes a difference. You can always borrow a friend's
PCMCIA card can see if there's a considerable difference in power
consumption.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Lycos search engine promoting screensaver that fights spam

This is all well and good, but why is Lycos trying to be my friend?

This reminds of the pop-up/under banner ads blocking programs that
have been rolled out as a 'feature' only recently by aol/netscape,
yahoo, earthlink, msn, etc, etc, et al.

Funny, I haven't had a pop-up or unwanted banner ad for YEARS before
that 'feature' got introduced by any one of these companies.

How?

By using a simple modified 'hosts' plain text file, not any sort of
special program to deal with it.

Not only that, but it has been common knowledge in the computer
industry that this is an effective way to block these unwanted banner
and pop-up/under ads, which leads me to ask why it's not included from
the get-go when installing an OS?

Why all the heel-dragging by our wonderful and benevolent corporate
powers that be?

Because in the meantime, before the end-user gets to figure this out
on their own, aol/earthlink/msn etc can collect revenue from the
advertisers, and then when things go too far they can look like a good
guy by providing the means to stop the problem that they created in
the first fucking place.

Don't get me started on spamming and spammers.

On my last dotcom.bomb job, my ex-boss had a clause in all our
website's 'terms of use' that PROMISED to sell your email address to
the highest bidder, irregardless if you were a paying customer or not.

Of course, if you tried to email my boss, you got an email back saying
that if you want to get 'white-listed' as being not a spammer, please
follow this link to a website form for you to fill out.

If this super simple method of 'white-listing,' which is used by a
spammer to eliminate spam from his in-box, were to be widely adopted
it could knock out a good 75% of the spam that people.
get.

So how come people aren't doing this yet?

Well, in my ex-bosses case, if he were to make this available to his
spammee customers he would lose his back-end spam business.

Nothing slimy about this arrangement, is there?

God bless Corporate America.

IF Lycos and any other email provider was to get serious about
eliminating spam, they'd take their cue from a werld-class spammer,
who just so happens to have his Ph.D from Stanford.

Think he might know something about it?

The method he uses to block spam from his in-box, but not yours, is
outlined below.

Thanks for your email.  

To combat spammers, I only accept email from people with emails on my
"friends list".

To get on the list, you need to fill out the contact form at 

http://breakthru.com/andrew/

Once you fill out this form, you'll be able to email me directly.

I really appreciate you going through this process as it saves me
going through hundreds of spam emails per day.

This way, I can get back to you faster! ;)

Thanks again,

Andrew

hey Andrew,

Read about Lycos's DDoS screensaver, am wondering why you haven't
shared this white-listing method of yours with the World Wide Web,
since it would so obviously werk for 100s of millions of computer

Lycos is using?

Any comments?

I'm impressed.

However, I'm also curious as to why wasn't Apple including a modified
'hosts' text file banner/pop-up blocker of their own, back in, say,
1996, or so, when they knew about it then, (my friend that showed me
how to do this had employee #12 on his Apple badge and he was still on
the payroll, though he didn't have to be, lucky him), and it was
already becoming a problem for people?

Apple is just doing this now?

Why the long wait?

All this stuff being brought out now to help the end user feels to me
just like it did when Ashlee Simpson got busted lip-synching, or Condi
Rice got called out at the 9.11 hearing.

Same cultural ethic at play.

Some egregious back-handed shit gets played that the end-user ends up
paying for, and the response is,

'let's just move on, shall we?'

With little, or nothing, done to remedy the situation.

I wonder how much longer people will be willing to put up with this?

Subject: [sfraves] Reason/Orkester CD question (nrr)

I heard there was a way to replicate Orkester  for
Reason by burning a CD with certain Reason folders in
it.  (You need the Orkester CD to open Reason.)  

Anyone know the workaround?

cheers,
peter

If you make an exact duplicate of the CD it should work.  Also, the 
installer (if you have it) will give you the option of creating an 
Orkester folder on your hard drive.

what I did was make disk images from the original CDs (Orkester and 
Sound Bank) on my hard drive.  i didn't have the installer.

hello, this is a continuation of a fictional piece:

"so, do you believe in invisible things, ig?"

"well, i do believe that i can't see them, and if i
think i can't see them, then i am acknowledging them,
so i guess that they exist somewhere. kind of like
those little bugs that are on everyone's eyelashes all
day and all night. no one can see them, but they are
there." :)

Jeff is right on.  PCMCIA cards usually have decent power
savings mode built in.   Go to system, devices, the wifi
card, properties, and look for a power savings mode.  It
may or may not have one since USB devices cater more
to the desktop crowd.

Subject: [sfraves] Totally OT:  get a free ipod.... so easy!!

it actually works!

the trick is to sign up for one of the services and cancel it-

I actually ordered coffee from this website- Boca Java- (turned out to
be really yummy) then cancelled my membership from them.

and was released from my obligation.

use my referral link to sign up:

http://www.freeiPods.com/?r=8180101

its easy and if you get 5 friends to do it then you can get a free ipod
too!

On another note, have any of you seen the new photo ipods??? tre
cool...


(excited, I have 4 out of 5 and only need one more person to sign up!)

The entire purpose of the HOSTS file is for user-specified static
domain name resolution, for their own purpose. The OS is **never**
supposed to overwrite it with their own version.

If the purpose of **your** HOSTS file is to block popups, that's
great. But that's not what it's designed for, and there are a lot of
users and admins who rely on the HOSTS file for static name
resolutions for their networks. Overwriting the HOSTS files (or adding
all kind of popup blocking domain names to them) will create a lot of
problems.

Altering the HOSTS file overrides the domain name resolution order.
It's not just for blocking popups, any TCP/IP connections to those
domain names will fail. Are you suggesting that Apple (or any OS
vendor) has the authority over IANA and the DNS infrastructure to
dictate your DNS lookups? That's a dangerous proposal, with mountains
of liabilities and security issues attached to it.

Some solutions should be implemented solely by the user because of
such liability issues.



> Apple is just doing this now?
> 

Safari's popup blocking works within the browser only, it doesn't
changes DNS resolution. Effective popup blocking within the browser is
fairly recent technology (Mozilla being the pioneer). Also remember
that browser-level popup blocker can blocks just about any popups
without prior knowledge of the legitmacy of the website and DNS name.
With HOSTS file popup blocking, you must know the DNS name you wish to
block first. It also won't work with IP # URLs.

In any case, broswer popups are HTTP and browser issues, and should be
addressed at that level, rather than at the DNS name resolution level.
Using the HOSTS file for popup blocking is a rather sledgehammer
approach.

FWIW, I'd never trust a single third-party (be it a commercial entity
or not) to maintain a blocklist of anything. It give them sweeping
censoring power to your desktop Marco, I'm surprise someone like you
aren't alrmed by the first amendment impliations of such automatic
updated blocking by a commercial entity.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Reason/Orkester CD question (nrr)

If u have the CD, just copy it. It's not copy protected.

If you allowed Reason to copy FSB and Ork to the hard drive during
installation, then it shuold rarely ask you for the CD at launch.
Reinstall with the "copy sound banks to HDD" option and it'll stop
asking you for the CDs every time (but it'll still ask for it from
time to time so keep your CDs around).

Subject: Re: [sfraves] nrr: Fwd: AUTOREPLY: handy-dandy spam white-list test request

Great idea, but how do you implement that if you don't control your
mail server you use? Import your whitelist into your mail client?
You'll still be downloading all the spam before your mail client spam
filter kicks in.

If you have too much spam in your inbox, then you need to....

1. filter it at the mail server level, ask your ISP to install
SpamAssassin or something
2. Stop giving out your email address to every website and mailing
list. Use a seperate email address for such things and keep your
private email address private (i.e. only give it out to real live
persons)
3. use a Bayesian spam filter on the desktop, they're trainable to
your personal email partterns.

Spam will never go away until mail sender header can be authenticated.
Demand your mail provider and ISP to implement DomainKeys/SPF.

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Music/computer stuff for sale

I'm trying to get rid of some stuff to make room for my home studio
consolidation. Make me a decent offer on something and I'll probably
take it. Feel free to forward this along to anyone you think might be
interested.

1) Rane MP-44 DJ Mixer - $1000 OBO
You know it. This is one of the finest club mixers ever created. Mine's
in near-mint condition and it's only been used twice. It's dusty from
being in storage for too long, and one of the ground thumbscrews is
missing (you can still ground 2 turntables on one line, or just order
the part from Rane). I have an SKB roto-molded rack to bundle with it if
you'd like it to be portable. The only reason I'm getting rid of it is
that I've been unable to find a decent way to mount it within my
existing setup; the connections are all on the back of the unit, so it
either needs to be rack-mounted or hung. 

2) JBL Eon (passive, pair) & QSC Amp - $500
These can either supplement an existing soundsystem as DJ monitors, or
serve as an indoor system for small spaces. I'm including a pair of
stands, but they've also got an angled edge so you can rest them on the
floor pointing upward. The QSC Amp is built like a tank. I don't have it
in front of me, but the model is an older equivalent of their new CX
line. I can go take a look at it in the attic if anyone's interested.
I'm also including two pairs of 1/4" to banana plug cables @ 20' and
50'. The whole bundle's well worth the price if you consider that the
cables themselves cost upwards of $50 apiece.

3) Roland JV-35 Synthesizer - $150 OBO
This was my first synth. I bought it in or around '95, and have since
taken great care of it. It's 5 octaves wide, 16x multitimbral and 28x
polyphonic. Inside it's got the classic Roland GS soundbank (including
the TR-606 drum patch), and you can expand its soundset with other
Roland modules. If you don't care for its synthesis, it still makes for
a great MIDI keyboard. The only drawback is that none of the sliders or
buttons is programmable. Comes with a folding stand and stretchy fabric
dust cover.

4) Novation ReMOTE 25 MIDI Controller - $225 OBO
This thing's got more MIDI-responsive controllers than you can shake a
stick at: 8 rotary potentiometers (absolute), 8 rotary encoders
(relative or "infinite"), 8 sliders, and 24 buttons arranged in sets of
8 underneath each of the controller groups. It also has 2 octaves of
semi-weighted keys, a mod/pitch joystick, and X-Y touchpad, both of
which can control 2 CCs simultaneously. This is also in mint condition;
it's less than a year old, and has seen little use in my studio since I
got the Evolution UC-33e.

5) Apple PowerMac G3 400 w/OS X 10.2 "Jaguar" - $400 OBO
This was my first Mac. I bought it around '99, and at the time it was
pretty pimp. Even now it runs OS X relatively quickly, and I was even
using it for music production until about 2 years ago. It's got 768MB or
RAM (2x256MB and 2x128MB DIMMs), a 10GB SCSI hard disk, 32x CD-ROM, and
two video cards: a 32MB ATI Radeon and 16MB ATI Rage 128. It's also got
a 100MB Zip Drive, an Apple Pro Keyboard (circa 2002--not the crappy one
that came with it), and a boxed, fully licensed copy of OS X. I've even
wiped the hard drive and prepped it for a fresh installation.

6) Hitachi 19" RasterOps monitor - $250 OBO
This thing is huge and heavy, but it sure looks great. It just takes up
way too much room in my office. It's in near-mint condition. Model
#MC7515.

7) AOC 17" Spectrum monitor - FREE!
Beat up old monitor, still works great though. I'm going to bring it to
the Salvation Army if nobody claims it. Model #7Glr.

Cheers,

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Totally OT: get a free ipod.... so easy!!

i dunno, given the premium I place on my time it strikes as being a
whole lot cheaper to skip this Ponzi scheme that's the modern day
version of putting lipstick on a pig and simply buy outright a decent
PDA for about $100 less, with flash memory expandable to about a gig.

Flash memory prices are dropping like a brick right now and all these
iPods, due to their built in obsolescence, (see: battery life, iPod),
are going to go the way of the dodo within two years.

Why shell out for something that does one thing fairly well, when for
the same money you can get the same feature, plus a raft of other
functionality?

Maybe all you want is a portable device that is "best in class" at playing
music, and you don't care about other functionality? There's no better
portable music player in its class than the iPod right now. BTW, rumor has
it that they'll announce a solid state (ie. compact flash memory) based
player in January...

Hmm.. You're comparing the battery life of iPods to.... um.... PDAs?

All the PDAs on the market now are color, at least $200 or so, and
they last for about 3-4 hours at best (you might get over 6 hrs for
listening to music if you keep the screen powered off). 1GB of flash
memory is another $70-100 (depends on what type).

I got my refurbished 15GB iPod for $199. Can't be happier. I have over
100 full-length mix CDs on it (plus 100s of 12 inches), from house to
breaks to trance to downtempo. The battery life could be better but
trust me, it last longer than my Tungsten T.

The iPod's interface is ingenius. You really have to own one to
appreciate it. The real strenth is that it integrates so perfectly
with iTunes. When you have 20-60GB of music on a portable player and
100s of GB of music your home computer, management is a real important
issue. The iTunes + iPod combo is light-years ahead of the
competition. They can copy the iPod's hardware, but none of the other
MP3 players on the market has the software to match.

Now if you don't plan on carrying that much music with you, then you
probably don't need an iPod. Just wait another year and you'll find
30% of all cell phone models have MP3 capability and flash memory slot
too.

But I really appreciate the fact that I don't have to remember copy
files to a card, or put the CDs I like in the bag, etc. When I need
music, I just pick up my iPod. All the music I want it hear is always
in it. All 200 hrs of it.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Reason/Orkester CD question (nrr)

On PC it may ask for that, but I've had 2.5 installed for over a year and 
not once has it requested the CD's. That would piss me off to no extent if I 
had to keep my CD's or some other lame ass dongle ware around...

Oh and Reason 3.0 comes out soon. Just got announced officially this week. 
Check out the site. The sequencer still is a POS and they really didn't add 
much. Blah.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Reason/Orkester CD question (nrr)

OMG, you guys are, like, totally openly discussing how to steal
software on a rave list!  That is, like, so totally grody!  I used to
be the world's biggest audio warezer, so I understand..  ..but when
something like Reason, that has all but *replaced* hardware for a lot
of people, is still sub-$500, just buy the fucker, if you have the
means.  

The more people that really support these companies, the faster they
can come out with more ill shit.  Last time I talked to a person @
Propellerhead, they told me they estimated the ratio of paying users to
warezers at 1:20.  They're still doing alright, but what if another 10%
of us ponied up?  Can you IMAGINE the amount of additional engineers/QA
folks that'd buy?  Call me crazy, but when a piece of (relatively)
cheap software turns my whole creative process on its head and
(ostensibly) changes my life, I save up and buy it.

Ahhh, fuck, I love you guys though- and if the cost of software had to
keep you from doing all the (really) cool shit you're doing, I'd rather
see you warez it than be stifled.  It's a tough question.

You're right, though, Ry- Reason 3.0 is nothing earth-shattering.  New
features are new features, but I'm not sure it really deserved a
big-buck upgrade cost and a full version number hike..  There were lots
of things people seemed to (very vocally) be waiting for more than
combis and crap.

As far as the seq being a POS.. I dunno..  It sure is easy and clear. 
I used to use it now and again when I'd tire of Logic or even PT's
relative complexity. 

Now Live 4's seq....  There is a fucking thing of beauty, if you ask
me.  Nothing but nothing can touch it, for the way I work.  I am so
damned addicted to L4 that I am constantly eyeing my home PC, dreaming
about having the time and $$$ to upgrade it to dual AMDs so I can
*really* do what I want.  It doesn't have the tweaky features at all
yet but the paradigm shift it created in my head has hardly even
settled in yet, it's so large.

Ableton pwns.  I want to move to Germany and work for them.

Blah music geek mode off,

Way to advance the discussion! Are you saying Propellerheads isn't a
"real" company, or even that it's possible to find hardware that does
everything Reason can for $400? I'm not really a fan of it myself
anymore (I'm a Live whore like George), but this attitude is just
retarded.

I know, I know... YHBT, HAND. Whatevs.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Reason/Orkester CD question (nrr)

I am LOVING Ableton Live 4. It reminds me of what I miss in Studio Vision. 
Clean, simple, powerfull. I've been having a lot of fun with Live and it's 
going to be a great tool. Once I learn it and like it. I'll pay for it. I've 
actually started paying for software for the same reasons. But I'm all about 
really testing things out before I plunk down cash.

*reason sux* That was intelligent. =P

FYI - most of us all have real hardware gear too. Reason is convenience and 
in the right hands can school the fuck out of a hardware setup. It's all 
about the user big guy!

Don't forget about academic pricing if you're a student... Here's a place
that sells Live 4.0 for $239, compared to $399 for full retail:

Nice contribution, thanks!  I just hate it when people bundle 1000's of
dollars worth of hardware into a small, cheap software package that makes
basic, powerful production techniques accessible to the masses.  Sorry,
massez.

Subject: [sfraves] Final lineup update : This Sat : Beatification of the Beat

** Lineup updated 12.2.04 **

We've added our final act to the lineup: the infamous Plateshifter, dark 
lord of the Overworld.  He's been laying low for the last few years blowing 
out his eardrums creating a crazy new techno sound that you definitely have 
not heard before.  He has sacrificed... for you!  You will think you are on 
another planet.  He is back and will be playing a late night set of his 
material, on big sound.  Definitely worth sticking around for.

Hope to see you saturday!

** Lineup updated 12.2.04 **

We've added our final act to the techno lineup: the infamous Plateshifter, 
dark lord of the 
Overworld.  He's been laying low for the last few years blowing out his 
eardrums creating a 
crazy new techno sound that you definitely have not heard before.  He has 
sacrificed... for 
you!  You will think you are on another planet.  He is back and will be 
playing a late night 
set of his material, on big sound.  Definitely worth sticking around for.

Hope to see you saturday!

Full BSP below...

"real companiez",  eh?  Where could I learn more about such
"companiez?"  In the Wiz-all Strizeet Jizournal?  Or maybe in
Biznizzle Weekly?  No, I got it - Fizortune Magazine!

And, yeah, there's a world of difference between an all-digital Roland
or Kurzweill synth and Reason software: Propellerheads doesn't buy the
same generic Intel hardware, wrap it in a fancy case with a nice
keyboard, and mark the price up 200%.  That's REAL, yo.

no, we ain't.  I was told by an ex(thank you god)co-worker that I ought not
to think about applying for developer jobs just yet (after getting back 
from film school)
as I had been in the QA department (developing automated QA systems, but
that's here nor there) for so long (uh, 2 years, after 10 years of 
developing satellite
control systems....  of course, back then, I was in development AND qa at 
the same time)

but of course, he was a hotshot, just out of Stanford maybe 5 years ago

damn punk...  I guess my BS in CpE and MS in CS meant nothing

HR people thought the same way - every unsolicited form letter e-mail was 
generally
for a QA position.  and I could hear recruiters' brains freeze when I said 
I was looking
more for a development oriented position.

gezus...  after 20 years of IT, it's all the same damn shit

course we're all wage slaves as well (re: the EA "coal mines").  Become a 
contractor -
at least you'll get paid for every hour you work

I am *this* close to becoming a commie

Well I've been accused of being such.  So I guess I'll help. ;)

* The Internationale (new version/rendition)

Listen to the most festive rendition of "The
Internationale" ever, played by a Japanese band Soul
Flower Mononoke Summit.

http://montages.blogspot.com/2004/11/internationale.html


BTW, in case you don't speak Japanese or haven't sung the original with 
friends, the lyrics in English:




The Internationale


Arise, ye prisoners of
starvation!
Arise, ye wretched of the earth!
For justice thunders condemnation,
A better world's in birth.
No more, tradition's chains shall bind us,
Arise ye slaves, no more in thrall.
The earth shall rise on new foundations,
We are not nothing; we are all.

'Tis the final conflict,
Let us stand in our place.
The international working class
Shall be the human race!
'Tis the final conflict,
Let us stand in our place.
The international working class
Shall be the human race!


SECOND VERSE


We'll have no condescending saviors
To rule us from a judgment hall.
We workers ask not for their favors,
We must consult for all.
To make the thief disgorge his booty,
To free the spirit from the cell,
We must ourselves decide our duty,
We must decide and do it well!

'This the final conflict,
Let us stand in our place!.
The international working class
Shall be the human race!
'Tis the final conflict,
Let us stand in our place.
The international working class
Shall be the human race!

House Music 101:  http://livingart.com/raving/articles/housemusic101.htm


"The government, which was designed for the people, has got into the hands 
of the bosses and their employers, the special interests.  An invisible 
empire has been set up above the forms of democracy."
-Woodrow Wilson

"There are times when you have to obey a call which is the highest of all, 
i.e. the voice of conscience even though such obedience may cost many a 
bitter tear, and even more, separation from friends, from family, from the 
state to which you may belong, from all that you have held as dear as life 
itself. For this obedience is the law of our being."
   Gandhi

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

Who said anything about stealing software?


CDs get lost and scratched. It's our right to back up software CDs.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Reason/Orkester CD question (nrr)

Reason is a great brainstorming tool, for anyone. Especially in a
collaborative project. You don't have to worry about your frineds have
all the right VST plugins instealled, or loading all right patches,
etc.

Reason for production does leave a lot to be desired. Crappy SEQ,
nothing enough parameters in their effects....

And I fucking hate having to REXify every loop I want to put in
Dr.REX, then map the triggers to the shitty SEQ. If I use the samplers
then I'll have to time-stretch it to the right tempo.

I mean, com'on, can I just play a str8 loop? How hard is that?

Subject: [sfraves] [nrr] hotmail peave of the day

now that they've upgraded from 2mb to 250mb, instead of having the last 50-100 sfraves emails spooled up in my bulk mail folder for 
perusal when i'm bored, i have hundreds and hundreds ! (and HUNDREDS !)  i subbed a gmail account to sfr and once the gee-wiz factor 
wore off, none of this threaded sheite can beat a hard size limited email address for list subscription.

gah, need to find some utility to auto-delete all this crap as it ages ;)

knowing hundreds of messages are automatically getting deleted without me reading them is grate !

Subject: [sfraves] Upcoming events/ISO amazing time.

--0-2024421240-1102096159=:95905
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

 I put my fate into the hands of this community. Where can one go to have an amazing time?
 
I go out but dont have too much experience going to raves. Not having a car is a barrier as well. have a car which has prevented from going to a few, and my friends arent really into going to raves.. There is "The Beatification of the Beat" this Saturday, but I dont have too many details about it. Im partial to Deep house, jungle, D&B rather than trance. Friday night at the DNA lounge is fun but thought I might try something different...

I live in the Penninsula so the nifty public transportation can get be as far as San Francisco, but east bay events might require a rideshare :) Oh and Im in my 20's so can go to 21+ events as that may be relevant. 
Sooooo..Anything fun going on in the future?

Beatification Of The BEat is gonna be dope - good techno, breaks, and I'm
not sure - but could be some D&B too...either way, the spot is tight and the
crews are solid, so it promises to be a good time. Sadly I'll miss most of
it as I have to work at 6am Sunday - blah.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Reason/Orkester CD question (nrr)



Ooo, my favorite subjects, hardware vs Software and warez!

A few things...

1.  Take a look at Spectrasonic's Stylus for good example of what
happens when people pay for software.  Stylus came on 6 CDs, so
it was nearly impossible to crack *and* get the sample data.  Now,
we have Stylus RMX, which is quite simply one of the best peices
of music software to hit the market.  And it is only a $99 dollar
upgrade for people who bougth the original Stylus.  www.spectrasonics.net

2.  Live 4.0 rocks.  Instead of fucking paying apple for a $300 upgrade
to go from Logic 6 to Logic 7, I bought Live.  Very nice.  Does not
replace Logic, but they work very good together.

3.  Hardware vs Software.  I still don't think softsynths can match
the sound quality of an Access Virus or Waldorf Q.  But even if
they could, the amount of processor overhead is huge.  Thats the
kind of thing that crashes laptops during live performances.  I
still think a good multitimberal hardware synth is a good investment.
Software can pump out MIDI data for eons and not crash, but as soon
as you drop in a few giant softsynth patches, start praying to god
your set does not blow up 1/2 way through right when the girls
are starting to get jiggy.

Yea - I work 4 10's (4 ten hour shifts) from Sunday thru Wednesday 6am (or
7am depending) to either 5 or 6pm. It's a bit harsh for Saturday night
partying - but all in all, the job is cool, the pay is good, and it beats a
typical 9 to 5....

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Upcoming events/ISO amazing time.

Oh man i remember those days.  Right in the hight of my partying days,
i was working 4x10's at Intel, and it was Sun-Wed 5am-1pm.  There were
so many times i would drive straight from the party to work.  A few
times they were parties in Seattle so it was a 3 hour drive from the
party back to work.  Thank god on Sunday's there was only one other
person in the office and he was a total stoner and spend the whole
morning asleep, so since i was
most certainly awake those days i'd cover for him, and to pay me back
mon-wed. he'd cover my ass so i could come in 3 hours late everyday
and show up at 8am, since i was a big tweaker back then those few
hours come in very handy.  The most intense time i had was this one
time i was at a club, and i took a couple of pills, and around 1am or
so, this dude comes around with a half sheet of gel tabs, that i
picked up off him and took a few for myself, not caring that i had to
be at work in 2 hours.  4am rolls around and i was most certainly on
my way up a very intense peak.  Got my ass to work just in time for
everything to seriously start melting.  i spent the entire morning
listening to house music and staring at my desktop, which at the time
had a picture of Jim Morrison on it and he would sing every sample in
every track.  Very intense...i so cant do that anymore.  Ahhhh the
good ol reckless days back when i was invincible and had no cares in
the world.

i can so see that happening with you, tail-piper.

i'd recount my party days when i went to work at 6am on a
sunday, straight from partying all night (still in my raver
gear, no less) but i think some people from my current work
have figured out that i post to this list and read my emails.

then again, one of them was a pretty big partyer herself, so i
probably shouldn't worry...

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Upcoming events/ISO amazing time.

Yeah I was, why do you ask?  HAHAHAHAHA just kiddin.  Naw i was
working on this new product they were trying to roll out called Intel
AnswerExpress.  Some cheezy little program that users could install
and if they ever had a problem with their computer they could run this
lil app and it would pull all the information from the computer and
email it back to us and it was basically like a tech support ticketing
system, but availible to the end-user.  I was on the QA team as well
as team lead of the help desk.  It wasn't too bad since we only really
had less than 1000 customers at that time, so there was a lot of
downtime, and sitting around doing nothing.  I wonder what ever
happened with that product, i havent heard anything about it since i
left Intel.  I guess it got scrapped cause they're page isnt up
anymore.  It was a stupid program to start with.  I guess it was a
good idea, but in all reality it was just a stupid program.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] nrr- a question (was: Upcoming events/ISO amazing time.)

Hmmmm meth monsters are hard to explain cause they're differant for
everyone really.  But bascially they're hallucinations induces by
sleep deprivation.  I used to do like 2 or 3 day stretchs and never
saw anything.  I think it was on one of my first 5 day runs that i
started to notice the "meth monsters".  When i first noticed it, i was
sitting at work (Intel) and i was looking across the office and it
looked like all the cube were on fire.  i didnt really see flames, but
you know when you look above a fire you see the heat waves, that's
what i was seeing, everything was kinda swishing back n forth.  I also
felt the "spiders" crawling under my skin, it wasnt too intense, it
would just be a few waves of a weird tinggling sensation under my
skin.  That was the first time i noticed it, each time after that it
got more intense and crazy.  There would be times i would hear my name
being called out, or phones ringing that weren't really ringing.  I
also noticed most of the time i would see people walking across the
street that weren't there, and the funny thing was it was all people
from circa 1890 or some shit, there would be people on horse and
buggy's crossing the street and women with umbrella's and the big ol
dresses and shit (my friend phatty would also have the same sort of
hallucinations).  i'd see people ducking behind garbage cans, or
crawling out of garbage cans.  One time i was staring at a sunset and
i saw this hand come stretching out from the sun and it reached out
and touched my nose.  There would be random little creatures scurring
from shadow to shadow.  One time i was driving my girlfriend home, and
i had been up for about 5 or 6 days, and it was like 4am, and i was
driving along and all of the sudden i almost slammed into the back of
a semi, so i punched my brakes and came screaching to a halt hoping to
stop in time, and once i stopped i looked around and there wasnt
anything near me for miles, i was on some rural road and there was a
McDonald's cup rolling around in the middle of the road.  I had a 5
year "addiction" to meth, so i've seen lots of crazy "meth monsters". 
That's why the freaks and addicts you come across are all twitchy and
shit, lack of sleep does horrible things to your brain, you're brain
needs to turn off occasionally to reset itself, other wise your brain
is constantly absording inputs and it gets overloaded and starts to
freak out, hence the seeing and hearing things...I spent a lot of time
trying to break it down and figure out the why's and what's and all
that.  Thats my own personal theory.

Subject: [sfraves] Thought for Today:  If a dog was the teacher

--=====================_1509140==.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed


If a dog was the teacher

If a dog was the teacher you would learn stuff like:

When loved ones come home, always run to greet them.

Never pass up the opportunity to go for a joyride.

Allow the experience of fresh air and the wind in your face to be pure
ecstasy.

When it's in your best interest, practice obedience.

Let others know when they've invaded your territory.

Take naps.

Stretch before rising.

Run, romp, and play daily.

Thrive on attention and let people touch you.

Avoid biting when a simple growl will do.

On warm days, stop to lie on your back on the grass.

On hot days, drink lots of water and lie under a shady tree.

When you're happy, dance around and wag your entire body.

No matter how often you're scolded, don't buy into the guilt thing and
pout...run right back and make friends.

Delight in the simple joy of a long walk

Eat with gusto and enthusiasm. Stop when you have had enough.

Be loyal. Never pretend to be something you're not.

If what you want lies buried, dig until you find it.

When someone is having a bad day, be silent, sit close by and nuzzle
them gently.

How it that a logical arguement? The fact that it comes on 6CDs is not
proof that it's unw4r3zable. (I can give you the torrent/ed2k links as
counter-proof  ^_^). The fact (or, more acuratly, "your opinion") that
it's good software doesn't mean it's a direct result of good sales.

Not to discount that Stylus (and Trilogy and Atmosphere) are excellent
soft synths. But that's doesn't really have anything to do with "what
happens when people pay for software".

$300 for an upgrade? That's ridiculous. I love Apple, but they really

I hate it when people compare hardware and software today as if
there's any significant differences under the hood. Modern hardware
synth (like Access Virus or Waldorf Q you mentioned) are all
DSP-based. They're really proprietary software synth running on
dedicated DSP hardware in a keyboard form-factor. The same prorietary
DSP software can be port to virtually any platfrom if they choose to.
There's even a Virus plugin for Lexicon PowerCore.

If you port the the Virus or the Q to a PC or Mac, they should sound
virtually the same, because the only thing different is the CPU, which
isn't going to affect the audio fidelity (well, unless your playing it
out of a Sound Blaster).

A G4/G5 or a P4 is orders of magnitude more powerful in DSP processing
than any dedicated DSP today (thanks to SIME vector instructions like
MMX and Altivec).

Reliabilty is very much the hallmark of hardware synths, but that's
because they do 1 thing and do 1 thing well. A computer is always
running a complete OS underneath (plus all your plugins). If you strip
down the OS to a minimum and run just a single program, it'll be
equally reliable. FinalScratch on the PC is a good example (because it
runs on Linux, you can install a dedicated Linux environment solely
for running FinalScratch and nothing else). Likewise, it's common
practice to install a bare OS for running nothing but Ableton Live for
performances, for stability reasons. And in these scenarios, the
computers are not very different from dedicated hardware.

The line b/w hardware and software setup is constantly blurring. You
see hardware that suppoort plugins, or has a complete GUI (like the
high-end Roland HDD multitrackers), and you'll see software that
requires dedicated hardware (like PowerCore and ProTools) or have a
closed environment (like Reason). I might even expect some software in
the future to come with its own OS (like a stripped down Linux) and
take control of your entire computer.

Lucky you. I usually start seeing shit after 16-20 hrs.First time was
when I was trying to sleep and aliens were coming out of the X-Files
poster in my bedroom.

I feel/see/hear those things all the time (when I'm not high). It
worries me. I'm not paranoid about them but it gets annoying.

"Occasionally" means once or twice a week?  ROTFL

Actually I never stay up more than 36 hrs. And my longest (and only)
ongoing meth abuse was like every weekend for 3 months.

just a suggestion, but maybe it might be more beneficial if the
calendar went out on thursday or early friday morning?  by

MOSH VIDEO RE-EDITED

EMINEM





The video for EMINEM's political song MOSH has been re-edited to give it a 
fresh message following GEORGE W BUSH's Presidential election victory over 
JOHN KERRY.

The original cut of the video ended with a shot of an animated Eminem 
leading a mob to register to vote, but this has been changed now the 
election has taken place.

The video's director, IAN INABA, says, "When MTV saw it, the top brass 
there decided to put it on heavy rotation and make it the number one video 
on that week. But because (the video) had so much popularity, we had to 
figure out how to keep it going seeing that the voting thing didn't work 
out so well."

INTERSCOPE, Eminem's record label, agreed to pay for a new 50-second ending 
which now features the same mob storming the Capitol during Bush's State Of 
The Union address. This leads to a shot of DICK CHENEY suffering a heart 
attack.

Inaba admits, "There was some back-and-forth with management over whether 
this was too strong."

Granny Has Left The Dancefloor
to join DJ Goddess in the IAMbient Room
An obituary for Rosy Rofe
by your roving ACCESS-ALL-LEVELS reporter Fraser Clark

Former Queen of Clubs and "Dancing Granny" to Britain's Rave Generation, 
died, aged, 80, on Monday 22nd(she never much cared for Mondays :)

"I'll ask the DJ to turn the music way down low (some hope, huh?)
And you can tell your friends there with you she had to go"

During the course of writing and researching this obit, I have been 
presented with the idea that Rosy should be deified by the neo-pagan 
community, and that her charity Peacebuilders Trust should be revived.

Quite simply, Rosy Rofe was one of the highest points of light in the early 
days of underground Rave Culture, back when damn near everybody thought it 
was just about music and would be a passing fad.  Just to see her dancing 
away in that endless effortless Alexander-style of hers, a smile of pure 
physical pleasure across her face, used to hit you as a reassurance that 
what we were all doing WAS about more than music & fashion  at least it was 
also about dancing and non-ageism!

Certainly, from Megatripolis onwards, I could/would never have dreamed of 
putting on any club without her as my Hostess.  She seemed to know 
everyone, and even more knew her.  She was unquestionably a secure landmark 
and an oasis of care for many many young clubbers dancing their first steps 
beyond the Designated Motorway.  (I remember someone telling me during the 
Zippy Tour that I didn't need to DO anything any more, I just had to exist 
in order to show young people it is possible.)

Nor have I met many people who lived more in the moment than Rosy, even to 
the point where she would pop just about anything empatheogenic just like 
that, and even to the extent that she found it hard to be home, 
alone.  That must have been hard, I'm glad I was never like that, I 
positively craved some time alone during that era.

Rosy was born Dorothy Leckstein, on May 24th, 1924, slap in the middle of 
the Roaring '20s, Destiny clearly never intending her to go through life 
quietly.  The Rofe part of her name came from her husband Hussein Rofe, 
head assistant to Bapak, the spiritual leader of the Subud religion which 
swept Europe through the Psychedelic '60s.  The Rosy part (Rosanna) was 
given her by Bapak, her guru.

Though she was a great beauty, sketched by Augustus John, photographed by 
Cecil Beaton, and wined, dined and bedded across Europe, she had a very 
serious thirst for knowledge.  In her twenties, she studied the Alexander 
Technique under (I use the word advisedly) the old teacher himself, Mathias 
Alexander.  This was to give her the infinite energy that, much later in 
her life, would allow her, always, to be the only person still dancing at 
the end of the after-after-after party.

Very lucid as regards World Peace, hands-on community and all the issues of 
the day (she'd been a White Witch at one stage, and was even a member of 
their union!) she would sometimes just beam silently at you in 
clubland.  People had different ideas what was going on but the truth is 
she tripped out a lot (a taste for LSD had followed her from the '60s and 
caught up with her in the '90s) and she often told me she was actually 
watching fairies and elves climbing and playing and posing all over people 
as they talked to her :)

Subud might have been her deepest influence.  Certainly its Latehans 
(sessions where you were supposed to let it all hang out, to put it too 
crudely) encouraged her ability to let the Larger Force express Itself 
through her.

Her association with the roses that she used to make and give away or sell 
to cover her running expenses, began when Lindsay Kemp commissioned her to 
create a thousand red roses (or more?) for a staging he mounted of Genet's 
"Our Lady of the Flowers".

The fact that Rosy was born of a Russian father and a Polish mother who 
came from a long line of milliners and dyers certainly explains her love of 
dressing up and her love of colour.  It was in the DNA!  Indeed, one member 
of the family I interviewed for this obit described the family as all 
having "a great love of colour".

During the Sixties, of course, she lived a very wild life, which included 
alleged trysts with Keith Richards, John Bennett (Gurdjieff) and others too 
nefarious to mention.  For one period of her life she and Eva Bartok shared 
a Buckminster Fuller dome!  Certainly she hung out with the likes of Angie 
Bowie, and the gang around her.  She always claimed she conceived the Body 
Mind & Spirit Festival, only to have it stolen from under her by Graham 
Wilson and other hard businessmen.   If Bugsy is listening, I'm here to say 
it happens.


In the immediate aftermath of a death, I've noticed, we initially make the 
mistake of seeing the old person, the latest form which has just passed 
away.  It takes some weeks before the overall person, in its most developed 
visual form, takes its place.  I think we also vastly underestimate how 
people 'die,' move on, piece by piece, the moment of death being when the 
last piece moves on too.  At least for their last year, a person is half 
not here, that's either half the time here and half the time there or all 
the time half here half gone.  Thus, their appearance and 'living 
conditions', to which we give such insane importance, are pretty immaterial 
to those who're already and increasingly 'moved on' to another world where 
this one's but a passed dream.

In Rosy's case the talk has been of her last year when her daughter Astrid 
persuaded her up to the cold unknown depths of Carlisle and, with Rosy's 
half-agreement, discouraged all contacts from her former friends.  Just 
your old Bourgeois-Hippy divide that still splits many families, but 
classically from Rosy's generation (think Absolutely Fabulous and you're 
there)   Maybe it was hard for Rosy, maybe many things, but the point to 
bear in mind is that it doesn't matter to her now and would only have 
really mattered to half of her then :)  She was already more than half gone 
when she went North, I can vouch for that.  Whenever I hung out with her 
during the previous year she was deteriorating fairly rapidly.

I'd always get her well stoned on my visits, and then insist that she tell 
God(ess), when she got there ("it doesn't matter when, Rosy!"), how good I 
was at putting on parties ("cos they love parties up there, you know that, 
girl!") and to make sure SHe put me on the Guest List.   At first she used 
to look at me strangely, she was afraid of death and always loved the 
bright social lights.  But my insistence and playful repetition got through 
on quite a deep level, or so I felt.   She'd recognise she'd heard this 
gibberish before, but not exactly where (was it on one of Heaven's flyers?) 
and it started to crystallise in her a more optimistic picture of where she 
might be heading.  I hope so anyway  certainly she used to laugh fondly at 
it by the time she headed North.

At least get me on the½ Price Guest List, Rosy!

"Sometime in your life, hope that you might see one starved man, the look 
on his face when the bread finally arrives.  Hope that you might have 
bought it or baked it or even kneaded it yourself.  For that look on his 
face, for your meeting his eyes across a piece of bread, you might be 
willing to lose a lot, or suffer a lot, or die a little, even."
-Daniel Berrigan

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."

Subject: [sfraves] Free License for Mackie Tracktion for PC/Mac

Mackie is giving away free license for Tracktion, their MIDI/adio
software sequencer (like Cubase). It's actually a very nice piece of
software, supports VST plugins, Ogg audio tracks, Rewire 2.0 for
integration with Reason, and a whole lot of other things. It's
resource-friendlier and easier to use than Cubase (though obviously
not as powerful).

Not sure how long the promotion's gonna last, so tell your friends.

- Jeff

Subject: [sfraves] TELIC WAS DOPE!  And There Was Rave

OK... so like each time I've went 2 TELIC 4 an event.. something better
always happens that makes it better than the last TELIC Rave I went 2..
well.. IMO anyway... I do gotta say, Thank God that whack ass Security is
gone & there were only Groovy Cool Security working there!!

OK... so like it was Dope!  I mean... this was mainly a Trance party w/
all the DJs on the line up & yeah... it was kinda high on the foo foo
anthem metter.. LoL.. but it was... ya know.. when in Rome!

I did dance alot.. there were alota Groovy sets!!  But honestly... my
Homie Durty who broke it down w/ w. this like high energy trance that was
hella pumpin.. I was so diggin' it!  I mean.. he even mixed in some of his
own produced tracks & it was just sick!!! Ummmm... I wish i had a website
2 direct y'all 2.. well... http://www.tiggerlovesyou.com/atwr/IMG_6976.jpg
 that's Durty knob tweakin'!!!

DJ D & Aleks played this I guess like hard house/ NRG set!!  It was fun!
There was 1 DJ there who spun like 70's & 80's music.. that was fun! Oh Oh
Oh.. then there was this DJ who spun Electro!! I was sooooooooooo mondo
diggin' on that!!  Hell Yeah!

Oh yeah.. Cops came 2 try 2 shut down the party 'cause some well.. ok..
this is what I heard.. some Dude  who got kicked out called the cops &
tried 2 get the TELIC busted... Oh well.. it didn't work... after brief
chats w/ the venue owners, the cops left & literally said, "Let you party
go on as long as you want!"  Hello 2day!!  LoL  So that was kinda
intersting... Oh yeah.. i heard there was also a FIRE on 1 of the cars,
nothing like exploded from waht i was told, just alot burned plastic I
think???

Ummmmmm... oh ohoh.. so like after the last official set on the line up
ended.. i dunno who was spinning.. Wavelengh???  Anywaze... Dragnfly pops
up & spins this like hella dark proggy trance set!!  YUM!!!  I mean.. no
offense 2 like all the DJs who spun, but Dfly's set was Dark & Yummy, the
way I Like my trance!!!  Then Reclipse hops on & play this Yummy Jungle!! 
YAY!!

So yeah.. the decorations were mainly banners on the wall, this multicolor
lazer thingie, oh ohoh.. there was a balloon drop... actually 2!  LoL  The
Vibe was Groovy!!  LoL.. Hello 2day.. soooooooooo many people were there
that well.. I mean.. ok.. yeah.. I admit I have went 2 more candy raves
this past year than I like ever have, but yeah... LoL.. so like it's just
fun seein' every1 & all that!!  I'd say peak point of the shindig when I
was there was like maybe 400 people more or less....  LoL.. but yeah man..
so much fun!!!  I maean.. it's hella fun getting 2 know the kids from
BayRaves!!  LoL

OH yeah.. I dunno ifi mentioned I went there w/ my HOmie Nate

Subject: [sfraves] The Adventures home of Dragnfly & Osby! OsbyFly Adventures!!! =)

OK.. so after like sayin' our mondo goodbyes 2 every1 @ TELIC... we
leave... then we got to the gas station 'cause Dfly needed fuel 4 the new
wheels she's had 4 over a year now.. I LIke =)  A few heads from TELIC
popped up & we chatted while Dfly struggled to pump her gas...  YAY


So the TELIC kids left & were like hella struggling w/ the pump still...
OK.. then this like LIMO pulls up & ya know.. bein' butt fuckin' tired..
we didn't really care.. actually.. we were kinda laughin' as it pulled in
the gas stAtion... they park next to a pump & well.. this Asain man comes
out & starts talkin in Chinese I guess.. & I heard him say like b¨¡ f¨¡ng,
berkeley, and Target.

OK.. so here's what trip me out.. Dfly responded, "b¨¤o qi¨¤n, w¨¯ b¨²
hu¨¬ shu¨­ zh¨­ng gu¨® hu¨¤ " which she told me meant "Sorry, I do now
know how to speak Chinese"or soemthing like that..

The man got pissed off or soemthing then yelled @ Dfly, "Diu lei lo mo k
ta fa hai"

Then Dfly like yelled back @ him, "Ding Lei go fai!!!!"

The man yelled back, "Au wui waht lei dui an chut lei yuen hau bai ju hai
lei go see fut dau, sau yi lnei hau yi geen do au teck do lei go see fut
biu C!"

Then like Dina yelled back, "Nei doe chi lun sin ga. Fan ook kay diu chut
lei lo mo gor chow hai yeen hau lye gon jeng nei lo mo gor see fut loong
la", & like luckily finished pumping her gas & we hella got back in the
car hella quick 'cause I dunno... hella heated man!

The Asain man hella got back in his Limo & i saw him say something 2 his
driver... so as soon as we pulled out of the gas station & like go to the
freeway... next thing we knew... the limo was right behind us...

"Dina, Girl,i thought U didn't speak Chinese?" I asked her.

"I don't Oz, " she said.  "I speak Cantonese!"

"What the hell did u say to him that pissed him off?  Oh ohoh.. & when the
hella did U start speakin' Cantonesse???"

""Dude, you don't wanna know...see .. I worked part time for the American
Embassy in China as a side gig when i 1st started DJing & I had to learn &
speak Cantonese... this was years ago, but I still remember alota bad
phrases & stuff"

"Oh, OK" I said in amazement.

Anywaze, so like were' drivin' up the freeway, zoomed through that fly
thingie that goes to 80, then we got to 80. But man.. the limo was still
behind us!!  As soon as we were able to, we took an exit, made so many
turns to lose the limo, then somehow ended up by the old Bayer Factory in
Berkeley!  Hello 2Day, there was a broken down bus right there with what
looked like well... weird lookin' people and animals!  Weird!  So Dfly
parked her car by the busto try to camaflauge (sp) he car with the
commotion goin' on!  It kinda worked I guess 'cause we saw the limo like
drive by the cross street from where we were at.

So like I saw this midget like carrying a lama & I dunno.. I was sooooo
confuses!  But I asked the midget what was goin on.  He said that they're
the side show attractions to the Circus across the freeway from where they
were @... they took a wrong turn & when they tried to make a u-turn in the
area... the bus broke down... so now they were kinda stuck.  They have to
somehow get themselves & all they animals to the Circus ground in 2 hours
when the gates open!  LUckily I remembered about this outdoor underground
that happened not too liong ago & this was the exact spot we had to like
park cars, then walk to the kinda new still walking bridge to get to the
otherside..

I told all the other midgets, the lady with a beard, the manticore horse
man dude, the fat lady twins connected by their waist, and the paper thin
man where t go.  Since Dfly & I were not in the mood 2 get shot by some
crazy Chinese Mafia man... we helped!  All of us basically had to
transport all the animals to the Circus grounds!  The midgets carried the
cages of chickens, the fat lady twins carried the 3 lamas and put the 4
moneys on their backs, Dfly pushed the tank w/ the mermaid in it... I
pulled the baby elephant on a leash while holding 2 ducks in my arm.

We all trecked across the wallking Bridge to the other side of the freeway
where Frontage road is... then we walked like a quarter of a mile to the
Circus Grounds and placed everything where it needed to be!  The
ringleader saw me & Dfly helping & wondered who we were told him what
happened and he ofered us some food and asked if we wanted to be in
theCircus for a day!!  I was like Hell Yeah!!!  Dfly was all like, Well I
dunno... after 95 when I left Cirque Desoile in 96, I swore I was never
gonna be in the Circus again!"

Well, I convinced Dfly that this was for our own protection so we have to
do this!  She agreed & asked to do Trapeeze acts sinnce that's what she
was @ Cirque... turns out she tourned w/ Cirque & did alota acrobatic work
with them....  So when the show started, I got on a motorcycle and had to
ride it acroos the circus tent while it was on Fire!.. Hello 2day... well
it was fun!! Then I learned how to jump from it &jump on a trampaline
while i'm still on fire, then land in a pool of water.. it was fun!! 
Shortly after I did that.. the trapeeze artists were slowly descended from
the top of the circus tent roof thingie on their swings... then dfly
started swinging back & forth on her swing then did this tumble thingie in
the air toward the other dude on the opposite swing across from her &
grabbed his hands!  It was Dope!!!  There was like 6 of them doin' tricks
4 like 15 mintues I guess...

The Groovy thing that me & dfly were allowed to do was this really Awesome
Exit... she jumped down from the swing into the net... then from the net,
she jumped on the back of the fire motorcycle I was driving (but it wasn't
lit up now), then we drove out of the Circus!!!  LoL.. hella people
started cheering.. actually.. we had to Circle the whole tent like once,
then we drove out!  We kinda just back tracked back to where the car was
parked by the Bayer Building.. LoL.. it was kinda fun & scary 'cause that
walking bridge over 80 was kinda freak.. it wasn't that wide 4 the whole
bike so I popped a wheelie the whole time we wre on there...

So we got back to where the car was by the broken down bus...  on the hood
of Dfly's car... someone scrathed in "THIS ISN"T OVER YET BITCH! I"LL FIND
YOU!"  OK.. so like if that was written by the Chinese dude, when the hell
did he learn how 2 speak english that quick?  Hello 2day!!

So yeah.. the rest of the ride home was pretty much in silence, well, I
kinda noticed how D was still wearin' her leatard thingie from the Circus
& couldn't stop laughing @ 1 point!!  LoL... <3 U

But yeah... that's what happen this time!!!  Oh, if anyone wants free
tickets to the Circus.. oh shit.. Dina.. I left my tickets in your car!! 
When will I see U again Sweetie???

Oh... The End!!  Crazy, huh?  LoL

Take Care <3

Was the "Pierced Raver" one of the side shows at the circus too?  I would 
have gone to see that.  Oh, and by the way, that chinese guy, well...uh that 
is my new boyfriends Osby, and I am never talking to you again.
:P
Love you!

For me, the hardware/software split comes not when comparing current
software with current ROMpler/digital synths, but with analogue gear
and older, more characterful digital stuff.  I got rid of all of my
expendable digital stuff years ago when I felt the sea change to soft
synths had made them obsolete.  What I kept was things like my 12-bit
(grungy) sampler that has analogue filters, analogue synths, my rhodes,
etc.

Not only are these archaic devices fun as hell to play, there just are
not servicable software replacements for them (yet).  Emulations, fair
stabs at them, sure- but nobody's gonna model a Rhodes that is subtlely
broken in a precious way like mine is.  Even when computer power feels
intimate and the modelling is so good that these things *could* be
emulated, who's going to make a virtual Pianet, or model my FAT
FreeBass?  Nobody, because not many people care about these magical
objects.  That, and user interface contributes in a big way to the
sounds and ideas that these objects inspire- either by the way they
play, look, feel, or even smell :)

When LinPlug makes a virtual ESQ-1, I'll feel like somebody out there
is listening (and is, perhaps, hitting the crackpipe a little too hard
;).

True- the Virus algorithm has been out for Pro Tools TDM for years, as
the synth and the DSP cards share the same DSP chips, and that's
apparently the same story for the Powercore.  What you still don't have
at that point is a controller with the correct labelling, that was
purpose-built for that synth and it's particular workflow.

That's not to say that I'd buy a Virus HW keyboard these days, having
the plugin, but there's something to it.

A nice step in that sort of direction, though from another angle, is
what Evolution's done with their UC-33 controller.  It's long had
overlays for programs like Live, Logic, etc which have clear labels
(and more importantly, presets to match) showing you what each knob and
button is mapped to.  Now they've updated the firmware with presets for
all of the Reason instruments, and made overlays available for each. 
So you're editing a Subtractor part, throw on that overlay and switch
presets, and BANGO, there are all the params neatly set up and labelled
for you.  Next you want to tweak a Maelstrom all to hell, switch,
swoop, BLADOW, you're there.

That's my kinda thinking.  If only it were metal, had motorized faders,
and buttons on each track.  Prob is, it'd cost a grand then.

Now, for folks that grew up with software instruments and have no soft
spot for (and, admittedly, little experience with) the classic or wierd
old stuff of the past, there's not much reason for them to get into it.
 Expensive, cantankerous, heavy, and often difficult to interface, they
can seem like an anachronism.  Once you hear them, work with them, get
your mind subtlely sheared into bits by them, though, they can have the
addictive qualities of the aforementioned crack.

Then again, I get my mind sheared to bits regularly by modern
softsynths, too- just in a different manner.  I'd be sad to be stuck
with either world.

I hope you're not mocking this guy, you could stand to learn a lot
from him.  Maybe he can help you with those DJ'ing skills you so

to cover up your mistakes.

	I think someone on this list claimed not too long ago that =

are undertaxed compared to people in other countries. Personally I=20
think the idea that you can be "undertaxed" is ridiculous -- it's like=20=

saying you're "under-robbed" or "underenslaved." But if that remains a=20=

matter of dispute, the following article should at least be instructive=20=

in showing that American corporations face a tax rate higher than that=20=

applied to competitors in most other countries.

	Of course it will be claimed that many companies don't actually =
pay=20
anything like the full tax rate, because they apply for various tax=20
credits, choose to incorporate in low-tax states, and so on. This is=20
true, however it is also true that the various steps taken to avoid=20
higher tax bills involve a lot of time, money, effort, and decisions=20
made that would otherwise be economically unjustifiable. These things=20
also amount to a significant burden on U.S. companies. And don't forget=20=

that the corporate tax is a form of double taxation, because even after=20=

a company pays tax on its profits, individual employees, shareholders,=20=

etc., still have to pay tax again on their portions of those profits.

U.S. Lags Behind Rest of World in Corporate Tax Reform
Author: Chris Edwards
Published: The Heartland Institute=A012/01/2004


Although many nations that compete economically with the United States=20=

have implemented important reforms in recent years to reduce corporate=20=

tax burdens, Congress, President George W. Bush, and Democratic=20
standard-bearer Sen. John Kerry have failed to put forth proposals for=20=

similar reforms here.

Today the U.S. has the second-highest corporate tax rate in the=20
30-nation Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).=20=

The U.S. corporate rate is 40 percent, including the 35 percent federal=20=

rate and the average state rate.

By contrast, Figure 1 (=20
http://www.heartland.org/apps/images/imgPics/BTNchartp19.3.gif ) shows=20=

the average rate in Asia, Europe, and Latin America is 30 percent or=20
less. The figure is based on data for countries listed in Table 1 (=20
http://www.heartland.org/apps/images/imgPics/BTNchartp19.2.gif ). The=20
average corporate tax rate in the OECD fell from 37.6 percent in 1996=20
to just 30.0 percent in 2004.


Since the late 1990s, many Eastern European countries have sharply=20
slashed their tax rates to attract investment. For instance:

Poland cut its tax rate from 40 to 19 percent;

Slovakia cut its rate from 29 to 19 percent;

The Czech Republic cut its rate from 39 to 28 percent;

Hungary cut its rate from 33.3 to 16 percent; and

Russia cut its rate from 35 to 24 percent.

In August, Greece announced it will cut its corporate rate from 35 to=20
25 percent, and the Netherlands announced it will cut its rate from=20
34.5 to 30 percent.


Election Failed to Address Issue Squarely

Before the November 2 general election, Bush promised to consider tax=20
reform if he won re-election, but he did not reveal a plan for the=20
corporate tax. He is allowing to expire a pro-growth tax provision that=20=

allows firms to deduct, or "expense," half the cost of qualified=20
capital investments.

Bush's challenger for president, Sen. John Kerry (D-MA), addressed the=20=

tax rules on foreign investment during the campaign, noting in speeches=20=

and campaign literature that the rules are "almost completely broken"=20
and acknowledging that other nations have corporate taxes that average=20=

one-third lower than those of the U.S.

Kerry's solutions, however, probably would have done more harm than=20
good, as a closer look suggests.


Damaging Corporate Tax Plan

The Kerry plan would have cut the U.S. corporate tax rate of 35 percent=20=

by 1.75 percentage points. To fund that small cut, however, Kerry=20
proposed to increase taxes on foreign subsidiaries of U.S. firms. Under=20=

current rules, the regular business profits of subsidiaries are not=20
taxed until repatriated to the United States.

For example, most of the 30 nations in the OECD, of which the United=20
States is a member, have "territorial" tax systems that generally do=20
not tax foreign business profits at all. The Kerry plan would have=20
broken from those norms by immediately taxing subsidiaries of U.S.=20
firms on their sales to other countries.

For example, a U.S. electronics firm selling goods from its Taiwanese=20
subsidiary to consumers in Japan would have faced a new U.S. tax=20
burden, and a relatively punitive one.

If Kerry's rules were to be enacted, U.S. companies would lose market=20

And despite this tremendous barrier to success, American corporations
make TONS more money than companies in any other country. Over the last
decade, the S&P 500 has averaged earnings growth of 13.5%, more than
double GDP. Boo-hoo, those poor overpaid executives, rich boardmembers
and fat-cat stockholders. Good thing we've got thinktanks funded by
(guess who?) US corporations to unmask these horrible attrocities!

	That sounds a lot like "America -- love it or leave it!" You obviously 
dislike corporations. Are you going to stop using their products? For 
me the issue is not that I don't like paying taxes personally, although 
I don't -- it's that I know taxation is hurting people. I would gladly 
pay more taxes myself in exchange for having tax rates on people in 
general lowered.

	I happen to agree that most executives and board members are overpaid. 
But taxing corporations does nothing to solve this problem. 
Shareholders are *not* "overpaid." They are not "paid" at all; how much 
money they make is a market function, not a management decision as in 
the case of executive pay. Anyone can buy stock. It's not some kind of 
elitist club. As of 2002, 49.5% of Americans owned stock (see 
http://www.sptimes.com/2002/09/27/Business/More_Americans_invest.shtml 
), roughly the same as the percentage of voters who voted for John 
Kerry a few weeks ago. Many more working people who do not own stock 
directly are indirect shareholders through pension funds. These 
millions of people benefit when corporate stock values increase, and 
are hurt when those companies lose money. Even people who own no stock 
directly or indirectly are affected by the economic health of the 
business world. Remember it was the stock market crash in 1929 that 
brought on the Great Depression.

	There are certainly valid questions about whether corporations should 
exist as legal entities, have limited liability, and be treated as 
persons under the law. Not to mention the problem of government 
subsidizing and favoring particular companies. But that is primarily a 
failure of government, not a failure of corporations. After all, it is 
government that sets the rules. Are corporations to blame for accepting 
handouts, or seeking to influence the political process in accord with 
their own economic benefit? To some degree yes, but then unions, 
nonprofits, and all kinds of other special interests are similarly 
guilty of lobbying for favors and trying to get the rules shaped to 
their own benefit. The root problem is that government has acquired so 
much money and power that it attracts all kinds of people and groups 
seeking financial and political gain at the expense of the taxpayers.

	Again, however, a high corporate tax rate does nothing whatsoever to 
address this problem. Not only does it do nothing, but as explained 
above, it amounts to yet another ripoff of the taxpayers. And the 
higher the tax, the greater the economic pain, not just on executives 
or the roughly half of Americans who own stock, but on society as a 
whole. Who suffered most during the Depression? It wasn't the wealthy.

Peace, love & liberty,
					<<< Starchild >>>

Subject: [sfraves] NRR  Vegitarian restaurant?

I have a friend and his wife, who are vegetarian.  I am taking him and his
wife out to dinner for his Birthday in the City.

I don't know any excellent restaurants that are high end vegetarian places,
although most places have good vegetarian food.

Any suggestions for a great vegetarian place to eat in the city?

You can email me off list, figure this is as good of a place to ask that
type of non related question?

Millennium is the absolute best vegan restaurant I have ever been to:
   http://www.millenniumrestaurant.com/

If you go there (you really should), GET DESSERT.  You won't regret it.


Greens is also very good, though the food is pricier (though not 
necessarily better), and uses a lot of butter/dairy:

bon appetit!

WORD!!!!


Millenium is heaven.  i am going on the 17th.

Greens is superb too, but Millenium is Vegan.  It can't be beat.

However, if you are in the east bay and don't want to drop $100 or more on
Millenium then you have to go to:

Cha-Ya  (vegan japanese cuisine)
http://www.vegdining.com/GetRest.cfm?rk=US-CA-BERK-CHAYA

nothing compares to it.

love,
JOnas

What a fantastically myopic interpretation. Given that Americans pay
substantially less in taxes than the rest of the world, it wouldn't
really make sense to leave because you feel that you're overtaxed. I
meant exactly what I wrote, and I'm not going to bother phrasing it
differently because I've made the same point on so many previous
occasions, in direct response to your self-righteous Libertarian
propaganda. Obviously you're a lost cause, but I think that everyone
else reading this is astute enough to understand it.

> You obviously dislike corporations. Are you going to stop using their
> products?

I already have. Whenever possible, I avoid purchasing products from big
corporations. Alas, there are few products that haven't been
monopolized, their production off-shored, their packaging expanded, and
their utility and reliability reduced--all at the hands of corporations
with nothing but their own short-term gains in mind.

It's a waste of my time to refute everything else you've written because
I've stated my position so many times already. For future reference,
check the archives if you want a response. I'm done arguing this idiotic
corporate worship.

Toodles,

Is there anyone out there that could recommend some sort of MIDI interface that integrates with Reason? I'm looking for something with a bunch of knobs & shit that I could assign to knobs & switches in Reason. 
 
Also, is there any kind of "full screen" mode in Reason? I know, I know, "go buy the fucking book chuck." Thanks for the input 'yall!
 
peace

Definitely the Evolution UC-33e. It even comes with overlays for most of
the Reason instruments.

<http://www.evolution.co.uk/products/evo_uc33e.htm>

Get that and any of the cheap 2-octave MIDI keyboards out there and
you're golden.

Not that I know of.

Oooo....  my turn.

How about the way we're overtaxed.... not as an absolute percentage, 
but compared to what we get out of it?

When I had my dotcom job, I was blathering on the internet once with 
some techies from the UK.  When the subject drifted to taxed (This was 
around the end of april of that year.) I dug out my tax return and 
looked up my tax bracket.  And, to my surprise, I found that when I 
added my California state income tax to my federal (Including social 
security and medicare taxes), I was actually paying a HIGHER percentage 
of my income, in taxes, than some of the guys, with jobs similar to 
mine, in the UK....  The UK, and other European countries in general, 
being the whipping-boys of high taxes and "socialist nanny-state" 
programs that libertarian trolls love to hate so much.

But what did I GET for my higher-than-in-the-UK taxes?  Well, what do 
THEY get?

Nearly everybody likes to bitch about the UK's NHS system.  But it's 
THERE.  It may not be the BEST health care around.  But it's available, 
guaranteed, for a lower tax rate than I was paying here; where there's 
NOTHING.

Likewise with their social security system.  Again, probably not as 
well-run as it could be.  But it's a damn sight better than the 
boondoggle ponzi scam that passes for social "security" in the US.

Public transportation.  Short of New York, and a couple other bits of 
the New England seaboard, The SF Bay Area have the best public 
transport systems in the US.  That's a SAD thing to say.  Because, as 
good as we have it compared to other americans. BART and MUNI suck 
major ass compared to the availability, reliability, and coverage of 
the rail systems in the UK, France, the Netherlands, Germany, and 
plenty of others.  If I REALLY wanted to play unfairly, I'd mention 
Japan's subway and rail systems.  Tokyo literally has millions, (Yes, 
MILLIONS.  Tokyo has a permanent population of twelve million, and a 
daytime population of FIFTEEN million, once the commuters get to work.) 
of non-residents who commute into the city every day.  And, short of 
natural disasters, their public transit is on time, every time.

What did *I* get, for paying a higher tax rate than in a "socialist" 
country like the UK?  "None of the above." would be a valid answer.

So no, as an absolute figure, we're not overtaxed.  But in terms of 
benefit gained vs. dollars paid, damn straight, we are.

	When talking about refunds from the Bush tax cuts, you wanted to use 
dollar amounts rather than percentages in order to prove that the rich 
were getting a better deal. Now all of a sudden you want to claim that 
"Americans pay substantially less in taxes than the rest of the world." 
Not so fast!  In real dollars the EXACT OPPOSITE of what you claim is 
true -- the amount of taxes paid by U.S. taxpayers is GREATER than that 
paid by taxpayers in any other country. How do you think the U.S. 
government has the BIGGEST budget in the world? It's largely derived 
from tax money stolen from working Americans!

	Also, I did not think you were suggesting I leave the country. I meant 
that your "if you don't like paying taxes, don't use the services" 
response has the same kind of blithely dismissive tone as conservatives 
do when they say things like "America -- love it or leave it!"

	You only call it "propaganda" and "self-righteous" because you don't 
like what I have to say. And, I suspect, because you think you are in 
the majority in this community and therefore you believe you can get 
away with being rude.

	"Whenever possible" -- in other words when it's convenient for you. I 
don't know much about your personal lifestyle, but I strongly suspect 
you own a computer. Even on the off chance you put it together 
yourself, the components you used were undoubtedly manufactured by 
large corporations. I don't know of any mom and pop operations making 
things like pentium processors, do you? And I'll bet you're using other 
products like electricity, light bulbs, soap, toothpaste, a 
refrigerator, silverware, television, socks, etc., that are made by 
large corporations. I'm sure it would be very inconvenient to give up 
all those things. But you have no problem telling me to give up using 
government services paid for with tax dollars. Well, I'll do it when 
it's convenient for me -- how about that?

	Off-shoring is a good thing. Why? Because it means more jobs and 
economic opportunity for people in the developing world who are living 
in *real* poverty. You apparently want to keep all the good jobs in the 
United States. I think that attitude is -- dare I say it? -- downright 
selfish.

	I could just as easily call your arguments "government worship." 
However I'm capable of seeing them with a bit more nuance than that. 
You're obviously capable of criticizing certain aspects of government 
-- just as I criticized many aspects of corporations in my last 
message, even though you chose not to acknowledge it.

Peace, love & liberty,

John,

	That's a fair point. Perhaps it points to the fact that the United 
States is just too large as a country. Geographically, and in terms of 
population, it's much larger than all the other countries you mention 
below. Short of splitting the U.S. into multiple countries (something I 
support), I think one helpful change would be to shift more 
responsibility to state governments. If government intervention into 
areas like health care and transportation happened exclusively at the 
state level instead of politicians trying to plan everything 
nationally, the scale of these systems would be closer to what exists 
in the UK, Japan, etc.

Groove on,

Starchild...

Like you, I believe there to be far too much government in the U.S. at
present, and am generally of the opinion that the government governs
best that governs least.  However, part of my ethos (and, by
extension, I assume, part of yours) is a strong reliance on
responsibility for one's actions and respect for those around you.  We
can't, after all, expect people to take us seriously when we clamour
for less government intervention in the lives of the people if we
can't, in our own lives and actions, demonstrate reasonable
self-governance.  To that end, I have to ask, why the hell do you keep
posting your screeds to this list?  I agree with you that Libertarian
policies dovetail with the values, such as they are, of the "rave
scene," but it's obvious that the vast majority of the active members
of this list are not of the same political persuasion, and it seems
that you're engendering more animosity towards our ideologies, to say
nothing of undercutting the point you're trying to make, with your
posts.  As someone who shares many of your beliefs and values, I beg
of you: stop making us look bad!  Off-topic posts to listservs are not
the way to espouse your political values and rally people to your
cause; that takes one on one discourse, conversation, and mutual
understanding.

Rude? I've *never* seen you at a party, Starchild. I can't recall a
single post of yours that's been music related. What's your role in this
community? Because it seems to me (and other list members with whom I've
spoken) that you just use this list and your self-identification as a
"raver" as an excuse to preach your your political beliefs to
impressionable young people. That would be "rude", to say the least.

So I'm sorry if I didn't exactly come off as polite, but I don't know
any other way to make you, quite bluntly, shut the hell up. I'm sick of
arguing about taxes and corporations with you on this list, and I
imagine the rest of the list membership is a bit tired of watching us
duke it out. So stop it. Please.

Thanks,

Subject: Re: [sfraves] (nrr) U.S. Lags Behind Rest of World in Corporate Tax Reform (unsubscribing)

	Thanks for your perspective, Jonathan. I agree with you about the 
importance of personal responsibility. My interest in the rave scene is 
strongly related to my perception of raves as a cultural development 
with the potential to change the world for the better. Electronic music 
can be cool, but I don't see it doing a lot to change the world. For 
the most part it is devoid of lyrics, and therefore of content that 
carries a particular and specific meaning. So I don't see ideas that 
can change the world for the better as any less related to raves than a 
discussion of more content-heavy music that's not generally associated 
with raves -- industrial, or blues, or what-not.

	Are people annoyed by "off-topic" posts about non-rave music? I 
haven't particularly seen that they are, but I think that's due to the 
notion (which I disagree with) that the scene should be more about 
music than about building an alternative community with an eye toward 
improving life. Maybe posts about non-rave music would generate more 
animosity if some people hated the blues and some other people 
routinely posted material expressing the merits of blues music. 
Personally I'd say let the debate flourish! Politics aside, I 
appreciate SFRaves as a place to read well-written messages about the 
interests and beliefs of people who also happen to belong to the rave 
community. But perhaps I am in the minority in feeling this way.

	I'm certainly not here to piss people off. Since your post seems to be 
some indication that I'm doing that, it's probably time for a change. 
Rather than posting political messages I could simply attach a 
signature file with political quotes in it to all my emails, as some 
list participants do. But then all you get are repeated sound bites 
rather than an in-depth look at an issue and the chance for dialogue.

	When I'm subscribed to a list, I do try to read *every* post. I did 
finally filter Geri Dahl and that guy who kept posting crazy conspiracy 
stuff, but basically I read everything else. And on balance, I'm 
thinking that if you take serious discussion of political ideas out of 
the mix, there just isn't enough else here right now to sustain my 
interest in spending the kind of time necessary to belong to SFRaves. 
Therefore it looks like time to unsubscribe again for a while. Probably 
I'll be back at some point to see where the community is at. I 
certainly hope that it blows up like crazy and we enjoy a new 
renaissance of raving, or some other bohemian movement that attracts 
the same kind of energy, at which point perhaps the relevance of the 
kind of messages I've been posting will become more clear.

Groove on,

i'd like to vouch for starchild's involvement within this

everyone else on this list.  he was fairly active in the "early

come to think of it, the only times i go out now are when i DJ.
 had i not shifted gears from just attending events, i'd

he may have different views than i do with regard to his

i think that everyone's entitled to speak their mind.  if
someone's impressionable, then i suppose it's on them to gather
information and make the right choice for themselves and the
community they're involved in.  personally, i think that most
of the US is pretty impressionable.  but then again, i'm an
asshole.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] (nrr) U.S. Lags Behind Rest of World in Corporate Tax Reform (unsubscribing)

Starchild,

I wholeheartedly agree with you that the sociocultural phenomenon that
is "raving" has the potential to change the world.  I've often
marvelled at how the skillset we develop throwing parties, namely, the
covert movement of materiel, the community organizing as exemplified
by flyers and mailing lists, and the ability to rapdily convene large
groups of people in unconventional gathering spaces and keep those
gatherings clandestine, are all necessary prerequisite skills for "the
Revolution."  Even short of the total overthrow of the American
hegemony, I think the "rave scene" has the potential to be the
catalyst for real social change.

I say potential, however, because I haven't seen evidence of real
change yet, and the prognosis for the future is not particularly rosy
(unless one thinks that Coolworld will be the crucible of a new
society...).  For the most part, people seem to be here to have a good
time, hear some good music, ingest various quality entheo- and
entacto-gens, and get laid.  To which I respond, "FUCK YEAH!"

Even if we resign ourselves to the fact that we're not going to be
seeing cadres of candykids storming the Capitol any time soon, there's
certainly a place for political discourse on this list.   Issues such
as Prohibition, the freedom of cultural expression (intellectual
property laws and copyright), and "public safety" laws that impinge on
our freedom to assemble are obviously of interest and relevance to
everyone in this community.  However, I fail to see the relevance of
corporate tax rates to our "scene" (well, except for Coolworld).

That said, I always hate to see an intelligent and articulate person
leave any listserv I'm on; such qualities are rare in the online
world.  I would say the tone of my first email should be read as
"frustrated" as opposed to "pissed off" and urge you not to
unsubscribe.  Otherwise, how am I going to explain all these hippies
that they can only have my gun when they pry it from my cold, dead
hands?

- Jonathan

I agree with you, Michael (not that you're an asshole, however).  Whatever 
young, impressionable minds there are left on this list are exposed to far 
more propaganda of various types, including relentless marketing :-$, than 
Starchild's libertarian philosophy.  He is, as many of you know, the 
outreach coordinator for the libertarian party in SF and I guess this was 
part of his outreach.

Larger issue is that all this political discussion falls under the NRR 
category.  Starchild uses this label, as do others, when he posts 
non-rave-related material.  Easy enough to configure an email client to 
trash all the NRR stuff if people aren't interested.  As I have mentioned 
before I believe there is a "political" dimension to raving...or rather was 
in the past.  Guess things change.

Finally, I'm sorry to see him go.

Love,

Apollo

"The government, which was designed for the people, has got into the hands 
of the bosses and their employers, the special interests.  An invisible 
empire has been set up above the forms of democracy."
-Woodrow Wilson

"Sometime in your life, hope that you might see one starved man, the look 
on his face when the bread finally arrives.  Hope that you might have 
bought it or baked it or even kneaded it yourself.  For that look on his 
face, for your meeting his eyes across a piece of bread, you might be 
willing to lose a lot, or suffer a lot, or die a little, even."
-Daniel Berrigan

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."

hahahahahaha

Now, Andrew- you know the rules of the internets say you can't just
shoot down a thread without starting one of your own!  

What I'd like to see addressed is the deleterious effect rising oil
prices are having on the going rate for having one's lawn mowed by a
Bunny Rabbit.  Time was that I could get it done for 4 carrots per
square hectare.

Now the little cottontailed beeyotches want 6.  ..and healthcare, too.

Tie a yellow ribbon 'round that!

Subject: [sfraves] Breakbeat music stores in the Bay Area

Hi All,

Does anyone know of any good breakbeat music stores in the Bay Area?

How do we get to listen to the stuff that dj's play at clubs/raves?

Has anyone heard of the "New Frisco Sound" track? Where do I find the 
original breaks track?

Thanks,

Vidur

Hey everyone, I don't post to this list all that often, but some of you may know me. I work at the golden triangle smoke shop / medicinal club. Yesterday I was informed we are closing down immediately maybe indefinitely, maybe until just the end of the year. Although they have hooked me up with a sweet severance package, I am going to have to find another part time income because i have to pay rent and eat and so on.... If any of you ever came into the golden triangle (on haight and central) you know we we're like family in there I am really sad it had to end. But if anyone knows of any part time jobs (I'm a student of advertising) it would be great if you could forward them to me! thanks so much guys and girls

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Breakbeat music stores in the Bay Area

Therte are few stores in the Bay Area that stock breaks.

www.primalrecords.com  in Berkeley is really the only store i have been to
that has any decent sort of selection to it.

I do all my breaks buying online - where you can hear samples and the
selection is primo.

www.releaserecords.com

www.streetwisemusic.com

www.vinyladdiction.co.uk

www.dropshop.com

www.satelliterecords.com  (although their service is ass nowadays)

www.planetxusa.com  (I hate them - but they have good samples)

Go to www.groundscore.net/board to see what the local breaks dj's are
jockin' and talkin' about.  Or ask me what's hot, cuz I am a fucking vinyl
junkie and I'm pretty up-to-date on what's new, what's good, etc. etc.

Incidentally, I'm spinning some tasty nuskool & tech-funk tonight at RADIO
BAR in Oakland if you wanna hear some choonz. You can trainspot/peruse my
record bag if you like - if you buy me a beer anyway, lol.

Ez.
Marc(O)

breaks huh?

the new frisco sound is phillip/indigo's mix.  a tasty mix i might say.  
contact him for track listings.

breaks that are being played at clubs and raves?  lots of different kind of 
breaks to talk about.  everything from nu skool, funky, nrg breaks, tech 
funk, progressive, old school.

what kinds of stuff are you interested in?  harder and darker?  progressive 
and smooth?  vocals?  ass shaking stuff?

and while you're at it, go ahead and download a mix of mine!

also check out www.sfbreaks.org for lots of mixes and message boards.

Well I hope you're enjoying yourself and hopefully the rabbits don't
come after you after they finish with your lawn.  Maybe it's time to

Hi all,
 
That sounds like a I Star Trek title ;p But anyway, was looking for something fun to do this weekend...and was thinking of going to Thump at Space 550. Recommended- Yes or no? Im partial to jungle, drum & bass, and deep house... I might go out saturday too. 
I know this is a San Franciscolist but it cant hurt to ask! I'll be in NYC for a month (or more?)- any must visit clubs/events? 
 
Cheers,
Denise

i'd very much recommend thump @ 550.  and that's not just
because i'm spinning...  :P

andrew spins house, tho not really too deep.  i'm spinning
downtempo, but am undecided on spinning half of my set as
atmospheric d+b.

sun project is not to be missed, even if you're not into

"The government, which was designed for the people, has got into the hands 
of the bosses and their employers, the special interests.  An invisible 
empire has been set up above the forms of democracy."
-Woodrow Wilson

"Sometime in your life, hope that you might see one starved man, the look 
on his face when the bread finally arrives.  Hope that you might have 
bought it or baked it or even kneaded it yourself.  For that look on his 
face, for your meeting his eyes across a piece of bread, you might be 
willing to lose a lot, or suffer a lot, or die a little, even."
-Daniel Berrigan

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

Subject: [sfraves] ken ishi or john aquaviva?

hey, so Ken Ishi and John Aquaviva are both spinning
on Friday, Dec. 17 and i don't know what to do.  Ishi
is at 1015, which i hate, and Aquaviva is at
mezzanine, which i like.  but it's ishi's first
appearance in SF, and that's exciting.  any opinions? 
recommendations?  i have a feeling they'll both be
playing at peak times, so i'm not so sure about party
hopping (plus i don't want to spend too much.)  i've
never seen either of them play.  i tend to like
detroit techno and minimal stuff, and i like a hard
techno set every once in a while as long as it's
well-mixed, and, well, intricate - differerent sounds,
not all the same beat, etc.  

what to do what to do...

any opinions?

monikat

than likely be the last time he comes here.  i've seen
him on a few occasions or i'd go for SURE!  JA is a
great DJ, but for you, being the tech-head you are,
Ken Ishi is a must NOT MISS..he's a great performer
and plays such a divrse set.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] (NRR) Oil Price Increases Cause Bunny Rabbit Lawnmower Service Rate Hike | Was: - Re: [sfraves] (nrr) U.S. Lags Behind Rest of World in Corporate Tax Reform

Funnily enough, at my grocery store (Rainbow in SF), they used to have
this insane pricing on Marmite.  Like, the big 250 gram jar used to
cost the same as most places charge for the 100 gram.  Recently I went
to stock up again, and, crap, it'd gone up like $5.  They put a little
sign on the area saying:

"Dear Marmite Buyer:  We regret to inform you that due to rising oil
costs and general unrest in the world market, we will no longer be able
to offer the low prices on Marmite that we know you've enjoyed. 
Sorry!"

I queried a few people in the store as to the BS-or-not quotient of
this sign, and the person that seemed to know what's up said that that
was Best Foods UK's excuse for increased wholesale costs of Marmite..

Hahahahahaha!

Thump = good times

But I'm a resident with them so I'm biased.  Side room will be deep house,
upstairs downtempo/breaks, main room psytrance.  The Halloween party was
absolutely nuts.

JOHN MUTHAFUCKIN' AQUAVIVA!!!!!!

He is still one of my all time favorite DJ's. A great guy, very friendly,
and one helluva innovator and DJ/producer. I have never had a shitty time
seeing him, EVER. I will most likely go see him now that I know he's
playin'...

Thanks for the heads up!

I'm all deep baby!  Actually no, but people don't really seem to know =
what
deep house is these days anyway.  They just call all underground non =
jacking
house deep.  For me deep is Glenn Underground, Paul Johnson, Boo =
Williams,
etc...and I definitely can't fake the funk when it comes to that kinda =
deep.

When do u think will be the next time u gonna get to see Ken Ishii?
Maybe in 2046?

So what if it's @ 1015? All the fuckards would have left for Ruby Skye
within the first 15 minutes of Ishii's set.

true that.  glenn underground is the epitome of deep.  some
early stuff on the "large" label, and a lot of ra-soul's stuff
from '98-'01 is pretty damn deep.

some paul johnson is definitely not deep.  older stuff - i have
this "feel my MF bass" track that is borderline house-no. 
definitely not tech-house, more technoish.

working on it...  :)

went thru some of my records last night:  thinking since the
upstairs room is more on the downtempo tip, i'll spin dubbed
out-atmospheric-d+b to get the room moving.  i'll play it by
ear after that.  FYI, i'm on at 11:30pm - 1:00am.

if you want to hear some sick atmospherics, check out DJ M and
harken.  both of those cats know how to throw down, and they do
so regularly.  alternatively, method one and kaos (altho i'm
not sure kaos is still around) were the absolute sickest
atmospheric d+b DJs i have ever encountered.  better than
bukem, PFM, blame.

mike bee is also pretty damn good, tho i haven't seen him on
any flyers lately.  wish FM used to spin out too, tho i haven't
seen him around since faster bamboo closed down.

Acquaviva was pretty mediocre when I saw him with Hawtin on the Plus 8 tour

Subject: Re: [sfraves] GM Coca

LOL. I just (as in ten minutes ago) finished a paper about GMOs and
part of the paper was about the "Boliviana Negra."  Here's a great
article from Wired Magazine that I found doing research:

http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.11/columbia.html

The bottom line is that the plant developed a resistance to the
glyphosate being sprayed on a daily basis. (The local legal crops were
not so lucky.) For the past three years farmers have been sharing
cuttings of the herbicide resistant strain.

What's really funny is that so many people in the U.S. were convinced
that the only way it could have been done was through genetic
modification. Looks like the tried and true method of selective
breeding works just as well.

There's a little store down in San Jose that specializes in various 
products (food, hygiene, clothing, and otherwise) imported from 
Australia.  They also do mail/internet order:

http://aussieproducts.com/

But they do have a small retail shop.  Every so often, when I'm low/out 
and in the South Bay during the daytime for some other reason, I drop 
in and pick up the big jar for $11; about a quarter of what I'd pay for 
the same amount at safeway.  If you're really hardcore, they usually 
stock a 5.5 tub for $35.  But my roommates would KILL me if they found 
that thing taking up space in the fridge.


cya,
john

Holy crap.  Isn't that made from leftovers from the beer distilling
process or something?

In related news, at my last job we had a Marmite junkie, who worked as a
project manager.  It was so cool when he'd ask me if I was on "she-jool".

andyw

p.s.	Oh, and on the Ken Ishii vs. John Aquaviva thing... I'm hitting
up Ken even though I *swore* to never go to 1015 again after they kicked
me out for smoking a hit off a joint the MC handed me.  NOT MY FAULT!

I'm all deep baby!  Actually no, but people don't really seem to know what
deep house is these days anyway.  They just call all underground non jacking
house deep.  For me deep is Glenn Underground, Paul Johnson, Boo Williams,
etc...and I definitely can't fake the funk when it comes to that kinda deep.

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Any metal folks out there?

RIP Dimebag.  And on the anniversary of Lennon's shooting too.

http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/12/09/nightclub.shooting/index.html

COLUMBUS, Ohio (CNN) -- A gunman opened fire Wednesday night during a heavy
metal concert in Columbus, killing four people -- including at least one
member of the band -- and critically wounding at least two others before a
police officer shot and killed him, according to Columbus police.
The attacker leapt onstage as the group, Damageplan, performed, and began
"targeting members in the band," Sgt. Brent Mull said.
Two others were injured in the incident, although the nature of their
injuries was not clear.
According to eyewitness accounts, the gunman initially shot and killed the
band's guitarist, Dimebag Darrell. Darrell, 38, and his brother, Vinnie
Paul, 40, are former members of Pantera -- a group they formed in the
1980s. Their father is Jerry Abbott, a country and western songwriter and
producer.



This is the heavy metal equivalent of the John Lennon shooting.  Tragic,
tragic, tragic.

True dat
STILL SEARCHING....

It has been dry for years.  Time for the hippie underground to unite
and bring the god water to its disciples.  Back in the day it was like 
everywhere.  Now its like... how the HELL are you gunna have a rave without
fuel>?!  
My take is, back in the mid/late 90s it started to dry up and E took over.
Now everyone sits around on the floor too fucked up to dance.  What kind of 
party is that>?  People need to be baptized in this scene.
Turn on. Tune in. Break out. Now.

Subject: [sfraves] NRR:  Dimebag

I know this is a rave list, but there has to be others out there like me 
that still enjoy metal, and Pantera was a band that really hit it for me 
back in the 90s.  

Apparently some gun man at a concert in Ohio stormed the stage and killed 
him along with three other people before the police shot him.  Sad day for 
music :(

We went from coke to crystals, but oh well, interesting conversation compared 
to all the politics on this list.  Thank god the election is over.
Yes read that article a while back, a good read no doubt.
Here is the greatest paragraph in the lot...

<<<How permanent is the acid drought? The history of drug prohibition 
indicates that the government can upset supply and demand at the margins. It can 
drive one drug into scarcity only to see users substitute it with another. But it 
never eliminates the market for drugs altogether. As the drug war enters its 
second century, LSD appears to be in retreat. But never bet against a 
comeback.>>>

Cant wait!  Its basically saying the drug war is a waste of time and money.
Cant stop that supply and demand eh?  America needs a wake up call...
and the hippies will dial it in.    =]

Oh well back to slaving over a hot mouse pad...

Subject: Re: [sfraves] GM Coca

I'm reading "The Botany of Desire - a plant's-eye view of the world" by  
Michael Pollan, and he has an entire chapter about the history of  
cannabis sativa and cannabis indica, and how Ronnie Regan's 'drug war'  
in the 80's pushed the growers to experiment with the limitations and  
genetic traits of the plant that lead to the crossing of the sativa and  
indica strains and the subsequent perfecting of hydroponic techniques.

Suddenly (well, within 20 years, which is fast for a plant's  
evolution), the plant was producing up to 15% THC by weight, where only  
a few years ago 2-3% was the norm.  Since most drugs come from plants,  
I think this drug war will ultimately lead to genetic research to get  
around the laws ('designer' plant compounds), or to make the plants so  
powerful (like the indica/sativa hybrids) that it won't be necessary to  
go anywhere but your closet greenhouse to get what you need.

Get this book.

Subject: [sfraves] New Music Uploaded!

--0-1963111437-1102609646=:59716
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I have just posted two *NEW* sets to my site @ www.retroactivefunk.djcentral.com One of them is a mix written and produced entirely by myself! Yes folks, these are the sum of a years worth of hard work, 11 self-produced tracks of deep tech house goodness, called "progress report", mixed together for a seamless journey into "my sound". Feel free to send feedback, love/hate mail, or requests for cds mixed or unmixed for those dj's out there. I also uploaded a live set recorded at Johnny V's in downtown SJ full of tracks that have been moving me over the last year. There is now a total of 9 sets up at djcentral for your enjoyment with hopefully more to come! Membership is free and painless, and once you are a member you have access to hundreds of streaming dj sets, of all genres of music from dj's all over the world! You can't beat that for free, so go check it out!
 
Cheers,
Gabriel

Subject: [sfraves] appreciating SF right now...

i just wanted to pipe in and say, since i can be a bit
of a complainer at times, that i'm really appreciating
nightlife in SF right now, particularly the small but
lively techno scene right now.  for a while this fall
i was going out every week, and i hadn't done that in
a long time.  let's see, this year in SF i've heard
Miss Kittin, Ada, Jeff Samuels, Ellen Alien, Matthew
Dear a few times, oh, and i'm probably forgetting some
folks.  Also locals like Broker Dealer and Christian
Bloch.  and i haven't even managed to hear a lot of
other good techno locals lately like Forest Green or
Lisa Fox.  and next week is Matthew Dear, then maybe
Christian Bloch, then it looks like Ken Ishi.  nice!  

the best dj set i heard this year was actually Miss
Kittin in SF, and that's saying a lot, since i finally
dragged my ass across the Atlantic to Sonar this year,
after a great weekend at Movement in Detroit.  

and while i still have some minor complaints about
things here, like the sound system at Rx, and the face
that it's so damnced tiny, and well, the fact that
most of the folks i want to hear just play in europe
and maybe chicago and ny, i've been pretty satisfied
lately.  

not complaining TOO much right now,
monikat

I am a very big metal fan. I was very sad to hear this new. It's a sad day indeed.

I fuckin' love it here in SF. I have never had so much variety music-wise at
my disposal in a LONG time. As much as I love DC - it's a very formulaic
area, and people just don't support some of the smaller scenes very well.

Yay for SF!

That's not something we should encourage, we need stick boy to keep
his stick hidden in his pants.  you'd think his little stick was a
real tree and need sunlight once in a while.  Well michael i'm afraid
i have to tell you sunshine wont make it grow any bigger, so just keep
it in your pants.

Ja mon...  I used to be a freak for it- eating it in dollops straight
out of the jar...  Ah, my heyday as a sodium junkie.  Now it finds a
lot of use as a secret weapon seasoning in tofu dishes.

Nothing else quite has that "stank" and savouryness that screams,
"shit, I'm eating meat!".

The best thing is, it's rumored to prevent hangovers if you eat it at
the same time as getting drunk.  Maybe the spent yeast in both it and
the beer get together and talk about old times in the bottom of the
barrel and forget to fuxx0r you over...

OK, less crack tomorrow I promise,

Yeah man, you will have much fun out here.

It's not even just the music. The food is great, people are really cool,
weather is amazing most of the time, the scenery is unbelievable (I never
get sick of the East Bay or SF skylines), etc.

The bay area just gots it goin' on (and on and on).

Subject: [sfraves] bsp:  SUN PROJECT @ (((thump))) tomorrow!

http://www.thumpradio.com/index.cfm?eventid=2103

There is only one S.U.N. Project - an amazing and innovative
trio from Hamburg, Germany that have fused the massive global
trance sound with live electric guitar and live drums on stage.
Their performances are legendary around the world, and at
(((Thump))) parties since 1999. We are very pleased to have
them back at 550 Barneveld for the first time in over 2 years.
Those of you who have seen them live before know what to expect
- those that haven't will just have to find out! 

Getting things warmed up is the French tech-trance master Joss
of Three Point Turn and Authentik doing an interactive live /
DJ set. Treavor from Moontribe and Kepi of RedeyeFoundation are
also laying down trance in the main room.

The House room features deep funked-up beats from Tracy, Galen,
Andrew Phelan and Mike Giannini.

And to keep things chilled out a bit, Sinikus, Red Stickman,
Peek and Jackie will be your guides in the downtempo room.

3 rooms, 3 Libation Stations, amazing art, massage, big sound,
good times.

Come celebrate the last (((Thump))) of 2004!

Just knowing that techno gets played out there makes me plurb my pants.  

I really need a change of pace, this is going to be a crazy adventure for 
me.  On the bright side Kellie is going to be there too :)  Or is it the 
otherway around?  What ever *g*

Hey all, I'll be playing with my man Origami on bass tonight for Stylus =
@ The Oasis (135 12th Street).

If you haven't been before Stylus is my favorite house night in the East =
Bay, and The Oasis is a great indoor/outdoor venue with a canopy and =
heat lamps just in case the weather sours.

Also Brad Electro and Jaswho will be doing a live PA before our set, all =
for only $5 at the door.  Should be good times!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] BSP: Stylus @ The Oasis in Oakand tonight!

..and for anybody who hasn't seen BradElectro & Jaswho? yet, dj2 opened
for them at the OtherWorld Halloween party this year and they owned. 
Not a lot of folks are making music like they do these days- very much
in the old Imperial Dub vein, but with a new twist.

As far as I know, Jaswho? at least actually appeared on some IDR
releases.

Boh, boh!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Remedy 2niiiiiiiite

Do yourself a favor and check out Club 6 tonight. Go to Live105.com and see 
who's on the lineup. $10 - Remedy is only good when it's an Om record 
release night and they have Farina, Miggs, JT Donaldson, etc in there. That 
brings out people there for the music and thins out the shitty crowd that's 
there for the booty pick up scene that 1015 Folsom has seemed to dump on 
them. Thump@550 is like $20, but it's more of a party than a club night and 
has several rooms featuring several genres.

Dustin, 
 
Thank you! I cannot convey to you what a blessing this will be to my relationship! I'll make sure to change the url before I show it to my g/f . . .
 
BTW, for those of us that *really* give a shit about breast cancer (and wtf is wrong with guys that don't), you can buy a sheet of stamps @ the post office. Six cents goes to research for every one you use. I'm sure it adds up!
 
peace

Just as the highest and the lowest notes are equally inaudible, so=20
perhaps, is the greatest sense and the greatest nonsense equally=20
unintelligible.
Allan Watts

The greatest achievement is selflessness.
The greatest worth is self-mastery.
The greatest quality is seeking to serve others.
The greatest precept is continual awareness.
The greatest medicine is the emptiness of everything.
The greatest action is not conforming with the worlds ways.
The greatest magic is transmuting the passions.
The greatest generosity is non-attachment.
The greatest goodness is a peaceful mind.
The greatest patience is humility.
The greatest effort is not concerned with results.
The greatest meditation is a mind that lets go.
The greatest wisdom is seeing through appearances.
Atisha

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) Questions about Bit Torrent

i usually turn to SFR when i have absolutely no clue about something, 
and i can usually get an answer because i know there's some random 
person out there that's an expert on just about every subject.

anyone know how to use bit torrent?  we downloaded it on my friend's 
mac, but now what?  i've heard you use in in conjunction with programs 
like aquisition or limewire ... any help on what to do next would be 
appreciated.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] (nrr) Questions about Bit Torrent

Once you have installed a bittorrent client, you need to find a source for
the torrent files. A torrent file has an extension of ".torrent", and
contains a hash of all the data blocks that make up the file you're
ultimately trying to download. It also contains the location of a
"tracker", which is a special server that keeps track of all the other
clients who are currently downloading or sharing the data file.

You don't really have to know in detail how it works, just do a google
search for whatever you're looking for followed by the word "torrent", and
you'll probably find a bunch of sites that have links to torrents of all
sorts. I usually download the .torrent file to my local machine first, and
then open it from there (your tracker should then launch and start
downloading the file data). The .torrent file is very small, usually 10k
or so. The powerful thing about bittorrent is that as soon as you have
downloaded even one block of the file, other people can start downloading
that block from you. It's considered good etiquette to leave your client
running after your download completes, long enough so you have uploaded at
least the same amount of data as you have downloaded.

Christian party animals
Evangelizing to the young and wasted in party centers around the globe, 
members of the 24-7 Prayer team hope to bring Jesus to the raving, godless 
masses.

- - - - - - - - - - - -
By Kimberley Sevcik

SALON.COM (PAID SUB)

Dec. 10, 2004  |  IBIZA, Spain -- By their eighth night in the West End, 
Ibiza's low-rent nightlife district, the members of the 
<http://www.24-7prayer.com/>24-7 Prayer team don't flinch at anything they 
see: not at the woman lifting her skirt to ask a group of men what color 
panties she's wearing; not at the guy with papier-mâché breasts strapped 
around his waist, standing beside a sign that says "Dexter has the clap"; 
not at the guy mooning the girl who just spurned his advances, or the one 
across the street, pulling his dick out of his pants and flopping it on the 
table for the viewing pleasure of two horrified, delighted young blonds.

They press through the crowds, four sober people among the drunken masses, 
looking for openings: a friendly face who wouldn't mind a little 
unsolicited conversation; a swerving body that could use a steady arm to 
help it home. The bar promoters are the easiest ones to approach. They'll 
talk to anyone -- most of them work on commission, and every conversation 
is a potential sale.

A guy with spiky blond hair in a "FCUK" T-shirt calls out to two of the 
missionaries, Lorraine Joslin and Charli Franklin. "Hey ladies, what you 
doing later? Stop by for a drink?"

"Sorry, we're not drinking tonight," says Franklin, a throaty-voiced 
21-year-old with a tiny rhinestone stud in her nose. This elicits protests 
and confusion from the tout.

"We're praying," she says.

He looks even more confused.

Franklin and Joslin introduce themselves, and so does he. His name is Mark. 
"Is there anything we can pray about for you, Mark?" Joslin asks. She's 23, 
a witty brunet with Cleopatra eyes who gets a kick out of belching in 
people's faces.

He thinks for a minute, then grins. "Yeah," he says. "Pray that I live 
until September."

"All right," Joslin says. She sounds a little uncertain. "What makes you 
think you won't make it until September?"

"I'll probably die from all the drugs I'm doing." He turns toward another 
group of women, stuttering past on high heels. "Ladies, can I interest you 
in a drink tonight?"

The missionaries are headed for the Bull Bar, a sour-smelling grotto with a 
reflex tester on the bar that rewards low scorers with a free drink. The 
Bull Bar serves as the base of operations for the 24-7 Prayer team on 
Tuesday and Friday nights. While 24-7's very own DJ, 21-year-old Matt 
Riley, mixes acid-house music for a crowd that would rather be gyrating to 
<http://archive.salon.com/ent/music/review/2003/07/01/beyonce/>Beyonce, the 
rest of the team passes out free fruit to patrons. As they see it, handing 
out fruit is a way of doing something generous in a place where most people 
are bent on maximizing their own pleasure. It's also a way of warming 
people up to talk about Jesus.

Riley has been DJing since age 15, when he took a workshop with a Christian 
youth group. He was hooked from Day 1. He felt as if God had ordained him 
to DJ, to lead worship through the decks. There was only one problem: 
Becoming a good DJ required hours of practice, and hours of practice 
required buying his own decks. But decks cost about 800 pounds each, and 
15-year-old Riley didn't have that kind of money in his piggy bank. He 
wrote to church members and family friends saying, "I'm really feeling this 
is from God, and to get good at this, I have to get my own decks." Within a 
couple of months, he had 1,000 pounds in donations. "It was good," says 
Riley, "because they weren't really my decks, were they? They were God's. 
So I had to come through for him."

The Bull Bar isn't exactly a dream gig for a DJ looking to build a career. 
But Riley, who runs a popular club night called Rubik's Kube back home in 
the U.K., says he's not playing at the Bull Bar to advance his reputation. 
"There's a need for 24-7 in the West End," he says. "If Jesus were in 
Ibiza, he'd be at the Bull Bar."

Ibiza, an island off the eastern coast of Spain, is known as the clubbing 
capital of the world, a place that's fueled by the kind of unabashed 
hedonism that characterized New York's Studio 54 in its heyday. Its 
excesses are legendary: the orgies on the yachts that cruise the harbor, 
the club owners who conceived their first child during a live sex show 
before 12,000 people. Club kids, models and playboys come to Ibiza to 
breathe the same air as Paris Hilton and dance at the altars of DJs like 
Pete Tong and Roger Sanchez, jacked up on half a gram of coke or a hit of 
<http://dir.salon.com/topics/ecstasy/>Ecstasy or both. Around 6 a.m., 
everyone cabs over to a day rave, where, jacked up on another half-gram of 
coke or hit of Ecstasy, they continue to dance until 2 or 3 in the 
afternoon, then pass out on the beach for a few hours before doing the 
whole thing again.

Across town, in the West End, soccer hooligans and construction workers 
spend their evenings downing pitchers of Sex on the Beach, gawking at the 
abundance of cleavage on display, making clumsy attempts to appropriate it 
for the night, then staggering home alone, only to wake up face down in a 
gutter.

You would expect the typical evangelical Christian to be horrified by 
Ibiza. But the 24-7 Prayer missionaries aren't your typical evangelicals. 
They tend to be pierced and tattooed, antiwar and pro-fair trade, and the 
minute they get off prayer duty, they put on halter tops and body glitter 
and wristbands and go clubbing until noon the next day. They might even 
have a drink or two. They don't do drugs -- which alone sets them apart 
from most ravers. Most eschew premarital sex, although they try not be 
judgmental about others' sexual behavior. Like all missionaries, they want 
to be down with the people whom they're preaching to, but in the case of 
24-7, they're not faking it. The primary difference between the average 
Ibiza clubber and a 24-7 missionary is what gets them off. "To know that 
the God who made the heavens and the earth loves me and wants to know me -- 
that's an amazing high that lasts much more than a few hours," says Bruce 
Gardiner-Crehan, 25, a 24-7 missionary with the beatific countenance of a 
<http://archive.salon.com/books/review/1999/07/15/langdon>Caravaggio 
apostle. As members of a generation that came of age with house music, the 
24-7 Prayer team finds it a lot easier to commune with God while dancing at 
a rave than while kneeling in a church, listening to an organist drone on.

It's not that the 24-7 missionaries don't see the devil lurking in Ibiza. 
They know he's there. And they plan to do something about it -- by bringing 
God into the clubs with them so other ravers can feel his presence, too. As 
born-again Christians, they view the whole world as a battleground between 
God and Satan; but in Ibiza, the struggle is concentrated. Their role, as 
they see it, is to wrest the island from Satan's clutches and help deposit 
it safely back in God's hands. "Ibiza offers a drug option, a sex option, a 
clubbing option -- everything but a God option," says Vicky Ward, 30, who 
came to Ibiza with 24-7's first mission team five years ago. "I'd like to 
think if we gave people that option, some of them would choose it."

24-7 Prayer's mission to Ibiza grew out of a prayer movement that was 
itself inspired by rave culture. The movement was launched in 1999 as an 
around-the-clock worship session in a warehouse in southern England, with 
Moby playing on a boombox and 22-year-olds showing up at 3 a.m. to dance 
and pray and shout out to God. The intention was to pray in shifts all day, 
every day, for a month; it went on for almost four. Today there are prayer 
rooms in 55 countries, including 130 in the United States.

"We had a sense that people would be more excited about praying at 3 a.m. 
on a Thursday than they would at 11 a.m. on a Sunday," says Pete Greig, the 
35-year-old pastor who helped found the 24-7 Prayer movement. "Young people 
are drawn to extremes." Greig himself isn't a raver -- he's a family man, 
vaguely bookish in his wire-rimmed glasses and oxford shirts. But he's 
savvy enough to know that he's not going to get the next generation excited 
about Jesus by throwing mixers in the church basement. He and his 24-7 
colleagues are doing their best to make Jesus relevant, whether through 
trendy gear (dog tags and hoodies inscribed with fragments of Scripture) or 
seminars offering tips for praying online and missions to what Greig calls 
the "high places of youth culture." For the past five years, 24-7 
missionaries have been taking the gospel to skate parks and music festivals 
in the U.K., as well to party destinations around the world such as Puerto 
Escondido, Mexico, a surfing and 'shrooming mecca, and Ayia Napa, Cyprus, 
the hip-hop fan's version of Ibiza.

In August, Greig embarked on his own mission: He moved his family of four 
from England to Kansas City, Kan., to set up a 24-7 Prayer base in the 
United States, where he will doubtless find fertile ground. For the past 
decade, the evangelical movement has been attracting American students in 
record numbers, and a 2003 Gallup poll estimated that a hefty 46 percent of 
Americans consider themselves evangelicals.

For the moment, though, 24-7 is primarily a European movement -- which may 
be why its form of evangelism seems looser than the 
<http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2002/01/29/statues.htm>Ashcroftian 
brand that winces at topless statues. Of the two dozen 24-7 missionaries 
who traveled to Ibiza this summer, only two were American: Heather and 
Jonah Bailey, a young married couple who provide moral support and guidance 
to the prayer teams. Even they don't fall cleanly under the umbrella of 
U.S. evangelicalism. They hail from Bakersfield, Calif., but they live in 
Seville, Spain; and they're vehemently anti-George W. Bush.

Dismayed by Christianity's diminishing influence in the postmodern world, 
24-7 dreams of sparking a worldwide revival among the generation that is 
coming of age. Its goal: to turn the tide in youth culture from what Greig 
calls a "godless, materialistic, self-destructive force" to a generation 
that loves and worships Jesus. "For centuries, Christians were among the 
major architects of culture," Greig reminded 100 members of his flock at 
24-7's annual conference in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, in September 2003. 
"Today," he challenges, "are we even on the map?"

This year, 24-7 Prayer has sent two types of prayer teams to Ibiza. 
Short-term teams come for two weeks, and they take the blitzkrieg approach 
to evangelism -- strolling up to drunken strangers in the West End and 
offering to pray for them. Long-term team members settle in Ibiza for the 
whole summer, and they're less direct about their intentions. Their 
approach seems inspired by a bit of Scripture from Matthew, found on the 
last page of the 24-7 Prayer Manual that all missionaries are encouraged to 
read. "I am sending you out like sheep among wolves," it says. "Therefore 
be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves." The teams infiltrate the 
community, working as club promoters and waitresses, initiating friendships 
and doing good deeds. Eventually, they hope, they'll find an opportunity to 
slip in a few words about Jesus.

"Telling people right away that you're here on mission can impede 
friendships," says Ward, "because as soon as you say that, people begin to 
worry that you're going to start preaching to them, or to wonder what your 
ulterior motive is. But the people we're friends with know that's not what 
we're about." She smiles slyly. "Not always."

When the prayer team reaches the Bull Bar, the rest of the 24-7 
missionaries are milling around outside, looking dejected. They've just 
gotten some bad news: DJ Riley has been sacked, and the fruit handout is 
off. Business has been flagging, so the 25-year-old Czech woman who manages 
the bar has come up with a new marketing strategy: She'll be replacing 
Riley's house music with the kind of cheesy '80s hits that inspire 
inebriated people to dance. From now on, touts will offer a free drink to 
any woman who comes in and dances.

Ejected from their base of operations, the prayer team trudges down the 
West End's sticky cobblestone street to a fountain where a trio of 
musicians is playing jaunty Balearic folk music. They form a prayer huddle 
and ask God for some advice. Gardiner-Crehan wonders if they should just 
give up. "It's OK if that's what you want, Lord, it's really cool." 
Twenty-two-year-old Katie Crossley asks God to bind up the demons in the 
Bull Bar, to foil their plans to boost business by selling sex. Joslin 
tries to think positive: "I'm sure you're up to something cool behind the 
scenes, God, something that we just can't see." She seems less dismayed 
than the rest of the group. Dismayed isn't her style. She has a mercurial, 
"wildest girl at the party" energy about her, anchored in a rigorous 
morality. Her mother was a "Ban the Bomb" hippie. She was also a devout 
Christian who forbade Joslin to wear a bikini.

After about 20 minutes of pleading and questioning and praising, the prayer 
team is rejuvenated. They set out again, striding purposefully up the West 
End's main drag. At the top of the hill, where the herds of partyers begin 
to thin out, they run into Gary.

Before setting out that night, the team made lists of people they'd met 
previously in the West End whom they hoped to encounter: These are their 
salvation prospects, their unwitting partners in a sort of spiritual buddy 
system. At the top of Gardiner-Crehan's list was Gary. He's a tout for one 
of the trendy clubs in Ibiza Town, and he's handsome the way a Ken doll is: 
well-groomed hair, clean Aryan features. Gardiner-Crehan asks if there's 
anything he can pray about for him. Gary shakes his head, polite but 
reticent. "Don't think so. It's all good, thanks." But Gardiner-Crehan 
isn't giving up. "Anything I can get you to help your night go better? You 
need an ice cream, something, to keep up your energy?"

Gary looks surprised. "Sure, man, that'd be cool."

Heading back down the hill in search of ice cream, they spot another 
salvation prospect. Jonney Silvester, 22, is standing in front of Ground 
Zero, the rock club where he works as a promoter. His dark hair is scraped 
back in a ponytail, his nails are painted black, and he has a serious 
eyebrow piercing. Silvester's name cropped up on a couple of people's 
prayer rosters. Franklin had him on her list. So did a guy named Tom Godec, 
a soft-spoken 21-year-old with the icy good looks of a Calvin Klein model: 
shaved head, searing blue eyes, silver stud in his chin. "The first time I 
talked to Jonney, it was a bit intimidating," says Godec, "because he looks 
like quite a hard guy. But he's very open. We've had some good talks about 
religion."

Godec is relatively new to Christianity, and he still seems slightly 
self-conscious talking about it. He tends to use a lot of qualifiers. Godec 
found Jesus at age 17, after a girlfriend broke his heart. "This is kind of 
embarrassing," he says, "but I was so lonely I asked my mom to sleep in my 
room for three nights." Picking up on Godec's despair, a friend invited him 
to go to church with him. He said it might lift Godec's spirits. He was 
right. "People at the church nurtured me for who I am," he says. "It sounds 
cheesy, but it's the truth."

Franklin and Godec aren't sure Silvester is ready to be prayed for, so when 
they see him, they keep the conversation light and nonthreatening: They ask 
him how his night is going and what he's doing when he gets off work. "We 
don't want to do cold-calling evangelism," says Godec. "We try to meet 
people where they're at."

The missionaries know that proselytizing about damnation is no way to make 
friends and influence people -- particularly since their audience has come 
to Ibiza to indulge in carnal pleasures. Better, then, to ease people in by 
emphasizing the altruistic side of their work. When asked what they do, the 
24-7 missionaries generally tell people that they're with a Christian 
charity that cleans beaches, that sort of thing. If the listener asks more 
questions, he or she will get more answers. Most don't. A lot of bar 
promoters in the West End think of 24-7 as a bunch of nice Christian kids 
who hand out fruit, nothing more.

Giving away prayer and refreshments may not be the fast track to winning 
converts, but it seems to move things along. By the end of the prayer walk, 
Gary has invited Gardiner-Crehan to go with him to a club promoters party 
later that week, and a tout named Simba has offered to help him clean the 
beach.

The other missionaries aren't quite as fortunate. They weave through the 
crowds in groups of two, asking to pray for one bar promoter after another, 
most of whom are already trashed by midnight. They talk to Simon, who says 
it's too late for prayers because he's already broken every one of the Ten 
Commandments; to Rupert, who forms a crucifix with his index fingers to 
ward them off; and to Claire, a diminutive blond in taxicab yellow pumps. 
One of the missionaries asks if she can pray for her, and Claire says, 
"What a nice question." For a moment, it seems as if Claire might cry. Then 
she says, "Can you pray that I find 1,000 pounds?"

Evangelizing among the wasted can have its benefits, though. People who 
might otherwise tell you to piss off are a little more open, a little 
friendlier. Last week, Gardiner-Crehan had one of the biggest breakthroughs 
of the mission at the Bull Bar. At around 1 a.m., he tried to start a 
conversation with a trio of brooding guys hovering over their pints. Nothing.

Within an hour, one member of the trio, Matt, sought out Gardiner-Crehan on 
the dance floor and greeted him like they were old buddies. "They'd taken 
some Ecstasy and it must have kicked in, because he became incredibly 
friendly," says Gardiner-Crehan. Suddenly, no topic was off-limits: They 
talked about music, about school and finally, finally, about religion.

Matt must have gone back to his table raving about the second coming of 
Christ because the next thing Gardiner-Crehan knew, Matt's friend Brian 
approached him. He wanted to let Gardiner-Crehan know that he had a bum leg 
and couldn't walk properly. "I told him that I believe that Jesus can heal 
people," says Gardiner-Crehan, "and I asked if I could pray for him."

Ten minutes later, the third guy, John, took Gardiner-Crehan aside for a 
full-on spiritual counseling session. He told the missionary he was 
terrified of dying and that he couldn't sleep. He'd been seeing a counselor 
for two years, but nothing helped. "By then, I was going for it," says 
Gardiner-Crehan. "I said, 'Listen: I believe Jesus can touch your life if 
you let him. Can I pray for you?" John was happy to submit. Afterward, 
Gardiner-Crehan advised John to get himself to a church as soon as he got 
back home. "I said, 'You need to find some people you can talk to about 
Jesus.'" They all bear-hugged Gardiner-Crehan goodbye, and the next day, 
the three guys got on a plane back to England.

Among his peers, Gardiner-Crehan is known as a crack evangelist. His 
tremulous excitement about his faith seems to transcend any 
self-consciousness he might have about spreading the Word. Where some of 
the other missionaries are fettered by inhibition from time to time ("Hey, 
we like to look cool, too," says Franklin), Gardiner-Crehan is 
irrepressible: He doesn't seem to think twice about approaching the 
fiercest-looking person in the West End and offering up a prayer. Of 
course, he's hardly an amateur when it comes to evangelizing. Born into the 
charismatic church, and educated at Bible college, Gardiner-Crehan went on 
his first mission at age 16. Ibiza is his fifteenth.

Still, he feels a bit frustrated at having only two weeks in Ibiza. He'd 
like to move beyond a few powerful prayers. He'd like to have his own 
Andres Isea story.

Isea is 24-7's trophy boy, the mission's one bona fide convert. After four 
years of cleaning beaches and massaging strangers' feet and escorting 
drunken people to their hotels, the 24-7 missionaries finally reaped a 
little harvest this year.

Restless and itching to see the world, Isea left his native Venezuela at 18 
and has been living in Spain ever since, scraping together a living, 
bouncing from one wretched apartment to the next, with intermittent periods 
living on the street. Isea is the kind of guy that backpacker chicks go 
crazy for. There is something raw and untamed about him: His hair is wild 
and full, his nose is pierced, and he wears a string of puka shells around 
his neck and the laces of his trainers untied. The church he attends is 
constantly harassing him to cut his hair and take out his piercings, but he 
refuses. "I'll do it when God tells me to," he says. "Not before."

When the 24-7 prayer team met Isea last summer, he was living in a squat, 
shilling for the Bull Bar and dealing drugs. He was doing a lot of drugs, 
too -- popping pills, smoking pot, and snorting coke. "I was really 
disappointed with myself," says Isea. "I'd left Venezuela because I wanted 
to avoid all that."

Isea was disarmed by the 24-7 missionaries. They weren't like the other 
Christians he'd met, who were quick to judge him. "The more bad stuff they 
saw me do, the closer they got to me," he says. "If I was drugged up, they 
would grab me, put their hands on my head and pray for me."

Before leaving Ibiza, three members of the prayer team invited Isea to a 
cafe to talk about God. One of them felt he was getting a prophetic word 
from God for Isea, and he passed it along: God wanted Isea to know that he 
was his son, and that he was pleased with him and loved him. "To be 
honest," Isea says, "I wasn't sure if it was God or that guy who was 
speaking, but it was stuff I needed to hear." Isea broke down crying and, 
to the surprise of the tourists sipping cappuccinos around him, yelled out, 
"I need you, God!"

For a couple of months after the 24-7 team left, Isea tried to hang out 
with churchgoing folks and stay straight, but life kept getting in the way. 
He lost his job at the Bull Bar. His roommate was shot to death while on 
holiday in Switzerland. He thought about giving up the whole Christian 
thing, about going to the Canary Islands and giving himself over to 
partying again. But he decided to give God one last chance. "I made a deal 
with God; I said: God, I'll stay in Ibiza, and do the best I can to seek 
you, but you've got to take care of me."

God came through. Within a couple of weeks, Isea got a job as a stripper 
one night a week. He earned about $50 a week, barely enough to live on, but 
it left him plenty of time to pray and read the Bible. He began going to 
church again, and a 24-7 missionary named Tim Hirst continued to e-mail 
him, encouraging him to stay the course.

When Hirst returned to Ibiza this summer and called Isea, the first thing 
Isea wanted to do was pray together. Hirst was thrilled. Now instead of 
hanging out at the Bull Bar, they hang out at the prayer room that 24-7 has 
established, sitting on the floor with their arms around each other and a 
Bible between them.

There are Christians who look at the 24-7 missionaries and say what they 
are doing is ungodly, even dangerous. "Dressing up sexy and going out 
dancing -- what kind of example are you setting?" they say. "You look just 
like the rest of the sinners." In the 24-7 prayer room, Ward met an older 
man one afternoon who thought she should be wearing a hair shirt. "Can you 
imagine?" she says. She considers it for a minute. "Actually, it might be a 
scream."

Yet image consciousness is a question that 24-7 missionaries themselves 
have wrestled with. Twenty-five-year-old Lora Thomson, a long-term team 
member from Edinburgh, Scotland, who looks like she could be fronting an 
indie rock band, with her stubby pigtails and silver nose ring, used to 
believe that being a good Christian meant renouncing her trendy look and 
her passion for clubbing. "I thought I would have to be single forever and 
live in Africa and wear unflattering tops. I was totally not up for it." To 
prove her devotion, however, she decided to succumb. First she stopped 
buying music. Then she vowed to stop clubbing. But the biggest challenge 
was taking out her piercings. In the middle of a Christian students 
meeting, she heard God command her to take out first her nose ring, then 
her navel ring. When he told her to take out her five earrings, though, she 
put up a fight. "I said, 'This is getting ridiculous, God. Everybody has 
pierced ears.'" But God wasn't letting her off the hook. "Take them out," 
she heard him say. "Your identity is in me, not in what you wear." When it 
was over, she looked at the jewelry in her hand and burst into tears. "I 
couldn't believe I had been deriving all of my self-confidence from this 
little pile of metal."

Four years later, her nose ring safely back in place, Thomson no longer 
feels as if she's compromising her faith by looking trendy. "If you're 
willing to sacrifice something, God will always give it back to you," she 
says. Thanks to 24-7, she now sees that clubbing and Christianity are 
compatible, even complementary. "When I go clubbing, I know God is there, 
and I try to work with him, to keep him company," she says. "I can sense 
the pain of the people dancing around me, and I pray for them." 
Occasionally, however, she'll be in a club, and she won't feel God in the 
atmosphere at all. That worries her. "If God isn't there," she says, "it 
means his opposite is. The devil."

That's what the prayer team sensed one night when they went dancing at El 
Divino, a sprawling club on the Ibiza harbor, where VIP clients cruise up 
to the door in their yachts.

The music felt dark, oppressive. Women were gyrating and thrusting and 
running their hands over their bodies, and men were lapping it up. To 
combat that, Ward split up the prayer team into two groups, and they all 
prayed for God to make his presence felt. Joslin waved her hand over the 
crowd. Ward closed her eyes and opened her palms to the sky. Most of the 
prayer team members just seemed to be dancing, though. To the naked eye, 
they looked like any other clubber in the room, lost in the music and the 
darkness and the confusion of flickering lights.

Twenty minutes into their prayer session, the tenor of the music began to 
shift. The missionaries thought it sounded lighter, more joyous. OK, they 
conceded, it might have had something to do with the change of DJ. But what 
about that line she sampled from the Hallelujah Chorus, "King of kings, and 
Lord of lords," looping it over and over? If that wasn't a sign that God 
was in the house, they didn't know what was.

- - - - - - - - - - - -

The evening of the short-term team's final prayer walk, the prayer room is 
on fire. Exultant worship music plays on the boombox. Joslin lies on the 
floor, pounding it with her fists. In the corner, Gardiner-Crehan is having 
a fervent one-on-one with God. The walls are covered in prophetic paintings 
that the team has made over the week, depicting what they believe God wants 
for Ibiza. One is an oceanic swirl of blue and green. Another portrays 
revelers in the West End leaping joyously from cages.

The missionaries have a goal tonight: They want to tell everyone they've 
been praying for that they're not just a bunch of nice people who give out 
fruit. They want to tell them that they came to Ibiza because of Jesus. 
It's their last night. They have nothing to lose.

That said, giving out fruit is a great way to start a conversation, and 
they still have loads of it left over from the other night, when they were 
banned from the Bull Bar. They stroll through the West End like Earth-bound 
flight attendants, plastic trays poised on their hands, asking, again and 
again, "Free fruit? You like some fruit?" Some people look at them 
suspiciously. But most grab at it, taking three, four pieces, shoving them 
ravenously into their mouths. "There isn't any vodka in it," they mumble to 
one another, disappointed.

Gardiner-Crehan is standing near the corner where he last saw Gary, 
scanning the street anxiously. "I really hope to see Gary tonight," he 
says. "I want to tell him that I'm here because Jesus died for our sins. 
That's why I gave him the ice cream." He flashes a smile at one of the 
touts from the Bull Bar, offering her a candy heart that says, "You're 
Fab," but his trademark enthusiasm seems to be flagging. Gary is nowhere in 
sight. Neither is Simba, the guy who offered to clean the beaches two 
nights ago.

Silvester is out, though, loping around in front of Ground Zero in a 
Marilyn Manson T-shirt, occasionally shouting out, "Rock and full, mother 
fuckers!" to passersby. Godec strolls down the hill to say goodbye and tell 
him that the prayer team is leaving the next day. "That's too bad," 
Silvester says. "Yeah," Godec says. They're both quiet for a minute. Then, 
before he can think about it too much, Godec takes the plunge. He tells 
Silvester that God loves him.

"I know it sounds kind of cheesy," Godec says, when he recalls the 
conversation later, at a place called the Beaver Bar, where two fellow 
missionaries are sharing a farewell shot of Sprite with their favorite 
bartender. "But it was really important to me that he hear that before I 
left." I ask him how Silvester reacted. "Well, he didn't scowl. But he 
didn't give his life to Jesus or anything."

For the rest of the missionaries, however, the final prayer walk is a bit 
of a letdown. There are no prophetic words from God that night, no moving 
prayer requests. There is nothing to do but change out of their 24-7 
T-shirts and into their rave gear and go clubbing.

- - - - - - - - - - - -

A couple of days after the short-term team leaves, I visit Silvester in the 
sock-strewn apartment he shares with two roommates over Ground Zero. It's 7 
p.m. He has just woken up and pulled on a pair of jeans, but his shirt is 
off and he has a bar code tattooed on his back, with the word "Rejected" 
underneath. On either side of it, riding the swell of his deltoids, are two 
black angel wings.

As it turns out, Silvester knows a thing or two about Christianity. He was 
raised a Jehovah's Witness. It was a miserable experience. Forbidden from 
hanging out with outsiders, he found himself virtually friendless. At 17, 
he finally wrote his parents a letter telling them he was leaving the 
faith, and their house. Needless to say, he's not very big on religion.

"But I really liked the prayer guys," he says. "They were always sober, and 
they seemed to care about other people. They were like an oasis of sanity 
on the craziest street in the world."

I ask him how he felt when Godec told him that God loved him, and he 
laughs, a low-pitched ha-ha-ha, each syllable distinct. "I don't know," he 
says. "It's a nice thought, but I don't really believe in God." Over his 
head is a poster of flames shooting up from the earth, the word "Lucifer" 
floating above them; across from that, a drawing of a winking skull reads, 
"Freedom From Slavery." So it doesn't bother him that they want to convert 
him? He laughs again, and takes a drag of his hand-rolled cigarette. "Not 
at all," he says. "I don't think it will work. But I won't hold it against 
them."

> "We had a sense that people would be more excited about praying at 3 a.m.
> on a Thursday than they would at 11 a.m. on a Sunday," says Pete Greig, the
> 35-year-old pastor who helped found the 24-7 Prayer movement. "Young people
> are drawn to extremes." Greig himself isn't a raver -- he's a family man,
> vaguely bookish in his wire-rimmed glasses and oxford shirts. But he's
> savvy enough to know that he's not going to get the next generation excited
> about Jesus by throwing mixers in the church basement. He and his 24-7
> colleagues are doing their best to make Jesus relevant, whether through
> trendy gear (dog tags and hoodies inscribed with fragments of Scripture) or
> seminars offering tips for praying online and missions to what Greig calls
> the "high places of youth culture." For the past five years, 24-7
> missionaries have been taking the gospel to skate parks and music festivals
> in the U.K., as well to party destinations around the world such as Puerto
> Escondido, Mexico, a surfing and 'shrooming mecca, and Ayia Napa, Cyprus,
> the hip-hop fan's version of Ibiza.
>
> In August, Greig embarked on his own mission: He moved his family of four
> from England to Kansas City, Kan., to set up a 24-7 Prayer base in the
> United States, where he will doubtless find fertile ground. For the past
> decade, the evangelical movement has been attracting American students in
> record numbers, and a 2003 Gallup poll estimated that a hefty 46 percent of
> Americans consider themselves evangelicals.
>
> For the moment, though, 24-7 is primarily a European movement -- which may
> be why its form of evangelism seems looser than the
> <http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2002/01/29/statues.htm>Ashcroftian
> brand that winces at topless statues. Of the two dozen 24-7 missionaries
> who traveled to Ibiza this summer, only two were American: Heather and
> Jonah Bailey, a young married couple who provide moral support and guidance
> to the prayer teams. Even they don't fall cleanly under the umbrella of
> U.S. evangelicalism. They hail from Bakersfield, Calif., but they live in
> Seville, Spain; and they're vehemently anti-George W. Bush.
>
> Dismayed by Christianity's diminishing influence in the postmodern world,
> 24-7 dreams of sparking a worldwide revival among the generation that is
> coming of age. Its goal: to turn the tide in youth culture from what Greig
> calls a "godless, materialistic, self-destructive force" to a generation
> that loves and worships Jesus. "For centuries, Christians were among the
> major architects of culture," Greig reminded 100 members of his flock at
> 24-7's annual conference in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, in September 2003.
> "Today," he challenges, "are we even on the map?"
>
> This year, 24-7 Prayer has sent two types of prayer teams to Ibiza.
> Short-term teams come for two weeks, and they take the blitzkrieg approach
> to evangelism -- strolling up to drunken strangers in the West End and
> offering to pray for them. Long-term team members settle in Ibiza for the
> whole summer, and they're less direct about their intentions. Their
> approach seems inspired by a bit of Scripture from Matthew, found on the
> last page of the 24-7 Prayer Manual that all missionaries are encouraged to
> read. "I am sending you out like sheep among wolves," it says. "Therefore
> be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves." The teams infiltrate the
> community, working as club promoters and waitresses, initiating friendships
> and doing good deeds. Eventually, they hope, they'll find an opportunity to
> slip in a few words about Jesus.
>
> "Telling people right away that you're here on mission can impede
> friendships," says Ward, "because as soon as you say that, people begin to
> worry that you're going to start preaching to them, or to wonder what your
> ulterior motive is. But the people we're friends with know that's not what
> we're about." She smiles slyly. "Not always."
>
> When the prayer team reaches the Bull Bar, the rest of the 24-7
> missionaries are milling around outside, looking dejected. They've just
> gotten some bad news: DJ Riley has been sacked, and the fruit handout is
> off. Business has been flagging, so the 25-year-old Czech woman who manages
> the bar has come up with a new marketing strategy: She'll be replacing
> Riley's house music with the kind of cheesy '80s hits that inspire
> inebriated people to dance. From now on, touts will offer a free drink to
> any woman who comes in and dances.
>
> Ejected from their base of operations, the prayer team trudges down the
> West End's sticky cobblestone street to a fountain where a trio of
> musicians is playing jaunty Balearic folk music. They form a prayer huddle
> and ask God for some advice. Gardiner-Crehan wonders if they should just
> give up. "It's OK if that's what you want, Lord, it's really cool."
> Twenty-two-year-old Katie Crossley asks God to bind up the demons in the
> Bull Bar, to foil their plans to boost business by selling sex. Joslin
> tries to think positive: "I'm sure you're up to something cool behind the

> than the rest of the group. Dismayed isn't her style. She has a mercurial,
> "wildest girl at the party" energy about her, anchored in a rigorous
> morality. Her mother was a "Ban the Bomb" hippie. She was also a devout
> Christian who forbade Joslin to wear a bikini.
>
> After about 20 minutes of pleading and questioning and praising, the prayer
> team is rejuvenated. They set out again, striding purposefully up the West
> End's main drag. At the top of the hill, where the herds of partyers begin
> to thin out, they run into Gary.
>
> Before setting out that night, the team made lists of people they'd met
> previously in the West End whom they hoped to encounter: These are their
> salvation prospects, their unwitting partners in a sort of spiritual buddy
> system. At the top of Gardiner-Crehan's list was Gary. He's a tout for one

> well-groomed hair, clean Aryan features. Gardiner-Crehan asks if there's

> isn't giving up. "Anything I can get you to help your night go better? You
> need an ice cream, something, to keep up your energy?"
>
> Gary looks surprised. "Sure, man, that'd be cool."
>
> Heading back down the hill in search of ice cream, they spot another
> salvation prospect. Jonney Silvester, 22, is standing in front of Ground
> Zero, the rock club where he works as a promoter. His dark hair is scraped
> back in a ponytail, his nails are painted black, and he has a serious
> eyebrow piercing. Silvester's name cropped up on a couple of people's
> prayer rosters. Franklin had him on her list. So did a guy named Tom Godec,
> a soft-spoken 21-year-old with the icy good looks of a Calvin Klein model:
> shaved head, searing blue eyes, silver stud in his chin. "The first time I
> talked to Jonney, it was a bit intimidating," says Godec, "because he looks
> like quite a hard guy. But he's very open. We've had some good talks about
> religion."
>
> Godec is relatively new to Christianity, and he still seems slightly
> self-conscious talking about it. He tends to use a lot of qualifiers. Godec
> found Jesus at age 17, after a girlfriend broke his heart. "This is kind of
> embarrassing," he says, "but I was so lonely I asked my mom to sleep in my
> room for three nights." Picking up on Godec's despair, a friend invited him
> to go to church with him. He said it might lift Godec's spirits. He was
> right. "People at the church nurtured me for who I am," he says. "It sounds
> cheesy, but it's the truth."
>
> Franklin and Godec aren't sure Silvester is ready to be prayed for, so when
> they see him, they keep the conversation light and nonthreatening: They ask

>
> The missionaries know that proselytizing about damnation is no way to make
> friends and influence people -- particularly since their audience has come

> Gary has invited Gardiner-Crehan to go with him to a club promoters party

>
> The other missionaries aren't quite as fortunate. They weave through the

>
> Within an hour, one member of the trio, Matt, sought out Gardiner-Crehan on

> some Ecstasy and it must have kicked in, because he became incredibly

> talked about music, about school and finally, finally, about religion.
>
> Matt must have gone back to his table raving about the second coming of
> Christ because the next thing Gardiner-Crehan knew, Matt's friend Brian
> approached him. He wanted to let Gardiner-Crehan know that he had a bum leg
> and couldn't walk properly. "I told him that I believe that Jesus can heal
> people," says Gardiner-Crehan, "and I asked if I could pray for him."
>
> Ten minutes later, the third guy, John, took Gardiner-Crehan aside for a
> full-on spiritual counseling session. He told the missionary he was
> terrified of dying and that he couldn't sleep. He'd been seeing a counselor
> for two years, but nothing helped. "By then, I was going for it," says
> Gardiner-Crehan. "I said, 'Listen: I believe Jesus can touch your life if

> Gardiner-Crehan advised John to get himself to a church as soon as he got
> back home. "I said, 'You need to find some people you can talk to about
> Jesus.'" They all bear-hugged Gardiner-Crehan goodbye, and the next day,
> the three guys got on a plane back to England.
>
> Among his peers, Gardiner-Crehan is known as a crack evangelist. His
> tremulous excitement about his faith seems to transcend any
> self-consciousness he might have about spreading the Word. Where some of

> charismatic church, and educated at Bible college, Gardiner-Crehan went on
> his first mission at age 16. Ibiza is his fifteenth.
>
> Still, he feels a bit frustrated at having only two weeks in Ibiza. He'd
> like to move beyond a few powerful prayers. He'd like to have his own
> Andres Isea story.
>
> Isea is 24-7's trophy boy, the mission's one bona fide convert. After four
> years of cleaning beaches and massaging strangers' feet and escorting
> drunken people to their hotels, the 24-7 missionaries finally reaped a
> little harvest this year.
>
> Restless and itching to see the world, Isea left his native Venezuela at 18
> and has been living in Spain ever since, scraping together a living,
> bouncing from one wretched apartment to the next, with intermittent periods
> living on the street. Isea is the kind of guy that backpacker chicks go
> crazy for. There is something raw and untamed about him: His hair is wild
> and full, his nose is pierced, and he wears a string of puka shells around
> his neck and the laces of his trainers untied. The church he attends is
> constantly harassing him to cut his hair and take out his piercings, but he
> refuses. "I'll do it when God tells me to," he says. "Not before."
>
> When the 24-7 prayer team met Isea last summer, he was living in a squat,
> shilling for the Bull Bar and dealing drugs. He was doing a lot of drugs,
> too -- popping pills, smoking pot, and snorting coke. "I was really
> disappointed with myself," says Isea. "I'd left Venezuela because I wanted
> to avoid all that."
>
> Isea was disarmed by the 24-7 missionaries. They weren't like the other
> Christians he'd met, who were quick to judge him. "The more bad stuff they
> saw me do, the closer they got to me," he says. "If I was drugged up, they
> would grab me, put their hands on my head and pray for me."
>
> Before leaving Ibiza, three members of the prayer team invited Isea to a
> cafe to talk about God. One of them felt he was getting a prophetic word
> from God for Isea, and he passed it along: God wanted Isea to know that he
> was his son, and that he was pleased with him and loved him. "To be
> honest," Isea says, "I wasn't sure if it was God or that guy who was
> speaking, but it was stuff I needed to hear." Isea broke down crying and,
> to the surprise of the tourists sipping cappuccinos around him, yelled out,
> "I need you, God!"
>
> For a couple of months after the 24-7 team left, Isea tried to hang out
> with churchgoing folks and stay straight, but life kept getting in the way.
> He lost his job at the Bull Bar. His roommate was shot to death while on
> holiday in Switzerland. He thought about giving up the whole Christian
> thing, about going to the Canary Islands and giving himself over to
> partying again. But he decided to give God one last chance. "I made a deal
> with God; I said: God, I'll stay in Ibiza, and do the best I can to seek
> you, but you've got to take care of me."
>
> God came through. Within a couple of weeks, Isea got a job as a stripper
> one night a week. He earned about $50 a week, barely enough to live on, but
> it left him plenty of time to pray and read the Bible. He began going to
> church again, and a 24-7 missionary named Tim Hirst continued to e-mail
> him, encouraging him to stay the course.
>
> When Hirst returned to Ibiza this summer and called Isea, the first thing
> Isea wanted to do was pray together. Hirst was thrilled. Now instead of
> hanging out at the Bull Bar, they hang out at the prayer room that 24-7 has

> Bible between them.

Isn't that the God's honest fucking truth?

I'm the same way, though this isn't a BitTorrent question.

There's a Strip Club directly in front of my office here in DC, about
3 blocks from the White House, called Archibald's, (some of them are
pretty cool, here's one girl's LJ that I found yesterday,
http://tinyurl.com/4c2rh too bad she just retired, damn), and we share
a loading dock area out back.

Well it looks like they've upgraded their sound system because about a
month or so I snagged not one but two Bose=AE Wave=AE radios that they
were shit-canning.

Took 'em home plugged 'em in and they've both got major issues, which
explains why they tossed them.

I pulled the case off of one of them and it's all motherboarded out
under the hood.

A Google search didn't turn up the specs I needed and i'm wondering if
anyone knows how I can bypass the motherboard and just run a signal of
my own through the it to the speakers and bypass their shite?

Ideally, I'd like to keep the integrity of the casing together, since
I believe that's a contributor to the deep rich sound that's its main
selling point.

To all you propeller-heads out there in sfraves land thanks in advance!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] appreciating SF right now...

Just out of curiosity, what aspect[s] of New York does SF compare 
favorably to?

I was only ever in New York City for an extended weekend, and I loved 
it, though missed SF when I was there... We went to some club that was 
supposed to be good, and it was god-awful; way too crowded and we had to 
wait over an hour just to check our coats.  Suffice it to say I missed 
SF where a coat would've been optional in the first place :p

New York seemed really alive to me, though, so I wouldn't say SF blows 
it away... Though I think I'd prefer living in SF any day :)

Hayes and Fillmore?  Kind of a strange spot.  What
else is up there?

It was our Sunday ritual after going out to eat at
Fritz with my whole family (there are 5 and soon 6 of
us) and then listening/buying records at BPM.  

Not sure I can drag the whole crew up that hill...

Peace,

Peter

you could always modify the ritual to include lunch at Axum (Ethiopian

It only takes 20 years for a liberal to become a conservative without 
changing a single idea.
In an evolving universe, who stands still moves backwards.

Anyone have information on the NYE lineup for Otherworld? I mean, just the
fact that it's Otherworld makes my weewee tingle... but what's the deal?
I've got free tickets to a couple shindigs that night, but my gut instinct
says GO TO OAKLAND AND BE REDEEMED.

Please inform. It is December 13th. NYE is only a couple weeks away.
Communicate, Otherworld.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] appreciating SF right now...

I was born and raised in NYC but haven't live there in over a decade,
so I missed the transformations that IL Duce Rudi Ghouliani/Mussolini
inflicted on the place.

The Disnyification of NYC sucked the very spirit that made NYC NYC
right out of it.

A real tragedy.

This was driven home one night at 3 am in Coney island on a visit a
few summers back.

it was a magically beautiful night and we were the only ones on the beach.

my friend who lived there told me before Mussolini took over on a
night like that thousands of people would be out enjoying themselves,
but now it was just a few brave folks, since nobody likes being
hassled by the cops.

I will say that I was blessed to grow up there when i did, and
incredibly lucky that my folks moved to Staten Island early in my
childhood. I lived in a nice house by a golf course in the greenest
part of the 5 boroughs and was a 25 minute boat ride away from
everything.

Wouldn't trade that experience for anything.

Lived in SF/Palo Alto for about a dozen years all told and also I
wouldn't trade that for the werld, had some mad good times.

Both have their merits.

The way I view SF is that Interstate 80 is this huge snake that
swallowed NYC and SF is what came out the other end.

:D

unfortunatley we had to change our plans and we're not
selling online.   however we have tickets at Skills
(Berkeley), Distractions (SF), Solid Grooves (SJ),
OtherWorld (Oakland), and several FnF peeps in the
city have tickets.  
e-mail me if you want to come by OW for tickets.

causes me to tremble for the safety of my country. . . . corporations
have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places will follow,
and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong its reign by
working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth is aggregated
in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed."

You know I was going to go to this other party where Richard Simmons was 
going to do a live PA on top of Grace Jone's flat top, but I think I will 
settle for this one.  It just seems like I will be able to dance a bit 
more...
Watch out kids, I will be there in full effect  ;)
Danny
Great lineup you guys!

oh, i don't know about that.... granted, it IS
overpriced.  and the city's really come down on the
nightlife.  but the food!  (pizza,
bagels....mmmm...)the architecture!  the seasons!  the
energy!  people out in the streets!  the proximity to
beaches you can actually swim in!  (yes, i've swum at
baker beach, but compared to the jersey shore?  forget
it. it's warm there!)  the new york accent!  

i appreciate sf right now, but my heart's still in ny.
 it's not perfect, and there's reasons i don't live
there, but holy-hell it is not.

Eh - the Pizza does rock much ass (there's a joint on 2nd in the Bowery near
Satellite Records old store that I fucking LOVE), and the other foods are
great (Vindaloo at 2am? WHAT?), and some of the nightlife is ok - albeit WAY
too pricy. but the city is dirty, the people are rude (by and large), there
is trash EVERYWHERE, and swimming at the beaches??? EW. You have obviously
never been to Howard Beach, lol. Then again, i think the vast majority of
beaches on the East Coast are nappy (Nags Head NC excluded).

Maybe I just spent too much time on the east coast? Color me jaded.

I've spent a good part of my life in NYC and there will always be a part of 
my soul on West Street >:-}

NYC today in no way resembles the city in the seventies and 
eighties.  Gentrification and the desire for security over freedom have 
killed most of the voluptuous night life I remembered.  AIDS had a role in 
that too, but SF in the nineties was a much more interesting place at night 
all things considered than NYC.  I see SF going the way of Manhattan 
unfortunately:  playgrounds for rich folk who go to bed at 9 to get ready 
for another productive day at the office.  No room (literally) for fun and 
frolic.

One thing I do really miss here is the lack of good deli.  Lord I would 
kill for a NY pastrami on rye or a salami omelets on sunday morning.  And 
bagels....real bagels.

All things considered, tho, SF is the place for me now.  You are right 
about the beaches in the East, except for Cape Cod.  I miss 
Provincetown.  But here I can walk for a half hour and find myself in some 
of the most awesomely beautiful scenery in the world.  Took hours and hours 
to get into some nature in NYC, unless one considers wandering about 
Central Park at night nature.

Love,

Apollo

I was just reading off of the top liner, I'm not even sure what breakcore is
let alone anyone locally or otherwise that plays it.  :)  Also note that
gabber is not listed in the liner, jeez guys what up?  And can we get some
more rooms?  What if I don't like what's going on in the first 6 for part of
the night?

Ahhhh - the deli's. You have a good point there too. A good NYC pastrami on
rye is "to die for". If you find a good Jewish or Italian deli tho (run by
real Jews or Italians, lol), you can typically find quality almost as good
as any deli in NYC. In fact Genova Delicatessan in Oakland and Saul's in
Berkeley have some fantastic deli fare. Not quite the enormous selection,
but the food is on point.

Seems like gentrification is sweeping the US, because neighborhoods like
NorthWest DC are also experiencing the same things. "No more loud music near
my renovated rowhouse dammit!"

Sad really. Culture spots going the way of the dodo at the hands of rich
assholes.

Yup!!  Wish I knew a good way to help stop that from happening.  (Any
prank ideas are welcome.)

Oh c'mon, its not that bad.  There are *so* many parties in this city...
big clubs, undergrounds, salons, bars, get-togethers at people's flats.
Some of the Rich Folk tend to be the biggest fucking partiers of them all.

OH MY GOD!!!!  I cant believe you dont know what breakcore is.  And
you call yourself a DJ!  My most favorite experience with breakcore
was when i was a child, probably around 7or 8, i got hit in the back
of the head with a baseball bat, it was euphoric, ever since then i've
been a breakcore junkie.  I even busted out some breakcore on One
eye'd Willy's Pirate ship, me and the rest of the Goonies got jiggy
wit it and had a grand 'ol time.

And if you, specifically, dont like what's going on in those 6 rooms,
we'll have a special 7th room set aside for you where we will duct
tape you to a chair, and you will be molested my both Konkers and
Stickman at the same time.  Not sure if you remember the incident down
by the river at the cabin party a couple years back, but that's very
similar to what you will experience so i strongly suggest to you that
you like or at least pretend to like one of the rooms.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Room mates suck

Guess my house is the oddity. We all get along just fine and have for
years. No drama. Speaking of which - I'm leaving the country at the
end of January (just gave notice at work) so my room is up for grabs.
$650/mo +utils. Our 1.5//768 DSL is free since Tyler's company pays
for it. We're in Emeryville. Plenty of space. 2 DJ's as roomies,
backyard, storage, washer+dryer, etc...

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: New Year's Eve in Las Vegas?

Hey peeples... I'm heading to Vegas for NYE and I've heard a bunch of
stuff surrounding the dynamics of this holiday in LV...

I hear they lock everyone in whatever venue they're in before
countdown and cabs are impossible to find (I have to make sure I can
get my friend a ride from the airport at 8PM on the 31st). Has anyone
ever done the Vegas thing on NYE? Advice? Do's? Don'ts? THANKY!

How many people throwing a party say *the truth is* and then tell you
that they're sorting out someone amazing and perfect for that night.
That's the kind of people you want putting on a party because yanno -
they care. Beyond that knowing the amount of effort that's going into
this and all FnF+OW events, well, prepare to have your ass handed to
you on a plate that night. It's going to be amazing...

you can walk everywhere.  cabs will be a challenge.

i've never been locked in any place in vegas.

when the clock strikes 12 all of the streets on the strip will be filled
with people. there will be little to no cars getting anywhere.

it is sheer pandemonium, but fun.

i wouldn't spend any money on a club or anything.  just walk around have a
great time.

you can take alcohol anywhere you go including restaurants, cabs etc.  not
a case or six pack mind you, but whatever drink you have at the time...

Thats one of the issues I have with my roomies now. They have more
stuff their master bedroom can hold so they put all their shit in the
rest of the house. They also bring stuff home that they find in the
trash. Like right now we have three coffee tables and some thing that
looks like it goes on a desk in the front room. They also got this
ugly green couch on our patio that has no cushions. It's so tacky, I
think they are gona own a flea market some day.

yea, if there are more than 2 housemates, there really is not any realistic 
side to being a pack rat, plus it is just inconsiderate to others in the 
house.  The girls I live with have a "shower organizer-pole/shelf thingie" 
one for EACH of them!  I have one shelf  lol
I love them dearly, but good GOD

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Room mates suck

I know what you mean, my roommates suck ass, i got 2 whiny ass bitches
for roommates, all they do is bitch and moan about how they got sand
in their vagina and they cant scrub it out.  i offered to lick it out
on several occasions just to shut them up but to no avail.  One has a
really stinky ass too, and bombs the bathroom daily.  The other leaves
his scab pickings all over the place, so when you're walking around
bare foot and you think you stepped on an old stale  crunch berry,
it's actually a nasty crusty scab.  How gross is that?  I don't know
why i just shut my mouth and deal with it, i guess i like the pain or
something...

I also hear this is the 100th anniversary of Las Vegas, and it's
supposed to be "THE PARTY"  I was reading an article that said this is
gonna be one crazy year for Las Vegas, a non stop 100th anniversary
party of sorts or something like that.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Happy Holidaze!

ugh, snow.

be grateful that the closest u get to it is through that pretty postcard.

:D

I werk out of doors and my first full month on the job was Feb 2003,
which went down as the coldest Feb on record in DC, since they started
keeping records, so forgive me for recoiling in horror, m'kay?

this is after living in Cali for a dozen years, so it was a hell of a
shock to the system, at least for me.

But thanks, I'm just sorry that I don't have something equally plurry
to send out to ya'll, that's very sweet, so thank you, K.

I feel an itch this year to revisit my 1998 approach to the 12 days of
the end of the year as practised by the the pre-xian Pagans, that
werked so well for me that year

What the pagans did, since their calendar was keyed to the moon, was
to write the last 12 days of the year off, starting with the Equinox,
as a free fire, temporary autonomous zone, long b4 Hakim Bey was a
gleam in anyone's eye, (think this is where he got the idea in the
first fucking place), where you were allowed to pull the ripcord and
really let your hair down.

They did this because if they didn't have a consistent calendar, it
would be hard to plan for the year, i.e., if you didn't write these
days off, it would throw off the calendar eventually and a few decades
down the road, you'd be planting your crops in August..

These 12 days were considered 'out of the order,' or 'the days of madness.'

then the Xians came along and Disneyfied it like Rudy
Ghouiani/Mussolini did to NYC's Times Square.

Borrrriiiinnng.

The one caveat being that my day job is really starting to werk 4 me,
so as long as it doesn't interfere with that, it's all fair game......

In other werds,

'I'm going to ravertastic hell, who's coming with me?'

Hey peeples... I'm heading to Vegas for NYE and I've heard a bunch of
stuff surrounding the dynamics of this holiday in LV...

I hear they lock everyone in whatever venue they're in before
countdown and cabs are impossible to find (I have to make sure I can
get my friend a ride from the airport at 8PM on the 31st). Has anyone
ever done the Vegas thing on NYE? Advice? Do's? Don'ts? THANKY!

Wait, I thought you were a dirty bear?  Why do you shun the dirtywear?

(BTW, when I "go commando" it usually involves lavender-scented camo
body butter.  Word is bond.)

Yah, it got even worse last night. I sent my roomies an email about
house stuff and they wigged out. It seems every time someone tells
them they don't like what they are doing they get all huffy. People
are so lame and immature some times. I even offered to help them clean
up their mess in the email and they still wigged out.

"The government, which was designed for the people, has got into the hands 
of the bosses and their employers, the special interests.  An invisible 
empire has been set up above the forms of democracy."
-Woodrow Wilson

"Sometime in your life, hope that you might see one starved man, the look 
on his face when the bread finally arrives.  Hope that you might have 
bought it or baked it or even kneaded it yourself.  For that look on his 
face, for your meeting his eyes across a piece of bread, you might be 
willing to lose a lot, or suffer a lot, or die a little, even."
-Daniel Berrigan

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

Umm.  No.

Also, anyone ever heard of chaffing?

Maybe I'm just getting old, but I've always thought
the clean pair of underwear was one of the great
inventions of modern man up there with you know
spandex and indoor plumbing and nuclear power and
frozen toaster waffles...

Happy holidays,

Peter

I'm sorry, but this is a bad idea for the following reasons:

1) the chafe factor is dangerously high... the last thing I want is my
dick stuck to denim (ouch) or tangled up in the pocket lining (watch out
for the keys!).

2) the smell of spermicide and lube is much more apparent when it's not
insulated by undergarments (you ARE wearing condoms, right fellas?). 

3) the little guys need tender love and care following sex--why do you
think they snuggle up like that immediately afterwards?

Of course, this is probably all lost on anyone that refers to their sex
organs as "junx". :P

Toodles,

Subject: Re: [sfraves] BSP:  Furious II - January 29th

The invisibles are the worst act I've ever seen play out live here. Fucking 
annoying as hell and just straight stupid music. The drummer - cool. The 
rest - stick to DJ'ing and trying to look hot and sexxxy when you play. It 
worked well for them in their dj careers. Why they get booked I dunno. I can 
only assume it's name recognition from their dj careers.

That's a big party yo. But then again so is the ow+fnf now. Now it's *6* 
f'ing rooms. I think I'm starting to cringe at the thought of being a part 
of that.

I call bullshit-

As a non under-wearer for ~7 years now, after sex things are generally
*very* sensitive- scraping against denim is not good at all.

It is literally the only time I wish I had underwear.

Touche' monssieur - touche'.

But my "junx" loves denim. I experience worse chaffing with boxers going all 
higgledy piggledy inside my jeans, then I ever have going commando (although 
I'd never dance like that - this is just my post-coital routine), and if you 
leave post sex juices and condom funk on yer twig&berries after sex - that's 
just kinda icky. LOL

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Nrr Going commando

What the hell are you people doing to your sex parts during the act????

Geebus!

This is by and large the most amusing thread I have seen on here yet. I am a 
sicko like that - sue me.

You know what's missing from this discussion? The Libertarian
perspective!

Seriously though, I think it's time to put this thread to bed. Here's a
summary for all of you that deleted the less "constructive" emails and
missed all the very important points:

Going commando (a phrase describing the practice of refraining from the
use of undergarments) can be a liberating, pleasurable experience. But
extreme caution should be excercised under the following conditions:

1) Your twig and berries are covered in post-coital fluids.
2) You're wearing pants that may chafe or otherwise harm your package.
3) You have a sensitive wang.

Happy holidays,

The feeling of freedom and...well...sensuality are 
certainly  pluses >:-}  Downsides:  I used to go commando all the time in 
my depraved youth.  Did once very seriously injure that which I most prized 
with a zipper and had to go to the emergency room to free it up and get 
some first aid.  Then there was the night at a very posh dinner party when 
my tight pants split right up the back exposing my ass....  Some people 
still talk about that.

Love,

Apollo

"The government, which was designed for the people, has got into the hands 
of the bosses and their employers, the special interests.  An invisible 
empire has been set up above the forms of democracy."
-Woodrow Wilson

"Sometime in your life, hope that you might see one starved man, the look 
on his face when the bread finally arrives.  Hope that you might have 
bought it or baked it or even kneaded it yourself.  For that look on his 
face, for your meeting his eyes across a piece of bread, you might be 
willing to lose a lot, or suffer a lot, or die a little, even."
-Daniel Berrigan

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."

Subject: [sfraves] Saturday 12.19: Todd Sines (Planet E) @ Rx Gallery

Who said there was no techno in the Bay Area? (Ok, me, but I was wrong.) Put
some oomph in your oonce-oonce this Saturday at SODA, when New York's TODD
SINES makes a special appearance at San Francisco's minimal techno monthly.

A veteran of the midwestern scene, Todd Sines has recorded for legendary
labels like PEACEFROG, SEVENTH CITY, RESIDUAL, and Carl Craig's PLANET E,
and DJs like RICHIE HAWTIN, DJ PIERRE, and STEVE BUG have loaded their mix
CDs with Sine's tracks. Don't miss this chance to see a master of minimal
soul at work.

SODA residents THE FRESH BLEND (IRIS Distribution, Trouble) and PHILIP
SHERBURNE (XLR8R, Trouble) keep it moving with the finest in techno,
electro, and microhouse.

The only thing outrageous about this is it being x-posted to multiple
lists!  Other than that, though, as I said on spazlist, it is 100%
legal and legitimate for the police to investigate someone making
threats against American citizens and American soldiers.  No one's
freedom of speech is being abridged and no one's privacy is being
violated.  The First Amendment guarantees you the right to speak your
mind; it does not guarantee you freedom from the consequences of what
you say.  Moreover, as also I noted in my reply to this on spazlist,
the conduct of the police in this situation does not seem to be
improper; the supposedly-horrified parents weren't so horrified that
they didn't have time to talk to the police for THREE hours.  If they
were _so_ concerned about Gestapo-like police-state tactics, why
didn't they politely refuse to answer any more questions?

Actually, on further reflection, I do find something to be outraged
about here: It's outrageous that a serious journalist would waste
precious airtime and energy on such a non-story, and it's outrageous
that otherwise intelligent individuals would waste bandwidth
propagating this drivel across the 'Net.

that is scary. but that is not going to stop me from
saying what i want, and i dont think other people
should be intimidated by this. thats when you get
repression is when people actually become intimidated
by the government. fuck that everyone has a voice.

So the fact that "The Police questioned his parents about their views on
Sept. 11, the military and if they knew any foreigners who criticized US
policy." is an appropriate police response to determine if these
"threats" were valid?  As is inquiring "whether the parents might be
teaching "anti-American values" at home."  Please explain.

yeah it just pisses me off when i hear things like
this. im not going to let it scare me, and others
shouldnt either. if i get questioned or whatever at
least i took a stand. thats the only way things have
happened in our history, is by people standing up for
their rights. we need to see more of this now. we
can't let the government just mow us over.

Uhh, yeah?  The police can ask any questions they damn well please;
it's up to citizens to know their rights and not answer them.

What bothers me about this situation is that the cops are getting all
the shit when they're the only people who haven't done anything wrong.
 The real malfeasant in this situation is the moron teacher who didn't
know the child's parents well enough to know the threat was without
merit and who didn't bother to at least make a phone call before
sending the police out.

I mean, gosh, she could have at least sent a Message in a Bottle. 
Doesn't Sting have anything better to do, anyway?  Seems kind of silly
to interrupt him in his important work of making Jaguar commercials
and send him all the way to Virginia over some 11 year old...

Again, how does the line of questioning relate to being able to
determine the validity of the so called threat?

Forgot to comment on this part.  The cops actually have a bit of
motivation to do this sort of thing.  You see, they don't get that nice
slice of the "terrorism" money pie unless they're taking action against
possible "terrorist" activity.  I even know someone who was in a bar
fight and ended up being charged as a terrorist.  Gotta get those
duckets!

Someone sounds like they need some SpaceHookerz... just played our second
booking this week and it was a shitload of fun.  Two seasoned local laptop
jocks with various other instruments just banging it techno-electro-tweaky
house-crap style.  Sorta taking style cues from some of the more
improv-oriented live acts locally, but still dance friendly.

We look like a duet, consisting of the mighty G and myself... but I
explained when I joined on that the heap of drink tickets specified in my
contract is actualy a full fledged band member as well.  We might be
firing the pile of drink tickets in favor of a three foot water bong, but
that's yet to be decided.

Know the score.

A similar event occurred right here in the SF/SJ Bay Area in Oakland, CA, 
in May, 2003.

See:

http://sf.indymedia.org/news/2003/05/1607366_comment.php

An Oakland teacher called the Secret Service on two 16 year old Oakland 
students because the alluded to offing Bush in a fired up conversation in 
their class about how Bush is killing people all over the world!! This is 
the type of thing that students say all the time.

Oakland Tribune

Also see:
http://www.prisonplanet.com/200903beingwatched.html

Summary:
Warning! You Are Being Watched

In These Times

In late April, two teen-age students in Oakland, California, got an 
unwelcome, real-life lesson in civics. During a heated class discussion at 
Oakland High School about politics and President Bush, the boys made 
comments the exact nature of which are in dispute, but which their teacher 
believed constituted a threat toward the president. The teacher went to 
the FBI.

Someone sounds like they need some SpaceHookerz... just played our second
booking this week and it was a shitload of fun.  Two seasoned local laptop
jocks with various other instruments just banging it techno-electro-tweaky
house-crap style.  Sorta taking style cues from some of the more
improv-oriented live acts locally, but still dance friendly.

We look like a duet, consisting of the mighty G and myself... but I
explained when I joined on that the heap of drink tickets specified in my
contract is actualy a full fledged band member as well.  We might be
firing the pile of drink tickets in favor of a three foot water bong, but
that's yet to be decided.

Know the score.

"The government, which was designed for the people, has got into the hands 
of the bosses and their employers, the special interests.  An invisible 
empire has been set up above the forms of democracy."
-Woodrow Wilson

"Sometime in your life, hope that you might see one starved man, the look 
on his face when the bread finally arrives.  Hope that you might have 
bought it or baked it or even kneaded it yourself.  For that look on his 
face, for your meeting his eyes across a piece of bread, you might be 
willing to lose a lot, or suffer a lot, or die a little, even."
-Daniel Berrigan

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."

Know all things to be like this:
A mirage, a cloud castle,
A dream, an apparition,
Without essence, but with qualities that can be seen.

Know all things to be like this:
As the moon in a bright sky
In some clear lake reflected,
Though to that lake the moon has never moved.

Know all things to be like this:
As an echo that derives
From=20music, sounds, and weeping,
Yet in that echo is no melody.

Know all things to be like this:
As a magician makes illusions
Of horses, oxen, carts and other things,
Nothing is as it appears.

FOR THOSE IN THE KNOW **

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:  I N S I D E

Don~Rt you want to come INSIDE ?  It~Rs a place where you can get away=20
from the traffic, the noise, the hassles, and just let yourself go~E

Come INSIDE and feel the togetherness in our new family of urban beings=20
rocking together in a cascade of house music, warmth, happiness, and great=
=20
vibes.  Being INSIDE makes the rest of the world not seem so crazy, so=20
hectic~E just relax, have a seat, or dance, or laugh, or just nod your=20
head to the music.  It doesn~Rt matter when you~Rre INSIDE.

INSIDE is a new monthly Thursday night audiosocial for everyone,=20
everywhere who can dig it.  INSIDE is a creation of the REVIVE PROJECT, a=
=20
small collective of dj~Rs and social engineers who envision a gathering=20
where going out is fun again, where guests feel like they~Rre at home (=20
but with a better liquor cabinet.. ), where the music is never, ever=20
awful~E The Revive Project consists of Derek Niddery, John Dupre, and Matt=
=20
Valenz.

You can come INSIDE the very first time on the evening of our first soiree=
=20

award in 10 categories.  Levende Lounge is at 1710 Mission Street at=20
Duboce in San Francisco.

DJ BIO: MATT VALENZ In a world overtaken by automation and technology,=20
soul can be a hard thing to come by.  For someone lucky enough to be=20
raised on the sounds of Earth Wind & Fire, Kool and the Gang, Diana Ross,=
=20
and Tower of Power, being soulful comes as second nature. At 17 he was=20
turned onto vinyl and was soon playing Miami bass, freestyle, and=20
primitive house at small underground parties in the central California=20
area, then moved on to start a career in the music business when he=20
relocated to San Francisco at age 21.  He continued his drive to learn=20
every aspect of the industry, and returned a few years ago from a two year=
=20
stay in England where he was the booking manager for dy-na-mix agency, the=
=20
best agency for underground music in Europe. Now, back in that city, he is=
=20

DJ BIO:  Derek Niddery Born and raised in Toronto, Canada, music has=20
always played a pivotal role in his life.  Being exposed to his parent~Rs=

extensive record collection from the 50~Rs, 60~Rs and 70~Rs, he learned to=
=20
appreciate the different styles and sounds of jazz, funk, soul, rock, and=
=20
reggae.  Learning to play the guitar, drums, and congas that were always=20
present in the house, he would often watch his father record his own=20
weekend jam sessions on to old eight tracks.  Having the opportunity to=20
play drums in a band back in the early 90~Rs, he continues to push his=20
percussion skills today and will often play the congas throughout San=20
Francisco.  One of his biggest thrills came when he had the opportunity to=
=20
sit in and play congas with a Cuban jazz band while visiting Havana, Cuba=
=20
in September of 2003.  Now, only two years on the decks, he has already=20
worked with some of the Bay Area~Rs top promoters and DJ~Rs.  He believes=
=20
House music encompasses all styles of music and allows for unlimited=20
creativity.  This philosophy holds true in the music he chooses, always=20
bringing an uplifting passionate energy to his sets. DJ BIO: DAVID HARNESS=

Yeah, it's been hard getting my foot in the door over e-mail. Back in
the day I would just fax out a few resumes and wait for the calls to
roll in, now I send 3-5 resumes + cover letter a day and nothing.

Thanks,

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Any Google Recruiters out there?

fyi: Google was running a listing on Craigslist here for months for a
position in DC that looked entry level, they weren't asking for than a
A+ Cert, and the ability to lift x amount of pounds.

Couldn't find it on Craigs today, and a quick google of google's site
looks like they may have disappeared that one.

but it might still be around, looked like that job may have had high
turnover, and if it's still around, hopefully this info is enough to
set you on the right track.

Good luck.=20

Let us know if you land it there, they're a great company to werk for,
a whole fuck of lot better than Wal-Mart, say.


back in 1997, i was werking as a host at The Good Earth Restaurant, in
the 100 block of University Ave., in Palo Alto, and right next door to
Google's first, off-Stanford campus, start-up office. I also lived
across the street from the restaurant.

Google had their logo on a banner that they hung in the front of the
building, and while I had this intuitive hunch that I should walk a
resume in, i never, never, never, never did.

damn, damn, damn.

my best friend was looking for werk on Google's super corporate campus
that they moved to in Mountain View and he bumped into their in-house
Chef, the one that prepares the free meals you get if you werk there.

Dude's Employee # on his badge was:

55

Damn.

I don't even want to think how much he's werth, and I'm most decidely
not, werth $$$$ today.

google google bling bling bling bling.

must be nice.

hello, this is a continuation of a fictional piece:
 
they walked on like many, but then something made one of the two turn and stop and look where the look was needed, and the pair were removed from one another all at once in the name of love. :)

Subject: [sfraves] (NRR) Not One Damn Dime Day

Inauguration Day, Thursday, January 20th, 2005 is "Not One Damn Dime
Day" in America.

On "Not One Damn Dime Day" those who oppose what is happening in our
name in Iraq can speak up with a 24-hour national boycott of all forms
of consumer spending. During "Not One Damn Dime Day" please don't spend
money. Not one damn dime for gasoline. Not one damn dime for necessities
or for impulse purchases.

Not one damn dime for anything for 24 hours.

The object is simple. Remind the people in power that the war in Iraq is
immoral and illegal; that they are responsible for starting it and that
it is their responsibility to stop it.

"Not One Damn Dime Day" is to remind them, too, that they work for the
people of the United States of America, not for the international
corporations and K Street lobbyists who represent the corporations and
funnel cash into American politics.

Not One Damn Dime Day" is about supporting the troops. The politicians
put the troops in harm's way. Now 1,200 brave young Americans and (some
estimate) 100,000 Iraqis have died. The politicians owe our troops a
plan -- a way to come home.

There's no rally to attend. No marching to do. No left or right wing
agenda to rant about. On "Not One Damn Dime Day" you take action by
doing nothing. You open your mouth by keeping your wallet closed.

For 24 hours, nothing gets spent, not one damn dime, to remind our
religious leaders and our politicians of their moral responsibility to
end the war in Iraq and give America back to the people.

Please share this email with as many people as possible.

It's the Asian invasion at the radio station!

Man, Brandon Sugiyama, you just diluted the search results for "sexy Li Sasaki
makes me hot."  All that hard work down the drain ;p

Yup, Brandon's right.  And I apologize for failing to mention this to
you folks.  We're already at the 20.5 hour mark for this thing (YES, it
s going on right now.)  Only 19.5 to go!

Subject: [sfraves] bsp - mission to mars 12.31

Camp Stupid, SF-Vibe, Chris Fabbri, and all of your friends:

offering guidance audibly presented:
Jonas vs. Daynah
Persefoni
Hickory
sixty4k
Jay Walker vs Ian Vogel
Bloom

invite you to be guided through the portal door of Cafe Mars and be
transported to the future; where martians and other beings gather to
celebrate another time around the sun.

Chris Fabbri will curate the artshow. The artwork Fabbri produces is about
maturation, such as entering space and documenting earthly visions with
its' vast amount of energy that exists in the global atmosphere of light
and cosmic rays.

Come spend your Free time with us and experience the new look of Cafe Mars
for this very special day. We will be kicking it off proper @ 8pm and will
continue until the new year 2005. Your mission will
conclude at 2am.

Already have plans for NYE? That's fine. Just make sure you make us your
official pre-party destination as there is no cover for this event. No
Cover? On New Year's???

There will be no admission fee all nite long on the corner of 7th &
brannan, SF.

love love love

Subject: [sfraves] [bsp] Hugger-Mugger 12/21 @ Lit Lounge, SF

We've got an extra special lineup for an extra special holiday edition 
of Hugger-Mugger.

Performing his first live set, Juan Segovia will be channeling sounds 
from his brain directly through his laptop for us all to get down to.  
Home for the holidays, DJ Science will be making his return to SF to

PROPS TO YOU AN SCIENCE!!!!!!! YOU GUYS DID AN AWESOME SET 2NITE! THANKS :-)
You guys helped me get over my un-happy cold!

Bam was insanely awesome also! 

And to top it off Andy W sent my mind into yet another wonderfully crazy
re-programming that was long overdue ;-)

I am soo sorry I had to Miss Anakin (Adam) and his set :-( but I needed some
sleep before my daughters burn case settlement in the morning! 

I hope to commute to the courthouse in the morning to the wonderful sounds
and energy of AaronJae to make sure I am coherent in front of the lawyers
and the judge.

Matt

We've got an extra special lineup for an extra special holiday edition 
of Hugger-Mugger.

Performing his first live set, Juan Segovia will be channeling sounds 
from his brain directly through his laptop for us all to get down to.  
Home for the holidays, DJ Science will be making his return to SF to 
help us remember what we were all missing.  Also, giving us a little 
taste of the SoCal breaks scene is Erik Hz.

Subject: [sfraves] [nrr] iMac cases and powered monitors. . .

so i've got a bondi blue iMac case (still working on getting another) and i'm looking for some 
powered monitors around 1.25cu.ft. that i can gut and mount in them once i layer them up on the 
inside with a little roving mat fiberglass.

cheeeeeeeeeeep and not *completely* shiete are the operatives here.  used works too ! (and the cases 
could have been ran over by a torqued out roadie as far as i'm concerned... as long as the 
amp/drivers are in relatively working order... and they're cheeeeeeeeeeep ;)

thanx !


repurposing is grate !

-=dave

ps- if anybody has an iMac laying around with a dead analog board (which seems to be the typical) 
and wants to get rid of the case (with the dead monitor or at least the grey monitor ring) for 
cheeeeeeeeeep, let me know ! :)

dude, who tuned in to hear Andy do the most insanely beautiful mix out of 
Orb's "Toxygene"?

the guy stepped up as i put my last record on and scoffed that i make him 
mix out of an "ambient" song.  he then went on to totally deconstruct the 
sound on the fly and mixed it with a vocal from a Bob Newhart comedy album.  
it was a mad scientist in action and JC and i chuckled at the sight.  
completely innovative and mind melting and he mixed it into techno like the 
well seasoned pro that he is.

my hat is off to you, mr. W.

Oh god i hate this kinda shit, makes me want to vomit all over myself.
I dont get why people can even think this is remotly close to
hardcore. I feel like throwing things at DJ's who play this shit and
think they're hardcore. Next time i hear this at a party i'm gonna
puke all over the record the DJ is currently playing. I'm not even
really a big fan or current hardcore, breakcore, noisecore whatever
the fuck it is called now. The hardcore i like is the old skool shit
like from the early 90's, like DJ Dan and Ron D. Core used to
spin...kinda ravey, techno-y with porn samples and heavy metal guitars
and shit, now that's hardcore, and it's music too, too much hardcore
now a days just sounds like noise. I dont get how people can say they
spin it, most of it's not even broken up in to the standard 32 beats,
and if it is, it changes up so freakin often you cant tell anyway, you
can mix at any point and if you're skilled enough to at least match
the beat no one would know if you fucked up or not cause it all just
sounds like painful noise. i think Ron D. Cores medical mayhem or
whatever it was called (released back in 97 or so) was the last of the
good hardcore, after that i couldnt stand to listen to it, it all
sounded the same and had no real groove to it, just felt like being
hit in the head with a baseball bat over and over again.  This crap is
like NRG only lamer...at least NRG can sound kinda dark and evil, this
is like the the Emo of the electronica genre.  I'm like all hardcore,
but i have feelings too.  what the hell is up with that, you're either
punk rock/hardcore, or you have feelings...one or the other, those 2
dont mix, i'm sorry and if you think they do then you're just a lame
as the music.  as the infamous Mugatu would say "I feel like i'm
taking crazy pills."

Ding!  We have a winna!

Thanks to all who came down and made sure I didn't have to drop more
than a half an hour's worth of vinyl.  And thanks to all you folks who
listened in and called/chatted/emailed.  40 hours seemed like a crazy
goal, but we did it!  Hope to see a bunch of you at Hugger Mugger
tonight!

quoth Jonas R.:
> anyways,  who's playing right now???  it's really really good.

Thanks, even though I flubbed a record number of mixes this time around.
Head's in another place, I suppose... Anyway, here's the tracklist.

Alex Smoke - Simple Things [Vakant]
Dominik Eulberg - Basstolpel [Raum]
[Juan Segovia x 2]
Reinhard Voigt - Spice [Kompakt Extra]
Dahlback & Dahlback - Forsberg Loves The Acid [Turbo]
Audion - The Pong [Spectral Sound]
Joshua Collins - Bring It Down [Frik:n:Frak]
2 Dollar Egg - #5 Lebt [Nummer]
Mathew Jonson - Decompression [Minus]
Noah Pred - Unfold [Tongut]
Pig & Dan - 909 [Tecmission]
Maradona - El Mundo [Danza 500]
Rob Acid - Love Rocket [Audiomatique]
Motoyuki - Embryo [Iron Box]
Maetrik - My Specs [Treibstoff]
Joel Mull - Dish [Truesoul]
Pantytec - Elastobabe (Soul Capsule Mix) [Perlon]
WB - Somewhere Over the Slippybergun [WB]
2 Dollar Egg - Graphit [Klang]
Kero - Motorcity Mold [Bpitch Control]
Nktar - Rite Thru [Outside]
Lowfour - Eau de Cologne (Mario + Terrae Edit) [Defrag Sound Processing]
Luciano & Serafin - Yaki Soba [Telegraph]
Gringo Grinder - Stiletto Rock [Onitor]
Unai - Night Fell (And So Did We) [Sub Static]
2 Dollar Egg - Implantant [Klang]
Lusine - Flat (Lusine Mix) [Ghostly International]
Estornel / Pucher - Ode To A Girl [Onitor]

I started around 2, so I'm guessing that you were hearing either the
kinda abstract electro stuff by Nktar or the Lowfour track. Thanks for
listening, and thank you J.C. for putting together such an awesome
lineup!

Cheers,

Subject: Re: [sfraves] CLSM Christmas present! Download this album for free right now:

CLSM is a colabration of Jon Doe and many other old school acid trance
producers. The cd is a combanation of freeform, some old acid tracks
sped up and little bit of hardcore. This guy who posted his review is
an ass basket who should go drown himself now. Jon Doe is one of the
best producers I have ever had the pleasure to see live. A CLSM live
PA will blow your mind.

Thank you for all the responses.. I hope it turns fortuitous in time for the
new year.  One a sidenote.. employee bonus plans are a really great way to
drive internal referrals.. I remember when companies would pay like $5K for
positions.. that was a long time ago :)

Blues Singer-Guitarist Son Seals Dies at 62

2 hours, 10 minutes ago


By Chris Morris

LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Blues singer-guitarist Son Seals, one of 
the most distinctive voices to emerge in the genre during the 1970s, died 
Monday in Chicago of complications from diabetes. He was 62.

Seals helped establish Chicago-based Alligator Records as the era's premier 
blues label with a run of albums featuring his tough songs, brooding vocals 
and spikey guitar work. He won three W.C. Handy Blues Awards, and received 
a Grammy Award nomination in 1980 for his work on the live compilation 
"Blues Deluxe."

Born in Osceola, Ark., Seals learned guitar from his father, a former 
minstrel show performer and juke joint operator. He initially established 
himself professionally as a drummer, working with guitarist Earl Hooker and 
appearing behind Albert King on the 1968 Stax album "Live Wire/Blues Power."

Seals moved to Chicago in 1971 and began fronting his own groups on the 
city's South Side. Signed to Alligator, he made an immediate impression 
with his impassioned 1973 debut "The Son Seals Blues Band." After the 
release of its 1977 sequel "Midnight Son," the New York Times called Seals 
"the most exciting young blues guitarist and singer in years."

Seals had a tempestuous relationship with Alligator and its founder-owner 
Bruce Iglauer, who also managed him; he departed the label in the mid-'80s, 
but returned to the fold in the '90s. His last album "Lettin' Go" was cut 
for Telarc in 2000.

He toured widely, despite the loss of a leg to diabetes. Late in his career 
he opened several shows for the jam band Phish, who covered his song "Funky 
Bitch."

Seals is survived by his sister Katherine Sims and 14 children.

"The government, which was designed for the people, has got into the hands 
of the bosses and their employers, the special interests.  An invisible 
empire has been set up above the forms of democracy."
-Woodrow Wilson

"Sometime in your life, hope that you might see one starved man, the look 
on his face when the bread finally arrives.  Hope that you might have 
bought it or baked it or even kneaded it yourself.  For that look on his 
face, for your meeting his eyes across a piece of bread, you might be 
willing to lose a lot, or suffer a lot, or die a little, even."
-Daniel Berrigan

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

Son Seals was amazing.  I have several of his LPs in
my blues collection and I saw him once in LA.

I remember when hiring bonuses were in the $10K range too. Those were the 
days... $1k/week webvan orders. Fridges stocked with redbull. Raves 
happening in office spaces. Best fucking year of my life and I doubt I'll 
ever see something like it again...

Good luck with the google endeavor! =)

NO outside food or drinks? Shitloads of foofoo? Best party in some little 
warehouse? HAHAHAHAHA.

There's another party in Oakland that's going to make this party wear a 
clown suit and tear open a few new plur holes.

come on, ryan.  the kiddies have to have *somewhere* to go, as
the other party in oakland is 18+.  16 year olds probably have
a harder time getting beer as opposed to acid.

and hey, there's room enough for all of these parties.  :)  i
don't get the name of the party, tho.

Not to hate, but Ryan's right: there's just no competing with OW/FnF.

And BTW, it's generally considered bad form to put your name at the top
of the roster for your own party--especially under the heading
"confirmed talent"...

no, we've been completely retarded for years.  haven't you been paying 
attention?

mike:  fitter happier is a radiohead reference.

ryan:  i echo michael's sentiments.  room enough for all these parties and 
each will draw it's own crowd.  and one good thing about this party that we 
can all agree on:  Planet B is not performing!

regarding Modified, i know several people involved with the party and lots 
of the DJs playing.  they are good folks and while maybe they run in a 
different sect of the bay area scene, they are legit and have a following.  
hell, it's NYE!  let's all just have a good time!

omg i think i'm getting plurry...

Personally that party offers nothing to me. Has nothing to do with age
I'm 24. I just prefer the talent at their party. As far as their
placement on the bill from what I can tell it's in no particular
order.

Don't hate if you don't like. Just go do what ever you are gona do

Have either of you ever been to a modified party? Or are just just
some 30 year douche bags that still go to raves because no one will
date you?

Modified has been holding down the underground and doing quality
parties for dirt cheap. So have fun at your over promoted trance
party.

Nick

I have been to both Otherworld and Modified parties - and have actually had
fun at both. Although, OW does do things ten billion times better, Modified
does small undergrounds pretty well (despite the overabundance of
teenyboppers).

One thing tho - OW is NOT by ANY means an "overpromoted trance party". More
like sick ass pounding techno & other beats, and no matter how much they
advertise, will still be ten times more "underground" than anything I have
yet to experience in the Bay Area.

Two haters don't make a right. Don't hate, appreciate - or fellate - or
whatever.

Subject: [sfraves] [skylab2000] New Years Eve


Hi all, 

It's been two months since we have written anything to this list, and I'll bet you missed it, right? A giant whole in your life? Ok, whatever.  

Here's a bit of news.

skylab2000 will be playing live on New Years Eve in Cleveland. It's a two day party for the price of one ticket and we are playing night one, which is actual New Years Eve. I think it's gonna be the biggest thing in the midwest, so even if you are accoss the country like I am, it could be a fun weekend trip.

Also, I hope some of you have gotten a copy of Christmas Regrooved (Amazon, Borders etc), since there's a dark breaky skylab2000 remix of a Christmas song on there.

Here's details of the New Years event: (flyer online at http://pimpshosandlimos.i8.com/pimpshoslimos.htm) 

Hope to see some of you there!

yes i have.  here's what i saw:

- charging $$ for a break in
- people pissing in a dark corner of the venue b/c there
weren't any toilets
- some kid all ODed on something, freaking out (i helped him
get some air)
- the majority of people not dancing (?!)

i had a blast, tho.  stayed almost all night.  not bad for a
45-year old douche bag!

1) break-ins should be free
2) the party i'll be at doesn't have trance (i don't think)

you've sure been slinging a lot of shit these past few days...i
bet you're one of those "angry drunks" i've heard about.  calm
down, man.  people have different opinions.

that's right:  you're into hardcore.

seems like you should take your own advice.  calling people
douche bags and retards because they're going to another event
and telling others that you're going to kick their asses
because they don't like your style of hardcore doesn't seem
like you're not "hating".

oh, and sorry to tell you, but there's going to be trance at
your party...don't beat up the DJ, ok?

Subject: [sfraves] boomerang CDs for naughty children

send me your snail address for a CD.

Boomerang beats, and no rapping (praise Allah.)  
Made from 100% Recycled Post-Consumer samples. 
Junkyard and break beats embracing  futuristic
escapism, in recognition that the Present is usually
laughable (on a good day).   4 originals and 1 remix. 
Ill probably include some older stuff too.

1. READY TO GO:   B-boy baddass pops the wrong pill.  
Interesting samples:  The Greaseman,  Eazy-E  & NWA,
Dr. Dre, US3, Scary Movie, Dead Man on Campus, Mr.
Deeds,  The Heist. 

2. WANDERERS: 	Outer-space escapism supported by the
poetics of Carl Sagan. A vision of the human future
in space.

3. YOUR A IDIOT: 	Ever feel like your a idiot?  Me to.
Interesting samples:  Joe Frank, Beastie Boys, Friday,
Ghost World, Full Metal Jacket, Macarthur Park, George
B., Zoolander, Scary Movie, The Score.  

4. AYAHUASCA: 	Evolution and the human riddle.  
Interesting samples:  Carl Sagan, Frank Herbert,
Dopamine

5. BUCEPHALUS BOUNCING BALL  unauthorized remix.   The
Aphex Twin song is a breath-taking mess of jungle
music fallen to beautiful technological catastrophe.  
I decided to balance the dissonance by adding the
popular theme of human/robot sex. 
Interesting samples:  Isaac Asimov,  George Herbert,
Kraftwerk,  Styx, Carl Sagan, Mike Patton (faith no
more), Gregorys Girl, I Robot, Artificial
Intelligence, Alien Hunter, the Banger Sisters, Total
Eclipse,  the Heist.

Eh, every scene has its clashes in attitudes and rifts over things like
this.  Some folks here on SFR are champion shit-stirrers, but hey, even
tiffs like this raise awareness about *both* parties (no such thing as
bad publicity, etc).

The breakdown:

OW/FnF = Old-school raver types that throw infrequent but generally
breathtaking parties with varied lineups.  Musically, the stylistic net
is cast wide across the electronic music world.  There are core folks
that play regularly but pains are taken to get enough little-seen
national/international talent in to balance that. Partygoers to their
events range from candy kids to the oldest of the old guard.  They get
their pick of the venues due to respect and establishment.  Every
little detail is labored over and it shows.  Some very new ravers may
find the social scene somewhat difficult to penetrate, if only due to
differences in viewpoint and the sometimes decades-long friendships
involved.

Modified = New-school ravers that throw parties often, with a core
group of performers that does not change much from party to party.  The
music seems to center around trance, hardcore, and d&b, but with
departures from that formula here and there (who expected Andy W and
Chris Jackson that one time?).  Partygoers are generally teenagers or
early-20s folks, and a few older people checking out the scene.  The
parties are thrown quick and dirty in whatever the new warehouse or
renegade venue is.  Decorations are minimal, security is almost
nonexistant.  However, the parties often go off, everybody has fun, and
the atmosphere is relaxed.  Also, the relatively low production values
mean that the crew can throw more parties, which, to some, is a good
thing.

Both crews throw raves that are a lot of fun (I've been to scads of the
former and a few of the latter)..  You're looking at two different
viewpoints, and two very different musical leanings.  If you want a NYE
party that offers a total audio/visual experience and top-shelf talent,
come to OW.  If you want something a little more intimate with a
younger crowd and faster music, go to Modified.  

Even though I align myself more closely with the OW/FnF aesthetic, I
appreciate that people are throwing parties outside that sphere and
doing it their own way.  As long as people are having fun and expanding
their horizons a bit I'm all for it.  I'd sure rather see a 16-year-old
at a scrappy warehouse party than at some kind of mega massive!

Funny, but.... Uh?!

I was pretty much right on, I'd say.

So you are one of those people who reads something and misses
everything everyone involved said aren't you?

I didn't tell anyone I was going to kick their ass for not liking any
kind of hardcore. I said if you touch or puke on my records I will
kick you ass. I also hated on the other event because they were hating
on an event that I believed to be high quality, being done by great
people.

So I don't see how you so poorly misconstrued what I said. But next
time if you read the email instead of skimming through looking for key
points you might pick up what someone is putting down.

Oops left the quote out...

"seems like you should take your own advice.  calling people
douche bags and retards because they're going to another event
and telling others that you're going to kick their asses
because they don't like your style of hardcore doesn't seem
like you're not "hating"."

So you are one of those people who reads something and misses
everything everyone involved said aren't you?

I didn't tell anyone I was going to kick their ass for not liking any

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA, I love SFRaves it's the best source of entertainment
next to mutual masturbation with a monkey.

And yeah Ryan, let the lil foofoo kiddies run off to their lil foofoo
trance party, We all know how much cooler OW/FnF will be over the
other party, and just let the ignortant be just that.  We dont need
any candied out lil trance in my pants foofoo freaks hoggin up dance
space with their standing/lying around doing nothing attitude.  I for
one (regardless of how much i totally disagree with Modified, Kent
your a cool guy no offense towards you, Chris...i can't stand you,
you're a poor excuse for a human being, and i hope one day your party
gets busted and you gotta spend time in jail getting your poor pansy
ass pounded by a serial killer) am glad they're throwing this party,
just cause it'll draw away the underaged foofoo crowd we all know and
hate.

Sticky Dick, i agree, break in parties, should not be charging money
for a break in.  serriously, there's no venue to pay for, so it's
basically to just pocket the money.  When we used to throw renegades
back in 96-98 we never charged money for them cause of just that,
there's no venue to pay for.  You find DJ's willing to play for free
(generally the best way to showcase and help out up and coming DJ's)
and someone to provide sound for free (it's your sound system so no
charge there), You're DJ's are basically you, and some "friends" so
why do they need to charge to play some po-dunk lil renegade party,
wheres the whole i'm doing it for the love of music attitude?  Why
force a promoter to pay you to play a renegade party, that's just some
ego shit going on there, sure charge money to play at an actual club,
that i can agree with, but a renegade, come on...who the hell do you
think you are?  And if you're actually giving in and paying them, then
you're a pansy and need to stand up to your DJ's, tell em it's a
renegade and there's no point in charging, cause renegades are for the
love of the music and the scene right?  Are you collecting money to
pay for drugs?  hmmmmm, that'd be the only reason i could see charging
money, since everything else is free.

no - you said that you'd kick his ass if he came near your
records.  two totally different things.  

i'm guessing that you're all butt-hurt because he didn't like
your music you posted.  i didn't like it either: it was pretty
lame.  i'd listen to wild 94.9 or etard trance before that
crap.  you gonna kick my ass now?

and why were you hating on me with regard to OW?  OW is 18+. 
modified is probably all ages.  where are the kids going to go?
 coolworld?  gimme a break.

i have no idea about this modified party and the production
involved.  maybe they're actually renting a space instead of
breaking in.  but if the previous parties are any indication,
this one will probably not be "high quality".  i'm sure it'll
be fun, though.

maybe you should do the same.  SFR has archives - you've got
gmail.  use it.

And yet another reminder why no one posts on SFR any more. 

I'm not going to soil this party's post with any more non-sense. Go to
what ever party looks best to you. I honestly couldn't care.

Last post, sorry Modified crew.

Even if OW/fnf was not throwing a party I still would have gone to OW/fnf  
;)
maaaaaybe, the "old school ravers" have been in the scene so long, that we 
actually know what we want out of it...it is called "we have taste" and are 
over the candy bracelets and toys.  (my toys always got gunked up anyways, 
We are adults now, some of us have been a part of the scene for over 12 yrs, 
some started yesterday and decided to not drink scotch  with the "old 
schoolers"  But we will be having more aof a fantabulous night.  We have 
known many other kids in this scene for a very long time, I love meeting new 
people as well, I love it!  We are like a family, this has been my social 
group for the past almost 9 years now.  If you find that we are too clicky, 
you have not met me and my friends.
2 cents/plur/
see you all on the dance floor in my vintage raver clothes lol

Oh Oh Oh if i bring my copy of Hevean Scent could you play it at
midnight?  Oh my god i would so trance in my pants if i heard that at
midnight.  I'd be spraying trance all over myself and anyone near me. 
feel the love....feel the trance, i think the only thing that could
possibly compare to that would be to shoot up some heroin into my
penis and listen to some cannibal corpse on 45, backwards....

Indeed, Jonas :-)  Politics, I guess, is a relative thingy.

There are many fine NYE parties out there this year.    I think both crews, 
however, are worthy of high respect.  Longevity has nothing to do with 
it.  We should all cherish those who keep our dwindling underground scene 
alive IMO.

I'm determined to stay in San Francisco this year so I'm out of this East 
Bay ug drama.  So many worthy choices in the city :  an invite only 
underground I attended last year and loved;  opening the new year with true 
skool at the gingerbread warehouse;  dancing to the Wicked crew on Mason 
Street;  Tantra at SOMARTS;  Raindance and 13 Moontribe with the Mystic 
Family Circus at Cell Space;  the FOOL warehouse party with Honey 
Dijon...and these are on my short list.

I'll be taking the N-Judah party train in so I'll stop in at as many 
parties as I can walk/hitch to :-)

Love,

Apollo

Subject: Re: [sfraves] thank you sfr, you're better than my grandma's novella

New Years in SF has always been a tough call for me.  there is always 
something going on and it's a shame that we can only choose one (or two...or 
heck, maybe i could somehow squeeze a third one in?)

there is something for everyone.  i really don't think of NYE as being a 
competitive thing since practically everyone wants to go somewhere and do 
something!

not to mention there is the space cowboys' Breakfast of Champions that 
starts at 6am NY day.  and then the one night only return of Eklectic/Hektic 
at the cat club....

aw shoot.  at first i thought  this thread was
"Filthier Happier".  And I was all like, dude-- put me
on your mailing list. 

Stickman at midnight in the chillroom?  Gimme SteveO's
bong and find me a corner with some pillows.

Is this really a trance party? If so, that's some
fucked up shit.  There should be more warning.

already there,
boomboom

Q:  How many psy trancers does it take to form a
community?
A:  Sorry bro, you don't belong here.

at first sight of the thread, i thought it said "Filter Happy".... 
which then made me think of a lineup filled with PA's.... either that
or a bunch of dj's hiding their skills behind the Pioneer's Filter
effect.

i know some dj's who are Filter Happy.... ya'all need to lay off of that button!

give me the 1-555-1212, please.  I'm  due to have a
new hole torn.

ps:  I tend to touch strangers if i take empathogens. 
I know, it's weird.  Just feed me Scotch and I'll
stick to fistfights with the men.

pps:  Also please LMK if your "clown suit" comment
refers to Ouchy the Clown.  My emotions get a little
confused taking empathogens around him.

ppps:  never mind, ryan.  I should probably stay home
and owrk on my 05 calendar.

Dude.  Hook me up.  Fuck Ryan's party.  Whatya got to
offer?  Womyn, wine, good pills, beats phatter than
Miami in biker shorts?   More action than Chris
Jackson? 

Oh yeah-- what's a modified party?  It sounds like a
UG branch off.  Or modified cars--- whatup?  Sounds
tighter than a 12-year old back injury, dawg.  

But do the wuzzams there put out aftr a few drinks? 
(I'm talkin 18+) Cuz some of them raver chics just
like to chat about spiritual shit and the human
condition, y'know?   Complicated shit where you spend
all night staring at fractals going "damn!" instead of
having good tymez.

Put me on your mailing list dawg.  We'll do the
hookup, especially if you got Oakland east bouncing 
off.    

boom

Be sure to check out "A Night at the Hip-Hopera":

http://www.kleptones.com/pages/downloads_hiphopera.html

On another list it was described as "25 years of Queen meets 25 years of
Hip Hop", with a bunch of other samples thrown in for good measure. Really
worth the listen.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] thank you sfr, you're better than my grandma's novella

Glad to be of service. The pot was simmering for too long and the soup was 
getting old. Needed some stirring. Maybe I was just bored at work due to the 
holiday lack of work load? YUP. That's exactly it. Just like it always is... 
=D

I know... I should find more worthy targets.

The magical blinky button of epic inducing nature. Fight the power. Hands 
off the blinky button! Although get me trashed and I'm all over it just 
because it cracks me up and everything is amusing to me when trashed. Kinda 
like why I'm about to hit the mall, drink a 40oz and wander around with 
headphones on doing some drunken shopping! Which might I add is THE BEST way 
to do holiday shopping and put up with the holiday chaos in a mall. Everyone 
is just so silly when you're drunk!

Tim why is it you lurk on SFR? You don't rave cuz you are embarrassed

Hahaha. You rock kid. You really do. Almost as much as when you rocked out 
on your 21st, pissed yourself, and had to be carried out of Maritime hall.

Now for the real fun...

"Why Nick is still can't argue intelligently and how he proved it himself"

*Have fun at your trance party?* - Sorry kiddo - No trance at the other 
party. Your party? Well, HAHAHAHA. Big hugs my hardcore lovin' plur boy 
because you got trance coming out of your pants there. So really if you're 
going to clown on a trance party, and all that comes with it, you should 
make sure the event you're defending doesn't have trance. =)

peace+grease

Subject: Re: [sfraves] BSP: Filthier Happier [modified new years]

If I managed this list that sideshow guy would've been so "band" like 10
posts ago.

It's like we're getting cross traffic from the bayraves bb or somethin.

And for the record I don't like techno but I am better than you.

Something to do with not having the social skills of a 12 year old...

Subject: Re: [sfraves] BSP: Filthier Crappier [booty bumpin new years]

that's right!  this is the dude who pissed himself and had to
change his pants.  makes you wonder - i don't normally carry
extra pants in my car.  maybe it's a recurring problem, and he
was boy-scoutin' it.  y'know: "be prepared" or some shit.

i got "depends", but that's just cuz i'm so fucking old.  and
the muscle relaxers and poppers do bad things to my rectum
after i've booty-bumped.  phat pants were my salvation for
years.  no one knew i was "dependable" in more ways than one.

for those who have problems with incontinence, don't bring
another pair of pants with you to the party.  "depends".  they
really work!

SFR is the "bigist" joke in the SF scene?  funny - everyone
always says that bayraves is.  then again, i've never been on
bayraves, so i wouldn't know.

does the "winky" --> ;) indicate humor (or "humour" if you're
british)?

i wasn't there, so i wouldn't know...puke on the table and
"flort" does not necessarily negate the fact that people can
and do piss themselves when they're drunk.  so get this: i had
a female friend who'd shit herself when she was drunk.  that
was fucking nasty.  she'd be by the side of the road with her
pants down.  diarrhea from one end, puke from the other. 
who'dve thunk?

whoa.  i think i was right.  mean drunk.

what is "slader"?  there was this TV show called "sliders" - it
was pretty cool for a bit, and then the drugs wore off.  then
it was fucking lame.

Look, I apologize to everyone on this list for my actions today. It
was childish and stupid. You guys don't like the party fine lets all
go on with our life. I wasn't ever trying to start any drama just
fucking saying this party was going to be good times. Why do you all
have to be such pricks? Can this please be the end before this has to
go any further?

Nick

osby's got it right.  for god's sake, let's just all have a good time on 
NYE.  it's NYE for crying out loud!!!

i'm actually hoping to swing by modified early in the night before i head to 
OW.  why?  because i have friends there and i'd like to wish them a happy 
new year.  just as i have friends at OW.

heck, earlier in the night maybe i can swing by some other places and wish 
those folks a happy NY.

stop the bullshit!  it's like shitting on a birthday cake.

i love you all.

I would also like to make it clear I have nothing to do with the
modified party. The words I spoke do not reflect on them only on
myself. Please don't think negatively about them because these were my
own words. I have nothing to do with them.

Subject: [sfraves] Re: Fitter Happier, Modified, OW.



I have massive respect for Otherworld and FnF.

I'd like to start off with that. One of the best party experiences I've ever had
was at OW, and FnF is a cornerstone of the SF scene.

Now. Raves are dynamic. They thrive off of change. Raving dies with stasis,
because raves are about a celebration of -now-. And now is always different than
a minute ago. :) Also, raves are about youth. When raves are no longer about
dynamism and youth and energy and drugs and right now they stop being raves.

For the rave scene to survive, it needs to remain dynamic. A lot of people like
to talk shit about the 'new kids', these gacked out candy-wearing druggies...
when they were the same way back in 1995. ;) Maybe what I'm trying to
communicate here is -- somebody said 'we're adults - we've put away our toys' in
the mass of this conversation. Raves are about toys. :) Not about being adults.

Modified is the only hope of the 2nd rave generation. You compare them with,
say, the other spots you find youth -- coolworld. skills. the dungeon (sorry,
jared, but fuck that place is scary). Support those kids. They're trying to save
the new school.

I'm not going anywhere for NYE. I'll be holed up in the countryside frying away
the last couple hours of a shitawful year, far away from any respective
geriatravers or kiddies. Maybe when 1201 rolls across PST I'll have some kind of
wonderful moment of spontaneous gnosis. If I do, I promise to communicate it to
you gents.

<3

Sean

This whole thing has reached a point where both sides, it seems to me, have 
lost face.

Bad form to post private comments, no matter how volatile, to a public

As for the community -- it disgusts me, truly, to see this crap.

"The government, which was designed for the people, has got into the hands 
of the bosses and their employers, the special interests.  An invisible 
empire has been set up above the forms of democracy."
-Woodrow Wilson

"Sometime in your life, hope that you might see one starved man, the look 
on his face when the bread finally arrives.  Hope that you might have 
bought it or baked it or even kneaded it yourself.  For that look on his 
face, for your meeting his eyes across a piece of bread, you might be 
willing to lose a lot, or suffer a lot, or die a little, even."
-Daniel Berrigan

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

Ah come on now............ It's like memory lane... So many years ago when
we used to get hundreds of flame threads per day.......... Ahh how I miss
those days.... NOT!!!! Yeah I have actually read all of these posts, and I
have seriously lost allot of respect for many, by these pointless and
INCREDIBLY dis-respectful actions. Hope tomorrow will be a better day!

all we need now is some cheap cocaine and that'll be the end of the end of 
the "Summer of Love, Part II"

(heh...  coke is always plentiful whenever the Republicans are in ascendancy)

what is the situation up there?  I was informed by people down here that 
coke is a little too plentiful
(for their tastes) in the 'mainstream' rave scene  <but then again, it's LA>

Subject: Re: Re: [sfraves] BSP: Fitter Happier [modified new years]

i don't really see anyone talking shit on modified, honestly.  

- "chester" has words to say about element, but not the NYE
party itself.

- i spoke of the break-in aspect, the lack of toilets, the
event accomodating all ages, etc.  but these are clear facts,
not shit-talking.

- ryan started in on the trance when you talked shit about OW
having trance.

i think most of the shit talking has been about *you*, not the
party.  i talked shit on myself, because if i'm going to sling
it around, i'm sure as hell am able to take it, too.

and i don't see how everyone's representing OW.  the posts i've
seen say that they're preferring to go to OW.

i don't see the attacks on modified.  i do, however, see people
reacting to your name-calling, accusations, bigotry,
shit-talking, and various threats (veiled or blatant).  if you
can dish it out, then you should be prepared to take it.  

it's pretty simple.  you can't expect to stir the pot of shit
and have nothing happen.  ryan's the king of shit stirring. 
but he can take it, and doesn't apologize to the list when the
flames start flying and expect everyone to calm down.  shit's
stirred.  he stirred it.  he deals with it.

anyway, it's really no big deal.  it's only SFR.  who cares if
you threw up or (didn't) piss yourself?  i sure as hell don't. 
at one time people started in on some shit that i was gay. 
whatever.  so i go around and tell people my nickname is "teh
geigh".  people can think whatever they want.

i usually would agree with you Apollo and under most
circumstances i would never forward a private e-mail
to a list.  however since i was not involved in this
argument that took place and yet this guy decided to
send me the threat.  i thought i'd better post it to
the people who were a part of it.  so people
understand how far they are pushing him. 
anyways i didn't feel like keeping that super
important info to myself.  
so maybe i was wrong for forwarding the message, but
not as wrong as a guy who e-mails me (somebody who has
nothing to do with the whole argument) to say he will
make sure our party is shut down.  i did what i felt
was the best thing to do.  get everybody on the same
page to try and squash this silliness.
anyways......
i've already talked with Nick privately and everything
is cool.  i hope Modified and OW/FnF both go off this
NYE and i'm sure they both will.    ~Mike

i apologize for pushing this dude to the point where he felt he
had to fuck with OW - however, i feel it should be noted that
most of the pushing was on nick, personally.  most of the
discussion didn't have anything to do with modified.

if nick wanted to piss on *my* parade, that would be fine.  i
actually expected it.  i mean, that's what people do - i got a
problem with *you personally*, i deal with *you*.

anyway.  i'm glad the private post was made public.  most
everything i write, i do so with the potential that it will be
made public.  something i learned a long time ago...and caught
lots of hell for.

OW/FnF will be fun.  modified will be fun.  fun for everyone,
and as i said before, there's room for all of these parties. 
i'm REAL glad modified is throwing this for the people who
can't get into an 18+ event, and/or don't like the music.

Hail to the king baby. Now gimme some sugar. That's just pillow talk. =)

To think that I sent one email to put some stupid comment in check and
then all this happened. Oh wait - yeah I expected that. Just not the
completely uncalled for reactionary someone pissed in my soup antics.

We need a best of SFR just like Craigslist has a best of Craigslist!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Re: Fitter Happier, Modified, OW.

Thank you Sean for posting a lot of what I wanted to say.

In any case, I'm still sickened by the exchange I read today on SFR. And 
I still have a lot more to add to this....

I've had a number of conversations off-list due to this thread and feel a 
few issues need to be checked.

Preface: below I will be referencing 'old-school' & 'new-school' but more 
than that you are all "family" in my eyes. I only make the distinction 
to delineate where I think the conflict arises........

1) This is just a party, and "New Years"...everyone and their mom is 
throwing a party. 
Parties of every flavor, style, and size are happening. Everybody is 
coming out, and all parties can rock-out and co-exist together. There's 
certainly not room (or flavor) for only *one* party to go off this year! 
Plenty of room for all parties to go off the chain!

2) This whole flame was never about Modified vs. OW.
>From what I could gather, the vast majority seriously involved with either 
party wasn't privy to the flame-fest. The crews throwing both these 
parties are oblivious (up till now). Although, attendees are excited, it's NEW 
YEARS!...people are cheerleaders for their event of choice and that's where
the flame started. And reality check....this is about a person(s)-to-person(s)
flame. No crews involved...no animosity whatsoever.

3) Posting private email is bad. But I have talked to mike/ow, and it was 
done out of desperation because he didn't understand what was happening. 
>From our perspective, people were joking around and next a serious threat 
surfaced.

4) Old schoolers need to set an example!
Yeah, you motherfuckers on this list! 
Yeah I'm talking to you ;-)
On SFR we are sarcastic bastards, but it has come to my attention that 
our community is read and referenced on-the-outside. "So what?!?" you may 
ask, but the reality is, aside from having light-hearted jabs of 
exchange, what we say impacts how our community is perceived.

I have witnessed us talk shit about candy-ravers, and trance, but...(and I 
don't care what you say)...many of us went through the experience. And 
now, being jaded, doesn't make us any better, or above anyone.

I understand sfr has become a meeting place for us old 
folks, but in our discussion has it ever occurred that our statements are 
offensive? slandering? or at least distancing?

Perhaps not, but I would bet that's how it comes off. And I don't buy the 
argument that it's 'their' problem. It's *our* problem, because the people 
that we are dissing are the very people that will support and define the 
scene that we've committed our lives to thus far. In my opinion the recent 
active old-school scene has done a piss-poor job of embracing the next 
generation. We seem to be really good at criticizing, but not good at 
producing for our future....at all.

5) New-schoolers should understand that old-schoolers are 
self-deprecating and sarcastic.
What I've gathered is that what the old folks consider as playful banter, 
the younger kids view as slander or 'hating' (god I hate that word ;-)

The one thing I've learned in my overall career of throwing parties is to 
not take myself so seriously. I think other older people learned that too. 
In my early days if you talked shit I would have daggers in my eyes. Now I 
could care less about *anything* really, as long as the party was well put 
together, and I worked my tail off in the effort, and everyone had fun!!

6) Old school wants the New school to rock!
The end goal for everyone to thrive and prosper. I get my kicks from 
seeing other people being blown away from what our scene has to offer. I 
like people coming up and asking me what I'm doing tweaking buttons and 
knobs on a pile of gear. Perhaps part of the problem is those of us with 
resources (multiple sound systems, giant lasers, 10 video projectors, 
or just good advice) are not approachable for their efforts.

Ultimately, seeing this recent conflict makes me a bit ill. I hope 
everyone can see the shit-talking for what is is, and snap up, and 
support all positive efforts for our scene.

:-P

Subject: [sfraves] Now = Let's ring in the New Year with some P.L.U.R. Was - RE: [sfraves] Re: Fitter Happier, Modified, OW.

!!!!!!! THANK YOU !!!!!!!

!!!!!!! THANK YOU !!!!!!!

!!!!!!! THANK YOU !!!!!!!

Terry, for putting some much needed insight and sense into chaos! Personally
I would like to consider myself new-skool and old-skool. 

In my humble opinion, There is always so much to learn from each side of the
spectrum! I learn more everyday from my daughter and she is only 3 years
old..... and everyday she learns more from me........... The cycle never
ends!

P. = PeAcE 

L. = LoVe

U. = UnItY --- That means uniting the young and the old together as one!

R. = ReSpEcT --- Something that was obviously lost sight of over the past
thread war

Personally I don't listen to others when they say P.L.U.R. is dead, give it
up....... It's those who tell me this that I feel need it the most ;-)

It only takes a bad person to put another down, it only takes a good person
to build someone up! 

Take care and P.L.U.R. everyone,

And to all who need a little re-/education Osby will be starting P.L.U.R.
University. Enrolment is always open! The only cost of admission is Love ;-)

Matt

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Re: Fitter Happier, Modified, OW.

Thank you Sean for posting a lot of what I wanted to say.

In any case, I'm still sickened by the exchange I read today on SFR. And 
I still have a lot more to add to this....

I've had a number of conversations off-list due to this thread and feel a 
few issues need to be checked.

Preface: below I will be referencing 'old-school' & 'new-school' but more 
than that you are all "family" in my eyes. I only make the distinction 
to delineate where I think the conflict arises........

1) This is just a party, and "New Years"...everyone and their mom is 
throwing a party. 
Parties of every flavor, style, and size are happening. Everybody is 
coming out, and all parties can rock-out and co-exist together. There's 
certainly not room (or flavor) for only *one* party to go off this year! 
Plenty of room for all parties to go off the chain!

2) This whole flame was never about Modified vs. OW.
>From what I could gather, the vast majority seriously involved with either 
party wasn't privy to the flame-fest. The crews throwing both these 
parties are oblivious (up till now). Although, attendees are excited, it's
NEW 
YEARS!...people are cheerleaders for their event of choice and that's where
the flame started. And reality check....this is about a
person(s)-to-person(s)
flame. No crews involved...no animosity whatsoever.

3) Posting private email is bad. But I have talked to mike/ow, and it was 
done out of desperation because he didn't understand what was happening. 
>From our perspective, people were joking around and next a serious threat 
surfaced.

4) Old schoolers need to set an example!
Yeah, you motherfuckers on this list! 
Yeah I'm talking to you ;-)
On SFR we are sarcastic bastards, but it has come to my attention that 
our community is read and referenced on-the-outside. "So what?!?" you may 
ask, but the reality is, aside from having light-hearted jabs of 
exchange, what we say impacts how our community is perceived.

I have witnessed us talk shit about candy-ravers, and trance, but...(and I 
don't care what you say)...many of us went through the experience. And 
now, being jaded, doesn't make us any better, or above anyone.

I understand sfr has become a meeting place for us old 
folks, but in our discussion has it ever occurred that our statements are 
offensive? slandering? or at least distancing?

Perhaps not, but I would bet that's how it comes off. And I don't buy the 
argument that it's 'their' problem. It's *our* problem, because the people 
that we are dissing are the very people that will support and define the 
scene that we've committed our lives to thus far. In my opinion the recent 
active old-school scene has done a piss-poor job of embracing the next 
generation. We seem to be really good at criticizing, but not good at 
producing for our future....at all.

5) New-schoolers should understand that old-schoolers are 
self-deprecating and sarcastic.
What I've gathered is that what the old folks consider as playful banter, 
the younger kids view as slander or 'hating' (god I hate that word ;-)

The one thing I've learned in my overall career of throwing parties is to 
not take myself so seriously. I think other older people learned that too. 
In my early days if you talked shit I would have daggers in my eyes. Now I 
could care less about *anything* really, as long as the party was well put 
together, and I worked my tail off in the effort, and everyone had fun!!

6) Old school wants the New school to rock!
The end goal for everyone to thrive and prosper. I get my kicks from 
seeing other people being blown away from what our scene has to offer. I 
like people coming up and asking me what I'm doing tweaking buttons and 
knobs on a pile of gear. Perhaps part of the problem is those of us with 
resources (multiple sound systems, giant lasers, 10 video projectors, 
or just good advice) are not approachable for their efforts.

Ultimately, seeing this recent conflict makes me a bit ill. I hope 
everyone can see the shit-talking for what is is, and snap up, and 
support all positive efforts for our scene.

:-P

Well see that's all fine and dandy but the core of this recent thread
war wasn't so dramatic. Dumb comment made. I come in and have a tiny
bit of fun with it. Granted, easy target like always and I knew it
would push buttons. The point was - don't say stupid ego shit like
that if you can't take a good slap in the face online. This isn't a
new concept. I'm not going to get into the new vs old shit because I'm
around BOTH and really that had nothing to do with this until some
people inserted that battle into the thread.

And really? This is SFR. We have fun here. This is what keeps a lot of
us around. =)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Re: Fitter Happier, Modified, OW.

i agree with ryan, but i also agree with terry and sean.

i've been around for awhile, and know that certain people will
get bent out of shape if you tease them.  sometimes they get
bent over stupid shit, sometimes it's warranted.  personally, i
should have known better than to be poking at this particular
individual.  not a good example from an old(er) listee...again,
my apologies to everyone.

but c'mon:  a playful poke in the ribs does not necessitate a
fist in the face.

in my first post, i was actually defending the "new school"
party, but got punched anyway.  one thing i'm not about are
bullies.  seeing as i grew up getting my ass kicked and then
stuffed in trunks of cars on a weekly basis, i'm not one to
take shit from anyone.

but i temper my posts with humor and sarcasm, a lot of which is
lost on people who don't know me (either online or offline). 
wanna call me a queer?  rock on, thanks!  tell me i'm an old
douche bag?  i'm down.

i took these accusations and name callings with humor, even tho
they were intended (it seems) as insults.  but i agree with
ryan:  don't dish it out if you can't take it.

anyway, i've got more important things to do than to incite
drama that'll end up with a busted party.  had i known that
this was a possibility, i'd have never posted.  i'll just stick
to spamming the list with my BSPs in the future.

nick, no hard feelings.  if i ever meet ya, you can make fun of
my "depends", how much of a fag i am, my crappy DJ abilities,
and how much my music sucks.  no shit.  it's cool.  :)

No hard feelings here. Yesterday was a shit day for me and for some
reason I let this get to me. When I steeped away from the computer I
said to myself "why do I care what these guys think. I don't." When I
made the douche bag comment I wasn't necessarily calling you a douche
bag. It just seemed to me that everyone on this list had become more
close minded than ever. I should chose my words more carefully next
time.

You guys really shouldn't assume things about people or crews. I'm not
some nu-school raver and my music preference is far more diverse than
about 80% of people who still attend events.

All in all I'm sorry for my actions, I shouldn't of let everyone get
to me like that. I haven't wigged out on a list or a board like that
for many years.

Ashamed,
Nick

BTW, computers suck- I'm gonna patch linux to run on my Sidekick then

I <3 Jonas!!!

Anyone wanna buy the rest of my house and some of the weird
downtempo/space-loungey shit I have left for sale? Cheap cheap (yes Mr.
RedStickman - now's the time to get 'em cheap, lol)

I don't wanna list 'em, but if enough people are interested in records for
$3.00 or less each - mainly house and the other aforementioned - hit me up.

That would be kinda cool to have a basic polyphonic tone generator on
your hip top and a micro composer//sequencer. Someone actually did
that for the GameBoy. Turned the thing into a music composition
instrument. Kinda funny, but not really needed since you can VST's
that emulate that now.

Intead of Mac vs PC how about the future of chip technology and
multicore processors. Now that Intel has given up on the 4GHz chips
they're going to head into the multicore chips like IBM and Motorola
are. Makes a lot more sense to have a dual cpu in one chip using less
power, creating less heat and offering more cpu power than a faster
clocked chip.

I just hope that they all start implementing intelligent usage
structures at the processor level, because it's pretty clear that just
about nobody in the software world is taking true multiprocessor
support too seriously right now.

"Uh, we support dual processors- look, the OS goes on one chip (and
takes up 8%) and our app goes on the other!" or "Look, we put all the
really intensive stuff on one processor, and this other side of our app
that really doesn't use any CPU on the other!  That's a 5% increase!!"

Whatever happened to the dream of two processors = ~twice as much
power? ;)

The ps3 plans on using a 4 processor system. It seems they are taking
it seriously.

Had the opportunity to throw our own NYE party not come about, I know I would
have been found singing, dancing and passing out baskets fulls of candy
bracelets during Michael's Binary Finary set!

Seriously tho, Kent and I both know a number of the DJs on the OW lineup and no
one can deny that their warehouse isn't the shit.  Our plan 5 weeks ago was in
fact to go to OW - things just worked out differently.  Whether it be PNY,
Modified, Ruby Skye, Tantra, OW or any of the other parties going on - everyone
should plan to have a fun safe night where they feel they will enjoy themselves
most.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Re: Fitter Happier, Modified, OW.

None of this ever happened when everything was
underground. 

Too many parties these days, well since '94. It used
to be everyone went to one party every 6 weeks or so.
Everyone was unified because everyone went to the same
big ass fun underground party. Talked about the same
experience. Not to diss anyone, things are just
different. High school kids didn't go to parties back
then. I was one of the young ones and I was in
college. Hell, the day the scene fell for me was a day
in '94. I walked into a shoe store in the Haight and
heard house music, you never heard electronic music in
public back then... hard to imagine eh?. Next thing I
knew there was a selection of parties to go to every
night. The unity thinned out except for the peeps that
kept it underground. I still go out believe it or not
but on the same terms as WAY back when. Only when
something solid is going on and only every once in a
while. I never got burned out because of this.  

As far as old schoolers go, give us a break. Consider
the fact that if you started going out in the late
80's when the scene REALLY was underground, you
progresses and witnessed the scene going from a tight
family who spread word about parties by a phone tree
and word of mouth, maybe ... maybe black ink hand
bills. Sometimes finding out about a party an hour
before it was ready to go off. People from all over
california and some from OR and WA you would only see
at the parties. Most of these were free or donation as
well because the peeps throwing the party just wanted
peeps to have a good time. Free massages, free water,
etc. Making money wasn't an issue. All the DJ's train
wrecked, even the now big DJ's. Almost every one train
wrecked. DJ's weren't demanding stacks of cash they
were just happy to be part of the party. All of a
sudden big ass color fliers, a party every night of
the week. You started to hear house music or whatever
you want to call it everywhere. Annoying promoters
trying to cash in on the scene. The scene went from
underground to mainstream garbage. Frat boys, high
school kids, I even had to deal with military guys at
one party. Anyone could pick up a flier to any party.
This is not cool. 

So give us old schoolers a break. If you are a new
school kid and like the music, the drugs and the
scene, then learn about what the scene stands for.
Find underground locations. Throw free parties. Throw
parties for the people not the money. Scale back and
bring quality back into the scene. Spread the word by
word of mouth. Unify the people involved. There are
different genres of music these days but if the party
is good and the music of the genre is good then people
will have a good time. Make the drugs cheap again. If
this is your time think really hard why you like the
scene and how you want it to carry on in the future. 

The bay area used to be one of the cornerstones to the
scene in the world. Let's keep it that way and let the
rest of the world hear rumors about parties that are
only heard about.

One last note, I have a recent younger friend who told
me she used to hear about the old school parties back
in the day but didn't believe they actually happened
until I started showing her pictures etc. Now it's
getting time for the new schoolers to carry on the
scene. It's your choice how you go about it and how
you want the future kids to learn about what is
important. Just get it done and do it right. Forget
about how people think of the party and how much money
you can make. Do it to keep the scene alive. See the
big picture.

Enough ranting, peec.

It sounds like somebody needs to develop a distributed audio processing
interface for the new gaming systems. Imagine being able to connect a
$200 console to your laptop via firewire or gigabit ethernet and offload
plug-in processing to its CPU. Yum.

Speaking of which... does anyone here use PowerCore? Are there any other
good external DSPs out there? The UAD-1 is PCI, and I don't want to have
to lug around a break-out box. Plugzilla looks great because you don't
have to buy native plug-ins, but it's not Mac-friendly. Lastly, I hear
Logic 7 Pro has distributed processing built in:

<http://www.apple.com/logic/distributedaudio.html>

But I don't really want to invest in a new DAW just for that... :\

Toodles,

Rabbit Hunters Shoot Up Ravers

A 46 year old gamekeeper and her female assistant terrorised partygoers 
with shotguns at an illegal all night rave, and pleaded guilty to charges 
of possessing a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence this week, at 
Guildford Crown Court, England.

Reportedly they shot out tyres of ravers' cars, blasted speakers, and 
man-handled the party organisers, after confronting the 600 revellers in a 
dawn showdown.

The woodland party had reportedly been pumping out music since midnight, 
prompting 'scores of complaints from neighbours as far as seven miles 
away'.  The assistant told police they'd been hunting rabbits before 
encountering the ravers, who she said told them to 'fuck off' when the pair 
asked them to leave, prompting their excessive reactions.

Both gun-toting ladies await sentencing.

"The government, which was designed for the people, has got into the hands 
of the bosses and their employers, the special interests.  An invisible 
empire has been set up above the forms of democracy."
-Woodrow Wilson

"Sometime in your life, hope that you might see one starved man, the look 
on his face when the bread finally arrives.  Hope that you might have 
bought it or baked it or even kneaded it yourself.  For that look on his 
face, for your meeting his eyes across a piece of bread, you might be 
willing to lose a lot, or suffer a lot, or die a little, even."
-Daniel Berrigan

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

i agree with ryan, but i also agree with terry and sean.

i've been around for awhile, and know that certain people will
get bent out of shape if you tease them.  sometimes they get
bent over stupid shit, sometimes it's warranted.  personally, i
should have known better than to be poking at this particular
individual.  not a good example from an old(er) listee...again,
my apologies to everyone.

but c'mon:  a playful poke in the ribs does not necessitate a
fist in the face.

in my first post, i was actually defending the "new school"
party, but got punched anyway.  one thing i'm not about are
bullies.  seeing as i grew up getting my ass kicked and then
stuffed in trunks of cars on a weekly basis, i'm not one to
take shit from anyone.

but i temper my posts with humor and sarcasm, a lot of which is
lost on people who don't know me (either online or offline). 
wanna call me a queer?  rock on, thanks!  tell me i'm an old
douche bag?  i'm down.

i took these accusations and name callings with humor, even tho
they were intended (it seems) as insults.  but i agree with
ryan:  don't dish it out if you can't take it.

anyway, i've got more important things to do than to incite
drama that'll end up with a busted party.  had i known that
this was a possibility, i'd have never posted.  i'll just stick
to spamming the list with my BSPs in the future.

nick, no hard feelings.  if i ever meet ya, you can make fun of
my "depends", how much of a fag i am, my crappy DJ abilities,
and how much my music sucks.  no shit.  it's cool.  :)

Hey call me a "Douche Bag" anytime! I think it's a compliment! I mean how
could that be considered an insult? I mean anything that gets me closer to a
girls kitty is in NO WAY A PUT DOWN! Plus I would think it to be a wonderful
thing to aid in the process of helping clean the kitty from the tuna that
swam up there and died :-) See it's all about how you look at things ;-)

No hard feelings here. Yesterday was a shit day for me and for some
reason I let this get to me. When I steeped away from the computer I
said to myself "why do I care what these guys think. I don't." When I
made the douche bag comment I wasn't necessarily calling you a douche
bag. It just seemed to me that everyone on this list had become more
close minded than ever. I should chose my words more carefully next
time.

You guys really shouldn't assume things about people or crews. I'm not
some nu-school raver and my music preference is far more diverse than
about 80% of people who still attend events.

All in all I'm sorry for my actions, I shouldn't of let everyone get
to me like that. I haven't wigged out on a list or a board like that
for many years.

Ashamed,
Nick

Yes chris you pegged it on the nose! I am 100% a pervert and proud ;-) the
12+ years on this list I have ALWAYS talked about sex! Well I think my
"Kermit" handle was more notable about the Ghetto Children/Parties Thread
that well seems to upset all the people who grew up in the Ghetto. But I am
sure I talked about sex under that handle too ;-) Because well I am pervert
and proud :-)

I certainly know when I used the "Cracked Out Elmo" handle Sex was a daily
topic for me ;-) Sex at e parties is the best :-) I have many fond candy
raver days going to house parties or having some of my own....... and well
having wonderful sexual experiences in couple form or group ;-) Ahhh How I
miss those days ;-) I can defiantly say I have only had sex a 2 actual rave
events though! That is such a shame :-( I must do something to change that!
I have a quest! 

BTW :-> The Orgy at the Los Gatos Mountain Estate was actually a joke of
sorts ;-) I never let it happen sad to say! The 4x8 foot shower with 7
Shower heads and body sprays never got to experience the SFR orgy :-( One
thing I learned from that thread was I am not the only pervert ;-) I
received many emails from individuals and couples with pictures expressing
interest :-) And a majority of them were females ;-) Some of which I still
talk to routinely today ;-)

The scene for me is about :

The Music and Having Sex listening to it ;-) Really funky when you grove to
different styles, ahhh the pleasures .........

The Drugs and Having Sex On them ;-)

The people and being sexually united with them ;-)


Sighed,
Your Never Ending SFR Pervert Douche Bag

A couple of months ago I probably would have said, "because nobody here
likes techno." But if the fact that the Rickshaw Stop was packed solid
for Swayzak and Matthew Dear on a *Monday* a couple of weeks ago is any
indication, that's just not true.

What the bay area seems to be sorely lacking are promoters with the
right combination of connections, money, and balls to book that kind of
lineup. I spoke briefly to a fellow listmember about the possibility of
a Mutek tour coming to SF, but I haven't heard anything else about it.
And I'm completely in the dark about any decent techno coming up in the
near future aside from on NYE. Anyone?

> I'd be out EVERY weekend if there were shows like this here..

No shit, me too. I'd be down just to see Andrew Weatherall or Robert
Hood by themselves, let alone all those other gods. :)

Speaking of Mr. Weatherall, I have to say the new Two Lone Swordsmen
album is finally growing on me. I didn't really enjoy it the first
couple of times through, but being in a somber mood for a couple of days
straight seems to have made it much more appealing. Those of you into
the electro(clash)/synth-rock thing should definitely check it out.

Toodles,

Sure that.  One could dance non-stop, 24 hours a day, from Friday through 
Monday morning.  This was from the late eighties on here in 
SF.  Amazing,  diverse parties and venues both above and underground.  You 
showed up at an event on Thursday or Friday nite, collected little fliers 
or phone numbers from friends, and you were set for the next 72 hours :-)

Love,

Apollo

"The government, which was designed for the people, has got into the hands 
of the bosses and their employers, the special interests.  An invisible 
empire has been set up above the forms of democracy."
-Woodrow Wilson

"Sometime in your life, hope that you might see one starved man, the look 
on his face when the bread finally arrives.  Hope that you might have 
bought it or baked it or even kneaded it yourself.  For that look on his 
face, for your meeting his eyes across a piece of bread, you might be 
willing to lose a lot, or suffer a lot, or die a little, even."
-Daniel Berrigan

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

Subject: Re: [sfraves] The way it should be..

yes.  nobody's home.  that's the name of the song.  i first got into 
ulrich when i heard the song blumenweise nechen autobahn, which i think 
translates to "flowers growing near the freeway".  i was going to see 
him perform live in DC but unfortunately he broke his hand or something 
like that.  so i'll just have to wait.

btw ... if you're curious, my music wishlist is on my site now:

http://www.deepfog.com/music/wishlist.html

why?  why not?

love,

shit, maybe our inability to obtain such resources as

hey SFR-sters, 

if anyone here caught our B-family Halloween party at the Tenderloft (AKA The Drummachine Museum), you prolly remember some of this mad stuff I was dropped on em that night. 

contents-wise, a few different styles are represented -  Baltimore Club (AKA Baltimore Breaks), Spectral Sound (AKA Ghostly International), D12 (Eminem), Crunk (AKA Dirty South), plus a few house and electro classics and other choice toons. 

check out "Baby Daddy - Bomb Scurred" on Bfamily's mix page:
http://www.bfamilyrecords.com/mixes/ 

cheers, 
BD

holy cow.  THAT was the kid who pissed and puked all
over himself?  I'll never forget that crowd of chics
laughing.  That was mean but so funny.  We were joking
about that for weeks.   Sideshow heck--- that act
deserved main stage attention.

That was some funny stuff, pissin all over himself
like that.  It stunk too, huh?

Stuff like that is why I still go out to parties.

my belief is that threats belong to the  public domain
(especially if we're going to be kicking down $ to
hear trance.)

Razzing the village idiot is an age-old social
tradition.  That's how we draw boundaries for socially
acceptable behavior.  It's all just checks & balances.

happy holidays,
boom

hehe

so I got some home grown from this co. on eBay. . .=20
good stuff, nice smell. . .strong stuff. . .
It seems to effect older cats more than younger ones. . .they eat it, =
lick it, roll in it, viciously try to get it. . . afterwards they kinda =
tripp off lil things like noises n objects, and kinda have a lil "whoa" =
look in their eyes. . .

how does it actually effect them ? The smell seems to effect em, I would =
guess eating it does too. . . it seems kinda similar to pot. . .=20

anyone know ? like is it an actual drug effect or are the cats just so =
attracted to the smell that they just seriously fall in love with the =
stuff ?

The pleasure factor in catnip is the chemical nepetalactone, which seems to 
have a mildly hallucinogenic effect on cats.  Nepetalactone is similar to a 
substance found in the urine of female cats, and this may be why unneutered 
males have stronger reactions to catnip than females and neutered males. 
Some speculate that nepetalactone stimulates the region of a cat's brain 
associated with sexual behavior.

It's not just domestic house cats that have an affinity for catnip -- even 
lions, pumas, and leopards are said to enjoy it. But not every cat will get 
a catnip buzz. Kittens don't react to catnip until they are six to eight 
months old. And roughly 20% to 50% of all cats have no reaction to the 
stuff. Catnip sensitivity is genetic and may also be influenced by learning 
and experience.

Catnip is harmless and non-addictive.

Christmas and Saturnalia

The early (4th century AD) Church Fathers had no official date to celebrate 
the birth of Jesus.  No one really knows his exact birthday.   The Church, 
however, understood that it was much easier to convert "pagans" to 
Christianity if they adopted the pagan holidays, and often symbology, and 
transformed them into Christian religious events.


Saturnalia

Ancient Romans conveniently happened to have a popular pagan holiday (holy 
day) season called "Saturnalia." Saturnalia, originally celebrated by the 
Romans each year on December the 17th, was a special day set apart for 
honoring the Roman god Saturn. This was a day for nostalgically remembering 
the "Golden Age" of Saturn's beneficent rule. Gifts were exchanged in 
remembrance of the bounty Saturn had once upon a time bestowed upon the 
Roman people.
For the ancient Romans, Saturnalia was joyous celebration of "the good old 
days" when everything had "once-upon-a-time" been right in the world.

In addition to feasting, the Romans celebrated Saturnalia by giving gifts 
of wax candles and earthenware figures, and engaged in temporary role 
reversals. For the celebration, masters would serve their slaves.  A funny 
felt-peaked hat was one costume component.   Decorations included greenery 
swags and garland and gilded objects (gold  to symbolize the yellow sun), 
and candles in window openings.


Rebirth of the Sun

At some point in time, the holy day of Saturnalia had also been tied into 
being a celebration of the rebirth of the Sun - and, as such, Saturnalia 
was held each year about the time of the "winter solstice." Each year, the 
winter solstice marks the beginning of winter. The winter solstice is the 
day each year having the longest night and the shortest amount of sunlight 
hours. After the winter solstice, the daylight hours slowly begin lasting 
longer and longer with each passing day, with this trend of increasing 
sunlight continuing on until the "summer solstice" in June. The summer 
solstice is marked as being the day with longest amount of daylight hours 
and is the official beginning of summer.

The winter solstice takes place each year around December the 21st to mark 
the rebirth of the Sun. In 4th Century AD, the Roman emperor at the time 
"officially" reset Saturnalia to be celebrated on December the 25th (there 
appear to be varying and sometimes contradictory resources regarding 
exactly how and why all this happened).

Shortly thereafter, the Church Fathers likewise set the official date for 
celebrating the birth of Jesus as being December the 25th. What more 
appropriate day could the Church Fathers have "borrowed" for commemorating 
the birth of the Son, than the already extremely popular pagan holiday 
(Saturnalia) set apart for celebrating the rebirth of the true Sun?

Go forth and be merry!!!!

Happy Saturnalia.

Love,

Apollo

MERRY FESTIVUS EVERYONE!!!!

I'm having the Greatest Festivus....EVER in memory right now, even as
I type this, my life has been one miracle after another, and as Martha
sez, 'it's a good thing.'

great answer Apollo, answered a lot of unasked questions on my end.

I had about a dozen bushes in the garden this year that did so-so,
which I grew for Albert The Benevolent plurtastic kitty that rules our

He loves him some of that catnip, it's like catnip to him.

We've been buying him a fresh indoor growing plants every week since
the start of the Vernal Equinox from the local farmer's market.

He's usually the most respectful keeper of boundaries that I've ever
seen in a cat, but get him near one of those bad boys and he loses all
of his usual regal sense of deportment.

We've been over the whole 'delayed gratification' bit where if you let
the plants grow todayn there will many more catnip leaves for you
tomorrow, but he obstinately refuses to see it, though today's
Festivus Catnip harvest may finall get him to see the point.

in the dirt though.
tires don't grow on trees, 
they're pumped out of the ground.
and gettin the tail loose on gravel does actually make
you faster. cough!rally!cough!

unless you wanna e-tray.
i will dominate you with the tray!!!

lift throttle, e-brake, left foot brake, 
whatever's clever mr. dave.

there's a drift school at thunderhill early '05.
drift racing on half, grip racing on half. 
that shizz kills me. 
GRIP racing. 
er, real racing!?!?! DUH!!!

drifting to racing = ice dancing to hockey.

p.s.- i do play "rave" music when i rallycross, which
is where i drift, so, YAY RAVES!!!

When I opened my first shiny and new gmail account, since I now had
the room to do so, I created a special filter for the collected werks

Talk about your Festivus Miracles.....=20

On Wednesday evening that folder crossed the 100 message threshold,
making it one of the best presents ever that the Multiverse has given
me.

This truly is the best Festivus, ever.

May you and yours all find it the same.

:D

Peace, Love, Unity, and Mad Respect,

It's not how many cowbell buttons you have, but rather how often you whack
them.

It's almost like you want one really righteous cowbell if you're a
purist... the second you're rocking two, it's kinda more of an agogo
thing.

Not like anybody should listen to my input on this topic... my favorite
cowbell tune is "live wire" by Motley Crue.  Which I just got reminded of
last night.  I was sitting at a friend's house watching cable, and
apparently they're constructing a bionic Vince Neil with new improved
super human hearing, appearance and cocaine tolerance.

I'd complain about technology's incessant forward advance, but then it
would suck to give up lasers, unix, laptops (with usb powered controllers
that fit in my backpack - WHOOOO) and hi fidelity amplification.

Subject: [sfraves] NRR - Asia Officials Failed to Issue Warning - Reason for mass death! 20k dead & more expected

Guess we are lucky to live in a place where technology lets up know all that
needs to be known! Even a tacky color scheme to alert us of our current
terror threat level!

Asia Officials Failed to Issue Warnings 


By MICHAEL CASEY, Associated Press Writer 

JAKARTA, Indonesia - Asian officials conceded Monday that they failed to
issue broad public warnings immediately after a massive undersea earthquake
in Indonesia, which could have saved countless lives from the subsequent
giant waves that smashed into nine countries. 


But governments insisted they did not know the true nature of the threat
because there was no international system in place to track tidal waves in
the Indian Ocean - an area where they are rare - and they can't afford to
buy sophisticated equipment to build one. 


And what warnings there were came too little, too late. 


The magnitude 9.0 earthquake - the largest in 40 years - shifted huge
geological plates beneath the sea northwest of Sumatra island, causing a
massive and sudden displacement of millions on tons of water. 


Indonesia villages closest to the temblor's epicenter were swamped within
minutes, but elsewhere the waves radiated outwards, gathering speed and
ferocity until they made landfall. 


Waves began pummeling southern Thailand about one hour after the earthquake.
After 2 1/2 hours, the torrents had traveled some 1,000 miles and slammed
India and Sri Lanka. Malaysia, the Maldives, Myanmar, and Bangladesh were
also hit. Eventually they struck Somalia, on the east coast of Africa. 


The death toll Monday stood at nearly 20,000, with millions left homeless. 


Indonesian officials said they had no way to know that the earthquake had
caused the earthquake-driven waves, or tsunamis, or how dangerous they might
have been. 


"Unfortunately, we have no equipment here that can warn about tsunamis,"
said Budi Waluyo, an official with Indonesia's Meteorology and Geophysics
Agency. "The instruments are very expensive and we don't have money to buy
them." 


But Thammasarote Smith, a former senior forecaster at Thailand's
Meteorological Department, said governments could have done much more to
warn people about the danger. 


"The department had up to an hour to announce the emergency message and
evacuate people but they failed to do so," Thammasarote was quoted as saying
in The Bangkok Post newspaper. "It is true that an earthquake is
unpredictable but a tsunami, which occurs after an earthquake, is
predictable." 


Kathawudhi Marlairojanasiri, the department's chief weather forecaster, said
it had sent out warnings through radio and television from 9 a.m. on Sunday
about a possible undertow along the southwest coast of Thailand, where tens
of thousands of foreign tourists were vacationing. 


But the warnings came after the first waves hit. A Web site warning went up
three hours later - but by then, at least 700 people had died in Thailand,
including a jet-skiing grandson of revered monarch King Bhumibol Adulyadej. 


Sulamee Prachuab, department's Seismological Bureau, said the department
could not give a real-time warning because it did not have the satellite
technology to do it. 


Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra refused to answer reporters'
questions Tuesday about tsunami alerts. 


But Australian Prime Minister John Howard said he would investigate what
role his country could play in setting up an Indian Ocean warning system.
One Australian official said at least a year would be needed to set one up. 


Scientists said seismic networks in the region recorded Sunday's earthquake,
but without wave sensors in oceans that would have tracked the path of the
waves, there was just no way to determine the direction a tsunami would
travel. 

   



"If they had tidal gauges and a tsunami warning system, many people who died
would have been saved," said Waverly Person, director of the U.S. Geological
Survey (news - web sites) national earthquake information service in Golden,
Colo. 

"They could have tracked the waves," he said. "They won't tell you how high
the waves will be, but they can tell you when they will hit. Local
authorities can warn citizens to get off the coast." 

Such a system presumes, however, an organized communication system and
widely understood procedures and discipline by hotel operators, fishing
villages, and local authorities to clear the coastline quickly in case of a
coming disaster. 

Most of developing Asia lacks such infrastructure, and casualties were by
far highest in three highly impoverished areas - the coasts of eastern Sri
Lanka and southeastern India, and the northern tip of Indonesia's Sumatra
island. 

An international warning system in the Pacific was started in 1965, the year
after tsunamis associated with a magnitude 9.2 temblor struck Alaska in
1964. It is administered by the U.S-based National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration. 

Member states include all the major Pacific rim nations in North America,
Asia and South America, as well as the Pacific islands, Australia and New
Zealand. 

Tsunamis occur only occasionally, but they are much rarer in the Indian
Ocean than the Pacific, where one occurs every few years. 

Phil McFadden, chief scientist with the government-funded Geoscience
Australia, said that places close to the epicenter of the earthquake would
have been hit so quickly that any warning would have come too late. 

But if there had been a Pacific-style alert system covering the Indian
Ocean, "there would have been time for people in Sri Lanka, across in the
Maldives or somewhere like that to have done something about it," he said.

Take off your front anti-sway bar, lower the air pressure in your front
tires and raise it in the rear and a FF can slide around nicely.

That just makes the rear end come around easier, you still don't have any
fine-control of rear end traction like you do in a FR car. (via the
throttle)

Hmmm- I guess you could park both back wheels on some cafeteria trays and
the lock the ebrake :D

sure, but one of my points is that everyone went to
most of the same parties because that was all we had
back then. 90- early 93, late 93, 94 started getting
crazy. now you have many parties to chose from any day
of the week. then there would be one big party every 6
+/- weeks or so.

btw i love you all .

Subject: [sfraves] OG partying (was: Re: Fitter Happier, Modified, OW.)

really?  for me it was different - i went to lots of big
parties every week (mostly on fri/sat, clubs were the other
days).  these weren't UG family events, however:  one could
easily get a flyer in your local record store or at an event.

Take off your front anti-sway bar, lower the air pressure in your front
tires and raise it in the rear and a FF can slide around nicely.

"sliding" != "drifting"

hahah- i can slide too in my blue bean korean FF masterpiece, but short

sure you can lift throttle or trail brake in and get sideways but jeez-

Subject: [sfraves]  Fitter Happier, Modified, OW (Back in the Days Thread)

Well I use to go to parties "Back in the days" I started going to parties in 
the early 90's 1991 to be exact. And there are a select few on this list 
that have been going to parties since that time and before so im sure they 
can comment as well.

I disagree that there were very few parties back then. There were a whole 
host of parties back then but it was pretty much all "Underground" back then 
the only difference is that you had the larger parties 
(Gatherings,Basics,Funky tekno tribe,Love american style etc) and you had 
the smaller or mini massive scale (Origin,wally world,wheres waldo etc) and 
I do recall seeing lots of the same people at parties just because I think 
most of us attended quality parties, so therefor you saw alot of the same 
people.

There were alot of promoters back then doing events, but back then I think 
there was more of a network thing going on, for instance if you did a big 
event you didn't dare go against a gathering or basics cause you would most 
likely lose your ass.. So therefore Gathering,FTT and other big crews 
"owned" that night so to speak.. it was more a matter of respect and 
economics.. But that doesn't mean that smaller crews didn't do events on 
that same night like Harmony or other young UG crews of that same era..


Some crews that I recall from early 90's

Martin O'Brien  (Gathering,basics,Vision )
Mike     (Juice parties)
Mark (Where the wild things are)
Vlad Cood (Xmen,FGE)
Jerry and Kevon (Funky Tekno Tribe)
Wally & Jimmy (Sin,Wallly World etc)
Scott & Robbie hardkiss (Oasis nightclub)
Kyle and Lori (Recycle )
Manny from San Jose (Getdown,Getdown,Getdown)
Halim (A rave called Sharon)
Cool world

So those are just 11 promoters that I know from back then. There were a shit 
more but I did not know them personally and don't recall names.

Subject: Re: [sfraves]  Fitter Happier, Modified, OW (Back in the Days Thread)

I went to exactly one real party back in the day which
was in late 1993 or 1994.  It was a  full moon party
on the beach at Bonny Doon.  It was a total accident
that I showed up there with some of my hippy Burning
Man friends that my (ex-)wife didn't approve of too
much.  I had no clue what what was going on, but I
caught the vibe.

Later I went to a really weird event, I think it was
called the Freedom Celebration, which was on July 4th
at the Concourse in SF.  It was more of a technology
showcase than a rave which was why I was "on the
list." I was there with my ex-wife and this German
film crew that was documenting my family at the time
(it was called *Cyberland* and its in German if you
can find a copy.) Timothy Leary and all the Mondo 2000
folks where there.  The stereoscopic projections were
awesome, but the party, well it sucked.

I went to one quasi-rave in Orlando in the summer of
1994 that was totally crazy with people dancing on the
speakers and everything.  We were at SIGGRAPH and
totally sleep deprived so maybe I imagined the whole
thing.

Since I remarried I started going out again, but more
to clubs than undergrounds because, well its reliable
and I know some of the DJs etc.  Hey I'm old and out
of the loop. ;)

Peace,

Peter

Hey Mac,

You forgot the epic "Remembrance", "Last Minute
Groove" and "Vertigo" parties!! ;)  Hehehe..

Oh, and did you hear that Wally was shot and killed as
well?  I heard that from someone a few years back, but
never knew for sure.  Ran into Halim from Sharon about
3 years ago.  He stank like piss and god knows what
else. He was soooo strung out on heroin he didn't even
recognize me even though I played soooo many of his
events and after parties at the Troc.  Damn.  Those
surely WERE the days.  Glad they're gone tho..cause
i'd probably be dead.

=)

That party I believe was "A child is born" it was a $5 party at one step 
beyond and got way the fuck shut down cause there was a GANG of fools up in 
the area and rushed the doors or some shit like that. I was there for about 
10 min then jetted to the city to go to " mind the gap" at Ceasars latin 
Palace

And the party that your thinking of Phil that eric use to do was at the 
coleman avenue space forget the name but I use to go to that too  :-)


Big ups to the ol days...

I have recently started using thunder bird. The only thing I don't
like is when I reply to an email it starts your cursor off at the
bottom of the email. Anyone know where the option to move it to the
top is?

Looks like you might not have this right if you're black.  Here's video
coverage of election day from Ohio:
http://460design.net/ohio

Makes me sick.  But I truly already knew this about my country's
leadership.  All the more reason to write Barbara Boxer and ask her to
contest the vote: http://www.contestthevote.org/

Writing Boxer is a waste of time.  I've written her on
several issues, including her support of the RAVE act
and various intellectual property issues, and her
staff has never responded with anything other than the
briefest impersonal form letter telling me that they
were going to ignore my concerns.  Just my .02 of
course, YMMV, etc.

But the decision behind those form letters (I've gotten many myself) is
shaped by the input she gets (as long as the numbers overpower whatever
lobbyist "input" she's gotten. ;)

hello, this is a continuation of a fictional piece:
 
and from on high, a great white light streaked across the sky, but it never made it to the cave, because it was only a horizontal light that didn't make it down to past the tops of the trees in the park. ig peaked out of the cave to see what was taking so long for the light to flood the environment and to expose the stranger. upon viewing the light, a surge of anger pulsed through ig like none ever before:
 
"wow, that was like a surge of anger pulsing through me like none before."
 
"you are an angry person, ig, in general."
 
"no, i am not, you vermon." :) by: lazy for the lucky

electronic/live acts in SF right now-  Not to mention their live shows
make you go crazy & pee your pants-- AND their tracks on Princehouse
and International DeeJay Gigolo are by far in the top ten most
well-produced tunes in 2004.


 and also because they're playing on New Years Eve at...

Subject: Re: [sfraves] BSP: Why Bad Kitty wants to hump THE INVISIBLES....

Sorry but no love to that treo. Stick to DJ'ing. Actually their
drummer is good. The fucking 1 fingered stupid dnb riffs are tired and
old. So is the screaming and quasi-punk crap that's got this city in a
death grip. Sorry, but production value. I can think of several better
live acts that could dance circles around them while playing still
their instruments. Sick and tired of hearing these kids get hyped.
They're riding their name recognition from an era that's fading
quickly.

MICHAEL GARRETT
1952-2004

Michael Garrett, longtime admired DJ and owner of the CD Record Rack, who 
achieved fame playing at the I-Beam, Trocadero, Galleria and Giftcenter 
parties, passed away at home in his sleep on December 10, 2004. He is 
survived by three brothers, Tim in San Francisco, Richard and Phillip in 
Texas, partner Robert Kimler, longtime close friend Steve Fabus, Randy 
Schiller, Sam Schneider, Jerry Bonham, Jimmy Horde and many other friends, 
associates and admirers.

Michael was a showman that reminded DJ's that "making a musical statement 
is great as long as you're giving people a party". Michael loved San 
Francisco and in many ways personified the city with his charm, wit and 
playful irreverence. He made you feel at home and part of a family on and 
off his dance floor. His long running Sunday T-Dance at the I-Beam gave 
people a sense of connection and belonging throughout the darkest days of 
the epidemic, and his record store, the CD Record Rack was a social center 
for the community.

Michael would be the first to remind you that life should be pleasurable. 
That we are here to break down barriers and explore. To live life to the 
fullest. Not to take ourselves too seriously. And definately have some fun.

A gathering of friends will celebrate Michael's time in their lives on 
Saturday, January 15, 2005 at 2pm at Moby Dick, 4089 18th Street in the 
Castro. Please contact Steve Fabus at sfabus@sbcglobal.net for more 
information.

"Sometime in your life, hope that you might see one starved man, the look 
on his face when the bread finally arrives.  Hope that you might have 
bought it or baked it or even kneaded it yourself.  For that look on his 
face, for your meeting his eyes across a piece of bread, you might be 
willing to lose a lot, or suffer a lot, or die a little, even."
-Daniel Berrigan

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

Subject: [sfraves] Finally, a clean way to block ads? (and NYE)

Randomly stumbled upon this just a few minutes ago and thought it was so
clean that I should share it with you.  Firefox appears to really
cleanly block ads.  They document some CSS that you can use here:
http://www.mozilla.org/support/firefox/adblock
The file they refer to doesn't exist by default, and you likely will
have to click through a link or 2 to figure out exactly where the file
should reside on your OS, but it's well worth it.

Once you're done, check out the difference at my site
(http://www.jcthedj.com) for example, both in Firefox with adblocking
and in another browser without adblocking.  Firefox CLEANLY blocks the
ad!  I'm impressed!

So, to keep this RR, who's going where for NYE?

it's a sad day, indeed.  michael used to put me on his
guestlist at the i-beam back when i was under 21.  this was A
LONG TIME AGO mind you.  ;)

i still have some of my records i bought at the record rack.  i
remember hanging out with him and neon leon way back when. 
this was long before rave had hit SF, and i was still listening
to goth, industrial, and more poppy shit like new order,
depeche mode, and book of love.  he was one of the first people
to introduce me to acid house.

terrible news.

Just came from the space earlier tonight. You'd think they were
North-pole elves getting ready for x-mas or something. Busy bees all over
...but not.

Everyone's psyched, myself included. Everyone's going over-the-top.

We're throwing down the gauntlet, with hugs of course =)

i will be serving them up very large and chunky.  the special of the

i don't know about anyone else, but i'm getting tired of hard banging 
techno for every freakin' peak hour slot since 1996... time to bring 
back the funk!

"Sweatin' to the Oldies" is going to be hard to top, but i'll give it a 
shot.  (If you remember, be sure to ask Araya about her Richard Simmons

Subject: [sfraves] List harvesting?

So have any of you mysteriously showed up on DJ or event promoter
announce lists?

This has happened to me several times, and based on the lists I'm
showing up on, I'm thinking it's SFR. I'm curious to see if anyone
else suspects this.

Dolce appears to have evolved out of mixedelements for me.  I think
Trevor is behind dolce.

But there are a handful of others that seem to have come from here.
Maybe should use sneakemail.com for this list also.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] List harvesting?

That protection money goes to protecting us from Sticky's nakedness. 
remember if you make eye contact with him while naked your no longer
protected, you're inviting him to come over and rub up against ya. 
He's like a cat, he's gotta rub his scent on you to mark you as his,
so he can have his way with you through out the night.  So beware. 
When michael's pants go down, so should your eyes.

AVOID EYE CONTACT AT ALL COSTS!!!!

Just a friendly saftey announcement.

Subject: [sfraves] Bright River (SRR)

I went and saw this show last night at the Traveling Jewish Theatre, and
it was fucking amazing. It's a spoken-word-ish storytelling with minimal
Jewish flair, all backed by a band consisting of an upright bassist, a
cellist, with beatboxed percussion and sound effects by Kid Beyond. Tim
Barsky, the writer, performs the spoken word portion and plays flute (he
even does this wierd beatbox flute thing). All of the musicians are very
talented, but Kid Beyond definitely steals the show. Stylistically, the
music spans a number of genres, from jazz to hip-hop, house and some
really interesting Asian-influenced breakbeats. Here's the site:

<http://www.epicarts.org/brightriver/>

I would highly recommend this to anyone that enjoys live performance.
The story has a really great message, and everyone that I spoke to
afterwards was just blown away by the performers. It's playing through
Saturday at the TJT, then in Berkeley from January 5-16. Check it out!

Cheers,

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Finally, a clean way to block ads? (and NYE)

Recently I saw a guy at a bar playing top 40 stuff and he was spinning
on two CDJ-100s and a DJM-600...

The guy was cutting the bass on 50 cent every other bar and hitting the
"trance button" all the freakin' time!  

Hearing ACDC's "Highway To Hell" with the Pioneer flanger on it... 
Damn damn funny :)

What ever happened to Herb Lubalin, Grapus, Tadanori Yokoo, Ken Adam (the 
Dr. Stranglelove/James Bond set guy), Kate Gibb, Saul Bass, Shinro Ohtake, 
Keiji Ito, Willy Fleckhaus, and all those Polish poster artists?

Being a designer used to mean you drove a Benz and you could get good 
drugs. Now it means you own a computer. What the fuck? You start out 
thinking you're going to blow people's minds with your incredibly unique 
take on the beauty that surrounds us all, and by the time you actually get 
your career in motion you're essentially a wedding photographer chained to 
a desk.

It starts in design school, where they have so few computers they make you 
learn Microsoft Word forever under the pretense that you're "getting the 
foundations." By the time you graduate, the little bit of software 
knowledge you did get is totally out-of-date (even as I write this Quark is 
getting phased out to make room for InDesign). You think you can reverse 
all this drudgery when you make your first club flyer but that's when the 
pain really sets in. You see, your ideas don't mean shit to the client. He 
couldn't be bothered learning how to use a computer, so what he wants to do 
is use you as a human paintbrush. Any idea you come up with, no matter how 
mundane, is going to be further bastardized by his shitty Guido taste until 
the final result is a perfect example of everything you hate. There, you 
got into design as part of the solution and now you're just another part of 
the problem. Still want to learn more? OK, if you fucking insist

"The government, which was designed for the people, has got into the hands 
of the bosses and their employers, the special interests.  An invisible 
empire has been set up above the forms of democracy."
-Woodrow Wilson

"Sometime in your life, hope that you might see one starved man, the look 
on his face when the bread finally arrives.  Hope that you might have 
bought it or baked it or even kneaded it yourself.  For that look on his 
face, for your meeting his eyes across a piece of bread, you might be 
willing to lose a lot, or suffer a lot, or die a little, even."
-Daniel Berrigan

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

that's right

Buenos Aires Club Fire Kills 169, Injures 375


Fri Dec 31, 2004 02:21 AM ET


By Hilary Burke




BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (Reuters) - A blaze in a Buenos Aires nightclub 
packed with young people celebrating the New Year holidays killed at least 
169 and injured 375, city officials said on Friday.

The blaze is thought to have been caused by a flare being fired into the 
club's ceiling, sending burning debris onto the crowd and triggering a 
stampede.

"The fire spread in a minute and we were a mountain of people trying to 
escape," said survivor Ariel Monges, 25, who lost a friend and a cousin in 
the fire and was searching for another friend at the Rivadavia Hospital.

The flares are sold on streets all over Latin America for the New Year 
holiday festivities.

Local media reported that as many as 3,000 to 4,000 people may have been 
inside the Republica Cromagnon club in the gritty, run-down neighborhood of 
Once listening to a band when the fire broke out an hour before midnight on 
Thursday.

Children as young as 10 were among the victims in what was being described 
as one of Argentina's worst disasters, according to people helping in the 
rescue effort.

"The city does not remember such a grave situation," city health secretary 
Alfredo Stern said.

Witnesses told Reuters reporters on the scene that a flare was shot into 
the club's ceiling, which was covered with foam. Pieces of the burning 
ceiling fell, triggering a stampede and many people collapsed from smoke 
inhalation.

"There are versions that flares caused the fire, but I cannot confirm this 
until we have more information from the fire department," Mayor Anibal 
Ibarra told TN television.

It was not immediately clear if fire exits and doors were unblocked.

PARENTS DESPERATE

Police said the fire was extinguished quickly, but rescue workers spent a 
few hours removing people on stretchers from inside the club.

Television showed pictures of the bodies lying on the sidewalks outside the 
club.

Parents first rushed to the scene desperate to find their sons and 
daughters amid the chaos, but then flocked to the 14 hospitals where the 
dead and injured were taken.

At a makeshift morgue in a garage beside the club, witnesses said 30 bodies 
were lined up and family members were allowed to pass to identify them.

"There was a girl who must have been around 10 years old," said Fernando 
Justiniano, a former fireman who helped in the rescue. "She was asphyxiated 
poor thing, and she was burned."

The blaze was the worst in the Americas since a supermarket fire in 
neighboring Paraguay last August killed nearly 400 people. The owners are 
accused of closing the doors after the fire broke out to stop looting.

Many other fires have occurred in Latin America in recent years because of 
fireworks, sold on most every street corner around the holidays.

Exactly three years ago, more than 300 people were killed when a fire 
roared through a crowded shopping area in the Peruvian capital Lima. The 
blaze started with an explosion at a shop selling fireworks for New Year 
parties.

Thursday night's Buenos Aires club fire recalled a similar blaze in the 
United States in February 2003 when a pyrotechnics display at the start of 
a heavy metal concert ignited sound-proofing material at a club in Rhode 
Island, killing 100 people and injuring nearly 200.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] BSP: Why Bad Kitty wants to hump THE INVISIBLES....

um... I think you are talking about the wrong group- the invisibles
have no drummer!!!

the person I Think you're speaking of is Ed UFO who plays with mixed
signals, not the INVISIBLES.

the invisibles two tracks that came out this year are crowd rockers- no
d&b here-

the hot to trot remix on princehouse always makes em go crazy- 

I would recommend before you go bashing ppl like Abstract, Qzen & UFO!
that you at least get your facts straight. these are good people with a
lot of musical talent!!!!

Dear SF Raves Community,

Happy New Years! May 2004 have brought you many fond memories and 2005=20
ring in good blessings for health, happiness, peace, joy and good will=20
towards all.

La Paix!

The Silent Night

At the sound of the bell
in the silent night,
I wake from my dream
in this dreamworld of ours.
Gazing at the reflection
of the moon in a clear pool,
I see, beyond my form,
my real form.
- Kojisei
