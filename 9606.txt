	 LOS ANGELES (Reuter) - Counterculture guru Timothy Leary,  
who urged the 1960s ``Flower Power'' generation to use the 
hallucinogenic drug LSD to ``turn on, tune in and drop out,'' 
died Friday of cancer. He was 75 years old. 
	 In his final days, Leary made elaborate plans to turn his  
own death into a public event, but he never had a chance to go 
through with the ultimate dropout -- committing suicide while 
logged on to the giant computer network known as the Internet. 
	 Instead, early Friday morning, he smiled, whispered ``Why  
not?'' and died at his hilltop Beverly Hills home, succumbing 
after a year-long battle against inoperable prostate cancer, 
according to long-time friend Carol Rosin. 
	 The eccentric former Harvard University psychologist,  
hailed as a hero by the flower children of the 1960s but reviled 
by their parents as a corrupter of youth, died surrounded by 
family and friends. 
	 His home page on the World Wide Web, where he had provided  
regular updates on his deteriorating health and on the cocktails 
of legal and illegal drugs he was taking to dull the pain, 
recounted the moment of his death. 
	 ``Just after midnight, in his favorite bed among loving  
friends, Timothy Leary peacefully passed on. His last words were 
'Why not?' and 'Yeah','' his followers wrote. 
	 ``He went of his own accord,'' Rosin said. ``He was  
smiling.'' 
	 Leary -- who became a vagabond icon of his era for  
celebrating the use of mind-altering drugs, escaping from prison 
and falling in with radical groups -- was diagnosed with cancer 
in 1995. 
	 White-haired and gaunt, he said he was ``thrilled'' to learn  
he was dying. ``Because that's the final party,'' he said in a 
March interview with the TV newsmagazine ``Extra.'' ``I say 
dying is a team sport like living is.'' 
	 His last moments as he lay on his death bed were captured on  
videotape and may be broadcast later on the Internet, Rosin 
said. Leary's remains will be cremated, and for his final trip 
his ashes will be blasted into space in September or October, 
she said. 
	 Arrangements were made with Houston-based Celestis Inc. to  
launch seven grams of Leary's ashes on a small rocket along with 
those of ``Star Trek'' creator Gene Roddenberry and 28 other 
people, a company spokesman said. Within 10 years, the capsule 
containing the ashes will plunge into the earth's atmosphere and 
burn up. 
	 Just as he would have wanted, Leary's death was almost  
immediately a major item on a number of the Web's news sites -- 
just behind the electoral victory of Benjamin Netanyahu in 
Israel -- including the NAndO Times (http://www.nando.net/), CNN 
Interactive (http://www.cnn.com/) and Microsoft Network News 
(http://www.msn.com/news/). 
	 And the man who filled halls in the 1960s with his mantra  
of ``turn on, tune in, drop out'' was himself hosting so large a 
crowd at ``The Timothy Leary Home Page (http://leary.com) just 
hours after his death that accessing the page was for a time 
virtually impossible. 
	 Small wonder, since about 600 other sites on the Web have  
links to Leary's page -- and since the earliest word of his 
death was attributed to his site. 
	 The site sports a small animation of Leary smoking a  
cigarette with ``Leary Home Page'' in the wavy, tie-died, 
psychedelic typeface of his heyday. Visitors can visit ``rooms'' 
in his house and even take a ``guided tour.'' 
	 In a final ``health summary'' at  
http://www.leary.com/health.html, dated May 16, Leary wrote of 
his mental status: ``The good spirits of last month have 
expanded -- probable cause: I treasure the moments of mobility, 
dexterity, friendship, and mental clarity.'' 
	 G. Gordon Liddy, the Watergate figure and ultraconservative  
commentator, went on a nationwide speaking tour with Leary in 
1982. He said he would miss his old debating partner. 
	 ``I never approved of what he did, but I never thought he  
ever meant to hurt anyone. He thought what he was doing was 
right,'' Liddy, who first met Leary during a drug raid on a 
commune in upstate New York in the 1960s, said on his radio 
call-in program in Washington. 
	 Only a handful of subscribers to America Online -- whose age  
demographics probably tilt toward people who were not born when 
Leary was big news -- posted messages in the hours after his 
death, but there was still fire and emotion in some. 
	 ``Timothy Leary was a great man... He was the king of LSD.  
In my opinion he was a god ... Rest in peace Tim, from all your 
children of the underground,'' wrote one member, whose profile 
indicated the writer was 17. 
	 But another anonymous America Online member was more  
succinct in his or her disgust: ``Good riddance to bad 
rubbish!'' 
	 Leary was a hot topic in a number of the Internet message  
boards, known as Usenet, in all the places one would expect: 
rec.drugs.music, alt.drugs, alt.politics.correct, 
talk.politics.drugs, talk.euthansia, rec.drugs.psychedelic. 
	 There was even discussion in some Usenet groups one would  
not expect, like alt.fan.rush.limbaugh, where one poster wrote 
the night before Leary died: ``Dr. Leary is an acid-addled 
crack-pot,'' to which another reponded: 
	 ``When Leary was talking about 'dropping-out' he intended  
for people to abandon the established social structure. That 
doesn't mean he wanted people to sit around tripping their heads 
off all day.'' 
	 Not if they want to be as wired as he was, anyway.  
	 Leary was a respected Harvard University psychology  
professor in the early 1960s when he began experimenting with 
the powerful hallucinogen LSD after eating psychedelic mushrooms 
in Mexico. He was fired when authorities learned he had given 
drugs to students to study their reactions. 
	 Leary joined the counterculture ``in crowd'' of the time,  
including Aldous Huxley, Allen Ginsberg and William Burroughs 
and as the hippie movement spread, his fame grew. 
	 The ``Messiah of LSD,'' as he was called, was to be found at  
love-ins, sit-ins and marijuana smoke-ins, and ``Leary is God'' 
buttons became popular on college campuses. 
	 Leary was further immortalized when the 1970s rock band The  
Moody Blues sang the lyrics ``Timothy Leary's dead.'' After he 
was diagnosed with cancer, the group retooled the words to 
''Timothy Leary lives'' and sang it to him over the phone. 
	 As the 1960s counterculture faded, so did Leary's fame. An  
arrest for possession of two marijuana cigarettes landed Leary 
in a California prison on a 10-year sentence, but he escaped in 
1970 with the help of the radical Weather Underground. 
	 He spent the next few years on the run in Europe and Africa  
with his wife, Rosemary, until he was arrested in Afghanistan in 
1973 by U.S. drug agents. He was sent to Folsom Prison near 
Sacramento, California, and was paroled in 1976. 
	 In the late 1970s, Leary became a fixture on the Hollywood  
party scene. He tried acting and stand-up comedy and even ran 
for governor of California -- all with equal lack of success -- 
and wrote several books about his drug experimentation. 
	 Leary was born in Springfield, Mass., and attended the U.S.  
Military Academy at West Point, N.Y., before joining the army. 
He earned his doctorate in psychology from the University of 
California at Berkeley and in 1959 joined the Harvard faculty. 
	 Leary is survived by his two children, Susan and John, from  
his first marriage, and by his step-son, Zach, from his fourth 
marriage, which ended in divorce in 1994.

	 WASHINGTON (Reuter) - One planned political break-ins, the  
other drug turn-ons. One would not talk and went to prison for 
it; the other talked too much and ended up in jail. 
	 Timothy Leary, the LSD guru who died Friday at age 75 of  
cancer, and G. Gordon Liddy, the Nixon fanatic who went to jail 
for the Watergate break-in, were one of America's odd couples, 
touring together to debate at colleges. 
	 Liddy on Friday paid high tribute to Leary, whose call for  
Americans to ``Turn On, Tune In and Drop Out'' was the sort of 
comment he spent his whole life fighting. 
	 ``I will miss Tim Leary. He had an elfin Irish wit about  
him. I never approved of what he did but I never thought he ever 
meant to hurt anyone. He thought what he was doing was right,'' 
Liddy said on his radio call-in program in Washington. 
	 He recalled meeting Leary in a raid on a commune that Leary  
was living in in upstate New York in the 1960s where Liddy was 
then a prosecutor. He said Leary came down the stairs ``wearing 
only a golf shirt. I got a spectacular first look at him.'' They 
made a deal under which Leary agreed to leave the state in turn 
for no charges on drugs. 
	 ``I liked him from the start,'' Liddy said.  
	 Years later after Liddy got out of prison the odd couple  
toured as debators, mainly on college campuses. They even went 
together to the Cannes Film Festival in France to promote a film 
made about them. 
	 ``We had a great time. Cannes will never be the same,''  
Liddy lamented.

>Is 27 bucks in Santa Cruz.... Have a great day:(

Seriously?????

I know it's at the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium and they always include a
"tax" on their ticket price for raves (usually 2 bucks) so does this mean
the party is 25 bucks plus the 2 dollars for the city/payoff??

Damn-   I really wanted to hear Simply Jeff and Trance from LA and I
wouldn't mind hearing Dan again after that great set at FTT.  But I don't
know if it's worth the drive down and to pay 27 bucks to get
in---especially if I got to work till 12 am....then drive to SC....
aaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!

Maybe I'll check out Wicked again.  I'll be going by my self so if you see
a guy wondering around looking for fun ...come up and say hi..other wise
I'll be up front dancin' my arce off...

__________
Pac a Bowl

This was my first Pac a Bowl.  I always say I'll go but something always
comes up and I can't make it out to the city (usually school).  School's
out so I decided to check it out.  Met a friendly homeless man that kept
calling me the white Dennis Rodman--?-- don't know why, I don't have any
tats...  As we were walking up several people were arguing and pushing and
then a 10 person brawl erupted in front of Park Bowl (around 12 am).  Much
punching - someone had a flash light - blood - people running - people
getting smacked in the face - more blood - yelling - a girl screemed -
Some dude took a swing at me  WHAT THE FUC  Not a good beginning to my
first P-A-B.  Inside there were alot more people than i expected.  Cool.
MARS was up.  Played some pool, Bowled, kicked it, danced some.  Saw alot
of people I know--- Again I met none of you guys.  i guess lately i've been
shy and tend not to met as many new people any more since I know and talk
to so many people already...
well I was cool to hang out on a Thur. night but I hope the next time I go
back there won't be another fight.

Peace->

Wow, I'm so sorry to hear that _another_ fight broke out at packabowl.
That's at least four weeks in a row now.  It seems to be getting rougher
and rougher and I really wonder how much longer they're going to let it
go on....

Reviews of ORACLe / Goa Trance Under The Full Moon ( LONG! )

ORACLe: 
 I'm glad I took the bus, as I would have gotten lost on the sprawling 
campus. I didn't hear any music when I got off at the Crown College stop ,
so I wandered around like an ant sniffing for a honey trail. 

 Finally, some dub/jungle sounds! Located the source at a little courtyard
next to a cafeteria. It was about 9:30PM , and they were still setting
up the lights and some more speakers. The music's tempo got cranked up 
with peppier techno/house beats. 

 I got to meet Madame Mercury and Liquid Seven in person ( but I'm still
foggy on their "real" names! ). She was worried that the crowd was too 
small, but folks began arriving - I suspect a combination of knowing
attendees and those who just heard it on passing. 

 DJs BrianFlip and Dave (?? names again! ??) traded off at the turntables
for some nice music nicely mixed. After getting over my initial shyness
of dancing with young collegiant strangers , I got down to some fun
stepping!

 Then the lights and sound died! Not the campus security - we had tripped
the circuit breaker! The circuit breaker was quickely located , and some
of the motorized lights were turned off, and I think the volume was turned
down a bit.

 The chill/ambient music area was located in a little courtyard nestled
among some dormitory apartments. Dionysus Dreams was making some industrial
& lysergic sounds from Yamaha and Kawaii synths, and a stack of CD players.
Nice segues and mixing of synth sounds with sounds and music from the CDs.
I layed myself on a bench and let myself drift on the sound stream for 
awhile. 

 As I left , I could hear the dance music pumping along , so I guess they
managed to control their power usage OK ( or they tied down the circuit 
breaker! ). Summary - very nice , and the crowd seemed to be enjoying it!
It was nice to meet Madame Mercury and Liquid7 and Matt(?) and Clouds and
Dave(?) in person, and I may eventually get your names right if we meet 
enough times in the future! I missed meeting Adam Guevara and Jessica 
Robin , maybe next time!


Goa Gil Under The Full Moon

 Late Friday afternoon I got rumor of a C.C.C. "goa trance" outdoor event 
at a beach some miles north of Santa Cruz. Not being a big Goa Trance fan
(yet), I didn't make any hard plans on attending it , and left the 
directions at home in any case. While at ORACLe , I got an update on the 
event , plus some rough directions. Taking this as an omen, I commited to at least checking this event out. So, after I got back to my truck, I bought 
myself a liter of water and started driving up HW 1.

 The parking area was pretty much at the mileage described to me; it helped
to see other folks driving into the same area. The actually beach site was 
across the street and about a 1/3 mile from the parking site. A $5 donation 
asked for. I gave it gladly, because , even before I heard any music, I was
charmed by the beauty of the site. A large , flat beach , with few rocks
or boulders and lots of fine sand. A creek flowed across the sand into the 
sea.

 Around the right , out of sight of the road, was where the sound system was
set up. Some folks were building a fire from some palattes and driftwood. 
The fire got started quite nicely with the help of some oil. The warm was
appreciated, even though some folks who had been to a Gateway (?) event at
the same site the week before said that it had been much windier and colder
last week.

 I wandered over to the DJ coffin - no music was happening yet, as they 
were waiting for an amp. It seemed to me that the amp wasn't all they were
missing - no turntables! Hmmm , just a lot of little DAT portable recorders
hooked up to the mixer. Then , a blocky heavyset man in his 30's(?) with
dark brown dreadlocks ambled up and started to checked the DATs out and
choose DAT tapes out of a bag. He was Goa Gil.

 I hadn't heard him do his thing for over a year , and so I was pleasantly
surprised! A "goa trance" evening indeed! 

 Someone I knew named Joe(y?) from Beautiful People showed up , so we and
his friends got our own driftwood and Duraflame(tm) fire started. As we added
wood to the budding flames, the music started up, slow and trancey. Goa Gil
slowly built up the tempo over the course of a 1/2 hour .

 As I said before, I didn't start the night liking goa trance , but if
what I heard last night was typical of the genre, I'm a new fan! Of course,
I did get to hear it under the best possible conditions. A beautiful site,
cooperative weather, and a crowd of folks that were there to get off! So
good to be swimming the sonic ocean with a school of blissed out trancing 
ravers! The vibe was so good, I got into temporary mental altered zones of 
my own without aid of A or E ! At one point,I ran along the waterline , arms outstretched, feeling the cool air flowing around me and under my "wings". 
Another time, I sat myself down near the "coffin" and the video projector
table, just grooving to the music and the ecstatic dancers.

 It had been so long since I had been to a beachside full moon rave. My
first full moon rave was at Bonny Doon, and there's nothing quite like 
a beach rave , especially with lots of silvery fullmoonlight.

 Such a beautiful night! Wonderful music and wonderful people! I left early,
at about 3:15AM, as my energy finally started to run out after a full
Friday workday and evening. Before I left, I stood on a little rise over-
looking the site, watching the fires and the ravers and Goa Gil. I sent
out a little non-denominational blessing over them all.

 How did it end up? I hope it all went well until sunrise and beyond...

Okay, first of all it's 5 am and I just got in, so if this rambles...I'm 
sorry! :)  

I didn't even plan on going to Plastik tonight- 27 bucks is a lot of 
cash- and I had no way of scraping that much together...I mailed that to 
Adam (rlunatic) and he e-mailed me back telling me that he would kick 
down the money so I could get in!!  I'd never met him before, but he told 
me to meet him in line (I found him with his Dr. Seus hat)  And then He 
payed almost half my ticket and I hung out with him and his friends all 
night long!  The kindness of some people never ceases to amaze me..:)

So the party itself was okay- the music was pumping and had me up most of 
the night- a downer was that they took away ALL candy, gum etc. at the 
door- not a great beginning to the evening..the vibe was a kind off too- 
a lot  of hard looks and not as many smiles as I'd expected to see.  
However, my evening was rad because I had a great group of people to hang 
with, and they knew what it was all about!!


Thank you so much ADAM!!!

Good morning!:)

I was wondering if there's anything happening today.  It would be great 
to have some beautiful music to go with all this sunshine and my great 
mood today!  Noticed there's really been nothing on the calendar at all 
this week-end.  Have a gorgemous day!

Plastik?!@*$

(side note:
I have a very strong instinct for things that will happen in the near 
future.  I didn't feel good about Plastik ever since we were in liquid's 
room getting ready.  The closer we got the stronger the negative vibes 
got.  Once downtown the vibes were so strongly negative I was on the 
verge of crying behind my silver glasses.)

 Getting there was no problem for liquid7, lambchop, and I for we were 
right here @ the UCSC campus.  We found parking easily and went and 
joined our other UCSC raver friends in line, whom we had met the night 
before @ Oracle.  However, things were all downhill from there....

 In line you could see #'s of people cutting in line as the "gangsters" 
cruised by in there pimped out Hondas.  Then it was confirmed that the 
ticket price was $25.  I had the sick sense of another Area 51 
(overcrowded ganster = negative party).  Once puchasing our tickets we 
stepped up to find that we couldn't even bring in candy or gum and during 
our being searched we were stripped of everything, all the way down to 
what was left of our good raver vibe.  I sadly watched as the security 
slowly yet vigourously searched the inside of liquid's hat, went through 
every pocket of his backpack throwing out our empty bottles and candy, 
and patting him down even questioning him on the flyers in his coat 
pocket.

 Finally in, I found it to my dismay that they had the odacity to sell 
water @ $1.50 a bottle and candy after throwing out our empty bottles and 
candy.  Once past the black curtains we found a scene that wasn't worth 
all of us paying $25.

 Then we listened and what we heard @ 12:00 was, well the beginning of a 
rave.  So we all sat in the seats awaiting the bad ass beats to begin.  
Once we thought the music had picked up and we were gettin' down on the 
dance floor the music cut to some crappy shit.  Then they just kept 
pulling that kind of shity mixing till around 2:00.  And what was up 
w/ that club and 70's horseshit?  Not to mention who was the dumbass 
who butchered DJ Dan's "song" (Basco).  I was very unhappy...

 So was liquid, especially after some big intimidating guy slammed into 
him and got up in his face asking if he wanted to start to some shit.  
When liquid got back and told me what had happened to him I knew it would 
only get worse and it did.

 The house started to drop, however by that time the greedy bastards of 
the Civic Auditorium had let in way too many people and there was no room 
to let your feet move to the grooves.  Not to mention not being able to 
breathe due to the lack of ventelation.  Then to add to my misery all the 
vibes started to really get to me.  The happy ravers inspired me to smile 
:) and rave my feet off, however this was quickly intercepted by all the 
negative vibes from those just roaming around, starting shit...those just 
not there to rave.  I felt scared and alone and clung to liquid for comfort 
but he was so overwhelmed w/ all the "shit" himself he could hardly 
assist me.  So I went and joined lambchop in the seats as the tears 
rolled down my cheaks from behind my glasses.

 Soon all 3 of us were in the seats asleep waiting for DJ Dan to maybe 
have the power to rejuvinate us from our crash and burn in the pool of 
fucked up vibes.  It was 3:30 by then and I just couldn't handle it, so 
liquid went and finished his role of film in his camera and we went home.

 I have never been so disappointed in a rave.  I will NEVER go to the 
Civic Auditorium in Santa Cruz again and I encourage the rest of you to 
boycott it as well.  I should have listened to 
those of you who said Plastik would be like this and to my strong instincts.
	

 It was even painful remembering it to write about it.

Please realize that the Civic isnt responsible for the people who throw 
events there.  I've been to one of the best raves of my life at the Civic 
a couple of years ago.  Don't boycott the Civic boycott people who throw 
evetns like the one you attended, they can throw them anywhere, so 
boycott them not the venue (unless the venue made you feel unsafe).

love drenalin

It sure is!  At least we are not in a crowded auditorium w/ tones of
other people and we can't move or breathe and feel
threatened....uhhh...please excuse my extra bitterness.

Dear Friends & Family,

	Chikako & I are going up to the Tribal Future site tonight to 
catch the end of the weekend! (I had to work today & yesterday)  
	We have room for two or three more in the car... anybody else 
want a ride from S.F.?  Carpooling is good, Ameba said space was limited 
for cars & they're asking $10 a car for those arriving Sunday.
	We plan to stay all night but leave fairly early in the morning 
(around 7am) as we need to be back in the city by around ten.

Much love,
				<<< Starchild >>>

Hi all!

 Just would like to share a few thoughts; I had a blast at Oracle! My 
ambient/chill area was very much what I had hoped for. Calm, yet trippy 
and interesting. It was never packed and sometimes empty yet those there 
seemed to really enjoy it (excepting the Proctor [of course] and the 
racoons {sorry racoons!}). I had a lot of people who enjoyed the space come 
share some kind words and thoughts :)

 I would really like to thank Madame Mercury and Liquid for hosting this 
event and HUGE THANKS to Garrett without whom this show never would have 
happened!! Also thanks to Chin for saying hello! And thanks to everyone 
who made the effort to come to our party - it made all the work wortwhile!

=)

What did I tell you all... Plastik sucked...

I think someone needs to send Carlos back to DJ school, so they can teach 
him that when he's scratching, he can turn the shit WAY down.  He 
actually had a pretty good set, but his annoying "wobbly" scratching 
fucked it up.  Of course, the fly skimmies sitting next to me were going 
"awww yeah... Carlos is fucking shit up."

By the way, did DJ Dan spin?  I don't think so...  If he did, kudos to 
him for purposely fucking up his set, cuz the people that throw Plastik 
deserved to throw away $700...

someone get me a fake ID, so I can get into Wicked next time...

Not to mention I brought about 1,000 or more flyers for the Underworld, 
Chemical Bros., etc. show and I couldn't bring them inside, since "flyers 
take to long to pick up."  The asshole that searched me made me throw my 
cigarettes away, even though I said, "it only says no smoking."

I'm pretty sure Carlos was spinning at that time... and well... Every 
time I hear him spin it makes me want to leave... it's like acid... it 
just doesn't go away :)

Another drug analogy... waiting for Dan to come on was like waiting for 
that bunk hit of E to come on... (luckily I had some good E at the party 
and was able to have a fun time anyways..)

Once again we found ourselves asking "Okay, is there anyway we could
possibly make this rave any better?"

Tribal Future was really incredible.  The location was heavenly.  The
camp was integrated extremely well with the forest.  Although there were
very few structures besides the little kitchen, the whole site was
very comfortable with cut grass areas shaded by trees, the hot tubs,
real toilets in little huts, ect.  At night all I could compare the
scene to was the end of Return of the Jedi when everybody was partying
with the Ewoks in their forrest village.  Lots of lights made the
night scene magical and enchanted.

The soundsystem echoed throughout the valley.  Sometimes it seemed the
whole forest was resonating with the music.

When it got really hot in the day we took off to the river, where you
could jump off the bridge, swing on the rope, or just wade around.  

During the night we went from one crazy adventure to another.  The organic
garndens were wonderful with ponds, fountians, swinging chairs, ect.  I
found it amazing that up there in the forrest, with lots and lots of bugs,
they are able to grow wonderful plants without insecticides.  Hmmmmm....

Ameba provided some food, fruit and blueberry pancakes in the morning.
yum!  I did not feel like I was "roughing it" out in the woods... the
camping area was just so nice.  I felt spoiled.

All and all, one of the funnest weekends we have had in a long time, thanks
Ameba!

THANK YOU AMEBAS !!!  THANK YOU UNCLE WALTER for having us.
THANK YOU ALL THE INCREDIBLE DJs who played for us.
THANK YOU to all the WONDERFUL PEOPLE who showed up.

To quote my buddy Wayne, this isn't a rave, its camping with DJs. This was
so perfect, it really was you and 400+ of your CLOSEST friends out in
nature for a few days, with the bonus of non-stop incredible music. We all
got to spend that "quality" time together, days and days of it, walking
through the garden, hiking in the hills, laying in the hot tubs, lounging
on the lawn, swimming etc, etc... Then we got to dance together all night
long. Only to wake up to another day in paradise.

I don't think you could have found a single negative vibe in the whole
event. You won't be reading about cars being broken into, or any of that
downer stuff from Tribal Future.

So to sum things up, I had a terrible time, and would never go to another
TF again.    Yeah right, how bout next weekend !!!!!!!!!!!!!!

	I didn't have a _good_ time.
	I didn't _enjoy_ the camp.
	People were not _friendly_.
	...
	It was definitely more than that.

	Wooooaaaaooooaaaoooooooaaaaaaaah!!!! (extatic)
	Tribal Future wasn't _fun_, it was pure _joy_ and _pleasure_
	from the beginning to the end, every minute of it!!!

	I don't even know how to describe this event, words are not enough
	to translate my feelings about it... I'll skip the usual "we arrived
	at Xpm, then did this and that" to give only quick flashbacks of
	my best moments... More intense ;)

GOOD MOMENTS
	Finally finding the camp at midnight on Friday, and discovering
	its beauty on Saturday afternoon!

	Hanging around, chatting everywhere and with everybody during the
	hot day we enjoyed.

	The very beginning of the night, people getting out their tents
	and gathering on the dancefloor.

	A red ball (soccer ball? rugby ball?) thrown in the night over
	the crowd, drawing big red curves in the dark.

	Branka dancing with glowsticks--far better than me ;)

	Hanging around with Erik and friends.

	Washing my poor dusty feet in the morning.

BEST MOMENTS
	Watching the amazing Sarah playing with fire balls. Waaaa!

	Dancing madly with a knife under the moon near the tent, 
	cutting and throwing moonlight everywhere in the night. Yaaaa!
	Thankfully nobody was around :)

	In the morning, the moon going down, the sun rising, and the music
	did *not* stop!!! Yiipeeee!

BAD MOMENT
	Getting lost in a small creek by chasing a rabbit and followed
	by a bunch of drunk assholes (while trying to find our way to the 
	camp).

WORST MOMENT
	When leaving the camp on Sunday afternoon, while knowing that some
	lucky people would enjoy another night of dancing under the
	full moon!


	Summary: it was definitely another level of raving. :)

	THANKS to all the people for just being there, Erik, Leslie,
	Sarah, Kirsten, John, Rok, Kirsti, Brendan, Branka and her friends, 
	Tim & Tim, Mike, Phred, Ms Phink, Vince, everybody...
	AND SPECIAL THANKS TO ALL THE PEOPLE WHO SET THIS UP, Ameba,
	the DJs, ... !!!

	My last line, quoting Mike: "Check this out guys, it's worth it"!

	Extatic,
Renaud

There were lots of people were still there yesterday afternoon when 
we left to come back for Monday AM work commitments... lucky people!

We got back last night, and I am still recovering.  What a WONDERFUL 
weekend!  The land was perfectly suited to this kind of party-- well 
spaced out, a mix between wild places and sculpted gardens, 
solar-generated power supply with generator backup...  what a perfect 
(re)introduction to the bay area scene!  I wish I had been sure about 
attending in advance, so I could have arranged some recognition thing to 
meet some more sfraves folks FTF!  I know tons of people from this list 
were there, but I didn't meet anyone in person!     =(

But all the people were fabulous!  I saw nothing but smiles and heard 
nothing but laughter and screams of delight.  Lots of ravers and 
hippie-types dancing with incense, a great mix of ages- from elders to 
little children playing nicely.  Weather=perfect.  The dancefloor was a 
massive outdoor vibe-generator, with crisp sound (not too loud, but loud 
enough to permeate the surrounding areas nicely), and an excellent mix of 
DJs.  I liked the housey stuff better (my pref), but the tweek sessions 
went ON and ON and ON... I though I would burst from the flow of energy 
coming from the dance circle!  The main dance area was in a very special 
clearing, with a perfect view of the moonrise.  The camping was in 
clusters among the meadows which dotted the forest areas and rolling hills.

The owner(s) of that property have a very magical place indeed, and have 
done beautiful things with it.  Thanks to the promoters and the 
landowners for such a wonderfully organized and executed event!   Special 
love to that wild gypsy-woman whose real name I did not get, but I hope 
she is online!    =)    Now I have to re-boot into workmode, and try not 
to bliss-out too much  that it keeps me from getting anything done.

Having gone to the January Plastik that was also at the SC Civic and
having such a great time at that one, I am sorry to hear that this
one was so bad.  I walked by it and found out that DJ Dan and some
others had cancelled, and also felt a certain akward negativity with
all the people in the line, so I decided not to go in.  
I'm not sure if I'm getting older, or ravers are getting younger, but 
on this night in particular I was feeling especially old.
I really don't think 24 is all that old.

Instead I went for a midnight hike in the woods, and stumbled upon
a drum circle of about 50 people.  With the full moon and a beautiful
sky and warm winds, I had a terrific time.

And I'm sure it's not the SC Civic that spoiled the party... although I
have been to several really bad parties there, I've also been to 
several really good ones.  and I don't really even think that it's the age 
of the crowd either... sometimes people are in a mood to get along,
and sometimes they are more in a mood to sneer and grumble...
The best you can do is keep your chin up and continue looking for the
good in it all, which is always just around the corner.

regards,
-john.

I whole heartedly agree!!! There have been some pretty killer parties 
at the civic. I understand that some of their (S.C.C.C.) tactics are 
rather low, but I still find some reason to have a place in my heart 
for that space. 

Peace,

Greg :)

Amazing, lovely, incredible!  The location was absolutely breathtaking:
nice smallish area after walking through a narrow path through the trees.
Lush greenery all around, ferns everywhere, wounds of water coursing
through the stream just off the path, and the glorious full moon, brigher
than I've seen in a long time, radiating it's energy upon us to add to
ours.
Trance-a -thon!  I loved the beautiful, trippy music, and sat/lay down only
when I got tired or when the music got too hard for my taste.  There must
have been some faves playing at times, judging by the crowd's enthusiastic
response when certain tracks were spun.  People were digging it, whether
bobbing up and down or going off wildly or somewhere in between.  The sound
system was great, but I think there could have been a little more low end
:)
Wonderful moments: rendezvousing before the party at Jess's place, and
meeting some new and recently-met friends there (hi y'all!).  Finding
friends at the party, as I didn't know who I'd see there.  Sharing an
AWESOME hug with Diana Greer, who considers herself weak or poor at hugging
(don't believe it, folks!); I just wish I'd been able to stay longer.
Being asked if I had a pipe that could be borrowed, and partaking of the
borrowers' gratitude ;)  Resting with eyes closed, being suspended between
sleep and wakefullness, and feeling someone lie next to me and put an arm
around me (I responded in kind), and sharing warm feelings with the person,
thinking it might be one of the guys who rode up with us, then opening my
eyes to find that it was Jess!  It's always a treat to open your eyes and
find someone so lovely right before you :D
The best part of all was when (who was spinning, please?) I heard part of
the keyboard intro to "In the Light" by Led Zeppelin mixed into the music.
I thought I was gonna leave my body when I heard that!  It was so heavenly,
it made tears well up in my eyes and my heart leaped for joy :)  THAT
moment was pure ecstasy (aaaaahhhhh!).  Whoever gave us that gift on the
turntables is ultra-cool; please give us more!
Unfortunately, Thomas (who drove us up) wanted to leave before the end, but
I suspect that it lasted only about another half-hour after we left, as the
sky lighened to reveal the true beauty of our environment.  What a killer
place that is!  I hope more parties will take place there.
BIG THANKS to the F-8 crew for a splendid experience.  Looked like they had
things well in hand on all aspects of the party.  Also looked like people
were respecting the space by keeping down the litter--way to go, everyone!
It was another party with no EnhancEmEnt, but the vibe (especially on the
dance "floor") was more than enough to sustain me and bring me into an
awareness that I'm just starting to get into.

Still feeling the love, intensifying as we share it,

- E

As far as I know, he didn't show up (good for him).  If anyone got tapes, 
I didn't see them...  That party definitely wasn't worth even $20...  I 
don't think I'll ever go to a Plastik again... I just really had nothing 
better to do and couldn't get into Wicked.. :)

I *don't* know too much about who throws Plastik anymore, but Daniel (who 
used to be a part of it) told me that the investors took over the party 
awhile back.

:) what a weekend!!

	the frequency-8 party was the smack, thanks to all those who put 
it on, thanks to jess for getting us tickets, thanks to all the cool 
people who went that made it great.

	it was in the same place as the other F8 party I went to last summer, 
but still a cool spot. we crashed out on the side of the trail for a 
long while, we were ultra-tired from a party we wnet to at stanford.. did 
any other sfraves people go? it was free... turntablists qbert, shortkut, 
apollo, etc etc were there. totally different for the 'rave' thing, but 
entirely great nonetheless, on the stanford campus with many many students. 

it was cool meeting all of you, even though i was totally dead saturday 
night :) we left the F8 party about 4:30 to watch the moon shimmer off 
the ocean, and to see the sun come up over the hills.

F8 was a beautiful and magical party.

After playing ticket master at my house to a host of SFRavers, a bunch of
us made our way towards Stinson beach under a giant silvery moon that
reflected off the ocean in the most enticing way.  I knew it was going to
be a great party and I was in a serious mood to dance like a wild woman.

After parking our car and being shuttled to the trail head (more like a
hole in the bushes) we wound around a path until we heard hints of music
and then came upon this intimate clearing, trees lit from below with
colored lights and ravers already wiggling to the hypnotic goa beats.  


I came prepared for cold weather and ended up stripping down to my long
johns and borrowing a T-shirt because within a few minutes, I was dripping
with sweat.  Ivo started the party off with an absolutely awe-inspiring
Goa set that had me wacked out and flying, my feet barely touching the
ground for hours.  

After Ivo came Mystr-E who played a really solid and eclectic hard-trance
set - very cool - it was really full of surprises and quirks and the
energy was good - fast, energetic and open

Mars had an amazing beginning but there was a power problem for about 15
which sort of killed the vibe (musically) and it took him a long while to
get going again.


Cool moment:  Check it out guys -  I met my match dancing :)
I had been dancing
really intensely for a while when I looked over and this amazing woman was
dancing near me - and she danced just like me - with the same energy and
similar style - and we just hooked into each other - playing off one
another - feeding each other with energy - and I kept laughing and
laughing because it was so damn good.  

Cool moment: This guy showed up with a suit covered in lights (maybe
you've seen him) and these hand-held flashing like thingys that he danced
with - just beautful.

Cool moment(s):  I kept thinking about all our friends at TF and I felt so
enveloped in our connection - I really knew we were all together even
though we were separated in space - 


I think one of the reasons this party was so special was that the location
and the decorations and lights that F8 had done made the place look like
some sort of fairy circle or secret witches coven ritual.  That, plus the
incredible trance made this a really enchanted evening.

Thanks to everyone on the net who suggested I attend Frequency-8 on
Saturday. To say I wasn't disappointed is a gross understatement...

Environment: fabulous! The weather was perfect -- calm air, clear
skies, and a very bright, full moon, gave the mountains and ocean an
eerie glow. The hike to the location was very magical and trippy, with
the eerie lime-green glow sticks guiding the way, the babbling brook
to the side, and the lush flora encroaching on the trail. The
tree-canopied location where the party was, smack against a cliff, was
wonderful (save the nettles on the side -- ouch!).

Music: totally chakra-stimulating! I started off getting down to the
trance, guided by Myster-E. Then, just as the sun was beginning to
influence the sky again, I got my second wind, and fell into the
influence of the beat yet again. [Who was the last dj spinning that
morning?]

Vibe: warm and loving. Although I arrived by myself, with a friend
arriving from SJ later in the night, I didn't feel at all alone. Most
everybody was sharing smiles and treats. I met a couple of
first-timers from SF, and several other folks from Sac'to. I also got
to meet Jess, Austin, and MARS (who, it turns out, was the one who sold
me the tix at the store). I was surprised at the small ratio of
dancers to chillers, but I didn't mind -- there was plenty of energy
in the cozy dance space to go 'round.

Strange moment of the evening: when I arrived in the parking lot, this
young, rather large woman was giving our lot guide, Jay (?) a hard
time about getting in. It was clear that she was eminating a
polarized, negative vibe -- for instance, she asked if there was going
to be a lot of booze there. As I walk up to Jay to introduce myself,
she claims I don't have a ticket (which, in fact, I did), and called
him Jay a liar. She then proceeded to harass everyone else in the lot,
alternating her conversation between wanting to get in, "Because I my
friend said it was going to be good," and dissing the scene. Finally,
she left with her posse, headed back towards the Golden Gate. We all
breathed a sigh of relief...

All in all, it was a fabulous first time at a F-8 event. I headed back
to the city feeling totally connected with the universe, and shared a
big smile with the GG troll...

well... i think i've heard carlos do the scratchy thing before and i just

As reported, TF was more than a rave, it was a timeless gathering that
captured the essence of what being truly human might be: in harmony
with our true nature(s) and with the nature that surrounds us. 
Past, Present and Future met at the center as the Sun, Moon and Stars
circled around us and and danced to the rhythms of interchanging
Matter, Energy, Space and Consciousness.   Or something like that. ;)

Assorted commentary:

I enjoyed the semi-chaotic nature of the DJ lineup.  Many DJ's I spoke
to weren't sure if or when they would be spinning, they just showed up
with records and hoped for the best.  Kudos to Mark (Ameba) for the
DJ time slot juggling act; the musical order that emerged from the
chaos was fantastic and the sound system was excellent.  There was even
a separate ambient system setup, but I only found the time to pay it a
short visit.

Someone already mentioned the glowstick dancers.  If any of you are on
this list, thanx for the mesmerizing moves.  That red glowing football
thingie being tossed around was also pretty cool.

I socialized a bit, but mostly danced or blissed out or scrounged
around for food when we realized that we didn't want to eat the crap
we brought with us.  Fortunately, everyone was into sharing, and loads
of fresh fruit was put out all over the place.

The DJs were great.  Even when people weren't dancing everyone was
grooving to the nonstop tunes that permeated the camp.  2 sets
stood out from the pack for me: Fred Huette's, who really got the 
dancers going late saturday afternoon (Excellent set, Fred!) and Tony
who just amazed me and everyone around me with a perfect blend of
acid-tinged techno.  It's been a while since I tranced out to an
entire set like that.  The only glitch was the generater dying during 
the middle of his set as if to say, "Hold on Tony, there's not enough 
power on earth to feed the energy you're creating here!"  

Some of the Sunday daytime sets were also quite juicy - especially that
scratchy hip-hopish sample-heavy stuff that's been getting more popular 
in "chill" rooms lately.  I think we can thank DJs Corbin and Everett
for that.  And some tasty Jungle was also spun.  Ethan's 
unanticipated evening set was also a nice suprise.  A lot of people
prefer to hear trance in a hot sweaty warehouse, but I always find 
those sounds more enjoyable reverberating through the wind and trees.

It was almost too hot to dance during midday, but then this hose with
a spray nozzle was introduced, and a bunch of us had a lot of fun dancing
under a communal shower.

I didn't do the mud bath thing, but appreciated experiencing it
vicariously when Tomcat and Monicat visited the dance area in a
muddified state of being.

We hung out with some friends at their tent near the sweat lodge, were
some guys labored over these big rocks that had to be fired to generate
more heat.  This was in the morning, I felt like telling them "hey
dudes, in a couple of hours it's gonna be plenty hot anyway..." but I
think they enjoyed just having something to keep busy with.         

We've never been camping before, so we couldn't figure out how to do
certain things, like when to sleep.  So we didn't.  Well, Janie managed
an hour nap on a bale of hay somewhere since the inside of our tent
became such a disgusting mess.  We purchased our tent (only $29.99!) 
just for this occasion.  Very easy to set up but we spent a lot of
energy unjamming the zippers every time we wanted to get
something in or out of it.  When it was time to leave, stuffing it
back into the little bag that it came in was of course impossible.

Unfortunately, we couldn't stay for Sunday evening.  Did the Wicked boys
make it for some Full Moon madness?  I still haven't completely gotten
over Garth's 3 hour set from last October's Tribal Future at this
same amazing location.

Anyway, thanks to the Ameba clan and their helpers for everything they 
put into this event.  They are one more group who have been in this
scene long enough to become cynical about it but instead have remained
true to the ideals that have made raving on the SF Bay area so
special.  Glad to hear that F8 went off with a similar spirit.
Love to everyone who shared the vibe, once again.

Lee

Hello alll-

Yeah I said I was going to go check out Wicked but a couple of friends who
REALLY wanted to check out P paid me to drive them down after work and even
chiped in for the $25 dollar tix price...

Got to the civic at 1.45am and waiting at the door I could feel the hot air
escaping the civic not to mention all the negativity.  A bunch of my
friends got there early and got free tapes...Simply Jeff mixed tapes... I
loved his set at the last Plastik and He was spinning when I got there till
probably 3.  Very nice break...  I was feeling sick from something I ate so
for the first hour or 2 I wasn't into the music.  I brought a GlowButton of
a Simile Face and lots of people liked it - TOO much that several people
tried to steel it from me, one girl walked up and riped it off my shirt to
show her boy friend(What the fuk).  No smiles, mean faces, people startin
shit.  Some of my friends got kicked out for smokin a cigerette.  Dan,
Donald Glaude, and Ghost never spun.  I know Trance started things off and
they started late 10.30 or 11 (they let people in before the music had
started).  I heard Carlos's set was short, then Simply Jeff and Mark Farina
were next.  I don't know if some one came on after M.F. but J-J closed
things out with some great dancable tunes.  The only thing that kept me
happy was the music.  I spent alot of time by my self dancing because I
couldn't leave - The people I came with were kicked out and I didn't even
know.  I spent the last 3 hours of the night trying to find my friends so I
could leave... I guess Garth, J Howard, and Hipp-e didn't show up either.
No decorations, no murals, just lasers and a video screen.
This whole party made me not want to rave any more, I felt so terrable that
I just wanted to go home and not go to any more parties.

How was Wicked? (anyone)

I think I'm gonna take a break from parties...Maybe I'll go to sunset...
Only I really would like to hear Doc Martin and Doran spin at Basics next
weekend...I'll see how I feel come Sat.

Hope everyone had a great TF weekend

See 'round

It's *okay* but he can't touch someone like Dan or Terry Mullan... he 
needs to turn the scratching WAY DOWN...

This was my last big/weekend party before I go home to Croatia for 3 
weeks and it was probably the best one that could have happened.

Although I was there from Fri night through Sunday afternoon I feel like 
I spend at least a week at that beautiful spot.  Friday night was pretty 
mellow, but it gave us a chance to set up the camp, meet people who were 
already there, try out the hot tubs and dance a little.  

Saturday seemed like it lasted forever (which was great).  More and more 
friends kept showing up and by the end of the afternoon the place was 
packed with tents and smily faces.  The music kept playing all day and 
few of us kept dancing throughout the day and into the night.  I had to 
take a quick break and take a nap around 11pm (I was getting so tired and 
zooning at  he empty space that people were wondering what's wrong with 
me), but Melissa and my roommate made sure I was up at 1:30am, because I 
was not supposed to miss another minute of the wonderful party.

The dance floor was absolutely jamming at that time.  Erik was dancing 
with a huge grin on his face and it was great to see him that way (he 
wasn't that happy at FTT).  I had glow-sticks and was loving every minute 
of dancing.  I lend them to Renaud for a little while (and BTW he was 
wasn't any worse than me), but in few minutes I felt naked without them, 
so I had to steal them away from him :).   I danced for some of Tony's 
set, but had to give up and find my tent.

Sunday was relaxing and I was way too sad when I had to leave, but there 
were just way too many things to take care of before I go to my trip 
(I'll miss you guys when I am gone).  

Thanks to everybody who made this event so beautiful - Amebas, DJs, 
landowner, people who were there.  Big hugs to all my friends that helped 
making this event even more special to me - Leslie and Sara whom I spend 
a lot of time with just having a nice girl-chat :); Kirsten and John who 
ended up getting lost on the way there and going through few streams 
because they were following a car that just passed there (that was my 
friends and me); Renaud who was smiling this weekend and resisting taking 
his shirt of for some reason till I convinced him he was silly; Erik who 
was spreading such a wonderful energy around; Stephan & Lydia, Stacy & 
Gerrard and the rest of the gang who is not on the SFRaves; Shawna whom I 
didn't really see that much, but I knew she was there; Tim who was happy 
(yeah, his truck is back); some of my friends from work who have never 
been to a rave before and who loved it; Alan who was spraying the dance 
floor with the water Sunday and gave some of us
nice, cold shower; Brendon and his friends who fed me cookies on Sunday; 
Troy and Nicole whom I finally met and all other beutiful people I didn't 
mention.

I wish more of my friends were there because it is impossible to 
describe the beauty created at that place.  I could keep writing about 
this (I can't stop thinking about it) but this is getting too long, I 
am at work and I am sure you guys are bored with my babbling.

Love you all,
Branka

P.S.  Hope to see some of you at Come Unity (I am leaving Thursday 
morning for Croatia). 

P.P.S.  Sorry this is so long, I couldn't help it

Hi, I went to Wicked.  Garth went to Detroit.
And back.  And back again.  Someone named Mary was in the
men's room.  She liked hairspray.  I danced.

2 guys in a muscle car outside Wicked asked me what 
the place was.  I said dancing, house.  Then they asked me
where to go dancing.  I was left speechless by the stupidity
of the question.  They yelled something about fleece sweatpants
and roared away.

I'm really sorry you had such a horrible night @ Plastik...but I hear you 
loud and clear.  It sucked, hardcore.  I hope you got home safely.  You 
must remember though that it was just one bad rave out of many and you 
shouldn't let it discourage you.  Just think, summer is right around the 
corner and will start to kick ass even more than have been :).
Don't give up **

[ to sfraves list ]

 Well - if we subtract the bad experiences folks had at Plastik , it seemed
to have been a very fine weekend for many folks! Maybe F8/Tribal Future/
Wicked/and the C.C.C. Goa Gil thing "sucked up" all the available good
vibes , leaving Plastik with "the shit", so to speak. 

 To Madame Mercury and others who felt abused by the Plastik experience - don't
read the perky posts about Tribal Future or the other "good vibe" events 
that happened this weekend with too much envy. Just think of them as portents
of great raves to come! There will be a rejuvinating magic event in your
future!

Hey all!  Finally recovered enough of my previously lost sensibilities to
actually get around to my Tribal Future Review! :)  I was writing a friend
about it, and after I finished describing it in that email, I realized that
I probably wouldn't be able to do as good a job describing it if I had to do
it over again, so I just copied that paragraph here (with a few edits!).
Yeah, there are a cuppla drug references, but that part was so integrated
int the whole experience that it deserves as much mention as the rest of it.
Anyway, read on if you dare!


Ladies & Gentlemen of the Jury, I have never danced so much at any one rave
as I did at Tribal Future.  I started at about 10 pm, and with occasional
breaks, danced pretty hard till about 10 am the next morning!  Boy does acid
give you energy!  God what an amazing night.  (I only took 1/2 hit of acid,
but I swear that trip was way stronger than the last one I took that was a
whole hit.)  It just so completely blew me away, I've never actually
listened to rave music (especially with a real good sound system at an
actual rave) or danced on acid before.  What an amazing experience!  There
wasn't a lot of light, just lots of strands of white christmas lights strung
up throughout the trees all around the dance circle, with the full moon
blazing so brightly above that I felt like I needed sunglasses!  It was so
mystical & beautiful to look at and be a part of.  So I'm frying pretty hard
here, and I'm buried in this wilderness of dark moving shapes and waving
limbs flowing everywhere with glow-sticks and flashing lights (which make
sparkly glowing trails that resemble brightly lit comets two feet above my
head!), all randomly and separately, yet all in complete unison with the
booming beats coming out of all four speakers, which are set up in the "4
corners" setup around the edges of the grassy dance circle.  The music is
just perfect!  Great loud deep bass beats, not too loud so it hurts your
ears, but just right, all flowing in & out of my moving limbs and my own
mind.  The woods and hills and crickets and creatures are all around, you
can hear them in the trees.  Crickets always seem to have this amazing
ability (and other people have mentioned this too) to chirp in time to the
music, what a perfect combination of nature and technology!  It was sooooo
beautiful!  And I must make mention, Galen's set really just blew me away.
I've really got to start paying more attention to him, I really disliked his
stuff when I first heard him, cuz the first time i heard him he  1) played
music I really didn't like and  2) did a really bad job at it cuz he was
having a bad night.  Then I'd hear him at Sunsets, and I didn't like the
kind of stuff he played there either.  But then I heard him at the 420
party, and I really dug on it.  Now this time around, I think I heard one of
the most perfect sets I've heard yet, it was so perfect in conjunction with
everything I just described. I can't believe how well it went along with my
trip, it just added *immensely* to it, blended amazingly with it.  It really
hit that musical "resonant frequency" in me.  Boy, I really just can't
explain well enough what I experienced then, but I know you understand how
sometimes words in the english language just aren't enough to describe some
experiences.  For a while after that, later on in the night, the acid trip
got too intense and I experienced sensory overload (all too easy with all
this going on!), so I just wandered around the woods on the paths with my
friend Sam who kept me company, and that was really cool too, hangin in the
woods under the moon, and then after I came down a bit and was ready to deal
with the sensory overload of the party below, I came out again and danced
some more.  And after I was completely off the acid (it was such a long
trip, I'm so used to the shortness of e!  This lasted from 10:30pm till a
bit after dawn), I just felt so happy and infused with energy, I just
couldn't stop dancing!  It was so great to see everybody, altho I didn't
meet as many people as I usually do, cuz i wasn't as social on acid as I am
on e, and when the acid first started hitting it actually felt like a real
intense e experience coming on!  Got to get in some good quality hang-out
time with Wayne & Marcy & co. in the back of this big U-Haul trailer which
they had turned into this nifty little chill-zone with blankets & pillows
and candles everywhere.  That was a really nifty way to start the trip!  But
then I had to bounce up & run around & check everything out.  Wow! :)  I
sure hope they do it again sometime soon.  And it was particularly nice
because nothing shut down just because the sun came out.  The music kept
going, people kept dancing, and the whole party just kept going on, altho in
a more mellow way as the day progressed, and nobody had to worry about
leaving or driving anywhere.  It was really amazing.  I pretty much enjoyed
the music the whole time it was going on, even to the housier stuff they
played later in the morning, to the jungly stuff they played after that.
Just seemed like whatever was being played fit in perfectly with whatever
was going on at the time.  And it was totally random a lot of the time too,
which made it even better, cuz the dj lineup was never really set.  Dj's
just kinda showed up with their records, & it seems that everybody got a
turn, in addition to dj's that were scheduled to go. Ethan played a nifty
techno set, which everybody really dug on and that really got the nighttime
party going, followed by Galen (whose nighttime sets I will probably now
always have this bizarre emotional attachment too), and I lost track after
that, but it was all *great*!!  I had so much fun dancing, it was so
different on acid. Like Melanie (who gets my vote for Cutest Little Raver in
her little lime-green gingham 50's bathing suit!) said about dancing on
acid, I'll probably never dance the same again! :)  At about 10:30am, I
finally got to sleep for about 1 1/2 to 2 hours or so, lying in the grass in
the gardens under the trees with the sun overhead.  This was, of course,
after the blueberry pancake breakfast they served us!  We had brought a
bunch of fresh picked fruit too, which people seemed to enjoy.  It was so
cool to see this, there were tents everywhere in the areas surrounding the
main dance, kitchen, & garden areas.  It seemed like such a community, not
at all like a massive party, altho there were 400 people there (which seems
like a lot for a small outdoor dance area, so I would normally consider 400
people at an outdoor party pretty large).  You only got people there who
were willing to camp out for 1-2 nights, only people who were willing to
drive 3-plus hours (part of that over dirt roads) to get there, only people
who were willing to share everything with each other (water, food, living
space, etc).  It was really a diverse beautiful group of people, and because
it was so spread out, you never felt crowded like you can in a confined
space like a warehouse.  O
h yeah, *big* props to the Amebas who (in addition to having this shindig in
the first place of course) were kind enough to give me two more tickets
outright after I realized that my two original tickets were gone from my
purse after it had been stolen!  When I explained the situation to Allen, he
didn't even question me, but simply said "Oh yeah, no problem, here's two
more!"  Wow!  That totally made my weekend, you guys can't imagine my
disappointment when I finally realized on Thursday night that there really
was more missing from my purse than just my credit cards! :(  Those idiots
took my book of stamps and my Tribal Future tickets! (maybe the thieves were
at the party, eh?)

Anyway, I am so glad to have shared this experience with those of you who
went, and I hope to share another of these experiences in the future with
those of you who didn't!  I hope all of you had your respective good times
too, at the parties you did make it to.


Love,
Shawna

Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com

Welp, it's about that time!  I start school in Berkely (CCAC) in the fall.  I
think I'm leaving here July 1st, but I might have to couch surf for the
summer, as I need to start building clients in the bay area. (<-not a blatant
advertisement for my graphic design services which are avaiable by calling
916 855 6762)  Anyway, I'm searching for the ideal living quarters.  Either
for a roommate or for a room in a current space.  Communal living in a house
would be optimum.  I'm very into making home, well, home.  My price range is
the tough one, since I'll be schooling full time I have to try to stay as low
as possible, like under 350/mo, preferebly less.  Regarding area:  I have a
car, and will get a motorcycle, my school is on the berkely/oakland border.
 I would like to live close to the school, but would consider living in SF if
I found the right place.  Thanks for listening,
Love,
Steveo

Very nice!  A solid 8 smileys!
However, where were all the sfravers?  I met Jess, the wonderful woman who
procured our tickets (Big Thanks).  She claimed to have met her dancing
match, I find this hard to believe, that girl goes off! I also ran into
Doran, what a swell guy, Pure and real. (He said that he sometimes posts
under someone else's name on the list, but I forgot it, anyone know?)
Other than that, I couldn't find a laminate anywhere!  Oh well, has a great
time, the goa was a refreshing experience.  Would have been nice to see more
of the moon, but the giant majestic rock crag made up for it, along with the
excellent vibe.  After a long week I ended up retiring to my tent with the
dream I had came with, a bit too early.  We woke from a goa filled slumber at
1:30(PM)! to find all the happy people had long abandoned our mecca by the
creek taking just about every waterbottle, candy wrapper and cigarette butt
with them.  Good work team! Thanks F-8! (P.S. someone left their blanket, I
packed it out, but it stunk, :=o so I tossed it)

Hi all!

	I'm happy for everyone who had a great time at Tribal Futures... 
Chikako and I tried to go, but thanks to me forgetting to bring the flier 
with the map on it, we ended up driving over 3 hours each way plus at 
least another three tooling around the Mendocino-Fort Bragg area looking 
for the party with no success (of course because it wasn't there, it was 
in Willits).  I'd heard someone say Mendocino, and I thought it would be 
simple enough to just go up there and find it, small town, right, no need 
to go back for the map.
	We kept pulling off the road to turn off the motor and listen in 
the quiet night air for the distant thump of bass, but no such luck.  We 
pulled over cars and intercepted locals on the street who had the 
appearance of one who might indulge in raves.  Nada.
	Needless to say, we were bummed.  Got no sleep, and no party, 
just driving around and burning petrol.  
	When's the next outdoor rave-festival?

Much love,
				<<< Starchild >>>

Hi all!

	Despite our Tribal Future disaster, Chikako and I are in good 
spirits because we are leaving tomorrow to drive across the U.S., 
something I've long wanted to do.
	I also wanted to post something to the list earlier asking people 
if they knew anyone along our route (Las Vegas, Grand Canyon, New Mexico, 
Oklahoma City, Little Rock Arkansas, Memphis, etc.) who we could hook up 
with to find a local party or something, but one thing and another, I 
didn't get around to it, so I figure better late than never.
	Got any fun-loving friends wanting to get their kicks along the 
old Route 66, give me a shout.  8)  (415) 626-3036 or 270-7887.
	I'm especially interested in people or stuff to do in or around 
the capitol, since we'll be there for a number of days.

Mucho gracias,

P.S. - Are there any special vaccinations you need to get before

Great description. It happened in my school, too, but in seventh grade and
it was me who introduced everyone to it (via my "druggie" cousin). in just
one moring we had three kids pass out (we weren't doing it with the
assistance of someone holding you up - just hyperventilate while squatting
then stand up quickly with a big breath). They were sent to the school
nurse who diagnosed them all as "not having eaten breakfast" or some such
nonsense.

Postscript - I tried this again recently during a dry period here in Texas
and it was scary with a capital "S". Blackout, convulsions, hit my head on
the counter. Not a whole lot of fun. You have been warned.

My understanding of Goa is that in the actual city of Goa itself, the DJ's
(TJ's?) play music on tapes because it is so hot there that the vinyl
records become soft and pliable. So this sounds like a TRUE Goa event!

 After attending their great Goa Trance thing on the beach last Friday,
I was wondering if anyone here on SFRaves knows if they have a voicemail
number? I would certainly be interested in attending more of their 
events, especially if the events are in the Santa Cruz/San Mateo area
again.

Well, let's see . . .
Burning Man is three months away
I know for certain that a lot of us are planning to go . . .
To the best of my knowledge this year's theme is "A Season in Hell"
so, . . .
I would like to help organize a mega theme camp called "Disco Inferno"
the idea would be to rent and transport a mongo sound system and have it
set up by Thurs afternoon
Various cooperatives could take over the system for blocks of time
and particular parties, or, individual DJs could also block out periods
of time
In my ultra dream Friends and Family, F8, Gateway, Pacific, Ultraviolet,
CCC, Spaz, Organic and others who i have admired over the years would
be involved along with such newcomers as The River and St. John's
Some of my old friends from this list have already heard some of my
fanciful ideas

First meeting will be tonite at 7:00 in San Rafael
call 415-868-0450 for more info, or email me privately

Jim Cyr (surfpunk@well.com)

PS - I'm not REALLY attached to the "Disco Inferno" name, but . . .

according to the space children phone #, 415-273-1622, there were severe
reservations by most of the artists about playing back-to-back nights in SF
and LA -- they are worried about everything being just perfect.
Unfortunately, SF is getting the short end, and LA will get everyone on the
22nd.  The Chem. Bros are the only ones still confirmed for Friday june 21,
and a couple of others might be here Monday the 24th.

solstice weekend could become an ambitious roadtrip . . .

It as PHAT,  Incredible,  and one of the best raves I've been to yet.
About 500 tix were sold,  and that area is one of the best areas to have
a kick-ass party.   Lineup was terriffic,  but I left at 2 am on Sunday,
and things were still going.   Spun was on when I left,  or was it Garth..

I got there late Friday,   sound system wasn't on then,  but in morning
the music started and kept going.   Later that evening,  they stopped the
music shortly,  to re-wire some things,   but 15 minutes,  it was back on
again.

Wicked crew Kicked ass,  and Garth spun a terrific set.   So did Carlos..

I'm sure there will be more reviews,   wish I could say more,  but cannot
stay here much longer and have to upload my Email.

More news of the weird.  This came from my sister

-kaysee

---------forward-------

Speaking of weird but true facts, when I was living in San Diego, a man
became very angry at his lover because the lover was either cheating on him
or not paying him enough attention.  One day, while the man's lover was
napping on the couch, the man put a loaded cross-bow to the back of his head
and shot his lover.  The arrow went through the middle of the man's brain
and the tip of the arrow was poking out his forehead.  This woke him up and
he became very distraught upon finding he had been shot.  He was taken to
the hospital, where the surgeons removed the feathers from the end of the
arrow and pushed it through his brain and out the front of his head.  He was
not impaired in any way.  That was a true story.  They showed photos of the
man with the arrow poking out of his forehead on the news and showed
diagrams of how the surgeons planned to remove the arrow.

heh. yeah, when i first got to sf, i  tried to find a party in the GG Park
that way. figured, hey, how big can a park be.
errrrr...
sorry you didnt get up.

(even with maps, a bunch of people took the wrong route and had to drive
through some creek, and  one group got lost for about 6 hours in the
immediate region of the ranch)

take care

WOW! what a beautiful party!  We got there on saturday, and set up camp 
before checking out the beautiful surroundings.  People were doing a 
group yoga thing, enjoying the hot tubs, mud baths and many were just 
laying around basking in all the surrounding natural beauty.

After dancing a bit I took a nice walk in the woods to chill out just 
before sunset.  After that Phred got me and alot of other people 
dancing.  I danced most of the night, with a few breathers here and 
there.  I thought the music was great.  There was a nice variety and I 
enjoyed it all.

Sunday most people blissfully lounged  out to the tunes.  I alternated 
on that and some dancing here and there.  

Angela unfortunately had decided not to come, because she has doctors 
orders to not dance so her tendinitious in her leg could heal.  To bad, 
because this was a party that many seemed to enjoy by mostly hanging 
out in the beauty. We usually like to enjoy and share the vibe mostly 
by dancing, but this party had plenty of vibe floating around all over 
to be enjoyed all around.

We left early sunday afternoon exhausted and fully saturated from all 
the beautiful music.  Lee did a great job driving back, especially in 
the beginning as we made a wrong turn and drove up this steep hill with 
huge potholes that looked like only 4-wheeled jeep could drive on, but 
some how we managed to climb this hill a bit before turning around.

Thank you amebas for another great party,
something to take with me before angela and I leave for a 2 month 
adventure in indonesia.

Look foward to dancing with you all when we get back in august.
Have a beautiful summer everyone.

:)

I'm still trying to digest everything that occurred over the weekend. 
Tribal Future was simply wonderful.  I don't think I could even 
do it justice by describing my own limited experience.  But, I'll try.

We left on Friday and proceeded to take a wrong turn to the right instead 
of the left.  We saw another car go that way (Branka) and figured it must 
have been right!!! (silly idea to act like lemmings, eh?)  But, alas, we 
realized something was very wrong after 
we drove over 4 creeks and had our little car in 4 wheel drive.  So, we 
turned around and went the right way.  Unfortunately, this made us two 
hours later than hoped for, which meant no light to put our tent up to.  
After locating a spot in the orchard, behind a hill, we frustratingly put 
up the stupid tent.  Advice: don't put your tent way up a hill because 
you'll never ever want to walk all the way up there again.  Duh, stupid 
us.  Plus, the spot we where we pitched our tent was in the blaring sun all 
day, another reason we never actually used our tent.  Second duh!!!

Friday the music played until about 3:30 am.  Then it started at 9:30 the 
next day and never stopped except for a few minor incidents for as long 
as I can remember (maybe it's still going...!!! :)  I heard some great 
stuff including some funky trip hop that you wouldn't hear at any old 
rave.  There was so much time to play tons of music that we got to hear a 
huge variety.  The James Brown samples rocked my world!!!  "Funky 
Drummer" has to be the most widely sampled song ever.  Throughout the 
weekend there was lots of fun stuff including samples by Madonna, Fela, 
and some Irish bagpipes.  There was also some reggae and hip hop worked 
in, even some great guitar licks.  It all worked really well.

Saturday during the day we did a variety of things including hiking 
around, dancing a little bit, hanging out with great people, and catching 
some well needed rays for us white bodies!!  The gardens were beautiful, lots 
of bugs (my own passion).  Some of the chirping that people heard were 
actually cicadas and not crickets.  I was hoping to see one because there are
some really beautiful ones that are bright red, but I never did.  (all right, 
I'm digressing!!!)

The rest of my little group showed up around 4 on Saturday and by the 
time we ate and got them settled, tons of people had started arriving.  
It was amazing.  The spirits were really high.  Like Leslie said, the 
only unhappy people there were people who were truly ill.  You have to 
really want to be there to drive that far and make the effort.

Still learning about raving, I noticed this neat phenomenon.  As soon as 
the sun set, it signalled everyone to enter "rave mode."  It was 
uncanny.  All of a sudden everyone came out of hiding and communed around 
the music.  Craziness and celebration had begun.  It was like this 
interesting circadian rhythm; lights off, rave on!!!  I mentioned this to 
Leslie, and she said, of course, it's called "getting in the groove."  
Utterly fascinating.  The collective power of 400 human beings was 
released, and it was the most powerful thing I've ever felt.  

As people were stomping to the music, the grass got somewhat torn up and 
the dance area became a dust arena.  The moon started rising higher in 
the sky and illuminated the dusty dancers with it's eery blue light.  The 
glow sticks and blinking lights added to the surreal effect of the hazy 
dance area.  I had this neat little flash light in which you could see 
the entire beem of light because of the dust.  We had too much fun with 
our glow sticks (4 different colors) making patterns in the dusky night air.

After tiring out a bit, we spent some time underneath the stars above the 
garden in the chill area.  We found some mint plants that were mixed in 
with the grass that emanated a heavenly scent.  The moon was so bright 
that you could see everything with unnatural clarity.  In the chill area 
there was also a black light with two really great paintings that added 
this neat little rave effect to the garden.  It was this juxtaposition of 
the natural and the unnatural, but it worked somehow and made you feel 
like Alice in Wonderland.

By that time my friends went back to the dance area, but my body was so 
exhausted that I felt like my bones were poking out of my flesh.  I had 
to go sleep at 4 am, which really bummed me out because I never felt like 
I truly got enough dancing in.  There was a lot of great effects with the 
music including this big VAVOOM like a jet airplane flying above.  It 
entered the dance area on top of the music, and literally knocked your 
socks off.  I'm still reeling from that.  I think it was the dj that came 
on after Tracy, Josh maybe?

The guys at the Smoothie bar were really great.  We had an entire back 
pack of toys and with their black light, we set them up.  We even got a 
free smoothie.  Very sweet.  I've accumulated a great set of toys, so next 
time you find me, don't hesitate to ask me for something. (Brendan is 
convinced that I never left kindergarten!!!  Hmmm.  Maybe he's right!!) 
Things are much better when they are shared, and Tribal Future epitomized 
that saying.  Everyone shared everything.

I slept from about 4-8 and when I got up, everyone else was going to 
bed.  The morning was beautiful and hot.  I hung out with Shawna who 
wasn't sleeping a wink and had contagious dancing feet.  :)  Then in the 
afternoon everyone convened on the lawn which was the  only shady place 
without poison oak!!  There was a huge mass of people.  We brought out 
the toys once again and lots of food.   Everyone just walked around and 
hung out in different places, relaxing and sleeping.  It was very mellow 
and special because everyone was still riding this wave of ecstasy (not 
the drug:) from the night before.  This was where you touched base with all 
of the people you met the night before.

Then, we had to go home around 4 pm :(  I would have loved to stay, but 
couldn't.  I loved the people that were there.  I hope we get to hang out 
some more!!  Sfravers really are amazing.  I don't know what it is, but 
you guys sure have big hearts!!

There was tons of poison oak.  Where there was shade, there was the evil 
plant.  I'm immune, so I have no problem, but I wonder if anyone else got 
it bad.  I saw people who didn't know what it looked like pitching tents 
right in the middle of it.  I warned quite a few people.  The plants were 
young and not too oily, so maybe it won't be too bad!!

Wow, I guess I wrote quite a bit.  Didn't mean to!!  Have a great 
weekend, I'll see you again this coming weekend where I plan to get my 
fill of dancing seeing as I'm not satiated yet!!!

Cheers,
KaySEE

NET SFRAVERS, 
 
HELP!  I need another net provider.  Hooked sucks! 
 
If  you think your net provider is awesome, please tell me who it is. 
I'm looking for a provider with a good browser (like netscape) and someone
who provides Mac access and is cheap and has a reliable connection!  I use
the net about 10-14 hours/wk, so I was looking to pay no more than $20/mo. 
 
--erik 
 
I wouldn't mind having my own account so I could get rid of this shit... 
 
**IMPORTANT!  READ DISCLAIMER** 
These words were NOT written by moonpup 
He's in London until late August 
 
...and I'm ERIK.  I'll be using his address until then 
Please address all comments, rebuttals, love or hate letters to me, ERIK 
or drop me a line... 415-337-6666

Additional information:  The meeting is at Maureen Garrett's house in San 
Rafael... 251 C Street.  Phone 415-459-5334.  Take 101 north, exit 
Central San Rafael, stay in left lanes.  Turn left onto 3rd.  Take 3rd 
down to 'D' Street, turn left onto D.  Get into Right Lane.  Cross over 
2nd, past gas station...make a left onto San Rafael Ave. (mailbox on left)
park.  Stop sign ahead is 'C'. Make a right, third house from corner.
7:30 PM. (Please bring what you need to be comfortable food and drink wise)  

My house is also two minutes by car from the San Rafael Bus Terminal.

Other Ideas:

Medicine Circle/Mandala Design

As well as being a mega theme camp...a very strong psychic hit I had is that 
the dance floor/camp needs to be mapped out like a medicine circle, a 
mandala...to the four directions, with altars at each direction and 
sculpture which represents those directions...(all 3-D art especially is 
welcome), access into and out of the camp via the well marked (with 
flourscent line marking paint) will make up the cardinal roads leading 
into the space.  Our tents and RV's, etc. will sit beyond the inner and 
outer circles of the dance floor like a wagon train...
>From an airplane this will resemble a crop circle (of sorts)...

Think about things you have or know about which can contribute to
containing the energy of this space...  flourscent cones (like abandoned 
ones by the side of the highway  ;-).... wood for fires, and decorations 
for the Disco  Inferno...

Theme

Burning Man has a major  HELL theme going this year (objects to be 
torched)  so Disco Inferno works rather well.....actually!!!!

Ceremony

Going into my third year at BM, I see a powerful opportunity for our
family.

As a collective, we can use  the healing  power of fire to transform 
our family, the House Movement, into something even more powerful,  
strong and deeply rooted underground than it currently is,  
affecting all life it's roots touch in a positive and permanent 
beauty way......

Closing:

As Jim pointed out, we have a little under three months to organize this
camp...and there is much to do....  peace...   --Maureen

Dear Kiddies,

	Having been driving for a few weeks now a car that has an AM-only 
radio, I've become somewhat more familiar with that frequency.
	And lo and behold, I found an interesting station that I never 
knew existed.  I think it (KDFC) used to have another format, but now 
apparantly it is called Kid Star "radio just for kids".  
	For anyone who listened to that school lunch menu man and liked 
it, I suggest you check this out!  AM 1220...
	My favorite is "MJ", the female afternoon DJ.  

Much love,
				<<< Starchild >>>

I have been to a few of their parties in S.F. and I think it is the
Collective for Creative Consciousness.
Can anyone confirm?

That sounds a lot more like it - I didn't think Martin AKA Communion Clothing was organizing goa trance full moon parties.
I WOULD DESPARATELY LIKE THE INFO/CONTACT # FOR THE PEOPLE THAT THREW THAT PARTY - DOES ANYBODY KNOW????
DISCLAIMER: The above is not mean to be "yelled" or "shouted," just in capital letters  : )  = )
I posted a question asking if anybody knew who these people were, and how to contact them, but got no response.  If anybody has any sort of idea, please, PLEASE post!  Thanks!!
Infinite positive energy...

I have been to a few of their parties in S.F. and I think it is the
Collective for Creative Consciousness.
Can anyone confirm?

from my understanding they dont have a voice mail, its a word of mouth 
thing. if they do have a vmail, its probably not a good idea to 
distribute it on the list, private email would be better - from what i've 
been told, anyway.

i heard it called Consordium (sp?) of Collective Consciousness, BTW.

love and energy to ya all,

Yo SFRers;

        Tribal Future my kind a party, nothing but praise, nuff said because
I just couldn't possibly fit all the wonderful things about it in a post
without pissing you all off because it's too long. So I'm gona share an
experience I had driving home the first time from Tribal Future.

        I ended up giving Tristian a ride up there only to turn around and
come ride back down to SF again so I could meet a friend and come up Sunday.
Anyway it was just dawn in Mendocino County at the site of Tribal Future
where this tale starts.

        I had just woken up Tristian who fell a sleep in my car, and told
him that I had to get going bout 5:45am. I'm one of those people who love to
drive, in fact there's only one thing I like doing better than driving, and
that's sex. Give me a nice car, a empty mountain road, some great music and
it just can't get any better with the exception of the above mentioned.

        The drive up and back to the site is just beautiful, it normally
takes 3 hours or  so for most people. Anyway and like I said I had just left
Tristian at the site, and proceeded down this most scared of mountain roads.
The mountains where still partially shrouded in that early morning  mist,
making them even more beautiful then they already are. I put on Eric of  F-8
fame's tape and started to have a spiritual experience as I proceeded down
the mountain in my rental car. I just happen to be driving a fire engine red
1996 5.0 liter Mustang convertible, with the top down and the overdrive off.

        Well that's when the magic started to happen because the mountain
road, smokie, and myself  made a pack, that today I owned the mountain road,
and that nothing could stop, harm or get in my way. I can't really but into
words what happened to me up there on the way home, if you're into driving
and trance you already know. It's sorta like the male version of the womyn
on the mountain top dressed in white robes blowing in the wind, like that
Peppermint Patty commercial. I made it home to Emeryville in 2 hours and 15
minutes needless to say.

        Thanks Allen, Mark and all the Ameba's for Tribal Future.

Peace
THX1138

Exactly, how I found the location, wonderful and a nice link with nature. 
And the morning found those of us left surrounding by all the greens and
 the pale blue sky above. Very calming and peaceful.

I think Jess described the music perfectly. I especially loved MARS's set 
of beautiful music-one moment spacey then pounding my body mercilessly. 
Thoroughly mental music. I just hope I can find him at Love Parade in 
Berlin this summer.

One more thing I might add that REALLY disappointed me...

The morning after the Plastik party I went with some friends to breakfast
and then we cruzed up the coast to Bonny Dunes to kick it.  A few people I
know said they were going up there so I thought it would be nice to hang
out at the beach after the party.

Well when i got there - there were about 20 -30 people up by the RR tracks
with a Nitrus tank having a little Nitrus party.  Nitrus for one discusts
me (for some reason) and many people were gettin' drunk and fryin' as well.
One big drug gathering with no respect for other people who wanted to
enjoy the day and the beach.  Some one had taged the RR ties and some
rocks, ballons were scattered everywhere, empty beer bottles smashed
against the tracks.  I say a man with his 8 yr. old son walk up an by to
the beach and I thought to myself what an image for a little boy to see =3D =
A
bunch of kids gettin' fucked up and not giving a fuck about their
surroundings or the people that visit this beautyful place.  I bitched at
some guys by the tank to see if they could take it else where and they just
gave me a Fuck you attitude.  I left.  I am really sorry what happened
there and couldn't stand to think these are the type of people I had just
partied with that night - some were my friends.  I need new friends.

I can't wait to move to San Luis Obisbo and start a new.  Hopefully this
summer I can met some of you and possible creat a summer friendship with
some...

Can you stand another?  I'll make it short and sweet.

Put it this way:  I couldn't have asked for a better event to take my 
freshly arrived friend from London to.  

I certainly was not expecting the Paradise garden to spend endless hours 
in. 

Or non stop WONDERFUL music..
Or non stop sweet vibe.

Tis a weekend I shall never forget, or anyone else who went, for that matter.

Only disappointment was only meeting *one* new sfraver. (Erik)
Was pleased to see and talk to the other sfravers who I know and love.

I'll be smiling for a good long time...

love,
Amy

the whole thing just so exceeded my expectations . . . it was such a
beautiful eco-friendly extended rave family village, eating, dancing,
sleeping, showering, hot tubbing, swimming, raving, loving & living
together

i smiled today when i saw the dust still on my car from the miles of "dirt"
(rocks & dust) roads . . . i enjoyed the zen of driving 15 m.p.h. in the
tracks of the drivers who preceded you to avoid the biggest rocks . . . it
felt so far away from anyone else, and we were literally "off the grid."
Someone told me solar generators were running the turntables for most of
the afternoons!

the full-moonlight cast this bluish haze . . . the night air was so
comfortable and fresh . . . nothing like dancing much of the night and then
hot tubbing at 6 am . . . too bad the tub next to the turntables (!) was
too hot for humankind, but the third tub near the ambient area was perfect
. . . after the first long stretch it was great to cool off on the edge of
the tub, get cool and get back into the tub, get hot and sit on the edge,
repeat until liquid . . .

great moments in the chill area, sleeping in the shade late sunday morning
with everyone sprawled around, and some great hammock time saturday
afternoon as well

and hanging out in the eel river, getting refreshed for the inevitable
drive home, and the huge blood-red moon rising over the east bay . . .

there are so many of you i connected with . . . i can't wait to see you
again knowing what we did this past weekend

mark & uncle walter & everyone else -- you've created a sacred space, and I
hope we treated it kindly

Well all I can say about Tribal Future is I don't think the smile left my
face. I really wasn't in the mood Friday to go to TF, after my truck
getting stolen, but then returned I also unknowingly broken my ribs. When I
went to my moms house to get ready to pickup my truck I jump the side fence
and landed pretty good on my ribs. I thought they were just browsed bad and
went on my way. I went to TF and every now and then fell alittle pain when
I breathed or coughed or lied on my stomach. All the fun I had at TF kept
my mind mostly away from it. I went to the doctors on Tuesday and found out
the were broken.

Anyway, I'm glad I went to TF I had one of the best times in a long time.
Thanks to the Ameba's and everyone else that helped out and was there to
make this event one of the best. Even those cows in the road that we had to
wait for in order to drive on, that was funny waiting as they crossed the
road and some stopping to just look right at you.

The funniest thing was when I went to say something to someone and look
right at them and just started laughing, nothing would come out of my mouth
but a laugh. I really can't remember what was so funny, if in fact I was
laughing at something funny or just laughing, I don't know which. The worst
thing that happened was leaving after it was all over. A part of me wishes
I could live like that forever and not worry about anything. Dam, what a
weekend!

I've been to massive raves in warehouses, crowded clubs, daytime and nighttime
beach parties, outdoor moon parties, small house parties, trance parties, jungle
parties, good parties, bad parties.  

But I've never been to heaven before.  And this weekend, we were given heaven on
earth as the tribe gathered to celebrate all that we love -- the music, the
earth, and each other.  What more could we possibly want?

Mark Ameba on the first night, soaking alone naked in the wood-stoked hot tub
near the turntables, having just dipped his amazing birds-nest hat in the
steaming water and put it on the ledge, and the steam was rising off the water
in the tub, with a separate chimney of steam coming off of his hat.

Erik, after 2am on Friday, when the music stopped, staying there and drumming
with the sounds of the forest until he was tired enough to sleep.

Allen, on Saturday, walking down from the mud baths, naked and covered with mud
like a creature from another world, standing on the rise above the dance area
watching us as we watched him.  (The man is master of wardrobe, even when he
isn't wearing any clothes.)

Lounging on the terraced grassy gardens, baking even though we were under the
shade of the redwoods, wishing for a frozen margarita, and having Dave walk up
with a cooler of cold, cold, icy Tequate beers to share.

Napping late Saturday afternoon, and waking to find the village of tents had
sprung up around me while I slept.

Watching Andrew show the littlest ones how to feed what looked like catfood to
the fish in the garden's brick trellised fish pond, and suddenly the huge trout
go into feeding frenzy, churning the water, until it quieted to a smooth surface
again.

A naked boy and girl, about four years old, walking in the tiered cultivated
gardens, sharing flowers and talking softly, it was the Garden of Eden.

Overhearing someone ask "have you seen a tent with a metallic whirly-gig on it?
I'm looking for Leslie Ayres" and I'm sitting right next to him -- Hi Lee!

Nightfall Saturday, the anticipation of the full-force tribal gathering, with
the full moon rising above the mountain, shining down between a frame of
redwoods on us.

Brendan, dancing smoothly, smiling, gliding in the dark on the grassy flat dance
area, with swirling green glowsticks leaving trails in the dark.

The firedance woman, twirling blazing fireballs on long ropes in intricate
designs.

Tim (knucklehead), sore ribs or not, standing in the middle of the dance area,
not moving, with amazement on his face.

Vince, arriving in his full regalia with skirt and blue metallic shirt, then
letting Ed wear his silver rubberized op-art 2-foot-tall stovepipe hat, with me
adding the condition that Ed had to dance up to the front of the dance area,
smiling at everyone along the way, dance in front of the dj, then come back,
making sure to look at everyone, because he is wearing the "vibe" hat -- and he
loved it so much we passed it onto several other people to have their turn.

Going to catch a nap early Sunday morning, and the mountain is vibrating,
throbbing like it's breathing or its heart is beating, as the bass echoes upward
to the sky but also downward into the earth.  I thought we were having an
earthquake, I actually got up to look outside my tent.

Saying goodbye on Sunday to those who had to leave, and watching new faces
appear from down the lane, coming for the full moon party.

Flush toilets, yes really, set on wooden platforms surrounded by lattice and
bamboo screens, open to the trees up above (yep, that's really the lap of
luxury).

Polywog in the early light Monday, playing Patsy Cline and any damn thing she
felt like, and everyone appreciating they were listening to someone who hears
music in an entirely different way and is willing to show us how.

Wayne and Marcy, naked in the Eel River, sitting wrapped together on a rock
kissing, showing us that love is real, and forgetting that they had asked me to
take their picture as they forgot anyone else is there (that will be one awesome
photo).

I want to thank all of my friends, old and new, for being part of that amazing
three days with me -- even those who went to F-8, because we felt your presence
too -- At least I know I have had one weekend in ShangriLa.  We are truly
blessed.

Leslie  : )

Since I never get to go to these events that happen during the week and i 
am spending this entire week in this beautiful city, I will be going to CU.

For those sfravers I have not met yet (an increasing # of you at that) 
look for me!
I'll be wearing a sleeveless white funky shirt with green trim and jeans.
I've long brown hair and stand about 5'6", so come up and say hi and i 
sill introduce you to my friend from London, too. (who also had a BLAST 
at Tribal Future!)

Didn't think I would ever show my face at 1015 again, but CU isn't just a 
club. :)

love,
Amy

Hmm I didnt to the renting. So for more information post to 
socal-raves@ucsd.edu, KC or someone will give you the number to call to 
rent a cabin. Already the socal folks have a corner of town with about 
5-7 cabins rented. I'am sure they would be happy to have some sfraves 
neighbors.

well, let's see

first of all the "Disco Inferno" name is meant to be coy
and ironic in keeping with Burning Man's stated theme of "A Season in Hell"

the basic idea is to rent and transport a massive sound system with
all the whistles and bells (generator, lights, satellite hook-ups, altars,
things to burn, mirror ball) and have it set up and ready to go
by Weds. August 28th (the night of the Full Moon)

we would like for this to be a cooperative venture involving
Friends and Family, Pacific, Spaz, F8, CCC, Gateway, Ultraviolet,
St. John's, The River and Section 23 (from Manchester UK) - And be open
to others who are into this whole scene for the love of whatever music
they're into and not into profit-mongering

the estimate is that this would cost 3 to 5 thousand dollars to pull
off properly
since we are all essentially poor, the idea would be for the above listed
to collaborate on a couple of outdoor parties as fund raisers (with a 
suggested $5 donation) prior to Burning Man and a post Burning Man
event on the Saturday following (as a reunion and final fundraiser if
necessary) - this should raise the necessary funds 

i know that some of the above listed collectives own their own sound 
system, but i think it would be fun to have a really great LOUD system
and not wreck havoc on any collective's smaller system

The parties would start at sunset on Wednesday with an opening ritual
by The River and then perhaps the Gateway Full Moon Collective would take
over - each night could be one or two of the above listed groups 
collaborating on something with a fully organized list of who plays when
throughout the weekend
There would be something in this mega-camp every night from 9pm to 9am

All of the equipment would be set on pallets and enclosed in tents in the
event of sudden weather changes - top priority would be on protecting the
equipment so that each collective gets a fair opportunity to put on a
version of what they like to do - from old school to goa with a thread of
ceremonial intent throughout

The suggestion for the first fund raiser would be July 3rd.

I am not entirely naive - though that is debateable - I realize that
this will require the endorsement and participation of most of the listed
cooperatives along with the endorsement and participation of most people
on sfraves

Disco Inferno (ideally) would be set up a couple of miles east of the
Man with the speakers pointed east - the idea would be to keep the area
east of the dance space totally clear of cars and campsites so that each 
sunrise could be fully experienced by the dancers, with camping, cars
and porta potties set up to the west, south or north of the dance space

I'd like as much input on this as possible
and also like to have the next meeting next wednesday  in either
San Francisco or the south bay

Feedback?

Hey guys and gals,

What the heck is going on?  The list is very low volume.  That is soooo 
strange.  The only other time I've seen that is during Burning Man.  I 
only had about 12 messages between yesterday and today.  I'm not 
complaining or anything :)  I was 
just wondering why everyone is so quiet?  I'm in awe; sfravers *without* 
anything to say.  Damn!!  :)

Hey, I have a neat topic, maybe a bit strange, but here goes..

Saturday night at Tribal Future my friends and I started talking about 
the first music we can remember hearing that piqued our interest.  Mine 
was "Nazareth, Hair of the Dog"  I was in Elementary school and this is 
the first music I remember listening to.  I remember re-playing track one 
on the 8 track cassette over and over again covertly when my big sis was 
gone!!!  :) :)  What's yours?

Nostalgia...hmmm

cheers,
KaySEE

Come*unity was a whole lotta fun last night... All of the things that
could have been negatives (sometimes-slow untrancey music, club
atmosphere, etc.) somehow actually added something to my experience..

It was also fun to see lots of sfravers (even some I hadn't met before!) 
and to be transported by such a huge, grooving crowd (especially for a
wednesday night).  Just what I needed!! 

Thanks to Shawna for her (always) good company!!  Now, it's time to get
down to some serious learning.

See y'all!

Other than classical music which I was weaned on and which will remain a
most enduring passion, the following two first music experiences stand
out:

1. Rubber Soul by the Beatles (for all you young'uns who don't remember)
Favorite track:  "I'm looking through you, where did you go. I thought I
knew you, what did I know".....etc...

2. the HAIR soundtrack - we had a two album set, one record was red and
the other one was green - the green one had a huge crack in it but if you
lined the edges up just right it would still play!  "once upon-a-looking
for Donna, girl, she was a sixteen year-old virgin"....etc....

I don't have the flyer in front of me, but I believe it is Garth, Tony,
Josh, Doc Martin, Doran, and Brownie.  The only one I'm not sure about is
Josh....  It should be a great party.  Anyone else hear any rumors about
possible locations (in the city, east Bay etc.?)

hello all-

just so you know, my brothers were playing peter gabriel when i was born,
and i have been listening to him ever since.  i was rather suprised when i
found out that not all people enjoyed his music.

glad to enter into the conversation of a not-normally quiet list!

peace, love, and good music-

Mine I had to say was a song that I still do not know the name or who
sang it but I must say  have only heard it sampled a million times since 
then . .. . 

"When I hear music it makes me dance!"

Along with Madonna and Prince and Culture club, david Bowie (my first
albums)
Cassandra

P.S. Who is going to Basics?
ANyone from SOuth Bay?

first musical memory I have. Definately before I remember school of any sort.

Without going back to the "first" music I recall hearding ....

  I recall when I was about 12, standing at some record bins at the air 
base BX and seeing these 45's by this new group, I'd never heard of... I 
asked an older woman ( but now I wonder what "older" meant to me then ) what
they were like and she answered that they were "pretty good for a rock &
roll group"... so I bought 2 of the 45's took them home and listened away...
Yea this stuff was pretty good after all... the records: I Want to Hold Your
Hand / I Saw Her Standing There   Twist & Shout/??? Not sure of exact 
flip side...

Just another of us sleepers,

Mike

*File Description: Berkeley California*


    "Berkeley California"

(Sung to the tune "Hotel California" by the Eagles)

 In a dark dim machine room
 Cool A/C in my hair
 Warm smell of silicon
 Rising up through the air
 Up ahead in the distance
 I saw a Solarian(tm) light
 My kernel grew heavy, and my disk grew slim
 I had to halt(8) for the night
 The backup spun in the tape drive
 I heard a terminal bell
 And I was thinking to myself
 This could be BSD or USL
 Then they started a lawsuit
 And they showed me the way
 There were salesmen down the corridor
 I thought I heard them say

 Welcome to Berkeley California
 Such a lovely place
 Such a lovely place (backgrounded)
 Such a lovely trace(1)
 Plenty of jobs at Berkeley California
 Any time of year
 Any time of year (backgrounded)
 You can find one here
 You can find one here

 Their code was definately twisted
 But they've got the stock market trends
 They've got a lot of pretty, pretty lawyers
 That they call friends
 How they dance in the courtroom
 See BSDI sweat
 Some sue to remember
 Some sue to forget
 So I called up Kernighan
 Please bring me ctime(3)
 He said
 We haven't had that tm_year since 1969
 And still those functions are calling from far away
 Wake up Jobs in the middle of the night
 Just to hear them say

 Welcome to Berkeley California
 Such a lovely Place
 Such a lovely Place (backgrounded)
 Such a lovely trace(1)
 They're livin' it up suing Berkeley California
 What a nice surprise
 What a nice surprise (backgrounded)
 Bring your alibies

 Windows NT a dreaming
 Pink OS on ice
 And they said
 We are all just prisoners here
 Of a marketing device
 And in the judges's chambers
 They gathered for the feast
 They diff(1)'d the source code listings
 But they can't kill -9 the beast
 Last thing I remember
 I was restore(8)'ing | more(1)
 I had to find the soft link back to the path I was before
 sleep(3) said the pagedaemon
 We are programmed to recv(2)
 You can swap out any time you like
 But you can never leave(1)

That would be "When I Hear Music" by Debbie Deb (Jam Packed Records, SUN 
413, 1983, for all you trainspotters...). Classic early electro/freestyle 
from Miami. 

As for me Kraftwerk's "Computer World" blew my mind in the 5th grade. But 
Bach's Tocatta and Fugue in D minor is probably the first song I was 
really nuts about.

The Cars!!!!

Ok, my first musical mussings must have been Styx.  This is kinda 
embarassing, but I rembember standing in front of a mirror lip syncing 
and dancing around to "Blue Collar Man". or was it White collar Man..... 
on my walkman.  My older brother and a bunch of his friends came in the 
room started making fun of me.  My brother was really mean to me when I 
was a kid.   anyways, I was 8 years old when that happend.  I also 
remember listening to alot of Kiss and Journey.

A few poeple have mentioned Styx as their first musical 
experience.....makes ya wonder if Styx music was giving off some sort of 
'pre-rave-vibe'........

     I loved Kool & the Gang.  (You've got to cool it now, cooooool watch out!)
The first piece of vinyl I ever got though was from my mom for my 5th or
6th birthday.  It was called My First Disco Album and I still have it.  The
songs?
        -Copacabana
        -Dance With Me
        -Shake Your Booty
        -That's the Way I Like It
        -Do the Hustle
        -Dance Across the Floor
        -Shadow Dancing
        -With a Little Luck

My 2nd piece of vinyl was a record called Smurfing Sing Song.  That was a
good one too.  It had a song called "You're a Pink Toothbrush"  That was
probably my favorite.  After that it was Michael Jackson, Madonna, Huey
Lewis and The News (still can't believe that one) and last but not least,
that King Tut song.  I can't remember now who sang it but I used to dance
around the house and sing at the top of my lungs.  I liked it cuz it had a
funky beat.  Anyone else?

When I was 13 a friend gave me a tape with Depeche Mode's 
'Speak & Spell'. I was crazy about it and Depeche Mode 
became my first favorite band (first record, first concert, ...).

And I still like their music.

Well...Tomorrow is my last day of having my internet connection & email 
address.  It will be my last day of work down in Irvine & that is where I have 
my connection. 

The sad thing is I'm moving to San Francisco on the 16th of June & will not 
have a computer for a while. I have yet to meet any of you & now that I will 
have more opportunities, I lose my email address!!!  As soon as I get a 
computer, I will return to sfraves!!!

Even though I will not be on the list for a while, I will definitely be at 
some gatherings!!!  I have long blonde hair...Oops...sorry, I forgot I chopped 
it off!!!!  Now my blonde hair is a bob!!!  I will be the one dressed in black 
dancing all night with a big smile on my face!!1  I know that describes a lot 
of us!!  Sometimes I will be up dancing against the speaker...something I 
picked up down here in LA.  Well, anyways,I hope I meet some of you people!!  
I've enjoyed being on this list!!!

Drip, drip, drop, little april showers.

Bamby made me cry when I was a little kid (and still does), but that song 
stuck with me for some reason and is the first song I can remember.  I think
Bear Necessity (sp?) form the jungle book was second.  Boy, I must have 
had almost every Disnsy record every made (at that time).

Regarding my 1st musical experience...

I remember being one of those awkward, nerdy kids in 8th grade (you know 
the ones; no one hung around with them ) and hearing for the 1st time:

"... all in all you're just a-nother brick in the wall..."

Pink Floyd.  Must have been around 1980 or 81.

I also have fond memories of DOUBLE DUTCH BUS.

the first music i remember was this weird halloween record we had ... 
with songs like Rock-A-Bye Monster :)  that one scared me, cos it had 
awful sound effects of this poor monster going THUD! out of the tree.

Also, i used to sit in the car when mom went shopping and listen to The 
Irish Rovers!  I loved Bye Bye Bi-Plane, Winken Blinken and Nod, and of 
course The Unicorn :)

boy i'm glad my musical tastes have improved.

Maybe I'm retarded, but on the east coast, the only time you get charged
for a telephone call is when you dial a 1 in front of it.  There is no
"toll call"  bullshit. 
 
Soooooooooooo.  I've been using what I thought was a free call to access
the net.  
BUT, I just opened my phone bill and learned that I've been charging about
$25/day in calls to what I thought was a local number because it didn't
have a one in front of it. 
 
SO, I now owe the pacific FUCKING bell about $500!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  And
guess what? 
I can't pay it.  So what the fuck to I do?  I just spent everything I owned
to get to San Fran.  And I don't have a stable job yet. 
 
I've been on the phone with several PacBell people including managers and
the best they can come up with is a payment plan.  Fuck the payment plan! 
This is BULLSHIT! 
It never even occured to me to check to see if I was dialing a "local, 12
mile radius" number".  What an asinine system.  So I guess everytime before
I call a number I have to get out a map and see if the number I'm calling
lies within the fucking 12 mile radius circle around my house?  Goddamn
this is crazy!  
 
Any suggestions? 
 
If I don't pay, than Milt (moonpup) is screwed, big time.  Say goodbye to
credit history.

Aside from singing little songs in school with the class, my first real
memories of music that I dug was reggae.  Any reggae lovers out there
remember that old 1971 soundtrack from The Harder They Come by Jimmy Cliff?
I was just telling Paul A last night as a matter of fact, how "Johnny Too
Bad" was the very first song I ever memorized the entire lyrics too.  Heh
heh..  And I have distinct memories (yes I was dancing even then!) of 2nd or
3rd grade when I'd go into the living room, shut all the doors, make sure no
one was looking, put on the song Exodus by Bob Marley, and dance my ass off
thru the whole song! :)  Hee hee!  How mortified I'da been had any grownups
caught me, heaven forbid somebody should see me dance! ;)

Love,
Shawna

Basics and Down to Earth look pretty good for Saturday; I haven't checked
out a lot of the new weeklies, so I don't know what to tell ya bout those.
There was supposed to be a big party "Organic '96" later, with lots of 
big acts, but rumor has it the SF show is being scaled back - I'll post
info when it firms up.

More bad luck.... 
 
After I got my second $25 ticket in front of my house for street
cleaning... 
 
I was riding moonpups bike to the beach and around the golden gate park I
got a flat.  I pulled a 2 inch nail out of the tire.  I managed to push the
bike 25 blocks to the Haight area and left it at my friend Jess' Place. 
 
But I need to get it home. 
 
Does anyone own a truck that would be willing to help me transfer it to a
shop to get the tire fixed? 
 
Help me please!

 Astrology or Coincidence? 
  
Prior to my streak of bad luck, I posted that I was looking for a decent 
place to get my hair cut (planning to get about a foot taken off).  I got 
several replys and I decided to go with an  SFRaver named Greg's 
recommendation at this place called Belli Capelli.  
  
I called and I was set up to get my hair cut by this guy named Gregory 
(Coincidence?).  While getting my hair cut, we talked and I told him that I

had just packed up my shit and moved to San Fran at the beginning of the 
month.  He said,  "Me too!  I just did the same from Atlanta." 
(Coincidence?)  
  
After some more chatting, he asked my what my sign was.  I said, "Pices".  
He said, "Me, too!"(Coincidence?)  He said his B-day was Mar. 5th.  I said,

"Me, too!" (Coincidence?)  He then proceded to describe me, my personality 
and my thought process over the last month.  It was basically right on!  
The same as his, apparently. (Coincidence?)  
  
He also was into making hats.  I never met anyone before that made hats.  
But Jess  
 (SF Rant and Raver) who I also met recently is/was also into making hats 
with a very similar style (Coincidence?)  
  
I don't know... but I just can't understand coincidence some time.  Makes 
me think that it's not.  But then what is it?  
  
By the way... If anyone wants a fucking great hair cut... go to this guy.  
Maybe he can read your soul, too... like he seemed to read mine.

Sorry but all this misspelling of Bonny Doon is really getting to be a pet
peeve of mine! It's spelled BONNY DOON (not dune) and is named for the town
a few miles up the road where Bonny Doon Rd intersects at HWY 1.

Yes!   Besides memories of Little Feat and Jimmy Cliff on my parents 
turntable, my first musical imprint is Gabriel's voice on The Lamb Lies 
Down on Broadway (1974, when I was 5 years old).

No wonder I'm so strange.  ;-p

Yeah, it was actually a lotta fun!  I've only been to 1015 once before, for
Spundae's three year anniversary a cuppla months ago, and then they had the
whole damn enchilada open, this time they only had pretty much the main
level open, so it was a lot smaller.  But it was still fun, in spite of the
clubby type people & open bars.  Everybody was still there to have fun,
everybody was smiling & dancing!  Yeah, the music was kinda slow, guess
Garth's stuff just isn't really my style, but the experience still made me
smile, so that is a good thing.  Hey did anybody who went catch the Robert
Palmer Girls (remember that song? "might as well face it, you're addicted to
love...") dancing up on that stage above the dj?  Me & Amy S. thought they
were pretty funny! :)


>It was also fun to see lots of sfravers (even some I hadn't met before!)

Yeah!  Nice to meet some new sfravers, I found a surprisingly large number
of sfravers there actually.  Anybody who's looking to meet Leslie Ayres,
this is the place to find her!  :)

Well it's Paul's fault that I came out at all, he has this uncanny ability
to drag me out dancing right smack in the middle of the week! Props to Paul
for that one folks! :)  I'd never go out anywhere otherwise...


Well hope to see you all at Basics, I'll be the one carrying around a
Jamaican butt-load of glowsticks of every size & color!  I just realized I
now have about fifteen of them to bring to the next party, large and small,
pink, blue, green, yellow, and red! :):)  *If* you're good, I *might* give
ya one! ;)

Subject: D.I.: a couple of miles from the man?

Hmmm, I believe it was exactly one mile from the man last year, & that was a
hell of a walk, and as far as I know there were no sound bleed complaints.  A
couple of miles would be really harsh on the pedestrians, and would open more
chance to additional people getting run over on the playa.
Just a thought,
Steveo
P.S. what do people think about starting a seperate list for BM, D.I.
brainstorming.  This could get intense (hopefully)

Yeah, I've been wondering about getting a little more information on this
one too, Martin's voicemail still has all the information for the April
Gathering!  Hope he changes the voicemail soon.  I also want to know how
much to expect to pay.  Last one was $17.  Sounds like this may be more?

hello all.  my name is dennis and i'll be working in san fran for the 
next few months.  i've been in the scene in baltimore for a little over a 
year and am itching to go to a party.  alas, but i am clueless.

i heard carlos spin a few times in the baltimore/dc area.  he was 
pretty cool.  my quesiton is, can anyone suggest some kick ass parties that
i must attend?  or dj's to look out for?  i'm into funky house and the 
occasional trance.  hard step jungle ain't my thing.

any suggestions would be appreciated.  thanks all.

dennis

Hi!

 Oboy, here goes... My first radio musical experience was a song called 
"Fox On the Run" by a group called "Sweet"; memorible due to the  
intriguing synth intro. My first album purchased was "Los Chicanos" by 
Cheech and Chong. My first album gifts were "Around the World with 3 Dog 
Night" and the soundtrack to "Live and let Die" by Paul McCartney and 
Wings. 

 My next purchase was a real grab bag - two albums, Barry Manilow's "I 
write the Songs and "Kiss LIve". Go figure.

mid 70's pop/disco/soul . . .

as an 8-year old the first thing I bought was a 45 called "Shame, Shame,
Shame" by Gloria something . . .not that bad, but then i remember liking
"The Night Chicago Died," "Billy, Don't be a Hero," and "Love Will Keep Us
Together,"  ugh  . . . I still have Chic's greatest hits, a little
precursor for phat bass grooves (peace to Bernard Edwards) . . . the
Beatles rescued me from top 40 when I was 12 -- Rubber Soul is still my
fave of theirs, tho I didn't understand Norwegian Wood at the time . . .

Lotsa stuff here...

First Amy asks:

Shawna adds:

Ok, here's my $0.02:

I'm really looking forward to going to a party while I'm in SF this weekend
and figured Basics would be it. I also am a HUGE fan of DJ Dan and was
hoping to catch him at some point. So I called the Basics info number and
got the same old recording that Shawna mentioned.

Then I called DJ Dan's booking agent and the woman on the phone looked up
in Dan's book and found that he's booked in North Carolina on Friday night
and booked "at a party called Basics in San Francisco on Saturday night".
Wow! Doc Martin _and_ DJ Dan! This sounds awesome!

One question:

Andrew mentions "Josh". Is this Josh Wink or another (local?) Josh?

Look for me at Basics!!!

I thought some people might like this.

----------------------------------------------------------

Bill Gates died in a car accident.  He immediately found himself in
purgatory, being sized up by St. Peter.  "Well, Bill, I'm really
confused on this call; I'm not sure whether to send you to Heaven or
Hell. After all, you enormously helped society by putting a computer
in almost every home in America, yet you also created that ghastly
Windows '95. I'm going to do something I've never done before. In your
case I'm going to let you decide where you want to go." Bill replied,
"Well, what's the difference between the two?" St. Peter said, "I'm
willing to let you visit both places briefly, if it will help your
decision."

Fine, but where should I go first?"  "I'll leave that up to you."
"Okay then," said Bill.  "Let's try Hell first." So Bill went to Hell.
It was a beautiful, clean, sandy beach with clear waters and lots of
bikini-clad women running around, playing in the water, laughing and
frolicking about. The sun was shining; the temperature perfect.  He
was very pleased.

"This is great!" he told St. Peter. "If this is hell, I REALLY want to
see heaven!"

"Fine," said St. Peter, and off they went. Heaven was a place high in
the clouds, with angels drifting about, playing harps and singing. It
was nice, but not as enticing as Hell.

Bill thought for a quick minute, and rendered his decision. "Hmmm. I
think I'd prefer Hell," he told St. Peter.  "Fine," retorted St.
Peter, "as you desire." So Bill Gates went to Hell.

Two weeks later, St. Peter decided to check on the late billionaire to
see how he was doing in Hell.  When he got there, he found Bill,
shackled  to a wall screaming amongst hot flames in dark caves, being
burned and tortured by demons.

"How's everything going?" he asked Bill. Bill responded, with his
voice filled with anguish and disappointment, "This is awful! This is
nothing like the Hell I visited two weeks ago!  I can't believe this
is happening!  What happened to that other place, with the beautiful
beaches, the scantily-clad women playing in the water?!???"

"That was a demo," replied St. Peter.

Yeah, I think you're right.  All I found was the logo and nothing else
except a little tiny icon that, when you click on it, it brings you to a
completely blank page.  Still under construction perhaps?

That's exactly what they were!  Too funny!  Any time I needed a giggle I'd
look up there and watch those girls gyrating with sultry looks on their
faces... too classic!!!

    Shit! ever since I saw Kaysee's original Post, I had been trying to 
remeber and I couldn't until know; thank you!
Bambi, The Jungle Book and The Fox and The Hound were some of my first 
albums. It always tore me up when I heard the part where Bambi's 
mamma died. After that,it was Michael Jackson Madonna and Culture Club.
                                      memories,

>Get this shit: 

I can't help monetarily, but I can definitely commiserate.  Pac Bell is a 
pack of Phone Nazis.  When I moved into this apartment, they informed me 
that there were two lines coming into the apartment.  I said, "Cool, hook 
them both up", thinking I'd then have a computer line and a voice line.  
Well, come to find out there was only one line.  They insisted they hooked 
up two lines.  They explained that, at the junction box, they hooked both 
lines up.  I told them I didn't give a rat's *ss what they did at that box, 
my apartment only had one incoming line.  I felt that since I didn't have 
access to that second line, I shouldn't have to pay for something I didn't 
actually recieve.  Well, no matter who I talked to, they refused to waive 
the fee for the second installation.

Can you believe they broke up Ma Bell so there'd be "competition"?  If there 
was any real competition, Pac Bell wouldn't treat it's customers like this...

As for the 12-mile radius crap, just remember to call the city you're in or 
one that's immediately adjacent and you're usually ok.

Hmmm...I'm not sure which was exactly the first, but the album that I
most vividly remember is Walt Disney's "Winnie the Poo" album. I
couldn't stop playing that one, especially, "I'm Just a Little Black
Rain Cloud."

As far as adult music is concerned, it was the Beatles, "Strawberry
Fields". No wonder I'm a raver nowadays...

I'd like to get a pager.  Just a simple deal, no voice mail yet.  Does
anyone have any suggestions on good companies with good prices, or is that
an oximoron?

Thanks!

Tony

When a company has a monopoly on the market (Pac Bell, TCI, PG&E, 
etc...), the idea of *Good* customer service is completely thrown out the 
window.  They dont have to be nice to you, or cater your every needs, 
because they know that no matter what, they're going to get your hard 
earned money anways.

Heya,

Just saw this blurb on c|net about Apache, the free server software heavily
influenced by your very own sfraves list administrator and Hyperreal

It seems Netscape is jealous....

Monopolies are great, huh?  I talked to someone from Microsoft about a   
problem with a product (that I hadn't registered).  The woman asked for   
my name, and then read off all this information about me for   
confirmation: address, type of computer, etc.  I asked "How do you know   
all this about me?"  Microsoft reps reply: "Resistance is futile."

Be ascared.

I'm sure some of it was astrology but I think you probably met this person 
Greg because he was someone you were supposed to me for whatever the 
reason. 
If you ever get the chance read the book Celestine Prophecy.  It has some 
pretty interesting ideas regarding coincidences.  It goes on to explain how

these coincidences are not coincidences at all but rather meaningful things

that were supposed to happen and with good reason.  I have recently tried 
to open myself up more to the spiritual world through reading and talking 
with other people.  Since then, strange things have happened to me although

I think I always had it in me.  I just didn't really know it was there. 
I've had dreams of the future and of people dying and when I wake up it is 
usually happening or about to happen.  I also have been able to hear people

say things before they say them.  I'm not psychic by any means, but I 
believe we all have this ability, we just have to learn to understand it. 
The aborginal people in Australia  are huge believers of the ability to 
speak without words.  For me, all of these things are connected.  We were 
afterall, roaming spirits who jumped into bodies to come down and enjoy the

pleasures of earth.  It makes perfect sense that there are incidences such 
as the one Erik described where we run into people and feel strange 
connections.  Anyone else care to input?

see the may 1996 issue of Boardwatch magazine (www.boardwatch.com) for one of my all-time favorite covers: billgatus of borg.

I've pretty much decided I want to head to Basics tommorow night...

SO:

I can be recognized quickly and effectively by the black n' white striped
stockings sticking out from under my roomy blue shorts, as well as a shiny
blue shirt with a white collar (soccer shirt material stuff?)... there's
also a relatively recent photo of me on my web page (URL in my .sig file).

There's a bunch of you I've been waiting to meet; say hi!

Question: can anyone hook me up with a ride? I'm still not sure how I'm
getting there...

Hi everyone.  A group of us are going to check out Carlos' bday.  It's 
listed in the calendar if anyone is interested!!  Dubtribe will be 
playing live.  That ought to be cool!!

Anyway, if any of you sfravers venture out to this party, I'll be easy to 
spot tonight.  I'll have on a knee-length silver dress with shoulder straps. 
I will have on VERY silver sneakers that are supposed to glow in the 
dark.  I'm giving these things their trial run tonight, so we'll see if 
they really do glow!!  I'm about 5'4" with brown hair and eyes!.

I shall be dancing wildly, so look for the streak of silver jammin' next 
to you!!

Have fun all of you that are going to Basics.  I bet it will be a blast.  
Sorry to say I won't be in attendance.

Hey all!!

I just saw in the paper that tickets for a Underworld/Orbital show on the
24th are going on sale.  Anyone know anything about this?  It's at the
Fillmore which doesn't seem conducive to dancing but, I don't know.

See ya this weekend,

     first outdoor party. Could some kind soul please send me the info

A little late, but I thought I'd jump on the bandwagon cuz mine is so 
embarrassing.  My first concert was Sean Cassidy, his Born Late tour 
(obviously I wasn't born late enough:).  I was 7 and I had seventh row 
seats, and thought he was the shit.  

In junior high we used to go dancing every friday night at Studio K and 
Cloud 9 at Knott's Berry Farm, to such choons as You Spin Me(Dead or Alive), 
White Lines, When I Hear Music, etc... 

Sure glad raves came along and saved me.

Cheers***
Cami

I love this topic, thanks to whoever started it... it's a trip to see how
different our beginnings can be, isn't it?

OK, first, remember I'M OLD, ok? 

My first memory of an album was my parent's, I was about six, and it was Julie
London, a sultry singer a'la Peggy Lee, and the album had this close-up picture
of her, hair all long, sexy and shiny, cleavage to die for -- and she sang
"Fever" ... you know, "everybody's got the fever, that is something we all know"
...  I LUUUUVVVEED HER!

The first song I ever bought was a '45 single -- I heard it on the radio and
worked hard to find it, even though it wasn't even really released yet ...
called "I Want Candy" with lots of bouncy drums and rhythm.  I think someone
redid it lately, and I still like it.

I'm still a sap for good romantic sultry singers (Cassandra Wilson, Etta James)
and for good rhythms!  Isn't it amazing how clear these things are in our
memories, I can remember sitting in the living room in Tennessee (yes, I'm
originally from the South) dreamily listening to Julie London.

the reconstructed fillmore is one of my favorite "concert" venues, and two
months ago when i saw Bruce Hornsby (joined by Phil Lesh & Bob Weir of the
Grateful Dead) on a Friday and then Lush on the following monday, i thought
it would be a great space for a rave in a perfect world . . .

the dance floor is wood and round, but not that big -- but there will be
people dancing on the carpet, in the halls, etc. i'd imagine 'cause it's
usually crowded . . .

there is a dj booth in the back of the main floor, maybe elevated a step or
two, a little more separation than usual but not a booth upstairs by any
means

the upstairs balcony or the poster/dining room could be great chill spaces

but the key is the trippy purple light chandeliers and mirror ball . . . mmm. .

and the fillmore staff is a lot more chill than many you'll find

free apples still :)

and posters sometimes (chant for black light hopefully)

we'll see if the crowd will spend enough at the bars to make it worthwhile
for them

peace,

Until I hit seventh grade, I would swear on a stack of bibles that music
just wasn't my thing and I didn't like any of it... backlash from my mom's
intense musical interests, I suppose (she now manages a chamber orchestra
in Poland).

Then it was a mess of shit, from MC Hammer to BBD to Metallica (freshman
year headbanger daze =P ). Sophomore year, I discovered ELECTRONIC music.
Skinny Puppy (+ other industrial, none of which could match the power of a
fresh SP track) was my thing until just recently when I discovered jungle
and trance and all kinds of other goodies.

SP still rocks, tho'. Any other industrialist-turned-ravers-but-still-kinda-
industrialists out there?

Thank you, mr. synth inventor man!

It was the Partridge Family for me. I wanted so badly to be just like 
Lori Partridge, she was soooo coool!....and I did become a successful 
keyboardist and published songwriter! I just recently found an old 
Partridge Family album in a thrift store and it brought it all back for 
me while listening to it again. When people ask me about my musical 
influences they usually have to laugh. Seems like the in thing was to 
say the Beatles, Stones, Iggy, Velvet Underground or something like 
that. Nope not me!  ;-)

Yes, I actually had an interesting few days before that (1991?) rave.. which
turned out to have a lot of problems because of some dumb actions by the
LA promoters... in a back-and-forth dance with the Knotts food scientists
over my smart drinks.. They finally approved them for sale when I showed 
them all my toxicology data, and a bunch of stuff on tyrosine being 
useful to help people quit methamphetamine... The Knotts family's son
was actually a raver, and the family are born-again Christians..

It was huge, something like 19,000 people.. but a lot of people crashed 
the gate.. No, I wasn't there....

Something about a Rhythm Society or something to that effect.

BTW - A bit of history.  The first Rhythm Society event that I can recall
was started by Preston and Robert Jesse, back in the good ol days of 1992.

All I know is I had a great times.  Now usually I am ALL about the brew and
boo at a club.  Used to cigarettes odor, used to rude people bumping into
you, I am used to so much "noise" like this at a club, sometime you regret
going out for one reason or another.  Either I'm mad becuase I HAVE to do
the laundry the next day to rid my house of the stench of last night
nicotine bash, or mad becuase I couldn't catch a groove becuase of thisa or
that.  Well, there was NONE of that at the rhythm society, and you know
what.  I had a GREAT time.

Nope I didn't see the blue buddah, but I sure as shit caught a groove, and
listened to some of my friends play some really good music.

I came at about 12:10, and had to chug my beer becuase of guilt about
drinikng booze in the Church (now, for a recovering Roman Catholic this
shoulda been no problem.  Hell, the preists I knew growing up were the
worse sort of drunks I had ever witnessed.  Red nosed bastards.....;) ).
SO I found a dark unlit portion of the street, and began the age old ritual
of chug-a-lugging all my pint before I went in.  Time was critical because
I wanted to hear Sub Commander Lycos rip it up on the dex.

And there he was.  The Sub Commander was doing the do, man...the music my
man put together was fresh, and in general I really liked his style.  He
took his time to choose music and just rocked it.  My man had mf's (can't
curse, it's a church for g-d's sake) jumpin hootin' and hollerin.  People
were groovin' and movin'.  I was so proud of my man for not only making
others dance, but making me dance as well!  I had to get a good buck or two
in for my bro!  Shit was on Commander.  Let's do Flavor on the 29th!  Nice
one!!!

Then an old nemesis went on, one DJ Ethan.  Now, all of you know, if the
shit is above 125, I'm literally dying.  I can at least listen to the
stuff, but for me if the BPM's are too high for me, it is harder to find my
place.  I guess practice makes perfect.  Anyway Ethan did a really good
job.  He got in, adjusted his seatbelt, found his spot, and started to slam
the hell outta the music.  Excellent choices in music!  He went to a house
place and played some harder trance house, and some techno house I beleive.
Anyway I liked it that Ethan slowed down a bit and I could hear where he
was going.  He really had some deep booty beats and really worked the
music.  I saw plenty of people going off...damn crackerjacks ;) (dman and
hell are in the bible, it's ok to say these things :) ).  Good set Ethan,
liked the house touch!

Then an old geezer hit the dex.  I dunno what rock he came out from, but
Markie worked Ehtans last record and stgarted to make mf's get their swirl
on.  Markie was soooo friggin smooth.  Each time I've heard him recently,
he has been spot on and rock solid.  Friggin Markie was ripping it up. It
was impossible not to catch some groove, and the people showed it.
Excellent set!  Friggin Markie, gotta love him!!!  You go boy!!!

I didn't stay for DJ Tracy's set, I wanted to  but I had to go.  Lotsa
stuff to do today like get ready for the UG that is going on (where I'll be
playing).

All in all a great party, no friggin smoke, great vibe, some of the nicest
people I've met in a while, and it was ALL 100% GOOD!!!!

The saints of the church:
Hooked up with Larry Ching, main man from the old skool, way back.  Hey Larry!

Finally, after YEARS, I met Micheal E. Clay!  YO!  We were reminissing and
talking noise about the old days, old fights, going out, etc.  It was
great!  It's so funny the things that people remember, and how people, even
though they disagree, become friends.  I just wish I coulda met you and
others a while back.  But I guess now is as good a time as any.  Right on
Mike!

Already talked about my 3 friends on the dex.

Saw Tracy & Mark...

Met Andrea & Greg out here from Maine, welcome! (Greg <- very nice guy!, is
looking for a roomie, if interested lemme know and I'll  hook ya' up with
the tel#).

The dog, Preston, was in the house, got a chance to re-connect with my man.
Don't need no shouts, cuz' we'll be hangin' out on Sunday....

OH YEAH!!! Hi Lee!  Finally got to meet Janie.  She's a great lady with a
great sense of humor (and she can dance too!).  Lee, you're the bomb, my
man.  It was great talking to you and re-connecting.  I forget often how
you are in real life, and I prefer the real Lee rather than the virtual
one.  Although the similarieites are striking, the real one is so much more
fun!  It was really great seeing you and Janie!  I had a great time talking
dancing and groovin' with you guys!

Hey Monica & Tom!!!  Long time no see!  It was good talking to you and
catching up.  Even if it was near the bathrooms (which remained immaculate
during teh whole show, RIHGT ON!).

Other hokie dokes:  Robert Jesse, I didn't say hi, but I sent some good
vibes your way.  Long time no see, next time I'll make a better effort to
say hello.  In my defense though you hardly stopped dancing.  And rule #1
is "Don't disrespect the dance floor.", so I try not to talk to people
while they are groovin' and you had the good groove on bro, didn't want to
mess that up!

This party was soooo postive, I won't even go into a few of the people who
presented the most horrible violation of my olfactory senses (and by an
informal poll, I was not the only one who took offense).  I say now, and
will always say, bathe before thoust rave, please.  I know it mikght be a a
challenge to some, but in fact what I propose is simple.  1. Turn on the
water to your desired temprature, 2. Fill up the tub, or turn on the
shower, 3. take some soap and rub it all over your body, 4. Rinse, 5. Use a
dry towel and dry off.  See, simple huh?  I really don't know why people
are not aware of their offenses, but oh well.  The vibe of the party
outweighed the stinky vibe 1000:1.

I'm out, anyone I missed?  Will be seeing you around the city tonite.
Lotsa stuff to do this weekend, plenty of parties, Haight Street Crack fair
(I'll be spinning some records somewhere along the street), a UG tonite.
It's all good!

Have a great weekend.  I know I will.

Geoff, THANKS for inviting me!  Props to Ethan's sound system too!  Man it
sounded good!


Peace & audi volkswagen porche 911,
John

For those of y'all into SP (I worship the ground they walk on, personally),
check out Download. Download is the project that Cevin and Dwayne were
working on just before Dwayne's death with Mark Spybey (former Zoviet
France), DJ Philth and occasionally Genesis P. Orridge. Download is THE
future of seriously twisted industrial dance (IMHO)...and on the ambient
wierdness side, Cevin and Mark Spybey have another very cool project called
Dead Voices on Air. Very strange, neat stuff.

I don't know... I've heard a lot of their side projects, but I don't think
any of them have matched the dynamics of cEvin, Dwayne and Ogre working
together, arguments and all. There isn';t much that gives me as much of a
rush as old Puppy tracks like Centre Bullet or Assimilate r23 or
Jackhammer.

But I digress... this is a topic for a whole other 'nother mailing list.

Look for me too!  I'll probably be wearing my SFRaves t-shirt with the old
sfraves logo on it (or my grey tank top if it gets too hot) and jeans.  I'll
most likely have my bright green feather boa too, and I have got more
glow-sticks than you can shake a glow-stick at.  Boy did i go overkill on
the glosticks folks, 20 count 'em *twenty* glowsticks, *six* different
colors (red, green, blue, hot pink, yellow, and white!), and two sizes!

I think a mile is a good distance. The sound crews may want to think about
pointing the sound systems away from camp? This may alleviate sound carrying
problems for those (few?) that don't want to hear the turbo sound blaster 24
hours a day?

condusive to sunbathing? This is one of my alltime favorite dance locations.
I haven't been back since it reopened. I've been waiting for the right
opportunity. This could be it? Have a great night, PEACE!! Cid

I got home from a lovely day to find almost a THIRD of my cds GONE.  from 
the shelf.  nothing else.  and my roomate's friend had been in the 
house.  COINDCIDENCE?

FUCK i'm so angry i could just tear a phone book in HALF!!!  ARRRGH!

sorry.  i just need to rant.  i'm getting the locks changed as soon as 
possible and throwing my roomate out if i don't see at LEAST the money, 
if not the cds.  And calling the cops, in either case.  but that doesn't 
change the fact that they're NOT HERE RIGHT NOW!!!  he even took my 
Grateful Dead, man!!!  what kind of sick bastard would do that to someone??

just been reminded of how precious our microcosm is,

okay ....... and an INSTANT UPDATE!!!

My roommate came home about fifteen minutes after i posted that last 
message.  He has offered to give me his $320 tax return to start to cover 
it.  Since i told him that i would call the cops etc. if nothing happened 
he had not much choice ... also i am getting the locks changed and 
getting keys cut that say DO NOT COPY so he can't ever give one out.  He 
told me he had no idea this might happen and i am inclined to believe him.

He's also going to find out that i am NOT someone to cross lightly.  
Because ... i'm creative. >:)

man, just when you think people in the world are getting better, eh?  it 
amazes me how marvelous the rave community i inhabit really is ...

[ to sfraves mailist ]

 Is anyone going to the Saturday part of the Tibet Freedom Concert at the 
Golden Gate Park Polo Fields? I'll be going Saturday - it'll be the first
time I've gone to the Polo Fields. 

 I'll be leaving a bit early , so I wasn't planning on setting up any 
carpooling. I was wondering if I could get together with other SFRavers
who might be going to Saturday's show.

 See ya !

To everyone on tha list:	

Last weeks question (1st musical experiences) was pretty cool. How about 
this one?

How would you feel about putting up $100 to own part of a parcel of land 
somewhere in Nor-Calif for the specific purpose of having raves?  If 100 
hardcore ravers kicked in $100, that would be $10,000 to go toward the 
purchase of an acre or 2 (in a desolate but beautiful area).

It would be private property so no cops. it would be remote so no noise 
restrictions.  each person who kicked in the $ would be entitled
one free entrance for each $100 they kicked in.  They would get a pass 
that showed how many credits they had.  They could used credits to let 
friends come in to the events.  Example: I kick in $300.  This 
entitles me to free, unrestricted access to the site for myself and 
any other 2 people I want to let in.  For those without the passes 
(those who are not "part-owners") they would have to kick in a nominal 
fee, say $10-$20 for the event.

The shares could also be transferable meaning that others who are 
interested can purchase a share from someone thus entitling them to the 
above mentioned privileges.

I, for one, would kick in $200-$300 so me and my friends could go up to 
some remote, beautiful location maybe once or twice per month and be 
assured of a good time without any worries of having the event be ruined 
by cops or neighbors.  It would kinda be like a Rave Co-Op.

It has just seemed to me that there are so many good people out there 
that want to have a good time and all too often they have to be anxious 
about the vibe.

Well... that's my $.02.  Take it for what it's worth.  It was just an 
idea.

Peace.

hey kiddos-
away from sf for only one little week and boy am i missing it 
already!! but, oh geeeeze, did i ever have a crazy weekend. insane 
amounts of fun!! fri night me and my bro(the true owner of this account) 
went to an incredible GUERRILLA party. the music blew me away. hard  
fast and pounding all night long. YEAH!!!! i have never before danced so 
hard- seven and a half solid hours. leaving the dance floor occassionally 
only to dance my way to the bathroom. the vibe was so crazy- almost 
too intense. by the end of the night i was friends with every other 
dancing maniac. i did miss you guys. the energy level was 
not as high as sf parties. on sat night we went to a massive called 
AMERICANA. very, very massive- like 6000 or so people. it was on a cute 
little island in lake ontario. very nice place to party. i dont 
really know how to describe this rave, but it was so different 
from anything ive ever experienced. it was amazing and exciting and 
thrilling and all that,  but it was very commercial and therefore 
had a few problems. there was absolutely nowhere to fill water bottles 
which is nuts considering there was such a large crowd. i
could go on forever about this party, but im way too tired. in the past 
3 days ive slept a total of 2 hours. when i see you ask me to explain 
why- it's a super crazy little story.

make sure to have extra fun for me in sf.

luv,
sarah

I like the idea. But then money becomes an object and someone has to be in
charge of the money, and it all becomes one big hassle. I think it would be
cool if a bunch of people payed for the land then they could throw one party
so everyone could get their money back and then the parties there would be
free!

J-

no, man... money would not be the object.  the object would be a cool 
place for people to gather and chill to great music and friends.  the 
land would be paid for in cash.  the point would be to have lots of 
parties on this paid for land.  if people can spent $30-$40 for one 
rave, why not $100 to own a piece of land for lots of raves? It would be 
free for those who were part owners.  Non-owners would kick in a $10-$20 
donation.

Peace.

I think this is a good idea, worthy of development.  Does anybody out there
know about real estate? I suppose this would be sort of like a rave
time-share or
something.  Tribal Future has shown what can be accomplished if the right
people own land.  The only problems I can potentially see are


        1) Schedualing parties. Who contrls this, how do we keep the place
           clean and keep it from getting "burned out".

        2) Decision making, with 100 - 200 owners consensus might be hard,
           a standard board of trustees or directors might be needed.

        3) Security, I would think that we would need someone living there
           24-7 to keep vandles and others well meaning party-goers from 
           trashing the place.

Just because it is private property doesn't mean no hassles from the police.
Remember, they have guns and if they want to come in, they will. The police
"break" the law all of the time and are rarely taken to task unless you have
a really good lawyer or a really bad cop. So it really needs to be
remote, sorta in the same way the TF space was, several ,miles down dirt roads,
the police could come in with helicopters but in that part of the country,
flying copters in the dark over people's property may not be such a safe idea :)

This is an interesting idea and one which has been discussed now and then 
here in the northwest . but i do agree with these problems ...

 *snippit!*

        1) Schedualing parties. Who contrls this, how do we keep the place
           clean and keep it from getting "burned out".

        2) Decision making, with 100 - 200 owners consensus might be hard,
           a standard board of trustees or directors might be needed.

        3) Security, I would think that we would need someone living there
           24-7 to keep vandles and others well meaning party-goers from 
           trashing the place.

Can you imagine 100 people all saying well, i am part owner in some 
property here so let's organize a nice ambient party for such and such a 
date, only to find that some of the OTHER people are all planning to hold 
a GREAT BIG MASSIVE on the same date .. who decides?  It would be far 
easier i think if maybe TEN ppl owned the land and then sold shares in it 
..... maybe you could organize a fundraiser to purchase some property?  
hmmmm ..

And yes, private property does NOT mean cops will leave it alone.  If its 
something they feel is illegal in general, it will get shut down 
regardless.  Then you get into big legal battles.

But the idea is worth looking into despite all these difficulties.  I'll 
be interested to see what comes out of this discussion!

I talked to my boss who own a couple of parcels in the E. Bay, and his 
feeling was that in order to get property anywhere near as cheap as 10k 
we would have to look in the Sierra Nevada foothills or the Oakley, 
Grizzly Island area. Personally, having been to both areas, I would 
prefer the foothills. It would seem the best thing to do would 
be to hop in the car and take a look around... anyone down for a drive?

                                            Black Adder

P.S. In case you haven't guessed I think it is a *very* cool idea, but it 
     needs to be handled carefully....

I know this is rather after the fact, for those Tribal Future folks with
poison oak, but here's a hint for the future (NPI).

As a precautionary measure, there is a fine and effective poison oak/ivy
remedy that you use if you think you've had exposure to the dreaded plants.
It's called Tecnu, and is sold at most pharmacy type stores.

You apply it following exposure, let it sit for two minutes and then wash.
It essentially removes the oil from your skin, and *will* save your butt
(or any other part of you ;^) from itching for a couple weeks.  It's most
effective when it's applied prior to any break-out on the skin.

I have hang-gliding friends that swear by it.

Have a good summer folks!!

Tone

P.S.  You probably won't need it at Burning Man...:^)

For those of you looking for a serious early morning workout... I 
ventured into the bowels of 1015 around 2 a.m. Saturday and managed to 
lose about 5 pounds gettin' down to Taj and whoever followed him.  Left 
around 6 a.m. got some breakfast and had a killer Saturday in the 
Haight. Check It Out, you won't regret the trip, people down there 
really want to dance. AND HARD!

 Hi folks -

 Well, I hope I'm not premature about this, but the Computer Help guy
at my workplace just forwarded this alert about a new Macintosh virus
to all the folks in our program. Since he's a very knowledgeable 
Macintosh guru, this may be for real ...

 Larry Ching / larryc@netcom.com
=========== Attached message follows ============== 

Received the following message from  Computer Security:

"Just got word of a new virus called "Open Me."  It looks to be 
a Macintosh control Panel virus.  It hit one of the facilities in 
Denver in a big way.  At this point we don't know where it came from or 
how it spreads but it will destroy a hard disk.  So if you bring up your
Mac and see the message Open Me don't do it."


Received from Dave Ferreira our local expert:

"This is not a hoax.  It appears to be a control panel type of virus 
that can not be detected using SAM or Norton Anti-virus.  The virus/control 
panel wipes out the B-tree or B-catalog or whatever (basically wipes out 
the location of every file on the hard disk)."

Hopefully we won't see this virus here but just in case, be on the look 
out........................Mark

..? if this is all it does (erasing a mac's "Desktop" files.. no problem, 
it will cause slight trouble until you rebuild the disc, but won't 
destroy the disc

Hello all you lovely people,

I don't know about you but sometimes I just feel like fucking screaming my
head off - when this happens I go see a very violent movie (OK, I admit
it, I loved T2, Total Recall etc..) or I go to a very loud obnoxious
party.  

How come Hardcore is so hard to find around here?  Doesn't anybody else
suffer from urban angst and feel the need to freak out at 200bpm?

So here's my idea - we choose a cool event in LA and carpool down there
for the weekend - it's really only a six 1/2 hour drive and we could rage
in LA the day after - 

Whaddya say?

Let's explore the seedier side of Techno...

Awesome book!!!  I think everyone should read it, and _A Bridge Across

re-define my outlook on life in many ways :)

Boo hoo :(  This is really a sad thing.  That was such a cool cafe.  They 
just never had very much business.  If the location was changed, I think 
the business would pick up.  Did they say anything about moving?

	i think a hundred owners definetly have the potential to work 
cooperatively. i know a lot of the UG promoters in SF already do work 
together, help eachother out, and throw parties without conflicting with 
eachother. i feel that when a hundred or so people come together to do 
this, their intentions will be to work together toward a communal 
atmosphere where everyone gets a chance to do something on the site,. 
generally speaking, not to many self interested people would throw in a 
hundred bucks to a communal effort type thing, mostly those who believe 
in it will be the ones forking over teh money, IMO - similar principle 
when a lot of like minded people end up at good vibe parties, just more 
complex.
	the thing with property taxes we would have to realize is that 
teh owners are ultimately responsible, wether teh site raises some money 
or not. also, collecting money from people in connection with the site 
means someone should be getting taxed according to the law, so there may 
be some problems there with police. nothing that cant be solved im sure, 
as i know some promoters do have business lisences, then someone would 
have to do some book keeping though.
	its a damn good idea. just the thought of communal ownership of 
property is great. a lot of people talk about changing the money driven 
culture we live in, but this would definetly be doing something about it.

energy,
tom

This sucks.  I can only imagine that they were not making enough money.  It
seems if they just promoted the place a bit more, they would have done fine.
They should have had a big "come support us night".... I would have gone.
Anyplace that has open dex all the time (except when their are special
DJ's there) should have done well.

Basics Saturday night was absatively posolutely the best way I could have
spent this weekend...

Everything was perfect: the space, the free water, the music (both live and
spun) and the people (hello Sarvi, Jan, Raf, Rebecca, Jon, John, Wayne,
Shawna, Adam, Ian, and all non-SFR people and others who I ran into).

I just wish the chill room was a little chillier... maybe if they had
removed the cieling and a few walls and provided a full moon and some
shooting stars in the cool night sky overhead... =)

I have one question: what was the dj lineup between Astral Matrix and Doc
Martin? There was one guy who played some really nice breakbeat...

Well, my my my that's common sense.

Goood Morning all you  buzzzy busy computer / underground/ white, blue and
tie dyed collar workers....
 'Tis I, Adam, that dancing fool, again with another nutty fun-filled weekend
report of the activites and non-activites for the weekend of June 8
-10th.....


Friday:  After a quick margarita run with an ex-coworker, it was off to Life.
 Carlos was running around like a lil madman smiling and doing random
huggings...  The crowd, young, alot of clubby -type kidz butbo fights. 
Really positive vibe and i rightously logged in a couple of footwork hours in
front of one of the speakers...  The alcohol, however, pulled me down (The
last time I had a drink was over six months ago...) and I curled up in a
corner and napped for a few hours.... 
Waking up to 1979 by Smashing Punkings was fairly interesting as well (Did I
also hear a Cure song? or was I dreaming?) as Carlos was spinning a varied
and oft confisung  (yet enjoyable) set...  Carlos is truly a Mongrel DJ,
crossing cultures ( Ie. that spanish version of Celibartion by Kool and the
Gang) as well as music styles.  Not to mention his adeptness of the
turntables...

Light:     Vibe: 8 Smiles (not too friendly, but tolerable)
           Music: 8 Smiles (No trance, but dancy techno and house)
         Visuals: 9 Smiles (What can I say, gotta love thoses lasers)
Dancing media/ Space: 9 Smiles (Always circulation with that big hole in the
middle of the celing)

Overall  Solid 8.5 Smiles.   Kudos to Carlos....

Saturday:  After a quick Breakfast, some ZZZ's and haircut I kicked it with
the F-8 Family @
the Basics Mapoint.  1000 tix in 4 hours and still a line 'o' people after
they (basics) sold out... I was quite impressed that the Basics crew didn't
choose to sell more tickets and overpack the event, but were, actually
informing ravers of other parties.  Big time respect for that.... @2AM I
decied to check out the underdog instead of basics, So off to down2earth it
was.  Down2earth seems to be a pacific sponsered event, Gailen and crew were
doin the turntable thang.. It was a nice party, not too crowded, same
sunsetish feel, which I love.
Nice VIbe, cool peoples, danced till dawn... (need I say more?)...

Down2Earth:   Vibe :  9 Smiles (Great Sunsetish feel)
                      Music:   8.5 Smiles (A little housey and a bit slow for
my tastes but vibe factor more than compensated for it...)
                     Visuals:  8 Smiles (Nice picts, but after Light, It's
hard to match up...)
Space/ dancing media: 9 Smiles (Great space, lots'o'bouncing around area)

Overall 9.25 Smiles (Prediction: This will be one of THE underground places
2B in the summer, when you get tired of the Massives...)

Sunday:  Well I was too spun out to do much of anything so I lazied around
all day (missed that Haight St faire, sniff, sniff)...  

That's a wrap!  Hope all of yous had a great weekends...   See ya @ the Bahia
tonight (1600 Market).

"dance with me"

  Adam

Oh come off it; cop bashing is such a pointless waste of time. They aren't
lawbreakers or assholes, they're just out there doing unpopular stuff
because there's more to this world than ravers and flower people. I know
there's prick cops, but there's nice cops too (I've run into more than a
few) and it's annoying when people just assume that cops are shitheads just
because they're enforcing laws that (for the most part) have pretty solid
reasoning behind them but aren't perfect.

I'm not "going off" on you, I respect your opinion, but I think
generalizations like this are totally unfair. They just reinforce that
confrontational "me-vs.- the-world" attitude.

I spin Gabber and hardstep/core... All I get is weird looks from my other
techno friends...

I see a few of the SPAZ DJ's spin Gabber... 

And F-8's MARS tosses a Gabber ep or two every great while(ususally no more
than 15Min tho..)

Hmm I guess SF is too laid back to have resident hardcore DJ's(???)...

Greetings..

WOW!!  Things are really coming together with me.   I met this Great girl
Claudia,  we've been working together as a partership for our new company
WebCrunchers...   I might be employed really soon,  details to follow...

Right now though,  back to subject at hand...

Down to Earth - at the small venue on Mission St.    Small,  cosey,  good
vibe,  really good female DJ from Canada ripped the dance area with some
new and refreshing tracks.   The DJ from Boston,  didn't get his name,  was
also GREAT!!   I might have gone to Basics,  but I just don't see how I
could have fun dancing in a hot stuffy smokey venue,   and at least
Down to Earth's venue banned smoking in there.

After Down to Earth,  I headed over to the Bagdad Cafe for breakfast,  then
made my way to Strawberry Sunday afterparty.   WOW!  I was impressed with
the vibe and the music.   Really good trancey house,   lots of excellent
beats.    It was the first time I've been to the Bahia venue.   Excellent
open air space,  high ceilings mean less 2nd hand smoke,   huge air conditioner
forced clean smokefree air into the place.    Only $3 cover charge.   I
highly recommend it...

After that,   I chilled a few hours,  then went over to the Haight St faire,
where I encountered a very strange situation.   This tall dude who I've seen
a lot at raves,   often has his hair tied up in a knot,   wears a shortened
t-shirt that covers only the upper part,  came up to me and said I sold him
bogus vitamen A,  and demanded that I give him $20 or he was going to give me
a choice to either punch me in the face or stomach.   Anyway,  I was luckey
and slipped away from him in the hude crowds.   I saw him again in Ameba,
but don't think he noticed me.    Anyway,  people should watch out for
people like that,   expecially since I don't go selling vitamin A.

I went to another party between Ameba and Galen's party,  which was pumpin
BIG TIME,  but then the music stopped,  and as I left,  I realized why...

Da piggie wiggies were at the door....   I slipped out,  and merged with
the wonderful happy crowd...  then left early to prepare for my big job
interview in SF at 7 pm in Union Square.    I went to my friends place to
clean up and had an excellent dinner and interview with the president of
a leading 3d company (detais pending official offer)...   He was really
impressed,  and it means I can work literally anywhere,  might even
possibly get my OWN T-1 link because I'll need the bandwidth,  but at
least would get ISDN.

Today,  I go looking for my new place...   I'll keep you all informed...

And,  to top it off,   I finally got my personal communications service
fully working and functional,  no thanks to Pac Bell who accidentally
disconnected my 415-381-5847.    It's finally connected again,  tied to
Pac Bell messaging service with paging options so I won't miss as
many calls.

Crunch out..

You want to read a great book?  Mutant Message Down Under.  I lent it to my
friend when she went to Florida and she lent it to her friend so
unfortunately I cannot tell you who the author is.  I'm sure anyone in a
bookstore would know.  It has become a pretty popular book.  It is about a
woman who helps some aboriginal youth in Australia (equal to gang youth in
L.A.) get jobs and get their lives together.  A group of Aboriginals still
traveling in the Outback decide to show their gratitude by taking her on a
walkabout for three months.  It is in the fiction section because it is so
controversial.  She was not allowed to bring anything with her so she was
not able to write anything down.  This is why people doubt her, but as you
read, you can feel in your heart that this woman had an absolutely amazing
experience.  If you ever get the chance and are into sociology you will
enjoy this book.

yup, there definetly are good cops and bad cops. i remember i helped 
throw a party on march 23rd and a cop shows up at the map point a few 
blocks away and catches us selling tickets, thinking were selling drugs. 
so james and i explain to him exactly what is going on, ie. "no officer 
were not dope dealers, were just selling tickets to a party" so he tells 
us that what were doing is illegal, but he didnt want to bust the party, 
saying he had better things to do, just wanted to make sure we wernt 
selling drugs there on teh corner. so with that he left us alone. ive 
seen cops let a lot of underground parties go, as long as there is no 
noise complaints. i know some oakland cops let many parties go even 
*with* noise complaints untill the neighbors got so fed up they had to 
act. so basically, its good to realize that just because someone is a cop 
representing the law which we may not agree with, that cop also will use 
his or her judgment wether to enforce the law. being up front and open 
with the police has enabled many UG parties to continue. its sorta a two 
way thing, cuz there is always those cops who enjoy being shitheads, and 
they almost always do get the final word, lawfully and sometimes not. 
this is turning into a longer post than i planned, basically all you's 
out there doing this sorta thing, use common sence.

lotsa love,
tom

Well this friday the party called Orion should fit your bill. One room 
devoted strictly to hardcore and jungle. info : 415-273-1190 or 916-392-9105.
And if you buy your tickets presale it should be quite affordable...

Has anyone ever heard of a CD by a group called "The Fireman" titled 
"Strawberries Oceans Ships Forrests"?  Came out in '93 on Capital 
Records.  Someone at work brought it in and he says its Paul McCartney 
produced by Youth but the CD has no credits listed.  The copyrights is 
Juggler Music which is, from what I'm told, Paul McCartney's Publishing 
company. 

The disk is really good!!  Slow (100bpm-ish) techno.

Can anyone confirm this???

well, i talked to sifu, the rad owner guy, and he said things were just 
getting too tough.. i don't think the profit margin was very high.. i 
remember them saying they liked the location (i sure did, out of berkeley 
a ways..) so i don't think they wanted to move. they didn't want to 
advertise more either, i don't think.. they liked the quasi-underground 
word-of-mouth thing and the people that came. 

it sucks that your momma's is gone :( but i don't think that the owners 
wanted it saved really. it seemed like they had done what they wanted 
with the place and were now ready to tackle bigger adventures. look for a 
string of sifu & magic circle parties all summer long, starting with "the 
magic circle" this saturday in sf (unfortuantely same time as the new 
moon party..)

respect to those, like merittt, who choose to support the scene and not 
just suck money from the clubkids. lots of luck to him and his crew, 
wherever their adventures may take them.

see you at the new moon, and hopefully the magic circle as well

Finally, a reason to visit L.A. Have you checked out any clubs/hardcore 
parties down there?

  I think it might have been DAN.  I saw on the list that some guy 
called the person who does all Dan's bookings  and she told him that Dan 
was booked for Basics on Sat. so maybe that is who you heard doing those 
phat BBs.

RaVe On!

Interesting idea with a few problems.

Single Owner:	

This person would be volunteering for all liability, taxes, permits (private property 
or no you will probably need permits for anything regular), insurance obligations ( 
any sane major act will not play without coverage) and legal stuff.

Small group: 	

Same problems except now you need a consenceous to get anything done.

California Schedule S Registered Non-Profit: 

This is the only way that makes sense. The $100 investment would become shares of 
stock in privately held not for profit corporation (an arts charity?) The decisions 
would be made by a Board of Directors or Chief Executive elected by the shareholders. 
The advantages of this is that the corp. would be legally liable in the event of an 
incident instead of the shareholders or the board. Since the government is now 
involved it would a requirement to stay completely above board. (i.e. proper papers, 
auditing of funds, taxes, maintaince of the facilities, etc.)

Were talking real work here. Essentially your are suggesting opening a night club 
without the walls. Some one would have to devote major time and effort to this project 
and do it as a part/full time job. Slack off on the details and the property and 
investment will vanish in the wind fairly quickly. 

One last thing, If any member were caught in an illegal activity on the grounds the 
property could be seized under zero-tolerance.

Uh oh, get ready... this is where I show a little age...

The Cars did a *remake* of the song in question.  The song I was referring 
to came out in the early 70's.  And come to think of it, I would have been 
about 8 years old when it came out...  I don't think The Cars did that version.

Anyone know who did the original?

Say man,   get in touch with the Friends and Family people,  like Ethan
or some of the other SFRavers and see if you can get on the lineup.  I'm
sure that these people would be open to hearing some Hard Core.   Also
the Planet Rock promoters (don't recall their Email address,  but they're
on the list).   Or better yet,   get together a sound system,  and a few of
your close friends and put on your OWN parties,  make up the flyers,  and
pass them out.   Just remember to go looking for this older dude with a
grey beard (Me!  :-) and let me have one as well.

>
>I see a few of the SPAZ DJ's spin Gabber...

Yea,   Dave Bayer (From SFRaves) spins Gabber also,  and he spun at a
previous Friends and Family gig.    SAY!!   Speaking of Friends and Family,
when can we expect to see another one.    It's been a while sincewe had
one,   WHAT SAY?    Summer is here....   How about an outdoor one...?

Yea,   faster BPM's in SF just aren't that popular for some reason.

Yeah, Whad up yall--

I had a good time too,  The place just needed a little bit more fresh air.
And too bad they had noise complantes and turned the music down a little
(but it went back up later)...

Met a few sfravers -hi yall- and my dear Sarvi, This whole time you been
readin my mail(maybe you haven't) and I've been talkin to you at parties
and you didn't know I was on this list.  Well hello agian...

Doran kicked ass (me and a few friends got quite a few people jumpin' at
the speakers--yeah, I loved it) and so did Doc, I would love to get a tape
if it was recorded.  Free stuff ws cool since I was in dire need of some
munchies and the people were cool too. I am still sore from dancin'...sorry
guys no chillin' for me at this party, I loved the music toooo much.

Well kidee found it "different" and "more laid back" than the LA parties,
but still had a good time.

I came away thinkin' I wanted some hardcore too.  Is there another MADDNESS
planned soon or a good hardcore party goin on soon?  I would deffinately go
to LA and I know of a few good ones comin up tooo.

Peace and love yall,

Awright, Awright...  (Gets up from computer, blows dust off of CD

"Magic" by Pilot, on Super Hits of the 70's, Vol. 14...  Hmm, produced

momma's, listening to DJ Rich spin some cool jungle . . . it was a positive
space, and maybe that rave-ticket window smashing incident that someone
posted about here 2 months ago or so took its toll . . . i wish the owners
well . . .

Mutant Message From Down Under
Marlo Morgan, HarperCollins, (240p) ISBN 0-06-017192-8

It is in the fiction sectione because she lied and was discovered. Several newspapers 
checked the authors pasport records. She wasn't even in Austraila at the time the 
walkabout 'happened'. This was not an honorable woman.

check http://gnew.gn.apc.org/inquirer/news.html for a copy of the press release.

The world is to damn interesting to have to lie about it.

Perhaps some people might  lease some of the land around the edge of the
property
and live on it.  (They don't get to complain about noise, of course).   That
would
cover some of the carrying costs and help to ensure that the place didn't
get trashed.

I agree with the suggestion that it be a non-profit or not-for-profit entity.
We are not intending it to be a business, after all.

I'm sure there is a way we could make this work.

I don't know them either... I guess I'll just be floating around. Maybe we

I agree with black adder this is a good idea butr has to be handled right,
the main thing that has to be engineered into the deal is how to deal with
conflict and disagreements among the share-holders, land stewards, neighbors,
etc.  It's all good when parties agree, but the test of any venture is how the
whole thing fares when people disagree.  It's been my experiencve that the more
people involved the bigger the problem (which is why the USofA with all its
problems, is still somewhat of a miracle that something this size with this many
points of view hasn't melted down yet, no flames please :) In any event, the
US has a constitution, businesses have contracts, lawyers make money off of
people,
and entitites that disagree, how do we handle disagreement so as to minimize:

        1) Factionalization
        2) Lawsuites
        3) General Nastiness
        4) Control by an Elite

In many respects, having the land owned by a small number of people makes
the most sense logistically speaking (which I guess could be said to be the
Republican view :), that way it is easier to have the 5 - 10 people debate
or vote or whatever and come to a decision.  

Being in business for myself now, I can see how almost everyting in America is
set up to enable business and the flow of commerce, I think it needs to
be a business if only to protect the owners from liability if someone is hurt
on the land.  These are the issues that really have to be thought of if you
want this to be a reality.

Subject: HouseNation (was Question of the week)

Precedence: bulk

A while back a few of us were bantering around a similar concept that 
we were calling the HouseNation. It essentially was to get a parcel of land
in Northern California (more like 200 rather than 2 acres). Were we could build
some form of intentional community as we all grew older.  Part of the idea was
to build the beginnings in CyberSpace (a "virtual site") and then eventually
link the virtual world with the physical place.  This is not to far fetched with
the availability of T1 via satellite and T3 via wireless microwave, one could
have quite a rural cybernetic community with plenty of bandwidth to link it to
the rest of the planet.  I've been musing about what it would take to
"wire" the TF site with a _serious_ internet link (ISDN or greater). My guess
is that the problem is in the "last mile" or local loop.  There is probably
sufficient Telco infrastructure up to a place like willetts but then getting
massive bits out to the boonies would take some form of wireless transmission.
56K is no problem but we're talking 45 - 100 Mbits here :)

Anyway I think is good if the rave community starts to think in this direction,
ultimately if you want to have something lasting you need to have some form of
infrastructure and land (in America at least) is an important component.

To  The List:

I went to my first event on May 31- June 1st (Moontribe's FULL MOON 
GATHERING) In the desert near Barstow.  I went with my best friend Jeff
and his two friends, Kerry and Celine.

I was blown away by the positive vibe there!  Jeff said that the scene 
in Northern California is probably a bit on the more spiritual on chill 
side and that it would probably suit me better.  

I also did E that nite for the 1st time.  So as you can imagine, I had a 
fuckin' GREAT time.  

What I want to know is this:

Is there any kind of scene in the South Bay (S. Jose/ Santa Cruz) or 
Monterey Bay/ Salinas area?  If not, why not?  The area is beautiful 
and significantly more remote than the city (probably fewer noise 
problems).  I know it would mean that some of you city folk would have 
to drive south once in a while but what I've gotten so far from the 
scene is that people don't mind driving long distances if they think 
they will have a good time.  After all, we drove 3 hours to get to 
MOONTRIBE!  It was the shit!

I would be willing to work for free (passing out flyers, making calls, 
etc.) to get more of a scene here in the south.  I know there are 
very good DJ's here in the south that would probably like to have a 
larger home scene.  

Santa Cruz, Monterey, Carmel, Big Sur... these all have a long history 
of being cities that inspire the best in human nature, beauty, 
environmental consciousness, really positive energy all around.

So to any would be promoters out there, how about it? Check out the 
Pinnacles (Near Soledad- It's Fuckin' Beautiful, Man!) How about 
Fremonts Peak, Arroyo Seco, Toro Park, etc. 

If you would like, E-mail me about volunteering, or if you are in the 
south bay and know the scene, drop me a line, I'd love to be part of it 
and help it to grow.

Hasta. PEACE.

-Aaron (That Guy In Santa Cruz)

Well, not quite T-3 but there are a couple of new spread spectrum 
transmitters that are supposed to be pretty spiffy. Internex will be 
bringing one out to Burning Man.

Subject: The Communal Land thing
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com

Here's something to think about.

If about 3 to 5 of the collectives get together as well as the few people
that want to donate the $100 or more, buy a big enough piece of land to have
2-3 parties on it without the conflict of noise from one party to the other,
this would work. One person from each collective and one or two people to
represent the few that donated the $100 bucks or more would be the "Main"
people in charge of the space and as far as any issues that arouse from
having the land. There will be say a $20-$30 dollar charge to get onto the
property if there's say 2 or 3 parties on the land at the same time. For
those who donated they would have a pass to get in for free. Of course if
there is only one party then the price would be lower. People would have a
choice to goto any party they wanted. There would be a main parking area and
if the wanted to go from party to party they would have to walk to each one
or have a communal bus thing going. Whatever money was collected would go
towards up keep and whatever for that land. 

As far as what parties or thrown on any specific dates, there would be a
meeting of the 3 to 5 people from the collectives and the 1 or 2 people
representing all the others that donated and they would vote. With a big
enough space to have 2 or 3 parties far enough from each other so that the
music wouldn't conlfict at any other space, I think it can workout. We also
could have a building or 2 built on the site for when it get into the rainy
seasons. We have alot of resources here on SFRaves, many people with many
talents. People that are in contruction, computers, electricians, doctors,
lawyers and half a dozen other occupations that can help out with anything.
Let utilize these people and make this happen. We can do it if we all get
involve and help in any way we can.

Hi there SF party-goers,

My boyfriend & I will be coming from Sheffield in England to San 
Francisco next week for two weeks. We'll be out and about getting a taste 
of SF's nightlife (and daylife) and would love to meet up with some 
SFravers at techno, hardhouse, drum 'n bass, ambient and other 
clubs/parties. 

Hope to hear from you...
Love Gill.

PS. all information/advice on the best (and cheap!) places to stay in SF 
and surrounding areas would be greatly appreciated!

No, it was Chris Brown from Rampant, aka Brownie from LA.  I talked to DJ 
Dan there, but I know he didn't spin.  He just told Paul (his booking 
agent) that he was playing there so he could hang out and not have to 
spin that night :)

	I know the feeling. I really only get into techno when it has a 4/4
beat and is at least 180bpm, with lots of sampled screams thrown in a big
plus. Since I moved to the bay area I have pretty much given up on hearing
this kind of stuff "live", and I am making do importing gabber from germany
& rotterdam. The LA label Cleopatra (and their sub label Hypnotic) do put out
a few moderately hardcore compilation albums, "Terrortrance" and "Trance Hardcore"
being two of my favorites.

This is for all you tech support people out there...have a laugh.

----------------------------------------------------------------


Caller:         "Hello, is this Tech Support?"

Tech Rep:       "Yes, it is.  How may I help you?"

Caller:         "The cup holder on my PC is broken and I am
                within my  warranty period.  How do I go about getting that
fixed?"

Tech Rep:       "I'm sorry, but did you say a cup holder?"

Caller:         "Yes, it's attached to the front of my computer."

Tech Rep:       "Please excuse me if I seem a bit stumped, it's
                because I am.  Did you receive this as part of a promotional, at
                a trade  show?  How did you get  this cup holder?  Does it have
                any  trademark on it?"

Caller:         "It came with my computer, I don't know anything
                about a  promotional.  It just has '4X' on it."

                At this point the Tech Rep had to mute the caller,
                because he couldn't stand it.  The caller had
                been using the load drawer  of the CD-ROM drive as a
                cup holder, and snapped it off the  drive.

Oops!

No Doubt! It's a tragedy to be inside a party having a Incredible time, 
and not being able to COMPLETELY GO-OFF because your worried about either 
your car, your personal safety (i.e. thuggies wit da' 'tude), or the fact 
that you just threw down 25$ for a party that you fear will git busted...
     
When ALL those factors are eliminated (or the chances greatly reduced), 
you have the ability to feel TRUE freedom, and let go of your cares and 
hang-ups for that moment in time.  You can experience Timelessness...And 
for me, that's what the FEELING of ecstacy it's all about.  The more 
negative things that can be eliminated from an experience/situation, the 
better...especially in times of altered conciousness.
     
The greatest defining factor between a bad trip and a good one is 
surroundings... (Aside from massive excess of course ;)
     
Let's git it on!

Ok everyone, as long as I'm testing your music skills, I have to know where 
to get this particular piece of music.  I hear it at most raves and it makes 
me want to move my body harder than it's capable of.  There's this sound 
like an electric guitar, one stroke, kinda distant.  A pause, then louder, 
two strokes.  Kinda like  wow...WOWWOWWWWwwwwww.....  I *love* this piece!  
It makes me freak!

If someone could tell me who does it, what label, what DJ tapes would have 
it, that sort of thing, I'd be in your debt!

I think I remember Bass saying they were $20 + $39,487,800.46 for the
service charge.  I also heard you can buy them at the Fillmore box office
without the extra charge.  Supposedly the boxoffice is only open on Sunday
for a couple of hours.  I'd call to verify.

Twenty-four smackers.  I haven't acually picked my ticket up from my friend, so I don't know if this is before or after Bass takes its unfair share, but I would think it to be after...

That's a great attitude.  Sometimes DJs, bands, and promoters, SAY they 
can do a gig, but later flake or find something better.  What if YOU were 
throwing a party, people SAID they could make it, and then later changed 
their minds, AFTER you printed flyers.  The people you should be pissed 
at are the promoters like the assholes who throw Plastik that say "All 
DJs are confirmed" the night of the party and then none of the good ones 
show up.  Cosmic and Laetitia are good people, and all of their other 
parties have gone off well.  They really had no control over this...

jonathon-

the $ would be used for paying for misc expenses such as equip rentals 
(music, porta potties, medical supplies, etc.) dj's,food,permits, 
flyers, prmotional costs, prop taxes, etc.

a governing board would be elected by vote (each owner would have an 
equal say).  the $ would be held by a member of the board and deposited 
into the common bank account set up for the "site" expenses.

each owner would only be in $100.  after a few successful events, each 
person would break even and any subsequent events would (hopefully) 
operate at a break even or a nominal profit which would go back into the 
collective fund. 

I know it may seem rather "hippie-ish" to you; all this talk of communal 
sharing and positive energy and idealism, but I truly feel that if 
enough people got together and lived more of their conscious lives 
"as tho they were on E" something special could happen, even if only for 
a short time.

I'd like to be able to look back 10 yrs from now and think to myself...

Hi all!  I'm looking for either for a roommate to get a place, or a room in a
current space.  Communalish living in a house would be optimum.  I'm very
into making home, well, home.  My price range is the tough one, since I'll be
schooling full time I have to try to stay as low as possible, like under
350/mo, preferebly less.  Regarding area:  I have a car, and will get a
motorcycle, my school is on the berkely/oakland border.  I would like to live
close to the school, but would consider living in SF if I found the right
place.  Thanks lots,
Love,
Steveo

evening.  I would like to see a drum circle get going on the porch, (oh my
neighbors love it when I do that), but we'll just play it by ear. (get it? :)
 Probably wont be anything collosal (hopefully) but certainly cozy, nutty and

OK, just a quick cop story. We went to the 11th street block party on Sat
night to try and see George Clinton get *phunky*, (but we got there late).
We stuck around for a few hours dancing in the street to some funky old
disco. Every officer I saw that night was smiling, we dressed up a bit too,
so they kinda had to smile or even laugh at us. Some were even shakin' it
up a bit. I saw folks even lighting up right in front of the police. One
officer motioned to a guy to put it away, others just let it go. It was
pretty cool to groove with the police all around, without feeling any
pressure from them, and with the amount of alcohol consummed by many of the
patrons that night, I'm kinda glad they were there (just in case).

So is this the product of a new Mayor and DA ??  just a thought.

Hi friends,

Marcy and I got our tongues pierced yesterday evening at Body
Manipulations, here in SF. It was kind of a birthday present to each other
(mine: May 11th, hers, June 9th).

Since then we've been on a diet of Advil for the swelling and shakes,
smoothies, soup, and other blendables for a couple days for nutrition.

Tonite we ventured out to Hamburger Mary's and got something resembling
food. It was pretty strange learning to eat again now that we have these
steel bars running through the middle of our tongues.

Marcy was amazed how well I was eating all these mostly-solid foods while
she was having some problems. Then we got home and she realized that she
forgot to take her Advil just before we left. Oops -- huge swollen tongue
error! :-)

We'll see you this weekend at the New Moon party on Saturday night!

-w&m

ps: Thanks to the hundreds of people that sang her 'happy birthday' at
Basics last Saturday night/Sunday morning after the music was over. It was
her three month anniversary of raving and her birthday all at the same
time!

 From my 41-years-old perspective, here's my addition to the "first 
musical experience" thread ... kinda long ...

 No one song , but some scenarios come to mind - in consecutive order
starting from my childhood in Hawaii:

1. My mom had a music box - I don't know what the melody was , but it was
   pretty. I used to listen to it right up to my ear, so I could hear 
   not just the tinkling melody , but also the grinding, whirling and 
   pings of the mechanism. Sort of a proto-industrial/techno experience.

2. Sometimes at the beach, I would float face downwards with my ears
   underwater. Without the distraction of the sun in my face, I could 
   hear more acutely the strange sounds of the ocean . ( I never did 
   this too long , as I was afraid my mom would think I was drowning! ).
   My first experience with "ambient".

3. My dad didn't like rock-n-roll garbage, and he wasn't too keen
   on jazz either, but he loved singers like Nat King Cole, Billie
   Eckstine, Jerry Vale, and Perry Como. Instrumental stuff ran along
   lines like the Herp Alpert and the Tijuana Brass or guitar music. 
   He also had some Hawaiian music. We had a big refrigerator sized
   stereo console that I learned how to use. I would bring my pillow
   and blanket into the living room and load up a stack of records and
   go to sleep on the couch.

4. In the mid-60's, we lived next to a family with three teenage boys, 
   all of whom were into hot rods. Their carport was next to my bedroom .
   During the evenings, as I was drifting off to sleep, they would be 
   tinkering with a new carburator or some damn thing, all the while 
   with a radio tuned to a rock-n-roll station. So, I went to sleep to 
   the music of bands like the Beatles, the Dave Clark Five, the Rolling
   Stones, the Animals, and the Beach Boys.

5. High School: First albums - Rolling Stones "Sticky Fingers", 
   Grateful Dead "American Beauty" , King Crimson "Court Of The Crimson
   King".(Still got 'em.) I am a Deadhead for a few years, but get 
   annoyed with them for actually wasting vinyl to record a narcopletic
   tune called "Row Jimmy Row".

6. College : MC5, Iggy and the Stooges, Velvet Underground, The Who,
   Ramones, New York Dolls, Patti Smith, and European space rock. 
   I walk by someone's dorm room and hear some spacey thick sounds 
   oozing out. He was playing the Hawkwind album "Doremi Fasol Latido". 
   I borrowed it from him - side 1 blew my head clean off. Still does.

7. 1980s : Two Tone ska, Brian Eno, Talking Heads. I have gotten
   over my snit with the Grateful Dead and am listening to them again.
   A guitar player in a punk band who worked at a record store suggested
   that I try out something new - a band named Throbbing Gristle. It may 
   be strange to use the phrase "like a breath of fresh air" in reference
   to this grandfather of industrial bands, but that's what it was like! 
   Breaking past the spell of guitars/drums/synths into strange bold 
   realms of purposeful noise and sampled sounds.

8. 1992 - First rave and first massive - Toon Town's "UFOs Are Real".
   Some first techno - FSOL "Papau New Guinea", Studio X "Los Kings Del
   Mambo".

 That's enough for now !

Hiya SF!

Well, while I had a great visit to the Bay Area this past weekend, I didn't
make it to Basics.  =(  =(  =(   I got to F-8 just as they were selling the
last tickets (around 12:45am). They (F-8) suggested we hang out (elsewhere)
until 2am and see if more tickets showed up but they never did. I went down
to the site, but of course couldn't get in as the place was at or over
capacity. Well, this teaches me a lesson: When attempting to rave in SF,
get tix as soon as they start selling them! My mistake...

A question was posed:

>> I have one question: what was the dj lineup between Astral Matrix and Doc
>> Martin? There was one guy who played some really nice breakbeat...

And -=]madame mercury[=- suggested:

>  I think it might have been DAN.  I saw on the list that some guy
>called the person who does all Dan's bookings  and she told him that Dan
>was booked for Basics on Sat. so maybe that is who you heard doing those
>phat BBs.

Then John corrected:

>No, it was Chris Brown from Rampant, aka Brownie from LA.  I talked to DJ
>Dan there, but I know he didn't spin.  He just told Paul (his booking
>agent) that he was playing there so he could hang out and not have to
>spin that night :)

This is true. It was I who posted that Dan would be spinning at Basics
(information relayed to me from the booking agent's receptionist) but then
Dan's booking agent called me back to my answering machine in Texas to let
me know that Dan was taking the weekend off and would _not_ be spinning at
Basics.

Sorry I missed y'all, but I'll be back soon.  =)

Hugz,

US Court Strikes Down Internet Indecency Law

PHILADELPHIA (Reuter) - A U.S. court ruled Wednesday that a law prohibiting
the distribution of indecent material accessible to children over the
Internet and other online networks was unconstitutional.

``As the most participatory form of mass speech yet developed, the Internet
deserves the highest protection from government intrusion,'' the three-judge
panel said in imposing a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the
statute.

The case involves the Communications Decency Act signed into law by
President Bill Clinton on Feb. 8.

The law punishes the distribution to minors of obscene or indecent material
over the Internet or commerical online services with fines and up to two
years in prison.

The American Civil Liberties Union filed the suit against the Justice
Department the same day the measure became law. The suit was combined with a
separate action undertaken by major online services and software giant
Microsoft Corp.

Opponents say the bill is unconstitutional, unenforceable and would
drastically curtail what they said is the highly democratic nature of speech
in ``cyberspace.''

But the U.S. government said the law was essential to shield children who
have easy access to a growing amount of pornography online.

NEWS

WE WIN!

After 18 months of work, netizens finally got the justice they so
richly deserve.  The three-judge panel in Philadelphia issued a ruling
today saying that they had examined the Communications Decency Act,
learned about the Internet as a medium, and concluded that the law is
an inappropriate method of regulating cyberspace.  This decision
establishes an overwhelmingly positive precedent for the final decision
by the Supreme Court, expected early next year.

The famed "Question Mark" icon that had started popping up all over the
WWW changed simultaneously at 9:09am from a question mark to fireworks,
as thousands of Netizens began the mad rush to obtain a copy of the
court decision celebrating their victory.  You can read a copy of the
decision or obtain a copy of the icon yourself at
http://www.vtw.org/speech/

Senator Feingold (D-WI) said today, "This is welcome news for all of us
who not only support free speech, but who also want to see this new
dynamic communications technology develop safe from the threat of
censorship."

Feingold continued, "This issue is larger than so-called 'adult'
expression or communications.  It is about whether the government will
decide what we see, hear, and write."

Join millions of other netizens as they read the decision, rally, celebrate,
and thank the court for taking the time to do what some members in Congress
and the President would not do: apply the First Amendment.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well I was treated to a wonderful supprise when I arrived at work today.
Last night some joker stole my cd/cassette player from my office.  It even
had a computer lock-down device on it.  My music is the one shred of sanity
I have at work right now, this being our craziest time of the year.  I'm
pretty much over the loss of the radio as material reality, but now I have
no sound.....and that's going to take a little longer. :(

Hey Sanfrandisco heads --

I'm from Colorado and visiting the Bay Area for the weekend, my first 
time out to SF.  =)  

What party would you recommend this weekend?  I was thinking of Second 
Chakra, to see Jeno, Carlos, and Donald Glaude...I'd like to hit a party 
that's full of SF House and that special vibe -- something representative 
of SF parties....I've seen all those guys in the last two months here in 
Colorado, but was thinking it'd be cool to check 'em all at once...What 
are Nexus parties like? 

What about clubs? I'd love to just check out the Sound Factory, but I'd 
like to see Westbam and Jeno at Nikita, which I don't know anything 
about...How is getting into Sound Factory?  is it all guest list?  is 
there a dress code?  sam with Nikita....how is it? what type of 
crowd/atmosphere?

o Stores -- who has the biggest selection of dj tapes? 

any other suggestions for must-visit places/clubs/parties?  I've got job 
interviews on Thursday and Friday and Saturday afternoons and have to 
leave Sunday morning, so, I don't have a *lot* of freetime, so I want to 
sandwhich everything in.....mmmm, tasty sandwich...=) 

Thanks for any guidance...=)

peace and lur....

Hola people!
I'm a recent arrival to the Bay Area and I'm searching for cool
and creative roommates who also happen to dig house & techno music (or is 
that techno house?).  I'd rather live with people who share the same 
aesthetic and aural sensibilities as myself.   It seems that I've relocated at 
a time when occupancy rates in the city are high so if there are any 
persons out there who happen to know of a room to rent or are currently 
seeking a housemate, I'd appreciate any information.  About myself: I'm 28 
and have a BA degree (Barely Adequate) in Eng. Lit. I enjoy the arts and 
thoroughly love dance music more than mere words could express. I'm 
pretty mimimal right now: clothing, computer, car, turntable and records 
are all I schelepped out here from the East Coast, so I just need a decent 
sized room somewhere..
I brought one SL1200, so a household with another would be optimal. 
Otherwise Mr. Visa and I will procur another! I'm looking for housemates 
who like to rage and have fun, but who also are also intelligent, considerate 
and fairly responsible. I'm searching for work right now, but I came out 
here w/ enough funds to get started so I am able to pay rent immediately if 
that's a concern.
You can either email me back or call me at (408) 243-9140. 

Anyway, I've been having a swell time dancing away and checking out the
scene...mad props to those behind Tribal Future, Devine Rhythm Society,
and Down to Earth for some rambunctious fun and solid grooves!!!!!

Is this Basco which I think is done by dj Dan?  (Please correct me if I'm 
wrong.)  Basco is an awesome track.  I fell in love with it the first time 
I heard it because of the guitar samples.  The second time I heard it was 
at Harmony's BP.  If someone knows where to find this track, let me know, 
I'd be most grateful!!

good, used 1200's @ a price range at about $250-350 ea. If you are, or have
anyone that's looking to sell please drop me a line....

Once again I'm taken aback by the flood of responses I get when I email 
you guys!

Thanks for all the replies about what to do this weekend in the bay....

I'm gonna try and hit Second Chakra, I think.....

So anyway, if anyone wants to meet a mtn-raver from Boulder and Denver, 
look for me...<grin> I look like everyone else, but, I'm white, 5'10" or 
so, short dyed blonde hair with brown sideburns and a brown goatee, i 
have a septum ring, tongue ring i play with too much, three ear 
piercings....i'll probably be wearing a white t-shirt, my silver ball 
chain necklace, jeans, and white tennis shoes, maybe a brown "old guy" 
hat (i forget what you call 'em =), and sometimes I wear glasses (if it's 
not too dark =)....i'll try and remember to wear my mtn-raves badge, too, 
if i can find it -- check out what they look like at 
http://www.hyperreal.com/raves/mtn/....(man, i've never committed myself 
to a specific outfit 3 days in advance....eek!)

I look forward to meeting a bunch of sf-ravers, and i'd really like to 
meet people involved with hyperreal, people i know from my old 
FutureCulture email list, or the Leri list, all the net.rave old skool 
(heheheh), anyone at URB (I've been writing the Denver scene reports, 
lately).....

hope everyone's having a good day...
take care...

	It looks like the video portion of the memorial the the Unitarian 
tonight could use more footage of Tim's antics.  If you have any VHS or SVHS 
tapes, or other formats with your own player, it would be appreciated if you'd 
bring them along.

	Just go to the video booth and ask for Craig Larson.

In an emergency, you can also try lemon juice--just squeeze a lemon (or 
lemons) over the affected area, then leave it be. It worked for me.

Yeahhhhh,  I'm down for some hardcore.

My weekend in LA was fantastic and I've been dieing to go back....

Suggestions...
This saturday (yeah its a little close to plan something here but..) in the
deserts of LA (ooohhh noooo not another orgy of kids having fun!!!!)--  I
been told this is gonna be a really good hardcore LA party..

Oasia (Desert) - A Desert Party.  DJs Marusha (Germany), Goa
     Gil (SF), Christopher Lawrence, DJ Lee, Daniel, Thomas Michael,
     DJ Trance, Sparky.

What about a road trip to Organic '96 (San Bernardino Mountains) They have
4 sound systems. One of them is stricktly dedicated to hardcore.  Check the
Socal-raves calendar for details..

Also the 3yr anniversery of Love (one of the parties I went to in LA on my
weekend trip- Comparable to The Gathering parties) is July 13.  3 rooms,
213.917.3215, 714.218.5662

And..
Hardcore Kids Productions (HKP) is doing a party on July 20th which I am
already planning to drive down for this one and to see some friends in
Newport.

 Christopher Lawerence, Thomas Micheal, Brad, Obscure (anyone hear him at
Strawberry sundays last Sunday), Fester, Xavier, and Mojo (the mixed tape
is sic!!!) 213.920.7902

I would be happy to provide transport for some (providing I can get out of
work the weekend of the trip).  Let's get something going....
Get back to all yall later...gotta work.

	If you're still getting new rashes its possible you're getting it off 
clothes or other items which have oil on them.  They should be washed with soap.
PO oil stays active for many months (except on skin, where its absorbed within a 
day -- the rashes are usually not infectious).

Hey gang,

     For all you Southbay folks, there is going to be a FREE party in Hellyer Park in San Jose.  Sunday, June 16th is the date and it will run from Noon til Dusk.  The Djs will be:  Rick Preston, Harry Who?, Ryan Tapia, Tamotsu, Joseph, Mark Johns, Marc Chavez, and Sean.  Come on out and enjoy the sun and some good music.  Bring some happy vibes and a friend and let's get San Jose rockin'!!! 


Hellyer Park San Jose

It would be best to car pool because the park charges a few bucks for parking :(


Peace            Tamotsu

Sitting around with the rest of the Davis based djs having our last mixing 
session (some of us are graduating), we came up with an idea for a way 
for all of us to still get together and spin records, even though we will 
end up scattered across the state. The idea (d)evolved into the:

GREAT CHAIN MIXTAPE SCHEME

1. Record your favorite song onto a high quality 90 min cassette.
2. Write the song title, your name and address of the J-card.
3. Send the tape to 5 djs you know with the instructions:
	"Join the mix tape chain! Play this tape into one of the inputs 
	 your mixer. Copy it onto a second tape of similar quality,
	 mixing in one of your favorite song at the end of the recorded set.
  	 Make 5 copies, adding your name, address, and song title to the
         J-card. If you have filled up the mix tape, send the 5 copies to 
         anyone on the J-card. If there is still room on the tape, send 
         the copies(with these instructions) to 5 djs you know. In 6-8 weeks 
	 you should recieve several thousand mixtapes!"
4. Wait for the mailman. Make sure you have extra batteries for your walkman.

If you are really twisted once you recieve all your tapes get as many 
tape decks and boomboxes as you can and start up all the tapes 
simultaneously. They will all start with your song and then slowly 
shatter into thousand of indivual layers of beatmatched techno confusion.

(Yes, I know that after 25 copies the first couple of songs are going to 
sound pretty crummy. Just think of it as a distorted build.)

I'm not seriously suggesting this but it still would be really neat if it 
worked.

To all those who went to Tribal Future:

You might want to make sure to wash all your clothes, shoes, and
any other article of clothing that you brought with you as they can
still have the dust/oil from the poison oak plants on and in them. I
learned this after I accidently used a roommates towel to dry off 
after taking a shower and got a mild breakout of poison oak even 
though I DID NOT go with him to the beach where he picked it up!!

>From all the excellent reviews I've heard of Tribal Future, I bet the
poison oak was worth it!! I can't wait to go to my first TF and get
a case of poison oak too!

Peace and Love,
John

Good day all,

My name is ---Jason--- and I have been going to parties for almost two
years now.

Syntonic was my first party (thank you BIOJEFF), and it came at a crucial
time in my life.

And to think how much I harped on him when he sold his drums to buy a
coupla 1200's.

The people I encountered there, and have met since, have helped restore my
faith in humankind.

You are truely special  in this world of indifference, apathy and bottom
lines.

Whether you realized it or not, in that moment, your positive energy was
infectious to all around you. 

You have changed people with as little as a smile, or by as much as giving
a ride to a tired and injured raver in the Black Rock Desert.              
                                                          (thanks to the
lovely young woman in the Ford Explorer at the radio station that morning!)

So the next time a jaded raver thinks to himself,  "this" is just another
party, think of those around you, "new", who might be influenced by their
strange and wonderful surroundings.

To them, this may seem a bastion of hope. PROOF! That there is good in the
GROOVE of life.

To all of you I have met in the scene:     YOU are special!

And to everyone I haven't had the pleasure of meeting:    I hope to greet
you all in person                                                          
                             some day. You are a very unique
                                                                           
      and caring people.
                                                                           
      
                                                                           
                                                                           
                                                            Take Care,
                                                                           
                  Jason
  

P.S. This concludes our test of the emergency introduction system. If this
had been an actual
       introduction you would have been able to see what the hell I look
like and give a hug.

Troy and some others have expressed an interest in a product to remove the
oil left behind after contact with poison oak or ivy.
I can definately vouch for the soap:      TECNU ....Oak & Ivy
It works wonders. 


I'll take TF with poison oak over no TF,  anyday.

Thanks to all the beautiful people who made TF such a memorable and special
experience!


                                                                           
  Take Care,

Subject: non-rave...SFSU students question
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com

Hi all!!

I'm attending SFSU this fall and I was wondering if any past or current
students had sugestions as to what classes I should take, interesting
teachers, classes, etc.  Registration starts next week so I was just
wondering.  I am planning on taking only general education classes.  No major
have I yet decided on.  In fact I will probably transfer to the Fashion
Institute of Design and Merchandising next year, so my stay at SFSU will be
short.   Thank you.

         Live,

            Love,
             
             Megan             Czefir

 If the song you guys are talking about has a sample that says 'get 
insane to the bass', then it is Basco (or perhaps Bosco).This was played 
at BP for sure ... It is somewhat of a speaker-tweaker's anthem in LA ...
We hear it there all the time, and everyone loves it.

I am not sure if Basco is the record that is described below, but it kinda sounds like it.  DJ Dan did not make the Basco record, he just spins it.  The artist is actually Basco, and the song is called The Music Is Over (I'm pretty sure thats the name of the song - I have it at home, but I'm at work).  Any DJ vinyl store (Primal in Berkeley, Soundworks in SF, Solid Grooves in San Jose will know EXACTLY which record you are talking about - it has been out for a while now, and it has become really popular (rather overplayed, actually).
But anyhow, happy searching/listening!

Is this Basco which I think is done by dj Dan?  (Please correct me if I'm 
wrong.)  Basco is an awesome track.  I fell in love with it the first time 
I heard it because of the guitar samples.  The second time I heard it was 
at Harmony's BP.  If someone knows where to find this track, let me know, 
I'd be most grateful!!

..We're an anarcho-syndicalist commune.  We take it in turns to act as a 
sort of executive officer of the week, but all the decision of that 
officer have to be ratified, at a special bi-weekly meeting, by a simple

Hello.  This is my first time posting...but desperate needs call for 
desperate measures.  My friend and I really really really want to go to 
Orion in Sacramento on Friday, but neither of us have a car....we usually 
rely on public transportation, but as far as I know that won't cut it for 
this party...anyways, if anyone has room for two people (we're very tiny, 
especially me) in their car, we'll pay for your ticket, gas and tolls (of 
course), and whatever.  We're good company, and we can meet anywhere in the 
bay area that's bart accessible.   

So if anyone is willing and able to do this, if it's possible could you 
let me know sooner rather than later so I can buy the cheaper advance 
tickets? (They go up $5.00 at the door...).  My email address is:

shifty@sfsu.edu   or bridges@soft.com (my work account)

and my phone number is (415) 661-6422

I'd be grateful to anyone who could do this!  Thanks,

Nova.  (Sorry if this is kinda long...)

The Basco track (Basco is the artist, "The Beat is Over" I think is the
track name) is definitely awesome, but I'm not sure it's the track
described...the guitar riff is more complicated, I think (though describing
guitar riffs in ASCII is certainly not easy).  As far as wanting to move
the body harder than it's capable of, tho, it fits the bill pretty well.

This is meant half in jest and half seriously:

Some of you are worse than the government.(perhaps the above was meant 
sarcastically...)

As I said before this issue needs to be handled right, but jeez, we are 
going to have ourselves so mired done in beauracratic procedures and 
by-laws that we are going to need permission from some sub-committee to 
go to the bathroom.  

Hey, this is America, do what everyone else does, buy your votes. $100, 
one vote, simple majority. A couple of people elected and willing to deal 
with some of the day to day affairs, conduct meetings and there you go.

If we did all get together and do this, and it went off *once*, and then 
fell apart for whatever reasons, I would still consider it money well 
spent.

It would be nearly impossible to put into words all the thoughts that kept
me up most of the night after returning from the Timothy Leary Memorial
Celebration.  By recieving the feelings and impressions from those who
knew and were close to him, I was finally able to fully understand what
his death (really just an extension of his life) meant to me.
 
I'll never know the degree to which the Timithoy Leary personna that *I* 
know matches the actual person who bore the name, but perhaps that
doesn't matter.  When a single life's story can embody the complex issues 
of awareness, truth, illusion, courage, hype, absurdity, love, politics,
mysticism, defiance, discovery... such a life becomes a focal point
for the meaning of Life itself.   I now see that the strength of this
notion (for me) in the example of Timothy Leary is that he was so human,
not a simple icon or one-dimensional symbolic hero.  That makes the 
things he represents all that much more real.
 
As far as entheogens go; Tim demonstrated their value as an adjunct
to living and exploring life to it's limits, stretching those limits in
order to learn what it's all about, and why it's all about.  If that's
not spiritual, then I don't know what is.  "Yeah, Why Not?" has already
become a cliche, but it's a pretty good one: positivity in the face of
question.  Such is the nature of all true journeys.
 
Lee

  Mulling over Lee's moving post about the Tim Leary memorial, I started 
thinking back over other legends of the 60s that are still with us, but 
in spirit only:
         Janis Joplin...Jimi Hendrix...Bill Graham...
         Jerry Garcia...Tim Leary..... John Lennon....
  When you're in the midst of a movement, it seems as though it and its most 
visible participants will last forever. Then you hear the news: one more 
gone into eternity. Only then do we start to form a true idea of what they 
meant to us, because now that they are gone their life-stories are complete.
  So I wonder: who in the Rave scene of the 90s will be the Hendrix, the 
Lennon, the Leary of the 2020s?

I like to think that the lack of leaders and focal points in 
rave culture means that raving will evolve indefinately, and be
timeless, rather than a movement that runs a specific course, and
then is forced to make way for something else that seems more
relevant for the times.

My guess it's every single one of us. As I see it, an important aspect of
the rave scene is its lack of long term idols and gurus. Everybody is free
to experience this phenomenon on his/her own terms and in his/her own
context ranging from spirituality to just digging the music. At least
that used to be one of the major attractions to me although the past few
years the introduction of commerce into the scene has caused a lot more
uniformity among the people I meet, the music I hear and the parties I
witness than I appreciate.

you live on this side of the ocean? Thinking of Holland.... ;-)

	Interesting thought, I'd like that too, but you only need to look
	at the big fuss made around Orbital/Chem Bros/The Orb coming
	in SF soon to understand that this thought isn't valid anymore.

	So I don't believe in this flat scene, sorry. Maybe any movement
	just _need_ a leader, a personnality to identify with... Maybe
	is it just impossible to do without.

	Morning opinions,
Renaud

Oh my, Scott Hardkiss was at The Lounge (Sacto) last night and played a
tripped out spacey version of Rocket Man by Elton John, you know ("...And I'm
gonna be Hiiiiigheyii... as a kite by then") it was very nice.  Anyway, my
"thinks all, knows all" friend tells me I better enjoy it because I'll never
hear it again.  I guess Scot made that record and is getting sued for it,
worst of all, it never got to the stores.  Can anyone confirm this, I would
give my left arm and my mother to get a copy.
I think it's gonna be a long long time,
Steveo

You're not kidding, the housing situation really sucks right now.  I'm also
looking for a place, it seems there are a few people on the list right now.
 Perhaps we can all keep our eyes out for a larger place, expanding our
options couldn't hurt.  I'm actually looking for a place in Berkely, but I
would certainly consider SF.

	Hi,

	A DJ friend in France asks me to send him some "typical" american
	Techno... Gloops: I'm not a DJ, and is quite busy without that,
	so the only way for me to fill his request is to ask your help!

	Could some cool people pick 2 or 3 vinyl titles they consider
	Bay Area anthems and send me their titles and where I can find
	them? It would permit me to just jump in the store, ask for 
	them and go to the next...

	Thanks for my friend and the French scene! :)

Hi everybody,

I posted earlier that we are having a New Moon celebration this Saturday.
The number you should call for directions is:  415-267-3076.  

Here's what you should bring to the party:  water, food, something for the
altar, good shoes, warm clothes, sunscreen (if you plan to stay the next
day) and, most important of all, a FLASHLIGHT!!!!  The night will be very
dark - no moon, you see- and you will need a flashlight to get around.
Also, there is no camping allowed at the spot so please do not bring
tents.

Please remember to be respectful of the site.  It would be great if
everyone helped out with keeping the spot clean and litter-free.  If you
smoke cigarettes, please take your butts home with you when you leave. We
will need help cleaning up the spot the next day so please plan to help
out with that.  Our goal is to leave the place in pristine condition,
better than we found it.

-Ann

Dunno if it was "Rocket Man" but there was a Hardkiss Elton John remix out
commercially last year and I saw it all over the place. The only recent
Hardkiss lawsuits I've heard of are rumors regarding the Robbie Hardkiss
mix CD.

I'm inclined to agree here, someone in the past on the list did mention that a 
significant difference between the Dead scene & the rave scene is there is not 
any one person/group of people that everyone else "looks to" in the rave scene as 
there was in the dead scene.  When Jerry died, sure seemed like there were a lot 
of dead-heads metaphorically wandering around scratching their heads with blank 
looks in their eyes wondering what they were gonna do next!  A lot of what made 
the dead scene the dead scene seemed to be having the Grateful Dead as the main 
focal point.  What makes the rave scene is every person who's in the rave scene, 
the scene itself is the focal point.  (we're kind of like a big rave amoeba!)  
The only rave equivalent I can think of to Jerry dying is if suddenly all the 
1200's in the world broke down at once! ;)

Love,
Shawna

That was a threatened lawsuit I'd bet and that's why it was a white label.
They never cleared the sample and all the official releases of the Phoenix
had someone else playing the same guitar part in place of the sample. The
whole flap certainly made those white labels valuable, though.

Check-out any tape from the Universe parties that happened in England 
about three years ago.  Simply blinding techno.  Tapes were on sale at 
Ameba but I don't know if they have any left (probably).

There $20 providing you don't go through Bass (which stands for Bay Area 
Super scumbags) in which case they charge $4.50 per order (each order is 
limmitted to four tickets per order) as well as a $2.50 "covienience fee" 
for ordering by credit card.

Perhapse, but maybe this scene will be more like the 60's then we think.
Leary is a hero/icon but how many 20-somethings really know what he did,
not many (no not because of anything like jaded youth :) because he helped
to create the _context_ within which the House Movement or Rave Scene (which
ever you prefer) was born, if Tim had not did what he did, when he did it, I
think it's safe to say there would be no rave scene as we know it, if at all.
Tim did so much of the initial ground breaking on how to safely take
psychedelics
to the point where we can have large numbers of people dose these days with less
incident then a couple dozen people drunk on booze, Tim was arrested 29 times
in his life, Nixon labled him the most dangerous man in America and set his bail
at $5,000,000 (for possession of two roaches).  Most kids don't realize how
afraid the government was(is) of psychedelics. Leary was special, it was not
like
so poor white-trash or street nigga telling people to turn-on, tune-in and
drop-out.  This was a renegade from the "ruling elite", a Harvard Professor,
a PhD someone with credentials (It has been said in Ol' Boston towne, that the
lad's from MIT make the World run but the lad's from Harvard Run the World :)

Leary demonstrated what some quantum physicist know full well, that reality is
at best consensual and at worst relative to the observer.  Leary was a very
threat to the fabric of the society of the time because once people realize
that they can make that chair in front of them turn into a dragon, that maybe
jusdt maybe the stuff they see on TV isn't any more real then that dragon that
the chair has become, after all in both cases it's just one's brain interpreting
the photon's that are hitting one's eyes and then having a dialog about the
effect.  Maybe the Government is lying to us.  Not many people on a mass level
entertained this though before the 60's. Leary showed us that _we_ could program
_our_ own reality and we didn't need the Government/Media to do it for us, this
pissed  _alot_ of people off.  He paid the price.

One person at the service told a story about a young person (6 or 7 ) who, after
hearing all the co-motion about the Death of Tim Leary say" What did this
man do?
Free the slaves or something?

We'll we're not quite free yet, things are a little better, or are they.
My ansestors worked on a plantation, they had no choice, they worked from sun
up to sun down, Mastah in the big house gave them shelter,food, clothing, 
medical care and some hand me downs, you couldn't leave the plantation
unless Mastah sold you. Today not just black folks have to work on the
Plant(ation)
but we'z all free, Mastah don't own us, we don't work for a barrel of sorgum,
masta (I'mean) the Corporation gives us a little piece of paper called a
paycheck
and we have to find our own shelter, food, clothing, medical care on our own
time
We works from sun-up past sun-down but just like the slaves of old we gits
to party at night just so long as we don't make too much noise and wake up
Mastah (er, I'mmean so that we don't create any noise complaints) But we are
free!


Or are we?

I would love to say that this is an example of the new political 
regime of 
San Francisco but I am afriad to say that it is just a question of 
economics.  SFPD, short in numbers especially on a day like that of a 
free Clinton show, simply do not have the man power to arrest people for 
smoking especially when there could have been an alchohol riot.  Every 
time an individual is arrested at an event such as this it takes two cops 
to do the arresting which takes them off the street and back to station 
leaving the event under-maned.  Owing to a Fedreal law which states there 
must be X number of police to Y number of spectators this would have left 
the event under-maned whith the result that future events like this would 
not be able to be held costing Mayor Willy Brown much needed votes in 
SF's 18-30 community.  Ah the problems of being a democrat!

Sorry if you got this twice, but I don't think the last one went.

I have a chance to spin at a house party for a graduation party type thing
in the South Bay on June 22nd from 3-7pm, but I might not be able to spin
and was wondering if anyone out here was interested. Just email me and I'll
give you the info.

I don't think this is the same thing. Does anybody know for instance the
personal names of any of the people in these bands? Their political views,
personal life? In the rave scene people admire DJ's and performers but
things go out of fashion in a few years. Few of the older records are
still played or remembered by the current generation of ravers and
often DJs are expected to play the latest records. None of the above
mentioned bands present us with a new concept or view of the world, they
just make good music. There have been many others like them and there
will me many more (I hope).

Name one personality in the rave-scene who has a similar influence on
the ravers of today as Timothy Leary had of the people of the 60's/70's.
I can not think of a "leader", only of good artists. Raving is more of
a hedonistic experience to a lot of people than a political, spiritual
thing. I does wonders in our personal lives, our view of the world but
little to the world itself (my opinion). Perhaps that is a more realistic
approach than that of previous generations, start with yourself and the
rest will follow?

The Frying Dutchman

P.s. For DJing friends in Holland I just bought a few mix tapes, many
import record shops in Europe would allow them to buy the records there.
This would allow your friend in France to take his own pick from the
tapes and go after what he likes most?

Hello there all my fellow listies,

Well, I'm back from my two week hiatus from behind the Orange Curtain.
However, it looks like I'm going to be at home (down in SoCal) for most of
this summer, and not up here as originally planned.  So I've got a little
question for you all.  Is anyone aware of any job openings for web
publishing that I can do from home?  I have my own computer, so remote
access isn't a problem.  I've done some web publishing before, but nothing
too extensive.  However, I've got a good grasp of all the basics, I'm a
pretty good graphic artist (with all my own software - Ray Dream, 3Dstudio,
photoshop, painter, etc.), I'm in the process of learning Perl, and I'm
willing to learn Java, SQL, or any other applications relating to Web
Publishing.  If you know of any openings, please let me know.

Thanks, 

Jake

P.S.  I've been working with computers for a while now, and have a lot of
relevant experience (I taught myself C so that I could program continuous
speech recognition on a parallel processor, so I'm pretty good at picking up
computer-related skills quickly).

P.P.S.  And if the employer needs any 4AD rarities taped for them, I can
help with that too :)

Orbital's (Phil & Paul Hartnoll) fairly involved in political and
especially causes - check the liner notes of their new album for details.
The first track was recorded using only solar power for all their gear.

Re:     Re: NRR: Poison Oak answer

Actually, Tec-nu works very well at "pulling" the oil out of the skin after
exposure has
turned into that nasty rash. It might require a few applications though.

It's also recommended that you put some into the wash cycle when cleaning
anything that has
been exposed to the oil....I.E.  clothes, sleeping bags, towels etc.    Or
you can even use it
to clean off camping equipment if it is to be used soon and might have been
contaminated.

Don't forget those sleeping bags people, or the next raver who crashes at
your pad may get
more than just a good nights sleep.

Re:     Re:  Greetings SFraves

Good day Shawna,

I am going to be in the east bay area on Fri-Sat to test my generator
against a friend's band's equip. Need to know if it will handle all their
stuff at full volume.

This should only take the Saturday morning to early afternoon time slot. 

My return to the Sacto area will ultimately be at the hands of Tom, who has
graciously volunteered to drive this time. His only condition being that we
get to a nice beach.

Tom (a "new", and enthusiastic raver) might be persuaded to detour to a
"New Moon" if the 
Tix aren't too much and we can get them on Fri-Sat afternoon.

Please send me any information you have and I'll work on any responsible
thoughts he might
have about this weekend.

Re:     Re: Greetings SFraves

Good day Steve,

I might be back to Sac. in time to catch your BBQ-house party on Saturday.
6pm wasn't it?

But if I can con the person who is driving me to the Bay on Friday into it,
we might go to a
 "New Moon" Saturday evening.

It's all up in the air right now and, no matter where we end up, it should
be a great time.

......If only I could figure out a way to be at all the parties at the same
time...hmmm.......

Re:     Re: Greetings SFraves

Good day Eric,

I will be in the Bay area to test some equipment on Saturday
morning-afternnon. But the length
 of my stay depends entirely on my ride back to Sacramento.

If I can compel him to stay for a party, I will. If not,  I think I'll try
and make it to Steveo's BBQ.

Re:     Re: Greetings SFraves

Good day John,

During the writing of my introduction message, it was impossible to write
anything that wasn't
entirely positive.

I was trying to capture the effect that the people from the rave scene have
had on my life
since I went to my first party. This and to relate a few happenings that
have inspired me to
become, I feel, a better person from their example.

I will be in the Bay to do some equipment testing on Saturday
morning-afternoon. But I think
my ride back to Sacramento will wan't to return home that evening.

If I can persuade him otherwise, and the Tix aren't too much, who knows?

Thank you very much for the ride offer. This is the kind of generosity that
allows the 
transportationally challenged to take part in the spoils that is raving.

If I'll be out on Saturday evening, I'll try and post a message and let you
know. Till then...


                                                            Take Care,

Hi.

I'd say New Moon parties are free, but that wouldn't exactly be accurate.
The New Moon crew puts so much love and energy into their parties, trying
very hard to stand by their belief that nature and music can bring about
love and positive energy, that you can hardly say they are free.  It takes
a lot of muscle and smiles to pull one off.

But in terms of tickets and all that, unless I'm enormously wrong, there's
no need to worry -- they aren't selling tickets to Saturday's party.  It's
free. (I'm sure donations accepted.)

In terms of lending a hand, they can use that very much!!!  I swear, the
more you put into a party, even lugging a speaker, the more you get out of
it.  When you're happy as a raver in paradise, it's *so* nice to be able to
turn to the person you lugged the speaker with and hug and look atthe happy
crowd and say, "we helped make this happen!"

New Moon number is:  415.267.3076

Maybe I'll see you guys there.

Love,
Tone

P.S.  Things to bring to this party:

Flashlight!
blankets/sleeping bags
warm clothes
food to share
alter material
drink
maybe some gasoline (for the generator)?
Fire wood

Yeah! Colourform is one of my favorite electronic albums (right up there
with Autechre, even) ever.  Has anyone ever heard Reform, the mini-lp with
mixes of songs off of Colourform done by other artists (Autechre and Aphex
Twin, among others).  BTW, there's a B-side to Love & Rocket's "Body & Soul"
with a remixed version of it done by HIA that's probably more HIA than L&R
(although Body & Soul is quite a good song on it's own).

Jake,
Who digs Love & Rockets LOTS

  Thought I'd pass this on, Daniel from Moontribe will be playing at Mantra 
  this Sunday at Cats Bar & Grill, 683 Clementina Alley nr. 8th & Folsom.  I 
  know this is listed as a weekly in the sfraves calendar but thought I'd 
  give y'all a shout about this.
  
  Also, I was wondering if any people are going to Oasia in SoCal for 
  Saturday night.  If anyone is interested in carpooling, I might consider 
  going.  E-mail me for more info or check out Goa Gil's web page (who's 
  address I don't have w/me now but you can find it nested in an associate's 
  web page:  http://scitexdv.com/Users/todd/).

Hello everybody!!!

It looks like I might be stopping by Pack-a Bowl tonight.  This will be my
first time and I'm kinda excited.  I'll be wearing dragon tights and yellow
chopsticks in my hair.  That's enough of a description because they do stand
out.  See ya there.

My old phone is now disconnected with no immediate referral.   Instead,  I
got a pager,   so for those SFRafers that know me,  please note my new phone
number.

415-256-7685   - Then punch in your phone number and I'll call you back.

Tommorrow I'll have voice mail on: 415-460-9190 with paging options.

[ to sfraves list ]

 There's a weekly newsprint tabloid in the South Bay called METRO. In this
week's issue is an advert for the Palookaville nightclub. The advert lists
two events with the word "Rave" in the title:

Fri. , June 14th: Beyond Race "Live Rave"
  9PM  All Ages   * Exotic Dance Party
                  * Tribal Gypsy Dance Funk
                  * Snake Goddesses
                  * Belly Dancing                     BRING DRUMS

and -

Tues. , June 18th: The DEEP , Palookaville's Rave
 9:30PM  All Ages


 So, does anyone out there in SFRaves land know anything about these? How
about Palookaville in general ( I've never been there ) ?

For some time now I have been trying to locate a CD/Tape of something 
that I heard on the radio. The track was a techno remix of a classical 
work by the german composer Carl Orff (1895-19xx?), 'Carmina Burana'. 
You might remember the original music from the movie 'Excalabur'. I 
didn't learn who did the remix or what lable it was on. Has anyone seen 
or heard of this?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
My answer:
	You're in luck!  The track you heard is called "O Fortuna" by
Apotheosis.  It came out on Radikal Records around '92.  I've got it on
vinyl, but have also heard it on various techno comps.  Happy Hunting!
peas,
sAbiN!
PS.  They've also released another track called "O Brumbatta", but it sounds
     really similar.

"Live Rave" is not a very good description of Beyond Race, but they're a 
great band, one of my favorites in the bay area.  Fast funky noise you 
can definitely get down to.  Those at the last Burning Man may have heard 
them...they weren't a scheduled attraction but they were out there and 
just set up each night and played for a while out around the eastern 
perimeter.  A drummer, two guys trading off bass, guitar, and a Moog-y 
old keyboard, plus didgeridoo and tabla.  I'll be there Fri.

"The Deep" is Rain Dance's weekly gig that's been going on for a few 
months.  It used to be mostly at the Top of the Wharf (where SCJP is now 
out most Thursday nights), now it's mostly at Palookaville (bigger).  
It's a good party, with a mix of Santa Cruz and greater Bay Area 
DJs...there was an awesome showing by Dubtribe last week.  Palookaville 
is a nice spot: clean, spacious, nice floor, right downtown.  They get in 
a wide variety of acts, punk, funk, blues, rock, folk, all kinds of stuff.

Ok folks.  Sarah (slaymaker) and Shawna and I are starting the ball
rolling for some crazy dancing tomorrow night (friday).... the only
question is where (the drive to sacto is unappealing)! 

Has anyone checked out the 'go fast' weekly on minna st.?  It's against my
better judgement to hit the overly-clubby Nikita when I don't recognize
the dj, but....  (and there's not much else out there in SF on friday!!) 

If you have ideas, or just want to join us ...... lemme know.

otherwise, see y'all at new moon...

I talked to Scott about that track a while ago.

Anyway from my understanding, they were contaracted to do it be E. John.
He didn't like the mix or something to that effect (or mgmt. didn't like
it), and wanted the product shelved.  The Hardkiss boys thought that it
would be a good track to put out however, and so it goes.  It is a very,
very, very rare track indeed.  I could probably scoop one, but the shit is
so high profile that I think It would be invitiing danger to Hardkiss to
let anyone have or spin that track but themselves.

I was not in the loop on this, and the story was told to me a while back,
so I might have a faulty memory on this one.  When I see Scott again, I'll
ask him what the deal was and report if the story is any different.

Out,
John

Ive got a copy on tape somewhere...ill try and find it.  Ive got a friend I
can ask - hes got an original copy (he is in amsterdam, so i couldnt get
you teh song, but could get you the artist).
If i understand correctly whomever remixed it got into copyrights and
wrongs and could no longer sell it.
(incidentally, the track is the beginning and ending of Carmina -'O
Fortuna'  They like to use it (hollywood) for pagan ritual  scenes (it was
in  'young sherlock holmes' too).  Actually its about this guys quest to
get  this cute virgin into bed.

take care

An interesting subject, I should have asked you personally about any "new moons".
Considering your past experience on the topic.

Seriously, I had no idea it was a Goat Rock party along the lines of last year's.
Pancakes and fruit anyone? (pancakes in the lot, or delivered like last year if your good little ravers)

An enchanted place, truely.
I hauled six people from Sacramento out in the van beast...can anyone say 6000 rpm redline...
 
By the way, as soon as I got the info, Tom was raver putty in my hands...."So it's a weekend 
huh?"...I didn't think it would be so easy...His first party was only months ago...

For any SFravers who care to grace us with your presence...I'm the longhaired bloke...or one of
the few attending as such.

ha!  westbam is considered (well, by some..) to be one of the most creative 
german djs, so it should actually be worth checking him out. *i* would

man, after this week i REALLY need the weekend :)

Quick update on my CD woes - my roomie has begun giving me money to pay
off the $500 or so that the cds are worth.  He and his friends have been
trying to find the guy who took em but needless to say he's done a VERY
quick fade.  I thought of calling the cops and insurance co. and 
everything but i don't want to bug insurance for only cds ... i'd rather 
wait until i come home and find my musical equipment gone for something 
like that :)

any vancouver groovers NOT going to future soul (waaah!!)?  let's get 
together and go play on the beach or something this weekend .... or we 
could take over Science World!

This workday cannot end soon enough for me!

Palookaville raves = hippy ravers...if you like them then you're in 
luck.  Personally I would never go, no matter how bored I got @ UCSC

(But that doesn't matter now because I'm back in Oakland and SF is right 
across the bridge.  Summer is here!)

you should bug the insurance people if they are covered.
we had someone walk into our office and walk off with a bag of CD's and had
no problem getting them replaced. so , i duuno. might be cooler than having
your roomie fork out the $$$ (for both of you)

take care

Some comments about the rave scene vs. the 60's scene :

To me, the rave acene as it is happening now embodies many of the ideals
that we associate with 
the so-called 1960's hippie scene : Love , music, drugs, eastern
associations (see : Goa Trance)
Flower children ( check out the some of the rave fasions), spirituality,
shamanism and meditation.

I like the music of Hendrix and the musings of O'Leary but feel that techno
music is the metaphor to embrace as we face a new millenium. More people
should live for the present instead of dwelling in the past.

Finally, as for the question of who is the rave scene's Tim O'Leary ? I
would have to say that this generation already has a psychedelic
spokesperson in the form of one Terence McKenna who has written on and
lectures on the subject of ethno-botany, shaminism, psychedelics and
hallucinogens.

Tim O'Leary : thank you for showing the way.

[ to sfraves list ]

 Looks like a full weekend for me! Saturday is the Tibet Freedom Concert
(Day 1) - I'm especially interested in seeing folk/rock/blues performer
Richie Havens , trip hop/"alternative" artists Cibo Matto, trumpet player
Hugh Masekela , A Tribe Called Quest, and the Beastie Boys! 

 Then , after baking for the afternoon at the Polo Fields, off up north
to the New Moon celebration ( 415-267-3076 ). It's at a spot that I've 
never been to before , but other folks have been to it and like it alot.

 Sunday - drive back down south to my in-laws place in San Carlos for
a shower, a nap, and a Father-in-law's Day get-together. THEN, if I have
enough time and energy, down to San Jose for the free party in Hellyer
Park (Yerba Buena Site) (408-236-3732) , which goes from noon until "dusk".

 Then - go home and collapse!

 ( Some Sunday evening I'll get to MANTRA in SF . "Psychedlic trance" and
   Jungle/drum-n-bass at the same event sounds too good to miss! ).

All of my music is on cd and i would like to play the occasional party.
Does  anyone out there have cd decks and a mixer for sale, or know of where
i can 
pick up such equipment in the San Francisco/Berkeley area ?
And are there any experienced cd Dj's out there who could give objective
advice regarding this form of DJ media.
Prices, phone numbers, contacts, advice appreciated.

If you want to go to a REALLY good party this weekend, check out Orion 
here in Sacramento.  Lots of good hard trance, techno, jungle, and drum 
n' bass DJs will be there, and it's a phat virgin warehouse location in 
downtown Sacramento.  I know this might seem like a long drive, but it's 
really only about 1 1/2 hours or so from just about everywhere, and this 
party will be worth the drive.  If you're tired of all the parties filled 
with gangstas and hoochies and the same 5 boooring DJs who are all really 
good but burned out, come check it out.  As of last night around 6 there 
were over 300 presale tix sold at the Sac location alone, so there's 
going to be a ton of great people there.  Hope to see you all out tonight!

John

I've been playing phone tag with Paul Morris from AM Only Entertainment 
and we both have really busy schedules...  If anyone has his email 
address (I think it's on his business card, but I can't find mine), I 
would greatly appreciate it.  Paul is DJ Dan and Jim Hopkin's booking 
agent and I really need to get a hold of him for a party I'm doing in August.

Thanks,

John

Remember, PLU + Respect, even for daquiri-wielding club kids. Not everybody
who likes daquiris is automatically a dick.

Have I been in the dark or what!

So, does the Tibet Freedom concert cost anything?  If so, what?

Does anyone know what time the Beastie Boys and a Tribe called Quest
willbe playing?

The polo fields at GG Park are really incredible.

I highly recomend checking this out for anyone looking for something this
sunday.  Daniel is one of the infamous moontribe dj's, and was one of my
favorite LA dj's when I was down there.  He used to play more of a
psychedelic house style (his early morning moontribe sets are permenantly
etched in my brain) but I hear he's more of a trance dj these days. Not
really my style, but I'm going to go anyways just cuz it's been so long
since I've heard him spin...

 I don't know if there are any walk-in tickets left, but you can check
the Polo Field Box Office - they are supposed to be selling them for 
$28.50 for one day, $50 for both days. BASS is selling them for that plus
BASS charge.

 There's an article about the concert in today's (friday) S.F. Chronicle.
It has the line-up for both days on page C8, bottom left of page.
Bjork and Red Hot Chili Peppers and other folks appearing Sunday.

 I'm just guessing, but since each day starts at noon and runs till 
5PM or so, ATCQuest will probably be on after 2PM , and Beastie Boys
are supposed to close the show. Bands will be on two stages, so music
will be effectively non-stop.

There will be many members of the FnF crew out helping the New Moon party
on Saturday night. In my opinion, it's my most highly recommended activity
this weekend for sure. It has all the necessary ingredients for a quality
event  -- it's free, outdoors in a *beautiful* setting, put on by your
friends in the underground, highly spiritual, and best of all, it was not
promoted via any four-color foldout promotional flyers or greedy promoters
-- but by your friends, adding music, nature and love.)

See Tony Rotundo and Ann Elizabeth Loraine's previous messages for details
on where to call and what to bring.

pax, man.

	On some levels we are not a flat scene, there are names and some
people still run about thinking that djs or promotors are all knowing
creatures to be idealized. But that is not the case everywhere (and its
not necessarily the case here for that matter, just depends on which
circles you travel through). I know systems which do not promote the names
of djs or live acts and whose "promotors" and physical labours do not go
around making a point of telling everyone that they throw these parties or
those parties...

	Having a flat system depends on the people who come out not 
making a huge fuss over the djs or the promoters as well. They are all 
just people, and in an environment where the energy of a crowd is only 
amplified by a dj, a dj is not some god, but yet another integral part, 
like any of those people who are dancing next to you, looking around, and 
interacting with the world... Flat systems do exist, you just have to 
find them...

Yep that's right a cornocopia of tunage for $20, or a buck a piece.  Mostly

Not worth driving up from SF for, but a steal for any up and coming house
dj's around Sacto.  Eme or call 443 8225.

I work for a very large ins co. and am a licensed agent.  More than 
likely, the homeowner deductible amt will be enough to deter you from 
submitting a claim.  Also, cd's and other recording media are 
sometimes not covered.  Keep in mind that in todays nasty (unfriendly) 
insurance market, it is EXTREMELY difficult to purchase a new insurance 
policy with any of the major insurance carriers (ie. state farm, 
farmers, allstate, aaa, etc.)  If you keep submitting frivelous claims 
(and the ins. co will consider this frivelous!) you run the risk of 
having your policy canceled for loss frequency.

I know it seems unfair, but that is just the way the market is in 
California.  :(

If anyone has any other insurance related questions, I'd be happy to 
discuss them with you.

everyone have a GREAT weekend!

[PEACE}

Hello,

I would like to get a discussion going about the seemingly low number 
of gay men and women I meet at raves. The gay population of San 
Francisco is perported to be anywhere from 20%-30% yet the really 
great rave scene in San Francisco seems mainly straight. Not that 
this is bad, over the past year I have met some really cool people 
and made some good friends, I would just like some of them to be gay.

I had a blast at Tribal Future and Basics, I enjoy Wicked once in a 
while and Burning Man is a must, but why so few fellow gays?

I love the spirit, the music and the energy of raves and wish there 
was a more even mix of people. I believe the time has come for less 
segregation, us gays no longer need to party at gay only places, the 
rave scene is the perfect environment for everyone to enjoy the party 
together.

So what can we do to move things forward and make the scene more 
attractive to gay men and women?

I would love to hear your views.


Love from David

My intro to the scene was at Moontribes Full Moon Gathering 05/31 to 
06/01.

I met DJ Daniel.  He has got the coolest vibe and good karma surrounds 
him.  You just feel it.

His set was THE SHIT!  I even have one of his tapes.  If anyone ever has 
the opportunity to go down to SoCal for a full moon gathering, DO IT!

You won't be sorry.  2000 shiny, happy people in the middle of nowhere
sharing in humanity under the light of the full moon.  It was magical.

[peace]

Wow, presold tickets are probably into the 500's by now, I don't mean to
scare anyone off, but considering what happened at groove trip's last sacto
party (sold out by 11pm), you might want to think twice before driving up
from the city if you don't already have you tix, I found out the location
(real nice but not too huge)  This should be quite a party, if you're going,
look for me, I've got big black baggy cords, with a black tshirt with neon
stripes, I'm white with dark short.med hair, ill have my laminate on!

I've wondered about this a little myself.  I've heard that Spundae is
actually quite mixed and plan to go this week-end.  I'll let you know what
I think.  I'm definately not into the Castro scene, but at the same time
it' would be nice to go to a party or club which is at least somewhat
mixed.  I was in Seattle a couple of weeks ago and there's a new mixed-rave
club there on Fridays called "Electrolush" & I LOVE it!  It's so nice to go
to a club that's TRULY mixed.  I haven't seen anything like it since my
all-ages club days in Seattle (early 80s - before the rave scene).  By my
estimation it's now the hottest club on the west coast.  Maybe with the
right nurturing something similar could develop here, if not Spundae maybe
something else.

I'm not sure what can be done (aside from passing out flyers at Universe &
Club Q etc., to bring more gays into the scene).  I suspect it's just a
matter of creating the right groove which will draw people of all sexual
orientations (or no orientations, as the case may be).

hugs,

David

because the daughter of some SFPD bigwig, moved in next door.  It would be
funny if it didn't happen quite so often.  "daddy, can't you do anything
about all the horrible people in the neighborhood.  if they were all gone,
maybe then we could have a Gap and it would be Perfect".

Sorry, just venting a bit there.  Anyway, my understanding is, despite
Muffy and her unrealistic expectations, they should be back to pumping out
the jams come end of June.

Again, this is really basic info from the people at the Top.

peace....

 I like to know what one can do to support a more mixed scene (other than 
by being gay). I firmly believe that the gay and lesbian community have 
critically important insights to offer society as a whole and that their 
prescence at raves is essiential in order to keep the scene alive and 
growing. I do know that in Santa Cruz we have the Blue Lagoon which is 
normally a gay/lesbian club that churns out some techno/house nights. 
Yet  I've heard grumblings from the patrons about the prescence of 
"breeders" on these nights (the management likes the extra income). My 
complaint is that if the queer community doesn't welcome hetro's (and 
sometimes bi folks) how can they demand to be accepted in return? I 
realise that this is only a few individuals (I hope!) but we need to work 
on both sides to create a more accepting community where NO ONE is 
ostracised.

First, I think the roomie is being *very* cool about this situation.  Sad to 
say, but it's not easy to come by honest, stand-up people...

>If you keep submitting frivelous claims

So let me get this straight: Insurance companies can cancel you for using 
the service you paid for?  Wouldn't that be like a bank closing your account 
and confiscating your money because you made too many withdrawals?

Yeah, I know, you don't have to remind me about how insurance companies make 
their money and how they're continuously ripped off.  I just don't think it 
justifies them ripping us off right back.

INSURANCE = SCAM.

Hi everyone!!

Here's a little request to all that are coming tonite:

If anyone has a lantern, it would be cool if you could bring it!  Also,
if you have any spare gas containers lying around, it would be cool if you
could bring some fuel, as well. 

Once again, be sure to bring a flashlight, water, good shoes, and some
warm clothes, just in case.

Love,

Ann (for the NM collective)

     Many many moons ago the house scene in S.F. began.  I'm not sure how
many of you are aware of this but the only place you could go to hear house
music back them was in gay clubs.  They are all still (the house and techno
fools anyway) very much a part of this scene.  Even if there are not as
many out at parties we must never forget who really brought this scene to
S.F. and give credit where credit is deserved.  I think one of the main
reasons why most gay people don't come out to parties as much, is because
there are gay clubs in the city still playing house music.  I think, in
general, most of them would rather hear music in an atmosphere they feel
comfortable in with people who feel the same.

Ys, it's true, if everyone took every little weeny theft to insurance 
they wouldn't cover us any more.  that's why i'm not taking this one to 
them, and also why i didn't report the loss of my leather jacket to them 
(although i DID contact the cops on that - but that's cos they also had 
my credit card, driver's licence etc.).

And i'm very happy that my roomie is so concerned for me :)  especially 
since he's just some guy i found through the newspaper and he could have 
been just as evil! *whew*

SFRavers, 
 
moonpup is having difficulty getting his email (including past messages). 
Apparently he never got any of them.  What I'm going to have to do is print
each message out and send them to him.  So anyone who would like to say hi
to moonpup in London, should send me (Erik) a message for him at this
address (moonpup@hooked.net) and I will make sure that he gets it via post
mail.  
 
*Please address messages as "moonpup" in the subject.  That way there is no
chance that I will delete any messages for him. 
 
--erik 
 
**IMPORTANT!  READ DISCLAIMER** 
These words were NOT written by moonpup 
He's in London until late August 
 
...and I'm ERIK.  I'll be using his address until then

Hello again,

Interesting feedback so far, perhaps there are more gays at raves 
than I thought, but even so it would be nice to see more. I am going 
to start inviting all my gay friends and all of their gay friends and 
get a whole gays at raves pyramid going.

I love the idea of this mix of people, I don't think we should be 
having to choose whether to go to a "Gay" party or a "Straight" 
party, my friendships are not based on sexual orientation so it 
will be a fabulous party when we can all go out with our friends and no 
matter whether you are straight/gay/lesbian/bi/bi-curious/straight 
curious/gender non-specific/or a-sexual you can party with others 
just like you and celebrate diversity without feeling alone. Utopia 
is right at our fingertips and I want to party there!

Please keep this dicussion going and please invite all your friends 
to join in.

TTFN

David

To All the wonderful people I had the pleasure in meeting whilst in CA the last 
few weeks.

What can I say?  except a HGe thankyou for the love and support that you all 
have given me.

I was a little aprehensive at first about hanging out with you all, mainly as I 
din't want to be a hinderence to you, but after TF alone, I found that my time  
SF and the  people I have met has been one of the most truly invigorating 
experiences in my live so far.

I am now looking say in a couple of years or so, to move out to SF on a 
permanent basis, as I feel that I am more at ease with life over there than 
here. 

In England I am seen as a little different that most people, mainly due to my 
openess and love, and I felt so at peace with myself and was on the same 
wavelength as many of you, something which I haven't felt as yet over here.

I will finish here, as it is extrememly difficult to put down so many emotions 
in one e-mail without getting a little depressed at being back home.

once again,


I may be half way across the world, but SF and all of you that I met will be 
very close in my heart,

Love

Daryll

I know this is an old discussion, but I haven't had the chance to check my
mail in the last couple of weeks and I couldn't pass this one up...

I think the 1st song that made me realize that something was out there was
Nothing to Fear by Depeche Mode - heard it back aroung 6th grade.  It's
kinda wierd - all my life I think I have been into instrumentals more than
vocals. Maybe that's why I like house music so much.

I heard a Jeno tape with a phat remix of voices inside my head by the
police the other day and i was wondering if any one out there knows who
remixed it and if it is available on vinyl???

Any info is greatly appreciated.

Yes it's available on vinyl (I have it) but it came out several months ago
so you may not find it. (but someone might sell you their copy)

Ha!  The first one back to e-mail.... :) :)

New Moon was just as transcendent as I had hoped for..  crystal clear
stars, crashing waves in the morning, happy smiling ravers, lots of love,
and the kicker:  some amazing goa from Tom around 9:30am that totally got
us out of our head (thanks jess!!).  

I'm a little overwhelmed, so I think we'll just head to Sunset and maybe
check out Hardsequncer (again!) at Spundae tonight.  He was great on
friday!! 

Take care, and LOL....the summer has really begun!! (a few days early,
even)... see you at the Solstice!

Pacific Cultural Center events are usually around $5.  I don't know about
the bookstore thing.  And the Cluster show I'm sure will be ticketed by
Bass, since it's at the Maritime Hall, so they should be able to tell you.

Well, it's been a while since I've posted.  For personal reasons I had to 
divert my attention from the rave scene for a while, so when it finally got 
to be too much and I had to let loose, I made sure to pick a place where I 
knew there would be good friends and a good time waiting.  I also had to 
choose carefully since I was bringing a friend that had never raved, and I 
wanted her to meet the coolest people around, my rave buddies.

I was not disappointed.

THE GOOD:  The location was *gorgeous*!  Cliffs, huge rocks, a night so 
clear you could see the Milky Way and bajillions of stars.  Everyone told me 
they saw shooting stars, but I'm afraid I missed them.  I was tuned into 
some very good beats.  I found that dancing in the sand wasn't so bad, but 
putting down some cardboard first makes things a lot easier.  Waves crashing 
down on the beach.  As daylight took over, the huge rocks in the ocean, the 
cliff and the hills behind appeared, grey and mysterious in the mist.  
Rather ethereal and mystical.  There was, I think, about 70 people there?  A 
little alter, a DJ tent, a fire, and so much wonderful vibe.  

THE BAD: First let me say, this location was WAY THE HELL OUT THERE!  Dang, 
folks, surely there's got to be a spot like this a little closer to Frisco.  
Driving up to San Fran is bad enough.  Having to drive another hour and 1/2 
beyond that is HELL.  And that was the *only* thing bad about this rave.  

THE PEOPLE: I knew at least half the people there, and that was a first.  
Rikki was cutting it up with glo sticks.  Wayne was there with Marcy.  
Leslie showed some killer moves.  Tim was doin' the rastah thing on his 
anniversary.  And Shawna was there, with wonderful hugs!  Renaud was there 
with Jess.  Jess was playing it low key -- poor baby has been brutalized by 
finals.  She spent a large part of the evening sitting bundled up by the 
fire and snoozing in her sleeping bag.  Met Aleph.  A very quiet, sweet guy. 
 My friends loved the rave, including the rave virgin.  I think she'll be up 
for trying out more of this wonderful scene.

THE VIBE:  Heck, I met a ton of people, and I got nothing but really, really 
good feelings the whole night.  Big grins, plenty of hugs, chatting with 
good people.  And when I'm getting good feelings, I get tons o' energy.  I 
was kicking around nearly all night long.  Around the fire, in front of the 
DJ, down to the water and back again.  Bopping and grinning...

THE DISCOVERY:  Leslie and I discovered the bones of the elusive Treeasaurus 
on that beach.  The Treeasaurus was the dominant life form during the 
Driftocene era.  We discovered several bones including a tooth.  We 
determined that the Treeasauruses were the greatest lovers of that era.  In 
fact, we determined the the tooth was probably ripped out during a 
particularly intense sexual encounter between two Treeasaurs.  It's a well 
known fact that the Treeasaurs, as they evolved, took sex to it's ultimate, 
slow, funky groove.  In fact, their descendants, the trees, are having sex 
all the time around us, but at this point it goes so slowly we can't see it. 
 One day the entire earth will shudder slightly and all the trees will be 
seen shortly afterwards smoking huge cigarettes...

THE HAMSTAS: I get home to find that the hamstas have cut loose as well.  
Coming up the stairs I passed several bleary eyed hamstas with little rolled 
up sleeping bags and backpacks on their way out.  I go inside and look 
around.  Apparently I left the glass door open and they discovered it.  Of 
course the balcony was the perfect spot for a tiny little new moon rave, so 
they called all their friends (not easy - it takes two of them to work the 
phone) and the lugged all their equipment out onto the balcony.  When I got 
home, there were tiny sleeping bags and tents all over the balcony, two 
little altars decorated with peanuts, sesame seeds, and little bits of 
incense, and a small group of very tired hamstas still bopping in a tight 
group next to the turntables.  A handful of them had scaled the railing and 
were sitting on top of it watching the sun come up, wiggling their pink toes 
and cleaning each other.  It all looked very cozy and cool, so I left them 
to it and went to bed.

Thank you all.

Subject: Orion...so much potential (long)
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

This was a sad story of so much potential, but not the power to pull it off.
We get to the space around 7 pm to set up the ambient room.  There are no
lights in the building.  There is a generator the size of a small pickup
truck sitting infront of the building.  We set up in the dark.  By 9 pm, the
generator is running, and we have lights.  Extension cords running all over
the ceilings, bring power to every corner of the space....all from one big
generator.  They are planning to run three rooms with this generator.  I had
spoken to one of the promoters the day before, and he asked me how much
power does all of our live equipment need to run.  I did not know, but told
him what we had.  Turns out the power needs for the whole show were
underestimated.  The space was great.  Hot, but nice otherwise.  Three
spacious rooms, one big rectangle with a high ceiling, One medium size
rectangle in the center (perfect ambient space), and one odd shaped large
room with occasional pillers.  The space was great, but the owner hasn't had
the power switched on yet for some reason.  So we get the ambient space set
up, and everyone else sets up the other rooms.  RE: C-Lab and Astronout set
up all of thier live equipment, and all is ready to go.  The ambient space
walls are lined with couches and chairs, and the floor is carpeted.  Because
of the length of the speaker wire, the amp rack has to sit out in the middle
of the room.  So we put chairs around it and a fan on top creating a small
island.  It looked quite nice.  It's about 10pm, and people are beginning to
arrive.  Then the Po Po arrive.  "Shut it down", "no party" are the words we
hear.  I begin to meditate trying to bring some peaceful energy into the
space.  The cops leave, and are supposed to come back and do a walk through
to see that there is no alcohol, and nothing is being sold.  The party is
supposed to be a "free" (ya right) going-away party for some people going to
Europe.  Nothing is to be sold at the party.  All water and smart drinks are
free (and they kept that promise :)  The cops don't come, and they don't
call for a really long time.  The decision is made to move the party to an
outdoor location about 45 minutes away.  We break down all of the equipment
in record time, and wait for directions.  After 20 minutes, it is announced
that the cops are on thier way to walk through the space for the original
plan.  The do, and make funny comments about having flash-backs from thier
youth....good sign.  The pary is given the go ahead for the original space.
We set-up all of the equipment in record time (have'nt we done this before?)
The party starts.  

The hard room is just that, hard.  Way to hard, and way to fast for my
taste.  It sounded like that were playing 130 bpm records that are supposed
to be on 33and 1/3, and playing them on 45.  Even stuff with vocals.  I
heard many chipmunk sounding lyrics.  Not into it at all.

The main room was loud with good sound.  The stuff I heard briefly was alot
more housy.  It was cool for the less than five minutes I spent in it.

The ambient room is my headquarters, so I spent most of the time in there.
Here's where everything started to suck royally.  Every 10 minuets or so,
our main power strip would blow out.  We were drawing too much power from
our equipment.  Now for the turntables, this was not too much of a problem,
cuz when the power comes back on, you just push start.  But for live
equipment, this is bad.  Everything is run off of disks.  Songs and sounds
have to be loaded into the machines for them to play.  You can't just turn
them back on and hit start.  Well, we never made it through an entire song
without the power dipping then <bizzzzt> darkness.  This happened about four
times, then they decided to shut down the main room cuz it was drawing like
10,000 watts.  We tried one more song and like clockwork, just when it was
building and getting good, <bizzzzzt> darkness..."FUCK"  We gave up, and
packed up all the equipment.  By the time we were done, the whole party was
cancelled.  

I heard that the promotors were going to throw a free party on Saturday at
the outdoor space mentioned earlier, but I don't know if it happened.  I
feel sorry for everyone involved: promotors, dj's, artists, and guests
because everyone was out something.  The guests all paid money to get in,
I'm sure the promotors lost some money on the party, we had to set up our
equipment twice and never got to play, the dj's had no chance to create any
sort of vibe cuz every the music would zap off every other song.  I guess
the promotors can be blamed for not taking enough in to concideration
beforehand, but I know these people, and they are respectable.  Thier first
party "Synthetic" went off big time many months ago, and "Orion" had all the
potential to top the first one.  I know they personally felt really bad
about the whole thing.  They did give away water and smoothies all night,
which helped with the heat quite a bit.

I'll definately give them another chance, and hope any of you who attended
will as well.

Rick

Okay, I'm probably getting this message in "a little early" but :

It's the summer solstice this Friday but one of my faves The Chemical
Brothers are playing
that night in the Trocadero. Is there any solstice celebrations parties
happening that 
i can join after the show ? Outdoors, of course.

>I'll definately give them another chance, and hope any of you who attended
>will as well.


I'll second that!!  I was in the same boat as Rick on friday in the 
ambient room.  Had all my equiptment set up and ready to play, but never 
got a chance because off all the power problems.  I ended up turning all 
my gear off for fear of power serges.  And it seemed to help the power 
problems out a little. 

 I met some increadible people, and made many friendships that I know 
will last a looooong time!  And even tho the power kept going out, it was 
like nobody really cared.  People started playing drums and eveyone was 
grooving and clapping and dancing in the dark together.  There was a vibe 
there, not your typical 'rave' vibe, but a vibe of 'we're here with a 
bunch of really cool people and we're going to have fun no matter what 
happens'.  For me, it was wonderfull, my first raving experience in 
Sacramento, and I had a better time than I have had at the last couple of 
SF parties I've been to.

I just want to thank Rick and Eric of Re: for inviting me to play with 
them.  Hopefully sometime soon we can do it again.  And the Orion crew 
for giving it their all.  Like Rick said, the potential was there, put 
the Electricity wasnt.

Hi SDream/SFRaves -

 I agree with everything I can remember about SDream's review of the 
New Moon party this last SAturday. Great people and environment - far walk
bwteen parking place and site. But , that distance I believe helped us
from getting busted, so it was all for the good. Dodge those waves! 

 My memory of the night is a bit disjointed, as for many periods I was 
a brown blanket covered lump on a white tarp. I did managed to make myself
useful by starting the fire, also I was the guy passing out chocolate
chip cookies at one point. 

 We must have been meant to be there, because the weather was so kind to
us! I can't complain about the temperature - I should have brought warmer
trousers and a REAL sleeping bag instead of just my army blanket. 

 My thanks to all the great music from the DJs - Can someone post the 
actual names and sequence of DJs? It was nice to hear Jim Cyr (spelling?)
spinn for the first time - nice stuff! 

 I staggered off "early" before 9AM, so I didn't get to hear the Goa set.
Durn! 

 A big THANK YOU to all concerned with the planning and execution of this
party!

No, there doesn't.  You see, maybe Goat Rock is so sacred *because* you
need to struggle first to get there.  The spot that you danced at, had such
a wonderful time at, and discovered your first Treeasaurus at :^), is a
place that just may grown in your heart long after the party.  You will
feel drawn there, like the moon tugging at the tides.

I drove down Rt. 1 from Mendocin, tired, dizzy, slowly (2 1/2 hrs.) ...the
moment I saw "the rock" (from the North, above), I got chills.  As soon as
I saw that there were still cars there, I knew exactly what I would find.
And I found it, dancing, smiling, happy.

>beyond that is HELL.  And that was the *only* thing bad about this rave.

Hmmm...maybe that's not fair, but I'm sure the New Moon collective will
forgive you.  Maybe that party would be so special somewhere else, but I
don't see how.  Anyway, I'm sure ears are open for sacred spots around
Santa Cruz (?) that a butt-load of cars can park over night (over a
weekend!) without getting tickets unless they have outdated registration,
and where we can dance and party to loud music until we decide it's time to
end.

Peace!

well, I'm somehow up and awake so here's more pseudo-review rambling in
the after-glow..... 

Friday.  12:00 noon.  Finish last exam.  Head to a party.  Bored with
            people drinking.  Say bye.  ;) 
         3pm.  On Bart to Bezerkeley to round out my rave closet.
         10pm.  Dash to Nikita with Sarah et al to get in free...! 
Saturday 3am.  Am completely blown away by Hardsequencer and Westbam.
            It's fast.  Creative.  Not too crowded and lots of room to
            dance wildly.  Thomas provides excellent running commentary
            about the latest gossip from the German techno scene. 
         6am.  What?  It's morning?
         6:30am.  EndUp.  Eek!!!
         8am. Decompression time.  Visit farmers market with a beautiful
            friend.  Luxuriate in a succulent apricot.  Sigh...
         3pm??  Still awake, madly making phone calls.  :)
         6pm.  Hmm.  I did something here, but it didn't imprint.. (?)
         8pm.  Assemble gear for the trip to Goat Rock.
         9pm-11pm.  Drive confusedly around the city with Shawna and 
           Tom *trying* to leave.  Finally hit the bridge.  
Sunday   2am. In heaven at New Moon.  AAaaaahhhhhhhhh......  The stars are
           popping out of the sky.  
         10am.  Somehow transcend heaven while sweating and juggling
           to Tom's goa set.  Jess and I break out into a morning aerobics
           routine to make sure we don't get flabby. ;->  Eat half a 
           package of Chips Ahoy for breakfast.
         12 noon?  Leave Goat Rock on a cloud.  
         2pm.  Tom and I have an interminable adventure in a photo shop.
           Emerge dazed and amused.  What?  You can't buy film on the
           west coast? 
         4pm.  Arrive at Sunset.  Wheeeee!  Am somehow not disturbed by
           house music for the first time. The trees are bubbling, Julie! 
           Dance dance dance dance dance pizza dance dance dance.
         9pm.  What?  The sun set already?!?
         11pm.  Hmm...  Hardsequencer... Hmmm....  to Spundae it is!!!
Monday   2am.  Hmm.  Is my body kidding or is it really telling me to 
           fuck off?  Ouch!!!  Hardsequencer is somewhat less inspired
           than on Friday.  Dance wildly.  Smile at everyone.
         3am.  Head hits pillow.  Full stop.

I can't express my bliss properly right now.  The amount of positive,
loving energy I experienced this weekend pretty much blew my mind.  Not to
mention a proper dose of really hard, fast fast fast beats here and there. 
:)

With love and admiration,
Paul

> So , how did this party go? 

It was great!!  A perfect Sunday afternoon in the park.  My housemate and 
I arrived around 2 or so.  There were already about 20 people there.  
There were a couple of footballs and frisbee's being thrown around so we 
joined in on the fun.  Lots of dogs, including two of the cutest and 
smallest chiwawa's (SP?) i've ever seen.  It was a match made in heaven 
for these two dogs.  They were chasing the footballs that were about 
twice their size.  I finnally got to meet fellow Apple employee Tomotsu 
(wussup man!!) .  My roommate and I  brought our bikes and found a couple 
of fun trails in the park.  We ended up at this BMX bike track with jumps 
from hell.  There were a couple of kids on BMX bikes there that were 
jumping at least 10 feet in the air.  A little too crazy for me.  Back at 
the picnick grounds the music was still going when we left at 8pm.

I wanted to see Derick Carter and Quench last night, but when I got home, 
I was so tired I Imediatly fell asleep.  How was it??

Hi Tony,

it was great meeting you at Nikita (my first sfraver encounter!), we talked
about the most diverse set of topics, ranging from antcolonies, neural nets
to Utah while "compiling" in the outdoor chill out. Haven't had a conversation
like that while partying in a while! By the way, Westbam/Hardsequencer rocked
which brings me to my contribution to your top 10:

CU out there or drop me an E-mail when you're going out in the city (although

Damn! I just called somewhere to find out how much there 1200's are and
they said $599.00. Does anyone know where they are cheaper. This place has
low price garantee and will give you 110% of the difference. So if I can
find a cheaper place then I can get a better deal.

Hello again-

 I bought my 1200's from platinum records in Portland, OR.  They were $435 when 
paying by check or credit card, $425 when paying by cash.  I used to live up 
there and I called all over the country to find out what competing prices I 
could find.  Platinum definitely beat most other stores by $25-35 per 1200.  As 
far as the cost of shipping is involved, I picked mine up from the store, but I 
would presume that they would ship for a reasonable cost.  If you have any 
other questions, I'll be happy to answer them.

-Todd

In the dark, there is emptiness.  In emptiness, there is truth.  (I think
that's how it goes)  The truth is as follows:
This party was held at the same place where we enjoyed the last Chrysalis
(sp?).  It was decorated lightly: a few strategically-placed neon posters
and plenty of blacklights in the hall, the chill area being very spartan
(foamy mats on the floor a cool addition; a projection of a huge,
multi-colored. slowly rightward-revolving motion image of something you'd
expect to see under a microscope, as the sometimes-overlapping shapes were
bloblike).  The people at the entrance (both downstairs and upstairs) were
very friendly and welcoming.
The dance floor filled up slowly, and I waited for enough people to get out
there so I'd feel less conspicuous when I danced (silly me).  The floor
never got too crowded, even when the crowd was at max, so there was plenty
of room for people to bust out.  And believe me, they did!  Everyone was
dancing differently, loving the wonderful trance that was happening, and a
few of the dancers were really going wild :)
I saw very few people I knew there, so I spent most of my time dancing,
till I had to chill in the other room.  I hung out mostly with John
Kawamoto (meet this guy!  He's got a beautiful heart) and Matt Lanier
(great to see ya after so long!).  I saw a few people I've met before, but
it was a case of "I'm sorry, but I forgot your name."  "That's OK, because
I forgot yours, too!"  Smiles worked better than any apology :)
There was energy enough on the dance floor, but it was at a medium level;
it never felt that intence.  Still, there was enough to absorb and get
charged for more dancing after feeling that my reserves were dwindling.
Activity in the chill area appeared low to moderate throughout.  A very
cool thing it was to leave stuff in a pile on the floor, go away for a
while, then come back to find everything undisturbed!
Toward the end of the party, I was so drained, etc., that I just hung out
in the chill area, fighting the urge to sleep.  When I finally made it to
my feet again, I returned to the dance area, took a seat, and waited for
the music to coax me out to dance.  More time fighting sleep, while
watching the marvelous dancing of one gal in particular, whose feet were a
blur with hyper-fast moves!  When I felt like I could get up and get down,
the music faded!  It was at that point that John and a friend returned to
dance, and found that it was over, too...we had to laugh :D
We stayed and helped clean up; I picked up half the bottles in the chill
area, and John and I picked up flyers and stuff in the hall.  I hope the
place was left in a decent state.  It didn't appear that anyone had really
abused the space, so maybe we can look forward to more parties in the same
location.
Big thanks to the F-8 crew for giving us another wonderful time!  For some
reason, as soon as I saw the French gal, whose name I don't know because we
haven't really met, I got a feeling that this was gonna be a good one.  I
was not disappointed!

Peace, and hope to see LOTS of y'all next weekend,

- E

haven't seen a review of monolith yet, so i thought i'd post my very first
review ever!

went to free tibet and then puttered around haight for a long time, so we
didn't arrive till around 2:30.  locale was that wonderful space in the
mission where chrysalis was - it's a very personal space, with a partition
that seems designed for setting up dance and chill zones.  party wasn't
crowded - there was plenty of room to move all night, even when surges in
collective energy drew everbody back onto the floor.

smiles were abundant all night, which made me immediately euphoric and
tripped to dance!  my last outing (to the jerald (sp?) deli) had included
an extremely twisted-out, ganstaish guy repeatedly getting in my face, but
from the moment we hit the door i was sure that nothing of that sort was
going to transpire - it was like dipping right back into the positive
energy that carried us out of chrysalis!

because of our late arrival, i think we missed MARS - boo hoo!!!
i think myster-E was spinning when we arrived - excellent commanding
trance which just seized you and demanded to be danced - had to spell
out for water and air several times as i found my heartrate flipping past
to tempo, only to return immediately.  my friend found the amount of
downbeat somewhat excessive, but i say he seized us with those undeniable
beats like voodoo dolls and said, thou shalt dance.

henrik followed, and man did he lay it down!  i must hear him spin again,
and soon - anybody know where he's headed next?

listened to the start of andre lucero's set, but by then we were asleep
with our eyes open and had to split.  all in all, a wonderful evening,
sparsely decorated but with energy and vibe spilling over everywhere. 
some of the optional extras like smart drinks and a second ambient set up
for the chill room would have been nice, but there was something zen about
the minimalism throughout that fit well with the trance spinning - plenty
of headspace for all.

PLEASE do it again soon!
matt.

Just a note of agreement, those sets made the gabber I was familiar with
sound like elevator music.  I can respect that as a type of music with a
purpose, NRG is good, extreme NRG-good too, I just prefer a slightly less
brain splattering form of NRG.  Also I think you need to work a crowd up to
that level of NRG.  Having ones frontal lobe disloged by 200+BPMs as one
walked is rarely the best way to get the peoples on the dance floor.

I was as The Top right after they stopped having djs because of the complaints
... and as Nikki's a few doors down was still blasting their music to a capacity
crowd (hmmmmmmm)  ...

They were just playing dj tapes at The Top that night, and the cops actually
came in and told them to TURN DOWN THE TAPES!!  Clearly, The Top is being
harrassed for some reason, because this was so bizarre, it was not even as loud
as a lot of restaurants play their music, I swear.

If it's really true that some SFPD honcho's kid is the source of these
complaints, you really have to laugh -- I mean, can you imagine moving onto
Haight and Fillmore ... and complaining about anything?  I mean, the block is
like a circus day and night, does she ask her daddy to do something about the
crackheads who follow her down the street?  

Anyway, I for one am looking forward to The Top getting back to dancing!

I agree with David in many ways about what appears to be a
lower-than-might-be-expected number of gays in our scene and I wonder why.

Maybe it's just an illusion....  maybe we just aren't aware of how many ravers
are actually gay or bi, because their sexuality is just not obvious in their
interactions, because (as we've discussed before) ravers are less overtly sexual
in their behavior (especially compared to the cruisy alcohol-fueled club scene).


I know that I meet lots of gay (primarily male) ravers out and about  --perhaps
because of the circles I travel in?  ...though I'm a straight woman, many of my
closest friends are gay men. But I also know that a lot of my gay friends
complain that they see so few gays when they go out (which is why I am the
unofficial president of the Cute Boys Dating Service, yep, you too can sign
up!).

Where are the gay men and women who would be at home in our scene?  Going to gay
clubs for the music fix, but hating the shallow cruisy scene?  Staying home
alone or with friends, rather than feeling out of place when they go out?

One thing about the rave scene is that we are really open to people as
individuals expressing themselves, and the people who belong are attracted by
that freedom to be who they are.  I know there must be a lot of gay men and
women who would be so happy to see what our world is like, who would love the
music and the vibe, and could add a lot of love and diversity to the community.
Same thing for racial and cultural diversity, age diversity, whatever.  

It would be great for each of us to be aware of how we'd all benefit from more
diversity that way, and think about someone we know who gay (or whatever) who
would "get it" and bring them to a party soon.  There's nothing like hearing
someone say (as David's new friend said to me yesteray at Sunset) "I can't
believe how great it is to be somewhere where everyone is so free and happy" and
knowing that another person's life has been improved because of this wonderful
community.

June 30 is Pride Day, and we talked about having a SFR contingent of some sort
in the dance area -- mark your calendars, I'll definitely be there with my crew,
and will post my whereabouts etc ahead of time -- what a great chance to
introduce our vibe to some new people that day!  

Leslie  : )

P.S.    David Ginsburg talked about Electrolush in Seattle as an example of a
really mixed club -- and it definitely is, a big crazy party with club kids and
drag queens and everybody shows up.

But that represents Seattle in general too -- up there, because there are fewer
people and less choices of places to go, people are much better at intermixing
everywhere -- even Neighbors, which is the old-school gay club with cheesy house
music and one of the few after-hours licenses around, is more mixed than most SF
gay dance clubs.  Almost every club there is mixed, men/women, straight/gay.

But I know that lots of the ravers I know wouldn't like Electrolush's dress up,
drink a cocktail, see-and-be-seen energy, not to mention the gangsta element
that hangs there too (I've had a few friends almost meet their maker due to
homophobic encounters there.)

SF certainly has as many mixed scenes here -- our club scene in general is more
active, bigger, crazier -- but maybe not as friendly as Seattle, because it's
just a bigger place here with more people.  Plus I think a lot of gays moved to
SF to have a life where they work, play, live, socialize in a world that is
mostly gay, and they don't have to mix with the judgmental part of the straight
world, and because of the size of the gay communinity, that's possible to do.

Good morning everyones!!!!

I know were all bright eyed and bushy tailed this fantastik Monday
morning.....  

And looky there, Five fun filled days of mindless 8-5 work days lie in the
horizon.  
Yep, & that's not including the teeth gritting mind numbing rush our traffic
to and from your workplace (heh, heh, heh...).


Oh, Im sorry... I tend to be a  few   fries short of a Happy Meal on Mondays.

Anyways,  If anyone had a somewhat OK weekend, it was a hellofa lot better
than mine...

Friday:  Nikita.   For the record - I hate clubs. 
                                                                   Totally
dispise them...  
I did C/U for a while, but even that became a little too glamish...  The main
reason why I dislike clubs so isn't the music (I had a lot of house
exposure), nor the cover , not even the fact that a club is thier to make
money.... The reason why clubs leave a bitter taste in my mouth is the
vibe...  

Very little vibe, in fact.

I think other people had a great time @ Nikita but for me, no.    The music
was good, but it was mainly the same type of euro-techno / trance that Evo
and Cyr have been playing for awhile.  No earth shattering mixes.
And (the most depressing point) every time I asked anyone (fem or male) what
they thought of the music,  I was looked as if I were devising some new
pickup line.
Aside from smiling E-babes and alchoI, I only  lingered a few  hours and took
off.....

Saturday:
Was fun...
 I ran around a few places and said hi to a lot of faces.   Monolith was
saturday nite which I got to 'round 1:15...  The remainder of MARS set was
OKdoing a lot of new and olde tunes that I danced too... But durnig Mystr-E's
set I fell ill with severe nausiea that I traced back to a cheese
quesedia(sp?) , that kept me off the dance floor and hugging a trash can for
roughly 3 hrs...
I left @ 5AM... Im sure Monolith was fab.  I just wasn't there, really...


But, I guess we all have one of THOSE weekends every once and a while......


"Dance with me..."

-Adam

Thanks to New Moon Collective for another great excursion onto unspoiled 
beach, for another gathering + celebration of beauty and insanity, for 
putting all the work into the party, for the wonderful location, far from 
sf, amazing sky and ocean and goat(?) rocks, and stuff.

Thanks to Justin for the ride! not only for me but my 3 rave-virgin 
friends :)

Thanks to all the friendly people that came up and made it all so 
wonderful. It was great to see people from last year's New Moon 
gathering! and meet lots more!

Thanks to Ann and all the others that put it on, sorry i can't remember 
more names...another perfect party!

Although I like the sound here in the Bay Area very much, 
however last weekend no German (or friend of German hardtrance)
had to feel homesick.

Friday: WestBam/Hardsequencer at Nikita really rocked.
Good party, not too crowded, and after Hardsequencer had a
very good set already (12.30-2am) WestBam showed his ability
(2-4am) and blowed me away.

Sunday: Marusha didn't show up at Natoma St., she was sick :(
Thus Hardsequencer was the only German dj there. I liked this 
location and for a sunday night a lot of people showed up.
The djs before Hardsequencer were quite good too. Hardsequencer 
began at 1am and was not as awesome as on Friday, but his set
had its good moments.

This weekend, Paul was like my shadow. 
Everywhere I went to (Nikita, Sunset, Natoma St.), 
Paul was already there with a big smile.  :)


For those guys who missed Hardsequencer and WestBam last weekend:
There's another chance to see Hardsequencer in SF this week.
Flyers say: Wednesday at Wish, 
and Friday at Folsom 1015 again with a 4-hour set (!)

Friday:  went to this very sweet little underground rave.  The vibe was
excellent, smiles all around and friendly familiar faces - it never got
too crowded and there was always plenty of room on the dance floor. The
space was small but tastefully decorated.  The music was excellent: ethan
spun an amazing, upbeat wacky set of my favorite trance.  I danced and had
a great time.  There was free water and food and no bathroom Nazies - All
in all an excellent party......

	Too bad it was just Renaud and Erik and me listening to tapes in
my room - y'all should've been there... :)


Saturday:  New Moon - I was so tired from finals (yes, I'm finished...!)
that I just couldn't catch the vibe on Sat. night.  I was freezing cold (I
think from being so tired) and despite many layers of clothing and a
sleeping bag, I was chilled to the bone all night.  And another thing... I
just can't get into house music - I try and try, but honestly, it doesn't
make me wanna dance.  I felt sort of sad and separate during the night
because there were all these amazing people there and good vibes, and all
I wanted to do was just be in a warm bed.  Anyway, I managed to get some
sleep and woke up just before dawn.  

Renaud and Erik and I went for a gorgeous walk down the beach just as it
started to get light.  We watched seagulls soaring and diving 
into the dark gray water.  The fog was quite
dense and cloaked everything in this beautiful earie light.  The shapes
of the rocks started to emerge and I realized what an incredibly sacred
spot this was.  Back at the rave, we ate some breakfast (always good for
lifting the spirits) and I lay under a very thick blanket watching Tracey
spin for a while - warm for the first time since the evening.  After that,
Tom started spinning a Goa set and I finally got that uncontrollable urge
to dance - that urge that uproots all my physical yearnings for sleep and
rest and plonks me down on the dance floor, not too far from a speaker and
picks up my limbs and makes them move and sway until I'm smiling,
laughing and way, way up there.  For most of Tom's set it was just Erik,
Paul, Renaud and me dancing - this really is my favorite thing - dancing
to excellent music with _lots_ of room to experiment with my body and my
friends nearby.  :)  I got that deep satisfying techno fix that I needed
so badly and felt truly released from the stresses of exams (and very very
warm indeed!)  

After that, the sun started burning off the fog and all of
a sudden it turned into one of the most beautiful days in the history of
the universe.  The water turned from a turbulent grey into a sparkling
greenish alluring blue.  A seal played in the waves right in front of our
home base for a long time.  And then some angel from heaven made us
grilled egg and cheese sandwiches.  I striped down into beach-wear, kicked
off my shoes and lay around in the luxurious sunshine watching people
(still) dancing and remembered to thank god(dess) for allowing me to be on
the planet...

Meant to go to Spundae but collapsed into a deep, dreamless, sunburnt 
sleep instead. I think I've been reborn...

I especially want to thank all of my friends at New Moon (Leslie, SDream,
Paul, Renaud, Erik and others) for reminding me that I don't need to be
the life of the party to be loved.

True story that happened last Friday.  I witnessed half of this story, but
was filled in on the first details later.

A semi high ranking woman "suit" type walks into the office next to the copy
room at my work.  She walks up to the first person she sees in a staff
position and says "make me a copy of this".  Mind you one, this staff person
is not a receptionist, and two, she does not work for the demanding woman.
The staff person says "the copy room is right there" and points to it.
After acting pissed the "suit" storms into the copy room.

Here's where I come in.

I'm walking down the hall toward the copy room and there is a woman standing
in front of the shredder.  She is pondering the machine, and looks like she
doesn't understand it.  She puts her hand near the opening and I think to
myself, 'you better not do that'.  Then she pulls her hand away and proceeds
to  slide her document into the opening.  The shredder grabbs the paper out
of her hand and she jumps back startled by the noise.  She is quite
perplexed at this point then looks around the side of the machine and pulls
out the paper basket of shredded documents and gasps "A SHREDDER!!!!"  She
storms back into the office next door and if furious mumbling something
about that being her only document and she will have to write it over again.
Then she storms off again down the hall past me.

I was mildly amused until I talked to the staff person that she was trying
to order around.  Now I think it's hilarious.  

Be nice to staff people.

Rick

It was packed!  Mark Farina, as always, was the shit.  Derick Carter missed
his flight.  So I believe it was Josh that spun after Mark.  I'd say that
Mark Farina was the high point of the night.

<yawn> 

still way behind on sleep, trying again to adjust to being back in the 9-5
headspace after an incredible weekend..  

after playing phone tag with roger for a very long time, we managed to hook
up and leave berkeley around 8:30, which put us at goat rock just as it was
getting (extremeley) dark.  not many people were there when we showed up,
the fire was just being built and the stars just beginning to poke out.

right away i met lots of folks, i'm bad with names so i won't even try it :)
the site was astoundingly beautiful, i loved being able to take a break
from dancing or fire-gazing (i spent most of the night doing one of the two)
and go watch waves.. the music i liked, but didn't feel too drawn to the 
speakers till tracy came on, which was good because about then i was wishing
i'd brought a few more layers!  

some cool moments:  
 running up and down the beach with glowsticks-on-strings..thanks to whoever
   let me play with theirs :)
 eating a perfectly crisp apple with pete (are you on the list?) 
 seeing everyone's faces as morning happened
 noticing strangers pick up on my afterglowey smile once back in berkeley

the only regret i had is having to leave to make the free tibet show, and
not making it in time to help set up (next time!)

thanks so much to everyone who helped make the experience..

have a great week folks,
 justin

You know, sometimes we need reminders that raving is not only about having fun
(though we all love that part too).  Sometimes it's about something else.

I'd like to thank the New Moon crew for providing a sacred environment for an
amazing night under the stars (at least until the mist/fog came in around 4),
with the ocean and the rocks.  Maureen led a beautiful ceremony to open, that
helped us be aware of what the new moon is about, new beginnings, and to help us
acknowledge what we wanted to create with the night, and with our lives.

To me, the night was similar to the new moon itself, where you can't see what is
happening, but have to trust the cycles of the universe, and know that the
shining moon will return again.

Usually, when my state is altered, I am open to insights and epiphanies that
really change my perceptions in positive ways.  And because I have a lot of
transition in my life right now, I was hoping for that.

But Saturday, I was more introspective, and not fully aware of what was
happening for me.  It was almost like I had stepped into a place where I could
think about what I need to think about, decide what I need to decide, see what I
need to see ... but it's all done one level under your conscious awareness.  I
could feel the gears working, but wasn't sure what the machine was
manufacturing.

I do know that I had a truly magical experience (I met a young woman whose
family lives 2 miles down the road from my family's dairy farm in the middle of
nowhere, Tennessee -- and I mean nowhere -- and she's visiting there next month,
and will visit my mom's grave for me) -- and I know, as we like to say, that
it's all good.

For those of you who haven't made the trek out to this kind of party, try it
next time.  Yes, it's a haul, and yes, it can get hella cold out there ... but
when you are laying on your back watching the milky way slowly move across the
sky and satellites are criss-crossing slowly in different directions, and you're
hearing the most beautiful trance and tribal hypnotic beats,it's totally worth
it.

I don't know anything about these dates or parties, but I have been to 
the Palookaville. I spun there for a halloween party last year. It is 
pretty cool, not spectacular, but pretty cool. (not that this info help 
you with anything, but hey, what am I here for!)

Take care,

Rick-

Thanx for the story!

I'm sure I speak for a lot of staff people (myself included).  

We are underpaid, under-appreciated and under estimated.  Little do
most bosses know, staff people run the show.  Without us *nothing*
would get done.

Peace and WARMFUZZYKARMA to everyone!   :P

	Why is an hour and a half too far to drive? If the spot cannot be 
gotten to via public trans, why not have a party at a beautiful site even 
if you have to go to Tahoe to do it? Especially for what you get, loads 
of people that have all put forth the effort to come together. For 
beaches that will not get busted and can hold a large number of people 
and can park a large number of cars, you will have to go quite aways. 

	There has been a shortage of sites that are usable out there,
especially if you are trying to do a free night party. There have been
people looking in just about every nook and cranny for the last 6 months
that have not been able to turn up an indoor location. Any indoor spot is
going to cost you money, unless you do a breakin which many people aren't
real comfortable with. Outdoor locations are also quite scarce anywhere in
the Bay Area - all of the East Bay is bustable because you are on EBMUD
land, the peninsula has a lot of good locations, but police patrol just
about every inch. The beaches between Santa Cruz and Half moon bay are 
used so much you get hoards of people who drive up and down 1 looking for 
a party with a nitrous tank in the back of their car (and a lot of 
promotor folk are somewhat against tanks of nitrous showing up at a party 
they have worked to put together for various reasons depending on the 
promotor). There are a couple sites which would be nice but getting the 
equipment in and out would be a nightmare (anyone want to give the grassy 
plateau at Fort Funston a try?).

	So why am I ranting? There is whole big separation between 
party-goer and party-organizer and I don't see why that is. The way I 
look at these things is that people are coming to gather and a few people 
have some neat toys and bring those along and get people to play with 
them all night (and the next day and the next night and then maybe it 
will be time to pack up) and people help out in the ways they see fit - 
whether it be building altars, bringing a big watermeloen to share in the 
morning, or moving speaker equipment. That is what I would consider 
community. Look at some of the old full moons when people didn't even 
know how the word got out, but when the moon got full, you started 
calling around and everyone who was going to go out had to do a little 
work and get a little bit of energy flowing just to find out where it 
was, and those parties had a nice feeling to them. Or the Light camping 
party which was a really nice weekend (for which the drive for many was 
over 5 hours) were I spent the daytimes bouncing about the Sierras with 
friends and random people that have since become good friends .
	I think that bashing commerical parties for location is justified,
after all, they are providing a service, which you the party goer have
paid good money to get into and well those promoters owe you...  but a
free party put on by people who care for those who come out is different. 
Then you are just another person on the beach and while you didn't have a 
say in the line-up, you are just as much a "promotor" as those that will 
take the blame if the cops decide to arrest someone, why not treat the 
party as such?

I wouldn't be so blunt, but thought it might be appropriate in case this

i agree with dave on this.  jim and i rode our motorcycles from the city.
it was a cold night.  my thumb was sprained, so every time i used the clutch
hurt.  jim had no gloves; how he could feel the levers at all is a miracle
to me (thank you to the woman who lent him gloves for the way back).  by the
time we got there, we were both in real pain.

and so getting there, to the people and the fire and the music, was like
coming home to a world of subdued bliss.  the long, painful ride separated
the rave from ordinary life.

hello all-

i have an apology to make to those of the sfraves community.

I"M SORRY!  for what, you might ask?  well, i have officially flaked on
the yosemite trip idea that i tried to take over.  life has been
wonderfully busy for quite a while, and i should have realized that before
i attempted to take on a responsibility that was too large for me.

so, I"M SORRY, and i feel rather guilty about flaking on the 20+ people
who were interested.  if there is anybody who wished to pick up the
torch. just ask!

thanks for all your kindness and consideration, and most importantly, your
love.

peace, love, and a little sorrow-

matt l

<<   by your friends, adding music, nature and love.)   {Wayne}

Oh so true!

Last year's New Moon was my first beach party, Tim's first, and an
unforgetable experience
for the other four virgin Ravers I hauled out from Sacto. in the van-beast.

I would like to thank all of the wonderful smiling faces who helped, in
many ways, to make this
weekend's New Moon such a special time for all of us.

Without help from all the ravers attending, we could not have gotten all of
the equipment
"OUT" onto the beach and back again. ( A monumental task, you must agree. )

Greetings to those people I met; and through these ramblings, I hope to
imprint their names
into my cerebrium....      (I'm very bad with names and I want to know you
all)

--Ann--  for returning me to the ocean when all good things must come to an
end
--Maureen-- master of beautiful ceremonies...(sorry about your pretty
candle)
--Justin-- first new sfraver met at the fire, a little cold eh?
--Aleph-- 2nd sfraver encountered, kept me company throughout my war
against sleep
--Larry-- must have had the muchies in mind while bakin' those chocolate
chip cookies
--James-- for being so upbeat, and carting the food stuffs so I could cook
breakfast sunday
--Melanie-- showing up unexpected from sacto. for me to hug
--Leslie-- the hip lady from tribal future with the contagous smile
--Jess-- for thinking me an angel
--Tony-- turning the new moon into a full moon on sunday (anyone get a
picture?)
--Tim-- always willing to wake n' bake with me
--Victoria (?)-- goat cheese and avacado for my eggs....mmmmmmmmm
--anonymous-- brought eggs, cheese, and bread to feed us after the pancakes
ran out
--Biojeff and the rest of our Family-- showed sunday afternoon to spin and
dance with us
--Tom Knight-- patient and overworked driver throughout the long weekend
--Goat Rock Beach rangers-- for leaving us alone in our temporary universe

Sun is rising, "Time to go..."


                                                               Take Care,

Matt L wrote us an apology about dropping the ball on the Yosemite trip ....
_____________

Hey Matt,

On behalf of all of the people who were interested in the Yosemite trip...
(OK, OK I know I can only speak for myself!)  .... please don't feel you've
flaked on us ... cuz the truth is that every single person who said they wanted
to go, but wasn't working with you to make it work, is also responsible for it
not happening....

You know the story of the farmer (oh god, was it a chicken?) who said, who'll
help me plow this field?  and no one offered to help. "who'll help me plant
these seeds?"  no one .... "who'll help me harvest this wheat?"  no one ....
"who'll help me bake this bread?"  then..... "who'll help me eat this bread?"
"I WILL!  I WILL!  I WILL!"

I myself have been feeling like I had slipped on checking in about this, plus
I'm so busy, I couldn't have made it anyway!

I wonder if we should start loooking at a much later date so we can get a great
place with plenty of notice?  (Hey, not that I'm volunteering or anything!)

Leslie  : )

*REALLY*, I don't see what the problem is with someone posting info about 
DJ bookings + records and CDs for sale to these lists.  DJ Hardware is 
cool, and Adrenaline is a respected underground label...  It's not like 
it's someone from Moonshine trying to push Keoki on us :)

...chances are you've enhanced the quality of my life in some way, whether
actively or passively, even if it was only in some positive vibes that
wandered my way.  And because of this, I just wanted to say:

THANK YOU VERY MUCH!!!

Love, hugz, & smiles,

my 2 c...

i have trip hop acid phunk2
and now that i know its being released
i'll prolly pick up #3 

not because i want to promote the commercialization of electronic music or
the scene that has revolved around it

but because i love the music....
 i love it loud....
i have a system that can play it loud...
y'know to eleven...

but i sure cant do that when i buy a mixtape dubbed off another mixtape that
was dubbed off some guy who likes to rip off djs and tape there sets at
parties....

basically when you got it digital
y'know its good quality...sound that is...music selection well thats a
risk...and as someone posted at least its not keoki....:)



peace and parsley

from our FLUX headline news (www.flux.net): 

Perry Farrell's ENIT Festival is getting rolling for summer. Call (212) 
330-9134 to hear the current lineup recited by Perry himself - Black
Grape, Love and Rockets, Farrell's own Porno for Pyros, and Lady Miss Kier
(Deee-Lite). Rumor has it the tour will feature top UK DJs in each city
like Carl Cox and Andy Weatherall. Exact tour dates are as yet
unannounced.

Many will remember last year's uneven San Francisco ENIT fest included
DJ/performances from
Sven Vath, Moby, Tracy Lords, DJ Spooky, Freaky Chakra and Single Cell
Orchestra. Hmmm...

There was limited response to the Rave Haiku contest.  I did get some cute
ones, especially from SDream, but I'm certain someone out there will send
something that will really pop out as a winner (Ti-Fred?  Rhea?).

I wasn't able to tell what the prize is, but now I can:

A Friends & Family patch!

  If you haven't seen one, maybe you will soon.

So, here are the rules...

THE FIRST ANNUAL SFR HAIKU CONTEST!

Please send me your top three haikus, relating to raving, rave music, the
rave scene, rave experiences, etc...

Remember a Haiku is five, seven, five...

Dear Friends-

Just wanted to add a few comments about the recent New Moon party at Goat
Rock. I've been working as a DJ, sound person and organizer with the New
Moon collective for almost 2 years now and this last party was very
special.

To those people whining about the location you should think about why you
came to this party. For the few of us that put this on it is a sacred
pilgrimage that requires hard work and sacrifice. It is more to us than
just a party. Dance and celebration are of course very important but the
opportunity to create community and honor the Earth are equally important.
Goat Rock definitely demands extra effort. For Ann, Philip,Greg S. and me
this party took almost 24 hrs of non-stop effort and some other technical
and organizational time. It was well worth it but tiring.

This party was also a graduation party for Dr. Anne Loraine.
Congratulations, Anne and thanks for all your hard work. You were the
central person for this go around and you did a great job!!!

Respect also to:

Philip: for contributing sound equipment, expertise & nrg

Greg S.: for the main sound system, dedication & positive nrg

Tim: For hauling the system, getting there early, staying late  even with
cracked ribs

James: for hauling stufff and overall vibe assistance

Maureen: for a beautiful ceremony, altar and serious Goddess nrg

Bonnie: for an excellent set and her beautiful presence

Michelle: for being you & the massage, glad you got the chance to just come
and enjoy this one. You deserved it!

To all the other DJ's: Jim Cyr, Tracy, Claire,Roger,Tom & BioJeff thanks
for great tunes (it ain't easy hauling records up the beach!). People were
quite pleased with the variety and quality.

And to everyone else who helped set up and break down.

I camped at the party spot on Sun night and left Mon morning and the beach
was cleaned up well!!

If people want this party to continue it needs some more dedicated people
to take charge. If any one is interested email me or Ann at
anthrax@uclink.berkeley.edu.

Thank you Great Spirit for watching over our event!

All The Best,
Ronan

Geez, louise, I guess I came on too strong about the remoteness of the 
location and not strong enough about how wonderful the event was.  Allow me 
to correct that:

>From my south bay perspective, the drive was bad.  I commute to work, and 
I've come to seriously despise driving.  Taken by itself, the drive did not 
contribute to the evening at all, knowhatahmean?

But the event and the location itself were spectacular.  The folx that put 
this together did an excellent job of choosing a truly incredible spot to 
have their party.  I count this as one of my better rave experiences, most 
definitely.  As others have described so eloquently, it was truly beautiful. 
 I'm afraid I missed the ceremonies -- long drive and all that -- but they 
sounded perfect.  The weather, while chilly, was not uncomfortable and 
actually made dancing just that much easier.  It really was a perfect 
setting, albeit far removed from me.  When it came time to give donations, I 
contributed generously and gave the sweet lass with the donations box a big 
hug, my way of saying, "Please do this again!"

So to reiterate, I in no way lay blame on the promoters for the distance I 
personally have to drive, I was just venting a little.  Geez, it was such a 
wonderful event, I'm just darned glad to have been there!

For all you students out there...

----------------------------------

*File Description: 50 Ways to Disrupt an Exam*


 50 Fun things to do in a final that does not matter (i.e. you are going
    to fail the class completely no matter what you get on the final exam)
 
 
   1.  Bring a pillow. Fall asleep (or pretend to) until the last 15
   minutes. Wake up, say "oh geez, better get cracking" and do some
   gibberish work. Turn it in a few minutes early.
 
   2.  Get a copy of the exam, run out screaming "Andre, Andre, I've go
   the secret documents!!"
 
   3.  If it is a math/science exam, answer in essay form. If it is long
   answer/essay form, answer with numbers and symbols. Be creative. Use the
   integral symbol.
 
   4.  Make paper airplanes out of the exam. Aim them at the instructor's
   left nostril.
 
   5.  Talk the entire way through the exam. Read questions aloud, debate
   your answers with yourself out loud. If asked to stop, yell out, "I'm
   SOOO sure you can hear me thinking." Then start talking about what a
   jerk the instructor is.
 
   6.  Bring cheerleaders.
 
   7.  Walk in, get the exam, sit down. About five minutes into it, loudly
   say to the instructor, "I don't understand ANY of this. I've been to
   every lecture all semester long! What's the deal? And who the hell are
   you? Where's the regular guy?"
 
   8.  Bring a Game Boy (or Game Gear, etc...). Play with the volume at max
   level.
 
   9.  On the answer sheet (book, whatever) find a new, interesting way to
   refuse to answer every question. For example: I refuse to answer this
   question on the grounds that it conflicts with my religious beliefs. Be
   creative.
 
   10.  Bring pets.
 
   11.  Run into the exam room looking about frantically. Breathe a sigh of
   relief. Go to the instructor, say "They've found me, I have to leave the
   country" and run off.
 
   12.  Fifteen minutes into the exam, stand up, rip up all the papers into
   very small pieces, throw them into the air and yell out "Merry
   Christmas."  If you're really daring, ask for another copy of the exam.
   Say you lost the first one. Repeat this process every fifteen minutes.
 
   13.  Do the exam with crayons, paint, or fluorescent markers.
 
   14.  Come into the exam wearing slippers, a bathrobe, a towel on your
   head, and nothing else.
 
   15.  Come down with a BAD case of Turet's Syndrome during the exam. Be
   as vulgar as possible.
 
   16.  Do the entire exam in another language. If you don't know one, make
   one up!  For math/science exams, try using Roman numerals.
 
   17.  Bring things to throw at the instructor when s/he's not looking.
   Blame it on the person nearest to you.
 
   18.  As soon as the instructor hands you the exam, eat it.
 
   19.  Walk into the exam with an entourage. Claim you are going to be
   taping your next video during the exam. Try to get the instructor to let
   them stay, be persuasive. Tell the instructor to expect a percentage of
   the profits if they are allowed to stay.
 
   20.  Every five minutes, stand up, collect all your things, move to
   another seat, continue with the exam.
 
   21.  Turn in the exam approximately 30 minutes into it. As you walk out,
   start commenting on how easy it was.
 
   22.  Do the entire exam as if it was multiple choice and true/false. If
   it is a multiple choice exam, spell out interesting things (DCCAB. BABE.
   etc..).
 
   23.  Bring a black marker. Return the exam with all questions and
   answers completely blacked out.
 
   24.  Get the exam. Twenty minutes into it, throw your papers down
   violently, scream out "Fuck this!" and walk out triumphantly.
 
   25.  Arrange a protest before the exam starts (i.e. Threaten the
   instructor that whether or not everyone's done, they are all leaving
   after one hour to go drink)
 
   26.  Show up completely drunk. (Completely drunk means at some point
   during the exam, you should start crying for mommy).
 
   27.  Every now and then, clap twice rapidly. If the instructor asks why,
   tell him/her in a very derogatory tone, "the light bulb that goes on
   above my head when I get an idea is hooked up to a clapper. DUH!"
 
   28.  Comment on how sexy the instructor is looking that day.
 
   29.  Come to the exam wearing a black cloak. After about 30 minutes, put
   on a white mask and start yelling "I'm here, the phantom of the opera"
   until they drag you away.
 
   30.  Go to an exam for a class you have no clue about, where you know
   the class is very small, and the instructor would recognize you if you
   belonged.  Claim that you have been to every lecture. Fight for your
   right to take the exam.
 
   31.  Upon receiving the exam, look it over, while laughing loudly, say
   "you don't really expect me to waste my time on this drivel? Days of our
   Lives is on!!!"
 
   32.  Bring a water pistol with you. Nuff said.
 
   33.  From the moment the exam begins, hum the theme to Jeopardy. Ignore
   the instructor's requests for you to stop. When they finally get you to
   leave one way or another, begin whistling the theme to the Bridge on the
   River Kwai.
 
   34.  Start a brawl in the middle of the exam.
 
   35.  If the exam is math/science related, make up the longest proofs you
   could possibly think of. Get pi and imaginary numbers into most
   equations. If it is a written exam, relate everything to your own life
   story.
 
   36.  Come in wearing a full knight's outfit, complete with sword and
   shield.
 
   37.  Bring a friend to give you a back massage the entire way through
   the exam. Insist this person is needed, because you have bad circulation.
 
   38.  Bring cheat sheets FOR ANOTHER CLASS (make sure this is obvious...
   like history notes for a calculus exam... otherwise you're not just
   failing, you're getting kicked out too) and staple them to the exam,
   with the comment "Please use the attached notes for references as you see
   fit."
 
   39.  When you walk in, complain about the heat. Strip.
 
   40.  After you get the exam, call the instructor over, point to any
   question, ask for the answer. Try to work it out of him/her.
 
   41.  One word: Wrestlemania.
 
   42.  Bring balloons, blow them up, start throwing them around like they
   do before concerts start.
 
   43.  Try to get people in the room to do the wave.
 
   44.  Play frisbee with a friend at the other side of the room.
 
   45.  Bring some large, cumbersome, ugly idol. Put it right next to you.
   Pray to it often. Consider a small sacrifice.
 
   46.  Get deliveries of candy, flowers, balloons, telegrams, etc... sent
   to you every few minutes throughout the exam.
 
   47.  During the exam, take apart everything around you. Desks, chairs,
   anything you can reach.
 
   48.  Complete the exam with everything you write being backwards at a 90
   degree angle.
 
   49.  Bring a musical instrument with you, play various tunes. If you are
   asked to stop, say "it helps me think." Bring a copy of the Student
   Handbook with you, challenging the instructor to find the section on musical
   instruments during finals. Don't forget to use the phrase "Told you so".
 
   50.  Answer the exam with the "Top Ten Reasons Why Professor xxxx Sucks"

Good afternoon all!

I'm home from work today with a sinus cold that's been goin around.  I though I could 
avoid it but guess not/Waaaaaaa!

I celebrated my 28th birthday on Friday the 14th and had a great weekend!  I did try 
to make it to Monolith but decided to get some sleep before my friends and I went off 
to Great America on Sun.  So does anyone have a report on Monolith?  I'm particularly 
interested in  Mystr-E's set.

Stay well everyone!!

Here are some more.  Embarassingly enough, I actually got most of them, but
these are just some that I haven't seen answered (or wrong answers)


>>13. What was the name of the mechanical bear on Battlestar Galactica?
It was Boxey. And he was a dog ("Moffet" or "Moppet" was the species).

>>39. What was the name of Michael Knight's car? ....now, what was the
>>     name of his boss?
Car: Kitt of course.  Boss (this is embarassing :) - Devon _Miles_

>>43. To what does the obscure song "Turning Japanese" refer?
Going crazy. (OBSCURE!!?!?!)
 
>>53. What was the first video played on MTV?
The Buggles' "Video Killed the Radio Star" (someone already mentioned the title)

>>57. What was the name of the guy who couldn't enunciate on "The Fat
>>     Albert Show?"
Mush Mouth

>>59. What was the name of the singer who died in Robotech's first
>>     generation?
I'm pretty sure it was Min Mei (Rick Hunter's girlfriend) Good riddance, too ;)

>>70. What was the name of He-Man's magician sidekick?
Someone mentioned Battle Cat: That was his steed.  The magician was the little
guy with the red robe with the black circle on the chest and the wizard's hat
that covered most of his face.  What was his name??

>>72. Name the 4 girls from the "Facts of Life" and their chaperone
Tootie, Jo, Blair, Natalie and Mrs Garret (from Different Strokes...)

>>73. What gothic rock group did Tones on Tail become?
Love and Rockets
 
>>76. What was the movie that starred the little furry creatures from
>>     "Return of the Jedi"?
Ewoks: Return to Endor (I think)
 
>>80. Who played Ming of Mongo in "Flash Gordon"?
Frack! (remember that curse word?  Who said that?...) It's on the tip of my
tongue (Queen did the soundtrack, though:)

Oh yeah, I don't think anyone mentioned Martha Quinn as one of the original
MTV VJ's.

Why do I only remember useless information?

Hello again,

I seem to have been having some problems with my e-mail address and 
only some of my mail has been reaching me, if you would like to join 
in with this discussion please e-mail me at 

Davidt@londonantique.com

So, just for the hell of it here is a repeat of my previous note.

Interesting feedback so far, perhaps there are more gays at raves 
than I thought, but even so it would be nice to see more. I am going 
to start inviting all my gay friends and all of their gay friends and 
get a whole gays at raves pyramid going.

I love the idea of this mix of people, I don't think we should be 
having to choose whether to go to a "Gay" party or a "Straight" 
party, my friendships are not based on sexual orientation so it 
will be a fabulous party when we can all go out with our friends and no 
matter whether you are straight/gay/lesbian/bi/bi-curious/straight 
curious/gender non-specific/or a-sexual you can party with others 
just like you and celebrate diversity without feeling alone. Utopia 
is right at our fingertips and I want to party there!

Please keep this dicussion going and please invite all your friends 
to join in.

TTFN

David

#13 is Muffitt, not Boxey (Boxey was the boy), and the species was a
Dagitt, not a dog.
#53: Once in a Lifetime (Talking Heads; this is documented).  Video Killed
the Radio Star was the first "music video" ever made for the purpose of
being a music video, but it wasn't the first to air on MTV.
So, when we gonna see a similar list for the '70s?

Well,

63. Name the 5th original member of Depeche Mode who left the band,
    formed Yaz, and then went on form a more-lasting group.

*NOT* an answer, just a pet-peave -- they're "Yazoo" in the rest of the
world.

80. Who played Ming of Mongo in "Flash Gordon"?

Hi folks!

Thank you all for the wonderful posts on the New Moon.  Would it be al
right with the folks that posted if we put some of your posts up on the
New Moon web pages? (http://sfraves/raves/newmoon) 

Also, I am not particularly bummed out about people thinking that it was
kind of far to go for a party.  We took a risk by going out there...'cause
there always was a chance that the rangers would chase us away, and it
would have sucked in a big way if we had been evicted from the spot after
doing so much work for the party.  We probably won't do another party
there for a while- so as not to annoy the rangers.  It really is the ONLY
spot left that I know of where we could have such a large outdoor party
without getting kicked out.  I worry that having had the party there may
have ruined the place for future parties, but I think if we leave it alone
for a while, it will be okay to do parties there in future.    

And thank you Ronan for sticking around there the next few days and making
sure the place was completely cleaned up!!!  


Much respect and love to you all,

Ann

I'm not sure I follow you... Ann posted at least a couple of messages to
the sfraves list about the new moon party, inviting everyone to send mail
for details and pointing people to the web site for general new moon info. 
That's how I got informed, anyway! 

I'd like to thank Ann and everyone else who helped create this amazing
experience!  This is not something we should take for granted! 

take care,
Paul

We usually try to let lots of people know about the party, and where it
will be, ahead of time.  But there's only a few of us in the core group
planning each party, and there's only so much we can do to get the word
out!   For this party, we mostly just posted to sfraves to let
people know about it- after three years of doing the party, we've found
that the people that come to us from sfraves are absolutely awesome!  If
we had had the time, we might have made flyers and distributed them, but
we had our hands full just making sure our eqipment worked, that the stuff
had transportation, etc.  Making flyers is one of the funnest jobs, but
unfortunately, we just couldn't get it together to do that this time.
Also, this is a small, "experimental" party and it isn't really that
important to us to have huge numbers of people come, although it's very
nice when that happens!!!  Mostly we just want to get people together to
have a nice time, make friends, and feel a part of a community.  For many
of us, the new moon is the main time that we get to see friends that we
haven't seen for a month, and that's why the party's kept going over the
years.  

Also, our voicemail goddess (Michi!) has been putting other events on the
New Moon voicemail.  Notably, the River events, and other similar things.
So check the NM voicemail for information about other things besides the
New Moon!  415-267-3076.

We'd also like to set up some kind of "cc" list to send people email
notifying them about upcoming gatherings.  If anybody would like to add
their address to this list, send me email.  Also, you should check the web
page regualarly for updates.  We are also hoping to add pages for
individual writings- such as Jason, Cinnamon Twist!  We welcome all
contributions!!!  (http://hyperreal.com/raves/newmoon)

Well, I'll agree that Orion had potential...but my friends and I left feeling
that the promoters were kinda wack, although that doesn't mean we won't give
them another chance. Our biggest gripe was about the voicemail - we called
after 8 and still couldn't get directions (even though they said it was
supposed to start at 9), so we had to drive up from Mountain View not knowing
exactly where we were going. When we got to Sacramento a little before 11, it
took a while to get thru to their voicemail, and when we did, it said that the
first space had been busted and that they were trying to get another. So we
drove around for a while killing time, and called back at random intervals.
Eventually the message changed, but all it said then was that Orion would be
going off, but you had to call back in an hour or two. Well, at least two hours
passed and the message hadn't changed, and we were getting annoyed. But then we
just happened to see a bunch of people walking around a nearby building in an
alley, and we decided to check it out, and sure enough, it was Orion. By this
time it was past 2:30 and we'd hung out killing time at every place with late
hours that we could find - Del Taco, some 24hour coffeeshop, and Safeway - so
you can imagine our mood as we discovered no main room, the power repeatedly
going out, and then the cops clearing out the whole place not too much later.
And as for nobody caring that the power kept going out...well, that might have
been the case in the ambient room (I did hear the clapping and the drums), but
people seemed a bit more annoyed in the hardcore/jungle room (at one point,
everybody started banging loudly on the pillars, which had been covered in that
packing bubble sheet stuff). I can understand how the promoters might not have
had complete control over the building's power source or the cops, but they
could've dealt with their voicemail better - like, have directions early enough
for non-Sacramento dwellers, and have directions, period. Telling people that
it's been busted and asking them to call back, and then having it resume
without updating their voicemail is not cool...

It's kinda ironic how I'd just run into one of the promoters at F-8 when I was
buying tickets, and she'd promised me it'd be worth the drive cuz it was gonna
go off...better luck next time, I guess...

*** Reply to note of 06/18/96 15:24
FROM: Robert Brown

SUBJECT:       (Fwd) MORE GAYS @ RAVES

A few thoughts on the subject....(all subjective and opinion, of course)

I used to wonder myself whether there were that many gay people at raves,
but now I'd say that there probably are more than may be obvious or known.
This may likely be, as has been pointed out, that raves aren't as
overtly sexual (vs. the stereotypical club or bar) so ones sexual orientation
is not one of the first impressions or a factor in how people interact
at raves (up to a certain point, of course).

I have invited some of my gay friends to raves and I get a couple of
different reactions.  The relevant reaction being a concern that they
won't know whether or not someone is gay and thusly fear approaching
anyone.  This is perhaps an attitude coming from the "club scene" and
I suspect the fear of gay bashing  (i.e., if I approach another guy in a
non-gay situation, even in a non-sexual manner will I get beaten up?).
This is something that gays have to worry about on occassion that hetero-
sexuals may take for granted.  For us ravers we of course realize that
this is not the climate at a rave, and that may be what is important
to impart to those gay friends you wish to bring into the scene (or at least
bring to a rave).

One factor for gays possibly prefering to go to gay clubs versus raves is
to meet other gay people, be it as friends, potential relationships, or
for sexual reasons.  Not sure where this is going, but seemed like a point to
make.

As for making a club or event more mixed, someone mentioned passing out
flyers at Club Universe.  Something to that effect could work, such as
leaving flyers at select locations/stores in the Castro (Headlines, etc.),
the Billy DeFrank Center in San Jose, and so on.  This would probably be
better suited to something like Spundae.

I think having a very mixed group is a healthy idea that I fully support
and hopefully such a mixed environment will take firm hold.

Comment on Blue Lagoon...correct me if I'm wrong, please, but isn't that
just about the only actual dance club in Santa Cruz?  If so, wouldn't this
tend to bring people in regardless of orientation, despite the fact that it
is known to be a primarily gay club?? I know there's Palookaville, but they
are primarily geared toward live bands aren't they??

Thanks for reading this far!  I've babbled long enough!

Peace,
  - R

	i guess it's time to stop lurking, and speak up on what's the fuss
over the right front speaker and the Right Front Speaker Family:

well, the right front speaker family is comprised of a number of ravers
all over the country (and possibly a few in other countries as well) who
prefer to dance in front of the right front speaker (according to where
the dj is located). 
the whole idea was originated by sarvi and i during the summer of 1994 :) 
it was basically the "home base" we created so that we knew where our
backpacks were, where others could find us, and where we can find each
other during times of separation :)
as the months progressed, we visited different parts of the US, raving
along the way. at each rave, we still used the right front speaker as
our "home base", and our friends started using the right front speaker as
their "home base" as well. and with friends visiting and raving with us in
the bay area, they started using the right front speaker as their "home
base" too! 
so the right front speaker has no fancy decorations. it doesn't
necessarily have better sound than any of the other speakers. and the
right front speaker family is not an elite group of ravers that only the
chosen may join.
why the right front speaker? well, the front speaker so we may easily see
the turntables and the dj. and the right speaker because it was just
closer in many cases! :)
the right front speaker family is open for all to join, and it is just a
place where you may find a number of your friends! and in no way does it
discriminate against those who may make up a "left front speaker family"
;)  

*GASP* 
jan finally posts ;)
hehehehe...i hope to find all of you at the right front speaker ;)
take care, and i will talk to you all later!

Hey all!

I was reading a book a while back, and I found this awesome passage in 
it which sounded startlingly familiar!  I have actually passed it out 
to a few people at various raves, but I just thought it so cool that I 
thought I'd post it to the list.

Anyway, in this book (which some of you may be familiar with), the 
Devil takes a vampire and shows him Heaven, and the following is the 
vampire's description of what Heaven is like:


        "What I saw, however, overwhelmed me as much as the sound.  
This was very simply the most profoundly magnificent place I'd ever 
beheld.  Our language needs endless synonyms for beautiful;  the eyes 
could see what the tongue cannot possibly describe.
        "Once again, people were everywhere, people filled with light, 
and of distinct anthropomorphic shape; they had arms, legs, beaming 
faces, garments of all different kinds, yet no costume of any seemingly 
great importance, and the people were moving, traveling paths in groups 
or alone, or coming together in patterns, embracing, clasping, reaching 
out, and holding hands.
        "I turned to the right and to the left, and then all around me, 
and in every direction saw these multitudes of beings, wrapped in 
conversation or dialogue or some sort of interchange, some of them 
embracing and kissing, and others dancing, and the clusters and groups 
of them continued to shift and grow or shrink and spread out.
        "Indeed, the combination of seeming disorder and order was the 
mystery.  This was not chaos.  This was not confusion.  This was not a 
din.  It seemed the hilarity of a great and final gathering, and by 
final I mean it seemed a perpetually unfolding resolution of something, 
a marvel of sustained revelation, a gathering and growing understanding 
shared by all who participated in it, as they hurried or moved 
languidly or even in some cases sat about doing very little."


Sound familiar?


Love,
Shawna

Yeah, we've all been slammed, but no worries, it will happen, I'm still,
slowly looking for places, and I hope everyone is at least keeping an ear out
for any possible gathering sites, Yosemite or otherwise.  I'll be moving over
the next couple weeks, but schools out and business is slow, so hopefully
I'll have some time.  Matt, no worries, you've done a lot so far, I know how
difficuly it is just keeping track of names and people interested.  Don't
trash your files yet.  Keep the communication flowing, and the image of it
occuring in your mind, and it will happen.

Hello all!

First of all, I couldn't help but respond to this message because I 
ABSOLUTELY LOVE our scene and ABSOLUTELY EVERYONE in it! Through your
positive energy and love you all have changed my life in such a positive
way that words cannot describe it and for that I will be eternally
grateful. My purpose and message in this post is to purely offer my
opinion on this topic and NOT to start a negative email campaign. 

I believe that there are already a representative portion of people,
possibly more?, at raves who consider themselves gay, lesbian, bi, etc.
I wouldn't say I'm unique but I used to consider myself to be 100% gay
and now consider myself to be bi...you always hear about people who
thought they were 100% straight and then realize that they are gay or bi
but rarely, if ever?, the other way around! I think that the question
of "How can we draw more gays (or more of any group) into our scene?"
should be re-phrased into "How can we draw THOSE PEOPLE who are on a
search, a SPIRITUAL MISSION, to find the answers to their life's
questions into our scene?". We all know that PART of what makes our
scene extremely special and sacred is the fact that there is no emphasis
whatsoever on sex, sexuality, race, religion, etc. When we gather at
parties we become ONE...there is no gay/straight, man/woman, 
white/black, old/young, rich/poor etc...we simply see each other as
beautiful people and ultimately we can become one pure energy mass of
love. This is what drew me to the scene and not whether or not I would
find other gay, bi-sexual, straight, etc. people at raves. I had become
so disillusioned at the spiritual emptiness of the clubs in general that
I felt as if I were losing my soul. I would be with friends but it was
extremely hard to give off positive energy when all I would hear is
people trying to pick on someone or impress a date/friend by cutting up
on other people for who they were or what they were wearing or what they
looked like.

I know that not everyone is ready or wants to receive what our scene has
to offer, some would even seek to misuse or destroy it, however, we must
have compassion and love for those who harm us since they deserve as
much as anyone else to be a part of our vision and hope of a future
world where there is no want and no pain. A world where the young, old
and sick are taken care of. A world where the environment is whole
again.

Well, I've said enough and hopefully the right stuff!? I would just like
to close out with a small message to all of you, men and women, whom I
consider to be my friend whether or not we've met:

Please understand that when I offer a piece of candy or a massage, I do
it out of my LOVE in my heart for YOU and I expect absolutely NOTHING in
return, not even a thank you...I just LOVE to give and do not want or
expect any recognition or praise. I know that when I give you LOVE, it's
contagious and causes you, in turn, to pass it on to others and so on
and so on! That's what that positive vibe is all about! Nonetheless, I
completely understand if any of you are uncomfortable about your new
found knowledge about me. Please know that I will NOT use the usual
excuse of, "Well, I guess that person wasn't my friend anyway!" because
I will always love you as my friend with all my heart forever.

Peace and Love!
John

Subject: Gays & raves, does it matter!?
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

   People would be surprised if they actually knew how many gays, lesians,
bi people that are at a rave. Do you goto a rave to look for just that? I
hope people goto them because of the music, vibe, and love that is there.
That's why I go. Ever since I've started raving my life has been change for
the good. I've never been happier. I remember before raving I had a closed
opinion about gay males. I didn't care for them and thought they were sick
and should be put on and island by themselves. Women didn't bother me, maybe
because I like women and it's great to see two of them together. Anyway,
since raving it has open my eyes. It shouldn't matter. As long as everyone
is happy with there choices in life. Why should it matter if there are gay,
straight, lesbian, bi people at a rave? It's all about who we are inside
that should matter. I know it would be nice to have an equal amount of all
types of people there, hell I'd love it if there were nothing but straight
women at a rave, BUT that's not what it's about and not what it should be
about. We need a mix of people to experience what others half to offer. Each
person is different in there own way and when they bring that to a rave
sometimes it spread to others, and improves the lifes that it touched some
how. I use to think hugging another guy always felt wierd and didn't want
people to see me do it. Now, why should it matter. Do you feel wierd when
you shake someone hand that is the same sex? No, then why should a hug.

  I'm not sure if any of this is off the subject, because when I saw the
original post and read it, I didn't have an interest to read the others
because for the fact that it shouldn't matter who is at a rave. As long as
there heart is open and in the right place and has the love for the scene of
raving and all that it brings to each of us it really shouldn't matter, it
wouldn't be as good if there was only a certain type of people at a rave,
it's the combination of several types of people that make this scene what it
is today. A GREAT ONE! and I LOVE it!

OK, this is fun.  Don't be shy.
Anyone can come up with a haiku:  Here's 3 of mine:

* * *

Together in dance
I laughed with eternity
Music is timeless

* * *

Dancing and Sweating
A long line for the bathroom
Fluids in motion

* * *

Spinning and twirling
I transcended my limits 
Puked up a blowpop

hooray for you! :)  i know a LOT of guys who wouldn't be willing to 
change their concept of gays.  It saddens me, but oh well.

And you're right - why does it matter who gets up to what?  i don't go to 
raves looking for bedmates, and i would hope that isn't first on most 
ravers' lists.  I'm enjoy either myself (although WAY more picky about my 
womenfolk - probably because i'm still learning) but if all i'm doing is 
dancing and interacting, who cares.

The thing i like about raving is that none of the typical "club 
mentality" is there, for the most part .... i'm much more open to people 
at raves than i am in a club.  I don't feel like someon's gonna try 
REALLY HARD to get me to dance with him/her or start invading my space 
unless they're welcomed by me.  You know what i mean?  there's nothing 
more annoying than someone who won't leave you alone to the point where 
you HAVE to be rude cos they won't take a hint ....

well, i just got up and am still kinda in sleep mode so ... off to get 
ready for yet ANOTHER grueling day at Ye Olde Law Firm.  :P

peace

I look at sexual preference the same way I look at skin color.  

        Who cares?  

Are you a good person, fun to hang out with, handy with a hug, a dancing 
fool not unlike myself?  Dang, then let's party!

BINGO.  And I hate feeling like I have to get someone to dance with me, 
cause in a club guys look a little stupid dancing by themselves.  And I 
REALLY hate getting shot down, nasty looks and all, like I'm trying to pick 
up on someone when *all* I wanted was to DANCE!  And I hate the feel of the 
hunt around me, guys posing, women acting aloof, pick-up lines thick as 
smoke in the air, at least one couple practically having sex on the dance 
floor.  I just want to have fun, and I want it to feel like I'm out with a 
large group of friends, not a bunch of predatory strangers.

AAAARRRRRGGGGHHHH!!!!!!

...don't even get me started...

Last night, I was at Tower Video to rent a tape with Jamie. As I pass
the Bass counter, I finally ask her if she wants to go see the
Brothers, and she agrees, so I bought the tix. That $3.75 service
charge is legal scalping, as far as I'm concerned.

So, anyway, can anyone tell me what the Trocadero is like? This will
be my first visit there. Are there any particularly strategic spots
for dancing or listening there?

Who else on the list is going?

Well......i know I'm going to check out the chemical brothers at the
Trocadero on Friday night
doors 8pm Tickets $15.00 from Reckless records, The Trocadero or Bass (turds).
They are a duo from England that play hip-hop inspired Techno or is that
Techno inspired hip hop.
Either way, these guys are coool. And have wicked visuals also.
Afterwards , i'lll probably head to 1015, unless something else comes up.

Saturday.....dunno.......just chill or maybe try and get out to the country.

Sunday...I just Gotta go to the Sunset party. I haven't been yet, but I
think I'll beg, borrow or
Steal a car to go.

Monday......If you like Techno you just HAVE to go the Fillmore to see
Orbital, Underworld &
Space Time Continuum. The first two acts are simply THE BOMB and I don't
know much about the last, but I had a spirituall experienece seeing Orbital
play to 30,000 people in Europe last 
summer.

Btw, are any other of you cool Sfraves people going to any of these shows ?
Let me know.

Peace,

Ciaran

Well for anybody who cares, here's what I've picked up over the years:
1.  the "urban legend" I'm sure everybody has heard, that strychnine
(or speed) was added to acid to give you that body-buzz and enhance the
effect.  Never having met anybody that made acid, I believed it.
2.  Flipside magazine a couple of years ago ran a series of articles,
"Just Say Know", one of which was dedicated to acid (I can give exact
references to anybody that wants) where the author gave the low-down on
the dozen or so variations on the lsd molecule each of which had
slightly different effects ranging from nothing at all to mind/body
blowing experences (lsd-25 being the best)  As he pointed out, most
people cooking probably don't know about these let alone how to test
for them and how to guarentee a particular variant.  Some of those
variants gave the body-buzz, hot-cold flashes, stomache cramps, etc...
normally associated with strychnine--i.e., there is no strychnine in acid
3. Last fall, I met a person who claimed to have cooked acid with
`professionals' and he said they `painted' the sheets of paper used for
blotter with strychnine as a preservative.

There's my collected knowledge on the subject, you make the call.

I am not promoting the use of LSD as that would be inappropriate on
this list and inappropriate to several hundre people I don't know-
-it's not for everybody.  As the scientist who discovered LSD says,
"LSD is for the prepared mind"

Tim -- lurking no more

P.S. Feel free to correct or add to anything I stated above (perhaps by
     direct reply to me if it's not appropriate for the list)

I have been there a couple of times before, the last time was to see Banco
De Gaia 
perform a few months ago. That was a great show.
The venue is a decent size, maybe holda a couple of thou'
 with good acoustics and impressive sound system.
It's usually used for industrial nights such as Terminator & Bondage a Go-go.
I think the Terminator club is on after the show, so i'll hop, skip and Jump
elsewhere to hear *happy* tunes.
Staetegic spot for dancing ? wherever you feel like it I guess.

btw, the show ticket i have looks el cheopo, surely they could have designed
something a litttle more asthetically pleasing.........

See you there.

Peace

The Trocadero is weird. They have a reputation for disliking the ravers 
that pay their bills, have problems with people bringing in any kind of 
containers ((sealed or empty)) and have been know to shut off the air 
conditioning to increase their bottled water sales. 

I saw the Chemical Brothers when they played at The Trocedero last year. 
$10 sunday night show with Jeno & Garth opening, which I thought was a 
good bill. The crowd was a strong mix of generic clubbers, kid DJ's, and 
a few raver types. like I said, Jeno & Garth opened and for the first few 
hours it had a disco feel to it, with room to dance and people doing just 
that. I was upstairs in the opium den/ ambient room when the Chemical 
Brothers took stage and everybody bolted downstairs. Below it became *very* 
packed, & dance floor was transformed into a Beastie Boys or any other 
kind of traditional stage show deal where the entire crowd was just kind 
of watching the TV up on stage and bopping their heads along. I danced in 
my sXe pose for most of the night & tried not to poke anybody in the eye.

After the Chemical Brothers ((60-80 min ?)) set about 60% of the crowd took 
off and Garth & Jeno tag teamed on the decks for another hour or so, once 
again transforning the place into a dance floor before the the Trocadero 
shut down at around 1:30 - 2am. Cool people showed up & I'm glad I went.

This does happen to an extent, but the Blue is just so mediocre that 
there's a limit to its attraction.  And now, though it's still the only 
full-time club, there are two steady weeklies offering a much better 
dance scene, so there's no need to go to the Blue just to get your fix.

Too bad. Both speed and strychnine are only active in milligram quantities
(LSD in the microgram range) and therefore (as the first post said) can
not be impregnated in large enough amounts in tab/blotter/microdot to
give _any_effect.

Correct. Actually I believed this to be the right explanation at first
and still think it could play a role (I am a chemist by profession btw).
However, I asked a Dutch chemist friend of mine who is a walking
encyclopedia (sp?) on psychedelics and their pharmacology and he said
it is more likely to be due to an overload of not only your central
nervous system ("the trip") but also the nerves connected to your
stomach, kind of like when your nervous or deeply in love (butterflies..)
and it gets to your stomach or bowels ;-) I've seen situations were
two people shared the same blotter acid and only one of them had
stomach trouble, apparently it depends more on the person than the
acid, in agreement with the last explanation.

Very unlikely, strychnine is mostly used to kill rodents (again in milligrams
that do not fit on a tab). It would make more sense to add an anti-oxidant
since LSD is sensitive to light and air (store in your fridge!). Unless
these people had a serious problem with psychedelic rats eating their
blotters by the dozen this seems not very "profesional".

> There's my collected knowledge on the subject, you make the call.

OK, for the very last time, their is no strychnine in acid, and even if
there would be, the dose would be too small to have any effect.
(check out alt.drugs where this theme comes back every so many weeks
and people are getting _really_ bored with repeating the same thing
over and over again.)

I think it's appropriate, but perhaps this could be the final word...

I disagree.  Dancing alone at a club is my way of closing my eyes to all
that I find negative at the club.  Of course, negative in *my* opinion.

My dog and I caught a beautiful Pacific sunset up on Bolinas Ridge last night.  
Man, the whole time I could hear the faint beat of bongos from the next ridge 
over.  Even better, about an hour after sunset the stars were out and I started to 
feel these soft warm winds sweeping up from the valley below.  I can't describe 
how relaxing it was to feel those warm winds at night.

Anyhow, point being the summer solstice is this Friday.  Does anybody know of any 
outdoor events scheduled?  Please shoot me some mail if you do. Otherwise I'll 
have to get all Mayan up on Mt. Tam 'cause the weather is just too inviting.

Your Pal Always,

P.S. Hey, does anybody out there remember "Felix The Cat" outside of Santa Rosa or 
wherever it was, Summer '92 I think?  Boy, something like that would hit the spot 
right now.

 Someone asked recently whether any daytime events were happening on
Friday in relation to Solstice. I understand that Gateway Systems will
be holding an outdoor daytime/evening event called LIGHT. Info number
is (415) 536-9453. 2PM-9PM  All Ages. SFRaves calendar has more info.

Raver culture

200$ Answer: A large party, in excess of 5000 people in attendance.

600$ Answer: Past tense of a car losing control or how a raver feels after
many hours/days of dancing.

800$ Answer: An acronym for a raver mode of thought regarding well being
amongst ravers and non-ravers alike.

1000$ Answer: A date in raver-lore to when the whole shebang and the ultimate
end of everything is coming, thus giving reasons for promoters to throw even
funer, more vibe-filled and faster, events.

The problem wasn't the promoters,  the problem was the PIGS.   They had applied
time and time again for the permit,  and according to the promoters,  they
got the verbal OK....   Thats why the cops let them continue after a silance
period.

Sacramento is not a very good place to have a rave.    Almost all parties get
shut down sooner or later.....

Yeah.. just about the only places left are Cal Expo (Smarties and Funky 
Tekno Tribe), under the Yolo Causeway on 80 when it's not flooded, and 
way out in BFE in a warehouse.  Anything in DOWNTOWN Sac will get 
busted.... I don't know why nobody's trying to do parties in warehouses 
this summer... last summer there were a ton of good parties that didn't 
even come close to get busted, all in warehouses... Liquid Groove, Common 
Ground, Tribal Funk, X-Files, and Ooga Booga all went off in warehouse or 
underground locations last year.

I think it's just the fact that nobody here wants to try because someone 
throws a party in the city the same night and nobody wants to drive all 
the way out here :)

Hmmm, I'm thinking rice fields out on Hwy 70? 

Personally I could never get into the scene at all in Sac over the last 5 
years....perhaps it's because of the promoters, I don't know but to me there 
really was never a strong vibe in Sac to begin with because of parties always 
getting busted. I do remember Plush about 3 or 4 years ago, now that was 
nice.

ELEVATION 96 Sometime in August

Some might recall Elevation last fall equinox.  Fillip and I threw that party
on my friends space about 1.5 hrs into the mountains, midlle of no where, 10
miless of dirt road.  We had nearly well over 100 folks from all over out
there, one of the nicest outdoor parties I've been to. Gavin & many others
called best ever.  Well keep yer ears peeled for the next one.  That space is
still available but I'd like to find something closer.  We've also got a
couple of bands/artists that will be playing daytime for this one.

Harlon had new copies of the DJ Dan + Ron D. Core mixtapes, DX2.  
Supposedly these are "limited" re-releases.  Are these still available at 
Ameba or other places?  I have the originals, but I'm a weird person who 
must waste money on st00pid things like this.  I bought the new copy of 
"House the Discotheque" just cuz it had a cool cover.

I just heard on KPFA that TranceMission will be playing Friday in SF.
She said the "TranceMission Theater", which 411 doesn't seem to know about
and gave a phone number that goes to City of Tribes records but has no
recorded info on this.
Anybody else heard anything?

Nothing about KPFA, but the Transmission Theatre exists at 11th and Folsom, 
just behind the Paradise Lounge (on 11th).  It's a really nice space.

howdy all 
a couple of weeks ago I went to amsterdam and isreal via germany, (some 
pics at  http://shgc-www.stanford.edu/~piercy/fun.html) Well amsterdam 
was pretty crazy it's nice to be in a place were you dont have to hide 
like a criminal while smoking potIn Frankfurt I watched some MTV style 
show that played Jungle videos and then had a DJ mix live in front of the 
camera(very strange) in Isreal EVERY where was trance.  In amsterdam it 
was all about jungle I picked up some flyers there-seems like alchohol is 
a big part of the club seen,go figure-I mean its Amsterdam why drink, you 
can buy mushrooms ant your local head shop (remember these are the 
imperesions of a visitor-maybee i got the wrong flyers)  Isreal was 
definatly diferent I felt kinda like an outsider(not being jewish or arab) 

 I had a really facinating conversation with a young Isreali 
guy-so funny i wrote it down maybee it'll go on my page.  It was amazing 
being in a place with so much history and so much tension-it took me an 
hour to get out of the airport due to the exit interview that every one 
must go thru, becouse I fly on an Airline discount i cant reserve a seat 
the plane was full so i had to sit in a little fold-out seat behind the 
captain that was pretty starnge-especially landing.  Basically electronic 
music is totally accepted as 'normal' there(last time i went it still 
seemed obscure) and that was bizare to me-in this place it still gets put 
down quite alot-I geuss I prefer it that way, but i'm strange that 
way-not to many Lucky Srtike sponsered massives here... yet

To me, San Francisco just has a different feel to her raves.  I know most 
of the promoters in Sac and I appreciate what all of them are doing, and 
occasionally I will attend a club that they are doing.  But like John 
Deatherage pointed out, Sac gets BUSTED!  (with a few exceptions) And so 
I would just rather not go.  

Hm...plus I just KNOW more people in SF.  I go to a Sac party, and i know 
the people throwing the event - and, hell, they're busy!  I'm putting 
more energy into the SF vibe anyways, because it will be my HOME by the 
end of this year (if all goes as planned...)

Oh yeah.  Now that was a great rave!  That was the best vibe I ever 
caught from Sac people, but then again, it takes a special kind of person 
to trek through miles of mountain dirt roads at night....

Hello there again,

HELP

 I posted a week ago that I needed to find a room for rent,well the need is even
greater now. I have to find a place within the next month or two. I am going to
crash at a friends for right now but it only temporary.

I work in San Jose and willing to live anywhere in the area. I am 23 looking
for someone that is responsible but yet likes to party and have a good time.
I have a steady job and open to anything. As I said before I have been out of 
the scene and I want to come back. If anyone has anything or any ideas please
let me know.You can email me privatly.

Thanx,
nikki

Isn't it wonderful? With the European Community coming things might get
more restricted since our neighbouring countries complain that every
body is importing Dutch pot from Holland. Did you try the Dutch-grown
superskunk? Highest THC content in the world I believe. Guaranteed to
knock you off your socks...

> In amsterdam it  was all about jungle I picked up some flyers

Mostly among the black kids, we have everything from 200 bpm gabber to
easy tunes (latest trend). Check out the Mazzo next time (I heard they
are back at their old (great) location after a fire. Great techno under-
ground club.

> there-seems like alchohol is a big part of the club seen,go figure-

And vice versa I'm still amazed by the attitude here concerning alcohol.
In my impression one almost forces people to use dope (at the Tibetan Freedom
concert it was hard to see the bands through the potsmoke clouds). At home
those who don't like to get high/tweek just have a beer and are still
cool. I feel it's better to inform/educate people and learn them some
responsibility than treating them like little kids. Here you have a
beautiful country with great weather and you can not even drink a cold
beer on the beach/at a street terrace or after 2 o'clock at night. Weird.

> I mean its Amsterdam why drink, you can buy mushrooms at your local head shop

And via the internet! (USD accepted, see http://www.xs4all.nl/~psee/)
Again, in Holland we leave it up to the people what they want to do,
Wanna smoke weed? Fine. Wanna have a beer? Fine too. We don't force
anybody to do anything and still the nightlife/raves/clubs are as
relaxed as over here. Perhaps it's not the alcohol but the attitude?
Here there seem to be laws againts anything that is even remotely fun,
no wonder people take it to extremes when they get the chance
(I'm still amazed for instance by the ease and quantity with which
acid is used in this country, now that's a drug which should be used
with a bit more respect and caution).

> (remember these are the imperesions of a visitor-maybee i got the wrong
> flyers)

No, alcohol is present as almost any rave, no ID's are checked, if you're
18 you're considered adult and basically anything goes. Police policy
is not to arrest the users but to get the large-scale traders....
Leave it to the people and inform them rather then arrest them, let
them learn from their own mistakes (=better them having somebody
telling you what's best)

I liked your webpage (feeling homesick seeing the canal...).
Sorry if I sounded a bit harsh (too much coffee this morning? Hehe,
another typical American habbit), just trying to explain some cultural
differences here,

Cheers,

The Frying Dutchman

weekend one.  Hmm...maybe those of us going to this should try and meet 
up at the show?  :)

A message posted earlier said Freedom was to be held in San
Francisco...?  What happened to Livermore, does anyone know?  I've been
told it would be "just plain wrong" to hold this annual event anywhere
else.  Does anyone know the score here?

Thanks!  Hope everyone's day is filled with sunshine!

Ok, here it is!

The map point will open promptly at 8pm and will close around 1am, so
PLEASE arrive as early as possible.

The detailed directions will begin at the 10/215 intersection, so it
will assume that you will be able to find your way there.  I think most,
if not all of you have been to the Orange Show at one time or another.
If you don't know where it is, consult your local California roadmap,
and if you still need further assistance, leave a message on the
voice-mail line and I'll get back to you.

The number in the parentheses is the milage, so when you get to the
10/30, zero out your trip meter.

========================================================================

>From the 10/215 intersection, take the 215 north for 5.9 miles to the 
30 east.

You should now be at the intersection of the 215 and the 30 freeway, so
zero out your trip meter.
(0.0)

Continue on the 30 for 5.3 miles until you see the 330.  The sign should
read Mountain Resorts.
(5.3)

You will see a sign that says welcome to the San Bernardino Mountains on
your right at the base of the mountain.
(7.3)

On your left, you will see a Forest Service station.
(10.5)

Continue on this road...

After a little while, you will come to a fork near Running Springs.
Continue under the bridge towards Big Bear.
(21.0)

On your left, you'll see a Union station.  If you don't have gas at this
point, get it there because you won't find one until you get into town.
(21.4)

A few miles down the road, you'll get to Green Valley where KC and a
bunch of others will be camped out.  DO NOT turn!
(23.9)

Keep on driving....

On your right will be Snow Valley -- site of Organic!
(26.9)

About a mile later, you will reach a spot where you can almost see the
lake.  This is the beginning of the Arctic Circle.
(28.4)

Continue on this winding road til you get to a fork.  This is the dam at
the edge of the lake.  Turn right.
(33.8)

After driving on the south side of the lake (Big Bear lake will be to
your left), you'll see a Texaco gas station on your right, and a sign
welcoming you to Big Bear straight ahead.  Turn left onto Paine Rd.
(37.8)

Paine turns into Big Bear Blvd (Hwy 18), which is the one and only main
boulevard that goes through the town.  About a mile and a half down,
you'll see a Shell gas station on your right.  This is Summit Blvd, and
to your right is Snow Summit.  Keep on going...
(39.6)

After another mile, you'll see an AM/PM on your right.  Continue on...
(40.8)

You will soon see the Big Bear Convention Center on your left.  This is
Division.  Keep on going... you're almost there.
(41.8)

Finally, on your left, you'll see a Chevron station.  Turn left onto
Greenway -- the only signal intersection in Bear City.
(43.1) 

The map point will be at the Big Bear City Park on your right.  Turn in
and you'll see someone there.  Please don't loiter around there -- leave
for the site as soon you recieve your map.

Here are a few things to remember or keep in mind -- please respect our
wishes so that we can continue to bring you more high-quality events in 
the future.  (Directions to the map point will follow shortly in a
separate e-mail.)  

Also, please forward this message, along with the directions to those
that are not on socal-raves -- thanks. 

Things to bring:
o  layered clothing -- it gets chilly at night (low 40's), and very 
   warm (80's) during the day
o  blankets, tents, and sleeping bags for warmth and to rest up for 
   Organic
o  food and drinks (free water will be provided if necessary)
o  fire extinguisher(s) if you own one (in case of emergency)
o  candy, toys, and other goodies to share with everyone

Things NOT to bring OR do:
o  hazardous/flammable material of any kind -- ie no fireworks,
   campfires, flame-throwers, or smoking outside of designated areas
o  nitrous tanks and/or balloons -- ABSOLUTELY NO EXCEPTIONS

General tips:
o  PLEASE DO NOT attempt to drive if not completely sober and awake
o  PLEASE DO NOT disturb wildlife or its natural surroundings -- respect 
   Mother Nature
o  PLEASE DO NOT wander onto the main road from the site (to avoid 
   attracting any unnecessary attention)
o  PLEASE throw trash away in one of the several trashcans situated near
   the dance area
o  PLEASE keep the music down in your cars as you are travelling through
   town and in populated areas -- the law enforcement in Big Bear do not
   take too kindly to loud, repetitive digital music

Things TODO:
o  ooze excess PLUR and share with those that are a little lacking
o  hug at least one person you don't know, smile, or just say hello
o  if you see trash, please pick it up and deposit at the nearest trashcan 
o  MOST OF ALL HAVE LOTS OF FUN!!! 

Ok, and the final details...

BBQ will begin around 6pm, so bring your fave item to throw on the
barbie.

The roads leading to the site are a little bumpy, but should be
accessible by any vehicle.  If you arrive after sunset, drive slow, and
keep your eye out for rocks and ditches.  We will be trying to clear out
all major obstacles before you all arrive to make the drive as smooth as
possible.

There will be free goodies to the first 200 people, so again, arrive
early.

Finally, the cost for this event is ONLY $5.

Hope to see you all there!!!

OK everyone,

I think this'll be the last update for IN-ORGANIC before I post the
directions to the map point here this Thursday.  

Well, first of all, I'd like to ask all the volunteers that responded to
me that wished to help out with the party to get back to me ASAP so that
I may arrange cabin space for you.  Just a reminder, we are looking for
people to volunteer some time to help with doing 'party stuff' in 
exchange for cabin space.  So if you're interested, please get back to 
me ASAP!  Thanks.

Alrighty...
The DJ lineup has been confirmed (in order of appearance):
	Superstar DJ Trouble (need I say more?)
	KC (Dune)
	Brad (Mother Earth)
	Daniel (Moontribe)
Note that there may be some last minute additions/changes.

Sound will be provided by Ohm Soundlabs, who will bring out the same
system that was present at the last Moontribe, so the forest will be
rocking!

Medical support will be provided by Medi-Rave!

We will have BBQ grills at the location starting at around 5pm, so come
out early and grub with us.  Please bring your favorite grillable items,
since we won't be able to provide food for everyone.  If anyone is
interested in joining our little BBQ gathering, please RSVP as soon as
possible by sending me an e-mail.

Also, remember that this party is not limited to the socal list people, 
so spread the word to those that aren't on the list.  As long as they
bring good vibes, all are welcome! 

We also ask that if anyone has a fire extinguisher, that they would
bring it and leave it in their cars -- just in case.  We will have
several, but it'll be nice to have a few more laying around.  Speaking
of fires, remember folks that there is to be NO FIRES of any kind!  Do
NOT SMOKE in the mountains!  We will be designating a smoking area, so
please do not light up anywhere outside of there -- PLEASE!

Finally, we will NOT be allowing ANY nitrous tanks anywhere near the
area.  If you are planning on bringing one -- DON'T!  

If you can't check your e-mail Thursday for directions to the map point,
just call the following number:

                   7  1  4 - 2  2  4  9  7  7  9

See you all there!

Despite the Livermore racetrack being a giant dustbowl and windy area, I 
wouldn't want Freedom to be anywhere else.  That place brings back so 
many memories - the most vivid being the fire back in '93.

curious also,

Nope, you were wrong about Duran Duran's original name.

Arcadia was the band that Simon, Nick and Roger formed after D2 broke up 
for a brief time.  Arcadia's  most famous singles included "Re-election 
Day" and "Goodbye is Forever".

Duran Duran's original name was RAF.  Someone said it was Barbarella, but 
that was the name of the movie in which they got their name, Duran Duran.

I don't know if anyone really even cares, but I worshiped this band long 
ago, and this is the only question on the list that nobody can get.  
Trust me, it is right! :)

My apologies for taking up bandwidth on sfraves, beign that this is is 
off topic.

so an obrave: we should have a rave with an 80's dress up theme! :):)

love,
Amy

That's right, kiddies: Stella Luna will be providing atmospheric,
vibe-inspiring, energy-invoking music (might call it ambient noise) to
celebrate the Summer Solstice!  It happens this Friday night at midnight,
at the Towne Theatre in downtown San Jose.  It's free, and there will be
wonderful people there, some of whom you may know; it's always a pleasant
surprise to see people show up "out of the blue" for these shows.  If you
can, I encourage you to attend!  Welcome the summer of '96 :)

Peace,

crash at a friends for right now but it only temporary.
     
I work in San Jose and willing to live anywhere in the area. I am 23 looking 
for someone that is responsible but yet likes to party and have a good time. 
I have a steady job and open to anything. As I said before I have been out of 
the scene and I want to come back. If anyone has anything or any ideas please 
let me know.You can email me privatly.
     
Thanx,
nikki

I don't know if it's changed, but Circuit City used to sell them for $399 
without needles and cartridges..

I think they meant the transmission theatre which is in SOMA.  I do not
remember the exact address but it is listed in the sfweekly.

Although I won't be doing my radio show tonight (I'll be spinning for the
Solstice party in the Sierras), my competent replacement will be giving
away a pair of tix to both the Loop Guru and Underworld/Orbital/Spacetime 
shows.  Interested (and poor) persons listen up :)

Thursday night
90.7fm KALX Berkeley
9:30pm-midnight
Aurora Borealis

And if you miss your chance Thursday, there may also be some tix given
away between noon and 3pm tomorrow on Alice Underground's show.

Just sitting here at my desk thinking, "Why the hell didn't I go to that
Stereolab show in April?"  I must have been smoking crack or something to
miss it.  Did any of you groovy SFR-types happen to catch it?  If so, what
was it like?

As long as I'm talking about totally non-rave related music, if anyone else
out there besides me is interested in His Name Is Alive (some of you might
have heard of them if you have the Ambient Extractions 2 cd), they have a
flexi-only 7" that is in this month's issue of _Warped Reality_.  If you're
interested, let me know and I can give you the ordering details (mag and 7"
together are $4).

Mr. Jake,
Who may need to start begging on Haight St. to come up with enough money to
buy HNIA's new ep

I got mine at Whole Earth Access for $359 including cartridges

and say, a huge wall of speakers,

I had just hopped in my 1968 Datsun Roadster Convertible, with the most
beautiful woman on earth next to me, AKA Ahnon.  I reached for the tuner knob
on my stereo to find:
A nice smooth flowing daydreamy ambient pulse at 88.1 FM, lovely but not
quite right, I moved up to 92.5fm to find groovey ambient trip hop, a little
further at 97.3 I found Beautifully vocal house.  Just when I hit the coast
and the roads started to wind, Ahnon turned to to 100.5 where we found a nice
driving deep house sound, but that wasn't enough! I need 103.1, they were
playing the sweetest goa I ever heard! !/2 hour of that and I was ready for
...  you get the idea.
And that was just FM

I called the Troc a short while ago and they said there are not many
remaining tickets for the show.

If you wish to avoid BASS, you can purchase tickets at Reckless Records on
upper Haight or at Record Finder. Tickets are also available at the Troc
when the doors open at 8:00.

Chemical Brothers go on at 9.

See you there!

Oh so true.

Alot of people aren't willing to drive up or down the coast. Very few are
those; who are willing
to drive to Sacto or even the Sierras (well worth it) to go to a party, no
matter how good it is
or unlikely it would be to be busted.

You just don't have alot of close, not-likely-to-be-busted-or-harrassed
spaces out there where
the population is so dense and oft patroled.

If you really want that fuzzy vibe party...you gotta do the camping
thing...Can anyone say TF.

Good day,

Hadn't been to the Lounge in a month or so.

It had all of the main components to be a really cool midweek after hours
club. Nice sound 
(even cloth soud baffles on the ceiling, to prevent that harsh bounceback
effect) ,comfy lounge
 booths and chairs, $2 pints of Guiness, and happy raver type people.

But the music had lacked any real inspiration on the nights that I had been
there (can't speak
for other nights). Wow what a difference! Conrad and Biojeff threw down
last night.

First time I've heard progressive house and trance intermixed for hours
here in Sacto. Most
of Sacto just doesn't get this stuff. Hard house and lots O beats are the
main diet ravers
 sustain themselves on.

I'M A TRANCEHEAD!

Sacramento's conservative (Gotta have 8 hours sleep) mentality usually
empties most of a room
long before the last call at clubs, but wed. had about 20 or so out dacing
past 2 am. Many
 others were still hanging out in booths talking to their friends.
   
For a club, especially in Sacto, this has a really nice vibe to it. I think
I'll try and make it out
 there more often.

So if your on the list, and want see the face behind the machine; mail me
about a wed. and I'll
make it a point to be there.  

Same Bat Time...

Hey, if any of you sent me a private email on (knucklehead@email.org) after
2pm yesterday can you forward it to the email account. I came in this
morning to find my other account had NO mail in it. That's wrong. It should
have at least 50 in it.  Thanks

Oh...it was a dream ..ok
All I ever seem to get is K-bloody-fog or live 1-oh-british-indie band-5. 
Q. Why are there no pirate dance stations. Anyone interested in getting
something
going or have any broadcast, technical experience ?
What are the laws like in the US regarding pirate broadcasts, All i know is
what i saw 
in that movie "Pump up the volume".
Yeah man, lets get together and put a big sfraves transmitter on the top of
Twin peaks !
Is this feasable ?

Ok, sorry for dissin K-fog, they're not the worst. And Live 105 is ok in
small doses. I mean I like a lot of the music they play, but why cant they
see that 
dance music is as relevant as Nirvana, Beck, the Beastie boys, etc., ?
As for 90.5, should i be able to, pick this up in the berkeley
area...sitting at my pc.....
.....using a walkman ? Share your radio reception experiences with me. Please !

Also...continuing the radio thread...does anyone know some shows worth
checking out
in San Francisco ? Are there any pirates such as radio free Berkeley that
play Techno/house ?

Happy Summer Solstice to all!  Let's make the most of the summer that's
finally here, both within our beautiful scene and in other aspects of our
personal lives.  It's gonna seem like it'll last forever, but we all know
that it will be over too soon.  Appreciate it while it lasts, and
appreciate each other always.

Much love and hunger for phat summer parties,

It's funny, but as a Bay area resident and eager Burning Man participant, I
almost look forward to the end of summer, for in the former I anticipate
the beautiful weather (not that it sucks now ;^), and in the later the
beautiful experience....

I'm sure we'll be occupied until then though....

Peace!

in this case...as it were at the gathering...we usually decide wehter to
use the rite side of the turntables/dj area, or to find a pseudo rfs. by
this i mean that when you walk into the room and face the dj, thre should
be (or were at the gathering) a set of speakers at the rite side in the
far back. so that became our "rfs" for the nite. like i sad..in cases like
these we kinda play it by ear. ;)

I had the same thing happen to me the other day when I posted to sfraves (at
least I think it was from her...it was a hazy day).  It said the mailbox was
full or something like that.  That was the only time it happened, so this is a
test to see if it happens to me again (maybe she's on the list and all mail to
her is getting bounced back - did someone already suggest this?  Only problem
with that logic is that it should happen to everybody...)

Are _all_ your mails getting returned, or just the ones to or cc'd to the list?

i seem to remember hearing about the feds starting to come down hard on
pirate stations..  will probably worsen if the public airwaves get auctioned

I think she's on the list and her mailbox is full.  The mail's not making
it to her box. Often schools' limits
to mailbox sizes are _much_ smaller than commercial providers, especially a K-12
school, and if she's getting all the sfraves mails, and maybe isn't checking
them...Hey school may be out and maybe their sys-admin sucks.
	Anyway, the only problem with this is that most/all people subscribed
should be getting these mails bounced back.  So I'm probably wrong :)  Maybe
the gremlins are only after you and me...
	In any case, I would say our list-keeper might want to remove her from
the list, maybe after contacting her.  She hasn't posted to say "Hey
it's me!!"... 

Ahhh,
-mike

I know lots of ravers who are enthralled with aliens.  I am one of them 
and if you are like me, you can hardly wait for Independance Day to come 
out.  Well, I found their official website, and there is all sorts of 
interesing things on there like a screen saver that you can download.  
Anyways, I thought I'd share that with you all.  www.id4.com

Well, I guess it's an interesting subject. If you're into Aliens and such
then you;ll love this site
dedicated to the Roswell incident and all things extra-terrestrial.
http://www.execpc.com/vjentpr/jroswell.html#Images

Well of course the reason so many ravers are entralled by aliens is because
many eons ago
a race of hunonoids crash landed on our planet after their ship the SL1200
ran out of 
repetitive beats. They wore shiny silver suits and communicated via hugging
and water sharing.
These people - the Ravengi - made their home on this new found idyllic green
planet but were forced to live underground for many years whilst waiting for
the technology of their host planet
to mature. Then one day in Detroit in 1985, one of their number, Juan Atkins
produced a song :
"UFO",  and the rest is well, history..........

 I hope I did this right?!?>

         So I just started dancing n all a few months ago. I always new about
"raves" but  I just never had friends willing to go. Plus I had a girlfriend
(that probably wouldn't let me) and I had no clue how to dance (not like I do
now though). 
        From what I know, those were the good times. My sister and her
friends were always out all night and I had no clue where they went. Just
lately my sister told me about all of these things she did. She told me about
huge parties that were in an old drive in parking lot where people could play
nintendo up on the screens. They had killer music then, and we do now, but
the music was soon adopted by radio stations like wild 107 and others. 
         Things like this made "Raves" too popular. Hell. . . cool world had
someone passing out flyers to people leaving my high school parking lot after
school. People thought that they were all cool n all cuz they "Raved". The
next thing you knew. "Raves" were turning into a big drug fest where people
thought they had to do drugs, because that's what they thought "Raving" was. 
           Now I can't help but hate all of those people who shouldn't be
there with us. All of those guys who lean against the wall trying to look
hard. All of those jocks who go because they either think that there'll be an
"E" orgy, or they think that some chick on "E" is gonna de-virginize them. I
mean. . . the last party I went to, there was a fight!!!
I have never seen that before. My sister has never seen it happen. Neither
has her friends. "Raves" are turning into the popular "scene" for druggies,
drunks, and porn-stars.
           I'm not saying that "E" or Acid is bad. I'm just saying that
people who go to raves thinking they are supposed to get high just have the
wrong idea.
          Maybe I'm just getting upset about a good thing turning bad. 
          I don't think that there's any way to stop this from happening.
There really isn't.  Too many people want to make too much money out there.
That just sucks!
          Seriously speaking, we should be careful of who we tell about our
love to. You wouldn't tell a rapist where a school full of young, christian,
hard-bodied women was. . . would you? You have to keep it alive. Don't kill
it. Don't let it die. Just keep it happy and everything will be just fine.

Well, I just got back from the Trocadero. My sentiments are with those
fellow ravers who stay away from clubs: I just got wind of what I had been
missing.

The crowd was largely devoid of vibe. There was a huge pack making vain
attempts to dance on the floor, and some truly wacky fashion statements. The
real party was happening upstairs. A few whisps of vibe wafted through the
area, disguised as pot smoke. Clubbers smoke way too much, compared to
ravers. Ah, I complain too much...back to the review.

The DJ's sucked big time. One of them even complained about not having a
monitor to mix with. The evening started with mostly gabber and jungle, then
turned to some house, and aimed towards technoland (i.e. Kraftwerk) when
they mercifully stopped.

The Brothers finally made it to the stage around 10:30. They started in for
just a few moments, when technical difficulties killed their set. After some
futzing around, the Brothers finally "worked it out", and started in. WAY to
much bass -- I mean, my throat was hurting from the bass action. The sound
was very distorted.

One of the sets they played was composed of the first few tracks of their
"Exit Planet Dust" CD, in exact order. The tunes sounded almost identical to
the CD. These guys ought to take some lessons from Gary Clail, the guru of
live mixing (check out some of the early Tackhead albums -- the stuff he did
10 years ago make this duo sound like amateurs by comparison).

Well, enough venting for now. Hope everyone enjoys the big show in Big Bear
tomorrow. I may end up heading over to Sunset on Sunday, then on to the
Fillmore on Monday, to get my rave appetite filled for the weekend.

P&L,
-G-

P.S. I finally bought my first PC, after sticking with employers' and
university eqipment all these years. I'll be tending to this page from home
mostly, with occasional peeks at work. [THX1138, if you think Windows '95
sucks for system administration and setup, you should try Windows NT -- an

I understand how you might feel about this. You've come to realise the these parties and 
the ritual of dance mean more to you now because of the good times you've had and the 
wonderful memories from it that you carry with you. But when you see things that
disturb or make you angry like fights, people completely off their heads from 
drugs, or people who seem to not understand why or what it's all about i.e. 'jocks', you 
must allow them the same opportunity to learn from these events as you have. As we all 
have. The people attending these events make up a variety of backgrounds, cultures, 
lifestyles, and ideas. To give them the chance to learn from out-moded behaviors and 
thoughts, to explore the possibilities of new, more creative ways of expression, and to 
be in an environment conducive to change. The dance, the music, the people are those 
forces of change for even the most stubborn of temperment. It will be a struggle not to 
get angry over 'something good turning bad' but remember that these are learning 
experiences for everyone and perhaps with compassion for others, understanding of 
differences, and living life as the 'example' rather than as a 'reaction' -- we can all 
influence positive changes in the world around us. This is what actually keeps the scene 
alive as well the rest of humanity. Subside the fears and the anger, embrace the love 
and warmth of what we all share -- Life.

Peace be with always,
Tex

You know for the life of me I can't figure out why anyone would want to 
drive several hours out in to the middle of nowhere, leaving any vestige
of civilization, into heat, dust, mud, without any place to take a proper 
bath, and with a bunch of like-minded people who are similarly off their 
collective rockers. Ooohhh I can't wait! :-)

[ to sfraves list ]

 Thanks to Claire , Andrew , John Carel, and everyone else who organized
the wonderful LIGHT Solstice event at the "emergency" Point Molate site
yesterday! Despite a rough start due to getting kicked out from the 
original Oakland site, the crew got things packed, moved, and set up in 
great time!

 Some memories -
* Mighty Dog! : There was this black and grey hound that was totally 
  obsessed with a black driftwood 2"x4"x5' plank. If anyone threw the
  plank into the cold cold bay, that mutt would throw himself out into
  the water after it. He(she?) would drag the damn board all about, pawing
  at it and growling and barking at its toy.

* Water guns! : With little blue handpistols and larger mini-soaker rifles.
  Despite the chilling breeze, some folks actually got into shootouts!

* Nice people! : Met some new folks , and put more faces to email names.
  Dance area density got to optimum around 7:30PM. Good feelings all
  around.

 Someone please post the sequence of DJs.

Okay everybody! It's time to go off tonight!!!!

I hope to see all of you at Sankofa! I'll be the the one
with an undeniable glow of postive energy shootin' vibe
out of my fingertips to everybody! I'll also have my big
ass Mickey gloves that I got at Disneyland last week!

I still have a handful of SFraves laminates. So find me if 
you want one. I'm always nearby R.Lunatic who plans to 
seriously light up the dance floor like Hyakutake so watch out!

PLUR,

Intelligent thinking (is that redundant?) on the part of the Gateway crew
yesterday: while most parties at that park have the DJ table set near the
parking lot, the light crew put the decks near the water, which made for a
much nicer view for the dancers--instead of looking at parked cars as we
danced around, we all got to face the water and watch the sun go down.
  It was *so* much better that way... Sunset organizers, please take note!

see you all out there,
Timothy

I like Wild 107.

I tried to get into the stompy stompy party
last night but had forgot my i.d.  I tried to
bribe the doorman thinking I had some small
shot at this with it being past bar time and 
all but had no luck.  

he was very nice about it, though.
Did anyone go?  Was Derrick May there?

My friend is going to the Pleasuredome tonight.
Be nice to her.  Since we fucked up getting into
Stompy.  She obviously needs to sweat.  

Now, I can't ever keep straight the pleasure dome
and club universe.  They all have men in bubble baths
on glossy flyers.  I imagine the Pleasuredome being like
a largish Endup without as many tables to stand on
and wink at people.

I smuggled a large burrito into the makeout room
and ate it on stage.  I also convinced the national
rep for St Ides Malt Liquor to sponsor a soccer team.
I'm captain.  She said, that along with jerseys, she
would arrange a "special party" in a bar somewhere.
In all seriousness, I'd prefer to throw a malt liquor
soccer rave in a golden gate park.  I've got the corporate
sponsorship now.  SO SPread the Word.  DJ's wanted.
Fuck the aliens.  I want lowriders, graffiti art,
some type of raving wind tunnel - surround sound
house music while you strap in ala tom cruise
all hard bodied out and dangle fly.

I'm not a rapist, and I love girls in catholic
school uniforms.  Put her on a swing in cole valley.
It's a major fucking fetish of mine.

amout of time at Mills College in Oakland (where I go 8 months out of the
year) and bopping around Berkeley and SF.
I can totally relate to Eric P. Peterson's hunger for some good summer
parties.  Last year was an explosion of fun for me at Sunsets and other
outdoor celebrations.  It ended with a blast of a time at Burning Man (my
second year) with wonderful company like Steve, Rick Riffle, fellow new
member Jesse, and about a hundred other kindred spirits.
Last weekend's Orion was a good effort, but was a downer for many of the
people involved (including my little sister who never got there and I who got
there 10min. to shut down). Yesterday's Gateway Light Solstice party was a
(chilly) blast once it finally got settled into a location. . .although Brad
from Consciousness Lab did an awsome set at the (busted) first spot.
I'm looking forward to seeing and meeting you all at parties in the future. .

Tremendously mediocre.  Nothing outright bad, but disappointing all around.
I would have had a much better time listening to a good DJ spinning their
records.  For now, they're definitely a group for the studio--they showed
little capacity to improvise or innovate in a live context, playing most of
their album stuff pretty straight and, in the process, running smack into
the limits of the restricted sonic palette available onstage.  Lacking the
opportunities of the studio for layering and manipulation, they apparently
compensated with overdriven PA rather than working within or around the
limits of the setup, producing a monotonous sound with way too much hiss
and boom, and not enough thump, for my taste.  Not that there weren't any
good bits at all--I enjoyed the ten minutes or so around the time the
visuals shifted from monochrome to color the most--but it was a drag on the
whole, especially after paying $15.  And they only played for an hour or
so.  And, of course, it was at the Trocadero--effing *packed*, as always
(I'm positive they let in more than the Fire Marshal allows for that
space), and packed with a Terminator crowd to boot (Deathguild would have
been tolerable).

Thank god I left and crawled around the corner and up the street to Light
in the Addict, which made my night.  A bit sparsely attended, but all cool
people and all kickass tunes (who was that on from 1-3 or so?).  Took off
around 4 and headed down to warm myself at the BASS fire for a bit, but
despite great spinning the music was a little too head and not enough body
for me, so I moved on down to close things out with Tracy and Rob at Rain
Dance's clifftop solstice celebration.  Nice, but a little too relaxed...I
want to be AWAKENED when the sun's coming up.

Thanks for your ideas. I'm happy that there are other people out there that
feel that way. Sometimes the thought of being "invaded" overpowers the ideas
of being equal with everyone. I almost forgot to think of it that way,
although you kinda lost me towards the end there.

    I am New to the list (1 week) and was attempting to comply with ettiquete
and not post for the obligatory two week break in period when I read the
"Jocks" post.  I have been attending house parties (raves) since '91 and have
been to them in L.A., San Diego, San Francisco,  Sydney Australia, and
Vancouver Canada.  Every scene is a little different as far as attitude is
concerned (San Fran. is the best by far).  What I like about the scene is the
wide assortment of people that attend and the acceptance that is exibited by
(most) people.  The author of "Jocks" seems to be missing this attribute by a
wide margin.  I don't pay much attention to the fashions prevalent at the
parties I usually throw on a pair of jeans and a tee-shirt and my Docs and
go.  I am much more interested in the party than trying to fit in.  I also
stay in shape.  And when I tire of dancing or overheat sometimes I even lean
against a wall to watch everyone enjoy themselves (what a horrible crime).
 Could I be one of the people the author has such a problem with?  I thought
the rave scene was beyond labeling people by their appearance only.  This is
high school mentality.  I am drawn to raves as a philosophy major because of
the good emotions and attitudes radiated by my fellow human beings regardless
of their color, sexual orientation, or fashion sense.  Violence at raves of
course is intolerable but I must say it is an aberration (except maybe in
L.A.).  I would like to extend an invitation to the author to go to a party
with me and maybe he will understand how off base he is.  In fact I would
like to go to a party tonight and my friends are busy with work e.t.c.   What
do you say?

WORD! I had the luck of seeing a Gary Clail and TackHead shows (w/
Andrian Sherwood on  the mix, natch) in London and Bristol back around
88-89 (same year that I discovered "raving" by accident while
vacationing in Ibiza!). Very excellent LIVE shows indeed!

(And, b/t/w the real guru of live mixing behind "Gary Clail" or
"Tackhead" is Adrian Sherwood...)

As someone that got into techno/rave from the industrial/funk side of
things (e.g. Tack>>Head, Fats Comet, Skinny Puppy etc.) I'd have to say
that we haven't necessarily come that great a distance in the last 10
years. And unfortunately, few have been able to transition their studio
based art into live performance (this goes both for techno and rap
too).

PS: no I didn't go to the Chemical Bros show... i don't like the Troc,
and I hadn't heard that many glowing reviews about past Chemical Bros
shows. I like the Chemical Brothers ok, but it's not like they're going
into my personal pantheon of great musicians.

See you all at the Orbital/Underworld show -- I'm expecting it to be good!

PS: also coming up and hopefully a good "funk" show -- The Meters at
the Fillmore. Hope they got the original lineup. I've heard talk that
Leo Nocentelli (guitarist) and George Porter (bass) have gone their
separate ways and are fronting their own bands. Hopefully Art Neville
(keyboards, yeah, it's the Neville Brother's Art Neville) and one of
the usual lineup of funky New Orleans drummers (e.g. Russel Battiste)
will be there. Anybody know for sure?

While I don't know a heck of a lot about rap, I find this comment a 
little odd. Didn't most rap start on the streets?

Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com

I've been thinking for a while that this scene needs something to shake it
up. Something people can love or hate but not ignore. Even the music's gone
tepid, it seems, so as to lull people gently through an e trip chosen with
great discretion and care. I could be wrong, of course, but I think that -
with the exception of Archimedes - no one has ever come to great insights
while in a bubble bath. Most of the UG parties I've been to lately have
been as guilty of this as the commercial ones.

Rabbit in Moon at Sankofa this morning is exactly what we need more of. The
two-man, musician-and-random-freak team was clever, sophomoric, brilliant,
silly, stupid, relentless, endearing, beautiful, and I loved every second
of it. The music itself plodded a few times, but there were some great
moments, not the least of which was a theremin with some phat bass. The
random freak's costumes and props were inspired, I thought. I definitely
want to try the face mask/grinding wheel combo for myself sometime!

I'm sure at least one person was miffed that the all the crowd's energy was
suddenly focused on the stage and not on the crowd itself, but Rabbit in
the Moon clearly took a pathetically limpid commercial event and turned it
on its head. After they closed off their act, the next DJ (who was??) took
the energy and ran with it, throwing down some of the harder tracks I've
heard in months. When we left at 6AM or so, the place was as populated as
it was at 2:30, and was going off in a much bigger way.

So now my golden rule of "an event's worthwhileness is in inverse
proportion to its cost" is shattered.

No, buddy. You're not one of my "jocks". I'm basically talking about the
people who go, (who just usually seem to be jocks), that go to stare at the
"freaks", pick up on chicks, get drunk, and maybe get in a fight or two. I've
met waaaaaaay too many of these people and basically, they're the only type
of people I don't really like. Thanks for your opinion.

My night was killer. I saw you and your friend (which is which), the one with
the Dr. Seuss hat, and the one with the Mickey gloves. My girlfriend pointed
you out from talking to you at Madness and then you came over by the rolling
door in the semi-chill room with a few other guys. Me and Lacy were sitting
on a rug sort thing against the door and she said something about that guy
next to us with the mickey gloves. Wierd.
Sorry I didn't say hi. 
      Glad you had fun. I danced half to death and loved it. My girlfriend
had a good time. Saw one of my friends girlfriends with another guy AGAIN.
Accidentily whipped a few hundred people with my chain (sorry people). Just
hung around with a bunch of hyper chicks all night. (What could be better?).
      I thought the night was gonna turn ugly when packs of esse's , vatos,
paragraphs, and whatever started cutting in fron of everyone in line. But I
guess there really weren't any problems. 
      Sankofa was cool. They should have had more doors open. And did you
ever go into that bathroom by the chill area??? Damn. . . I started going in
but it was hard to breath, or even see in there. The cleanest area was on the
pavement out by the porta-things. I just danced all night and watched out for
my girlfriend and her friends. 
Had fun!!!
               See ya.
      Aryck.

The dj's have the power to give you a good trip, to make you lose your mind,
to get energy, or to fall asleep. Wierd how music can effect us these ways.
(why doesn't my home stereo do this). I started getting tired of all of the
slow parts in the mix. But some of the faster parts raged. I swear. . .
everytime the song "came up" again, people just suddenly appeared out of
nowhere and started dancing. Then it'd fade again and everyone would
dissapear to somewhere?

Hey SF Ravers,

Sunset has just been busted at the Berkeley Marina.  People are in the

For more interesting stuff there is this late night talk show program which 
is on the am dial 1500 from 1-5:am called "Coast to Coast" with Art Bell.  
This guy broadcasts out of Pahrump, NV and talks about alien sitings and 
other strange occurrances. Currently he's discusssing the "Arizona Abuduction 
Case" and the "Brazil UFO Sightings".  His website is 
<http://www.artbell.com/>....truly trippy with downloadable pictures of

prehistoric vampire bat like creature that has been attacking livestock in 
Argentina.  

Have fun,

Well, Sankofa went off like CTD-Zine said! Music was kinda tranc-e and 
hard to dance too. But there was some good break beats! The lighting 
was superb, just like the flyer said. Lights were bright as f*ck! Now, 
the stage acts... AWESOME!!!! one point where this person dressed up in 
an armored suit was standing on stage with a cricular type disk sander, 
sanding his armored head and blew sparks all over the place. That was 
amazin'. 

The only flaw.... THE LINE WAS WAY TOO DAMN LONG!!!! We were about 20 
feet from the door in line and it took over a half hour to get inside. 
AAAKKKK!!!

n-E-ways... overall the party was good, vibe was OK, and music was OK. 
The crowd I was hangin around made the party worthwhile. 
                =)~

Hope to see more SFravers in the upcoming parties!

BTW! I just want to contact the person who handed me the flyer for 
"NATURAL" while I was in line. Please e-mail me if you get this 
message.

We had a pretty fair start for audio.cafe last Wednesday night at the
Paris Theatre in Portland.  I think nearly 100 people came through at
some point, though some only stayed briefly.  Another one scheduled
for July 3, we'll go a little later due to it being the start of the
long holiday.  DJs will be J Mystic (Jeremy), RobP and myself, as it
currently stands.  

Yesterday we had wonderful time at Rooster Rock state park at the
mouth of the Columbia Gorge doing the second Saturdaze event.  The
weather was changeable but mostly very nice.  We set up in a park area
between I-84 and the river, right at the foot of the bluff that forms
Crown Point, one of *the* scenic vistas in Oregon.  We had a nice view
of a small waterfall off the cliff, and the park virtually to ourselves.
The rangers came by and visited, said we really shouldn't be doing this
but turn it down, so we did and everyone was happy.  Not much attendance,
about 30 in all I think, but a really nice one.  As for music, I started
followed by Dubs, Jeremy, Rob and Randy.  

I went to the Mecca party co-sponsored by XLR8R and Prescription Records
last night.  Amazingly enough, it was at the old Neighbors of Woodcraft
hall (now called the "Tiffany Center" for reasons I do not understand).
I say amazingly because that is where I did the final concert of my
promotion career in 1982, featuring the as-yet-unknown Nu Shooz.  
It's a nice and kind of stuffy place as far as ambience with a big
hall where the main sound was.  Up on the stage were Mike Stevens,
Diz, Johnny Fiasco and Rawno, and upstairs in a side room were the
trip hop/ambient/dub/whatever toonz -- Professor Andrew Smith at the
mixing console when I visited.  I would estimate maybe 500 or 600 paid
admissions, which means the promoters probably took a bath, the place
was really about half full.  The sound and lights were adequate but
not great.  The playing was reasonably interesting, though I can't tell
you how many people told me that Derrick Carter was spinning the set
before Johnny Fiasco's.  The man's name is Diz and he was doing it well.

I had a moderately good time, and I suppose that $20 for this lineup
and a nice place is comparable to $13 for a dirty warehouse, but there
just didn't seem to be much excitement about the whole affair.  Then
again, that's about par for the large gatherings.

I take it you don't like the great outdoors very much.

Most people are drawn to this event, and nature in general, due to this
lack of civilization. There is something primal
about having to survive on what you have brought into this desolation.
Black Rock also forces you to focus upon
yourself and those who have accompanied you there, for there are none of
life's daily trials to distract. In fact, there
is nothing at all that has not been lugged there by some individual, for
some purpose of survival or entertainment.
I feel that this focus, though short lived, is much needed in many people's
lives. I often leave the wilderness with
a new found perspective on my life or something that has been troubling me.
I also believe it is healthy to make a 
connection with nature; for we are all natural beings. 

Not to mention the sheer abundance of creativity that is so much a part
this particular gathering. Wow!


Take care,
                  Jason

Hmmmm.... where do I start...

Got in for phree (thank God) and went in to check out the space.  I don't 
think I could actually *see* the other side of the warehouse.   It was 
HUGE!  This was around 1pm, and there was someone playing Josh Wink's 
remix of Moby's "Bring Back my Happiness"... when the song hit the break, 
the bass was booming and it really sounded like muddled garbage.

The DJs that followed... Jungle - didn't work, and morning trace garbage 
for awhile... Then DJ Dan went on and played a boring, uninspired set.  
Rabbit in the Moon was cool, although a lot of it was DAT.  I fell asleep 
near the end of their performance, and woke up to Doug E. Fresh and MC 
Ricky D :) and noticed Terry Mullan was on!

Well, I think they did a pretty good job with everything, although the DJ 
lineup was in about the worst order possible.  I still had lots of fun 
(got my sfraves laminate finally :) met TONS of cool people and somehow 
made it out alive.  They only needed about 2000 people to break even, and 
they probably had about 4 or 5?  Really, if they could've filled the 
party earlier and put the right DJs on at the right times that could've 
been one of the best parties of the year.  Too bad my girlfriend wanted 
to leave in the morning and I missed most of Terry's set.  That about 
sums it all up! :)

You know, I knew I should have put the following disclaimer when I posted 
my comment about Burning Man:

For the humor-impaired: The above was a *JOKE* I had what can only be 
described as a transendental experience at Burning Man, and look 
very, very, very, very, very, very(you get the point) forward to going again.

Hi everybody-

 I just wanted to know how many of you are going to be at the 
Orbital/Underworld show tonight.  Come and say Hi! to me.  Just look for a tall 
guy, 6'9", wearing a black shirt and enjoying himself.  I'd love to meet some  
fellow sfravers.

Hi Reagan et al,

Sunset was definitely purrrty great yesterday... I had a blast!  Point
Molate was even more beautiful than usual (crystal clear across the bay,
sunset went all red and purple, ahhhh).  There really was NO reason the
cops had to break it up at the marina, but luckily almost everyone showed
up at the new location.  A very friendly and happy crowd.  We were there
'till it ended around 10! :) :) 

Mantra was also really great last night.  Now *that* is my kind of trance. 
Fast, fast, fast.  :) :) :)  If only I could've stayed past 1am....it
seemed to be getting even better.  The organizers do a really great job
with this one... nice decorations, lots of black lights, water galore, and
GREAT MUSIC.  I like the space at cat's grill too. 

Coming soon -- my web page with pix from new moon, the last two sunsets,
and more.  :)

Hugs,
Paul

Hello and welcome, and thanks for sharing your perspectives with us!  It
looks to me like everyone on this list is in agreement with the things you
expressed in your post.  The author of "Jocks" understands, too, but seems
brought down by all the negative elements present in our scene.  Well, we
need to lift him up and support him, as well as the rest of us, and
preserve what we love so much.

I am extremely excited about this little shindig tonight.  Attached to a 
pair of silver, glow-in-the-dark sneakers, will be little ole' me!!  
Hopefully, I'll be dancing madly.  I'll be on the look out for the tons 
of sfravers there.  I hope we don't miss one another!!

Nancy will be with me, most likely.  She is very sad she isn't able to be 
on sfraves anymore, so come give her big smiles to let her know we miss 
her philisophical/political meanderings!!  :)

I am glad to hear that some people had a good time at Sankofa.  I 
contemplated going, but after I called the voice mail on Saturday night, 
I decided to stay home.  The voice-mail was pretentious and all about how 
we should just LOVE going to their parties.  Then the woman made (my 
impression) a sarcastic joke about "bring your harmony with you", then 
she and her friends busted out laughing in the back ground.  Whatever. 
I'll save my money for something more worthwhile.  I feel no need to 
support a group who thinks I should be dying to go to their party because 
it is the biggest baddest shit around town.  Sorry, I'll pass. 

(excuse my frustration, but I felt patronized by the voice-mail.  hmm... 
great PR)

even better is Art's "DreamTime", Sundays 7-10pm on 640 am, it's more
alien-centric than "coast to coast".  It's fun to put on while driving
home from sunset...

:)  There's a new 12" on Strictly Rhythm by Chupacabra (actually a
pseudo-nym for Armand Van Helden of "Witch Docter" fame), it even has a
little picture of one of the sleeve.  I'm tempted to send Art a copy... :)

Sunset at Pt. Molate was really good-sized and everyone was in good 
spirits!

Don't worry about it KaySEE... I wouldn't have gone if I wasn't going to 
get in for free.  They could have charged $20, or even $15 and STILL MADE 
MONEY.  I just wanted to be able to see Terry and Rabbit in the Moon...

Sunset started out beautifully at the Berkeley Marina.  Nature,
sunshine, house music, ahh.  Tone gave me the Haiku trophy;
the awards ceremony was low-key mainly because I couldn't fit my
acceptance speech into 5-7-5 syllables.  Rick bestowed a
Consciousnes Research Labs tape on me.  Haven't listened to the whole
thing yet, but we like it so far; nice relaxing ambient
with just enough quirky sounds and subtle rhythms to keep it 
interesting.  Thanks! 

We were riding the vibe nicely, but fate had other plans.  Something 
about a rookie cop who didn't know that it was cool to
just look the other way.  He/she Called back for
instructions, and well, once you have to ask...  This is what I
heard, anyway.  Hope we'll be able to return in the future.

We felt kinda down at that point - a close friend of ours is sick
and dying - so we went down by the water and thought about him and
stuff.  Finally decided that dancing at Pt. Molate would be the healthy
thing to do.

There, DJ Unknown was spinning some glurpy acid with the kind of
sounds that every kid with hir first analog synth loves to make
in the bedroom.  Kinda fun for a bit, but didn't really create
the kind of groove I like to dance to.  Other's were digging 
it though.  The sunset was very Orangey and beautiful.  By the time
Garth came on, bodies were smothering Pacific's sound system, so it
was hard to really get into it.  Nevertheless, it was great to be out
with the tribe.

Oh, yeah, got our tickets for next week's Sunset boat party.  The last 
one was completely nuts.  Sadly, Freedom will not be at the Livermore
motorcycle racetrack.  Will still be outdoors though, and Martin
promises the same organ-rupturing sound system as last year.  The
vibe might be better at Harmony or whatever that weekend, but I just 
can't resist the big-killer-sound-system-outdoors thing.  Unfortunately,
ever since we watched that silly movie, Braveheart, we can't think about
this party in quite the same way - thanks to the final scene where
Mel Gibson responds to being disembowled by shouting "FREEDOM!!!!".

:)

After a long meandering walk through Berkeley, we arrived at the very 
beautiful Berkeley Marina and Sunset, with four Rave Virgins in tow. 
Things were perfect at the Marina: a nice-sized crowd, a great view of 
the sun shimmering on the bay, the city, the hills, and stuff. I brought 
my bubble machine along and managed to get it working for about five 
minutes before it died from too much use. Met Justin and it was very good 
to see him. Then, three of the Rave Virgins decided to leave and that was 
sad. Then the ugly Berkeley Police came and stopped it all, beacuse of 
lack of $10 permit. I tried offering a cop the 10 bucks, but he called my 
clueless and explained to me how I need to give the $10 to someone else. 
Then another cop started babbling how he was around in the sixties', and 
how they had free concerts at Haight, and how we should get some corporate 
sponsorship, and how there was never going to be a Rave Party without 
E. So Justin, Carlos, Ruth, and I went to a really great place to eat in 
Emeryville before arriving at the backup location at Point Molate, which 
was also beautiful, and filled with many many people. Met Robert and a 
lot of other sfravers, and had a great time and enjoyed the red and 
orange and purple sunset. I was very glad Ruth, the first-time-raver (but 
not the last) enjoyed herself; she had a great time dancing and drawing. 
Too bad the others decided to leave early, but that was somewhat 
expected. see everyone at the obital/underworld show tonight.

Hello dear friends!

Seems like every time I talk about raves with my roommate, John, he comes
to the same conclusions.  He says that if I'm not there (at a party) to
either make money or meet women, then I'm wasting my time.  The last time
we talked about this, he said that I shouldn't spend my time hanging around
"teeny-boppers bouncing around on e."  Can you believe that sh*t?  He says
that I should be spending my time in the (get this) clubs around downtown
San Jose, meeting women.  Just the thought of that sends off all kinds of
warning bells and whistles in my mind!
I asked John if he'd ever been to a rave, to which he of course replied
"No."  I said "Then you're not in a position to make these kinds of
judgments."  He agreed with me, but every time the topic comes up, he
launches into the same sermon.  He has no idea of the intense spiritual
fulfillment and the wonderful friendships I find in the course of
celebrating life through dance.  Although I know that I shouldn't let what
he says get to me, it still does, and sometimes it gets me down.  Can
someone, anyone, out there please lift me up?  Can I get a witness?

Love,

Eric

All I can say is that your roommate is a judgemental fool.
I guess that isn't reassuring, but if he is going to be stubborn and make 
accusations about something he knows nothing about, I would just turn the 
other way and cover my ears. He is a jerk for treating you and what is so 
important to you with such flippant disrespect.  People like him rarely 
open their hearts to a different path, so I dunno if you should even try 
(this should depend on how important your firnedship is wiht him).  Never 
compromise yourself, sweetie.  

love,
Amy

you and John are great friends are anything?? But... I wouldn't be too 
concerned with what he thinks about you going to raves or what he 
*thinks* they are about. I've talked with many people who aren't into the 
scene and they have the same opinions. If John isn't willing to give it a 
try, then forget him and just go on your merry way. You'll probaly end up 
having enough fun for the both of you;).
                         just my 2 cents-
                        Reagan

WOW!!!!!!!!!this was the most massive I am still so spun from the whole
thing...It all started with lunch with my friends Dave (on this list)
willow the goddess and my bro phillip at lunch on friday...we started tlk
ing about the party and decided what the hell...we gotta go. so I took
daves car to the shop...and we found out it had a busted head OH NO! then
my bro got fired from his job that afternoon so he could go!! so we rented
a car and left from berkeley around 8:00 pm, arrived in LA around
1:00...Dave drives like a madman...110 mph the whole way! after finding a
wonderful inspiring friend of willows to crash at at 3:30 we partied with
her all night and day while picking up goddies for the party! I got
really baked that day and took a walk around venice beach with my
bro...what a trip! LA is the strngest f*****g place! we were wearing
cutoffs and t-shirts and we felt realy out of place! smoe guy walkee
by us and said "your not in kansas anymore" HUH!!!!! I trhinki there
is some rule in LA that you are not allowed to go in publilc unless
you have fresh undies cologne and look absolutely marvelous! but
anyways lorie hooked us up rightously with the best juice shakes in the
whole world before we left. hopefully she will be coming up here real soon
so we can show her the SF scene!...so we left around 6:00 to the
party...on the way up the mountain we picked up four ravers who had lost
their spaceship due to technical difficulties...the vibe was tertiffic,
everyone was so excited and happy...we finally got into the place and it
was a wonderful site...the main laser was shooting all over the main stage
spelling out gigantically the words ORGANIC and other cool
patterns...about this point things start geting a litle blurry...meat beat
was kind of weird...their industrial roots were showing through...we
walked around and danced and talked and wandered all over ...there were
these glasses that you put on "brain food" that blink lights and for a
buck you could sit and trip on them al\s long as you wanted shit...what a
mind trip!!!!....finally the ORB came on...that was the highlight just
pure mind fucking...
	the sound system was teriffic, the only annoying thing was the
radio guy coming on and introdicing orbital..."HI is everyone having fun
YEAH...IM balah blah from blah blah blah radio station balh blah blah
blah" and the mostly on the main stager the music seemed to me like more
listen and be awed more than we are going to build this thing until the
whole valley exsplodes in mad dance! kind of like a cross between
lollapalooza and a rave.
	to end the story the party ended around six and we partied in the
lot until around 9:00 and then gave this poor fella a ride to la because
his ride left him htere! but he was such a cool guy really styled us out
the whole way (N20) back to la! then we drove home...got stuck in traffic
for about 2 hours and made it back to berkeley around 10:30 last night!!!
3 hours of sleep the whole weekend!!!!
	we all had the time of our lives!!

Hi everyone!!

I was just wondering if anyone planned to go to the Crash Worship performance
coming up this week?  I thought I might drop by and check it out.  I also
would like to know what to expect at the show since I have never heard or
seen them before.  Everytime someone mentions them on the list I was usually
intriqued so I want to see what it's all about.

Thanks,
       Megan              Czefir

There will be a general meeting for anyone who wants to get involved in the
second BBQ & Beats party.  Tim and I will be points of contact for this
one, but we need input and help to pull it off.

Tim kicked out a date, but we might rethink that, nothing is set in stone yet.

Anyway, the meeting will be at my house this coming Thursday (6/27).  I
live in Noe Valley, SF, and am accessible by BART or public transport.
Please email me for directions, etc, if you can make it.

Three things that will make this meeting a good thing for you:

1)  You get to see how parties develop from the ground up, including DJ
selection (a fun topic indeed ;^), search for a sound system, and basic
principles in crowd control.

2)  You get to meet my kitten Barb!

3)  You'll be at the source for FnF patches and thus won't have to chase me
at a Sunset (or win a haiku contest) to get yours.  ;^)

Let me know if you can make it.

Tony

P.S. If someone wants to let Leslie know, that would be a good thing...

P.P.S.  This meeting will be BYOB.

AMEN, BROTHER E!

My buddy Sean spouts the exact same crap.  It wasn't until I got a mutual 
friend of ours to go to one and she came back talking about how much fun it 
was that he softened his tune a little.  He's actually considering letting 
us drag him kicking and screaming to one (?!).  I'm SO tired of mainstream 
club crowds.  I like to go to an event with the primary intention of just 
plain having fun.  Then if I meet someone I just happen to want to see again 
outside that venue, that's different, but it's not my primary mission.

Your friend needs to attend a couple of these events, and he needs to adopt 
the correct mindset before going -- that of having fun with like-minded people.

Good luck, my brother in raving...

There's a couple of clubs.

Wed. - The Lounge (at the Red Lyon, Sacramento Inn, off of I80.  Take the
Arden Way exit) (I believe it's 21+)

Thurs - Don't know the name of it, but it's supposed to be a good club.  (On
Broadway at 16th in the Melarkeys building) (Don't know the age)

Have fun.

Rick

It's 18+ now and it's phree! (alcohol vibe)

Real - $6... they usually have at least one out of town DJ.. it's been 
Barry Weaver, Donald Glaude, Eric Davenport, DJ Dan, etc. etc. in the 
last couple of months... good vibe and the alcohol is in the bar half of 
the venue...

Hello everybody-

 Well, two of my friends had to back out of going to the concert tonight, and 
now I'm left with two extra tickets.  If you are interested please contact 
Cassandra at 415-325-5971.  She does not have access to her email account 
(senator@leland.stanford.edu) today, but if you call her she'll be happy to 
help.  See you there!

-Todd

Just don't wear anything that you expect to come out of the show ever
wearing again!  Leave home your neurotic cleanliness hangups and prepare to
have some major fun.  Well worth your time and $$ in my opinion.  Can't go
this time and am very sad.

E,

I dunno Erik.  The ONLY reason that I go to raves is to get loaded out 
of my head and to prey on young, sweet, unsuspecting pieces-of-tail....

J,

Why do the corporate sponsorship thing for Burger King?  Are they paying 
you to wear it?  

Be Cool.  Make your own.

hello everybody-

so that i might redeem myself from my previous organizational blunders
(yosemite trip, etc) and for the love of my fellow cheese-ball ravers
(yaeh!!), i'm inviting everybody who is interested to join me and other
sfravers for a dinner on thursday!

the dinner will be on thursday night, around 8 pm at ebisu sushi on 9'th
avenue and irving in the beautiful inner sunset of san francisco.  so far,
i have several interested people.  we shall bond as a group, do iv drugs
(sorry, wrong mailing list!) and eat good food.  so, anyone who is
interested, e-mail me.  the last dinner we had here was a complete
success, and randall schwartz, the perl guru even showed up!  (no, i'm not
lying. he was there.  it was odd.)

e-mail me if you are interested in coming to dinner!

i love you all-

matt l

The Burger King crown is my trademark.  I haven't gone to a single
underground without one....  it's a good way of helping people remember
me.  And no, I don't eat hamburgers, or beef, or animal meat for that
matter (okay, I'm lying, I eat chicken once in a while.  Tastes like
chicken!  YOu should try it).

Hmm.. Maybe I will check that out with my friend forrest.. First rave thing
I have done since I got here.

Okay, here is the deal.. I will be wearing my massive jacket.  Easy enough
to find me because I will be the only one with a massive jacket..  So if I
am not there cause I am late or what not.. just look out.. I am friendly,
and have no problem with people who I don't know introduce themselves to
me.

SanFran, fun to be here.  Great place..

A little about myself for you kids in Sfrave world.

My name is john, I am from milwaukee.  While I was living in milwaukee (20
years of my life) I got pretty into the midwest rave scene.  Well most of
you will probably go, "pfft, midwest!", but as some of you transplants
know.. the midwest scene is strong and continuously growing.

Milwaukee wasn't a bad place to be.. I mean, shit, Gabber calls milwaukee
home, as well as Drop Bass records, and Massive Magazine.  You have Chicago
2 hours south which is the birthplace of house music and the home of many
famous house labels.  About 6 hours East and around lake michigan you have
Detroit, do I have to say much more.  So I was in the thick of the culture.
Chicago also was Jungle's third town.. Toronto being second, and
Londontown being the home.  So I guess you can see, I was pretty much in
Technoland.

Now I am here, I see a lot of different types of people, a whole new
attitude towards the music.. So forgive me if I seem a bit out of place in
your scene.. But mine was different.. and well, I got to adjust..

While I was in Milwaukee I worked very heavily on Massive Magazine.  Now
you don't know what Massive is, lets just say that it is our equivilent to
XLR8R.  We are working on issue 14 right now, and we have a circulation of
10-15,000 per issue.  The west coast was not a big distribution point for
us because we really didn't know anyone out there.  But now I am here, you
will surely see massive...   We mostly concentrated on the East Coast and
Midwest..  15,000 copies go fast believe me.

Anyways, I started as a designer there, and now I strictly on do the Jungle
section and some web page stuff.  I can't really do much since I am here
now.  Ohh well..

Anyways, there is alittle about me..  See you tonight.. and have a good time..

John aka johnsin massive..

remember jungle...

Does anyone have any tips on getting to the Fillmore via BART?

Or if anyone from Berkeley is going to the show and can spare room
for one other -- I bathe regularly and will help with gas.

Find money and love in a San Jose club? BS! You're roommate is the one
wasting his time! You gotta grab a tube of Rogaine and read the Wall Street
Journal cover to cover. You won't find the right mate till you've made your
first your first million, and you can benchpress twice your weight. Forget
your transcendental experiences, brother, they're all a drug-induced haze.
Once you experience your first IPO, you'll know I'm right. Realize that
country music has changed a lot over the past few years, and you'll be a
much happier person. Really.

     I have recieved much e-mail regarding my first post, including some from
the original author (I must say he has redeemed himself in my eyes).  It'
nice to know there are others out there who feel the same way I do.  Labeling
people by appearance is dangerous business and we all feel betrayed and
misunderstood when it happens to us.  I thought it would be easier to reply
to everyone at once.  You are a great group of people.  Robert- I might be
looking for a party this Sat.  but I prefer them to be indoors.  If anyone
could tell me of a party like the last Down to Earth (good party) I attended
a few weeks ago I would be very interested.  Smaller parties tend to have the
kind of atmosphere I crave.  Thanks all!

I'll be there.  What to expect...hmmm.  It's like being on another 
planet, like being plunged into the frenzied ritual of some alien 
techno-primitive culture from the pages of Heavy Metal.  Imagine the 
savage rites of pre-Christian Europe times an underground voodoo 
celebration plus strobe lights, fog machines, and 10,000 watts of 
electric noise.  Something like that, anyway.

I'm going to crash worship!. 
 
I've heard nothin' but FUCKIN' AWESOME reviews about this band.   They have
a HELL of a reputation at Mardi Gras. 
 
I've never seen their "SHOW", but.... 
 
Last time I was down to Mardi Gras, their show was cancelled by the police
so they proceded to protest by leading a sort of "Running of the Bull"
through the crowded streets of Mardi Gras. 
 
I'll never forget... I was standing on the corner of the Decatur district
and before I know what the hall was going on... I was flattened and almost
run over by a   stampede of fire jugglers, flame throwers and other various
wild costumed individuals parading a chariot which held a mockery of the
mardi gras princess.  He/She was less than appealing... I might add. 
 
Police on foot and horse proceded to chase the growing stampede of Crash
Worship fans and random followers who thought it might be fun to join the
primal race... until finally it ended in a large chaotic celebration of
drumming, performing, yelling, etc. 
 
My friends and I will never forget that!  And I'm goin' tomorrow... 
Anyone want to come with me?

Hi all!

 Just my 2 cents here; Raves are essientially public events. Get used to 
dealing with the public; it is the real world in which we live in. I 
would think that if raves got so exclusive (like a country club or 
republican party) that they would eventually die. Lets face it; one of 
the most appealing aspects of raves comes from other people being there. 
I know I would get bored (quickly!) if I saw the same happy smiley faces 
all the time (happy but bored). I thrive on the challenges in life and 
one of the biggest challenges is (for me) getting along with those who 
are disagreeable to me (for whatever reasons).

 Many of those that some have mentioned as disagreeable (jocks, druggies) 
have some very loveable, endearing qualities. The challenge I take is to 
draw those qualities out of them. Sometimes the best way is by setting an 
example of acceptance and friendly, loving vibes.

 Of course sometimes problems arise when people try to take advantage; 
this why knowing your personal boundries is good.

 I'm sorry if I sound kinda preachy and I don't mean to sound like these 
issues are easy for me. I struggle plenty with rude, inconsiderate folks. 
I just try to learn and gain from any situation I'm in. Sometimes it 
works and sometimes it don't.

Peace out

"Flossie and the Unicorns" and "Quintron the Amazing Spellcaster" to open.
I've never heard of them either.

Actually, I'm not sure if this is a weekly or an every-other weekly, but
it's definitely new, and happening tonight (Tues).  Speakeasy, at the Coco
Club, 139 8th St, off Market.  Shannon, John Howard, Mark Farina, more?  I
haven't been, but I understand they need a show of support to keep the gig
alive in the eyes of the management, so if you want to help the scene, drop
by and check it out.

Cybertribe,

Hi, my name is Marshal Villarosa, but most people know me as Mars.  I 
live in New Jersey about 30 minutes from Manhattan, but I've been out to 
the Bay Area twice in the last two months.  The first time was to spin at 
a party called Lucky Charms that the Bagok Tribe threw, the second time 
was for a business meeting with Pacifc Bell (but got to check out a party 
at People's Park in Berkley and "Dune" put on by Funky Tekno Tribe in 
Oakland).

I'm a systems engineer by day for Lucent Technologies, one of AT&T's 
spinoff companies.  By night, I'm a DJ and rave promoter and have been in 
the rave scene on the East Coast since the Spring of 1992 (Stormrave of 
Brooklyn & Catastrophic of DC).  I've been heavily involved with the 
NE-Raves and NYC-Raves e-mail lists, and I think I know a couple of you 
who used to be out in the NYC area.  I've been DJing since 1990 and spin 
trance which I have just started producing as well.

I love the San Fran vibe, though, and it's been influencing my musical 
tastes and changed my concept of what the rave scene could be like (the 
Organic Party I went to in Golden Gate Park).  I've met some awesome 
people out there, and have really wanted to see them again.  So, with 
that said, I'll be in San Fran this weekend, from Thursday night to 
Sunday night.  I'd love to meet, dance, and share the vibe with you.  
Send me some mail on how we could do that!

Peace, love, and Unity,
DJ Mars - NJ Underground

I wish I'd stuck around for Underworld, but I had to work this morning! 
But Orbital WAS the group I went to see and they were quite impressive.
Dealing the crowd a fine mixture of old and new material they rode
break-beat dragon for what seemed like hours, only letting the energy drop
between songs (which I didn't really like). Kudos to the crowd- I was so
happy to see so many smiling faces on a Monday! 
*sigh* the only drawback was the sound- definately muddled at points and
sometimes lacking the ribcage-rattling bass I crave. But otherwise a fine
Monday night!

Alex-

 My original intention was to also see Orbital.  I figured that Underworld 
would just be an added bonus.  I have since been converted!  Underworld played 
some of the greatest music I've ever heard.  It did seem like alot of people 
left after Orbital played, but for those who stuck around, Underworld was 
top-notch.

-Todd

PS- Work is much more interesting when you have partied all night long, not 
slept at all, and you begin to listen to your Orbital and Underworld CD's with 
a large grin on your face!!!

Good Day Eric,

There is more to life than making money and chasing babes. When the money
runs out and 
the woman leaves you, what do you have left? Yourself and your friends; and
if you've been
good to yourself and them, you are still rich beyond your wildest dreams. 

Take Care,

mmwwrraaa!  thpt..thpt..    Much better.

Sorry about that; I seemed to have put my foot in my mouth again. It
happens from time to time while typing in the wee hours of the morning. I
considered the sarcasm angle. But after reading though the message a second
time, I decided to post a reply conveying my exhaustion inspired thoughts
on the subject anyway, feeling uncharacteristically serious last night.
Knowing that if my perceptions were off, I could always plead stress
induced insomnia. Should have known, with a handle like "Black Adder", it
had to be offbeat humor.


Take Care,
                   Jason

P.S. I'll look for the "   :-)  " in the future.

How can we get it through these people's heads that we don't need or desire
"CORPORATE
sponsorship". This could only bring upon a distortion of what underground
free events have
always epitomized. That if somehow, we took advertiser's money, all would
be licit. As for his
drug reference, I don't believe that E is required to have a good time. The
experience is
what you put into it, not what you ingest. I haven't any fantasies about a
drug free rave 
scene, but I'm tired of people thinking that raves exist for the purpose of
using drugs. Most 
are there to dance and meet people. I think the music and the positive
energy stand on their
own as a creative entity. And we have all seen the effects commercialism
has had on creative 
expression; and it isn't often honorable. 

Be kind to those around you,
                                           Jason

Last night I headed into sf with justin and sami, all prepared to see
Orbital and Underworld with the tickets I won from the cool people at
KALX. We arrived at the fillmore, picked up the tickets and some free
apples, and headed for the dancefloor. A DJ who i didn't recognize was
spinning and a handful of people were dancing, but this being my first
big party in a long long time, i was not concentrating on his set at all.
After adjusting to the space, we met up with some other sfravers..
brandon, christy?, jess, kaySee, nancy.. i'm really bad with names. we 
headed back into the dance area as orbital was preparing to go on. I 
thought Orbital were pretty great untiul I saw them live. Now I
consider them demi-gods. Last night they delivered an absolutely perfect 
set, with the same style of breaks and melodies that that I fell in love 
with several years ago. Orbital still influences a lot of the stuff we 
write and play, and seeing them live with cool projectors and decent 
intelligent lighting was a total trip. I was entirely taken by this band, 
and probably at times forgot to dance, which was ok, because every once 
in a while the club gods would draw near and dance very aggresively and 
break me out of my little trance. Sometimes they would leave to go get a 
drink, but they would make sure to leave their girlfriends behind. "hey, 
see that guy chillin to Orbital? go dance really really close to him". 
but even that was ok, because i was near several list people, who were 
very kind. After Orbital and their encore, justin and i went upstairs, 
got a coffee, and listened to me live ambient performance already in 
progress. of course, like so many other parties, you could hear the bass 
of the main room, but it was ok, i'm used to that now. We made it back 
down right in time for underworld's set and found the other net people 
again. underworld began with intense beats, and everyone was totally 
going wild. but there were way too many people too close to me, and the 
sound was too loud (wasn't smart enough to bring earplugs and they 
weren't smart enough to turn it down a notch, my ears _still_ hurt). i 
couldn't get into their set right away, i suppose i was still in love 
with orbital. someone forgot to hit the 'data screen' button on the sony 
vtr. but after about an hour-and-a-half(?) people started to drift away 
and i had more room and got sucked in to the set and danced and danced 
until after the encore and i was very tired and had to work and headed 
back to berkeley with justin. 

i've been going to one-two parties a day lately, and am totally in love 
with the bay area again. i wish i never had to leave. thanks to all the 
people i've met, those on the list, those who throw parties on the beach, 
those who let me spin records at their parties on the beach, those 
incredible sunsets, and those whose names i always forget. now i'm ready 
for work, and maybe (hopefully) i will see you all the crash worship 
show tonight.

And I was so surprised to see that McDonald's now carries the figures from
the movie "Babe" with its happymeals. Now "Babe" is essentially trying to
tell us that pigs are cute and perhaps we shouldn't kill them like flies.
I guess McDonalds thought, well they didn't have any cows in the movie
so nobody will probably get make the connection that we are selling
dead cows with a cute little piggy. Even more amazing is that apparently
the people who made the movie (and made sure that all pigs involved live
happily ever after) gave them the rights to use the pictures main characters
as advertisement material...

A bewildered,

Frying Dutchman (not even a vegetarian)

P.S. And don't get me started on the ads by Tylenol where people, one day
after knee surgery, are back in the gym, taking pain killers in order to
silence there apparently protesting body. Or buy huge sausages and peppers
and take some mylanta, or whatever, in advance since they already know
that their stomach will upset. Weird...

I think you meant "trans-accidental" didn't you, Mr. "I'm riding my

P.S.  Word is the rave groups are working together, with BM organizers, and
will have a strategic set-up in a circle, 2 miles from central camp, with
the louder systems pointing away from CC.

[ to sfraves and Will Penna ]

 Will those who aren't going to Crash Worship tonight be checking out 
Astral Matrix in Santa Cruz tonight? I'm halfway thinking of going ,
but my back is giving me some pains , so I can't promise to show up.

 Astral Matrix is appearing as part of a weekly called "The Deep" at 
the Palookaville club. I've heard mostly positive things about Palookaville,
and I've been curious about going to their weekly "rave" event.

cows? When I was a wee lad in the early 80's I refused to eat McDonalds
because I thought they made those burgers out of kangaroos.



poor little kangaroos.

Almost forgot! I'd like to know what the list thought of the 2 Junglish
songs Orbital played- sorry, I don't know the names of the songs. Also, did
Orbital seem especially dark last night? a couple songs scared the shit out
of me! ( not that I didn't enjoy them...)

Actually, in the 80's they had the McRib, and they re-release it
periodically. I believe that is pork. Therefore, they may not release that
sandwich again (yeah, right.)

You wake up, it's Monday morning and you are really bummed that reality 
has to set in again.  Damn, you live for the weekends.  Oh well, you make 
the daily trek to your lab.  Hmm... Some exciting stuff, you might get to 
mentor a high school student.  Hmm...cool.  Regular day but, there's 
something different in the air.

The afternoon comes, your friends are calling you at work to find a place 
to meet you at the show.  You sense the anticipation, the excitement, hmm...
You go to your 7 pm meeting, leave early, fight over the car with your 
sister, eat bad food because you can't cook.  Hmm...coffee sounds good 
about now.  You leave the apartment, get gas, think about how dangerous 
your car is getting because you are too lazy to get it fixed.  (Besides, 
you know you should be able to do it yourself!)  Then you are crossing 
the Bay Bridge and watching an 8:30 sunset.  Cool, three sunsets in three 
days; can't beat that.

You look for parking on Geary, oops, missed the turn off.  You find 
parking, just in time to meet your friends at 9 pm at the Fillmore.  Yay, 
said friends are in place.  Plus, added bonus, you meet two new sfravers
(hi Roger and Justin).  Cool dj is spinnning.  Everyone groups up and you 
go to the dance floor to find the right space.  Space is very important 
to you, you need dancing room and a place to hang out!  Said space is 
found.  Orbital comes on.  Wow, ohmigod, this is awesome.  The dance 
floor is packed.  People are sweaty, people are groovin', funky guys are 
on stage with lights on their heads that look like eyes.  The dance floor 
is packed, hot, slick with sweat.

The lights are amazing.  Circular beams of blue and white light look like 
Close Encounters of the Third Kind.  Then the spot lights cease and 
yellow lights are aimed at a giant disco ball that transforms into a 
psychedelic sun.

You're with your best fiends, new friends, boyfriend, and all of them are 
smiling.  What more could you ask for?  Then, Orbital is finished.  The 
two smiling, groovin' guys on stage who entrance the crowd say farewell.  
The floor clears, black lights come on.  A dj spins trance.  You love the 
fact that the frequency has hit your bpm level and you now have room to 
really groove.  You leave the dance floor for 2.2 seconds to grab a 
little bit of water and continue groovin'

Then, the crowd returns to see three of the coolest guys ever.  
Underworld arrives and knocks your socks off.  You can't stop dancing.  
The band is so into it that they are bouncing around the stage.  You are 
going crazy.  The peace pipe is passed around to everyone within a 20 
foot radius.  God, people are so beautiful, you think.  Your body is 
sufficiently groovin' to some fast bpm, your mind is caught in the music, 
THEN, the *wicked* smile comes.  Why, do you ask, is it wicked?   Well, 
you have now reached this stage where a mere smile won't do, it is time 
to dawn the *wicked* grin; the epitome of brilliance, of bliss, of harmony, 
of life.  Besides, you feel so naughty for having such a wicked time, 
that the wicked smile takes on a life of it's own. 

The lights are crazy, best light show you've ever seen.  The crowd is 
amazing; this is the friendliest, most down-to-earth concert you've ever 
been to.  You don't want this to ever stop, your friends are in 
agreement.  You're holding hands, hugging, where am I again?  Underworld 
doesn't want to stop either, they are having what seems to be the time of 
their life.  They are true professionals at this and know how to work the 
crowd.  Hmm, they've done this before.  You ponder the thought that the 
U.S. invents some music, the U.K. perfects it, and then we finally get 
the idea.  Hmm, happened to rock, punk rock, and now this!!

Underworld stops, but aren't difficult to coax back on for an encore.  
They look so happy it's catching.  You are dancing, knowing these are the 
fleeting moments, when someone grabs your hand.  All of a sudden you are 
a part of a huge circle that has formed in the middle of the dance 
floor.  Everyone is smiling, a few wicked grins are afloat, and then the 
climax comes.  Hugs envelope the dance floor.  It is over.  You say 
goodbye.  You drive home.

On the way, you ask yourself,  "THIS was Monday?"  

You wake up Tuesday, a bit tired, but in a sheer state of bliss.  Then, 
you remember you're going to Crash Worship on Tuesday.  What's going on 
here, it is only the *beginning* of this week.  You're scared to see the 
end of the week!!!  Insane, absolutely insane.

I won't repeat the reviews of the show (it was great), but I did
want to mention that the Fillmore is a *great* venue.  The sound
was good (the bass *hit* rather than swelled -- I hate it when
it just swells at you).

There was *free* SELF-SERVE water.  Meaning, a pitcher which the
bartenders would frequently refill, and little paper cups.

And there was a tub of fresh *free* APPLES, for crying out loud.

I ate one and it was good.

        when i was a kid, I lived on a farm. We had 2 sheep (named Laverne &
Shirley - it was the 70's)that had lotsa offspring and lotsa chickens. I
loved 'em. Charlottes web was one of my favorite books. But when it was
dinnertime, the lamb and chicken sure tasted good. 
        What I'm saying is: as a little kid, If you are only a few years
old, the concept of death is not really understood yet. Mcdonalds knows
that, and the can market Babe with the happy meal which has all of babe's
dead friends in it. (speak -o- the devil- the commercial for Icky-D's just
aired on the TV.)
        I am a vegetarian, however not a vegetarian because of what is
morally right (one could say that a plant has as much right and need for
life as an animal due to its alkaloids and other defense systems that it
develops to stay alive). I'm a vegetarian because of the unsanitary way the
meat is raised, not to mention a family histor of colon cancer. And seeing
McDonalds selling burgers for $0.39 makes you wonder.  BUT - It would be
nice if parents would let their kids know that what McDonalds is doing is
not right.

Yep,

The Junglish songs are from the new album. I'm not familiar with the names
of them yet...maybe tomorrow. The new stuff is darker, moodier and more
"cinematic" in general.
I particulary like the tune on it that sounds like it's inspired by Ennio
Morricone.
At one stage i thought they sounded really industrial, especially when they
played "Satan" .
I was reminded of the Trocadero  where I went to see the Chemical brothers
on Friday, and there's no competition;  last nights shows at the Fillmore
won, no contest
And of course, "Halcyon and on and on..." was a beautiful finish.

Of course, there is the sausage they serve for breakfast, I can't
remember if they have any burgers with bacon.  The beauty of not
killing your own meat is never having to make such associations.

And I don't think McDonalds is trying to tell us anything by selling
cute little pig toys other than "We want more of you money"

Dearest Kind Eric,

God forbid you strapping young bucks go out and 
get laid when you could be spiritualizing with
adolescents.

Try spending time with people your own age who have
similar interests.  Perhaps a gardening club, or floor
hockey team?

ANNOUNCEMENT:

first planning meeting of the GGMLSR
(golden gate malt liquor soccer rave)

is Tonight at the "bayside" bar.  For those
of you familiar with lasers - this IS the bar
that projects there name with a blue laser onto the sidewalk
out on the street.  They also have Very Large murals of
muscular women playing volleyball.

I'm interested in getting those giant inflatible
cartoon characters they use in parades.  Any suggestions?
One could feasibly modify them to carry psychedelic
lighting on board.

Just bagged PE for a second stage live performance
and picked up Shmidt STick skateboards as another
sponsor.

Also note - $2 spaghetti dinner tent.

Everyone going to Crash Worship should bring
sliced oranges.  Please throw them at the band
if they play an encore.

Dave

I did ride my motorcycle on the playa. And I am still alive... and except 
for the bruises and slightly twisted remains of my yet-to-be resurrected 
bike, everything went very well... ;-)

well.. went to the show last night with jess, kristi (not on the list),
kirsten, john (kirsten's bfriend), nancy, and two of nancy's friends who's
names i have forgotten. :(
met up with rog and justin, who recognized my glowsticks. i was the only one
there with them! i think i saw a head way above the crowd that i assumed was
todd, but i didn't make it over to say hi.. and i got briefly introduced to
umm.. [name forgotten already] the man with the burger king hat - without
the burger king hat. met up with my pal forrest, and john drefahl (who is
new to the list).

the only negative thing: i offered this big dude my glowsticks to play with,
and he ripped the strings off and chucked one of the glowsticks somewhere
into the crowd! :( a real bummer because after he did that i realized that i
wanted to give them to karl (of underworld) on stage, cause he was going
crazy and looked like he would have loved them. (a little anecdote here: my
friend went to feile in ireland last summer and saw underworld there. he
threw his hat up on stage and karl picked it up and wore it for the whole
performance. =) 

anyway.. spacetime continuum didn't play live - jonah just spun. orbital
came on and played a great set, certainly better than the last time i heard
them in toronto. they stopped between songs, which they hadn't done the last
time. that kind of dissapointed me. but they made up for it with some huge
tunes. i haven't heard the whole album yet, because i bought it on vinyl,
with the assumption that i would have a record player soon - but don't yet.
:p   anyway.. the one song that starts of with the father talking to the son
and saying "and next time you see your mother, say hello to SATAN SATAN
SATAN SATAN... etc..   was IMMENSE! orbital has done a great job with their
video - the video for that song was especially sick. they finished off the
set beautifully - i had really wanted them to play Belfast, but i guess it's
good they didn't because i would have died and missed...

Underworld! Now, my friend came back from europe and said underworld was the
best live act he had ever seen. now i can happily concur. they are simply
amazing. absolutely beautiful mixing and improvisation - but i of course
expected that from the band that once played a 13 hour set. when they
started off i was a little dissapointed in their sound. it didn't seem very
interesting to me. of course, when i realized i should take out my earplugs
i heard what they were really doing. wow! stupid earplugs took out _all_ the
high end. i couldn't hear half the music! anyway, all i can say is wow. wow.
wow. wow. if orbital are demi-gods, then underworld are gods. karl just went
nuts on stage. so much fun. they played born slippy! =)  at the end of born
slippy karl said thanks, this was their last day in america, this was the
first time they had ever been to america and we've had a fucking great time,
etc.. etc.., and said that this was their last song. they left the stage,
but the crowd was having none of that. underworld charged back on stage and
started up what sounded like it was going to be Cowgirl, but they mixed into
Rez (absolutely awesome), back into Cowgirl, and back to Rez to finish the
set. wow.

kristi and kirsten were so happy that i talked them into coming to the show.
they are now die-hard underworld converts.. =)  as i'm sure _anyone_ who
caught their set is now.
and to anyone who left after orbital: i wish i'd met you so i could have
talked you into staying for underworld. work or no work, it was the
experience of a lifetime.

isn't malt liquor very bad for you?

and did you know that for my 19 years in canada - i never once saw anyone
drink malt liquor. i only saw one brand of it in the liquor store, and i
swear the same bottle has been there for years.
when i first moved here, someone told me they had drank (drunk, drinken?
what _is_ the correct word, anyways??) a 40 the night before. i was suitably
impressed, because back home we always referred to a 40 as a 40oz bottle of
hard liquor - not malt liquor. i thought this guy was a serious bad-ass
hardcore drinker. it took me a little while to realize he had been talking
about malt liquor instead. =)

I remember seeing a Lemon Interrupt on Jr. Boy's Own at Primal in 
Berkeley.  I think that one of the people listed on the track was Darren 
Emerson (from Underworld), and I was wondering what else people could 
tell me about this group.  It it just Darren's side project?  I have one 
of their releases on a Twitch volume, but that's it.  On one side of the 
single it has some Harmonica, DJ Dan sounding tune, and the other side 
has some Underworld song (I think) off of Dubnobasswithmyheadman... 
anyone know anything?  Bueller?  Bueller? :)

Heh.  Last time this was brought up-- in the context of McD's commercial 
for Arch Deluxe where Ronald is at a techno club, my mention of 
McDonald's evilness was met by anti-PC flames.  Good to see there are 
others who understand what this homogenous zaibastu is all about.

Is killing your own meat the same as auto-erotic strangulation?

Think of it this way. . . would you let a blind/deaf man lead you across the
street???

Why listen to someone who has no clue what they're talking about. I know it's
your friend but until they experience what you love, they'll try to push you
to what they love. That's how it is. Someone likes what they do and they try
to get others to join in on "their" game.

       Did that help????

Plus the pink limited vinyl of Rez with Why Why Why on the B side and Mmmm
Skyscraper I Love You, one of their first techno singles. And of course
Underneath the Radar, an MTV smash in what, 1987? And then "Doot Doot" by
Freur, an earlier incarnation. But that's more than you probably want to
know.

I think the new single is Pearls Girl or Juanita.

I didn't stick around for much or Underworld. Too clubby in comparison to
Orbital, but it sounds like I missed out. Orbital were great as usual, and
the tracks from In Sides didn't sound bad at all.

Hi Brian, Don't know the names of the Junglish songs, but I did think the
set was alitte dark. Kinda cool though. Makes me wonder why soldiers don't
listen to Orbital when riding into battle (instead of Van Halen!).

But that's exactly what you would like the original poster to do, take

Not really I guess. My $0.02, if he's curious he'll come by himself,

First of all I'd like to say hi as I'm fairly new to the list (and the rave
scene in general) but after going to the Orbital/Underworld performace I
have to say I was extremely impressed. As for what orbital played, I know
the first song was "Out There Somewhere?", they seemed to play quite a few
others from their new album like "Girl With The Sun In Her Head" (had nifty
sunrise vids with it), Dwr Budr (surreal female voice in the background
though much more obvious on the album), and a piece from "The Box" (a 28 min
track on disc 2). I loved how they were just going crazy with the crowd at
the intense part of the song (had a kewlie organ sounds in it). *sigh*
orbital...very impressive!

I just wanted to relate some brief (you can start laughing now)
impressions of my experience at the Orbital / Underworld show in San
Francisco last night, with maybe a brief jog into discussing last
Friday's Chemical Brothers show.

I had a great time. I mean, a _really_ great time. I haven't danced this
hard since last October's great Friends and Family party. I was a fish on
a line all night long (aka: hooked), and was only briefly able to stop
dancing.  Everything about the show kept me moving, from the tight (if
overly treble-heavy) sound, the great lighting and video, and the
MUSIC. My goodness, the music.

So, specifics. I got to the show at around 9:00. Either Jonah Sharpe
didn't play live or he was the gent with the short-cropped hair dropping
the hard funked Detroit jams. I have to give that guy props. He may
always be riding the current trend (and make no mistake - the Detroit
sound is _very_ trendy amongst the SF techno elite right now. Big ups to
Jon Santos and Joe Rice for being two of the biggest perpetrators behind
this fashion conspiracy), but he does it with style and (dare I say it)
panache. I approved.

The DJ that followed him, though, completely knocked my shit right
out. From step one he started dropping the cold, dark techno jams that
give me body rushes and make me jerk spasmodically. Cool, precise mixes
of tons of material on Reload records (the choice of discerning darkcore
beat junkies everywhere), and a few notable surprises (of which I will
write more anon). He was exceptional (in my incredibly arrogant opinion
-- I imagine that many of my compatriots at the show were less than
thrilled. TOO BAD. I was happier than a pig in slop ;). I didn't know
they let DJs like that play in SF. Does anybody have any clue who he was?

Somewhere along there the DJ winked out and Orbital clambered up to take
the stage. As has been mentioned, one of the two Ps was wearing a laser
pointer strapped to his flashlight glasses. He did funny things with it
all night, but really, who gives a shit?

Orbital were all about THE MUSIC. The lights were great, the video was
just as good as I was led to expect, but oh dear, I got my ass rocked by
the sounds pounding their way away from the speakers. I mean, they
_started_ with my current favorite Orbital song ("Out There Somewhere")
and proceeded to methodically work their way through the high points of
their already very high-point-laden catalog. The reworks of "Choice" and
"Satan" were particularly tasty, although I thought my ears were going to
jump off and make a run for the hills during the more trebly bits of
"Satan". Ouch. And, of course, they played "Halcyon" with the magic
little Belinda Carlisle bit, which probably would have affected me more
profoundly had I not already been expecting it. They finished with a
encore consisting of "Planet of the Shapes" and one of the songs off of
_Snivilization_ that I never bothered to learn the name of (me? dislike
_Snivilization_? Whatever made you think that?). I think that otherwise
their set was probably note-for-note the same as the set they did in LA.

I personally could have handled a tiny bit more reworking of Orbital's
material. I could hear what they were up to sometimes, but I think a lot
of the subtler knob-twiddling got lost, and it was sort of odd knowing
exactly where all of the breaks were going to occur. It was life-
affirming hearing the artists that made me decide that I wanted to be a
DJ play their music REAL LOUD through a big sound system, but I thought
one of the positive things about techno was that it encouraged
experimentation, right?

One thing that their video made much more explicit was that Orbital is
unusually political for techno artists. The video made explicit many
points about consumer culture, the power of symbols in our culture, and
our overweening blindness in the face of rampant environmental
destruction. I don't think I'm just pulling that out of my butt,
either. Some of it would have been difficult to misinterpret (like all of
the shots of guys with chainsaws cutting down trees, f'rinstance).

In any case, Orbital were exactly as stunning as I expected them to be,
and I could have gotten down on my knees and wept at the beauty of it
all, but I was too busy dancing and whooping and generally making an ass
of myself to be bothered with such maudlin sentiment (those of you who
were there -- I was the tall geeklike person with the pony-tail, packer
boots, and the bright cheery Public Image Limited T shirt who kept
screaming and had the amateur obstacle course set up next to his feet).

After Orbital left the stage, That DJ started up again, spinning more
incredible hard traxxy mean-spirited techno stuff, including (drum roll
please) the Prodigy remix of Front 242's "Religion". Keep the crossover
indeed. Both I and the recently-transplanted Midwesterner I was with were
well pleased and grinning like idiots at the surprisingly good music.
Don't get me wrong -- there are a lot of really good technohead DJs in
San Francisco, but I prefer a harder / more abstract sound than what most
people here spin, and it was good to hear some of my favorite tunes spun
loud.

After an interminable break while the road crew tore down Orbital's
incredibly huge stage setup and set up Underworld's marginally less
complex array of gear, Messrs Smith, Hyde, and Emerson took to the stage,
looking cheery and happy to be there. At this point, I was standing up on
the balcony, so was able to see what they were doing on stage, which was
basically live mixing of presequenced material. Don't forget that Darren
Emerson is a DJ first and foremost. I kinda wondered why they bothered
doing it that way, considering that it would have been just as easy to
sequence everything, but as they warmed to what they were doing they got
more fluid with the mixing and it all made sense.

They had a buttload of gear up on stage which I could be a faithful
little trainspotter for y'all and detail, but I won't. Suffice it to say
that they had the usual array of trendy techno gear, and my partner in
crime for the evening spent a good chunk of time torturing himself,
trying to decide if the little Roland box mounted vertically in one of
their rackmount cases was a 303 or a 606. He finally decided that it was
a 606 when he saw Karl Hyde tweaking the cymbals on it late in the
show. I'd much earlier decided that it really wasn't worth worrying
about. I will say for thems that's curious that they were making very
prominent (and obnoxious) use of a Nord Lead throughout the evening, and
made me decide that I need one of those, monophonic or not. They
certainly do make some jaggedly analogesque noises. I'll also say that it
was cool that the only use that I saw for the guitar that Mr. Hyde was
hauling around stage with him was to act as the frequency input for the
vocoder on his voice. I thought that was a neato change of pace.

They played a very long set of very dancy material, which suited me just
fine, because I was, in fact, there to dance. I personally thought that
the vocals were a perfect counterpoint for the music, but I think that we
established long ago that there are those that like Underworld's vocals
and those that find them superfluous and annoying. I'm one of the former.
High points for me included a great, extended version of "Pearls Girl"
and a nicely-done encore of "Cowgirl" and "Rez" played back to
back. Hearing "Rez" was a very intensely nostalgic moment for me. If
Underworld deserves to be remembered for only one thing, it's definitely
that song.

What struck me most about Underworld was the enthusiasm they brought to
their set. While Orbital were content to bob their heads energetically
and occasionally confer with each other, Underworld were positively goofy
with energy. All three of them were bobbling enthusiastically around the
stage, with Karl and Darren pausing periodically to hype up the crowd.
When Karl wasn't singing, he was running around the stage like Moby or
something. It was fun to watch. And, of course, getting to see the Tomato
video was cool, although it was pretty obvious that the videos were
intended to be set to different songs than the ones that were currently
playing (a disadvantage when a) your song has words and b) those words
are integrated pretty heavily into the video).

What was remarkable to me was that in the past two years I've gone from
being a die-hard anti-fan of Underworld's to thinking that they are
positively the bees' knees. The vocals used to _really_ get on my nerves
and the music didn't do much for me, but once again, as they finished off
Rez I was just about fit to cry (and just about to fall over, too -- I
haven't danced that hard in a LOOONG time).

I hadn't really thought about what an important show this was to me until
I was there last night, but both of these bands have played pivotal roles
in my musical development. If it hadn't been for Orbital, I never would
have decided to indulge my musical fanatacism and become a DJ, and if it
hadn't been for the amazing singles that Underworld put out a couple
years ago ("Spoon [Deep Mix]" anyone?), I'd be a much different sounding DJ
now. It was a good night.

As a brief side note, I did go to see Chemical Brothers last Friday
night, and they did in fact go straight for the throat. Those kids do
_not_ fuck around. Bombastic beats, dark atmospheres, and light-show
imagery rife with images of death, destruction, and repression.
Considering how often their music is played by jolly la-di-da handbag
club DJs, it was surprising how much their set made me think of a
different kind of club altogether. Most excellent, especially the new
material, which wasn't quite so {hip|trip|crip}-hop oriented. After they
got into a groove they even seemed to be having fun. I think I saw one of
them smile once or twice.

They also had another wonderful opening DJ (this time DJ Terminator, who
played excellent hardstep jungle with good humor, despite the fact that
he was in the lighting booth up near the ceiling, had no monitor, and
therefore had absolutely no idea what his mixing sounded like).
Unfortunately, the [expletive deleted] Trocadero had its usual quirks,
this time being a dishwater-dull crowd and some very irritating sound
system problems. I'm sorry, but every time I see the name "Blasthaus" on
a flyer, I _know_ the party's going to be full of the sort of irritating
faux-hipsters (which I guess could be shortened by the omission of the
"faux-") guaranteed to set my teeth on edge. Maybe I'm an opinionated,
easily-irritated codger, though. Maybe. 

I _was_ surprised at how friendly and cheerful the Trocadero doorfolk
were, I will admit. But now that I think about it, they've always been
nice to me, even when they've been firmly telling me (f'rinstance) that I
can't bring my pepper spray into the club. Maybe I just look close enough
to Goth to pass. Maybe I just relate well to shaven-head death-metal
headz. I shrug.

     Yes peoples, please let us be careful about labeling people. Ever 
     since I've been reading this list I've read complaints about 
     "gangsters", "vatos", and "esse's" invading YOUR scene(long before the 
     author of the JoCks post). What makes it YOUR scene? How can I make it 
     MY scene or better yet OUR scene? In reading this list and attending 
     parties I'm starting to feel that because I am latino and like to 
     sport a ball-cap, goatee and wear my pants sagging I'm invading YOUR 
     scene. The reason I like raving is because I can be myself and not 
     worry about people judging my appearance(so I've always thought). I 
     can go to clubs for that shit. I've done the club scene and I hate it. 
     Who's to say that "the scene" belongs to a certain group or style of 
     people? I've met jerks of all colors and races at parties as well as 
     really great people. You preach love and unity yet you sit here and 
     complain of others' invading and ruining your scene. On top of that it 
     seems that it's always the "vato's" and "esse's" that are the bad 
     guys. That's B*llshit!
        I've gone to parties and sat on the wall for the whole night, or 
     danced all night, I've gone sober, and I've E'd my ass off. People 
     like to party in different ways. I admit that when I first started 
     raving one of the main reasons was because it was a place to get high 
     and hang out for the night. But I have since realized that there is a 
     lot more to it than that. It may take some longer than others to 
     realize the true benefits of raving. Some may never realize. Give 
     people a chance. Raving has definately changed my outlook on things 
     but not my wardrobe. If this is how you like to judge people then I 
     don't want to be part of YOUR scene. I'd rather chill with my 
     "gangster" friends. Kno' wha' I'm sayin'? 
        I went to Harmony last month and kept getting these looks like I 
     didn't belong there. Just how so many of you talk in this list I was 
     looked at like I was invading there party. Like I belonged at a 
     CoolWorld party or something(fuck that). If you don't like the people 
     who show up at the parties you go to throw a private fucking party. 
     Otherwise do what I do just smile and keep walking. This isn't 
     directed to anyone in particular. Just wanted to voice an opinion from 
     another perspective. I welcome any and all comments\opinions. Later 
     y'all!
     
     Sorry so long, just needed to vent and make a point to all the 
     hypocrits out there.

The DJ with Underworld and Orbital was Darren Price. No wonder I thought
he was so swell. He's swell.

PS -- if anybody wants to say howdy-hoo at Crash Worship tonight, I'll be
the lad with the T shirt with the Russky and the megaphone on it. I'll
probably also be trying to dance painfully, too. Last night took a lot

Howdy...
I just happen to have the HOOK UP on this particular subject:
http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~tremblay/main.html
This web site KICKS ASS.  An independant party runs it, but to my knowledge there is no official site.  There is a complete discography on there as well as just about everything else you would ever want to know.  I have almost everything they have ever put out, except for a couple of limited edition 12"s (that I have been hunting down for some time now).  I saw them in L.A. too at Organic 96 - THAT PARTY ROCKED - they played a different set, too.  Anyway, I have to go work now.  I'm glad you and the all others who witnessed their earth shattering performance(s) are now also fellow Underworld devotees!!!!

That has to have been one of the worst shows I have ever been to.  
Despite the fact that Orbital played an amfuckngmazing set everything 
else sucked.
Firstly, the sound was so bad that at times not only the (deep) bass but 
some of the mid and treble was so distorted that it bbelittled the power 
of the music.  The reason?  Techno music is, like vynal, sythetic sounds 
created from a pre-programmed memory which  means that they 
were created at a different frequency then if they had been composed by 
live electronic instrument (such as a guitar).  Therefore, anytime you 
play sythicated music through a live, rather then rave, speaker system 
it is going to sound like shit no matter how good the bands equipment is 
(and Orbital's equipment was the bollocks; did anyone check that out?) 
or the venues PA is.  Last time I saw Orbital here it was a few years 
back at that Galleria show downtown and THAT was a show.  The soud there 
was amazing because it done up for a rave and not for a band.  And so 
the question still remains: how could the Fillmore, or Orbital for 
that matter, no know this?  The least thing that the they vould have 
done was to have scraped the house system and have got the Whicked 
system in instead which is a) much louder and (most importantly) deeper 
and b)  it is operated by people that really understand techno music and how 
to make it sound good; the sound guy for the house did not have a clue.
  Secomdly, the visuals, which were mind blowing, were completely waisted 
owing to the fact that they were being projected onto three little 
screens that were being oscured by lighting racks.  Owing to the lack of 
lyrics in Orbitals music (although the vocal samples they use are 
inspired genius) the only other way they have of getting there messgae 
across is through there vissuals.  At the Galleria show the screens, 
which were much bigger, where stationed in front of tre stage and this 
worked far better as one felt that they were part of the visuals and that 
they were directly talking to you are your life.  This deffinatly did not 
happen (to me) at the Fillmore show.
The only thing that saved the show was the lighting which was 
mindblowing.
There were also way to many people there and the tempreture was so 
hot that I almost passed out a few times because of it.  Now I know that 
owing to my British heritage I am a lightweight when it comes to heat I 
looked around the venue and noticed that I was not the only punter who 
was suffering from this problem.  I really wanted to stay for all of 
Underworld but the heat was making me fall asleep so I had to leave.  
What I want to know is bearing in mind that the Fillmore made bank and 
knew that they were going to the least thing they could have done was got 
in a few of those large industrial fans to cool the place down.  But oh 
yeah I forgot, there're only interested in our money so what the fuck do 
they care?
There was also no vibe from the crowd what-so ever.  They all looked 
liked fresh young white thing's from the territories who did not look 
like they could blow there nose let alone understand the complexties and 
conceptulization of Orbitals music.  Remember: Orbital are not some 
kiddie arese rave band but intelligent adults making intelligent music 
for intelligent music.  They are educating as well entertaining there 
audiance; it''s just a shame that the vast majority (although not all) of 
there audiance in the US (going on te crowd last night) simply do nat 
have a clue.
And lastly: fuck Bill Graham presents and, especially, fuck BASS who 
force great bands to play in totally unsuited venues.  What I want to 
know is why can't we organize an Orbital show?  We can get better venues 
with bettewr sound equipment and have a better show.  Thats what the 
Galleria show was and it was a 1000% better because of it.
Also, until last night, I had never even heard of Underworld.  While they 
did not exactly suck they Are mere minions compared to Orbital so why the 
fuck did they go on last?  I knew people there wjho had just come to see 
Orbital and arrived late because they were on at 9.30! (a ridiculasly 
early hour' 4.00 a.m would have been much better.

Orbital are one of my favourite bands and I was sad to see that there 
genius was being wasisted at a bad venue with a majoritivly weak crowd.  
Please, cant we do better next time?  What about a whole weekend live 
techno fest with Orbital, The Orb, System 7, Higher Intelligence Agency 
and, especially Richard.H Kirk (Caberet Voltaire, Sandoz, electronic 
Eye,) who still kicks arse over everybody including Orbital.  Ah well, 
better luck next time I guess.

Hey all,

  I couldnt agree with Nathan's post more.  The line out side was a mess.
a complete 180 degrees from the party inside.  Well put together and
professional.  It reminded me of some of the warehouse parties i went
to back on the east coast a few years ago.  The most AMAZING laser.
  Rabbit in the Moon was phunphun!! and completely threw the party into
high gear (i just hope some of my pictures come out!) and Terry Mullan
spun a completely perfect early morning set!!!  Hard and Pounding for 
2 and 1/2 hours.  
  A good rave. looking forward to Freedom and especiall Eon II Eon where
Scott Henry, Terry Mullan, Onionz + several other phat East Coast DJ's 
will be spinning at.  My definate recommendation for a MUST go party 
this summer..

  wore my SFR badge but didnt meet any other SFRavers. 
im off peace and take care!

Well, I went, I saw, and no this isn't going to say, I kicked ass.

I was undoubtly impressed by Orbital and Underworld.  I have been to many a
live performances in my day.  Most are basically just some joe hitting the
DAT play button, and them all jumping around doing nothing real exciting.

But this was a bit different.

I didn't see much of Orbital up front (lack of glasses because I was
dancing like nuts) so I couldn't really go and check the gear out.  I dug
the influence of Breakbeat in both acts.. True to the english tradition,
you felt the essence of the 'ardcore in many of the selctions..  I nice
slow break with a harpsichord breakdown was nothing less but extraordinary
originality.. Hell, oribital knew what to do, they took a trend and made
something completely new and exciting from something totally over used, and
old.

Now Underworld was great.  I have never seen three people come on the stage
pretty nervous, and by the end figuring out that they had the crowd under
their control.. Major respect goes out to them for doing a fantastic live
performance.. This was as live as you could get with that much equipement..
The fact that there appeared to be no DAT shit being pulled totally
impressed me..

The vibe was like no other I have experienced.. People were there and
having fun, and totally into it.. I was a bit suprised and happy to be
apart of this first time rave sensation of SF.  cough: and the waify girl
with the red hair and sunglasses.. you have some wicked eyebrows..nice one!

The midwest is another world, with another feeling, but the ravers here do
understand something that newyork has refused to get... The music is what
it is all about, keep it that way, and you got great days to come..

Later, and have a bloody fucking good day.
Johnsin

Excuse me but did someone slip happy pills into everyones water last night
and somehow I missed the dose???

I thought the Orbital/Underworld show was straight ahead mediocre:
Orbital played a set that was largely verbatim off their new CD - I
mean note for note, no mixing, no playing around, no nothing - they
seemed to be jumping around a lot in order to hide the fact that they had
nothing to do on stage except press play occasionally.  The sound system
sucked big time - really muddy and way too loud.  


Underworld had a lot more energy and played a pretty danceable set.  It
was pretty fun to see them bopping around on the stage but this was _far_
from the most impressive live show I've ever seen. I amused myself in the
back trying to pick up some new dance moves by copying people in front
of me without being noticed.

Perhaps the evening was doomed the moment my bag was searched outside and
my powerbar confiscated (the scandal!)...

Plan for the week:  get lots of rest and get ready for a weekend which I
hope will restore my faith in techno...

I really didnt think the sound was as bad as you make it out to be, 
although it would have been nice to have some more subs, the sound at the 
SoCal show was phenomenal.

The visuals rocked.  I don't see how you thought they were that obscured, 
they really werent behind those lights that much.

Again, it really wasnt that hot.  Have you ever been to some of the 
smaller parties in SF, say some of the past Komotion parties?  Now that's 
hot.  I actually thought the temperature was rather pleasnat the entire 
night.

As much as you may not have thought there was a vibe I guess you should 
be glad that you did not go to the socal show.  SF was a thousand times 
more vibey.  I ran into smiling people all night long!  I talked with one 
of the Hartnoll Brothers from Orbital and he loved the crowd.  Maybe you 
were in a bad part of the dance floor?!

The show wasnt Bill Graham, trust me your ticket would have said bgp on 
it if it were.  I thought the venue was very appropriate.  Events in the 
Galleria arent really that feasible anymore as I understand it, when was 
the last event there?  Find some of the promoters in town a place to do 
it and they probably would!  Really  what space are out there these 
days?  I disagree about Orbital coming on first, I think it worked out 
great and not everyone came to see Orbital, I for one came to see 
Underworld! who rocked my ass!

If you've got investeors I'm sure someone would love to get all those

  Hope this is the friendly kind of mailing list where you just introduce
yourself, 'cause that's what I'm about to do!
  I'm new to San Francisco, only been here a couple of months and still
not really settled in.  I've yet to go to a rave here, for lack of
funds/time and the overwhelming and undigestable volume of available
information.  I've been raving for around 3 years, which is a long time
where I come from - Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.
  Ottawa has a small scene (no rave has yet drawn a crowd of over 1000,
and most don't break 300), which was great for me.  It was really like a
family - there were always dozens of familiar faces to be seen at every
party.  Even though the scene is small, there is a proportionally large
'core' group who can be found at most any of the raves.
  Anyway, I'll probably start going to raves around here on a regular
basis fairly soon, but I wanted to know if anyone can help me to find
events where I'll feel more like a part of a family than part of a throng.
I'd love to go to an outdoor party - never have, Ottawa has horrible
weather for it.  And I've seen some insane prices out here too, which I'd
rather not have to pay (the music and the vibe are important to me, not
the number of people or the DJs' reputations)... 
  And also, I'd really like to meet people!  I moved down here on a whim,
basically, with no friends or anything.  I'd love to meet some of my
friendly neighborhood ravers :)
  Take care all...

[ to sfraves list ]
( Please excuse any errors in my writing - I'm under the influence of
champagne gifted to us from my mother-in-law - a few glasses in honor
of a personal milestone achieved! )
 
 Recently , Austin asked about the Sunday evening weekly called Mantra -
 
> What's this Mantra.  Is this a weekly on Sundays?  Hmmmm can I get more
> info on this from anyone. I'd like to check it....if the trancedance is
> nice...

 The trancedance is AMAZING! 

 I went to my first MANTRA event this Sunday. It's scheduled to go from 
10PM to 3PM, but they were about 1/2hr late opening this time. While the
event is held in the Cat's Grill (?) , the actual entrance is located
in an alley of Clemetina St. - alley entrance is off of 8th St. between
Howard and Folsom. Admission was $5, ids checked to verify if you're 18
or older. Also, the flyer I have says "NO ADMITTANCE AFTER 2AM". 

 The first DJ up was Dutch ( now, after close-cropping his head , going
by the DJ handle Starbuck ). He was GREAT! I was happily bopping away
to his wonderful trance selections for almost his whole set! Not just
monorythmic 4/4 stuff , but some wicked syncopated stuff too! I will
definetly try to attend any future events he might be spinning at.

 After Dutch was what I think was a two-person band called CIEBA. One of
them is a guy who works at Frequency 8 , the other a bald white male who
I don't know. ( Anybody in SFRaves land know what individual names these
guys go by ? ). Great stuff too! Very interesting to watch as well , if
you're curious of how live techno would work. They played synths and
rhythm boxes ( at least a Roland keyboard and a Novation BassStation ),
or spun records , or a mix of records and live music.  

 Going by the flyer, I guess the guy in spinning ambient and trip-hop 
and etc. for the area in the back called "The Temple Of Osiris" was Neal. 
That music he played was a nice complement to the main room's harder/
faster beats. ( it was a minor disappointment to me that they weren't
going to do a jungle/drum and bass thing as listed in the SFRcalander. 

 The MANTRA flyer emphasises the "psychedelic" aspect of the music, and 
that was obvious in the music I heard this Sunday. I, and a lot of other 
folks , were definitely transporting! I would recommend that folks check
out this weekly - I live in Sunnyvale, so I had to make MANTRA a special
event that I may not repeat too often, although I like my first time there
very much! Doesn't seem as though they need to "get the word out" to 
increase attendance though, as the place was pretty full by 11:30-12:30. 

 Nice dayglo handpainted draperies  , rudimentary visuals without video 
( that was fine with me! ), great dancefloor vibe. 

 Get there early , as parking within a 1/4 block of the club gets filled
early.

 Bye for now -  Larry Ching/larryc@netcom.com

check my e-mail every once in a while.  I tried once, but it was sooo 
slow that it wasn't worth it at all.

I missed you all, I missed SF, I missed the great parties we have, smilie

SF and parties here mean to me.  My friends think I am crazy, but who

Looking forward to a next party :)

I believe that the bald white male was probably Peter.  He's a great dj who
I've heard spin at CCC before.

Neel spun at the sierra solstice party last Friday afternoon before Galen
and Solar got there.  It was nice laying in the meadow looking up at the
sky, drinking wine, smoking jaw, talking to people and dancing around.

I'll probably check it out this Sunday night as I have not gone in quite a
while.  See you there.

Too bad about the show.....sound wise at least...

I saw them at Organic 96 this past weekend and the sound was superb -
perhaps because they were outdoors with no echos and sound people even 
thought to put in two large (16 cabinets or so each ) sets of "fill" speakers
which were behind the crowd.... the Wicked sound doesn't even come close!
Perhaps large sound companies in LA are better with large concert sound?
This was one concert ( Organic ) that everything was totally clear and the
bass could peel paint.... we did even notice that when DJ's played the 
"compressed" sound of the records was WAY LESS impressive than the live
instruments... so that when Orbital began live the bass was so deep and
loud that it was wonderful.... no record would have been able to track such
strong uncompressed bass....


As for their visuals they were on smaller screens reminding me of eyeglasses
with a center screen - but still very visible and very social-political...

I saw Underworld 1st at this show and I would agree that while they play
a fast easy to dance to set - they were no where near the quality of
Orbital.... As far as I'm concerned Orbital upstaged everyone at Organic
so that the Orb - who played last- were anticlimatic....

I imagine Orbital played first at the Filmore because it was a work night
and they wanted more of the crowd to be there- figuring a lot of people
would leave early to get ready for work?


I also liked how Orbital played in the dark with their flashlight headsets
at Organic which made them look sort of like "glowing eye" aliens in the
darkness....

  I didn't know that "rave" speaker equipment is any different from Live
equipment. Last time I looked speaker technology hasn't changed much in 30
years, there's not really that much you can do with paper and magnets.

I have to disagree here, I think everyone was having a lot of fun. I think
anyone listening to Orbital for any reason is ok, and that anyone making
the choice to listen to them, shows some level of intelligence considering
some of the mindless dribble that saturates the U.S. music scene.

Good, we didn't miss you. By the way, every club I've been to in London has
been fuckin' sweltering, so you probably don't want to go there.



I though the Fillmore was a great venue. Owing to its psychedelic heritage
I'm suprised that there hasn't been more trance and techno there.

Milton, you didn't include your email address...

(so this is going to the list)

Hi Milton.. Do a partial (custom) install of System (7.5) Update 2.0.. It 
contains Mac TCP 2.06. Or buy Adam Engst's "The Internet Starter Kit"
which comes with it.

Does that make sense?

You can get the install off the net.. just install "Networking Software",
it doesn't matter that you are running 7.1.. but just to be safe, you can 
install onto another -non-startup disk..

-Chris.

Must disagree here.  Loved everything about it.

Thought the sound was really good myself.  The bass could be felt more
toward the front, but I thought overall it was great anywhere I was standing.

I thought the inteli lighting made up for the screen obstruction, and the
seemingly broken center projection.

I danced all night....more than I ever have at any party anywhere!....and
was never overheated.  I thought it was quite comfortable.

Strange, again my experience was quite different.  I was greeted with smiles
and "hello, welcome to the Fillmore" by more than one staff person, then
goodbye's and "have a nice evening" at the end.  The staff seemed very
friendly to me.

>There was also no vibe from the crowd what-so ever.  They all looked

I must ask......you are talking about the Orbital/Underworld show in SF at
the Fillmore on Monday night right????  Thick with vibe....my friend after
talking with Orbital after the show even overheard Paul H. saying he thought
the vibe was really great.  Maybe you were in a vibeless pocket for some
strange reason.

Remember: Orbital are not some

Underworld rocked.  They were equally as good as Orbital, though in a
different league with a different style.

I really liked the Fillmore, and am stoked at the idea of seeing more events

I think I rember this name from about a year ago....as well as the ideas and

Wow! If you hoped to get a truly 'rave'-like experience at a club show, I
think you were expecting too much. Sure you can have misgivings about the
fillmore, but at least there was somewhere to have it which fit into teh
band's busy schedule. 

Sure the sound wasn't crisp and perfect, *shrug* still, that didn't ruin
the show for me- Orbital did a good job- It seemed like almost everyone
there was dancing (seems like a good vibe to me) and sometimes you could
hear the crowd cheering over the loud breaks as well as the soft spots.

As for the temperature of the show, I wore my big jacket until I'd danced
for an hour and was getting way too hot. But the fillmore was never
'sweltering'. Compared to most clubs I go to this was a real nice change of
pace in terms of the high ceilings and breathing room. 

The more I think about it, the more I wish Orbital had gone out on a limb,
but I got what I paid for- a good time.

Best bet is to:

Use System 7.5.3 (esp. if using a PPC), and Open Transport 1.1.

Mac TCP 2.0.6 has some problems, and is relatively limited as compared to 
OT 1.1.

OT 1.1 comes as part of the 7.5.3 System Software.

CHeck Apple's web page for more details.  Ditch 7.5 or 7.5.2.

Out,
John

I danced more than I ever have at any show or party.  Just could not stop.
Sound was great.  A friend of mine said it was hurting his ears, but I
thought it was quite nice....loud but not too loud.  Clear as a bell was my
impression.  Dj's were great.  I havn't had the desire to move to fast hard
music like that in a long time....once again, could not stop.  Both bands
were excellent...thank you Orbital for playing that slow track off of "The
Box."  Both bands were equally impressive, and either could have played
first and it wouldn't have mattered.  Orbital I think is a little more on
the cerebral side...where Underworld was much more dance oriented.  Both
were great within thier own styles.  Vibe was nice with lots of smiling
faces.  Paul H. was kind enough to come out from back stage to make himself
available for conversation with fans.  He's really nice, and has done the
same thing at all three shows I've seen them at.  Stoked all the way around,
and unlike the Orbital/Moby/Aphex show at the Galleria, I will remember this
show due to sobriety.  I'm sure glad I learned how to have fun this way.  It
seems to last longer :)

I was @ the forefront of the whole shebang... with waves of humans pressing
me into the stage.. There was a couple to the right of me becoming VERY
intimate, despite the crowds.  To the left was a mad drummer banging away
with his drumsticks to every tune.  Man, do I miss my mosh days....   The
music itself was very dark and tribal but, nothing to my disliking... The
wait seemed impossibly long for them to actually appear... But it was worth
the wait....

Very much so.

Worth waiting to see again as well.

     Here's an update for those of you who replied to my last post on this 
     topic. My friend and I are going to be going to a real estate office 
     this week to fill out some applications. We would like to keep the 
     cost of rent down to about $500 a month each. If we can find a two 
     bedroom for around 1K we will probably take it. But only if it's in a 
     good area(been living in east Redwood City 10 years, tired of getting 
     my car broken in to). I'm not sure how realistic that is but if we 
     can't find anything in that price range we will be recruiting a third 
     roommate, so that we can get a nicer place. For those of you who are 
     still interested, reply back so we can meet. August 1 is going to come 
     pretty fast. Probably won't be partying much this month, I need to 
     save some $$$$. Thanks.

     Hello there,
     A friend and I are looking for a third roommate to share a three 
     bedroom house\duplex in the San Mateo area (somewhere between S.F. and 
     S.J.). We are planning on a move-in date of August 1. We are both 21 
     year old males, work full-time, school and party part-time. In to 
     raving, music and hanging out. Very responsible as far as finances go. 
     Let me know if you or anyone you know is interested or know of a 
     possible house available. Later.

Comments:
(0) Orbital was awesome. Definitely "intelligent dance music". 

(1) Underworld was lightweight pap in comparison. What the fuck was up
    with the lead singer and his guitar. Seemed like he never played
    it, but just hung on to it in some vein attempt at appearsing people's
    rock and roll sensibilities. That was a big turnoff cuz it made them
    seem so phony and "crossover". I was kinda annoyed by some of their
    "pop" songs -- sounded like the kind of crap I tune-out on Live 105.
    (nonetheless, I danced and enjoyed, but left before their encore
    because they seemed to be going on and on and on without any new tricks
    or sounds. (Unlike orbital).

(2) The sound was WAY TOO LOUD (see more comments on the soundsystem below)
    especially given the fact that they had a soundsystem that blew the
    crap out of most rave systems, if operated properly.

(3) I absolutely HATED the DJ'd music between sets and before Orbital
    came on. I am very happy I arrived late enough to miss most of the DJ
    that played before Orbital -- we got there about 15-20 minutes before
    Orbital played. Sounded like music for crackheads and tweakers. It wasn't
    even "good fast" -- just lame-boring-monotonous-completely-devoid-o'-funk
    fast. Sounds like my diskdrive when I "grep" over my whole
    filesystem, except that at least my diskdrive is doing something
    useful. Blech.

Isn't this a sample from a Jello Biafra or Dead Kennedy's song??

The song is called "Satan" -- I recently picked up a used CD at Reckless
Records called "Orbital III" by "Internal Records" which contains "Satan"
"L.C.1" and "Belfast" all done in 1991.

Yep. That's a fillmore tradition. Hell, I've seen so many bands there ...
The Dead, Jerry Garcia, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Jimmy Cliff, Robyn
Hitchcock, The Radiators, The Neville Brothers, George Clinton, etc etc
etc... The Fillmore is steeped in SF rock/psychedelic vibe and I consider
it a "power spot" for music performance (unlike the Trocadero and the
Warfield, which both suck).

This is complete and utter bullshit. They had an incredible sound system at
the Fillmore (huge phased arrays of Meyer Sound Labs speakers -- hundreds
of thousands of dollars worth of speakers and amps)... the problem was that
the sound people had it turned up so loud that their system was distorting,
so loud that one's eardrums were "distorting". Painfully loud -- as in
shove a napkin in yer ear to keep yer head from exploding loud.

Actually, the sound started off absolutely horrible and got a little better
over the course of the evening. Within 15 mins into the Orbital, they had
managed to defuzz the high end and put some bass through.

(I was right at the stage, on the left hand side, away from the subwoofers.)

When I finally made it back to the mixing board area, I noticed that the
sound was much better there. Nonetheless, the sound guys seemed to want to
see how loud you could get a system like that (kinda like a newbie getting
behind the wheel of a very powerful car and burning rubber thinking they're
being really "cool" and "macho" when in fact they're just wasting power and
traction).

The sound could have been incredible if the sound guys knew what they were
doing. But chances are, they've been playing a bunch of crappy rave sound
systems and never got behind a real soundsystem capable of incredible
finesse and fidelity.

Yes, the sound folks did not have a clue. But guess what, the Wicked sound
system does not compare to the sound system they have at the Fillmore. It
was sacrilege that they couldn't figure out how to get it to sound better.
I have heard a system like that tuned/operated properly and it was AWESOME.
The system at the Fillmore is certainly adequately loud and deep for the
task, as long as you know how to use it. Fact is, it would have sounded
better if it was quieter. LOUD =/= BETTER.

I thought the ventilation was SUPERB. Hot enough to catch a vibe, but cool
enough to not make me feel like passing out. Yes, I was drenched in sweat,
but that's normal considering how much dancing I was doing.

Actually, a lot has changed in 30 years. People have learned about time
alignment and phasing. Crossover technologies have improved --
Biamplification and active crossovers.  New high-tech materials are being
used for speaker elements. New metallurgy technologies have allowed huge
magnetic fields to be induced across the voice coil with smaller and
lighter magnets.  Ferrofluid cooling allows lots of power to be drawn away
from the voice coil and dissipated by the metal magnets and
frames. Composite materials used in the construction of cabinets, and
better tuning of cabinets... Huge advances in sound.

Beyond that, test equipment for sound has gotten a lot better. It was
pretty hard to get a portable real time spectrum analyzer to equalize your
theaters back in the old days. Now you can go down to a pro audio store and
purchase one for less than $10K. They even have systems that will "listen"
to the sound and correct the sound dynamically and automatically.  (e.g. to
correct for sound absorbtion by the crowd, the air temperature, wind, etc).

Take a listen to a Meyer Sound Labs (IMHO the best speakers on the planet)
system versus one of those old "Electrovoice -- Voice of the Theater"
speakers used back in the 40's-70's. There's a dramatic difference in
clarity, imaging, and "spaciousness" of the sound that wasn't possible in
the old days.

My name is Nancy but I have no idea who you are so it must not be me you
are looking for.  I don't think I'm going to Harmony although I might just
surprise myself and show up there.  There is a boat party on Sunday and
that is definitely what I'm saving my energy for.  Even one of my roommates
who is a 5th grade teacher is going to come.  It should be pretty
memorable.

sounded like he was using it with a vocoder to distort his voice. many
underwold songs have guitar. they just didn't end up playing any and using
guitar samples instead. underworld has always used guitar. they caused a big
stink in the dance world when they started using guitar and vocals in their
songs.

Sorry, gang!  I should have been more specific: I'm referring to the Nancy
we remember from a while back, who was going to school in Berserkley, and
who's no longer on the list.  Michal sent me a # to try, so maybe I'll
catch her (unless she's no longer reachable where she was while in school).

Thanks!

If the sample is:

"Daddy, what's regret mean?  Well son, a funny thing about regret is;
it's better to regret something you have done than to regret something
you haven't.  And by the way, next time you see your mother, be sure
and tell her...  SATAN! SATAN! SATAN!"

then that's the _Butthole Surfers_ back when they made awesome (literally!)

Well, one reason the Fillmore hasn't been used more is because it only 
recently reopened after the Loma Prieta quake.

Subject: some thoughts about orbital
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

I've always liked orbital, but at the same time I've always felt like I
didn't quite get their message.  After seeing them at the Fillmore, I feel
like I know a little more about them and I thought I'd share it.

Toward the end of their set, they played some great song that made me
really happy--SATAN? Halycon? I'm not sure.  It was a song rich in funky
beats, changes, melodies, humor and power.  In short, it reminded me how
powerful and interesting techno music is and how I love the feeling of
being absorbed into a rave.

THEN, they played a song I didn't recognize that was much slower and less
"distinctive."  I stopped dancing and watched the screens.  They were
flashing images of people walking down city streets, hurriedly,
distractedly.  The overall feeling was of confused and compulsive movement,
or maybe of a conspiracy of silence between everyone. This struck me as a
very familiar feeling.  And why not? the images could have been filmed on
any old street corner.  They could have been filmed outside the Fillmore
earlier that day.  They were scenes we see and participate in every single
day.

Seeing that made me think orbital was taking a moment to remind us about
what our lives are like outside of raves.  In the rave, we can be fully at
attention and drawn together, but outside of them, an overriding
distraction and distance and non-communication is the norm.

It struck me how perfect it was to play this song AFTER a really up-tempo
song--as if orbital wanted to put our excitement about raving into
perspective.  And then it didn't seem like a slow, undistinctive song
anymore--it was a reflective song and sort of sad --maybe not sad, I don't
know--but very rich and interesting.

The song really got under my skin and gave me a feeling that is hard to
describe, but it wasn't the power of raging techno.  When I saw the
pictures I recognized my life--how I walk around streets just like everyone
else, along with everyone else, distracted like everyone else.  The song
seemed to be alerting me/us to this fact.  It wasn't a judgement or the
films would have been flashing the words "WAKE UP!" or something.  It was
more like it was showing us an aspect of life we all know and asking--"What
is going on here?  What sense does this make?  Why does it happen?"  The
tone of the music made me feel like the images were pointing more towards a
question then a conclusion.  So I guess the feeling I got was a gentle sort
of questioning towards our world.  To me, that is a rare and special
feeling because my first reaction to our world is always to feel bitter and
helpless.

With that song, Orbital made a link in my mind between the feeling of being
absorbed in a rave and being absorbed into distractedness outside of raves.
It was like Orbital had given us two feelings to chew on: raving, which
can feel definitively good, and non raving, which can feel ambiguous and
strange.  They were posing the feeling of non raving as a question--"what
is up here?  How does it feel to be part of it?" --and that made me feel
like I could move in the world a little differently.

You must not have been paying very close attention :)

Every time a 303 line came in, one of the Orbitalites would start
tweeking it, playing around with the filter cut-off and resonance,
and you could hear the sound change accordingly.

They were also playing around with the mixer the whole time.  You may
have noticed numerous instances where the beat was suddenly swathed
in reverb or delay for a single hit, and then back to normal, or some
playing around with stereo effects, or some tweeking on the Jupiter 6.

Someone mentioned they left before Underworld came back on for their
encore.  *big mistake*  I'll admit that I was getting a little bored
with their set towards the end, but this last song, "Cowgirl" I believe,
absolutely kicked.  I went nuts.

Interesting perspective, seeing that song is on the single called "The Box" :)

I think SATAN was the crazy one that they played at the end. "If you see
your mother tell her
SATAN...SATAN...SATAN"

The song after the encore was "Halcyon + on + on" . I know because its one
of my favorite Orbital tracks, and is off the Second Album (Brown cover).  I
saw on the Orbital mailing list that Halcyon was the name of an
anti-depressant prescribed in the 60's to their mom. 
I tnink the track is both sad ( & beautiful), as is most of the new album.
Especially track 5 .I put it on when i got home yesterday and just thought
it was amazing how much emotion can be conveyed without words......

Peace

p.s. Jake & Ellen : sorry there was no room to give you guys a ride from

Regarding this Mantra thing..


Mantra happens every Sunday from 10p to 3a.

It's put on by Phillip (aka Theta Blip), Starbuck, Surge, Jennifer and many
others.

For clarity, the lineup was Dutch, then Ceiba (a Kode IV side project wich
includes Peter Z. and DJ Caban a.k.a Adam), who played live and Dj'd.

Adam used to be with F-8, but is now partners with myself and some friends
at our new distribution company, Hunab Ku.

"Psychedelic" is definitely the word! As Hunab Ku, we're shying away from
the word "Goa" trance, and  using the term "psychedelic". It seems to be
much more appropriate for what we're doing. Especially since now the music
we're carring is coming from all over the world (literally)!


Stay tuned for some upcoming releases...

KODE IV/Ceiba - Moon and the Sun remix, Superstition Records, GR, due in August
Ceiba SF compilation CD - due out end of August on Ceiba Records, SF
Ceiba - Firestarter 12", Ceiba Records, SF

>
> Nice dayglo handpainted draperies  , rudimentary visuals without video 
>( that was fine with me! ), great dancefloor vibe. 


The dance energy was amazing! I planned on going home at 1am, but couldn't
leave because the vibe was sooooo good. I had to be at work at 7am, but it
was worth it!

Thanks for all the wonderful feedback, everyone! In case your interested,
the info line is 415.331-1500 x. 888

resonantly yours,


Jonas & Adam

It is much easier to interpret these messages when you have a picture of who is writing them. An insight into the person
behind the prose, some kind of mental picture to aid the process. Now I know who I have been typing to. And I feel so
silly.

Well, we can always find a bit of something to talk about.. or complain.

Sound will always be a problem, becuase we always want more..  But the fact
that the sound was elevated is something we have to deal with.. Elevated
sound sucks..

One question..

Here, do you get into the "speaker fuck" thing.

Just wondering.. because back at home all of our sound is always on the
floor in a big wall..

In NYC, they mostly have raves in clubs were the damn sound is up in the
ceiling somewhere.. Hence you get the hidious circle dance thing going.

Just a question.

I'll leave your assessment of Underworld's songwriting talents alone,
because I know well how differently people regard Underworld. I happen to
like the vocals and the more pop feel they bring to some of their songs,
and have a hard time imagining Underworld on Live 105. But I will say, as
Brendan did earlier, that Karl was using the guitar to control the
frequency input of a vocoder. You can hear it more clearly on the album.
He basically was just playing one chord, but occasionally he would
switch, for effect. A neat trick, albeit a neat trick taken straight from
the progressive rock of the late 70s.

  npm> (2) The sound was WAY TOO LOUD (see more comments on the
  npm>     soundsystem below) especially given the fact that they 
  npm>     had a soundsystem that blew the crap out of most rave systems,

No shit. The distortion on the treble was the worst, because it turned
merely loud music into shrieking walls of distortion, which can be cool
in its own right, but I don't think was the effect that Orbital were
reaching for. Plus it left my ears feeling sorely abused the next day and
had me thinking nervously about hearing damage.

  npm> (3) I absolutely HATED the DJ'd music between sets and before

  npm>     something useful. Blech.

:p Darren Price's mixing was one of my favorite things about the whole
show. His music may have been repetitive and devoid of funk, but both of
those things can be good, when employed properly. Machine music has its
own aesthetic, as do the harder sounds that we don't normally get to hear
in San Francisco. I personally thought Darren Price's set was the
antithesis of lame and boring, but I also thought that it was the
antithesis of the typical SF sound (whatever the hell _that_ means these
days). Take from that what you will. And, for the record, I'm straight
edge and always have been. Although I've heard it said that I somehow
manage to be a tweaker just the same.

  npm>

It's by the Butthole Surfers and is, I believe, from the _Hairway To

"Satan" also appears on Orbital's debut LP, simply entitled _Orbital_
(it's been dubbed "the Green Album" to distinguish it from the also
untitled "Brown Album", which was Orbital's second LP). Anybody who was
impressed by Orbital's set Monday night and who doesn't already own the
Green and Brown albums should run right out and buy them. They're both
definitive techno classics.

No shit. I don't know what's up with the preposterous amount of
veneration that the Purple People Pusher gets in SF. I've been a lurker
on this list for years and years, and heard the hype about the new Wicked
system before they even bought it. I was completely psyched about getting
a chance to hear it, and was then very disappointed when I finally
did. IMHO, the Wicked system lacks punch and clarity, both of which are
things I value over sheer volume and gut-wrenching bass. Maybe I'm just
getting old, but as a DJ, I prefer the music to sound something like what
the artist recorded, and not a woofy muffled caricature of same.

Yeah, I completely didn't get this comment. I was dancing as hard as I
ever have all night long and actually noticed at several points in the
evening how cool it was for a place that crowded. Of course, that might
have been because I was standing towards the back, but really, it wasn't
that bad.

Y'know, it's funny you mention that.  I've noticed lately that doing a 
"dir/s/o-d" of my 16 gig Maxtor external drive (so big it comes with it's 
own ZIP code) it makes this cool, bip-buzz-zupzup sound that's got a 
trancey/ambient/jungle-sans-bass feel to it.  Lately I'll do a "dir" just 
for the heck of it and sit in my chair, bopping and snapping my fingers to 
that funky beat...

My friend Sara lost a back pack at sunset on Sunday.  It had some important
stuff in it, her purse among others. 
 
The pack is a Black Jansport with a leather bottom. 
 
It was last seen to the right side of the sight if your facing the bay. 
Hopefully someone picked it up by mistake as it got dark.  We couldn't find
it before we left.

I've been following this thread with curiosity, as i'm going to be seeing 
Orbital with Vapourspace here on the 29th (yip!yip! yahoo!) and one thing 
which puzzles me is .... all the bad reviews of their MUSIC which seem to 
be popping up. 

Granted, it sounds like the sound system wasn't up to par, but i would
assume most of you knew what Orbital's music (sans lousy speakers) is like
to begin with?  why then the disappointment with it? 

I admit my favorite album is "Why" cos it is the most "danceable" cd they 
have, but i also enjoy all the rest ... or is it that the negative music 
reviews are coming from fans of Underworld who don't actually listen to 
much Orbital?

puzzled,
k

        So, my names Aryck (Eric). I love to go dancing during the weekends
(raves), but only one or two of my friends ever go with me. I have a
girlfriend that usually goes, but I always want to go when she doesn't and
vice versa. I love going, dancing, and having a good time. Right now I work
from 7am-330pm m-f, and go to Heald Intstitute of Technology from
600pm-1035pm m-f. About the only thing that makes me unwind is dancing like a
maniac until the wee hours of the mornin. 
        I'm just seein if anyone might want to go with me every whenever so I
won't be alone. I usually drive, and if possible, I can usually take 3 or 4
other people. As long as you're cool, have a clean vibe, and don't mind being
around friendly people, you're allright with me.
         Just so you all know: I'm 6'1 1/2", Green eyes, about 185-190 lbs.
Shaved head (usually colored). More of a skater/snowboarder type person. I
race motocross,  snowboard, go to the gym, go to school, work, and whatever
else.

      !!!This isn't a self promotion!!! 
     
          So mail me sometime if you are interested. But I don't think my
job'll pay me for another week or two. 

          I live in San Lorenzo, between Hayward and San Leandro.

        Actually there is a lot you can do with paper, kevlar, aluminium,
other alloys, steel, copper wire, plywood and alot has changed in the last
30 years...  Take a listen to the EAW 325 cabs that are making their way 
out to parties these days. Better yet, stand right up at the them but off
to the side and than walk in front and around to the other side. Those
things throw in an amazingly wide arc! But that was not the point being
refuted.
 
        The point that was being made was that the house sound engineer at
the Fillmore was tuning the noise for a live band instead of for techno  
because many sound engineers who work with live bands and exclusively live
bands do not understand techno and for some reason, crank the mids and   
highs to painful levels which has the effect of totally killing the music
for many people. If you can aren't affected by levels being tweaked
poorly, consider yourself lucky...
 
        Whether or not one likes tristan's presentation of his point, one
doesn't have to get all defense about the SF scence. No one seemed to
have taken great offense to someone calling dark, hard techno shite. But
as soon as the SF vibe comes under attack, people are throwing their arms
in the air yelling and screaming. There are things we have to learn from
the british (or maybe more to the point, the Scottish festi...) vibe, and
there are things that they could take from SF. So before attacking the
"outsider", why don't we see what he's talking about?

Subject: Hey! Can someone tell me a Crash Worship review?
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com

Hello?

Well, I went to the Troc. on Tues. with my tired, tired boyfriend.  I was
hoping to see Crash Worship.  We stayed through the LAME opening acts and
waited the two hours until Crash finally came onstage but by that time I was
so hungry and tired and wasn't tall enough to see anything anyway(even if the
smoke hadn't been impeding my vision) that we left at 12:05.  I was totally
bumbed.  So just to add to my bumbedness I would like to know what I missed.
 If anyone has the time to respond to this I will read every word.  Thank
you.

Later,

           Megan                   Czefir    :(

*BP* the underground lives!
There's a party this Friday night that I believe may help fill 
underground void...

Meridian
$5 B4 midnight/$7 after
put on by Bay Area Underground 
(including a friend of mine, DJ Sati, who I know is coming from the right 
place - and BTW spins killer trance)

DJ's Sati-Cloud-Dan Barnes-Moshe-Neil-several others :)

call the voicemail to see what I mean (415) 487-7681


This is their second party - the first about two months *went off*, from 
what I heard.  They're trying to build the right vibe -- let's support 
this one!!

See ya Friday night
Peace to the Family

	No shit! I could have gone then!! :)

	According to another review, it was tracks from Reload, uh? 
	Sounded like greppin' a filesystem? But man, you should know that 
	actually the Reload artists are the only ones of the planet who
	use Unix for their stuff...
	Try it yourself: grep a defragmented partition near the border of the
	disk: you get a low zouik-zouik sound. Grep a fragmented partition
	close to the center of the disk: kwik-kwik-kwik. Do both of them,
	alternatively suspending/resuming the grep jobs or adjusting their
	respective priority, add some beats, a bassline of 303, and a good 
	infrabass booming sound... 
	_THIS_ IS TECHNO!!! ;-)
	
> [sound system]

	I can only agree: I actually heard the same good sound system in 
	the same location twice, for two different raves, tuned by two 
	different teams: it was completely different, I hardly believed 
	that the stuff involved was the same!
	The *tuning* makes a HUGE difference!!

	And I've been once in my life to a rave setup and organized by
	real concert professionnals: awesome, the sound was crisp and clear
	and still bumping and loud while not hurting... Definitely different.
	A _free_ great fucking massive guys, incredible.

The funniest line I ever got was when a bunch of workmen called out "hey
baby, nice tits - you won't get many of those to the pound."  I tried to
look annoyed but I started to laugh so I had to duck into the nearest
store so they wouldn't see me cracking up...

Out of the last hundred or so messages in my box, I see fourteen people
commenting on the show, one negative and the rest completely positive, with
remarks like "excellent," "awesome," "extremely impressed,"
"amfuckngmazing," "completely new and exciting," "huge tunes,"
"demi-gods"...

I asked the Fillmore "greeter" about the posters, and he said they don't 
produce them unless the show sells out in advance. The
Orbital/Underworld show didn't sell out till that day I guess.

was still as packed as it was all night)  But will someone please inform the

Couldn't agree with you more.  Although those visuals wouldn't have been
appropriate at any party, it was great to absorb them as a head check, in an
environment where generally people were a bit more sober and open to that
sort of holistic perspective.

Someone posted this a while back, a chinese proverb-
 "A jade is not polished without friction.."
Not totally relative to this point, but none the less complimentary.

My friend spent the whole night working on an emergency in downtown 
San Francisco.  At 5:30 am he went out to his car to move it, and found 
that it was ticketed for being parked in a tow-away zone.  The problem? 
The space was not to become a tow-away zone until 6 am!  He called 
the Police Dept., and of course, they can't take a report, and suggested 
that he just go to Traffic Court and tell the judge.  So even though he 
was in the right, he has to lose half a day's wages to report the SF 
Parking "error."

Okay, kids.  In case you've been too lazy to pick up SF Weekly's Best O'
San Francisco issue this week, here's the world's coolest quote that was
in there, courtesy of the world's coolest comic strip:

"If I wanted unpredictability, I'd stay home with a bottle of cough syrup
and my wood-burning kit."

Felix (the Dog) is a pretty well regarded down-tempo dj.  His "Swamp
Thing" mixed tape is nice.  Not vocally like the bands you mention.

CLASSIC!

I first heard this on "In Living Color" (still THE funniest show ever 
when the Wayman Bros. were the writers/producers.  I do like MAD TV now 
though so...) in an Arsenio Hall skit done by Keenan Ivory Wayans.  The 
shit was ON!  He was apeing Arsenio with a larger than usual buttocks, 
one huge long finger, and Arsenio's extra toofy smile.  

It was set in a courtroom where Arsenio was defnding someone for something:

"Mmmm, MMM!  Judge, you so fine, I'df like to pour bar-bee-que sauce all 
over you and work ya like a rib!!!"

Hahahahahhaha, damn that shit was on!

Peace,
John

[ to sfraves list ]

 It being a rare blue moon this weekend ( the second full moon in a month
is called a "blue moon" ), it would be extra-special to attend a full
moon event this weekend! Also, since it's so soon after last weekend's
solstice time.

 I can't expect anyone to post about hard-core-underground-word-of-mouth
events on sfraves, but maybe if there's anything happening outdoors that
doesn't mind being semi-public knowledge, please let us know here! I 
personally don't know of any at this time ( Thurs, 2:30 PM ).

David Sarlin, a friend of many within and outside the Bay Area rave 
scene, passed away from our world this morning.  For those of you
who didn't know him, you've probably seen him around; he had been a
regular at Sunsets, ComeUnity, FMRs, Gatherings, etc. for many years.
He was a bit older than most of us, 50's, short ponytail, dressed with 
a 60's flair.  He was known for his generosity, wisdom and a warm aura
of love.  Over the years he had rented out or just shared his Berkeley
home with many of us.  In the end, words cannot do justice in summing 
up this wonderful person's life.

David died of complications due to kidney failure.  Although he did
have the option of fighting a difficult, uphill, medical battle, he
chose to die according to his own will.  The amount of love I witnessed
from people who visited him during his last days - a wide range of people 
he had touched over the years - was amazing.  The peace he exuded along
with the harmony he shared concerning his path forward into the Great 
Unknown was nothing short of inspirational.  He left the bulk of his
estate to environmental and medical charities.

When the dialysis nurse asked him what his religion was, he replied,
"Psychedelics, Buddhism, Judiasm."  When Janie & I last visited him
about a week ago, he explained his serenity to us in terms of the
Buddhist way of transcending suffering, which is to let go of Desire.
He spoke to us of Judiasm, about the concept of the One:  the one 
God/Spirit/Force that exists in all things, that connects us all to each
each other and to Nature.  And he mentioned how his use of psychedelics 
had made it easier for him to realize all of this.  I told him that yes,
there are things that transcend life-and-death, and because of that
we will never be truly apart.

David was one of those who could always be seen dancing at the end of
whatever party he was at, his arms still flailing, head still jerking 
while those less than half his age had long since retired.  It seems to
me that even now, David continues to dance for all of us.

I've added a lot of new stuff this week, thanks to a lot of people
emailing stuff in, and handfuls of flyers from Haight St.  Lotsa
good stuff, day and night, this weekend.  Check out Derrick May at
Nikita on Friday, or really anything - it's all good.  There should
be a Sunset boat party on Sunday too, get tix at Ameba if there are
any left - or go to Mission Rock if you miss the boat...

Shit it snuck up on us, huh?

Anyone not going to the Sunset boat party going to the pride rally this

I should be there with friends, and thus maybe we could meet, or just leave

I'm going!  I think we should try and arrange a meeting point/time.  Does
anyone have any idea of the layout this year?  Is the parade going up
Market St. towards Civic Center or down towards Embarcadero this year?  I
missed last year - what was the deal?

Did anyone see the night sky in San Jose last night at about 11pm?

The moon was almost full, and there were these little fluffy clouds all
aroud it, and you could see the night sky perfectly between the clouds. The
clouds were all white and blue,  and the sky behind them was pitchblack. It
was

I haven't seen a sky like that in five years.

I stood on my neighbor's front driveway with my head thrown back for a few

Hi All!

I'm gonna be going with my straight/gay roommates and think that 
meeting up would be a great idea! Leslie had said in an earlier post
that there would be a dance area and that she would be there with
her friends...it would be fun to meet up with her as well! I've heard
that the rally is going to be happening in or near the Embarcadero
center like last year but I'm not sure? ..I'm just hoping that they're
gonna be playing some excellent music to dance to and hopefully not
that common clubby disco diva pop music. If everyone is familiar with 
the Embarcadero center area how about meeting up at the end of Market
just as it turns to the right on the left hand side (facing the bay) 
at sometime???? After would anyone be up for Mission Rock, Lucid States,
Touchbass, or Mantra later?

Peace,
John

Hi Tony!

If you're familiar with Embarcadero center how about meeting up in
front of Uno's Pizza which is in one of the Embarcadero centers on
the second floor...I think it was Embarcadero center 2 or maybe 3?
Is there a time that would be cool for everyone to meet also??

Peace Brother!

I disagree that the visuals wouldn't have been appropriate at any party;
I've seen (and read posts about) some pretty sobering footage of the
harsher realities present in our world, in our society and in other
societies.  It's a very relevant thing to address to a gathering of people
interested (hopefully) in spreading the love and positive energy and sense
of community & connectedness with our sisters and brothers who are sorely
in need of any sort of kindness.  While the wealthy hoard wealth, the
non-wealthy suffer.  This applies to love and compassion, the most
important things in life, infinitely more than it applies to money.  Think
about it.  You love your friends and family, right?  Do you ever express
your love for humanity by extending kindness to a stranger, especially one
who is in some way downtrodden?  Do you do this because it's your way, or
do you need a subtle (or blatant) reminder every once in a while?
I hope to see more footage like this in the future.  NIN uses some pretty
disturbing stuff during live performances of one song (what's it called?),
scenes of devastation, death, decay.  It's a slow song.  Watching that
brought tears to my eyes when I saw them at the SJS Event Center.

Love to everyone,

Man, what you wrote was sad and beautiful.  I think I've met David a couple 
of times, and I'm really depressed that he's gone.  I wish you happiness and 
quick healing.  Perhaps if there's an FMR this weekend, we can ask that they 
dedicate to David.

I too would be interested...  Maybe someone in the know could just whisper 
it in my ear... or send me a quick note, whichever is easier...  I've got 
some friends coming up from Fresno and I know they'd love a chance to hit an 
FMR...

Can anyone tell me about Harmony?

I heard it's somewhere in or near Santa Cruz on Sat.  A free day event.

I live in Capitola and want to go.  Will help out if I can.  Someone let 
me know.

I need location and time.  Will show up with much love and + NRG.

E-mail me or phone me at home (408) 479-3561 with details.  

thanks! 

PEACE-

probably the song was "hurt" from the downward spiral, but the nin song =

Yes, you are indeed correct!  That is a palindrome, the longest one

  I'm going to the Pride parade and then onto Sunset- the boat party

See. . . this morning I was driving to work when a small furry multi-legged
creature ran out in front of me on Old Hicklovinearpickinsnotspitten road. I
slammed on my brakes only to just miss the poor thing and drive off the road
into a field of tiny little pickle looking things. My golf cart was stuck so
I got out into the pickle-like field and started walking back towards the
road. About three feet away from the road I found a  fried meat product
substitute patty concoction and it started talking to me. It told me that it
was late for some type of job interview or something and needed a ride. I
told it that I couldn't really help, but if it hung around with me for a bit
I might be able to work something out. 
           We were walking down the road where we came to some 511 hair
place. The burger product substitute patty thing yelled at me and told be
that it needed something from there. Ok, I guess, so we went into the salon
and immediately a lively young female approached the meat thing and asked
what it needed.And she replied  "A bun. . . gee, I'm sorry sir but you'll
have to leave now, we don't tolerate that language around here." At that time
the burger product substitute thing took a deep breath and said, "Fine, I
guess now I'll have to go shave my nipples and buy a new set of turkey
basters." And they lived happily ever after. . .

Hey Mars,

I hope you get a chance to read this before you orbit around from the other
coast.

There is this music / performance art / dance ritual I'm heading off to in
Berkeley called "Thoth" at La Penya, 3105 Shattuck, Berkeley, starting at
8:00pm (they advise to arrive early). Someone quoted about the show,
"Haundingly beautiful, sensual, danceable."

After that, I'll hit Space Teddy -- you'll get to hear your namesake, F-8's
MARS, along with Mystr-E (he grooved at last month's full moon rave), and
John Williams, Simon, and Scott Hardkiss. Their number is 415.764.2922.

Hope to rendezvous with you there. I'll be wearing my "SFR" badge, longish,
wavy brown hair, and a goatee, standing tall and fairly lean.
  
George

My eyes are so dialated from visiting the Optomitrist, I appear as though I
had a large portion of EssEntials -- wish I had the vibe to match!

All he needs to do is to fill out the information on the BACK of the parking
ticket. There is an address and space to protest the citation. All it will
cost him is a 30 cent stamp.

I'm 25 and I'm not bouncing around on e.

Maybe all your friends are there 
Maybe you like a particular DJ's art 
Maybe you like house music
Maybe you like being around teeny-boppers bouncing around on e so there!
Maybe meeting women is not your priority for going ravin' but who knows what
will happen?
Maybe you will win the lottery by buying a ticket while you are at 7-11
getting water on the         way to a party, therefore making money
Maybe your roomate, John, is too shallow (which is HIS problem)
Maybe your roomate, John, couldn't get laid at a rave so now he hates them.
Maybe you just wanna rock the fuckin' house!!!!

Hey fellow ravers,

       Looking for a good smaller party with multiple rooms (preferably
ambient/chill room), rrom on dance floor,  and a good crowd, to make my new
friend from Chico feel welcome to the scene.  She has never been to a real
rave before and needs a good first experience.  Any help would be greatly
appreciated!

Greetings,

Unexpectedly,  I ran into a friend who is willing to pay my gas expenses
to the Ozarks,   so the Crunchman is soon going to be heading East with
Radion Test Data...    I'll still be on the list,  and able to read
my Email during the trip,  pending my ability to locate and find local
access numbers to my ISP,  and finding modular jacks I'll need to
plug in my modem.

Once there,   I'll not be reachable via Email and all my messages will
be queued up until I get back,  sometime on or about the 12th of July..

So keep the vibe alive while I'm gone....

Since nobody took me up on my offer for a ride up the Sierras party
in two weeks,   I won't feel so bad to bug out....

Be expecting to get lots of pictures and stuff I'll be adding to my
WEB site when I return.

The Crunchman

Proving yet again that EVERYTHING is on the Web, check out:

for what is claimed to be the world's longest palindrome: 1247 words, and   
over 7600 characters.
I haven't checked it, and I have no idea what it says (it's in French).

What kind of friend is it that makes you feel bad for being involved in 
something that makes you happy and does you no harm?

What kind of lover is it that allows you to say and do and give out of the 
strongest desire for, and the complete assumption of, a close, real, loving 
relationship, for several months, knowing full well they don't feel the same 
way?

What kind of person is it that says they care for you and in the same breath 
puts subtle, continuous pressure on you to change?

Why the hell can't I have pure, harmless, fun without someone mucking around 
in it!!!!

Y'know, I wouldn't give a rat's ass, but it's the people I care about most 
that do these things.  It tears me apart, and I just don't think they 
understand the effect they have, or they don't care enough to ponder it.

I've been raving for a little over six months now, and the last month or so 
has been so weird where my non-rave relationships, and even one of my rave 
relationships, have been concerned.  Some of my non-rave friends have come 
across my rave diary.  The reaction is never good.  And each time I wrestle 
with the idea of taking it down.  But why should I?  It's what I like to do, 
and telling the story is fun.  I'm keeping that record as much for me as for 
the next guy.  Why should I have to defend what it says?

And to top it off, I found out a while back that someone I really cared 
about deeply was simply using me.  Pretty shitty, if you ask me.

In a generally pissy mood,

The show didn't draw as well as The Orb, but that was fine because it
wasn't too crowded.  DJ Czech was OK but didn't move the crowd much.
Vapourspace played well but with no spotlight and no really danceable
stuff also didn't get much response, not even any applause when he
finished.  Too bad, because it was a well crafted performance.

Orbital was Serious Fun, all right.  I wasn't overwhelmed like in '93,
but from "Satan" on they pulled out all the stops.  Overall a very good
show.  I'm not too keen on some of the stuff they've been doing lately,
but they are always searching for the good bits in whatever is happening
musically at any given time, and I noticed a fair bit of drum&bass
influence tonight.  They obviously enjoy what they're doing and do it
so well it's hard not to go away with a smile :-)

I have been reading the thread of responses about the roomate that 
doesn't get it and a had a couple of questions for everyone:

1. How can you help people understand, when you won't tolerate people
   that don't understand?

2. If you can't make them understand, how do you come to some to some 
   agreement to agree to disagree?
    
    a. Is this possible?
    b. If it isn't then what?

The reason I ask these questions, is that there are a lot of people out
there that don't understand, and have no desire to understand. Our 
society is moving away from "live and let live." Whether it is the 
government, the media, or some commission on morality, society is mucking 
about in all of our personal and private lives and it doesn't seem like 
it is going to stop anytime soon. Can there be a truce?

                                  Feeling a little philisophical,

                                      Black Adder

Actually, the longest palindrome, according to Guinness, is 44,444 words
long, made by Edward Benbow of Bewdley, England.

It starts with, "Anon, now, even odder, I have made lines..."
It finishes with, "...Senile dam Eva, Hired Don. Eve won, Nona.

Hi Sports Fans!
Traditionally, the saturday before the Pride Parade and Celebration is 
called "Pink Saturday" and the whole Castro neighborhood is closed off to
traffic  so that thousands may gawk and strut, so . . . 

My friend Clay and I are invading with a sound system so that we may 
have dancing in the streets
The event is sponsored by The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence and they 
ask for a dollar donation which goes to various AIDS groups

We plan to be blasting from 8 to midnite at the corner of 18th and Castro
and given the crowd we'll be spinnning everything from old school disco
to Goa (Yes, this will allow me to play my Doris Day record :)

DO come up and say Hi!

Jim Cyr

Most DJ's liket o keep their records secret- but seeing as most of what I
buy is readily available to and discerning buyer, I don't see why I
shouldn't share it with you. Besides, what's the point in having a secret
if you can't tell anyone. Here it goes: Purchases for this week...

Domestic:
Robert Hood: The Pace

  New 12" from the king of the minimal nation on M-Plant. Definately some
of his best recent work. A-side is a sparce drum groove with a groovy stab
which subtley tweaks itself over 7 minutes. Definately a winner for Detroit
fans. People unfamiliar with the vibe might find it boring. B-side is a
quieter track, but nice and trippy.

Millstart- The Purposemaker 

  I don't know a whole lot about this new Axis 12". I assume it's Jeff
Mills, but could be wrong. This new purposemaker is bursting with heavy
dancefloor vibes. Clattering high-hats and almost tribal vocal samples make
this a winner. The thing that always gets me about Detroit tracks
(especially axis) is the editing of the tracks. Sure, Jeff Mills never
plays a song for longer than 2 minutes and then spins out of the mix, but
in the US (especially the west coast) we are known for our smooth flawless
mixing. So the short tracks and badly-placed fade outs at the end tend to
get on my nerves.

Jungle:

Photek- Hidden Camera 2x12"

What's up? $12.95 for a double 12"?? I'm in heaven! This new offering from
Rupert Parks is nothing new. But that really doesn't matter when it comes
to Photek. He's so fucking prolific with the high-hats...so bursting with
emotion that you have to sit back and gawk. This offering has three nice
haunting tunes-all equally good- and one down-tempo breakbeat track (like
139 downtempo). I could spin a while just with the Photek I've bought in
the last 7 months, but more and more, this is headphone music for me.

Nightmares on Wax- Stars rmx

Wow- I love walking straight to the downtempo section of a store and
lloking for Jungle remixes. Some of the most innovative stuff out there is
coming out on Ninja Tune, Mo' Wax, Cup of Tea, etc...  This 12" is on Warp
and has two redo's off the Smoker's Delight album. Scruff's job is wicked!
About 90 bpm with little filtered tribal drums which could be excellent in
a hip-hop set. The A-side remix of Stars is my real surprise. I'm not
really one for vocal drum'n bass tracks, but when one pops up that I like,
I'll be listening to it nonstop for days. Stars starts off with a weird
little gypsy violin and then breaks straight into the vocal line. The drums
are mellow, the strings are sweet, and the message is 100% POSITIVE. Though
there's plenty of good jungle in every genre (intelligent, hardstep, jazzy,
etc..) I'm getting  tired of some of the lame gangster samples which DON'T
reflect inner city life, but just glorify violence. So it's a breath of
fresh air to hear a line like ,"God give me stars to reach for, you gotta
give me stars"...high fives all around...


Well, I know it was scant, but I've been poor as of late...it's ok..just
makes me more selective :)

-peace- Alex (DJ Awaza)

[ to sfraves mailist ]

To summarize:

 To date, folks have mentioned two different Full (Blue) Moon events
happening this weekend. 

 The Wicked crew will be doing theirs Saturday night. Another group will
be doing theirs Sunday night, approx. 2 hours driving time from SF. 

 Both groups want to keep the news of their blue moon events to word-of-
mouth (WOM) to limit crowd size. Oh well ...

 As an alternative to the folks outside of the underground WOM loop(s) ,
here's an idea I had :

 On Sunday, get some of your friends together at a park or the beach and 
have your own little full blue moon ceremony , or at least do some moon 
watching - per the astronomers, it's at it's fullest at 8:59 PM.  
Then, with lots of time left over , check out one of the special events 
or weeklies happening on Sunday night. The event/weeklie promoters will
appreciate your attendance, and maybe someone in the crowd will give
you a hint about any outdoor things happening!

     Help, please!!!
     
     Does anyone have a room open on the Peninsula. I work at a software 
     company in Santa Clara, but I usually party up in SF. 
     
     I'm really laid back, luv to dance my butt off, spend a lot of time 
     online setting up web sites for people who really don't need a web 
     site at all.
     
     I surf, I've got a little boy who lives with his mom in Atlanta, and I 
     could care less who somebody sleeps with or what their political 
     analysis is of the latest debt reduction bill on Capital Hill.
     
     I write really twisted pychosexual thriller/horror short stories to 
     make up for an otherwise boring, but gratifying life.
     
     300-500/mo. is ideal, the people mean more to me than the place, and 
     I'll be at the show in SF this weekend, if you want to meet.
     
     Thanks...

Hi there!  My name is Frank (Count Zero on vrave)
I'll be visiting san fran from
july 4th-10th.  I've found out about a few parties that I might be going
to, and I wanted to get some people's opinions on them.  

so heres a list of the possiblities:

July 5th: Nikita (w/ roger sanchez, markie, jeno, taj, henrix and
simon at 1015 folsom st.)
	  Organic's  Independance  (w dj sneak,ryde,dj dan,graeme,kimo)
	  Is there a party called METAMORPHOSIS scheduled?  Goa trance?


July 6th: Wicked (thomas,jeno,garth,markie)
	  Freedom (the gathering) (w/the idjut boys,tony,josh,spun,jon
williams, rob vaughn, dj dan, galen, rob doten, alex, darkhorse,nick
philip, polywog, joe rice)
	  Unlock the House (w/ Steve Loria, Dubtribe, Doc Martin)

Oh, and I have a flyer without a date on it for this party called
MANTRA (djs surge, theta blip, dutch, abstract, thad, noel, ufo) any
info on that?

Also, does anybody know if CARLOS or any of the Hardkiss boys will be
anywhere in San Fran between july 4-10?  Will Carlos be at something
called Spundaes?  If not, whats that about?  Also, does anybody know
of any good clubs with bars that will be open on Tuesday July 9th?
Its my 21st birthday and I wouldn't mind hitting a bar ;) I really
appreciate any help any of you can give me! Thanks so much in advance!
I hope to maybe meet some of you while i'm out there too, so write
back :) Also, check the rest of this post for more questions and
stuff... :) Thanks so much (again) -Count Zer0

Hi I'm Frank Glazer. . . ack thats no way to start a message! :P
I know this is gonna be a WEIRD post. . . BUT I need some help in locating
two girls I met last summer in Prague. . . Weird, right?  Well, I have
their snail mail addys, but I don't dig writing letters, and I really
want to get in touch with them soooo. . .

Amber Powers or Racheal Matthews 

if you are on this list PLEASE email me ASAP! :) I miss you guys! :( 

Also, if anybody knows either of these girls, let them know I'm
looking for them. . . They are the greatest and I miss them a lot!
Hope somebody can help me out. . .Oh, BTW they are from Santa Cruz,
and they are both tall thin and GORGEOUS. :) I met them in a club in
Prague Czcech Republic last summer. . .and haven't seen them since. .
Considering I'm in PA that kinda makes sense, right. . .oh well enough
of my blabbering. . . Hope to hear from someone soon. . . -Frank

also, hope there's nothing wrong in the first two lines of text up
there there seems to be something weird with my editor. . .

Also, I'd be more than happy to bring my rekkids with me and spin
while I'm there.  If you know anybody who might be interested in
booking me between July 4-10 let me know and I can send a tape out :)
Ok, all is cool.  


Thanks sooo much! :) Hugs and stuff -Count Zer0


BY THE WAY... I'm still TOTALLY willing to spin, anywhere anytime out
there, so let me know about that too :)

Hello to all you wonderful  Sfraves people.
I am out in electronic no-mans land at the moment : my computer has
been "hosed" by the MONKEY_A virus and subsequently I can't use it for
e-mail :-(

Well, anyway, I'm just posting to say that I would love to meet up with some of
you over the weekend. I'm thinking of going to the boat party Sunday and
think it's a good place to
get people together. I went on my first one last Easter Sunday and had a
great afternoon.

I'm about 6" and kinda lanky. Hair is Blonde and I have a "smig".
Might be wearing either one of my Freshjive t-shirts.
I think a good meeting place would be the very back of the boat(lower deck)
on the benches
or ideally against the railings on the left hand side as you face the front
( sorry i can't
think of the appropriate nautical terms..) just as the boat disembarks pier 39.

Phew!

Anyone that's interested can e-mail : Doodge@sfnet.com or v-mail : 415-621-6747

I've been living here for about 9 months and I think it's the dance scene
that keeps me sane.

Peace,

Kiron (Ciaran)

Actually, someone mentioned it earlier in the week.  It was not on the 
original calendar but an addendum was sent out after Derek found an 
error.

It is a phat lineup, I was fortunate enough to hear Psychobitch in 
Chicago a few years ago.  What an energetic and fun DJ!  Now only if we 
could get some of her crazy Chicago posse here too...

	Cool, I'm housing right there, so the meeting point is found!
	It's called "Trinity Plaza", 1169 Market. I'd suggest we meet on 
	the small parking lot in front of the building.
	
	So "where" is done, now "when?"

where the hell is all the interesting e-mail that helps keep me awake at work?

you people suck.

















I don't wanna hear any comments on how ironic it is that I'm complaining
about low volume while not contributing to the list myself-- I'm really
just venting due to a crummy day.

Don't worry about it.  What bugs me is when my boss or anyone else walks 
by and there's all these gay-pride messages...  Not that I'm homophobic 
or anything, but messages like that at THIS work are not cool...  I'm 
waiting for the jokes to start :)

Yooooo SF;

	I need some Trance tonight anything off the calendar going 
on?

	My B-Day, which is Independence Day(& people wonder why 
I'm sooo crazy) is coming up (hint, hint), and I would like some 
Trance to happen on this day. 

	A day when the Energy of Freedom of thought and expression 
was released into the world gaining a tenative hold on our reality 
at best. 

	Make sure you go out on Saturday and express yourself; 
even though I haven't learned to appreciate same gender sex, yet. 
I feel that our front line freedom fighting brothers and sisters 
deserve the much needed and long overdue support. I think that 
Saturday is an excellent way to express the beliefs of freedom of 
thought and express in a self affriming, non-violent, fun manner.

	We the People of San Francisco in order to form a more 
perfect world/universe to delare our Independence from HOUSE.

	I rather be in Goa or SF if it was more like Goa; but I'm 
working on that. Hey one really good earthquake, and hey you never 
know. Image the SF bay being 25 degrees C.

Peace & Love To All

I can't believe that my meager body is still up and about.  I can't 
believe that I partied myself silly on Monday and Tuesday.  Believe me, 
that's never happened before to this lazy-ass.  And now, the weekend is 
upon me, and I am so thrilled.  I wish life was one giant weekend.

I'm a raver with a mission.  Need my dancing fix.  Need to dawn the 
silver slippers and toss out those sensible shoes.  Need to hear some 
groovin', speedy bpm.  Aaahhh, anticipation, my life story.  Life 
wouldn't be fun without it!! 

That said, I am ready to dawn my alter-ego; the silly riot grrl with the 
need to groove.  Hmm..mad scientist by day, speedy Gonzales by night :P

I'll be seein' some (lots?) of ya'all at 1) Meridian tonight and 2) boat 
party on sunday the funday, forget about monday.

excuse the incessant ramblings, it's just Mr. Hyde on the loose. 

See ya out and about.

It is possible, but it takes quite an open person that pretty much
"understands" already to be able to "agree to disagree"  Phelps (new to the
list) and I used to end disagreements in this way sometimes.  You gotta be
able to let go though.

I don't know.

Dear All;

	With regard to the 4th, and Saturday I think this said's 
it all:

	"The strength of the Constitution lies ENTIRELY in the 
determination of each citizen to defend it. Only if every single 
citizen feels duty bound to do his" or her(was "his"; changed to 
reflect what should have been reflected a long time ago) share in 
this defense are the constitutional rights secure."

	- Albert Einstein

Peace

Hello everyone,

Yes, as a matter of fact, I can believe that this happened. Once, while at a beach on the American River, I left my car 
parked in a residential area. Careful to park on the correct side of the street; the other side had street cleanig hours posted.
Only to return and find that my car had been ticketed. I thought someone must have made a mistake. Then I struck me,
something looked different. A work crew had come along and installed a whole street worth of signs on my side of the
street. The cement wasn't even set all of the way on the last few. They had them tied in plce with string and little spikes
in the grass. I don't see how the cop who wrote this ticket could have missed the" men working" signs that they put up in my
absence. And if he did, probably figured that I would just pay the ticket anyway, rather than take the time and hassle to 
fight it in court. He was wrong. I took pictures of the whole scene and presented them to the judge. He was none too happy,
having seen 14 other similar cases this week. Apparently, this was not the only new parking zone sceduled for that week.
The city had begun new limited parking restrictions all over the city, in residential  areas next to parks and other recreation 
areas. I think police have become self perpetuating in this duty of parking enforcment. 

TICKET TO EARN REVENUE, TO TICKET, TO EARN REVENUE..........


Take Care,
                        Jason

tomorrow are: 

Ethan - Dutch - Galen - Shilo Maggi - Greg - Graeme (?) + more

    Bring all of your beach toys and sun block!! Bring your drums 
candy, food, love and energy!! (please bring lots of water, cause it is 
going to be hot, and just incase it isn't hot, you should bring some 
warm clothes!!! 

    Anyways, hope to see you there. It's gonna be fun!!!!

Peace,

Ps. We are doing this party on a public beach, so please be aware of 
your surroundings. Please do not leave your garbage or belongings on 
the beach. We are also going to have tons of garbage bags to fill with 
garbage before, during and after the party. So if possible, it would be 
nice if we could all pick up some of the garbage laying around on the 
beach to help our mother earth!! (she needs it!!!)

I just picked up an import CD on a whim "macro dub infection vol 1"
(Virgin Records) which  seems pretty trip hop (about 100 BPM) except
for a few times when it breaks into dubby jungle, or electronic reggae.
Everything from 4-Hero, Mad Professor, Wagon Christ, Earthling (J
Saul), Two Badcard, and even Coil (is this "the" Coil, or just some
imitator), Tricky, etc. Pretty cool. This is available at Amoeba
Records (Berkeley), and Rasputins, and cheaper at the latter.

Also, check out Axiom's "Altered Beats -- Assasin Knowledges of the
Remanipulated" which is stuff by DJ Rob Swift, DJ Krush, DXT (the
artist formerly knows as "DST"), Laswell, Wobble, Bootsy Collins, DJ
Q-Bert, etc. I picked mine up at Rasputin's yesteday used for $9.85 and
there's a few more copies there.

Still deciding where these rank on "essentialness" but they're fun to
listen to in the meantime.

So, Who's headed out to where this Weekend?!?

On Saturday I think I'll head out to HARMONY'S party in the day, and by 
night I'll be heading over to SPACE TEDDY!

I hope to some of you there!

As usual I'll wear my black and white Dr.Suess hat.
<btw! These hats are getting too popular at raves, I see them 
everywhere now! Or is it because I've never noticed?>

  Okay, I really want to go to Burning Man, however there are some things
I don't have:
 .	A car, or transportation of any kind for that matter
 .	A tent, though I could get one
 .	Anyone to hang out with
  And here are the things I do have to contribute, and perhaps we could
find a mutually beneficial way of sharing resources:
 .	Money for food, gas & water
 .	A happy vibe & positive attitude

  Hmm... put it that way, it sounds like I don't have much to offer.  Oh
well!  I really would love to go, so get in touch!
  Take care...

Sorry about the loud 'subject' but in case there are a few SFRavers out 
there who don't know what their doing tonight, there is an outdoor party 
that will be happening in a couple of hours.  It will be in a field 
somewhere between santa cruz and halfmoon bay.  This is backup plan for 
"Meridian" which was supposed to happen in the Bay Area tonight, but had 
some problems with the sight.
This event will be all night and FREE!
DJ's are:
-Brian Flipp (If you've never seen him before, you might just wanna tonight!)
-Supermonk
-Cloud
-Sati
-Serenity 
-Neil
-Introducing Steve
-Moshe
-possibly Dan Barnes
(wow...that's a lot....*whew*)

the party will start at around 11:00 pm and go 'till the cows come home, cuz
you know...it's in a field! =)
Also, the Harmony beach party is here tomarrow for anyone who want's to 
go chill on a beach afterward!
Anyway, the # is:
                          415-487-7681
Hope to see some of you there!
LOTSA' LOVE!
Sabin!
PS. HUGE thanks to Jeff from Lettuce Dance for making this possible!
peace.

Is anyone getting this?  Meridian lost their space and now it is far 
away.  We might not go.  Is anyone else still going?  Let me know.  I'll 
be online for a little while.  Please oh Please oh Please,

[ to the SFRaves mailist ]

Subject: A History Of Word-Of-Mouth (WOM) Full Moon Raves 

In private email , someone who attends raves but didn't know all that
many other ravers yet asked me about getting to Full Moon (FM) raves -
 
% I can appreciate your idea about people making their own party, or even 
% supporting the smaller weeklies; but, how does one get on the "right 
% list" of the chosen few in order to be invited to the underground stuff? 

 [ Larry here - my reply follows, with some more text and some deletions.
   Any opinions on this subject is welcome! I just hope it doesn't start
   a flame war or anything - but I do think I'm mostly accurate in what
   I say. Those with with better/different memories and opinions on the
   points I raise should post their knowledge ]

 Well - part of the situation is not your "fault". The amount of folks in 
the area that want to go to a FM can easily overwhelm any one FM put on
by a crew with a good reputation, if that event is common knowledge. So, 
from a short period where the full moon events were "widely" announced
( flyers and info numbers ), the Wicked crew went to a word-of-mouth 
system . The present system gets them just-enough folks, and they see no
need to change it. Other crews who want to do FM events have learned from
the Wicked folks and follow the same system .  Some crews do some limited 
flyering ( like a few hours before the event ). Some crews have little or
no reputation, and annouce more ahead of time.

 I went more often in the days of the big advance-announcement FMs , and
they were HUGE! Easy a thousand folks on a moonlit beach. But that was 
too crazy - overdoses, physological panic from the crowds, cops, too many 
folks screwing up the site and leaving trash. Theft. 

 I eventually stopped trying to attend FMs, mostly because they started
so late, were usually held in the middle of the work week, and were prone 
to getting complications ( ie busted ). A couple of months ago, I helped 
with putting on one with some folks in one of the newer FM crews, but they 
are sitting this weekend out. So, when it comes to finding out about a
particular FM on a particular date, I'm usually without "special" contacts
, as many folks are who are just "starting out" in attending FMs.  

 So , how to get to FMs? Here comes the part where you have more to do, if
you want to. 

1. Get to know more ravers in general. This you are doing now via sfraves.
   As a side-effect , you will get to know folks who are involved with
   the creation of raves. A sub-set of those folks are involved with doing
   FMs , or may do FMs in the future.

2. Make yourself useful. Pitch in to help clean up after the music stops.
   Haul equipment back up the beach and the cliffs to where the cars are
   parked. Talk to the folks who are doing the same - the usual social 
   stuff. 

 For your own sake - don't do 1 or 2 as a cold-blooded attempt to get on the
"secret list". That kind of calculation is bad for your psychic health.
( "Bad karma, dude!" )

3. When you get to know enough of your fellow ravers - get 'em together
   and HOLD YOUR OWN FULL MOON RAVE! Just make sure you have purposes 
   in common and have folks who can organize.

 This #3 is the best! Not only are you doing yourself a favor, but you're
giving others something great to attend and remember as well.
 
 And hey - if you miss out on FMs - just tell yourself "it's just a party".
REALLY!  And there will always be great non-FM raves that will make it 
worth staying in (y)our rave scene.

 Keep yourself happy ...

  Larry

So, I admit it.  Between my Kool & The Gang craze and now my techno craze
there was duh....duh....duh....Metallica and you hit the nail on the head.
They are soft now.  What is that Stryper/Skid Row bullshit?  They were
never hard like Slayer but they rocked my boat.  I saw them live 3 times
and for my 13 year old mind and body they were it.  Oh well, people grow
and change and so do the things they do.

-Nancy

P.S.  I actually think they look good now with short hair.  Does Kirk
Hammett look like Dave Navarro (Red Hot Chili Peppers) now or what?

Hi all!!

 I'll be going to the Harmony thang on Saturday. Anybody who would like 
to come up and say hi will recieve a HUGE smile; free of charge! ( I 
know, I'm so wonderful it just kill's me ;) )
 But really, I hope to meet lots of folks and dance oodles. I'll be 
helping the sound crew. Anyone who wants to find me should look for a 
thin, 6' white boy with light brown hair that is really long in the back. 
And of course one should also look for that long blond imperial.

Brother, yes, amen, this collective sucsk in great abundence!

e.g. Tonight I sucked in the energy of the Butthole Surfer's 
music,(Gibby am I hearin' a little ambient industrial in there?" it was 
the shit my man.) I was
in part blown away by Todies, The Rev is 'always' fuckin' great, and the 
'super suckers', did in fact mostly suck, but they have potential. imho.
all from Texas someone said. I knew about the BS' and the Rev ...

Tonight I am also trying to suck the locations of 
the upcoming Blue Moon Parties out of the sfraves information vortex.
I am having trouble navigating cuz I can't tell a blue shift from a red 
one...backwards or forwards, que??  

and I imagine there is abundent suckage going on in other key areas as 
well....  yes indeed.  Amen Brothers and Sisters...and thinking about 
that is blowing the cosmic fuze to my little mote in god's eye brain...

p.s. anyone know where tickies are available to the boat party 
sunday..  I know this info was posted some time ago...thanks..

TECHNO  PRIMITIVE  AWARENESS



Bridging the gap between our collective future and our primal past with
the healing power of music and dance.  In this workshop we will explore
the link between the creation of dance music and the manifestation of 
inner peace. 
 
Behind every dance there is a beat that draws us together and lets us
move as one.  When we abandon ourselves to the rhythm, our minds quiet
as we allow the primal energy from within to guide us.  This place of
activated bodily bliss is where we shake loose the preconceived notions
of our conditioning to emerge free of the past, alive in the now and 
ready to embrace the future.

A state of transcendence is attainable by all who enter the dance, 
whether drumming the rhythm, mixing the beats, or creating the movement, 
there is one vibe for all to share.  The energy each person gives, 
brings the group to a higher state of conciousness.  We feel that 
dancing is the secret to saving the planet.  We invite you to join us to
find out why, and learn how to activate others as we blend new 
technologies with archaic rituals to discover the joy and love available
to all in the here and now.



MARK AMEBA is founder of Tribal Future.  Our goal is to dissolve the 
           boundaries between people and nature with the healing power
           of music and dance.

DJ TRACY is a well known DJ and performance artist who loves to share
         the peace she has found behind the turntables.

KALI MA is a visionary yoga practitioner with great insight into the 
        connection between body and spirit.

CRAIG ECKERT is an ardent devotee of the drum.  Schooled by Olatunji, 
             Craig has vast awareness of the link between the beat of 
             the drum and the beat of our heart.

Black Adder,

Your incisive questions were well timed in regards to recent posts about
'people who just don't get it' and perhaps hinting on something deeper...
 
> 1. How can you help people understand, when you won't tolerate people
>    that don't understand?

One cannot help people and shouldn't even try to help them if one cannot 
tolerate or try to understand why they think and act as they do. There will
always be more harm done than good. (Look at US Foreign policy).
This is the biggest reason, I think, why people react negatively to 'positive' 
advice. 'Believe in this because whatever you are doing is wrong' -- maybe this is 
what's being interpreted by those we confront w/ our views? In this case, are we any
different from the preachers of religion on the streets? I find it hard for people to 
give up the ways they've been encultured to think and behave when they are confronted
with questions about morality. This poses more questioning: Do we want people to just 
'understand' where we are coming from? Or does the real motivation reside in 
changing people's values and beliefs?  When dealing with human lives, there needs to
be delicate handling of other peoples' culture, background, and lifestyle. Without such
care, we will never get them to empathize with us because we have not done the same for
them. 

> 2. If you can't make them understand, how do you come to some to some
>    agreement to agree to disagree?

The 'agreement to disagree' is implicit in human nature. Sometimes this will need to be 
verbalized for people while others may already know this. 


In dealing with people, there is more than one way to attain a semblence of 
understanding and commonality. The exchange of ideas and viewpoints is one of them.
When we place too much value on the outcome of the experience, we lose sight of the
real goal -- the experience itself.  In Taoist Philosophy, Lao-tzu states this idea 
perfectly " Search for it, and it evades -- seek it not, it comes to you." I think he 
means to live simply w/o much expectations from life or people,  is how we will receive 
more than our desires.
 

Peace,
Tex

"We are confronted with portentous problems which can not be solved just
by providing for our material existence, however abundantly. On the
contrary, progress in this direction is fraught with hazards and perils
not less menacing than those born from want and suffering. If we were to
release the energy of the atoms or discover some other way of developing
cheap and unlimited power at any point of the globe this accomplishment,
instead of being a blessing, might bring disaster to mankind... The
greatest good will come from the technical improvements tending to
unification and harmony..."

Nikola Tesla, from "My Inventions: the autobiography of Nikola Tesla"

now what I want to know is, why has the government still got all of his
note and research that he was conducting when he died CLASSIFIED ? are
they that scared of what might happen if we develop "technical improvements
tending to unification and harmony" ?

Unfortunately, I'd have to disagree with this being "implicit in human
nature"  You mentioned (in the same post) US Foriegn Policy--a perfect
example of the inability to `agree to disagree'.  The excessive number
of morality laws in this country (and most others), the inability for
religions which at their core are so similair (Judaism, Christianity,
Islam) to peaceably coexist, predjudice of all kinds running rampant
throughout humankinds daily lives, cats and dogs running....  Sorry, I
get carried away sometimes.

Now I might go for it being implicit in human survival and
advancement.  But that will require for us to overcome our `nature' and
rely on some good old fashion Compassion and Common Sense--which,
unfortunately, isn't common.

Does this sound like I have no faith in Humankind?

So we called up the bay area underground voicemail and learned that 
meridian had lost it's space and been transformed to a free outdoor 
party, about 25 miles north of Santa Cruz on Hwy 1. Well, that sounded 
rad, so Franz, an Austrian friend visiting Berkeley for the summer, and I 
headed to the BART station, caught the last train to Freemont, and hooked 
up with Robert Brown, who was so very kind and willing to come and pick 
us up and give us a ride to the party. It was an enjoyable ride, with a 
spectacular view of almost-blue moon shimmering off the ocean, and after 
we passed Half Moon Bay, we started watching the odometer, following the 
voicemail's instructions, and looking for a large pyramid at a 
construction site with "BAU" spraypainted on it. About 23 miles down the 
road, we saw a crew of about 50 ravers hanging out on the side of the 
road. "What's up?" asked I. "Can't find it.." replyed They. The gathering 
was continuously growing as more people drove by and decided to stop, 
asking "got any drugs, any e, any x, anything?" as the sound of inflating 
nitrous balloons filled the air. A group of people explained to us how 
they followed the vmail instructions exactly and couldn't find a 
construction site, a pyramid, or a party. So we doubled back and started 
checking out the little roads along the highway, and finally decided that 
we should go back to the gathering. The raver crew was discussing the 
possibility of calling someone with turntables and starting our own 
party, which seemed better than just sitting around. Several were getting 
annoyed and decided to head back home. We did what we should have done in 
the first place, and went forward. We found the "party" at an unmarked 
location a couple miles ahead, across the road from the ocean in a wooded 
area, and went back to get everyone else parked on the side of the road. 
As we arrived, a large group of people were taking off and we heard 
something like "meet at the safeway in santa cruz for new directions."
After waiting around at the location for maybe an hour (3:30 by now?), 
the guy with the soundsystem showed up and Robert, Franz, and I helped 
carry the speaker to the proposed location, a silly spot with no ocean 
view and too much vegitation. The guys carrying the other speaker were 
told to keep on going, to a different location, but we were told to head 
back. After about 45 minutes of chaos, both speakers and the decks ended 
up at the same spot, and while everyone was giving their opinions on the 
best location, someone finally yelled out "lets set up here!" and all 
the tired kids agreed and we set up the decks and speakers and amps very 
slowly. My back hurt from sitting at a computer for nine hours and then 
carring this speaker back and forth, and even though this spot had no 
view of the moon or the ocean, there was no vegitation for dancing kids 
to trample, so I started helping set up. Feeling wierd after a week of 
sleep deprivation, I took it upon myself to try to speed up the process, 
because no one seemed in charge, and nothing was getting acomplished. 
Then after about 30 minutes I decided it was futile and just took it 
easy. Eventually someone decided to go start the generator, and couldn't. 
It appeared the the spark plug had broken, and no one had a spare, or 
even tools to remove the old one. So I met the Bay Area Underground guy, 
Mosha(?), and for the next hour tried to find a spare plug and a socket 
set. We found a motorbike that looked like it would have the right size 
sparkplug, but the owner was unwilling to part with it. Eventually, we 
located a socket set and spare plugs, but they were too big (carsize). So 
we went back to the generator, and I thought we could hack the old plug 
together so it would spark, but the many people around the generator had 
decided the problem was not the sparkplug, but something else. Mosha(?) 
was all depressed, but was trying very very very hard to get everything 
to work out. About now the sun was comming up so Robert, Franz and I 
headed to the beach to watch the moonset and the sunrise. When we got to 
the beach, the stars and moon had already disappeared and the sun was 
slowly comming up. We wrapped oursleves in blankets and rested and 
smoked and ate too-ripe mangoes. After a while it became apparent that we 
were being closely inspected by an insanely large family of Silly Jumping 
Sand Creatures. But we agreed not to bite each other and they let us 
crash on their sand and I let them play in my shoe. At about 6, a couple 
fisherman showed up to the beautiful empty beach and about 6:30 the sun 
finally made it over the hills and slowly brought warmth and light to the 
waves, the water, the sand, and our bodies, and we could now see the 
Silly Jumping Sand Creatures owned the entire shoreline. About 7'ish we 
got up and I hunted for rocks and washed them in the ocean while trying 
not to get soaked (but wouldn't have minded it). I found this cool 
emerald green shiny rock, and this big green rock with yellow speckles 
that looked like a toad, and various black shiny rocks. We headed back to 
the car and could make out slight sounds of house, so we headed back to 
the party location. A 120V recepticle had been located by a porta-potty 
and the soundsystem had been moved to a location overlooking the ocean. 
The view was incredible, but the "DJ" was trying to mix but ended up just 
playing tracks in succession. About 50-75 people were still left at the 
location and I was happy to see that kids would stick it out until so 
late (never would happen in missouri). After a while of not dancing we 
drove back to the bay area, and found a denny's and had a good breakfast 
with weak coffee. Robert dropped us off at the bart station and franz and 
i headed back to International House.

Despite a total lack of organization and planning, the promoter was a 
good guy. It angered me that he didn't put up the signs he talked about 
in the voicemail directions, because he "didn't see the point". He should 
have changed the vmail message.I feel sorry for the people who drove down 
a couple hours only to find no party and had to head back because they 
couldn't find the spot. The sunrise at the beach made the trip 
worthwhile, and we probably shouldn't have gone back, only to hear a 
silly dj. But bad things happen to parties and promotors. Being so 
unprepared is not a good habit when throwing a party like that, but i'm 
sure he's learned his lesson and his next party will proably be rad.  

please pardon the negativity and all the "ands" in this message. I 
probably will not go out tonight, so you probably won't see me unless you 
come to the lab or want to help me with my laundry. I'll be at the blue 
moon thing though. See you all tomorrow night.

Fellow SF Ravers;

This is an open invitation for anyone to join us on our blanket watching 
the Parade.  We will have a picnic basket of food and wine, we are 
prepared to share with you if you are hungry.

How to spot us:  We will undoubtably be at the End-Up Sun. morning and 
then make our way to the choicest spot we can find on the parade route. 
I like to be on the sunny side of the street, between the judging stand 
and the end of the parade route.  I know that is pretty non-specific, 
but look for the woman in a flouresent pink dress, knee-high lace up 
tennis shoes, carrying a square picnic basket.  I am sure that I will be 
the only one dressed that way.

Peace,
D.

Hi all!!


 Yea, I get the first Harmony review in!!
Party was at Panther Beach. Beautiful location with naked old men running 
around. Music started between 2-3 pm with Greg Sandler spinning. Greg 
just spins the most beautiful, interesting music!! Thanks Greg!! Shilo 
(sp?) was next and probably spun the longest. His set was up and down at 
first but then settled into a nice (but standard) techno groove (with 
some very cool exceptions). Ethan was next and he kept the dance groove 
strong and I felt he raised the energy level a couple of notches. Dutch 
came next and spun to the end (8:30 pm). I've always liked Dutch's sets 
from the days of the underground parties at the Cantina in Santa Cruz and 
this set was just as good. Unfortunately I had to bow out for a minutes 
due to hunger wierdness and came back in time to help carry the speakers 
and amp rack up the hill (ugh!).

 Favorite moments;
 
1) dancing to Greg's beautiful set with bubbles coming from behind me,  
   swooping all around the dance floor. I felt like I was going to leave 
   my body at any moment.
 
2) getting my SFraves laminate. THANKS TERRY. He was so nice as to 
   include a lanyard. I got to meet Adam (lunatic) at that moment. A very 
   nice moment indeed.

3) just meeting some very cool people (Hi Andy and Andrew's friend 
   [Anthema, and I'm certain I'm spelling this wrong. Help me Andrew!]) and 
   seeing some old friends.

4) looking at the rock bridge nearby when the setting sun cast it's long 
   rays upom the textured surface, turning it into this incredible 3D 
   fractal.
 
It is really too bad the beach patrol made the sound system stop at 8:30 
as the very phat moon was just starting to poke up above the horizon 
then. And Dutch was just getting better and better. Sigh.


A great time by the Harmony Crew!!!!!! Thanks Folks. I loves youse guyz!!!


Ran

I think today was the first true day of summer! There's nothing better than
cruising along Hwy one listening to good tunes. Panther beach was really
nice and there were good vibes all around. I surprised Paul and introduced
myself with a typical cyebergeek line:" You don't know me, but I've been to
your web page". Anyways, I only stayed till 6:30, but was having a wicked
time where the sand met the sun. High fives all around to the Harmony
crew.....I Fucking LOVE summer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Hello all. Robert, Justin, and I (and maybe more?) are going to Gateway 
System's Full Moon party tonight, so show up and we can party together :)

Robert and I are meeting by the Montgommery bart station, on the left 
side of Market St. (when facing the bay) at 12:30 this afternoon. I'm 
going to be wearing my faded orange cap.. If you see me/us come up and 
say hi..n' stuff :) :) :)

found this one yesterday :

Wednesday, July 3. The Promise. Ryde (NYC), Galen, Henrik, Ethan, Surge, 
Andre Lucero, Tracy, Solar, Abstract, Radley, Riche, Sean Murray. &7 
befroe 11PM / $10 after. (415) 974-4391 (415) 273-1622. by Next School & 
Space Children.

the fyler's unique in that it's a straight-up kinko's job, espically 
considering that space children usually do high production cut-out 
color flyers. There's also this a written piece inside intitled "The 
Promise" that I don't have the time or spelling skills necesariy to 
transcribe to you.

I think I only ever made it to a single Progress party. I remember the 
lady on the line making a big deal about the whole tree-hugging, new moon 
worshiping spituality of her raves and just finding a party in the Acme with 
an ice sculpture in the ambient room. Wow. Even so, their heart seemed to 
be in the right place so I kept most of my sarcasism to myself. 

I also remember one of their later outdoor parties, the one on the same 
night as that $20 All Together Now at Big Heart City, never happening due 
to techical problems with the fog. Being one of those people that calls 
the number of aborted parties The Day After just to see how the promoters 
handle damage contoll, I have to say I was impressed with their attitude. 
Instead of making excuses & passing the blame (Lucky Charms) or making 
pompous speachs about how "there will be no need for a refund" (the G.U.N. 
Narnia rave mafia) the girl pretty much accepted responsiblity for 
everything that went wrong, explained the jam she was in for paying expenses 
for out-of town Dj'sthat never got a chance to spin, and then *asked* if 
people could help her out by letting the refund slide. I thought that was 
pretty profesional and showed a lot of class. Chances are, I'll probably 
support them this wednesday.

Tim,

Your reasons for disagreeing are valid, if you see that the world we live in
today and the constructs of society are what you interpret to be human nature.
But some people may see it another way. For example, the balanced ecosystem of
a forest with people living off the land (like the Native Americans) in harmony
with their surroundings is human nature. They live naturally. To go beyond our 'human 
nature' , is to detach ourselves from the essence of life. Once detached, we no longer 
have compassion for others and exercise 'common sense'. We are like machines -- working 
and building for the sake of advancement and progress. Because of advancement and 
'progress', we have come to problems such as overpopulation, the inability of religious 
institutions to peaceably coexist, and the excessive number of morality laws that you 
mentioned. It may seem too overwhelming at times to think of all the things that are 
produced because people have not stayed with their human nature. Human nature is the 
peaceable coexistance with the outside environment as well as the 'inner' environment
(Soul). Human nature and human advancement/achievement are two completely different 
things. 

It seems you may have lost some faith in advancement and progress (with
all the problems you spoke of), but perhaps you still have faith in nature. 

Peace,
Tex

Just a quick post to tell everyone how to spot me at the boat party.  
Please, come say hi.  I absolutely love meeting people.  It's what I live 
for!!!  I'll be with some cool friends, one of which is a newbie.  

I'm 5'4" with medium length brn hair and  brn eyes.  I'll be wearing 
maroonish bell-bottoms and a white tank top that ties in the front.  
I don't have a laminate, but if anyone has one, will you bring one for me?  
Thanks.

I'm looking forward to this so much.  See you there.

Over and out,
KaySEE

There hasn't been any posts about Gateway's FM party tonight, is this also a
honeycomb hideout thing?  Anyone going should be sure to bring a citronella
candle and bug repellent, the skeeters are rather fierce on this here river.

Brilliant party last night, excellent outdoor space.  Thanks Rigatony, and
Orion folks.  Cops came, but with a little bit of mutual respect and
consideration, we were able to work out a deal and go (as far as I know) all
night.  Goddess bless the positive virtues we are all capable of that surpass
civil right as well laws.

Yep. Felt it. Was in the bathroom too.

Hehe. That was nothing. Let me tell you a little story. A couple of years
ago I started to go to Cal State Northridge. Me abd my roommate where
looking for a place with rooms of equal size so we wouldnt have to fight
on who gets which one. At last we found one and he left for the summer.
One day me and my ex-girlfriend decide to move everything and spend our
first night in our new apartment across the street from the school. A
couple of hours later we where finish and very tired so we decided to go
to bed at around 12:00. A couple of hours later I'am awoken by this very
loud sound and a great shakin. It was the Northridge earthquake! Yes,
folks I spend all 5 hours in my new apartment before the building was
shaken so bad that it was condemned. Also one of the partments we looked
at was in the building that had fallen and killed all those people. The
apartment was in the first floor. It was a nice place too. But the rooms
where different size. I was all 4 or 5 blocks from the epicenter. Destiny.
