below.

*****************

Today is the Chinese New Year.  

The Year of the Ram in a Flock of Ewes.

The notion of a ram in the middle of a flock of ewes,
(male in the middle 
of many females) may appear to some to be a position
of good fortune. 
However, much as this may have some benefit, it also
means that this year 
is a year in which it is easy to be seen, and
therefore behaviour must be 
appropriate if you are not to be noticed for the wrong
reasons. It will 
certainly be a year when inappropriate behaviour will
be far more 
noticeable, and open to challenge.

The Ram is the most mild mannered of all of the
Chinese zodiac animals, and 
can be prone to a little nervousness. The ram is an
animal that avoids 
confrontation whenever possible, and a quiet life is
always preferred to 
any other kind.

The direction with which the Ram is associated is not
north, south, east or 
west, but the Chinese fifth direction, (not used in
the West) - central. 
This centrality is perhaps indicative of the Ram's
desire for peace and 
tranquillity, and the avoidance of taking sides.
Though not taking sides 
may be advantageous at times, it may also be perceived
as a lack of support 
for the position held by others, and as such may make
for criticism or 
unsettling times.

This trait may be exacerbated by the Ram's
paradoxically sharp tongue. 
Rarely used in malice, it is often a result of
thoughtlessness. It is wise, 
therefore, in this year to think carefully about what
one says, but 
equally, to try to see beyond the words people
actually use, and to 
understand the motivation behind what is said. Without
taking that extra 
care, confusion may arise, and this may lead to
conflict.

ON THE FIRST day of Lunar New Year, after 1.30am to be
exact, find a yellow
bag, walk north-west and buy something - anything - to
put in it. Once the
mission has been accomplished, head home and go to
bed, placing the
knotted bag on your pillow above your head. This will
bring good luck in the
Year of the Goat, advises Chinese astrologer Edwin Ma
Lai-wah.

With good luck assured, try not to overindulge or
splash out unnecessarily.

What your sign says:
RAT (born in 1936, 1948, 1960, 1972, 1984, 1996):
Watch out for
obstacles in your love life. A third party may creep
in if you neglect your
loved one. Although money won't be a problem, try not
to over-indulge.

OX (1937, 1949, 1961, 1973, 1985, 1997): Don't just
work all the time -
lift your head and look at the world outside. Accept
and welcome any changes,
but most importantly, have fun. Creative activities
such as karaoke, acting
and ballroom dancing would help to soothe your worried
mind.

TIGER (1938, 1950, 1962, 1974, 1986, 1998): A great
year for love:
marriageis on the cards for singles and children for
couples. When not
working, try some adventurous activities and
competitive sports to fulfill
your need to be challenged. Be careful with money.

RABBIT (1939, 1951, 1963, 1975, 1987, 1999): Expect a
tumultuous love
life- try to enjoy the lows as well as the highs.
Speak up and be frank with
your partner. To relax, stick with quieter forms of
entertainment, such as
going to the movies and reading books, to prevent any
further aggravation to
your already troubled mind.

DRAGON (1940, 1952, 1964, 1976, 1988, 2000): Try not
to think too much
and stop banging your head against a brick wall. This
is a wonderful year
for love - don't run away from it. Go to lots of
parties, meet new people
and travel. It's a year for fun, so don't just sit at
home.

SNAKE (1941, 1953, 1965, 1977, 1989, 2001): Although
patience is a
virtue, wait no longer - this year is a good one for
setting plans in action.
You will do well financially and share the fruits of
your hard work with a
loved one - so be romantic and happy together.

HORSE (1930, 1942, 1954, 1966, 1978, 1990, 2002): Even
though you may
not feel like going out, try to get away once in a
while. Go for a hike, get
some fresh air. Expect a year of obstacles and
opposition. Know thy
enemy a useful activity would be people-watching in
shopping centres and
cafes.

GOAT (1931, 1943, 1955, 1967, 1979, 1991, 2003): Your
partner will be in
the mood to go out, splash out and have fun. Join in.
Don't expect too much
to happen this year. Just go with the flow, and don't
put too much pressure
on yourself to do well.

MONKEY (1932, 1944, 1956, 1968, 1980, 1992): With the
help of a lucky
star illuminating your path, you should do well
financially. Although you may
yearn to be alone, try to be sociable. Expect
arguments in
relationships, though they should not be too damaging.

ROOSTER (1933, 1945, 1957, 1969, 1981, 1993): There
will be endless
social obligations - try to avoid unnecessary ones.
Stay clear of places of
sexual temptation, such as girlie bars and hostess
clubs. If you invest wisely
and patiently and are not over-confident, this should
be a prosperous year.

DOG (1934, 1946, 1958, 1970, 1982, 1994): This is a
good year for going
to art galleries and theatres, but stay clear of noisy
functions and
unnecessary challenges. In relationships, an old
partner may leave and a
new one could appear. Try not to swim against the tide
and accept that this
is not your year. Wear something light yellow to ward
off bad luck.

PIG (1935, 1947, 1959, 1971, 1983, 1995): Leave plenty
of room for
manoeuvre in every aspect of your life. You are bound
to overspend so try to
cut back: don't always eat out, and rent movies
instead of going to the
cinema. You will be the source of arguments in
relationships, so try to
control your temper.

God Bless U!  Love, Your sister in Christ, Tami

Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, Rejoice. Let your gentleness be known to everyone. The Lord is near. Do not worry about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.    Philippians 4:4-7

Have you played with the Handspring Treo? Sprint offers a 10/mo

                 http://www.volsoc.com
                 [check out the live set]

This amazing duo is joining us from Los Angeles and will be
performing a live electro set that we're SURE is going to knock
us all on our asses. This ain't just a laptop show people...they
will be utilizing ze phat analog gear, just the way we like it!

They have just been scooped up by SI BEGG himself, and have
an upcoming release on his NOODLES label....whaaaa!??

Wikked!


We have 4 visual artists headlining as well
SWIPE, MICKEY T, C-TRL and resident + host GIRLIE8.TV.

The event includes an interactive gaming lounge by C-TRL,
who creates a large network of classic macs that have old skool games,
tweaked out hacks and live chat so you can talk to that electrolady
you met at last month's ESC WITH TIPPER.


Musical guests include MS. E who I doubt needs any introduction
(as she is one of the best known/best breaks Deejays from SF),
TUNG who will play at one of our events for the first time and from
the sounds of it should rip the shit out of the dancefloor sufficiently,
and your residents and hosts ANON, DOV + ADAM OHANA.

                 E S C   W I T H   V O L S O C
                 @ CLUB 6IX  - 60 Sixth Street, SF.

       i've very recently started up a free website devoted to promoting techno, techno djs, artists and techno producers on the west coast. it is also a site for people interested in furthering the knowledge of techno's presence within the underground and rave community. the site was also made to add a sense of infrastructure which i feel is lacking within the techno community.
if interested, please see the link below to inquire more about the site's purpose and goals.
www.DEFSF.com/info 

also, you are welcomed to visit DEFSF.com itself  to get a better understanding of what DEF represents and why it exists to benefit you. at present it looks like an internet ghost town, that's why we need support from fellow techno enthusiasts to make this site a positive way to support and promote techno within the west coast.

at present the site remains incomplete with future development still in the works. here's a few things that are planned:
internet radio
dj/artist profile pages with booking info, online dj sets, producer spotlights
artists/digital artists pages+profiles
a record label focusing on dj tools called Tactical
DEF-SF techno events
lend/lease it's own soundsystem, DEF-Sound, to other techno events
choice of site skins designed by different digital artists.
online gallery space for techno minded visual artists

thanks for your time and if you have any ideas to contribute see our discussion page or reply to disconnect4@aol.com (subject to change) and i look forward to seeing you at www.defsf.com. -respects, sean.

last night at nhc i was arguing with someone that men don't cry.

well, today i cried. this is the saddest i've been in 2 years. sure,
millions of people die every day, but not all of them are on a mission of
peace. i can't even look at the news without wanting to cry. :(

Subject: [sfraves] WTF - no techno tonight?

How can this fucking be.  It's the Chinese New Year and I can't find any
place to go listen to techno.  They say that how you're spending your time
tonight will be an indication of how things are going to be for the rest of
this year.

Well, not only must I have done some pretty fucked up shit last year (this
year was crap), but I can't in good faith look ahead if I'm not dancing to
techno, around my friends, with a hit of e up my ass.

This sucks.  I'm still gonna party like it was NYE 1999/2k ('sup Harmony,
thanks for that one).  It just won't be the same without techno.

Hope you guys have a good night.

love always

    What an ignorant thing say... just because this kid can't find a place to 
listen to tonight is not any indication that techno is dead. Techno is 
actually on a rise, and it hasn't even really hit the "pop" scene yet, but 
it's starting to, and it definately will. Techno is as big of a phenomena and 
will soon be as big as rock & roll ever was. People like you who say techno 
is a phase or that it will die or that it is already dead are just like the 
people back in the 50's & 60's who said the same things about rock & roll or 
people in the 80's & 90's who said the same thing about hip hop. In my 
opinion, you probably personally just want techno to die because you're not 
comfertable with it yet, or you don't understand what techno is about about. 
Techno is not ever going to die, and it if it ever did die it would be 
because of people like you who mock and put down the community of it all. 
Happy Chinese New Year SFR :) - johnny Bzzz

yes because it's such a horrible thing that techno related celebrities are in 
commercials like all the other celebrities...  
    so i guess it's kind of a techno stand point to be anti-commercial and 
all that but i'd rather see that commercial pay check go to DJ Rap who most 
likely will reinvest what she makes back into the rave scene more or less, 
than have that pay check go to some material bimbo who just wants a new car.

Dj Rap is pretty pop to begin with. She gorgeous in person and I'll never
forget that sweaty, white halter top at 1015 2 years ago. YUM. It seems
fitting she would do this commercial. I just see it as a *of all things why
a twix commercial that's super cheesey??*

yanno?

True but there's also that sense of being so cheesey that's it's humorous, 
almost like satire... like Austin Powers 3 style? yano?

I think continually of those who were truly great.
Who, from the womb, remembered the soul's history
Through corridors of light where the hours are suns,
Endless and singing. Whose lovely ambition
Was that their lips, still touched with fire,
Should tell of the spirit clothed from head to foot in song.
And who hoarded from the spring branches
The desires falling across their bodies like blossoms.

What is precious is never to forget
The delight of the blood drawn from ancient springs
Breaking through rocks in worlds before our earth;
Never to deny its pleasure in the simple morning light,
Nor its grave evening demand for love;
Never to allow gradually the traffic to smother
With noise and fog the flowering of the spirit.

Near the snow, near the sun, in the highest fields
See how these names are f=EAted by the waving grass,
And by the streamers of white cloud,
And whispers of wind in the listening sky;
The names of those who in their lives fought for life,
Who wore at their hearts the fire's center.
Born of the sun, they travelled a short while
              towards the sun,
And left the vivid air signed with their honor.

All,

I just wanted to thank everyone that responded to my note regardign the
Digital Music Education Foundation last week.  I want to take the time to

days still I just wanted to let everyone know that I appreciate the support

Thanks!

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii


Hello everyone,

I just wanted to let you know that there will be a new weekly starting up on Thursday nights in SF, location and start date to be disclosed at a later time. We are currently looking for any djs or producers who are currently established or are skilled and trying to get established in the SF music scene who would be interested in being a part of these events. If you are interested, please contact me via my private email at cosmicdancer777@yahoo.com. Thanks a lot and may the beat live on...

Heidi

i  was just thinking about the whole trainwrecking issue....if a dj is playing a good mix, and then all of a sudden you lose your urge to move, do you think it is the fault of the dj or the producer? like, think about those times when suddenly the groove just falls out (like right when your just feeling all smooth and juicy), and then a long spell of simulated kickdrum comes in for what seems like endless seconds....it is not really a fault or mistake actually. art just is so i probably shouldn't use that word, but it is pretty well understood however verbally indescribable the frusteration it can leave one with. :)

Agreed. A trainwreck is when the dj is trying to mix two records and the beats aren't matching, they're just all over the place. This would not be from the producer, but from the dj.

Even if the rythym drops out on a record and the crowd loses it that is the 
djs fault. As a dj you should pick beats that will move the floor and not 
lag at inappropriate times. If you let a rythym line drop and it just leaves 
a kick that is not good. Just my two cents. Peace

yeah, what he said.  last year included wonderful performances and art in a synergistic assembly
that tranformed 1015 into a veritable carnival of art and dance, if only for one day.

hmmm... I'm not sure if you are actually describing trainwrecking
or not.  "if the DJ is playing a good mix" meaning that the songs
have all be good but maybe or maybe not mixed well?

"all of a sudden lose your urge to dance" could mean that there
was a lull in the song where the beat simply dropped out- then thats the song, not the DJ's mixing.  But since the Selecta
chose the song, then its still his or her fault!

Stop Palladium and TCPA Now!


Okay, you folks understand this issue -- AMI and Transmeta
recently announced their intention to build TCPA technology
into their chips.  It's time to tell them that building
chips that let others control your computer, is
unacceptable.


1) Please send your comments using the form provided below.=20
Tell them not to produce their AMIBIOS8 and TM5800 chips,
and that you will boycott any technology that enables TCPA
and Palladium technology on your computer.  Read the alert
below for details.

3) Take up a role helping with this and other efforts
related to information freedom in the future.  Two roles you
can take up are to become a Press Outreach Campaigner or a
Commentator.  Simply reply to this email to show your
interest.

2) Please forward this alert to any other interested parties
that you know of, who would understand and see the
importance of this issue.


New Yorkers for Fair Use Action Alert:
--------------------------------------
Stop Palladium and TCPA now!=20

Tell American Megatrends and Transmeta not to make chips
that let others control your computer!=20

Please use the following form to tell American Megatrends
and Transmeta not to produce their AMIBIOS8 and TM5800
chips, and that you will boycott any technology that enables
TCPA and Palladium technology on your computer:=20

http://www.nyfairuse.org/cgi-bin/nyfu/palladium=20

What's Going On:=20

Last week, Intel, Microsoft, the RIAA and the MPAA announced
their intention to force Palladium and TCPA into every
personal computer on the planet. Palladium and TCPA are a
different kind of DRM, worse than even the most invasive of
previously proposed "content control" systems.=20

Palladium and TCPA would hardwire your home computer so that
these four entities and their partners would be able to run
processes on your computer, entirely outside your control,
indeed, without your knowledge.=20

Below we answer some questions about DRM, Palladium, TCPA,
and the boycott.=20

New Yorkers for Fair Use=20

What is DRM?=20

DRM is the political, legal, contractual, economic,
hardware, and software infrastructure designed and intended
by a loose alliance of cartels and monopolies to take away
your right to own and privately use a computer. No full DRM
exists in the world today, though pieces of DRM have been
successfully enacted into law and tiny bits of DRM hardware
and software have been placed in some home movie playing and
recording devices. Every single piece of DRM is meant to
help attain the objective of the anti-ownership alliance: to
get control of every personal computer in the world.=20

Intel and Microsoft and RIAA and MPAA, by their own
admission, have, to date, spent billions of dollars to force
universal DRM on the entire world. Last week these four
reiterated their intention to force DRM into every personal
computer on the planet:=20

http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/15/business/15PIRA.html=20
http://news.com.com/2100-1023-980671.html=20

For more on DRM see:=20

http://newsforge.com/newsforge/02/10/21/1449250.shtml?tid=3D19=20
http://www.panix.com/~jays/what.is.drm.3=20

What is Palladium?=20

"Palladium" is Microsoft's name for its proposed DRM system.
No implementation of Palladium exists today, indeed no
complete specification of Palladium exists today, but
certain hardware which a Palladiated operating system
requires is about to be placed in all personal computers,
unless we stop Microsoft and its hardware and vendor
partners, such as Intel, American Megatrends, Transmeta,
Dell, and CompUSA.=20

What will Palladium do?=20

Palladium will enable a few large corporations and
governments to run source secret, indeed, well-encrypted,
code on home users' machines in such a way that the home
user cannot see, modify, or control the running code. A
Palladiated system is under the complete control of
Microsoft at all times. Microsoft might allow some of its
partners to run code on your machine, but no code will run
on a Palladiated system without Microsoft's consent. The
mechanics are as follows: only code that has been signed
with a special Microsoft provided key will run. Microsoft
will retain at all times the power to revoke any other
entity's keys. In particular, no operating system will be
able to boot without a key from Microsoft. So if Palladium
is forced into every home computer, there will be no more
free software.=20

Microsoft will be able to spy on each and every keystroke,
and mouse movement, and send encrypted messages from your
machine to Microsoft headquarters. Microsoft will also be
able to examine every file on your system. Your encryption
programs will not work against Microsoft, or any other
entities which have full power keys from Microsoft.=20

But surely wily crackers and freedom-loving hackers around
the world will be able to defeat Palladium by breaking it?=20

No. Whether or not a few hackers are able to get around some
versions of Palladium, most people will not be able to.
There are two reasons most people will not be able to escape
the All Seeing Eye and Invisible Hand of Palladium. First,
Palladium is not like the absurdly weak systems called "DRM"
today. Palladium is both hardware and software, and the
software is locked to the hardware in a manner completely
different from today's weak DRM systems. The design of
Palladium allows for defense in depth, and even one layer of
Palladium is harder to crack than any DRM ever seen before.
Second, under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of the
United States of America, it is illegal to try to see what
Palladium is doing. It is also illegal to modify the
hardware of a Palladiated system. And it is a felony to sell
advice on how to disable Palladium or its supporting
hardware. It is hard enough today to get vendors to sell
computers with a free operating system already installed.
Once Microsoft and Intel have forced Palladiated hardware
into every personal computer, it will be impossible to run a
free OS. The very act of booting a free OS will be outlawed
by application of the DMCA to a Palladiated computer.=20

But there are no Palladium systems available today. So how
can you boycott Palladium?=20

We are boycotting the hardware that Palladium needs. Before
Palladium is rolled out, Palladium-enabling hardware must be
placed in most of the world's personal computers. Right now
such hardware is being placed in computers meant for home
and business use without the buyer being told. Our boycott
is aimed at stopping Palladium-enabling hardware from being
secretly forced into every personal computer in world. We
intend to stop Palladium before we cease to own the
computers in our own houses and offices.=20

The main Palladium-enabling hardware is called a "TPM" for
Trusted Platform Module. The TPM hardware will support, in
addition to Palladium, many different systems which take
control of the computer away from the user and give control
to large corporations and government entities. The TCPA, the
Trusted Computing Platform Alliance, is the standards
organization for the TPM. The founding Alliance members are
Compaq, HP, IBM, Intel and Microsoft. Since 1999, the year
TCPA was founded, about one hundred more companies have
joined the TCPA. The Alliance has published a formal
specification of the TPM. The TCPA's FAQ=20

http://www.trustedcomputing.org/docs/Website_TCPA%20FAQ_0703021.pdf=20

seeks to allay the natural suspicions of computer buyers
about what the TPM does. Unfortunately the FAQ is inaccurate
on the most important issues. For example, the claim is made
that a computer with a working TPM will remain under the
final, ultimate, and complete control of the user. But, as
explained above, this is simply untrue.=20

So what exactly are you doing?=20

We refuse to buy any computer with a TPM inside and we ask
you to refuse to buy any computer with a TPM inside. We use
the term "TPM" to include TPM-like devices, whether in a
separate chip, in the BIOS chip, or even in the cpu. This

First of all-that has no bearing on anything.
If the day ever comes where all the content on the Internet can only be 
played on "TCPA Enabled" hardware, then you will witness Apple quickly 
become TCPA Enabled...

Other points addressed below:

Ok-first of all-TCPA is really nothing more than a hardware encryption 
coprocessor on the motherboard.
Yes, all of this *could* be done today through software.

The fact that the MPAA and the RIAA have the most to lose without DRM does 
not mean it's a bad thing.
DRM is Digital Rights Management.
It's aim is to simply maintain control over a piece of content.
You remember DIVX?
(The limited-play DVDs, not the video codec)
Circuit city sold them-they were DVDs that would only play 3 times or so, 
and you could buy them for cheaper than the normal DVDs.
Guess what-they flopped-but that's besides the point.
That was the essence of DRM-control over the content-
And it's not a bad thing.
You don't want to pay for an mp3 that you can't share with your friends?
Fine-don't buy it.
You don't want to pay for a movie clip that will only play from 8PM-9PM on 
Tuesdays?
Fine-don't buy it.
Just like DIVX-people didn't want to buy a DVD that they could only watch 3 
times.
So they didn't...

This is for the most part true, but is *totally* phrased in an alarmist 
way.
The "well encrypted code" is meant to secure the machine.
And it will not be "controlled by Microsoft" in any way.

Incorrect-Hardware will *always* be tied to software.
You want to see Palladium in action?
Look at the XBox.
There it is, right in front of you.
Palladium HW encryption-used to secure the console.
And what?
You don't like that idea?
Fine-it has of course been cracked, as any sort of HW/SW combo will

Yes.
The DMCA is IMO the most dangerous thing to personal freedom in existance 
today.
Yes-the DMCA makes what I described above-the cracking of the XBox, the 
bypassing of any Palladium PC-ILLEGAL.The DMCA is the problem, not 
Palladium.
MS could release an OS tomorrow that had the Palladium features in software 
and could then invoke the DMCA upon anything that tried to bypass them.
My point being-the DMCA is the real problem here.

I'm all for taking action, but I would recommend demanding repeal of the 
DMCA, because Palladium isn't going to do anything at all...

Control that is, arguably, illegal according to the DMCA, but just fine
according to fair-use standards and copyright. I'm not thrilled that the
short-sighted corporate-bought legal fuckover (DMCA) is trumping the Right
(copyright).

If it were that simple, you wouldn't have organizations like the EFF up in
arms over this crap. It's /not/ just a matter of choosing not to pay for
content you feel is too restricted, it's an issue of the *AA's attempting
to circumvent basic economics in order to LEGISLATE free content out of
existence.[1] So, if the *AA's had their way, your dialogue would go
something like:

>You don't want to pay for an mp3 that you can't share with your friends?

Fine. No music for you, because there's no longer any such thing as a
legal mp3 which you can share with your friends.

>You don't want to pay for a movie clip that will only play from 8PM-9PM
>on Tuesdays?

Fine. No movie for you, because there's no longer any such thing as a
legal movie file without time-shifting or space-shifting restrictions
built into it.


Of course it will still be possible to develop and procure *illegal* file
formats and players for movie and music files, but that's dangerous. When
something as normal as copying a movie or song, that you paid for, for
your personal use, is illegal, then it's a sign that there is something
horribly wrong with the law.

There have been two excellent articles written on the topic during the
past week, one on Salon[1] and one on Kuro5hin[2]. Do yourself a favor and
give them a read, if you care about this stuff.

besides this: if you feed your cat, and then wipe your nose with your hand, then maybe under your nose will smell like cat food, and then later on, when someone goes to kiss you, they will be thinking, "hmmmm, you smell like old fishy smell, dear....must of been hanging out with that fuzz ball again.."...but besides that, i was just wondering if anyone else who doesn't know anything about music or art might try to teach me a thing or two about it...like maybe, you could be my boss or something. :)

First of all-that has no bearing on anything.
If the day ever comes where all the content on the Internet can only be=20

Ok-first of all-TCPA is really nothing more than a hardware enryption=20

Yes, all of this *could* be done today through software.

The fact that the MPAA and the RIAA have the most to lose without DRM =
does=20
not mean it's a bad thing.
DRM is Digital Rights Management.
It's aim is to simply maintain control over a piece of content.
You remember DIVX?
(The limited-play DVDs, not the video codec)
Circuit city sold them-they were DVDs that would only play 3 times or =
so,=20
and you could buy them for cheaper than the normal DVDs.
Guess what-they flopped-but that's besides the point.
That was the essence of DRM-control over the content-
And it's not a bad thing.
You don't want to pay for an mp3 that you can't share with your friends?
Fine-don't buy it.
You don't want to pay for a movie clip that will only play from 8PM-9PM =
on=20
Tuesdays?
Fine-don't buy it.
Just like DIVX-people didn't want to buy  DVD that they could only watch =
3=20
times.
So they didn't...

This is for the most part true, but is *totally* phrased in an alarmist=20

The "well encrypted code" is meant to secure the machine.
And it will not be "controlled by Microsoft" in any way.

Incorrect-Hardware will *always* be tied to software.
You want to see Palladium in action?
Look at the XBox.

That's trivial and irrelavent-all of the existing fair-use wording 
(copying, reverse-engineering etc) applies to things that are "sold".
All "they" need to do is suddenly "license" the music to you instead of 
"selling" it to you and fair use goes out the window.
All of it-gone.Then you're left with a EULA, and you either agree to it or 
you dont.

I agree-but the DMCA is the problem, not Palladium.

Exactly-which is why I used DIVX as an example.
If the restrictions placed on content are reasonable, then it's not a big 
deal and nobody cares.
If the restrictions are *unreasonable*, then nobody will want it and it 
will fade away into nothingness.

Great-and are time-shifting and space-shifting restrictions going to be an 
issue for 99.9% of consumers?

Again-that will *all* be wiped out once content is "licensed" and not 
"sold".
IE: "Fuck you and your personal use, you agreed to the terms of what you 
can and can not do with this content when you opened the package."
It's not the nicest message, but hey-
You were told *exactly* what you could and could not do with it, you were 
told how much it costs, and then you were given a choice to buy or not to 
buy.

I've most likely read them-but I'll check and make sure.

Well that's great-and by your media player use above, I take it you run 
some version of windows?
I'll let the hypocracy bubble up in a fruity ether surrounding you...

Subject: [sfraves] Thursday S.F. IndieFest Benefit, and the return of the RAVE Act
 (fwd)

Courtesy of the SFLNC General Mailing List:

---------- Forwarded message ----------
From: SFLNC Information <info@sflnc.com>
To: SFLNC General List <announce@sflnc.com>

This Thursday, Feb 6th at 1015 Folsom: the creative energy from two
sub-cultures will come together in a powerful synergy! The San Francisco
Independent Film scene and the San Francisco Late Night scene have put
together a great night of art, film and music with an incredible line-up
of entertainment featuring short films and DJ's Ethan Miller, Dragn'fly,
Forest Green, Monty Luke, Jeff Richmond, 8-Ball, Tyler Reed, Jim Cyr,
Chris McGarry, and Mr. Lazy.

Ticket holders for the Opening Night Screenings at the Castro Theater
admitted free, all others $10. All proceeds benefit the San Francisco
Independent Film Festival.

Don't miss this one.  And keep on dancing!

Read more about this event at:
http://sflnc.com/index/events/special/28.html


Also, last week saw the reintroduction of last year's failed R.A.V.E. Act
under a new name, The Illicit Drug Anti-Proliferation Act (S.226). Despite
being rolled into an unrelated bill, it has the same sponsor and contains
many of the same chilling provisions intended to hold club owners and
promoters criminally responsible for the drug of use of their patrons.

I think we agree with each other for the most part, but I don't think
think the above is trivial. The problem is that the content industries are
trapped between "licensed" and "sold" content - they are trying to reap
the rewards of both models, but ultimately the contradictions may cost
them both.

If music is "licensed", then their push for DRM becomes mostly fruitless,
since my purchase of an aluminized polycarbonate music ownership token
implies that I have the right to time- and space-shift that content as I
see fit - it can't be dependent upon the medium, only on my license terms.
It essentially limits them to going after real 'pirates' - the ones who
sell counterfeit DVDs and profit from them without paying the *AA. It also
means that they will have to drastically change their methods of selling
music, including shutting down used CD stores and prosecuting DJ's. Do you
think any of that would fly in a court of law? The already collect on
every purchase of a blank CD, you know, so the argument that personal
piracy and CD duping is killing them will not go far.

If music is "sold", then their attack on the P2P networks becomes
irrelevant, because all that music came from someone who purchased a CD at
one time or another, an owner.

I think all the current hoo-haw is the result of them realizing that their
business model is being slowly flushed down the economic toilet, and that
the music company execs who still have their e-mail printed for them by
their secretaries don't have the faintest clue what to do about it.

"Let's sue the fuckers!"
"Which ones?"
"uh ... tricksterman@hushmail.com!"

They're thrashing. Picture the end of T-2. :)

I think the absolute opposite-if music is licensed, then the DRM that 
enforces that license is *key*.
Without it, everyone just ignores the license.

It *won't have* to fly in a court of law, because "strong" DRM will enforce 
the licenses; with only the hardcore pirates investing the time/resources 
to break it.
Isn't that what you want-the RIAA going after only the huge money-making 
pirates?

Not really-"free redistribution" is not listed under "fair use".

Well it *will* have to change-and bad as you say they are, what does the 
aftermath look like?
How is an artist in the digital realm ever to make a living when his works 
can be freely copied and redistributed by *anyone*?

Hopefully, the aftermath will be that the combined effect of lower music
sales and pressure from the music companies' corporate overlords (such as
Sony electronics - the vastly more profitable divisions that make money
from media duplication rather than content creation) will leave the RIAA
member companies unable to pay their legal fees, and the problem will sort
of take care of itself. These bungholes only have power to influence
congress so long as they have money to toss around.


>How is an artist in the digital realm ever to make a living when his

That's a completely orthogonal issue.

Personally, I don't think that anyone has an inherent right to make a
living from the duplication of content they have created. They have the
right to prevent others from doing so, thanks to the concept of copyright
(something I'm totally in support of, just not in its local bastardized
form). I know that's harsh--sorry, musicians--but I fail to see how
someone's desire to make money trumps my right to control the objects and
media in my possession in a reasonable way.

I'm perfectly comfortable with the fact that my position will make it
nearly impossible for David Geffen and Britney to vacation in the
Caribbean every year, but I don't fucking care. And I trust that in a free
market with a *massive* demand for music such as ours, someone will think
of a way to address that demand, and make money from it without trying to
legislate us into sticking with a lame distribution model.

shouldn't art be about the quality of the product, and not making money?  I 
don't think Michelangelo had dollar signs in his eyes when he covertly 
performed autopsies.

WTF?  You're totally out on a limb here.  If more people in this country 
were informed, by your paranoid logic, less people would vote, because the 
voter's didn't have any impact on the election to begin with.  Reality 
Check Time!  Bush was voted for!  Surprise!  If more informed people voted 
in the last election, Bush may have won the electoral AND the popular 
vote.  There's simply no way to know, so why bother throwing out guesses?

We do not live in the age of patron saints anymore.  If an artist cannot be
funded
through direct payment by the public for their art, they cannot live.  It's
that simple,
assuming all they do is art and they don't have a day job ;)

Exactly.  The only madman in power right now is SH.  It's probably more
likely the case that some would rather put their head in the sand and hope
nothing bad happens.  Heck, Clinton did that for 8 years, why not!?

No- he didn't at all- but therin lies my point.
Michelangelo devoted his entire life to his art.
You *can not* do that today unless you are either:
1) independantly wealthy
2) paid for your art

But there are non-profit rave promoters, and isn't throwing a rave an art?

I'm not sure I agree - in a recent discussion of potential ways to fund
music in a post-RIAA world, I heard that most broadway plays are funded in
an arts-patron model, with small groups of rich investors putting up money
and taking a personal financial risk for a play based on its probability
of success (think Bullets Over Broadway). I think this is a completely
viable model for covering studio costs, etc. Seems to me that the biggest
complaint I usually hear about the relationship between artists and labels
is the way that labels tend to really rape the artist on their initial
recording contract - having third party funding involved may help lessen
that, I think?

Well-what you describe is *exactly* the model of today.
What do you think the Record Company Execs are... Rich Investors perhaps?

That's exactly how record companies work today-
They front the money for studio time etc, betting that they'll receive more 
than that back through record sales etc.
No difference, except maybe the greed of the investors.

Yes, but thanks to organizations like the RIAA, there is pretty much no
way for a new investor to make it into that field. It's been clogged and
monopolized, from the A+R guys to the distribution channels.

My issue with the music business is not that it's rich, or that it chooses
to finance its music in a particular way, it's that it is an artificially-
maintained monopoly, which is losing its ability to compete in a
free-market, and is attempting to remove market freedoms to hold onto its
profits.

...And the fact that a grand total of five corporations own the vast
majority of labels, and that those five corporations collude to keep
prices artificially high.

Hmmm..

Say Honda is developing the '05 Civic.  They dream it up, they get the
CAD down, they design the dies, they get the molds together.  So, now
they've got all the tooling in place, and now they're manufacturing the
Civics like mad.  Now, imagine if a lobbyist from the consumer sector
started loudly proclaiming that car companies had no inherent right to
charge any more for these cars than the cost of the raw materials,
worker wages, machine upkeep, and power.  

Now, of course, the vast gulf between those costs and what a car sells
for represents the income of said car manufacturers and their vendors. 
However, if one breaks it down, the manufacture of a car represents
little more than a "duplication of content", only in this case metal,
plastic, and rubber substitute for the tray card, jewel case, liner
notes, and disc.  So why not give them away for cost, under the
paradigm you seem to suggest?  The design, functionality, and "je ne
sais quoi" that send you hurtling towards a certain car dealership come
from ideas, concepts, and work- nothing but synapses flashing.  

Of course, this sentiment would never fly.  In America, the general
idea is to make something people want, manufacture it, and sell it at a
profit.  Chairs, ovens, washing machines- these are tangible things,
and nobody's ever going to criticize anybody for profiting from them in
a capitalist society.  

Oh, but art, music, software, poetry- in their basic form, they are
ephemeral.  They exist only as ink on paper, data on a disc, a tune in
your head.  Creating the best of these things takes no less skill,
time, or work than making inanimate objects- yet listen to 'em crow
when the creators want to make a living!  

Because these things *are* ephemeral, and it's a given in this day and
age that people won't pay for something that isn't a physical object,
(no matter how much they want or need it) it becomes neccesary to put
music out on CDs, and to sell software in retail boxes.  

How many times have you heard, "Oh, this song is my favorite..  It
always makes me happy.  I got it off Kazaa, I figure musicians make
enough money."  Or, maybe, "I was going to go out and buy Photoshop,
but then I got it off of Limewire.  F*ck paying for software!"?  When
somebody's music or a dev team's app is fileshared it's no longer tied
to an inanimate object, so it's not worth anything, right? 

Now, why is that?  It still serves its function.  The creators still
did their work, and did the work it took to get to where they were when
they created it.  Whether you buy Windows XP in a store or install a
janky copy, your computer will still boot (maybe).  Whether you buy
music or fileshare it, it'll effect you in the same way.

So why do these people deserve to eat any less than the people who
design your cars?  The "mechanisms" surrounding car manufacture and
music sales alike are already in place.  On a grand scale, it's as
effortless (proportionate to cost/profit) to pop out a car from a
factory as it is to manufacture a CD.  It's the *thoughts* you're
buying when you spend your money.

I mean, if we can think of a better way to make money from art than
selling duplicates of it, more power to us- but that's the model on
which the world works for nearly everything that's bought and sold. 
It's unfortunate that those whose work is inherantly intangible get the
short end of the current stick.

Anyhow, cheers,
GeorgeC - biased-ass muso

Don't take me out of context, I said: "Personally, I don't think that
anyone has an inherent right to make a living from the duplication of
content they have created. They have the right to prevent others from
doing so, thanks to the concept of copyright (something I'm totally in
support of, just not in its local bastardized form)."

That's not what I said. I don't think Honda has an inherent right to make
money from cars, either. Creators of goods or services or products or
ideas risk their time, resources and energy for an expected return on
their investment. If Honda invests 5 years (the typical design ->
production cycle for a car) into their '05 Civic and it completely tanks,
then they lose money on it. They charge what they feel the market will
bear for a new product, and people either buy it or they don't - there's
no inherent right to profit at play, just an educated guess on what
consumers will want in 2005 and how much they might be willing to pay for
it.

Coming back to copyright, it exists in order to give a creator a limited
period of time during which they can choose how their ideas are put into
practice. You produce a track, and you own the copyright on that track
just by virtue of having created it.

Read more: http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/comment-bloom112202.asp

You can decide whether you want to bear production costs and sell it in CD
form yourself, transfer that copyright protection to a record label in
return for help with production costs and distribution, set up a
pay-per-download system on a website, or use it in a strictly live context
and recoup your productions costs from ticket sales. It's YOURS.

What copyright protection affords you is the guarantee that for a
reasonable period of time, no one can take away your right to decide how
you want to disseminate your creation to the world without your explicit
permission. There is no part of that bargain that guarantees that you
should be able to make a living from doing it - only that you have the
option to do so if you so choose and people are willing to pay.

The mistake of the DMCA is that it confuses legal and moral limitations
with technical ones (by treating copyright as a property of a piece of
content, rather than an agreement between its creator and its social
context), and that it rejects the value of a public domain in the creation
of new content, by favoring current owners of existing content over future
creators of new content.

Listen to ME crow when publishers inflate the costs of these things, and
fail to address the realities of a demand curve in order to spend time and
money trampling on the public domain in the service of a distorted reality
where Mariah Carey CD's are worth $16.00.

It's a newer model than one might think. Few hundred years old, tops, and
that's only in the domain of the printed word. Marketable ways to
reproduce audio have only existed for ~100 years, less for video. Our
beloved record companies only really started to capitalize on this around
the 1940's or so.

SF is filled with many talented people and venues/promoters looking for 
acts. We hope that Convergence will bring together many different
elements of art, music and talent from all scenes in Sf and NorCal, in a way 
not done before, let's call it communal promotion.  We hope that
Convergence will be an educational event that will enlighten people to
the prospects of music and art and culture in areas that they are not
often familiar with while giving people a chance to meet artists and
promote themselves

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Fwd: vote to impeach bush

no one on this list needs to vote to impeach bush unless you happen to be a
member of the house of congress.

1. Article I, which creates the legislative branch of government, in Section
2, para. 4 provides:
that the House of Representatives... "shall have the sole power of
impeachment"

we can scream and yell all we want, but only the house can do anything about
it.

Correct. That is why the web site (http://www.votetoimpeach.org) has users
fill out a form to encourage their representative to vote on impeachment.

I first saw the site earlier today and thought it was perhaps a scam since I
couldn't get reliable Whois information on it, nor had I heard about former
Attorney General Ramsey Clark's push for impeachment in the mainstream press
- you'd think someone of his stature would garner a mention in the network
news... 

So I researched it some more.  The domain belongs to International ANSWER,
so it's not a scam (though some on this list might find that debatable).
Content from both the Washington Post and NPR's web sites have coverage of
Ramsey's issues.  It's interesting, but from what I can find, it seems he's
been shooting for impeachment since Bush the Elder's ascension to the throne
in 1988. 

I think every President since Nixon has had calls for impeachment by some
group or party or whatever, so it's nothing all that novel. In fact, Nixon
resigned before the impeachment ever happened. Clinton was probably the
closest to it actually happening than anyone.  (To be technical, the term
only applies to the indictment of a president by the legislature - not the
ejection from office.)

There certainly are groups, as you described, who fund some art, but it's
not
the same as those artists who in days past were personally funded by one
person.
But yeah, you're right in part I think.  The label problem has been ongoing
since
as far back as I can remember.  What's lost now seems to be the larger more
viable "non-commercial" labels.  The big five are about all that's left with
national exposure, and that is sad and harmful I think.

here is something to attach multiple meanings to:

there are a lot of cool events coming up to celebrate valentine's day...how will you be playing it out this year? here is something NOT to do:

i am quite odd in appearance...someone who is also quite odd in appearance approached me yesterday (the canvasing is starting EARLY this year, EARLY)...he came up to approximately my waist in height, had one stable eye and one perpetually wandering one and a very slow drawling voice.. he says, "i like your hair...it is such a nice day...you look nice with your nice hair...why don't you tell me about yourself?" i told him that i am tired and that it was very nice that he would say such a thing to me, but that i did not feel like talking, and that i was on my way somewhere, and then he says, "i am looking for a valentine's date, and i thought since i like your hair...etc...etc....etc...." i DID NOT laugh my ass off until several hours later...i was good. i was very good. :)

This is the basic model for funding all new ideas/ventures, both business 
and artistic.  Investors risk capital in the hope of a return on that 
investment.

Once one has investors, however, one loses compete creative and other 
control.  Michelangelo had to modify his vision to accommodate  the needs 
of his patrons.

Very few artists, then and now, make a living out of artistic 
creation.  Most artists I know are driven above all things to share a 
vision;  monetary return is secondary.  If one launches into music or art 
with the focus on creation of personal wealth one will create nothing of 
value IMO.

One of the most important developments in the past twenty years has been 
the "democratization" of artistic creation through the use of new 
technologies.  Take film, for example.  In order to do any serious work in 
this medium in the sixties one required hundreds of thousands of dollars in 
investment to begin.  Now, using digital recording equipment and a computer 
hardware/software editing rig those desiring to make film need invest a few 
thousand for a low budget IF.  This might be funded from a full-time job or 
non-intrusive relatives and friends.

Certainly musical have much benefited from new technologies.  When the big 
corporate recording companies decided "disco" dance music was no longer 
viable, and new dance product was no longer readily available, those 
passionate about dance music turned to drum machines, synthesizers and the 
like -- new technologies -- to create what was to become house music, the 
first EDM genre, at a cost that was dramatically lower than previously 
required for producing vinyl recordings.

Now most high school kids have the hardware and software available to do 
basic remixing and new music creation.  These creations can be circulated 
via MP3 files, CDs, and other inexpensive media.  Soon, vinyl cutting 
machines will be available to those with higher end home studios.

Publishing, visual arts -- for all creative work, technology has changed 
the field of play forever.

It is here, with these newly democratized art forms, that true innovation 
now arises and will continue to flourish in future.  Just as street fashion 
is the origin of corporate clothing and other design, new and exciting art 
forms will increasingly arise from people who are not 
"professionals."  What is a professional these days anyhow?  A marketing 
manager?:)

Large corporations, to my mind, are the enemies of true innovation.  This 
is particularly true of the music and film industries.  The corporate, 
market-data driven mind sets have created nothing of great value here in 
many years.  Why anyone would bother to download most of that corporate 
shit is beyond me.

Most of my downloads these days consist of freely-shared EDM cuts offered 
from people all over the world,   I so believe, however, that I should pay 
for the vinyl I spin.  I'm not one of those people who go to the record 
store, create a list of new releases, and download them for use with Final 
Scratch for free.  I understand how little most of these small labels and 
artists make and I feel I should pay when I use their work.

But the record companies aren't concerned with me or EDM.  They wish to 
blame their failure to innovate on downloads.  We are all to pay for their 
lack of vision and corporate constipation.  Won't work.  Art has been set 
free -- democratized -- by technology.  The new "socialism."  People are 
getting together, forming collectives and other entities to share costs and 
resources.  Raving, that is, the art of throwing liberating parties, often 
by collectives, bypasses the money-making model of the club for the not for 
profit motive of artistic creation for the love of sharing a vision with 
others.  Although corporations want a piece of all this action, they just 
can't seem to take off their mind-constricting ties long enough to 
understand what's going down here.

Love,

Apollo

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR Palladium, M$, MPAA, RIAA and Intel....


That's nice.  I still don't want a mandatory signature algorhythm built
into my computer.  I don't want another piece of copy protection on there.
It's bad enough when I get artists from France visiting and I can't play
thier fucking DVDs on my notebook.  They authored the thing, they want me
to see it, I want to see it... oh, sorry... you are region trying to play
this on a region what-the-shit-out-luck-fuck-off player.  Imagine that
times ten and you've got a taste of what it's like to run a system that
only allows signed apps running signed content.

The DMCA is scary and Palladium is scarier.  File players that mandate
signatories are shit.  Would you buy a set of plates that only allowed you
to eat KFC on them?  It might be a nice idea if it wasn't Microsoft at the
helm, but they are.  Few the product that MS has unveiled that didn't end
up serving MS at the expense of others.  I was in the business when MS
released MS-word (amipro/word perfect knockoff including keystroke
compatibility modes), Excel (Lotus 123/framework), MS-Money (almost
verbatim knockoff of Quicken), Windows Media Player (Quicktime anyone?),
DirectX (apple's direct draw + SGI's OpenGL), IE (wow, netscape with
operating system level optimization), inclusion of then popular 3rd party
utilities in DOS5/6/Windows 95 (doubledisk, defrag, memory managers),
MS-Java (took a licensed Sun technology that could only be freely used if
it complied to Sun's open spec... and of course started deviating from it
from day one), Windows NT (and all it's descendants, are actually based on
a POSIX kernel... aka unix style multitasking / security / input-output
engine) etc and don't even get me started on C#, .NET, attempts at
subscription based O/S pricing with XP and all the other recent extensions
of their policy of copy, undersell and conquer (kids, for those of you who
slept through turn of the 19-20th century american history, this is
monopoly 101).

If actions speak louder than words, Microsoft doesn't give a FUCK about
intellectual property, their consumers or ethics unless it's spelled
ETHIC$.

The Palladium PC is as close as I ever want to get to having George
Orwell's vision of telescreens brought to life.  The only part he got
wrong is that it wasn't the government that was in control, but rather
large corporations with enough money to bend government and consensus
public opinion into a pretzel.  Where you want to go today doesn't
matter... it's all about where MS wants to take you and what they can get
for it.

Within years of that product's release and established viablity... expect
to see cost down versions of Windows that *only* allow playback of signed
documents of certain types (and oh how happy you'll be when you upgrade to
the 'media developer' version of windoze for *only* a $100 more)... expect
to see unsigned artists completely and utterly fucked... expect
subscription pricing model operating systems... expect to see renegade
file players creating a shitload of new formats to circumvent the issue...
expect the DMCA expanded to include 'suspect' configuration of
routers/networks/etc...

The solution?

DEMAND SUPPORT FOR LINUX & FREEBSD by software and hardware vendors (even
Darwin/Apple's osx is a good go between if you want ease of use and has
great support from the hardware/software communities).  If you know it,
tell you're friends about it and take the time to take a stand for freedom
of information.  Explain why there are many more advantages to "free"
operating systems than just no up front cost.  Add to that a free office
compatible suite, superior networking, games, performance, etc...  and
it's hard to believe that people don't at least consider it.  Shit, I've
made tracks on a linux box.  There's GIMP if you want to do graphics.
It's a direct lineage to the operating systems that gave us tcp/ip, ipsec,
file security, scripting, individual user environments, etc.  Most of them
come configured with perl, gcc (which allows you to create applications in
fortran, c, c++ and a host of other stuff), apache, ftp, ssh, kerberos,
locale support, and all that other stuff microsoft keeps bringing to the
market years after it works elsewhere.  And you can hack the piss out of
it to make it suit your needs without violating some stupid licensing
agreement you didn't even read (did you know that technically, modifying
your registry is against the default MS-EULA?).  Sound like too much?
Fine then, just get the RedHat disks and install it.  In less than an hour
you'll have all that stuff and you don't need to worry about any of it...
just point and click like you would on anything else.

Even if you are not mechanically inclined, you would not buy a car without
a hood that actually opened.  Let alone one that didn't speed, only would
change lanes after you had used the blinker first, or made you take a
breathalyzer before starting the engine.

Refuse to let anybody assume you are guilty until proven innocent.

I know both sides of this well.  I am a computer technician of multiple
disciplines, a DJ who plays other people's music and collects money for
it, a recording artist (new release coming out on Refined real soon
through Prime distribution!), a novice software developer, and legal owner
of a few hundred cds and licensed user of the software I use for making
music.

When you put everything else aside, the crisis we have is an ethical one,
theft sucks.

I have a serious issue with anonymous/mass file sharing, but I don't see a
problem with sending a friend of mine a copy of a song that made my day
when I hear they aren't having a good time.  In a time before the
internet, I might have sent it to them via mail.  When my neighbor asks to
use my lawn mower, I don't have a problem with that either.  Imagine if
you lent them your mower and it didn't work in anybody's yard but yours?

really?  as a developer/artist/designer specializing in digital media
formats, you are *SO* in a glass house on that one.  before you get mad,
let me add badass to the beginning of the above career description.  :)

I *should* be able to make the call whether a track I wrote is a numbered
original or a public domain gift and charge accordingly.  Taking something
that I made and saying it's yours to do with as you please is theft.

This issue is not new.  It's been covered.  By patent law, by copyright,
by licensing, by publisher's rights and organizations like
ascap/bmi/copyright control.  Hell, in music, I can't play a cover tune at
a coffee shop without forking up a few pennies to the publishing house
representing the original work, even if it's for free... why?  Cause if
it's at a place of business, my performance of their piece might have
lured people in.

What needs to be revised is the law pertaining to it.  Not operating
systems.  Get caught sharing a file to one friend, you're liable for
treble damages (the cost of the track or whatever) and a non-criminal
conviction for each download (aka no big deal).  Host a site with 1000
possible simultaneous connects with a criZzaX of Adobe Photoshop on it,
and you'll see that go away with even a modicum of proper enforcement
(especially if anonymous sharing is treated criminally).

Simply divert all the funds going to combat drug crime (remember it's ok
to take drugs if you feel bad to feel better, but if you feel ok and you
take drugs to feel better you're a felon), and put them into a more real
issue... that many people today feel somehow entitled to the work of
others at no cost regardless of the author's intentions for the work.

Steps *should* be taken, piracy is commonplace to the point that many
people laugh at me for paying for software or ask me why I bought it when
they could have flowed me a copy (and then they ask my RTFM questions..
*sigh*)... but the measures being taken by wintelamdwhatever are not in
the best interests of anybody but market momentum and those who benefit
from it and that *can* be swayed given a better alternative (and it
exists).

was that a rant...?

Agh, people keep skipping over the word "inherent" and thinking that I'm
advocating a public domain free-for-all. All I'm saying is that no one has
the right to make a profit on their idea, they just have the right to
DECIDE how the idea is going to be used - for sale, for freebies, for
whatever, for a limited time. The RIAA is confusing the two to its
advantage, and as a result so is everyone else.

Otherwise, great rant. :D

Everyone that responded to this thread (so far) is IT.  If your boss is
hella cheap, and won't give you a raise, by all means, make things
disappear.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Looking for RAM - stealing

open question to all the girls (and guys i guess) who worked in retail when they were in highschool
:

how many of you got arrested for stealing merchandise ?

was it pleasent ?

i didn't think so.

retail stores have strict policies that enforce prosecution for stealing.  but just because private
organizations don't, it doesn't mean that it is okay.  i once had a touchy situation where an
employee had stolen a laptop and another time when someone else had stolen an LCD projector... both
times i handled it by bringing it to the attention of upper management and handling it on a personal
level inside the organization.  both times the individual's reputation was tarnished to the point
that each left the company within 3 mos.  so i guess you people theiving from work have that going
for you... they will probably not prosecute *if* you get caught but it still doesn't justify it.

stealing is stealing.  i would no more steal stuff from work as i would steal a dj's needles at a
party (which seems to be happening all to often lately.)  or how about Terry's laptop that got
stollen last year at a small intimate bar that had maybe 30 people in it ?  i'll bet that if you
just ASKED your IT guys, they would GIVE you that old ram that was laying around.  why do you people
beleive that it is okay to take something that IS NOT YOURS ?

this all goes back to that post a week or so back about why there are no venues willing to open up
to the raver community... because many so-called "ravers" are disrespectful.  i keep waiting for the
"respectful ravers" to make that next evolutionary move in american dialect and start calling
themselves something else in order to disassociate themselves with the current publicly-percieved
"raver" community.

if you think  you deserve a raise, and they won't give you one, go find another job !  after you
re-examine the situation, maybe you *are* being paid accordingly and that you should just buck up
and foot the whopping 20 bux for the frivolous item you want (or ask a friendly group of friends for
help :)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Looking for RAM - stealing

happy was just asking if anyone has some laying around they could give him.
i guess nobody does :P

everyone else was advocating steeling stuff from work.

i suggest to those people, go steal some consumables like paperclips and
staples...  it should give that same "the man's not gonna keep me down !"
feeling of vengful satisfaction... while simultaneously re-enforcing that "i'm
too scared to ask for a raise because i'm subconsciously not confident in
my own abilities" stronghold "the man" has over you while you toil in
silent despairation.

Everyone that responded to this thread (so far) is IT.  If your boss is
hella cheap, and won't give you a raise, by all means, make things

*IF*

Nowhere did I justify stealing by avoiding prosecution.  I justified it by 
being underpaid (your boss is stealing from you).

Why would some IT guy feel free to give away RAM that wasn't his?

Keep waiting.

It's better to change the image of ravers than to invent some new label for 
the media to distort.

i was just considering the ammount of fake eye colors that have been going around, and besides the health factor, i generally think it is really wierd when i am talking to someone wearing those fake lenses...not because the color is not attractive, but because those things look like something out of michael jackson's "thriller" video...your real eye is covered up, so it looks like it died, but then, wow, it's like purple or something and perfectly stationary like a dead man. why the eye color trip, well, aren't you out picking out your outfit like everyone else for your next event or evening out? hmmm, maybe not...how 'bout we just shoot for a shower and a shave, and then we'll take it from there. :)

Good call, espicially when there's been a sort of resurgance of it lately.
Mostly in the midwest but numbers in the Bay Area are on the rise as well.

I know that casting your vote to impeach Bush is not going to make it happen. 
however, expressing your disapproval is a voluntary action that expresses 
your feelings on that particular matter. For many, people want to help make a 
difference, but they do not know how. That is why I send those forwards from 
internationalanswer. Many people have emailed me and told me that they went 
to the march because I told them about it. Very rewarding. I mean, some of 
you may not agree with it, some may want nothing to do with it, and I respect 
those opinions. For the rest of the people who do not want to see a possible 
Gulf War II, I send these for them. You can clown on me for sending them, but 
all I am trying to do is make a difference in this world...if that's a 
crime...indict me
Don't forget PLUR people,
Britty

Yes it is a rave related list, but you read the subject line, there is a big 
old NRR smack dab at the end of it.  Dont read it if you dont want to since 
it doesnt pertain to raves or raving.  But last time I checked raves and 
politics had a lot to do with each other.

If there's anything I've learned, raves and politics are inherently related.
For many people, raving goes beyond music and partying - it is a culture and
community that is affected by the policies that shape society at large.  As
such, many ravers are rightfully concerned with political decisions beyond
the little scope of the "party" scene, as they will ultimately affect how we
carry ourselves, what we are permitted to do, etc.

While the Bush administration's policies may seem to have little to do with
the hard house 12" you pick up in the record bin at your local store, its
philosophies and attitudes may very well end up affecting whether or not you
will have the right to play that vinyl for a crowd in the foreseeable
future.

Grow up? Who's the one virtually sticking his finger in his ears and going
"la la la la la - i can't hear you - la la la la la."

The practice of the First Amendment right to free speech is in itself a form
of support for this country. Much more so than the blind acceptance of the
words of one man without the "mandate of the people." The wish to censor
others, however, is something more fit for the likes of Baghdad or
Pyongyang. (Or the Ashcroft residence, if Iraq or North Korea's captials are
too exotic or too hard for you to identify.)

support your country???

This country was built from revolution against some of the same policies
that bush has implamented... Our country is set up so that we can get people
who we dont like out of office. But this is hard now that the balence of
power has disapeared.. Not even the Supreme court can have a say becasue the
100's of people who have been imprisoned under the patriot act cant apeal
becasue they dont get a trial...
The rave began as an underground form of social expression and DONT FORGET
IT. Music and politics are one, and never before rock in the 60's has this
been as true as in the rave scene. Besides, the political options of people
who are going to raves or promoting/producing raves is important, especially
now that alot of groups have been invouled in supporting no-profs and the
like. I say KEEP IT UP.. even if you dont agree with me at all I want to
hear what you have to say, because maybe *gasp* I'm wrong..

Peace,
Mystic

And now..


Just because I can


RAVE ACT RE-INTRODUCED IN TWO FORMS!

As we announced earlier this month, portions of the RAVE ACT appeared hidden
in another bill..

Full Text http://www.dancesafe.org/new/articles/s22.pdf

TAKE ACTION http://www.emdef.org/s22/action.html

Now, the RAVE Act, has become S226, the "Illicit Drug Anti-Proliferation
Act"

More Devious, and now with backing from the Coalition or Liscensed Beverage
Association, this bill hopes to end any sort of event which could even
concievably be associated with drugs. Same Story, New Packaging. This is
getting ridiculous, its time to tell our government that you cannot hope to
stop drug use by attacking a culture.

Full Text and Analysis http://www.emdef.org/s226/

Everyone just chill out. The purpose of the "NRR" subject tag is to
allow people that aren't interested in non-rave-related discussions to
delete messages without having to read them. If you don't like it, set
up a mail filter.

We all identify as "ravers", and many of us see the list simply as a
general discussion forum within that context. If we were to start
prohibiting "off-topic" posts, I really don't think many people would
stick around... The list offers very little *actual* rave-related
subject matter besides BSP's, anyway.

Shut your ignorant mouth..I didn't vote for Bush nor do I want his idiotic
ass running our country. You don't have to like any elected leader you dip
shit..That's why we have voting. Hey maybe we should ship everyone who voted
for our actual elected president Gore of to the middle east. You are aware
that Gore was the winner of the popular votes ;)

And this one time at band camp there was this big bush and the leader of the 
bandcamp made me cut it back with these little scissors, it took forever, 
really forever.  Then there was this other time at bandcamp when I had this 
dream that anyone who wanted to could like get involved in being somewhat 
intelligent on a huge mailling list that like uh...talked about cool stuff 
like sitcking my flute up your pussy....

blah blah blah blah

I'm glad I'm quitting the smoking of cigarrettes or this all may seem 
interesting.

Yes, but you know what the beauty of half of those people not knowing what is 
going on? They want to know. They have a desire to learn about the flip side 
of government and expressing their discontent in forms of mass (yet peaceful) 
protests. These people may not know a whole lot about what is going on, but 
they came out their for a reason...a desire of knowledge. I think it is 
absolutely beautiful. I didn't mean for all of you to get pissed and scream 
at each other over a government issue. I mean, ravers are supposed to be 
friends...I love all my raver friends. And you want to know where i was 
during the whole Clinton scandal thing? *sigh* I'm gonna hear about this 
one...I was still a kid. I didn't really know too much about it, and at the 
time I  was a minor. I have conservative republican parents (might I add i 
RESPECT their decisions in supporting Bush), and they wouldn't let me doing 
anything political. now i have moved away and am an adult. I can make my own 
choices...and slowly, my parents are learning to accept that. I guess what 
I'm trying to say is tolerance is key here. Jack, I respect your opinions and 
in return, i ask you respect mine. Its not that hard. If you don't want hear 
about the war or anything, just delete my messages :)
Thanks
Britty
True, but, I see your actions as inciting a negative reaction. Half the 
people that are marching don't know what the f**k is going on. I don't know 
myself 100% of what is going on. That is why we rely on a centralized 
government, whom we voted in, to take the responsibility of; (a) finding the 
correct information & (b) making proper decisions on that information. And I 
have to say, even with the internet, there are still some things that the 
common public, you and I, are not as they say "privy to".

I was there on that Saturday march down market street to "reverse protest". 
I just happened to be there having lunch. See how much you guys affected my 
life, lol? True, I was probably the only one, however seeing all these 
confused americans with their kids I think was the most sickening.

People are so blinded by this 2 party system and these negative lies 
concerning George W, that they will do anything they don't find 
liberal/"open minded". You see any protests in Indiana? I believe in PLUR as 
much as anybody. But, that has a flip side; I have no respect for others who 
choose to threaten my way of life, or have openly expressed ideas of 
destruction towards my home land. How do these people who wish us harm so us 
their peace, love, unity, and respect? By building bombs? Flying planes into 
buildings? Kidnapping American tourists in foreign lands? Burning our flag?

You know what the funniest observation I have had about this whole thing? 
The way nobody said anything when billy nilly clinton went to way in the 
Anglo-Saxon Former Yugoslavian region, which was really only an attempt to 
cover up his then infamous sex scandal.

Where was your international group then when clinton was helping murder 
people and using your money to drop bombs?

GOTTA LOVE PLUR.

WOW. Mr. James, you are doing a wonderful job of representing Bush
supporters with your eloquent language and faultless reasoning. I hope that
everyone is paying close attention to your words and gaining a greater
understanding of what it is to be a true-blue, red-blooded, Bush-supporting
American. You should be commended for your exemplary behavior.

Wow-what insightful, intelligent commentary-

Guess I should move to Iraq too then?
Just because I believe Bush is the worst thing to happen to this country in 
a *long* time?

Hahah go blind allegiance!

Or, as someone else, on another list, is fond of saying: "I'll still be an

Seriously, think about all the innocent peoples lives that will be affected
if we go to war with Iraq. The world seemed like a peaceful place to live
with Clinton was in office. Honestly I think it's a bad idea for any
religious freak to be in office, I think Bush thinks he needs to get
Armageddon started. Out of all of the countries in the world we seemed to be
the only one concerned with Iraq. It's very reassuring to know that Bush has
stake in the oil their country produces. I think in the future they should
only allow people in office who have no ties to major companies that would
benefit from starting a war and taking over that counties business. You can
keep believing every word out of that mans mouth, but as far as I'm
concerned he is a bold face liar.

Although most people are aware of the dangers of alcohol, I think this is 
good to bring up every once in a while.  Also its probobly one of Gerri's 
more sane postings.  And it has a point to it.....

Wow...peace, love, unity and respect in action.  Thanks for your refreshing 
and moving response, Kevin.  I'm sure we all learned something here.

Further, discussion of the moral implications of war is certainly, to my 
mind, "rave-related."  Time we all looked at our beliefs.  Many of us 
sincerely believe a war of aggression -- pre-emptive warfare -- is immoral 
under any circumstances.  Most of the Christian churches seem to hold this 
belief, although this position seems to have been overwhelmed in recent 
discussion of this issue.

Love,

Apollo

   I am sorry but just like my language has offended some of you, the existence of this thread on this list has offended me. I 'm sorry but this thread has no relevance on this list and while I may be able to delete it, I SHOULDN'T HAVE TOO! 
There is nothing rave related about it. Is this the sfraves list or the sfsaywhateverthefuckyouwant list? I didn't sign on to this list to hear peoples oppinions about Bush, Iraq or politics that do not DIRECTLY affect the rave scene. I should not have to unsub from the list and miss out on info that I might actually want to know because I don't want anti BUSH propaganda littering my inbox. I dont spam people with info about my beliefs and I sure the hell don't want people from this list spamming my inbox with CRAP like this thread.

look Kevin, it sounds like all you want are the BSP's... so this is what you
do...

1) setup a mail filter within yahoo to move all emails with "BSP" in the
subject line into a folder named "BSP"... set this rule as the highest
priority within yahoo... you will still need to create a folder named "BSP"

2) setup a mail filter to move all emails with SFRAVES (or even just "NRR")
into the Trash... set this rule as the second priority within yahoo...

and wah lah! no more anti-bush propaganda!

So should everyone else not talk about things they wana talk about because
you don't feel it's rave related? Get over yourself it's called filters!
Here
http://www.techtv.com/callforhelp/answerstips/story/0,24330,2450945,00.html
those directions might be to complicated for you but if you can figure it
out, anything that says
NRR will go into your deleted items. Then you can spend your whole day
reading about raves ;)

some things have happened in the cat world lately...bear with me, i PROMISE, the hot sex is coming up really soon...:)....a few weeks ago, a small cat wandered into where i live...it wandered in, and i didn't see it leave, but i haven't seen it since, so i have been presuming that it is gone, however, every time i enter, i always call out in a little voice that i use to talk to animals: "any extra kitties here? are there any extra kitties hiding out? any extra kitties?"..i don't want to be the preverbial cat woman...the one who collects the cats and secludes herself...that is why i go out without cats and have affairs with people. :)....on my way out the door today, a small, gray kitten came up to me though....i stopped, and it walked right up to me, and stood extra close to my leg like they do sometimes...it just stood there all pressed up against my leg looking around at the world before it wandered off again. i will try not to worry about the little thing. we are all surogates, whether we want to be or not at times...i love the kitties....i love the boys too....when they are nice and not covered with fleas. :)

maybe you should unsubscribe then?  if you're incapable of setting up 
filters, and you're offended by politics, you should probably leave.

The Clinton years certainly did allow Bin Laden to gather his forces and
make his
plans lol.  What was Clinton doing?  Oh yeah, bombing Yugoslavia; a problem
that
had ZERO consequences for Americans or anyone who was not from Yugoslavia.
Great foreign policy, send our guys and gals to die in Bosnia, whoopee!
We'd have
taken the oil in '91 if we'd wanted it, get off the "it's about oil" drugs
and wake up to
reality, all y'all :)

Subject: Re: Fwd: [sfraves] Fwd: vote to impeach bush [Pretty NRR]

No, we backed out in 91 because of the fact we got our oil back..  Bush
wasn't allowed to proceed with the routing of the Iraqi government.   Not to
mention it was Bush and Regan that helped train and arm Bin Laden in the
first place... its all a never ending cycle of violence.  In the Clinton
era, yes we helped out in Yugoslavia, maybe we should've focused on the
issues in Afghanistan, both were bad at that time and neither had anything
to do with the US.  Sure, looking back its easy to say we should've disarmed
bin Laden but how do you route a terrorist network that we were still
somewhat allies with as well as going into a country with a very bad human
rights policy without starting the holy war then.  Back even further when we
were alllies with Iraq against Iran, Saddam wasn't that bad a guy to us.
Starting to see a pattern here?  We need to stop sticking our hands where
they don't belong unless maybe asked for because all we've been getting from
the middle east is dog bites back attacks.

What we are really missing in this country is an understanding of other 
cultures and basic history.  There has been an ongoing conflict between the 
West and Arab nations for thousands of years.  The Persians (modern Iran, 
Iraq and other Mid-Eastern states) had a war with the Greeks that lasted 
hundreds of years.  Athens was burned to the ground.  Alexander the Great 
unified the Greek states and conquered Persia.  In Iran Alexander is still 
remembered as the "horned one" who ended the Persian Empire.

When Mohammed died the former Persian nations united and sacked the Eastern 
Roman Empire, taking Constantinople and bringing to an end Christian-Roman 
rule in what is now Turkey.

Then we had the religious wars.  Crusades.  Arabs invading 
Europe.  Christians invading Arab lands.  Most recently, the Ottoman Empire.

Much of the drama in the Middle East is really the result of the decisions 
made by the Western colonial powers in the nineteenth and twentieth 
centuries.  Many "nation states," including Iraq, were created with 
boundaries that did not represent any tribal or cultural needs.  The 
horrors in Palestine began when the English decided to create a Jewish 
state there during WW II.  Had there been no anti-semitisim in Europe and 
the United States at the time the Palestinians would still have there 
homeland intact.

One could go on.  Nothing...nothing is simple here.  Arab culture is 
ancient and very sophisticated, and I believe the roots of terrorism and 
conflict here lie in the desire of this culture to be received with respect 
and equality in the community of nations.

Love,

Apollo

This is hella funny. Not that I associate anything with it.....Well there was all those Thursday Mornings for two years!! right all you old skool Stereophonik/ Killa Subz Guys..

Enjoy

Keith Edwards

PS the Buzz on the street -----Stereophonik---- Will return soon!!!!!!!!!

 

 

 

One Star Hangover (*) 
No pain. No real feeling of illness. You're able to function relatively 
well. However, you are still parched. You can drink 5 sodas and still feel  this way. For some reason, you are craving a steak & fries. 


 Two Star Hangover (**) 

 
 No pain, but something is definitely amiss. You may look okay, but you 
have 
the mental capacity of a staple gun. The coffee you are chugging is only 
 increasing your rumbling gut, which is still tossing around the fruity 
 pancake from the 3:00 AM, Waffle House excursion. There is some definite 
 havoc being wreaked upon your bowels. 
 
Three Star Hangover (***) 
Slight headache. Stomach feels crappy. You are definitely not productive. 
 Anytime a girl walks by you gag because her perfume reminds you of the 
flavored schnapps shots your alcoholic friends dared you to drink. Life 
would be better right now if you were home in your bed watching Lucy 
reruns. 
 You've had 4 cups of coffee, a gallon of water, 3 iced teas and a diet 
Coke 
 --- yet you haven't peed once. 


 

 

Four Star Hangover (****) 



 Life sucks. Your head is throbbing. You can't speak too quickly or else 
you 
 might puke. Your boss has already lambasted you for being late and has 
given 
 you a lecture for reeking of booze. You wore nice clothes, but that can't 
 hide the fact that you only shaved one side of your face. (For the ladies, 
 it looks like you put your make-up on while riding the bumper cars.) Your 
 eyes look like one big red vein, and even your hair hurts. Your sphincter 
is 
 in perpetual spasm, and the first of about five shits you take during the 
day brings water to the eyes of everyone who enters the bathroom. 


 Five Star Hangover, (*****) 
 You have a second heartbeat in your head, which is actually annoying the employee who sits in the next cube. Vodka vapor is seeping out of every pore  and making you dizzy. You still have toothpaste crust in the corners of your  mouth from brushing your teeth in an attempt to get the remnants of the poop fairy out. Your body has lost the ability to generate saliva so your tongue is suffocating you. You don't have the foggiest idea who the hell the stranger was passed out in your bed this morning. Any attempt to defecate results in a fire hose like discharge of alcohol-scented fluid with a rare  'floater' thrown in. The sole purpose of this 'floater' seems to be to  splash the toilet water all over your ass. Death sounds pretty good about 
 right now....

No, we backed out because fullfilled the mandate set by the U.N. which was
the liberation of Kuwait.  Correct me if i'm wrong, but Iraq has been in
control
of its oil since the end of the Gulf War (witht the exception of those
fields in
the North which are under Kurdish control).   Yes, we definately should have
focused on Afghanistan and let Europe deal with Yugoslavia, where were the
liberals then shouting "no war in Yogoslavia"?  There were not any.  It's ok
when a democrat decides to use armed force lol.  We were allies with Bin
Laden during Clintons tenure?  Really....b.s.  In other words, Clinton
wussed
out because it was hard, typical Clinton.  We were never allies with Iraq
btw,
that's just not true at all.   We aided Iraq to the point that the Iran Iraq
war
was a stalemate, which if i'm also not mistaken was achieved.  We easily
could have aided to the point that Iraq won, we did not.  If we did not aid
then Iran would have won, we kept the balance of power between them,
that was our goal.

not really.  Bush Senior helped the Taliban gain power and sold them weapons.

We did - we backstabbed Iraq and attacked them for taking over Kuwait, who 
was slant drilling into Iraq's oil reserves, after we told Iraq they could 
do the right thing and invade Kuwait.

Clearly, some people will believe anything to keep the same mindset.  No 
one has to be on drugs to realize that our involvement in the middle east 
is purely oil related.

---Sometimes you just don't know what you're going to get, but it was a shot
in
the dark after preventing the Soviets (remember them?) from taking the whole
country and folding into the USSR.  I agree, it sucks, but it wasn't and
probably
couldn't have been foreseen.  We should have, imo, started in the last 90's
after hearing
the distressing reports (especially concerning the treatment of women) to
petition
the UN for change in that country.

There were allegations of slant drilling of up to 300,000 barrels a day.
Where was Mr.
Hussain in the UN giving the Kuwaitis time to prove they were not slant
drilling or, if so,
to stop?  You make it sound like Iraq had every right to invade over 300,000
barrels, rape,
kill, cause environmental disaster, and so on.  Wanna show me where we told
Iraq it was
okay to invade Kuwait?  Believe it when I see it, and i'll never see it
cause that's a load of crap.

Our involvement in the middle-east is much related to oil and other
interests (yes, other
interests) as well.   But one has to be on drugs to think it's our only
motive there.  I'm
thinking the Venezuela would be an easier target for our troops, and we get
sooooo much
more oil from that country and it's  a lot closer and so on.  Why oh why
didn't we send in
the marines to get those people back to work and quit screwing up the
production of oil?  Oh yeah,
the Venezuelans don't have weapons of mass destruction, a history of
genocide against its own people,
a history of attacking its neighbors, etc.

Kevin James sayeth:

 I dont spam people with info about my beliefs and I sure the hell don't
want people from this list spamming my inbox with CRAP like this thread.
Kj

So sayeth I:

But YOU are spamming us with your beliefs or do you not see that?

Personally I think this thread or at least the origins of it, not what it
has become, has much more validity for this list than say one of Julies
ramblings about her latest lipstick or the value of thongs!

Our freedoms and our governments effect on the world has much to do with
everyone on this list whether you believe it or not. If one is to condemn a
thread merely because they don't agree with it then don't read the thread.
It's presence in you inbox shouldn't cause so much distress. It's not as if
you are being forced to read it. As suggested, you can always filter this
NRR mail and it won't ever grace your inbox again.

First, I suggest you clarify your attributions.

Second, review the history of the Persian Empire more carefully.  I'm not 
sure what you mean by "1965" vs today's historical perspective, but I'll 
bet you more people could identify the geography of the Middle East  in '65 
than in '03 -- let alone historical background:)

Third, you want to make this into a religious conflict.  My suggestion is 
that historically this goes way beyond religion and, again, back to very 
ancient conflicts.  The Persian Empire did include Iraq, and Baghdad was 
one of the Imperial Persian courts.

For your edification, here is a brief chronology of the Persian 
Empire.  You can find it in any history book.

630-553 BC: Zarathustra
559-530 BC: Reign of Cyrus the Great
559 BC: Cyrus the Great overthrows Astyages of Media
546 BC: Persians conquer Lydia
538 BC: Persians conquer Babylonia
530-522 BC: Reign of Cambyses
525 BC: Persians conquer Egypt
522-521 BC: Civil War
521-485 BC: Reign of Darius
Reorganizes the government into satrapies.
Builds an extensive system of roads.
521-519 BC: The Empire is extended beyond the Indus River
490 BC: Attempts to conquer the Greek mainland.Persian War Chronology
485-465 BC:Reign of Xerxes
480 BC: Makes a second attempt to conquer the mainland Greeks.Persian War 
Chronology
465-338 BC: A Period of Imperial Decline
465-424 BC: Reign of Artaxerxes I Longimanus
424-404 BC: Reign of Xerxes II
404-358 BC: Reign of Artaxerxes II Mnemon
358-338 BC: Reign of Artaxerxes III Ochus
336-330 BC: Reign of Darius Codomannus
330 BC: Alexander the Great conquers the Persian Empire Rise of Macedonia 
Chronology

Mohammad  was born, according to Muslim historians, on April 20, 571.  By 
the time of the Mongols Islam was already on the rise.  The Persians were 
pagans.

As for a discussion of the Middle East, one really must examine the impact 
of the British rule of Palestine and much of the strife that now exists in 
the region.

Love,

Apollo

What I mean is that the people and more importantly politicians of today are
not
as ignorant as they were 30 or more years ago.  I'm sure you wouldn't be
surprised
to know how many U.S. Congressmen(people?) didn't know where Vietnam was, or
things along those lines.  Certainly we can be more sensative, but I don't
think we lack
understanding in the ways we once did.  Can you imagine a politician or
newsperson in
1955 asking questions about Ramadan?  I can't.  But we do today.  That's all
i'm saying.

Being part of the imperial persian courts and *beiing* persian are two
different things.  And no,
I think current issues do not date back beyond about 1,300 A.D. or so.
History does, sure,
but not the current problems between Muslims and Christians.  As a matter of
fact during the
Dark Ages there were many Christian enclaves in the Islamic middle-east that
were allowed
more or less autonomy both religiously and in their own governing.  Ask
yourself, why was that?
Ask yourself, why could that never happen now or in fact in the past 600
years or so.

My point about Persia is that it did not end as a power / empire until the
invasion
by the Mongols.  The Persia of 1,000 was smaller than the Persia of 300
B.C., but it
was every bit as robust and powerfull.  This ended in 1253, and they've
never been a power
since then.  The Mongols saw to that.

It's a subject I choose not to get into.  One could go back to the time when
the jewish people
were the rightfull owners of the land called Palestine later.  It's just not
worth discussion in a more
"broad" discussion of what's wrong now in the middle-east and why.  :)

Subject: [sfraves] off-topic list content - does the list moderator do any moderadation?!

A little food for thought.  I hear the term PLUR in the scene and I 
think it has something to do with the following:

I joined this list to communicate with the underground and to discuss 
the rave culture in the Bay Area.  I'm really disappointed that the 
content doesn't stay focused.  The whole idea of an email list is to 
provide a forum for the discussion of a selected topic, so that you 
don't have to sort through large quantities of information to find what 
you are interested in.  If I was interested in conversations about US 
politics, war and foreign relations I would look at lists like 
talk.politics.mideast, alt.politics.bush, alt.activism, soc.culture.iraq 
to list just a few.  

So, with that in mind, for lists to operate as they were intended, 
everyone participating has to have some basic list ettiquite and show 
respect for the list members individually and the list community, by 
keeping posts and contributions to the agreed upon topic. When 
individuals don't behave, it effects all of us.  It's our list 
moderator's job to keep discussions on track, which occasionaly requires 
reminding members of expected behavior and taking corrective measures 
like kicking people off for repeated spamming
 
Remember, each message you post to sfraves gets copied to about 2500 
members!! Don't you think it's extremely selfish, disrespectful and 
ignorant to make off-topic posts, especially when people ask for it to 
stop?  

I'm publicly putting out a request for moderation.  Does our list 
moderator care to contribute to this conversation?  If not, maybe we 
need a new moderator...

That's it for now and,
think before you post!

-Stephen

My dear Piers, the first crusade was in the Middle Ages, not the 
Renaissance.  1065 AD it was. Persian culture, transfused with Greek, was 
to become what we see as Middle Eastern civilization today.


>History does, sure,

The differences between East and West predate Muslims and 
Christians.  Period.  Religious differences are not the only things that 
divide these cultures...and you can't blame it all, as I sense you do, on 
the "J" folk.

Enough of this.  I'm going watch a film about religious fanatics:)

Thank you for sharing your opinion with all 2500 of us and filling our 
mailboxes with non-rave related information/spam instead of directly 
emailing the moderator.  Your Ad Populum scheme might get you somewhere, but 
I'm not sure which direction you're headed.  Believe it or not Stephen, this 
topic arises quite often and generally has the same result.  Ravers, who are 
members of SFRaves.org, post what they find relavent to the rave community.  
A lot of what you might consider spam, directly or indirectly affects raves 
and ravers in ways that you may not have the capacity to comprehend.  Don't 
worry though, most of us have to deal with ignorant people all of the time.  
The serious problem I see on this mailing list is people who don't have the 
patience to understand a topic and how it affects their rave realted world.  
In all sincerity, politics, war, comedy, horror, and nonsense all have a 
role in our culture and I think it would be a shame if objectivity standards 
and restrictions were placed on posting.  Just some "food for thought," that 
I thought I would fill your tiny little box with.  Um, yeah... -Trendy-

PS, if you are so concerned with this list, why don't you make your own and 
enforce any Stalinesque or Maoesque restrictions on who can post and what 
they can post about? Just some food for thought. -T-

And where was your "love it or leave it" self when the crassness flew
earlier?  Yes, it's a list about
more than just raves, but when it goes off the handle as it did early a
moderator should step in and
the persons question your replying to below has some merit.  Calling them
Stalinists just makes you
look like an elitist who's "ok" with things that you think are "ok" and not
"ok" with things you feel like
getting pissy over.  Double standard.  Their question was legitimate

This is true. But keep in mind that the people, (at least from my
point-of-view, the heavy hitting posts) are from real-to-the-core ravers
having a discussion about NRR topics. imho I'm glad to see it.

Point taken. I would review w/ Brian, Karina + all the other
stake holders, except this list collectively dictates what it decides to
be. It has always been like that.

I see this list as a point of congregation for
sf-ravers in the online community. If impending war is more important that
so-and-so's beats or wherz the party at?, than so be it. This list
sways from topics more than
"Days of our Lives", yet the content is so much more real and relevant. I
don't see any problem with the current influx of threads on war.

Actually, the list gets about 600 now, the digest+others brings it up
about 20%. People who join this list should know they're entering an onine
community, not a gaming strategies forum, if not they will quickly find
out. Certainly SFRaves requests general nettiquette, but our topics are
more loose. Do you think all our US soldiers in the mid-east are *only*
talking about war? Just put NRR if the topic is "Non Rave Related".

Ug. again. Dood, I read every single day's posts, for 8 years ago. I know
the list is heavy on NRR. I read all the flames. What would you like me to
moderate?

Actually 1095 AD is a more appropriate time to say the Crusades started.
And I
never said that the crusdades started in the Renaissance, just that they
were the
wellspring for the bitterness which was to follow between the muslim and
christian
world.  The crusades were the seed, the renaissance was the folliage that
followed
and has been the thorn ever since ;)  There were certainly a couple hundred
years
or so of germination, my dear Apollo.

The "J" folk are the jealous folk.  And these folk are everywhere, and
always will
be.  That's the word, and coupled with the history of the middle-east, the
"our way
is the only way"-ness of Islam, and so forth we are now where we are and
have been
since the 1400's (well before colonial times, as I said).  If the situation
were reversed,
i'm sure it would be a mirror image.  When you're down, devided, and on your
ass,
there's nothing like finding a common "enemy" to unite you.  They did it in
the
crusades (hint hint), Hitler did it, the Japanese have done it, and the
militant Muslims are
doing it, moreso now than ever before.  Add the teaching of their religion
(and ours) into
the mix and you have a very rank stew.

I've been here for 8 years myself -
Terry is definitely one of the /great/ moderators
this list has been blessed with

if you don't get pissed off at least once in a while by
something somebody posts - you're just not
paying attention - and, I think, that is part of
the whole point

I don't post publically very often anymore -
a lot of us don't - but we're still here - and we're
still interacting with each other and making
new friends - Terry rocks

Namaste

because sfr is basically a community that has roots in underground events. 
you know, underground parties don't have to be such a secret that they 
require a scavenger hunt and shirlock holmes style "clues", or being some 
kind of elitest who is just "in the know" to find them. - johnny bzzzz

Subject: RE: [sfraves] off-topic list content - does the list moderator do any moderadation?!

shut the fuck up man. you joined the list well-aware that it's high-traffic, 
you know what to delete and filter what you want. personally, it think it's 
cool to have a list where people from the techno scene can discuss whatever 
they want. at least it's opinions from people who are on the same general 
wavelength as you, and not so much cocky politicians who subscribe to 
politics.bs.whateveryouwant only.
btw, i think there's supposed to be some low-volume version of the list.

Um... KJ, if you honestly believe 'your momma' comments weren't meant to
be offensive minutes after you sent them in bona fide anger, then I can
see how you appreciate the same consistency in a president.  If you'd like
to change the tide of this thread by talking about all the great things
that Bush has done for dance culture, freedom of arts, and personal/civil

i am up for any discussion, and if not, then we are already a dictatorship =

few months (maybe year or something), but  I aways been doing my lil' =
job if U been seeing me pass stuff out @ clubs or Raves!

Oh yeah, but hey, if you're not on the SFLNC mailing list yet, get on =
it!!  This is a minimum of like 2 emails a month @ most... may be 3 or =
4! =3D)  But this will keep you informed about what's happening, events =
going on that SFLNC is a part of or throwing, & sometimes a call out to =
you about showing up somewhere to represent our Culture like having a =
Groover Army showing up @ City Hall!

So yeah... the link's on top there if U wanna click it & explore the =
World of SFLNC!! =20

Oh oh oh... if you're like interested in knowing, I've been with SFLNC =
for the past like almost 3 years now!  It was Aryck who persuaded me to =

for it or something like that!  Then through meetings, boothing, & =
random Grassroots stuff, Angelica became my mentor, Homegirl, & Sister!  =
But yeah, I've steadily maintained my postion in Grassroots since I 1st =

---Sometimes you just don't know what you're going to get, but it was a =

There were allegations of slant drilling of up to 300,000 barrels a day.
Where was Mr.
Hussain in the UN giving the Kuwaitis time to prove they were not slant
drilling or, if so,
to stop?  You make it sound like Iraq had every right to invade over =
300,000
barrels, rape,
kill, cause environmental disaster, and so on.  Wanna show me where we =
told
Iraq it was
okay to invade Kuwait?  Believe it when I see it, and i'll never see it
cause that's a load of crap.

Our involvement in the middle-east is much related to oil and other
interests (yes, other
interests) as well.   But one has to be on drugs to think it's our only
motive there.  I'm
thinking the Venezuela would be an easier target for our troops, and we =
get
sooooo much
more oil from that country and it's  a lot closer and so on.  Why oh why
didn't we send in
the marines to get those people back to work and quit screwing up the
production of oil?  Oh yeah,
the Venezuelans don't have weapons of mass destruction, a history of
genocide against its own people,
a history of attacking its neighbors, etc.

What I mean is that the people and more importantly politicians of today =
are
not
as ignorant as they were 30 or more years ago.  I'm sure you wouldn't be
surprised
to know how many U.S. Congressmen(people?) didn't know where Vietnam was, =
or
things along those lines.  Certainly we can be more sensative, but I don't
think we lack
understanding in the ways we once did.  Can you imagine a politician or
newsperson in
1955 asking questions about Ramadan?  I can't.  But we do today.  That's =
all
i'm saying.

Being part of the imperial persian courts and *beiing* persian are two
different things.  And no,
I think current issues do not date back beyond about 1,300 A.D. or so.
History does, sure,
but not the current problems between Muslims and Christians.  As a matter =
of
fact during the
Dark Ages there were many Christian enclaves in the Islamic middle-east =
that
were allowed
more or less autonomy both religiously and in their own governing.  Ask
yourself, why was that?
Ask yourself, why could that never happen now or in fact in the past 600
years or so.

My point about Persia is that it did not end as a power / empire until the
invasion
by the Mongols.  The Persia of 1,000 was smaller than the Persia of 300
B.C., but it
was every bit as robust and powerfull.  This ended in 1253, and they've
never been a power
since then.  The Mongols saw to that.

It's a subject I choose not to get into.  One could go back to the time =
when
the jewish people
were the rightfull owners of the land called Palestine later.  It's just =
not
worth discussion in a more
"broad" discussion of what's wrong now in the middle-east and why.  :)

Hahahah, yeah but I still maintain that the politicians are much more
knowledgable and 40 years ago 9 out of
every 10 people polled would have thought Western Europe was in the East
Indies :)

There was actually a poll I read some 12 years ago that asked the question
to women:

"Do you put on your underwear first or your panty hose?"

40% were not sure!!  What I wanna know is, who the hell decided this was an
important poll and question to ask??

the way i see it is that this list has a certain "direction" or "focus" and
that is not always Rave Related... i have been on this list for about 3
years now and there are many people who have been on this list a great deal
longer...

For someone to just show up and start saying that it should change is
proposterus (sp?)! this list has always been like this, if you dont like it
then either learn how to use mail filters or leave and create your own list!
topica.com and yahoogroups.com will both allow you to create your own

Subject: Re: [sfraves] off-topic list content - does the list moderator do any moderadation?!

Remember when you first got on this list Tim? THAT is what high traffic and
low signal to noise ratio really is. When people start bitching about too
much being posted on SFR in the last year it makes me laugh. Folks, a few
years back when raving hit it's MTV primetime peak this list BLEW UP. There
were times when I would get well over 250 emails a day. Most of them riddled
with petty flamewars and NRR topics such as you see now. If anything SFR has
calmed down.

If the traffic on this list is too much and you can't deal with the topics
being posted - leave. There is no contract to be signed when you join so
you're free to go. If you like to whine and bitch about how things aren't up
to your standards, well, go for it. You will get a backlash from the
community if you choose to do so. That's the power of this list. The coice
and ability to say what you want. Moderation only comes into play when
absolutely necessary. Asking Terry to *moderate more* is akin to censorship.
The list wouldn't survive as it has with such governing.

Subject: [sfraves] Headphone Health

Ok, I just got this from some entertainment industry newsletter (Cynopsis):

<<Friday Fun Fact: Wearing headphones for 60 minutes will increase the
bacteria in your ear by 700 times.  Ok, that's gross.>>

I wonder what the ear infection rate for DJs is. That's it, I'm only playing
20 minute sets from now on. Fewer ear infections, fewer trainwrecks!  ;)

I have yet to see a broad discussion from you Piers.  Your view is quite 
narrow IMO.

I'm on another raves list...azraves...it's the same thing except in
Arizona...and when I say the same thing I mean the exact same thing.

it's an endless river of speech.

the only thing to do is sift thru it like a prospector seeking gold.

And what's going to happen to that goat? A *5* room masquerade party in a
true bay area location with a goat. Now who can complain about that?? If you
haven't bought tickets you should quickly. I'm rather board with parties,
but I'm sure as hell not missing out on this one!

 any moderadation?!

Thanks for the feedback Terry, Jim and everyone.  This whole topic seems 
controversial within the group, some on one side, some on the other, 
some don't care.  I wanted to feel out where everybody was at on this. 
 It's not the way I'm used to lists operating though, but I'm not going 
to unsubscribe over it.  
A couple of things:  I'm disgusted with politics, government, 
censorship, and mass media;  I haven't watched TV in 6 years, I've been 
roaming the 'net since 1990 and am DOWN for the freedom of information; 
 freedom of speech is powerful but if it's disorganized it's not as 
potent; this country is nice place to live but I'm in no way interested 
in being 'American'.

-Stephen

It's not a double standard.  Everyone needs to understand that topics other 
than the next BSP are permissible on the list.  The politics thread had NRR 
in the subject line from the second email, and conformed to filtering 
objectives.  If Stephen doesn't like that, he should leave, because it's 
not going anywhere.  There's far too much traffic on this list for 
full-time moderation.  We tried it.  I'm sorry Stephen doesn't remember or 
didn't bother to check the archives.

It's like watching a video game being played. Only difference is those

Doesn't that seem just a bit unfair to the goat to be forced into a party situation like that? Where are this goat's rights? He's going to be so afraid, he may not recover form this. And what is the point in having a goat anyway? Is there a sacrifice planned, what's up?

not to be missed is right. how did this pass by unnoticed when everybody had
something to say about politics?

it's a sad day when George Bush is more interesting than a live goat.

well, you're projecting there, tho, aren't you? I mean maybe the goat is so
excited it can hardly wait.

baby, if you can't see the point in partying with a goat, I don't know if I
can help you.

Subject: [sfraves] For those in the war thread...

Interview with Camille Paglia.
http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2003/02/07/paglia/index.html

Already in the first question, she addresses reasons why P. Sutton is
wrong, and a tool:

	If there truly were an authentic international coalition that had
	been carefully built, and if the administration had demonstrated
	sensitivity to the fragility of international relations, I'd be
	100 percent in favor of an allied military expedition to go into
	Iraq and find and dispose of all weapons of mass destruction.

	But most members of the current administration seem to have little
	sense that there's an enormous, complex world beyond our borders.
	The president himself has never traveled much in his life. They
	seem to think the universe consists of America and then everyone
	else -- small-potatoes people who can be steamrolled. And I'm
	absolutely appalled at the lack of acknowledgment of the cost to
	ordinary Iraqi citizens of any incursion by us, especially aerial
	bombardment.

The AC 130 is old technology converted with "video game" technology to more 
modern uses.  The first gunship so equipped was a C-47 (civilian is DC 3) 
in Vietnam.

Problem with most of our generation is that we have no reality-based 
experience with war.  Our relationship to killing has become more abstract 
as person-to-person combat is replaced with joysticks, radar, and other 
weaponry controls.

I'm an amateur military historian, with particular interest in the Greeks 
and WW II.  Here is what one of the best historians of WW II, S.L.A. 
Marshall, discovered in his research about combat during that period.

No more than a quarter of the men in combat actually fired their 
weapons.  Discomfort with killing someone was one of the reasons.  But a 
bigger problem was fear.  In one study of a combat division Marshall found 
that a quarter of the troops admitted they had been so scared they 
vomited.  Nearly a quarter shit their pants.  Ten percent urinated in their 
BDUs.  Officers were so frightened that they experienced dry mouth and 
gagging and could not issue comprehensible orders under fire.

War is not a computer game.

Love,

Apollo

Can we fill it with blood and then sacrafice it? Of course the blood would
be fake and 100% kosher/vegan/politically correct. I heard the goat was
getting it's utters pierced. Just a rumor, but I'm looking forward to seeing
that! Can you ride a goat? (no Danny, not like that!)

War is not a computer game.

Love,

Apollo


By no means was I trivializing war like that either. It's just scary how
much what we now see of war looks like something I'd play on my computer. In
such a desensitized culture I wonder how those figures would change now.
Seems that the value of life isn't as strong as it used to be. I should
say - I wonder how willing someone would be to pull a trigger with a real
human being in front of them. Not from an infra-red night vision targeting
system... That's a game and removes the personal nature of killing a
person(s).

Actually, much of the modern weapons control technology resembles those on 
computer and video games.  My joy stick is the same as those used on F-16 
fighters.  When I get all pissed and aggressive I load the flight sim, 
power up my fighter, and wreck havoc in the virtual skies.  That's fine, 
'cause I can release all that testosterone in a relatively constructive way.

But I think, as you suggest, that we have been removed from the realities 
of death and destruction that accompany war.

Love,

Apollo

Subject: [sfraves] Ghett $et! tonight, free, 6-10 (bsp, nrr)

what up San Francisco RAVERS!

tonight at Ghett $et, you'll hear my usual mix of hip hop,
from new to classic, radio to underground, but lots of electronica
slipped in the mix... and by the way its free.

tonight I'm bustin out some CD's... in addition to a rock 
solid hip hop mix I'll light it up with some heavy IDM type ish- 
i.e. Warp records best of, select Detroit classics, even some 
(gasp!) trip hop (don't worry, just some sick Portishead b-sides) 
plus random funky nugs from Gil Scott Heron (In your face, whitey!), and the Smiths-sampling classic none other than Soho's "Hippy Chick". 

That's GHETT SET @ the SKYLARK @3089 16th St. near Valencia, 
starting around 6 and going all the ways up to around 10.

PEACE!!

instead of looking at it as "It's just scary how much what we now see of war
looks like something I'd play on my computer" try looking at it as "It's

i just wanted to add my two cents here, for clarification...most usually,  when i am writing my posts, i am replying to what i have been reading on the list or seeing out in the scene...i reply privately to those i have innitiated some sort of conversation or friendliness with, try to stand up for who and what i believe in,  and just because i poke around once, doesn't mean that there is a continuing presense of me later. this is just common sense.  anyone who tries to push anyone otherwise is really not well, and just trying to cause problems...just pretend like your walking down a busy street..... ..trust is a gift, not a right. i like all the varieties of music and discussion...i like to write too. i don' t think there is too much more that can be done via this medium...there will be no virtual me,  and i won't be getting involved with anyone i don't want to. muah to the kissable.  :) :)

This is true. But keep in mind that the people, (at least from my
point-of-view, the heavy hitting posts) are from real-to-the-core ravers
having a discussion about NRR topics. imho I'm glad to see it.

Point taken. I would review w/ Brian, Karina + all the other
stake holders, except this list collectively dictates what it decides to
be. It has always been like that.

I see this list as a point of congregation for
sf-ravers in the online community. If impending war is more important that
so-and-so's beats or wherz the party at?, than so be it. This list
sways from topics more than
"Days of our Lives", yet the content is so much more real and relevant. I
don't see any problem with the current influx of threads on war.

Actually, the list gets about 600 now, the digest+others brings it up
about 20%. People who join this list should know they're entering an onine
community, not a gaming strategies forum, if not they will quickly find
out. Certainly SFRaves requests general nettiquette, but our topics are
more loose. Do you think all our US soldiers in the mid-east are *only*
talking about war? Just put NRR if the topic is "Non Rave Related".

Ug. again. Dood, I read every single day's posts, for 8 years ago. I know
the list is heavy on NRR. I read all the flames. What would you like me to
moderate?

Have any of you read "Ender's Game," by Orson Scott Card? On the surface, a 
science fiction book, but it brings up a ton of philosophical and ethical 
issues. I wouldn't want to ruin the story for anyone, but it has a lot to do 
with the ways war can be fought as if it were a video game. 

The more removed we are from the actual killing, the easier it is to do.  
It's easier to shoot somebody with an arrow than to hit him with a club. But 
it's easier to shoot someone from a distance with a gun. Even easier to drop 
a bomb. And now we have unmanned planes, controlled remotely, that can launch 
anti-tank missiles at no physical risk to the person at the controls. Scary! 

Take care, everyone. We're at Orange Alert level as of today.

Interview with Camille Paglia.

Already in the first question, she addresses reasons why P. Sutton is
wrong, and a tool:

	If there truly were an authentic international coalition that had
	been carefully built, and if the administration had demonstrated
	sensitivity to the fragility of international relations, I'd be
	100 percent in favor of an allied military expedition to go into
	Iraq and find and dispose of all weapons of mass destruction.

	But most members of the current administration seem to have little
	sense that there's an enormous, complex world beyond our borders.
	The president himself has never traveled much in his life. They
	seem to think the universe consists of America and then everyone
	else -- small-potatoes people who can be steamrolled. And I'm
	absolutely appalled at the lack of acknowledgment of the cost to
	ordinary Iraqi citizens of any incursion by us, especially aerial
	bombardment.

Hey Osby...  (or, really, anyone else who can answer...)

Okay, I'm trying not to be combatative here.  But you know how I feel about
1015.  And you know why.  And it is all based on my experiences when I used to
go there, not any reputation I've heard of from anyone else.  So I won't go on
about that today.

But I *AM* kinda curious...

Just WHY should I, or anyone else, belive that 1015 has changed?  Has the
management changed?  Or has the security staff been terminated?  Or does Leslie
have enough pull with them to make the change their ways for one night?  What
exactly has changed that invalidates my previous experiences with the place.

Please don't take that question as an attack on you or the SFLNC, or even 1015
(that's an old horse I don't care to beat today).  I really AM curious.


cya,
john

Subject: Re: [sfraves] AC130 gunship :: your tax dolla, hard at work  
 <nrr>

As a veteran of the Persian Gulf War, I can tell you that the 
detachment of killing is real. I was a loader in a tank that swept 
across the border of Saudi Arabia and into Iraq. Our entire company 
(14 tanks) fired exactly two main gun rounds total. There was plenty 
of laying it down on the .50 cal into the bunkers as the hapless 
Iraqi soldiers jumped into them. I spent the whole time, about 19 
straight hours, sitting in that seat waiting for fire commands and 
watching into the darkness. The gunner scanned the horizon with the 
night vision equipped site waiting for targets to pop up and to get 
the command to fire. Though I was scared, it was very much like a 
video game in that the enemy was relegated to nothing more than being 
a simple target on a screen in a tightly controlled game of shoot em 
up.

Luckily our engagement was very light and our infantry company was 
there to bring across the exhausted POWs. We never even had to leave 
the tank. In fact we were ordered not to because nobody knew exactly 
where the anti-personnel land mines were, though they were all around.

why would that be scary?  Computers are more powerful than ever, and game 
designers hire military personnel to ensure accuracy in the game environment.

Subject: Re: Fwd: [sfraves] Fwd: vote to impeach bush [Pretty NRR]

The discussion Apollo made was quite broad, and I discussed it.  I'm not
going to go off on an Israel / Palestine debate as it's likely to get
ugly and feel it's better left to a specific discussion about the topic.
All views are narrow, it's a question of how much information you
took in before you got that view that matters...

Subject: [sfraves] Make Love NOT War!

Dear SFR Friends,

It's been a really long time and the road paved by countless amazing
parties has now brought us to the to this milestone celebration of Feel
Good Entertainment 11-yr Anniversareunion for yet another unique and
special LOVE AFFAIR.

This is the first time since the 2-day Love Affair Centennial
Celebration at the Maritime Hall (anyone recall that party?) that the
event will be returning to SF for a one night stand at the Cities
Premier Upscale Dance Lounge - WHISPER - on our traditional Valentines
Weekend (Next) Saturday - Feb. 15th  featuring DJ's: DOC MARTIN, DJ
GARTH, DJ DRC, MODA, Richard Summerhayes, Joey Mazzola, Kevin Kind, Ian
Lewis, Alain Octavo, and Naz.

This is one of the last traditional events of it's kind from the
oldschool - where you can truly expect to run into people that you met
at the very first party you went to regardless of how long you've been
partying.   And I'm sure that I'll be seeing many of you there for this
annual oldschool reunion.

Discounted advance tickets are only $20.

Positive Vibes - Vlad

I know this comes without invitation, but if you are concerned about 
the types of censorship and sponsorship that plague media and the govt 
(and everything else), here are four URL's that are worth looking at. i 
hope you find them worthwhile- particularly if you cherish the web, 
which once was an open, free and common forum that economic interests 
and other old school bullies are swiftly converting into an obnoxiously 
convenient and customizable marketplace just like the TV you have 
abandoned....



http://www.dfn.org/index.htm
http://www.cpsr.org/
http://slashdot.org/
http://www.eff.org/

i just spent the day in my car listening largely to NPR for lack of a 
better alternative and being told by this "objective" public source 
(sponsered by Arthur Daniels Midland and other heavy hitters, ahem) 
that America is solidly convinced of and fully supporting our just 
cause for war after Colin Powell's rather redundant speach at the UN 
the other day. The commentator cited a survey that indicated we 
Americans were pro-war through and through with all doubts relieved by 
a few taped messages in arabic and renderings of hypothetical labs on 
wheels. the world is listening to this garbage while d rumsfeld (a good 
chum of hussein's until the end of the Iran conflict) goes about 
insulting key members of the UN, EU and NATO and then questioning why 
they took offence. with a commander in chief that sets a precedent like 
gwb's infamous and fated "axis of evil" speech, precursor to the 
current nuclear escalation in North Korea etc, i am not surprised by 
the war secretary's ignorant rhetoric. he is. after all, paid good 
money to instigate war. looks like general dynamic and raytheon will 
continue to climb (along with oil futures) while the rest of try to pay 
the rent largely on pathetic non-living wages.

hope the rant was not unsavory.

please check out the links and ignore me if it was so.

peace.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] RE:  The Annual SFLNC Benefit coming soon! =)

LoL.... Thanks4 bringing that up John... I was waiting 2 hear from U on this
post...LoL...Hello 2Day!

1015 is totally know 4 the usual Friday/Saturday night clubs?  Those nights
bring in out the Random Clubber looking 2 boogie, out of town tourists
clubbers who heard bout the club & wanna C 4 themselves what it's ablout,
friends of the promoters of those nights, & so & so on la la la la!  Oh
yeah... 1015 does attract the "Asian" clubbers as well, whatever, just
thuogh I'd sdd that in...

But that crowd is that crowd John!  That crowd has nothing to do w/ the
crowd that comes to the our Benefit!  Well, I mean, there were many a times
I collected emails from people in line there & they get out emails about our
events & come out, ya know!  So people who regularly go there come out to
SFLNC events as well, whatever...

I mean... I jus' also wanna point out that the 1st year we had
"Ascension"...
we held it @ 550 & that was an Awesome vibe that night!  Last year when we
had "Ascension", we had it @ 1015 & it was very successful as well!  Good
People, Good Vibe, Good Music!!

Now Security is Security.... I'm not sure the last time U went there, but
I"m sure there have been serveral phases of chages in sercurity crew there
since U were last there!  I mean, they do their job John 'cause they have
to!!!  When I was there last Thursday 4 that Film party shindig, they were
CooL!!  They didn't bother any1 inside from what I saw & the people there
didn't cause any problem for them to be unplurie sercurity people!!

What I'm saying is John... U know won't know until U go check it out!!  From
what I experienced, the SFLNC draws in a Groovy crowd that security dos not
have a problem with, ya know!!!

Also... this is a Thursday night!!  I'm pretty sure this night won't draw in
the weekend crowd that the security acts more harsher towards!

Dude... I hope I see U there!!  I remember last year when a whole bunch of
SFR people came out!!  It was a fun time!

{8O) Peace =-=-> O§bY

whew ! *wipes sweat from forehead*


pay no attention osby...john barked and asked the same *exact* questions and tried to make the same
stick-in-the-mud arguments about this event last year.  even after it was answered it spades when
everyone chimed in that the Ascension benefit party rawked 1015 like it was the good old days, he
still didn't budge on his jaded ostrich stance.  although maybe it was because of that little run in
around that time he had at the busted UW party and how it probably reminded him of the meathead
security the promoters hire at the "tourist" 1015 parties, but who knows.

it's okay john... nobody is going to gag you and force you to go... but whatever you do thursday,
just don't watch reruns of COPS without loading up on plenty of high blood pressure medication.  we
don't want you to have a stroke or anything ;)

(sorry john, i couldn't resist :)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] off-topic list content - does the list moderator do any moderadation?!

I'd like to chime in on this topic. I've been an active participate on this
list for about 13 months now. I have found this list to be a community, a
family. While I enjoy the discussions about parties, promoters, djs, sound,
dancing, glowsticking, etc, I also enjoy the posts when people share their
personality and give their views about a variety of topics. I skip over the
topics I don't want to read and I'm glad there is no one doing the sorting
for me. I am usually very careful to mark my off topic posts with NRR, and I
know that a lot of people filter such posts to a separate folder or the
trash. If you read this list for a while, I think you will find that we
police ourselves, and if anyone goes too far off the deep end, we the
community will rise up and address it. I love the fact that whenever someone
complains about Geri Dahl's posts, people speak up both against her and in
support of her. If the overwhelming majority of people were against letting
her post, I'm sure the moderator would ban her from the list. Isn't this the
ultimate expression of what it means to live in a free and technologically
advanced society? How many people in the world get to participate in
something like this? While we know "the law" monitors this list, we have no
fear of them shutting it down or censoring it. There are countries where you
can be executed just for having an internet connection! So, I'm going to
suggest that you first take some time and read people's posts, and
appreciate what they contribute to this community. Yes we have our ugly
stepchildren, but while I cringe whenever I see their name on a post, I
fully support their right to be jerks. If this is too much for you to
handle, setup some filters. And if that still doesn't sanitize the list
enough for you, I wish you well in your search to find what you are looking
for.

Happy  :-)

but rather a person with a certain set of attitudes." -Hugh Downs

They don't want just a piece, they want it all.  Since they know they
can't own it (it cannot be owned), they are determined to destroy it.

They understand all right.  They just can't come out and say that what
they really want is a legally-enforced monopoly on ALL music.

i can't remember what i was reading or where, but i like to wear high heels sometimes, and if i wear them out dancing, like a lot of you do, things happen, like sore feet and if my back was already sore, an extra sore back....so how to weigh these things, especially considering the lovely apparel that is available....i mean, some of my shoes, i can barely walk in. if you wear your barely walk in shoes out to dance, then you can't really dance if you want to, or if you do dance, you will know it in ways that you might not want to know...which brings me to what i read...it said something like girls are always wearing high heels in sex scenes in porn flicks...maybe it was in playboy..i am not sure, but high heels in bed...hmmmm, maybe yes maybe no, and also, i have some lovely shoes that i'd like to wear everywhere, and nowhere, so that is where this is coming from....mmmmmhmmmm. ;)

Ok everyone, I'm really excited about this party.  I've been thinking
about doing it for months and it's finally coming together.  It is
perhaps the strangest theme for a drum and bass party ever, but it
should be a really good time.  And all the DJ's aren't just tall, they
are really good too. 

 

Here are links to the flyer.

Name : Jolly Green Jungle 

Date: Saturday March 1st 

Time: 10pm-4am 

Location: 10 minutes from the bay bridge 

Info line (415) 364-3095 

Price: $7 

-One night only, the tallest DJ's ever to convene under one roof 
-Over 32 Feet of DJ'ing experience behind the decks 
-A true underground party 

DJs: 
Controlled Substance (Illformants/Subtitles/Thermal/Breakbeatscience,
6'3.5") A Bay Area Drum&Bass innovator with mad skills behind the decks
as well as the mixing board-CS's laptop will be boomin with a trunk of
funk, playin a little somethin you've never heard before... 

Freya (Hemisphere, 6'3", with heels-???) Smother, warmer, and more
soulful than ever, founder of the chillinest DnB night SF has ever seen,
Freya creates emotionally impacting mixes that shake your rump and move
your soul... 

Genome (Groundscore, 6'5") Resident at SF's legendary Eklektic,
Groundscore Admin to some of you, Bad Motherfucker to the rest...The
last party we had at this location, Genome's blistering mix killed it,
rinsed it, mashed it up, and twisted it out...beware... 

Fife (InnerspaceResearchGroup, 6'6") If you bought a drum&bass record
from Ameoba in S.F., this man probably turned you on to it. Fife's
record box is always pushing the envelope, stuffed with mind-blowing
atmospheric dancefloor tunes... 

Highside (Hemisphere, 6'7") Highside's mix cds have been making the
rounds among East Bay heads, Hemisphere resident and the evening's
tallest spinna-he always starts slow, but finishes fast, strap yourself
in for a ride...inside...the one like Highside...

 

Call on the day of the event for directions.  Hope to see you all there.

 

-Fife

For those of us tired of a US news media unable or unwilling to look closely
at topics less "entertaining" than Michael Jackson's face, BBC World News is
available here:

http://www.idcn.net/mv/tvbbc.asx

Just paste the URL into Windows Media Player (File/Open URL). It's a 300K
feed so this is probably only for people with broadband, but what a
difference from the spin on CNN.

For instance, funny we don't hear much about this here:

> yesterday when it emerged that chunks of British "intelligence" that he
> invoked were copied verbatim from an old article by a young academic.
> http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-569257,00.html

In other words, a California student's thesis written around the time of the
last Gulf war...

yeah, i was listening to npr yesterday when they interviewed the prof from britain who caught the
slip.

their response concerning the plagurized part 2 of the 3 part report claiming that weapons
inspections in Iraq are inneffective was from "intelligence" 12 years old ? : "we are still
confident that the report is accurate"

And for those who don't like their BBC World with Japanese overdub, you can
tune into it on the boob tube weekday evenings at 6:00 on the San Jose PBS
station KTEH, channel 54.  Or if you're not mortified by using Real, you can
get the 24-hr audio feed at

http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/ram/live_news.ram

Subject: [sfraves] Witches and Paganism

Hey to all,

I just saw a reference made to 'wicca'. As an credentialed Priest of 
the Old Religion (yep, we have numerous 'formal' organizations),
I find much of the creativity of the Craft in contemporary rave/edm 
scene: the dress, physical environment, PLUR values, etc., all have 
strong correspondents in witchcraft.

I see this as all good, all fabulous!

"While Mrs. Bush understands the right of all Americans to express their 
political views, this event was designed to celebrate poetry."

Statement from the First Lady's press office, on the postponement of Laura 
Bush's "Poetry and the American Voice" after the White House learned that 
several poets wanted to deliver poems with their American Voices to speak 
out against the war with Iraq.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Witches and Paganism

    Yes probably true, but then again doesn't the rave scene have strong 
correspondents to just about every religion, old and new? it's kind of a 
metaphoric spiritual typhoon of just about every spiritual or non spiritual 
influence east to west and north to south. It seems to me, that the rave 
scene itself, seems to mock religion and orthodoxy but at the same time it 
somehow manages to keep everyone happy and decent to one another... even 
though there is no rules, it's a chaotic environment, but it's the total 
oppisite of what the government thinks a chaotic environment is.... maybe i'm 
going off on a tangent now... but i think ravers often forget the 
significance of the scene and it's potential. - johnny bzzzz

 I see this as all good, all fabulous!

February 7, 2003

Oppose Culture War Against Raves!

In the 1960s, hippie culture was seen as threatening, irresponsible and 
primarily about drug use. Even though most of those young people came 
together because of a mutual interest in peace, adults of that era labeled 
them as criminals and troublemakers.

A new kind of social event that mixes an electronic music concert, light 
show and dancing--popularly known as raves--has been similarly stigmatized. 
The media often portray raves as dangerous, sinister drug fests and the 
people who attend them as criminals who only use the events to sell drugs 
to youth. Raves, however, are a legitimate cultural event just like rock 
concerts, art exhibitions and film screenings, and are an important outlet 
for youth culture today.

In a misguided spin-off of the "War on Drugs," the Senate is considering 
legislation that targets raves and would have the effect of classifying 
common rave items like glow sticks and massage oils as drug paraphernalia. 
The Reducing Americans Vulnerability to Ecstasy (RAVE) Act, introduced by 
Senator Joseph Biden (D-DE) in the 107th Congress, is back but is being 
referred to now as the "Crack-house Statute amendments".  S. 226 would also 
impose huge fines and even prison time on the owners of venues into which 
customers bring controlled substances. No matter how much security is put 
in place, they could be held responsible for the actions of just one customer.

Holding club owners and promoters of raves criminally liable for what some 
people may do at these events is no different from arresting the stadium 
owners and promoters of a Rolling Stones concert or a rap show because some 
concertgoers may be smoking or selling marijuana. Unless a loud and 
powerful objection to this legislation is voiced, an already misunderstood 
community and culture could be criminalized.

Urge your Senators to oppose attacks on youth culture!

S. 226 threatens free speech.

If S. 226 becomes law, property owners may be too afraid to rent or lease 
their space for events rightly or wrongly perceived as attracting drug 
users -- essentially any event that attracts a young crowd. Out of fear of 
massive fines and prison sentences, law-abiding business owners may stop 
hosting raves and other musical events, driving them further underground 
and away from public health and safety regulations.

  S. 226 is too broad and puts business owners at risk.

While supporters of the bill claim that innocent business owners do not 
need to worry because it only applies to people who knowingly own property 
for the purpose of manufacturing, distributing, or using a controlled 
substance, the terms are too undefined to provide adequate protection to 
innocent business owners. Despite good security, restaurant, bar, 
nightclub, dance and music venue owners could all be fined hundreds of 
thousands of dollars and forced into bankruptcy if a customer sneaks in drugs.

  The bill will endanger the lives and safety of youth.

Under this law, business owners who host raves would be reluctant to enact 
important measures to protect their customers. By insinuating that selling 
bottled water and offering "cool off" rooms is proof that owners and 
promoters know drug use is occurring at their events--as the Senate bill 
from last year suggests--the bill could make business owners too afraid to 
implement such harm-reduction measures and the safety of young people will 
suffer.

TAKE ACTION!

Much love,

Given that both the Democrats and Republicans are pro-Drug War, who do 
rave-culture friendly folks here vote for? I know Libertarians want to 
decriminalize all victimless crimes (drugs, prostitution, etc), is the 
same true of Greens or any other 3rd parties?

    I propose that ravers create their own political party, the party of "
Ridofit" 
    Why do you ask? well, because we got rid of it.... 
        what do we want? PLUR!  when do we want it?? Now!




This is kinda like my outline statement that i have been playing with lately, 
as if i were the speaker of ridofit, what i would present as my goal for the 
nation. I must point out that it is written in a very amature fashion and it 
might sound way too idealistic or egotistical on my part for having written 
it...? but i am interested if anyone agrees with this type of vision for the 
US?? I think it's very john lennon-ish.

  "Ridofit"
A legitimate, gradual, political effort to reduce government power over the 
people to 0%. 

U.S. military will be reduced and neutralized, global security will be 
largely in the hands of the United Nations which will be globally responsible 
for battling terrorism. 

Nuclear weapons will be publically disarmed, along with the Nuclear weapons 
of all of the other threatening nations. Who should by all means understand 
the meaning of this peacful gesture and do the same.

There is no Police force per se, no security guards, no guns, no handcuffs, 
no jails. The community is now in itself, it's own justice and peace keeper. 
People are incouraged to find the "black sheep" and help them in their 
transformation into a more peaceful wholesome being, rather than ignore and 
avoid these "types" while they linger in resentment of the community until 
lashing out in violent and destructive crime. People are incouraged not to 
rely on the law to defend their rights but rather to rely on themselves and 
their community. People are incouraged to communicate with eachother and 
built trust, and security within their friends, their family, their school, 
work and every person they encounter. People who do not follow in the 
peaceful productive ways of the community will be frowned upon and confronted 
constantly by wiser elders and more responsible peers. Massive arenas of 
entertainment, arts, sports, technology, science and spirtuality and good 
food and health services will assist in happier more peaceful communities. 

Legalization of drugs, alcahol and all forms of sex will result in a high 
quality of life and spiritual contentment. 

Spirituality is of huge concern and is the main focus of education, after a 
child finds him/herself and choses a direction in life he/she will recieve a 
lifetime of free education in the subject of his/her choice.

Money spent on millitary, weapons, national security, police forces, and 
security devices will be recycled in to the communities for better and free 
education, free food for the hungry, clothing for the cold, and shelter for 
the homeless and will be invested in spirtual, environmental, and scientific 
studies and preservation. 

If United States is attacked for any reason we will remain neutral and rely 
on the protection of and our participation in the United Nations for 
retaliation. Our nation itself will not participate, initiate, or provacate 
war or violence. We will suffer through any unjustified, attack on our 
country, much in the example of all of the worlds spiritual leaders have 
always tried to teach us. Having faith in people, trust in the community, and 
an overwhelming developement in music, arts, entertainment, and spirtiuality 
will transform us from the most feared nation in the world to the most 
respected and peacefully revolutionary one. Therefor reducing terrorism not 
by force but by honerable example.
(i do realize that as of now most people living in the united states are not 
"passivists" and therefor probably will not agree with a word of what i just 
said but it's fun to play with these ideas is it not?)

Official Soulseek Press Release
February 8, 2003
Thomas Mennecke
OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT - Re: Soulseek Status


This is to provide the official status of the Soulseek network as Friday,
February 7th and onward. I have spoken to Nir and Rosalind Arbel on the
matter over the course of this week and prior to this event taking place,
and this notice is being offered on their behalf.

The artist calling herself Sapphirecut previously made a complaint towards
Soulseek regarding the sharing of her material on the network. When she had
contacted Soulseek regarding the matter, she failed to state which material
was in question. There was no information provided, aside from her being
"Sapphirecut". Therefore, acting on such, a global message was made to users
not to share the artist's material, and a notice was made upon entering chat
rooms of the same.

Unfortunately, this was not satisfactory, and the artist went on to file a
complaint against Verio - Soulseek's server host, stating DMCA Copyright
Infringement. Verio, in return did not conduct a formal inquiry into the
situation. Rather, they acted rather quickly, requiring the server, and site
to be pulled. Thus, there was no warning that such was going to take place.
This not only applied to the users of Soulseek, but to Nir himself. On
sudden notice, he was required to seek out a new host for the server.

To calm the air of panic, this does NOT mean that Soulseek is down forever.
The RIAA did NOT have an injunction against Nir, as rumors have stated.
Soulseek WILL be returning shortly, and this unfortunate delay was not
expected. A new potential host has been found, however they are working
through the paperwork for such, and have not completed such as quickly as we
would have expected. At this level, it is out of Nir's hands as they have to
simply go through the process of completing it. That said, we apologize
again for the delay and hope that it does not last a great deal longer.

It is important to note that Soulseek can not and will not condone any
actions towards the artist that may cause her or her affiliated labels harm.
Such actions would include defaming emails, defacing, or otherwise damaging
her website or the site of her affiliates, and other further actions which
may be damaging. Such actions will simply result in further problems for the
network, as the artist will direct complaints towards Soulseek itself. Those
wishing to show their support for Soulseek will best do so by simply NOT
sharing any files by this artist. The files in question include:

1.Free Your Mind, Megan's epic mix.


2.Free Your Mind, Sapphirecut's Original mix


3.Action-Reaction by Sapphirecut (in any form)


4.Any music that has Sapphirecut on it except the Illustrious track "I'd Say
Yes", which is a remix.

We thank you for your patience and support through this situation, and we
look forward to seeing all users back on Soulseek shortly. Users who wish
further information regarding the DMCA are directed to browse to
www.chillingeffects.org. All information needed regarding the act can be
read or studied there. Cheers.

On behalf of Nir and Rosalind Arbel,
Sean Nelson / Proteus93

":: Our musical family grows through the connections that we meet day by
day. We need your support. Twisted is an Independent dance lable that can
only survive through the sales that it receives. We are NOT talking about
big business, we speak of the future of independent music. We can not be
distributed throughout the world unless the Independents survive and they
are dying out as a result of MP3 pirating and CD copying.

:: Please let us continue to survive and draw creative input from this world
connection by purchasing our music."

-- The Sapphirecut Website

Feel free to share your thoughts with this act: megan@sapphirecut.com

The way I see this it is a great way to get your name out quick by getting
some free PR. Shutdown a major P2P server, get your name all over the net,
people suddenly know who you are. The statement above from the artist's
website is a farse. MP3 has changed the music industry forever. The freely
swappable files enable an unknown to become a known. In the case of a dj act
like this the primary sales are going to come from vinyl. If a dj can hear
the full track and enjoy it they will be more likely to buy it.

I still think this is a clever way to get your name out and a shitload of
attention. I wouldn't have heard this person had it not been for this little
kid move against SoulSeek.

Great party!!  Was happy to see y'all there....
As I was a wee bit drunk (ok, trashed is more like
it), I'll just apologise now in case I got too
terribly annoying or obnoxious :) 
Thanks to all my friends for laughing at my antics
instead of smacking me upside the head.


Hung over but smiling,

You seem to have positive goals, but I'm confused about the logic here.
You say 0% government is the goal but you seem to be proposing:
- continuing to have the government teach US history
- expanding the welfare state (who pays for this and how is it possible 
to collect taxes without coercion?)
- the merging church and state

Cheers,
Steve

All great forests must start with a single seed... I think there are some 
serious flaws in your proposal, but I think with careful revision and 
topical guidance, you could transform what you have into something that we 
could have... Just a thought. -Trendy

Subject: [sfraves] Power Puff Girls 2 info

Hey guys (and Scepter), 
I was wondering if anyone has any more info on this party. The lineup 
looks tight but I'm concerned (will be stayin in sf) of how far away this 
party will be for me. The info line area code is 916, so I'm wondering if 
anyone has any general location info. www.shaolinproductions.net is the 
flyer and info. Thanks a lot.

Chris

    So why do they call them political "parties" anyway? Who are these 
people? I mean aren't these guys like 50? yea i can just picture it now... 
Bill Clinton's got a lil candy raver sitting on his lap in the chill room, Al 
Gore's in the ticket booth recounting the stubbs... again! and we got DJ 
George W. VS DJ Soo Damn Insane, throwing down on four turntables... I'd vote

EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROTESTS AND WALKOUTS

As the Bush Administration threatens to wage a unilateral 
war of aggression we must do all we can to make this 
movement the single biggest obstacle to war. We do not 
believe that war in inevitable. However, if the war starts 
we must be organized to resist and disable the war 
machine.

The DAY a new U.S. war on Iraq starts -- EMERGENCY PROTEST 
at a central location -- in Washington, D.C. at the White 
House, in New York at Times Square, in San Francisco at 
Powell and Market -- to protest the war followed by a 
march through city neighborhoods beginning at 5 p.m. (the 
next day at 5 p.m. of the bombing begins at night). Many 
cities and communities have a tradition of holding these 
emergency actions in response to U.S. military aggression. 
If your community does not have a traditional plan, pick a 
busy location/intersection, a Federal Building, Town Hall, 
etc.

THE MORNING AFTER THE WAR STARTS -- WALK OUT/STAYAWAY! 
ORGANIZE WALK OUTS from school, work, leave your home. 
Spend the morning leafleting for people to join the 
anti-war movement. A.N.S.W.E.R. offices and organizing 
centers around the country will be open in the morning to 
pick up leaflets and from there you can head out with 
others into your community. Converge mid-day at noon at 
city centers -- in Washington, D.C. at the White House, in 
New York City at Union Square, in San Francisco at Civic 
Center Plaza -- to engage in protest actions against the 
war. Download flyers at www.internationalanswer.org and 
locate organizing centers in your area.

THE FIRST SATURDAY AFTER -- CONVERGE AT THE WHITE HOUSE -- 
The Saturday after a new war on Iraq is launched, 
thousands of people will be converging at the White House 
in Washington DC at 12 noon.

FEBRUARY 15 & 16 MASS ACTIONS
Part of the February 13-21 Week of Resistance

On February 15, there will be demonstrations in thousands 
of cities across the country and around the world in 
response to the call issued from the European anti-war 
movement. The A.N.S.W.E.R. Coalition joins with the 
hundreds of organizations who will be mobilizing for the 
NYC, Chicago, Los Angeles and other regional and local 
actions on that day. On February 16, there will be a mass 
action in San Francisco co-sponsored by the A.N.S.W.E.R. 
Coalition, Bay Area United Against War, Not in Our Name 
Project, and United for Peace and Justice.

In New York City, join A.N.S.W.E.R. on Friday, February 14 
for a teach-in from 9 am to 4 pm on Building an anti-war 
movement that connects the struggle against war on Iraq 
with the fight for social and economic justice and civil 
rights at home, followed by an Indoor Rally from 7 to 10 
pm on Linking the struggle against corporate 
globalization, war, militarism and racism. Both events 
will take place at Community Church, 35th St. between Park

My guess would be, judging that the flyer says 1500+ capacity, that the rave 
will be at the estrella ballroom in Galt. No guarentees...but last time i 
went to a sac party with 1500+ capacity, it was in galt. they have a lot of 
parties there. i went to Enter the Dragon 3 there and it was amazing...it 
will be worht the drive.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Tons of NEW Hardcore/Happy Hardcore at Solid Grooves! <bsp>

I personally from a DJ standpoint think that grouping resitance recordsin 
the HHC bin is apporiate.. Now keep in mind I don't listen to HHC or any of 
that and I don't know andy personally so it ain't like I got "his back" on 
this issue.. But I personal play prog house and have many tracks on lots of 
labels that are not Traditionally "Prog House" labels and they fit just fine 
in the prog section and vice versa goes for some prog labels that can be 
worked into a Traditonal house set. So it is like splitting hairs.. Cause if 
you ask me what Tronic plays is Hard core, Happy hardcore or whatever.. It 
is fast and annoying to *ME*

Now I know that just pissed alot of you off... But that is a fact to most 
people that listen to slower types of music. Just like people may not like 
"Prog house" or don't consider it house it is trance etc.. to each there own 
opinion :)

Please drive forward!

Macadio

Subject: Re: [sfraves] valentine's day advice

Go out and have fun. Don't make the night into anything more than it is.
Remember that it's a Friday night like any other time of the year, but since
there is some corporate fueled holiday you have parties occuring. Masquerade
Di Valentino is going to be awesome. It's on Valentine's day in Oakland
somewhere. 5 rooms, tons of people, and the perfect way to go out and just
have fun. Sitting around and thinking about why the holiday is stupid and
corporate fueled is a waste of time. =)

go do something really fun that you wouldn't have been able to do 
with your ex because it's not her thing/she would've been 
bored/hated it.. you get the idea.  that and liquor.  for broken 
hearts i recommend vodka over whiskey.

Exactly. It's symantics and splitting hairs. What's too progressive and more
on the trance side of things might be too housey to someone else. It's all
perspective. Something to also consider is when playing a HHC/hard house set
do you and other dj's in the genre stick solely to just that spectrum?
Consider that in a jungle/dnb set you might here something that's a rather
2-stepish track or rather on the breakbeat side of things. Still works,
still uses similar patches in the sequence, but if you're picky about genres
you could easily say those aren't jungle/dnb! Those tracks are the ambiguous
tracks. One of the prime examples that comes to mind is the AK1200 remix of
Cleveland Lounge's Drowning. That's dnb/breaks/progressive trance all
wrapped into one. Given the speed of the track it falls more under dnb, but
the sounds and structure of the track definately sound like other genres.

Anyway - I'm sure you have better things to get irritated about, like
traffic on 880 and all the shithead drivers out there. ;-)

I personally from a DJ standpoint think that grouping resitance recordsin
the HHC bin is apporiate.. Now keep in mind I don't listen to HHC or any of
that and I don't know andy personally so it ain't like I got "his back" on
this issue.. But I personal play prog house and have many tracks on lots of
labels that are not Traditionally "Prog House" labels and they fit just fine
in the prog section and vice versa goes for some prog labels that can be
worked into a Traditonal house set. So it is like splitting hairs.. Cause if
you ask me what Tronic plays is Hard core, Happy hardcore or whatever.. It
is fast and annoying to *ME*

Now I know that just pissed alot of you off... But that is a fact to most
people that listen to slower types of music. Just like people may not like
"Prog house" or don't consider it house it is trance etc.. to each there own
opinion :)

Please drive forward!

Subject: [sfraves] found this:

this seemed like such a good idea... it had to be passed along

*****************************************************************

Friends and Fellow Americans:

As the drums of war begin to sound it is the duty of those who 
want peace to remind the President that not all in this great land 
of ours are happy with the blind march towards slaughter. While 
street demonstrations are a good way of raising the people's 
awareness of political unrest, it appears that the recent rallies 
have fallen on deaf ears.

It is time to take a new tack. We need to make an emotional 
connection between the concept of peace and something dear to our 
President's heart.

We propose the humble Pretzel.

Our President's zeal for this simple snack food is well known the 
world over. So we propose a mass mailing of pretzels to the White 
House. Enclosed is a recipie for pretzels, if you wish to make a 
Peace Sign shaped pretzel of your own to send. Otherwise a store 
bought pretzel accompanied by a simple note card with a peace sign 
will do.

Act now. We want a million pretzels to reach the White House by 
March 1st. Send this missive off to friends and relatives. Hold 
pretzels for peace baking parties. Change the way our President 
looks at the idea of Peace, send a pretzel today!

pretzels:
2 1/4 t. yeast (or one packet, red star is good yeast)
1 1/2 c very warm water (about 102 degrees F.)
4 c. flour 
1 T. sugar
1 t. salt
Add yeast to warm water and stir. Add flour, sugar, and salt. Mix 
and knead dough. Roll into a sheet and then cut in strips to make 
worms. Shape in pretzel bows, or peace signs, or roll to make 
sticks, or some such thing. Place on cookie sheet (non-stick 
spray, wax-paper, or greasing it lightly is a good idea). Bake at 
425 degrees F. for 12 to 15 minutes, or until light brown.
Just before baking, you can sprink on top any favorite herbs or 
spices, or coarse salt, or maybe even finely chopped bits of 
broccoli. You know, get creative.

Address:

The White House
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW
Washington, DC 20500 

Return Address:

Remember your vote is annonymus, so why not make your pretzel 
annoynmus as well? The postmark is the important part, but mail to 
the WhiteHouse really needs a return address, feel free to use 
ours:

John M. and Linda Poindexter
10 Barrington Fare, Rockville, MD, 20850

-The Pretzels for Peace Coalition

Because Tim, my large mouthed friend, most people associate what I spin to 
be Hardcore, and Solid Grooves chose to place it in the Hardcore section. 
Since we are now being distributed as a HARDCORE label now by a couple of 
distributors, we feel it's ok by us. Hope that clears up any questions you 
might have. :)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] valentine's day advice

I'll have to agree with the vodka over whiskey.  Whiskey is definitely a 
depressing liquor.  If you don't get violent I'd choose tequila over vodka.  
Both are party liquors but damn does tequila kick a night into rockstar 
gear.  Beer will just make you tired and dwell on whats going on in your 
life at that moment.  And I'd also recommend a place with friends who are 
also single or ones who are going out to party with their SO's instead of 
spending it alone and quiet.

I'm a pro at the whole getting dumped/ending it before V-Day.  I've only not 
been single on one of them since I've been dating.

go do something really fun that you wouldn't have been able to do
with your ex because it's not her thing/she would've been
bored/hated it.. you get the idea.  that and liquor.  for broken
hearts i recommend vodka over whiskey.

i think that you should go out if you have energy, but not stress that you have to be in a romantic mood on the 14th...you can celebrate love anytime you like too...it is kind of like new years....a lot of people celebrate new years on jan 1st...then chinese new year was a couple of weeks ago...happy new year, by the way, and also, if you prefer to celebrate new years day in the spring, you can with all of the lovely people from taiwan, i believe...for love and ultra sexy paganism,  i highly recommend celebrating beltaine with the rest of the hotties in spring. :)

Subject: [sfraves] Rumblings of Coachella 2003...

Anyone already planning on going? They just announced that it will be
happening on April 26 & 27th this year.  Rumored headliners include Jane's
Addiction and Radiohead...

Naturally, all y'all will probably be interested in the rumored lineup for
the Dance Tent (which absolutely rocked last year), and this is what Virgin
Mega has to say:

"The dance tent possibilities look fantastic with talk of Underworld, Deep
Dish, Groove Armada and Timo Maas - if they add Satoshi Tomiie, Danny
Howells, John Creamer and Stephane K, it would be unflappable"

Yeah, $75+ tix and travelling to what is arguably the ass end of California
are unappealing, but the vibe in the tent last year was BEYOND amazing. I've
already booked a (highly inflated) hotel room. See you there!

The Green Party platform includes:

Criminal and Civil Justice Reforms

Abolish the Death Penalty

Prosecute Police Brutality-The Jonny Gammage Law: Require independent 
federal investigation and prosecution of law enforcement officers charged 
with violating the civil rights or causing the bodily injury or death of a 
human being.

End Political and Racial Persecution by the Criminal Justice System: 
Freedom for all political prisoners and prisoners of racial injustice.

Restorative Justice: Establish a humane criminal sanction system based on 
prevention, restitution, rehabilitation, and reconciliation rather than 
vengeance, forced labor, and profits for the Prison-Industrial Complex. 
Restore full funding for college degree granting programs in state and 
federal prisons. Jobs and justice, not more police and prisons.

Legal Aid: Expand funding of legal aid and public defender programs so all 
people can have competent legal representation.

Fight Corporate Crime: Strengthen laws and enforcement against corporate 
crime with penalties that include incarceration of executives and 
revocation of corporate charters.

Oppose Tort Reform that Limits Class Action Lawsuits and Caps Victims' 
Compensation: The threat of high victim compensation awards by civil juries 
must be maintained as an important deterrent to corporate crime.

Civil Liberties: Support the Bill of Rights. No compromise on civil 
liberties and due process for "national security," "anti-terrorism," or 
"the war on drugs." Repeal the 1994 Crime and 1996 Anti-Terrorism bills. 
End domestic political spying by police, military, and intelligence agencies.

End the "War on Drugs:" Decriminalize possession of drugs. Regulate and tax 
drug distribution. Release nonviolent drug war prisoners. Treat drug abuse 
as a health problem, not a criminal problem. Drug abuse treatment on demand.

It's always a good thing to outline, at least to yourself, what kind of 
world you would like to see.  This is a good beginning, J, although many 
would disagree with some of the proposals.

A life without beliefs is not worth living.  Beliefs without action are 
meaningless.  I've always believed that "raving," that is positive 
transformation through communal music and dance, is the first step in 
liberating the mind and soul from much of the garbage of modern 
life.  There should, however, be step 2....

Love,

Apollo

Subject: [sfraves] a vday message about plur (NNRR - not necessarily rave-related)

with political terror looming, i keep looking around
and wondering if i'm really a firm believer in fate or
if maybe i'm just so jaded and cynical these days that
it makes me downright apathetic.  probably a little of
both.

i was told years ago to choose my battles or lose my
wars, and the advice really struck home.  so i find
that more in my direct view and perhaps, as a result,
more in my immediate concern, there are little wars
going on all around me, wars that more frequently
demand my focus and attention - wars at home, wars at
work, wars in the hearts and minds of people i love.  

it strikes me sometimes that perhaps we are a warring
nation simply because so many of us are at war with
ourselves.  

it seems like we're incapable of finding and keeping
peace, anyway, unless we constantly have fresh
reminders of the ramifications of war, since we're
such shortsighted forgetful things as a species. 
maybe if the american citizens who got royally fucked
over by the political conflicts of the last few
decades weren't all traumatized homeless
schizophrenics as a result (and thereby had some
credibility when they shouted their doomsday
prophecies from city sidewalks), we'd be a little less
eager as a world power to engage other countries in
power struggles and ego games. 

something i'm a little less apathetic about is
valentine's day, maybe because i have someone to spend
it with this year.  i will sheepishly admit, it's nice
to have a little something other than the usual
narcotics to distract me from the mass cultural
anxiety and hysteria that surrounds me because of this
whole war situation.  i wouldn't go so far as to say
that love is all we need, but damn, it sure helps.  

in closing, here's some random food for thought:
others can see how much self-respect you have by how
much respect you show for others than yourself.  there
can be no unity without diversity.

count your blessings this valentine's day.   

sooz

Subject: [sfraves] RE: Rumblings of Coachella 2003...

> I've already booked a (highly inflated) hotel room. See you there!

Just a quick suggestion for a fun Coachella trip...

(I'll not likely have the money to go this year, but I had a blast when I did.)

When I went, a bunch of us from work all chipped in on renting a big-ass RV for
the weekend.  It was $600 to rent it from friday clear through till monday, and
we paid $12 a night for a full-hookup campsite st the Salton Sea.  (And yeah,
there was RV parking at Coachella itself.)

Divided up among the six of us, it was about the same cost as those
aforementioned inflated hotel rooms (prolly slightly more actually, when you
figure in the cost of gas), and we had a MUCH better time driveing down and up
than we would have if we had crammed ourselves (and our stuff) into our cars.

And lemme tell ya... not much livens up an otherwise tediously long trip to the
ass-end of nowhere more than being able to get up and walk back into the
kitchen and make yourself a vodka and Red Bull!


cya,
john

Do your part to help push US Breaks. - 2/8/2003I have forwarded this from a
fellow breaks DJ.  Help US artists make more US music!.!.!

Please send an email to Alex Leon (aleon@urb.com) and let URB magazine know
that US breaks deserve some page time!!!

Do your part to help push US Breaks. - 2/8/2003
US Breaks.
There is still time to send your letter!
Thank you to everyone who has sent your letter to URB. For those of you who
did not write there is still time for you tell URB your thoughts and
opinion. For those of you who did write, please tell your friends and anyone
else you think agrees with us.

URB Magazine vs. US Breaks
To 1000 Members Strong,

It's amazing that within the past 5 months Kaleidoscope Music has now added
more than 1000 members to our site. In our forum section we have tried to
clear up many issues plaguing the US Breaks scene and all of the
contributions have been very crucial in what we have been trying to present
to URB magazine. For the past 6 months I, Huda Hudia, have been fighting a
battle with URB magazine and have pointed out numerous times about their
lack of coverage for US Breaks. If you look at their review section on
breaks you will hardly ever see any reviews for US Breaks artists. Also,
their lack of support for US Breaks is quite apparent in their lack of
coverage. Now, I must tell you I have not been wagging this battle in the
name of Kaleidoscope Music alone and would like to tell you what I have
proposed to URB Magazine.

Basically, my proposal has been to write about the top 5 selling and
contributing breaks labels here in the US for over 5 years. This will show
to the public the commitment of our labels here in the US and to show that
breaks is not some new thing developed by UK artists. I feel that people
should know there are labels out there that have worked hard for a very long
time to bring this breaks scene to where it is now, where it will be in the
future, and the survival of something special.

I would hope that "you" the people would spend at least half an hour of your
time to e-mail Alex Leon, Account Manager, of URB and give him your
thoughts. I will be speaking to him on Monday, February 10th, along with the
editor of URB Magazine, and your contributions will help drastically. His
e-mail address is aleon@urb.com. Please write "LACK OF US BREAKBEAT IN URB
MAGAZINE" as your subject.

The leaders in this scene have only been concerned about themselves and I
hope we can make a difference and change that perception. Together, I feel
we can make a difference. We are 1000 strong and if everyone participates we
can make a huge difference. I would ask that you keep in mind that
constructive criticism works. Your letter should not be to boycott URB in
any way, but to show that there is more than one person out there that
believes in US breaks and is willing to fight for the coverage it deserves.

Thank you,
Huda

I have a feeling they will be using additional sound as well as the Rages
existing sound.  Lately for the MEGA Djs Brian has booked he has used a
stage (instead of the Dj booth) in the back dance area and additional sound
and lighting especially if thier gonna have an MC.  I bet he will use
Lightbrights shizzy.  So regardless the sound should be gravy!

Peace....c-yah there!

IF WE COULD JUST LIVE OUR LIVES WITH THESE FOUR THOUGHTS

BE IMPECCABLE WITH YOUR WORD
Speak with integrity. Say only what you mean. Avoid using the word to speak against yourself or to gossip about others. Use the power of your word in the direction of truth and love.

DON'T TAKE ANYTHING PERSONALLY
Nothing others do is because of you. What others say and do is a projection of their own reality, their own dream. When you are immune to the opinions and actions of others, you won't be the victim of needless suffering.

DON'T MAKE ASSUMPTIONS
Find the courage to ask questions and to express what you really want. Communicate with others as clearly as you can to avoid misunderstandings, sadness, and drama. With just this one agreement, you can completely transform your life.

ALWAYS DO YOUR BEST
Your best is going to change from moment to moment; it will be different when you are healthy as opposed to sick. Under any circumstance, simply do your best, and you will avoid self-judgment, self-abuse, and regret.

Hunt revives for anti-HIV gel after tests on monkeys

February 10 2003

http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/02/10/1044725733857.html

The quest for a gel that can kill the AIDS virus, offering protection to 
women and homosexuals exposed to HIV-infected sperm, has suddenly revived 
after tests showed it worked with monkeys.

The idea of a barrier cream that can destroy the human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV) has gripped experts for the last two decades, offering the hope 
of simple, cheap protection for vaginal and anal sex in the absence of an 
AIDS vaccine.

But relatively little money has been invested in this line of research - 
and the only candidate gel, an over-the-counter spermicide called 
nonoxynol-9, proved horrifyingly to be worse than useful.

When this gel was tested on a large group of prostitutes in Africa and 
Thailand, it was found in fact to boost the risk of catching HIV, possibly 
by damaging the delicate mucus membranes and thus exposing them more to 
contact with the virus.

That has led many to draw the grim conclusion that the search for a 
microbicide may lead only to a dead end.

But research published today by a US-British team of microbiologists has 
reignited hopes.

Their experimental treatment incorporates a human antibody, b12, which is 
known to attack the virus by identifying a protein, gp120, located on the 
virus surface.

Twelve macaque monkeys received b12 in the form of a cream or in a saline 
solution, and were then exposed, up to two hours later, with the monkey 
equivalent of HIV.

Only three of the 12 became infected.

Among a control group of 13 monkeys who were not given the b12, 12 became 
infected.

There is a long way to go and many uncertainties to be resolved before this 
early success results in a product for humans, but at least it demonstrates 
that a microbicide works, the authors say.

"Viral inhibitors can help prevent the sexual transmission of HIV-1 to 
humans," they say.

Among the hurdles ahead are broadening the attack base of b12 so that it 
can neutralise the many genetic sub-types of HIV, they say.

The study is published online by Nature Medicine, a specialist journal of 
the London-based Nature group.

--=====================_11391676==_.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

February 8, 2003 -- Police were party poopers at two popular West Side 
nightclubs last night, shuttering the hot spots after amassing evidence of 
rampant "designer drug" use and sales.

Narcotics cops shut down Club Exit on West 56th Street and the Sound 
Factory on West 46th Street after a 22-month undercover investigation.

During the probe, undercover cops posing as clubgoers purchased a laundry 
list of drugs - mostly "ecstasy" - and witnessed numerous drug transactions 
and patron drug use.

"Thanks to our detectives' hard work, we are sending a clear message to 
nightclub owners: If you allow illegal drugs to saturate your business and 
endanger your patrons, we'll shut you down," said Police Commissioner Ray 
Kelly.

Over the last three years, the clubs have been the scene of more than 200 
drug-related arrests.

So far, 11 people have been arrested for their involvement in selling and 
using drugs - but no club owner has been charged.

State law could keep the clubs closed for up to a year - and cops say they 
could close more clubs soon.

Fear Is The Key

Bruce Dickinson, Janick Gers

          We live our lives in fever
          In a choking sweat of fear
       In the heat of the night you can
                 feel so much
       In the heat of the night I scream
                "Don't touch!"

           I remember a time when we
                used and abused
        And fought all our battles in vain
        I remember a time we thought that
               passion was free
   In the heart of the night... bodies aflame

              We live in fever...

         I hear your secret heartbeat
         I can hear your silent cries
       The kids have lost their freedom
        And nobody cares till somebody
                famous dies...

           I remember a time when we
                used and abused
        And fought all our battles in vain
        I remember a time we thought that
               passion was free
   In the heart of the night... bodies aflame

     Now we live, in a world of uncertainty
    Fear is the key - to what you want to be
       You don't get a say the majority
                gets its way
      You're outnumbered by the bastards
           till the day you die...

What a doof. Some of us patrons welcome illegal drugs - partying in SF

Subject: [sfraves] Request for Info: Audio Transfusion 3/1/03

Hey guys,
first of all thanks to all of the people who replied to my last post 
asking about power puff 2 info! Anyways, basically I'm coming back to sf 
for some weekend in the near future (all the way from Georgia to see 
friends), but I also want to time a good party since I've been cooped up 
in the south all year :-/. Anyways, I'm wondering what the vibe is on 
Audio Transfusion (flyer: 
http://www.norcal-raves.org/IMG/FLYERS/3_1_03_audiotransformation/full_3_1_03_audiotransforma.jpg
)? I know it's going to be a bay area location, but I'm wondering if 
anyone has any more specific info than that? (venue?)

Also, is neone planning to go? Anyways, if that doesn't look good, I'm definitely open to suggestions 
in the March 1 - March 11 range for parties (my spring break), and would 
love to know what people are excited about. I figure if all else fails, 
I'm going to screw school and just come out after my spring break for a 
back to back night at smack attack 2 and power puff 2 ;-), but this is def 
a last resort. Alright guys, sorry for the life story, just want to have a 
good time when I come back to cali :-). Thanks!

Chris

probably drink tequila.  vodka makes me surly and depressed, whiskey is
good for forgetting, but tequila is like a wild card...  mmmmm.....

Subject: [sfraves]  records Tax Deductiable!!


Hey Guys,

Just wanted to share some tax info with some of you semi pro DJ's if you 
bought alot of records in the 2002 tax year and got a few gigs but like many 
DJ's not enough to cover record expenses.. You can file what is called 
Schedule C.. Small business form and write off some of your record expense 
to minimize your Tax liability. KEEP IN MIND. Im not a tax expert by any 
means but I was doing my taxes last night and my Aunt was helping me and 
explained that I could file a schedule C She on the other hand is a CPA. So 
she knows just a lil bit about tax law ;)

So long story short if you have recipts for records that you have bought for 
the year  and contracts with promoters about fees you were to collect you 
can report that income and the cost of the records and in most "Part-Time" 
DJ's casses like myself my record expense way excedes proceeds that I 
brought in from contract gigs or verbal gigs with payment. So in my case it 
ended up that I get a lil bit more coin back from taxes so all that $$ you 
spend on recs isn't a total loss..

DISCLAIMER: Im not a professional tax accountant please consult your tax 
advisor to see if said info applies to you!

PPS: I doubt "pro" DJ's that get upwards of 500-1000 per gig can do a 
schedule C cause in most cases they are not dishing out that same amount on 
records.. At least none of the Bay area DJ's I know do.. And if they do It 
hardly show's in the sets that I have heard some jocks play, the same exact 
set upwards of a month in rotation..


Happy Trails!

Macadio

Also note that if you've already been doing this for the last two years,
you might want to skip it for this year's return. The IRS frowns upon
"small businesses" that "lose" thousands of dollars in every year. I was
told by another CPA that after 3 years, you're likely to get audited.

That said, last year I got a nice fat return thanks to my Schedule C --
I would have owed a couple hundred bucks if I hadn't filed it. ;)

No doubt. Of course, most big-name DJ's get promos thrown at them all
day, so I wouldn't count on them not actually *having* a lot of records.
I guess it's just "safe" for them to play those charted tunes rather
than busting out something /interesting/. I guess the same could be said
for any facet of pop music, though.

Subject: [sfraves] turntablism (I found something nifty)

rent the dvd for "scratch." skip the movie and go to the bonus CD.

on the bonus cd, there's an awesome qbert how-to thingy...not only does he
give excellent advice on how to scratch, he also turns out to be an expert
plumber.

also excellent is the scratch notation demo. Rob Swift demonstrates a
number of different scratches. the footage is great, especially since you
can put it on half speed and watch him scratch in slow motion. the
scratching is so quick you can't see it any other way.

the only problem is that most of the techniques center on the crossfader,
and for rave DJs, the crossfader tends to not only be much wider, it also
usually operates on a broader curve which is less well-suited to scratching.

luckily Q-Bert provides one possible answer in his how-to video. you can use
the faders instead of the crossfader. he points it out as simply a different
method which produces a different (more textured) effect, in his section on
how to do lazer scratches, but it's worth exploring as a general alternative
to crossfader scratching owing to the generally broader crossfader curves on
rave/club mixers.

there's also a fragment of QBert's movie. combination of turntablism and
Adobe After Effects. it's pretty great.

once upon a time I broke my crossfader beat-juggling jungle. then I forgot
all about turntablism for years.

now, of course, I get interested in it again - having sold over 100 hip-hop
records on eBay, completely cleaning out my hip-hop collection, and leaving
me only Muppet records to scratch with.

*sigh*

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Club Exit and Sound Factory in NYC Closed

You know, this may sound hypocritical, but while I occasionally like to
indulge in illegal substances, I hate being approached by drug dealers when
I'm out partying. If I want to do something, I always bring it with me,
after getting something from a friend that I know is clean and safe. I don't
trust anything from someone I'll never see again. When I used to go to
massives, I would always go "candy", and thus was a target for every sketchy
guy with a bag of pills in his pocket. My hypocrisy also extends to pot.
While I like to smoke it sometimes, and think it should be legal, I could
never sell it, no matter how desperate for money I became. Perhaps growing
up in East Oakland has given me a bad taste for drug dealers. Which is why I
like going to undergrounds, where no one ever tries to sell me anything.

Happy  :-)

Iraq Grants Anti-War 'Human Shields' Entry Visas



  Several members from the local Spaz and 5Flowershop collectives are on 
their way to Iraq.  They have been sending emails describing their 
experiences.  Last messages were from  Amann, Jordan.

ANKARA (Reuters) - A group of around 50 Western anti-war activists received 
visas Tuesday to enter Iraq where they plan to form "human shields" in an 
effort to deter a possible U.S.-led attack on the Arab state.

The volunteers said at an impromptu news conference in the Turkish capital 
they hoped their presence and the possibility of Western casualties would 
encourage U.S. political leaders and military planners to re-think any 
plans to bomb Baghdad for its alleged development of weapons of mass 
destruction.

"I am an American human shield on this trip to Baghdad to try and stop this 
war," said volunteer John Rosse.

"I ask American troops headed here...not to come, they have no business 
being here. They do not make good ambassadors. They are here to kill, 
murder, devastate the civilian population of Iraq. That is not an American 
thing to do."

The group is traveling across Turkey in a convoy, including a red 
double-decker bus, that is expected to cross into Syria on Wednesday before 
entering Iraq. The volunteers left London late last month and headed 
overland across Europe.

On arriving in Iraq, they plan to disperse to populated areas of Baghdad 
and other parts of the country. Critics have said they are naively playing 
into Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's hands.

Turkey last week deported Ken Nichols, a former U.S. marine who helped 
organize the "human shields" campaign, after he tried to enter the country 
using documents describing himself as a "citizen of the world."

Edward Cranswick, a seismologist who works for the U.S. government, said he 
wanted to raise awareness among Americans.

"I believe I am doing a small bit to raise attention, particularly (among) 
the American public...I want to be a human being alongside the Iraqis and 
that will get the attention of Americans," he said.

new year's day is celebrated at different times of year all around the world...i made mention that it is celebrated in the spring in taiwan in a post yesterday, but then the first thing that i thought of when i woke up this morning, besides, "why do i feel so dreadful?" was that oh, NO!!! i think that it is celebrated in the spring in Thailand, and i am not sure, and i will have to talk to my friend again and find out where she is from, because she is celebrating it in the spring and she not from china and where exactly in taiwan? and why do i have to feel so not worried, but something else uncomfortable at the moment, and i hope that the uncomfortable part will never, ever happen again, unless it is kind of like that sexy humiliation kind of discomfort, because that is also ALL LOVE...:)

That's pretty freakin' cool, indeed.  Actually, it was a few weeks ago when
I was up at night doing the whole "can't sleep so I'll think" thing and
thought that some serious activists should do that... Particularly
celebrities and various luminaries. Have them go and camp out in civilian
areas and say, "Ok, if you're so confident in how accurate your bombs are
and that there won't be any collateral damage, do your war thang." See how
eager the administration would be to rain bombs.

Then the next morning, I was scanning the news, and read about this. Go
figure. :)

What's sad is how many people actually believed the hype that "This was
being done for their own safety."  My adoptive grandfather, a
Japanese-American, was a US Army intelligence specialist in WWII. While he
was helping fight for his country, his non-military relatives were being
interned by it. The couple of times I tried to bring it up and ask him about
it, it was shushed as a "non-issue." At the time, he thought it was a good
idea, too. It's amazing what state of mind war can put people into.

Subject: Re: [sfraves]  records Tax Deductiable!!

**disclaimer: not giving tax advice, only opinion**

I believe you may only write off against what you earn (as a DJ), and are
you willing to claim that cash in order to take a deduction?  If you are
paid in checks and get a w-2 or 1099, then there you go...
Also, you cannot claim a loss for more than 2-3 years.  Otherwise, IRS
considers it as hobby and not business.
Take the deduction, but enjoy it for only a few years.

Don't forget to write off the needles, cartridges, gas to and from venues,
mileage, promotion expenses, and that small "home office" (audit alert) in
the corner.

There is also a performing artist credit. Check into it.

There isn't a lot of *taxable* income to be made in DJ'ing.  But the love
for the music is priceless!

Peace,
Chris

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii


Hi everyone.  I just wanted to introduce myself.  My name's phil.  I just moved to Arcata a couple of months ago.  About 5 years ago I was a member of seraves when i lived in atlanta, and met a lot of kewl peeps through it.  I'm 28 and been doin the rave thing since i was 16.  I got out of it for awhile because I moved to new orleans, and the scene there was pretty rough.  There seemed to be a better vibe at some clubs than at some parties so i just started clubbin.  I guess I'm really hoping to find some people and some parties in the humboldt area being that there's like nothing really to do on the weekends here but go sit in a bar and drink, and that gets old after about an hour.  I know i'm pretty far from san fran, but there wasn't a NCRaves or anything, so hopefully there will be some people here from my area, and if not i guess i'll just have to start going to san fran twice a month or something to get my groove fix.  Well, my books over.  Nice meeting everyone and i'll try to keep up w/the list topics.

plur

phil

I'm really sad about this because we just broke 300 users. 
 
Everything in the forums is gone. I'm slowing bringing everything back..

 
Recoverable: 
 
- smilies 
- avatars 
 
Unrecoverable: 
 
- usernames 
- posts 
 
It happenned around late evening yesterday. The database table the forum
runs off of was dropped somehow. Unfortunately the latest backup was
from this morning w/o the table. The server backs up the next day and
erases the previous backup. 
 
Email me if you have any questions.
 
Thanks,

do you have any backing for your claim that your forums were 'hacked'? this=

a great way to spread FUD. on behalf of all the other 'independant security

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR:I CANT BELIEVE THIS SH*T

While I think rounding them all up was not correct- I don't find it
hard to believe that there was a *very* serious threat to the Japanese
in this country.
My dad's got stories about what happened to the only German family in
his little Iowa town circa 1940- and they're not pretty.
Imagine the racism of today, and then imagine what it was like in the
30s and 40s.

Nathan, good point;

Everyone else, as usual, is letting their emotions make decisions for them, 
instead of using logic to calculate the best possible scenario.

No, holding japanese in camps wasn't cool. I fully agree. But, riddle me 
this batman; How many of those japanese would have been raped, murdered, 
stoned, persecuted had they been left to  walk the streets with the rest of 
the US? Now remember, pearl harbor had just been attacked in on the most 
cowardous acts ever committed during wartime in the 20th century.

What would you do? Hold a little anti-us protest? back then that wouldn't 
have been tolerated. Yeah right; You and Brooke would have found yourself 
staring back at a fire house and about 50 billy clubs.

I think this is best answered by the anonymous quote, "I'd rather die on my
feet than live on my knees."

The government took advantage of the fact that Japanese-Americans, at large,
were a very "compliant" people and wouldn't complain. Had this been done to
any other ethnic group, there would have been MUCH more of a furor.

There could've been public education, community efforts, etc. but instead,
we took the easy way.  What the government did was take a number of its own
citizens and put them in "protective custody" without making it a choice.
Not to mention that many of them had nothing to come home to when the war
was over, having their property reposessed or ransacked during the
internment. 

None of them had the CHOICE to stay at home and even take the risk of being
beaten for practicing the very freedoms that their parents and grandparents
had come here to enjoy and, mind you, contribute to.

It was a military attack on a military target. That's not outrageous. What
was outrageous was that it was the first modern attack on US soil - so I'll
give you the shock factor, and concede that yes, there may have been a great
risk to members of the Japanese-American population. But my point is that if
they wanted to continue their own lives, it should've been their choice to
assume that risk.

Once again, back to the quote at the beginning. Not everyone is as fiercely
protective of their civil rights as others. And certainly, not having been
there alongside my grandpa, I don't know how it feels to have your family
locked away by the very country you're engaging in armed combat for.  In
fact, from my experience, the descendants of the interned Japanese are more
bitter about what happened than those who were actually there. But just as
we're now more enlightened about race relations and politics than people
were in the 1940's, were also much more aware of what a violation it was of
civil rights.

What I do find ridiculous is that the same people who preach "smaller"
government and less federal interference with our lives condone the forcible
custody of one portion of the population in an attempt to "protect" it from
another. This all stems from the same bottom line that the government
doesn't trust its population. So in turn, why should we trust them?

We're not trusted with our bodies (see agenda on: drug war, reproductive
rights), and it seems when times get tough, we aren't trusted with our own
citizenry. The outrage, though, goes beyond whether or not my great-aunt
needed some sort of protection during WWII. The real outrage in hearing a
current politician support internment is its demonstration of a lack of
trust in the American public.

So what I ask is this - if your government doesn't trust you to do what's
right, should you trust them?

 - omid, getting off the soapbox.. for now  ;)

Word the fuck up!

Said it before, and I'll say it again.

Discrimination --> Segregation --> Concentration --> Extermination

This is the sad path that so many before us have followed. It can 
happen again if we let it.

Don't let it.

Where are all the events going on to shut down your organization? That is 
what I have been saving my bus money for.

I mean if you and yours can hate, when can I get a little evil in?

Okay I will not allow my emotions get to me and I can go on and on about
how it really went down...but i wont unless someone is curious but the
main thing is ..if it was for the protection of the Japanese American
people ...Why were the guns pointing at THEM while in camp.  Wouldnt they
be pointing in the other direction?  Remember also the camps were in the
middle of the desert...there was no escape even if you did get over the
barbed wire fences.  Yes...bad things happened to the other races at that
time as well but they do not compair to what happened to the Japanese A M
E R I C A N S.   Understand that I know how things really went down(passed
to me by relatives who lived it)  It is not what has been told or taught
to you in school or most books.

Peace...one love

That's kinda painting the Japanese as wussies, and I don't think that's
fair.  I doubt
they were any more or less vocal about their situation that anyone else
would have
been given the day and age and what America was back then.

I personally don't think any of us on this list can fathom the thinking that
went on
in the mind of the Japanese (that were in Japan) and how bloodthirsty they
were,
nor how afraid Americans were about spies in California.  A sad part of our
history,
but it wasn't founded on racism exactly, though race had a part in it.

> It was a military attack on a military target. That's not outrageous.

Perhaps you are forgetting one crucial thing....we weren't at WAR.  Ahem.
Bombing
ships of a country NOT at war at 6 a.m. is pretty cowardly and ruthless.

I do.  Post 9/11, how many Arabs have been killed in this 
country?  5?  Statistically, that's not very many, although I feel any loss 
of life is unacceptable.

Who lived in this town?  I find it hard to believe the ancestry wasn't 
German, since they brought the beer to America.  Where is Coors 
located?  How about Budwesier?  You think these are Irish names?

More violence today, more ignorance back then.

You're doing your part here, aren't you?  I think the point of ANSWER is 
that they don't hate.  We're not trying to stop an unnecessary war because 
we hate, but because we love.

We were, however, very busy helping supply the British against the Germans
(Japan's allies) during that time. The U.S. was scared shitless of finding
itself mired in another WW1 situation, and Pearl Harbor was the event that
helped tip the balance in favor of direct involvement in WW2. Apparently,
it came as something of a relief to more than a few higher-ups, since it
provided a great excuse to join in all war fun our allies in Europer were
enjoying.

I see it as a very similar situation to the 9/11 attacks, except for the
fact that there's no government to hold responsible this time. I see our
current situation as potential quagmire of counter-escalations and
neverending grudgematches.

A friend sent me this earlier today, a really funny-but-frightening
view of the potential mess our dearly beloved leaders are about slide
into: http://www.idleworm.com/nws/2002/11/iraq2.shtml

No, I don't either, particularly as a half-Japanese ;)  However, I was
reading an article a few months back (wish I could remember where it was)
that cited that as one of the reasons to go ahead with the internment.
Granted, since I can't remember where this was, I have about as much
credibility as Kent Brockman on the Springfield News.

I think "bloodthirsty" is a broad characterization. My (real, not adoptive)
grandfather was a young man in Japan at the time, and all his primary
concern were fishing and raising his 3 young daughters.  That'd be like an
Iraqi saying that all Americans are Arab-hating warmongers, or to make it
more  relevant, that all ravers are e-tarded drug fiends. "Fear of the
other" is what they call it in sociological circles.

> nor how afraid Americans were about spies in California.

Very justified fear after what happened. But to round people up and lock
them up in camps in middle of nowhere with Ansel Adams as the only friendly
white face to show up? C'mon, man. If fear justified everything, then we
should be locking up all middle eastern people, anyone who's ever
philosophically agreed with militia-types like Timothy McVeigh, and youths
who listen to Marilyn Manson and KMFDM and wear a lot of black.

> Perhaps you are forgetting one crucial thing....we weren't at WAR.  Ahem.
> Bombing ships of a country NOT at war at 6 a.m. is pretty cowardly and
ruthless.

I'll concede the not-at-war point, certainly! But I will now and forever
object to the term "cowardly" for any act of war/aggression, as it takes
some serious cojones to attack any sovereign state, especially knowing that
there will be swift retaliation. I think it's a cop-out word like
"evil-doer," used as a judgment label to mobilize people emotionally. Japan
had no justification for what it did in WWII, but in terms of the US
response (interment AND two nukes) has hardly anymore moral standing.

Anyway, this'll be my last post on the topic, as if I go on, it'll break
down into the usual left vs. right thing as the topic starts to stray from
the original point.. One which I'll re-iterate one last time:  That it's
outrageous that the US would treat its own citizens with such disregard for
their rights.  Sadly, I see it all happening again.

This time, it's the Iranian half of me worrying!  *grin*

P.S. Pre-emptively, I know other countries treat their own citizens worse, I
live here because I love it here, and I rail on our establishment because I
want to love it more.   So there. :)

I'm so afraid to drive there after the last time we went.  My family has a 
time share in Palm Springs (a quick drive to Coachella from the resort) and 
last time we got a phat condo-style room for four people with a full kitchen 
and our own patio.  We spent one day at Coachella and one day lying by the 
pool with waterslides having daquiris with rum floaters and 3 course meals 
delivered to our lawn chairs.  The whole trip was ideal and the room was free 
(since we own the time share and are entitled to our once-a-year vacation).

However my friends and I decided to leave a night early to beat commuter 
trafic back to the bay and were unfortunately caught in a drunk driving 
accident.  A man (drunk) hit a woman and sent her car across three lanes of 
the freeway spinning around until she got confused, hit the gas and drove 
headfirst into my car.  I was fortunately not driving at the time and 
fortunately our driver was experienced and got us to the side of the road 
quickly and unscathed.  My car, however, was totalled and we were stranded in 
SoCal without any transportation.  We ended up having to get a cab to an 
airport to rent a car to drive home.  Thank goodness no one was hurt but I 
will never ever drive my car down there again.

I would go again and volunteer my time share if someone wanted to stay with 
me, in exchange for not having to drive my own car.  It was probably a fluke 
and a one-time deal, but I've had too many run-ins with drunk drivers to risk 
it again.
Coachella was pretty fun, though.

Well then, certain folks should use the proper methods for airing their
greivances, shouldn't they?  As the saying goes, don't start none wont be
none.
I don't think a single person in America is happy that escalation is a
necessary
outcome of 9/11 and things could snowball, but nevertheless here's where
things are.

Glad to hear that :)   There are a few key factors to consider here
(regardless of
a handfull of Germans that encountered the same fate).  Many of the Germans
of
the period weren't 1st generation as much as many of the Japanese of the
same time
were.  Secondly, can you tell the difference between a German and other
European
Americans?  I can't.  The sad fact is that with the Japanese by default of
ethnic features
they were easy to spot.  Rounding up Germans and Italians is a much trickier
business,
and also as I mentioned many weren't "new immigrants".  So the Japanese had
a couple
of things going against them.  The other thing which wasn't on their side
was location.
Iowa, for example, isn't exactly a key spot militarily, economically, or
otherwise.  CA
was.  Lastly this all happened around the height of immigrations from Asia,
and as racism
(or rather fear and ignorance, the root of all racism) kicked in there was
this paranoia about
"being overrun" by asian immigrants and being "taken over from the inside"
as was said.
Doesn't excuse it, of course, but these are some things i've noted when
studying the historical
records of the times.  I'm sure there was a fair amount of biggotry involved
in the decision to go
forward with the camps, but there was also a fair amount of other factors as
well.

Strike that a replace with imperialistic, determined, unafraid, and
convinced (like all in such
situations) that they are God's people.  It makes for a very tough enemy.  I
didn't mean
bloodthirsty as a basic trait lol.  Obviuosly there were plenty of Japanese
at home
who had better things on their mind (as you point out) but there's also the
ones who
join the military to further the empire.  All aggressors are like this, 1/3
aren't interested, 1/3
are going with the flow (and that can change you after a while) and 1/3
truely believe what
they are doing is right.  So anyway, what I mean is what I said and that's
the only aspect of
the Japanese which Americans were familiar with (as they say, bad news
travels) at the time, i'd
bet.

I'm not justifying what happened, just saying that the motivations (while
wrong) were
based mostly in fear (uninformed and baseless fear, but nonetheless).  We're
a wiser
and kinder nation now I'd like to think and that is evidenced in the lack of
anti-Arab
sentiment following 9/11.  Sometimes to see who we are we have to look at
the now
and not the distant past, except in such cases where it's a reminded of how
we do not
want to be.  And I love KMFDM so there :)

I'm sorry, that doesn't wash.  By that token any playground bully is not a
coward.
In most cases it's usually a person bigger than everyone else who has some
serious
problems and takes them out on those who aren't able to defend themselves.
That's
the definition, in this case and imo, of cowardly with regard to Pearl
Harbor.  A sneak
attack on someone you're at war with is one thing, a sneak attack on a
non-participant is
another.  The nukes weren't an easy decision i'm sure, but it happened.  At
a mimimum
America was nice enough to help rebuilt Europe and Japan out of its own
pocket and the
kindness of its people who didn't want to be in that war and didn't affect
American soil
(PH aside) for the most part.

Fair enough.  It is outrageous, but at least it wasn't motivated by a pure
evil hatred
or something so barbaric.  It isn't excusable, but it's at least
understandable.  I'm glad
we didn't make such a poor decision about american citizens using the logic
of others
like Milosovic, Hussein, the Spanish, etc.  "Lucky" us?  =/

I'm not a "love it or leave it" person, no pre-emptivity needed lol.
Without discussion
what's the point?  America may be heading down a bad lane (remains to be
seen, imo)
but at least it's in the open heh.

Subject: Re: [sfraves]  NRR - France, why wont they fight?

Someone sent this to me, very funny stuff.

The following encapsulates the "old Europe" irrelevancy of France as
demonstrated lately:
THE COMPLETE MILITARY HISTORY OF FRANCE

Gallic Wars - Lost.   In a war whose ending foreshadows the next 2000 years
of French history, France is conquered by, of all things, an Italian.

Hundred Years War - Mostly lost.    Saved at last by female schizophrenic,
who inadvertently creates The First Rule of French Warfare: "France's armies
are victorious only when not led by a Frenchman."

Italian Wars - Lost.   France becomes the first and only country to ever
lose two wars when fighting Italians.

Wars of Religion - France goes 0-5-4 against the Huguenots

Thirty Years War - France is technically not a participant, but manages to
get invaded anyway.   Claims a tie on the basis that eventually the other
participants started ignoring her.

War of Devolution - Tied.   Frenchmen take to wearing red flowerpots as
chapeaux.

The Dutch War - Tied

War of the Augsburg League/King William's War/French and Indian War - Lost,
but claimed as a tie.  Three ties in a row induces deluded Frogophiles the
world over to label the period as the height of French military power.

War of the Spanish Succession - Lost.   The War also gave the French their
first taste of a Marlborough, which they have loved ever since.

American Revolution - In a move that will become quite familiar to future
Americans, France claims a win even though the English colonists saw far
more action. This is later known as "de Gaulle Syndrome", and leads to the
Second Rule of French Warfare: "France only wins when America does most of
the fighting."

French Revolution - Won, primarily due the fact that the opponent was also
French.

The Napoleonic Wars - Lost.  Temporary victories (see First Rule above)! Due
to leadership of a Corsican, who ended up being no match for a British
footwear designer.

The Franco-Prussian War - Lost.   Germany first plays the role of drunk Frat
boy to France's ugly girl home alone on a Saturday night.

World War I - Tied and on the way to losing, France is saved by the United
States. Thousands of French women find out what it's like to not only sleep
with a winner, but one who doesn't call her "Fraulein."  Sadly, widespread
use of condoms by American forces forestalls any improvement in the French
bloodline.

World War II - Lost.  Conquered French liberated by the United States and
Britain just as they finish learning the Horst Wessel Song.

War in Indochina - Lost.  French forces plead sickness, take to bed with the
Dien Bien Flu.

Algerian Rebellion - Lost.   Loss marks the first defeat of a western army
by a Non-Turkic Muslim force since the Crusades, and produces the First Rule
of

Muslim Warfare: "We can always beat the French."  This rule is identical to
the First Rules of the Italians, Russians, Germans, English, Dutch, Spanish,
Vietnamese and Esquimaux.

War on Terrorism - France, keeping in mind its recent history, surrenders to
Germans and Muslims just to be safe.  Attempts to surrender to Vietnamese
ambassador, but fails after he takes refuge in a McDonald's. For any country
silly enough to count on the French, the question  should not be, "Can we
count on the French?" but rather, "How long until the French collapse?"

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR:I CANT BELIEVE THIS SH*T

I'm entirely confused-

Where *anywhere* in my statement did I defend the camps saying that
they were "for their own good" or whatever you seem to have perceived?

All I was doing was pointing out that the US was a very different
place in the 40s, a place where I believe there was a genuine threat
against people from countries that we were at war with.

Right- my point was that it was a different place in the 40s.
And I'm not just talking about killings- racism takes many forms.

Well of course some ancestry was german- but come on- there's a big

FOB german family, accent and all.

I don't know about that- I would wager that it only *seems* like that-
With the communication methods of today, you hear about *everything*.
And I think today's violence is more shocking than it was back then.
Like today someone would get killed- back then the kid would get beat
up and their house would be set on fire or something.

Subject: [sfraves] Please help me find a party!!!

Hey guys,
first of all thanks to all of the people who replied to my last post 
asking about power puff 2 info! 

Anyways, basically I'm coming back to sf 
for some weekend in the near future (all the way from Georgia to see 
friends), but I also want to time a good party since I've been cooped up 
in the south all year :-/ and this is my last chance to party for a while. 

Anyways, I'm wondering what the vibe is on 
Audio Transfusion (flyer: 
http://www.norcal-raves.org/IMG/FLYERS/3_1_03_audiotransformation/full_3_1_03_audiotransforma.jpg
)? I know it's going to be a bay area location, but I'm wondering if 
anyone has any more specific info than that? (venue?)

Also, is neone planning to go? Anyways, if that doesn't look good, I'm definitely open to suggestions 

in the March 1 - March 11 range for parties (my spring break), and would 
love to know what people are excited about. I figure if all else fails, 
I'm going to screw school and just come out after my spring break for a 
back to back night at smack attack 2 and power puff 2 ;-), but this is def 
a last resort. Alright guys, sorry for the life story, just want to have a 
good time when I come back to cali :-). Thanks!

Chris

So is dropping an atomic weapon on a city, killing thousands of civilians,
and irradiating thousands more. :)

Especially when it's just to see what effect the atomic weapon would have.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] NRR:  I  BELIEVE THIS SH*T

WASHINGTON -- U.S. Rep. Howard Coble of Greensboro drew sharp criticism
Wednesday for saying in an interview that he agreed with the U.S.
government's internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II.



One reason why this politician might have said this

Would be to test the public's response to the internment of a large group of
people.


You could say they are test marketing the idea of internment camps.

Maybe" Interment Theme Camp"  = "The human solution" might be the logical
outcome of such vigorous testing.

"Interment Theme Camp"
 A "Theme-Camp" paradise guarding the safety of its "Guests".

Subject: [sfraves] Friday?

Having absolutely nothing to do on Valentines day,

Anyone know of anything going off on the 14th? I was actually considering
hitting up a club, but have a feeling that dealing with a bunch of drunks
on V-day will be remarkably unpleasant.

I checked the SFraves calendar, and it looks like a lot of clubly mothlies
and weeklies. And, despite the immense draw of a live goat, I don't want
to hit up the Masquerade.

Any suggestions aside from sharing a 40 with a bum in the mission and
lamenting about girls gone by?

Peace,

TRH

I'm gonna be wild and crazy and *fly* to LA, then head out to Coachella with
friends from there.  $39 each way isn't bad.  If I do end up getting a new
car and driving, though, I'll let y'all know.

As desolate as that road out there can be, it is statistically dangerous.
Throughout my (yikes) 7 years at college down there, I knew of a good number
of people involved in accidents between LA/Palm Springs and LA/Vegas. I've
always driven the roads anyway (it's an assumed risk) and had no problems,
but it's a valid concern.

So if you need to hitch a ride, when they fire up the message board at
coachella.com again, you can check out all the rideshare info, as well as
buses to/from LA, Phoenix, Vegas, etc.

You know, it's funny how I generally slag on massive events with really
overpriced tickets, but after finally experiencing the real festival vibe
last year, I just want everyone else to go and take part :)

Subject: RE: [sfraves] NRR:  I  BELIEVE THIS SH*T

Its certainly not impossible that such an internment could happen.  My
sister who is an ultra liberal was actually suggesting this right after
9/11.  If people with her values can be convinced to support such things its
certainly not an unimaginable outcome.

Ever watch the television show the Prisoner?  Retired secret agents and
operatives are taken against their will to The Village, a themed
environment, where they are subjected to mind control, torture, and various
manipulations with the goal of extracting information.  Many of the  themes
we face today were pretty thoroughly explored in this show including the
difficulty of telling the keepers from the prisoners, the commoditization of
human values, and more.  Worth renting the DVDs if you haven't seen this
show.

Be seeing you,

Peter

Subject: RE: [sfraves] NRR: I BELIEVE THIS SH*T


WASHINGTON -- U.S. Rep. Howard Coble of Greensboro drew sharp criticism
Wednesday for saying in an interview that he agreed with the U.S.
government's internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II.



One reason why this politician might have said this

Would be to test the public's response to the internment of a large group of
people.


You could say they are test marketing the idea of internment camps.

Maybe" Interment Theme Camp"  = "The human solution" might be the logical
outcome of such vigorous testing.

"Interment Theme Camp"
 A "Theme-Camp" paradise guarding the safety of its "Guests".

I forget where I said that, could you refresh my memory? Stop seeing shit
in black and white - one can give reasons for an action or reaction
without excusing it. All I'm saying is that pearl harbor was not a
complete surprise, for a number of reasons ranging from US support for
Japan's enemies to signs that something was brewing that were not acted
upon.

Just. Like. September. 11th.

"Things could snowball" is not "where things are", it's where things
"might go" if the current administration continues "being stupid". I'd
like to think that in a democracy, we have some say in making sure that
our representative don't make boneheaded mistakes, like squandering the
wgoodwill of the entire world a scant year after the attack. :[

First.. it's a strategic first strike... just like what we are going to do
to Iraq.. its war.. also to say that the japanese were blood thirstly is
very ignorant.. They had to hit us before we hit them.. and if you are
talking about being blood thirsty dont forget who the only country to ever
use an atomic bomb during war is. and we used it on a people that wouldnt
stop fighting becasue they loved thier country soo much... who are the
cowards?? and we are about to do a simular cowardly act by carpet bombing
another "third-world" country...

How many people have to die untill we realize that the US has done almost
nothign to help the world, only to hurt more people for its own ends.. dont
forget that recently Sadam was our alli.. and so was the Taliban.. infact we
gave the Taliban weaponds to fight the Russians when we knew what millitant
rule was doing to the country... and what about Sadi Arabia.. we talk about
war on terror, most (I belive all but 3) of the suspected 9/11 terrorist
came from that country and on the bill of high ranking members of the Sadi
kindom... and we are HUGE allis whith them even now.. I wonder why that
is???

anyway thats all I have to say about that...

Peace,
Mystic

I have spent years reading and studying other materials from this period in 
an attempt to understand the extraordinary levels of violence committed by 
the Nazis, Japanese and, yes, the United States in WW II.  The most recent 
bloodbath in the former Yugoslavia is another example of the heart of 
darkness in our times.

When one unleashes the monster of war one must deal with the consequences 
in oneself and others.  War is the giving over of the soul to a number of 
evils, including greed, self-focused fear, and abandonment of 
compassion.  The latter, I think, is probably the most important.

The recent discussions of internment in Washington result from efforts by 
organizations like the American Bar Association to get some clarification 
from our government on the status of "prisoners of war" and "suspects" now 
being held in limbo.  This is part of a larger pattern that seems to emerge 
when countries enter into a warlike focus:  curtailment of civil 
liberties;  propaganda (lies);  persecution of those who disagree with the 
agenda or who are just "different"; and eventually a complete substitution 
of passion for reason.

We are headed down this path.  Our Republic is in danger, not from without 
but from within.  Our country is becoming and international pariah.

Love,

Apollo

So i went up to the rage last night for bad company and diesel boy. 
When i got up there i realized that i got my wallet stolen with everything 
inside it. Luckily the cop there was really cool and looked me up on his 
computer in his car and confirmed that i was 18 with the head bouncer and 
they knocked off half the price. LoL. Fun
 The show was great fun. It was packed there but a lot of good dancers came 
out. I had a good time, even though by the near end of the night i was having 
a way better time in the house room. There was a lot of room to dance and not 
too many sweaty guys in every corner.lol Who ever spun the last set in there 
really got my groove goin. haha. 
Well, yeah i hope everyone had a good time. 
Happy Chinese New Year.. almost.
peace. Cocoa.

some things have come up...here is my mass reply: ...a. no, i don't even know you and please go away now....b. don't refer to your wife as "the wife" unless you both have some sort of an understanding that that is not totally gross and sexist...also, don't diminish the significance of your relationship by mocking it....c. DO buy any piece of lingerie for your woman, and do give it to her without your ego input. :)

Subject: [sfraves] questions: m di v

first question: is it come for the goat, stay for the techno? or come for
the techno, stay for the goat?

not necessarily an important question, but one that's been troubling me
personally.

second question: has anyone noticed the inordinate amount of conversation
generated by the list in general, and myself specifically, for this party?

this endless banter is actually a very good thing for Shane and the other
ppl running the thing. it means increased turnout in all probability. in
fact you've got to wonder if they didn't include the live goat simply to get
some extra attention and thereby more ticket sales.

disclaimer: i have not actually been paid to draw attention to this party.
nor am I accusing Shane of any involvement in some kind of goat-->attention
plot. however, Shane, I do have to reprimand you for spinning at this party.
Shane techno, altho it does have many virtues, is definitely not the humane
thing to force a goat to listen to.

third question: am I the only person who has noticed that this party, a
Valentine's party featuring a live goat, will take place while Venus is in
Capricorn?


Giles


ps: Mercury is also in Capricorn. that can't really mean much tho. astrology
works sometimes, but how seriously can it really be taken? I think it's a
bit much to say that cosmic wheels have been set in motion which we are
governed by and powerless to stop.

I mean, it's a bit Vincent Price, really, isn't it?

pps: I will say no more about goats. it's a sad day when George Bush gets
more attention than a live goat, but it's downright ludicrous when a live
goat gets more attention than DDR.

this morning I was watching Moulin Rouge and I couldn't help being reminded
of San Francisco. it starts off there's a Bohemian revolution brewing, and
the guy goes to Paris to be part of it. this is kinda what initially brought
me to San Francisco, and the odd thing about that is that it's been what
brought people to San Francisco in the past as well. it's what brought the
Beats to San Francisco in the 50s, and when Kerouac and his crew made the
whole Beat experience a literary phenomenon, that's what brought bucketloads
of hippies to SF in the 60s. there's a great book about smuggling marijuana
during this period, unfortunately the book is out of print, but it describes
the feelings of the Beats when the first waves of hippies crashed on the
shores of North Beach and "kids from Kansas stood standing on street corners
waiting for something to happen."

I came to SF from Chicago. Chicago is a mean, nasty, dangerous city. the
posture and walk I had adopted there, both of which had become habit, made
me stick out like a sore thumb when I first arrived - to the point that in
the Tenderloin I more than once saw people cross the street when they saw me
coming. when I lived in the Mission, I wore red and white - the local gang
colors - almost every day, just to show the gangbangers I wasn't scared of
them. my attitude was, I don't care if you're packing an Uzi, you're not
from Chicago. and a fellow Chicagoan I worked with told me how he had been
the "victim" of an attempted mugging in the Tenderloin. a heroin addict
pushed a gun in his face, demanding his money, so he smacked the gun out of
the addict's hand and beat him to a pulp.

now Chicago, as bad as it is - and it isn't a good place to live - is
nonetheless the birthplace of house. but compare San Francisco house to
Chicago house and you begin to see why I buy into these words quoted far
above (very far above at this point). Chicago house is full of urgency,
danger, and passion. the 303 acid line was invented in Chicago. meanwhile,
San Francisco house is comfortable and relaxing. San Francisco house is very
popular, and indeed some of it is quite good - I'm not dissing it. I like
it, in fact. but it doesn't have that intensity. it doesn't even have
anything remotely resembling that intensity. Chicago house carries within it
distant echoes of Chicago's other great music, the blues. (birthplace of
house, home of the blues.) however, in San Francisco, easy living sometimes
comes dangerously close to easy listening.

I believe this explains a good deal of the polarization which occured in the
rave scene between massives and undergrounds. the music at massives was
simply too nice - devoid of fire and lightning, completely lacking in true
soul. the underground response was necessary, bkz raves have never been
about easy listening or mainstream music, and in San Francisco, certain
varieties of rave music became so mainstream that they ceased to have any
real meaning at all.

however, I'm not totally sure of this element of my analysis. what I am sure
of is that, historically speaking, Chicago exhibits cycles of musical
development which exist to specifically counteract the overall oppression
one experiences in that city. and that oppression is very real, btw.
virtually every movie by Chicago filmmakers, or with a Chicago setting,
features the heroes being chased by the cops at some point. there's a reason
for that.

San Francisco, I believe, also exhibits historical cycles, and I think
whoever wrote these words of truth which Migurski found floating on the
Internet identified those cycles, and even their approximate length, with
uncanny accuracy. those words describe the Beatniks perfectly, and the
Beatniks had their day fifty years ago. those words describe the hippies as
well, and that too was very long ago. only time will tell, but I suspect
these words will one day describe Epiphany, Viberation, Children of the Sun,
and all the other great and once-great underground collectives - as well as
Harmony and other purveyors of massives, and indeed Koinoinea, 1015 Folsom,
and everyone in between.

(random thing: Koinoinea was deliberately preventing their BSPs from
appearing on sfraves as early as 2000. I asked someone why and he told me
they wanted to avoid drama.)

however, the historical anaylsis, useful tho it may be, does not explain
things like this:

>Often Artists who have made a name for themselves will come
>to San Francisco and their Artistic output will drop to zero. There is no
>hard edge to culture here; the living is easy, you get spoiled playing
>with the alterno-children dressing fun and looking for smoochies.

I believe this is simply intrinsic to the city. Just as living in Chicago
requires that you watch out for the cops and realize that they are simply
the biggest gang, so does living in San Francisco require that you sit back,
relax, and realize that you may never achieve any of your ambitions there.

This is why I'll never live in San Francisco again, or even the East Bay.
I'm still on this list because, like so many others before me, I left my
heart in San Francisco, but ultimately living in San Francisco is a matter
of choosing comfort over ambition. Not me. This is why I've decided to move
to Arizona. Phoenix has a street called "Loop 303." I think that's a good
omen. Somebody somewhere is inventing the next equivalent of the 303 acid
line, and the lessons of history would indicate that this is more likely to
happen in a police state than it is in San Francisco. And Arizona is
certainly a police state. From the moment you drive into the state, passing
the enormous billboard with a star in the center of the words "Welcome To
Arizona. Watch Your Language," this fact is inescapable.

Of course, I'm reluctant to face the perils of living in a police state, but
I'm not that worried. I don't care if they're packing Uzis. They're not from
Chicago.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR:I CANT BELIEVE THIS SH*T

Yes, i agree that Japanese Americans would have
suffered prejudice during that time. But the point is
that they were taken unvoluntarily into camps where
the conditions were poor, and armed guards patrolling
the gates. On top of this, they were forced to give up
their businesses and possessions. The views of the
time werent to protect them, they were percieved as a
threat. No matter what the case, the goverenment has
no right to place people in seclusion against their
will.

my take,

Delia

Hello everyone!
Has anyone noticed that there are very few places in the Bay Area to get 
your Technics fixed?  Not only that, but it's really expensive to have 
fairly simple repairs made.  Well, I have been collecting vinyl for 
about 6 years, have a background in electronics and  have been fixing my 
own tables and my friends tables for a while now, and decided to do 
something about this problem instead of just complaining about it. So, I 
recemtly started offering a quality, low cost alternative to my fellow 
DJs and vinyl enthusiats out there who need work done to their 
turntables.      

So, here's the info:
I provide NON-WARRANY repair services and perform custom modifications 
to turntables, specializing in Technics, although I welcome any brand 
name.  My rates will beat just about anyone out there, and there is a 
short turn around time on most repairs.  I'm a one man operation and 
have no overhead, so the savings get passed on to you.  All work is 
guaranteed and includes a basic check-up and cleaning at no extra charge.  

Standard Repairs and Services
.    Deluxe tune-up & calibration includes: (pitch calibration, general 
clean-up, spindle lubrication,
      tonearm locking ring tightening, headshell terminal cleaning, etc.)
.    Replace RCA phono cable
.    Installation of new pop-up light bulb
.    Tonearm replacement
.    Pitch fader replacement
.    Fix broken power switch - where ON/OFF switch spins but doesn't 
turn the unit ON or OFF
Note: I can fix just about anything that goes wrong even though it's not 
listed here.

Custom Modifications for Technics
.    Internal grounding -- eliminate that annoying ground wire
.    Blue LED Kit -- Customize the color of 33, 45, pitch and strobe 
lights.  Pop-up light not included.  
.    'Vinyl Touch' Reverse Kit installation - for the serious 
turntablist.  Play your records backwards with pitch control!
        By Schutt MixMachines www.mixmachines.com/products/vtr-tuni.html
.    Pitch Fader Modifications
        .  Pitch range adjustment -- Is +/-8 not enough for you?  
Increase your pitch range.
        .  Removal of the annoying center 'click' for the SL1200-MK2 models
        .  Center quartz lock removal for the SL1200-MK2 - for 
continuous pitch control like the M3D
.    Phone cord upgrade -- replace the stock phono cord with a higher 
quality RCA cable
.    Custom shell cover -- change the color of your decks!
.    Brake Adjustment -- stop on a dime, stop hard and rewind, smoothly 
slow to a stop
More custom modifications in the works...


PLEASE BE AWARE:  I do not do any warranty repairs.  You should go to a 
Panasonic Authorized Service Center if your turntable is still under 
warranty.  Some of the custom modifications will VOID your warranty.  I 
use only QUALITY components, specifically Technics® brand parts or, upon 
request, higher quality replacement parts such as Monster Cable RCA 
cords.  I get parts directly from Technics and do not mark up the cost 
at all.  You pay what I pay, including tax and shipping and handling.    

FOR SERVICE:  Call Stephen Freskos at (510)301-9221 or email to 
stephen@freskos.com for quotes on service and repairs.  Please leave a 
message with your contact information and brief description of the 
trouble.  Your call or email will be returned shortly.

EQUIPMENT DELIVERY:  Currently, pick-up and delivery in the East Bay 
including Contra Costa County, S.F., and the North Bay is by appointment 
only.  On-site/same day repairs are available, depending on the problem 
and parts needed.  There is an additional charge for same day service.

Thanks!
-Stephen Freskos

I saw this on the web.  Its a response to the NYC closures.  In theory, it seems like a good idea:  if someone asks you if they can "score", you assume the worst (that they are an undercover cop) and go get security to throw them out.

 

My question: Can security really throw someone out, just because I accuse them of asking me for drugs?

 

And, is that fair to the person, if they are not a cop and just want to have a good time?  maybe that answer would be don't do drugs, and if you do, get it from someone you know/trust?

 

And the other side of the coin: if you KNOW someone is pushing in a club, should you get security to throw them out, or will that just bring more bad press to the club?

 

Just wondering what others think about this idea.

 

<<<<<<<< 

 

What's going on is the dance music scene is slowly but surely under attack.  It is under attack by those that see no distinction between the people who do illegal drugs (which exist in every music, art, and cultural scene) and the dance music scene itself.  The last couple of years has seen the closure of many great clubs such as Twilo in NYC and Buzz in DC.  Just this past weekend the NY Police shut down two major clubs there, Exit and Sound Factory because of drug use they saw and buys they were involved in.

On the same weekend here in SF, undercover police were at 1015 Folsom, DNA Lounge, and other commercial venues, as well as even underground parties they would have had to go through some trouble to locate.  In every party it's the same.  Normal looking party go-er asks people in the party if they can buy any illegal drugs, usually ecstasy.  In some cases, naive person may try and help this person out, only to be busted later.  It's happening every weekend.  They may not make a bust every time, but they are gathering data and contacts to make bigger arrests later and make a case to shut down our favorite spots to go dancing and hear music.

We all know we can't stop people from making individual decisions about what they choose to do.  But we can spread the word amongst our friends that this is happening, and we need to be aware of it.

If someone in a club or party asks you if you know where to get illegal drugs, do us all a favor.  Tell them YES, wait right here, and then go inform security so they can be thrown out of the party immediately.  You may ruin someone's night just trying to have fun, but obviously that's well worth protecting our scene.

Make no mistake, the police are trying to shut down venues where electronic dance music is played.  They are doing this because of the actions of a minority of the people that come to the parties, and it's jeopardizing all of us.  We in the scene know it is a positive movement, bringing people from many different walks of life together to connect and share.  We must not just assume everything is going to be OK, it will not be unless we make it so.

You know, this may sound hypocritical, but while I occasionally like to

indulge in illegal substances, I hate being approached by drug dealers 

when

I'm out partying. If I want to do something, I always bring it with me,

after getting something from a friend that I know is clean and safe. I 

don't

trust anything from someone I'll never see again. When I used to go to

massives, I would always go "candy", and thus was a target for every 

sketchy

guy with a bag of pills in his pocket. My hypocrisy also extends to 

pot.

While I like to smoke it sometimes, and think it should be legal, I 

could

never sell it, no matter how desperate for money I became. Perhaps 

growing

up in East Oakland has given me a bad taste for drug dealers. Which is 

why I

like going to undergrounds, where no one ever tries to sell me 

anything.

 

Happy  :-)

February 8, 2003 -- Police were party poopers at two popular West Side 

nightclubs last night, shuttering the hot spots after amassing evidence 

of 

rampant "designer drug" use and sales.

 

Narcotics cops shut down Club Exit on West 56th Street and the Sound 

Factory on West 46th Street after a 22-month undercover investigation.

 

During the probe, undercover cops posing as clubgoers purchased a 

laundry 

list of drugs - mostly "ecstasy" - and witnessed numerous drug 

transactions 

and patron drug use.

 

"Thanks to our detectives' hard work, we are sending a clear message to 

nightclub owners: If you allow illegal drugs to saturate your business 

and 

endanger your patrons, we'll shut you down," said Police Commissioner 

Ray 

Kelly.

 

Over the last three years, the clubs have been the scene of more than 

200 

drug-related arrests.

 

So far, 11 people have been arrested for their involvement in selling 

and 

using drugs - but no club owner has been charged.

 

State law could keep the clubs closed for up to a year - and cops say 

they 

could close more clubs soon.

I come from NYC, and what I've experienced in SF is that the city will 
either destroy you completely creatively or otherwise -- and you leave, hit 
the therapists couch, or dip into the hard stuff -- or it transforms and re 
energizes creative output.  There is almost complete freedom here.  Very 
difficult for some to handle.  No old boys' network, so that the sphere of 
privilege that exists on the East Coast is meaningless.  This place is not 
without competitive and other motivational forces.  Seems that way on the 
surface, but there is fire and passion underneath the appearance of comfort.

I've never felt "comfortable" here.  Far from it.  I feel I'm on the edge 
of something new.  Sometimes disorienting.  Never boring.  The coming 
together of the East, West and Hispanic culture.

Chicago vs SF house.  Guess it depends on what one believes typifies SF 
house these days.  One thing we lack here that I miss is a vibrant gay, 
African American music culture.  But house here is evolving in wondrous 
ways lately -- and I'm talking a move back to hard edge, gut burning stuff.

Love,

Apollo

I find this a fascinating geography/creativity thread you have touched on here.

What do you all make of the SF DnB scene as it existed a few years 
back? SF DnB was some of the hardest around. I'm not into that scene 
any more and no doubt it's changed a bit, but I always wondered how 
such a hard and angry sound could have been so popular here in the 
land of love and flowers.

I always thought it had something to do with what seemed at the time 
like a disproportionately, and also refreshingly large, participation 
of the females representin' in that scene. Don't know if that's a 
connection or not or what it could mean, but it's one I ruminated on.

Any thoughts?

Ascension brings new entertainment forms and cultural movements developed
deep in the underground to a club environment where they can be
experienced in context by a broader audience. Ascension is now in it's
third year and has evolved into a showcase featuring the best of the
electronic dance and art culture from the Bay Area and beyond.

Elements of Ascension will include music, performance artists, multi-media
art, and fashion all originating, evolving, and drawing inspiration from
electronic music.

Music will concentrate on live electronic acts and DJs who produce a
significant part of their own play list in the moment.

We are stoked to have as special guests Uberzone - playing a special live
set in the main room starting at 11:45.

A fashion show (10pm) will kick things off in the main room featuring some
of the most promising designers in the Bay Area with beats by Ikarus.

Performance troupes will strive to push the boundaries in a variety of
dance and movement genres.

Art installations will create atmosphere and encourage interaction, & the
wicked visuals will simply blow the roof off this place before the night
is through!

Proceeds from the event will benefit the San Francisco Late Night
Coalition (SFLNC).

Energized by Red Bull Energy Drink, and produced by Infinite Kaos and a
cast too numerous to name... love to all!

Don't tell me how to see things, my interpretation of your statement was
what
it was.  You say it isn't what you meant, that's cool.  But don't go off the
deep
end telling me i'm seeing in black and white when that's not the issue at
all.
I agree it *might* not have been a surprise, but that's something which has
not yet been proven to be so.  I'm familiar with the arguement and evidence,
it could go either way still.

I think things regarding Iraq have been snowballing for a long long time,
and if
the world (us especially) owned up to things in the last two decades none of
us would be in this prediciment.  So the question now is, do we not deal
with
it again and find a worse situation facing us in the future due to some new
amazing
stupid attrocity commited by Saddam?   That's the question.  Until a bomb
drops
there's no point in arguing that we're doing things incorrectly, clearly
we're still
working on a diplomatic solution.

This revisionist history just cracks me up, where do you buy your history
books,
pansies R us?  Sorry to insult you but we were so far from wanting to be
involved
in WWII it isn't even funny, and you think Pearl Harbor was a strategic
first strike?
Why don't you poke around a little more about the 1938-1941 period of the
war
with respect to us supplying the British and get back to me, okay?  We used
it on
a country that was so brainwashed they wouldn't stop fighting.  Your logic
implies
we wanted to take over Japan.  Do we own Japan?  Are they under our thumb?
Have they ever been?  No.

www.internationalanswer.org Volunteers urgently needed.

Friday February 21: Coordinated Day of Student Resistance, walk outs and 
other acts of non-compliance. Contact Youth and Student ANSWER for flyers

Here is what you can do today to help stop the war:

  1.  HELP BUILD THE FEBRUARY 16  ANTI-WAR MARCH IN SAN FRANCISCO.

To PUBLICIZE THE MARCH, download flyers at 
<http://www.actionsf.org/>www.actionsf.org and make copies to distribute in 
your community. Or contact us at 415-821-6545 or answer@actionsf.org to 
have flyers sent to you by mail.

2.    JOIN THE PEOPLE'S ANTI-WAR REFERENDUM AT 
<http://www.votenowar.org/>WWW.VOTENOWAR.ORG

We're encouraging everyone to get involved in building this 
campaign.  Congress did not end the war in Vietnam, but the people's 
movement did, and once again it is up to the people to stop this war.  The 
VoteNoWar People's Anti-War Referendum is an effort to expose the lie that 
the people of the United States support George W. Bush's planned war in 
Iraq and reveal the mass anti-war opinion that exists as a majority 
sentiment. The masses of votes against the war will be presented at a 
Grassroots Peace Congress (as opposed to the U.S. "War' Congress) on Jan. 
19 in Washington, DC.

*  to VOTE NO TO WAR, go to 
<http://www.votenowar.org/referendum.html>http://www.votenowar.org/referendum.html

* to HELP GATHER VOTES AGAINST THE WAR, download the flyer at
   <http://www.votenowar.org/referendum.pdf>http://www.votenowar.org/referendum.pdf, 
make copies, and mail the votes in to the address
   listed on the bottom of the flyer.  You can help build the People's 
Anti-War Referendum in
   your community, campus, high school, and place of worship.



* to HELP ORGANIZE THESE EVENTS, contact your local ANSWER chapter to attend
organizing meetings, pick up outreach materials (posters, flyers, etc.), 
volunteer and plug  yourself and your community into this movement. In San 
Francisco ANSWER meets weekly on Tuesday at 7 PM at the Womens Building at 
3543 18 St.

* NOT NEAR AN ANSWER CHAPTER?  Start your own organizing center for the 
event or just help get out the word.  Generate discussion about the war, 
organize buses to travel from your community to the rallies, or hold your 
own solidarity rally.  You can have outreach materials sent to you as well.


3.    DONATE OR HELP RAISE FUNDS

Anti-war activities and materials can cost thousands of dollars and ANSWER 
is solely funded by its grassroots supporters.  Any contribution you or 
others can make will help pay for flyers, phone calls and 
posters.  Organize a fundraiser with your family & friends to help stop the 
war! Supporters can donate online at 
<http://www.progressunity.org/>www.progressunity.org or send checks to 
ANSWER, 2489 Mission Street #24, San Francisco CA 94110.


On January 18th, 500,000 people marched on Washington DC and 200,000 on San 
Francisco as well as thousands around the world announcing with a massive 
visible and vocal presence the growth of the new anti-war movement to stop 
George W. Bush's plans to wage war against Iraq.  Let's keep up the 
momentum until we stop the war!

So?

You constantly prove even with all the data, incorrect conclusions can 
still be drawn.

Subject: [sfraves] Places to buy music?

Aight...Sooo, does anyone know of any good places (Tower and Wherehouse do
*not* count as good places in my book, sorry)  to buy music?  I'm going to
hit up Rasputin (sp?) and Street Light in the next week, but somehow I don't
think they'll have everything I'm looking for.  I'm a dork and sold my car
with all my cds in it, fortunately,  they were all burned, buuuut, that
still doesn't change the fact that I now have no music *gasp!*  Anyway, if
anyone knows of any good places I'd really love to know so I can get my
groove back on while in the car.

PS - Any places that have a wide selection of house (onionz style)  and
jungle (dara, deisel boy style)  and also that shiat kid bippy spins, (dunno
what it is but I like it!) are just an added plus!  Aww jigga.

Thank ya!
~Emily

Due to unfortunate circumstances, my fraternity is still looking for a dj to 
spin at our formals this Friday [Feb 14].  The venue is the SFO Marriott in 
Burlingame.  We need sound ready by 8:30, and our formal will be ending at 
12:30.  If you spin hip hop/mainstream please email me back with a phone 
number you can be reached at along with an estimated price fee.   I will be 
checking this email every couple of hours.

So?

I don't prove that, it's just a fact of life.  But there's a difference
between
reaching different conclusions based on a broad base of knowledge and
reaching a different conclusion based on insufficient data.

If Saddam were truly dangerous, Saudi Arabia and Iran would have retasked

Subject: [sfraves] Duct tape and

Please encourage your fellow American citizens to buy Duct Tape and "_Black_
Plastic Sheeting'  Make sure to emphasize the "Black Plastic Sheeting"
Why?? You ask??

Cause-- Say we never get gassed by terrorists.
Well
You could offer to take that black sheeting and duct tape off their hands
for a discount.
Then you could black out the next party house you go to. The decorations and
black lights show up much better in a totally black environment. It also
retains and possibly enhances good vibes.

Now let us say they are really gullible. (and they must be pretty gullible
to listen to ANY thing the government tells them)  Tell them that secret
government studies have positively proven 97.3377% nullifications of deadly
muslim goat gas, (a secret nerve gas developed by sand dune living muslims
(who wear towels on they head) . Paint a theatrical picture of evil muslims
bearing gas bombs. )

Anyway tell them that Black Lights (lots of them)  and black light paints.
Nullify the poison in evil muslim goat gas.

If they are buying the story so far.

Tell them that Techno music drives muslims crazy.  There was a study by the
president himself that proved that muslims within a 5 mile radius stop being
evil and revert to Christianity.
Tell them that for 900$$$ you can buy A techno emitting device (1200m3d,
technics <pair>) that will clear 4 city blocks of any terrorists.

DO NOT FEEL GUILTY, (you pansy ass bleeding heart liberal)
Consider this reverse lynching.  A tar and feathering of the innocent
gullible lemmings.
Consider this your right. Your privilege. So stand up and spend someone
else's money.

 Huh? What about the Iran/Iraq war?

You don't see those heathens in Iran buying Black plastic sheeting (I hear
BLACK plastic sheeting works better against terrorist gas) and duct tape.
Do you??? And THEY live right next door!!

Just heard on CNN
"The new catch phrase is  "DUCT and COVER!"    hee hee  If this wasn't so
pathetically dangerously stupid thinking , it would be funny.

Did anyone notice that they played "Wag the Dog" every hour on cable during
the last days of Clinton. But you will not see it now.

Is this situation a lot like "Wag the Dog"??

Subject: Re: [sfraves] GOAT CONSPIRACY (was: questions)


The goat attention plot is more real than you know.  It has been
contolling Josh praxis for weeks now as far as I can tell.  I am
concerned for the safety of the rave scene, and the entire human race if
the goat succeeds in it's mission this Friday.

Placing the blame on Shane or Josh or any of the crew is exactly what the
goat wants you to do.  We need to drill down to the true cause of this
situation and find a solution, fast.

The astrological signs show that this theory is correct, as you've already
pointed out.  The question is what do we do about it?



On a positive note, It should be a great time.  Lots of live techno, and
other dance goodness, great people, and multi-room space...  Mix in the
transmissions from a telepathic goat, and bam, you've got a raging party!


See you there!

Subject: RE: [sfraves] not really your fault, migurski


a quote i've had around seems fitting for an answer to "why dnb was what
it was..."


"True music must repeat the thought and inspirations of the people and
the time."
George Gershwin

when things are secure and oh-so-grand as in the dotcom economy, the
music produced is directly proportional and frenzied to make up the
drama quotient not attained through daily struggle.

just thoughts,

oh, love...valentine's day....valentine's day is for people who don't know how to love...it is the yearly reminder to try....dinner dates are really just interviews where no one is being heard and the food is rarely enjoyed except amongst true friends...oh, the title is my reaction to the daily news, by the way....once a year, and once a year alone, men and women from around the world continue the hideous argument of responsibility, money and time, and if you really loved me, blah, blah, blah and shouldn't you blah, blah, blah, and maybe if i ask a total stranger about my mate, i'll get some insite into my mate....valentine's day, the time when a man who takes lovers secretly behind his girlfriends' back, takes her out and makes her pay half...valentine's day....the day your friends try to get in on your plans probably worse than any other time of year...valentine's day...the day the guy from out of town in the truck makes a u-turn in  your neighborhood and starts yelling at you to stop for him because he likes your hot bod in front of all of your neighbors and friends from church who are silent and staring as you try to ignore the crap that he is saying he likes....valentine's day....the time of year when people get really uptight or  rather, remain so, and think that red is the only appropriate color and buy something really ugly for their girl, and then get mad when they can see without her saying a thing, that yes, this is a tacky piece of shit...where is the receipt, dear?...valentine's day...when men around the world make a point of treating the women they date like unpaid prostitutes and then wish for thanks...valentine's day...kind of like thanksgiving....the day when people who forget about gratitude, remember that it is mostly just an idealism in their lives. :)

Subject: RE: [sfraves] [nrr] Re: [sfraves] Deciblast Forums broken by stupid admin

Broken by stupid admin? No one touched anything on the box between it
working and it being gone. I wasn't aware that db's just disappear in
mysql. I would figure ALL OF IT WOULD DISAPPEAR.

There's several exploits between Phpbb 2.0.3 and 2.0.4 (the latest
version).
The only db that was dropped was the forum...

My best guess was that someone got through the forums.

It's not a shared host.. this is a private server that halogen,
ravepictures, deciblast, hardcoreforthepeople, resistancerecordings, etc
are hosted on.

I'm sorry I upset a bigshot security man. Don't hurt me please.

Thanks,
Deepak

This leaked internal memo is interesting.  Forwarded from another list:

"Some of you may be interested to read this leaked internal Clear Channel
memo. Nothing mindblowing, just a good scoop of the pathetic,
ratings-frenzied, meticulously engineered, micromanaged content
manufacturing process behind corporate media."

It's comforting to know that once the monumental event of the US going 
to war again occurs, ClearChannel will be there to repackage other 
people's new reports for the airwaves.  I'm so excited!!!  Maybe one of 
us will get hired to make the "trendy, edgy techno music" to act as 
bumpers between soundbites!

Broken by stupid admin? No one touched anything on the box between it
working and it being gone. I wasn't aware that db's just disappear in
mysql. I would figure ALL OF IT WOULD DISAPPEAR.

There's several exploits between Phpbb 2.0.3 and 2.0.4 (the latest
version).
The only db that was dropped was the forum...

My best guess was that someone got through the forums.

It's not a shared host.. this is a private server that halogen,
ravepictures, deciblast, hardcoreforthepeople, resistancerecordings, etc
are hosted on.

I'm sorry I upset a bigshot security man. Don't hurt me please.

Thanks,
Deepak

Yeah, I imagine it's much more difficult to trigger an exploit that
would loop over all the available databases and drop them than it would
be to issue a single DROP statement.

> My best guess was that someone got through the forums.

What version of PHPBB are/were you guys running? You could pretty easily
find out at least the IP of whoever did it by taking a look at your
access logs -- the popular phpBB SQL injection exploit is usually
carried out with a perl script that uses a pretty distinct user-agent
string (though it'd be easy to change). If you keep a mysql log, you can
grep that for the last DROP statement and compare the timestamps.

The exploit: <http://tinyurl.com/5sw8>

My question is why does coolworld have to throw their most kickass parties 
that would really bring everyone to in the bay area, including the jaded 
people (I mean c'mon... RITM?  Electric Skychurch? Uberzone? Junkie XL!? 
Underworld?)  I would sell my soul for some time off and a plane ticket to 
finally be able to see RITM and Electric Skychurch, plus it would be awesome 
seeing the Streets.  I'd love to see Uberzone again...  I'd probably injure 
myself seeing Junkie XL though. Damn florida!

It's comforting to know that once the monumental event of the US going to 
war again occurs, ClearChannel will be there to repackage other people's new 
reports for the airwaves.  I'm so excited!!!  Maybe one of us will get hired 
to make the "trendy, edgy techno music" to act as bumpers between

i went to ultra last year, it was kind of weak, sure there were lots of huge
acts and it was outdoors and warm, but because of the number of acts people
like goldie had 30 minute sets, while other smaller names had 15 minute
sets.

so, i doubt you're missing much.

Subject: [sfraves] scott henry, jay-j, noel sanger, and other stuff :)

hello from dc, sf-ravers!  :)

fyi, i write a column about the rave scene for a regional paper called
music monthly (dc/maryland/virginia).  in case you're bored, here's wha=
t
ran in february (pre-edited).

your Jay-J is such a cool guy, peeps!  :)

much love and respect,
mary :)


SCOTT HENRY:  BACK TO THE FUTURE

      Once upon a time in a land far away there was an oasis of culture=

called Buzz. It began as a glint in the eyes of Baltimorean Scott Henry=
 who
channeled his love for a new type of music into building a home fit to
attract the finest and brightest creators of this music to perform thei=
r
feats of magic on thousands of people who gathered to dance Friday afte=
r
Friday for nine long years. Dark forces arose time and again to threate=
n
the peaceful revelers, and finally the darkness grew so great that a sh=
adow
fell over Buzz, until with pride but sadness it finally declared the pa=
rty
over. It was the end of an unsurpassed era of continuous world class
excellence. A candlelight vigil was held before the locked doors that h=
ad
once welcomed the faithful.
      Fortunately, Scott had had visions of expanding the dream, so tho=
ugh
the end of Buzz was unforeseen, when it came, Buzzlife Productions was
already working on new projects. Soon a new weekly began in Baltimore o=
n
Saturday nights at Redwood Trust.
      Music Monthly had the good fortune to connect with the itinerant,=

mercurial legend at a Thai restaurant in Georgetown one evening in late=

November.

Music Monthly:  What was it like for the Buzz Crew after announcing the=
 end
of Buzz at Nation?

Scott Henry:  Of course, we were all pretty sad, but we looked at it as=

more of an opportunity to move forward and try different things, and th=
at
maybe this happened for a reason. Those four walls may have been holdin=
g us
back. I felt bad because, not that we were providing a service, but we =
were
providing Washington, DC with some special fun times and now that that'=
s
gone, part of me feels a commitment to get something started again, but=
 the
right opportunity really hasn't arisen yet. It has to be from the right=

space, to working with the right people, right sound system, right ligh=
ts.
It's hard to come back and do something that's not up to what it was. M=
aybe
we're looking to go the route of being involved in owning a club. I'm
looking around. We're developing a community in Baltimore. We might
initially do a monthly party in DC to keep things rolling until we can =
come
up with a new club.
      Spundae (San Francisco) does things in 3 or 4 cities. We've learn=
ed a
lot from watching Spundae and how they went about going into different
markets. We want to do something once a month in different cities, and =
try
to help and develop a community, like we did here, maybe through each c=
ity
having its own Buzz message board, maybe with the sites linked. But to =
us
the community, and the presentation and production right now are what's=

most important. It's not as much any more about the super star DJ.   (
www.buzzlife.com)

MM:  Will you play at the Buzz parties in different cities?

SH:  I'm going to make it my priority to play as many as possible and I=
'm
trying to convince John Tab to as well. We've always tried to give peop=
le a
wide array of talent. I used to play Buzz every two months. The first p=
arty
in Chicago, at Zentra, February 1, will have DJ Rap, DJ Blame, RY-N, PN=
S,
Andre Harris, School 'n' Sheffield, and me. We were going to start with=

Dieselboy but he's in Moscow then. Joey Swanson, who was with XM (Satel=
lite
Radio), is moving back to Chicago to get back on alternative radio, and=
 our
night will actually broadcast on this station. Joey's our partner there=
. He
grew up in Chicago, knows Chicago, loves Chicago, and I think he'll be =
a
great person to work with. Joey's working on a couple of respected
well-liked Chicago house DJ's because Chicago's a house town. Buzz has
always been about encompassing all the different styles of music. We wa=
nt
to give Chicago what they know, but also maybe a little of what they do=
n't
know.

MM:  Do you see a change in the climate in which parties are being thro=
wn
in America?

SH:  I do. I think our interest in a new club situation in DC or wherev=
er
should be concentrated on looking at a mid-size space that accommodates=
 a
thousand people instead of two thousand people, because we are in a per=
iod
now when it's too hard to pack a super club. We were certainly fortunat=
e
that we were able to pull it off for as long as we did. We had to our
advantage that we created a community, in the strongest sense of the wo=
rd,
and we didn't charge ridiculous prices. We think the recession played a=
 big
part all across America [in the slowing down of the scene]. I don't thi=
nk
it hurt DC as much because we're a government town and so many people h=
ere
work for the government and their jobs were protected. But I think if w=
e
were to try to re-create that (Buzz), 2500 people, it would be a seriou=
s
uphill battle. Between the economy and people starting to realize that =
some
of the DJ's were getting paid this crazy amount of money, more than the=
y
make in a year, then they go, oh, so this is why it cost $30 to get in
tonight. I think people just got kind of turned off by that. With promo=
ters
complaining to agents, some DJ's are getting it and realize they have t=
o
bend with it. But there are other DJ's that say, I made this kind of mo=
ney,
if you don't want to pay it, don't book me. Those are the DJ's I think =
this
time next year who are not going to be around.

There's a lot to be said when we may have been targeted because we were=
 in
the media, people looked up to us, and our involvement against the RAVE=

Act. It's pretty sad when all we were doing was promoting this music th=
at
we love, and they want to take that away from us. There are civil liber=
ties
issues here that are astounding, sickening. I think if the average Amer=
ican
really knew what was going on, they might not like this music or what s=
ome
of the kids look like, but if they realized the government is basically=

trying to tell us what kind of music we can listen to, I think most
Americans would have a big problem with that. But the only way we can l=
et
them know what's going on is to have a more mainstream, or popular,
celebrity, like Madonna or Moby, say: This is screwed up. Then people w=
ill
listen. MTV's "Rock the Vote" expressed interest in getting behind this=
.
But the key is education and PR and getting America behind us. Hopefull=
y
we'll have the time to do it.

We had a meeting in New York about a month ago with several major booki=
ng
agents, a couple major promoters, PR people, management people. Really,=
 the
type of people you would never see sitting around the same table becaus=
e
they're all very fierce competitors and that's just the way it is. But =
we
realized that this could affect all our businesses and livelihoods and =
the
trickle down effect could be absolutely devastating to hundreds, thousa=
nds
of businesses. For electronic dance music, if there's no avenue to prom=
ote
this music, the music will disappear, along with the people who work fo=
r
the record labels, the distributors and sales people, the booking agent=
s,
the DJ's.

MM:  What are you most proud of looking back on Buzz in DC?

SH:  I'm proud of the people in the scene in DC, and on our end, I'm pr=
oud
of our longevity, more than anything. It's very hard and very rare for =
a
popular club to last more than a year, and we defied the odds.

METATRACK ON THE AIR

      February 4 marks lift-off for Metatrack Studios' new show "The
Launchpad" on XM Satellite Radio, announces Metatrack founder Juliette
Siegfried (DJ Zelda) and Luis Baro, producer of "The Move" channel.
      Music reviewers will find and present up and coming DJ's from acr=
oss
the U.S. in House (Dimitri Botbol, Adrian Collazo, Sheila Storms, Ivan
Smith aka Ivan G., Courtney Reyers aka Apple), Breaks (Charles Young ak=
a DJ
Smalls), Techno (Jambi Ganbar, Matt Poe aka The Technologist),
Trance/Progressive (Tony Carver aka DJ 621, Zach Fitzjarrell aka Xodus)=
,
Drum 'n' bass (Matt Rogers and Jeff Hancock aka Freefall), and
Downtempo/Experimental (Gil Yaker aka Gee Why, Lindsey Kistler aka Elka=
y,
Mike Reger). Genres will rotate weekly and will feature two one-hour se=
ts.
Congratulations!

NOEL SANGER
      There in his shout-outs for "Noel Sanger: Summerbreeze2" (Nettwer=
k
America) was a clear DC connection: Ben Camp, Brian Transeau (aka BT),
Sharam and Ali (aka Deep Dish). Sanger explains: "My DC ties run pretty=

deep, actually. I am originally from Virginia, about 2 hours from DC, n=
ear
Charlottesville, and my entire family lives there. I have lived in Flor=
ida
since I was 6 years old, but spent a huge amount of time over the years=

between the Blue Ridge and DC. I am signed as a producer to DC's MusicN=
ow
Recordings, the label that brought BT to the world back in the early '9=
0s.
In 2000 I actually tried to move to DC, but the real estate market was =
so
tight that we couldn't find anything in Northern Virginia. Houses were
renting 20 minutes after they came on the market. We were tired of Sout=
h
Florida and at that point settled on Orlando. In fact, the cover art fo=
r my
"Trance II" CD in 2000 was the DC Metro! Someone who deserves mention i=
s
DC's Holmes Ives. To me he is one of the hottest musicmakers in America=

right now and he keeps getting better. On 'Summerbreeze2' he appears un=
der
his Memnon and Oko Tek monikers. Brilliant stuff."

JAY-J!  JAY-J!
      LoveGrove aka LG Concannon, who hosted Grammy nominee Jay-J at So=
nar
on January 25, couldn't have been happier: "Jay-J was excellent. A supe=
r
nice guy. It was the first time he played the Baltimore/DC area, and we=

will be bringing him back for sure. It isn't uncommon for a great produ=
cer
to show up and be a sub-par DJ. Well, Jay-J is one of the best house
producers in the world, as his Grammy nomination (with Chris Lum for be=
st
remixed recording category for Jill Scott's "He Loves Me" (Illegal Remi=
x))
certainly proves, and he is one hell of a DJ. It is nice to see he is
getting the recognition he so rightly deserves."
      Said Jay-J, who is on his local NARAS committee in San Francisco:=

"When we sat down to do a listening I saw this track on there. Usually,=

over the last few years, the songs that are voted and that win are not
soulful songs. They're more of the aggressive remixes, a lot of the New=

York guys, or like Deep Dish who won last year, the harder edge stuff, =
so I
really didn't think anything of it. I voted for it but I mean, you know=
,
it's like, whatever. All of a sudden I got a call from Nikki, my public=
ist,
and she's like, Hey! I've got good news for you! It made that final rou=
nd
so we're really excited. I was on my way to the studio and as I was wal=
king
in she calls and she's giving me the news and I was just like, Wow! Tha=
t's
pretty cool! And Chris was in Australia and I knew with the time change=
 it
was really late or really early over there but I just had to call. I wo=
ke
him up and said, Hey, what's up! Are you up? Are you ready? Guess what?=

We're going to the Grammy's!" (laughs)
      How did his family react? "I went to college and have a degree in=

psychology and they were glad that I did that but all along they've alw=
ays
been supportive of the music. My Dad always said, 'You know, we'll be a=
t
the Grammy's some day.' I used to think, Oh yeah, right, I do House mus=
ic.
So he was the first person I called and the funny thing is that I rarel=
y
meet my Dad for lunch, but I was going to meet him for lunch that day. =
I
called and then realized, I don't want to tell him over the phone, so w=
hen
he called me back I was like, I'm just confirming for lunch. Then I wen=
t
down there (San Jose) and I said, Okay, you ready? He was like, Wow!
(laughs) So they're going to come to New York. I was born in New Jersey=
, my
parents were born and raised in New York, so we're going to back there =
and
have fun."
      Any reaction from Jill Scott? "I haven't spoken to her but I know=

that she really likes the remix. Chris and I saw her live and she does =
a
slow version earlier in the show and then later towards the end the dru=
mmer
starts playing a house beat, and we were like, Whoa! And she's goes int=
o
this little thing and says, 'Girl, I'll house you!' and she breaks into=
 the
'He Loves Me' remix. Chris and I, we LOVE her, and that's why it all ca=
me
about, and we just looked at each other and went, Oh my God! Dude! She'=
s
doing our version LIVE!"
At the end of his rollicking set, Jay-J handed out advance promos of hi=
s
new release "West Coast Sessions" (double-CD set with Miguel Migs at
Moulton Studios, SF, on Defected, UK), and the crowd, including DJ Cort=
ex
of DC Skillz, house diva Lady J and one of her dancers, Esperonto, chan=
ted
"Jay-J! Jay-J!" and "One more! One more!" House lovers in paradise. (Fl=

I beg, no- I demand to differ-

Part of sane security in the real world is the understanding that you *will* be
compromised.
End of story.
The entire architecture of an installation must be architected with
that in mind.
Minimization of damage, and a post remedy contingency plan are what you need to focus on.

I don't know the details of what was even in deciblast's forums, but
the "this backup overwrites yesterday's, oh and we don't check if
they're sane either" is not something that would fly with *my*
network-
But was is appropriate for forum content?
I don't know- that's not for me to decide.

Certain systems must be relied upon- I give the example of the latest
OpenSSH remote exploit.
"We" were compromised by this-
But due to all the other measures in place, there was NO interruption
of service and no data loss whatsoever.
That situation was unavoidable- ssh is needed for our operations.
The fact that we were compromised was not the fault of *anyone*.

I think the jungle thing has something to do with the popularity of trance.
I don't think very much trance was actually produced in the Bay during the
development of the SF d&b sound, but certainly there were tons of trance
parties. in general trance was hugely popular, and a lot of people
consequently hated it with a passion. (I'm embarassed to admit that I was
one of those people.) probably the SF jungle sound came as a reaction to the
uber-pretty sound of foo-foo trance, as I think, to a lesser extent, the
popularity of hard techno might have done as well.

disproportionate and refreshingly large women are wonderful, but all the
women involved at the creative level in the d&b scene in SF are, if I
recall correctly, both proportionate and reasonably sized.

for example, Sage.

mmm...Sage.








what were we talking about?

hold on - I think you might have misunderstood me. after all, when talking
about a place, you're dealing with something very subjective. I know someone
who has an astrology program that maps your birth chart across the planet.
when I used this, I found that it appeared to work (which is all you can
really ever say of astrology). what you feel in any given place may just be
a reflection of whatever energies are there for you.

I'm not actually saying SF is the land of the lotus-eaters...nor am I saying
I'd rush like a maniac into the middle of Mexico (or whatever random
location) expecting to find the latest and most brilliant new musical
development simply because I'd heard a rumor of police brutality there. I am
certainly prone to eccentric behavior, but even I am not that insane.

in Chicago house is the soundtrack to the gay world, the black world, and
the raver world, as well as many other worlds, like the swinging and bondage
scenes. these worlds are not as free in Chicago as they are in San Francisco
(where they simply fade into the background as one more spectacle to be seen
in the carnival).

I think the most disorienting experience I had, when I moved from Chicago's
suburbs to the city proper, was finding out that rap music was much more
popular among white kids in the suburbs than it was among black kids in the
city. in Chicago rap is the daytime music you can listen to at work. house
is the real party music.

however, I am not really qualified to speak on the role of any form of music
in communities of which I am not part...the most I can say on this is that
in San Francisco house plays a different role, and consequently takes a
different shape.

I can't say what the future will bring for SF house, but I wasn't dissing
it...Naked Music is a great label.

We trust in the motions of the universe, and watch the skies - or pay close
attention to those who do. The goat may indeed have diabolical plans up its
sleeve (assuming this is a goat who goes about clothed), but when all is
said and done, we are the ones with opposable thumbs.

The goat controls the day - but we control the night.

We may be tempted to flee the goat in a panic, or slaughter it in a vengeful
frenzy, but the wisest course is simply this:

Bring the goat some comfy earplugs and a nice bit of lettuce.

Pat it on the head, wish it good luck, and let it be.

Indeed! And enjoy it while you can.

Venus is in Capricorn now, but soon it moves into Aquarius - the sign of all
that is strange and brilliant.

Sure.  That doesn't mean you should use insecure products or not install 
the latest security patches.

they're important, but shouldn't be the focus.  day to day usability with

Bullshit.  While I wholly agree that SSH is necessary, no one is forcing 
you to use OpenSSH.

Naturally- I was speaking only from the security point of view-

I'm not sure what you mean- are you saying we should have been using
some *other* vendor's ssh implementation?
Or some other method of securly accessing our boxes?
See point "a)" above :)

I don't know if trance is really to blame, but I /do/ distinctly remember
seeing my first-ever candy raver at a Harmony Freaky People party
(december, 1996) - I think the DnB thing was ascendent around that time as
well, so maybe that had something to do with it?

It's all just so much conjecture, though. I wouldn't want to perform an
autopsy until I knew for certain the patient was dead, so give the rave
scene another month or two here. :)

I do believe I agree with your original post, though, Giles. At least in
the sense that it seeks to provide an explanation for why SF is such an
oddball place. I suspect that part of the culprit is the *reputation* this
city has, from the Barbary Coast through the Beats and Hippies on down,
this city is known for being a crazy bohemian town. This reputation is
both advantageous (it draws crazy bohemians here) and harmful (it draws
GODDAMN crazy bohemians here), and I think that it contributes to a
general vibe of us being "on display" for the rest of the world. Or maybe
I only think so because I just returned from Ascension at 1015, a crazy
bohemian event put on for the benefit of the legal survival of SF's
nightlife.

(Go, there's still time: http://www.sflnc.com/index/events/special/29.html)

I spent part of the evening knocked sideways by the sheer force of
artistic expression contained in that club, and the other part of the
night frustrated that it was really just a big play-act, a mini-
burningman-clone intended to make an impression on the city supervisors,
mayoral candidates, and other representatives of the SF establishment in
attendance. In a sense, it's something I think about a lot, as a member of
the SFLNC on one hand, and generally disenchanted raver who wonders
whether there's anything left to protect, preserve, or promote anymore on
the other.

Shit was real good here in SF when people throwing parties didn't give a
rat's ass what the government, or the media, or their parents, or the
neighbors thought about what we up to when we inexplicably took off for
entire nights or weekends, returning early sunday morning with a slightly
dazed grin and a hearing problem.

Perhaps the east bay looniez throwing tomorrow's Masquerade Di Valentino
will salvage things - I'm definitely going to give them a chance. :)

Even McMurdo Station in Antarctica!  Truly amazing how many compassionate 
souls there are out there...

As you know, some of us on sfraves have formed a group -- Ravers For Peace 
-- to represent at the march/rally this Sunday.  I'll have more details 
about our meeting place/time for the march tomorrow.  Hope some of you will 
join us.

Much love,

> voice to the anti-war majority as an assertion of real
> democracy.
> 
> 3)  Uproot the system behind the war (and behind the

> WHAT YOU CAN DO

> Form an affinity or action group to get prepared. Get
> a group of five to 25 of your friends, family,

A Global Antiwar Movement

By Ruth Rosen, AlterNet
February 13, 2003

Many of us will never forget when the people of the world welcomed the dawn=
=20
of the new millennium. As the Earth turned, we watched televised pictures=20
of people celebrating and cheering as the sky lit up with fireworks =AD from=
=20
Asia to Europe, from Africa to North America. And, for the first time in=20
human history, we understood, in a deeply visceral way, that we really do=20
inhabit the same planet and that we are, in fact, members of a global=
 society.

That is what's going to happen again on Saturday and Sunday. In 316 cities=
=20
in 60 countries =AD Cairo, Bangkok, Beirut, Jakarta, Prague, Budapest,=
 Tokyo,=20
Moscow, London, Cape Town, Kigali in Rwanda, Madrid, Warsaw, Kiev, Lisbon,=
=20
Mexico City, San Francisco.

Sao Paulo, New York, Sydney, Barcelona, to name but a few =AD more than a=20
million people are expected to march and rally against an American invasion=
=20
of Iraq. Even McMurdo Station in Antarctica will hold a protest against the=
=20
war. Such a global outpouring against the threat of war is unprecedented.

Without the Internet, of course, such a global protest would be=20
unimaginable. But the Internet is only the messenger. Clearly, there is=20
strong opposition here and abroad to an American invasion of Iraq.

What's truly surprising are the concise slogans posted on the Web sites of=
=20
the coalitions that have helped organize this protest. No America bashing.=
=20
No defense of Saddam Hussein. No solidarity with al Qaeda terrorists. In=20
dozens of languages, the message is simple and direct: "No war in Iraq."=20
"Stop the war in Iraq."

People around the world now feel a right to express their opposition to war.

They clearly believe Hussein is a ruthless dictator. But they also=20
understand that the greatest threat is terrorist attacks from elusive=20
networks that cannot be stopped by American bombs or U.N. weapons=20
inspections. The Bush administration, of course, will try to discredit this=
=20
global uprising against an American war with Iraq. But it won't be so easy.=
=20
The coalitions assembled in these cities include business, labor and=20
religious groups; veterans of former wars, environmentalists, human rights=
=20
activists and mothers against war; and thousands of ordinary people who are=
=20
asking the U.N. Security Council to pursue further weapons inspections in=20
Iraq, not war.

Expect a tiny band of adolescent anarchists, who would rather spray=20
graffiti and smash windows than join others in a peaceful march. We should=
=20
condemn such antics. There is nothing less persuasive than using violence=20
in the name of preventing war.

Why, you may ask, should you participate in this demonstration? Because you=
=20
are a citizen of a great nation that is violating its own democratic=20
ideals, treating the rest of the world with dismissive contempt and=20
refusing to be restrained by international law. Because you are a citizen=20
of a new global society. Globalization is about more than free trade. What=
=20
we are witnessing is the birth of a grassroots global democracy. To=20
emphasize our membership in this new global society, many protesters around=
=20
the world will be carrying the U.N. flag, a fitting symbol for a new era.

When people ask, as they eventually will, who stood up for human rights,=20
let your name be among those who opposed an unjust and unnecessary war.

Subject: [sfraves] any party recommendations for newbie (this weekend)?

Hiya folx- 

I have a dear friend who was curious about the scene,
and I promised to take her somewhere interesting this
weekend.  My problems are:  (1) I've been out of the
loop for almost 3 years now (no kidding), and (2) I
just resubbed to SFR yesterday, and have no idea when
the calendar gets sent.  Is it all exclusively on
Hyperreal now?  

In any event, does anyone have any thoughts on a
low-key fun little party either tonight or tomorrow? 
We're from Davis (near Sac), but can commute...
Something preferably with breaks or circa-92 style
techno, but I'm open to just about anything.  Can
anyone help me make some gal's first exposure to the
scene memorable?  Thanx a bunch - 

Joe

Subject: [sfraves] ATP: NRR: why is this now the news.alt.wartimehaters.sfraves mailing list?

I'll admit that I am the first to jump into a conversation about the war. 
Most of the time because it appears everyone is very one-sided, or atleast 
those that frequently post about this topic.

However, I was quite dissapointed to see every new message from last night 
being about this war.

Doesn't anyone have anything to comment besides the war on an SFraves 
mailing list?

I'll start; Anyone get a chance to hear me on KZSU yesterday?

ah, migurski, you misunderstand me too!

assume the seasons of "uber-scene"-hood vary on a roughly 7-year schedule
(as the mysterious anonymous wise man said in his post). I believe the
throne of San Francisco landed on the head of the rave scene in 1995, and
fell off in 2002.

but there was a rave scene in 1994 in San Francisco, and there is still one
now in 2003.

to quote an old Koma & Bones record, "underground will live forever baby,
never dying, always moving."

jaded.

has anyone else noticed the paradox that futuristic music lends itself so
easily to nostalgia?

yes. it was an urban nomad thing.

but this is another paradox, really. if the throne has passed on to some
other scene, this means that things for the rave scene in general in the bay
area are in fact looking up. media attention and city legal bullshit could
diminish. I personally believe the schism between undergrounds and massives
will become less significant and may even disappear completely.

I'm not saying raving in SF is doomed, therefore there's no point ever
coming back. I hope to come back, I hope to visit real soon. all I'm saying
is that the potential that was once there has diminshed considerably.

I think at one time the rave scene in SF was the single most remarkable and
exciting thing happening in the entire country. I'm just saying that this
may no longer be the case. so for me personally, it seems the only thing
left to do is make some nostalgic future music -- and that will be easier in
a less expensive place with more favorable astrological energies.

if any hope exists for the rave scene in san francisco, it rests in the
hands of the east bay loonies.

i have great faith in them -- altho I fear for their goat.

dude.

i should write dialogue for "star wars."

work with me one sec folks...

if "love" is an ideal relationship between two people,
then, does that mean when a DJ attempts to combine
two songs together to produce a greater synergy...
could that effect, when successful and beautiful 
to the listener... might that be thought of "love"- 
- between the songs??? hmmm....  
ponder that while you check out this special valentine!  
HINT: it is equiped with a "PLAY" button.  ;)

Subject: [sfraves] Friday I'm In Love (bsp)

GHETT $ET - Valentine's Day "Ghet Your Freak On"
Tonight's GHETT $ET is a very special one in three ways!

1) its Valentines Day!!! yeah, sure some of y'all will be
off with your significant others, going to dinner, and etc.,
but everybody else will be out and looking extra careful for
that once-a-year, extra-jiggy, mack-down that is all the
more likely with everybody getting blizted for that very reason!

2) I'm very excited have Domingo Yu as my guest DJ.
Domingo has DJed in Detroit for years and has traveled the world
representing its sounds and musical sensibilties.  Hinting
at a varied mix of "everything from  50 Cent to Shalamar
to Buju Banton to DJ Rolando" Domingo is for sure gonna REPRESENT!!!

3) This is the last Ghett $et to be held on Friday.
Starting next week, we're moving to Thursday, and I will be firing
up the mix right at 6 to get that straight from work energy.

TONIGHT We'll be going full on from 6-10.
Prepare for some extra juicy in ya boogie cuz its gonna be like that.  and by the way, its totally free!
Thats at Skylark, 3089 16th St. in the Mission, SF.

PEACE, Rob AKA DJ Baby Daddy

p.s. if you had trouble with that flash wrapper for my
special valentines day mix, try here...

I have a hat. :) But terry borrowed it so he could dress like Gilligan two

Not at all, given that the futuristic music we listen to has always been
created on yesterday's castoff machines: failed bass synthesizers
re-tooled to make squireelly gibbon noises, big clunky drum machines you
can take apart and tune with a screwdriver, and VINYL ferchrissakes. For
all its explicit future talk (which really amounts to UFO soundbites),
techno is some of the most explicitly backwards-looking music out there
right now. Not that I'm not totally in love with it or anything, but the
bulk of futuristic technology put into the service of musicmaking out
there is being used to warble Cher's voice and keep the Backstreet Boys in
tune.

Simple answer: They are all going to be at WMC and playing at a billion 
other parties so you save money on airfare,hotel and booking fee's..

But im sure most of those acts are still not very cheap.. But a hell of alot 
cheaper then flying half that lineup to CA and paying First class airfair 
and 5 star hotel plus limo rides.. And don't get me started on the Hookers 
and cocaine! You know how rock stars party ;)

I agree with this basic idea, but I am not sure it would work.  It would be great to get any undercover cops kicked out of clubs, but how do you know if they are cops or not?  I would never personally buy or sell drugs inside a club/party to strangers.  And I don't think anyone else should either (if you really need them, just buy them before hand).  I just have a hard time being a "snitch".   Unless that person was being a real ass-hole...or I KNEW it was a cop - of course if I knew I would then leave the party very discreetly...

Subject: [sfraves] RAVERS FOR PEACE

--=====================_12935197==_.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed


This may be our last chance to demonstrate to the world and the Bush 
administration our opposition  to this immoral war, so let's make sure we 
get our bodies on the line this Sunday -- rain or shine:)

Sfravers have formed a group to represent in the march and rally:  Ravers 
for Peace.  We have prepared a large banner (DJ Disconnect designed the 
lettering), with your brothers and sisters working on painting this banner 
and signs for many hours.  We have also obtained some art through Jeff 
Storey  for "Drop Beats, Not Bombs" signs and Philip Diaz and some sfravers 
will be screening these tonight.

We hope those of you on this list who share our beliefs will join us on 
Sunday to march in solidarity.

MEETING TIME/PLACE ON SUNDAY

The rally and march begin around 11:00 AM at Justin Herman Plaza at the end 
of Market Street.  We should plan to gather there around 10:30 on at the 
fountain on the left hand side of the Plaza as you enter from Market Street 
(that's where the skateboard kids often do their thing.)  Look for the 
Ravers For Peace banner and signs.   Also, since we cannot have a truck 
with sound, bring drums, musical instruments, hell, boom boxes if you can 
carry them so we can march to some rhythm.

Be sure to leave early.  Last time public transportation was overwhelmed by 
the large number of marchers, and this promises to be an even larger event.

Looking forward to seeing you all Sunday!!!!

Much love,

Apollo

That was when we were a counterculture:)  In the early nineties "raving" 
was defined by uncomfortable "agitator" types who were really interested in 
creating some mind-opening, transformative experiences.  Many of those 
folks thought raving was over before 1995 -- the Wicked FMRs were over by 
then, as were many of the uninhibited parties, both underground and in clubs.

I think, as someone suggested on this topic, that the late nineties were 
just too fuckin' comfortable around here.  People believing they could make 
a million before thirty;  entrepreneurs entering the underground and 
bringing it mainstream -- just not enough energizing discontent, I think.

Now we are back to "balls to the wall" days.  As the Chinese say, we have 
been cursed with need to live in interesting times once again.

I have said before that there are parallels between the gay subculture and 
the rave counterculture.  Both experienced co option in the late 
nineties.  For gays, materialism replaced creativity;  the desire for 
integration overwhelmed the need to build a unique culture;  corporate 
types replaced activists, and the gay pride parade became one big beer 
commercial, IMHO.  Prada shoes, pec implants, commodification of 
desire:  horrible.

Now there is a group called Gay Shame.  They are very similar to the people 
I knew in Queer Nation and Act Up in the early nineties.  At a black tie 
affair recently for the new Community center, attended by the politically 
powerful and Range Rover queens, these queers crashed the party and were 
arrested.  Ah...fresh, sweaty, agitators back.

Fine.  I'm with them.  I'm personally tired of attempting to appear 
"responsible" to people I don't respect, who hate me -- and who would put 
me in jail no matter how conventional I try to appear.

Same with raves.  Perhaps it's time for a "Ravers Shame" group.  A healthy 
society needs a dialectic:  a counterculture.  We were and can be that 
counterpoint.

Love,

au contraire mon frere...the most sophisticated technology used in the
service of musicmaking is, of course, a borderline criminal technology which
operates for the betterment of mankind...

it's called Gnutella...

as for the trend to using antiquated machinery...when the 303 acid line was
invented it was a bold repurposing of technology...similar to the techniques
developed in mid-90s jungle, reinventing the sampler as a complete studio in
a box...still, you've definitely got a point...

well...again this is not a community I'm really qualified to speak on at any
great length...but I can certainly see the humor, and maybe even the wisdom,
of a group called Gay Shame...certainly there is something almost wickedly
clever there...

anyway...

raving does have a countercultural component...that is undeniable...some of
the most brilliant moments of rave music are the moments of ostranenie...a
Russian word meaning the process by which a true artist can make you see how
strange some of the things we accept as normal truly are...sampling even the
announcements on the subway...so that you find yourself underground on a
train and thinking, this is good...but I prefer the remix...social fictions
collapse...you glimpse the truth of your life...and in that moment you
realize what you want to do...there is tremendous power there...

and if raving seems mainstream in San Francisco...with all the boredom and
lameness that implies...just remember that everywhere else in the
country...it is so inimical to the powers that be that they have actually
attempted to pass laws against not only the gatherings but the music
itself...

 I think it's interesting that nobodys ever really touched on some of the fundamental reasons this scene has demised. 

 Apollo touches on it in his response, but i think there is another point that needs to be made and i'm sure i'll probably catch some enemies here, but so be it.

 back in the 80's and 90's it was trendy to be in a band, everybody was in a band and had a brother in a band, etc. then hip hop came to surface and everybody became a rapper.

 if your band sucked or your rapping skills were less then par YOU KNEW BETTER not to even try to entertain people. You most certainly could NOT get a gig and people would probably boo your ass off in a heart beat if they thought you were wack!

 when you go to a hip hop show, if the performer is bootsy, they get boo'ed! very rude and loud sometimes.

 which is the exact opposite of the rave scene. Everybody is now a DJ now. I mean every tom dick and harry, boys and girls are all DJ's.

 however, only %25 of all you DJ's can actually mix records. The rest of you cant. Plain and simple. Yet, you take gigs, sometimes even asking to get paid.

 how the hell do you get paid to spin records when you cant even mix? i can name a slew of local bay area dj's, some who have even owned record stores. Simply cannot connect the beats.

which makes it confusing when someones train wrecking and the crowd is so high they dont care (ok so i'm sharing my experiance at hotel trance when thomas was playing), they just keep screaming and dancing.

 which brings me to my next point. Inflation and Economics. Local DJ's should NOT CHARGE local promoters to play, and if so it be extremly cheap or just for expenses ie; gas, food, party favors, etc.

 how the heck are you supposed to create a low ticket party when everyone wants to get paid hella money. it's ridiculous. 

  why should mars and mystre or tom and jason charge $5,6,7,8,9,1000 plus dollars to play at a local gig? and why would you pay for them that much to play anyways?

   when i starting raving days ago, we had real talent on a day to day bassis visiting SF and playing at almost every party. From Johnny Fiasco to Frankie Bones, we had real talent back then.

 now you have all these kiddies booking all these EXPENSIVE local dj's who arent even worth the money there getting paid instead of the likes of Derrick Carter, Juan Atkins, DJ Icey, Sandra Collins, Evil Eddie Richards, Mistress Barbara, and Doc Martin.

  promoters need to stop supporting the rise of local talent fees. Dont book these kats if there not going to play for free or reasonable prices. It doesnt make since. Most of these local DJ's are still learning and do not desrve to get paid much less play.

  i dont mean to sound harsh on local talent cause i know theres allot of it here in san francisco. I've seen Jim Hopkins, jeno, tony, and garth. These guys didnt just jump on the decks over night and they certainly didnt start charging $1000 from the start.

  i think the inflation in booking fees in conjunction that everybody is a dj has really created a shadow on this phenomenon overall and has definitly taken the luster off of something that i cherished for so long.

  now a days were lucky if we have a party at all every weekend and most of the parties are not even worth the $15 bucks there charging.

  i've been pushed into clubs in order to hear or see anything worth leaving my house. I'm sure most of us on this list dont really like clubs all that much because of the enviroment they create = meat markets.

  this seems to be the common flaw if you ask me. just go to your local record store and pick up a flyer.

just my .50 cents

the moss factor

That was when we were a counterculture:)  In the early nineties 
"raving" 
was defined by uncomfortable "agitator" types who were really 
interested in 
creating some mind-opening, transformative experiences.  Many of those 
folks thought raving was over before 1995 -- the Wicked FMRs were over 
by 
then, as were many of the uninhibited parties, both underground and in 
clubs.

I think, as someone suggested on this topic, that the late nineties 
were 
just too fuckin' comfortable around here.  People believing they could 
make 
a million before thirty;  entrepreneurs entering the underground and 
bringing it mainstream -- just not enough energizing discontent, I 
think.

Now we are back to "balls to the wall" days.  As the Chinese say, we 
have 
been cursed with need to live in interesting times once again.

I have said before that there are parallels between the gay subculture 
and 
the rave counterculture.  Both experienced co option in the late 
nineties.  For gays, materialism replaced creativity;  the desire for 
integration overwhelmed the need to build a unique culture;  corporate 
types replaced activists, and the gay pride parade became one big beer 
commercial, IMHO.  Prada shoes, pec implants, commodification of 
desire:  horrible.

Now there is a group called Gay Shame.  They are very similar to the 
people 
I knew in Queer Nation and Act Up in the early nineties.  At a black 
tie 
affair recently for the new Community center, attended by the 
politically 
powerful and Range Rover queens, these queers crashed the party and 
were 
arrested.  Ah...fresh, sweaty, agitators back.

Fine.  I'm with them.  I'm personally tired of attempting to appear 
"responsible" to people I don't respect, who hate me -- and who would 
put 
me in jail no matter how conventional I try to appear.

Same with raves.  Perhaps it's time for a "Ravers Shame" group.  A 
healthy 
society needs a dialectic:  a counterculture.  We were and can be that 
counterpoint.

Love,

Apollo

Agreed, this was a fantastic party. Even having to stand in line for 40
minutes was worth it. It also made me appreciate what a great club
space 1015 really is. Too bad it draws such an uninspiring crowd most of
the time.

This is certainly true of gay communities in the heartland.  I have felt 
safe until recently in San Francisco.  But local authorities cannot stop 
the feds, even though I believe some of them would like to.

Unfortunately, the hobnailed jackboots of the DEA are pounding the floors 
of clubs and parties here with the intention of shutting us all 
down.  Further, they have ignored states' rights by overriding the peoples' 
medical marijuana legislation.   Conservatives, they call themselves.  Not 
by any definition I've ever heard.  These folks are fascists.

Love,

Subject: [sfraves] Dancing Styles as a Political Metaphor?

so i was thinking about how raves are litterally split up into "rooms" for 
different styles of music and dancing, and somehow it came to me that these 
styles of dance kind of mimick different types of political philosophies. 


House music and break beat dancers are kind of like Capitalists in a sense 
that they form elete circles where only the best, most aggressive dancers are 
given space to dance, in which they will either fail and embarress themselves 
or they will really impress their peers and recieve "props".


Techno and Trance music dancers are more like Socialists because they all 
have equal spaces to dance in, in any way they like to dance, and no one 
dancer is given credit for being "better" than any other dancer (even though 
realistically some people are obviously "better" than others in skill & 
rhythm.)

Junglist and hardcore music dancers are kind of like a metaphor of Anarchy to 
me because they don't stay in one place, there is some type of "props" given 
out to good dancers but in this case the definition of "good" is more like 
crazy or out of control and sometimes just plain pissed off (but with some 
sense of rhythm at the same time.)

So i'm not saying these discription fit each group to a tee! or that there is 
anything wrong with any one of these groups, but u get the picture? Having 
all three rooms in a party is just awsome and it shows that a highly evolved, 
eclectic, diverse group of people are behind the scenes making these events 
happen... Anyone agree with me here? - johnny bzzzz

Subject: [sfraves] Re: Dancing Styles as a Political Metaphor?

and remember in House and Break beat circles one must often face a competitor 
head to head or multiple competitors (kind of like Capitalism...)

in a Techno or Trance dance floor everyone is on your side and equal to you 
(ideally...but rarely achieved in full, which is the big problem with 
socialism)

on a jungle or hardcore dancefloor, limbs are flying about everywhere, the 
music and vibe can be overwhelming and almost "frenzied" and it's basically a 
free for all (Anarchy)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] RAVERS 4 PEACE- What BART station close?

Does anybody know what BART station is closest to the
Justin Herman Plaza, or what cross street on Market is
closest so I can go to the BART web page and find it
myself? I found an article that says they are
extending BART service to help people get to the
march, but I didn't see them mention what station one
needs to disembark at. If I can find my way there on
BART, I'll for sure be there!

Thanks, 
Penny

I believe it is Embarcadero.

If anyone has props or big signs and needs a ride I can volunteer. If you
want to move stuff to this side of the Bay I can help today after 7pm.

Does anybody know what BART station is closest to the
Justin Herman Plaza, or what cross street on Market is
closest so I can go to the BART web page and find it
myself? I found an article that says they are
extending BART service to help people get to the
march, but I didn't see them mention what station one
needs to disembark at. If I can find my way there on
BART, I'll for sure be there!

Thanks,
Penny

Pooh is a communist
Christopher Robin is hitler
Piglet is a Nazi SS Officer
And the Gopher is mocking the Jews
The Rabbit is Mussolini (The only one to take care of his own shit)
Tigger is China, always real happy, and not caring what that happiness =
costs others.
The Owl is the U.N, mostly blind, and prefers to talk more than act.
Kanga is the Motherland, giving birth to the "Perfect" future (Roo)
And Eeyore is the economy; everyone is losing their tail and their house =
is always falling down
And the Hephalumps and Woozles are Western Civilization
That Hitler and Stalin (communism) were always afraid of
And The 100 Acre wood is the Free World



PS: This was a group conversation at my work that turned into this. None =
of it is meant to be offensive etc etc..

The odd thing is, it makes a twisted sort of sense...

there's not even anything worthy of a mild mocking here....base level thought and no one really knows where the party is....:) :) :) happy day to you....survey for the interested...okay to reply privately if you are afraid of the wierdos and such...no guarantee of a response or an ear though :) should i buy the tiny, pink, shiney thing with the garters on them or not? probably yes...i shouldn't be so insecure, you know? i like dressing really taudry in several ways...there's sophistication, and then there is outright perversion. so, anyway, gotta shop and digest and such.happy day to you...really, i really, really mean that. :)

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: My sign slogan for the march:   "READ OUR LIPS!"

I just thought of that this morning ... I was thinking about how everyone has 
such great signs, and to just say "Listen to all of us!", that's what I want 
to get across.  And, um, also remembering how "Read My Lips", thrown back 
into the elder Mr. Bush's face, was one of the slogans that helped bring him 
down in 1992. 

a quick side note: if you want to see a great movie (an Academy Award winner) 
with a lot of relevance to totay's world, check out "Hearts and Minds." It's 
about Vietnam: what we were doing there and what it did to us and others. 
Invading Iraq might just be the beginning of a terrible saga I would not want 
to see repeated. 

ok ... I hope to see a lot of you cool people at Wish ... Have fun ... Be 
safe ... Be happy that we can party -- a lot of people can't. 
See you also at the march on Sunday. This includes those of you who want to 
show support for the war; you should represent too.  
Take care -- 
John in Berkeley

Subject: [sfraves] RAVERS FOR PEACE:  Tomorrow

--=====================_438821==_.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed


This may be our last chance to demonstrate to the world and the Bush 
administration our opposition to this immoral war, so let's make sure we 
get our bodies on the line tomorrow -- rain or shine:)

We hope those of you on this list who share our beliefs will join us on 
Sunday to march in solidarity.

MEETING TIME/PLACE ON SUNDAY

The rally and march begin around 11:00 AM at Justin Herman Plaza at the end 
of Market Street.  We should plan to gather there around 10:30 on at the 
fountain on the left hand side of the Plaza as you enter from Market Street 
(that's where the skateboard kids often do their thing.)  Look for the 
Ravers For Peace banner and "Drop Beats Not Bombs" signs.   Also, since we 
cannot have a truck with sound, bring drums, musical instruments, hell, 
boom boxes if you can carry them so we can march to some rhythm.

Be sure to leave early.  Last time public transportation was overwhelmed by 
the large number of marchers, and this promises to be an even larger event.

Looking forward to seeing you all tomorrow!!!

Much love,

Apollo

just in case you didn't know it, the chinese new year parade took place last night in san francisco...there was a fatty fat crowd, and it poured rain. most of the revelers arrived before the rain, so they were kind of stuck, i supposed....wasn't there...just know about...there's a peace march too in downtown s.f. today, just in case you forgot or didn't know...something to do...please don't drop your banana peels or cans on the ground...give peace a chance....i am pretty darned irresistable, i am finding...that doesn't mean that people agree whether or not i am actually approachable or not...that is actually all timing. ;)

Subject: [sfraves] ESC live set from M.D.V.


Hi!

Wow, the masquerade de valentino was a lot of fun!  DDR and Praxis tore
shit up live, and the dj's were rockin it as well.  I only caught a few
minutes of RAW, because there was very little oxygen in that jungle
room.  MUST BREATHE!

I had a great time, even though the goat did not make it...  =(  There
goes my theory...  oh well..

I encoded and uploaded my live set.  It's in the usual place:
http://typhoon.enabled.com/~esc/

Would love to get some feedback from the techno fans out there!

Subject: [sfraves] Nightclub bouncers chain doors shut, mace crowd, 21 dead in panic...

http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/Midwest/02/17/chicago.nightclub/index.html

http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/2771641.stm

Yikes!

This really makes me think of some of the places I've partied, where if a fire
had gotten started, we'd all have been soooo fucked!  Not all THAT many, but
the ones that were bad were REALLY bad.

It's kinda scary, actually, when I think about how I've not really thought
about that myself.  When I get to a party at a new venue, usually the first
thing I do is explore a bit...  Find out where the bathrooms are, where they're
selling water, if they have Red Bull or the like in addition to water, look for
booths from any non-profits that are in attendance, etc.  I'm USED to thinking
about all that.  But I'm just so used to buildings NOT burning down, that I
can't recall haveing actually intently scoped out the fire exits (if any...
they're absent in some cases).

That bouncer types would chain the fire exits shut, in preperation an assault
with pepper spray and mace against their customers, is just extra super
loathesome.  Damn... either one is just plain stupid by itself.  Plain old
common sence says that mace, used in a crowd, is going to hit a lot of
bystanders, and cause people to scatter.  And locking the fire exits... does
that even NEED comment?  The two together is more contemptable by orders of
magnitude!  Hell, and I thought my opinion of, and respect for, those people
was low BEFORE today...

Well, I know ONE thing that's now added to my list of things to look for when
exploreing a new venue...


cya,
john

A Day Late, but Not a Marcher Short, in San Francisco
By DEAN E. MURPHY

AN FRANCISCO, Feb. 16 =97 Some people were concerned that the protest
here today would be forgotten, coming as it did the day after
millions of people attended peace rallies around the world.

They need not have worried. The demonstrations on Saturday were like
a big pregame pep rally for peace activists from the San Francisco
Bay Area.

At least 150,000 people marched through the city's financial
district, chanted antiwar slogans and listened to John Lennon's
"Imagine" sung in Arabic. The afternoon of dissent was the largest
antiwar demonstration in San Francisco since the protests against
possible military action in Iraq began last fall.

"We are here to stop this war," the actor Danny Glover shouted from a
stage at Civic Center Plaza.

Another speaker, Rabbi Stephen Pearce of Temple Emanu-El in San
Francisco, said the protesters were delivering an important message
to President Bush and Congress.

"We will not send our sons and daughters to war," Rabbi Pearce said.
"We will not turn our sons and daughters into mortar."

By late in the afternoon, when the demonstration was coming to an
end, the police estimated the crowd at 150,000 to 200,000. At the
same time, organizers, who had volunteers atop buildings videotaping
marchers on Market Street, suggested that the number was closer to
250,000.

The crowds gathering at a staging area near the waterfront grew so
large so quickly that some people began walking toward Civic Center
Plaza more than an hour before the scheduled start. There was simply
no more room at the staging area.

"It is was so wonderful to see the turnout in Europe and New York,"
said Miriam Hutchins, 59, a teacher from Petaluma, Calif. Ms.
Hutchins said she had marched with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King
Jr. in Detroit in 1963 and had attended Vietnam War protests in
Berkeley, Calif.

"This voice is coming from the planet," Ms. Hutchins said. "It
started in Melbourne and is growing around the globe. Now it is San
Francisco's turn."

Originally scheduled for Saturday, the rally was put off until today
to avoid conflicting with a Chinese New Year celebration. While the
change did not dampen enthusiasm, it did create some confusion.

Mike Lamson of Alameda, Calif., and other protesters showed up
downtown on Saturday expecting a peace rally, not a New Year's
parade. Mr. Lamson, 33, said he and his wife, Nicole, and daughter,
Sarah, spent a day sightseeing while waiting for the march today.

"I am honestly not sure how much it does to stop a war, but at the
very least it makes you feel like you are speaking your voice," he
said.

The police said the demonstration was mostly peaceful until a group
of about 500 people broke off late in the day, setting several fires
and vandalizing at least one store. Several arrests were made, the
police said, but no details were available.

For some people here, the biggest worry was not over rowdy peace
advocates but terrorism. Mr. Lamson said he had a few anxious minutes
on the subway as it sped through a tunnel beneath the San Francisco
Bay. Since the code orange terror alert, security has been heightened
at bridges and tunnels.

But the fear of terrorism, Mr. Lamson said, made getting to the
protest all the more important.

"That is one of the most convincing arguments of the antiwar
movement," he said. "An attack on Iraq will stimulate terrorism
against the United States."

Joan Buell, 77, of Cupertino, Calif., also had terrorism on her mind.
She said she was moved by "genuine fear" to attend this, her first
peace rally. Though she questioned how much protests influenced
decisions in Washington, she said she could no longer sit quietly on
the sidelines.

"I am scared, and I'm not kidding," Ms. Buell said of a possible war
with Iraq. "I think the consequence is going to be World War III, and
I am very depressed about it."

Michael N. Nagler, the founder and former chairman of the Peace and
Conflict Studies Department at the University of California, said the
protest could have significance, not in changing Mr. Bush's mind but
in reaching out to potential terrorists.

"This is going to penetrate the consciousness of some of the people
who hate us and make it harder to stereotype us," Professor Nagler
said. "A key element in nonviolent struggles is risk. When you are
willing to take a risk it has a strong emotional impact on the other
party."

Subject: [sfraves] Coachella, again...

Yeah, yeah, I know it's a SoCal event, but I met even more people at
Spundae's 10th who said they're going... Anyway, for those who need more
enticement for an April road trip to the desert, the following are verified
by the LA Times.. Official announcements should come out sometime this week:

Underworld
Groove Armada
Darren Emerson
Timo Maas
Richie Hawtin
Fischerspooner
Ladytron
Felix da Housecat
Kinky
Thievery Corporation
Dirty Vegas

After-partying each night takes place at all the local hotels... The Best
Western is supposed to be the place to be. I might just bring my decks this
year :)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] ESC live set from M.D.V.

Hey hey all,

This was one cool  little shindig. Cozy venue and great peeps having a good 
time. DDR and Praxis were awsome but dont sell yourself short Mr. ESC you 
were bangin it too. I may be a total househead but  sheeeit if I dont 
appreciate some banging techno as well when it is done right. Richard 
Summerhayes did some proper schoolin on the on the techno tip as well 
especially since he mostly plays house.  Rob bliss was tearing it up in the 
d&b room but I didnt catch much else in there. The house room was bumping 
all night  and Hector from primal closed out that room quite nicely. great 
vibe all night and it was super cool seeing the old school  MW Trust posse 
in full effect, you folks sure have been missed! This party definately took 
me back a decade or so,jeez has it been that long?

my .02,

DJMC

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Dancing Styles as a Political Metaphor?

i agree with you. its nice when you're out a party to
sample one room, then for a different change of pace
to go into another and experience a whole different
atmosphere and vibe. i myself am ecletic when it comes
to edm, and its nice to experience it all in one
night.

Deepak,

Try checking out Harmony-Central.com - they have ALL sorts of information o=
n
software, interfaces, etc... and links to demos/downloads and all that.

Currently, I use Reason as my primary synth package (hey, it's easy and
works pretty well, even though it's not the most pro thing out there), and
have been doing my multitracking with the rather shabby Deck 3.5... I
purchased eMagic's Logic Audio recently, which is =FCber-powerful, but becaus=
e
of its steep learning curve, I haven't started to use it yet...

I believe the standard for multitracking is probably ProTools or CuBase. As
for synths, there's all sorts of stuff from BitHeadz and Propellerhead that
are status quo on the Mac.  Then there's all the VST stuff, as well as
"Audio Units," Apple's new VST-type scheme that so far is supported by
Logic..

If you go to Apple's web site, you can get an overview of what's out there,

http://www.apple.com/creative/musicaudio/

but be mindful of the Logic bias, since they recently purchased eMagic. :)

Good luck...

Personally I still use Opcode Studio Vision. I love that program. Logic is
just convoluded in my opinion. Cubase was a wannabe Vision product that just
never cut it for me. Unfortunately Opcode is dead thanks to that little
buyout that happened. Gibson bought and killed them as I recall. To think
that OMS is still out there and in use to this day, but the company is long
dead.

Most of the production that I hear of is done on Emagic Logic. I would say
it's in your best interest to learn the program because it has become the
studio standard. Synth wise you can do the vanilla Reason thing, but I'm not
impressed. External gear still wins.

I personally use or have used all of the sequencers mentioned so far, and
I do miss Vision.  There were some things you could do in the track window
that you still can't do to this day in
logic/cubase/digitalperformer/reason/whatever...

Lately I've been using cubase SX a lot with an athlon machine I built.

As a side note, Reason does have it's advantages...  I use reason
primarily for collaboration with other people that have vastly different
studios, or music platforms.  It's super easy to pack up a track and have
it play correctly on a totally new machine.  Even going mac <> pc works
flawlessly.

Also, you can work in reason and when you're ready for final mixdown, just
re-wire it into you're favorite DAW and you can get a better quality mix
out of it.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] mac audio software

Has anyone managed to control a machine running Reason with an external
sequencer? I sequence on a mac. I've never liked sequencing on a pc. Don't
ask why, it's just a preference. Anyway - Reason is something that I would
use more if the damn thing would work as an extrenal synth. Everytime I
tried to get the Reason box to listen to the midi being thrown at it nothing
would happen. Using the midi port on an SB Audigy for the Reason machine.
This is why I like the Mac for midi. It just *works* with no BS. I love my
pc, but midi fucks itself hard on it!

I personally use or have used all of the sequencers mentioned so far, and
I do miss Vision.  There were some things you could do in the track window
that you still can't do to this day in
logic/cubase/digitalperformer/reason/whatever...

Lately I've been using cubase SX a lot with an athlon machine I built.

As a side note, Reason does have it's advantages...  I use reason
primarily for collaboration with other people that have vastly different
studios, or music platforms.  It's super easy to pack up a track and have
it play correctly on a totally new machine.  Even going mac <> pc works
flawlessly.

Also, you can work in reason and when you're ready for final mixdown, just
re-wire it into you're favorite DAW and you can get a better quality mix
out of it.

Subject: [sfraves] Candy Kid Masculinity?

Hey Ya'll,
 Is there a candy kid masculinity, or does gender not matter at all?
Masculinity as defined as a set of codes or expectations of how a male is 
expected to act (i.e., No Sissy Stuff, Rambo...) I'm looking to get some 
responses on this listserv after surveying the NM rave listserv to see if 
there were any comparisions.

When I was candy a few years ago (I'm 32 now) I thought of us candy kids as 
ambiguous persons, sexually at least, but not in terms of gender: I could 
tell who was male or female or whatever.

I felt that the Club Kids were more androgonous in terms of gender.

BTW my doctoral dissertation demonstrates the creative interplay between 
the dancing male body and rave trance dance in the cultural context of the 
Albuquerque, New Mexico's rave scene. I find that raves provide boys and 
men a safe, shared space to explore alternative enactments of masculinity, 
such as male femininity (a term I developed in tandem with Judith 
Halberstam's female masculinity) partly due to the lack of homophobic 
harrassment.

Hey,

Anyone have any ideas as to why Outlook Express 6 removes all access to
attachments? I keep getting errors that the attachments are unsafe???? How's
that?

Any thoughts would be appreciated.

i'm not and nor have i ever been in my entire life seeking out the attention of someone who is totally insensitive or worse.....just the same, i am aware, and also, i know that in the most unhealthy sense, someone thinks they are having or continuing some sort of a relationship...i stopped signing love on e-mails for the most part, because enough people have presumed that when you sign love on your e-mail that you mean to want sex or something along those lines from them....eye contact can mean that to some too....i just try to keep away from it all, but there's so much to keep away from...just feel like writing today and sharing....i am soooooooooooo glad that valentine's season is pretty much over...now, there is some lingering shiiiiiii....ttttt (past your sensors, sucker)....for example, sometimes i can't go and buy a less than $2.00 box of rice without getting yelled at, and nothing good was being yelled, by the way, but it did sort of have to do with men, women and my sex and potential sexual orientation, but i couldn't possibly just be going to get my friggin mutha fugg'in lunch....but, that was yesterday and today is today, afterall.  now, i noticed that some people have to be taught that treating people well feels good, because they are basically mean, so they have to be taught that...then, there is the trouble of learning who it is okay to be nice to, because, really, it is not okay usually, and if it is, how long is it okay to be nice and who is it okay to be nice to for more than one full minute? and is there any escape from the bad parts, because, i don't drink or do drugs when i'm out , but let me tell you something, i don't know about you, but when i go out, it takes me a long, long time to recover from the bullshit parts, and i am not the type of person to start anything..i pretty much try to plan ahead for even the most minute complications, including saying hello accidentally to the wrong person, or even just having the wrong person even know i am alive...now, i understand right now, that could be happening too, but also, it could be too late...i could already be dead right now, and then, basically, you lose, sucker. :)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Candy Kid Masculinity?

I think if you're gonna do something useful in life, it shouldn't be
figuring out if candy kids can be masculine, but  a)  preventing kids liking
shitty trance (good trance is ok), b) making sure tacky people don't become
candy kids because then it's really fucking ugly, c) helping me find acid,
d) mescaline too plz, e) hehe, look at the letter, f) making clubs lower the
price of drinks!

If there's one culture we will never learn a single thing from, it's candy
kid culture.  For one thing, true happy candy kids are so outnumbered by
suck candy kids that it's not even a culture anymore, just a mash of plastic
unhappiness.  Most people if they ever choose to go candy are only candy for
like 6 months, then they realize how ghey they look.

love always

Subject: Re: [sfraves] mac audio software

Hmmmm,

Plenty of great choices out there. I really have been getting lots of miles 
out of logic lately with reason as a scratch pad for ideas. You might also 
want to check out digital performer from motu, or perhaps ableton live which 
is quite nice. If you have the bux to spend try checking out pro tools, they 
have a new entry level system the digi 02 I believe its called but you may 
outgrow it quickly depending on your needs. in the soft synth/ sampler arena 
most everything out there is cross platform so there are many options, I 
find myself using absynth a bunch. The fm 7 from native insts. is dope as 
well as the pro 53. logic comes bundled with some good soft synths also. 
motu has a really interesting new software sampler coming out soon the mach 
5 and if you really want to get freaky check out kantos by antares but be 
careful it is a total memory hog. i really recomend spending a few bux and 
get a subscription to keyboard mag, eq, or remix for decent tips and product 
reviews  they are great resources.

happy hunting,

DJMC

lol, yeah right; that's useful in life figuring out those items you listed

I want to give back to the rave community what I felt I learned from the 
experience now that I view it from an outsider perspective. I happen to 
think that candy kid playfulness is a great model for allternative 
masculinities...

Subject: [sfraves] New mix online :)

Hey all...

Well, today is my friend's birthday and I wanted to do something special for
her, so I mixed a set (roughly one hour) of all the type of stuff she likes
- funky house a la Groove Armada & Naked Music stuff - so if you're into
that kind of thang, feel free to check it out...  The set will be looping
all day.

If your browser is set to automatically throw a playlist at your MP3 player,
point it to http://listen.radio1328.com

If you want to launch the stream directly from your player, point it at
http://live365.com/play/229783

And finally, if neither of those work, you can go to Live 365 and follow
whatever Play instructions they have there.
http://live365.com/stations/229783

AOL users may have problems due to their web caching, so you might just hear
a Live365 commercial over & over. Ugh.

Enjoy :)

Subject: [sfraves] just get Reason and Acid

I sold all my outboard gear and replaced it with Reason and Acid. I'm pretty
happy with that decision.

Reason is an excellent software package, but the truth is I use Acid a lot
more than I use Reason. firstly, Reason is much more complicated, and
secondly, its sequencer sucks ass. it really does, in fact it's the worst
I've ever worked with. the best is the one in Acid, and the second best is
the one in the Akai MPC2000. the sequencer on the Korg ER-1 -- a $100 drum
machine -- is superior to the sequencer in Reason.

besides, Acid is more fun.

it's best for silly remixes:

http://www.neobeatnik.com/rock.mp3

("Rock Steady" by the Whispers vs. "Keep Their Heads Ringing" by Dr. Dre.)

http://www.neobeatnik.com/makai.mp3
http://www.neobeatnik.com/icey.mp3

("Nothing Left" by Orbital, first in the style of Makai "Beneath The Mask"
and then in the style of DJ Icey. I love this song. I think they called it
"Nothing Left" because they got everything right.)

Reason also appears in those little Orbital remixes in the form of tiny
background sounds, acid-style (as opposed to Acid-style). If Acid didn't
have such potent effects (like five different forms of EQ, and excellent
compression) I'd be looking for outboard gear, because Reason itself, so far
as I can tell, is best suited to sounds which are pretty and predictable:

http://www.neobeatnik.com/warble.mp3

(Random ambient stuff.)

The crazy thing about Acid, tho, is that it appears to all eyes not as a
musical instrument but as a toy. I don't understand why, nor do I care --
it's excellent software. Reason is obviously a commodification and emulation
of the technologies that made techno what it is. Acid is likewise a
commodification of jungle's means of production. It's basically just a
software sampler and a very wisely constructed sequencer. It's very easy to
use Acid to emulate jungle effects, even in other genres:

http://www.neobeatnik.com/theireyes.mp3

(Random techno track remixed in old-school Amen jungle style.)

The other nice thing about Acid is that its ease of use makes it the perfect
partner technology to Final Scratch. Final Scratch in and of itself seems
totally useless --

idiot: "dude, now you can spend hours and hours digitizing all your records,
and then when you use the computer, it's just like records, except with
significantly degraded sound quality!"

normal person: "um...cool..."

-- but if you have Final Scratch and Acid it immediately becomes possible to
integrate into your own music just about any song out there. likewise it
takes about five minutes to remix anything in Acid, so it becomes trivial to
guarantee that every song you spin is totally unique.

plus, if you're using a Gnutella client, you can do it all for free.

while it's true that you need something more than Reason and Acid if you
want to do professional recordings, it's true mainly because of copyright
law, and not for any valid musical reason. the combination is incredibly
potent. I've made a dubplate of the above techno track, and I'm seriously
considering pressing up the Orbital bootlegs as a white label -- or actually
I would be, if it were not for my profound respect for copyright law and my
sincere desire to never get caught. so if you ever find those tracks on a
record in a store, it wasn't me.

now one more thing - just because I said Reason's sequencer sucks ass, and
sincerely meant it, does not mean I'm saying Reason itself doesn't have any
value. it's actually a tremendously powerful program, but it's also a lot of
work, while Acid (by contrast) is a lot of fun. but Reason's strength is
absolutely in its tone generation.

anyone who tells you that you can use Reason alone and produce good music is
either incredibly gifted at making mountains out of molehills, or just plain
wrong. Reason's sequencer is very limited and even if you don't agree that
it does indeed suck ass, the difference between Reason's compressors and
those found in Acid (or, indeed, in real life) is like the difference
between playing Gran Turismo and actually driving a car.

however the tone generation kicks ass, which is why I would recommend
getting Reason as well as Acid. Acid on its own quickly degenerates into
silliness. add good tone generation, however, and you can do some pretty
cool shit.

also I think to be perfectly honest a lot of people are scared to criticize
Reason or praise Acid, for the simple reason that Reason is obviously for
real musicians, and Acid is obviously a toy. but "real" bassists considered
the TB303 a toy when it was first released, and "real" musicians in general
considered DJing beneath them for decades.

so, my advice would be, get Reason, Acid, and possibly a sequencer program.
I say possibly because the truth is that MIDI is such a simple protocol that
it would be easy to write your own sequencer in Perl. in fact there are
multiple MIDI Perl packages on CPAN that are worth considering for this
purpose, and I believe that an open-source emulation of the MPC2000
sequencer is also under development somewhere out there on the net. (but I
think they're writing it in C.)


Giles


ps: I've had countless problems with mp3-encoding the dj icey ripoff. there
are some intentional skips in there, but there might be some unintentional
ones as well. also, apologies for the overall quality of the mp3 encoding, I
only have 50MB on my web space.

Subject: [sfraves] Extra special thank you

I want to thank everyone who came out to Vibe Tech on Valentines Day.  It 
was an awesome party and it wouldn't have been possible without all of you.  
We estimate that about 350 ravers showed up.  Not too shabby...  Also, an 
extra special shout-out to DJ Tronic.  It was cool kickin' it, you blew the 
roof of that motha.  I've heard that you can get pictures from the party off 
of renoraves.com message board, but I haven't gotten that far yet.  For 
those of you who went to the Gravity Crew presents, Official DJ Denise after 
party on sunday, we are sorry about the late start, but I think that you all 
know that it was worth the hour delay.  DJ Denise rocked the house and we 
welcome her and everyone back to any and all of our free parties.  Keep your 
eyes and ears posted because we should have some events coming back to the 
bay area soon.
-Trendy aka Joe aka Malacai

Subject: Re: [sfraves] just get Reason and Acid

Sorry to say, but Reason is seriously lacking with the
sound output it spits out.  Really crappy.  I've
played with it on a number of occasions, and , well
yes, it's really cool with all its bells and
whistles...but the sound quality is not one of
professionals.  As far as the sequencer is
concerned...oh yes, I will surely agree...the worst
EVER!  Maybe you should try Logic, because Acid and
the MPC aren't very good sequencers either..

just a thought,

chris

i had to change my cold, plain emotionless title a couple of times, and then finally, i settled on this one...so, basically, i saw the back of your head...not you, YOU, you. i tried to get away, and i hope i did, but also, today i was thinking, maybe not, maybe it would be really cool...i'm not talking to you, i am talking to YOU, you....anyway though, someone yelled out my frigg'in name and maybe some telltale exact details of who i was at the time, and so, well, maybe you caught a small glimpse of my ass or something, but still, i am a much better musician than you, probably...okay, and with that said, basically, i could be talking to just about anybody, which is why i share...keep on move'in. :)

Just curious, what did you think was lacking in the sound quality
and how was the sound being outputted?   I have reason going out
to a PC soundcard and it sounds like shit too but I think
if you had a digital out to a decent DAC it may sound better?

I had it going out through a sound card..SPDIF.  Still
sounds like ass.  It sounds like it should for the
money..and for what it does..which is basically
everything minus a decent sequencer.  Somethings just
not right...they need to make a product that has the
sound quality as well as all the bells and
whistles..then maybe I'd switch...well....naaaaahhh!

Yeah, I've found that, based on what instruments you use, Reason's sound can
be excellent... The thing I've had the most trouble with is the frequency
ranges of the various bass sounds. Some sound really dulled and flat, while
others come out very bright - it's hard to find a middle ground without
tweaking with one sound for what seems like hours... But for the price, it's
hard to argue with it. It just seems to take a lot of work to get some good
sounds out.

At first, I thought Reason was weak and figured I'd better invest in a good
amount of new hardware.. But then I found ways of making  tracks sound
less... loop-based, I guess, and more like natural songs.

A couple of the tracks I've been working with, no one had guessed that I
made them in Reason. You can check out bits here:

http://tavallai.com/music/clips/heart.mp3
http://tavallai.com/music/clips/thought.mp3
http://tavallai.com/music/clips/mine.mp3

However, I'm still slowly trying to collect more and more gear as the need
comes along, as I'm a firm believer in having as many toys as possible ;)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] just get Reason and Acid

Hey,

It appears that to some degree that reason is becoming quite popular in the 
studio. I used to laugh when I ran into someone who used reason as the only 
tool for track composition, but some friends of mine just sold some cuts 
using only  reason and the tracks are quite nice. Even crazier, the last 
time evil eddie richards was in town we got to talking about studio stuff 
and gear and his main piece of software was reason which accounts for about 
80% of his tracks, I know that most of his stuff is super minimal tech house 
but I'll be damned if his cuts dont sound great. All that aside I will still 
opt for a decent combo of hardware and software.

Cheers,

DJMC

Subject: Re: [sfraves] just get Reason and Acid

It's one thing if he's using Reason to create the tracks, but final output
is he using a real ProTools setup or something else to cleanup the sound?
Canned is the term I would use to describe the output from Reason without
any post-processing. To use just Reason, it's virtual mixer, effects and so
on to produce a straight to cd recording doesn't cut it. If Reason is
treated as any other piece of outboard gear that has it's own quirks then I
can see a better use of it. Running Reason through an external mixer or a
real ProTools setup to cleanup the output seems to be the logical step in a
professional setup.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] just get Reason and Acid


Hey,

It appears that to some degree that reason is becoming quite popular in the
studio. I used to laugh when I ran into someone who used reason as the only
tool for track composition, but some friends of mine just sold some cuts
using only  reason and the tracks are quite nice. Even crazier, the last
time evil eddie richards was in town we got to talking about studio stuff
and gear and his main piece of software was reason which accounts for about
80% of his tracks, I know that most of his stuff is super minimal tech house
but I'll be damned if his cuts dont sound great. All that aside I will still
opt for a decent combo of hardware and software.

Cheers,

DJMC

Subject: Re: [sfraves] just get Reason and Acid

What Reason's really turned out to be ideal for, in my opinion, is
portable studio setups.  An iBook, an Oxygen8, some headphones, and
you're off and composing anywhere- like at work :)

Also, if you're using multiple machines (i.e. - laptop for composing
wherever and desktop machine in the studio, or collaborating with a
distant friend), as long as you keep your sample sets in parity between
the machines, you can take your songs (~50-150k) and send them easily
in email and other size-challenged formats.  

For drum programming, the ReDrum is pretty awesome, definitely another
invaluable tool in the sequencer/sampler box.  The synths do,
admittedly, have their anemic moments- and the stock patches are
completely bunk.  However, the NN-XT is a pretty awesome sampler and is
exceedingly quick to work with.

Being a hardware sequencer junkie, I must say that I actually dig
Reason's sequencer- it reminds me of Vision in a way, which is a
program I miss.  I'm really not all that into the
Logic/Cubase/Performer thing..  For my stuff, I'm just trying to
capture what's played, and have decent playback timing.  A good swing
algorithm is important, too.  Reason seems to have better timing than
most seq/midi interface/synth setups, and I'm thinking that may be
because the sounds are generated internally and thus may be quicker to
respond.

In any case, it gets a lot of use around here- I never end up finishing
in Reason, though- too limiting.  Most of my work is done with audio,
and for that I use Pro Tools.  Reason's effects are pretty cool, and
have that propellerhead sound..  ..but that's all they have.  After you
use a couple of delays and verbs, there's just this.. this...
REASONiness that jumps out at you, which can be good or bad.  For
grittier music, it's generally too clean, too.. um.. teutonic
sounding..  Or something.

So, through the plug-in wringer it goes, and comes out sounding more
like hardware, with more separation of the individual elements.  The
mixer within Reason is a bit foggy sometimes.  It can sound quite nice
if you want fog, but often it's a little constricting.

Sometimes I've prefered tracks that were based on Reason parts better
than those done with some pretty good hardware.  Part of that, I think,
is that the mobile setup allows me to capture an idea faster.

Anyway, yeah.  Audio rant #136.

cheers,

I was gonna say that.  Once you learn it well, it reminded me of pro24 (a
product that later became cubase) or vision.  Copy management, editing,
and all that are reasonably powerful and really easy to learn assuming
YOU READ THE FUCKING MANUAL.

Some people demand more control than Reason's sequencer (myself included a
lot of the time, esp when making the basic rhythym of a track... or Chris
Jackson who is so meticulous about timing that I wig out when we work on
tracks together cuz he'll just be zoomed in on two notes and moving them
around a nanometer back and forth at full zoom to get the swing down
perfect)

My gripe with reason is that tight timing starts to fail you if you use a
lot of in line effects.  I don't think the sequencer 'plays ahead' to
compensate for the latency caused by some of the effects... and you can't
impose a playback 'compensation' delay at the per track level.

http://www.saturn5.com/andy/esc-overall-rmx-portion.aif

I'll throw this in for anybody who doubts it's ability to get gritty
sounds.  This segment is a full resolution fragment of a remix I did for
ESC's Overall (a tasty little uptempo number lying on the fringe between
techno and hardcore).  Ed sent me the track in Reason format, and not
having ever used it to really do a track, I decided this was as good a
time as any to try my hand at it.

I picked a couple sounds I liked from the original composition, sample
raided a couple others (just opened them up in Peak and took little cuts,
then enveloped them so they'd sound like drums) and added a couple little
shrill squealy thing with the Maelstrom synth and slapped the drums I cut
up into ReDrum.  For a little rhythmic inspiration, I also 'stole' the
timing from a classic loop I had here (opening theme to Hawaii-Five-0
slowed down a bit) by importing it as a *.rex file and then bouncing the
rex's timing to the sequencer, and using that sequence to trigger a
different rex loop by changing what instrument that seq track was assigned
to (taken from the original ESC arrangement, get it?).

Only post processing was loading the exported file output into Peak and
running Waves' L1 processor on it in order to up the levels a tad.

Is it the next dancefloor anthem?  Doubtful.  It sounds like Drop Bass
Network vs. Aphex Twin, but it's what I was in the mood to make at the
moment and I'm generally pleased with the results.

I think the reason a lot of tracks that are done in Reason sound 'off' is
because a lot of novice producers use Reason... and more seasoned
producers are more familiar with analog mixer based setups where things
work a certain way (for example, in Reason *enabling* the EQs on the
mixer, or carelessly routing effects without making sure they're not
sending back the same signal to the mixer causes smear in the form of
phase error and very short delays causing all sorts of problems... ).

In the end, you can do a hell of a lot more with it than say an 808 and a
303... it's a lot cheaper and a lot easier to use for most stuff.  For my
work I prefer Logic and the mix of fruity hardware and software I've got
here... but it's a great quick arrangement tool as well as a great way of
getting loops together.

Hell, I'd be down if anybody else is to do an SFR MP3 compilation of
remixes of each others' original work... any takers?  Maybe even get
Hyperreal to host it as a downloadable community perk?  If we use Reason
as a base format, we could just assign works to remixers and have tracks
ready inside a couple weeks.  Then the album as a full length cd could be
sold to help support Hyperreal.org online (containing the original and
remixed versions).

Subject: [sfraves] Re: [sacdrama] County Sheriff (was: Wake Up Call to the Scene)

this just goes to show you never know when you you might find intelligent
conversation on this [sacdrama] list. i agree strongly with the point that
jimmy is making:  regardless of what you consider right or wrong, the laws
of our government must be enforced. if you dont like those laws, then you
should work to change them, not disobey them. our society could not exist
if the laws we (you, me, your parents, your neighbors, etc) made were not
enforced.

thank you rick for your feedback and for taking the time to listen to the
people who really care about the scene, who are here to dance and enjoy
themselves.

for better or worse, raving, and to a lesser degree the electronic music
scene, has been associated with drug use. why else would we laugh at
pill-munching pac-man jokes? i dont know how to change that, but you might
want to rethink the next email you send complaining about how the 'scene'
is dead. maybe thats a good thing. maybe the old 'scene' needs to die, the
old image along with it.

if we can make "drug use" socially unacceptable at parties, then people
will be less likely to participate in those activities. it takes more than
just promoters, djs, or words on a mailing list to make a difference. it
takes a change of attitude on each of our behalves. instead of
pointing the kid who just asked you if you were rolling to the nearest
e-puddle, give him the evil eye. reverse that peer pressure. make him feel
uncomfortable to be there, putting our scene at risk. thats how we'll make
our lives, those of our community, and our officers better.

but please remember, the officers that serve our community have a job that
is probably a lot tougher than yours. while we're all out surfing titty
sites and complaining about how bored we are at work, they're out there
risking their lives to protect your rights and freedoms. they're the ones
that allow you to feel safe in your home. i dont know about you, but i
know i dont have to wear a bulletproof vest to work in the morning. i'm
extremely grateful that there are those that choose to; they have my
deepest gratitude and respect.

that being said, i must take this time now to take now to take issue with
the approach the government and law enforcement take at discouraging the
public from drug use. i understand doom's frustration. i think its the
feeling that people who do such little harm to society (or perhaps thats
their mistake, assuming that?) by partaking in extralegal substances
should be the focus of such a well funded 'war.'

"George Bush says 'we are losing the war on drugs'. Well you know what
that implies? There's a war going on, and people on drugs are winning it!
Well what does that tell you about drugs? Some smart, creative
motherfuckers on that side." -- Bill Hicks [1]

i could expound my own opinions here, but frankly i dont have the time nor
would it be as effective as if you did your own research. [2] so i've
included at the bottom in the notes some links for you to read. i wont
push any ideas down your throat, you are free to think freely. take
everything with a grain of salt, and think for yourselves. thats really
the only thing i ever expect of people.

but before i finish, i must emphasize one point. drugs _CAN_ be very bad
for you and everyone else around you if you let them. this is why we have
laws against them, people use them irresponsibly. there are a lot of
irresponsible people in the world, please dont be one of them. remember,
drugs can ruin your life.

drugs are like tools, just like a hammer or a crowbar. unfortunately,
they're more like lock picks. it seems that if you get caught with them,
people will assume you are a theif, which is what a lot of people who
carry around lock picks hidden in their underwear are. but there are a few
that use them to educate themselves, to find their place in the universe,
the meaning of why they are here. they must hide their tools for fear of
being labeled a thief or simply locked up because they make a good target.
so tread lightly, be respectful of others, and please think responsibly.

Expression is limited with one group of mathematicians...electronic music is 
already criticized for it all sounding the same, and Reason helps reassure 
this. 

Get Real Synthesizers...

and when you have real synthesizers, you can play it out live too, like

Subject: Re: [sfraves] just get Reason and Acid


Dominic,

Are you a friggin tool or what?

When the world needed another progressive trance act like I need another
testicle, you were there, banging the trance, riding the trend.  Get off
your high horse and play nice.

I didn't say that Reason is the end all be all, in fact I said that I use
other software when I have a choice.  But just like real music can be made
on a machine rather than some human playing devices of wood and brass...
so can an electronic musician work out their sound on just about any
viable piece of gear.  And reason is, despite some serious shortcomings, a
very economical and viable piece of virtual gear capable of a wide
pallete of sounds and possiblities.

Nothing else will get a studio started faster with more potential for less
money.  Sure, tools like Acid, Reason, and Live will be used to generate
piles and piles of absolute shit, as were the 808, 909, 303, Alpha Juno,
Jupiter 8, OBX, Fender Stratocaster, Marine Band Harmonica, etc before
them.  I have a complete studio with piles of synths, samplers, effects,
etc... but the question was WHAT SOFTWARE SHOULD THIS PERSON GET STARTEE
WITH not "where is Reflector playing next and could you please throw in a
jab while you're at it".

donkey.

Right now is the time for another edition of An Epiphany Of Sound.
This week is Lisa Fox, bringing you the beats from minimal techno, to
electro, to techouse, to straight techno.  She promises to be nice to
your ears, unless you call in begging for a aural spanking.

Remember, we're on every Thur. from 9a-Noon Pacific at 90.1 FM and
online at http://kzsulive.stanford.edu

Later.

andy.

I was stating my opinion on the subject.
"just get reason and acid" would be objected by most people in the industry.  
Sure there is everything there, but that everything all has that "reason" 
sound.  The way you get out of this is to have different synths. 

You seem to attack me as if you have hate in your heart.  Sorry I'm not 
living in your world, this is not your world, it is ours, our sfraves.org, it 
is our electronic music...

You also mentioned I may have been riding with the trend...if I was riding 
with the trend I would've been a DJ, I took it one step further and did it 
live.  And if all of this is a trend, the trend is over, and I should 
stop...but I am still doing it.  So you obviously don't know me.  

why dot u get to know me at the agenda lounge march 7th.  (friday) 10:30 no 
sneakers i will put andy w  and friends on the glist, we want you to look 
nice because lots of cute girls will be there : )

(the scene: a lawn in Oregon. cloudy skies. Andy and Giles are sitting in
lawn chairs. Andy appears to be asleep. Giles is talking to somebody.)

Giles: Dude, the Korg Prophecy, it's amazing, but I can't deal with the
manuals, there's like the little manual and the big manual, it's like, the
beginner manual and the advanced manual, the operations manual and the sound
design manual, I mean, this keyboard is cool, the sounds are incredible, but
it's just so damn complicated, I wouldn't even read one manual, unless they
did it as a comic book, but this thing has two manuals, and I just can't
deal with two different manuals--

Andy: MANUALS?!

(Andy roars to life from an apparent coma, knocking over three chairs, two
tents, and a bong. In the background comes the sound of a woman screaming
"What's that thing?" and her friends reassuring her, "It's just Andy." Giles
cowers before the awakened beast.)

Andy: Manuals?

Giles: Manuals.

Andy: Did you say manuals?!

Giles: No.

Andy: Derrick May didn't use manuals! Juan Atkins didn't use manuals!

Giles: Uh...

Andy: Manuals!

(Andy grunts, falls over, and lapses back into unconsciousness.)

tune... No one will ask :-O

I've been hearing that.  KZSU/1 and KZSU/2 are the same stream right now
(when there's no sports broadcast) so try both.  And try the various
flavors too (R.A., MP3, WMA.)

i produced the second compilation album for the
SoCal-Raves list, "SCR.COMP.002", and it was a lot of
expense, hassle and hard work.  honestly, i had fun
doing it and i'd be more than happy to lend advice to
anyone interested.  

here's some press i got about the album if you want to
read about it: 
http://www.ocweekly.com/ink/02/02/music-asch.php

<BSP>
better still, if you want to buy one, you can pick 'em
up from http://www.pureacidmixtapes.com  - just type
in "SCR Comp.002" in the search field (without the
quotes).
</BSP>

Licensing of tracks, artwork, professional printing,
mastering, replication and packaging for a 1000 unit
run (which is usually the minimum for replication) is
going to cost you somewhere in the $3.5k - $4.5k
range, depending on how good your contacts are and how
cheap they'll work.

it isn't all milk & honey, though.  in the end i wound
up with a lot of CDs that just won't sell, even though
the music on them is really good.  when i tried
marketing the CDs here on SFR, i got royally bitched
out and told that i should be giving them away for
free.

so, i'd say that if you've got $4k to blow, go for it.
 if not, just collect the tracks, put 'em up as MP3s
on a website for free and call it a day.

No reason to spend 4 grand on a run of CD's - you can get excellent
quality professional dupes done for $1.70 apiece (for cd sleeves) or $2.50
apiece (for jewel cases) for a run of 1000 cds... which is a lot of cd's.
That includes on-disk 4-color silkscreening, and full-color packaging
artwork, mind you.

For a list like SFR, seems to me that a few hundred discs is plenty.
Or maybe get hyperreal to host an disk image, MP3's, tracklistings, and
PDF files of cover artwork so people can make their own physical
artifacts. :D

I'd be happy to help. Not a musician.

I like the hosted idea and create your own physical product. I don't see
enough demand to warrant a professional reproduction of this cd. Afterall
this is an online community so it seems fitting to host the music of it's
netizens online. Maybe I'll drag my midi gear back out and do something
new... I keep meaning to.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] just get Reason and Acid

Reason, Rewire, Cubase/Logic, outboard effects or
VST/DirectX/Native plug-ins. Reason's "flat" sound is
something to take into consideration but there's these
little tricks known in music recording called
PROCESSING and MASTERING.

Seeming as how Reason is primarily sample based, you
can import your own samples, run it rewire into Waves
plug-ins for instance, or an outboard compressor like
a Focusrite or even a shitty Alesis 3630, and I
guarantee the common candy raver wouldn't know the
difference. 
This also allows you to sequence Reason with your
favorite outboard synths like a Virus or Nord, or any
synth or drum machine plug-in. 

I find myself using Reason mainly as a Redrum plug-in
for Cubase, as I find there are better plug-in
samplers and synths out there than the Subtractor or
NN-19. I like the Redrum because it is extremely
versatile and easy to use and sounds 200% better when
bussed through my Aphex and Focusrite. Granted the
Redrum is a sampler and you can do the same things
with Battery or any sampler, it's too useful and easy
that I can't pass it up and you can open up ten
Redrums if you please. Pretty much, Reason has become
my main drum machine with the combination of external
DSP.
Why pass a good thing just because people refer to it
as a "toy"?

Subject: [sfraves] Isles Records, DNB Vinyl Clearance

Any dnb heads? Any 2002 releases you missed and are dying for?

Pardon the spam...FYI

Isles Records never actually got the chance to sell any records due to economy in 2002.

I (Kris Dickman aka Isles) has 5 - 10 copies of each dnb new release for the year of 2002. Please shoot me an email and I will send you the inventory.

I will sell each record for wholesale price and if you buy 100$ or more I will take 20% off and ship to you for free.

In some cases, I could probably deliver them to your door.

Have a good day!

PEACE

Isles aka Kris Dickman

Subject: [sfraves] War is a force that gives us meaning

There was an incredible broadcast sunday atfernoon on KQED, with a speech
by Christopher Hedges, in which he contrasts the myth of war - that it
benefits society by providing a shared quest and common suffering - with
the realities of chaos and destruction that he has witnessed firsthand as
a war correspondent in places like Sarajevo and elsewhere, and the
post-war emotional havoc created in the lives of the soldiers who fight.

He is a slightly stilted speaker, which to my ear made him sound more
/real/ and less polished or calculated than your typical pundit. Really a
great speech, which is reproduced here in realaudio (sorry) format:

Subject: [sfraves] Re: [sacdrama] County Sheriff (was: Wake Up Call to the Scene)

Try taking off your blinders.  You seem to have "the law" confused with "what
is right".  They are NOT one and the same.  In fact, they are, all too
frequently, entirely different.

You should go back and re-read the works of Henry David Thoreau.  He's a far
more eloquent writer than I, and any summary I could write would not do him
justice.  But the general point he makes is that when the law is WRONG, not
only are you justified in breaking it, but you have, in fact, a moral
OBLIGATION to do so.

Now, I'm not saying that anyong should feel *obligated* to drop E at a party. 
That'd be rathar stupid a claim for me to make.  And honestly, many of the
parties I've been to of late would have been better experiences if there *were*
less drug use.  But that's not for ME to decide.  That's not for YOU to decide.
 That's not a decision for ANYONE, except for the individual who is making the
decision wether or not to use any given substance.  And NO ONE has ANY moral
right to interject themselves into that individual's decision.

The laws, drug-related or not, that are used to suppress the rave scene are
WRONG.  (Hell... drug laws in general, but that's a tangental issue.)  And
respect is not a given, it is earned or lost.  As such, I HAVE no respect for
the people who write/enforce those laws.  It is NOT a defence.  "I was just
following orders/the law" does NOT excuse their behavior.  This has been
established as a precept of civilized society for the better part of a century
now.  Those people who hide behind that shield deserve NOTHING more than every
possible contempt and loathing.

What it all boils down to is that WE are *NOT* the ones in the wrong.  The cops
are.  As such, THEY have the moral obligation to change THEIR behavior, not us
or ours.  Maybe it's hopelessly naieve and unpratical to expect the police to
develop a sence of what is right and wrong, and to cease infringing on the
natural rights of the individual.  But that IS the way it's SUPPOSED to be. 
And we should NEVER lose sight of that.


cya,
john

It just snowed a lot this past weekend. Conditions were beautiful on Monday
and I only wish I had the cash to go up then. My plan is a screw off day
Boringeal and then the party. Boringeal is cheap and that's the only reason
I want to go.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii


hot fudge sundaes at mcd's are a dollar and some change...i've cut back, but also, of course, i just ate one, because i could...with that said....it is time for FISH: the rated X version: 

little fishy fish put on his little red, poke-a-dot bow tie, stuffed a fishy fish condom in his trouser pocket, and then went out for a swim in the deep blue sea....a long time ago, before this very day, little fishy fish died, but was brought back to life by a burst of foreign energy from a ufo....so, little fishy fish lives on, but suddenly, because the horniest little fishy fish you ever saw. :)

I hear ya...

It' will be a "search for your spot" type of campout - but its better to
crash on the ground in a tent then crash your car into the side of a
mountain.  So defintately, bring that tent.  I'll be bringing my good'
'ol 4x4 - it has a feather bed in the back.  Woooo hoooooooo....

All I gotta do is hook up the DVD and disco ball and I'll have a party
on wheels!

Subject: [sfraves] sfr music compilation

ok i think we're getting the ball rolling with this, thusfar the ideas i've
had and seen discussed are:
1) free mp3/iso or dupe-cd
2) no post-production engineer, straight from artist to cd.

some rules for the comp?
1) must be original work from a person on sfr.
2) can be a remix of other artists on sfr.
3) can be done using any system, so long as versions being submitted for a
   remix are in a easily re-rendered form.

so, a cd of only sfr artists or remixes of sfr artists work by other sfr
artists.

Well, you'll have to drive where the snow is.  It'll be about an hour or
so past Sacramento I suppose, either up the 50 or the 80, but no
detailed directions have been given yet.

Turns out that the 1st 16 tracks of the show were all Resource Records
songs.  You better make sure you contact the RIAA and demand your cut of

Subject: RE: [sfraves] BSP: snow party this saturday

OK, I'm willing to sound like a perfect idiot here.

Can someone tell me where this IS?  Like, just in general, how much of a
tank of gas (1991 Honda civic) would I use to get there?  I'd really love to
go -- I haven't seen a snow party since I lived in Seattle!  Anyway,
everybody else seems to know where this is, and if any of you would clue me
in, I'd be ever so grateful.


Later, thanks, and have fun!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] BSP: snow party this saturday

It's going to be in Tahoe somewhere. Where *exactly* I have no clue. Plan on
driving to Tahoe like you were going to NorthStar or something and you'll be
fine. 91 Civic, no traffic, going 80 = 1/2 tank of gas, 2.5 hours from the
Bay Area.

OK, I'm willing to sound like a perfect idiot here.

Can someone tell me where this IS?  Like, just in general, how much of a
tank of gas (1991 Honda civic) would I use to get there?  I'd really love to
go -- I haven't seen a snow party since I lived in Seattle!  Anyway,
everybody else seems to know where this is, and if any of you would clue me
in, I'd be ever so grateful.


Later, thanks, and have fun!

Man, I am totally down. But, like many others, I suffer from a lack of
immediate long-range transportation. I'm gonna see what I can do to hit up
friends for rides -- but if I can't, anyone willing to transport a Marin
boy to the fields of snow? :)

I can probably chip in on gas...

Subject: Re: [sfraves] more hot fudge sundaes and FISH RATED X version nrr 

I got a monterey quesedilla, along with the #6 that contains 2 chalupas and 
a taco.
Its funny that they're called chalupas-i heard a mexican guy by my house 
refer to children as chalupas. But i didnt eat them-i became full after 
only the taco with no lettuce and the quesadilla-i always get no lettuce 
because *yes, i will respond with an equally nonsensical post every time 
she does this* i dont like the lettuce-and i think they put more cheese on 
when i dont ask for it-the big guy there knows me and even knows what i 
drink-i dont even have to tell him and he just fills up the cup with code 
red. so now i have 2 chalupas (not kids) waiting to be eaten if i get 
hungry

I think just with that name alone you could get on a mic on stage like
Timmy from SouthPark and keep repeating your name. "Wronghole...... Wro
wron wro Wrong hole bleh"

I honestly believe there is some talent on this list but it would take
some scouring to weed out the wreckers. Also not many people are willing
to pay travel for the out of staters like me. I may be a decent dj but
the money just isn't there. Well maybe when Bill Gates takes over the
Rave Scene. LOL

Subject: Re: [sfraves] sfr music compilation


Some ideas I ran over...

* They must be sample clean.  No tracks using samples' of other artists'
works may be entered.  Sorry, but we can't afford to put SFR or Hyperreal
in any sort of intellectual property liability.

* Must be unique to this compilation (not a track existing elsewhere,
owned by a label or publishing house, etc).

* I'd like to release this as a GPL like license (does anybody have any
info on that offical 'free' music license).  Meaning that it can be used
wherever, whenever by anybody, but they gotta drop your name and give
proper credit.

* Must be submitted in full resolution format.  I'd like to seriously
consider at least a CD-R pool that could honor requests for non-compressed
CD's to be made available, with proceeds (if any) going to Hyperreal.
There are professional services that can do as needed CD-R runs with
pretty labels and all that.

* Mastering should be available for those tracks needing it.  I could do
this, I also happen to know a grumpy techno guy that does *great* work
(Chris?).

* To be eligible to do a remix, you have to submit a track.  If you submit
a track, keep individual sounds you used in the production available
should someone want to do a remix and wants chunkage.

* I'd like to arbitrate in the case of too many tracks coming in.  My main
criteria would be : representation of genres in a way that is
representative of SFR's participants, quality of production, and lastly
how much I like the tune.  Although I am a very opinionated and vocal
member of this list, I love a lot of different styles of music, and like
to think I'm very fair when put in a judging capacity.  I am really
*hoping* to see at least two trance tracks, one hardcore track, one techno
track, one breaks track, one jungle track, one 2-step track, two house
tracks, one electro track, one progressive track, an ambient or IDM track
(and yes, at some point I have danced to all of the above... even ambient
which scares some people).  There's a shitload of really serious talent on
this list, and my intention would be to not bias anything to my personal
agenda but to represent the diversity of audio creativity on this list as
a form of education to those who think we're all clones.  If you have an
issue with this, we could take the arguement to the SFR list where I'd
state my case and you yours and do a web poll for results.

* Tracks should be less than 5 minutes.  I'd like a full CD of music from
many artists.

* What's in it for you?  Hyperreal is a major resource for data about
dance music events.  Having your name on this compilation would be a good
thing.  If you submit a track that doesn't end up on the compilation, you
still have your dope track.  No harm, no foul.

* How would it get distributed (mp3)?  We could create an MP3.com 'artist'
called SFRaves and do it that way with links from SFR, or have them on SFR
outright, or link them to someone that is confident their server can
handle whatever bandwidth is generated quickly for a period of one year.

* How it would get manufactured/distributed locally?  I could foot the
inital bill for a small CD-R run, we could pool out either cd
manufacturing or paying in $20 for each artist, etc.  I'd perfer not to
worry about this until other areas of this are good to go.  It doesn't
cost a thing to get the idea going and see what the artists + sfr list
decide down the road.

* How would it be promoted?  Each artist could make cd copies available as
giveaways, site links, etc.  We could probably get a MP3 featured artist
if we wanna go that route and some press as a result of it being a
GNU-license release.

* What about the annoying list traffic for people who don't care?  We
could keep discussion about it on list with a unique subject line to make
life easy but still keep the general population of SFR informed, or create
a dedicated list for this subject with updates to SFR as we hit
milestones.

* What sorta of timeline are we talking about?  I'm thinking till April
10th for submissions, April 30th as a late day for remixes (seeing as
completed track would have to happen first *derf*) with a projected
release date of June 1st.

Sorry, in a past life I was a project manager...

So-here's my big thought on things-

There's plenty of visual talent here as well-
How about a dual-sided single disc-CD on one-DVD on the other.
"normal" tracks on teh CD side, and then maybe a 5.1 mix on the DVD side 
along with visuals from a bunch of people-
or remixes on the DVD side?

I dunno how much those discs cost to make, but I think that would be some 
pretty dope shit :)

Most DJs aren't producers.  I'm talking about original works, representing
the creative music generation side of SFR.

They're still far more expensive than CD, and I think that will be a
hurdle if we do just audio... so probably not.

Subject: [sfraves] ACID vs Cubase SX

So it's mentioned that the sequencer in ACID is pretty great.  4.0 seems 
to be the first version of ACID with an actual MIDI sequencer, and I was 
wondering what people's thoughts were on this sequencer compared to, 
say, Cubase SX?  Both have great audio engines, i know, and both have 
good effects, and are compatible with VST instruments/effects.  The new 
sequencer, however, I have no experience with, but if it's as functional 
and as well-interfaced as the one on Cubase, then I'm seriousely 
thinking of getting that at a better price, and with really great 
looping tools.  Plus, it should interface really well with SoundForge, 
my favourite sound editing program.  

Interested to hear any thoughts . . .

Subject: Re: [sfraves] sfr music compilation

Maybe since it seems like a lot of tracks will be submitted this might be a
good or semi good idea. How about this; (the drumnbassarena.com did this for
a mix of original jungle tracks). Lets say we break it down to these
catagories: trance, house, techno, jungle, ambient+idm+dub+triphop. Then
each track with the producers name is put up under the the type of music
they spin with voting tabs. Listers can vote for a week. Must be a
registered SFR so you can only vote once. Then just par down the tracks from
there. You could even get a nice little SFR producers page outta that, and a
place for heads to get to know the producers, and finally show that some of
the dj's around here why they need to be a bit more APPRECIATED of the
excellent producers outta the bay.

I think another option could be to set up a producer page on Hyperreal, that 
people can upload their originals or remixes to.  Rather than having a 
predetermined set of songs people to download, they have their options of 
what to listen to.  And if somebody wants to have a new song posted, and 
currently have a song up, they should have to remove the older track to make 
room for the new one.  That helps keep the drive space down, and lets people 
hear what's new and current for that particular artist.  Just a thought...

http://creativecommons.org/learn/license/ is the one you're thinking of, I
think. Seems increadibly flexible, and much better-suited to artistic work
than the GPL (how would the "source" clause of the GPL apply to music?)

Well, you'll have to drive where the snow is.  It'll be about an hour or
so past Sacramento I suppose, either up the 50 or the 80, but no
detailed directions have been given yet.

BayAreaRavers.comThis is DEFINITELY rave related!=20

I don't think I will be participating in this (partly because I work =
this Saturday), but it says that if I wanted to forward it on to others, =
that I should do that...

Hey -=20

I work for Peter Jennings Productions documentary production company and =
I am trying to canvass the San Francisco Bay area to find any Ecstasy =
users who would be willing to go on camera and discuss positive =
experiences they have had with ecstasy. We are not looking to single out =
rave culture nor imply that ecstasy is synonymous with rave culture - as =
I completely understand that for most people it is about the music and =
not about the drugs. We will be shooting interviews in San Francisco on =
Sat, Feb 22 from approx. 10am-1pm.

We are looking for a wide demographic of people - young, old, rich, =
poor, black, white, yellow, brown, gay, straight, business man, guy on =
the street, urban, suburban - you get the idea. Ecstasy - like no other =
drug before it - is an incredibly democratic drug in that is not limited =
to one section of the population (as crack would be considered a "drug =
of the poor" and cocaine would be considered a "yuppie" drug). We are =
trying to represent this diversity of users in our documentary. But more =
importantly, we want to focus on the good experiences that people have =
with ecstasy - why they take it, how they feel it benefits their life, =
what sort of impact it has had on them and their circle of friends.=20

The documentary we are doing is not meant to be moral or political. It =
is simply taking a real approach to the drug and looking at why the =
government has reacted so badly to a drug that has, relatively speaking, =
few side effects and a great potential for therapeutic uses. This =
documentary is not promoting the use of ecstasy. But what we want to do =
is take a rational approach to drug use and say - look. People are going =
to use drugs. And there is a reason they are. Why - because it effects a =
lot of people's lives in a positive way. And here is this drug Ecstasy. =
In terms of drugs that are out there, it has relatively few side =
effects. So why has the government put it on the same level as crack and =
heroine? Why are there stiff legal penalties that are ruining people's =
lives and putting them in prison for mandatory minimum sentences? Why =
does the government throw so much money at scientists producing dubious =
brain scans who are attempting to demonize ecstasy? This is a drug that =
countless well respected psychiatrists have used with patients. They =
have praised this drug as a powerful tool to improve people's lives and =
help deal with psychological problems. There are many users out there =
who can talk intelligently and in a meaningful way about why ecstasy has =
been a positive experience for them (that's where you come in).=20

Anyway - that's generally the angle our documentary is taking. We are =
interviewing people like chemist Sasha Shulgin, Wade Hampton (wish FM), =
psychiatrists Ralph Metzner and George Greer, and have talked to the =
head of DanceSafe (who is familiar with our project). If you are =
interested in participating, please email me or give me a call so we can =
chat a little.  We hope for this to be a different kind of documentary, =
not one about anti-drug propaganda or one intent on demonizing rave =
culture. We hope that this will bring more honest views about Ecstasy to =
light.  Again, we will be shooting in San Francisco this coming Sat, Feb =
22nd from approx. 10am-1pm. If you think this would be appropriate to =
forward to members of your website or friends you may have, please do =
so.



Thank you,=20

Susan's message has been circulating around - the general concensus mong
most people I know who've received it, is to ignore it. It's too risky to
talk to major newsmedia who are trying to appease you to go on-camera
talking about illegal acts, and IMHO the media have a long way to go
before they can be trusted to present balanced views on the drug war. ABC
is owned by Disney, the "family company", which should be a pretty major
indicator that they lack the incentive to present balanced views about e
use.

Hey - 

I work for Peter Jennings Productions documentary production company and I am trying to canvass the San Francisco Bay area to find any Ecstasy users who would be willing to go on camera and discuss positive experiences they have had with ecstasy. We are not looking to single out rave culture nor imply that ecstasy is synonymous with rave culture - as I completely understand that for most people it is about the music and not about the drugs. We will be shooting interviews in San Francisco on Sat, Feb 22 from approx. 10am-1pm.

We are looking for a wide demographic of people - young, old, rich, poor, black, white, yellow, brown, gay, straight, business man, guy on the street, urban, suburban - you get the idea. Ecstasy - like no other drug before it - is an incredibly democratic drug in that is not limited to one section of the population (as crack would be considered a "drug of the poor" and cocaine would be considered a "yuppie" drug). We are trying to represent this diversity of users in our documentary. But more importantly, we want to focus on the good experiences that people have with ecstasy - why they take it, how they feel it benefits their life, what sort of impact it has had on them and their circle of friends. 

The documentary we are doing is not meant to be moral or political. It is simply taking a real approach to the drug and looking at why the government has reacted so badly to a drug that has, relatively speaking, few side effects and a great potential for therapeutic uses. This documentary is not promoting the use of ecstasy. But what we want to do is take a rational approach to drug use and say - look. People are going to use drugs. And there is a reason they are. Why - because it effects a lot of people's lives in a positive way. And here is this drug Ecstasy. In terms of drugs that are out there, it has relatively few side effects. So why has the government put it on the same level as crack and heroine? Why are there stiff legal penalties that are ruining people's lives and putting them in prison for mandatory minimum sentences? Why does the government throw so much money at scientists producing dubious brain scans who are attempting to demonize ecstasy? This is a drug that countless well respected psychiatrists have used with patients. They have praised this drug as a powerful tool to improve people's lives and help deal with psychological problems. There are many users out there who can talk intelligently and in a meaningful way about why ecstasy has been a positive experience for them (that's where you come in). 

Anyway - that's generally the angle our documentary is taking. We are interviewing people like chemist Sasha Shulgin, Wade Hampton (wish FM), psychiatrists Ralph Metzner and George Greer, and have talked to the head of DanceSafe (who is familiar with our project). If you are interested in participating, please email me or give me a call so we can chat a little. We hope for this to be a different kind of documentary, not one about anti-drug propaganda or one intent on demonizing rave culture. We hope that this will bring more honest views about Ecstasy to light. Again, we will be shooting in San Francisco this coming Sat, Feb 22nd from approx. 10am-1pm. If you think this would be appropriate to forward to members of your website or friends you may have, please do so.



Thank you,

hi,

i have a happy hard core track that i made a while ago that is pretty chessy, but super fun and well made. it is ready to bump a system (the mix-down is great).

how can i go about having a label press it? which labels might like it? (i am not at all familiar with the hhc scene.) are there any bay area hhc labels?

you can download the track here:

http://www.mathsound.com/audio/jurassicravers.mp3

thanks!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Need Help From Happy-HardCore Producers/Djs/Fans

Hi Carlos,

There is Ravin Beats USA (based in LA)... SSU in Sacramento... then there is
also Pitched Up over in the Mid West...

Personally, i think that the track sounds more of an SSU track then either
Pitched Up or Ravin Beats...

but either way, you would get better feedback on the track by sending it to
either BayAreaHappycore@yahoogroups.com or happyusa@yahoogroups.com (both of
which you will have to subscribe to through www.yahoogroups.com)

hope that helps

Subject: RE: [sfraves] a letter from ABC to ME?!?!?!

At the same time though, it would be good to have positive
representation instead of people who do way too much and give it a bad
name just by being on the show.  Its just those who do it occasionally
are typically not going to want to go and broadcast it to the world.

I'd really like to see someone spin the angle about shyness and
nonacceptance in normal society and finding extasy and being able to
make friends and start feeling good about themselves for the first time,
preferably by someone who doesn't go overboard on it.

I'd do it but for me, the raves alone were enough at first to break me
out of my shell.  I din't know about extasy until about 4 years later
and although I've had positive expieriences, its not something I like
that much.

Susan's message has been circulating around - the general concensus mong
most people I know who've received it, is to ignore it. It's too risky
to talk to major newsmedia who are trying to appease you to go on-camera
talking about illegal acts, and IMHO the media have a long way to go
before they can be trusted to present balanced views on the drug war.
ABC is owned by Disney, the "family company", which should be a pretty
major indicator that they lack the incentive to present balanced views
about e use.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] a letter from ABC to ME?!?!?!

Its been spread among those of us at DanceSafe as well, we are kind of 50/50
on it for one reason..

Although ABC has been "ok" as far as their objectivity overall, this story
seems to be just aching to be made into a media circus.. and since it
appears well over 2000+ emails were sent out to various sources, up to and
including people and orgs that have nothing to do with the Rave, Drug, or
psychadelic scene.. it smacks of "we will take who we can get"

So, the debate is on over if and who will take it.

I completely agree, having had much the same experience as you're
describing... I'm just not convinced that Peter Jennings should be the one
to tell the world. It sounds like thousands of people have received this
message - I was cc'ed along with every other e-mail address on the
viberation.com site, and people have posted to other lists I'm on with
copies of the letter - so I suspect that ABC is looking to get a broad
range of users to choose from. Your typical TV news segment on such a
topic might interview 2 or 3 individuals in-depth - with a large pool of
willing interviewees, they're free to pick the most whacked, fruitcake
wierdos available to kick up the ratings a bit.

I hate being a complete cynic, sometimes. :P

It's tempting, but last time I attempted to board, I hurt myself.  So, I'm 
thinking about renting a snowmobile and /killing/ myself.. hehe

I completely agree, having had much the same experience as you're
describing... I'm just not convinced that Peter Jennings should be the
one to tell the world. It sounds like thousands of people have received
this message - I was cc'ed along with every other e-mail address on the
viberation.com site, and people have posted to other lists I'm on with
copies of the letter - so I suspect that ABC is looking to get a broad
range of users to choose from. Your typical TV news segment on such a
topic might interview 2 or 3 individuals in-depth - with a large pool of
willing interviewees, they're free to pick the most whacked, fruitcake
wierdos available to kick up the ratings a bit.

I hate being a complete cynic, sometimes. :P

You are correct!
and to nick who said this isn't exactly hhc:
i would say it is definitely not typical hhc, but that's a good thing. music that too neatly fits a genre name is often boring or overly cliche.

ahhh...the smiths do your pressing..okay.  that makes
me feel a little more comfotable [rti could still send
the wrong stamper]!  i've been a little edgy ever
since Garth's Greyhound Label was shipped 300 of my
promos...he in turn stickered and put one sheets in
the records and sent them out to his disti's and dj's
as his newest release!  a few days later the mistake
was noticed by a distributor who knew what my next
release was and brought it to my attention!  a gave
garth a hard time for not checking the cat. number or
at least listening to the first one in the box [like i
normally do]!  I'll bet he does now...

Subject: Re: [sfraves] a letter from ABC to ME?!?!?!

I agree with those jaded souls who are perhaps suspicious about this 
email from ABC. Yet, there are millions of people in this country who 
have experienced ecstacy first hand and have a pretty good feeling 
about it over all.

Does their experience somehow not count as truth?

Of course there are the abusers who spoil it for the rest of us, but 
ANYTHING, not just illegal and relatively harmless drugs, can be 
abused and spoiled for the rest of us.

Yes it's true that ABC is owned by Disney, who also owns a shitload 
of other media outlets. But wasn't Disney relatively progressive on 
homosexual lifestyle issues in comparison to other large 
multinational corporations? Didn't this reflect in their TV show 
depictions, e.g. Ellen, etc.?

Is there a chance that Disney/ABC is going to try and progressively 
portray ecstacy use? Seems like somebody should send some questions 
back up thru Susan Schaefer like these:


* What is is ABC going to do with such interviews?

* What is ABC trying to accomplish?

* What is the timeline for the running of this documentary?

* What sort of guarantees can be obtained to prove that ABC will run 
a truly objective story?

* What kind of protections can ABC give to interviewees to prevent 
negative consequences to their cooperation?

* Will ABC be paying people to participate in this?


All in all it seems to good be true that a major media outlet would 
want depict the benign reality of ecstacy use without some hidden 
agenda.

Hope I'm not too jaded,

BS

Ah synchronicity. We'll probably be up for the party as well, we've been 
itching to go dancing again. :)

Very good questions. Perhaps the gods would have you to email said questions 
to Susan Schaefer. Food for thought.

sometimes, even if your a girl, you just HAVE to be the bigger man in the situation...don't worry, you can still be totally femmie and stuff like that at the same time.....now, it is a privilege to cry alone...why? you might ask...well, think about it this way...if you cry your eyes out all alone, you are at no one's mercy other than your own...also, if you cry alone, that means you've actually won a little space of privacy for yourself, and when your done crying, you can also PLAY!!!!!!! and play without being at anyone's mercy but your own!!!!!...also, i was thinking that there are certain disco songs that will forever be gay anthems....if you have never experienced san francisco gay culture, well then, i'd say it is time to get on that happy horse, because there is nothing like dancing to disco with a score of beautiful gay boys, especially the s.f. version. :) :) :) enjoy your time.

I find it very amusing that inbetween all the bsp's, politics, drama and 
talk of electronic music; we still get these open minded free written 
thoughts that have nothing to do with anything at all!

I envy Geri, I wish my mind was that free.

Subject: [sfraves] A party for those into BurningMan

For all those Burningman types, there is going to be a benefit party for the 
Catfish Ranch folks who had a small problem with their set-up due to the 
rains last December. So they need your help in order that they can get back 
on track for BMAN 2003. There is a small donation of 5 bucks to enter and 
its all night long. For further details please visit the following web site.

www.jumbobrain.com/catfish

PS: I may even be spinning a set there as well so come on down, meet us at 
the ranch!

I am reminded of the immortal words of Socrates who once said
     "I drank what?"

>From the letter it doesnt seem they want to do a balenced documentary at

who use it victums...extacy is not harmless and has side effects just like
any other anti-depressent. The truth, however, is that unless you made the
pills your self you dont know whats really in them (that risk can be
minimized thanks to  DanceSafe and general awareness)... I'm not preaching
or anything but does anyone else feel that glorifing extacy use is not the
right thing to do? wouldn't it just bring more strung out 15 year olds to
"rave parties"?

If you started sniffing glue, a lot, everyday... you might get there by
retirement age (provided you have a genetic predisposition for such stuff
and also have eaten a lot of E, xanax, librium, and vintage brown acid
from woodstock).

I'm down... I am just finishing up a track/remix project that is a big 
milestone in production for myself. Already did some preliminary club 
testing; hope to get by :code/DNA before it starts next week to check it 
out there.

 >so, i'd say that if you've got $4k to blow, go for it.
if not, just collect the tracks, put 'em up as MP3s
on a website for free and call it a day.

As Andy mentioned CDR duplication would be a good option; you can get 
silver/silver CDRs with thermal printing on CD and a color insert on demand 
in 100 or 200 lots. Going this route would also make creating a double CD 
quite manageable; which at this point seems like it will be necessary if 
multiple genres are included on this comp with 2+ remixers per genre. I 
believe a release of 100 double CDR comps duplicated with cases & inserts 
would be no more than ~$325 with a little time invested by a couple of 
people; for a couple more $$$ ~$410 very little work at all outside post 
production efforts. A portion of the 1st 100 comps recoups up front costs 
and funds the 2nd 100, etc.

Andy's ideas <clipped>
 >Some ideas I ran over...
* They must be sample clean.
* Mastering should be available for those tracks needing it.

I think this is all good input; I definitely like the music license part. 
I'd also be glad to contribute (free) my post production skills for this 
"SFR compilation". I am working with some great hardware (Manley Massive 
Passive EQ and Cranesong STC-8 compressor mostly)...

Best,

okay, so i should probably give a good example of the kind of classic disco song i mean...do you know the one that goes, "don't leave me this way..." and the chorus goes, "Baby! my heart is full of love!"?...i don't know who sings that, but it is just the kind of song that brings feelings of love and reminscene into the hearts of many, particularly those who are familiar with the Castro scene in s.f.....the gay community in s.f. didn't just do a lot for music and dance. they've done a lot and continue to do things to liberate the spirits and to promote the health of many...you don't have to be homosexual either to understand, benefit or appreciate it. pure joy. that is why gay pride is so well celebrated yearly in the city by everyone. :)

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii


i was going to share a couple of things that might make you laugh...i am good at making people laugh. :) :)....okay, the first one made me mad at first, but also, it made me laugh too, and i might have mentioned it here, maybe not, but even if i did, it was making me laugh again this morning, so maybe you too:

i was in a store trying on a dress one day, and when i came out of the dressing room to see what i looked like in the larger mirror, there was a young man...maybe around 21 or 22 years old... sitting in one of those chairs that is typically at the end of a dressing room waiting for his girlfriend...when he saw me, he made a series of comments on the dress, but the funniest one was, "yeah, that looks really nice on you, especially when you go braless like that."....okay keep reading:

the next funny thing happened more recently, like last night, was when i was visiting a friend...he is a very big man, and while he is not afraid of smart women nor is he a total homophobe, he is also very classically masculine in appearance and role and very, very straight....when i saw him, i told him that he looked nice and that i thought his shirt was cool (because it was, and i never lie about things like that to a man...if a man is striking, he is striking, and it just can't be helped ), and he said, "thank you" and told me that while it was a man's shirt, that it was something that he bought for his sister, and then he snagged it out of her closet and don't i do things like that too? and i said, "yes, sometimes, i wear men's clothing, but usually not their pants, because their pants are much too big. " and he says, "well, that's good. a man wouldn't want to wear a pair of tight fitting pants. " and i said, "well, a lot of french men wear tight black levi's", and he says, "i'm not into those european guys." :) :) :)

"Don't Leave Me This Way"

Two versions.  Thelma Houston's on a 12" in 1977 was the big disco hit.  In 
the same year P.I.R. (Philly International Records) released a double album 
with eight Tom Moulton mixes of the greatest hits of P.I.R. and of that 
album most of the titles were also released on a 12" promo single, also the 
Harold Melvin & the Blue notes classic, but in a edit version of almost 
eight minutes, three minutes less than the Tom Moulton album version on 
'Philadelphia Classics'



Don't leave me this way

I can't survive I can't stay alive, without your love Oh baby

Don't leave me this way,

no I can't exist ... I'll surely miss your tender kiss

Don't leave me this way



Ahhh, baby!

My heart is full of love and desire for you

Now com'on down and do what you gotta do

You started this fire down in my soul

Now can't you see it's burning out of control

Com'on, satisfy the need in me

'Cause only your good lovin' can set me free



Don't, don't you leave me this way,

no don't you understand I'm at your command

Oh baby please, please, don't leave me this way ... nooo baby

Don't leave me this way,

no I can't survive

I can't stay alive without your love Baby,

don't leave me this way



Ahhh, baby! My heart is full of love and desire for you

So com'on down and do what you got to do

You started this fire down in my soul

Now can't you see it's burning out of control

So com'on, satisfy the need in me

'Cause only your good lovin' can set me free



Need you lovin', baby ... need it ... need it ...

Satisfy the need in me Satisfy the need in me



Well baby, come and satify the need in me

Whoa baby, come and satify the need in me

Oh baby Don't leave me this way

Don't leave me this way No,

don't leave me this way No,

Don't leave ... Don't leave me this way babe ...

Oh, baby ...

not attained through self-gratification, but through fidelity to a purpose."
-Helen Keller

"Knowledge is the reward of action... For it is by doing things that one 
becomes transformed."
-Heinrich Zimmer

"Penetrating so many secrets, we cease to believe in the unknowable.  But 
there it sits nevertheless, calmly licking its chops."

werd!

plus, if you actually learn Reason in a little bit of detail, you can get it
to do some pretty nifty things. like I got this Hammond patch from "Computer
Music" magazine (don't laugh, it came with lots of free samples) and they
also show you how to wire up the LFO from a Subtractor to emulate a rotary
speaker. (just plug it in to the pan input on the back of an NN-XT.)

bleah!!

I'm not going to an Internet party where nobody breaks the law...no matter
how much I like whoever's throwing it. :-p

besides, what if I made a hoover out of the flanged guitar riff from "Don't
Crash The Car Tonight" by Mary's Danish? what if I took a drum loop from
Jesus & Mary Chain "Sidewalking"? Obviously an Acid remix project called
"The Jesus & Mary's Danish" would catch anyone's eye, but it's very easy to
sample obscure music nobody else owns and sneak all kinds of illegal samples
into a track without ever getting caught. A split-second of the guitar
feedback at the end of Ani DiFranco's "Untouchable Face" is as easily hidden
in a track as a single pill or a tiny piece of paper is on a raver. It's
like the war on drugs - the fundamental ridiculousness of the law in
question is demonstrated by its total unenforceability.

Besides, being able to draw on obscure music nobody else owns is one of the
things that makes DJing an art form in the first place.

Well...it's a good sequencer if you like hovering over

Ex-NFL star Stepnoski: Marijuana not harmful

Athlete says he used drug throughout 13-year career

By John McFarland

ASSOCIATED PRESS

Saturday, February 22, 2003

DALLAS -- Former Dallas Cowboys offensive lineman Mark Stepnoski considers
himself living proof that long-held beliefs about marijuana are wrong.

He acknowledges smoking pot for the past 20 years, so, according to
opponents of the drug, he should be a slothful burnout with blackened
lungs, a bit of a dim bulb after baking so many brain cells.

Yet Stepnoski is articulate and remains in top physical condition a year
after finishing a 13-year career as one of the NFL's top centers -- all
while regularly smoking marijuana, he says.

He feels so strongly that purported facts about marijuana are myths that
he's dedicated his retirement time to setting the record straight.

Stepnoski, 36, recently "came out" as a weed smoker when he took the
volunteer position as president of the Texas chapter of the National
Organization for Reform of Marijuana Laws. He's bankrolling NORML's
lobbyist in Austin and has joined the organization's national advisory board.

"Marijuana doesn't prevent you from going out and accomplishing what you
want to," he said. "Since I was a kid, I wanted to play in the NFL; I
wanted to be as good as I could; I wanted to play on a winning team; I
wanted to play professional football. Even though I occasionally used
marijuana, it never prevented me from ever attaining those goals."

Stepnoski knew how to pass NFL-mandated drug tests. And although he saw
drugs ruin the lives and careers of teammates, he remains convinced that
marijuana, used responsibly, is no worse than alcohol.

He says he doesn't want children to use drugs, but he believes he should
share his views about marijuana.

"We should be truthful to kids and educate them," Stepnoski said.

Among the many areas where Stepnoski and NORML disagree with the government
are whether money is wasted enforcing marijuana laws and whether the drug
causes long-term health problems and leads to other drug use.

"It's really kind of sad that someone who could use his role as a role
model for young children chooses not to use it constructively, but to use
it for something that has caused devastation for families throughout this
country," said Jennifer de Vallance, a spokeswoman for the White House
Office of National Drug Control Policy.

Stepnoski began researching marijuana's effects shortly after he started
lighting up during his high school days in Erie, Pa.

"I was serious about training and diet and everything else," he said.
"That's one of the reasons I looked into marijuana so much, because I would
use it, and it didn't seem to have a negative effect."

He says it never did. Not once does he recall shortness of breath because
of damaged lungs or lethargy from what drug opponents call amotivational
syndrome.

"I was in the best shape of any offensive lineman we had on the team," said
Stepnoski, who won two Super Bowls, made the Pro Bowl five times and helped
clear the way for many of Emmitt Smith's NFL-record 17,162 rushing yards.

"As far as lethargy, amotivational syndrome is a myth. You can't play in
the NFL for 13 years if you have amotivational syndrome. You just can't do
it."

So how many others do it? Stepnoski, who played nine seasons with the 
Cowboys and four with
Houston/Tennessee, passes on that one.

"If you accept the fact that a sports team is a microcosm of society, then
yes, drug use exists," he said. "So does alcohol and tobacco use."

The NFL tests players with a clean drug record only once a year -- and
always during the three months before the season. Stepnoski said that made
passing the tests a breeze.

"You just quit until you take the test, and that's it; you're done," he
said. "It wasn't hard to quit because it's not addictive. I didn't cheat. I
went in and took the test. I was by the book, so people shouldn't get mad
and think I faked somebody out."

Drug use among some of Stepnoski's Dallas teammates has been
well-documented. The extreme cases include fellow linemen Mark Tuinei dying
of an overdose in 1999 and Nate Newton recently being incarcerated after
convictions for transporting large amounts of marijuana.

Stepnoski said it's not fair to lump him in with them.

Several prominent teammates from the 1990s Cowboys declined to discuss
Stepnoski's new role or didn't return calls seeking comment.

They have talked to Stepnoski, though, and he says the feedback has been
positive.

"I've not had one guy be critical of what I'm doing," he said. "I'm sure
some of them may feel that way but just don't voice their opinions."

The NFL had no comment either, except to stand behind its testing policy.

"It's somewhat more random than knowing the exact date," league spokesman
Greg Aiello said. "We have the strongest and most comprehensive drug policy
in sports."

Stepnoski got started with NORML during his playing days by making
donations to receive literature. He was asked to be more involved but knew
it was a bad idea.

"It would have been such a huge headache for me and for my teammates and my
coaches that I'd have to be crazy to do it," said Stepnoski, who agreed to
step up his involvement after the 2001 season.

Although legalization is the ultimate goal, NORML's focus in Texas is on
persuading the Legislature to downgrade possession from a Class B to a
Class C misdemeanor. That would make it about as damaging legally as a
speeding ticket.

Measures to legalize marijuana for medical reasons didn't even get out of
committee for a full vote in the Texas House the past two sessions. And
voters in November defeated marijuana law reform measures in three states:
Nevada, South Dakota and Arizona.

Even so, Stepnoski said he's confident.

"I knew this was going to be rough waters occasionally, at least publicly,"
he said. "But again, I don't feel deterred because I have the truth on my
side."

Subject: [sfraves] when do sunset parties start again...

It seems to be getting warm again... which brings to mind that
daytime Sunset parties will be starting anew soon.

Anybody know when the first one will be?

Thanks in advance.

Subject: [sfraves] chopped up organ riff mp3

http://www.neobeatnik.com/ass.mp3

this is a 14-second file. 8 bars.

the organ riff comes originally from the Charlatans UK. I played it in
Reason, chopped it up in Acid, and put it on a bed of tech-house (or more
likely tech-garage). this is not supposed to be great music, just a
demonstration of an idea. the Charlatans riff is chopped up beyond
recognition. it is essentially a new riff now.

thank you, so much...this was extra, extra thoughtful of you!!! i was thinking that i would love to have the words to this, and i am sure that a lot of other people wanted to see them too...i was singing it this morning and last night, while imagining and looking forward to the next gay pride celebration like a kid looks forward to christmas, and all the while filling in all the empty spots with humming sounds, and also, i was thinking that you might know about this anyways, and i didn't know if you read it, but i thought that if something like this were to be read by you, that it would most certainly catch your attention....i am absolutely certain that understand, and that is so wonderful and fortunate....it is just something that i am sure has to be lived and felt to be understood. :)

"Don't Leave Me This Way"

Two versions.  Thelma Houston's on a 12" in 1977 was the big disco hit.  In the same year P.I.R. (Philly International Records) released a double album with eight Tom Moulton mixes of the greatest hits of P.I.R. and of that album most of the titles were also released on a 12" promo single, also the Harold Melvin & the Blue notes classic, but in a edit version of almost eight minutes, three minutes less than the Tom Moulton album version on 'Philadelphia Classics'

i have more to say to potentially fun and fascinating people...i love to meet such kinds...i met an interesting gent yesterday who i think might do well to circulate throughout a dance event...like, he knows how people are...i was talking with him about personality disorders, and he pretended to reintroduce himself to me at one point during the conversation...he said, "wow, this is just like looking in the mirror!" and then he shook my hand and said, "hi, i am you, and you are me!" i think it would be really fun to watch him in full effect. :)

Cheese and list people in general:

Please...

Do not crosspost.  It has the potential to create heinous amounts of reply
spackle from people who don't know each other, etc.

Please post sales only once (you've posted on this lot of sales at least
three time now).  You haven't had a single bid on any of this, and you've
posted several times!

Just a tip, in regards to EBay... start low if you want to lure people in.
If you're worried about selling stuff too low, put a reserve on it, but
let people buy into something at what they would consider a deal.  Prices
rarely rise when you're asking new prices on used gear from the get go.
Bidding wars usually only happen when people who already have thought they
were gonna get something realize their purchase is in jeapordy.  The
reality is you can't sell stuff for what you want for it, but rather what
people are willing to pay.

That said, it's fair to expect about 30-60% of new value for used records,
unless you've got an original pressing of Halcyon, early Cybotron or
Powerpill or something that is known to be at least somewhat rare.  Also
of note, you should include audio shreds to indicate what people are
buying (especially in a genre like happycore, where a lot of buyers might
not have massive knowledge of what they're getting into cause they genre
dates back to at least 95 but would jump at a track if you left them a
choice sample to listen to).

Also, in the case of records... shipping one record SUCKS and keeps it
from being a good deal.  Lot the stuff up.  That way you get screwed less
by Ebay, and everybody gets a better deal as you ship 5 records to one
customer instead of one record each to 5.

just my $.02, good luck.

Ex-NFL star Stepnoski: Marijuana not harmful

Athlete says he used drug throughout 13-year career

By John McFarland

ASSOCIATED PRESS

Saturday, February 22, 2003

DALLAS -- Former Dallas Cowboys offensive lineman Mark Stepnoski =
considers=20
himself living proof that long-held beliefs about marijuana are wrong.

He acknowledges smoking pot for the past 20 years, so, according to=20
opponents of the drug, he should be a slothful burnout with blackened=20
lungs, a bit of a dim bulb after baking so many brain cells.

Yet Stepnoski is articulate and remains in top physical condition a year =

after finishing a 13-year career as one of the NFL's top centers -- all=20
while regularly smoking marijuana, he says.

He feels so strongly that purported facts about marijuana are myths that =

he's dedicated his retirement time to setting the record straight.

Stepnoski, 36, recently "came out" as a weed smoker when he took the=20
volunteer position as president of the Texas chapter of the National=20
Organization for Reform of Marijuana Laws. He's bankrolling NORML's=20
lobbyist in Austin and has joined the organization's national advisory =
board.

"Marijuana doesn't prevent you from going out and accomplishing what you =

want to," he said. "Since I was a kid, I wanted to play in the NFL; I=20
wanted to be as good as I could; I wanted to play on a winning team; I=20
wanted to play professional football. Even though I occasionally used=20
marijuana, it never prevented me from ever attaining those goals."

Stepnoski knew how to pass NFL-mandated drug tests. And although he saw=20
drugs ruin the lives and careers of teammates, he remains convinced that =

marijuana, used responsibly, is no worse than alcohol.

He says he doesn't want children to use drugs, but he believes he should =

share his views about marijuana.

"We should be truthful to kids and educate them," Stepnoski said.

Among the many areas where Stepnoski and NORML disagree with the =
government=20
are whether money is wasted enforcing marijuana laws and whether the =
drug=20
causes long-term health problems and leads to other drug use.

"It's really kind of sad that someone who could use his role as a role=20
model for young children chooses not to use it constructively, but to =
use=20
it for something that has caused devastation for families throughout =
this=20
country," said Jennifer de Vallance, a spokeswoman for the White House=20
Office of National Drug Control Policy.

Stepnoski began researching marijuana's effects shortly after he started =

lighting up during his high school days in Erie, Pa.

"I was serious about training and diet and everything else," he said.=20
"That's one of the reasons I looked into marijuana so much, because I =
would=20
use it, and it didn't seem to have a negative effect."

He says it never did. Not once does he recall shortness of breath =
because=20
of damaged lungs or lethargy from what drug opponents call amotivational =

syndrome.

"I was in the best shape of any offensive lineman we had on the team," =
said=20
Stepnoski, who won two Super Bowls, made the Pro Bowl five times and =
helped=20
clear the way for many of Emmitt Smith's NFL-record 17,162 rushing =
yards.

"As far as lethargy, amotivational syndrome is a myth. You can't play in =

the NFL for 13 years if you have amotivational syndrome. You just can't =
do=20
it."

So how many others do it? Stepnoski, who played nine seasons with the =
Cowboys and four with=20
Houston/Tennessee, passes on that one.

"If you accept the fact that a sports team is a microcosm of society, =
then=20
yes, drug use exists," he said. "So does alcohol and tobacco use."

The NFL tests players with a clean drug record only once a year -- and=20
always during the three months before the season. Stepnoski said that =
made=20
passing the tests a breeze.

"You just quit until you take the test, and that's it; you're done," he=20
said. "It wasn't hard to quit because it's not addictive. I didn't =
cheat. I=20
went in and took the test. I was by the book, so people shouldn't get =
mad=20
and think I faked somebody out."

Drug use among some of Stepnoski's Dallas teammates has been=20
well-documented. The extreme cases include fellow linemen Mark Tuinei =
dying=20
of an overdose in 1999 and Nate Newton recently being incarcerated after =

convictions for transporting large amounts of marijuana.

Stepnoski said it's not fair to lump him in with them.

Several prominent teammates from the 1990s Cowboys declined to discuss=20
Stepnoski's new role or didn't return calls seeking comment.

They have talked to Stepnoski, though, and he says the feedback has been =

positive.

"I've not had one guy be critical of what I'm doing," he said. "I'm sure =

some of them may feel that way but just don't voice their opinions."

The NFL had no comment either, except to stand behind its testing =
policy.

"It's somewhat more random than knowing the exact date," league =
spokesman=20
Greg Aiello said. "We have the strongest and most comprehensive drug =
policy=20
in sports."

Stepnoski got started with NORML during his playing days by making=20
donations to receive literature. He was asked to be more involved but =
knew=20
it was a bad idea.

"It would have been such a huge headache for me and for my teammates and =
my=20
coaches that I'd have to be crazy to do it," said Stepnoski, who agreed =
to=20
step up his involvement after the 2001 season.

Although legalization is the ultimate goal, NORML's focus in Texas is on =

persuading the Legislature to downgrade possession from a Class B to a=20
Class C misdemeanor. That would make it about as damaging legally as a=20
speeding ticket.

Measures to legalize marijuana for medical reasons didn't even get out =
of=20
committee for a full vote in the Texas House the past two sessions. And=20
voters in November defeated marijuana law reform measures in three =
states:=20
Nevada, South Dakota and Arizona.

Even so, Stepnoski said he's confident.

"I knew this was going to be rough waters occasionally, at least =
publicly,"=20
he said. "But again, I don't feel deterred because I have the truth on =
my=20

As a guy who *really tried* on an MPC2000 for at least a year...

It also gets timing hiccups when looping, crashed more often than my mac
does, maxed out at what... 32Mb of Ram and didn't allow sound loading on
the fly.  Oh, and no resampling meaning that unless you're just ganking
other people's loops... you'll need another MPC or a computer to do
anything useful with it.  Didn't import loop points when importing wav
files, not capable of playing pitches from midi input, etc.

Need I say more?

The interface is cool, I like the pads, but Akai has made those available
as a seperate device.  The clock/sampler/effects, etc for it generally
lack.  Compared to a PC, it pales... and having worked with a friend's
ASR-X as well as some keyboard based sampler/workstations I can't say it's
the strongest "all in one" unit either.

If you consider it *just* a drum machine that plays samples (with maybe a
hit and a bass sample ala hip hop), it's _SICK_ because of it's ease of
use, but as a sequencer it's weak, and as a sampler it's weak.  After
moderate wear... maybe a year of use and two visits to 2nd & jackson for
live sets, I had lines going out on the display and it had killed it's
second zip drive thanks to a SCSI control issue MPC-Headz refer to as
"CLICK OF DEATH".

The fun factor for the piece is high, I miss it from time to time, but I'm
making better music since I sold it.

no disagreements there...I sold mine too...still...this is a silly
conversation...first because not one of us actually owns an MPC...and
secondly because DJ Krust and Roni Size can sway me completely just by
showing up in a Mecca ad with one in their hands...which they've done...just
like Underworld persuaded me by having one in their stage setup...

same way I remain convinced Reason is a top-notch musical instrument,
irrespective of what anybody might say, because I've heard what Terminalhead
can do with it...

I mean yes, the MPC's less sophisticated than a software sequencer, and God
knows it's notoriously unreliable, but tons of people have made tons of
terrific records with it, haven't they?

what other metric is there?


Giles


(ps: on the other hand, it's only fair to point out that nobody has actually
spoken up to say, "you know what, I bought an MPC, and I kept it.")

Single owner Rane MP-22z for sale.

World standard mixer for banging techno/house/trance, four band EQs per
channel, rotary input select allows using one CD player on either channel
instead of vinyl, balanced outputs, active crossfader with adjustable
curve for everything from classic Rane "dipped" crossfader to modern flat
mix to aggressive scratching curves, and legendary reliability.  AUX IN
allows use of another mixer direct to outs enabling easy 2x4 setups, and
the switches on the underside can allow you to control what outputs get
the microphone... so you can pipe the vinyl mix to the monitors without
the MC's mic causing feedback.  4 pairs of outputs (main, aux1, aux2,
tape) allowing you to provide for all your output needs).  The headphone
cue is among the loudest and cleanest of and on the market, allowing
accurate monitoring in any environment.  The excellent audio specs of this
mixer and 12 LED per channel level meters make it a natural for use with
large sound systems, studio mixtape recording, or just as a quality home
dj mixer that is representative of what you'll see a lot of when you play
out.

Condition - well loved.  Spent most of it's life permanently mounted in a
heavy duty coffin (see below).  100% operational, all the labels for all
the knobs are fine, but some of the screws have lost their paint and
there's a small scratch next to the crossfader.  Great condition overall
and a great deal... the power supply connector even has the little spring
doohickey on it to keep it locked in during use.

$420 cash OBO, and if you're interested I can demo all it's features when
you pick it up (sunnyvale) and throw in a basic DJ lesson if you're new to
all of this.  Free delivery (& setup if you want help) also available.

Also for sale - Genz Benz seriously heavy duty coffin.  Not for the faint
of heart (it's pretty heavy), this coffin is the best built I've ever seen
for 2 decks and a 19" standard mixer.  $100 cash OBO.  You can buy a new
coffin for around that, but this one is built with three handles, recessed
locking hardware, 1" of insulating foam to protect your decks, and thicker
wood than I remember seeing on any other coffin (just measured it - 3/4").

Subject: [sfraves] Alex the Snow Party Stud

Alex, I'm sure I speak for everyone in giving you and your crew mad props 
for pulling off the mother of all renegades. You worked really hard and it 
was evident in the quality of the production. I overheard people saying how 
they couldn't believe this was a free party. Nice layout, minimal but 
effective decorations. Lighted walkway and blacklights were a nice touch. 
But where was the hot chocolate and cider? Did i somehow miss that. Talent 
and music was excellent and had enough diversity. So many familiar faces. 
Osby, who made the trip up with Delia, made his entrance representing the 
bay (it's always an "entrance" when osby shows up;) nice to see you and 
Delia again, Osby. Good to see both a solid SFraves and Sacraves group of 
peeps in attendance. Good times had by all.

Thank you Alex and middle ground productions for a winter wonderland 
experience of music and community. This one I won't soon forget

OK... I didn't really plan on doing 2 much on Saturday really!!  I =
mean... originally the game plan I had set up was 2 hang out w/ my Bro =

ok, i think i have an mp3 addiction.  i have 1,728

tigers.

I once heard that the Japanese guy who created Pokeman
has this disorder whereby collecting things (stones,
screws, trading cards, etc) is a compensation for
intense insecurities... thus the nature of
compulsively collecting the Pokemon cards.

i think this weekend i'm going to go out and dump some
money back into the record industry; keep the karma
going.

i'm wondering how many mp3's some of you people have.

Davis man puts his life on the line in Baghdad

By Crystal Ross O'Hara/Enterprise staff writer

A Davis native has traveled to Baghdad, volunteering to be a
human shield in case of an attack against Iraq.

Sean Logan, 22, a 1998 Davis High School graduate who has been
living in San Francisco for the past three years, arrived in
Baghdad on Feb. 16. He traveled there in a double-decker bus
from Italy with a group of about 150 human shield volunteers
from the London-based group Truth, Justice, Peace Action.

"I'm going to Baghdad to be a human shield.  Trying to stop this
war," he said in a phone message last week to his parents, Bob
and Mary Logan of Davis.  "Tell everyone not to blow up Baghdad.
I love you.  See you if I get back."

In an interview Saturday, Bob and Mary Logan said they were
shocked that their son had made it all the way to Baghdad, but
were not surprised that he would volunteer to do such a thing.

"I was afraid.  I was very sad.  I was worried," Mary Logan said.
"But then, after I got over that, I was very proud of him."

The Logans -- who include sisters Jenny, 19; Erin, 25; and
Heather, 27 -- say Sean has spent the past several years pursuing
a career in art and music while helping the homeless in San
Francisco.  His trip to Iraq is just an extension of that
community-based work, they say.

"His view of globalization is global brotherhood and he wants
to show brotherhood with the Iraqi people," Mary Logan said.

Bob Logan said his son is not a supporter of Saddam Hussein,
rather a supporter of the Iraqi people.

"Sean says an Iraqi life is as important as an American life,"
he said.

He said he does not know at this time where Sean could be placed
in the event of a war, but said it is his son's intention to
become a shield at a hospital or an orphanage.  He said Sean hopes
that by placing an American life in danger he can prevent the
American military from firing on civilian targets.

The international group's visit to Iraq is bound to be
controversial.  Ken Nichols O'Keefe, a 33-year-old Gulf War
veteran who has renounced his U.S. citizenship, organized it.

On his Web site, O'Keefe states that one of the reasons he is
returning to Iraq is "to pay penance for my participation in
the first Gulf War as a U.S. Marine and personally apologize
to the Iraqi people."

U.S. government officials have harshly criticized Iraqi leader
Saddam Hussein's use of human shields during the Gulf War.  At
a news conference Wednesday, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld
said Saddam often constructs military facilities near hospitals,
schools and orphanages.

"Deploying human shields is not a military strategy, it's murder,
a violation of the laws of armed conflict, and a crime against
humanity, and it will be treated as such," Rumsfeld said.

At the same news conference, Gen. Richard Meyers, chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said any use of human shields would
be considered a war crime, even if those shields were volunteers.

"(If) death or serious injury to a noncombatant resulted from
these efforts, the individuals responsible for deploying any
innocent civilians as human shields could be guilty of grave
breaches of the Geneva Conventions," Meyers said.

The Logans hope their son will never have to be used in that
way.

"He just wanted to go there to try to stop the war by bringing
attention to it," Bob Logan said.

The Logans have not spoken to their son since he arrived in
Baghdad.  However, messages can be sent to him through the TJP
Action Web site at www.humanshields.org by clicking on the
"feedback" button on the left side of the page.

Don't fret Boomy. My collection of mp3's is nearly 40gigs now. That's
somewhere around 6,000+ files. I used to work at a .com where we were a
content delivery network for the music industry so I made use of that and
grabbed lots of music. I'm going to start encoding my entire cd collection
to MP3 soon as well. It's just a convenience factor. 60% of my cd's are in a
giant box that acts as my printer stand right now. Seems like a waste so
encoding to MP3 I go!

	Living up here in Oregon we go crazy about outdoor party sites
being clean. There are activist groups that will picket events thrown by
people who are known to litter the forest. It is tough to keep
everything in your pockets especially trash we hold the promoters up
here responsible for leaving locations as clean as they were found. It
is very important especially in this day and age where a camera crew is
looking for any way to bash this scene of ours. We usually pack out one
or two full size trucks loaded with trash after events most of the trash
is even left by loggers. Just a few thoughts. Peace

Subject: RE: [sfraves] mp3 addiction (nrr)

I hear ya.. I've got 2200 songs in my Final Scratch directory alone and
that's not everything from all the hard drives in the house.  I spent at
least 15 hours this weekend copying, organizing etc of my MP3's and I'm
still only halfway done. 

A few months back I definitely started getting over the 'I'm fucking
over the RIAA, YAY' and realized that a lot of the music I have is
independent/weird stuff and have started purchasing albums from those
who I really like that I've downloaded over the past 3 and a half years
of broadband abuse.  That and I typically buy at community shops instead
of the major conglomerates unless I can't find it anywhere else.  With
more of our money going overseas to 5 consultants for the price of 1
american worker, I'm trying to stop giving money to multinational
corporations as much as possible and keep the money in our local
communities because..  Well.. With 500k jobs being lost to automation
every year from the late 70's and now people losing their jobs to people
who are insanely dedicated workers in poorer countries, we're not going
to have much money in the lower class pockets here anymore.  If anyone
has read anything about the flow of money throughout history, I think
we're about to hit another major change as the flow jumps east again and
will have gone full circle back to Asia.  Interesting times...

Don't fret Boomy. My collection of mp3's is nearly 40gigs now. That's
somewhere around 6,000+ files. I used to work at a .com where we were a
content delivery network for the music industry so I made use of that
and grabbed lots of music. I'm going to start encoding my entire cd
collection to MP3 soon as well. It's just a convenience factor. 60% of
my cd's are in a giant box that acts as my printer stand right now.
Seems like a waste so encoding to MP3 I go!

ok, i think i have an mp3 addiction.  i have 1,728

I once heard that the Japanese guy who created Pokeman
has this disorder whereby collecting things (stones,
screws, trading cards, etc) is a compensation for
intense insecurities... thus the nature of
compulsively collecting the Pokemon cards.

i think this weekend i'm going to go out and dump some
money back into the record industry; keep the karma
going.

i'm wondering how many mp3's some of you people have.

peace,

PS:  a cool keyword to search for mp3's is "white
label."  sometimes you get good stuff.

Yeah yeah-we all know it can be done-but what's the point really?
So I sample something and pitch it and twist it until it's a squealing blip.
Well yay-I prolly coulda made that same squealing blip in other ways-
And unless you get off on telling people about how you sampled some noise and mangled it, I see no need to do that at all.
Sure-if you *really* have to you probably could, and nobody would ever catch you-yay.But maybe you'd like to challenge yourself?
Just this once?
The point of Andy's statement above is right there-it's liability.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] mp3 addiction (nrr)

I'm waiting for the day when solid state drives are huge and cheap
before I do anything like that.  With movable parts hard drives are
still too unstable for me to devote myself to them completely.  Unless
you have a raid array, putting everything on hard disk with no real way
to be able to back it all up is really taking a chance.

As for personal radio I've fallen in love with the Launch.com service
offered by Yahoo.  They don't have everything available by the artists
but the selection they have is amazing.  You configure your station how
you want by rating songs, it will throw in random songs from similar
artists you haven't configured yet etc and you slowly build youself a
station that fits you and your tastes.  They also just added a moods
feature that allows you to play music based on your moods as opposed to
playing everything from your interests.  The free service has a 15 - 30
second commecial about every 8 songs and it is really not annoying at
all, and the pay service is pretty cheap if you want to get rid of
commercials and take advantage of a few more features.

Here's the link to my station that I have configured so you can take a
look at what you can do with it.  I have very eclectic tastes that are
definitely reflected here.

Subject: [sfraves] Thanks for the snow party Alex - top job.

I totally agree - this was an awesome event. Two things I love, the woods and jungle in the same place, with a great crowd. Great lineup of djs, and three 'rooms' of music to please any punter. I think this is closest thing I have found yet to 'the rave experience', and am very glad that during my time in the US I was able to get out to this event. Totally great event, and the icey roads where worth the struggle. I especially liked DJ EMP's set with the jungle - I liked his throwing down the reggae for a bit, and I can honestly say I haven't seen a DJ having that much fun behind the decks in a long time.

Will definitely get out to Sacto with a few aussie mates as soon as possible.

Matt.

[next time I go to the snow however, I will endeavour to remember shoes - wrapping my feet in clothes and plastic bag did the trick as I still have all 10 toes, but it was might uncomfortable for a long time, and when I stepped in a pool of mud, that would have to have been the lowpoint of the night. However was worth it for the comical value of having one dude allegedly say "I thought he was a giant bug"]

Subject: [sfraves] Tech Help Please

	I inherited a computer from my dad a little while ago. My dad
works for IBM and could not find help from his co-workers so now I turn
to you. Every time I log on to the internet through my USB DSL Modem
after 30 seconds the connection is lost. My dad had the same exact
problem and was not able to figure it out. I would love to solve this
problem seeing as the system has a lot more memory and is a lot faster
than my current system. This system is an AMD with a 1gightz processor
and 60 gig hard drive. My dad had installed a motherboard and removed a
virus before this happened. He does not have the CD to reformat
everything so I have not been able to reformat everything. So please
help I am in Portland if you come up here to visit I'll buy you some
very good beer and take you to dinner for a good answer. Peace

Online backup services are cheap-$29.95/month for 500gb or so-

And solid-state is kinda a misnomer for the current state of flash-
It still has the same old "limited writes" issues, and it's still sensitive to static...

A friend of mine has a 40GB external hard drive and 15GB on an internal 
PowerBook drive full and will soon be in need of another. He's been 
collecting them for a while. Got lots off of Hotline back before Napster. 
Then got lots in the Napster Days. Then got lots during the excellent 
AudioGalaxy days. Now he uses LimeWire. he's on a Mac so it's a bit 
different than using PC methods.

He also decided that having racks of CDs was waste of physical space in his 
immediate living environs, so he ripped them all and began selling them back 
to record stores. Often he'll take advantage of the 70%  no questions asked 
return policy at Ameoba. He says it drastically reduces the amount of money 
he has to spend to pick up new music on CDs. He also likes to borrow CDs 
from friends and rip them.

He says he really believes in what he calls the "digital entertainment box". 
He longs for the future he envisions when he will be able keep all his media 
(music, movies, books, magazines, games) all in one small box (a hard drive) 
and use various portable output devices (ipod, laptop, eBook, PDA,  etc.) to 
enjoy them. He says it reduces the physical clutter in his life and is also 
better for the environment. He's not attached to the physical material of 
media product. He says there is just too damn much of it to get sentimental 
about cover art, liner notes, and packaging. He just loves the music.

I think he's basically trying to recreate what I call his "own personal 
radio". Since radio now sucks more than it ever has, he is trying to replace 
the magic that it might of once held for him. He says "There's just 
something though about having a little magic box that emanates forth such 
beautiful sounds."

He likes it this way. Ain't technology great?

I'd start with your DSL provider's support web site, and then call them if
necessary to resolve the problem. It could be a number of things.

you would have to tweak the dsl/modem settings to timeout longer than 30
secs. when idle.... also best way to do away w/ dsl is to have a
router/server installed so that you won't have to use the DSL software, just
me 2cents... hope this helps

There's no reason why this shouldn't be a problem, except that you're
at the mercy of whatever audio chip is installed in the laptop. Unfortunately
laptop audio tends to sound pretty bad (it'll pickup all sorts of
"computer" sounding audio noise); also, the drivers available may
not be able to get you the low level of latency you need. If you
are planning on using the laptop's internal sound, make sure at least
WDM drivers are available. Also turn off all windows sounds as
this will cause potential contention (dropouts) as well as hearing
windows sounds in your music. A better bet is an external audio
I/O over firewire (which is fast and isolates the audio from computer noise).
I believe MOTU, Roland and one other manufacturer whose name I forget
have firewire-based external audio interfaces. There's also USB interfaces
but they may not be glitch-free or low-latency.

I have successfully used A Dell Inspiron 4100 (1.2G PIII-M, 256M,
running Win2K, MOTU 828 firewire audio attached to an ADS Pyro
Cardbus firewire card. I am able to get less than 10 mS latency
using Sonar in this setup (using WDM drivers).
In Sonar 2.2, you can also get ASIO driver support (which is also
supported by the MOTU 828 2.0 drivers), which can potentially
give you as low as 2.2 mS latency (using 96 sample buffer in the 828).

Of course, your results may vary, depending on how many DXi plugins you
use, etc. Disk speed, sample rates  and bitwidth of tracks you're mixing,
etc etc etc. I havent tried using Rewire or reason 2.0 in Sonar, so that may
be an additional source of slowness. (Is there any reason why the Cyclone
DXi or Cakewalk's upcoming "project 5" won't substitute for Reason?)

Nowadays, you can prolly do well with a more modern laptop (say 2Ghz P4-M).
Try getting at least 5000+RPM ATA-100 drives ((7200 if available), and make
sure the bus is fast (you should be able to find 300+Mhz bus laptops now).
Also, you might consider getting one of those "desktop replacement" laptops
that uses a regular P4 and regular bus... this may get you better disk/memory
and processor bandwidth, which underlies the performance you'll see doing
audio on a computer.

I just started using Sonar 2.2 with the same (external) MOTU 828 and MOTU 
MTP-AV interfaces on a 3.05Ghz P4 desktop with 1G of RamBus (PC 1066) Ram, 
533Mhz bus, 7200 RPM ATA-100, drives, Windows XP Pro, and things are a lot 
smoother and less limited feeling than on the laptop.  By using external Audio 
and MIDI interfaces, I can use the same hardware on my laptop as I do on my 
desktop.

Bottom line: you'll need every ounce of processing power, memory bandwidth,
disk I/O and memory for doing audio. So unless you want to waste a lot of
time and incur a lot of frustration, go out and buy the fastest available...

PS: if anybody needs help getting desktop or laptop audio working, or needs
to tap into my vast expertise in making computer audio work successfully
with Windows, I am available for consulting on all aspects of Windows
based audio and multimedia. :-)

Yes it works, The laptop studio is quite a reality
now. With a Midiman quatro soundcard and oxygen8 midi
controller, I feel I can do anything I could with a
full rack of gear, but without all the hastle of
cords, space, sync, and cost. I'm running a p4 @2ghz
laptop and having great results. There is a p4 cpu
spike bug that's quite annoying, but I haven't lost
any work so might want to check out an athlon cpu as
well. Mine has 500megs of DDR ram and a 40 gig HD.
Also, there is a program called Orion out there, that
IMHO clowns on reason, but will rewire it if you so
desire. Reason's sequencer and lack of Vsti support
make it undesireable for me. Here's a track I did
completely on orion, it will stream if you have real
audio.

Subject: [sfraves] Snow Party

I just wanted to say that I had a great time at the
snowparty as well. The vibe was positive, beats were
bumpin, lights were nice. I left with all my fingers
and toes, although I did blow a subwoofer. :( Thanks
to all that came and supported the house soundsystem
in the middle, and the party in general. My girl and I
had a blast playing for you. My only gripe about the
whole thing was the trash situation. Hopefully this
gets addressed for the next one...I'd hate to ruin
this spot, as it is DOPE as hell!

Peace and beatz,
Gabriel

Subject: [sfraves] Whats in yer rig???

Hey gear freaks,

After following several threads about the pros and cons of certain equipment 
out there I noticed that there are a boatload of peeps on the list with a 
bunch of gear. Rather than argue over what piece of gear or software is the 
best I thought it would be cool to see what people out there are using in 
their rigs. I just got done with a remodel /addition on my house and had the 
opportunity  to design a dedicated room for all my equipment complete with 
soundproofed walls and sound treatments for the floor and ceiling. There are 
also auralex bass traps and foam wedges placed throughout the room for 
optimal sound. I currently get roughly 70 db of noise reduction from the 
sound proofing. The entire room has a dedicated power line seperate from the 
rest of the house to prevent any natsy surges or dips. Almost all my old 
analog stuff has been sold, I sampled everything I need, to give me more 
work space. The room dimensions are  12 x 18. I'd love to compare notes.

Here is a roster of the current rig

computer: apple dual g4/1ghz, apple dual g4/450, (2) 18 gb seagate barracuda 
external drive

sychcronizer, mtp av motu midi interface, 2408 mk3 pci digital recording 
system, 24 io motu interface
power conditioning: furman pl - plus
microphones: audio technica at 4047, audio technica at 4041, audix 
hypercardioid drum mic dp1
mic preamps: presonus digitube digital mk preamp, aphex dual channel tube 
mic preamp
effects/ outboard: cl 44 presonus compressor/limiter, tla50  summit audio 
leveling amp, 882 bbe sonic maximizer, 2231 dbx dual 31 band graphic eq, 
studioquad 4 digitech multi effects processor, mpx 200 lexicon 2ch effects

midi controler, emu launch pad.

peak, recycle, apogee session tools, applied acoustics lounge lizard, 
antares kantos, reason 2.0, rebirth, Native instruments absynth, ni b3, pro

privately and we can chat.

but this one goes to 11,
DJMC

If you missed them in Monterey this past weekend, you'll be able to catch
Hidro-Ponik and JQ tonight at Secret Psychedelica. By far, their 2x4 set was
the highlight of Impulse so let's see how they will outperform themselves

your right....creates new memories without the fright...just the same though, the music has got to have good vocals, if there are vocals...seriously.....no more wailing just to demonstrate technique or ability to deafen an audience...it's gotta roll right through you. :)

Wow-you targeted the right list-there's so many unemplowed sysadmins around here that I'm certain you'll be able to find someone who can help you.

Does $75/hr sound appropriate?
I'd estimate this as a 2-3 hour job.

Uhm-howdy over-generalization.

You want to wank around with advice like "USB modem = sux0r" for a month-go ahead.
You want to fix the shit? Prepare to pay :)

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: FS: computer parts (good stuff!)

I have a bunch of computer parts I want to get rid of.  I figure that there
are better uses than just sitting around my house in a drawer.

Make me offers on all of it - I'd rather see it go to SF people and music
nuts, than to random people, or worse to waste.

* 2x Intel P-III Tualatim 1.4 GHz CPUs
* 1 Intel P-III Coppermine 733 MHz CPU
* 1 Intel P-III Coppermine 850 MHz CPU
* 1 21" Optiquest (Viewsonic OEM) monitor

A bunch of 20 GB hard disks

Possibly:

* 1 Full PC guts:
   Dual P-III motherboard (Iwill DVD266u-RN)
   2x 1.26 GHz (overclockable) CPUs with good fans
   512 MB PC2100 DDR (Crucial) memory
   300W ATX power supply
   maybe an 80 GB disk
   maybe a Leadtek WinFast (GeForce) AGP 4x video card


If anyone is interested, drop me a line privately.  I have an idea of what
I'd like to get for some of these (some will go for almost nothing), but I
want to hear what people want to offer.  I'm open minded to trades or really
good excuses. :)

Tim

dee.jay :: missed.cue

It was all because of a turntable tease distracting me! She was just so
yummy and next thing I knew the music stopped, the crowd went silent and I
looked stupid as hell. So that's how I became DJ Missed Cue.

normally I go by dj.fukoffandi

I wouldn't have spoiled the fun if the tool that built this thing had
done it right, BTW... (a bunch of consecutive if statements in a tight
loop instead of a switch? or even using a else? no variable scoping?
references to form elements from the document collection? wtf?) I'm sure
this very thing's been done well before -- I just wonder why *this* one
ended up getting forwarded to three separate lists I'm on... /sigh/.

anyone else who helped out with this party thank you
for a good time.  i was so happy to party with y'all,

was nice to hear dragnfly again...and alex's beats in
the morning were the perfect ending. This has been
definitely the best party i have been to this year,

permanent smile on my face:) Very well done. thank you

Subject: Re: [sfraves] --Sorry!--- Snow Party

Sorry for what???? Gab, Alex and the rest of your crew get MAD PROPS from this old timer. I got to hear some of my most favorite DJ's spin, except for Araida who's time slot was change. BOO HOO. 
 I hope people picked up after themselves, ya right.
Oh well, I know how hard it is to do FREE parties.
Like the Full Moons we did in the past.A lot of work, a few hours of fun, then a sore back from lugging sound. But in the end, I'm sure people took a part of your hard work with them home with that warm fuzzy feeling from a good party.
Keep up the good work and lets talk about doing one or two Full Moon parties together.
Until next time
Peace

Subject: [sfraves] signing off for a bit

To all the people who know me, I've been busy with lots of dancing(styles 
other than raving) and school. Besides I am completely broke, so I cant come 
raving down to the bay as I used to over fall of last year.
If you know me, you have this email address to write me over time.
Someday soon, I shall be back!

As far as I know, Secret Society still happens. However, it now happens on
Thursdays... Secret Psychadelica happens on the last Monday (I think) of
the month... and that Monday is tonight. Both are still at Club Savoy in
SC. I'll be there tonight.. hopefully I'll see some of you out there :)

Subject: please read : KJ needs help!

Friends,

A lot of you know our dear friend and
member of the Eyephunk family...

       KJ is facing deportation to Pakistan.

As he is Hindu (it is a Muslim country)
and he is gay (they do allow for stoning homosexuals to death)
he is sure to face extreme consequences if this happens.
He is seeking political asylum.

        This is not a joke.
        We are asking for your help!!


Information on how you can help is up at this address:

         http://www.eyephunk.com/kj/


Again, we are asking our community for help to support
our brother KJ who has touched so many people...
and has done so much for his greater American
community, not just San Francisco.

Will you please take a moment to write some words
to support his claim of political asylum?
It could save his life.

A short letter or long letter, any letter will do.
We are deeply distressed about this situation,
as you can imagine.

Thank you.

Sincerely,
Anna, Adam, Dave 'Dov', Stacey, Dave 'Vajra',
Kary, Liam, Ashley, Cyril and Surge

Source: An e-mail from a young gay man in Pakistan 1/02

To be gay in Pakistani and community is considered a gross abuse as well as
a mortal sin as terrible religion Islam holds extremely hostile policy
towards gays as according to so called Islamic scholars "if gays are caught
red handed they must be be headed, stoned to death or thrown from the
highest peak of lofty mountain to eradicate this inclination. (according to
panal code of Pakistan.)

In Pakistan, the Homosexual activity is illegal, punishable with life in
prison, and corporal punishment of 100 lashes, while Islamic law, which also
can be enforced legally, calls for up to 100 lashes or death by stoning. (a
report by an international human rights commission about hmosexuality in
Pakistan.)

Thursdays... Secret Psychadelica happens on the last Monday (I think) of
the month... and that Monday is tonight. Both are still at Club Savoy in
SC. I'll be there tonight.. hopefully I'll see some of you out there :)

Subject: RE: [sfraves] mp3 addiction (nrr)

Yeah, I'm around 7,000 or so right now, but its only because I've been
'collecting' MP3s for about eight years now. This was back in the day of
the more private FTP sites and before Napster. 

	While I love having the different genres to suit all my moods,
finding a song I haven't heard in a long time or one that brings me back
to a memory is worth much more than any amount of songs....its all about
quality..

Sometimes truth is loud, and the other times it is very silent, but no

"Why of course the people don't want war. . . .

That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who
determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people
along, whether it is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a
parliament, or a communist dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the people can
always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have
to do is tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the peacemakers for
lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same in
any country."

we know things about you that your mother and father didn't tell you.

we know things about you that you father hasn't even told your mom, and
vice versa.

it is the burden that is associated with an incredimail account.  don't
worry.  all will reveal itself in the future.

hey kids,
we have a 2-day lift ticket for Heavenly ($118 value) that expires 
friday. if you're interested in using it, let me know. i'm thinking $40 
is fair... even if you used it 1 day only, you'd still be saving $19.

email or call me ASAP: 415.255.9776

Does anybody have any recommendations and/or pointers
for open-source (preferably GPL)
visualization and beat-extraction tools similar to arkaos.net?

I'm more interested in working code and demo programs, rather
than finished "user experiences." Of course, an open source
version of arkaos.net would be cool too.... :-)

Actually, there's a bunch of folks doing this here in the Bay area.

We've got an event coming up in May with classes in how to integrate Arkoas
VJ together with Reason2 to do audiovisual performances.

I'm also working right now with Arkoas & Traktor DJ studio for all digital
mixing...

Sure: MaxMSP w/ Jitter is what you're looking for.

They're not "demos" - they're very robust and powerful. Migurski should be
popping up with his take on this =3DP

I'm sure if you're really into code, you could talk with some of the
different developers. There's about 2 dozen different VJ programs on the
market right now. Most made by 1-2 man teams.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] mp3 addiction (nrr)


I have about 40 gigs of music but I have lost the lust for MP3's.
I really miss reading liner notes. Holding a record jacket or cd case and
feeling the packaging. There is a vibe/connection to the music.
One big victim of Mp3 proliferation will be those authors of liner notes.
Though I expect that they can not make money while they make art somewhere
else.

That said, I wish some folk would move over to "Win MX" cause there isn't a
large enough selection of Underground music.(of all genres)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Whats in yer rig???

well...since everyone else is doing it...Here's my gear list:

I've toned it down a lot now that the computer can do many things better 
than some of the old outboard gear I used to have.

Computer:
Apple Mac Dual 1Ghz w/768Mb RAM 2X100Gb Drives

Audio Interface:
MOTU 828 Firewire

MIDI Interface:
MOTU MIDI Express USB (Finally had to get rid of the Opcode Studio 5 LX)

Software: I'm currently going back and forth between OS9 and OSX (until OSX 
is fully up to speed for audio)
OS9:
Cubase VST 5.1
Reason 2 (rewired into Cubase, mostly for the dope sampler)
Absynth
NI Pro52
Waldorf PPG Wave 2.v
ReCycle 2
Peak 3
TRacks/24
TC VST Plug-ins
Various other VST plug-ins
OSX:
Cubase SX
Reason 2.0 (Rewired into Cubase SX, mostly for the dope sampler)
Peak 3.x

Monitors:
Event Tria system

Keyboards:
Nord Lead 2
Kawai K5000s
Emu EMAX SE (Old school, baby!)

Mixer:
Yamaha 12/4

Outboard Gear:
Roland Space Echo RE201 (That was made in 1974!)
Alesis compressor (good only for using compression and gate as a mixer 
insert effect)
2 Patch bays

Turntables & DJ Mixer:
2x1200 mk2
Vestax 07Pro

Expect to hear some new tracks very soon.


Cheers,
-Proxy

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Whats in yer rig???

speaking of keyboards, i'm trying to sell mine. it's a
yamaha midi keyboard psr-240, slightly used but in
excellent working condition. 

you can check out the specs on it here:

http://www.epinions.com/inst-Portable-PSR240_Portable_Keyboard/display_~full_specs

amazon sells it for $117, i'm asking $50 for it. and
it does not have a power cable or any other cables
with it.

however, i *will* throw in, at no extra charge, one
falling-apart POS keyboard stand.  that's optional
tho. :P  and i'm pretty sure i have the instruction
manual somewheres.

if anyone is interested, please drop me a line...

:)sooz

Subject: RE: [sfraves] mp3 addiction (nrr)

i know what you mean.. i listen to music of my computer more than i do my 
decks. but the incentive of free is too compelling. I've found soo many 
artists and such diversity with internet music and the fact that it is free 
and in the comfort of my home has outweighed record and cd shopping.

Hey Everyone!

For anyone who knows Beau (Kir Kryyn), he's going to be down this weekend.
I'm going to attempt to a dinner together for him and I am inviting those
good friends out there to come on out.  We're not sure where we'll be going,
who or what, but please let me know so we can get something together.  :o)

Subject: [sfraves] NRR:  Repeal Higher Education Act Drug Provision

--=====================_2429113==_.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

  ---- http://www.RaiseYourVoice.com ----


With the 108th Congress upon us and Reauthorization of the
Higher Education Act being worked on now, we at the Drug Reform
Coordination Network are writing to ask you to help turn up the
heat on the student-led campaign to repeal the Higher Education
Act's drug provision (http://www.RaiseYourVoice.com).


During the 2001-2002 school year, more than 47,700 students were
denied access to federal college aid because of drug
convictions, loans, grants, even work-study programs.  This
number doesn't account for people who didn't bother applying
because they assumed they would be ineligible.  The current
academic year, the third in which the drug provision is in force
and the second in which it is being fully enforced, is expected
to see just as many young people forced out of school or they or
their families plunged into financial hardship because of the
HEA drug provision.


In February of 2003, Rep. Barney Frank (D-MA) reintroduced his
legislation to repeal the drug provision in full.  Last year,
the bill had garnered 67 cosponsors, and 10 members of Congress
spoke at a press conference at the US Capitol organized by the
DRCNet-sponsored Coalition for Higher Education Act Reform.
Already, the new Frank bill, H.R. 685, has picked up 40
cosponsors, and Students for Sensible Drug Policy now stretches
across more than 200 campuses, with hundreds more in the works,
a formidable force turning up the heat on this issue.  Your help
is needed to meet and exceed the support the bill had last year
and to go on to get the drug provision repealed.  The most
likely opportunity for that is the Higher Education Act
reauthorization process.


Please visit http://www.RaiseYourVoice.com to write Congress,
learn about the issue and download our newly-updated activist
packet.  (Hit reload or refresh on your browser if you get a
"campaign expired" message.)  When you're done, please call your
Representative on the phone to make an even stronger impact --
you can use the Congressional switchboard at (202) 224-3121, or
visit http://www.house.gov to look up their direct numbers.

Notice that part of this press release, which came out two days ago,
refers to an operation that took place in January 2000. The DEA is trying
to inflate the numbers by adding numbers from an old bust to the new one,
basically.

Also, check out this piece in the New York Times that's obviously based on
the DEA press release:

http://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/24/politics/24CND-DRUG.html

It's even more inflammatory, using terms like "school highliters" which
weren't in the original press release. And they unquestioningly report
Ashcroft's propaganda:

> But Mr. Ashcroft, joined by the head of the D.E.A. and the White House
> drug czar, said the rising ease with which young people could get
> their hands on paraphernalia was a growing concern to him and others in
> the administration.

Where is the fact checking on that quote? How about some statistics that
would actually show that sales of paraphernalia were up? Bah.

The government is trying to attack marijuana from every angle. It's so sad
because they know it's not that bad for you but still they try and make
people think it is as bad as crack. Has anyone seen those set of commercials
about pot? In one commercial they show a girl about to get raped and
she is so fucked up she cant get the guy away from her. That is bull shit if
I have ever seen bull shit, there is no way in hell anyone could ever
get that fucked up on some god damn pot. Damn them all to hell!!

"Drug pipe" -- That's just PRICELESS! Pray tell, Mr. Ashcroft, what
purpose does a pipe serve besides smoking drugs (regardless of the
legality of those drugs -- e.g. tobacco)? Hey, while we're at it, let's
put all those pharmaceutical equipment companies out of business because
they're making needles we could use to shoot up ILLEGAL DRUGS!

Or perhaps they should embed microchips in government-approved pipes,
needles and straws that cut off the flow of substances when traces of
illegal material are detected! That'll stop those EVIL NO-GOOD DRUG
ADDICTS!

Fuck this, I'm moving to Canada.

Ok, the ad that gets me is,

You see a girl looking concerned, Her parents are standing there looking at
something, you see that they are looking at a pregnancy test; their little
girl is pregnant. Then the voice over, Marijuana can impair your judgment

Ads like this warning against the dangers of alcohol would do *much* more
good. But then, the alcohol lobby is very powerful and has lots of cash...

Content-type: text/plain; charset="ISO-8859-1"
Content-transfer-encoding: quoted-printable

Leftover stock from Compound Records=8B around 100 records per box for $50/bo=
x
(this is around $0.50/record!!).  No sorting through records, you can only
choose by letter of the alphabet.  There may be multiples of a title in a
box but at these prices who cares? Practice doubles, give one to a friend,
make an ashtray, or play frisbee.  Condition of records is fair to good.
Records located around Mission & Duboce in SF.  First come first served,
around 10 boxes available.

Thanks,
Evan

Drug paraphernalia...I don't think so.  I bought the gas mask with pipe at 
the same time I loaded up on duct tape.  Figure I can smoke cigs even in a 
bio attack.

I really don't appreciate continuing to receive spam from PCDJ. After
unsubscribing a few times, I just received yet another piece of spam
about an event in Florida (I live in SF, I have no interest in FLA).
I hit the unsubscribe button and it indicates I've already unsubscribed.
Nonetheless, I am still receiving spam from PCDJ.

Furthermore, I am also receiving significant spam from PCDJ "affiliates"
which doesn't seem to be stopping either. Your affiliate spam is complete
nonsense and has nothing to do with my interests. It's just generic spam.

If this doesn't stop, I will start putting out mass warnings against PCDJ
on many of the major rave lists and newsgroups, stating that you sell your
mailing list names to spammers. This is totally wrong.

At this point, I am so annoyed w/ PCDJ that I will never buy any products
from your company or your affiliates, and I will tell anybody I know
that your company is spam-scum.

By the way, I am a Native Instruments Traktor user currently, and
that product is far superior to anything you spam-happy clowns could
ever produce. In addition to great products, N.I. also has a sense of
ethics about the private information they gather from customers. The
mailings I get from them are pertinent and wanted because they're
strictly related to the products in which I've expressed interest.

PS: Deriving revenue from spam is not a business model. It's just cheezy.

--=====================_11028237==_.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

Subject: Join me in a Virtual March on Washington


Please join me NOW in registering for a Virtual March on Washington
today, February 26th.  We are asking Congress to stop the Bush
administration's rush to war, and to Let the Inspections Work.
Time is running out.

With your help every Senate office will receive
a call EVERY MINUTE from a constituent, as they receive a
simultaneous crush of faxes and email.  In New York and Washington
D.C., "antiwar rooms" will highlight the progress of the day for
national media. Local media will visit the "antiwar room" online,
to monitor this constituent march throughout the day.

With your help, every Senate office switchboard will be lit up all
day with our antiwar messages. This will be a powerful reminder
of the breadth and depth of opposition to a war in Iraq.

Just go to:


    http://www.moveon.org/winwithoutwar/

Please join me and sign up now.  This has never been done
before.

Subject: [sfraves] Paradoxical BSPs

Isn't it sort of paradoxical to what electronic dance music is when 
one bills the talent of an electronic dance music event as a "techno 
pioneer" or "originator of house".

It seems to me that electronic dance music has always been about 
what's happening with the sound RIGHT NOW or maybe even whats ABOUT 
TO HAPPEN or even what's happening TOMORROW.

The above phrases seem to me to harken to something old.

I know phrases like "pioneer" or "originator" are meant to connote a 
certain amount of genuine-ness about the person or music involved. 
Still, I expect that before these talents were pioneers or 
originators it was something else that made the kids flock to see and 
hear them, not any conferred status of "pioneer" or "originator".

It seems so normal to promote things like this that I'd be shocked if 
saw a BSP that told me I was gonna see or hear something I've never 
seen or heard before. In other words, how about a BSP that promotes 
something new instead of something old?

So jaded, I'm not jaded.

Operation Pipe Dreams Is a Nightmare

By Debra McCorkle, AlterNet
February 25, 2003

People selling drug paraphernalia are in essence no different than drug=20
dealers. They are as much a part of drug trafficking as silencers are a=20
part of criminal homicide.
=96 John Brown, acting DEA chief

I'd like to direct Mr. Brown to the Web site of revelationarms.com of=20
Aloha, Oregon. Not only will they sell me a gun silencer, there is an=20
entire page devoted to explicit directions on how to obtain the necessary=20
paperwork and background check in order to allow me to purchase a silencer=
=20
online. I have to be at least 21 and innocent of any felony crime. One=20
credit card payment and a little paperwork and I can blow someone's head=20
off with a minimum of personal hearing damage.

Of course John Brown, of the Drug Enforcement Agency, has little interest=20
in guns and murder outside of the world of drug dealing. In the last couple=
=20
of days, however, he has overseen the arrest of at least 55 people whose=20
only stated crime was the manufacture and selling of tobacco accessories.=20
His equation of bong-makers with drug traffickers is ludicrous at best, and=
=20
his apparent indifference to the legal sale of silencers across America=20
makes him a hypocrite caught in his own words.

This action, known as Operation Pipe Dreams, is part of a continuing effort=
=20
on the the part of Attorney General John Ashcroft to rid our land of the=20
ability to smoke weed with a little style. In the past 10 years the=20
pipemaking industry took an art class and began to integrate aesthetics=20
into the production line. Handblown glass pipes began as a one-of-a-kind=20
art form created usually by twentysomethings with talent and time on their=
=20
hands. Over the years pipes became amazingly elaborate, with high-end=20
waterpipes evolving into colorful gothic cathedrals. Simple $20=20
spoon-shaped pocket handpipes became the common smoking apparatus of=20
choice, replacing decades of utilitarian metal and acrylic.

However, the powers-that-be want a return to the paraphernalia stone age.=20
If the DEA has its way, that loathsome scum of an American subculture who=20
still dare to believe that smoking various herbal substances is their own=20
damned business will be forced back into stealing plumbing screens from=20
their faucets and emptying out plastic honey bears in order to fashion=20
crude waterpipes a la Brad Pitt in the movie "True Romance." Pepsi cans and=
=20
beer bottles will be pulled out of trashcans, aquarium tubing will be=20
purchased at Wal-Mart, and lamp parts from Home Depot will turn into pipe=20
bowls for the waterpipes that will be Rube Goldberged into existence.

Americans have been given the distinct impression that our federal budget=20
is strapped for cash and that we need all resources to ferret out the=20
terrorists in our midst. It seems a waste of resources to carry out=20
Operation Pipe Dreams in order to ensure that 55 pipesellers will no longer=
=20
be on the streets while terrorist cells await their orders in the heartland=
=20
of America. Doesn't Ashcroft have better things to do? What about those=20
darned silencers all over the internet?

In the meantime, lives are being ruined. Many if not most paraphernalia=20
dealers are under 40 years old and guiltier of being young and na=EFve than=
=20
of being dangerous. If forfeiture occurs there may not be enough money for=
=20
their families to hire top-notch lawyers. In a recent conviction Chris Hill=
=20
of Chills Pipes was sentenced to one year at the Eglin prison facility, and=
=20
Hill was one of the wealthier pipe manufacturers in the U.S. Pipe dealers=20
have not made their profits from stealing or acts of violence. It is an odd=
=20
choice on the part of the U.S. government to convict young entrepenuers and=
=20
house them in prisons at great taxpayer expense.

Over at impactguns.com there's a virtual cornucopia of submachine guns,=20
some with silencers, some without. There's an HK MP5 A3 machine gun=20
transferable 9mm in excellent condition on sale for $8,800. Oh darn, it's=20
got a "Sold" sign by the price. The top of the page states: "Machine guns=20
are a specialty here at Impact. They are very easy to purchase and are a=20
great investment."

If only our forefathers had the insight to put in an amendment for smoking=
=20
accessories right there with the right to bear arms. Maybe then John=20
Ashcroft and his DEA buddies could just sit around the fire with Tommy=20
Chong and the other paraphernalia company owners, and their only pipe=20
dreams would be world peace.

That is a quasi-legal definition that everyone seemed to agree on in the 
house community years ago to end to shit about who "created" house 
music.  Jesse couldn't legitimately make that claim, of course, because 
this or any genre developed out of the work and creativity of many.  He 
stakes his claim, not at the creator, but as the "originator" because he 
published the first house release.

It's all crazy.  When I go back to writing House Music 101 I'll get into 
the details of all this.

Love,

Apollo

what i love about this ad is that it premiered during the "Super"Bowl.

get this, the tag line they use in that smarmy, know better than you, voice
says:

"Marijuania, it impairs judgement."

So far, so good.

Save for the fact that Budweiser ran **ELEVEN** beer ads at a minimum cost
of $20 million for just the airtime and not once did the subject of impaired
judgement, or say, it being a vehicle for date rate ever come up....

Want to do something about all this?

Circle April 20th on your calendar and pass on this link to a friend:

Enough is enough.

See you on the barricades.

Ok, the ad that gets me is,



<Must be part to of the ad you mentioned>



You see a girl looking concerned, Her parents are standing there looking at
something, you see that they are looking at a pregnancy test; their little
girl is pregnant. Then the voice over, Marijuana can impair your judgment
(or something to that effect). First time I saw it I thought gosh, I didn't
know you could get pregnant from smoking some pot!

Or the one where the brother visits the tree his sibling drove into while 
high on pot?  Didn't say what else he was high on, or whether he was drunk, 
or if there was inclement weather.  I went to Monte Vista, and there was a 
guy in my class that drove into a tree and died.  He was sober.  Nothing 
prevents stupidity except personal responsibility.

Subject: [sfraves] SRR: Sneak-a-Toke??



what i love about this ad is that it premiered during the "Super"Bowl.

get this, the tag line they use in that smarmy, know better than you, voice
says:

"Marijuania, it impairs judgement."

So far, so good.

Save for the fact that Budweiser ran **ELEVEN** beer ads at a minimum cost
of $20 million for just the airtime and not once did the subject of impaired
judgement, or say, it being a vehicle for date rate ever come up....

Want to do something about all this?

Circle April 20th on your calendar and pass on this link to a friend:

http://www.siliconsalon.com/420.htm

Enough is enough.

See you on the barricades.

I was watching Mad TV last Saturday.  Rarely view commercial TV, but with 
my partner's illness we have been hanging around weekend nights watching 
movies and such.  (BTW, 24 Hour Party People is a must see).

Anyhow, you've all seen the "depression" commercials for some Prozac-like 
drug.  Cartoon faces.  Sad.  Expressing loss of interest in formerly 
attractive pursuits, etc.  Well, we see something very much like this on 
the screen.  Same sad faces.  Same symptoms of depression.  Then, the 
announcer says:  "Why not try Ecstasy?"  So the faces do E and they are all 
smiling.  Diagrams appear explaining the action of E on the mind.  The 
smiling faces bounce down past a "Rave" sign and they end up in a large 
venue with green glowsticks and Moby as the DJ.   As in the Prozac 
commercial there is an overview of bad side effects, and these included a 
compulsion to vote Green Party.

Right after this satirical thing, the anti-bud propaganda comes on:  the 
one with the 16-year old girl who got pregnant because she smoked pot.

And I thought to myself -- what a bizarre space we inhabit these 
days.  Took another toke and put "Reefer Madness" on the DVD player.

Love,

Apollo

Subject: [sfraves] SRR: Sneak-a-Toke??


what i love about this ad is that it premiered during the "Super"Bowl.

get this, the tag line they use in that smarmy, know better than you, voice
says:

"Marijuania, it impairs judgement."

So far, so good.

Save for the fact that Budweiser ran **ELEVEN** beer ads at a minimum cost
of $20 million for just the airtime and not once did the subject of impaired
judgement, or say, it being a vehicle for date rate ever come up....

Want to do something about all this?

Circle April 20th on your calendar and pass on this link to a friend:

http://www.siliconsalon.com/420.htm

Enough is enough.

See you on the barricades.

Ok, the ad that gets me is,



<Must be part to of the ad you mentioned>



You see a girl looking concerned, Her parents are standing there looking at
something, you see that they are looking at a pregnancy test; their little
girl is pregnant. Then the voice over, Marijuana can impair your judgment
(or something to that effect). First time I saw it I thought gosh, I didn't
know you could get pregnant from smoking some pot!

I'm starting the "operation Stupid People who run this country"  /I'm going 
to run all around finding their adresses and urinate on their front steps, 
laugh a little, then document it in my journal.

Years later I will enjoy a wonderful bottle of cabernet and sit by the fire

It's very strange that he passed away.  I was just thinking about him a few 
days ago(which was totally out of the blue).  When I was a kid I never 
understood why he always changed into more comfortable casual clothes...  
Now that I work, I totally understand!   Mister Rogers is tight!  I will 
miss him, plus his last name is my middle name!

Subject: [sfraves] SFbay604 presents: Psy-Fi 604


We are happy to announce the release of Psy-Fi 604, SFbay604's first
compilation album.  This album contains unreleased tracks produced
exclusively by members of the SFbay604 bay area psy-trance mailing list.

Tracks on this album span many of the directions psy-trance has taken in
the last few years, from the traditional goa-inspired sound, to
techno-tinged, to the more minimal, to uplifting, to breaky, and to full-on
mind warping.

Arists include Temporary Humanity, wORMFOOD, Prabhamandala, Fractal Cowboys,
oCeLoT, Bufo, Ferrapsylix, Rinsl and Sanyama.

There are several way to obtain this CD.  We will be giving them out as
free gifts at the KJ release party this friday for those who contribute $20
for admission (while supplies last).  (This party is located in San Francisco)

You can order them online for $10+S/H at:
http://store.mixonic.com/sf604

This page has a link to high-quality .mp3 samples of all the tracks, and
features the stunning cover graphics work of Chris Olerich.

We may also be selling these at future events, including the Taco Portal
at the Boarder Cantina on upcoming thursday nights.

-Troy, and the entire Psy-Fi 604 production team.

Santa Fe Police Arrest Attorney For Comments he Made In An Internet
Chat-Room


A St. John's College Library visit by a former public defender was abruptly
interrupted February 13 when city police officers arrested him about 9 p.m.
at the computer terminal he was using, handcuffed him, and brought him to
the Santa Fe, New Mexico, police station for questioning by Secret Service
agents from Albuquerque. Andrew J. O'Conner, 40, who was released about five
hours later, said in the February 16 Santa Fe New Mexican, "I'm going to sue
the Secret Service, Santa Fe Police, St. John's, and everybody involved in
this whole thing."


According to O'Connor, the agents accused him of making threatening remarks
about President George W. Bush in an Internet chat room. Admitting he talked
politics face-to-face in the library with a woman who was wearing a "No war
with Iraq" button, O'Connor recalled saying that Bush is "out of control,"
but that "I'm allowed to say all that. There is this thing called freedom of
speech." He also speculated that the FBI might have been observing him
because of his one-time involvement in a pro-Palestinian group in Boulder,
Colorado.


Earlier on the same day O'Connor was questioned, officials at St. John's-as
well as at the College of Santa Fe and Santa Fe Community College-issued
warnings to students and faculty that the FBI had been alerted to the
presence of "suspicious" people on campus within the past four weeks.


Concern about threats to individual privacy under the USA Patriot Act has
prompted New Mexico legislators in both houses to propose resolutions urging
state police not to help federal agents infringe on civil rights. The
resolutions also encourage libraries to post prominent signage warning
patrons that their library records are subject to federal scrutiny without
their permission or knowledge.

I found him to be a condescending bastard with an annoying twang, even as a
little kid. His public statement to kids on Gulf War One back when I was in
high school proved it to me. Guess I was a jaded jerk-off since childhood ;)
He helped foster my disdain for authority, so I suppose I should be thankful
for that.

Regardless, anyone dying of cancer is a sucky thing, IMO, but at least he
lived a long life and did a lot for kids who needed a push into imagining
things, which is always a plus in my book. I'm not gonna dance on the man's
grave.

I did think that the postman being named "Mr. McFeely" was creepy, though!

Yeah-I'll drink to King Friday.

But hmm-I dunno what it was about him-his whole voice and mannerisms made me feel like he was trying to lure me in to his van or something.
And his changing clothes every time...
Why don't you put your sweater and comfy shoes on *before* the show-eh Fred?

Subject: [sfraves] Re: look out!  they're watching.. (SRR: Sneak-a-Toke??)

be careful where you point your browser...

-------------------

The feds are now starting to take over domain names of suspected law
breakers...such as mod chip sellers and sites that sell "tobacco"
pipes...and routing them directly to the DOJ website.

But that is not what is scary...this is:

The privacy policy on the Justice Department's site permits the DOJ to
hand personal information about visitors to the FBI or other law
enforcement agencies. It says, "We may take additional steps to identify
you based on this information, and we may share this information,
including your identity, with other government agencies."

so if you go to look at one of those sites that got busted, you will get
routed to the dept of justice and probably added to their list of "people
to watch."  sneaky bastards...

what i love about this ad is that it premiered during the "Super"Bowl.

get this, the tag line they use in that smarmy, know better than you,
voice
says:

"Marijuania, it impairs judgement."

So far, so good.

Save for the fact that Budweiser ran **ELEVEN** beer ads at a minimum
cost of $20 million for just the airtime and not once did the subject of
impaired judgement, or say, it being a vehicle for date rate ever come
up....

Want to do something about all this?

Circle April 20th on your calendar and pass on this link to a friend:

http://www.siliconsalon.com/420.htm

Enough is enough.

See you on the barricades.

Ok, the ad that gets me is,



<Must be part to of the ad you mentioned>



You see a girl looking concerned, Her parents are standing there looking
at something, you see that they are looking at a pregnancy test; their
little girl is pregnant. Then the voice over, Marijuana can impair your
judgment (or something to that effect). First time I saw it I thought
gosh, I didn't know you could get pregnant from smoking some pot!

Subject: RE: [sfraves] SRR: Sneak-a-Toke??

Not to mention we got the commercial where the kids are playing adults
in their dad's study while smokin' off a bong and he pulls the gun out
of the drawyer and it just happens to go off... I like how while he's
high, the gun isin't pointing anywhere really, just kinda wayward.. Now
if they were drunk with alcohol's agression factor, the commercial would
be much different.. He'd be pointing the gun at the kid with both of
them laughing most likely when it goes off.

Then you got the ones of the guys in the drive through that eventually
run over the kid on the bike because they ran out of money from buying
too much pot, wherein they go on to freak out and stomp on the gas
because their impaired judgement led them to believe that since they
couldn't pay they'd be in trouble...  Riiiiiiiiiigggghhhhhtttt.....
Everyone knows that most drivethroughs take credit cards/debit cards
now... Plus.. I don't think your avg. paranoid pot smoker would be
hotboxing their car while going through the drive through.  Except maybe
in the mission district.

Ahhh... Beautiful propaganda..  These commercials are like a sieve
filled with ice cubes.

Or the one where the brother visits the tree his sibling drove into
while 
high on pot?  Didn't say what else he was high on, or whether he was
drunk, 
or if there was inclement weather.  I went to Monte Vista, and there was
a 
guy in my class that drove into a tree and died.  He was sober.  Nothing

prevents stupidity except personal responsibility.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

i was just reading about some mardi gras celebrations coming up...mardi gras means "fat tuesday", by the way...anyway, then i started thinking about things that go on in s.f. and power exchange has been putting on some "slave auctions"..now, i don't know what that is other than a concept, however, the way i conceptualize it, it could be a lot of fun, but also, hmmmmm, it is not MY slave auction, so who would i be to know. :)

NEWSWEEK'S IRAQ REPORT FALLS ON DEAF EARS

Norman Solomon, AlterNet

Did the U.N. and the CIA cover up the release of information that
contradicts Bush's claims about Iraq's WMD program? And why has there been
no follow-up to a Newsweek article on the issue?

Hey, dont worry about it.  You are probably already on their list for belonging to SFRaves.  You know how incendiary those raver types are, just like the drugged out hippies from the Vietnam era 
The more I read about how the government wants to violate the rights of its citizens and keeps pushing for the revocation of constitutional protections against abuse by the police, the more I keep thinking about the statement by George Orwell from his book 1984  "If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face--for ever."

be careful where you point your browser...

 

-------------------

 

The feds are now starting to take over domain names of suspected law

breakers...such as mod chip sellers and sites that sell "tobacco"

pipes...and routing them directly to the DOJ website.

 

But that is not what is scary...this is:

 

The privacy policy on the Justice Department's site permits the DOJ to

hand personal information about visitors to the FBI or other law

enforcement agencies. It says, "We may take additional steps to 

identify

you based on this information, and we may share this information,

including your identity, with other government agencies."

 

so if you go to look at one of those sites that got busted, you will 

get

routed to the dept of justice and probably added to their list of 

"people

to watch."  sneaky bastards...

Not really.  A friend of mine was trying to get something from his
grandfathers
top shelf in the closet when I was 13 and he found a gun.  My other friend
and
I were enjoying the new Atari 2600 when we heard a loud bang and heard some
glass shatter.  He was just looking at the gun and stuff and it went off,
the bullet
went from where he was through the other wall opposite him, at our head
level and
2 feet in front of us.  Ahem.  Doesn't take aggression or any drug at all
for that
kinda thing to happen, and any drug being involved is going to up the ante
for
something bad to happen, intentional or not.

Fred filled little kids, mostly empty, with love and acceptance.  It's no 
surprise to me that other people who already had shit in them from other 
sources got an unholy message from it.  That doesn't mean there was 
anything wrong with the sender.

Ok.

So we take over a few prominent domains, say Networksolutions.com or 
yahoo.com, and redirect ALL traffic to phatbongs.net.  Let them positively 
ID everyone, in every country.

I totally agee. I remember how much I loved Mr Rogers
when I was little. I used to wish there was an adult
in my life who could be so calm and kind, but at least
he showed me they were out there. Freddy was the
shiznit!

Subject: [sfraves] Memoirs of a San franciscan vol. 3

   Today was absolutley beautiful!  I hope you can tell through the
intonation of this email note.
It was one of those days where the air touched your soul the way
you'd want it to every day.  Crisp, alive everso tender.
Since I moved to San Francisco, I have hurdled over the most
wonderful little obstacles that life could have given me from moving
into a new city filled with so much incertainty.  First there was
finding the right job.  It's easy to find work that pays the bills,
but finding one that satisfies someone on all the emotional levels
as well as one that will support your future growth and strength,
well, I  think I found it and I am very content.        Then I found
another, working at a very "she-she" nightclub called Ruby Skye.  (I
already got to ask a a guy who is in "6 feet Under" what his sign
was, he he he)
     There has been a big difference between the "type" of people
that I have waited on in Santa Cruz versus the "city folk" but the
one thing that hasn't changed one bit is that we are all here for
the same reason and that still makes me be able to relate to
everyone and have a wonderful time doing so.
    Today I awoke and turned on the news so I could hear  "the
communicators of sorrow."  We all know these folks as 'journalists.'
    Fred Rogers died today at the age of seventy-four.  Mr Rogers,
as we all know, helped us grow through his television show "Mr.
Roger's Neighborhood."  The things that I learned from this
gentleman have been those of compassion, respect, and imagination.
Who would have known that a person who you only watched every day of
your childhood could truly shape the way we see things such a long
time afterwards?  I also find it wonderful realizing how everyone
finally notices  how much a certain person meant to them once they
have passed on.
    At my restaurant today, right smack dab in the middle of the
financial district, surrounded my what seems to be hundreds of
skyscrapers owned by all the people neglecting you folks of a job, I
noticed a very common mood between everyone, a sort of meloncholy
existed everywhere.  One lady litterally had her head down a she
proceeded to order her chinese chicken salad.
  "Are you doing okay? I asked.
  "I've had better days," she said woefully.
   "I know, I heard"
  "heard what?,"  her eyes seemed excited to hear what I had to
say.
   "Mr. Rogers."
   "Whatabout Mr. Rogers?" she asked.
    Uh oh, She obviously hadn't heard the news and already having a
bad day based on whatever she may be going through, I didn't realize
that I may be the "journalist" in her day.  I told her.  She burried
her head in the salad.
    "Fuck," I thought, I always do shit like this, trying to help
people out and then it coming right back bigger that the biggest
foot could ever fit in my mouth.
    "Well at least he taught us something."  She said.
    Thank  god the woman had some sort of positivity vibrating in her head.
    "What do you think he taught us?" I asked.
    "He taught us everything but how to eat a chinese chicken salad
correctly."
   "oh,"  I never really thought about that...
     I thought about it and I thought about it and I thought about
it.  Basically I figured out that such simple things can come from
what seem to be such simple people.  Did Mr. Rogers surround himself
with drama, pain, and sorrow?  Nope, what about all of his friends
in that little world of his who still haven't come out of the closet
after all these years...They didn't have drama either, they were
always just mere friends in a simple little neighborhood.   I wonder
if they will all move to the Castro since Fred is now gone?
oh dear...
    oh dear...


Until next time folks, friends, and beautiful creatures all alike.
May the smallest of experiences throughout your day be your
brightest and may you treat all your good neighbors as Mr. Rogers did!!!!
Love and Blessings,
Danny Picard

P.S. if you never received any of the other vol's and would like them sent,

"McFeely" was Fred Roger's middle name:

btw, my fondest (recent-to-me-but-10yrs. ago) memory of Mr. Rogers was
when we went to visit "Stomp" (http://www.stomponline.com/home.html)

I thought he was cool.

Santa Fe Police Arrest Attorney For Comments he Made In An Internet
Chat-Room


A St. John's College Library visit by a former public defender was abruptly
interrupted February 13 when city police officers arrested him about 9 p.m.
at the computer terminal he was using, handcuffed him, and brought him to
the Santa Fe, New Mexico, police station for questioning by Secret Service
agents from Albuquerque. Andrew J. O'Conner, 40, who was released about five
hours later, said in the February 16 Santa Fe New Mexican, "I'm going to sue
the Secret Service, Santa Fe Police, St. John's, and everybody involved in
this whole thing."


According to O'Connor, the agents accused him of making threatening remarks
about President George W. Bush in an Internet chat room. Admitting he talked
politics face-to-face in the library with a woman who was wearing a "No war
with Iraq" button, O'Connor recalled saying that Bush is "out of control,"
but that "I'm allowed to say all that. There is this thing called freedom of
speech." He also speculated that the FBI might have been observing him
because of his one-time involvement in a pro-Palestinian group in Boulder,
Colorado.


Earlier on the same day O'Connor was questioned, officials at St. John's-as
well as at the College of Santa Fe and Santa Fe Community College-issued
warnings to students and faculty that the FBI had been alerted to the
presence of "suspicious" people on campus within the past four weeks.


Concern about threats to individual privacy under the USA Patriot Act has
prompted New Mexico legislators in both houses to propose resolutions urging
state police not to help federal agents infringe on civil rights. The
resolutions also encourage libraries to post prominent signage warning
patrons that their library records are subject to federal scrutiny without
their permission or knowledge.

at or around 5 o'clock 2nite i was passing through the mall on my way to =
the rayburn for a drop when i noticed a weather channel satellite truck =
parked on 3rd st and sure enough it had a cam pointed @ the capitol.

so, of course, i stuck my tongue out at it.

on the way back, since it was still there, i not only stuck out my =
tongue, and caught a few fluffy snowflakes, but i raised my arm high and =
flashed a peace sign into millions, ok, thousands, of homes across =
america.

it was fun.

what was rilly crazy was that it was snowing so fierce that the mall was =
so whited out from the snow you could not see the monument on the other =
end.

how cool is that?

Jolly Green Jungle - Featuring the tallest Drum and Bass DJ's in the bay
area.

Saturday March 1st, 2003

10 pm - 4am   $7 at the door

Only 10 minutes from the Bay Bridge in Oakland  

Info line: (415) 364-3095

 

And who's going to be playing you ask???

 

Controlled Substance 6'3" (Subtitles/Breakbeatscience/Thermal) - With
releases on TeeBee's Subtitles label, New York's Breakbeatscience and
Oakland's Thermal Controlled Substance has already established himself
as a top notch producer.  Now check out his talent on the decks as he
hauls the laptop and final scratch with him to bring you the most
upfront DNB around.

 

Freya 6'3" (Hemisphere) - She is responsible for the sexiest night of
dnb in San Francisco - Hemisphere.  Stick around till the end as she
closes out the night with some deep groovy beats to keep you dancing.

 

Genome 6'5" (Groundscore) - Resident DJ at San Francisco's famous weekly
event Eklektic.  Genome always comes armed with the hottest tunes
available.  Last time he played at this venue he tore the place apart.
Don't miss out.

 

Fife 6'6" (InnerspaceResearchGroup) - I'm not going to write stuff about
myself.  I'm tall and I play spacey sci-fi-esque drum and bass.  

 

Highside 6'7" (Hemisphere) - The nights tallest DJ.  Also a resident at
Hemisphere.  Highside is going to start off the night with a variety of
styles for everyone to enjoy.  Come early and check this guy out cause
he rocks.

 

So there you have it.  We could be the starting five for the bay area
DNB basketball team.  Unfortunately, I think most of us suck at
basketball.

 

And yes, we are all dorks.  Except Genome.he is cool.

 

And no, we are not 15 year old candy ravers.

 

Anyway, call on the day of the event for directions.  Hope to see you
all there.  Peace.

 

-Fife

Subject: [sfraves] [nrr] kkk march in support of golf

-TOO FUNNY-

AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- The controversy over Augusta National Golf Club's
all-male membership has attracted the attention of the Ku Klux Klan. 

A Klan group has asked for an application for a permit to demonstrate in
support of the club that hosts the Masters each April. 

The club has been under pressure from Martha Burk, chairwoman of the
National Council of Women's Organizations, to admit a female. Burk has said
she will seek a permit to demonstrate at the Masters against Augusta
National's membership practices. 

The Rev. Jesse Jackson's Rainbow/PUSH Coalition has requested an application
for a permit to demonstrate in support of Burk at the Masters in April.

Subject: [sfraves] [SRR] Eric P. is back...sort of

Hello sfravers!

It's been over a year since I've been to any events,
and even longer since dropping off the list, so I
thought I'd re-sub to see what's happening with the
scene these days, and with all the beautiful people
(remember, we are ALL beautiful people!) *S* I miss
the Bay Area underground scene like nobody's business,
and all the friends I've known while celebrating life
through dance!

If anyone around here remembers me, please give me a
shout! I spent most of last year in England, but
didn't get a chance to check out the scene there. I'm
very curious to know what the Bay Area rave scene is
like these days, especially the UG scene (which I
remember as being hella sweet!). So I'd appreciate if
people could give me the low-down on the throw-down ;)

Hope everyone's doing fantastically well, despite the
very shaky start this year as gotten off to...looking
forward to hearing from old friends, and maybe making
new ones, too!

Love, peace, and music,
Eric

I was working with one of my tunes last night and decided I needed some
opinions to kind of see if people are feeling the mood and emotion I put
into this tune. Go to this link

Yeah right-I can totally tell you used Acid Pro to make it :p

Hmmm-I like the soft noises and lines and such-especially the one thats there from the beginning-
The drums while simplistic seem to fit the overall mood-
I don't really like the high stabs that come in at 0:49 at all.
It sounds too stark in contrast to the smoothness of everything else.
Maybe a fatter, warmer pad-think Vangelis.
And the notes used seem weird in that section as well.
And then-from there to the end seems to drag with not alot happening/changing.
The secondary bassline could be dropped out favoring the first at times etc etc-

JMO-I'm no expert :)

Please tell me you are not serious. I don't even own a trial version of
Acid. I started out using Acid and that is how I got a little bit of a
start into producing but I moved on. I am using Buzz. Peace

i have no idea whatsoever if this will help...all i know is that i want the whining to stop in the world..if there were less whining, there'd be room for more beauty...also, just in case you haven't heard it from anyone else lately, of course, the answer is no 99.9 percent of the time...just check "no" in that little mental box, and your on your way...no, you are not the exception to the rule, for example...no, your version is not true...no, it is not okay...no, no, no, no. :)

I've always thought "YES" to be such a luscious and beautiful word.


Nobody gets much of anything out of short, stubby, and ugly "no".

Girl, you bettah check yoself before you wreck yoself. Your message
embodies whining and negativity completely. "No" your message did not help. 
:-). If you want the whining to stop, then stop whining about things.

Also, if the answer is "no" 99.9% of the time, the typical human reaction
will be to increase the sample size over which you draw your percentages.
This further involutes the negativity until life appears to be little more
than a snake eating its own tail, ad infinitum, for all foreseeable futures.

If people would say "yes" more often, then there'd truly be more beauty
and truth. And maybe people would pester you less. Besides, who made you
the arbiter of what is or isn't beautiful? Beauty is an emergent property,
not an emergency.

:-)

      Ok so the sound system comprises of :

2  18 inch subs powered by a Crown Ce 2000 at 500 watts each into 8 ohms . ( I actually have 4 of these 18's if needed....but I'm one amp shy and would have to rent an amp to run the other 2 but I'm willing to do that if needed)

2  JBL SR 47-35A 15" 3 way mains, also powered by a Crown CE 2000 at 600 watts each into 4 ohms.

2 JBL Eon 15 G2 monitors + 2 JBL Eon 15 subs ( for sub monitors if needed )

In the Coffin :

2 Technic  SL 1200 M3D Turn Tables with brand new Shure White Label Carts (these blow the fuckin ortofons out of the water )

1 Rane MP 44 4 channell club Mixer with seperate 3 band full cut eq's for each channell ( this mixer fuckin rocks..........crystal fuckin clear and really good deep low end. 

Also available if needed :

A 3rd Technic SL1200 table,  A Pioneer CDJ 800 CD deck, and A Pioneer EFX 500 external effects processor.

     Plus I'll throw in a free Tech house/ acid house set if you want (but its not mandatory)

They say they do, but don't necessarily.. It seems to be on a case-by-case
basis. Play it safe by stickin' to the code (no jeans, tennies) and you'll
be un-freakin-comfortable but inside :)

I wish the big names would book at venues besides 1015 and Ruby Skye. *Sigh*
