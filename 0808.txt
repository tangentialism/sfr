For a small taste of what you're in for, check out the free mixes below.
There's also a pretty interesting interview from Resident Advisor worth
checking out.

But when listening, keep in mind, those mixes are made up of only songs fro=
m
his own labels!  When he plays for us Saturday, he'll have his entire
arsenal of tracks he's come across in his 20 years as a DJ (including 7
years behind the counter at KOMPAKT) at his disposal.

This will be Riley's long overdue West Coast debut and one of only 2 US
appearances, and he's coming ready to blow the roof off the Endup!

Expect no less than finely-crafted, beautiful minimal and maximal techno
that's as fun to listen to as it is to dance to.

This man is truly a dance music legend.  Do yourself a favor and don't miss
this one!

minimal techno + avant-house
every 1st Saturday @ The Endup


featuring from Cologne, Germany
in an exclusive appearance:

TRIPLE R   (aka Riley Reinhold)

Traum . Trapez . MBF . Kompakt


Riley Reinhold, best known as Triple R, has been a hugely
influential figure in Germany's dance music culture for nearly
20 years.  Starting off as a DJ at early illegal parties in his
native Cologne, he soon found himself writing for top music
mags (including his own De:Bug) before going on to co-found
the revered labels Traum, Trapez, and MBF.  Between his
years at the Kompakt record shop, developing talent for his
5 labels, residencies at Cologne's best clubs, a radio show,
and organizing monthly parties, it's no wonder he's
practically considered a national treasure.  This month we
are thrilled to share some of the riches with San Francisco
with an extended West Coast debut set.


with special guest:

CHRISTIAN MORA (bang the box)


and [KONTROL] residents:

ALLAND BYALLO  (nightlight music . auralism . leibe*detail)
NIKOLA BAYTALA  (s.w.a.t . robsoul . junior boys own)

TRIPLE R (aka Riley Reinhold)

Riley Reinhold (aka Triple R) is part owner of the Traum Schallplatten
family of labels encompassing Traum, Trapez and MBF. He started DJing in
1984 in Cologne and later on at electronic dance parties in 1989. Together
with Sascha K=F6sch (now Chief Editor of De:BUG) the pair assembled their o=
wn
sound system in 1990, playing at early techno, house and acid parties at
every club and party imaginable (both legal and illegal) throughout Cologne
and beyond.

>From 1991 to 1993 Riley belonged to the early Force Inc DJ team, together
with Ian Pooley, Tonka, T.P. Heckmann (Live), and Alec Empire, playing at
big clubs in Switzerland and Austria. He was resident at the legendary
Elektro club in Berlin 1993 in the company of DJs such as Robert Hood, Dave
Clarke, Kotai. Later he DJed at its successor, the Panasonic club. He was
also resident at Ego in Dusseldorf, with Florian from Kraftwerk a regular i=
n
the crowd.

In 1994 he was sent to London to meet the Aphex Twin and write an article
about the vast emerging breakbeat scene in London together with Sascha
K=F6sch. His record reviews and articles in the biggest german indie mag SP=
EX
and later Frontpage (an icon for techno culture in Berlin) from 1994 to 199=
8
earned him an international reputation as a journalist which later resulted
in the formation of his own magazine De:BUG.

For the last three years, Riley has been resident DJ at the largest techno
club in Cologne, Sensor, playing with guests such as Swayzak, Carl Craig,
Daniel Bell, Thomas Brinkmann, Miss Kittin, Richie Hawtin, Magda, Green
Velvet, Markus Nikolai, Alter Ego, Steve Bug, Luciano and Broker/ Dealer. H=
e
also plays occasionally at Camouflage together with Sascha K=F6sch and has
been offered a residency at Subway in Cologne. More recently, Riley has bee=
n
hosting a new monthly night called MBF CLUB since June 2005.

Riley was involved for seven years at the Kompakt record store but quit in
2004 to concentrate on his labels Traum, Trapez and MBF together with
Jacqueline Klein.

CHRISTIAN MORA

Christian's story has only begun to be written. After getting his start in
1995, he began to make a name for himself by playing undergound parties,
mantaining residencies, and organizing full-moon parties all across Mexico.
After making the move to San Francisco in 2000, he started working at the
now defunct Nemesis distributor, helping to service dance music stores
across the states as well as his own store Crescent Records in Guadalajara.
By melding house, tech house, techno and electro into his own signature
blend, his good ear and taste for music has allowed him to DJ not only in
Mexico, but Spain, Holland, Japan and the States. For the last couple of
years, Christian as been playing club and underground events as a member of
Bang The Box, alongside fellow San Franciscans Solar, Lance DeSardi, and
Guada. Previous Bang The Box guests have included John Tejada, Dan Curtin,
Jona, Dollz At Play, Alexkid, and Mr. C., with many more on the horizon.

Subject: [sfraves] Text message spam from Prismatic on my cell phone

Anyone else getting it?  I'm not sure how my PHONE got on their list,  
but I've been getting it from them for some time.  I wouldn't mind  
being on their email list... I'd just set a rule to filter to my BSP  
folder and all... but I can't exactly do that with SMS and I'm trying  
to avoid having to up my text plan and pay more for the higher tiers.

Since Prismatic is local, and there are a few familiar names from  
SFRaves in the messages, I figured I'd ask here if anyone is familiar  
or affiliated with them enough to know if texting "remove" back, as  
they suggest, will be respected; or if, as with email spam, replying  
in any way just lets them know there's a live address there and I'd be  
dooming myself to 10x as much spam?

Thanks!


cya,
john

I'd be pretty sure they'll respect.  They're all event announcements,
there've just been more "other" prismatic related events than there
have been tonal parties lately...  At least, I've only gotten a handful
each month, have't been that many I've noticed, and they were all events.

It's not like there's THAT many folks in Prismatic...

WRONG. A lot of people have sold email lists in this scene over the years, 
and it's fucking annoying.  I've *never* signed up for any list knowingly, 
but the email address I use for this list, as well as the spamtrip address 
I gave Nitevibe's THE DJ LIST have been sold to every fucker up and down 
the cali coast.  It's illegal as of 2003, and even the lists you WANT to 
be on should have a forced Opt-In every 6 months BY LAW (i.e. the default 
list management behavior is to purge the list every 6 months, and include 
directions for staying on if you wish to continue).

Hint:  I think DJ Seven, Dmitri Mykonos, ultralounges, any party 
containing the line "women *** before ***" and other boring sexist drivel, 
etc are all shit for their policies on sending unsolicited email to 
addresses they got through shady shit, I'd never leave the house for that, 
EVER.  A couple people/crews I let slide (people I know in person who 
might have thought it best to keep me up to date), but lately I've been 
taking care of matters taking in the role of being my own ISP and 
complaining via phone (expensive for them, and fun for me when I wake up 
cranky) to their email list service providers (usually ends up in a fine, 
or "points" against the cleanliness of their lists).

-&e->It's not like there's THAT many folks in Prismatic...

It only takes one asshole with no respect for others to spam thousands, 
even millions.  Prismatic should come correct (and yeah, they sent me 
mail, again, couldn't fucking imagine why I'd want that shit so EAT A DICK 
SPAMMERS), as well as any other crew that can't figure out that people who 
didn't ask to be on a list won't likely hold whatever they send in the 
highest regard.  It's shit promotion, usually for sub-par events, and 
these people need to start getting wise to the fact that it's never 
worked, it's never been "ok" to just send me an update every couple weeks, 
let alone nowadays.

As for John's scenario, I'd recommend getting as much info as you can 
regarding the source of those SMS's and going into ream mode.  It might be 
just a tad annoying on a per person basis, but remember you're likely 
speaking for a couple hundred people just like you when you complain (that 
might not know how to deal with unsolicited email... let alone SMS, that's 
just fucking tacky).

And if you think I'm mean about this shit, I lived in Salt Lake City Utah 
for a year, and used to get missionaries a couple times a week.  And then 
they stopped.  It's as if my answering the door in my boxers smoking a 
cigarette and holding a bottle of tequila, playing Lard or Skinny Puppy on 
my stereo and begging them to come into the basement in my best pervert 
voice rather than talking in the living room let them know I wasn't ready 
for the good news...  Sorry, but again, these might be nice people, they 
might really believe in what they have to say, they might even want to 
save me from eternal damnation, but it's my fucking door on my fucking 
house wasting my fucking time.

andyw

p.s.	And yes, it's possible I do in fact need a hug, going through a 
shitty breakup.  :(

Unsubscribing from either list has done me no good.  Upstream host for

Not wrong.  We're talking about SMS messages, not email.  While there are
usually email->SMS gateways, there's no good way to automatically figure
out which cell #s need to go to which email gateways (every provider
maintains their own and they won't forward between each other).  None
of your examples have any known correlation to the SMS service that
Prismatic uses.  Having implemented SMS detection systems, I'm quite
sure how hard this is.  

OTOH, if you actually followed the directions on a tonal announcement that
said to text "prismatic" to the 5 digit # for the service for info, you
did sign up for the general prismatic list, not a single infor request for
a tonal party.  That part wasn't so clear in the instructions, but considering
I did the same thing and haven't gotten anything but other prismatic info,
I'm ready to say they haven't yet sold my # to any SMS spammers.  

Email spam is separate from SMS.  Yeah, they need to correct any email
spam they've facilitated, but they're still technologically different issues.

If you're going to fight spam, you need to stay rational or you're just
going to sabotage your own efforts.  I've been involved in the technology
for fighting spam for almost 10 years, and can guarantee that ranting like
you just did WILL NOT WORK.

And yes, have a hug.  sucks when things don't work out.  Pretty sure spammers
aren't to blame for your breakup unless you actually tried to buy those
penis enlargement pills or something, though. :)

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Text message spam from Prismatic on my cell phone

Hey alls, I am Prismatic, I'm the the sole owner the business, so anything
you get from Prismatic is from me.

The Prismatic text list is run through msgme.com, my email list is run
through Mobile Storm, there are unsubscribe details at the bottom of all
messages be it text or email.

The text list was built up through: discount signup for the Tonal parties
(which explicitly asks you if you want to confirm adding your number to the
Prismatic list), online signup, and clipboard signup at Tonal and my other
parties.

The email list was built off of porting over my old and now defunkt
djandrewphelan.com list as well as online and clipboard signup.

I've never sold/traded emails or phone numbers collected with anyone else.
To me it's bad business, you end up alienating a lot of people who are
annoyed by it, and you end up spending a lot of money sending messages out
to people that don't want to receive them.

Tonal will still be happening, though not as frequently as in the past, as
it's gotten very hard for us to aqquire reasonably sized, secure underground
venues recently, and both Eric and myself are a lot busier than we were last
year.  The result has been more small one off undergrounds and more club
events, as we want to make sure we don't attach the Tonal name to a party
unless we can really do it up right.

-Andrew

Easiest way is to go to www.prismatictracks.com > click on the events page >
scroll down to enter your number in the signup box.  You'll get an opt in
text asking to confirm your subsciption to the list.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] The 5 Greatest Things Ever Accomplished While High

good point about huxley. although crick isn't the only one to thought of 
the prehistoric alien thing. and crick might actually be right. 
scientists actually now believe that all life was possibly spawned from 
bacteria riding on comets crashing into planets like coconuts landing on 
sandy beaches in the Caribbean or Polynesia. which could actually mean 
that there are more of us out there than we think. life doesn't have to 
be intelligent to exist. extra terrestrials can be real and they don't 
necessarily have to follow the physics of this planet to exist.. take 
chemosynthetic bacteria for example. possibly the real reasons why there 
are no UFOs is because the chance of there being intelligent life 
capable of travelling at the speed of light, and/or the possibility 
there being aliens being existing at the same time as us, in the 
fraction of a second of time in the universe that our lives are, is very 
very slim (one in a 100 billion sayeth the Sagan). although i think we 
are pretty ego driven to believe that we are a special life force; we 
just happen to be lucky enough to produce cognitive thought.

food for human thought.

Just figured I'd give a heads up about this campout since I haven't seen it posted on here.

The flyer pictures are at:

The campout location is pretty, and the main stage will have two huge touring stacks of McCauley speakers (40,000 watts?)

Funny, but she, or her handlers, should have directed her ageist humor  
towards Obama long ago.


A February 24, 2005, Washington Post article begins:

There's nothing exotic or complicated about how phenoms are made in  
Washington, and, more to the point, how they are broken.

"Andy Warhol said we all get our 15 minutes of fame," says Barack  
Obama. "I've already had an hour and a half. I mean, I'm so  
overexposed, I'm making Paris Hilton look like a recluse."

That is pretty much the who and the why of Sen. McCain's explanation  
of his ad, is it not? It turns out he wasn't mocking Sen. Obama so  
much as channeling him. Or making a mini-documentary out of the Post's  
article.

Apollo, 

It confounds me a little, but from this and other posts, I'm getting a fairly considerable anti-Obama shine coming from you.  Knowing your normal views, I'm surprised.  Are you just annoyed at his ubiquity and the unwillingness of his more dogged followers to question his stances and actions, or do you know something I don't? (very possible)


Inquiring minds want to know!

Remember to at least check out Obama:  The Postmodern Coup :  The  
Making of a Manchurian Candidate ... notice it is sold out on Amazon,  
it is also available on Lulu.com.  Spread the word to your Obama-bot  
friends in Europe, I hear they have Obamamania over there ..

http://www.amazon.com/Obama-Postmodern-Making-Manchurian-Candidate/dp/ 
0930852885/ref=wl_it_dp? 
ie=UTF8&coliid=I2TFNTY0ETVDOR&colid=3D0M6BFBCJVZ1

I did read his expose on George HW Bush and it is very revealing ...  
George Bush The Unauthorized Biography ..

Everything we're being offered as a "choice" this fall is a joke in  
of itself anyway, thanks in part to funding from Diebold and overall  
a generally ignorant public, i'm not saying any of you guys, just  
generally out there in the land of ignoramus want to believe that one  
of these candidates is going to solve our problems that they created  
in the first place.  HA!  Big fat joke.

QOD will return real soon, I'm just kind of busy looking for work  
right now in web design or video production/editing ...

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Paris Hilton responds to the McCain ad

George, I've anguished over this Obama thing.

I started writing a long explanation of my disillusionment with the  
Obama campaign but I don't want to open sfraves to the same type of  
irrational Obamamania that drove me from RG.  As far as I'm concerned  
Obama is the most divisive politician I've seen in my life.

To be brief I'm a "progressive" I guess.  But I'm not a "latte  
liberal."  I like my coffee strong and black with a touch of honey.   
And I have a low tolerance for jive these days.  As far as I can see  
Obama's new politics is just the same old politics of expediency.  The  
"Money" is clearly behind him.

I'm a Green Party member and I'll vote for McKinney.  She gives me a  
tingle up my leg, ya know?:)

I'll leave you with this:

Obama and the Empire

By William Blum

I'm afraid that if Barack Obama becomes president he's going to break  
a lot of young hearts. And some older ones as well.

fursure. People hate to choose the lesser of two evils, and (as do I)
possess idealistic notions about democracy and voting.

However, I'd rather bet on the guy with the knife hidden behind his
back then the guy with a knife to my throat. I can at least hope and
pray Mr. Hidey Knife isn't gonna use it on me. Fatalistic optimism?
Yuuup. I iz so nihilistic dood.

Obama has definitely flipped his policies in a few directions I don't like. But 
we all already knew the Dems and Republicans are in bed with each other anyway, 
right? At any rate, I still view him as the lesser of two evils, and America 
damn sure isn't going to vote green all of a sudden, nor for any independent. 

Divisive? Maybe. But would you rather toss away your vote to "voice your 
conscience" and wind up with yet another 4 years of a Bush-style White House? 
Not me. Fuck that.

*Signal*
Techno :: Electro :: Electro House
August 9th, 2008

Featuring:



*Ian Lehman*
Live P.A. (Modern Recording Company, Audio Assault, Mankind,
Minneapolis)

Ian Lehman is one of the hottest emerging techno producers from the
United States. In 2001, he formed Abiotic Recordings with long-time
friend Dustin Zahn. He quickly moved on to release multiple solo
records on a plethora of labels such as Drumworks, Compound, Blueline,
Hidden Agenda, Audio Assault, and more. Together with Dustin Zahn he's
also formed 1/2 of The Attack People, whose releases span across labels
such as Abiotic and Mankind. Many producers these days do not have a
distinguishable sound, but this isn't the case for Ian Lehman. His
tracks are linear, dark, and heavily textured- DJ tools written
exclusively for techno's most daring DJs. Lets welcome him back after
an incredible performance at Stilldream 2007.



*Dj Amber*
(Sister, iamthedj. com 
<http://www.msplinks.com/MDFodHRwOi8vaWFtdGhlZGouY29t>, San Francisco)

Amber is a San Francisco-based techno dj and producer with a driving
beat and aggresively risky mixing technique in a town known for its
laid back house style. For over ten years she has brought her vigorous
style and enthusiastic stage presence to events throughout North
America and Europe.




*Dj Dragn'fly*
(dj4norml. org <http://www.msplinks.com/MDFodHRwOi8vZGo0bm9ybWwub3Jn>, 
Sacramento)

Known as a true "journey DJ", Dragn'fly possesses an uncanny ability to
read into the desires of the crowd and the diversity of each set
performed has provided Dragn'fly with the opportunity to headline
countless events. When not headlining under her own accord, Dragn'fly
acts as the strategic support for many event coordinators worldwide as
a key transitional DJ, opening or closing sets for the worlds
most-widely popular and renowned electronic music artists.
Dragn'fly incorporates an "aggressive-as-hell" mixing style with the
elements of funky electro, tech-trance and breaks; a combination that
has earned her a style that is uniquely hers. Her performances
repeatedly showcase a near frenzy of sound manipulation while she
tweaks her EQ's and shreds her vinyl, watching as her dancers rise and
fall to ecstatic pieces on the dance floor.

Also featuring:

*Dirt* Live P.A. (Omniscient Records, San Francisco)

*G.a.m.m.a.
* (Left Coast Techno, Stilldream, Sacramento)

*Mek* (Signal, Stilldream, Sacramento, Bday show!)

*Signal*
Techno :: Electro :: Electro House
August 9th, 2008

Featuring:



*Ian Lehman*
Live P.A. (Modern Recording Company, Audio Assault, Mankind,
Minneapolis)

Ian Lehman is one of the hottest emerging techno producers from the
United States. In 2001, he formed Abiotic Recordings with long-time
friend Dustin Zahn. He quickly moved on to release multiple solo
records on a plethora of labels such as Drumworks, Compound, Blueline,
Hidden Agenda, Audio Assault, and more. Together with Dustin Zahn he's
also formed 1/2 of The Attack People, whose releases span across labels
such as Abiotic and Mankind. Many producers these days do not have a
distinguishable sound, but this isn't the case for Ian Lehman. His
tracks are linear, dark, and heavily textured- DJ tools written
exclusively for techno's most daring DJs. Lets welcome him back after
an incredible performance at Stilldream 2007.



*Dj Amber*
(Sister, iamthedj. com 
<http://www.msplinks.com/MDFodHRwOi8vaWFtdGhlZGouY29t>, San Francisco)

Amber is a San Francisco-based techno dj and producer with a driving
beat and aggresively risky mixing technique in a town known for its
laid back house style. For over ten years she has brought her vigorous
style and enthusiastic stage presence to events throughout North
America and Europe.




*Dj Dragn'fly*
(dj4norml. org <http://www.msplinks.com/MDFodHRwOi8vZGo0bm9ybWwub3Jn>, 
Sacramento)

Known as a true "journey DJ", Dragn'fly possesses an uncanny ability to
read into the desires of the crowd and the diversity of each set
performed has provided Dragn'fly with the opportunity to headline
countless events. When not headlining under her own accord, Dragn'fly
acts as the strategic support for many event coordinators worldwide as
a key transitional DJ, opening or closing sets for the worlds
most-widely popular and renowned electronic music artists.
Dragn'fly incorporates an "aggressive-as-hell" mixing style with the
elements of funky electro, tech-trance and breaks; a combination that
has earned her a style that is uniquely hers. Her performances
repeatedly showcase a near frenzy of sound manipulation while she
tweaks her EQ's and shreds her vinyl, watching as her dancers rise and
fall to ecstatic pieces on the dance floor.

Also featuring:

*Dirt* Live P.A. (Omniscient Records, San Francisco)

*G.a.m.m.a.
* (Left Coast Techno, Stilldream, Sacramento)

*Mek* (Signal, Stilldream, Sacramento, Bday show!)

Whatcha lookin for?  For techno, there's always killswitch happy hour(6-10).

I actually have found myself liking Trbl at Anu, which is definitely house
(this week J Phlip's guesting in) but actually pretty techno-friendly house.

Both events are free, which is always nice for checking something out. :)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Paris Hilton responds to the McCain ad

i think the late great bill hicks paraphrased it best.. " 'i believe the 
puppet on the right supports my views'..
'well i believe the puppet on the left is more to my liking... 
waitaminnut there's a guy holding up both puppets!' "

if given a choice though i'd rather go with the candidate that has 
actually practiced constitutional law (the guy with the o in his name). 
because obviously the last president had no idea what the constitution 
or bill of rights was about. even still, if you're looking at the 
executive branch you should really look at it as one of the lesser 
branches of government (i'm sick of the president being regarded as a 
king and the monarchies handed down through the parties. take queen 
hillary or prince bush  for example), congress and the house still rule. 
if you really wanted a force to change the world, invest money in 
lobbyists and invest heavily.

anyway i put up an NRR on this awhile ago and nobody listened. the place 
for government or law in a raves list is irrelevant. even when there was 
a supposed crackdown.. still raves going on. i would agree with apollo 
that there should be less talk of obama on the list.. but i also would 
have to add we shouldn't  support any major political views other than 
what our own political views towards raves are. if you vote it should be 
a personal decision based on careful analysis of the facts and i won't 
add to the discussion on this any more.

I completely agree with him.  Not funding sound camps is lame.

Not Available , Black Rock Sitty,
Cost :

"still pondering this move. such an off the hook and insane festival every year...but are they really going to continue charging 200-300$ per person and spending loads of money on art grants but literally not a DOLLAR on all the insane sound camps? i have multiple friends who are 20-40 thousand dollars in debt due to lack of support by the burningman festival, which relies on these sound camps as a main attraction.... so im not sure if ill be there. in addition, how can we go out and just burn and waste such a large quantity of precious resources when New Orleans still goes un-developed? And its during the Republican National Convention, which i think would be a much more interesting place to raise a storm of art and creativity and defiance. all that said, it IS a tradition, it HAS enriched my life immeasurably, and there ARE so many wonderful people and artists involved so...... we are still on the fence, 50/5o help push us one way or the other"


Cant wait to see the commentary after this one...

I don't know what the whole idea of the event was, but I know what I enjoy, and I enjoy large bangin' sound systems playing electronic dance music.  If there were no large sound camps, I wouldn't even consider going to BM.

fund your own freaking sound camp. every organization has their set of valu=

 mean it is not their focus. it's their festival so let them fund what they=
 want. if you don't like what you see out there then you pay to bring it ou=
t yourself. this is not news.

giant sound camps are hardly underrepresented on the playa. i do think it's=
 a bit ungrateful for lorin to speak out so harshly against the event that =
essentially made his career (imo), but if a few of those raver-magnet sound=
 camps fell off the map i think burning man might actually benefit...if the=
 festival can even still be helped at this point. i wouldn't miss him or hi=
s mega-sized big name superstar driven DJ-worship tents at all. if anything=
 the playa could use many many less of those camps. it's gotten so boring a=
nd predictable that i'm sitting out what would have been my 9th year in a r=
ow. burning man was attractive because it was fresh and weird and dangerous=
. your standard club night transposed onto a desert landscape is none of th=
ose things, regardless of how dope your tracks are or how hard you worked.

This is dead on, as far as I'm concerned (and I definitely LOVE DJing=20
in the desert too.)  I too was almost going to sit out this one as last=20
year was a pretty off year, and what's happened in the intervening year=20
hasn't been so great either.  But the GF is a powerful force, and it=20
looks like I'm going.  Hope this is a bounceback year as has happened in=20
the past.  And even if so, things aren't looking so great there.

Have a great day all!

yeah, this friday at killswitch happy hour it's recent detroit transplant
keith kemp headlining.

keith killed it when he played live for us in january at kontrol, and his dj
sets are equally impressive, as evidenced by his recent set at black market
techno in oakland (which i sadly missed but heard was great).

more on keith here:
http://www.myspace.com/keithkempkemptracks

and a recent(ish) mix here:
*http://www.ferrispark.com/audio/kkemp_newdetroitradio2.10.08.mp3*
** <http://www.ferrispark.com/audio/kk_liveset_7042008.zip>



also, later friday night is heidi (get physical: uk) @ mezzanine with
support from craig kuna, kevin knapp and eric sebastian.

flyer here:
http://66.111.100.251/uploads/EvFlyer_543.jpg



sounds like a night to hop from anu to mezz maybe?

I don't think he's subbed to SFR right now.

Scott, everyone's wishing you happy birthday.

Michael stickman thinks perv kittys like you. d.k. and Damon 
seconded.

Nico likes to yell your name.

Phillip Mispagel is confused who you are.

Marc(o) wants to do something with you involving friction.

Happy birthday, dood :-)

Also on the decks crashing Serato with the best of them, your
hot Tang flight attendants:

Bwahahahah! thx all- I dunno who this "Scott" character is, or any
shifty "scosol"- but Nathan Seven is surely subscribed (though rarely
checks his mail)...

Speaking of kittens, I bring you "But has she been certified?"

I've never seen him play, but Forest says he's an amazing DJ and does really wicked stuff with CDJ-1000s.

He produces okay stuff, but I lost all respect for him three
years ago at BM when he stopped the decks, held his arms up
like some sort of playa-god and waited 30 seconds before
playing the track again.

That's Jokenfold stuff, and was fairly lame, IMO.

Yeah, like play the same set night after night at pre/de compression 
events.  ZZzzzzzzz....

Lorin's whining speaks volumes about both him and the festival.  The fact 
that he is making a stand about not getting free money for the repeat 
opportunity that pretty much made his career in the past is just an added 
irony bonus.

I think that the funding for arts projects should embrace those projects 
that are unique, but running into financial problems producing them to a 
scale that would benefit the event most.  Just 10 minutes walking on the 
playa would rank dance music sound systems as an "art form" NOT in need of 
additional development.  Along with blowing fire, poi, and EL wire they 
rank right at the bottom of forms of expression obviously needing 
support... they're doing just fine without help (and to many including 
myself, dance sound systems are the one thing they'd like to see *less* 
of).

Bassnectar, the BM LLC/BMORG/etc does not owe you shit, quit crying in 
your couscous.  If their decision pisses you and every other whack DJ and 
faux fur ketamine clubber off the playa leaving something a little bit 
more interesting and diverse, I'd consider going again.

Arts grants for "sound art" isn't such a whacky idea though... the thing
is, this would imply that they're curated.  Are you ready for musical
curation?  You get to convince a director of sound art that your angle
on music is new and interesting enough that you deserve special funding.

(I have a fantasy about booting the aging frat boys with "art cars"
blasting Classic Rock.)

I might be inclined to agree -- except that I've already heard the
complaint that Burning Man has got more people going to fewer events.
Get rid of half of the rave camps and you'll either get double the
ravers packed into the half as much space, or a lot of disgruntled
ravers wandering around bugging other people.

Think of it like Fischerman's Wharf: you need some place to funnel
the clueless tourists.

Now, now.  Remember: burning man is always dying.  It's always been
Better Before.

I'm sitting one out just because doing Burning Man right can kind of
eat your life.  There's always another meeting to go to, another art
project to help slap together on a shoe-string...  I like to do other
stuff on occasion, and at present I'm helping out with Cellspace
(yes, putting energy into something local... odd thought, eh?).

Look for a different event.  They *are* out there, of course.

Didn't seem like it to me.  Serpent Mother, Big Rig Jig, Steampunk
Treehouse... Watching the temple burn from the tea temple was pretty
cool.  What would an "on" year look like?

They put the "trash tea temple" people in charge of the main temple
this year.  My main regret is not seeing how this works out:

Hey, couscous is awesome, b-hole!

I camped with Green Gorilla one year and heard a lot of this sort of "music is art, why doesn't music get funded, blah blah blah" puffery.  It does have a basis in reality- when you've schlepped half your world across the country year after year to help provide a wonderful time for so many people, and you hear of Joe Arts getting $10k for their interactive period blood fountain, it makes some sense that some of that same dough that we're all collectively "raising" through our "charitable donations" (tix sales) should go to help the sound folks out.

Those people (and me, in turn) worked harder to get that system and the domes, shade, infrastructure and general partyplex built and pimped than I would ever have imagined.  Most of the sound, lights and structures were already owned by somebody in the group, and the folks that owned all the stuff were nice enough to put it all in harms way for a week without it costing the collective a huge amount.  Each of us pitched in, I think, around $300 to help cover the cost of the trucks, structures, food, drink, etc, etc.  Grand total of around $30k, I think?

We ran a free bar and a huge sound system, crazy fire shows and lights, big chill area, for the better part of the week, had many thousands of guests.  Lots of fun.

The BMOrg could have given us $30k, but, then, was it really *that* difficult for each of us to come up with an extra couple hundred bucks?  They were up in our business to an almost comic level already- I'd sort of hate to see what they'd be like when they had a controlling interest in our shit.

Argh, I can't think this week, these are just musings,

additional development.  Along with blowing fire, poi, and EL wire they 
rank right at the bottom of forms of expression obviously needing 
support... they're doing just fine without help (and to many including 
myself, dance sound systems are the one thing they'd like to see *less* 
of).

Bassnectar, the BM LLC/BMORG/etc does not owe you shit, quit crying in 
your couscous.  If their decision pisses you and every other whack DJ and 
faux fur ketamine clubber off the playa leaving something a little bit 
more interesting and diverse, I'd consider going again.

I dig Bassnectar and I'm absolutely not a burner.  That is to say I don't go to Burning Man.

Subject: [sfraves] Think about doing an event at Cellspace?


As long as we're on the ever popular topic of "Burning Man vs.
The World", I thought I'd mention that Cellspace has got a bunch
of open dates in the upcoming weeks.  A lot of organizers are
running off to the desert, or are afraid that everyone else is --
if you've got an idea in mind for a cool event, take a look over
at:

  http://www.cellspace.org/new/node/5

Or just shoot us a proposal over at:

  events@cellspace.org

The art gallery up front is open right now, too, so there's potential
for events with an art tie-in.

(Tomorrow -- Friday, August 8th -- there's a fun one coming up:
"Action Figure and Friends": hard rock, aerialist, martial arts,
dance music, breakdancers, gallery art; all on a "superhero"
theme.)

I can't wait to tell people that YES, I HAVE gone to BM so they'll leave me the fuck alone about it. I'm pretty sure all of last year's 40K+ attendees have asked me this. . . 

But apparently I'm 5 years too late anyways, as most people I know that have told me I "have to" go are not attending this year. =P 

BTW I'm playing at some center camp with a big Pong game on a movie screen or something. I don't know the name of it though, so there. Expect Electro (NOT!).

Paul Kennedy sent me a collection of Gathering sets recently and I'm =
absolutely grooving to every set, but Lucero's shit is totally standing =

Loving the banging house and the mellow techno.

Anyone have his e-mail address so I can directly send him my praise?

love always

Oh god...

Does Electro have to get reamed on name-space too?  Electro originally 
meant blippy computery sounding breaks.  Kind of even before there was a 
breaks as a buyable genre (disco and funk records had breaks, but it was 
up to DJs to play just that part).  Now it's been claimed by that 
electro-house shit, which by the way sounds almost nothing like electro... 
its more like hardbag, or completely overproduced ADD techno with changes 
every couple bars and NRG noises, hoovers, nuschool/jungles basses and 
superfluous breakdowns.

"Electro" is properly defined as Aux88 or early Juan Atkins, or even some 
stuff by projects like Afrika Bam, Egyptian Lover, or Midnight Star 
(freakazoid) or Herbie Hancock's "Rocket".  It's breakdancing music 
muthafuckahz, not that playa scenster crap.  Press the eject on the 
boombox and give me the tape, I'm taking my cardboard, this is bullshit.

Oh look, a word.

Just like to keep folks informed when the lexicon gets reappropriated.  
Electro had one definition for over 20 years, it's just weird to see it 
used to describe something else now.  Especially when that something

Bwahahahah! thx all- I dunno who this "Scott" character is, or any

Speaking of kittens, I bring you "But has she been certified?"

Bwahahahah! thx all- I dunno who this "Scott" character is, or any
shifty "scosol"- but Nathan Seven is surely subscribed (though rarely

Ya know, Andy, I've always respected you because your posts generally had some substance to offer in spite of your signature crass delivery. That, and IMHO (us) vinyl junkies gotta stick together; we're a dying breed. I've read your rants about how there's so much more to mixing vinyl than just beat matching, for instance, and most of your manifests often beg the question; where's the soul? And I get that.

Earlier you knew what I was referring to by a clearly vague (at best) reference to "electro." Hell, you even explained it yourself. Your points are always well-taken, no need to aim them below the belt.

Chuck

Oh look, a word.

Just like to keep folks informed when the lexicon gets reappropriated.  
Electro had one definition for over 20 years, it's just weird to see it

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Bassnectar on Burning Man



Alright, guess I'll throw my thoughts in the bucket, too.

I do have to wonder about anyone who bothers to complain about any event,
whether it be Burning Man or something else.  If you're going to go and
setup some exhibit, feel free, but what good does complaining do except
make you look like some ungrateful whiner?  So they didn't throw money
at you.  BFD.  The history of BM is replete with people falling in love
with it, and spending vast quantities of personal time and money to give
to that community.  Hell, especially here in SF, the dedication borders
on cultism.  We probably all know at least a few folks who basically now
do nothing but BM, BM decompression, and planning/work/fundraising for their
next BM.  Seems unhealthy, but it's their choice, and at least they've
found some cause for passion in life.  Go them.

As to the funding of sound camps vs other art, I perceive a bit of a
difference.  Most sound camps seem to spend the bulk of their (not camping
essentials) budget on gear.  This gear is reusable, and a lot of camps
seem to come away far better equipped to throw parties up here.  Compare
this to the art camps, who primary are creating works that will get used
once, carted out for environmental concern but are basically scrap when it's
all said and done.  I happen to view music and visual media as art, but
there's a huge difference in expense ratios to keep creating one-off works,
and it doesn't sound like the art grants are given without some justification.
And, it's not like it's free money for all the recognized artists.

And as to some years sucking, and later ones rallying, keep in mind this
is ART.   It's not only highly subjective, but if you're really exploring
your mind and its assumptions, there needs to be freshness in the experience.
The very fact that some people drop out and others join in is part of this
cycle of creativity, down years convince many not to go but others step into
the fray.  Like any exhibit, some will be more successful to some than others.
I'd be surprised if everyone came back saying each year was awesome.  The
only way to be impressed by all art is to not have any taste at all. :)

I sure wouldn't mind if they also supported sound art, but don't really
see what would begin to justify any fuss about not having it.

And no, not going this year, no money, no time, and I have a party to throw
here in SF during that week.  Hope some of you come out. :)  Maybe I'll head
to BRC next year if I find a camp of folks I seem to fit. :)

Osby you are cheap rave labor! I came back from Amsterdam read your email a=
nd laughed at you but I was way to busy to respond any sooner. You straight=
 smell and you are greasy fat and you have sweaty hands=2C yuck no hugs get=
 the fuck away you stink=85 That is just from a hygiene perspective let=92s=
 not get into looks. Also I do not give a fuck who reads my meaningless ema=
ils on SFR about meaningless shit like going out. Some of the people on SFR=
 may be good people but some of them are what they think others are general=
ly SF trolls. Two bridges=2C cold cloudy overcast windy weather=2C and a ro=
ck bitch. I work and live dowtown same shit so I could not be writing all t=
hat bad of shit about SF all that much. What in the fuck do you call those =
email strings on SFR. Those peeps troll each other all day hence trolls the=
mselves in many ways.=20
=20
Oh but wait because they might know each that makes it different they say t=
hey are friendly and not judgmental with everyone but they too try and talk=
 shit about others like their style is better than everyone else=92s style =
or music. Why would anyone get mad at someone=92s fucked up opinion about g=
oing out at night=85 As for music again I do not give a fuck music is music=
 nothing to get all pissy about. I do not give a fuck what type of music I =
listen to that is the least of what I care about in life. Going out for the=
 music is when you run out of any real meaning of why you are going out at =
least the motive changes and that whole thought is just old. The whole I go=
 out for the music thing is old it=92s a boring reason to go out after a wh=
ile=85 So thinking you are clowning because I listen to different music onc=
e again shows you are an asshole. You are fake with your hugs and dirty swe=
aty grimy palms and your appearance is like a combo between a chubby homele=
ss dude with torn 80=92s cool guy shit.
=20
You wear way too much flare Osby LOL it is like you are crying for attentio=
n and I really think you need the soap box so you can get all the attention=
 you are begging for! You misinterpret shit because I was trying to preach =
nothing just spouting quickly typed utterances of hearsay and my feeling ab=
out some parties. Your fake heart to hearts after 12 AM in clubs=2C parties=
=2C or raves doesn=92t fool me look at where you are having them. That is s=
upposed to be real. Not real to me! Hopefully people will feel really bad a=
fter reading this and you will score some more rides home or places to slee=
p it off at. Know this I am right there laughing at you while in your head =
while you wait hours upon hours to go to a party on the bus and go home.
=20
The grammar check police should come but I do not give a fuck I type 70 wor=
ds a minute and do not care how I say it all I care is that you have now re=
ad this hahahaha=85.
=20
The sad thing is I know I could have probably hooked up at least a couple o=
f JOBS for people on this list since the person that hired me as a Paralega=
l is a good friend of mine at the law firm I work at here downtown with the=
 jobs having full health benefits paid by the firm and a livable entry leve=
l salary for those jobs. Way to many ego=92s though over stupid shit like m=
usic and I doubt any of the professionals in the office wants to hear about=
 clubs all day=2C hahahhaha it is funny as fuck though seeing people talk s=
hit and act like trolls over burning man. I do not even read the emails all=
 I need to read is the subject line and laugh cause you know someone is bei=
ng all serious about shit like burning man and trying to spell shit all cor=
rect with their rave knowledge. Hahahaha J=20
=20
Whatever the fuck you say about me or write I do not give a fuck because I =
can not stop laughing at you! Not to mention shit talking over going out an=
d music means absolutely nothing to me.
=20
Who fucking cares big deal going out is not the world and if it is to you t=
hen you are lost. What fucking person would take the bus to SF for hours on=
 end just to show up early to a fucking party just to work so one can get f=
ree admission. LOL. Cheap rave labor and if you do it enough big wow you ar=
e working at a bar because they are familiar with your sorry ass. LOL again=
.=20
Know that the next time you are taking the bus home from partying I am righ=
t there laughing in your face every minute laughing!
=20

So people really are probably good people on this list like Gearge C. who w=
rote a nice email after I said whatever the fuck I was thinking at the time=
 but I only like to laugh at SFR emails using my junk email address once in=
 a while and thought getting listings for parties was kind of cool over tim=
e and saying I only go out to get laid knowing people would freak out like =
no one else does it or has done it.=20
=20
Osby I really hope this email does not give you motivation or ideas to bett=
er yourself because that defeats the point of me laughing at you! List you =
are right I had nothing better to do then to write this email really quick =
for a good laugh on Osby in response to his email. Otherwise Osby I would h=

Subject: RE: [sfraves] osby=fake

Yes... I'm fake.. sorry!  I don't exsist & I'm just a figment of your
imagination! Yes... i'm a SFR troll bot & I'm not real!

Seriously... people been laughing @ me my whole life, so your additional
laughter don't really mean much... but if my actions bring you that much
more joy in your life... then i'm doing my job :)

I'm sorry if my reaction to your opinion offended you... i was just
expressing my opinion of your opinion I guess in a totally mean way that I
kinda didn't like mean to & I'm sorry... mondo bad reaction on my part on
a day when I probably had mondo yucky in my head & I probably used you as
a scape goat to vent my frustrations & that was wrong.. so sorry 'bout
that....

But you're orginal post on here, you even did state that "For a straight
dude in SF going to techno parties well you get the rest if you know what
I mean it is hard to find a good party with hot chicks" therefore
catagorizing yourself as 1 of them shiney scenester dudes & I was kinda
offended to when you called the underground scene "not that appealing" & 
"not that big of a deal"... for alot of us this list, it is a big deal &
we do care.. I'm just sayin' if you wanna do something else, then fine, do
it & let the rest of us do our thing...

Oh yeah.. Thanks for the hate too Isaac... your dislike towards me totally
re-affirms that I share alota Love out there for people who do care me as
much as i care about them... again, i'm sorry for your discomfort in who I
am & all that stuff.. but if you still keep laughing at me, then that's
good 'cause it means that I brought in a whole bunch of joy in your life &
that's a good thing :) YAAY!

Have fun @ them clubs with the hot chicks dude!

Take Care <3

      Olympics broadcast regulations

*Special Report:*   2008 Beijing Olympic Games
<http://intl.2008.cctv.com/index.shtml>

*CCTV's broadcasting rights*

Due to the International Olympic Committee's regulations on the
broadcasting of Olympic events, China Central Television's rights only
extend to the Chinese mainland. This means none of the CCTV
international channels will be able to broadcast the opening and closing
ceremonies, or any of the live events, from the 2008 Olympic Games.

During this period, CCTV International will broadcast a selection of
news, information, features, interviews, and entertainment programs on
the Olympics, all in strict observance of the IOC's copyright rules.

*CCTV.com's broadcasting rights*

Due to IOC's broadcasting regulations, only netizens in China mainland
and Macau can access videos related to Beijing 2008 Olympic Games via
CCTV.com.

It's recommended that viewers and netizens overseas watch Olympic events
via local RHBs TV networks and their Internet platforms. (e.g. Viewers
and netizens in the U.S. can watch Olympic events via NBC's TV networks
and its webcast)

CCTV.com will do its best to, in the timeliest manner, deliver
Games-related information with news reports featuring rich texts and
photos to every netizen for their support and attention given to CCTV.com.

I wouldn't go so far to say 'fake', but Osby's being real or not is
definitely debatable.  Are unicorns real? Faeries? Father Christmas?  Osby'=
s
complex raever majike not only allows him to stay 22 years old indefinitely
and receive free entry into almost any party, I also suspect that he knows
how to find the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
Is he 'real'? That we may never know...

Subject: Re: [sfraves] osby=fake



k, couple questions:

1) etymology of majike?  Not at all familiar with the word.

2) Isaac, wtf are you talking about?  Is this like a reply from that thread
a month ago with you needing a hundred hot girls at a party to find the
one that'll sleep with you or something?  I mean like, how many do you get
a night?

I mean, yeah, there are fewer women at techno parties in general, and fewer
still at undergrounds, but every party I've been to, there were at least a
couple total hotties, and I've generally found them to be, on average, a
whole lot more interesting than the women I've met at the more mainstream
big clubs.  Of course, maybe I'm not the dynamo that Isaac is, the last
underground I went to was the first time in a while I've been pulled into
the restroom by a couple girls, does that happen all the time at places like
Ruby Skye, or is it just for Isaac?  whatever, I've never noticed much
difference in the options I found relevant at different party spots, except
there a lot more people who fell into the "amazingly annoying" category in
the super popular spots that took time to eliminate.

More relevant to me, I'm looking to have fun, in whatever form it takes
for me.  I find more possibilities for fun at techno parties. :)

I think Lorin is right on here.  The sound camps bring a lot of value to the
festival and are a core part of many people's experience.  Countless djs and
sound camp organizers promote for and perform at Burning Man and draw a lot
of people to come.  Burning Man Org receives the revenues from this work and
there aren't even comped tickets for these folks let alone funding?  It
would be one thing if BM was a not for profit event but that is not the
case.

Sure, sound camps do fundraisers.  Which drains the economy of people making
their living in music because all of the djs are expected to perform at
these fund raisers for free or for a small portion of their normal pay.  And
the saturation of these events adversely impacts other events, venues, and
promoters.  Not to mention the fact that this is massive free advertising
for Burning Man.

Saying that Burning Man made Lorin's career seems inaccurate.  Lorin's
innovative production ideas, incredible stage presence, dj skills and
marketing genius made his career.  Try being a random person showing up in
Black Rock City with a bag full of CD's and see if you are traveling the
world next month headlining festivals and large scale events.

When I first started going to Burning Man I never gave any of this stuff
much thought.  It is one of the best parties in the world, I sincerely
believe that.  I'm not a huge magnet dj that people go to the playa to see.
But their stance on the sound camps has me questioning whether I want to
support them.  I believe that the only democracy left is where we choose to
put our dollars.

At the end of the day I will likely go back this year because all of my
friends will be there and it is a great experience.  It feels weird to me
though to know that none of my dollars are going towards the thing that I
enjoy most, and that people who work their asses off for months and months
to build spaces where I have a great time are still required to pay entrance
fees in order to show up and work more.

Sorry for the rant, this is just something I've been thinking about a lot.

I'm kind of curious here...  What's the reasoning behind the aparant  
notion in the first place, that music and sound aren't art and are  
unworthy of support?

I agree it is very wankerish to bitch about not getting free money  
that was never a given in the first place. But WTF IS the deal with NO  
music being supported?  (Or is it even true?)  Anyone actually know?

So true in EVERY area of living.  Consider it.

BUT, if there's ONE THING that truly disappoints me in the actions of 
even those I call my friends, it's the fact of hearing the 1st words out 
of their mouth regarding burningman (to someone who hasn't been) how 
"it's a GREAT PARTY".  If a more denegrading sentence could be said 
regarding The Event, I'd be interested in hearing it.  (Well, maybe the 
sexual assaults, etc. might be more, but....)

Enlighten me.

-&e->I think Lorin is right on here.  The sound camps bring a lot of value to the
-&e->festival and are a core part of many people's experience.  Countless djs and
-&e->sound camp organizers promote for and perform at Burning Man and draw a lot
-&e->of people to come.  Burning Man Org receives the revenues from this work and
-&e->there aren't even comped tickets for these folks let alone funding?  It
-&e->would be one thing if BM was a not for profit event but that is not the
-&e->case.

Almost everybody that attends BM is part of a camp, presumably doing 
something of value that propels the overall experience ahead... so where 
would this money come from?  The club/dj/draw model is ridiculous to apply 
to BM.  It costs a lot to get away with BM, that money has to come from 
*somewhere*.  Nobody is selling drinks, and thinking you brought a sound 
system which makes you a "club" while the people who visit your "club" are 
less worthy and therefore should pay more is you just not realizing they 
most likely have a camp somewhere too.  If those other camps went away 
(you know, those non-sound system camps) BM LLC would have a *bear* of a 
time justifying it's existence for 10 seconds... whether you feel it's the 
core of what BM is or not, it needs that "high concept" installation and 
visual art to justify it's not being considered a "lawless week long 
techno party".  What do you think half the yuppies that go tell their 
bosses to get the week off anyway?  It's a fire & arts festival!

-&e->Sure, sound camps do fundraisers.  Which drains the economy of people making
-&e->their living in music because all of the djs are expected to perform at
-&e->these fund raisers for free or for a small portion of their normal pay.  And
-&e->the saturation of these events adversely impacts other events, venues, and
-&e->promoters.  Not to mention the fact that this is massive free advertising
-&e->for Burning Man.

You choose to go to BM, you choose to bring a sound camp.  *shrug*.  Want 
to talk about "draining the economy".  Try looking at it the other way... 
as a local club scene that dies in the weeks coming up to and following 
BM, one of the best weekends to throw a party getting shit on by the 800 
pound gorilla even that a good part of almost every subscene in this town 
attend, etc.  The "drain" is spent on gas, gennies, rv rentals, never to 
be seen in the SF economy again.  When you tip a bartender, they tip a 
barback, who goes to your club, and the circle stays round.  Same thing 
when you pay a DJ, who goes to the store, picks up some gear from 
Robotspeak, etc.  The money you spend on your week @ Burningman just goes 
*poof* pretty much.

If you're not farting excess cash, DON'T GO TO BURNINGMAN or get a grant 
or go work DWP.  Simple.

-&e->Saying that Burning Man made Lorin's career seems inaccurate.  Lorin's
-&e->innovative production ideas, incredible stage presence, dj skills and
-&e->marketing genius made his career.  Try being a random person showing up in
-&e->Black Rock City with a bag full of CD's and see if you are traveling the
-&e->world next month headlining festivals and large scale events.

We took extremes, this probably seems almost as retarded to me as my 
statement seemed to you.  His new album which is supposed to be so "fresh" 
sounds like a ton of glitch hop/british post-nuschool downtempo I heard 
years ago.

-&e->When I first started going to Burning Man I never gave any of this stuff
-&e->much thought.  It is one of the best parties in the world, I sincerely
-&e->believe that.  I'm not a huge magnet dj that people go to the playa to see.
-&e->But their stance on the sound camps has me questioning whether I want to
-&e->support them.  I believe that the only democracy left is where we choose to
-&e->put our dollars.

Ok, so I'll give you a quarter million dollars to spend on whatever you 
want on the playa.  Spend it wisely and justify your decision.  Do you 
really want to pick favorites with an "art form" that seems to be doing 
fine at 100s of sound based camps?  Or maybe bring in some diversity.  
Remember to keep the general populace happy, and also please some of the 
people that were the thrust behind BMORG2.  I'd support a butt rock camp, 
a jazz camp, a light sculpture, a playhouse, a miniature golf course, a 
human petting zoo, an ASSCAR track, etc long before I gave a penny to 
another house/techno/whatever electronic dance music system.  It's 
overrepresented already and difficult to justify funding as most sound 
camps are low concept, not all that artistic and to the untrained ear (and 
maybe even the trained ear) very similar to one another!  Why spend money 
on something that seems to do fine without it... when there are tons of 
artists applying every year for grants to do stuff that has never been 
done before on the playa?

-&e->At the end of the day I will likely go back this year because all of my
-&e->friends will be there and it is a great experience.  It feels weird to me
-&e->though to know that none of my dollars are going towards the thing that I
-&e->enjoy most, and that people who work their asses off for months and months
-&e->to build spaces where I have a great time are still required to pay entrance
-&e->fees in order to show up and work more.

Yeah, weird.  You *can* go and not do a damn thing btw.  BM has screwed it 
up so bad now that "participating" is almost punished.

-&e->Sorry for the rant, this is just something I've been thinking about a lot.
-&e->
-&e->Eric Sharp of Rock It Science

Well written, I just don't agree.  ;)

Yo peeps, hope you can make it out to Temple tonight.  Justin is gonna
destroy it!  The last show we did there with Green Velvet was incredible.

.dotbleep Invades San Francisco!

Lineup:

Justin Long (.dotbleep, Classic, Chicago)
Tari of Trademarq (.dotbleep, Classic, Denver)
Homero Espinosa (Yerba Buena Discos)
Eric Sharp (Rock It Science, Flavor Group)
Mario Dubbz (Movement, Funk Lab)

Snag cheap tickets and skip the line:  http://www.going.com/dotbleepsf

Hope to see you there!

-The Rock It Science Team

Here we proudly introduce .dotbleep recordings. Chicago's hottest new talent
Justin Long, heir to the Derrick Carter Windy City house throne, brings you
the latest and freshest sounds to blow out of this famous city.



You have to have been doing some serious staying in not to have noticed that
Justin has been smashing clubs all over the world with his DJing skills.
His hot, fresh productions impressed 2020 Vison so much that they decided to
join forces with him to create .dotbleep. The best platform to showcase
Justin's productions was a label dedicated to his sound reflecting the
jackin' sound of nu-skool Chicago house and techno music.



Not since Green Velvet aka Cajmere has music sounded so fresh, Chicago's new
generation giving the old hands a run for their money!

Bassdrop
Thursday, August 14th 2008
Shine (1337 Mission @ 10th)
9:30pm until 2am

$5 (benefiting LoveFest)


It's been over a year since we started throwing these little Bassdrop
events, and until now, we haven't charged for a single one of them. But
this month we're asking for a measly $5, with all the profits going toward
float fees & building costs for this years LoveFest event on October 4th.
You know we love giving everyone free shit, but we hope that you can
understand why we're charging for this one. Come see why RKidz has such an
amazing reputation & help us pay for our float at the same time. You know
you wanna......

QOOL WEBSITE

Qool is the original clubbing happy hour in SF, if not the world.
 Every Wednesday evening, starting at 5pm, Jondi & Spesh host a five hour
 club night at 111 Minna in San Francisco. The music has a progressive
 theme, from prog house to breaks to techno and even drum 'n bass. Each dj
 plays a short 45 minute set, and the talent ranges from bedroom DJs to
 international supastars. Partygoers range from electronic music loving
 phreeks to unemployed dot-commers (not mutually exclusive), and the
 enthusiasm and dedication of QoÃ¶lios is world famous. In fact QoÃ¶l is
 often pegged for its personal vibe and all out "Saturday at 3AM" feeling.

Qool(taken from press release)

One of the best clubbing nights in the world starts at 5pm. Itâs
 called Qool, and it's the original clubbing happy hour in San Francisco,
 if not the world. Every Wednesday evening Jondi & Spesh host a five
 hour club night at the now infamous 111 Minna Art Gallery. The music has
 a progressive theme, from progressive house to breaks to techno, trance
 and even drum 'n bass. Each dj plays a short 45 minute set, and the
 talent ranges from bedroom DJs to international superstars like Seb
 Fontaine, Scott Bond and Lee Coombs.

QoÃ¶l began as function over form â in the early 90âs Spesh had
 bailed out of a high profile residency due to his refusal to play cheesy
 records (it was during this time that Jondi & Spesh produced their first
 tracks together), but soon missed the frequent djing. But with a full
 time job and production work on top of it, the time just wasnât
 there. The solution? Play records once a week right after work at a nearby
 art gallery. With only 6 people on average milling about the space,
 Spesh was definitely in it just to hear the music with his own ears (it is
 worth noting that at this point, Jondi was questioning Speshâs
 sanity). For months, Spesh showed up each week with his records, sometimes
 joined by other djs, and slowly the audience grew.

Nowadays, what began simply as a place for Spesh to spin tracks every
 week on his own terms became a place for hundreds of people to be
 clubbers on their own terms. The patrons of QoÃ¶l, known as QoÃ¶lios, know
 what they want and religiously show up week after week to get it.

QoÃ¶lâs most distinguishing characteristic is its vibe, a downright
 great feeling that builds into a contained fury of waving arms and
 ecstatic dancing every week. In fact its energy has been compared more than
 once to some of historyâs most revered club nights. Most recently
 Jonathan Lisle of Bedrock had this to say of his encounter with QoÃ¶l,
 âWe walked in at 7pm on a Wednesday night and I had the same feeling I
 had when I walked into the Hacienda in Manchester 12 years ago and when
 I walked in Renaissance in Mansfield in 1992. The place was
 electric.â

Now in its 8th year the story continues. Look closely through your
 record box and you will find that some of QoÃ¶lâs resident DJs have
 produced some of your favorite music on Bedrock, SAW, Renaissance, Bedrock
 Breaks, Kubist, Dorigen, and more.

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: China - Time to Know the Truth

March 10th 2008 marked the 49th anniversary of the Tibetan National Uprising. 
In the largest Pan-Tibetan protests in history, tens of thousands of Tibetans 
rose up against China's illegal invasion and occupation of their country. This 
film documents this, and China's hypocrisy in making a pledge for improved 
human rights there and in China.

Subject: [sfraves] BSPish - Most of the Fingermonsters, DJing tonight @ 222!

Shawn Allen, Matthew Kent-Stoll, and me, AKA 3/4s of The Fingermonsters, are playing DJ sets at a happy hour tonight, 222 Hyde, SF.

Techy, funky, glitchy music for gangsta leaning, or just shaking that
shit, will result- much of it fresh new stuff from our own laboratory.

6-10pm, Friday (TONIGHT!), Free!

And afterwards you can chill for No Fucking Requests Ever, which is also a time and a half.

Luv,
-George C

They even made a movie about it in 1981!

I think the article makes a good point though:

Exactly...  eventually the counter culture will go mainstream, and 
become the establishment.   Hot Topic?  How about the "pre-stressed" 
clothing that looks like what people threw away or donated to the 
homeless 15 years ago, that go for $100+.

Underground house music is all you can find in mainstream clubs now.  
Not very underground is it.

Such is life.

I really want to get Decline Pt 1 & 2 on dvd.  Haven't found'em yet though.

For sure.  My problem -- I can't wear those fuckin' asscrack jeans  
anymore.  And the ubiquitous Converse high tops have absolutely no

What's mainstream?

3 completely separate "counter-culture" businesses, porn, video games,
and the skateboarding industry* all generate revenue that is the
equivalent to, or greater than, the annual revenues of "mainstream"
Hollywood.

I posit that the good, Christian, go to church on Sunday folk are the
true minority in this country, since they are outnumbered by a ratio
of 4 to 1, since only 20% of Americans even bother to go to Church
anymore.

The problem is is that the majority hasn't woken up to the fact that
they are in the minority.

IE, another way of stating this is what the so-called mainstream
labels as the 'counter-culture', when taken as a whole, is, in fact,
*the* culture in this country.

If only we could get our shit, and money, together and get organized
at the level of say the evangelicals and/or Rush Limbaugh's 20 million
listeners are then we might begin to assert ourselves.

When Tim Russert died the mainstream media had themselves a little
circle-jerk over his passing and shortly thereafter when George Carlin
died he was characterized and marginalized as a counter-cultural icon
and nothing more. I posit the opposite is true, that George Carlin
spoke for, and reflected the beliefs of, far more Americans than that
Russert clown could have ever hoped to.

The thing that bothers me most is what a stranglehold these people
have on public morality in a country where 1 in 5 kids is born out of
wedlock and over 50% of marriages end in divorce. It took until Ronald
Reagan was elected in 1980 for a politician at the national level who
had been divorced to be acceptable. And even today we view a long term
marriage as some sort of hallmark of virtue when the truth is it's got
just as much to do with luck as anything else.

Who are these people who think they are the majority to dictate what's
right and wrong and why does anybody pay them least bit of attention?

For those interested in this thread I highly recommend Thomas Frank's book *The Conquest of Cool*.  See http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/259919.html  

Also worth a read are Heath and Potter's *Nation of Rebels* and Ken Goffman's (aka R.U. Sirius) book *Counterculture Through the Ages*.

That's kinda what I was talking about...  what was counter culture is 
now mainstream, and what was mainstream has become counter culture.

Much in the way that at some parties and events i go to I'm the only 
person there without any ink.  I'm the odd ball that's outside of the norm.

It's all a matter of perspective.  mainstream vs counterculture is 
really more about where you personally stand.  Hip Hop is very 
mainstream and was one of the biggest counter cultures to rise up out of 
the late 20th century (doubt anyone wants to argue it wasn't).  Things 
change, they flip flop, the pendulum will continue to swing.  People are 
destined to eventually become that which they hate.

Hipsters == Preppies/yuppies of the 80's

It's all the same.

I think you have to look at why counter-cultures are created in the  
first place.  Counter culture seems to be a term that is applied only  
to non-mainstream thinking groups from about 1950 on, but there have  
been many more than that.  The difference from 1950 on is you have  
Madison Ave. and you have television.  How heavily do these factors  
weigh in to single these groups out to get perhaps more attention  
than they deserve, or perhaps the wrong kind of attention?  I would  
venture to say that raves get a particularly bad rap from these  
forces, yet they live on.

The Fingermonsters Bio:

The Fingermonsters consist of George Cochrane, Cubik, Andrew Phelan and
Shawn Allen, four friends working together out of San Francisco's famed
Moulton Studios complex. Between their various solo careers and
collaborations, these four have had album and EPs out on labels such as
Amenti, Body Rhythm, Dinner Party, Drop Music, Eight-Tracks, Prismatic, So
Sound and Wide Hive. Together as The Fingermonsters, the four produce a
unique mix of big room tech house, breaks, minimal, and electro. Their live
PA is a site to behold, with all four members freaking out together onstage
on a variety of synths, drum machines, laptops, and general insanity. More
on the Fingermonsters and their label Monsta Music can be found on the site
of their label group, www.prismatictracks.com.

hey.  We'll see.  Been busy lately and just haven't had time, my

Can we get a webcam feed on Osby?  That's really all the entertainment

Subject: RE: [sfraves] NRR: Fwd: new post up: "the end of counterculture"

IMHO, The only real revolution left that has any real potential to
change society is monetary. American culture is deeply, and some would
argue irrevocably, mired in its capitalism and advertising. A lot of
people don't know the difference between expression and consumption --
i.e. they buy things that symbolize their uniqueness, and try to fill
voids in their lives by going shopping for more crap.

What would happen if people just stopped spending money? Obviously that
isn't possible... but I think all we really have to do to make a
difference is be more conscious of how we spend the money we have. Our
money is our only real voice in this society. Ask questions about the
goods you buy. Where did this come from? More importantly, do I really
need this?

You want to be a part of the REAL counterculture? Go start a commune in
Mendocino, grow your own food, make your own clothes and fuel, and
invent yourself some new forms of entertainment.

Thanks for indulging me. I know to some extent I'm preaching to the
choir here.

Rave on.

What's mainstream?

3 completely separate "counter-culture" businesses, porn, video games,
and the skateboarding industry* all generate revenue that is the
equivalent to, or greater than, the annual revenues of "mainstream"
Hollywood.

I posit that the good, Christian, go to church on Sunday folk are the
true minority in this country, since they are outnumbered by a ratio
of 4 to 1, since only 20% of Americans even bother to go to Church
anymore.

The problem is is that the majority hasn't woken up to the fact that
they are in the minority.

IE, another way of stating this is what the so-called mainstream
labels as the 'counter-culture', when taken as a whole, is, in fact,
*the* culture in this country.

If only we could get our shit, and money, together and get organized
at the level of say the evangelicals and/or Rush Limbaugh's 20 million
listeners are then we might begin to assert ourselves.

When Tim Russert died the mainstream media had themselves a little
circle-jerk over his passing and shortly thereafter when George Carlin
died he was characterized and marginalized as a counter-cultural icon
and nothing more. I posit the opposite is true, that George Carlin
spoke for, and reflected the beliefs of, far more Americans than that
Russert clown could have ever hoped to.

The thing that bothers me most is what a stranglehold these people
have on public morality in a country where 1 in 5 kids is born out of
wedlock and over 50% of marriages end in divorce. It took until Ronald
Reagan was elected in 1980 for a politician at the national level who
had been divorced to be acceptable. And even today we view a long term
marriage as some sort of hallmark of virtue when the truth is it's got
just as much to do with luck as anything else.

Who are these people who think they are the majority to dictate what's
right and wrong and why does anybody pay them least bit of attention?

Subject: [sfraves] burning man music experiment, location

http://gilesbowkett.blogspot.com/2008/08/where-to-find-me-at-burning-man.html

software-generated ambient music running continually for hours.

also doing a variable-tempo live AI drumming "laptop DJ" (not) set
which could very easily suck ass. thought I was going to have
basslines finished by now. maybe I can hack it in motels on the drive
up. the cool part is you start at a slow tempo and can take it as far
as jungle very easily.

despite bragging I may have done in past the system is pretty
bare-bones; the ambient autonomous version can do key changes,
samples, simple harmony and extremely simple basslines. I may be able
to cannibalize this code to give a Bukem-style set of pads and
basslines to the live danceable set also.

actually, that would be fucking awesome. add in a chord progression
framework on top of the key changes and you would totally have
something.

OK. doing a variable-tempo live AI drumming "laptop DJ" (not) set
which may totally suck ass and may be totally fucking awesome.

* Global Raver Blogspot *  

Social Commentary on Global Dance Music

http://globalraver.blogspot.com/

Beyond visuals and metaphysics, this is a simple, content-centric
experiment. Though personal, it focuses on sharp analysis and critical
commentary. I've already posted a few short entries on:

- Love Parade 2008
- Goa Scene History
- Journalists on the Ibiza club scene
- Laser Blindness in Moscow
- Pseudo "raves"
- Manifesto (my motivations for this project...)
- etc.

The blog also features a new link list. (I'm open to cross-post your URL,
please let me know if you want this exchange).

I hope you enjoy the Global Raver Blogspot! Post your comments, bookmark it,
and come back...

Thanks for forwarding this announcement to those who may be interested.

AD'/TT

"One of the strongest motives that lead men to art and science is escape
from everyday life with its painful crudity and hopeless dreariness, from
the fetters of one's own ever-shifting desires."-EINSTEIN

"Come Fairies, take me out of this dull world, for I would ride with you
upon the wind and dance upon the mountains like a flame!" - W.B.YEATS

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: This Thursday - The Fingermonsters @ Down Like This!!!

Thursday, August 28th
Down Like This @ Temple (66 Natoma St entrance)
No Cover

Catacombs:

The Fingermonsters (Monsta Music) - Live PA!
Tycho Sean
Swing

Destiny Lounge:

Disco Night!!!
DJs TBA

The Fingermonsters Bio:

The Fingermonsters consist of George Cochrane, Cubik, Andrew Phelan and
Shawn Allen, four friends working together out of San Francisco's famed
Moulton Studios complex. Between their various solo careers and
collaborations, these four have had album and EPs out on labels such as
Amenti, Body Rhythm, Dinner Party, Drop Music, Eight-Tracks, Prismatic, So
Sound and Wide Hive. Together as The Fingermonsters, the four produce a
unique mix of big room tech house, breaks, minimal, and electro. Their live
PA is a site to behold, with all four members freaking out together onstage
on a variety of synths, drum machines, laptops, and general insanity. More
on the Fingermonsters and their label Monsta Music can be found on the site
of their label group, www.prismatictracks.com.

wow.. at least we know where they were getting their speed. tharin is a 
pretty uncommon name though. i'm sure a bobby kennedy type scenario has 
been already thought out though.

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: FRIDAY, FAKTION:: MICRON, STML, RAF1 @ ANU BAR SF and live on
 radio integrated

WHEN:
Friday Aug 29th

WHERE:
Anu-Bar 43 Sixth St., San Francisco, CA
10pm to 2am 21+ Cost:$5, free b4 11pm
ladies free b4 midnight!!


Faktion is once again proud to present some of the best in bay area 
techno talent!

with DJs:

Micron FnF

STML DEF

RAF1 Gold-Code.net

i've got to say this is a pretty dope line up. Faktion usually turns it 
out with each Faktion monthly.. on each and every last friday of the 
month.. and with this month its no exception:


Micron has been a staple of the San Francisco underground for more than 
10 years. Whether hes playing at Revolution or posing as the stable 
pillar of excellence at the infamous Friends and Family parties, Micron 
has always brought something fresh and new to the table. His style of 
techno focuses on a clean, professional, no-nonsense approach with a 
serious determination to make the party go off!

STMLs vast knowledge of music, technical ear and mixing talent are 
immediately noticeable once he steps behind the decks. Taking a 
subtractive approach to mixing, STML prefers to keep it cool while 
taking you to places in techno that are often unfamiliar... yet at the 
same time oh so sick!

RAF1 is a veteran of the SF techno club scene and has been making a name 
for himself as a blogger as of late on gold-code.net. You may say blog.. 
so what? What you may underestimate is the importance of this blog on 
the outlook and history of where technos true roots and influences lay. 
Gold-code.net isnt so much a diggers blog, but is a reference for 
where techno soul came from and where the influences of technos past 
collide with modern days trends.


also.. Broadcasting live from Anu it's another installment of Radio 
Integrated! We've come out of hibernation to bring this party live and 
direct to the world at large.


please find details below:
http://www.defsf.com/radiointegrated/integrated or subscribe to the 
links below at the footer of this message.


Tune in to Radio Integrated, broadcasting live from Faktion from 
10pm-2am Pacific this Friday night at::

http://radio.defsf.com:1200

peace, love, respect

I'm really looking forward to this.  I haven't seen Raf-One in years and 
it'll be a pleasure to dance to Micron's beats once more.  :)

love always

Haha, well, Mrs. Clinton suggested a Bobby Kennedy type situation not too
long ago. That was at the forefront of her mind until Obama won the
nomination. Politics is a gentle sport.

"Federal authorities say the pair's rants while on a methamphetamine 
binge do not meet the legal standard for filing charges, despite their 
possession of rifles and sniper scopes."

I think it's safe to say anything somebody says while on a meth binge 
should typically be discarded.

yeah it's not minimal. i call it new techno or neo minimal myself. if i 
had anything to say about current techno is that it has way more of what 
original techno had before it became minimal the first time around. the 
road where the first minimal went, fizzled out in 99-02ish. you would 
have to thank cologne for it's love of the roots of techno and it's 
minimal edge and divergences amid the late 90s 'swechno' scene for wheat 
techno has become today. i would agree that minimal is a bad term for 
what techno is now. i would prefer to just call it techno and get on 
with it.

while we're at it:
trance is not techno
nor is electro house any close reference to actual electro.

Yeah, I meant to post about the Delia Derbyshire (dr who) stuff earlier.
There's a sample dance music she did (the one she says is "for interest only")
which sounds pretty modern actually (keep in mind it's from 1963), sounds
a lot like Dinky's "Acid in my fridge" or something.  There's a pic of
her working at a reel-to-reel console in classic DJ pose, too. :)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] From DJ Bone about the "new" minimal.

lol... I read the same thing from his blog too... & I was sooo LOLing like
too much 'cause he like used like tiny font when wrote out the word
"minimal"...

man.. i remember when Forest & Chris did minimal mondays at hush hush back
in the day & it was a fun lil weekly to go to 'cause there was hella
family hangin' out, but I dunno man... the minimal techno, micro house
dealie I heard like the 1st time i went there... it just didn't do
anything for me, 'cause I wanted to dance & I couldn't... it was still fun
to listen to & like seat dance... but yeah...

I mean... Forest had to sit me down & explain to me the kinda music it was
& all this n that.. & I tried hard to dance to it like I would to normal
techno, but it still didn't do anything for me then... & I can still
listen to it now, but I Love my Floor Stompin' Techno Yummy instead...

it's still fun music no doubt! :)

I like emusic.com for their price point, although their selection is uneven.
There's some great stuff on there, though, from major labels, and some
prereleases, too. I've been happy with a lot of the house and techno I've
found on emusic.

i think he was looking for places to buy vinyl, online.

for hard to find vinyl, i sometimes go to ebay.  but you're
paying premium price for sure.  then again, i've never seen my
ebay-purchased records in stores.  you can also buy vinyl from
sellers on discogs.com (also highly inflated).

for mp3s, i HATE emusic.  their search function is awful, as
well as their listening station.  

beatport is by far the best online resource for mp3s that i've
found.  the ability to sort and categorize to such a granular
level makes it easier for me to find the stuff i want.  i only
wish they had longer samples - sometimes i download my
freshly-bought tracks only to find that the rest of the song is
boring or stupid.

dance records.com, i would agree, is by far the best.. htfr.co.uk still 
for old stuff. for really good old shit check out GEMM.com. when you 
can't find it anywhere else go to gemm and they will have 4 copies of it 
in mint condition.

 4 walk inz amoeba still has good stuff if you know what you're looking 
for. but don't go in there looking for anything in particular. let it 
find you. be sure to get your fingers dusty, that's the fun of vinyl `;)

i still am saddened by the loss of bpm `;( and we'll miss you open mind.

i think soundworks is still around on valencia? they still rock.

peace love vinyl.. and er 128k mp3 lol `;)

The Blipswitch guys and I both had club parties last night.  I was actually
surprised I got a good turnout at Anu, Thursday night's EndUp crowd was way
smaller than mine I think.  Sounds like Blipswitch had an even bigger turnout
for Crazy Larry at 222.  

Anyone got deets on either Spurning Man or the renegade?  I feel like doing
something (always need to unwind after my own parties) relaxing but musical.

dance records.com, i would agree, is by far the best.. htfr.co.uk still 
for old stuff. for really good old shit check out GEMM.com. when you 
can't find it anywhere else go to gemm and they will have 4 copies of it 
in mint condition.

4 walk inz amoeba still has good stuff if you know what you're looking 
for. but don't go in there looking for anything in particular. let it 
find you. be sure to get your fingers dusty, that's the fun of vinyl `;)

i still am saddened by the loss of bpm `;( and we'll miss you open mind.

i think soundworks is still around on valencia? they still rock.

peace love vinyl.. and er 128k mp3 lol `;)

Subject: [sfraves] bsp:techno listmania

i'm unsure about how people feel in general about "one more list to 
read" but i sometimes feel a lot of people are missing out. i have a 
couple of announce lists you might be interested in reading. usually 
they are mostly about techno related events in the bay as well as mixes 
and sometimes commentary.. which is what def-announce is mostly about. 
the other list is an announce list for our internet radio program, 
'radio integrated' which airs live usually every friday. the radio 
integrated programming features guests from all over the west coast. if 
you subscribe to def announce you would get information on the radio 
programming as well.. so it is advised that if you are solely interested 
in hearing about the internet broadcasts, then the radio integrated list 
is for you. `;)

usually the integrated broadcasts are all good fun with an open house, 
byob and potluck food policy in a loft type atmosphere. we keep the 
volume down to decent level, everyone gets smashed and it's pretty 
social affair with good times generally had by all.

i would invite anyone who shares an interest in techno to at least check 
it out for a month, and if you are not jiving on it, just unsub.

techno news & info: def-announce-subscribe@defsf.com
DEF radio info: radio-integrated-subsctibe@defsf.com

much love and respect to everyone keeping it real out there. `;)
