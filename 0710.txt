I only wear Carhart pants.

They're tough, rugged, they look ok (pass for slacks) and they last 10x 
longer than regular jean.  They rock.

Jeans, shorts, over alls, jackets, etc.  They make a wide assortment.  
100% American materials and American made.  Say what you want about the 
gov't, but that means jobs for people that live here so they can put 
food on their tables.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] (nrr) QOD (Tue)

Ya, I mean, I'm not against genetically modified foods.  My problem is 
we really don't know the long term effects of such. 

You stance on the subject is one we have heard before.  In the 50's they 
sprayed DDT all over.  Right onto kids talking about how safe and 
wonderful it was.  We know how that story ended.  Early adopting is fine 
and you're right, as long as things are labeled correctly, and people 
are given a choice I'm all for it.  Personally, I don't want to early 
adopt with my body.  I'll save that for my computers.

Aspartame has been found to eat holes in brain tissue.

Hydrogenated oils were originally designed to be healthy.  The logic is 
sound.  If pepel are eating oils and it's bad for you, create a single 
chain molecule that only contains half the chain.  Great idea!  
Unfortunately our bodies have no idea how to process a fat chain that's 
been split and augmented with a hydrogen molecule to close it off, so, 
we store it until we figure out what to do.  Typically you don't get rid 
if it until there nothing less then our mysterious chemical factories 
manage to break it down and expel it.  Until then, it's the gut.  Is it 
any wonder we have an obesity problem in this nation?

This is further complicated by the fact that it's VERY hard to buy 
anything in a grocery store outside of organic that doesn't contain 
hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated products.

I would LOVE labeling that right on the front says if it contains trans 
fats, and hydrogenated oils.  It would make my shopping a lot easier.  
It also means that there's a lot of products I won't buy, and those 
companies will pitch a huge fit saying that such labeling will hurt 
their business.  They're 100% right. 

A few years ago I lost a lot of weight.  I did this in a very simple 
way.  I stopped intaking sugar.  This was very hard.  I also stopped 
eating anything with hydrogenated products or trans fats.  I went down 3 
pant sizes in a year without getting off my ass.  The thing with the 
hydrogenated products is we had no idea what the effects were for over 
20 years.  Meanwhile it was saturated into our food supply without any 
notice or warning.

the pollen, I'm not eating corn out of a can anymore, only if it's =20

I'm not too into genetically modified foods myself, especially after =20

the pollen, I'm not eating corn out of a can anymore, only if it's =20
locally grown.  I am now more and more trying to just get the fruits =20

dairy place that has real butter and creamline milk, etc. and there's =20
usually some good local bread places.  basically local, local, and =20

the most part but you're paying for the convenience of not having to =20

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) QOD (Tue)

--

Today, we need a nation of Minutemen, citizens who are not only
prepared to take arms, but citizens who regard the preservation of
freedom as the basic purpose of their daily life and who are willing
to consciously work and sacrifice for that freedom.


By calling attention to 'a well regulated militia,' the 'security' of
the nation, and the right of each citizen 'to keep and bear arms,' our
founding fathers recognized the essentially civilian nature of our
economy.  Although it is extremely unlikely that the fears of
governmental tyranny, which gave rise to the Second Amendment, will
ever be a major danger to our nation, the Amendment still remains an
important declaration of our basic civilian-military relationships, in
which every citizen must be ready to participate in the defense of his
country.  For that reason I believe the Second Amendment will always
be important.

- John F. Kennedy

Subject: [sfraves] need techno help....

i'm looking for a co-conspirator to assist me with my internet radio 
broadcasts at DEFsf.com. i've been pushing this site along solo for a 
number of years and its gotten a little down in the mouth over the years 
but as of late DEFsf on the cusp of making a comeback (crossing toes).

here's the location at defsf.com for radio integrated
http://www.defsf.com/integrated
(there are still some dead links because the site still isn't finished.. 
its still very much a work in progress)


if you are interested in being a internet jock for DEFsf.com hit me up! 
i could really really use the help.

as internet radio head for defsf your duties would be as follows:
look for west coast techno and electro artists and djs
manage the defsf.com internet radio playlist
manage the inernet radio web page on defsf.com
update the playlist on a monthly basis

experience with shoutcast and simple html is a plus but not vital...

i'm also looking for just general help with the site as well. if you'd 
be down to volunteer time i'd love to hear from you.

Subject: [sfraves] My WR part 1: LoveFest 07 & the :codeTV stuff :n)

OK.. So Friday night.. i no go out 'cause i wanted to rest for the
loooooong day ahead... my Mom decided that it'd be Groovy to throw my Pops
a bday party since his bday was 2 days prior.. ok.. so hella food, hella
relatives, & GAMBLING!!!  I mean.. they made the garage into a card parlor
& I even had 1 drunk Uncle like going outside every 15 minutes takin' a
piss in the plants!  In the kitchen, my Mom & all my Aunties played
Majong!  So i was pretty much up in my room w/ my cat Pheobe watchin TV &
tryin' to sleep.. but all the laughing & majong tile shuffling & uncles
hitting the card table 'til 4AM kept me up & even still i couldn't sleep
afterwards 'cause i do have fucked up raver weekend sleeping patterns...
so all in all.. i probably managed to get 1/2 an hour sleep if any.. oh
well...

So by 6AM.. i woke up from already being awake & got ready.. i was outta
the house & was at the stage area/ 111 Minna by 8:20... oh yeah.. i saw a
DR Keith Ablo look alike on the BART train... but yeah... hours past, the
floats all slowly came & it all fuckin' went dooooooooown!!! :)

Love Fest 2007
-=-=-=-=-

So this year again.. i was a Wheel Monitor for the BADNB float & that was
pretty easy this year!!  I mean.. last year.. it was really messy getting
people to move over 'cause Hello 2Day.. you'll get hit by the float kinda
dealie.. & i still don't get the need to run directly infront of a moving
vehicle like strait across... wtf is up with that man?  But yeah.. it was
Awesome seein' some of y'all down market while i dragged my tired ass down
the street :)  Actually... seein' y'all got me kinda hyper & oooh.. the
ch00nage that was comin' from the float.. YUMMMY!!!  All the DJs on BADNB
tore it fuckin' UP!!

The procession towards the end was kinda weird this time.. like the City
is getting harder on us float people now & we had to turn off our music
upon entering Civic.. everyone involved with the float had to be riding...
it jus seemed so strict now.. but as soon our music blasted up again...
the same crowd that was following us down market was right there brockin'
the fuck out!!  Loved it!!  Then when we went to our parkin spot on the
corner, the crowd slowly built up.. HELLO 2DAY.. it was so fuckin' ILL!! 
I Loved it!!

I didn't walk around too much, but i did stop over the KONTROL float for a
bit!!  That was Dope!!  YUM!!  Well.. i was there pretty much alot 'cause
i was always sitting on the step @ City Hall... so yeah.. @ one point the
KONTROL float was spinning all this yummy Techno & the float next to it, i
think it was Supper Club, was playing all this Tech House.. I was in Yummy
Heaven!!!  I also did get ice cream.. so that was Pretty Dope also!!
 YAAAAY

I mean.. 'cause of my not so much yummy needed mondo sleep i sohulda got..
i was kinda on edge i guess & kinda tired the whole day & sat as much as
possible during LF... but mixed w/ the hyper i got from seein' every1 I
saw... & the music... i did pretty good stayin' up eerrrr.. awake rather
w/ minimal assistance of caffine.. i barely even had 1 red bull the whole
day know that i think about it.. or drink any coke for that matter.. oh
well... next year i guess! :)

ok

:codetv
=-=-=-=-

In the staging area in the morning from when the parade started, we
managed to get alot of  interveiws with people everywhere all up n down
2nd street.. then after a few hours of running around interviewing people,
then i did my Wheel MOnitor duties...

So then we got to like Civic for the festival part... again... it was
fun... but i was so tired yada yada yada.. i think though... when we all
met up in the VIP Lounge, like well.. i started seein' more and like more
familiar faces.. so that was Fun & it like got me hyper.. then like I
literally jumped on the interview ball & w/in an hour, interviewed like
7-8 DJs & made some new friends!!!

We taped somemore outside.. did some MOS interviews... then everything
just went yummy 'til i had to leave... but it was fulfilling & So Dope to
do that!!!

So my whole LF experience this year was overalll fun!!! YAAAAY

Subject: [sfraves] MY WR part 2: HELLO 2DAY: EKLEKTIC!!!!

OK.. so like i had to like cut early from LF to well... i was told to help
"load in" by 6:30 at like Cat Club,  but there really wasn't much to
design the club with when the decorations came in... so we just like
kicked it 'til 8PM... i ended up workin' door for a bit & missed Mikey J's
& someone elses set in the back... but in the front, like ummm.. Frogger
then Jammin were bad ass w/ their breaks & dubstep sets :)

The whole night at EK was fuckin' sick... i mean... i literally felt like
i was Home again 'cause everything just felt so like familiar & missing
from my life.. that whole vibe, that whole feeling of just being
surrounded by my EK familia & the freaks, the punks, the Sat night Folsum
st club hoppers, & everyone who was there!!!

OK.. in the back, like everyone spun bad ass sets, no doubt, but as soon
as Star Eyes got on the decks... i mean.. this girl does not hold back &
she just went strait up hard, jumpy, techy, all that yummy jungle shit I
love well.. 4Real spun a bad ass set too I mean.. he totallly broke the
back room for me 'cause he always drops the choonage i Love dancing too...
but it felt more like home when Star Eyes was up there & I swear... i was
dancinmg my ass off!!!  Sage went on after her & continued the fuckin'
madness... ooh man.... i hella had music gasms dancing & the whoooole
floor was brokin' out heeella hard!!!

Up front... like Felix got on the decks & played hella Techno... which was
funny 'cause well.. well.. alota people weren't used to it... Then.. OK..
Hello 2Day.. when Ms. E got on.. she kinda started out kinda like plunky
minimal kinda breaks.. but built up from there...  UFO spun in both
rooms.. in the front, he dropped alota breaks mixed with alota 4 on the
floor craaaazy beats he made.. it was fuckin' sick!!!  OK.. then in the
back room... he dropped alooooooota well.. i call his music marching band
dnb 'cause that's what it sounds like...

OK... I gotta go step by step here 'cause it just well... where everything
got reeeeeally emotional...  the music up front stopped, so everyo9ne
headed to the back to brock out to UFO... alota people were gone, so like
1/2 the club was still there, & that's alota people still... so were in
the back hella dancing our asses off.. UFO started droppin' classics... MC
Duh was on the mic & oh yeah... Audio Angel was MCing to & they switched
off alot... but yeah.. so UFO's spinning, Duh's spitting... & everything
just got way nostalgic & i hella got that feeling in my tummy like i was
nervous, but excited.. & we were all dancing, yelling, some of us were in
tears 'cause it was like the last set & we knew it... but like the GS crew
was back there & we were just lookin' @ each other smiling & dancing &
laughing & it was like 1 of them moments, ya know?!  Then the music
stopped 'cause the bouncer made that hand gesture knife across the neck
motion & alota us just stood there for a sec then like looked @ each other
& hugged.,... ya know... it was seriously like touching 'cause yeah...

But fuck man... it was just fuckin' Sick!!  I mean... i've gone through
alot w/ GS & each person in it.. like ummmm... I can't properly describe
what i felt during UFO's set, excpet that it was just fuckin' Ill!!!  I
can honestly say that I was more touched & inspired at Eklektic than i was
@ LoveFest This year... i mean.. LP/ LF always gave me this mondo buzz
days/ weeks after, but shit man... I been soooo fuckin' like hardcore
mondo afterglowin high from Eklektic just 'cause that night/ early morning
touched me sooo much in yet ways i can't still describe, ok.. well.. being
with alota people i hardcore Love is 1 of them.. the music... jsut
everything i guess... reflecting on all the nostalgia & yet looking foward
to what's gonna happen next i guess too... I mean.. does that make sense?

All i know is that i had a bad ass Groovy time, all the people i gave
flyers to @ LF were there... the vibe was sooo thick of people excited to
be there, & the music.. oh my fuckin' goodness.. Mondo Fuckin Ill!!!  For
me personally, i just felt all these emotions inside swirling around &
danced harder than i have in a long time that night 'cause there was
something spiritual i was feeling & just alota fluffy yummy goodnes man!!!

Good morning friends!

To the SF heads, I am new to the list and am a techno dj/party thrower on t=
he east coast. Your input would be much appreciated.

IMO,
new ideas from people all over on how parties should look/feel/sound is
very welcome. I am very interested in new ideas and concepts so we
don't fall into the same old same old trap.

Of late I have been intrigued by
minimal flyer design, specifically along the lines of constructivism,
and of course the work mathew hawtin and the m_nus crew.
Are they are examples out there on teh internets that you find intriguing, =
compelling/exciting/titilating ?
if so, send me links!
And of course, any discussion regarding things that you would like to see b=
eing done at parties besides the usual is always a good thing!



thank you!


Sinestro

Definitely a SICK night - ran into a ton of headz.  Good to be
back - I used to do flyer promotion for EK back when it was on
Minna.  

Wish I could have stayed longer, but my friend was getting
claustrophobic, and we needed to meet up with a friend at
Temple.

But on a more serious note, interactive environmentals
are a neet-o thing -- they can be as simple a long
drapes with projections on them that the audience can
move, thusly creating a different appearance, or as
complex as stuff on this site:

It's hard to beat the wow factor of an interactive
environment.

wow!
thats pretty nifty stuff. I could probably start small with something like =
that and grow it.
little stuff like set up a couple nintendos (old school ones) at various tv=
's for people to play for example, then add things.

the general idea is nice though. give people more to do then just dance and=
 drink.

wow!
thats pretty nifty stuff. I could probably start small with something like =
that and grow it.
little stuff like set up a couple nintendos (old school ones) at various tv=
's for people to play for example, then add things.

the general idea is nice though. give people more to do then just dance and=
 drink.

Subject: [sfraves] srr: Howl against censorship

>From today's Chronicle

http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2007/10/03/MN0PSIM67.DTL

"Fifty years ago today, a San Francisco Municipal
Court judge ruled that Allen Ginsberg's Beat-era poem
"Howl" was not obscene. Yet today, a New York public
broadcasting station decided not to air the poem,
fearing that the Federal Communications Commission
will find it indecent and crush the network with
crippling fines.

Instead of broadcasting the poem on the air today, New
York listener-supported radio station WBAI will
include a reading of the poem in a special online-only
program called "Howl Against Censorship." It will be
posted on www.pacifica.org, the Internet home of the
Berkeley-based Pacifica Foundation, because online
sites do not fall under the FCC's purview."

"Howl Against Censorship?"  How ironic...

"Where the First Amendment is implicated, the tie goes to the
speaker, not the censor"
- Chief Justice John Roberts, commenting on the McCain-Feingold
law, the same day the high court ruled 5-4 against student
Joseph Frederick in his suspension for showing a "Bong Hits
4 Jesus" banner.

"Opinions are my own only, and do not necessarily represent those of
KZSU Radio or Stanford University." (or words to that effect.)

Saturday, October 6th, 2007

[ K O N T R O L ]

minimal techno + avant-house
every 1st Saturday @ The Endup


featuring from Detroit via Berlin:

DANIEL BELL aka DBX

( Accellerate . Tresor . Logistic . Peacefrog . 7th City . Perlon )

Rightfully considered to be one of the pioneers of the minimal techno
genre, the legendary Daniel Bell returns to SF for an unprecedented
fourth appearance at [KONTROL].  Dan, whom we jokingly refer to as our
"unofficial 5th resident", is just so damn good, we'd probably book
him every month if he'd let us.


and from Chicago:

BILLY DALESSANDRO  :  LIVE

( SiteHolder . Harthouse . Force Inc . Resopal )

SiteHolder Records' Billy Dallessandro has devastated the decks of SF
a few times in the last year, but he's never played here LIVE... until
now. In support of his third long player "Into The Atom" just released
on Harthouse, this talented and prolific artist is coming prepared to
give us a serious live set lashing


and [KONTROL] residents:

SAMMY D  ( Classic . Utensil )
CRAIG KUNA   ( Concept SF . ESDJCO )
ALLAND BYALLO   ( Leibe*Detail . Nightlight Music )
NIKOLA BAYTALA   ( Robsoul . S.W.A.T. )

DANIEL BELL (aka DBX)

Born in Sacramento, California, Daniel Bell grew up outside of
Toronto, Canada, and then moved to Detroit where he collaborated with
Richie Hawtin as Cybersonik for three years on Plus 8 Records. In
1991, he started his own label, Accelerate, on which he released his
influential releases as DBX. Based on nearby Chicago "track" records,
he reduced that sound further into funky, streamlined grooves. The
formula proved to be successful and helped launch a new aesthetic in
techno and house music known as "minimal".

With the overwhelming success of his "Losing Control" single in 1994,
Daniel set up 7th City Distribution in order to assist smaller Midwest
labels to get distribution in overseas markets. He also created three
new labels - 7th City, Elevate and Harmonie Park. In 2000, he
relocated to Berlin, Germany, and released his first mix CD, "The
Button-Down Mind of Daniel Bell", on Tresor Records, followed in 2003
by "The Button-Down Mind Strikes Back!" He since has produced a series
of remixes for a diverse range of artists, includng John Tejada,
Pantytec, Akufen and John Thomas. He has spent the last 3 years
traveling and DJing around the world.

Dan is playing a grand total of five gigs in North America in 2007.
We are truly honored to be able to say two of them are for us. To be
honest, we'll pretty much book this guy anytime he's available...he's
just that good!  His last appearance in January (with Matthew
Dear/Audion live) was probably the craziest any of us had EVER seen
the Endup.  What's in store this time? I guess we'll have to find out.

BILLY DALESSANDRO (aka Huge Hephner)

Chicago native Billy Dalessandro first brought his unique production
style to the forefront of the electronic music community in 2002. The
five years since then have seen him release two full length albums,
nearly 20 original EPs, and a slew of remixes. His works have found
their way into the record bags of many respectable DJs, as well as
some of the most prestigious jocks' compilations.

Recently he established his own labels Siteholder and UnCut with
friends Brian Ffar and Daniel Mnookin which have already gained
massive feedback on each of the 7 releases. Standouts include "Don`t
Sleep" on SH001 and "That Trick She Knows" on SH002, both of which
were charted and played by many top DJs.  His latest release
"Blackjack" on Sonicutlure 006 is a jacking dancefloor bomb.

Billy will be in Europe from mid October to early December in support
of his just-released LP on Harthouse, after which he'll make stops in
select US cities. "Into the Atom", Dalessandro's third full length
album, takes listeners on a voyage into the bits and pieces of what
separates the average tracks from the very best.  Similar to the role
an atom plays in the molecular build up of all things on this planet,
the release exemplifies the minute twists and turns Dalessandro takes
with his music that help define him as among the true artists in the
production field.  It separates those who build the bandwagon from
those who wait until its completion to hop aboard.  Billy undeniably
belongs to the former of the two.

Subject: [sfraves] Bam and the greasy tan naked man!

This one should definitely go in the SFR scrapbook, if there is such a thing.

(Thanks for playing along btw, Bam.)  <----Best float overseer guy ever!


Here it is folks....

Bam and the greasy tan naked man!   (not work friendly, duh)

http://www.kontrolsf.com/GB/LF07/bam_and_naked_man.jpg

I hear that by day this guy is a gynecologist.  ...eeeww.

...not Bam, dummy, the other guy. ;)



Thanks to everyone that made it out to dance by our float and
supported at the afterparty.  I haven't had that much fun in a long
time.

We'll definitely be back next year!


Here's a couple lil' videos from our float.

My roommate J.Phlip made the song in the background, and Worthy from
dirtybird is the guy taking the video.
http://tinyurl.com/35aj8k

Here's another vid from later on when Claude VonStroke hopped on to
tag with Alland for a bit...
http://tinyurl.com/3x4ruy

I have a few more cool vids that i took myself, but some are too big
(over 100mb) to put up on YouTube.  Does anyone know how to shrink the
res or crop .mov files to make them smaller?


Man, what a fun day!  Already looking forward to 2008!

Thanks again, everyone.

That guy takes the phrase "jerk off artist" to a whole new level.

The tan guy is odd as well.

i think if i could write the man in this picture a letter, it would say
this:

"dear sir, while i do not fully understand your decision to dress [sic] in
this manner while in public, i nonetheless respect your right to do so,
especially in this fine city, and almost even admire the courage it must
take to face the world as god made you.  my only question for you is
this:  i can clearly see the tip of your appendage, but.. um, how shall i
phrase this... where's the rest?"

seriously, tho. you'd think if you were hung like a pencil eraser you'd be
hiding that shit in shame for eternity. not this guy.  where are all the
naked dudes with the bigass johnsons hanging halfway to their knees?  you
never see that shit. it's always these tiny dick mofos that feel the need to
show 'em off.

so what makes these dudes want to do this? really, can someone explain it to
me?

entertaining, no doubt, either way.

maybe they just like making people smile and laugh.  the last true
humanitarians. ;)


-------? gb


p.s.  since were already sharing pics, i might as well throw this one in
too.

you can tell this guy means business... he's wearing his minimal scarf.

That's actually a woman, with a ping-pong ball as a clitoris-

But I like this person's shadows projected on their chest-
It looks like two birds fighting over a piece of meat.

True story: I once threatened to sue Microsoft for republishing a haiku I 
wrote without my permission.

Here it is:

Windows NT crashed.

> Born in Sacramento, California, Daniel Bell grew up outside of

> techno and house music known as "minimal".
>=20
> With the overwhelming success of his "Losing Control" single in 1994,
> Daniel set up 7th City Distribution in order to assist smaller Midwest
> labels to get distribution in overseas markets. He also created three
> new labels - 7th City, Elevate and Harmonie Park. In 2000, he
> relocated to Berlin, Germany, and released his first mix CD, "The
> Button-Down Mind of Daniel Bell", on Tresor Records, followed in 2003
> by "The Button-Down Mind Strikes Back!" He since has produced a series
> of remixes for a diverse range of artists, includng John Tejada,
> Pantytec, Akufen and John Thomas. He has spent the last 3 years

>=20
> Dan is playing a grand total of five gigs in North America in 2007.

not a problem.  PM me your first and last name (as seen on your id)
and i'll hook it up. :)  i'm assuming you'll have a camera along then?
;)

should be a fun one.  dan's playing 1 - 4am, with billy's SF live set
debut to follow.  if you haven't heard billy, you're in for a treat!
he's bad ass.

for the rest of you po' folk.... the party is FREE until 11pm!

the always-stellar Nikola Baytala plays 10-11 too, followed by Craig,
then Sammy, so it's not like you're gonna have to sit thru a bunch of
crap.  come down early and spend those first $15 at the bar instead of
the door. beer is good for you.

+1 on all that. i had a lot of fun at this party. i had kinda just planned to stop by and drop off flyers to forest, but i ended up dancing my ass off and closing the place down! fortunately i missed the minimal/micro stuff (not really my style) and showed up in time to catch chel-c's super melodic all-hardware dopeness. those were some good tunes, almost proggy at times, but with enough of an edge to stay in the land of delicious techno beats. then forest came on and just blew the place up. *that* is dancefloor techno, imo. i bounced until the lights came up. 

fun night indeed, and a bit unexpected.

it was a sweet bonus running into nico, squelchy, covert, and the rest of the homies. see you all soon :)

love,
mo

nico <nico@viberation.com> wrote: What a fun night.

Was getting bummed about the minimal house.  Heard a few really great bass-heavy tracks and I started getting my hopes up.

Chel-C rocked it.  It was good beat-driven techno with melodic overlays.  Reminded me of the way Veanne would play her jungle.

Then Forrest came and threw it down.  I had to leave because my old bones need to be ready for tomorrow.  No way I can survive that onslaught if I pre-party too hard.

k, if that's how you girls do techno, do it all day and all night.  I had so much fun.

OH MY GOD SUCH A GOOD OMEN.

love always

n i c o

p.s. Some sensitive kid named Andy who goes by Toro Toro got all butthurt because I said minimal is not techno, and I said it was basically acid house, weak beat, or microhouse.  I'm not sure which set him off but he wasn't having it.

Looks great!  I might stroll through for a bit.

word! it's nice to see some excitement about the party on this list :)
we're super pumped about this one after having so much fun last year.

you can bring booze into this place, but we're probably going to have some keg action and a little bar setup, so prepare to get sloppy! 

oh yeah, sorry for the lame formatting on my original message - i don't know what happened there. it might be better to just stick to the flyers:

Seems like a good time to let everyone know that I'll be having Chel-c 
down to KZSU for another live set on October 18th.  Don't miss out on 
another chance to hear her in action!!

What a fun party!!  Thanks all for the kind words, I'm so glad everyone had
fun and enjoyed my music too.

I am still finding this whole 'techno being moderately popular' thing to be
weird. But great!  I'm trying not to question it.

I'd love to play out more often... lugging that gear around is great
exercise.  ;)

Yay for the Techno.  <3

Love Chelsea F.

Uh sure, I'm always down for experimentation, and I have 
projectors and stuff.

But for me right now, I'm on a different tangent, I'm making a 
big software jump (from GridPro to Modul8, or VDMX), so most of 
me free time will be focused on the learning curve with that.

To clarify what I have today is *some* work in progress, required hardware and software, and the interest in taking it further.  Nothing I have right now is a finished thing I can install at your party...

I'd be interested in hooking up with others that would be interested in seeing what we could do though, especially someone that does visuals and has a full visual set up.  Terry?

Best,

Peter

I have a strong interest in this area.  Specifically, I'm interested in using image processing and pattern recogntion tools generally employed in surveillance and security applications to drive projections and visualizations, lighting, or even robots or other stuff.

I also have access to some hi res cameras, computers, and related kit...but not as much free time too code stuff up as I'd like.  Anyone else interested in this sort of thing?

Regards,

Peter

A kissing booth filled with goth girls in latex
catsuits!!


But on a more serious note, interactive environmentals
are a neet-o thing -- they can be as simple a long
drapes with projections on them that the audience can
move, thusly creating a different appearance, or as
complex as stuff on this site:
http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/

It's hard to beat the wow factor of an interactive
environment.

Subject: [sfraves] Fumiya Tanaka ::Filter:: performance now available on Freqbox.net

Hey all,

We just added Fumiya Tanaka's set from April's Filter party at Fat
City to the Freqbox music player. It's been a long time coming, but
it's been definately worth the wait.

Check it out by visiting the Freqbox Music Feed on :: freqbox.net

Streams beautifully. No downloads necessary.

Enjoy!!

Check out more amazing craft from Tanaka's Op.Disc label on beatport.
Their material is finally available in a digital format thanks to all
the global bridgebuilding going on in the techno world.

Anyhow...

Looks great! I might stroll through for a bit.

word! it's nice to see some excitement about the party on this list :)
we're super pumped about this one after having so much fun last year.

you can bring booze into this place, but we're probably going to have some keg action and a little bar setup, so prepare to get sloppy! 

oh yeah, sorry for the lame formatting on my original message - i don't know what happened there. it might be better to just stick to the flyers:

see you all soon...

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: I'm DJing at the Heat The Street Faire (SF's Burning Man
 Decompression Party) this Sunday

Hey lovelies!
I just wanted to inform you all that I will be DJing on the 19th Street Stage 
for this year's San Francisco Burning Man Decompression party (see 
http://www.burningman.com/blackrockcity_yearround/special_events/decompression/decom2007.html 
for the details.)  I promise to make you wanna shake it, probably keeping it 
funky and inspiring this time around, maybe with some breaks, house and electro 
in there (even though it's a pretty short set.)  I go on from 5:10p until 5:55p 
when The Evolution Control Committee (one of THE ORIGINAL mashup artists) takes 
over.

$10 donation in Black Rock Couture/Costume; $20 in streetwear.  All ages 
outdoors; kids under 12 absolutely free!  Outdoor sound ends at Mariposa Stage 
at 11pm; 10pm other outside areas.

Age 21+ inside Cocomo (club closes 1:30am.)

Looking forward to seeing you all there!!  Be sure to say Hi!  I'll be passing 
out some homemade gifts as well as Mix CDs too!  Be sure to introduce yourself 
if we haven't already met.

Be happy!!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Fumiya Tanaka ::Filter:: performance now available on Freqbox.net

Ben,

I've been talking to his agent Paulina about bringing him out here for
awhile.  We could have done it in December but our lineup for that one
is already over-stacked!

He actually did play here once already, i think opening for Matthew
Dear at Boca.  It sucked tho (weird setup, bad sound, off vibe)  and
you could tell he was NOT pleased.

I hear he's gonna be in N.America until around February.  Hopefully we
can make something happen in Jan of Feb.  I agree with you tho,
Milligan is one talented mofo. not sure how we'd do a 3rd turntable in
that small booth at the Endup tho.

yeah, might make for a nice UG.  we've just been doing so many extra

Subject: [sfraves] decent article on mp3 compression

if you want details on the inner-workings of the mp3 compression algorithm

hi,

this party is intended for adults.
it's 18+, mostly due to the sluts and their tendencies to shed clothing ;)
21+ to booze it up, and we'll be checking the ID of anyone who brings in their own alcoholic beverages at the door. 

i'll shoot you a message off-list with more details. thanks for asking...

love,
mo

Frickin Paul Hayden what the hell are you doing here?!?!?

I'm sure a small handful may remember you as your late 90's 
SFR persona, but don't worry I won't out you ;-)

Good to see you randomly on lovefest weekend :-)

Subject: [sfraves] Moderation follow-up (from mr. moderator)

Hey everyone,

Following up from my message last friday...

Since late tuesday I put back in a daily post limit, 12 posts. I 
looked back over the last few months and virtually everyone 
doesn't exceed that regularly. You all probably haven't even 
noticed it so I'm assuming this isn't a problem.

What this will do is keep people from treating this list as 
their instant messenger, which tends to cause some of the 
problems. Since we are in a bit of an antiquated form of 
communication...an email list, it's appropriate to use a little 
bit of restraint and thought in posting, which most of you 
already do.

I've always said I draw the line at personal attacks. Calling 
random people "cunts", is an example of crossing that line. But 
I suspect we've all moved on from that now.

Hopefully you all are cool with what I've done.

So onto parties:

Not a lot of posts about lovefest, what did you all do? I 
actually had fun at the mega-kiddie massive, although it was a 
spectacle of Barnum & Bailey proportions. The production 
environment was spot-on and professional though. Would be a 
little nice if it were that easy for all the UG parties. 
Although, I guess it's alot more fun & rewarding to 
scrap shit together like Macguyver. ;-)

We got some good events coming up, Evil Breaks on Oct 20th @ 
DNA, Ambient Mafia's 8 year anniversary on Nov 10th. And a bunch of 
parties Halloween weekend. I'll be at Andrew Phelan's Tonal 
party on Oct 27th. And a little bird told me Meat Meat Manifesto 
is playing another UG on the same night.

Not sure about NYE, anyone got any plans?

take care,

-terry

I'm hoping that yall could keep an eye out for me over the next days and 
weeks for some hot gear-- my home was broken into this last Tuesday and 
most of my audio equipment and dj studio was stolen.

If you see anyone selling a pair of Technics SL DZ-1200s (cjds), and or 
a Pioneer DJM800, please let me know.  I have the serial numbers and 
they have been reported to the police.  The mixer is less than a year 
old, pristine condition.  The CDJs are about 2 years old.  Please let me 
know if you see anyone selling these items in a used condition in the 
near future.

DJs-- take pictures of, and record your serial numbers!

my email is geoff_herbst@yahoo.com  if any of you come across any leads.

Thanks for listening!

peace

Geoff

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Voting, Texas Style

So, I thought that usually when you break rules you end up experiencing 
the consequences of doing so.  Apparently this is not the case for the 
folks in the Texas Legislature.  Apparently they feel that they are 
above petty little rules and things.  (But isn't that how politicians 
seem to have felt for a LONG time??  And do you suppose this sort of 
view might have SOMETHING to do with the utter lack of faith in 
the political system?)

You tell me.  Or, actually, why not let the video do the talking:
http://www.joketribe.com/externalVids/Voting.Texas.Legislature.Style.php

Apparently this is why most empires don't last much more than 200 years.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Moderation follow-up (from mr. moderator)

my Lovefest review:

this was the first year since 2004 that Evil Breaks hasn't been
involved with a float AND afterparty, so i signed up as a float
monitor for the parade.  it was fun and i was assigned three awesome
floats:  Bay Area Drum and Bass, Kontrol/Auralism and The
Bounce/Bayraves.

BADNB had an incredible FSound sound system and if you went by their
float at the Civic Center, you saw just how rocking their float was.
Kontrol was a lot of fun to walk with/dance with as it went down
Market street and I finally met Greg (see photo of me with tan penis
man).  the Bounce/Bayraves float had several friends playing/dancing
on it and it was good to see them out, as well.

once we hit the Civic Center i quickly went about destroying the
beverages in my backpack.  i spent most of the time around the Space
Cowboys Unimog, which i hadn't expected...but so many friends were
there i just couldn't resist.

around sundown, Tim, Eva and Anat went over to eat some pho...and
halfway through my meal i realized i was way drunker than i thought.
i texted some friends and bounced over to an apartment in Russian Hill
and promptly passed out on a futon.

fast foward to 11pm and i quickly pulled myself together and ran over
to Eklectic at the Cat Club.  that party was AWESOME!  so many old
friends and an incredible vibe.  hands in the air type dnb party.  i
really miss that shit.  stayed there until it closed and then walked
over to the Experiement at Fat City.

ran into the breaks homies and hung out for a bit inside and chatting
outside.  around 6am we bounced to a friends house and then...off to
the daytime renegade in Hunter's Point!

that was another incredibly fun time and by this time...i was in a
very "festive" mood and probably got bammed harder than i have in a
very, very long time.

by the end of the day, i had lost my cell phone, jacket, hat AND
tshirt and was stranded at my buddy's place in the lower haight.

7am monday morning i woke up and had to walk back to my car in SOMA
because i remembered that i'd parked in a yellow tow-away zone.

it was a seriously fun weekend and i'm glad i got to see so many
friendly faces!  crazy times for sure!

Bam @ the Hunter's Point renegade me and the rest of the Mob Of Shit Heads =

That party was actually (for me anyway) ten times better than anything Love=

 because it was just a damn fun outdoor event with a shit-ton of REALLY coo=

a while back.=20

+ I even got flirted with by a man whose stick is apparently red.=20

SEXY TIME!

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: my friend - Hawaiian Folk/Blues singer

so my friend Kevin Chang is coming to SF in early December and he's a
really awesome singer/songwriter/ukelele player.

no joke.  if you think hawaiian music and ukeleles equals cheesy
tourist bullshit, Kevin will make you think different.

his band, Kupa'aina plays contemporary hawaiian music, though Kevin's
solo stuff is really bluesy and soulful.

i'd like to try and hook him up with a gig or two while he's
here...but i know little to nothing about the live music scene in SF.
i'm just a silly DJ, you know.

just to clarify: yes we have a photo booth at the party, but it's not *that* kind of booth. any spreading of DNA should be done in the privacy of your own automobiles. thanks in advance!

[ K O N T R O L ]

minimal techno + avant-house
every 1st Saturday @ The Endup


featuring from Detroit via Berlin:

DANIEL BELL aka DBX

( Accellerate . Tresor . Logistic . Peacefrog . 7th City . Perlon )

Rightfully considered to be one of the pioneers of the minimal
techno genre, the legendary Daniel Bell returns to SF for an
unprecedented fourth appearance at [KONTROL].  Dan, whom
we jokingly refer to as our "unofficial 5th resident", is just so
damn good, we'd probably book him every month if he'd let us.


and from Chicago:

BILLY DALESSANDRO  :  LIVE

( SiteHolder . Harthouse . Force Inc . Resopal )

SiteHolder Records' Billy Dallessandro has devastated the
decks of SF a few times in the last year, but he's never played
here LIVE... until now. In support of his third long player "Into
The Atom" just released on Harthouse, this talented and prolific
artist is coming prepared to give us a serious live set lashing


and [KONTROL] residents:

SAMMY D  ( Classic . Utensil )
CRAIG KUNA   ( Concept SF . ESDJCO )
ALLAND BYALLO   ( Leibe*Detail . Nightlight Music )
NIKOLA BAYTALA   ( Robsoul . S.W.A.T. )

DANIEL BELL (aka DBX)

Born in Sacramento, California, Daniel Bell grew up outside of
Toronto, Canada, and then moved to Detroit where he collaborated with
Richie Hawtin as Cybersonik for three years on Plus 8 Records. In
1991, he started his own label, Accelerate, on which he released his
influential releases as DBX. Based on nearby Chicago "track" records,
he reduced that sound further into funky, streamlined grooves. The
formula proved to be successful and helped launch a new aesthetic in
techno and house music known as "minimal".

With the overwhelming success of his "Losing Control" single in 1994,
Daniel set up 7th City Distribution in order to assist smaller Midwest
labels to get distribution in overseas markets. He also created three
new labels - 7th City, Elevate and Harmonie Park. In 2000, he
relocated to Berlin, Germany, and released his first mix CD, "The
Button-Down Mind of Daniel Bell", on Tresor Records, followed in 2003
by "The Button-Down Mind Strikes Back!" He since has produced a series
of remixes for a diverse range of artists, includng John Tejada,
Pantytec, Akufen and John Thomas. He has spent the last 3 years
traveling and DJing around the world.

Dan is playing a grand total of five gigs in North America in 2007.
We are truly honored to be able to say two of them are for us. To be
honest, we'll pretty much book this guy anytime he's available...he's
just that good!  His last appearance in January (with Matthew
Dear/Audion live) was probably the craziest any of us had EVER seen
the Endup.  What's in store this time? I guess we'll have to find out.

BILLY DALESSANDRO (aka Huge Hephner)

Chicago native Billy Dalessandro first brought his unique production
style to the forefront of the electronic music community in 2002. The
five years since then have seen him release two full length albums,
nearly 20 original EPs, and a slew of remixes. His works have found
their way into the record bags of many respectable DJs, as well as
some of the most prestigious jocks' compilations.

Recently he established his own labels Siteholder and UnCut with
friends Brian Ffar and Daniel Mnookin which have already gained
massive feedback on each of the 7 releases. Standouts include "Don`t
Sleep" on SH001 and "That Trick She Knows" on SH002, both of which
were charted and played by many top DJs.  His latest release
"Blackjack" on Sonicutlure 006 is a jacking dancefloor bomb.

Billy will be in Europe from mid October to early December in support
of his just-released LP on Harthouse, after which he'll make stops in
select US cities. "Into the Atom", Dalessandro's third full length
album, takes listeners on a voyage into the bits and pieces of what
separates the average tracks from the very best.  Similar to the role
an atom plays in the molecular build up of all things on this planet,
the release exemplifies the minute twists and turns Dalessandro takes
with his music that help define him as among the true artists in the
production field.  It separates those who build the bandwagon from
those who wait until its completion to hop aboard.  Billy undeniably
belongs to the former of the two.

Subject: [sfraves] why i haven't switched to cds or a lap top

http://www.numark.com/idj2

i'd much rather bring this to a party rather than a laptop or be 
concerned if there are cd decks there at the venue if i was playing cds. 
i think once they standardize this technology and put it into ranes, 
vestaxes, pioneers or an allan & heath. then i'm out there in oakland 
knocking on the leo's pro-audio front door.

i really think its the plug and play aspect that makes this technology 
so exciting. a dj can bring their collection with them on their keychain 
or bring their nano with them with a set playlist and just start 
jamming. you could even make a set of wav files and put it on your i-pod 
video. it may be possible to time stretch a live performance right into 
the mix from a laptop via usb (?) or if some one had a request to for a 
dj to bring a certain track they could bring their thumb drive with them 
to the party. it would be nice to see some usb ports on the front of 
this and with more effects. also would love to see more pioneer style cd 
or DVD VJ control.. maybe even a midi interface?

ain't TECHNOlogy wonderful?

OK - So the internet was down for the past few days, and I'm not going =20
to torture everyone with dreadful gun quotes for the next week just to =20
make up for lost time.  But here they are after today's fabulous =20
quote, brought to you by Clorox Bleach.  Buon Appetit!

You're either really smart or really stupid.

Among the many misdeeds of the British rule in India, history will
look upon the Act depriving a whole nation of arms, as the blackest.

- Mahatma Ghandi


--

Thursday

The totalitarian states can do great things, but there is one thing
they cannot do: they cannot give the factory-worker a rifle and tell
him to take it home and keep it in his bedroom.  That rifle hanging on
the wall of the working-class flat or labourer's cottage, is the
symbol of democracy. It is our job to see that it stays there.

- George Orwell

Friday

Gun bans don't disarm criminals, gun bans attract them.

- Walter Mondale

Special Saturday QOD and end of the gun quotes

Gun control?  It's the best thing you can do for crooks and gangsters.
   I want you to have nothing.  If I'm a bad guy, I'm always gonna have
a gun.  Safety locks?  You will pull the trigger with a lock on, and
I'll pull the trigger.  We'll see who wins.

In 1992 Galen discovered the San Francisco house scene, and also
learned to dj the same year, which in turn triggered the creation of
The Pacific Sound System and the seminal Sunset Parties. Since 1994
San Francisco continues to be blessed with the legendary Sunset
Events...

Please help us welcome this local hero for his debut Evil Breaks appearance!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] why i haven't switched to cds or a lap top

Man it's been a loooong time since I posted here, this
thread has me wondering though... how common is it to
find CDJ 1000's or CDJ 800's at ug parties now? Is it
safe for a dj to show up to a party with a book of
cd's instead of a record bag these days? Obviousley
it's not an issue at the big clubs, and it seems even
most of the small bars/dj lounges etc have cought on
and have a pair of CDJ's now but I'm really wondering
about ug parties. Is it still mostly just a pair of
turntables or have the CDJ's become more common?

 I'm just wondering cuz to be honest I rarely make it
out to parties anymore but I went to a party this
weekend and was surprised because there was 2
turntables and 2 CDJ's set up and I literally didn't
see one record played... just CD's. I only stayed a
couple hours though, had to leave early cuz the
girlfriend was "tired" so maybe someone was playing
records after I left. 

 I'v been playing a mixture of records and cd's
probably about 75% vinyl 25% cd for the last 4 years
or so, and while it is VERY rare that I actually play
out anywhere I always have stuck to playing more vinyl
just because of the thought that if I actually DID get
booked to play at a party I'd probably be screwed if I
showed up with mostly cd's and little if any vinyl cuz
there wouldn't be any CDJ's. I always have and will
LOVE spinning vinyl... but It's  really began to hit
me latley that I've been playing more and more cd's
latley and maybee it's time to make the switch just
because I can carey tons more music on CD than vinyl,
plus the CDJ's eleviate all the problem associated
with vinyl such as warped records, scratched records
(cuz if its scratched you can burn a new copy),
bouncey floors making needles jump, needles feeding
back low end rummble from extreme sub bass etc. I'd
never go 100% cd... always have to have a little vinyl
on hand but its occureed to me that I'm probably
playing 75% cd's now and 25% vinyl. Most of the vinyl
I AM playing is just stuff that's brand new and isn't
available yet as a 320kbps MP3 yet. When it is
available I usually burn a cd and take the record out
of my bag to make space for other new stuff that I can
only get on vinyl.

So, in most situations would a dj be screwed if he
showed up to an ug with mostly cd's, or are CDJ's
pretty common now?

P.S. I haven't posted any mixes here in ages so if
anyone would like to check out some deep funky house
and tech house mixes here's a link to all my mixes new
and old. There not perfect, but who's live mixes are?

it's always best to ask the promoter who booked you what the setup
will be.  this is just a good practice to get into so you have an idea
of what kind of mixer there will be, if you have to bring your own
needles, what to expect, etc.

that being said, most parties i go to do have CDJs of some sort.

Yeah your right, always best to ask. I'm just kinda
wondering on a whole though how common it is to find
CDJ's at ug's now, cuz you NEVER used to see them a
couple years ago.

Depends on the UG you go to - some have 'em routinely, some act as if you k=

I like mixing between CDJ's, decks and Serato if I can help it...

Subject: RE: [sfraves] why i haven't switched to cds or a lap top

You've actually had promotors get angry or offended
for requesting CD decks? Thats rediculouse, its easy
enough to say "sorry, we don't have access to any".
Why get bitchy about it?

Man Serato's a whole nother deal. If CDJ's haven't
even totally cought on in the ug scene I would think
you would NEVER find Serato at a party.

I never got into Serato cuz what if you show up with
your own unit and can't plug it in? 

For example, I have a pretty decent mid size sound
system that I'm just about finished building and is
almost ready to debut(6 custom designed and custom
built horn loaded subs (soon to be 8) 6 JBL SR47
series 3 way tops, all Crown and QSC amps and DBX
processing, 3 1200's 2 CDJ's and your choice of 3
mixers). If a dj showed up in the middle of a show and
wanted to plug in a Serato unit both he and I would
have a big problem. I have three mixers available to
promotors depending what they want, a Rane MP/XP 2016a
rotary, a Urei 1620LE rotary (my favorite), and a Rane
MP 44. All three mixers have there inputs and
connection on the bottom NOT the back..... so the
whole mixer would need to be pulled out to plug Serato
in. Now if that same dj let me know BEFORE the show
then no problem, show up at sound check and we'll get
it patched in and sorted... or at least just let me
know before the show starts and I can run cables so
you can just plug in when you DO get there..... but
show up in the middle of the show with no notice that
you need to run Serato and it's all bad. 

So what do you do then if you can't get to the
connections of the mixer to plug your Serato in? THAT
is why I don't like Serato, cuzz the mixers I prefer
to spin on are not very Serato friendly at all.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] why i haven't switched to cds or a lap top


People are surprisingly becoming more Seratio friendly - although I do find=
 CDJ's more commonly available, as opposed to mixers that can accomodate Se=
rato - I am sure that will change soon enough.=20

And no - I haven't necessarily run into any promoters who refuse to have CD=
J's - they just don't always think of them in terms of being something DJ's=
 need. And of course, you get all sorts of folks in the peanut gallery tell=
ing you you're not a real DJ if you use them.=20

But that is also changing as digital format becomes more and more prevalent=
.

Subject: [sfraves] SRR: sound activating lights

is there some kind of power strip with a sound sensor that would turn
lights that are plugged into the power strip on and off depending on
the level of sound?

not like the clapper, but say if you plugged x-mas lights in and you
played music...the x-mas lights would flicker with the sound?

i'm sure something like this exists, just not sure how to search for it?

most of the issues mentioned below can be mitigated by simple communication. i use serato for probably 80%+ of my gigs now, and if you talk to the promoter beforehand as well as talk to the DJ playing right before you, it's really not that difficult to set up. in friendly situations, i can get all set up and ready in less than five minutes and with no audible break in the music. in more difficult situations, i can always play my backup records which i bring with me to every gig just to be safe. i think i've only gone to my backup records two or three times so far.

with all the different things people are using to play tunes these days - vinyl decks, cd decks, midi boards, live PA hardware, laptops, etc. - some plugging/unplugging of cables as the lineup progresses is becoming par for the course. a setup where the inputs on the mixer are inaccessible just isn't very practical, imo. and any DJ who acts like a dick because you need to mess with some cables (i've only encountered one) can either learn to adapt or most likely get left behind as the rest of us continue to experiment with new technology.

long live serato!

love,
mo

enough to say "sorry, we don't have access to any".
Why get bitchy about it?

Man Serato's a whole nother deal. If CDJ's haven't
even totally cought on in the ug scene I would think
you would NEVER find Serato at a party.

I never got into Serato cuz what if you show up with
your own unit and can't plug it in? 

For example, I have a pretty decent mid size sound
system that I'm just about finished building and is
almost ready to debut(6 custom designed and custom
built horn loaded subs (soon to be 8) 6 JBL SR47
series 3 way tops, all Crown and QSC amps and DBX
processing, 3 1200's 2 CDJ's and your choice of 3
mixers). If a dj showed up in the middle of a show and
wanted to plug in a Serato unit both he and I would
have a big problem. I have three mixers available to
promotors depending what they want, a Rane MP/XP 2016a
rotary, a Urei 1620LE rotary (my favorite), and a Rane
MP 44. All three mixers have there inputs and
connection on the bottom NOT the back..... so the
whole mixer would need to be pulled out to plug Serato
in. Now if that same dj let me know BEFORE the show
then no problem, show up at sound check and we'll get
it patched in and sorted... or at least just let me
know before the show starts and I can run cables so
you can just plug in when you DO get there..... but
show up in the middle of the show with no notice that
you need to run Serato and it's all bad. 

So what do you do then if you can't get to the
connections of the mixer to plug your Serato in? THAT
is why I don't like Serato, cuzz the mixers I prefer
to spin on are not very Serato friendly at all.

no, those are all lighting units that have a sensor built in.  i'm
talking about some device you can plug a standard lighting unit into
and make it sound reactive.

like the xmas light example.

If your in the Southbay you can go to Halted Computers on central Expressway and pick up an inexpensive sound trigger for about 10bucks.  You will have to solder about 10 components together.  Voila' You can now have this trigger control a standard 110v power relay.  Radio shack might have something like this too.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] why i haven't switched to cds or a lap top

We did a party once that involved two Djs using vinyl (one of them 3
turntables and a CD player), 1 using Serrato and two using laptop
mixing software.

The Serrato Dj was on first, then the two laptop Djs, then the two
turntable vinylist, then the 3 turntable + cd Dj.

Our solution was to have four turntables with two mixers laid out
ahead of time. The digital Djs used one mixer and the vinyl/cd Djs
used the other. We did this to avoid any cable clusterfucks, traffic
interference and general disturbance of artists while performing.

This may have been overkill, but this solution worked out beautifully,
but only because we used identical mixers (Xone:92s) and connected
both to the house mixer.

> most of the issues mentioned below can be mitigated by simple communication. i use serato for probably 80%+ of my gigs now, and if you talk to the promoter beforehand as well as talk to the DJ playing right before you, it's really not that difficult to set up. in friendly situations, i can get all set up and ready in less than five minutes and with no audible break in the music. in more difficult situations, i can always play my backup records which i bring with me to every gig just to be safe. i think i've only gone to my backup records two or three times so far.

Building this system has been a looong process. I did
a ton of research, and I have hand selected each and
every piece in this rig based on obtaining only the
best sound quality. I started the project almost two
years ago but at this point I have one amp (a QSC PLX
3602) and some more cables I need to buy and then its
100% ready to go. 

I would LIKE to find a nice rehearsal space to rent
for a weekend to fully test the rig out and dial it in
before I rent it out, but I'm not having much luck
finding anywhere in the south bay where I can do that.
All the individual components of the system have been
extensivley tested (at low volumes) and everything is
functioning 100% as it should with no problems, I just
haven't been able to fire the whole system up together
yet. 
 
Without rushing it I'd say by December it should be
ready. However if a reasonable offer came up now for a
rental gig, and I had at least a months notice before
the event (time needed to pick up that last amp, the
rest of the cables and a few other odds and ends), and
providing I was able to spend a good 3 hours or so
post setup and pre-show on sound check dialing the rig
in I could accept a booking now.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] SRR: sound activating lights

Halted is teh shit! Love that place :-) That's where I get all 
my cabling and random adaptors. Sometimes I stroll in and peruse 
their random laser parts. They have usable test benches for 
checking out random components.

One day I bought a stack of used security VCRS for $9 a pop 
(back when I was analog)

hrm, I think I'll pass by on my lunch :-)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] SRR: sound activating lights

My Dad in the late 1970s designed a prototype pair of glasses for deaf 
people that incorporated his red and green LEDs into them that would 
flash on and off whenever they were spoken t,o or there was some other 
sound in the environment, like an oncoming car, that they should be 
aware of.

Like the electronic jewelry he designed and tried to sell at around the 
same time as those glasses, it was about 20 years too soon to attract 
any VC money so it never went anywhere.

For what you're looking to do, RadioShack isn't a bad place to start.

DIRTY
October 20th, 2007
DNA Lounge - 375 11th St.
$10 presales @ groovetickets.com
$10 b4 11pm / $15 after
10pm - 4am
21+

It's been a few months since Evil Breaks has done a bigger party, and
we figured we'd come back with something HUGE!!! We can't wait to see
what these guys sound like on DNA's amazing sound system, and along
with the amazing local support, Visuals by Viberation, and a special
surprise guest upstairs, I really don't think you're going to want to
miss this.


E.B.'s Dirty little room w/visuals by Viberation:

Lawgiverz (Trigger/Botchit) - UK

Lawgiverz, a.k.a. R-Kidz and Noize, have been dropping audio bombs for
the last five years on Botchit & Scarper, Trigger Recordings and more.
Lawgiverz have produced, programmed and remixed with a bizarre
selection of artists such as Jeff Beck, Dave Stewart and The Human
League. They would like you to know that none of this really matters.
Just that if you find yourself in front of the Trigger sound system or
at DNA during their laptop and turntable set, prepare to be destroyed
with a helping of alien love in the Electrobreaks style.


Fine Cut Bodies (Chi Recordings/Record Records) - Budapest

Even though the name Fine Cut Bodies implies more than one person,
behind the FCB letters is only one man, Kevin aka Attila Fodor. His
musical tastes are extremely broad which is reflected in the musical
preferences of *Chi Recordings*, the label he co-founded in 2000. One
of the most important taste-maker DJs in Hungary, he has been one of
the key DJs/promoters that built up the huge breaks scene in Hungary
and he is now starting to build up the world class underground minimal
and tech-house scene in Budapest.

As a DJ, Kevin's taste is determined more by his musical attitude than
by any specific genre: he looks for music that's experimental but not
selfish, interesting but not unlistenable. As a producer, he has
released tracks in many genres and is always looking for new sonic
adventures. Kevin's tracks have been licensed for numerous
compilations and he has collaborated with and remixed for some of the
hottest names in electronic music.

Aaron Jae (E.B./XM Radio/Space Cowboys)
Bam (Evil Breaks/ABN)
M.O.D. (Evil Breaks)
Raydeus (Pronoia)


Beat Church hosting the upstairs room:

Lawgiverz (A 2nd Mid-tempo set)

Kitty-D (The Glitch Mob/Beat Church)
Hookerz & Blow (Mozaic vs EPROM)
Benchun(False Profit)

thank you so much! i'm really glad you had a good time :)

as for me, it's a long story and it's not a flattering one. my representatives had to hold things down for me, and they did a wonderful job. thankfully not everyone is as much of a dumbass as i am!

love,

In iTunes, change the default file format to mp3, then right click on the 
track you want to convert, and select "convert to mp3".

Converting between lossy formats is always going to degrade the sound 
quality, there's no way around it.

Yea, I figured there'd still be loss - but I am just trying to minimize it =
if possible. The m4a is supposedly equal to 320 MP3

Yeah, DON'T DO IT!!! :)

Try to get the high quality versions that haven't gone through a lossy 
compression already.

 i think if you're saying why be a dick when it comes to cabling i think if you look at this mixer it can do cds laptops vinyl, wav and mp3s from a hard drive or an ipod... but why carry around a laptop when you can carry a thumbdrive? i just think serrato is a little too ahead of its time and tried to do something that bridged the gap between digital and analog for analog djs a couple of years ago. i myself am still an analog dj and i love it. but i am now buying new tracks for a couple of dollars and giving the artist props for what they do, with my money.. i.e. supporting their work. but i see a new frontier for djing, in this, what seems like a missing link for all these splintered offshoots of djing. which in my view is just killing djing

this mixer is a standardised platform for djing as a universal concept instead of fragmenting djs into just vinyl or just serrato or just cd-jing. now you have an efficient mixer that takes on the past and the future and makes it efficient. and it adds a thing most of us already own and does not cost 3,000 dollars as does a laptop (which we don't all own). possibly it will be a standard feature on all mixers to have a hard drive built in? plug and play is great thing i think that's what makes this mixer great. like djing in the past you just won't have to worry about what's there at the gig or 'call the promoter up' cause its already there for you. its less of a headache on the dj, the promoter, and the audience who has to watch you fumble with a flashlight while you bust out your serrato for five minutes. but i'd wait on this product until it has been tested out and once the successor takes its place , then finally gets all the kinks out. that's when i would say you should go out and get one.. at least that's what i'd do, especially if the big companies start making hard drive mixers.

like wouldn't it be great to call up your song from a small 400 gig usb hard drive that is smaller than your actual thumb, have it looped and sampled already and you can do sample hits on the fly, have your re-edit effected and quantized to the beat live.. all the while playing some cool assed MP4 video made by your vj friend? when's that mixer coming out? that's like a plug and play ableton live with video and without any excess baggage. think of the awesomeness.. maybe that's pioneer's version. `;)

use serato for probably 80%+ of my gigs now, and if you talk to the promoter

that difficult to set up. in friendly situations, i can get all set up and ready 
in less than five minutes and with no audible break in the music. in more 
difficult situations, i can always play my backup records which i bring with me 
to every gig just to be safe. i think i've only gone to my backup records two or 
three times so far.

plugging/unplugging of cables as the lineup progresses is becoming par for the

practical, imo. and any DJ who acts like a dick because you need to mess with 
some cables (i've only encountered one) can either learn to adapt or most likely 
get left behind as the rest of us continue to experiment with new technology.

If you really want to maximize quality, just burn it to CDR as a standard 
audio track (WAV).... then your friend can rip and re-encode however he 
wants.

Subject: [sfraves] BSP - Ambient Mafia 8-year - 11/10/07

A lot has changed in the Bay Area in the last eight years, but
one thing has remained constant.

The economy? Hell, no, where were you in 2002?!

The rave scene? Huh? Raves? Wotsat?

No, were talking about the Ambient Mafia!

Thats right, on Nov. 10 the Bay Areas premiere chill crew is
celebrating our eighth year of giving San Francisco (and
beyond) the finest in downtempo and electronic beats...as well
as founder Redstickmans birthday! Come out and help us
commemorate these major milestones the only way we know how 
with a big ass party of biblical proportions! (We are not
responsible for those turned to salt in the aftermath.)

Well be rockin a top-notch brand new underground location in
San Francisco, and all your favorite Mafia DJs will be on hand
in two rooms of mind-bending mayhem and merriment. With visuals
by Viberation and Junktronix and audio by Sound of Mind and
:am, the Ambient Mafia 8-Year Anniversary party will make you
think its 1999 all over again! 

Actually, is that such a good thing? No, this will be a party
that reminds you that this is 2007 and after eight years, the
song remains the same... nobody does it like the Ambient Mafia!

Stay tuned for more demented details and lineup, and as always,
thanks for your continued support. We couldnt do it without
you! Okay, we could, but it would kinda suck.

Gratuitous sex would be dandy - scratch the underage out from either sex, g=

And Chris, remind me to cockslap you next time I see ya, lol.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] fact or fiction?

this is in reference to Anon Salon.

i would say "no" to a general increased monitoring because i know of
one UG spot that has done 3 events in the last 5 weeks and each
attracted several hundreds of people and the music could be heard
outside for atleast a block away.

also, last weekend there was a party near Cesar Chavez that went late
night and had upwards of 20 people smoking and talking outside the
front doors.  i was outside when a cop car rolled by and though one
cop did peer out to look...they just kept driving.

i haven't heard of any events being broken up recently.  has anyone else?

I'd say it's really, really good that you don't mind if it's smaller than LoveFest. :)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] beetle juice

the lineup is as good as any small/medium sized norcal raves.

the issue will be how they utilize the venue and how many people come
out on a Wednesday night.  also, Sac parties are, well....Sac parties.

although the bowling and laser tag sounds fun.

anybody remember raving in bowling alleys?  fun.

Yeah I missed the meeting. But Moksha Tribe is very tight, and 
an amazing group of folks, so a long low simmer resulting in a 
boiling-inspirational party to rock-our-socks would be well 
appreciated :-)

looking forward to it :-)

Beetle Juice is being thrown by Lite-Brite, a long-time 
lighting/sound crew from Sac, worked with them on Space Girls 2. 
They're not so much a party crew as a technical production 
crew, but technical can go a long way I suppose.

So I have no doubt the production levels will be very good 
(since all his sound and lighting is essentially free). The 
promotions and lineup promise a younger 18-25 crowd. A bowling 
alley for the venue is...well, a bowling alley for what it's 
worth.

The bigger question is, Trista...what are you looking for in a 
party? While many of us on this list are *well* over 18, 21+, we 
have some good experience to point you towards what's crackin' 
:-)

If you're daring and down for SFR's style of parties there are a 
bunch of other rockin' Halloween parties people are talking 
about.

Welcome to SFR :-)

Subject: RE: [sfraves] beetle juice

Hi Trista.

Lite Brite has been doing sound/visual support for some of the largest
parties around for years now (the Lovefest aferparty included), so on an
environment level, I anticipate nothing less than stellar.  As a party =
crew,
like most old timers, they were more active in throwing their own events
years & years ago... But they've only gotten bigger & better over time, =
so
I'm looking forward to seeing what they have in store for this Halloween
bash.

As for the venue, the party isn't going on in just the bowling alley
portion... But through the entire building... Which with it's separate =
rooms
and multiple levels, makes for a great place to throw an event.  Being =
one
of those venues that brings back memories of years past, I expect to see =
a
much more diverse crowd agewise with "old skoolers" and "nu skoolers" in =
a
good mix.  Sure, any "rave" inspired event these days attracts a =
"younger
crowd" but I don't expect the attendees to be any younger of average =
than
most other events of this nature in the Bay.  (in fact, I've come to see =
the
average Bay crowd as being even younger at these types of parties these =
days
with all the happy hardcore that still goes on down there - yowza!) As =
for
the lineup at this event, it's pretty diverse as well with techno, =
electro,
breaks, house, dnb, downtempo+++ and yeah even some trance in there from =
the
looks of it...=20

I especially like the idea that costumes are required and that dressing =
as a
candy kid doesn=92t count.  Ha ha.  Forcing creativity is GRATE!=20

Depending on what you're looking for in a party,this might or might not =
be
the one for you.  Being one of the busiest (and oldest) DJs around and =
while
still living in Sacramento, I can give you some honest input from =
someone
who's experienced much of what the Sac scene does (or doesn't) have to =
offer
to your particular tastes. So feel free to hit me up privately if you
want...=20

im also v. curious about this. its a common raver myth that 'cops are
cracking down this summer' when often it's just sloppy promotion and not
keeping people off the streets. Or some dumbass from antioch (heh heh)
bumping happy hardcore in the middle of the block in his lowered neon-kitted
saturn.

Where's our contact in the police force? Lurking law enforcement personnel:
can you give us the low-down on how scared we should be? ;)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] fact or fiction?

Cops are territorial, and different cities have different 
instructions/procedures.

In general they don't come around unless you have a complaint, 
so sound-proofing and curbing loitering is the number one ally.

I also suspect most departments are more concerned with violent 
crime, which they have plenty to to deal with.

If shit's under control, and the party doesn't look like a 
complete circus, and there aren't problems outside the venue, a 
reasonable party representative should be able to get the cops 
on their way.

However, might be interesting to know more of the "insides". For 
a while one of my clients was the Salinas Police Dept., so I got 
to see their interaction to crime with candor. But there 
weren't many "raves" in Salinas at that time.

9 out of 10 of my personal dealings w/ the PO were cordial, and 
we took care of the problem or shut it down. The renegade 
locations though, were shut-down for sure, with the exception 
of some beach parties.

Anyone else got some experience/knowledge with this??

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Upcoming events?

Cool, thanks! Although, I'd love to check out other events too. Breaks and 
techno are up in my alley as well. I don't buy into that whole elitist, 
genre culture. Not to mention, psytrance parties are often, you know, 
difficult to get to because they're frequently in the middle of no where. 
It'd be great if I could get somewhere by taking the BART, then maybe a bus 
and I can even handle that primitive walking thing that I sometimes hear 
about. I wince at the pain that my car has taken whenever I think of those 4 
hours drives out into the middle of the desert for a Moontribe gathering...

Tips on dealing with "authorities" - all based on personal experience.

1)  If you are doing an event, and you are not sure how entirely 
'legal' such an event might be -
have at least one partner - and have a designated role for each 
partner for the evening - one partner
should be the 'spokesperson' for the event and be ready to say things 
like "yes, officer, this is my event -
what can i do to help you ?" . . . the other partner, should stay out 
of it - entirely - that way, if a trip
to the station is the end result, one of you is free, has access to 
phones and bail money, etc.

2)  Do not try to bullshit the officer, do not try to make the 
officer your "buddy" or new best friend,
do not LIE to the officer, carry valid and current ID and let the 
officer see it as soon as he asks to
see it - though one time, I had left my ID in the car, because, as I 
explained, I had not wanted to
risk losing it on the beach at night where we were doing our 
questionably legal event - the officer
in that case was willing to accompany me to my car to inspect my ID - 
this served the additional
purpose of getting the officer away from the party.

Additional tip - being able to honestly look the officer in the eye 
helps a lot.  Taking responsibility
for what is going on helps a lot.

3)  Do your own "policing" as the event goes on - it really isn't as 
much fun, but somebody has to
stay completely sober (one or two of the people RESPONSIBLE for 
putting on the event) for the
duration of the event - this allows the sober person to be ready to 
deal with any authorities and/or
any real emergency situations. - By doing your own "policing"  I 
mean, walking around and being
aware of any situations that might be threatening to get out of 
control - like the arrival of a posse
that is already beyond socially acceptable drunk, or the arrival of 
people intent on setting off a lot
of fireworks - believe it or not, fireworks draw the attention of 
authorities - even more than a thumping
bass.  Once you become aware of a potential problem, recruit your 
friends and the people you know
to 'keep an eye' on the potential problem situation - surprisingly 
often, one of your friends might
know someone in the "drunk posse" and the friend just saying hi, will 
chill the whole situation down.

4)  I know it is a "downer" but do not be afraid to turn the music 
down or off if you have good
reason to - ie authorities seem to be cruising the area, or a drunken 
posse is getting out of hand -
the people who you want at your event understand - they do not want 
to be sent out into the street
or on the way home earlier than expected - 20 minutes of quiet, or 
the focus of the entire crowd
on a threatening posse and really chill things out - allowing you to 
get back on track for the rest
of the evening.

5)  Be careful not to admit to any more than you have to - remember, 
don't lie - but you don't have
to volunteer a lot, either.  I was once asked if what was going on 
was "a rave" - I answered it was a gathering
of friends who liked to get together and dance all night once and a 
while.  Rave was the buzzword
that generated the 'must shut down now' button - the officer smiled 
at my answer and said -
OK - this is my beach - I like to keep it clean - I'm going to let 
you and your friends dance until sunrise -
but you MUST be gone by 7 - and this beach MUST be spotless - I then 
showed the officer all of
the garbage bags we had to accomplish that purpose - he still took 
all of the information from my ID
and warned that when he came back at 7 IF there were still anyone 
there, I would be arrested, and
if there were any garbage left on the beach, I would be arrested - He 
gave me his card - and left.

I called him on the following Monday - to thank him for how "we" had 
handled the situation
and he praised us for how clean we had left the beach - and then, he 
said - if you and your friends
ever want to come down and dance on my beach,again - let me know 
beforehand- so I'll know its you and you
won't have any problems.

6)  Sometimes the officers will make a couple of small requests to 
test the situation - such as,
could you turn the bass down a bit - I think that is why we got a 
complaint from the neighbors -
by complying immediately you give the officer a sense that the 
situation IS under your control and that
he is dealing with a reasonable human being.

7)  Getting argumentative never works - getting indignant never works 
- personally knowing some of
the officer's fellow officers and being able to name drop - that 
works - but be sure of your relationship
with the officer who's name you are dropping.

8)  Getting the name of the officers, and their cards if possible is 
hugely helpful - especially if
you have already dealt with one officer situation that evening - it 
is not uncommon for DIFFERENT
officers to drop by - the sheriff, the local police, the state 
police, the park police ALL might have
some jurisdiction over your location - it is helpful to be able to 
say Officer so and so of the sheriff's
dept was already here this evening, here is his card - this is what 
we discussed . . . .

9)  Finally, if the word is NO - yield and get you, your stuff and 
all of the people out of there
as quickly and quietly as possible - IF you have a back-up location, 
that helps a lot - but do NOT
distribute ANYTHING with that information written down - telling 
people to head in whatever direction
signaling "everyone's going home now" and pay special attention to 
driving carefully !!!
Use your info line for the back-up location info (if you can trust 
it) or word of mouth, only.

I hope this helps . . . . .

That's a lot of excellent advice, one thing not mentioned though: If you're
lucky enough to know a lawyer who would be kind enough to attend the event
and stay sober for it, take that opportunity.

There is nothing that will take the wind out of a cop's sails than hearing,
"Hello officer, I am attorney so and so, what's the problem here?"

I've seen that one little sentence take what would have surely been a busted
party and a ruined night for all and turn it into a *very* apologetic police
officer and a banging party that got to go until it was finished.

I am not advocating that - but you have every right to "remain slient". The=
re's a whole reason that they have the "anything you say cand and will be u=
sed against you" in the Miranda - that's cuz that's how they convict people=

9 times out of 10, unless you are caught red-handed doing something (and ev=
en still, maintaining your silence can still help) you get yourself locked =
up by talking too much. You offer up only your identity, and basic informat=
ion - nothing else.=20

This is advice from my lawyer, who was an ex cop...

Subject: [sfraves] bsp: Saturday! [KONTROL] vs. Surefire w/ Germany's amazing D.DIGGLER!

So, let me tell you a quick little story.

Back around 2001, I was chatting with a bona fide music freak online
and asking him what were some of his favorite sets ever.  He hooked me
up with this 4 hour set by a German guy named, amusingly enough, Dirk
Diggler .  It started off with some of the deepest, most sparse dub
techno imaginable, then gradually gained steam, expertly covering
every style and tempo of minimal/techno until the last couple hours
were just straight up slamming dancefloor killers.  In the years since
then, I'd have to say this set has become like an old friend to me,
and the DJ responsible for it has become one of my all-time favorites,
sparking an ongoing interest in the minimal techno genre which
eventually led to the founding of the [KONTROL] parties.

After religiously following (and loving) his sets and productions in
the 6 years since then, this year at the Detroit Electronic Music
Festival I finally got to see him play in person, where he dropped an
amazing 2 hour live/dj set on the main stage.  If you talk to any
techno fan that was there, you'll find a bunch of people ready to
assert that his set was one of the highlights of the entire festival,
hands down. And this year's fest had some sizzling sets indeed, by the
likes of Richie Hawtin, Luciano, Marco Carola, Steve Bug, Jeff Mills,
and many more. This guy is good. Really good.

So, when [KONTROL] was approached by SUREFIRE (SF's illest dubstep
crew) about wanting to collaborate on a show at the beautiful new
Temple nightclub, we thought about who we'd really like to hear on
that ridiculous thumping sound system, and the choice was clear...
Diggler!  We shot his agent an email, crunched the numbers, and
decided to make it happen!  Hot on the release of his brand new studio
album EM.Pulse, he's flying over all the way from Frankfurt just for
this one gig, and we're certain it's going to be one not soon
forgotten!

And for you dubstep fans out there, Surefire is bringing out no less
than 3 huge headliners representing some of the hottest names in the
genre.  Even if you're unfamiliar with this rapidly growing style of
music, there's no better place to indulge your curiosity than at this
show.  We have a strong feeling there are going to be plenty of
dubstep fans leaving with a new appreciation for minimal, and likewise
techno heads feelin' the dubstep vibe!

We hope you can join us for this fantastic night of music for the
mind, body, and spirit.  We promise you won't be disappointed.


-----> Greg and the [KONTROL] crew

>From this week's SF Bay Guardian:

Give props to these two DJ-promotion groups, which have teamed up to
organize a unique event: a face-off between dubstep and techno DJs. In
a sense, this could be like one of those family reunions at which
estranged half brothers first meet. Dubstep would be the loud
youngster, a hip descendant of dub, garage, and drum 'n' bass (it's
complicated). Techno would be the elder and moodier teenager, the one
who's been around the block but doesn't flaunt it. With German techno
talent D.Diggler and Brit dubstep mixers Benga and Hatcha, there'll be
small moments of transitional awkwardness overshadowed by an impulse
to enjoy the camaraderie and dance to deep beats.

Thanks Jim for the knowledge bomb :-)

A related anecdote...

At a Cloudfactory at the "pit" in Monterey 2004, we cleaned up 
the spot, A LOT. Brought up about 14 trash bags and some shopping 
carts and a toilet. Left them at the trailhead for pickup.

We did this BEFORE starting to setup sound or anything.
Authorities came for an unrelated incident, but they were 
appreciative of our efforts. Didn't even question the party 
while in full view at all.

Beach clean-up raves are GRATE!

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Ann Coulter now hates Jews....

Not that anyone needs ANOTHER reason to hate Ann
Coulter, but just in case you do, read the transcript
from her interview with Donny Deutsch today...

Seriously, what percentage of people agree with the
things she says, writes, and does? I know no one, do
you?

E



DEUTSCH: Let me ask you a question. Were going to get
off strengths and weakness for a second. If you had
your way, and all of your  forget that any of them 

COULTER: I like this.

DEUTSCH:  are calculated marketing teases, and your
dreams, which are genuine, came true having to do with
immigration, having to do with womens  with abortion
 what would this country look like?

COULTER: UMMMMM (pause)  It would look like New York
City during the Republican National Convention. In
fact, thats what I think heaven is going to look
like.

DEUTSCH: And what did that look like?

COULTER: Happy, joyful Republicans in the greatest
city in the world.

DEUTSCH: No, no, no, no, but Im talking about this
country. You dont want to make this country  its
not about Republicans. Im saying, what would the
fabric of this country look like? Forget that the
Republicans would be running the show.

COULTER: Well, everyone would root for America, the
Democratic Party would look like Joe Lieberman, the
Republican Party would look like Duncan Hunter 

DEUTSCH: No, no, no, I dont want  Im not talking
about politically the landscape. What would our 
would we be safer? Would people be happier? Would they
be more 

COULTER: We would be a lot safer.

DEUTSCH: Would there be more tolerance? Would there be
 would women be happier, would the races get along
better? The Ann Coulter subscription  prescription.
What  tell me what would be different in our fabric
of country, because 

COULTER: Well, all of those things.

DEUTSCH: I can give  I can give you an argument there
would be more divisiveness, that there would be more
hate 

COULTER: Oh, no.

DEUTSCH: That there would be a bigger difference
between the rich and the poor, a lot of other  tell
me what  why this would be a better world? Lets give
you  Im going to give you  say this is your show.

COULTER: Well, OK, take the Republican National
Convention. People were happy. Theyre Christian.
Theyre tolerant. They defend America, they 

DEUTSCH: Christian  so we should be Christian? It
would be better if we were all Christian?

COULTER: Yes.

DEUTSCH: We should all be Christian?

COULTER: Yes. Would you like to come to church with
me, Donny?

DEUTSCH: So I should not be a Jew, I should be a
Christian, and this would be a better place?

COULTER: Well, you could be a practicing Jew, but
youre not.

DEUTSCH: I actually am. Thats not true. I really am.
But  so we would be better if we were  if people 
if there were no Jews, no Buddhists 

COULTER: Whenever Im harangued by 

DEUTSCH:  in this country? You cant believe that.

COULTER:  you know, liberals on diversity 

DEUTSCH: Here you go again.

COULTER: No, its true. I give all of these speeches
at megachurches across America, and the one thing
thats really striking about it is how utterly,
completely diverse they are, and completely
unself-consciously. You walk past a mixed-race couple
in New York, and its like they have a chip on their
shoulder. Theyre just waiting for somebody to say
something, as if anybody would. And 

DEUTSCH: I dont agree with that. I dont agree with
that at all. Maybe you have the chip looking at them.
I see a lot of interracial couples, and I dont see
any more or less chips there either way. Thats
erroneous.

COULTER: No. In fact, there was an entire Seinfeld
episode about Elaine and her boyfriend dating because
they wanted to be a mixed-race couple, so youre
lying.

DEUTSCH: Oh, because of some Seinfeld episode? OK.

COULTER: But yeah, I think thats reflective of whats
going on in the culture, but it is completely striking
that at these huge megachurches  the idea that, you
know, the more Christian you are, the less tolerant
you would be is preposterous.

DEUTSCH: That isnt what I said, but you said I should
not  we should just throw Judaism away and we should
all be Christians, then, or 

COULTER: Yeah.

DEUTSCH: Really?

COULTER: Well, its a lot easier. Its kind of a fast
track.

DEUTSCH: Really?

COULTER: Yeah. You have to obey.

DEUTSCH: You cant possibly believe that.

COULTER: Yes.

DEUTSCH: You cant possibly  youre too educated, you
cant  youre like my friend in 

COULTER: Do you know what Christianity is? We believe
your religion, but you have to obey.

DEUTSCH: No, no, no, but I mean 

COULTER: We have the fast-track program.

DEUTSCH: Why dont I put you with the head of Iran? I
mean, come on. You cant believe that.

COULTER: The head of Iran is not a Christian.

DEUTSCH: No, but in fact, Lets wipe Israel 

COULTER: I dont know if youve been paying attention.

DEUTSCH: Lets wipe Israel off the earth. I mean,
what, no Jews?

COULTER: No, we think  we just want Jews to be
perfected, as they say.

DEUTSCH: Wow, you didnt really say that, did you?

COULTER: Yes. That is what Christianity is. We believe
the Old Testament, but ours is more like Federal
Express. You have to obey laws. We know were all
sinners 

DEUTSCH: In my old days, I would have argued  when
you say something absurd like that, theres no 

COULTER: Whats absurd?

DEUTSCH: Jews are going to be perfected. Im going to
go off and try to perfect myself 

COULTER: Well, thats what the New Testament says.

DEUTSCH: Ann Coulter, author of If Democrats Had Any
Brains, Theyd Be Republicans, and if Ann Coulter had
any brains, she would not say Jews need to be
perfected. Im offended by that personally. And well
have more Big Idea when we come back.

(BREAK)

DEUTSCH: Welcome back to The Big Idea. During the
break, Ann said she wanted to explain her last
comment. So Im going to give her a chance. So you
dont think that was offensive?

COULTER: No. Im sorry. It is not intended to be. I
dont think you should take it that way, but that is
what Christians consider themselves: perfected Jews.
We believe the Old Testament. As you know from the Old
Testament, God was constantly getting fed up with
humans for not being able to, you know, live up to all
the laws. What Christians believe  this is just a
statement of what the New Testament is  is that
thats why Christ came and died for our sins.
Christians believe the Old Testament. You dont
believe our testament.

DEUTSCH: You said  your exact words were, Jews need
to be perfected. Those are the words out of your
mouth.

COULTER: No, Im saying thats what a Christian is.

DEUTSCH: But thats what you said  dont you see how
hateful, how anti-Semitic 

COULTER: No!

DEUTSCH: How do you not see? Youre an educated woman.
How do you not see that?

COULTER: That isnt hateful at all.

DEUTSCH: But thats even a scarier thought. OK 

COULTER: No, no, no, no, no. I dont want you being
offended by this. This is what Christians consider
themselves, because our testament is the continuation
of your testament. You know that. So we think Jews go
to heaven. I mean (Jerry) Falwell himself said that,
but you have to follow laws. Ours is Christ died for
our sins. We consider ourselves perfected Christians.
For me to say that for you to become a Christian is to
become a perfected Christian is not offensive at all.

DEUTSCH: We will let the audience decide then, wont
we? Ann Coulter. New book. More Big Idea straight ahead.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] bsp: Saturday! [KONTROL] vs. Surefire w/ Germany's amazing D.DIGGLER!

Any German techno producer who goes by the moniker Dirk Diggler is
obviously one cheeky monkey - but his material has consistantly been
some of the true-est shit out there.

Should be a fun night with all the heads and dubstep crews giving
Temple the right vibe.

Although I am Jewish, I actually agree with you...
mostly because I understand your point... that
Organized Religion in its worst form is fanatical
regardless of beliefs. That said, I should also voice
my disdain for religion in general, believing whole
heartedly that membrane theory (the convenient coming
together of string theories) will one day prove that
"Horton Hears a Who" was not a childrens picture book,
but actually a true vision of universal theory...

Blah blah blah... at the end of the day, I am a Jew,
not for the religion, but for the cultural connection
to the past, to the community at large, and to the
circumstances my family has endured over the last
centuries directly, and last millenia indirectly as I
see it.

building... and the electric mini-F1 I am designing in
Autodesk Inventor....

This man who wrote this book visited Guernsey, an island off the coast
of France in the English Channel.  Guernsey does not submit to the
privately owned central bank scheme, rather prints their own debt free
pounds.

Oh and have a nice weekend

There were about 60,000 permanent residents; the average family owned
3.3 cars; their unemployment rate was zero and their standard of
living was very high. Also, there was no public debt and a surplus of
public funds was earning them interest. The Guernsey Treasury
increased the money supply by 50% over a 3 year period and this
increase did not cause any inflation. The price for a gallon of gas in
the UK was about $5, but the price in Guernsey was about $2. Contrary
to the teachings of economics in all higher institutions, inflation,
it was claimed, was not related to the volume of money, but rather to
the size of the commercial debt.

Link still broken.  I dunno.

I didn't really see what their industry was, but my guess is since =20
they're a small island is they have some agriculture and tourism and =20
they might have a little bit of industry.  They're really close to =20
France and the English Channel is a busy thoroughfare so getting =20
supplies to the island shouldn't be too bad.  Like Mallorca has a =20
little industry with their fake pearls but it's mostly tourism and =20
farming.

You can check out the Wikipedia page for Guernsey if you're curious, I =20
read it before.  My dream vacation in the next 5 years is fly to =20
London, rent a car drive through the Chunnel to Paris, maybe stop in =20
Guernsey to check it out, drive through the Basque Country down to =20
Barcelona and take the ferry over to Palma.  I guess stop in Ibiza.

Anyone want to go?

I don't think you meant to use a double negative..

"I don't doubt that she's not smart"

is the same as

"I'm doubt she's smart"

I do doubt she's smart, but that's doesn't jive with the rest of your sentence.

Yes.... a few hefe weizen's will do that to you... along with just taking a
midterm and class presentation tonite  : P

But yes, I don't think the bitch (which she definitely is) is dumb, but
definitely somewhat of an ignoramus when she tries to present her argument
as back up by facts (which it rarely is, unless their twisted and
distorted).

Sure, Sunnyvale has an integrated FD/PD and they switch which they're assigned
to every couple of weeks. :)  (the PD cars have fire gear in the trunk, too)

Seriously, most cops aren't really assholes, but consider if your job was to
cruise around knowing that a large number of people hate you.  They're real
people, most of them start off thinking about how they want to give back to
society, etc... It doesn't take that long for most of them to just want to
survive the day without getting shot in the back.  This is not good for a
positive outlook on life.  A little empathy does go a long way.

As to how to deal with them, friendly politeness and respect do NOT exclude
knowing what not to say.

It's about presence of mind, not fast talking or having a script.

Sure, walk up and ask "Hello officer, how can I help?" or "Can I be of
assistance?"  It's as much a negotiation tactic as anything else.  If you
want to clam up and just call your attorney, go for it.  If not, be smart,
think about what leverage you do or don't have, and what he has.

If he asks "is this your rave?"  you can reply "These are my friends, we're
just here to relax and have a nice time."  Heck, you can even nod.  Just don't
admit to things on his terms.  Redefine in happy, helpful terms.  In short,
suck up without confessing anything.  

If he comments that it's a lot of friends/people, it's easy enough to say
"well, my friends told their friends, and they all know I have an open door
policy for my friends."  Do NOT mention things getting out of hand.

if he says to turn it down, you can say "Sure, I'll go talk to the DJ after
you and I are done talking."

None of which admits to anything, yet all of it keeps you human in his
eyes and brings you partway towards him, making him much more likely to
want to help you.

Attitude IS everything, since yes, he can fuck with you just to make an
example of you if he chooses to.  As long as you don't actually admit to
any wrondoing, you haven't lost anything for trying, and you might actually
get to keep the party going, instead of just "winning" the avoidance of
jail time.

And if you've got an attorney, keep the number on speed dial regardless. :)

Yes... some cops are nice... but I know first hand people first hand who I
grew up with/went to college with who definitely fit into the Oakland
Riders/Rampart Category.  And I get the feeling, there's a lot more of these
crooked cops than we'd really like to admit.  The ridiculous thing is, in
most cities, the system is set up to protect cops and even keep bad cops on
the force.

I didn't actually say anything about them being nice.  They're human, that's
all.  Sure, I've been tailed for driving while asian, mostly out in walnut
creek, or down the peninsula.  SF and Oakland cops have better things to do,
if given some basic politeness, they're smart enough to realize you're smart
enough to keep a handle on things.  Heck, just today one (who actually was
nice about it) let me off for not realizing I'd parked in a towaway zone.
That's a major revenue source for them and one they're encouraged to enforce
so he certainly didn't have to.  He had me and the towtruck was coming down
the street, but getting my cooperative ass out of there instead of backing
up traffic during rush hour was something he was willing to live with.

Even people who aren't particularly nice respond better to people who are.
If you treat them like the assholes some are, even nice people learn to be
assholes.  It's all basic game theory, really.

> After religiously following (and loving) his sets and productions in
> the 6 years since then, this year at the Detroit Electronic Music
> Festival I finally got to see him play in person, where he dropped an
> amazing 2 hour live/dj set on the main stage. If you talk to any
> techno fan that was there, you'll find a bunch of people ready to
> assert that his set was one of the highlights of the entire festival,
> hands down. And this year's fest had some sizzling sets indeed, by the
> likes of Richie Hawtin, Luciano, Marco Carola, Steve Bug, Jeff Mills,
> and many more. This guy is good. Really good.
>
> So, when [KONTROL] was approached by SUREFIRE (SF's illest dubstep
> crew) about wanting to collaborate on a show at the beautiful new

> album EM.Pulse, he's flying over all the way from Frankfurt just for

yo, just got final word.   and the news is good. :)

Dirk Diggler is doing a combo LIVE/DJ set and will be rocking it for THREE
HOURS from 1-4am.

so even if you've got plans eariler, come by after and you'll still catch a
couple hours of this guy when the place is really rockin'.  you seriously
won't regret it.  my friend Monica (Mkat), who's on this list, is one of th=
e
most discerning techno enthusiasts (read: snobs) ;) i know, and she said
Diggler's set was the best she saw at this year's DEMF.  and that's saying
something.


hope to see some SFRavers out sat!

WATCH THIS BEFORE IT'S TAKEN OFF THE WEB


It is extremely surprising that the Arab financed TV in Dubai would allow t=
his to air.  Be sure and watch this, it is so powerful I have no doubt she =
now has a very large price on her head.  I also have no doubt it won't be o=
n the air long.

She is one impressive woman.  Here is a powerful and amazing statement on A=
l Jereeza television. The woman is Wafa Sultan, an Arab-American psychologi=
st from Los Angeles. I would suggest watching it ASAP  because I don't know=
 how long the link will be active. This film clip should be shown around th=
e world repeatedly!

Did you just forward us a form letter?
God I hope it's not- "Al Jereeza"?
HAHAHA

Anyway- this is like 2-3 years old- good message but yeah, no need to  =

worry about it being "taken off the web".
NOTHING can be "taken off the web"...

Also- Al Jazeera is not headquartered in Dubai, it is based out of Qatar=

And if you want to go read about Qatar you will find it's about the most=

I was supposed to get paid today...they "forgot" to input our pay data and =
send it to the paychex folks until too late - so because of that, me be bro=
ke. They also "forgot" to deduct  my insurance for several months - and gue=
ss what gets taken out Monday when that check DOES get deposited.

Fun times due to human error 101.

Over THIS:


Friday, October 19th 10:00pm



Sunset Promotions & Mighty Breaks present Ninja Tune superstar

DJ Vadim

featuring MC's
Abstract Rude & Yarah Bravo

along with local heroes
Zeph & Azeem
DJ Ren (trueskool.org)
Mancub (Space Cowboys)
Murphstar (SEISMIC)
Motion Potion
Uplift
& the Lower Haters

DJ Vadim is a walking proof of the international reach of hip hop. Born in =
the Soviet Union, he immigrated to England as a teenager and in almost no t=
ime had set up a studio and released an EP. Soon signed to the groundbreaki=
ng and forward-thinking English label Ninja Tune, Vadim would spend the 90'=
s releasing a string of singles, compilations and albums that used abstract=
 breaks and trip hop to explore the themes of the country of his birth. His=
 2007 release "Soundcatcher" is almost a decade in the making, with every k=
ick, snare and clap tuned and arranged with the care of a master painter. T=
here are few producers anywhere who have been able to harness such sweet, s=
avory and always tasty sounds into their compositions. That Vadim manages t=
o make such rich music danceable, humorous and often downright funky, is a =
further testament to his genius. Appearing with two acclaimed MC's his perf=
ormance at Mighty will be a party for the dancers and an exposition for the=
 listeners.


SIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIICK!!!!!!!!!

It's really easy to bitch about how bad cops are at doing their job, but I
don't see those of you bitching about that lining up for police academy. I
suggest you spend some time reading police blogs and give some consideration
to what exactly goes into even becoming a cop and what kind of (absolutely
excessive) bullshit they have to deal with on a day to day basis.

If every time I arrested someone for a violent crime I had to spend the next
5-6 hours filling out meaningless, repetitive paperwork only to see them
back out on the streets in a month or two, well, yeah, I just might be kind
of pissed off most of the time.

People love to bitch about cops without realizing that they're just trying
to do their job, and they aren't the ones that make the rules. There are bad
cops out there, but I submit to you that those bad cops are the exception
rather than the rule. The real problem is the bureaucracy that makes it
almost impossible for them to do their job.

That and the Federal Reserve.

Weird.

I'm in my first epic flame war in years, (that's broken out between 
Norway and the USA on YouTube over this clip  
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1iNH7W9SC8 ), and I just had this 
exchange someone that lost some family member on $9/!!

My last comment is the money shot.

To me that's really the deal, and I'll tell ya what, I'm much more 
frightened at the prospect of a bunch of American Evangelicals that have 
graduated from the Air Force Academy who think they're on a Mission from 
God being given the keys to a Stealth Bomber that's fully loaded with 
nukes than I am about a bunch of angry young religious zealots who at 
best can steal a few planes.

Marc(o), Dude, you *really* need to read this book:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_of_Arabia

You will love it.

Hands down the most hysterically funny book I've read all this year, but 
what else would I expect from the dude that wrote "Thank You For Smoking" ?

anyone out there with an iPhone(y) and G(wiz)mail know how to have msgs skip
the inbox completely w/o the iPhone noticing them at all?

currently i have the "[sfraves]" label applied to sfr mail, i have it set
"skip inbox", but the iPhone still gets them as new mail.

no offense, but having SFR discussions like this and others sent to my
phone, making it go off every 47 seconds, makes instant access to email
quite useless.

thanks,

iPhone is g r a t e !

If you want to get on the "digest" version of sfraves

send a message to

Similar addresses exist for the digest list:

<sfraves-digest-unsubscribe@hyperreal.org>

Subject: [sfraves] Halloweenie


San Francisco may well be on the verge of a nightmare -
I don't wish it on the city - I just think the writing's on the wall.

Most of you know that I was (unlike many of you) -
a huge supporter of Gavin Newsom when he ran for mayor.
For the most part, many citizens agree that he has done
a decent job as mayor - as evidenced by that fact that he has
NO REAL opposition in his run for reelection.
I believe this 'fact' has left him complacent and seemingly
WAY OUT OF TOUCH with "REALITY" and that a major
disaster for San Francisco is only 16 Days Away !!

I truly believe that the following are verifiable "facts":

1)  Halloween, as a MAJOR holiday has continued to evolve
into a bigger and bigger occasion each year - this holiday shows
no sign of diminishing in public popularity.

2)  In many urban areas - especially San Francisco -
Halloween is NOT "just" a kid's holiday - it, in fact, is just
as important a holiday for 100s of thousands of adults.

3)  Like Christmas, New Year's Eve and the Fourth of July -
Halloween is one of those holidays that MUST be observed
on the proper date - just like there are lots of "Christmas"
parties in December - there is no deflecting people's attention
from the main event.  There may be lots of "Halloween"
parties on the weekend before the true date, and that may
be enough for a lot of people - but for MANY people -
Halloween is October 31st - period !

4)  People like "tradition".  For years, the tradition in San Francisco
was to celebrate Halloween along Polk Street - back when Polk Street
was the center of gay life in San Francisco - but for AT LEAST
the last 20 YEARS - the tradition has been to celebrate Halloween
in the Castro - where, as most residents and visitors alike know -
it can be Halloween 365 days a year.  Further complicating the problem -
no other city or area in the entire Bay Area is known for
Halloween night gatherings.

5)  In years, where Halloween falls on a weekend, large public
parties have drawn some of the crowd away from the Castro -
however, with Halloween occurring on a WEDNESDAY this year -
and with an absence of ANY large public parties ANYWHERE
in San Francisco - where exactly are people supposed to go ?
There is NOWHERE else - in the entire Bay Area - you can't
wish this away any more than you can bouga-bouga it away.

6)  Just because Mayor Newsom, his advisors, some (rightfully)
nervous public officials and the police decide to "cancel" Halloween
in the Castro - and OFFER NO ALTERNATIVE - does not mean
that people will stay home or out of San Francisco.

7)  Removing porta potties from the Castro for the evening will not
ensure that people are not FORCED to go to the bathroom in
Castro residents' yards, driveways, and front doors.

8)  Refusing to close the streets does not mean that the streets
will not HAVE to be closed - the city grudgingly admits this, thinking
that maybe a block or two of the Castro itself may have to be shut down.
Closing the MUNI station in the Castro will only contribute to MORE
traffic congestion in the city.

9)  Refusing to properly erect barricades and install metal detectors
at security check points will not reduce the presence of potentially dangers
costumes and accoutrements in the Castro - it will, in fact, INCREASE
the likelihood that someone will get hurt - this is entirely preventable -
and should someone get hurt - I think that a good lawyer will be able
to prove that the city was negligent in not preventing or minimizing
the possibility of serious injury (or worse).

10)  The City of San Francisco is planning to spend money on
an ad campaign telling people to "STAY AWAY" - and they are also
planning to spend money on 600 police officers with a zero tolerance
attitude towards those "under the influence".  Not smart.

11)  The FACT of the matter is that the police and public officials
ARE NEVER in charge of large public gatherings - it is STUPID
of them to think that they are - especially in San Francisco.
There are, in fact, hundreds of thousands of people in San Francisco
who are, in fact, VERY cool - even when "under the influence".
These random, unknown, unofficial people are the ones who CAN
and DO control the crowds at all large public gatherings in San Francisco.

Need an example ? - 2 or 3 Drag Queens (Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence)
can control hundreds if not thousands of people - BETTER - than
100 fully loaded policemen.

12)  OK - Nine people were shot in the Castro last year - not within
the official boundaries of the party, but nearby.  Does ANYONE
in their right mind, think that banning Halloween in the Castro is going
to keep "that element" away ?  No it is not.

Does ANYONE think that by banning sound systems and any kind
of diversion or entertainment that the Castro will be "safer" ?
No it will not.

Does ANYONE think that a largely increased police presence - that
is, in fact, LOOKING FOR TROUBLE (zero tolerance) - will make
the Castro safer for its residents and businesses ?  In fact, the absence
of diversions, the crowds and the police presence add up to a powder keg
of potential trouble.

As I see it the purpose of public officials and the police is to create
an environment where businesses can FLOURISH and citizens
can gather, safely. (asking Castro
businesses, especially bars, to close down on one of their potentially
most lucrative evenings of the year is, in a word - STUPID.
Making the people coming to the Castro the enemy is - STUPID.

The truth in the old saying - when life gives you lemons, make lemonade -
couldn't be more applicable here.  Many of us PERSONALLY know
people who could turn this whole thing around - even at this late hour.

The CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO SHOULD

1)   Get at least 8 to 10 Sound Systems into the Castro for the evening.

2)   Have a publicly sanctioned 'kid event' (organized by Cliff's)
       happening at 5 in the afternoon.

3)   Get a couple of hundred (at least) porta potties on the scene.

4)  Effectively "seal off" Castro by 6 in the afternoon - require EVERYONE
entering the area to pass through metal detectors - have your police presence
at the barricades on standby - ready to assist - not ready to confront.

5)  Get some pieces of 'oh,wow' Burning Man art on display for the evening.
Get a couple of major burn platforms in place - people love bonfires.

6)  Ask for help - from Anon Salon, from  SFRaves, from The Sisters, from
Tranny Shack, from Burners,  from Hippies, from Freaks - there are hundreds
of organized and disorganized social and arts groups that could at the drop
of a hat SHOW UP IN FORCE - all amazingly well costumed looking to dance,
to look and be looked at - NONE OF THEM LOOKING FOR TROUBLE.

All of this (and more) could be accomplished in 15 Days - and the resultant
good vibes could save the city a lot of hassles that seem inevitable if the
current "denial and confrontation" attitude coming from city hall continues.

Gavin, get a clue - if the current drift on Halloween in the Castro 
continues -
you WILL be held directly accountable - by the electorate !!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Halloweenie

A densely populated residential neighborhood with a reputation that
pushes the buttons of a large chunk of American society is probably
the worst place to have an drunken, rowdy, public, jam packed event.

I'm not sure why anybody would advocate for maintaining this event in
the Castro and not moving it to SOMA or around City Hall, or even
South Beach, where the other fests take place. If it's so strongly
linked to the Castro culture, have a low-key parade instead that lasts
an hour or so and move the parties indoors.

Seriously...it's dark, alcohol-fueled, and the majority of the
participants are unidentifyable due to costuming and it's so densely
packed that anything can happen.

I went only once when I first moved here and was so bruised up from
all the drunken yahoos that I've vowed never to go back. I also had my
new car keyed but some drunken asshole.

That right there is the very reason anybody living in the Castro would
probably argue for banning the event outright. If I owned property in
the Castro, I'd set up a neighborhood watch to make sure nobody in a
costume entered my street on that particular night.

The only thing "forcing" public balast making, vandalism or any of the
other behavior that typically happens around this event is disrespect
for oneself and another's property, and the level of tolerance the
neighborhood has shown in the past.

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: DIRTY w/ Lawgiverz, FCB - October 20th @ DNA Lounge

DIRTY
October 20th, 2007
DNA Lounge - 375 11th St.
$10 presales - Here!!
$10 b4 11pm / $15 after
10pm - 4am
21+

It's been a few months since Evil Breaks has done a bigger party, and
we figured we'd come back with something HUGE!!! We can't wait to see
what these guys sound like on DNA's amazing sound system, and along
with the amazing local support, Visuals by Viberation, and a special
surprise guest upstairs, I really don't think you're going to want to
miss this.


E.B.'s Dirty little room w/visuals by Viberation:


Lawgiverz (Trigger/Botchit) - UK

Lawgiverz, a.k.a. R-Kidz and Noize, have been dropping audio bombs for
the last five years on Botchit & Scarper, Trigger Recordings and more.
Lawgiverz have produced, programmed and remixed with a bizarre
selection of artists such as Jeff Beck, Dave Stewart and The Human
League. They would like you to know that none of this really matters.
Just that if you find yourself in front of the Trigger sound system or
at DNA during their laptop and turntable set, prepare to be destroyed
with a helping of alien love in the Electrobreaks style.



Fine Cut Bodies (Chi Recordings/Record Records) - Budapest

Even though the name Fine Cut Bodies implies more than one person,
behind the FCB letters is only one man, Kevin aka Attila Fodor. His
musical tastes are extremely broad which is reflected in the musical
preferences of *Chi Recordings*, the label he co-founded in 2000. One
of the most important taste-maker DJs in Hungary, he has been one of
the key DJs/promoters that built up the huge breaks scene in Hungary
and he is now starting to build up the world class underground minimal
and tech-house scene in Budapest.

As a DJ, Kevin's taste is determined more by his musical attitude than
by any specific genre: he looks for music that's experimental but not
selfish, interesting but not unlistenable. As a producer, he has
released tracks in many genres and is always looking for new sonic
adventures. Kevin's tracks have been licensed for numerous
compilations and he has collaborated with and remixed for some of the
hottest names in electronic music.

Aaron Jae (E.B./XM Radio/Space Cowboys)
Bam (Evil Breaks/ABN)
M.O.D. (Evil Breaks)
Raydeus (Pronoia)



Beat Church hosting the upstairs room:

Lawgiverz (A 2nd Mid-tempo set)

Kitty-D (The Glitch Mob/Beat Church)
Hookerz & Blow (Mozaic vs EPROM)
Benchun(False Profit)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Halloweenie

Subject: [sfraves] Fractured w/ Robert Natus & ArkusP Live Battle PA 10.17.07

Greets,

Well.. I've kind of been around here for a while ('98 to '06), but left 
over the last year...  Just a note.. This is the last EDM event I'm 
promoting unless magically I can get a crew together. Since there isn't 
a scene (let alone an industry) for techno (outside of the most adult 
contemporary minimal variety / and thats still just a scene!) in the US 
I'm giving up the fight. I'm happy with what I accomplished. Over the 
past couple of years I hosted some really neat UGs that were focused on 
moving into a new territory. For me this is advanced spatial audio for 
2D and 3D arrays. I wished I could have invited everyone to these 
events, but with this final event I'm doing it at a public venue. I'm 
not giving up music.. In fact I've started an audio hardware company 
called Periphony Systems (www.periphonysystems.com / new web site soon!) 
and am focusing fully on the tech angle as that seems the only way one 
can create a professional career in the US outside of pandering to the 
masses.. Nonetheless.. I hope some of you can make it out for this final 
event. I know there are several techno heads here that never have made 
it out to any of my events.. Well this is possibly your last chance.. :) 
I'm quite glad with the lineup, so come check it out..

Best,
--Mike

---------------------------------------

EGR Records invites you to Fractured on Wednesday October 17th, 2007 at 
the DNA Lounge in San Francisco.

I'm pleased to be working with two talented and well known international 
producers from Germany, Robert Natus (Abstract/Bitshift) and Arkus P 
(Abstract). I've been playing their music for the last 5 years and it 
will be a treat to have them perform in SF. In support will be myself 
(Catharsis), Mochipet (Daly City Records), DJ Intoner (Death Guild), 
Mitch (Death Guild), and Bloody Snowman (Daly City Records). This event 
will be a full night of quality music covering industrial-techno, 
breakcore, powernoise, and IDM.

This will be the last EGR event for quite some time, so come out and 
enjoy it and make this one to remember!

Where: DNA Lounge; 375 11th St. San Francisco CA
When: 10/17/07; SF 9:30pm to 2am
Cost: $7 @ door before 11pm; $10 afterwards
http://www.egregious.net/events/2007/fractured/

***If you would like to sign up for the EGR announcement email list 
(very low volume) and get a discount on entry send an email to 
katharsis7@yahoo.com w/ EGR List Entry in the title. This will give you 
a $5 ticket before 10pm, but if you are in line outside the venue before 
9:30pm (opening) you will get in for free (cut off immediately at 
9:30pm). If you're on a budget this is quite a deal for the lineup 
presented at Fractured!***

Check out an older live battle PA from Robert Natus & Arkus P to get an 
idea of their music if you are not familiar!

Lineup (Main Room):
9:30pm to 11:00pm     Catharsis (EGR Records; SF)  on 3 decks!
11:00pm to 2:00am     Robert Natus vs Arkus P Live Battle PA (Abstract; 
Hamburg/Frankfurt Germany)

Upstairs Room (breakcore/powernoise/IDM)
Time     Performer
9:30pm to 10:30pm     DJ Intoner (Death Guild; Oakland)
10:30pm to 11:30pm     Bloody Snowman (Daly City Records)

12:00am to 1:00am     Mochipet (Daly City Records; SF)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Halloweenie

Try the Transbsy terminal on the day of the first good rain of the year.

You've got six months of bum funk, crackhead piss, and junkie poo  
that's been accumulating in the shrubbery and all the little nooks  
and crannies.  When the rains come, it all re-hydrates at once, and  
the whole place stinks like raw sewage.

I bet if those nitwits at the Guardian who think the city shouldn't  
be prosecuting "quality of life" crimes had to go through the  
terminal every day to get to and from work, they'd be singing a  
different tune.


cya,
john

Hey by the way I think I got accepted for readmission to UCSC so  
things are looking gooou-oood.  And I met a cat last night, this stray  
kitty jumped right on my lap from out of nowhere.  Won't be bringing  
it home though.

Have a good one and enjoy today's quote.  It's a double quote.

Subject: [sfraves] WR: Sac to Berk: my weekend raver gypsy weekend

So Saturday i was "needed" up in Sac... :code TV was suppose to cover this
relaunch/ 3 yr anniversary shindig for LEGENDmag.  So i wnet up there w/
Roni & KC & oooh shit man... ok.. the spot was this store front building
on 20th & something & the kinda space there was like for 3 stores w/ no
walls yet.. so it was huge!!!  Set up was kinda laggin', but no really
decorations, just a few banners that had some LEGENDmag articles on them. 
But then there was also a redbull/ vodka bar (they were 1 of the
sponsers), a DJ booth/ dance floor, like 6 or 7 indy clothing vendors, a
photo area where this photographer dude like took pictures of random
people, & a make up artist who lol, powdered me when i was sweaty & we had
to shoot a segment, oh oh oh, & there was this movie Dude who showed his
films on this projector all night!  The shindig started @ 6, but the
action didn't start 'til around like 7:30ish...

There's this thing in Downtown SAc called 2nd Saturdays.. it's like this
mondo party every second Sat of the summer months... so as soon as evening
hit.. there were hordes of people walking around to the near by bars &
clubs... oh yeah.. there was even a DJ spinning outta store in the same
building on the opposite side of where we were!!

So pretty much there was alot goin' @ the mag shindig... all the clothes i
saw were so damn yummy!!  But hmmm... they wre kinda expensive... oh
yeah... so like every interview we did, we like totally had to shoot twice
cause the Editor, Rai-mon, wanted to make a show for the website too!  So
anywaze.. it was kinda funny.. i ended up like interviewing the
photographer dude & he like like took hella pictures of me during the
interveiw... it was funny... i mean... & add to that the 2 other phot
shoots i did with him when before we interviewed him... that was funny!

But yeah.. hella people showed up & I met sooo many Groovy people!!  The
break dancers were fuckin' ill!  There was this Chic dance group that i
missed thought :(  I think i was outside takin' a break & cooling out
''cause it got totally mondo hot in the party with all them super duper
power lamps.

All in all.. Hello 2Day, i had such a Groovy Awesome time! It was fuckin'
So Dope too 'cause i ended up seeing a few Sac homies :)  I wish i coulda
called more of the Sac Familia.. but i had no #'s :(  Oh oh oh oh ohoh...
the DJs were dope... the 1st DJ played this old skool hop set, the 2nd DJ
spun like hella booty retro clubby 80's 90's music & he dropped Ghetto
Tech!!!  YUM!!  I don't really like remember what the 3rd DJ spun 'cause
me & Roni wanted to catch more interviews before the party wrapped up...

I'll probably write another post about the mag & tell y'all what it's all
about... I think the website's up too & link y'all to that :)

Around like 12:30ish...  after everything was cleaned up as much as
possible & stuff put away, we cut, tired as fuck & kinda burnt from the
night... I was suppose to go to this surprise birthday party in Berk for
my Homie Al.. but i was just so like burnt from well.. i didn't get that
much sleep the night before which i guess added to the hustle & bustle of
the day...

But after we crossed the Carquinez bridge... lol.. i seriously got like
this mondo second wind & said fuck it... i need to go to Berk.. so i did
'cause i didn't wanna be all guilty for missing my Bro's bday!  OK.. lemme
just say that 16 hours later... I was @ another house for a mini party,
then after that.. took BART home ;)  HELLO 2DAY!!!  Yeah.. ok.. partied in
true Rockstar fashion, got so happy to around mi rave familia, danced,
laughed, almost played ummmm around, talked, oh oh oh oh, ok so like me &
this dude who i've always been like on well.. he always hated me fr some
reason, well, I've always called him Mikey Meanie Gay 'cause he was always
like this snob to me when we wre at the same place... but yeah... we
heeeeeeeeella talked it out & like totally made up & fuck man.. it just
felt so good to air out that mondo dirty laundry!!  So YAY!!!

Yeah... I left my house @ 2PM Saturday & got home @ 9:30PMish on Sunday!! 
So Dope!!  Hello 2day... it took me all day to get unhungover!!

Subject: [sfraves] [BSP] Oct.26 :: 180 minutes of Butane :: 60 minutes with Kontakt

Friday October 26: Filter at Anu is pleased to host the return of ::::

B U T A N E (Alphahouse/Berlin) with a 3 hour Dj set.

Plus BABD + Filter founder Kontakt with a Live PA premier.

Anu-bar
46 Sixth Street, SF
$5 before 11:00 PM
$10 after 11:00


If you were at the Detroit Electronic Music Festival this year,
Butane's two, count em, two memorable performances placed his name on
the lips of many minimal house and techno fans.

Now based in Berlin, Butane - who founded the Alphahouse party and
label - has managed to solidify his already infamous reputation as a
captivating performer. He's one who knows well that "minimal" is
merely a philosophy to be applied, rather than a narrow range of
sounds.

If you missed him last time we brought him to S.F on that rainy
February night, you'll know where to go Friday, October 26.

Get to Anu early to catch a three hour DJ set, plus a Live PA premier
of new + soon to be released material by Filter's Kontakt.

Kontakt grew up at the onset of Montreal's post-punk milleux, sharing
the love of initial imports from the likes of Gary Neuman and Joy
Division before the "The Unknown Pleasures" album art became staple
dorm room decor.

No fan of disco, or the early house music that followed, Kontakt
avoided the decade of dance music's rise and fall, to embrace its
eventual rebirth in the form of beat-centric minimalism, ambiant,
experimental and techno.

Two years after picking up his first set of turntables only to toss em
in favor of embracing the digital evolution, we bring you Kontakt's
debut Live PA set.

Hours of exposure to early U.K. post-punk made it's imprint. If
Ritchie Hawtin had been born a decade earlier in Manchester and had
Ian Curtis had listened to Kraftwerk rather than Iggy Pop...then,
well....we might have had.......

never mind.

Just get drunk with us, enjoy the show and show us some wigglin'!

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: Pt. 2 of the 14 yr. anniversary for An Epiphany Of Sound Thur.

So, I'm extending the celebration of 14 yrs. of An Epiphany Of Sound 
this Thursday by bringing in local techno musician Chel-C Faith for a 
live P.A.  She'll be working from a table full of gear, live from the 
KZSU Studios (if you want to look in, be sure to go to 
http://studio.stanford.edu) beginning at 10a.  I'll be filling the 
9a-10a gap with a techno mix too.  Mmmm techno!

As usual, the show is from 9a-noon Thur. on 90.1 FM in the bay area, and 
online at http://kzsulive.stanford.edu

Hope you tune in and help me celebrate!

honestly... it was fucking sweet! i wasn't quite sure what to expect, but this party turned out to be the greatest close to the campout season i could have hoped for. the scenery was incredible, my crew got some really reckless mountain biking in, the music was kickass the entire time (except for one set on saturday night - wtf, who still plays "the launch"?!) and it never stopped! 

maybe i'm getting old, but i'm kind of done with campouts that are basically a bunch of kids on drugs. acid totem's crowd wasn't like that *at all*. it was really refreshing to be around a crowd that was all smiles and super positive without being all "can i give you a hug?" and trying to drink my water ;)

seriously, props to acid totem. i'd definitely go to this party again next year. the beauty of the location alone would seal the deal for me, but the rockin' tunes, excellent neighbors, and chilled out vibe make it completely awesome. 

thanks to all involved for helping me end the campout season on such a high note!

love,
mo

Doh- the launch?!?!  I know who played it, but I won't say.  I had to ask
xxx when they played if if they had dropped a pill or something-  I don't
know what that was all bout!  But yah, you missed out Bam.  From roasted
twizzlers, to tater bugs everywhere sunday morning, and the occasional
tarantula.  I dunno about a camp out, but we'll be at least pulling off one
night in big sur in '08-  outside of the rainy season!

well if it's any consolation, i think the booming bass kept the tarantulas a safe distance away. the one tarantula sighting that i heard of (and saw a picture of - holy shit!) was a fair hike away from the party spot. 

and dude, there was like 30 seconds of drizzle and the sound was for sure going off by the time i got there. you would have had a great time with us :)

maybe i'll catch you at an outdoor next summer. i don't think i've had the pleasure of stomping around in the dirt with you yet.

love,
mo

Omfg I am so glad I wasn't there now!! (ok, not really, but I fucking loathe spiders!)

FWIW, I have heard nothin' but good things about this campout - if people wouldn't have called me and some friends who were going to trek down and said "it's raining, there's no sound going off", I woulda made it there...

meh.

i'm saying "slightly" more tame because there's still going to be two sound systems, costumed weirdos, and free-flowing brews, but i'm expecting lots of room to move and an atmosphere that allows conversation. 

here's the deal: the folks from the loft/warehouse space where we threw the Want It party asked us to help them throw a little halloween bash. we left a bunch of our sound and deco up and invited some friends, and if you're not feeling the crazy halloween ragers this year you might want to join us. it's a free party, and we're not really going for a packed house. this is basically a homies party, and you're invited.

details are as follows:

      Saturday, October 27th
1300 Potrero presents: Halloween 2007
Featuring DJs from the Ambient Mafia and Want It!
    This Halloween, the 1300 Potrero crew is bringing you an evening of devilish tunes, ghastly wardrobes, and dancing with the undead in an intimate underground setting. Theres no cover so you wont have to sell your soul to have a sinfully good time!
     
Two rooms of music! Photobooth to record your drunken antics!
    
Your turntable tricksters for the evening are:
                          
Gowenauf
dj chai
Dr. Hickory and Mr. Stone
Julio Midnite
Tatar
Actual Rafiq
mo corleone
dj.malloc()
Olde Spooky
Spookeasy Ray

Full holiday garb is more than welcome See you there!
          Halloween 2007
1300 Potrero, San   Francisco, CA
10:00pm  4:00am
21+ w/ID to drink

Subject: [sfraves] the best portable DJ "table" solution you've seen

folding table?

keyboard stand?

cinder blocks with a door on top?

what's the best portable solution to set up DJ gear at a
club/rave/whatever that you've seen?

For a really portable setup, the Fingermonsters use heavy-duty keyboard sta=

The Odyssey FRDJ19WDLX is kind of hard to beat for the
price-point, though it's not necessarily sexy or the
most rugged.

on the lighter (weight-wise) side - -

get a couple of those white and orange signs that they put out for 
street closures -
the ones they use to let you know that you can't park because PG&E is 
doing some work -
super light and they fold up for easy transportation

anyway - line up 2 of those about 3 feet from each other
take the lid from your coffin (do people still use those ?)
place that so that it nests between the highway signs
and place your coffin bottom on top of the coffin top -
ready to go in minutes - especially great for outdoor setups

what brand/model keyboard stands are you guys using?

i'm always worried a keyboard stand won't handle the weight/width of a
mixer, tables and CDJs.

Typos, typos, typos.

Obviously, gus -> guys,
and Satnist -> Satanist.

Sorry for interrupting your normally scheduled programming.

You could do the same thing with saw horses from Home
Depot. They work great and you don't have to steal
them like you would the white and orange street
closure signs lol. The ones I have are even hight and
width adjustable. I don't know if you can still find
the adjustable ones but the regular ones are the right
hight anyways and would work fine. Just put your
coffin right on top of them or use a thick slab of
wood or MDF to put your decks and mixer on and your
set.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] the best portable DJ "table" solution you've seen

The whole SF mayor thing is such an embarassment to San Francisco, and
has been for a long time, but it seems to reflect the general atitude
and configuration of SF's ridiculously polarized yet still overtly
white and pseudo liberal population.

Newsome, representing white yuppie scumbag zombies from half the
Castro to the Marina; Chicken John, representing white freaky hipster
Mission and Haight area burners on the other.

Can we talk about Oakland's Ron Dellums instead? He's the African
American to represent in Congress.

Since I'm new to the list, I thought I would share what VA parties currentl=
y look like.

This is the new party I'm doing in Fredericksburg, VA. We play a wide varie=

In case folks aren't familiar with giant scrotum man, he's been a staple 
in the Bay To Breakers race.  He was also at the start of this years 
World Naked Bike Ride (but he didn't ride, and he wasn't inflated.)

Here's a pic:

Subject: [sfraves] TheDJList.com spams

Just got my 1st spam (or at least the 1st one that I noticed) to a 
unique/non-dictionary email address that shows that thedjlist.com either 
sold or traded email addresses.  (Looking further it looks like they may 
have sold/traded it to a performer for a Ruby Skye appearance back in 
July.)

Just an FYI for folks out there.

I almost 100% of the time these days use a unique address for each 
website I register with (and ONLY expose it to them in their 
registration page.)  Thus I can be certain when this sort of thing 
happens.

<<<<The Torture Chamber: Techno / Trance / Electro>>>>

++COMMANDER TOM++
(Noom, Ministry Sound, Eternal Tour, commander-tom.com - Germany)
Well unless you've been living in a cave the last 10 years the name =
Commander Tom shouldn't need any introduction. Tom has been DJing and =
creating music for the last 25 years. He has played at almost all the =
big raves around, including Energy 92-96, Tribal Gathering, Omni 93, =
Rave City 3 and 4, Union Move, Time Tunnel, and the infamous Love =
Parades in Berlin. Throughout the mid to late 90's when trance and =
techno were growing continually farther apart, tom helped define the =
murky area between the two, a unique sound he trademarked his own.

The cult began in spring 1994 when "Are Am Eye" was released as #13 on =
NOOM. This record sold more than 100,000 copies worldwide on vinyl =
format only and it grew up to be the club anthem of the 90's. Today this =
classic is still a basic part of DJ-sets all over the world. Tom has =
produced a lot of remixes for artists such as Baby Doc, Chris Liberator, =
Tesox, Jon the Dentist, DJ Sammy, and many more. Commander Tom is now =
one of the world's most extensively toured DJs, spreading his unique =
sound as far and wide as possible.

++ANT ++
(Powertools / Stay Up Forever - U.K.)
ANT is one of the primary DJ's and producers for the Stay Up Forever =
Collective, London, and owner of Powertools Records, one of the many, =

been DJing nationally and internationally since 1994 and leaving his =
mark on vinyl since 1997. London's infamous free party scene played host =
to ANT's first DJ experiences and over the pursuing decade, he continued =
making a name for himself DJing throughout the U.K. as well as in =
countries such as Brazil, Venezuela, South Africa, Poland, Bulgaria, =
Sardinia, Ireland, Holland, France, U.S.A., Canada, Czech Republic, =
Russia, Spain, Israel and Japan. From the knowledge gained as the =
in-house engineer for Kinetec Studios for over 4 years, he advanced his =
producing career and honed his sound further by starting Powertools =
Records, as well as creating The Power Plant, the studio in which he =
writes his music today. ANT's studio and productions have played host to =
a variety of like-minded people right through from techno and hardcore's =
Lenny Dee to hard-dance's Andy Farley, not forgetting to mention all the =
regular London techno team-mates, namely the Liberators, D.A.V.E. The =
Drummer and Geezer. Ant has also worked on projects outside of the =
techno spectrum, creating music for video and TV for the likes of MTV =
Europe and Sony, as well as recording under pseudonyms such as the dance =
chart-topping, "Stratosphere".

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: You know what isn't fun?

Getting bit by a brown recluse or black widow! 

After 3 days of watching my leg swell, harden into a
mass of necrosis riden tissue, I am on my way to the
hospital to meet a specialist at 2:45. To make it even
more fun, since I don't have the spider, they can't
give me anti-venom. So, depending on what the doctor
thinks, I might be having a nice size chunk of leg
removed to keep the poison from killing the rest of
calf.

YEAH. 

Eric

Weak!!! I've got a rattlesnake bite repair kit you can borrow if you want. No anit-venom, but it's got some iodine to clean the cut with. Cool suction cups too! I won't need the scalpel back. . . Not sure about how to fill the leg, perhaps some duct tape & bondo? You know how we do it. 

Good luck man,

chuck

Just got back....

No cutting yet. As of now, they put me on heavy duty
steroids and a month of augmenton (sp?) ... with
strict instructions thhat if the basbeall sized hard
lump of ooze and dead/dying tissue grows, to
immediately go back to the emergency room.

Apparently, the toxin continues to kill tissue for a
week or two after the bite... So I am in wait and see
mode for the time being.... at least the antibiotics
will keep me from getting blood poisoning or somthing
to that affect.  Had I cought the spider they would
have given me anti-venom, but since they can only
guess at what it is, they are doing all they can.
Toxicology on it would take longer to figure out than
the time to administer anti-venom is possible

Interestingly, it doesn't really hurt  that bad. I
felt no bite at all. Didn't sting or anything...
although, it looks pretty fucking gross... like a
baseball with a volcano on top. ;)

Peas.

ouchies!!!
  sorry to hear about your bite...my ex was bitten by a brown recluse on his mid section of his arm..the otherside of the elbow...anyways.....
  they almost had to amutate his arm..from the elbow down...but instead they burned off the dead area...so the skin  wont continue to die...thou they didnt have the spider..since it went inside his sleeping bag at the time..the docs still figured out it was a brown recluse..i guess maybe the area where he was staioned at..i think it was texas or kansas..
   
  hope you feel better soon

guess at what it is, they are doing all they can.
Toxicology on it would take longer to figure out than
the time to administer anti-venom is possible

Interestingly, it doesn't really hurt that bad. I
felt no bite at all. Didn't sting or anything...
although, it looks pretty fucking gross... like a
baseball with a volcano on top. ;)

Peas.

Just tried taking pictures, but my whole lower leg is
so swollen, the bite only sticks out a little from the
rest (about an inch)... most of the baseball is inside
my skin... I have a big old cankle at the moment...
next to my other leg, my lower calf is about 3 inches
bigger around. Looks a lot better ( or grosser) in
person. The pictures need to be 3D to really see. But
I'll keep trying for that perfect kodak moment shot.

For the gross factor... I will take pictures when they
lance it later this week... That ought to provide
plenty of nastiness. LOL.

those things are pure evil.  they aren't really part of any significant food
chains, and when they bite it's never intentionally provoked.  brown recluse
spiders are one of the few things I've actually wondered why God ever made
them (along with Hilary Clinton and meth).  Really sucks you got bitten,
hope the recovery goes as well as possible.

ooooooooooh Eric :(  I'm soo like hella Sorry to hear that happened to you
Homie :(

There's a show they used to show on Animal Planet called "the real wild
show" & on 1 of their segments, they had these spider farmers in South
America who collected mondo huge spiders & milked them for their venom &
they sent out their supplies to like well.. i ain't seen it that show in a
while since the stopped BBC programming on Animal Planet.. ummmm... but
yeah.. Homie.. I hope you don't have to have you're something on your like
leg amputated, chopped off, or something like hella mondo yucky scary like
that!  if u do.. maybe they can replace it w/ Bionics... if that's even
possible... like Jaime Summers has these bionic antibodies in her blood
stream that automatically & quickly repair any sudden injuries on her
body.. ok.> Hello 2day.. i watch TOO MUCH TV,, I know.. I'm mondo
lamesauce!!  But inquire about that spider farm in South America..
serioulsy!

Yeah... i'm sure there's a branch of the secret underground agency that
does bionics in LV somewhere if u lok hard enough.. well... if it's really
real anyway...

Love U Eric!!!

Butane [Alphahouse/berlin] 3 hour dj set


///////////////////////////////////////////

*About Butane, aka Andrew Rasse [Alphahouse/Berlin/St. Louis]:*

Having relocated from St. Louis to Berlin, Alphahouse label boss and
partymaker Butane has managed to solidify his already infamous reputation as
a captivating performer whose success rests on his own merits.

Because he knows well that "minimal" is merely a philosophy to be applied,
rather than a narrow range of sounds, Butane is so high in demand as both a
producer as well as a DJ.

His tracks have been featured on Matthew Dear's Fabric compilation as well
as Luciano's HiFi SciFi, plus labels Dumb Unit, Num and Ryrgular.

Narcotic killers like "On the Ket" and catalog of remixes and co-productions
have set him apart from the crowd as a true master of dark and twisted
dancefloor kemistry.

*Check out video of these performances from this past year's DEMF:*

*About Kontakt [aka Yanni Ehm, co-founder of Bay Area Beatdrop and Filter.SF
]:*

Growing up on post-punk rock and the early analog techno sounds of Joy
Division, Filter founder Kontakt shunned the decade of disco + house music,
gravitating instead to ambient, IDM + trip-hop, and finally working toward
his own digital production.

Kontakt's Live PA is a minimal progression toward maximized-hypno techno
with touches of filtered mono-bass, tones on tails, reverb pongo-dial
overlays, texturized attacks and congo-enhanced swing beats.

Subject: [sfraves] why the scene is how it is and how we can change it

------=_Part_442_4624817.1193300540781
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Disposition: inline

I'm about to make a lot of enemies with this, but hey, it's truth. Here are
my thoughts on the way the scene is going and what we have to do to change
it. I've compiled a list of the things that whether you realize it or not,
are negatively affecting the scene. They may be well intentioned, but the
laws of cause and effect are what we really have to look at here

1. DJ's with over-inflated ego's who believe the rave is about them
2. People being spectators rather than participators in the rave experience
3. Kandi (here's where i'm making a lot of enemies, but i'll make my case if
you can supress your kandi filled brain and continue reading)
4. A lack of creativity and originality and artistry in the creation of a
rave
5. The need to appeal to the masses for the pure desire of money (if you are
going to do this as a promoter you have no right to call your party a rave)

Let's review, shall we?

1. First of all DJ's seem to hold themselves above the music they're
playing, as if they're the center of the rave, not the ravers, or the music,
which is destroying the very soul of rave. people tend to face the stage and
cheer the dj on, rather than dance and express themselves or interact and
enjoy the EXPERIENCE of the rave. THE DJ IS NOT A GOD, AND STOP PRETENDING
HE IS.

2 I would say the mass majority of people that come into a rave come in with
the mindset of coming to be entertained not to be an entertainer. You ought
to come with the mindset of being a contributer to the rave experience and
creating your OWN FUN. be an artist, dress up, bring cookies, shit, bring a
propane gun and fire that shit off in the middle of the dance floor.

3 Here's the one people will probably hound me on but let me explain.
Alright, i get it. it's a nice jester, wait, no it isn't. you spend hours
making an armful of kandi and guess what? how much thought did you put into
each piece? how original, personal, or thoughtful is that little piece of
plastic? kandi is a fad with good intentions that's inspiring conformity
over creativity and originality. why don't you try making individual gifts
with thought put behind each one and give a few gifts to a few people that
really deserve it? rather than whore out your pieces of plastic to "seem"
like a generous person. Not to mention the perpetuation of kandi mostly
perpetuates a kiddy fashion statement or fad

4 How many raves have you seen that have, oh lets see, a room, a table, some
cd'js....maybe a couple posters. There is a clear lack of decorations and
mood setting themes. come on! make me think im under water or in a cavern or
in a fucking jungle with bat shit insane ape monkeys. There's also a clear
lack of costume and roleplay (seriously, people throwing the party ought to
be dressed up with an alter-ego to flare in an artistic fashion to the
people coming in the door) as well as you could bring in things for people
to interact with at the rave. how about a box full of mirrors that people
can sit inside? (ok i stole that one from burning man, but still, you get
the idea, or maybe interactive lights. a hug booth. maybe you could do some
performance art on one side of the room, SERIOUSLY)

5 Please don't try to tell everyone and their mother to come to your rave
(or any rave), UNLESS you are willing to seriously tell them what a rave is
supposed to be about, and that they know they're supposed to be a
contributing member to the rave experience, rather than a spectator to see
something that "everyone's doing"

Ok, that's it. You can hate me or love me for it i don't care, but that's my
views on why rave's (i should say some because their are some very very few
raves that do follow this criteria, but i would say most do)

Go be an artist, dress up, play games, contribute, have fun, and most of
all, fuck shit up. scare the crap out of people

later

Exactly, God is a woman, and so is her DJ. ;-)

DJ Mag's results of the top DJ poll just came out. Popularity contests are
always rigged through aggressive Myspace campaigns and apparant jakking, so
we can all pretty much toss this one.

A better poll would attemp to draw out and qualify: performance, technique,
style, innovation, # of releases, remixes and or # of bookings.

Anybody on this list run the Nitevibe dreamteam poll? I'd love to see them
integrate some of these questions. I'm sure
the results would look a lot different than they have in the past few years=

Partying like it's 1999? Trance and progressive house were again big winner=
s
in DJ Mag's controversial reader's poll.

For a sixth year running, the top spot went to a trance jock - this time
30-year-old Dutchman Armin Van
Buuren<http://www.residentadvisor.net/dj-page.aspx?id=3D6>,
who took the number one spot from last year's winner Paul Van Dyk. The
undeniably huge Tiesto (who has 307,887 friends on MySpace) nabbed second
place, while progressive house stalwarts John Digweed and Sasha rounded out
the top five.

"It's a really big honour, I'm kind of stunned, y'know?" Van Buuren told DJ
Mag. "It's basically a dream come true!"

Hard techno also made a traditionally big showing with Umek, Carl Cox,
Valentino Kanzyani, Marco Bailey all making the list, while DJ Mag's strong
UK focus snagged places for local radio names such as Pete Tong, Judge Jule=
s
and Lisa Lashes. Psychedelic trance also proved popular with the likes of
Infected Mushroom, Astrix and Yahel all placing highly.

Curiously, plenty of votes came in for acts not really known for their
DJing, including The Chemical Brothers, Daft Punk, Trentemoller, BT and
Booka Shade.

This year's poll was steeped in controversy, with a number of DJs, includin=
g
Christopher Lawrence and DJ Dan, being disqualified amid accusations of
vote-rigging <http://www.residentadvisor.net/news.aspx?id=3D8926>. This yea=
r
DJ Mag collated the 345,000 cast votes in-house for the first time, and als=
o
instituted new rules to cut down on multiple-voting, a persistent problem
with Internet polls. "This year, I made a decision to investigate votes
where the same IP address appeared over 50 times for the same person,"
explains publisher James Robertson on the DJ Mag website.

No love lost I hope, but I choose my passion.  Techno.  Heather Heart.  Meat Beat.  A place I love to jump up and down in.  Goddamn I got a good costume this time around I promise.

BIG UP TO US SCORPIOS.

love always

I hate being torn between Tonal, which will be a PHENOMENAL party and 
the meat beat dirty oakland experience. I know my choice, but

Why god Why!!

Subject: [sfraves] Samplers

Hi, 

 What is the best quality sampler one can get right now?

I was looking at the Roland sp555 but it was about a hundred dollars out
of the price range. What is the next best thing below the Roland sp 555?
And how many sample banks can I play at once if I am recording? I guess
I would need to be able to have songs that used at least 10 different
samples or channels per song. 

I am sorta new at this so any help is greatly appreciated. 


thanks 

xoxoxoxox

Subject: RE: [sfraves] why the scene is how it is and how we can change it

I like all of your points Peter and I agree with them. Hate to say it but
the rave culture has now become commercialized. Big name DJs think they are
all that and the true passion for creating music to spite the 'man' have all
died.

I believe this is why vinyl is fading as well. BPM is now closed and the
section that use to be dedicated all for EDM in Virgin is now mostly for
video games and they only have one wall for vinyl, which are mostly for
Timberlake/Paris Hilton wax....sucks!

This is why I support the underground movement and am part of the Moksha
Tribe. I want our rebirth to stimulate the true following of dance music,
the love, the respect and not to see how many people a promoter can shove
into a small space just to make a profit.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] why the scene is how it is and how we can change it


Not everyone's out to make a buck, and not every headlining DJ has a god co=
mplex - I think quite a few of us on this list know quite a few folks and c=
an attest to that.=20

But if you dig crap like Armin Van Tiesto Oaken-berg, you are buying into t=
he "top 10" commercial DJ sound/image, and you get what you pay for.=20

That's one reason I love SF - less of those kindsa of folks - we have peopl=
e like Garth & Jim Hopkins and Jeno & other names that have been doing it f=
or YEARS and don't sport that asshole 'tude.=20

Plus, I have seen more free events here than any other city I have lived in=
 or played in...if you all are experiencing that sort of crap, you need to =
change where you go, who you hang out with, or what clubs/Dj's/promoters yo=
u support....

I don't hate you.. i just feel really sorry for that you like had to
experience all thise yucky.. i mean... it sounds like you didn't try to
find the right crowd, the group, the right peoiple, the right setting...
you just went to where you thought was the only kinda rave you could find
& stayed with it 'til you got sick of it!  There's a whole world out there
of what you want & what you need... hang in there & wait for the next
Moksha party to come up... you'll see what the real deal it!!!  Try to
make it out 2 OtherWorld halloween or go to Tonal! :)

Subject: [sfraves] raves not retro

i had a discussion with a non raver/clubgoer just the other day and i 
was surprised to hear her say, "raves? what is this 1992?" and i 
realised that maybe we're too successful at being underground as a 
culture. but then i realized, 'hey wait, aren't clubs the most retro of 
all?' if anything, raves are a succession or transcendence of clubs. 
possibly the current trend is a step backward in our scene... where our 
music is being pigeonholed into clubs and deemed club music. the sound 
of which is only fit to be played at clubs.

sure i can agree that epic trance sounds awful in a small room or purely 
ridiculous.. and hard heavy schranz is only good for a dirty warehouse 
with a strobelight and a red flood light, but this current trend in our 
music will eventually change. maybe sway back to harder and heavier 
music possibly because clubs are the thing now. sort of a club revolt as 
in the origins of our scene.

take the techno trend for example. although i welcome the artistic and 
thoughtful directions of the current trends in techno.. i have to say 
there is definitely something to hard and pummeling excstatic awakenings 
that happen at a hard techno party. but if only producers would not lose 
the art for harder music i think we'd not have the trend of going all 
soft and minimal and clublike.

anyone else have seen this in their respective genres?

Preface: 
oh crap this reply was way-too-long...oh well....guess 
I should title it: "Quest impressions: according to Terry"

I'll speak a little on Quest (and stroke Eric's ego), since I've 
just got home and am winding down from Tonal last night (which 
kicked ass btw)...

I've worked with a lot of crews, from l33t UGs to mega-massives, 
Quest was one of the best series of massives in the late '90s. 
I'll be speaking from a behind-the-scenes perspective.

First the obvious, Quest was heavily and efficiently 
organized...A strong crew. Me coming into Quest from either a 
Feel-Good (small budgets/no attention-to-detail) and Harmony 
(scrappy, yet pinpoint attention-to-detail), it was refreshing 
and inspiring to work with Quest (killer budgets + pinpoint 
attention-to-detail)

A few examples of Quest's effort: mass produced props--as 
opposed to Harmony's individually crafted prop approach, 
Quest would still hand craft props but on a machined massive scale. They 
would also built BIG sets, like the life-sized elephants. Huge 
organic displays like floral arrangements from Passionflora/NYC, 
free fruit banquets integrated into the displays.

Eric/Quest, as opposed to other promoters, was always 
directing our efforts "over-our-shoulder", requesting effects, 
evaluating them, giving feedback, providing adequate back-up 
support. I think he had a team of contractors/Theater-geeks 
that were indispensible "rafter monkeys" in helping us put shit 
together. We learned a lot from working with them.

Their laser/lighting production was way over-complicated, but 
impressive. I seem to remember them boring through a 6' thick 
header beam at 85th/Baldwin to suspend lasers and/or sound. In 
the end it was always worth it as you'd see really original 
set-ups.

Quest drew a great crowd (at their biggest 12k?), from pretty 
humble beginnings they became a substantial equal to The 
Gathering massives in their hey-day.

There was also a Quest at the Brookdale Lodge, which was in my 
"domain" at the time, yet he ballzed-out a smaller party with 
uncontrollable debauchery. Harmony, Viberation(me), and Quest 
all threw parties at the place during that time. Eric's 
was probably the worst as controllable (Jen was pissed about 
that...tsk!!) But still a great party.

All-in-all, a lot of great memories, creative explosion, and 
aweesome execution. Thanks Quest.

(stroke your ego enough Eric???, hope the spider-bite's doing 
okay ;-)

It's the format of most clubs in SF that's the problem, not the fact that
it's a club per se (see Fabric in London and Watergate or Panorama in Berlin
as examples). The right combination of factors will bring together the best
of the "rave" experience and the legitimacy of a club...but not here, and
not quite yet.

There's very little transcendence that can be experienced from 10-2,
especially when most club nights don't get going till 11:30 - 12:00. How far
can you really go in two hours of clubbing? It ends up being more of a
social hour and the music can't really progress that far.

Longer nights is the key to a better scene, no matter what the music is.

Anyway, this is an old story...isn't it? And it has more to do with our
political culture than our ability as EDM. Friends from Japan and Berlin
were in town this weekend and we had a lot to talk about on this topic....

I'd love to see the days when we, too, could have parties that "didn't get
going till 2:00" and ended at Noon the next day.

The LA techno secene seem to be going in this direction. I'm sure it has to
do with more available spaces and the fact that it's, well....LA.

s of my imagination. Needless to say, I don't think I've ever been that hor=
ny on a dance floor in my life.

It even gets better, the costumes enhanced my visual experience more than a=
 death-star-laser-beam fired directly upon a happy hardcore dance floor. I'=
ve never had so much fun just looking at people! I must give a shout out to=
 the guy dressed as Nosferatu, I want to party with vampires every night I =
go out from now on. The girl in the droog outfit had me convinced that I wa=
s at the Korova milkbar with Alex, getting ready for some ultra-violence wh=
ile sipping on some milk-plus; not to mention, she convinced me that lady d=
roogs can be unbearably attractive (ultra-violence isn't just for the gents=
 anymore!). It sure as hell beats watching cracked out kandi kids massaging=
 each other in the middle of the dance floor.

And of course, we can't forget about the music. I'm not a house-head, but I=
 definitely got down to those funky, techy, electro beats! However, I don't=
 think I heard a single acid line that night; what a shame for the genre th=
at breed the term. Call me old-fashioned, but I think the TB-303 is the gre=
atest machine ever conceived; rumors say that it has induced sonic orgasms =
in several instances. Maybe I'm just too much of a psytrancer. Regardless, =
I got down proper to some groovy tunes.

My first party up here left an amazing first impression. Let's hope that it=
 just gets better from here. Now, if only Moontribe and droidbehavior came =
up with me, then it would be paradise...

I'm guessing this wouldn't get past the censors these days.

--

A terrorist is the product of our education that says that fantasy is not
real, that says aesthetics is just for artists, that says soul is only for
priests, imagination is trivial or dangerous and for crazies, and that  
reality,
what we must adapt to, is the external world, a world that is dead. A
terrorist is a result of this whole long process of wiping out the psyche.

- James Hillman, *Blue Fire*

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Party Review: Halloween

Hey wow I totally agree Nico.  Saturday night was one of those parties that rekindles your love for the music.  

I had originally been planning to lay low and not go out when Marco furnished me with the perfect excuse...he needed a ride.  So I ended up getting to the party way early and I stayed until around 3AM or so. I was still keeping it low key, since I knew I might have to leave unexpectedly.  My wife was very generously watching all the kids at home.

Marco opened the night with a sweet breaks set with MC Pupil on the mike.  This set really got going when Marco brought out the big bass and Pupil got flowing.  I especially enjoyed the mix with "Poppa Was a Rolling Stone" which is one of my favorite songs of all time from that era. Pupil is great BTW.

RAW/6BLOCC was the musical highlight for me...I've been digging dubstep for a while now, but this set (with an MC I didn't know and then MC Pupil again) was just totally rocking.  Wow, unquestionably the best dubstep mix I've ever heard even if there was one notable mixing glitch.  I need to get some dubstep records now I think.

Another highlight was Heather Heart's set upstairs.  I had seen Heather previously at the same venue before and I really enjoyed her style of trance.  I'm not a huge trance fan, but I've enjoyed both of Heather's sets which I've seen.  Later in the evening Heather came up and complimented me on my costume...<swoon> ;) Heather was dressed as a cheerleader and well if I wasn't married...just kidding, she was just super sweet.  Her friend Luna was beautiful also.

Since I hadn't really been planning to go, I was sort of tired when I got to the venue.  But the yummy breaks, dubstep, and trance got me moving even in my state of near exhaustion.  With a five month old at home, I haven't been sleeping that great for a few months now, but I was up and dancing at various points. 

I saw Marco of course (you Ok there dude?), Osby <hugz>, Redstickman, Agent Smith and his wife, ChuckG and his partner Paul, and I finally got to meet Chuck's GF Meagan.  I was super impressed with Meagan's presence Chuck.  You had better be nice to that girl!

Agent's Smith's wife takes the best costume award for her Dirty OBGYN outfit.  The gold speculum and 40oz made it!  Too funny.  I also liked whomever had the light up fish costume...wow that was pretty impressive.  Sorry I didn't get to meet you Nico, or did I?  I was dressed as Papa Gehde voodoo lord of death.

MBM came on right before I had to go, actually after I was supposed to go, so I didn't see nearly enough of Mr. Dangers, but what I did see was excellent.  I love MBM's projections which seem to compliment the music so well.

Another evening without much sleep well spent.

Can't wait for the next one!

Peace,

Peter

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: An amazing kids video.

If you want to watch some weird shit that is from a kid's show and isn't made as a joke for adults check out the kid's show Boohbah from the same woman that made Teletubbies.

I saw one episode of this where the Boohbah's play with a bubble machine that has an uncanny resemblance to a bong.

And of course in every episode they touch the sky...

Did you see the bubble machine aka bong episode by any chance?  I couldn't believe they left that in the show.

For the record: I once met the guy that played Floory, the floor, on Pee Wee's Playhouse.  A brush with fame...

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Party Review: Halloween


Yea, I really can't say enuff about R.A.W's sets (dubstep & d&b) - he reall=
y tore it the fuck up, and my MC (MC Pupil) even got to rock it out w/ him =
during his dubstep set. Forest Green brought it way harder and tighter than=
 I have heard her throw down in a long long while, and of course folks like=
 Heather Heart & Mutex brought the tasty 4x4 ruckus.=20

Meat Beat started off pretty good, but it was not my favorite set they ever=
 played - it got kind of way too spacey toward the middle of the set for my=
 taste.=20

One of the best parts of the night though, was Azeem & Zeph - these two guy=
s are just getting massive. Had the crowd rocking out proper.

Thanks to all who caught my set and paid me compliments - I sincerely appre=
ciate it!!!

Ah Mutex...yeah he was pretty good.  Enjoyed his set too.  

I forgot about Zeph and Azeem, some really great hip hop was played.  Right around that point I was lurking by the fountain of blood and severed baby arms.

I also forgot to mention the free CD someone gave me while I was hanging upstairs early in the evening.  Some glitchy techno from Ed Colmar.  I think Ed is channeling Nikola Tesla during parts of this CD.  Very enjoyable for the drive home!  Thanks to whomever gave it to me...was that Ed himself?  I think it was.

I've heard it through the grapevine that he's been creating some good

Ah Ed Colmar.. I have this great 2 tape mix set of his called Lies I got 
way back when. I think I kept them both because I love the graphic 
design so much. And the music is great too.

I keep wanting DJ's to start releasing mixtapes again. Some of my 
favorite mixes ever have been on mixtapes and I think it would be dope 
to go home from a party with a new mix you have to scrounge around the 
house looking for a walkman to listen to.

Tonal definitely rocked it. I got a group of friends to come
with me over from evilbreaks, including one who was skeptical
because of gingerbread (he'd been there before and thought it
was hard to fill up when a party happens there). Everybody
had a great time and were all glad they went. QBAM's set was
great, as usual. The people and the vibe were great.

Thanks again Andrew and Eric.

We had two mandatory parties to hit up in Stockton first. The first required me to dress like one of The Beatles, so I went with the black turtleneck from the white album. Check.

After the Beatles party @ the airport, Megan & I put on the orange jumpsuites & hit up Jeff's house in Stockton where my buddy Headcase was spinning. HC rocked it proper, and we grabbed Paul to head out to Otherworld. We jumped off the shuttle around 1:30, caught Osby just in time for a picture. Our boy J-Bar arrived around 2:30, and good times were had. Sorry I missed your set Marco; couldn't get there earlier. Glad we had a chance to say Hi anyways. 

Peter, always awesome to see you too man!!! Nice fit! I'm going to start going to work like that. Hope your better half took it easy on you, but I'm happy to vouch for you if need be, lol

MBM, always a good show. Didn't catch much more, because it was time to jump in the car & head to TONAL!!!!!

Arrived clad in the orange jumpsuit @ Tonal LITERALLY just in time for 4:20. Party still crackin!!! J-Bar & I found the other Josh and good times were had. Couldn't find Terry, but big up's to the visuals man. Guess I'll buy you a drink next round. Enjoyed Rooz' set. At least I think that was him upstairs.

Finally, I told my boy Josh there was a guy at the bar in a cowboy hat that looked like Bam. Joked with him that it was Bam's twin brother. Guess I was wrong. Sorry I didn't say hi to you either, but it was almost 5 and I was thirsty. 

Home & in bed around 7. Woke up late. Still rambling. . . Big up's to Andrew before I forget.

peace
CKG

Ah Ed Colmar.. I have this great 2 tape mix set of his called Lies I got 
way back when. I think I kept them both because I love the graphic 
design so much. And the music is great too.

I keep wanting DJ's to start releasing mixtapes again. Some of my 
favorite mixes ever have been on mixtapes and I think it would be dope 
to go home from a party with a new mix you have to scrounge around the 
house looking for a walkman to listen to.

Yea, I really can't say enuff about R.A.W's sets (dubstep & d&b) - he really tore it the fuck up, and my MC (MC Pupil) even got to rock it out w/ him during his dubstep set. Forest Green brought it way harder and tighter than I have heard her throw down in a long long while, and of course folks like Heather Heart & Mutex brought the tasty 4x4 ruckus. 

Meat Beat started off pretty good, but it was not my favorite set they ever played - it got kind of way too spacey toward the middle of the set for my taste. 

One of the best parts of the night though, was Azeem & Zeph - these two guys are just getting massive. Had the crowd rocking out proper.

Thanks to all who caught my set and paid me compliments - I sincerely appreciate it!!!

Subject: [sfraves] WR: Thursday Night: The real Birthday Bithday day night celebration

OK... so it was planned weeks ago, but a bunch of FnFers decided to go to
the SF Opera House for the show The Magic Flute... the night b4 i got the
perfect outfit ready, this black n gray stipped kinda zoot suit kinda
dealie, my grey DK shirt & this yummy grey tie w/ black & red blothes, &
my red converse...

Went to Berk to ride w/ Puddin', Rabbit, & Astra... we "Carpooled" to the
City (in the carpool lane 'cause it was B4 7PM still.. YAAAAY), got
parkin' right by City hall, then made this most fab walk to the Opera w/
yummy dressed people in a possee... it was Dope!! YAAAY

OK.. so here's the story in short (I'll try) from my POV... this traveler
dude from outta nowhere appears & a dragon is chasing him... he faints &
these 3 ladies show up & kill the dragon, & revive the travelor dude..
then this birdman, PapaGino, appears too playing this wooden harmonica & a
cage of birds he sells... the three ladies deliver a message to the
traveler dude from the Queen that her daughter needs to be saved from the
Evil King... so they arm the prince with a magic flyte to play when he's
in danger & he will be saved & they armed Papagino w/ this hang held
carosal thingie of bells (this of that light thing you hold in your hand
that spins & gives a light show, that thing from DisneyLand).. so somehow
the traveler dude & Papagino seperate... traveler dude ends up in a forest
where he plays the flute when all the wild animals appear & he starts
dancing with all of them & this like 3 foot tall parrot that has  red
converse shoes on like mine.. Papagino ends up in a dungeon w/ this grren
fat dude & sees the Princess... ok.. then there was alota back & forth w/
these gaurds, Papgino, the travelor dude, the evil king makes an
appearence w/ a village of peopl3 who worship him & hold on to his every
word that he's the coolest dude around yada yada & there's alota pyramid
climbing.. at one point, Papagino & the traveler dude couldn't talk 'cause
the gaurds told them not to & they will find the Loves of their lives...
Papagino finds Birdwoman Papagina then they have their own story line of
escaping the clutches of the Evil King.. & there's this whole thing about
the evil king sacrificing his people to a better life when they die.. then
he put the traveler dude & the pruncess on a test to see if they survive &
if they do, then they can live happily ever after.. so they walked through
a vulcano & survived, then they walked though the bottom of the sea &
survived ('cause the whole time, he played the magic flute & that
protected them)  It ended up being that the evil king was the good king &
the Queen was really evil... then the princess & the traveler due &
Papagino & Papagina & all the furry animals all lived happily ever after! 
The End

The whole thing was in German & there were screens that had subtittles to
what they were singing in German!  It was a good show.. but there were 2
solos i did fall asleep in 'cause ooh gosh... the story was just to fukced
up for me to like get.. Hello 2Day... i mean... yeah... I was confuzed,
but it was good & they sang really good!

After that i met up w/ an Austrailian Homie who was in town for a few
nights.. so that was fun!!!

Theni went to Compression!!  OK.. I know how I always said that
compression @ Beer Cellar was Dope esp after they remodeled.. but Hello
2day.. compression @ Temple in the Old Scool room... OOOH MY FUCKIN"
GOODNESS, OH MY GOSSH!!!!  So like DJs were Aye~N, Jamalcom, Sharpie, &
Ivry.. i thought it was a special surprise guest, but that was the week
b4.. so i just Grooved w/. all the Thursday Night Junglists that showed
up!  Afterwards... i was just gonna hang out in SOMA since it was on ly 2
hour wait 'til BART opened.. but Aye~N got pissed @ me for even thinking
about waiting in SOMA.. so he made sure i went to his house in Lower
Haight.. so me & Sharpie had this looooooong mondo talk about everything &
caught up w/ everything after Aye~N went to bed & we watched cartoons
too.. around 4:30, I left & went walking to the bus stop on haight
thinkin' i could catch the night owl.. b ut after like 15 minz, nada.. but
there wre hella buses passing by on the other street.. so i walked there &
asked this Crack Lady pretending to talk on a cell phone where the bus
was, & she told me to walk down to Market.. oooh.. Big G.. if you're
reading this... if you & lyds got awoken by singing outside your pad..
that was me 'casuse I was confuzed!  But 2 hours later, i made it home!!!

Subject: [sfraves] NYC Event Calendar

JC was looking for a NYC dubstep party this week so I hit up some friends in the city...

One friend pointed me to this board FYI: http://www.rhythmism.com/forum/calendar.php?c=1

Lots of house and techno, but no dubstep that I saw.  

Check this site  http://www.dqxt.org/dubwar/ for NYC dubstep in the future however.

Best,

Peter

After a monstrous capacity-rockin'2 year anniversary debut at Love
with the Glitch Mob, the Sub Swara posse comes back in November with a
night that touches all kinds of bass drenched territory. Hailing from
RONI SIZE'S legendary REPRAZENT & FULL CYCLE crews, DJ SUV (V
Recordings) will be Joining Sub Swara on the wheels with his trademark
spread of globally inflected organic junglist and dubstep
sensibilities. Also sharing the stage will be E.L.F (a frequent
collaborator with Tipper), straight from Maui, coming correct with his
melodically saturated bass weight that's been turning heads nationwide
throughout 2007. And as always, the Sub Swara crew will be rockin' the
live soundsystem proper. Nutshell: Sub Swara 023 Friday November 2,
2007 Love 179 Macdougal Street @ W. 8th 10 PM-6 AM $10 advance and on

Saturday, November 3rd, 2007

[ K O N T R O L ]

minimal techno + avant-house
every 1st Saturday @ The Endup


NET 28 SHOWCASE ft. from in Madrid, Spain:

<<< TADEO >>>

( Cyclical Tracks . CMYK Musik . Apnea . M=FApa )

Influenced by seminal techno artists like Plastikman and
Jeff Mills, Tadeo's productions fuse the early sound of
Detroit with tones of jazz and cutting-edge electronics.
His energetic DJ sets are the culmination of years of
experimentation and working the crowds at his own basement
techno events in Spain.  Don't miss what's sure to be a
slamming San Francisco debut!


and:

<<< DAMI=C1N SCHWARTZ >>> LIVE!

( Musica Charlista . M=FApa . CMYK Musik . Apnea )

With 5 years of production and 3 years of outstanding
releases on some of Spain's brightest techno labels to his
credit, it's no wonder why this 24-year-old Madrid native
is in high demand.  From his innovative solo projects to
his work as Musica Charlista with labelmate Alex Under,
Dami=E1n has consistently delivered his signature avant-garde
sound to ecstatic dancefloors across the globe.



plus special guests:

VADIM ( loft.n.space . LESS : NYC)

Last heard at the wicked Platform underground earlier this
year, NYC's minimal evangelist Vadim returns with another
foray into techno's darker corners and heavier rhythms:
throbbing, deep space music that will get you lost inside
your own head.


and:

SOLAR ( Bang The Box . Bionic : SF )

Sure, you know Solar from his years with the Sunset crew
and from rocking damn near every last party in town over
the past decade...but tonight he'll show he can still
surprise with a techy set crafted specially for KONTROL.


with [KONTROL] residents:

ALLAND BYALLO   ( Leibe*Detail . Nightlight Music )

NIKOLA BAYTALA   ( Robsoul . S.W.A.T. )

TADEO

Tadeo is influenced by various branches of electronic music,
especially by Detroit Techno and Cristian Vogel, Neil Landstrum,
Plastikman and Jeff Mills productions. In his first stage, he created
the collective Domestic Techno with DJ Slick, carrying out parties in
several clubs and basements of their city.

Throughout time he has tested almost every single style of electronic
dance music.  After a large period of techno investigation and
development, Tadeo runs his actual art collective Javha oriented to
all kinds of art expressions, and Cyclical Tracks, a conceptual techno
label. In this second stage, he purified his technique and studied
with care the connection with audience, trying to make this connection
the principal resource of his sets. Since then and little by little,
minimal and electronic sounds have started to become a natural rule
both in his sets and productions. He also has a predilection for dub
and sounds which emanate from Jamaican music. In May 2004 he released
his first 12" in his own label, Cyclical Tracks, and a remix for Alex
Under on CMYK002. In November 2004 he released Dub Infection
(APNEA002), featuring the techno-dub legend Paul St. Hilaire aka
Tikiman.

In June 2005 Tadeo released Lup! (CT-02): this time the music took a
step away from dub while his Detroit Techno influences were more
noticeable... dark and unstoppable dance, pure groove that impressed
artists like Magda, Troy Pierce, Luciano, Damian Lazarus, Marco
Carola, and countless others.  His innovative and dancefloor-friendly
tracks have appeared on mix compilations by techno heavy-hitters such
as Luciano, Loco Dice, Chris Liebing, Richie Hawtin and Tiefschwarz,
to name a few.

DAMI=C1N SCHWARTZ

At only 24 years of age, Dami=E1n Schwartz has already has logged 5
years producing electronic music, and 3 years releasing and working
with the Madrid platform Net 28, which includes the labels Apnea,
Bemysheep, CMYKmusik, Cyclical Tracks, Mupa and Pulpa. He joined Net
28 after meeting Alex Under, with whom he created the Musica Charlista
project. Dami=E1n is also responsible for the youngest record label of
the Net 28 family, M=FApa.

As a producer Dami=E1n inclines towards the avant-garde: developing
multiple musical concepts, turning his music into something original
and unique.  Surprise, jazz, harmony and melody are the common factors
in Dami=E1n=B4s solo productions, though never losing sight of the dance
floor.  The concept is the most important matter in his universe:
images, ideas and sensations giving shape to the concept, and the
music as the courier of that message, filling the space as the water
fills everything on its route.  Raw sequences, unique samples, strong
patterns, frantic rhythms, innovation, inspiration... Techno as you've
never really heard it.

VADIM

Vadim, originally from Moscow where he graduated from music school for
classical guitar, has been DJing and promoting electronic events in
NYC since 1999. His first DJ gigs were at underground parties in small
clubs and infamous outdoor "bridge" parties. Between 1999 and 2005 he
worked with Jason as SubtleChaos DJing and promoting parties around
NYC. Vadim and his new partner Igal are also known as "loft.n.space"
which is a concept that was born when a vacant factory loft in
Brooklyn has appeared as a perfect spot for a party. Since then,
loft.n.space has hosted latenight and afterhours events with
international DJs and live acts such as Dan Bell (Tresor), Zip & Sammy
Dee (Perlon), Alka_Rex (Supralinear, Resopal), Vince Lemieux (Musique
Risqu=E9e), and Pheek (Minus, Archipel).  Currently Vadim is a resident
at one of NYC's most respected weekly events - "LESS" @ Annex.

Yep, still alive :-) Was eating dinner in Milpitas at the time. 
All cell phones went dead for a little while, but data still 
worked on my phone.

Compared to Loma Prieta '89 and Northridge '94 (which I was both 
in the middle of), this was pretty weaksauce, which is probably 
a good thing.

umm, like, not to put to fine a point on it, such as, y'know, the whole 
damned point of Al Gore creating the Internets was/is that it's a 
decentralized communications system capable of withstanding *a full-on 
nuclear attack* and still keeping all of out Nation's Military 
Command\Control & Response structures in place.

The fact that the NebWets turned into the greatest single repository of 
human knowledge, since the Library of Alexandria, (and Sam Walton's 
wildest strip mall/big box store fantasy, wet dream), in the blink of an 
eye, was one of those unanticipated consequences that we hear so much about.

A couple of tectonic plates, miles below earth's surface, shrugging 
their shoulders and scratching an itch, for a moment, is no cause for 
alarm, the real threat of burning the thing down and having to start 
over, from scratch, is from within.

All you need is some idiot 15 year old kid out behind the barn, with a 
book of matches in the form of 20 lines of malicious virus code that can 
bring this bitch to its knees, and then you've got really something to 
worry about and keep you up night.

Speaking for nobody, I'd be much more concerned about that particular 
scenario, than some random and rare 5+ pointer, that shook up a few 
people, (that even took the time to bother to notice), before breakfast.

As always, ymmv.

PS: JC when you get to the Isle of Manhattan, gimme a call at 646 918 
3656 I've a friend in Williamsburgh that you might like 2 meet.

He's doing a modern day update of 1984 called "Winston's World" that

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Nice shake!

Actually the whole resilance to nuclear attack thing is pretty overblown depending on what you are talking about.  While it would be hard to bring down the entire global Internet, taking out a specific country is not hard and it has happened.  For example, the ruling junta in Myanmar shut down the Internet to control information flow during the recent protests there.  Another example would be the Russian hacker attacks on Estonia following the removal of a Soviet era war monument.

Here in the US, the Internet backbone consists in part of a number of Internet Exchange Points which connect the various ISPs allowing them to exchange data.  According to Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Exchange_Point) there are only 20-30 of these in the United States located in a similar number of cities. If these were taken out in their entirety some aspects of the public US Internet might still work, but I wouldn't count on it.

Peter

It would be pretty hard to take down the US's interweb... There are dozens
of colo's just standing by in case some of the AS routers fail/die... All an
ISP needs to do is login and change the static route and fixed... It happens
daily... 

Here is an active monitor that will show when the interweb is having a
problem... 

www.internethealthreport.com 

I rely on sites like these to track where problems, for my customers, are in
routing to us.

I think the majority of the public sees 'raves' as a thing for chitlins. A
kind of ecstasy and reach around back rub rite of passage. Kids discover it
at 17 and burn out by 19, or they hold out and become coked out clubheads by
22.
I seem to hear a lot of 'I used to go to raves, then I went to recovery'
stories from a certain generation that was 18 around the turn of the
millennium.

The problem is there are many kinds of ravers, who rave for many different
reasons. Clubs are legal and convenient. They are always there, they don't
get broken up at 2am when you're up to your shenanigans. There is no hunting
for map points. If you want to get f'd up and meet some hos, the club serves
both of those purposes with gusto.

If you start yammering at most dance music consumers about Temporary
Autonomous Zones and reclaiming space and spiritual experiences they will
politely excuse themselves and go find more drugs/hos/pleasant feelings. And
it's a phase for them anyway, like listening to Nirvana or swinging or World
of Warcraft.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="Windows-1252"

I just had a brain fart.

On my local list (dcraves) we have been discussing ways to create a new sty=
le of party that focus's on the patron rather then the superstar Dj (as it =
orginally was back in the early days of parties circa late 80's early 90's)=
. We had come to the conclusion that more then anything else, basic economi=
cs were getting in the way of doing this because of the need for headlining=
 DJ's to fill the party and thus having to put them on a pedastal (big name=
 on the flyer, all partygoers looking at the DJ idolizing, etc), which is r=
eally counterproductive to the orginal idea of rave in the first place. I m=
ean, honestly, when you break it down, DJ's play other people's music. Ther=
e is really no need for all this fawning on them lol.

This comic best illustrates this and how it has stagnated the scene
http://www.cyborganization.org/trance.jpg

So we thought it would be best to market the party with no Dj names on the =
flyers, Stick the Dj in some place that the crowd would not intentionally a=
ll be looking at him(hidden somewhere?) and concentrate the party funds tow=
ards atmosphere and doing whatever is needed to focus the party on the patr=
on and not the DJ. This still caused an issue due to the problem of having =
the big dj to pull the big numbers out to the party.






So the whole idea of creating and marketing a party without the use of
DJ's on the flyers and also making sure the crowd doesn't have the DJ
in view was widely accepted I think on this list. We could all agree that
this type of party would be "the" party that could change the current
status quo and perhaps create a new style of party.



My original argument stated economics was holding this back based on patron=
s only going to parties that had their favorite dj's



but





What if the promoter were to market the party with no DJ's on the flyer but=
 book a big name?=20

If said promoter did 3 or 4 of these, word of mouth alone would fill
his parties based on the "possibility" of any big name dj being there, even=
 though you never know what you would get.

Granted, the first couple parties would have to be in small locations
and then grow, however, if it was done correctly with the focus on the
enviroment then just the idea of suprise DJ's would excite people and
entice them to make sure they don't miss out, less they might miss a Dj
they have always wanted to hear. This would ultimatly allow the
promoter to truly experiment with new styles and have the freedom he
needs to push the envelope. one month he could have superstar dj
whoever then the next month unknown but badass new dj. And since the
party would be focused more on the individual party goer then the DJ,
He could focus his attention more on helping that aspect grow.



Thoughts?

You're just replacing one idol with a different one.
Some party promoter hoozball, for instance. Or some stupid celebrity.
I'd love to see CREWS get reputations, now.
In fact, I often go to certain crews' events no matter who is playing, even
if I only recognize one name and don't like him much, because I know the
event will have a certain vibe or an amazing location.
So. Pimp The Crew. :) Or, maybe, pimp the party. People go to Monster
Massive in LA every year no matter who is playing...

I guess it is on our end on the east coast.
We did do something along these lines though with the sleaze parties back i=
n 2000 when electroclash first came out and it did well based on the idea t=
hat you could only hear that style at our party, so it brought people out b=
ased on the idea rather then who was playing it. Either way though, I reall=
y feel as though the party scene in general tends to focus on Dj's rather t=
hen the patron itself whereas it didn't seem to do that in the early 90's.=

Again, it depends what you are talking about.  A nuclear attack on a single city wouldn't take down the entire US net, but global thermonuclear war probably would.  IMO.

Hello, BTW, nice to have a new poster around here.

It would be pretty hard to take down the US's interweb... There are dozens
of colo's just standing by in case some of the AS routers fail/die... All an
ISP needs to do is login and change the static route and fixed... It happens
daily... 

Here is an active monitor that will show when the interweb is having a
problem...

I rely on sites like these to track where problems, for my customers, are in

Actually the whole resilance to nuclear attack thing is pretty overblown
depending on what you are talking about.  While it would be hard to bring
down the entire global Internet, taking out a specific country is not hard
and it has happened.  For example, the ruling junta in Myanmar shut down the
Internet to control information flow during the recent protests there.
Another example would be the Russian hacker attacks on Estonia following the
removal of a Soviet era war monument.

Here in the US, the Internet backbone consists in part of a number of
Internet Exchange Points which connect the various ISPs allowing them to
exchange data.  According to Wikipedia
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Exchange_Point) there are only 20-30
of these in the United States located in a similar number of cities. If
these were taken out in their entirety some aspects of the public US
Internet might still work, but I wouldn't count on it.

Peter

Subject: [sfraves] Happy Halloween

Happy Halloween everybody!

Be safe no matter where you be...
I had a pretty exciting weekend what with OW and all, so I'm not 
entirely itching to go out. But, I think that if I do, I'm going to that 
big Cat Club/ Old Shadow lounge four room massive thingymajig. Sounds fun!

Anyways, keeping with the spirit of Halloween, I just finished 
Illustration/ Poster. Have a look. :)
