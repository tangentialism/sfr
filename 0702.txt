Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) QOD (Thu)

--

By perseverance and fortitude we have the prospect of a glorious
issue; by cowardice and submission, the sad choice of a variety of
evils- a ravaged country- a depopulated city- habitations without
safety, and slavery without hope- our homes turned into barracks and
bawdy-houses for Hessians, and a future race to provide for, whose
fathers we shall doubt of. Look on this picture and weep over it! and
if there yet remains one thoughtless wretch who believes it not, let
him suffer it unlamented.

- Thomas Paine, "American Crisis"

Wow that was some adventure! Things work out in strange ways

Osby Oi Oi Jamz <osby@viberation.com> wrote:  OK... so like the day after Chirstmas, I talk to Matt Downer on the
phone... he told me that he needed help like with his business yada yada
yada 'cause he "can't do eveything myself"... so I offered to work w/ him
& get his shit organized & stuff 'cause at the time, we were reeaaly good
friends & stuff! So we ended up talking that night for like 3 hours on
the phone, literally. Then he told me all the things, all the benifits i
woiuld get by working with him & all this money i would make working for
him & yada yada la la la! His promises even included him giving me my own
lap top & a condo for to stay at for free that he owned so i could finish
my Adult School Education & still work for him in SJ! Dope!

So the next morning, he picks me up in Hercules & brings me all the way to
Campbell to his "office" which is basically his garage. He had me change
in grubby clothes to start work. He told me to organize his garage while
he attended meetings all day. OK.. now you gotta understand, by organize,
he meant file like 20 boxes of reciepts, documents, papers, jounral
thingies, accounting books, & mislleaneous papers... then there were
products he stocked from all the companies he owned that needed to be put
somewhere, this messy ass desk, a computer that needed t be put together,
phones answered, and general housekeeping (dust, wash, windex, vacum, etc)
that needed to be done! So i slaved away that day and did what needed to
be done. He came home like around 8PM & he was impressed with my work! 
We then spent the next 2 hours putting things in storage in the backyard!

Oh yeah.. it was my 1st night of well.. an online class that I was suppose
to like get online & do whatever, but I forgot my sylabus for the class @
home or something & didn't have the proper log in info i needed to do that
class thing online that night.

He dropped me off @ the Cal Train station by his house & well.. after 2
hours of waiting & seeing like 3 Cal Trains zoom by, i was stuck! I
mean... it was still like holliday hours from xmas, & the trains stopped
running early. I mean, i seriously thought he picked me up from Hercules
that morning & it was just curtious on his part to bring me home after i
was done working for the day, then I'd do the commute thing starting the
next day. I mean... Matt didn't tell me he wasn't going to & it was
probably my bad just to assume. BUt i dunno... I mean... we he got back
from his like 10 hour Meeting whatever & kept saying "I'm sooo tired", i
guess he was planning on it, but well... I wouldn't even ask a tired
person to do a 200 mile back & forth drive just to bring me home. BUt
still.. ya know?

So funny enough, i didn't remember Matt's phone ### by heart & the paper i
had it written on was in Hercules & 411 didn't have it either! I also
didn't know anyone elses phone ### i could call in the South Bay cause
well... i just didn't have my list with me. So after a long while, i went
across the street to the Safeway Plaza & i dunno... i just figured it it
was more well lighted than the Cal Train Station & i could figure out what
i needed to do to be safe if i was gonna spend the next many hours by
myself.

So as soon as i got to Safeway, i just like stood there by the phone booth
& man, i was like heeeeeeella confuzed 'cause I was in this mondo pickle. 
But atleast I felt kinda safe. Then this dude like came up to me and like
asked me for change to make a phone call & I lied & said i only had enough
money for me to take the train in the morning when Cal Train opened up & i
was pretty stuck. Then he gave me this whole sob story about going to his
Sister's house in Redingin the morning, his Mom is the Hospital, his
grandmother, & calling his ex girlfriend's cousin who lived around the
corner. So after he was done venting, then i vented to him about my whole
day & how I was stuck & why i was where i was @ the moment. We kinda
talked for a while longer before he said that he'd like help me out & just
stay with me 'til Cal Train opened up since he was in the same predicament
as well!

Oh yeah.. this guy's name was Jack. I actaully called him Crack Head Jack
'cause well.. he told me how he was spun for 3 days & he was like coming
down hard which is why he was soooooo emotional. I mean.. i have a thing
about trusting strangers way to quick, but I dunno.. something about Jack
was sincere. So i ended up giving him money to make that call & actually
a few minutes later, we were hangin' out at his ex girlfirends's cousin's
pad. We were probably there for like an hour & 1/2 'til her parents got
home & we left!

While we were walking back to Safeway, he told me that it would probably
be better if we head downtown & kick it at some of the empty houses over
there. Well... it was his hood, so i figured he knew what he was talking
about! Anywaze, the next few hours we spent in downtown like going to
tacobell, walkin' around campus, & we actually hung out & slepton this
porch of this 1 abandoned house.

When daylight hit, we went to a donut shop & had coffee & donuts & had
like this loooooong ass goodbye.. I mean... we were reeeeeally close by
that point & practically knew almost everything about each other from
talkin' the whole night. It was Awesome, sad, but hella touching! He
told me that as soon he made it up to Redding, he was gonna call me! We
even planned on hangin' out again, i'd like do a day trip up to Redding &
stuff. But yeah, it took 3 hours, but i finally made it home.. Needless
to say, I didn't bother going back to work for Matt Downer, CEO again! Oh
yeah.. he called me that night & we kinda had a mondo bitch session at
each other.. lol.. Hello 2day.. we ain't spoken since then :) Hello 2day

Subject: [sfraves] Mac Video Capture...

So this is mostly a question for Terry, but anyone who
knows the answer or could help would be greatly
appreciated....

Here it is....

I would like to record video output from itunes when
it does the neet-o video-to-music screen stuff. Is
there a prog like audio-hijack for video to capture an
individual progs video output?

Grassy ass.

All, this is a trunk sale hosted by a friend of mine in SF. Please take the=
 time to check it out and spread the word if you like it. Make sure to tell=
 them where you heard about it. I get no kickbacks or anything just want to=
 see what forms of promo are working.=20

Brigadoon is a mythical (ok, mythical since it was invented
for a 1947 musical) Scottish town that only appears once
every hundred years... we're a little bit more dependable
than that. Don't let us pass like ships in the night; there
is too much in store for this weekend to miss out! Sail
yourself down to SoMa from 1-7 on Saturday for a chance to
see sculpture inspired by the sea, from three local artists
working in reclaimed materials. Hang out on the foredeck,
cocktail in hand, and soak in a little sitar-viola tag team
music. We are throwing caution to the wind and letting them
use an amplifier so please don't splash or we'll all go down
in flames. Let our masseuse swab *your* decks before you
unfurl your sails in style - we're of course bringing you
the best in recycled and reclaimed fashion and accessories.
When you are far out at sea you have to work with what
you've got, and while we don't have any clothes made of
rimey sailcloth (it chaps our bum) we've got damn near
everything else that used to be something else.

Featured at this event is our DIY clothing modification
station, bringing you free and at-cost clothing, patches,
and trims so that you can make the finest pirate pants your
little heart desires - but are too tongue-tied to articulate
to anyone else.

Bike parts revisited - there will be too many people working
in this medium to list them all. Rest assured that the
sheer number of innovative uses for old bike parts that we
will find and display for you will boggle your mind, and
stir even the hatin=92est heart.
Indie artists:
Alicia Bainbridge Escott
http://www.boombox.org/alicia
Working in expressive monochromatics recalling the kinetic
landscapes of Northwestern painter James Lavadour, Alicia=92s
pocket-sized paintings are made on polystyrene, or #6
plastic. This plastic is very common but not recyclable;
the work seeks to educate people about which plastics can
and cannot be recycled.
Rachel Lyra Hospodar
http://mediumreality.com
Bringing you a 1-6 punch, Rachel is showing a pair of
diptychs made just in time for Anon Salon's NYE Sea of
Dreams, as well as a sparkling fresh pair of undersea animal
sculptures made from reclaimed objects and an unhealthy
amount of glue.
Katie Sutherland
Marcus Guillard
This impressive large-scale work was also shown at the NYE
event. Take a moment out of the frenetic pace of talking
art and drinking sangria to lean your head back and
contemplate putting down roots, floating away, and taking
flight, all at once.

Edible Love - decadent microbusiness chocolate truffles from
our resident chocolatier are good for you on all levels.
Don=92t eat a whole box, though you=92ll be tempted. The
overdose will make it hard for you to enjoy our licensed
masseuse or live musicians.
Enjoyed the show last time but not sure if you can make it
this time around? Word of mouth is the most valuable
promotions we can get. Help us and your friends out by
hooking us up with each other! Please take a moment to
forward this email to any friends you think may be
interested in the show. You can also show them (or print
out for yourself) our flyer which contains a tiny map:

it's called "Snapz Pro"

http://www.ambrosiasw.com/utilities/snapzprox/


:)

Of course, there's also the lotek method of getting
the Apple DVI to Video adapter (
http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/61154000/wo/Vh3YLstyP9xe2P7rzcr1J1AeWGm/1.0.21.1.0.8.25.7.11.0.3
) and running your output to your DV camera, recording
it to tape, then logging the clips back into iMovie or
Final Cut via the typical method.  depending on your
needs, this might be a better option.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Mac Video Capture...

The itunes visualizer is actually an old version of the software G-force by Andy Omera. I think 55ware.com is still his website but I am sure you could google for it otherise.

You can download newer better versions of G-force that will work within iTunes or stand alone. Some of them have the ability to output to quicktime video files as well.

Finally if you like those visuals then you should certainly download the electric sheep screensaver, its not audio syncronized but the quality is amazing.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Renegade this friday (reminder)

that's what i was thinking.  depending on where it's located, it seems
to me to be very risky to set up the spot that soon after sundown and
to encourage people to start showing up while passer-bys (and cops)
could be rolling by.

esp with two areas of sound.

unfortunately, I'm already booked for this Friday.  There's no way I can
pass up Stanton Warriors at the Get Freaky party over at 1015 Folsom.

But, I hope it goes down proper anyway.  I don't understand what's up with
renegades (and raves in general) starting so early, I usually wouldn't plan

Anyone who guesses correctly about who the person being referred to

front of a vending machine together.  It's magic!

After a CBS News producer tole me in December (2000) that her network
decided to kill the voter-purge story (we'd fed our CBS our material),
we used one last desperate trick to get it picked up in the USA:  Gave
it to a fat guy with a chicken suit.

Altho I am a DJ purist at heart (prefer analog, ie vinyl), this is a really
cool way to digitally mix!

I love my Wii (got it on 12-28) and even found how to use the Wiimote on my
PC as a mouse or joystick:
http://www.homebrewhowto.com/wii-homebrew-and-hacks-news/wiimote-controls-wi
ndows-wii-hacking-101-epis.html

 I wonder how else the Wiimote will be customized, surgery anyone?

My tickets for Stanton make me be there by 11.. of course if that fails then 
perhaps a roll on over to the spot might be in effect!  Best of luck on the

unfortunately, I'm already booked for this Friday.  There's no way I can
pass up Stanton Warriors at the Get Freaky party over at 1015 Folsom.

But, I hope it goes down proper anyway.  I don't understand what's up with
renegades (and raves in general) starting so early, I usually wouldn't plan
on getting to an event before 11pm or midnight anyway.

DEREK PLASLAIKO

Some people filter through the record bins, taking what are on the wall or
record store employee suggestions. Then there are people who dig deeper into
the dusty crates, and absorb music like a sponge; ignoring labels, bucking
trends and are forever on a quest to find the perfect record. The ones that
make the staunchest of chin stroking, note taking trainspotters lose their
shit on the dancefloor, hanging on every record from one to the next.

Derek Plaslaiko unquestionably falls into the latter category. As a teen
equally transfixed by Mojo and Wizard cassettes and Minor Threat 7"s,
Plaslaiko followed the beats from his hometown 20 miles south of Detroit to
the epicenter of Detroit techno, then enjoying its third wave of success. He
quietly paid his dues on Detroit's rave circuit, and was a crucial piece of
the puzzle for the legendary Poorboy and Syst3m parties of the mid-nineties.
He quickly earned a reputation for forward thinking DJ sets that were
clinical, sophisticated and extremely sensual. This combination resulted in
a residency for Family, the weekly party at Detroit's legendary Motor.  With
a reputation for high energy sets that were versatile and tasteful,
Plaslaiko slowly became in demand on the Midwestern club circuit; sharing
the stage with such techno luminares as John Acquaviva, Kevin Saunderson,
Richardo Villalobos, Baby Ford, and Matthew Herbert. It was also during that
time Plaslaiko was asked by Carl Craig to perform at the inaugural edition
of the Detroit Electronic Music Festival.

In 2003, Plaslaiko became part of the original team of DJs at Detroit's
Untitled parties, sharing a residency with Tadd Mullinix (aka James T.
Cotton), Matthew Dear and Mike Servito. In 2004 he made the decision to head
east and set up camp in New York City, determined to bring a slice of the
Motor City to the Big Apple.  Currently, Derek is one of the resident DJs at
the Bunker (Subtonic) in NYC, as well as an integral part of the Wolf + Lamb
monthly parties. Most recently, he was honored in the Village Voice 2006's
"Best Of" poll as New York's Best Techno DJ.

TIM XAVIER

Tim Xavier made himself a household name for techno fans in the late 90s
with his innovative releases on Blueline, and since he has continued to push
the envelope with new sounds and ideas. His techno releases have been
consistent and solid, having signed work to major labels such as Default,
Advanced and PV. He has been featured on CD compilations by well known
techno artists such as Chris Liebing and Christian Wunsch, and his tracks
get repeated play by top names such as Luciano, Pan-Pot, Richie Hawtin,
Magda, Marco Carola, Troy Pierce and Adam Beyer.

More recently, he has expanded his talents and broadened his production
spectrum into the minimal genre, starting two new labels in 2005: LTD400 and
Klickhaus. LTD400 is his solo label featuring his own work, and the releases
have been featured on mix compilations by Ricardo Villalobos and Steve Bug.
His new project, Klickhaus, will feature his own production as well as other
artists. Tim has also collaborated with Tony Rohr as the Afternoon Coffee
Boys, their debut release on Clink selling out in days and continuously
demanding repress. Upcoming releases from them include a full EP on Cocoon
due out in February.

As if Tim isn't busy enough, he is also the owner and chief mastering
engineer at Manmade Mastering in Brooklyn, NY, where he cuts dubplates and
masters. His precise ear, attention to detail and demand for perfection have
created a devoted following with his clients. Somehow between producing,
running his labels and cutting records, he still finds time play
international gigs, sharing his sought-after sound with fans and dancefloors
alike.

PHILIP SHERBURNE

San Francisco critic Philip Sherburne has been heavily involved in the
electronic-music world for the past seven years, writing for publications
including the New York Times, Village Voice, Slate, XLR8R, URB, Wax Poetics,
Grooves, Nylon, RES, Neumu.net <http://neumu.net/> and many others --
including The Wire, where his "Critical Beats" column offers a monthly
roundup of experimental dance music. Philip has also written on sound art
and avant-garde practice for Frieze and Parkett, curated the companion CD

Tate Modern and the MUTEK festival. A book chapter on classical minimalism
and minimal techno is forthcoming in Christoph Cox and Daniel Warner's Audio
Culture: Readings in Modern Music (Continuum Press).  He is widely credited
as coining the name of the sub-genre "Microhouse" when writing for The Wire
in 2001.  As a DJ, Philip holds a residence at Barcelona's Raum Club,
formerly held a monthly event in San Francisco called "Soda", and has
performed in New York, Austin, Portland, Seattle, and Montreal.

THIS VIDEO, RECENTLY FOUND ON AN OLD COMPUTER, WAS
TAKEN FROM A LOCAL CABLE CHANNEL WHEN QUEST, A 25,000
PERSON EVENT WAS CANCELLED BY THE COUNTY OF SANTA
CLARA, CALIFORNIA IN JULY OF 2000. MANY OF THE DETAILS
IN THE REPORT ARE FALSE: 1) WE ARE NOT COOLWORLD! THEY
ARE SLEEZE-BAGS, AND IT IS HARD TO HEAR US CALLED
THAT. 2) WE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE EVENT THAT THE
NEWS REPORT STATES THERE WERE STABBINGS AT. IN FACT,
IT WAS LATER REPORTED THAT NO ONE WAS STABBED. 3)
COOLWORLD STOLE NNEARLY $100,000 FROM SILVER PEARL
RECORDS AND THE PUBLIC VIA TICKET SALES COLLECTED AND
FRAUD. THEY HAVE SINCE BEEN FOUND TO HAVE COMMITTED
CRIMINAL FRAUD AGAINST SILVER PEARL RECORDS, THE
PUBLIC AT LARGE, AND SEVERAL OTHER COMPANIES. 4) CIVIL
AND CRIMINAL CASES AGAINST COOLWORLD AND COOLWORLD'S
OWNER SASSON PARRY ARE ONGOING. 5) AFTER 6 YEARS OF
TRYING TO COLLECT THE MONEY THEY STOLE FROM SILVER
PEARL RECORDS, WE WERE FORCED TO DROP THE CASE SIMPLY
BECAUSE LEGAL FEES HAD SURPASSED ANY COLLECTABLE
ASSETS THEY HAVE/HAD.

NEVER FORGET THAT COOLWORLD'S INEPTNESS, FRAUDULENT
PRACTICES, AND BASIC TERRIBLE-NESS IS WHAT ENDED THE
GOOD-OLE-DAYS FOR RAVES IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Remember this?

There is a very technical yet fairly simple answer to
this...

1) Coolworld operated as a Corporation called CAN,
Inc.
2) CAN, inc failed to EVER pay taxes to the State of
California, and thus had their Corporate License
revoked in 1998.
3) Thhey continued to act as a Corporation. Thi in
itself in Criminal Fraud.
4) All contracts signed by CAN, Inc, including those
with the Santa Clara County Fairgrounds were null and
void, as CAN was not a Corporation, and therefore had
no right to enter into any legal or otherwise binding
agreements.
5) CAN, Inc knew they had their Corporate license
revoked, yet continued to operate under the moiker
CAN, Inc.
6) Sasson Parry, in a deposition to the County of
Santa Clara, stated that he knew the corporate license
had been revoked, and that the corporation was only
set up to disguise the fact that it was really a sole
proprietor business. Also Criminal Fraud.
7) Coolworld contracted with ticketmaster to receive
and administer all funds from ticket sales, and
distribute after their cut to the "sub-promoter." (Ask
Ron Reeser about this)
8) As crazy as this is, when we tried to rent the
Fairgrounds directly from the County, they told us we
HAD to suyb-lease through CAN, inc, as they had an
exclusive contract for any and all "all night dance
events." .... This is the craziest, because in theory,
CAN could not enter into any contracts, and thus I
should have been able to rent the Fairgrounds
directly. Unfortunately, CAN''s deceptive business
practice, and illegal behavior was not exposed un til
the discovery fase of our and other promoters
lawsuits.
9) We paid them $30000 DIRECTLY for the use of the
fairgrounds, and they never returned that money or the
money from ticket sales.

In essence, this whole affair brought so much public
attention on the Rave Scene, that no venue wanted to
get caught up in the legal BS, and thus... the end.

Thats about it... they are evil!

First of all, i'd like to thank Eric Spire for throwing my very first  party, 
Quest in late 1998, at the JJ Newberry store in Oakland (downstairs from  the 
Sweets Ballroom). The Quest parties were fantastic. Quest at Home Base was  
better than most other Home Base parties, and definitely a lot better than any  
Cool World party. Cool World sucked. When parties in general were really 
good,  sure, I had fun at some of their massives. But overall they had the big 
parties  that attracted the wrong crowd, and attracted way too many cops that 
were going  after this wrong crowd.
Cool World's later parties felt like giant sting operations. It felt like  
the raver kids were being offered up as bait to catch pill dealers. 
I've heard many times that Sasson has diplomatic immunity due to having a  
rich family from Iran. How much are people allowed to get away with if they have 
 immunity? It's not like we're buddy buddy with Iran. I feel bad seeing Quest 
 labeled a Cool World production, but I can see how the tv station would get  
confused.
Eric, I do miss your parties!

In fact, i was offered a deal by the county to let
Quest happen, if I would do the following:
1) Pay for an extra 100 cops to be on site ($150K
upfront)
2) interact with the Santa Clara Narcotics Task Force,
teaching them what to wear and how to act (they were
going to have a "jail" setup on site, and expected to
make 1000 arrests)
3) End the party at midnight without notice (ie:
create a riot)
4) Pay for DUI checkpoints at all points of egress
(exit) from the event (another $25K)

THIS WAS UNACCEPTABLE TO ME!!!! I would never allow
our friends and family to be set up like that.

Coolworld however did make these concessions at the
Cow Palace and Fresno County Fairgrounds... thus all
the hassles....

Most people doing parties now comply with the rules
above to some degree or another... Civic Center....

I think it is disgusting to put your audience under
this type of surveillance, tactics, and monitoring...

Thus, I no longer produce large-scale events :(

Let it be known far and wide that American Patriots will come
together in the year 2007, to unite the citizens and statesmen of the
Republic of the United States of America. They will gather with the
purpose of maintaining our nation's sovereignty, to reinstate our
Constitutional and Natural Rights, and to free the American people
from institutional servitude. They will come to pursue this course
with Honor, Dignity, and Courage, while acknowledging that unless God
keeps our nation and guides her steps, we will have labored in vain.

- Greg Evensen, The Patriot's Preamble

I find it incredibly amusing that it is *you* calling *him* a "troll".

All he does is post quotes.
You on the other hand go out of your way to discredit the source of =20
these quotes for an unknown reason, and usually in an entirely =20
illogical manner just begging for a response.
I suppose in that, because I do sometimes respond to you I admit that =20=

I fall victim to your superior trolling skills.

Do you know what an ad-hominem attack is?
You might want to read this short guide to critical thinking:
http://skepdic.com/refuge/ctlessons.html

"One of the more common fallacies of relevance is the ad hominem, an =20
attack on the one making the argument rather than an attack on the =20
argument. One of the most frequent types of ad hominem attack is to =20
attack the person's motives rather than his evidence."

With that, kindly STFU.

hi. welcome to the SF Raves mailing list!

how about some on-topic discussions, people?

and tony - IMHO, inspirational quotes are good.  cut it with the =20
gloom & doom gov'mint conspiracy crap.  it's old.  stick with the =20
classics and you can't go wrong.  here's one to get you started:

   "If you are irritated by every rub, how will you be polished?" - Rumi

carry on.

Yeah- "paranoid" is no way to live-
Fortunately the solution is rather simple :)
1) buy a couple guns and 20,000 rounds of ammunition
2) stop worrying
That way, whatever it is that you think is coming- foreign invasion,  
domestic riots, massive earthquakes etc- you can acknowledge the  
threat without having to live under its thumb every day.

I can start one of those:

SFRaves' usefulness has passed, and I suggest we allow it to die a  
graceful death.

My argument?
The social and discussion constructs provided by a "mailing list"  
were surpassed back when the first "forum" was created- we're talking  
5+ years ago.
These days, with the myspace/tribe/friendster kinds of sites, forums  
have likewise now been surpassed.
Any new dynamic people with an interest in "raves" in SF is not going  
to end up here.
The only active discussion seems to be from about the 20 same people,

I vote for retiring SFR now while simply past it's prime, before it  
needs to be put on a ventilator.
The archives will live on as the fond memories they are.
Thoughts?

Subject: [sfraves] tipping for water?

ok, I have a question for everyone here.  Do you
normally tip when you get a water bottle at a club? 
What do you think?  What's the proper etiquette?  And
how much?  Sometimes I tip, and sometimes I don't, or
maybe I tip on the first one but not the second, but a
bartender got all weird with me this weekend when I
didn't.  

I've been told not to tip because the bartender's not
doing much work, they're just grabbing a bottle of
water and making change.  Also, it's not like there
was a water fountain or any free water (or way to
bring my own water in) where I was, so there's that
issue, but of course that's up to the manager, not the
bartender.  

Any thoughts?

T.I.P. = To Insure Promptness?

How long did you wait for the water? Were you greeted with a smile? Did they twist the cap off for you & offer ice? I think it's important to tip anybody that actually does something to earn it. Even the water if they went the extra mile for you. If not, where's their etiquette?

I'm sure flame wars have been fought about this.

Consider this: a bartender makes the majority from
tips.  Sometimes those tips need to be split between
barbacks.

i can understand from the bartenders perspective, but from the
consumer perspective...why should you be tipping $1 for a bottle of
water that costs $0.10-0.30 for the club to purchase and may be
reselling at $3-4?

you raise some valid points, but speaking as someone who's worked in the
service industry for a long time (not anymore thank god), the generally
accepted etiquite is simple:

tip a dollar. every time. for pretty much any drink. if you like the
bartender, the drink was particularily laborious, or you want to thank them
for hooking you up or making a stiff drink, tip more.

it's really not about how much work they're doing, it's just standard
practice.  really pouring a beer isn't much work either.  opening a bottle
of wine doesnt take much effort, but if you buy a $50 bottle, you're still
expected to tip %15 or more on it when the tab comes.

in regards to being "forced" to buy water, most places at a minimum have
good old Hetchhetchy (sp?) tap water flowing from the sinks, which is the
same water that would be coming from a water fountain.
If money is an issue, you could always refill your bottle or wash out and
refill an empty glass.  Most afterhours bars aren't ever going to put up a
water fountain.  They want to sell waters!  But that doesn't mean you're
forced to buy them all night.

as often get quoted in the service industry, "if you can't afford to tip,
maybe you just can't afford to go out."

another thing that always confuses me is when people don't tip cuz they
think the drink costs too much.  the bartenders don't set the prices, so
don't take your frustrations with pricing policy out on them.

tip a dollar. it's only a dollar, but those dollars add up to those people's
livings.  and trust me they do work hard.

there's my .02

Subject: RE: [sfraves] tipping for water?

Tipping for water at a place where they are serving alcohol is a "no". They 
make plenty of $$ at the bar on liquor (something like 1000 % markup) - if 
they sell liquor, water should be a courtesy for designated drivers at the 
VERY least. If they ONLY sell water, then you tip for it.

And I was a bartender for years, so this isn't coming from left field.

Tips are ALWAYS split between barbacks - thye tend to get a 1/3rd (or less) 
of the tip-out. But despite that, water should be a courtesy, at least a cup 
of it. A bottle of water may warrant a small tip, but no more than a $1 at 
most, and that's moreso if they do open it for you, provide you with a cup 
for it, etc.

Since I just posted that exact sentiment, I thought I would explain it.

There is no justification for overly-expensive simple drinks.
And simple drinks is what I drink- Gin + Tonic usually.
No special ingredients, no complicated preparation...

In my mind there is a "fair" maximum price for these simple drinks  
when I go out.
For a well drink it's about $6- for a premium drink it's about $8.
When they're cheaper I generally tip $2, but only up to those values.

It's not like food at different restaurants- a Beefeater+Tonic is the  
same no matter which bar I go to.  If some place thinks it can charge  
$9 because of its "ambience" or whatever, it can fuck off- and yep-  
it's the bartender who is going to bear the wrath of no tip.
And I don't feel bad about that at all- because it's their choice to  
work at such a place.

Living Room Lounge -> $9 Beefeater+Tonic -> No discount for doubles - 
 > $72 for 4 strong drinks = NO TIP.
Las Vegas -> 8 12oz bottles of Corona -> $56 = WTMF?!?! NO TIP!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] tipping for water?

being in the industry as well, I Think Greg put it well.  There would be one 
exception...if you are at some UG party with no ventilation, its 130 degrees 
all they have is water bottles at 5$.  I think in that scenario, the h20 is 
an absolute neccessity on the promoters behalf to ensure no body falls ill.

but, keep you peeps behind the counter be nice if they are to you, be nice, 
if they suck and they cop attitude, fuck em, but fuck em appropriately.---
if you go to a restaurant and the tab is 100$ and you feel the service is 
poor, dont be a dick and just leave 3$.  You do have to realize that as a 
waiter/bartender they have to tip out several others in that biz as well.  
At my restaurant i tip out almost 40% of my tips to hosts, bartenders, 
server assistants, food runners...appropriately so.  A lot of people dont 
realize that.
If you get a bottle of water at a party, I think it is up to you, your 
experience with that person, if you have purchased lots and tipped that 
bartender lots before, it really can go either way.

I dont think a bartender would *expect a dollar tip on a dollar bottle of 
water, but it is a very nice gesture if you can afford it.

that is my 25 percent....

Subject: Re: [sfraves] tipping for water?

As someone who worked as a bartender, I can tell you, unless the bar-owner 
is a complete nazi, ALL bartenders have some wiggle room with drink pricing. 
A liter or Jim Beam (for example) costs the bar about $8 at most. They make 
about $5 per shot out of it. You get a SHIT TON of shots out of that liter. 
So unless the bartender is making each and every drink stiffer than 
fuck-all, they are making a shitload of money on each bottle.

Tipping should be commensurate with service. No matter how nice the place 
is, they are supposed to be providing you with a service, and most know that 
if they pour stiff, they get bigger tips. If they don't live by that credo, 
then they are money grubbing wankers. In that case, never tip more than $1 
per drink OR per round. If they are hooking you up though, always try and 
tip phat - the drinks will continue to stay stiff, and you'll most likely 
wind up with some free shots (at the least). The easiest way to insure you 
get stiff drinks from the get-go, is to tip heavy the 1st round and BE 
POLITE. Do not wave your $$ at the bartender no matter how busy they are and 
how bad you want the drink. If they ignore you completely, that's one thing 
-those people get stiffed on tips IMHO, but a bartender who takes care of 
you deserves to be taken care of. Nine times out of ten they will make sure 
you are well served if you hook them up on that crucial 1st round....

How about a $10 for a four ounce bottle of water at
PURE in Las vegas... and the bar tenders get fired if
you pour a glass of water and give it to someone for
free.

My Fiance works there.... she double stacks cups for
those that need water but also order a drink, and
tells them to go fill it in the bathroom!

No you're not- in either this instance or in general.  How quickly  
you forget your own words:
"Griffin, Devvy Kidd and Jeff Rense are deeply connected to the white  
power movement."
There is no purer example of an ad hominem attack.

This quote was the preamble for the article, and conveys an accurate- 
as-intentioned-by-the-author idea that stands entirely on it's own.   
There is no additional context to remove it from.

You read that entire article, and you thought it was mainly about  
detention camps?
It sounds like things need to be spelled out a little clearer for you:

I don't know how it can be made any clearer to you:

Person A makes claim X.
Person B makes an attack on person A.
Therefore A's claim is false.

The reason why an Ad Hominem (of any kind) is a fallacy is that the  
character, circumstances, or actions of a person do not (in most  
cases) have a bearing on the truth or falsity of the claim being made  
(or the quality of the argument being made).

I never tip for water - there's entirely too much profit made from 
the water.  I don't think it's punishing the barkeep at all - they're 
PAID, tips are EXTRA.  If they provided the water for free, then I'd 
tip / donate.

What evidence do you offer to support these claims?  In many cases, 
mailing lists provide useful information not found on forums.  I 
don't agree that forums have surpassed mailing lists, and social 
networking sites like myspace don't even come close to replacing / 
substituting for mailing lists.  If myspace was a better 
communication tool for Ravers in SF, SFR would truly be dead.  As 
such is not the case, new ravers in the area do join the list - case 
in point, Marc-O.

We're like the 'net ravers "crab people" these days ;-)

This list is everyone's, but I don't see the need to shut it off, nor do I 
see the need to move it to a fancy PHPBB setup.

Or do we?

I dunno, I don't mind being a crab person. If I want to come out I just 
fart around on bayraves or ravelinks.

If this list requires change though, I'm all ears.

C'mon deepfog/troll and others: lighten up! Having danced my ass off =20
at 'raves' all over the place since the late '80s, I hafta say that =20
this current DVD about the Detroit influence (Juan Atkins =3D =20

innovator) =20
is the best docu that I've seen on this phenom! Anyone else =20
experience it yet?

Will

Lodging in the world, the body is like a dream,
If one lives in peace, a day can be like a year.
Trying to sleep, I toss and turn on the worn out mat,
And pace around and around
In my tattered monk=E2=80=99s shawl.
The Master suggests I make my bed
Among the wind and bamboo,
And have a drink beside the waters of the rocky spring.
A nod of the head, and all worldly affairs seem wrong.
Laughing at myself,
I understand the wisdom of the Master.
=EF=BF=BC

Typos? Not at all! I just thought that if Tony were having his =20

others I added below. And while we're at it, let's include those =20
other early Santa Cruz raver guys:  Brother, Capricorn, Lorin, Lil =20
John, Cool Hand Luke (AKA Blue, then), and who else? Help me! We're =20
at least at the 15 year anniversary period now! Those parties you =20
first threw in that hat-box sized place on May Street around the =20
corner from where I lived on Dakota, and in the 'sweat box'  in =20
Harvey West Park in S.C. were CLASSICS, man! No?

Many times the mountains have
Turned from green to yellow
So much for the capricious earth!
Dust in your eyes,
The triple world is narrow;
Nothing on your mind,
Your chair is wide enough.

BTW, the extras "Talking Trash,' 'Drugs,' 'School of Tecno' and

music.

wait staff $2/hour under the assumption that they'll make wage once  
the tips are added in.  Bartenders and waiters here all make the same  
indexed-to-inflation automatically-increasing living wage that we  
voted into law a few years ago.  I think it's something a bit over $9/ 
hour as of this year.  Then tips are added on top of THAT.

I'm not entirely sure what stand to take.  I don't usually tip just  
to take a bottle of water out of the cooler and hand it to me, but I  
always do when it's a bottle of beer; which admittedly makes no sense  
at all when you stop and think about it.  It's just the ingrained  
habit to tip whenever alcohol's involved, regardless of the level or  
quality of service, I guess.

Nice!

I sent an email to SFR a few weeks ago asking if anyone saw this and no 
response. Good thing I waited to see it, now I don't have to be lame and 
watch it alone at my house.

It'll be like this one time, I saw Groove in the theater and everyone

I think the American people have traded freedom for addiction.
They're addicted to gadgetry and television and booze and drugs and
porn and fun times and NASCAR and everything else, and they're willing
to trade in their freedoms, but on the other hand, so many Americans
have no idea how these systems work, they take no interest, and of
course the mainstream media, which is, I call them the liars for hire,
they don't tell the American people the truth.

All bartenders I know makes MINIMUM WAGE.

Yes, Minimum.  The bars would pay them less if they could get away with 
it.  UG venues pay $0 to bartenders so they are on 100% tips only.

Here's another tip:  Want free water?  Tip heavy when you order your 
drinks, in fact, Give the bartender a $20 when you order your first beer as 
a tip.  You can stiff the rest all night.  I can guarentee you'll get a few 
free shots and bottles water later on.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] tipping for water?


Ok...  I've answered a few of these on this thread...  My favorite is "Over 
priced drinks"

Let's analize things for a minutes, since I work in this industry, actively:

PAYROLL:

Rule of thumb is that whatever the hourly wage for a staff member, the 
owner pays double for taxes, EDD, Workmans comp, etc etc.  So that Min wage 
worker costs $17/hr.   Let's say you have two bartenders and a 
barback.  $51/hr.

Got Security?  If you have Good security you're looking at $30/hr.  Let's 
say you have 3 guys.  $90/hr.

So, at $107/hr you have to sell 22 $5 drinks an hours just to pay staff.

UTILITIES:

Think that PG&E is free?  Oh hell no.  No clue what that costs but with 
club lights, DJ gear, not to mention that 10,000 watt sound system I 
imagine it's not pretty.

Got bathrooms?  Well then you gotta pay water and sewage.  Got an ice 
machine?  Oh ya...  this isn't free either.  Depending on usage, hours 
open, etc, it can get very costly.  Endup water bill in teh Carl years was 
over $5000/mo.  $60,000 a year just to have water at the club.

Garboge?  Oh ya, that ain't free either.  Gotta pay for the dumpster to get 
emptied at least once a week, maybe more.  Let's hope you sort and 
recycle.  Oh ya, that costs too.  Fortunatly you can usually get a latino 
witha  pickup to do it for you in exchange for teh recycleing 
money.  Probably talk them into sweeping the place too for the privilage fo 
sorting through club trash for those beer bottles and water bottles.

STOCK:

Yes, they get good rates, but they still have to pay.

RENT:  Does the bar own the building and property?  probably not.  Not many 
do.  Almost all of the are rented by the business owner.  That means you 
gotta pay your rent on top of everything.  One place I'm thinking of is a 
good $12,000/mo.  If you are open 3 days a week (thur-sat) you need to make 
$1000 on top of everything else, just for rent.

PERMITS:

Business licence, Alcohol Licence, Caberet licence, Live music permit, etc 
etc etc.  Those all add up to a large chunk of change.  Not sure now, but 
to have a DJ play CD's in the pre entertainment commision willie brown 
years was $15,000 a year.  I know there's a good 15-20 permits, licences, 
and such needed at a nightclub, and those fees are annual.

Tax?  Oh ya...  all those drinks, water bottles, and every time the 
bartender hits the till San Fran & the state of california are hitting you 
for sales tax.  Can't remember if they have an additional tax for 
resturaunts, but it's at least 8.5%.  So if they charge $5 for a cocktail 
they are only getting around $4.60 for that drink.

(Is anyone reminded of the Simpsons when they filmed the movie there?)


Summery....

If you have a REALLY good bar manager, you can get the cost down to 
28%.  That means that 28 cents on the dollar is paying for 
everything.  Most bars are in the 45-65% range.  I know one of the clubs 
I've worked with costs around $1500 a night just to unlock the door and 
staff it.  That means the bar need $1500 just to cover power and 
staff.  That's not getting into the permit factor.

Bars only make money on the bar.  Door is rarely bar, that goes to the 
promoter (if he's lucky).  If people are not spending at the bar, the bar 
isn't making money.

This is why your Long Island is $8.50

This is why you tip your bartender.

Everytime.

While your at it, tip the coatcheck too.  Those guys don't even get minimum 
wage, they are 100% tips.  However, most times your coatcheck fee goes 
straight to them.  I seen those guys work 8 hours and walk out with 
a  whopping $30.

I see you've been studying "Intellectual Defense for White Nationalists"  h=
ttp://www.nationalvanguard.org/story.php?id=3D6573=0AThe calling out of ad =
hominem attacks is a standard defense as you can see from the link. =0A=0AI=
 didn't think the article was "about" detention camps, I pointed out the bi=
t about detention camps as an example of an assertion made with out any fac=
tual basis.  If you study the article (which is about the predicted break u=
p of America) it is completely devoid of any facts.  It is all Mr. Evensen'=
s opinions about various things presented as if they were facts.  There are=
 no references, links or any evidence whatsoever offered for anything he sa=
ys in that article.  There is not a single piece of evidence offered about =
any of it.  Why? I guess the true believers already know its true right?=0A=
=0AThis is one of the standard tricks, making assertions without factual su=
pport of any sort.  Generally you want to start with something that is true=
, or almost true so the audience buys in.  Then you proceed to the bigger a=
nd bigger lies.  Once they've bought  to the initial "truth", they'll often=
 believe the lies too.  Evensen starts with the "Patriot's Preamble" to get=
 the buy in. Then he proceeds to argue that the nation is about to be swall=
owed in a revolution or civil war without even a single point of evidence e=
ver being presented.  (http://www.newswithviews.com/Evensen/greg8.htm)  Its=
 an old trick but it still works like a charm eh?=0A=0ASince no factual evi=
dence is presented which can be debated, any attack on the argument is imme=
diately discounted as mere baseless opinion.  Similarly questioning the cre=
dibility or expertise of an author is always called an ad hominem attack.  =
How does Evensen know about these supposed detention camps?  And if there i=
s a secret government conspiracy to incarcerate millions why hasn't he been=
 arrested or killed for exposing it?  These questions need to be answered b=
efore he has any credibility IMO.=0A=0AIf I even question his credibility b=
y merely pointing out that he holds other somewhat bizarre or nonsensical v=
iews, or is part of an organization that holds these views, I am accused of=
 an ad hominem attack.  Sorry it is up to Evensen to prove his credibility =
and present evidence for his assertions which of course he hasn't even atte=
mpted to do.  =0A=0AAs far as the links you've presented, I haven't finishe=
d reading the first article yet, but MacDonald is widely known.  I could go=

Subject: Re: [sfraves] (nrr) QOD (Mon)

I'm sure the list's patience has faded at the same rate as mine has,  
so I'm not going to respond to this- but I'll close with this thought:

It's a very useful skill in my opinion, being able to wade through a  
lot of shit but still pick up the gold nuggets.

Wholly dismissing pieces of work because you disagree with portions  
of them, or because you disagree with other works by the same author-  
in the end will only rob you of knowledge.

Examples abound- the Bible, the Qur'an- I personally view them as no  
evidence full of shit tales of fantasy.  But that doesn't mean that  
there aren't still important lessons to be pulled from them.

Similarly- it doesn't mean that someone who *does* believe in the  
Bible suddenly has "no credibility" about anything else with me.   
Jesse Lee Peterson and I disagree almost 100% in our views on  
religion, but I agree with a lot of his views on why the black  
community is in the shape it is today.
( http://www.bondinfo.org/ if you're interested )
Once you get past your "horror" at what ABC thinks about XYZ, only  
then can you really critically think about what ABC thinks about DEF.

10,000 rounds per gun, kept on hand at all times, for a SHTF scenario  
is what I was referring to.

Obviously you need to practice, and obviously you don't use any of  
that cached ammo without replacing it.

This is what I wrote:

I don't see this as a "claim" and more a simple fact- a forum just  
provides more of a social construct, and more discussion oriented  
tools than a mailing list can.
Searching, avatars, persistence of information- etc.
The specific social-network sites of course take that side beyond  
forums.
I'm not saying that SFR should "turn in to a forum" or anything.

But I dunno- even on Bayraves.com there's a thread about it becoming  
dead, and I look and there's still a post every minute or so-
8,000 users.
75 users posting in the last 15 minutes.
The SFR webpage has been broken and outdated for at least 5 years:  
http://hyperreal.org/raves/sf/

I dunno- it doesn't affect me either way, but I thought I'd raise the  
"pull the plug" thought and just see if it went anywhere.
Which it hasn't, so whatever.

Subject: [sfraves] sfraves relevence and calendar...

Why is everything broken? it all worked in1999 just
fine. Why not revert the calendar and features to the
way they were?

and....

Why not go php with a mailing list? meaning, have a
PHP based discussion board that also mailed out like
we currently do? This way you could subscribe as a php
discussion member or as an email member and post and
view as you personally desired... or for that matter,
you could sign up for both, like many forums allow.
The php forum software is readily available, seemingly
secure, and I imagine nearly effortless to admin...

things that make you go hmmmm..... (just showing my
age, which is officially out of the coveted 18 - 34
coveted demographic)

Subject: [sfraves] sfraves isn't dead (was Re: [sfraves] (nrr) QOD (Mon))

Using a web based tool to follow an email discussion or forum postings 
is an insanely inefficient method.  I suppose you read mail on hotmail 
instead of outlook express, or gmail instead of any of the crazy number 
of pop3 email clients?

That's true.  I've had many, many years experience with developing relationships with bartenders.  Yes, relationships.  When I go to a new club I focus on one person, usually the bartender who gets to me first...but my selection might be based on other things like attraction :-)  I tip heavily for the first round and fairly, generously from then on.

But it's not just the money.  I treat my bartenders with respect, as friends over time.  And the treatment is usually returned.  I've been dancing at clubs (as well as ugs) for over 20 years in this town.  I've known some bartenders all this time -- believe it.  I've received free drinks.  Actually more than I pay for.  Stiff, stiff drinks.  And generally free water. 

For personal health reasons I haven't been going out as much these days.  Went the End Up for the first time in years a few weeks ago.  Used to spin there and had some very wild nites in the early nineties at Decadence and Uranus.  In those days there was a punk dyke tender who always served us and poured danger level drinks.  Cause of much drama :-)  Well when we went back recently she was still there and our reunion was like that with the most cherished friends.  She IS a much-loved friend.

And that's my point.  Bartenders are people folks.  Make some friends.  Don't treat them like servants.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] sfraves relevence and calendar...

Eric, SFR has gone through a few iterations over the past 6-7 years, none 
that I could say were successful in the long run. Around '99-2000? we 
added member profiles. It kinda worked, some people used it for a while. I 
have no idea where that damn thing is anymore.

Then shortly after that we added this "package" dubbed star-raves. 
Someone from SFR developed it, can't remember exactly who (Colmar?).

It was essentially a turn-key calendar/events/member/profiles web-based 
suite. But it was developed using Zope's application framework, problem 
became, very few people were familiar with it. It was kinda useful for a 
few years, but eventually broke and died a horrible death and nobody ever 
came to it's rescue.

A part of me is bummed that collectively we have a pretty high IQ here, 
and enough designers and developers to shake a stick a stick at. 
Yet we can't maintain our own web site, or make it usable. Even though 
we're old crusty crab people, we could still have a pimp-home on the 'net, 
I would guess.

A lot of the problems came in people not following through (flaking), the 
rest of problems came in having people agree *what* to do (design by 
committee).

Another part of me just says leave what is there as a snapshot into a 
nostalgic past of the way the scene was.

One issue (as far as the list specifically) is I know Brian is particular 
about the security of the list, meaning, it's subscription based format 
keeps random people from googling us and reading our discussions. All the 
other hyperreal lists (to my knowledge) are ezmlm email-based lists. I 
particulary like being able to be candid on here, but I also like PHP 
forums when is comes to browsing threads when I feel like it.

I'm not opposed to a revamp, I doubt Brian is either. But everytime this 
comes up, a group comes together and nothing ever really happens in the 
end.

So it's up to you guys, if this is worth continuing discussing let's 
keep talking.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] sfraves relevence and calendar...

I hear you... the flakey factor prolly really sux...
but the free availabilty of PHP software for Apache
makes flakeyness and effort less of a problkem. I do
however like the no googling aspect, except that if I
ggole myself right now, half of the returns are from
SFRAVES back in the 90's.... So the idea that Brian
wants thjat kept out of the public eye has long-since
been f'd up.

Additionally, I do not want to be on a list that the
Patriot Act is going to flag... and Hyperreal v. 1995
would be that kind of site, as it provided detailed
reports on making illlicit substances in its Drug Info
Pages....

So yeah.... whatever... I donated money for new
hardware last year, so I think I at least get to vote
LOL

I'm not aware of such an animal. AFAIK, the bulletin boards
don't email you (or have the feature to do so) when messages
are posted to them.

eek! Anything that requires php[1] makes it easier to compromise
a system. sfraves probably isn't a high security environment
where we'd really care (clean up after compromise is always
annoying, but it's not like we have proprietary data we're
trying to protect), so this doesn't mean we shouldn't use
it. It just means that we shouldn't use security as a reason
to use it, since it will increase the vulnerability[1] of the
system hosting the php based bulletin board.

[1] lots more reading for anyone interested here:

Eric you're exaggerating, I checked ;-)

Your only SFR returns from google are from the calendar, which were posted 
as .txt files. All list discussions are gzipped before they are posted to 
the archives.

silly.

I agree with some of this post actually, especially with respect to finding=

Subject: Re: [sfraves] tipping for water?


As I was reading I was thinking of Debbie Greene.  She's been bartending at 
The Endup since it first opened in 1972.  Best bartender in the South of 
Market.  Hands down.

Something else peopel seem to forget on this thread...

You pay the BAR for your drink, you pay your BARTENDER to make it.

I mean, if you have a really great dinner, you tip teh waiter really 
well.  Why?  They didn't make it.  They walked 30 feet and dropped it on 
your table.  The Chef made it.  Do you tip him?  (I have, I've walked back 
to a kitchen and dropped cash in the guys pocket for amazing food, 
typically sushi)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] tipping for water?

The following is true, I SWEAR...

The cocktail waitresses at the big clubs in town, not
the casino floor ones, make well over $1000 per
shift... although they are nearly required to flirt
with and entertain their Table Service guests, as well
as go out and promote on their nights off. Basically
these women have a 5 day a week job, 3 in the club, 2
promoting, and usually make about $4000 / week. YES,
THAT IS $16,000 a month to pour drinks at tables and
make dorky men feel as though they have a chance with
the waitress...

It is obviously a coveted job... but I do not know how
they sleep with themselves at night... or during the
day I guess... As you might imagine, many of them
perform "other" duties to get the positions, and are
often asked by upper management to go out with the
high-rollers after their shifts. I'm not saying
they're hookers... but they are often asked to at
least kinda act like they are.... I can't imagine
trading in my soul for the money. Not to mention the
fact that as soon as they get a few years older, their
"careers" are over. They actually have weigh-ins for
them!!!!! ... and just about the only thing thhey are
allowed to take time off for is cosmetic surgery,
which they are "encouraged" to have in order to get
and/or keep their jobs.

It's gross!

and for the record.... just in case you thought my
Fiance is one of these women... she most certainly is
not! She is a hard working bartender, which is a
different "class" of employee. Not only is she a
college graduate, she owns two homes, is getting her
masters degree, and only has to work 2 nights a week
to keep herself afloat. She is one of the few ppeople
using the ridiculous money service workers make in
this town to better herself.... most just blow it on
purses...lol

Subject: Re: [sfraves] tipping for water?



Well Eric, it is Vegas... what did we expect?  Seems par for the city.

If you are laying down a grand for table/bottle service, you better have a hot
waitress flirting with you.

There are tens of thousands of strippers who have to go through much worse.
At least the high-end waitresses keep their clothes on.

they are advertising $3 martinis and fernet shots, so that's a good start... well, the martinis are at least. you're only allowed to drink fernet if you're in the service industry. it's like the secret handshake of the server/bartender club in this town ;)

I guess I see it differently.
Any tip I give is for service.
Both at a bar, and a restaurant.

Your bar analogy is right on.
Did the bartender address me in the proper order for when I got there?
Did he/she make the drink correctly and in the right proportions?
Does my glass have some crap on it that they didn't notice?
Is my change returned as promptly as can be expected?
That is the "service" involved there- and all of it determines what  
tip I give.

At a restaurant it's no different- I'm paying the price of the dish  
for the chef's abilities.
I don't know why you think it would be different at a restaurant.
The tip is for the service from the waiter.
Did my bread arrive promptly?
Is my plate and silverware clean?
Do you have knowledgeable opinions on the food, specials, and wine  
selections?
Do you keep an eye on the table to see if anything is getting low?
Etc etc.

Maybe I'm a weirdo here...

Google isn't really an issue.  I think voluntarily maintaining a more complex system is an issue, it's not really hard to filter email and scan for "BSP:"  I sort of prefer an email list to a website.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] tipping for water?

Yes Im in vegas...

And yes, the service woorkers union is powerful on
SOME properties. Wynn, The Venetian, and several
others are Union Free....

and... The high-end clubs sign at-will contracts with
their employees, allowing them to hire and fire on a
whim. Many properties that do have union support get
aruond it in the clubs by hiring "models" to serve
drinks... which means your a bartender or cocktail
waitress who is required to maintain a certain
appearance.

Most of the casino floor servers/bartenders are under
the service workers union, but those jobs are mostly
for the 40+ yr old peeps, and all men in general. I
only know of maybe 4-6 men who have bartending jobs in
clubs, and there are no cocktail waiters.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] tipping for water?


I'm thinking that if somebody held you to the criteria you seem to hold 
others, you'd be quite offended.

Its' a fucking drink.  There's a signifigant statitsical percentage that 
with increase quantiy he likelihood of droppage.  Also, setting it down and 
forgetting about it.

As for the food, do you tip the same at Mels as you do as some places 
charging $25 for a chirp cocktail?  Do that waiter work any harder?

Bartender == Chef
Barback == Waiter

That's the parellel.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] tipping for water?

I don't go out to drink.  It's not economical, and I'm poor.  Not 
because I burn my money, but because I too am not paid well.  If I'm 
at a club, it's to see musical talent.

UG Venues shouldn't HAVE bars to begin with.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] (nrr) QOD (Mon)

are you talking about taking aim, with sights, and firing, or just 
wildly shooting from the hip?

I've prolly shot less than 500 rounds in my LIFE, but I can hit 
reasonably close to target with proper aim.  I'm talking about 
shooting a rifle, from a stationary mount, at a stationary target.

Ok, let me break this down:

Just because you state it, doesn't make it fact.

That's why I asked for evidence.  I see no evidence that forums 
surpass mailing lists.

Further, I see no evidence that TV surpasses newspaper.  They're 
different ways of conveying information.

As far as it's production / mastering. . . All I used was a live to tape
recording in Audacity. No mastering, just mixing.

It's programmed heavily, I went through at least 20-30 versions before I got
this one and decided it was finished. Other than that there's not much to
tell, two turntables, a mixer, some headphones, a big stack of vinyl, and a
lot of work is all that went into this. :-)

I think you forgot what the thread is about, actually - water!

No mixing, preparing, nothing.  Just hand me a bottle.  I'm paying 
the bar over 6,000 % profit for the water.  No tip!

Ok, I understand that, and I'll leave NS to respond.

Ok, I've read this four times, and I can't make sense out of it.  I 
also can't seem to correlate it to NS's response.

Personally, I tip based on service.  If the service at Mel's is on 
par with the service at Il Fornaio, the tip rate will be the same.

Whether or not the wait staff works as hard is as much a function of 
restaurant design as anything else.

>Bartender == Chef
>Barback == Waiter

WTF is a barback?  There's bartenders, who serve drinks, and there's 
a bar manager.

A chef prepares dishes, and the wait staff deliver them.

A bar manager does not make drinks for the bartenders to deliver.

In Predator, they fire a Vulcan / Gattling gun from the hip.. but 
then, that's exactly the kind of weapon I'd /want/ to shoot from the hip!

Honestly, I've never measured distance from mount to target.  Most 
definitely less than 100 yards.  Next time I go to a range I'll be 
sure and ask.

Google isn't really an issue.  I think voluntarily maintaining a more complex system is an issue, it's not really hard to filter email and scan for "BSP:"  I sort of prefer an email list to a website.

For reference, the Predator thing is entirely fake-

It's a GE .308- normally mounted in helicopter doors.
The recoil from that gun would put you on your ass almost instantly,  
and any amount of power that you could pack-carry for it would be  
depleted just as quick.
(gatling guns requiring an external power source to spin em)

And dangrsmind- i'm not quite sure what scenario you're planning for-

We don't live in deer country here- in an apocalyptic scenario my  
priorities are hunting and defense.  And the only things I'm going to  
be hunting are squirrels, pigeons, dogs, cats, and the occasional  
raccoon and opossum.
Engagement ranges for this kind of hunting or for defense are almost  
always going to be <25yds- which is why I've focused on the 12ga  
shotgun.
There is nothing more capable at this range for either hunting or  
defense, and if need be I can always drop a slug in and reach out and  
touch someone.

you're buying a bottle of water for $2-3?

The drunker you get, the more likely you are to spill or walk off and 
forget about that drink that you are being so overly critical of.

Right.   So a 15% dinner at Mels would be around $2 and a expenice place a 
tip would rack $20 or more.  So are you saying that you would leave a $2 
top at teh expenive place if both places server very well or would you give 
somebody at mels $20 for great service?

This is my point.  You'll give minimum 15% to a guy that carries a plate 20 
feet and balk at giving a bartender a dollar.

Bar back:   Preps the bar, stocks the bar, clean the bar, washes the 
glasses, cleans the tables, the floor, the bathrooms, and sweeps the place.

Bar managers set prices and handle staffing.  The do not wash glasses.

A barback is the person who keeps the ice bin full, beer stocked,
and gets new bottles of liquer as needed.  This person often times
will clear empties.  From time to time they will serve a drink if
the bartender went out for a smoke or if things are really backed
up.

the barback is like the bartenders bitch... and
without them, your drinnk would be a warm beer, a jack
and coke sans ice, or simply anything out of the gun.
They are prolly the most important part of keeping any
bar running smooth, and definitely the sweatiest
pperson on staff.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] tipping for water?

I'll take both sides of the arguement here.

1) They can.  Supply and demand.  Same reason why water
is $2.00 from vending machines at rest stops.

2) So on the high end its about $0.30/bottle -- wholesale.
This does not consider cost to cool the bottles, storage,
and labor.  And bars don't stay open by selling beverages
at or below cost.

Only a fraction of the money for the water goes into the
person's pocket who served it to you.  The latter is
counting on people to tip so they can earn an income.

You dismiss expectations.
Do I expect that waiters at Mels will ask to contain my bag/coat for  
me should they see it placed next to me?  As well as my companions'?
Do I expect that they will consult me in my wine selection?
Do I expect that they will bring me examples of said wine to aid in  
my decision?
Do I expect that they will bring me complimentary hor'deurves while  
the main course is being figured out?

No.

I'f I'm paying $40 for a steak, there comes along with that an  
expected level of service.
If I'm paying $7.99 for the steak, then my expectations are thus  
appropriately set.

Your point I fear, is lost among the ether.

ya..  I mean, let's do some more math...

Bartender pours one drink an hour.  They're making $8.65 per drink.  woo!

Bartender knocks out 180 drinks an hour.  Now they're getting paid $.05 per 
drink by the house!

If a bartener can move 180 drinks an hour, they are a rockstar, since 
that's 1 drink every 20 seconds, and that has to include stopping to play 
register jockey.  (I also grabbed that number to make the math easy and 
make a point)

If they get $1 a drink, they just made $180/hr.  The bar paid them $8.65.

Now...  Bottom line...

It takes a bartender just as much time, energy, and effort, to serve a 
bottle of beer, as it does a bottle of water.  Nobody has argued against 
giving a tip for a bottle of beer, but you're squacking about a bottle of 
water.

Point is...

The Waiter doesn't set the prices or make up the menu, and in both cases, 
they work equally as hard.

some good discussions going on here today, and i want to comment on  
some of them ... i'm away from my desk so to speak, working on webmail  
so it's a pain to thread through my email but let me suffice it to say  
we all might be closer on our viewpoints than you all might think.

oh fer fuck's sake, this could go on for days.

tip a goddamn dollar a drink people. it's as simple as that.

if you don't, look in the mirror, you're a cheap bastard.

3 beers, 3 dollars.

it's standard etiquette and the price of going out. if you can't afford it,
don't go out (or at least don't buy drinks.)

yeah, yeah, whine all you want, you're still a cheap bastard.

TV is nothing mor ethan the headlines of Newspaper articles.  If you're 
lucky, you get the first paragraph.  That's about it.

NPR is basically someone sitting and reading you a newspaper.

Anyone interested about marksmanship should read the book "92 confirmed kills"

If you hate war, just read the first chapter or two, however the entire 
book is VERY good.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] NRR - Fernet Branca - SF is top Consumer LOL

Okay.. I should learn to answer my own questions -  Wikopedia says:

Widely popular in Argentina, it is often mistaken as a national beverage. 
The most common preparation is with Coca-Cola. To make a Fernet and Coke, 
use a tall glass filled with ice (tubo), then pour the Fernet up to 2/3 of 
the glass, top off with Coke. Serve with the can of Coke and a straw. More 
recently, it has become very popular in San Francisco, which now consumes 
more Fernet per capita than any other locale in the world.[1]

It's nasty...it's like Jaeger, only without any of the syrupy yumminess that 
Jaeger has. And it's apparently used in some brands of Absinthe (although 
not the really good kinds methinks).

Subject: Re: [sfraves] And now for something completely rave related...

Great story.. e has been a notable savior for so many I know.. comepletely 
changed the balance of what it meant to get high into something - 
meaningful.  I love the end of that story:  Better living through chemistry. 
  That;s what mom used to say.. I just don't think she quite meant it that 
way :)

[My son? He is 19 now, and in his spare time - having some months ago kicked 
the Ecstasy habit himself - he spins mixes at raves, and this fall he is 
entering college, quite a reputable college, as a psychology major. And he 
is writing poetry again. More brilliant than ever. Minor triumphs, perhaps. 
Still, it does make one wonder. Would he have made it back intact without E? 
Would he have arrived at that which all of us deserve and so few manage to 
find, his chance for happiness? And it makes one wonder, too, about what 
they say: better living through chemistry.]

As they stirred Heaven and Earth, they combined to one,
and everything was everyone and each one was all.
As they stirred I heard a trumpet call,
and everything was everyone and each one was all.

hahaha

even wikipedia knows of this town's odd obsession with fernet... awesome.
i have no idea what the connection is, but it's very real. it's supposed to be a digestive aid, so the idea is that you drink fernet after a meal. however, in san francisco if you order fernet, it basically says to the people behind the bar, "attention please! i am a server, bartender, etc. please give me the industry hookup." strange indeed. 

i'm also curious to know what it is about san francisco particularly that encourages so many fernet whores. if anyone finds out, please share with the class!

love,
mo

this might be the sf weekly article mentioned earlier:

even wikipedia knows of this town's odd obsession with fernet... awesome.
i have no idea what the connection is, but it's very real. it's supposed to be a digestive aid, so the idea is that you drink fernet after a meal. however, in san francisco if you order fernet, it basically says to the people behind the bar, "attention please! i am a server, bartender, etc. please give me the industry hookup." strange indeed. 

i'm also curious to know what it is about san francisco particularly that encourages so many fernet whores. if anyone finds out, please share with the class!

love,
mo

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR - Fernet Branca - SF is top Consumer LOL

I grew up in San Francisco, as did my parents and grandparents from  
Italy, before moving on to other parts  of northern Cali. It's the  
drink my grandpa Penna always drank a shot of when he said things  
didn't feel right in his stomach, and he lived to his 90s. It's been  
a big hit in the City for generations, especially among families  
originally from Europe. More recently, in newage health circles,  
especially those knowing the Asian five elements, the bitter element  
as found in Fernet Branca is known also to settle the digestive  
system when the other four can't or are out of balance. Later yet-- 
around the late '80s or so--it came into popularity in clubs  
worldwide on the heels of other bitters, notably Jagermeister, and  
its makers even came up with Fernet Branca Menta--which IMNSHO is  
ghastly! Until the late '70s or so, Fernet Branca's label still  
listed the herbal ingredients.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] (nrr) QOD (Tue)

now.  here's what i think about this.  she's got a right to her  
opinion, but she definitely goes overboard on clinging to her  
personal interpretation of what the bible says about homosexuality.   
and you probably won't any time soon see a quote of the day that  
promotes this.

the argument i think she started off trying to make, which is the  
same one michael savage makes, is the mainstream media focuses too  
much on gays.  and quite honestly i can see a little bit of that, but  
then it just goes off the deep end for me.

and savage shouldn't even talk because apparently he wrote a book in  
the 60's about running off to tropical islands to have sex with men.   
and here he is today pushing his garbage agenda, and also doing other  
stuff, like promoting carpet bombing of fallujah, when we were  
actually secretly doing just that.  a total new world order lapdog,  
if you ask me.

so anyway, point noted with kidd.  i otherwise find some of the  
things she says about Americans needing to turn off the TV, lose some  
weight, get more educated about their system of government, etc. to  
be useful and helpful, something i don't see michael savage doing at  
all.

Raw opium as found in bitter yucky tasting poppy tea will also cure stomach,
pain, toothache, cramps, muscle spasms, and head problems, unfortunately it
is illegal, although it seems to cause less health and social problems then
alcohol. Blah. Legalize it.

I need to try this Fernet, but first I would like to explore (real) Absinth
some more.

Subject: [sfraves] need a dome for the playa?

i like to give myself design projects every so often to keep myself  
occupied.

recently, i gave myself the task of designing a shelter that is  
relatively inexpensive to make, packs/stores/ships flat, is easy and  
quick to assemble & disassemble, is comprised of modular parts, is  
completely compost-able/biodegradable and made from recycled and non- 
toxic materials. it should also stand up to high winds and wet  
weather - basically, i wanted it ALL.

my intent was to create a design that could be used as disaster  
relief shelter. of course in meeting all the requirements, the end  
result ended up being the ultimate tree-hugger playa shelter.

a couple quickie JPEGs of the design are here:
http://www.flickr.com/photos/44124395037@N01/sets/72157594523625639/

the footprint is roughly 15 ft x 19 ft., and it has 240 sq ft of  
enclosed floor space!
packed for transporting, the overall dimensions are 4 ft x 8 ft x 3  
ft, with no odd shapes or protrusions - just like a box from Ikea
total weight is about 60 lbs. - your rebar stakes alone will probably  
weigh this much!

needless to say, i'm pretty excited about this.

the next step is to make one or two to test, and find some human  
guinea pigs who wanna do some camping. I figure the best way to go  
about this is to find someone who wants one, have them purchase the  
materials, and i'll make it. i'd buy the materials myself, but the  
cash is kinda tight right now with the new house and all.

i'm waiting to hear back from a few local suppliers to get an idea of  
the cost of the materials, but it shouldn't be much - i'm guessing,  
and this is only a guess - that the material for the panels will cost  
roughly $150 total, plus maybe $20 or so for fastener hardware.

so... the question again is:  need a dome for the playa?  email or  
give me a call. :-)

I like the Czech absinth personally. Very strong, but the taste may not 
be for everyone. Make sure to pick up one of their sports packs -- 
"Special Absinth offier" if you decide to go through with it. Very good 
content. There is also a large community in SF that makes their own.

terry i wouldn't be too hard on ourselves.  from what i've seen, web  
tools are hard to produce, and when no one's getting paid for it,  
it's usually one maybe two people doing the work.

and to maybe add to your mention of security, which, when i think  
about it, i agree with, i think there's a bit of anonymity on the  
list that is kind of nice when you compare it to say tribe or  
myspace.  i'd say about half the regulars here i've met and some of  
the others i can guess ... like peter's probably 45 with 2 kids and  
jewish ... =]

anyway i appreciate some of the intelligent discussions that happen  
here.  i used to be totally against message boards and i still prefer  
the pop3 mail client world over web based solutions, but if the  
profiles came back at some point in the future it might be fun.  like  
i said though i think it's fine the way it is now.

HHonestly I see too much of people putting too much important on non 
related issues.  As soon as somebody says something, nobody is talking 
about tehy're they saying, immediately all things about them, or unrelated 
issues are brought up.

This is done by both sides, and honestly, i'm really fucking sick of it.

Argueing that somebody's opinion is invalid, or whatever they are saying 
isn't worth listening to becaus ethey disagree with homosexuality is as 
logical as somebody who refuses to listen to what somebody says JUST 
because they are a homosexual.

Anyone else agree?

Will you disagree when I say I'm tired of homosexuality being a rallying 
cry for all issues?  Homosexuals are no more rightious than anyone 
else?  The idea that I don't hold Homosexuals in high regard just becaus 
ethey are a homosexual?

See....   Apply what I call the Shatter test..   Exchange words in a 
statement and see if it matters.  When reading things, interchange the word 
homosexual with the word hetrosexual.  If the entire meaning is lost, then 
guess what, it was irrelevent in the first place. If the statement makes 
sense, or remains unoffensive, then it's applicable.

Cause honestly, anti-hetrosexuals are as funny as anti-homosexuals.


The bottom line, the integrity of our nations, culture, borders, and what 
have you, has as much to do with sexual preference as what brand of tires 
you have on your car.  Seperate issues.

this is an interesting test, i'll have to try that out sometime.

the mainstream liar media loves to promote wedge issues like gay  
marriage, abortion, etc., things that may have some importance but  
they focus on it and it does a great job of dividing people and keeps  
them from focusing on really important issues.  'nuff said from me  
for now.

Subject: [sfraves] From Eddy: NEW COMPANY POLICY FOR NEW EMPLOYEES EFFECTIVE 01/01/07

Hi Willie~

Stupidly, from my old friend Stash! However, I rather like the last
one.  Kind of goes along with the fat rant you [Will] sent out the
other day.  I, by the way, am sick of really fat people squashing
down into a MUNI seat next to me, when they really need two, or
better yet they can simply stand unless the bus is not crowded.  Eddy

NEW COMPANY POLICY FOR NEW EMPLOYEES EFFECTIVE 01/01/07

Dress Code

It is advised that you come to work dressed according to your   
salary.  If we
see you wearing Prada shoes and carrying a Gucci bag, we assume you are
doing well financially and therefore do not need a raise. If you dress
poorly, you need to learn to manage your money better, so that you  
may buy  nicer
clothes, and therefore you do not need a raise. If you dress just
right, youare right where you need to be and therefore you do not  
need a  raise.

Sick Days

We will no longer accept a doctor's statement as proof of sickness.
If you are able to go to the doctor , you are able to come to work.

Personal Days

Each employee will receive 104 personal days a year. They are called
Saturday & Sunday.

Bereavement Leave

This is no excuse for missing work. There is nothing you can do for dead
friends, relatives or co-workers. Every effort should be made to have
non-employees attend to the arrangements. In rare cases where employee
involvement is necessary, the funeral should be scheduled in the  
late  afternoon. We
will be glad to allow you to work through your lunch hour and
subsequently leave one hour early.

Toilet Use

Entirely too much time is being spent in the toilet. There is now a
strict three-minute time limit in the stalls. At the end of three  
minutes,
an alarm will sound, the toilet paper roll will retract, the stall  
door will
open, and a picture will be taken. After your second offence, your  
picture
will be posted on the company bulletin board under the "Chronic  
Offenders
Category". Anyone caught smiling in the picture will be sanctioned  
under the
company's mental health policy.

Lunch Break

Skinny people get 30 minutes for lunch, as they need to eat more, so
that they can look healthy. Normal size people get 15 minutes for  
lunch to
get a balanced meal to maintain their average figure. Chubby people  
get 5
minutes for lunch, because that's all the time needed to drink a Slim- 
Fast.
___________________________________
Thank you for your loyalty to our company.  We are here
to provide a positive employment experience.

Calls for violence typically, and most times rightfully, negates a 
standpoint.  Its' just a shame when somebody who proports those actions 
says something that's decent, but then it makes me wonder if it isn't a 
political ploy in the first place, like getting the KKK to support 
something you want to see over thrown.

well actually, politburo pete, the democrats are coming to your  
rescue this quarter and will pass hate speech legislation, so that  
will make hate speech illegal.  and then we'll be able to sue each  
other.  i can't wait!

and thanks for reminding me about michael savage, i'll make it a  
point to listen to him, and jeff rense tomorrow evening.  see how i  
operate?  every time you open that mouth of yours and say don't do  
something that's right where i will go.  anyone else you 'don't' want  
me to waste my time with?

used in his last election, you have a much better chance of getting  
an honest recount.  And they say they can't make the American voting  
machines do that.  Guess where the ones in Venezuela are made?

Florida.  Ha ha!

Subject: [sfraves] Anna and .....

I know this makes me a bad person.... 

But...

The story says that Seminole tribal EMt's, security,
and later FLorida EMT's all tried to give her CPR....
Was that necessary, or was everyone just trying to get
the very last piece of A.N. Smith ass that they could?

Seminoile elder leader yells to rescuers, "Get the
Shaman, maybe he can put his life stick in her and
bring her back!"

Going to hell.

When I go to Ruby Skye, I park at 5th and Mission[1] because it's
inexpensive. I then walk over to Ruby Skye[2] (staying on Mason, unlike
the route depicted on the map).

There are several closer garages (one of which is Downtown Center
Garage[3]), but they're quite expensive because of the theatre district.
I've also seen them full several times.

I saw D:FUSE at Ruby Skye a while ago and it was good show.
Have a good time!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] DFUSE sat. @ ruby skye

for he most part, parking sucks around ruby skye but, the way i do it, 
is if i dont find parking by going through all the nearby streets once 
then i park at the parking garage that is at the next block down from 
ruby skye which the rate will always beat a $35 parking ticket  and or 
tow on the street.

With all of noise about QOD this past week on sfr, well, dammit, I guess 
I missed the the important BSPs for this weekend. I know there's lots 
going on, what with Carl Craig playing at mezzanine. Is that what 
everyone is up to? Well dammit, what about under the radar?

Hit me with your best BSP.

carl craig @ mezzanine is probably where I'll be.  But I'd be interested to
hear what else is out there as well.

ps, what exactly does BSP stand for?  I can infer from context what it means
but I've never seen the term defined before.

With all of noise about QOD this past week on sfr, well, dammit, I guess 
I missed the the important BSPs for this weekend. I know there's lots 
going on, what with Carl Craig playing at mezzanine. Is that what 
everyone is up to? Well dammit, what about under the radar?

Hit me with your best BSP.

Subject: [sfraves] James Kim Memorial and Celebration 2/17/07 (Re: [sfraves] Hit me

One week away for this one. But some of you have known James Kim. Should 
be lots of CF/FnFer's in attendance...

Babus
A Memorial and Celebration of James Kim's Life

Saturday, February 17th, 2007
1:00pm: Memorial
2:00pm - Sunset: Celebration
Location: Golden Gate Park Memorial Bandshell and Music Concourse

The family and friends of James Kim would like to extend a warm
invitation to join us in celebrating and remembering James's life.
This outdoor gathering serves to remind us of the deep ties that
bring us together, and honors James's appreciation for his family,
friends, and community.

This will be a family event -- bring your kids, bring a picnic, and
bring warm clothes. We will be celebrating with DJs, music,
and dancing until sunset.

In addition, we are proud to announce and unveil The James Kim
Technology Foundation. The purpose of the fund is to benefit technology
programs in public schools. Donations to the foundation will be
appreciated.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Hit me with your best BSP

Dreamteam this year gets a big ol' *YAWN* from me.

Farina & Miggs are a given, and I like Mancub, but I dun no that ANY of the 
folks on that list are worthy of the "top 10" title.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Hit me with your best BSP

I guess if you're into the whole burner vibe he's ok - but he has never 
impressed me. Not enough to rank in a top 10 list anyway....or anywhere 
close to one.

My top 10 to see (albeit not all SF dj's) ranks like (in no order):

1. Garth
2. DJ Brian
3. Danny Tenaglia
4. Z-Trip
5. Myagi
6. Koma & Bones
7. Mark Farina
8. Derrick Carter
9. John Aquaviva
10. LTJ Bukem

with honorable mentions going to:

Makoto
Andy C
Atomic Hooligan
Josh The Funky 1
John Tejada
Little Louie Vega
Jeff Mills
and a rack of others.

But locally - I'd say there are a few on that list that shoulda been on that 
top 10:

Greg J
Garth (again)
Jeno
Ripple
DJ M
Andres Octavio

and I'm sure there's more.

oh well if we're compiling a top 10 including non-SF DJ's then he's nowhere
close.  And top 10 really depends on, that I've never seen before, or just
in general.

the white power thing was a joke.  more later on that, but you knew  
that already.  stop that!

as far as immigration to venezuela, no.   but what is on the table is  
the deepfog version of the motorcycle diairies, me and osby are going  
to drive fog-gti (sorry i didn't tell you about this before osby  
you've been nominated) from san francisco to cape horn.  is that the  
one at the tip of south america?

now i emailed this gentleman that so kindly put his email address in  
there at the post gazette, he neglected to put the bill number in his  
writing.  these are nice thoughts but for all we know this could be  
another no child's behind left type of bill or the "help america  
vote" act.

The sponcering website (Nitevibe?) picks their list then there's online 
voteing.

Very democratic.  I never see Mubali anywhere on the list, or Mitch for 
that matter.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Hit me with your best BSP

ah comon' it is voting by the people for the people - where's your faith in 
democracy?  It's not like the use electronic voting machines or anything.. 
er.. oh wait.. nevermind!

I always felt the poll was biased on apathy.. it is a perfect model for the 
rest of our nation and mirrors the hipocracy in the system.  Only the people 
that care enough for their personal following vote.. and they never seem to 
publish their findings so it is always very suspect to me.

I don't understand how Farina personally stays on the list in a town bent on 
breaks, techno, and bootybass (I love that term).

Leave it to be said.. I am taking this one off.. besides  the fact they lost 
the venue to 1015 ewww.. Ruby sky must be sucking it up these days.. I know 
I haven't been in ages!  Long live Shine and Mezzanine!

Can you order Fernet anywhere, like any other cocktail?
  is it true, that itll keep you awake, or is it just a hardcore liquer like moonshine or something? =)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR - Fernet Branca - SF is top Consumer LOL

I find that most bars around this city have it. It has no "wake me up" 
properties that I am aware of...it's basically like Jaegermeister, sans 
Anise flavoring. More "herbal" tasting. Kind of like if Ricola cough drops 
were made into liquid and got ya drunk. lol

(but I think it tastes worse than Ricola)

I thought that "Shake That A$$" at Arrow was Seraphim Dleush and 
friends...didn't see Forest's name on the lineup last time I checked.

I hope they can do something with that place, I saw Greg J & Kool Karlo 
there a few months back and it sucked massive donkey balls.

I decided on going to Mint tonite and then to see Carl Craig at the Mez 
later this evening. Will probably take it easy for the rest of the 
weekend after that.

So if that jives with your plans, well, then, I'll see ya there!

Berry berry interesting!


Not sure I'll make it to MINT, but I hope it works out for you all there - 
that place seems like a hard spot to get people into (hard to find/not 
really in a location that sees heavy foot traffic). But it IS a nice spot, 
and you guys are well worth it.

sometimes knowing of each other but more often not.  Socrates and  
Jesus, Lao Tzu and Tolstoi, Gandhi and Martin Buber -- no one can  
find in their lives and words a jot of support for a political and  
economic regime that encourages the acquisition of wealth far beyond  
what is needed for the necessaries -- or even the restorative  
pleasures -- of life while consigning the masses to live and work in  
squalor."

Wow- it sounds like they just rolled past and kicked him right out  
the door mafia-style without even stopping:

According to Springer, the patient was brought to the hospital  
Wednesday about 10 p.m. by Los Angeles Fire Department paramedics.

The man was admitted and evaluated by medical staff, who determined  
he was in satisfactory condition to be released, Springer said. The  
patient was taken by ambulance to the home address he had listed in  
his admission form -- which turned out to be the Midnight Mission,  
which did not have a vacancy, Springer said.

He was then returned to the hospital in the ambulance, was provided a  
wheelchair in the emergency room lobby and was asked to wait for a  
clinical social worker who could help him, according to Springer.

At about 8 a.m. Thursday, after a new shift of emergency room  
staffers had come to work, the man told nurses he wanted to go home  
and they called a van to transport him, according to the hospital.

``He was taken to the address a second time and he instructed the  
driver to open the door and let him out at a local park,'' according  
to the hospital's statement. ``He assured the driver his wheelchair  
was at his home and he could propel himself to his home from the  
park. When the driver opened the door, he propelled himself to the  
sidewalk and waved the driver away.''

those hospitals don't exist any more.  they were state run.  I hate 
to rain on your conspiracy parade, but it really is all about money.

very sad indeed.  I wonder if it happens a lot outside of LA?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR - Fernet Branca - SF is top Consumer LOL

so i had my first taste of fernet last night at the Ambient Mafia
happy hour.  mixed with coke on the rocks.

the first few sips were....interesting.  i made strange, grimmacing
faces.  i stared at the glass and pondered many things.

by the time i finished it, i think i'd grown accustomed to the flavor.
 i think it will take several more times before i can finish a glass
and not think about it.

so i had my first taste of fernet last night at the Ambient Mafia
happy hour.  mixed with coke on the rocks.

the first few sips were....interesting.  i made strange, grimmacing
faces.  i stared at the glass and pondered many things.

by the time i finished it, i think i'd grown accustomed to the flavor.
i think it will take several more times before i can finish a glass
and not think about it.

as a teen in the early90's, i volunteer every winter & summers at frontline in skidrow...

this case that i just read isnt the first nor the last...

even LAPD did the same thing they dump off homeless somewhere on skid row...more like relocating them to another area...because they didnt want to bother with it...it's very sad...as a kid it bummed me out because i couldnt do more than what i was already doing....you hear so many stories from each person that ends up in skid row...it literally breaks your heart...

shelters are full everyday....

people from all walks of nature end up there...i know cause i was there & was  homeless for 4 months in 2001...

you get turned away from shelters when they reach their max...even in the rain and even with kids...

i know some homeless go to the hospitals late at night so they can have a warm place to sleep...

but their is many who are hurt, sick or have real bad mental issues who are dumped back to skid row because they have no health insurance...

anywho...i dont like our government...our state is crap...
anyone remember the movie demolition man....the homeless & rebellions lived underground...i could see that happening...maybe not now but in the future..

*sighs*

Subject: Re: [sfraves] homeless dumping

Conspiracy, or not, the net result is the same.

It's home grown, All American, served up with hot dogs, apple pie and a 
smile, genocide, man.

We the people of the United States of America are running a slo-mo, slow 
burn, version of what happened in Germany society in the late 1920s 
early 1930s.
(Feel free to call "Godwin" on this thread....... now.)

Back then men in the position of the guy in this article were called 
"useless eaters" and they were methodically removed from German society.

http://www.regent.edu/acad/schedu/uselesseaters/

Then they moved up the food chain and took care of the infirm, 
alcoholic, drug addicted, free spirited, (AKA Gypsies, the American 
parallel to them are us ravers and anyone with a piercing or 
non-military tattoo), elderly, and so on, and so forth, until they ran 
out of them, and then went to work on the Jewish people.

Even though we're not aware of it, we're totally running the same 
playbook here in the USA today.

90% of the mentally ill people that then President Ronald Reagan dumped 
on the street in the mid 1980's are no longer with us.

They didn't go back to their families and they didn't go back into the 
hospitals, since they were never re-opened, which means that, oh they're 
dead.

Which places Reagan right in between Adolph Hitler and Pol Pot in the 
'how many of your own people can you kill category.'

For this we've named at least one airport after him and lord knows how 
many schools and Post Offices.

The question that needs to be asked now is 'who have they got next in 
their sights for elimination'?

My money is on old people before they go after the likes of me,
(though if Ghouliani wins the Presidential election in '08, then that 
will be a then be a 50-50 proposition).

Why on earth do you think it is that Medicare Plan D is so confusing to
elderly people?

Don't you think the smartest minds in the world that dream that kind of 
shit up could have made that as simple as possible?

Or is this "Golden Age of Information Processing" that we're allegedly 
living in just so much bullshit PR?

Can't be both, can it?

On purpose, or not, a statistically meaningful percentage of our elderly 
will die because they couldn't fill out a form properly.

This won't be readily apparent, but over time, say the next decade, this 
will happen, but it will happen in a decentralized way that won't make 
its way into the papers, so you'll never hear about it, except when it 
happens to your family or the family of a friend.

Nobody will know, or care, that this is happening because it'll be old 
people it's happening to.

Right now what's happening is for those that are insured, or have 
assets, they're being kept alive so they can be bled dry.

A friend was recently in a local hospital for a minor injury that they 
received at home and in the next bed was a 92 year old woman that was 
receiving a battery of tests.

What's that all about, do you think?

Extending her full and happy life, or adding to the hospital's bottom line?

Happy Trails, campers and I"ll see you all in New New Orleans.

I'd Rather Be A Matin' Than A Hatin' ~ Me

"Now, 75 years later in an abundant society where people have
laptops,cellphones, iPods and minds like empty rooms, I still plod
along with books." ~ Harper Lee, 2006

"There aren't a lot of things in this world that one can be sure
of, but I do know this; anytime you go by a House of Worship, of any
size, and of any denomination, that's filled to its rafters with
people, you can be certain that the vast majority of those people
haven't actually taken the time out to read The Bible, or whatever
ancient, "Sacred Text" that they subscribe to, because if they had read
it, and comprehended it, then that House of Worship would be nearly
empty." ~Nyc Alberts, NYC, October, 2006

"Ha ha!  Ever had the feeling you've been cheated?" ~ J. Lydon, SF, 1978

Subject: Re: [sfraves] homeless dumping

pretty much everything you said here i agree with, except i was  
talking about ronald reagan decimating the california psychiatric  
hospital system when he was governor of california back in the what,  
1960's.  this is the kind of stuff my grandmother used to tell me and  
that was one of the reasons she hated reagan.  but anyway, i suppose  
that's just apples and oranges, the homeless problem is here and  
that's probably why.

now as far as conspiracy goes, we can thank peter for injecting that  
into this conversation.  and thank you, EMTALA is the one that i was  
trying to think of.  i want to keep this on the topic as much as  
possible for my contribution, all i'm saying is illegal aliens and  
the pro-groups use this act to make sure hospitals treat them, you  
have taxi drivers in mexico driving across the border to drop off  
patients in san diego hospitals, but on the other hand we have this  
homeless dumping going on.  that's specifically the inequality i'm  
talking about that is almost surely engineered to some degree,  
otherwise you'd see stories of illegal alien dumping too.

sure it's about economics, but that's not the point.  no one should  
be denied care if they're that sick.  and what makes anyone think  
there will be any kind of fair investigation into this?  i know i've  
definitely heard stories of homeless dumping before in the news, and  
never ever hear anything more about it.

anyone thought of contacting the hospital directly to ask them WTF?    
a presbyterian hospital huh.  i sure as HELL wouldn't want to spend  
any of my money there if these allegations are true.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Some cool mods for the computer geeks

About 5 years ago one of the Ops Geeks at work showed up with a MB that 
he just bought that had a 2 gig flash memory BIOS installed.

When I asked him why he said he was going to drop the entire Linux 
kernel into it and when I asked why about that he said it's going to 
turn it into an instant on box with no boot times.

Ever since then I've wanted to do that myself.

Turns out somebody already has:
http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-51784544344753709
http://techreport.com/reviews/2006q1/gigabyte-iram/index.x?pg=1

Building high end boxes that are pure solid state HDs is going to be a 
nice business for somebody, (I'll do it if somebody here wants to back 
me on this), but they better hurry because with prices dropping like a 
brick on flash memory this will be standard on all new boxes sold in 5 
to 7 years from now, at most.

Biggest issue, besides price, is going to be licking the write/rewrite 
limits of flash memory, but with flash being so cheap at that time, if 
the w/r problem isn't solved people will just transfer their data and 
replace the flash chips at regular intervals.

Goodbye whirring HDs, I can't wait.

I'd Rather Be A Matin' Than A Hatin' ~ Me

"Now, 75 years later in an abundant society where people have
laptops,cellphones, iPods and minds like empty rooms, I still plod
along with books." ~ Harper Lee, 2006

"There aren't a lot of things in this world that one can be sure
of, but I do know this; anytime you go by a House of Worship, of any
size, and of any denomination, that's filled to its rafters with
people, you can be certain that the vast majority of those people
haven't actually taken the time out to read The Bible, or whatever
ancient, "Sacred Text" that they subscribe to, because if they had read
it, and comprehended it, then that House of Worship would be nearly
empty." ~Nyc Alberts, NYC, October, 2006

"Ha ha!  Ever had the feeling you've been cheated?" ~ J. Lydon, SF, 1978

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR - Fernet Branca - SF is top Consumer LOL

Ginger Ale sounds like it would pair well w/ Fernet, but it's still a 
beastly flavor at first. I thought the same of scotch at 1st too though, and 
I love it now...

What I wouldn't do for a bottle of Oban and a shit ton of ice right now.

Yes, I bastardize my scotch with ice. It makes me happy. Shush.

Sometime, Nathan, you can be such an annoying troll.  Springer is the  
hospital spokesperson.  What do you expect him to say:  "We were just  
dumping trash"?

As the article mentions, there are several dumping cases under  
investigation by the LA police.

"Los Angeles officials have accused more than a dozen hospitals, as  
well as some outside law enforcement agencies, of dumping patients  
and criminals on Skid Row."

Do you really think, as Springer suggested, this homeless paraplegic  
wanted to be dropped on the street without a wheel chair to lie in  
his shit until he dragged himself somewhere?

"No sage or savior has ever endorsed greed and gluttony as a path

enlightened people come to us from all cultures and all eras,  
sometimes knowing of each other but more often not.  Socrates and  
Jesus, Lao Tzu and Tolstoi, Gandhi and Martin Buber -- no one can  
find in their lives and words a jot of support for a political and  
economic regime that encourages the acquisition of wealth far beyond  
what is needed for the necessaries -- or even the restorative  
pleasures -- of life while consigning the masses to live and work in  
squalor."

Well- let's be sure to make a distinction here- without judging  
either way any right/wrong aspect of that, he didn't "kill" anyone-  
to compare that to Hitler and Pol Pot or Stalin for that matter is  
ridiculous.

He returned said people to their own devices.

And distasteful as it is, the only way to advance a society is  
through the promotion of it's most beneficial members and the culling  
of it's most useless.
The nicer alternative to fratricide is thus the removal of support  
systems for those that can not "help themselves".

Any feeling man will find it unsavory, but it is a truth nonetheless.

I'm not sure how I can be called a "troll" for simply posting an  
excerpt from the linked article that it seemed the initial  
commentators seemed to have missed, but that's your prerogative I  
suppose.

As for the hospital's statement, yes it is exactly inline with what I  
would expect.  We all know there are two sides to every story, but if  
you're asking me whether I initially put more faith in the statements  
of a hospital or in the statements of a couple homeless crackhead  
witnesses, it's probably obvious which way I lean.  Likely the truth  
is somewhere in the middle.

> Do you really think, as Springer suggested, this homeless

> to lie in his shit until he dragged himself somewhere?

You've dealt with the homeless on many occasions I presume- as  
someone else stated, the dismantling of public mental-health  
facilities has left the insane to end up in three places: dead, the  
streets, or jail.  You're likely familiar with the triage system as  
well?  Those that would likely survive with or without help are given  
no help.  Those that would likely *not* survive with or without help  
are also given no help.  Instead, efforts are focused on those that  
will likely survive with help, but will likely perish without.  This  
system is usually instituted in a time of crisis.  I would wager that  
both the police departments and the hospitals in Los Angeles are in a  
state of crisis.  Even if the events occurred exactly as the  
witnesses describe, the hospital's actions are still morally  
defensible.  The hospital is not a shelter.  Its duty is to provide  
care to those in need, then send them back where they came from as  
quickly as possible, to make room for others in need.  Perhaps this  
man was judged to be in the "beyond help" category.  An unfortunate  
circumstance for sure, but it's not the hospital's actions that are  
responsible here, it's the cause of the state of crisis that is  
responsible.

I saw the first solid state drives in '98.  They had a 15 second faster 
boot than standard.

The only benefit you get is for drive acess times.  A lot of the boot 
process isn't involved with that aspect.  What you would get would be 
incredibly fast file saves for things like video editing and any large 
files you need to read/write.

That was popular in teh dos days to copy a few files into a ramdrive.  Most 
of us didn't have rgar much to spare, but it was useful.

Back in my Apple ][ days I had a full meg on my machine, so I would set up 
a 512k ramdrive, and copy the OS and many tool from flopping onto teh ram 
drive at boot.  Once I did that I never had to access the floppy anymore, 
and since I was running at 7MHz, well, it was VERY fast.

Mind you, Apple ][e stock was 128k and 1MHz.

Still have that machine too.  runs great.

"Our job this day is to become part of the answer to the world's  
immense and protracted suffering rather than continuing our ancient  
task of being part of the difficulty."

Hugh Prather - Author, minister

=
"There is suffering in life, and there are defeats. No one can avoid  
them. But it's better to lose some of the battles in the struggles  
for your dreams than to be defeated without ever knowing what you're  
fighting for"

Paulo Coelho

=
"Suffering and joy teach us, if we allow them, how to make the leap  
of empathy, which transports us into the soul and heart of another  
person. ln those transparent moments we know other people's joys and  
sorrows, and we care about their concerns as if they were our own."

Fritz Williams

=
"...when we finally know we are dying, and all other sentient beings  
are dying with us, we start to have a burning, almost heartbreaking  
sense of the
fragility and preciousness of each moment and each being, and from  
this can grow a deep, clear, limitless compassion for all being."

Sogyal Rinpoche

Subject: Re: [sfraves] 3 QODs, all in one.

You know how, during the Preflight Safety Demonstration, flight attendants 
tell you that in the event of an emergency, oxygen masks will pop out of the 
ceiling? My question is: Who wants oxygen? If I'm going to be in an 
emergency seven miles up, I want nitrous oxide, followed immediately by 
Emergency Intravenous Beverage Cart Service, so that I and my fellow 
passengers can be as relaxed as possible. ("Wow! Those are some beautiful 
engine flames!")

Yeah and really smart people have fucked up their careers and reps by

The best answer to the question:

"How did a brown eyed, brown haired, dude convince a nation that the 
ideal in life to be is blue eyed, and blonde haired?"

I've ever heard is here:
http://www.naturalchild.org/alice_miller/adolf_hitler.html

Which doesn't explain the rise of George W. Bush.

That I attribute to the "Star Wars" movies of George Lucas.

Bullshit.

Knowing full well that they would die, since they're our society's most 
vulnerable people.

That makes him a genocidal mass murderer, of his own people, so what if 
he didn't use gas or a rifle, the end result is the same.

Bet you had fun time watching the Saddam Hussein hanging video, huh, Nathan?

Wow.

Nathan, did you just say that?

How did you get into a rave scene that subscribes to the notion of PURL, 
(ok, ok, plur, but I think PURL sounds better), anyways?

In my youth, when I was setting out on a study of the classics of our 
Western civilization I was raking leaves in our backyard with my dad one 
afternoon and he pointed out that the 100 books I was going to study 
were much like the acorns that we were picking up.

An oak tree will spew out millions of acorn seeds in the course of its 
life and only an incredibly few will take root and grow into another tree.

Same thing with people.

Here's the thing.....

There is NO way of knowing which seed is going to grow into a mighty 
oak, Nathan, and which human is going to advance the human race.

No way.

None.

To pretend to say that you know that, Nathan, is a cheap rhetorical 
trick that attempts to put you on the level of god, which you, and I, 
are most decidedly not.

Moron.

Get a clue, you.

It makes me ill to know that there are millions in The United States of 
America, (what's left of it), that have been brainwashed and 
indoctrinated to think like you.

You're too old, and too far gone, for any of this to sink into your head 
full of mush, so I'm not going to waste your precious time, or mine, 
trying to convince you of anything, but I will tell you this.

You can't have it both ways, bitch.

You can't agree with a "man" like President George W. Bush who says that 
"It's important to promote a culture of life" and say what you're saying 
here.

Nathan, either "All life is precious" or it isn't.

Try to hold all your thoughts on this subject, in what passes for your 
brain, without having it explode, m'kay?

Then go watch "Cashin' In" on Fox News and leave us alone.

Yup, Apollo's right, you're a troll, Nathan, and a psychotic, homicidal 
one at that.

Feelings and "truth" are something that you obviously have zero 
acquaintance with.

And I'll bet dollars to doughnuts that while you may have a dick, and 
are one in real life, manhood is something that has thus far escaped you.

But I look up "unsavory" in the dictionary and your picture is right 
there for all to see.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR - Fernet Branca - SF is top Consumer LOL


after hearing all this talk, i picked up a bottle of
Fernet-Branca at my local Beverages & More! (aka
BevMo) down here in The OC.  I had a small glass of it
mixed with Pepsi last night and I have to say it's
quite nice.  I agree with the earlier assessment that
the first couple of sips make you think "What am I
doing?" but by the bottom of the glass, you find that
it was really a nice drink.  I stuck the bottle in the
freezer, as it seemed like it's best when highly
chilled.

Thanks, SFR! :D

I'll have to side with Mr. 7 on this one.  I've witnessed an avalanche of 
poor judgment on the part of the homeless compared to that of hospital 
workers.

Some very listers may recall an episode outside Anu where Mr. 7, Chester 
Copperpot, and I were all waiting for Mr. Phelan, Origami, and other friends 
to emerge for the continuance of that nights festivities after a wonderfully 
Folded evening.  Inexcusably intoxicated, the three of us were sparing with 
each other with the goal of simply hitting each other on the shoulder 
without exposing our shoulder and getting hit in the shoulder first. 
Childish drunken high-school antics assured, but what happened next clearly 
demonstrates how out of touch many homeless are with reality...

A large transient-looking man approached me and began to hunker down with 
his dukes up in the sparing position.  Those familiar with the SOMA district 
at 6th street just off Market will know the incorrigible nature of 
post-bar-closure transients approaching with  the most ludicrous stories or 
behavior in their attempts at separating you from the  few gin-soaked 
dollars left in your shirt pocket after a night of house music and G-n-T's. 
I thought to myself, "oh look, the guy wants to join in with hopes that 
we'll laugh, or get annoyed, or <insert any possible reaction here> and give 
him some money..."   No sooner did I finish this thought did I begin to 
regain focus on the big man in front of me, only to instead find a huge fist 
clocking me dead in the face.

What happened next is anybody's guess.  For all intents and purposes I am a 
happy and benevolent person.  However, I do believe in the most basic 
inalienable rights one has to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness and 
anyone who deny's me that right, will be dealt with swiftly and decisively. 
I don't recall anything after the blow to my head except Mr. 7 and Mr. 
Copperpot, under each  of my arms, lifting me up from the ground where now 
cowled a shaking frightened person where once a large menacing man once 
stood.

The next morning, while crafting a splint to secure the broken pinky knuckle 
on my "throwing" hand, the lack of sanity was the only thing I cursed of 
toward the man I had beaten to the ground the night before.

If anyone has a problem believing the claims of the hospital worker in this 
story, I have a knuckle on my right fist that is about twice the size of 
that on my left that I think you should have a meet with... I'm more than 
happy to ablidge.

Nyc,

I started to reply to your message, then canceled it.  It's so full

Just because you say something like that, (kinda like Big Dick Vice 
Chancellor Cheney saying "hogwash" when he's confronted with being the 
liar that he is), doesn't make it so.

Show me just one spot where I'm off the mark in any of what I wrote, and 
I'll shut the fuck up.

> that I presumed it pure troll.
Nope, not trolling, not my stylee, just a concerned American citizen 
who's gotten fed-up with the way things are and has decided to say 
something about it.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] homeless dumping

This thread, and these psychotic responses, by you, Dave, and others, 
are growing tiresome, but I'll answer you the best I can.

Let's start with I don't need to cite *a goddamned thing* to you, Dave, 
or anyone else, on this, but since you want an authoritative response, 
I'll tell you one, m'kay?

Then come and try and smear me and tell me I'm the one that's full of shit.

Fair enough?

When I moved to DC in late 2002, from Palo Alto, to live with my 
Attorney girlfriend in Bethesda, MD, I would visit her at  the  Court 
House she worked at, (the site of the Scooter Libby trial that's 
currently underway), at Third & Constitution, NW, in DC, where the 
dominant feature of the landscape is the United States Capitol Building.

Apollo used to have a sig line that read

"Music is Prophecy"

Here's an example of that for you, Dave.

There's a line from a Clash song, Car Jamming", from 1982, that goes:

"Ventilation units where towers
Meet the streets
The ragged stand in bags
Soaking heat up through their feet

This was their only kindness
And it was accidental too...."

February 2003 was the coldest winter in DC history that has ever been 
recorded, ever since they began keeping temperature records in the 
1860s,  and every day that month that I went to go see my girl at her 
job at the DC Superior Courthouse, by the US Capitol Building, I was 
greeted by the sight, while in direct line-of-sight of the US Capitol 
Building, of DC's mentally ill lying down on top of the steam grates 
that were on the on the sidewalk that released the excess heat from the 
Courthouses, in an attempt by them to stave off the bitter cold of that 
winter.

Every day that month was like wading through a frozen hurricane.

And I saw this little tableau of human misery on the streets of The 
Capital of the Wealthiest Nation on Earth each and every fucking day.

Since it was steam that was coming off those grates, they weren't going 
to stay dry, and no doubt in some of the more fragile cases of people 
doing this they were going to get sick and certainly some of them would 
die from the exposure and the rapid shifts between hot and cold air.

Disgusting.

Makes me ashamed to be a cheap ass American that puts dollars over lives.

I drew her attention to this behavior by these men and women, and the 
fact that there are also mentally ill on practically every street corner 
of our Nation's Capital begging for their lives, and getting stepped 
over and ignored by our Nation's Policy Setting Elites, and she told me 
what I was seeing was nothing.

That in the mid 1980s when Reagan and David Stockman closed the Mental 
Hospitals, the most charitable way to describe the scene on the streets 
of DC was that it looked like exactly like the poor section of India's 
Calcutta, and that there were TEN TIMES as many people on the streets of 
DC at that time then I was seeing today.

Also, when they closed those Hospitals what they did is they took the 
patients out to all sort of remote areas in buses, without telling them 
what they were doing, and just put them out of the buses onto the street 
and drove off, leaving them to fend for themselves without so much a 
dime in their pockets to call their relatives.

I don't know how old you are, but my guess is that you're somewhere 
around the age of 30, which means that when all this crap went down over 
20 years ago you must have been around 10 years old, or so, and probably 
don't remember just how big this flood of mentally ill Americans was on 
the city streets of our Nation.

It was huge.

Overwhelming in fact.

One of the more disgraceful acts ever perpetrated by our US Government, 
much worse than the internment of our Japanese citizenry during WW II, 
since at least we kept the majority of those people alive.

Most of those mentally ill people have vanished from the streets today, 
a good 90% of them, and again *I will assert* that since they weren't 
taken back into the hospitals, since we are to cheap to re-open them, 
and since the bulk of them were not taken back by their families, that 
they are dead.

Murdered, in fact, by our own Government.

And, Dave, I have exactly zero need to "prove" any of this to you.

Whatever, you have no shame about any of this, to the point of being 
sociopathic, so it's pointless to get you to see any of this.

I will tell you this, what happened to the mentally ill in America, over 
the course of these past two decades, in this war of homicide by 
attrition, is only a prelude of what's to come, Dave.

Now that we're done with them, and there aren't so many left to kill, 
we're going to start working our way up the food chain.

Don't know if your folks are still around, but if they are, and you have 
a shred of human decency in you, it will behoove you to stand over their 
shoulder while they fill out their Medicare Plan D Forms so you can be 
sure that they'll be adequately provided for.

I'd do it if I were you, as an act of self-preservation, because it's 
only going to be a matter of time before we start going after the 'free 
spirits' of our culture, people like ravers, and you're going to need 
the practice in sticking up for yourself.

Then you can take your heartless attitude and go enlist and serve in 
Iraq, which I'm sure you'll enjoy, Dave, because you'll find a lot of 
like-minded individuals that you can share your hatred of human life with.

Peisces,

~nyc

I'd Rather Be A Matin' Than A Hatin' ~ Me

"Now, 75 years later in an abundant society where people have
laptops,cellphones, iPods and minds like empty rooms, I still plod
along with books." ~ Harper Lee, 2006

"There aren't a lot of things in this world that one can be sure
of, but I do know this; anytime you go by a House of Worship, of any
size, and of any denomination, that's filled to its rafters with
people, you can be certain that the vast majority of those people
haven't actually taken the time out to read The Bible, or whatever
ancient, "Sacred Text" that they subscribe to, because if they had read
it, and comprehended it, then that House of Worship would be nearly
empty." ~Nyc Alberts, NYC, October, 2006

"Ha ha!  Ever had the feeling you've been cheated?" ~ J. Lydon, SF, 1978

Knew about Reagan and UC Berkeley, didn't know about this prelude to 
what he did as President to the mentally ill when he was Governor, 
(surprised my CSPAN junkie Godmother in Berkeley never told me about 
it), but it doesn't surprise me, it's a pattern with these people.

About a year after Katrina and the murder of New Orleans by bureaucratic 
incompetence that went far past anything Michael Brown did, or didn't 
do, I came across this year 2000 piece on the then Repukelican 
Presidential candidate, Governor Bush of Texas, written by Gail Sheehy 
that ran in Vanity Fair:

http://gailsheehy.com/Politics/polimain_bush3.html

It's super long, so if you start about 7/8ths of the way down at the 
sentences that starts

"Odessa, Texas, is the backyard of Midlandin every way. It is where the 
dirty services of the local oil and petrochemical industries are 
performed. The industry executives live in Midland. The working people 
live in Odessa."

You'll see what happened in New Orleans was no accident.

These people are monsters that will never be held to account.

At least not by the American Public, a full 30% that still believe that 
Bush and Cheney are doing a good job of not driving the country over a 
cliff.

How did we get to this point in just 6 short years?

And why, oh why, didn't George Bush just settle for being Commissioner 
of Baseball, like he originally planned, instead of becoming selected 
President?

I'd Rather Be A Matin' Than A Hatin' ~ Me

"Now, 75 years later in an abundant society where people have
laptops,cellphones, iPods and minds like empty rooms, I still plod
along with books." ~ Harper Lee, 2006

"There aren't a lot of things in this world that one can be sure
of, but I do know this; anytime you go by a House of Worship, of any
size, and of any denomination, that's filled to its rafters with
people, you can be certain that the vast majority of those people
haven't actually taken the time out to read The Bible, or whatever
ancient, "Sacred Text" that they subscribe to, because if they had read
it, and comprehended it, then that House of Worship would be nearly
empty." ~Nyc Alberts, NYC, October, 2006

"Ha ha!  Ever had the feeling you've been cheated?" ~ J. Lydon, SF, 1978

Einstein's 1905 paper on light, the one they gave him the Nobel Prize 
for, had no footnotes or citations either.

Some things, like that, and everything I've said on this subject, simply 
speak for themselves, nicht wahr?

Can we go back to talking about music and technology now?

I'd Rather Be A Matin' Than A Hatin' ~ Me

"Now, 75 years later in an abundant society where people have
laptops,cellphones, iPods and minds like empty rooms, I still plod
along with books." ~ Harper Lee, 2006

"There aren't a lot of things in this world that one can be sure
of, but I do know this; anytime you go by a House of Worship, of any
size, and of any denomination, that's filled to its rafters with
people, you can be certain that the vast majority of those people
haven't actually taken the time out to read The Bible, or whatever
ancient, "Sacred Text" that they subscribe to, because if they had read
it, and comprehended it, then that House of Worship would be nearly
empty." ~Nyc Alberts, NYC, October, 2006

"Ha ha!  Ever had the feeling you've been cheated?" ~ J. Lydon, SF, 1978

"What no one seemed to notice was the ever widening gap between the  
government and the people. And it became always wider.....the whole  
process of its coming into being, was above all diverting, it  
provided an excuse not to think....for people who did not want to  
think anyway gave us some dreadful, fundamental things to think  
about.....and kept us so busy with continuous changes and 'crises'  
and so fascinated.....by the machinations of the 'national enemies,'  
without and within, that we had no time to think about these dreadful  
things that were growing, little by little, all around us.....

"Each step was so small, so inconsequential, so well explained or, on  
occasion, 'regretted,' that unless one understood what the whole  
thing was in principle, what all these 'little measures'.....must  
some day lead to, one no more saw it developing from day to day than  
a farmer in his field sees the corn growing.....Each act is worse  
than the last, but only a little worse. You wait for the next and the  
next.

"You wait for one great shocking occasion, thinking that others, when  
such a shock comes, will join you in resisting somehow. You don't  
want to act, or even talk, alone.....you don't want to 'go out of  
your way to make trouble.' But the one great shocking occasion, when  
tens or hundreds or thousands will join with you, never comes.

"That's the difficulty. The forms are all there, all untouched, all  
reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the  
visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which  
you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of  
identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of  
hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it  
themselves, when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed.

"You have accepted things you would not have accepted five years ago,  
a year ago, things your father.....could never have imagined."

"No sage or savior has ever endorsed greed and gluttony as a path  
toward social justice or personal fulfillment.  These sane and  
enlightened people come to us from all cultures and all eras,  
sometimes knowing of each other but more often not.  Socrates and  
Jesus, Lao Tzu and Tolstoi, Gandhi and Martin Buber -- no one can  
find in their lives and words a jot of support for a political and  
economic regime that encourages the acquisition of wealth far beyond  
what is needed for the necessaries -- or even the restorative  
pleasures -- of life while consigning the masses to live and work in  
squalor."
-Stephen J. Fortunato, Associate Justice, Rhode Island Supreme Court.

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of  
the rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will  
gradually become visible."

Why must "your own devices" be so rigidly defined as the extreme (and most
simple) example ?

I attribute my ability to interact with others in an effort to trade
something I have that is valuable to others, for something they have that is
valuable to me, as one of my own "devices" that I rely on for my
livelihood.  My relatively good instincts, relatively sound reasoning,
relatively decent self-control, relatively high intelligence, relatively
high tolerance for ignorance, my command of physics, and my right foot (!),
all my own "devices", without which I doubt I would be as capable as I am of
surviving in the society I live in.

That said, I see others who are not so fortunate.  Most just need an
occasional helping hand.  We have all been there at one time or another.
Others have proven themselves beyond the reproach of others and instead rely
on their unscrupulous ability to take advantage of systems designed to help
those in need... that ability is one of *their* "devices" which, while
unsavory to those who detest the undermining it does, is a trait that allows
them to continue to survive, and sometimes even thrive.

Now there is one more group to mention -the "others"- whose "devices" are
skewed away from those basic survival instincts due to social or
physiological factors -those with "devices" of survival that fall below the
threshold required to do just that- who will unfortunately suffer the most
when the supply of spoon-fed safety systems is removed.  The systems may
have become overloaded due to undermining from the unscrupulous, neglect or
even wilful disregard from those benefactors who make up the first group of
which I and most of you belong.  The benefactors may have fallen below their
own threshold of tolerance due to their survival "devices" becoming
triggered but whatever the reason, make no mistake, in the face of being
left to *their* own "devices", members of this last group will no doubt
suffer.

None of us want those mentally of physically incapable of providing for
themselves to suffer, but with the removal of help, they will.  You can
accept this truth or not but those who that cry foul from the rooftops
should look to themselves for resolution rather than to others for blame.
The next time you're walking down Beale St between Mission and Howard
lifting your collar as a filter to shield your lungs from the wretched
stench of urine with the faint wafts of delousing solution, think to
yourselves how you can help.  I can tell you straight away that your vote
for the presidency should be the last action on your mind.  If you think
otherwise, I have news for you; no matter how much you might wish to buy
peace of mind with your dollar, you're living a fucking like.

Ask yourself, have you allowed a transient to squat in your "work" van while
it sat parked in your driveway unused, telling them they could stay there if
they kept and eye on your property ?  Why not ?  Ask yourself how you would
feel if that transient then took advantage of the situation and turned on
you and stole from you ?  Now take this example and repeat it or some
situation like it every year and a half or so, always giving the
underprivileged "another benefit of the doubt" and invariably getting the
short end of the stick, let time pass, then do it over again ?  After you've
done that, then maybe your argument might hold some worth to me over Mr.
7's.  Until then, look inside for solution before looking to others for
blame.

acting locally is g r a t e !

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR:  THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE FREE

In the winter of the year of 1994, (218 years after the founding of the 
experiment in democracy that is the republic that is The United States 
of America), the prison population passed the 1,000,000 incarcerated 
American citizens mark, for the very first time.

In the winter of 2006, a scant 12 years later, the prison population  of 
The United States of America stood at the threshold of crossing the 
7,000,000 incarcerated American citizens mark.

Do the math.

Shit's not creeping up on us anymore, it's at full gallop, bitches, with 
no end in sight.

Moore's Law doesn't just apply to computers, y'know, it's got some real 
world applications as well.

heheheh.

If, former Nixon White House Counsel, John Dean's, last book is to be 
believed, then it is a given that an Authoritarian Presidential 
candidate, (such as one Rudy Ghouliani, former Mayor of NYC), already 
has 25% of the vote in their back pocket, which means they only need 
another 26% of the vote, on top of that 25%, in 2008 to do to the USA 
what he did to NYC under his reign.

This stands more of a chance than happening, than not, thanks to Father 
Ted Haggard blowing up the Evangelical Right as a voting bloc, due to 
his whole speed/male hooker thing.

My bags are already packed and my 3, legal, Passports are current, 
(German, Slovenian, and American), and if you've got a lick of sense, 
and any sense of self-preservation, if I were you, I'd start making 
plans like I've done, because a Ghouliani Administration will make the 
Bush years look like the Lollapalooza Festival, before it went all 
commercial, and shit, man.

But, hey, feel free to blow me off and say what I'm saying is "hogwash" 
because you're too damn lazy to google this crap yourself.

You'll see, and time will tell, as it always has, won't it?

~nyc

I'd Rather Be A Matin' Than A Hatin' ~ Me

"Now, 75 years later in an abundant society where people have
laptops,cellphones, iPods and minds like empty rooms, I still plod
along with books." ~ Harper Lee, 2006

"There aren't a lot of things in this world that one can be sure
of, but I do know this; anytime you go by a House of Worship, of any
size, and of any denomination, that's filled to its rafters with
people, you can be certain that the vast majority of those people
haven't actually taken the time out to read The Bible, or whatever
ancient, "Sacred Text" that they subscribe to, because if they had read
it, and comprehended it, then that House of Worship would be nearly
empty." ~Nyc Alberts, NYC, October, 2006

"Ha ha!  Ever had the feeling you've been cheated?" ~ J. Lydon, SF, 1978

Sorry Nick.  The math is wrong.
Here's the details:
http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/pjim05.pdf

June 30, 2005 saw 2,186,230 inmates.  And it was SOMEWHERE (the online 
data has a gap) between '85 (742,579) and '90 (1,146,401) when the 
1,000,000 mark was reached.  See 
http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/pam95.pdf for those details.

I agree with your earlier homeless rebutal however.

Math is right.

Both the 1994 1 million American citizen incarcerated figure and the 
2006 *7 million* American citizen incarcerated figure includes all those 
in Gulags, on parole, and on probation.

http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/press/ppus03pr.htm

I promise not to waste my time or yours on bullshit and when I'm wrong, 
please call me on it.

Thanks!

~nyc

PS: note to Dave:

Yes, I know NYC is grate!!!!!

I live here, (within line of sight of the former Twin Towers), and 
outside of Vegas, it's one of the few places on Earth you can get a 
decent ham sandwich at 3am.

But please don't confuse the two.

I'm Nyc, the worthless piece of shit person, in your view, and NYC is 
the greatest city on Earth, but not for long if the Chinese and Indians 
have any say in the matter.

Which, btw, they will, and sooner than later too.

Enjoy your time on top, while it lasts, dawg.

I'd Rather Be A Matin' Than A Hatin' ~ Me

"Now, 75 years later in an abundant society where people have
laptops,cellphones, iPods and minds like empty rooms, I still plod
along with books." ~ Harper Lee, 2006

"There aren't a lot of things in this world that one can be sure
of, but I do know this; anytime you go by a House of Worship, of any
size, and of any denomination, that's filled to its rafters with
people, you can be certain that the vast majority of those people
haven't actually taken the time out to read The Bible, or whatever
ancient, "Sacred Text" that they subscribe to, because if they had read
it, and comprehended it, then that House of Worship would be nearly
empty." ~Nyc Alberts, NYC, October, 2006

"Ha ha!  Ever had the feeling you've been cheated?" ~ J. Lydon, SF, 1978

Bradley was a bigger talent than Kurt, mostly cuz he had a greater range.

It's an irredeemable shame that they both died at 27, irregardless of 
the cause.

I'd Rather Be A Matin' Than A Hatin' ~ Me

"Now, 75 years later in an abundant society where people have
laptops,cellphones, iPods and minds like empty rooms, I still plod
along with books." ~ Harper Lee, 2006

"There aren't a lot of things in this world that one can be sure
of, but I do know this; anytime you go by a House of Worship, of any
size, and of any denomination, that's filled to its rafters with
people, you can be certain that the vast majority of those people
haven't actually taken the time out to read The Bible, or whatever
ancient, "Sacred Text" that they subscribe to, because if they had read
it, and comprehended it, then that House of Worship would be nearly
empty." ~Nyc Alberts, NYC, October, 2006

"Ha ha!  Ever had the feeling you've been cheated?" ~ J. Lydon, SF, 1978

Well, if we use the same barometer with Reagan as we did with Sadaam, he 
did kill.  There was the Invasion of Grenada.  There were US troops sent 
to El Salvador and Nicaragua who also killed.

Your other email that points out the rise in the prison population 
should tie in to this issue, as of the 2 million people in prison, about 
1/3 are likely mentally ill, and probably in a large portion descended 
from those released from the hospitals.  I know that someone who was 
released from the mental hospitals under his watch as governor went and 
killed 13 in Santa Cruz.

In any case, a good (and LONG) look into the history of the subject of 
mental institutions (and the homeless) is at

My thoughts exactly.  Definitely feel sorry for his being that ignorant. 
But there's lots of areas to place blame for that coming about.

Ah, you add people on parole and probation to your 2006 figure.  Fair 
enough.  But comparing apples and apples, you have 5,342,900 as the 
correctional population in '95 vs. 6,889,800 on 12/31/2003.  SO, the 
jump you claim happened just didn't happen.  At least not at the 
magnitude you claimed.

But keep working on things.  You are on to a relevant point it seems.

And here's a quote from a psychiatrist along these lines:
"No one is beyond help," he says. "You have to maintain that attitude. 
Otherwise, you're playing God."

This is from this article, which also sheds a fair amount of light:

I'm sorry I'm so ignorant- my cock had my attentions-

I'd Rather Be A Matin' Than A Hatin' ~ Me

"Now, 75 years later in an abundant society where people have
laptops,cellphones, iPods and minds like empty rooms, I still plod
along with books." ~ Harper Lee, 2006

"There aren't a lot of things in this world that one can be sure
of, but I do know this; anytime you go by a House of Worship, of any
size, and of any denomination, that's filled to its rafters with
people, you can be certain that the vast majority of those people
haven't actually taken the time out to read The Bible, or whatever
ancient, "Sacred Text" that they subscribe to, because if they had read
it, and comprehended it, then that House of Worship would be nearly
empty." ~Nyc Alberts, NYC, October, 2006

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: our own devices

I don't believe I blamed Mr. Seven or anyone else for that matter for the h=
omeless problem in that posting.  I just pointed out that few of us would a=
ctually survive for long being left "to our own devices", a turn of phrase =
which Mr. Seven used originally.  That includes both you and me.  I am sorr=
y if it is hard to hear this very fundamental truth.=0A=0ACertainly the sol=
ution to the homeless problem is complex, difficult, and challenging.  Whil=
e I agree that acting locally is a good way to start, doing something is st=
ill better than doing nothing.  I also agree that risking your own life and=
 property is a lot to ask, especially when some certainly would abuse that =
trust.  That's why a good way to start giving is by giving something you ar=
e not attached to.  Try giving out water or fruit for example.  I usually h=
ave an apple or orange in my car for this purpose.=0A=0AAs far as giving so=
meone the benefit of the doubt, it is my personal goal to give everyone I m=
eet the benefit of the doubt.  Whether it is the homeless person smelling o=
f urine, the guy that cut me off on the freeway on the way to work, or even=
 a person posting offensive racist remarks to a rave list, I try to give th=
em all the benefit of the doubt.  Sometimes I even succeed.=0A=0ABy the way=
, not all of the homeless pee on themselves or smell bad.  This is a very l=
imited and biased view of the homeless problem.  Do you really believe that=
?  Why?=0A=0AHere's an exercise.  For one week, whenever you find yourself =
thinking a negative thought about someone you interact with instead try to =
come up with a new script or story that puts them in a positive light.  May=
be that guy who cut you off on the way to work is racing home to his wife w=
ho is in labor.  Maybe the homeless guy was kidnapped, tortured and dumped =
by a secret government conspiracy.   Use whatever positive story works for =
you.  =0A=0AThe truth is that most of the time when we are thinking somethi=
ng negative about someone else it is simply because we have constructed a s=
cript in our mind where that person is at fault.  In fact we rarely know th=
e true circumstances of others well enough to know their stories and this s=
cript we have is just a fantasy which we have made up.  Often our scripts r=
einforce our preexisting beliefs and sometimes they are simply habitual pat=
terns that we play out over and over again.  Maybe the guy on the freeway i=
s a selfish asshole or maybe he is racing home to take care of a sick child=
.  Which story you pick is up to you.=0A=0ASo for one week, every time you =
find yourself constructing a negative fiction about someone you meet, simpl=

Just out of curiosity, Nathan, since you're able-bodied enough to come 
to Dave's assistance when a street crazy assaulted him at 6th and Market 
one morning, why is it that you're not wearing a uniform and serving 
your country in Iraq right now?

My guess is that you're not one of these Chickenhawk things, right?

Because you're not the kind of coward that can take on a drunk street

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR:  THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE FREE


Are they talking about Inmates, as in people who are doing hard time, or 
ALL incarcerated people, including at the county level (3 year stetch)

I'm guessing one stat is counting one of those, and the other, well, the other.

Considering there are more new prisons, jails and such than schools, it 
does say something.  The gov't is more apt to expand, remodel and modernize 
a jail/prison, than they are to make sure that students have text books 
that were printed within the last 20 years.

(DANGER DANGER!!  SHATTER TANGENT)

Now, since most the peopel on this list seem prety smart...  explain THIS 
one to me.

The Gov't goes around testing schools.  They see how smart the kids 
are.  The schools with teh highest score get the funding.  The goes toward 
school improvement, text books, computer, classrooms, what have you.  Sound 
great right?

Fuck no it doesn't.  It's obvious they are giving the money to the schools 
that NEED IT LEAST!  If these kids are scoreing high on tests, then 
obviously they already HAVE great books, great teachers, and everything 
they need for a proper education.  Shouldn't the money go to the school 
with teh worst scores so the kids can maybe get a better education, better 
themselves, and maybe take a stab at the kids with the best scores?

I know, I know...  "What's to stop a school from taking a dive on the tests 
to get the worst score to get the money?   EASY -- Same thing that's 
stopping a school from submitting false tests that are all marked correct.

I thought a lot about this back when I was in High School (80's) and a lot 
of us talked about it, and thought it was messe dup.  So...  what did we 
do?  We sat and worke dout the test, figure dout the correct answer, then 
marked a wrong one.  See, IMHO, it's harder to get 0.00% right than it is 
to get 100%.  See, you might have guesse don a few and guess right to get 
100%.  To get 0.00% right you have to KNOW the answer in order to make sur 
you don't accidently guess right.

Some of my stoner friends however were too lazy to care, so, they just made 
pretty pictures on the scan tron.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] homeless dumping


Gotta say...

Nail on da head.

My ex was a worker at a State mental institution (the ONLY one regan didn't 
shut down, Sonoma State in Glen Ellen).  Her mom worked at the hospital as 
well.  Her grandmother retired, after working there here whole 
life.  Suffice to say, I would say that it would qualify that their family 
were, mental health workers.

There's the types of units:  Behavioral, and Bed.  Everyone in teh hospital 
falls into one of those catagories.  If they cannot get up and walk around 
on their own, they are a bed unit.  If they can walk, Behavioral.  There's 
no middle ground.

If you mentioned Regan around that family, you could see the seething 
vitriol and bile swelling up from the darkest pits of their 
angerpool.  Hatred isn't a strong enough word for what they 
felt.  See...  a lot of the peopel who were "left to their own devices" 
ended up on their door step.  They were FORCED to turn them away because 
they were already over crowded.  State couldn't shut'em down becaus ethey 
had a 100% clean track record, best in the state, not so for many 
others.  One mistake made and that's how they shut down the hosital because 
"These people would be better off on their own than living in these 
horrible conditions" or something like that was the sound bite used to sell 
it at the time.  They were doing all these mentally ill people a favor by 
turning them loose into the wild.

Does anyone think the Soma Screamer is better off?

So, since they couldn't shut'em down, the state simply said "No new 
patients" so even ehen they would leave, they wouldn't take on new ones.

Now, if that's not bad enough, chekc this one out:

Wanna make some extra cash?  Well have I got a great offer for you!  The 
state of california presents -- "Adopt-o-tard!"  That's right!  You can 
adopt your very one "ready for the outside world" mentally ill person to 
living in your home, and the state will pay you!  Why?  Because it's 
cheaper to kick you down acash each month than to run a hospital!  They're 
paying you, and saving the tax payers money!  What a perfect system?  Adopt 
two and get a bonus check for FREE!

So one girl they had worked with was ready to go out into one of these 
houses.  She was calm, hadn't had a freak out attack in over a year.  Nice 
looking, long hair they would brush which made her quite happy.

One week later she was back.  Most of the hair was gone, and what wans't 
ripped out was shorn very shory.  Horrid bruises, welts, an such all over 
her.  She apparently looked like somebody that had been raped then tossed 
off an overpass onto 101 at 3am and hit by a drunk guy in a ryder 
truck.  They of course, investigated.

"Self Inflicted"

Nice eh?  They had to isolate her because she came back a complete spastic 
screaming biting spitting shit flinger.  Yes, I write dramatically at 
times, however the previous sentence is pretty much word for word how she 
was described to me.

nice eh?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] homeless dumping

Oops I fucked up.

Apollo still uses the "music is prophesy" line in his .sig

One small set of questions about the "costs" involved in taking care of 
our mentally ill here in The United States of America.

Is The United States of America richer, or poorer, today, in the year 
2007 than it was it was in the year 1985?

If it's poorer, that's one thing, but if it's richer, then how is it 
that we can't "afford" to take care of our own people properly?

Where's the logic in that?

If we could afford it when we weren't as well off as we are today, then 
why can't we afford it now?

What's up with that?

Unless, of course, We Americans are just a bunch of sadistic 
cheapskates, with no conscience, or ethics, then it's just a moot 
question, isn't it?

See you in hell.

I simply go away for 20 years and when I come back the whole fucking 
town has gone to shit.

It's a national disgrace what happened to Times Square and don't even 
get me started on the klubs and hipster infestation.

This town needs an enema.

I'd Rather Be A Matin' Than A Hatin' ~ Me

"Now, 75 years later in an abundant society where people have
laptops,cellphones, iPods and minds like empty rooms, I still plod
along with books." ~ Harper Lee, 2006

"There aren't a lot of things in this world that one can be sure
of, but I do know this; anytime you go by a House of Worship, of any
size, and of any denomination, that's filled to its rafters with
people, you can be certain that the vast majority of those people
haven't actually taken the time out to read The Bible, or whatever
ancient, "Sacred Text" that they subscribe to, because if they had read
it, and comprehended it, then that House of Worship would be nearly
empty." ~Nyc Alberts, NYC, October, 2006

In my mind, a more logical approach to this matter would be to have a 
baseline, likely tied in to the actual cost of living in a local area, 
and then have funding vary AT A NOMINAL LEVEL above or below that to at 
least provide SOME incentive to a school system to be above average.

1980 and 1990.  Go Rayguz!!  But it also almost doubled again from 90 to 
05 (Go prison industrial complex!!)

There is definitely a lot of reform that needs to be done in American
Schools.  There was news report on 60 minutes that compared out public
schooling to the Belgian public schooling system.  I think we could learn a
thing or two from the belgians.  Some of the things the Belgians did was to
fire teachers who weren't up to standards, and the closing down of schools
which weren't performing up to expected standards.  Try incorporating this
into public schools without the teacher's union getting involved...

My understanding is that the US school system pretty muc keeps up with 
the rest of the world, up until the 4th grade.  After that, the drop in 
test scores keeps accelerating until we're pretty low on the scale once 
it's time for people to graduate H.S.  Definitely sad, but an educated 
populace definitely isn't high on the list of the powers that be.

Babus
A Memorial and Celebration of James Kim's Life

Saturday, February 17th, 2007
1:00pm: Memorial
2:00pm - Sunset: Celebration
Location: Golden Gate Park Memorial Bandshell and Music Concourse

The family and friends of James Kim would like to extend a warm
invitation to join us in celebrating and remembering James' life.
This outdoor gathering serves to remind us of the deep ties that
bring us together, and honors James' appreciation for his family,
friends, and community.

This will be a family event -- bring your kids, bring a picnic, and
bring warm clothes. We will be celebrating with DJs, music,
and dancing until sunset.

In addition, we are proud to announce and unveil The James Kim
Technology Foundation. The purpose of the fund is to benefit
technology
programs in public schools. Donations to the foundation will be
appreciated.

Importing skilled labor is a lot cheaper than investing it here at home.
Patriotism as it's greatest- right?

By design.  This is all done by design by the richest of the rich  
that hate the freedom we have in our country and right now are  
bankrupting it so they can have their little 1984 playground.  there  
may be pockets of good teachers in the public school system of  
america, but largely you've got a system that's designed to fail, and  
teachers and staff that are indoctrinated to indoctrinate.  when i  
have kids they'll either be home schooled or private schooled,  
probably a combination of both, and when we come to the sunset  
parties for geriatrics i'll also make sure to tell them "don't mind  
uncle peter now, he's just paranoid."

Publicity is always a good motivator IMHO.  Spotlight the kids, the 
administrations, etc.  Schools LOVE to put big awards on the sides of the 
buildings and such.

My problem is giving funding based on rewards makes from a school that's 
going to remodel their football field while another handing out particle 
masks to studenst so they don't breathe the deteriorating asbestos falling 
from the ceiling while they have to double up on their history book 
published in 1952.

The teacher firing I'm all for.

The closing down of the schools ranks up there with the closing of mental 
health hospitals.

Where are the kids going to go?  To an already over crowded school?

I would say let's ask a Libertarian.

Where's Starchild?

Osby!  You know where everyone is.  Please go find him, thanks.

That's what everyone says, however as it's been pointed out,  the german 
people were one of the most educated and advanced people, and we all know 
what happened to them (as pointed out by Apollo in that very good post)

I think it's a matter of what they're educated in.  The curriculums don't 
impress me in the least with the american school system.  So many subjects 
are skipped until college.  I mean, why don't kids get Plato in High 
school?  Shouldn't the Jr high and High school classes all be a lead in 
towards what you study in college?  So that college courses are a continued 
education as they should be instead of beginning of it?

Oh that's easy..

Libertarian says to issue vouchers and let parents put their kids in 
whatever school they want.  True educational economics.

While there are certainly teachers that need to be fired, the problems (at =

One recent example: my daughter is a special ed student in SFUSD and theref=

 late virtually every day  resulting in her and all of the other children o=
n the bus being late for school by 15-20 minutes.  The bus was on time exac=
tly 7 days for the entire period from August through December 31st and this=
 was documented by multiple parents and the school.  Despite the efforts of=
 the parents reporting this, demanding the school and principal do somethin=
g, reporting it to the district and the transportation office, nothing was =
done.  I was repeatedly told that nothing could be done by various people f=
rom SFUSD.  Two weeks ago I retained an attorney for $300.  Today I heard t=
hat a new driver has been assigned to the route.=0A=0AAnd this isn't the fi=
rst incident of this sort.  Previously I've had to spend thousands of dolla=
rs on educational testing just to keep her in special ed.  I was actually u=
nemployed at the time and living off < $2000 per month.  The special ed tea=
cher tried to trick me into signing papers which stated my daughter no long=

My problem is the whole system of Tenure.  Once they reach that then they 
become untouchable, and can pretty much get away with anything they 
want.  Teacher should be held accountable for keeping their work quality 
high, just liek any other job out there.

I don't mean fire them all, I'm saying if they can make the cut, then they 
need to go away and make room for somebody who will do a better job.

Just like the bus driver you pointed out.

If you notice my take n things, I mentioned NOMINAL scales of change. 
Not something on this line, but something to make things worth it.

I'd have to look at test score data to make a conclusion about that one. 
I seem to recall our HS test scores coming in at around the top 30 realm 
of developed nations.  That puts a LOT of countries ahead of us, not 
just Germany.  And as such I'm sure many of those countries have much 
more sane politics than others.

Agreed.  I just hate the idea that school is a work training ground. 
It's an educational system.

I had a tenured professor, who was teaching EE101, who often had to 
postpone answering a question until the next class session.  This was 
FIRST level engineering.

Exactly.  American school have not a whole lot to do with this anymore, 
especially HS.  It's a social test bed, and nothing else, made for teaching 
people their place in life.

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) QOD (Tue)

Today's Quote of the Day is brought to you by Clorox Bleach.

Visit http://www.clorox.com for wonderful cleaning products for  
bathing, laundry and kitchen.

Last night I listened to Jeff Rense and he gave Webster Tarpley the  
floor for 2 hours to talk about Iran.  I think he was also on Alex  
Jones, from what I'm reading in the alternative media, Georgie and  
Dickie are really licking their chops over Iran, and they would prefer  
it to be nuclear.

Don't do it guys.  It's not worth it.

Corey Rowe, one of the Loose Change guys, is an Afghanistan veteran.   
He was the next guy in the queue for the QOD (I have like 30 of them  
lined up just for *you*.) Muah.

What we have done to their country I mean I can't even imagine if someone

I'm going to repost this Alice Miller essay on the subject, since she 
does a bang-up job of explaining how a man with brown hair and brown 
eyes could hoodwink an entire nation into believing in the lie of the 
superiority of the Aryan Ideal of blue eyed and blonde haired people: 
http://www.naturalchild.org/alice_miller/adolf_hitler.html

Again, What Miller says about the nature of German society being primed 
to accept a guy like Hitler as a leader doesn't explain  how we 
Americans ended up with Herr Uber Chancellor El Commandante President 4 
Life George W. Busch, as well, for that you need to read John Dean's 
latest book:
http://www.amazon.com/Conservatives-Without-Conscience-John-Dean/dp/0670037745

(Also, and I'm not joking, I believe that the "Star Wars" movie series 
is one of the largest contributing factors in our culture that led to 
the rise of Herr Georgie Busch, but that one's complicated to explain, 
and it's got a lot of moving parts to it, and so I'll talk about that at 
another time.)

Also, if Dean is to be believed in this new book of his, he indirectly 
makes the case that an Authoritarian figure like  Rudy Ghouliani has 
more than a solid chance of being elected President in 2008.

Ghouliani would only need 26% of the vote, to win the election, outside 
of the 25% block of slavish, Authoritarian followers, that would vote 
for him automatically, according to Dean's theory, without question.

Guarantee you that simple set of numbers are what his Republican 
handlers are banking on for him to win the election, and I'm afraid 
they're right.

Scary stuff, yo.

I've a lot to say on this, so please bear with.

I was blessed in that the NYC Public Junior High I went to had a math 
teacher that, each and every year, would shut down the school's regular 
curriculum for an entire week and teach the *whole* 7th grade the 
history of Math, up to, and including the Theory of Relativity and what 
was then current.

His premise that there was no better time to get this sort of thing into 
kids heads and the "Shop Kids" were just as capable as grasping this 
shit as the College bound ones were.

So we were lucky.

I've never seen a latitudinal, over time, follow-up study, but I'll bet 
a significant proportion of us kids that studied under this guy ended up 
having better lives as a result of this man having this kind of faith in 
us and our capabilities.

It's a shame no one has followed his work.

I'm sure our American culture would not look like anything it does today 
if we had made that choice a generation ago.

Now when you ask, Shatter,"why don't kids get Plato in High school?"the 
answer to that question actually puts you in with some really weird company.

Like Leo Strauss, The Neo-Cons, and The Project For A New American Century.

Robert Pirsig, in his non-fiction, biography, "Zen & The Art Of 
Motorcycle Maintenance ", writes about the University of Chicago, and 
its "Great Books Program" where he studied under the Straussians, in the 
late 1950s.

Here's a brief description of what he found there.:

"In the Aristotelian tradition as interpreted by the medieval 
scholastics, man is counted a rational animal, capable of seeking and 
defining the good life and achieving it.

When this "first principle" about the nature of man was accepted by the 
president of the University of Chicago, it was inevitable that it would 
have educational repercussions.

The famous University of Chicago Great Books program and the 
reorganization of the University structure along Aristotelian lines and 
*the establishment of the "College," in which a reading of classics was 
initiated in fifteen-year-old students,* were some of the results." 
(emphasis added)
http://www.virtualschool.edu/mon/Quality/PirsigZen/part4.html

These University of Chicago people he writes about in his book are 
today's Neo-Conservatives.

How far does their reach and influence go?

All the way to the top.

They run the fucking country, and have for quite a while.

Don't believe it?

I studied under them here, http://tinyurl.com/5nr9x , so let me assert 
my expertise on the subject, by showing you this picture of one of my 
Tutors, Eva Brann, (Yes, that's her real name), getting a 2005 National 
Humanities Medal from President George Bush in the Oval Office: 
http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/11/images/20051110-2_d-0317-515h.html
(If you doubt the Leo Strauss connection, please bear in mind that 
Strauss spent the last 3 years of his life teaching at the College 
mentioned in the caption of that photo, and in fact he *died on the 
campus* there in 1973, and when I was there Brann was known as a faculty 
member that belonged to the "Cult of Leo Strauss." No, I'm not making 
this shit up. Why would I, and on a rave list no less? Where's the 
quarter in that for me?)

I know these assholes, like I said, I studied under them, and they're 
full of shit.

What they believe, and they get this out of their Plato, is that they 
are the self-appointed "Philosopher Kings" of this culture, and it is 
their "job" to keep us pieces of shit  in our place.

And believe me that's how they see us, the General Public, we are 
nothing but pieces of shit to them to be run roughshod over, by any 
means necessary.

Bill Kristol of Fox News is one of them, and I guarantee you when he 
does his bit on his show he has nothing but disdain for what he 
considers the rubes of his viewing audience.

That's how these people think.

What they've been doing, for the last quarter century, is making a 
concerted effort, to borrow one of their terms from one of their guys, 
Harold Bloom, is to "close the American Mind."

In that, they've succeeded spectacularily.

The destruction of the American Educational System under Reagan\Bush & 
Bush II is Prima Facie evidence of that.

See, it's alright for them and theirs to be the educated Elites of this 
culture, but god forbid we the people get a decent education.

Let me go back to this list of books:

http://tinyurl.com/5nr9x

The Conventional Wisdom is that that is a set of reading that one should 
not attempt until one is of College age because it is too difficult for 
the average person to grasp.

Pernicious nonsense.

There is not a goddamned thing on that list that the average 14 to 18 
year old kid in America can't mentally handle.

Sure, it's not "easy" stuff to wade through, it's not supposed to be, if 
the goal is to educate the populace.

The question really is is why aren't we doing it in the first fucking place?

And the answer comes flying back, because they don't want it, because if 
we, the American People, were an educated populace, thre is no way in 
hell they could put across on tenth of the con jobs that they've foisted 
on the American populace.

What's the "solution" to this?

I don't know because they've now got the deck pretty well stacked in 
their favor being that they have control of the media, the military, the 
Government, Courts, jails and educational system.

If past history is any indication, the way they will ultimately lose is 
the same way every other corrupt elite has lost, their shit is 
unsustainable over time and at a certain point it will come collapsing 
down upon their heads.

In the meantime they are going to fuck up a lot of innocent people just 
so they can keep running their game.

I'd Rather Be A Matin' Than A Hatin' ~ Me

"Now, 75 years later in an abundant society where people have
laptops,cellphones, iPods and minds like empty rooms, I still plod
along with books." ~ Harper Lee, 2006

"There aren't a lot of things in this world that one can be sure
of, but I do know this; anytime you go by a House of Worship, of any
size, and of any denomination, that's filled to its rafters with
people, you can be certain that the vast majority of those people
haven't actually taken the time out to read The Bible, or whatever
ancient, "Sacred Text" that they subscribe to, because if they had read
it, and comprehended it, then that House of Worship would be nearly
empty." ~Nyc Alberts, NYC, October, 2006

"Ha ha!  Ever had the feeling you've been cheated?" ~ J. Lydon, SF, 1978

I was in Wal-Mart buying a large bag of Purina for my dogs and was in line to check out. A woman behind me asked if I had a dog........ Duh!


I was feeling a bit crabby so on impulse, I told her no, I was starting  The Purina Diet again, although I probably shouldn't because I'd ended up in the hospital last time, but that I'd lost 50 pounds before I awakened in an intensive care unit with tubes coming out of most of my orifices and IVs in both arms. Her eyes about bugged out of her head. 

I went on and on with the bogus diet story and she was totally buying it. I told her that it was an easy, inexpensive diet and that the way it works is to load your pockets or purse with Purina nuggets and simply eat one or two every time you feel hungry. The package said the food is nutritionally complete so I was going to try it again. 

I have to mention here that practically everyone in the line was by now enthralled with my story, particularly a tall guy behind her.  Horrified, she asked if something in the dog food had poisoned me and was that was why I ended up in the hospital. 

I said no.....I'd been sitting in the street licking my butt when a car hit me. 

I thought the tall guy was going to have to be carried out the door.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE FREE


Ya...  I get that a lot...

My problem is the there's quite a bit of "New Conservative" (definition as 
in the quotes would give you from a dictionry, meaning, a conservative that 
has nothing to do with the old conservatives) I agree with, however please 
don't think I'm a Neo-Con because I can't stand those assholes either.

I say this because, i thik our education sucks, and we should get back to 
some subjects that are beyond science.  If we're going to push for 
"liberal" education, then let' get some real Liberal Arts instead of the 
standard study of "White people, their cuture are bad, and anything not 
american should be celebrated and put on a pedastal." (No, I'm not a 
multi-culturalist, and i don't celebrate diversity, sorry guys.  As I've 
said before, I'm an American, I have a culture.  Everyone I live with and 
know are Americans, and we have american culture.  We are still a melting 
pot, so no one thing should be previlant.)

Some philosophy, perhaps language beyond Spanish being 
taught.  Sociology?  Why not?  Shouldn't high school kids grasp the 
concepts of the mind set of large groups of people, analize the problems 
from a clinical point of veiw, and learn the reasons why we and the world 
have the problems we face?

How about real political science, and not just a semester on the 
constitution.  Cover theconstitution as well, obviously, but why don't high 
school kids hear more about levithan, Calvin, The Federalist papers and 
"Pluvius"?   Teach the kids about Politcal PACS, the money trail, 
lobbyists, etc.  Half od teh kids in high school are of voting age after all.

Course we know why.  Don't educate them.  Let them get their political 
views from MTV and Politically Incorrect.  Let some rock star tell them how 
to vote.  Better yet, let the apathy seeth in and convince them their vote 
doesn't count.  Reduce the voting populace.  Every person that doesn't vote 
makes your vote more important after all.

Ok....   ranting now.

Back to the new con thing...

I think we should worry about ourselves first.  Our people, our country, 
our economy.  Why???  Simple.

Until we have abolished poverty, homelessness, and creatied a good standard 
of loving for ALL citizens regardless of economic standing, we are in no 
position to tell anyone else how to run their country.  Would you take 
economic advice from a broke homeless guy? Then what country would listen 
to the U.S. about how to end poverty when our streets are filled with 
people starving.

So while I might occasionally spout off with neocon crud, my basis of 
reasoning and intent is usually very different.

3,000+ people for his own political, and personal gain, Ghouliani not

What can I say, it totally fits him to a tee, and calling him by his

9/ !! 9/ !! 9/ !! anytime any idiot wants to put forth the canard that

Cosmo Kramer, please.

I was born at night, but not last night, bitch.

I grew up here and I live too damn close to The Towers, and go by them

Fuck him and the people he's got around him.

They suck, and not in a good way.

He's hostile to life and freedom as we know it.

His 8 years as Mayor of NYC are a living testament to that fact.

Last week I did a brief two day stint working as a canvasser on the 
Upper West and East Sides of Manhattan for Howard Dean's Democratic 
National Committee and I saw the truth of the "Authoritarian Complex" 
that John Dean describes in his new book.

As soon as the "progressive minded" kid I was working with and I got 
onto the subject of Ghouliani, and his Presidential chances, I watched 
his mind close like a steel trap when I brought up just how much damage 
Ghouliani has done to the City of New York under his Reign of Terror.

It was surreal.

He tried to float the bullshit meme that's in currency of how Ghouliani 
had the guts to"clean up NYC", and when I gently corrected him and told 
him that Ghouliani did nothing of the sort, and all he did was replace 
one group of completely disorganized criminal thugs and replaced them 
with another, much organized group of thugs, complete with badges, guns 
and uniforms, via his empowerment of the NYPD, and that the average New 
Yorker today is much more afraid of the cops than they ever were of the 
street thugs of the past, this poor kid's face just completely froze up 
and he refused to discuss it any further with me.

Indoctrinated kids like him are the ones that are going to elect a 
monster like this as an American President, and when that happens, 
having your night life disrupted is going to be the least of your worries.

Xin Nian Hao!

So here's a bit of blatant self-promotion on my part.  J.C. was kind enough
to have me as a guest DJ on his show last week, and as I uploaded the
recording I thought I'd share a bit of my work with y'all.

This is dual purpose.  First, I'd just really like you guys to hear the
music I'm digging these days and see what you think of my style (feedback
more than welcome).
Second, I really love performing, and I figure this is one way to start
putting myself out there and see if any opportunities to play out come of
it.

So here goes.  First, a link to the full 2hrs 25mins worth of mix that I
broadcasted on Epiphany of Sound last Thursday.  At one point my laptop
deleted a number of warp markers in one song, so I took the liberty of
editing out this technology-driven trainwreck.  It's not all the newest
stuff, just songs I like, primarily techno but with some tech/progressive
house too.  Here's the link:
http://progressivemojo.phang.net/progressiveMOJO%20-%20Live%20on%20Epiphany%20Of%20Sound%202007-02-08.mp3<https://webmail.stanford.edu/horde/util/go.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fprogressivemojo.phang.net%2FprogressiveMOJO%2520-%2520Live%2520on%2520Epiphany%2520Of%2520Sound%25202007-02-08.mp3&Horde=850c05286ecdabf29beeeb2604c5185b>

Next, a little techno thing I put together during exams last semester.  It
was also the first mix I ever did in Ableton Live!:
http://progressivemojo.phang.net/progressiveMOJO%20-%20It%20Rains%20Too%20Much%20Here%20(December%202006).mp3<https://webmail.stanford.edu/horde/util/go.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fprogressivemojo.phang.net%2FprogressiveMOJO%2520-%2520It%2520Rains%2520Too%2520Much%2520Here%2520%28December%25202006%29.mp3&Horde=850c05286ecdabf29beeeb2604c5185b>

Lastly, something I recorded over the summer.  This one was the result of
messing around with a few months' worth of vinyl one afternoon and seeing
what I could come up with
http://progressivemojo.phang.net/progressiveMOJO%20-%20July%202006.mp3<https://webmail.stanford.edu/horde/util/go.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fprogressivemojo.phang.net%2FprogressiveMOJO%2520-%2520July%25202006.mp3&Horde=850c05286ecdabf29beeeb2604c5185b>

In the interests of saving space, I won't post the tracklists here but I'll
gladly supply them on request.  Please let me know if you have any problems
getting them to download.
Your feedback is VERY welcome, I'm always trying to improve and knowing what
people think about my work is essential for that.

If you are interested in booking me, or if you know someone who might be,
just shoot me an email at this address or call me at (281) 687-0393.

Thanks, and I hope you listen and enjoy!

Matt

Subject: [sfraves] BMP: "No Mastering" by Marc(O) circa 2002

I dunno WTF I was thinking by attempting to send this str8 to SFR via 
YouSendIt - DUR. I guess my brain is fried after seeing Dave Chappelle at 
the Punch Line tonight - booya!!!

Anyhoo, the mix is an old house mix I did back in '02. It's not planned, a 
total "one shot" dealio, and as the title suggests, it's just the raw mix. I 
wound up turing down the bass about 15 minutes (give or take) into it, but 
OTT the mix still sounds bumpin'. Or at least, for being my 1st decent mix 
ever, I think it's at least worth a DL. Feel free to comment iof you 
like...sadly a track listing is impossible since I sold off all the vinyl 
since then, heh.

Considering who we're dealing with, they'll just sell that gas to the next 
country on our hit list.

Go team!

OK, I don't have the time and/or patience for this.

You like to talk about conspiracy?

It's a nice little time filler, I guess.

I arrived in the United States of America about an hour after Kennedy 
got capped in Dallas in 1963 and I live too damn close to the 9/!! 
Memorial Pit to tolerate this shit.

At 10:45am, est, on the morning of September 1th, 2001, you know for a 
goddamn fact that at least 5 teams of real life "Lone Gunmen", as seen 
on TV, showed up on the corner of Church and Liberty with an array of 
electronic chemical sniffing equipment and not *one* of them found any 
trace of a C-4 or thermite signature.

How do I know this?

Because if any of these guys found such a thing as a C-4, or thermite, 
chemical signature in the air down there they'd never shut their yaps 
about it, that's how I know this.

Quit desecrating the memories of those who died in these attacks by 
spewing this crap, m'kay?

Thanks.

That'd be great.

My loathing of Ghouliani is strictly reality based.

That was no dig at you, I was kind of making a joke.

It's obvious that you're an old school conservative andnot one of these 
neo-con artist whackos.

Though I don't post much anymore on SFR, I have been lurking here for 
years. I've just recently ported all my online activities over to this 
email addy, (since it's the name of the electronics company my dad had 
in the early 1970's),  and away from my "nwa420" persona, since I've 
decided to get serious about what I'm doing, and saying, a move I should 
have made a decade ago, and, well, I've been reading your stuff here, 
and we're pretty much on the same page, so I thought you'd get the joke 
without getting all defensive on my lily white ass.

Damned email, it still hasn't licked that "convey tone" issue.

But no joke, you should have seen my eyes pinwheel when I saw that 
picture of my tutor Eva Brann in the WH Oval Office getting that Medal 
from Herr Busch.

Freaked me the fuck out.

I was sipping coffee at the time, and yes, I did a god's honest spit 
take when I saw it.

That's the kind of validation of what I've been telling people, for 
years, that I could have gone my whole life without getting.

Who needs that kind of waking nightmare?

I know I don't.

But you, judging by everything you wrote below, get where I'm coming 
from, and what you've written here are ideas I'd like to explore further 
and this seems to be the ideal proving ground for it, irregardless of 
how many rabid indoctrinated puppy dogs want to nip at our heels.

I'd Rather Be A Matin' Than A Hatin' ~ Me

"Now, 75 years later in an abundant society where people have
laptops,cellphones, iPods and minds like empty rooms, I still plod
along with books." ~ Harper Lee, 2006

"There aren't a lot of things in this world that one can be sure
of, but I do know this; anytime you go by a House of Worship, of any
size, and of any denomination, that's filled to its rafters with
people, you can be certain that the vast majority of those people
haven't actually taken the time out to read The Bible, or whatever
ancient, "Sacred Text" that they subscribe to, because if they had read
it, and comprehended it, then that House of Worship would be nearly
empty." ~Nyc Alberts, NYC, October, 2006

"Ha ha!  Ever had the feeling you've been cheated?" ~ J. Lydon, SF, 1978

Hate to argue...

(I'll assume you mean Sept 11 not 1st)

but at that time I think everyone in visual range of the towers were too 
busy worrying about survival, figureing out what happened, and being 
shocked by plane #2 to think about breaking out the tech toys and sniffing 
around for a conspiracy.

They still havn't explained the Pentagon or flight 91.

Mind you, I would be happy with the ugly truth.  If they shot planes down, 
say so.  Really, I'd be ok with it, as would most people, IMHO. Tell the 
honest truth that it's bette rto shoot down one of our own passenger 
liners, yes, filled with innocent people, than to let some fucked up 
radical try this stunt again.  Send a message.

Do I think the planes took the towers down?  Yes.  Could the towers have 
stood up as designed to withstand the hits?  Yes, howeve rthose planes were 
larger than the towers were designed for and the impact knocked off a 
signifigant amount of the fire retardarnt inner coasting, which as we know, 
was put on my the owerest bidder.  Do I think the pilots (if there were 
any) did this with no outside help?  No.  You don't get flight lessons on a 
prop and fly a commercial jet liner into a building.  That's like taking 3 
day intro to C programming class and writing the current incarnation of 
Firefox the following weekend.  Could the plane of been remote piloted by 
an AWAX?  Oh yes, yes indeed.  Was it strange that all key personel had 
already left or never showed up to teh buildings the say of (just like the 
OK Federal building)?  Yes.  Did the Bush admin have a clue it was going to 
happen?  Yes.  Did they capitalize on it for their agenda that 6 months 
previous had been shot down in Congress (Patriot Act)  Yes.  Are they the 
types who like to talk about Omlettes and Eggs?  Yes, oh yes they are.

Naw, I think old school conservatives are a bit of a pain as well.  In 
truth on thos epolitical tests I rate as a mildly liberal Libertarian.  I 
agree with most things Libertarian until they start talking about borders 
and free trade.

Hell, I don't even think we have any conservatives in office.  We have 
Republicrats and Demopublicans.  All you hear from conservatives is 
typically "GAYS ARE BAD, ABORTION BAD, CHURCH GOOD".  Where as I have no 
problems with gays, abortion issues I don't care to talk about becaus eit's 
probably the most situatinal judgement issue anyone can bring up (however I 
will say that Abortion as a form of birth control is just plain WRONG - eg 
people who won't use BC and if they flub up just go get a slice'n dice), 
and religion and beliefs are a great thing but Churches are just another 
form of antiqued gov't who's time has long since past, especially the 
catholics.

Oh no, I got it, it's the other 98% that sometime lack sense of humor, so I 
get a little pedantic and explain things.  I'm on year 20 with online

Oh man, missed that.  I've got a few funny pics floating around here, that 
arn't photoshopped, like Saddam and Chaney shaking hands and laughing for 
the camera 20 years ago.  Another of Saddam throwing up gang signs.  It's 
the picture sthat need no photoshopping that are always the best.

Let's bite.  Perhaps the brains will start to churn out some thought 
process beyond quoting sound bites.  Then again this is what makes me a bad 
promoter (aka politician) because I open my mouth for all to see then 
people boycott me because of my opinion.  ;)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: More tech geekery


Smart sources are speculating (and I'm in total agreement) that the future 
won't be these multi core chips.  We're already seeing diminishing returns 
on them.  Quad will be the end for a bit while they push them harder and 
faster, and then we'll see a break toward distributed processing systems of 
varying bit size.  A return to 16bit, 24 bit etc that we're already seeing, 
but at a much larger level.

Already we have GPU's, and NPU's are stating to emerge.  If you geeks 
havn't looked at KillerNIC do look at it.  I'm really thinking of going 
that route.  There's also the Physics sub processor that's on many 
motherboards now, that's increasing game performance by unloading all 
physics calculations to a dedicated processor.  Befor ethe days of the 
Floating point processing will remember when all system had a math 
co-processor to operate.

Essentially instead of a standard NIC you have a NPU card running a 400MHz 
chip with it's own ram and non volitale storage.  It's running Linus and 
acts as it's own sub computer handling all network traffic.  Your computer 
simply send data and the NIC does the rest.  All TCP/IP functions happen on 
the card, freeing up you CPU to do other things.  You can also have on card 
Firewall, Applications (Teamspeak, Vent, etc) all running on card, and not 
on computer.

Control is done from a simple terminal, like you would with any *nix system.

Consider other aspect that could be done via a distributed system and you 
can see where this can go.  We already have sound moving off the main bus 
and onto dedicated sub processing systems.  Music peopel have been doing 
thsi for years to some extent, but now it's becoming defacto.

Essentially, in another 5-8 years we shoudl start seeing what amounts to a 
distributed cluster into the box.

Then of course, many years after that they'll being it all back into the 
next interation of super chip, most likely something in the Quantum realm, 
or photonics.

Oh I'm sure they'll go past the quad, but the problem is going to be the 
OS's keeping up, much how that article mentions.  You're almost going to 
have to have an interpreter Sub proc to handle the OS talking to the CPU, 
passing on tasks regardless of OS or something weird.  Donno.

Remember the Neural Networks?  Whatever happened to those?  Those were 
supposed to be the rage, but didn't seem to get very far.

Wonder how many cross talking cores you need before the chip becomes self 
aware.

So it looks like in 2012, the Earth's axis is definitely going to tilt

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Purina Diet

You are my guitar hero of the day!

Like your email alias, judging by this post of yours, it probably fits 
you IRL as well..

We should join forces, I get a kick doing stuff like this, and it's 
always more fun if you have a like minded partner to work with.

I usually work off the phone with inbound calls from telemarketers, 
here's a brief description of what I do that I posted elsewhere about a 
week ago:

~~~

I love making phone calls like this.

The week President Nixon died my desk partner and I played merry hell 
out with every building that didn't fly their flags at half mast in San 
Francisco's Financial District, most notably the Pacific Stock Exchange.

They didn't see that one coming.

Also, what's really fun for me is messing with telemarketers, I can keep 
them on the phone for hours until they realize that I'm just fucking 
with them.

Sometimes I pretend that I've got Down's Syndrome, and if it's a woman I 
immediately ask her what she's wearing and move the conversation in that 
direction.

I once got this one girl in New Delhi so upset, (the call immediately 
devolved into a "what are you wearing" from me and went downhill from 
there for 15 minutes), she called me back on her own cell phone just to 
cuss me out, never mind what she must have had to pay to get some 
satisfaction out of me.

heheheh.

I've been faulted for doing this, but it beats screaming "Do Not Call!!" 
at them and gets better results, they tend to never call back after 
dealing with me on the phone.

I should record this bit and put out a CD.

The diff is I don't make the calls, they call me, which gives me mad 
license to go to town.

A phone is a WMD in my hands and I don't know why more people don't do 
this, it's fun to turn tables, y'know.

I once bumped into NYT Select*, (bitches), columnist Paul Krugman* on 
the corner of 17th and K Street, NW, as we were both leaving Farragut 
Park one day, and I asked him to relay the following story of one of 
these calls of mine to his colleague, Mr. Tom "The World Is Flat" 
Friedman, since what I'm about to tell you is his bailiwick more than 
Krugman's.

I pretended to have LaTourette's Syndrome on this one call that came in 
and abused, (believe it or don't, she never once lost her cool and was 
polite throughout),  this one female telemarketer, (who was selling a 
*local* landscaping firm's services), for about a half hour until *I* 
the one that was spent, and then I dropped it and started talking with her.

Turns out she was 23, was calling from Romania, had just graduated 
college, spoke 5 languages, and here's the punch line....

Was being paid $200USD a month to put up with my shit on the phone.

Make a decision, if you're a businessman, who would you hire?

A surly US GED holder that you pay $1,200.00 a month that's going to 
drive away your customers, or her?

And yet you people still hold on to the quaint notion that America isn't 
doomed by its own shit and ain't gonna have its lunch eaten by the 
Second World.

I'd Rather Be A Matin' Than A Hatin' ~ Me

"Now, 75 years later in an abundant society where people have
laptops,cellphones, iPods and minds like empty rooms, I still plod
along with books." ~ Harper Lee, 2006

"There aren't a lot of things in this world that one can be sure
of, but I do know this; anytime you go by a House of Worship, of any
size, and of any denomination, that's filled to its rafters with
people, you can be certain that the vast majority of those people
haven't actually taken the time out to read The Bible, or whatever
ancient, "Sacred Text" that they subscribe to, because if they had read
it, and comprehended it, then that House of Worship would be nearly
empty." ~Nyc Alberts, NYC, October, 2006

"Ha ha!  Ever had the feeling you've been cheated?" ~ J. Lydon, SF, 1978

Like your email alias, judging by this post of yours, it probably fits 
you IRL as well..

We should join forces, I get a kick doing stuff like this, and it's 
always more fun if you have a like minded partner to work with.

I usually work off the phone with inbound calls from telemarketers, 
here's a brief description of what I do that I posted elsewhere about a 
week ago:

~~~

I love making phone calls like this.

The week President Nixon died my desk partner and I played merry hell 
out with every building that didn't fly their flags at half mast in San 
Francisco's Financial District, most notably the Pacific Stock Exchange.

They didn't see that one coming.

Also, what's really fun for me is messing with telemarketers, I can keep 
them on the phone for hours until they realize that I'm just fucking 
with them.

Sometimes I pretend that I've got Down's Syndrome, and if it's a woman I 
immediately ask her what she's wearing and move the conversation in that 
direction.

I once got this one girl in New Delhi so upset, (the call immediately 
devolved into a "what are you wearing" from me and went downhill from 
there for 15 minutes), she called me back on her own cell phone just to 
cuss me out, never mind what she must have had to pay to get some 
satisfaction out of me.

heheheh.

I've been faulted for doing this, but it beats screaming "Do Not Call!!" 
at them and gets better results, they tend to never call back after 
dealing with me on the phone.

I should record this bit and put out a CD.

The diff is I don't make the calls, they call me, which gives me mad 
license to go to town.

A phone is a WMD in my hands and I don't know why more people don't do 
this, it's fun to turn tables, y'know.

I once bumped into NYT Select*, (bitches), columnist Paul Krugman* on 
the corner of 17th and K Street, NW, as we were both leaving Farragut 
Park one day, and I asked him to relay the following story of one of 
these calls of mine to his colleague, Mr. Tom "The World Is Flat" 
Friedman, since what I'm about to tell you is his bailiwick more than 
Krugman's.

I pretended to have LaTourette's Syndrome on this one call that came in 
and abused, (believe it or don't, she never once lost her cool and was 
polite throughout), this one female telemarketer, (who was selling a 
*local* landscaping firm's services), for about a half hour until *I* 
the one that was spent, and then I dropped it and started talking with her.

Turns out she was 23, was calling from Romania, had just graduated 
college, spoke 5 languages, and here's the punch line....

Was being paid $200USD a month to put up with my shit on the phone.

Make a decision, if you're a businessman, who would you hire?

A surly US GED holder that you pay $1,200.00 a month that's going to 
drive away your customers, or her?

And yet you people still hold on to the quaint notion that America isn't 
doomed by its own shit and ain't gonna have its lunch eaten by the 
Second World.

I'd Rather Be A Matin' Than A Hatin' ~ Me

"Now, 75 years later in an abundant society where people have
laptops,cellphones, iPods and minds like empty rooms, I still plod
along with books." ~ Harper Lee, 2006

"There aren't a lot of things in this world that one can be sure
of, but I do know this; anytime you go by a House of Worship, of any
size, and of any denomination, that's filled to its rafters with
people, you can be certain that the vast majority of those people
haven't actually taken the time out to read The Bible, or whatever
ancient, "Sacred Text" that they subscribe to, because if they had read
it, and comprehended it, then that House of Worship would be nearly
empty." ~Nyc Alberts, NYC, October, 2006

"Ha ha! Ever had the feeling you've been cheated?" ~ J. Lydon, SF, 1978

I should record this bit and put out a CD.

The diff is I don't make the calls, they call me, which gives me mad 
license to go to town.

A phone is a WMD in my hands and I don't know why more people don't do 
this, it's fun to turn tables, y'know.

I once bumped into NYT Select*, (bitches), columnist Paul Krugman* on 
the corner of 17th and K Street, NW, as we were both leaving Farragut 
Park one day, and I asked him to relay the following story of one of 
these calls of mine to his colleague, Mr. Tom "The World Is Flat" 
Friedman, since what I'm about to tell you is his bailiwick more than 
Krugman's.

I pretended to have LaTourette's Syndrome on this one call that came in 
and abused, (believe it or don't, she never once lost her cool and was 
polite throughout), this one female telemarketer, (who was selling a 
*local* landscaping firm's services), for about a half hour until *I* 
the one that was spent, and then I dropped it and started talking with her.

Turns out she was 23, was calling from Romania, had just graduated 
college, spoke 5 languages, and here's the punch line....

Was being paid $200USD a month to put up with my shit on the phone.

Make a decision, if you're a businessman, who would you hire?

A surly US GED holder that you pay $1,200.00 a month that's going to 
drive away your customers, or her?

And yet you people still hold on to the quaint notion that America isn't 
doomed by its own shit and ain't gonna have its lunch eaten by the 
Second World.

I'd Rather Be A Matin' Than A Hatin' ~ Me

"Now, 75 years later in an abundant society where people have
laptops,cellphones, iPods and minds like empty rooms, I still plod
along with books." ~ Harper Lee, 2006

"There aren't a lot of things in this world that one can be sure
of, but I do know this; anytime you go by a House of Worship, of any
size, and of any denomination, that's filled to its rafters with
people, you can be certain that the vast majority of those people
haven't actually taken the time out to read The Bible, or whatever
ancient, "Sacred Text" that they subscribe to, because if they had read
it, and comprehended it, then that House of Worship would be nearly
empty." ~Nyc Alberts, NYC, October, 2006

"Ha ha! Ever had the feeling you've been cheated?" ~ J. Lydon, SF, 1978

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Purina Diet... DJ Seven....

After DJ Seven wouldn't take me off his mailing list,
I routinely hunted his ISP down and had his accounts
turned off. This didn't seem to curb his love for
spam.

So, I then tracked down his home phone, fax, and cell.
For months, I set my computer up to ring the three
numbers in succession, randomly at night, early am,
and sometimes just in the middle of the day.

I don't receive his emails anymore.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] SF Pillow Fight!!!

I once got a group of like 15 friends together with about 100 cans of 
Silly String and then we all rolled over to Borrones outdoor cafe at 
Kepler's Books in Menlo Park and went up to a table of friends that had 
like 7 to 10 people sitting at it, slammed about 15 cans on the table 
and yelled "Let's Go!!!"

They dove for the cans and then we went at it like a pack of mad chihauhas.

It was like being in the middle of a moving, living, breathing Jackson 
Polllock painting in 3D.

By the time the waitstaff caught wind of what we were up to we had 
pretty much emptied the cans and were ready to bounce, which we did 
before they could ID us and like, ban us for life for this egregious 
breach of social etiquette.

Guess we had more of a blast doing that than the grunts are having these 
days using Silly String to spot IED trip wires in Iraq, huh?

~nyc

PS: Silly String is totally RR.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Purina Diet... DJ Seven....

I heard a second story about a tech who had a "keen sense of justice and 
retribution" who if you pissed him off on a call would remote access 
your box and pull your mouse and keyboard drivers.

Box would continue to work until the next time the end-user rebooted the 
machine and then..... nothing.

Dead air.

Whether or not this was just an urban legend, I never found out, because 
that was a pond I didn't wan't to go swimming in.

My life is complicated enough as it is.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Purina Diet... DJ Seven....


Legend.

However what DID work was when you would call teh number, and get the ring, 
send down the isolation tone, which would turn off everything past the 
demarkation point, namely, inside the house.

Dead line, etc etc.  Wouldn't last forever, but great fun to somebody who 
didn't know how to bypass those on their house, which was just about 
everyone.  They're neat little pieces of hardware inside the junction box 
on your house.

Sorta.

The quote was "invalidated" by Peter because the person saying it happens

Hardly.

If we were truely at war with terror, and specifically, ptential terror 
domestically, then we would have locke dup our borders, especially the 
mexican border, and kept track of everyone trying to get into teh country.

We never did that.

The Mexican border is the biggest point of entry for people to get into 
this country illegally.  No, I'm not picking on teh mexicans, in fact, they 
take the brunt of people impersonateing workers trying to slip over 
here.  The other large spot peopel slip in is through Canada across the 
love canal, though anyone crossing there tends to glow in the dark afterwards.

They have already documented and detained quite a few on the wanted 
list.  From a statistical point of view, taking into account the amount of 
land to patrol, it's safe to say that for everyone one that was caught 
easily 100 slipped through without incident.

Instead, we have put our own citizens through the ringer, worried about 
politically correct ideals like "profiling" and gone out of our way not to 
offend.

The point is this:  If you are going to fight a war, then fight a 
war.  Don't do it half asses, don't use bandaids.  Strike hard, fast, and 
with brutal efficientcy.  Wipe out all opposition and make sure there's 
nobody left to retaliate.  Otherwise, don't go to war.

The word war get's tossed around so losely.  War isn't a fist fight.  War 
is the total elimination of an enemy, or beating them until they completely 
submit.

So yes, he's right.  If we were serious about the "War on terror" then we 
would have locked down our borders.  This is how we know that Bush is full 
of shit, because while he lauched a war on two fronts he then was pushing 
for open borders.  Sorry, but as einstein said "you can't simultaniously 
prepare for war and prevent war."  Say thing.  You can't claim to be going 
to war for our securit and safety while taking the front and back door off 
the hinges.

Of course they do.  Coast guard and local sheriffs have a LOT more control 
over our waters than the border patrol does with the land.  Consider that 
it's harde rto get into a bar in san francisco than it is to get into the 
country.

When I say close, I don't mean barricade.  Closing means tighter security 
and checks.  Closeing doesn't mean a wall, it means stop the flow of 
unchecked entry and exit, and maybe running our check points as tight as 
the air lines do for domestic flights.

>How much money would it cost and how many soldiers would be required to do it?

Well, I'm sure the guys in Iraq wouldn't mind some domestic duty where they 
aren't dodging IED's and 7.54mm rounds all day.  Plenty of soldiers there.

The effort would have a much great effect of creating "National Security" 
than what we are doing right now.

Oh right, we don't actually make anything anymore, we just consume.

We are getting a bit off subject.  I'm simply saying that if you are going 
to go to war with something, then you close up the borders.  That isn't to 
say you can't have free travel.  You of course immediately cite germany, 
which is a bad example, only because that was part of the whole eastern 
bloc aspect.  They were keping people in, not people out.

It would be very easy to secure (again, not barricade) the souther border. 
It's call a nice tall chain link fence.  It simply runs along our property 
and divides us from mexico.  It stops at roads.  Much if this is in place, 
I'm simply saying lets fix the parts that are broken.  Anyone deciding to 
go cross country wold find their way barred.  Anyoen with bolt cutters 
might find themselves looking down the barrel of a US troop wearing night 
vision.

Is this wrong?  They are breaking a law.  Then again, this is a whole 
nuther issue.

If you really want, I can dig out the arabs (ya ya, lack of a better term, 
I'm tired) that were crossing into texas, posing as mexican illeagal 
immigrants.  They had shaved their beards, had new clothing, but when they 
got stopped in San Antonio and ran they matched up with peopel who two 
weeks previous had been attempting to come into teh countr via london and 
were denied.  That's one case I remember, there have been several.  Thus, 
why i said statistically that if we find any, considering how many peopel 
cross in undetected, that it's safe to say there are a LOT that have 
slipped in and not been caught.  Are they terrorists?  Who knows.  I guess 
if something get's bombed, we'll know.

True, false positives being what they are.

The whole war on terror isn't my method of fighting btw.  My solution is to 
further impose on the American people that it's the PEOPLE'S problem to do 
something.  Look out in their neighborhoods and take cae of 
yourself.  Learn how to defend, learn to shoot a gun.  Take care of 
yourself and stop waiting for somebody to do it for you.

Again, much of this is just an acedemic argument.  I'm simply supporting 
the original statement about war.  For the record, a "War on Terror" is 
liek a War on Drugs, or a War on Communism.

Common.  You can't fight ideals with bullets.  It's a stalemate.  It's 
something to just perpetuate the war machine and divert funding for 
something that could use the money a whole lot more.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] (nrr) QOD (Wed)

I was stunned that our borders weren't temporarily sealed after 9/!!, as 
they should have, been for at least a week or two.

That, and the massive over-reaction, (yes the deaths of 3,000+ innocent 
Americans on our own soil *is* a tragedy, I'm not minimizing that, but 
in terms of a percentage of our population of 300 million people, it's 
nothing, (like 0.0001% of the USA's population),  as is the loss of four 
planes, and 4 pieces of real estate on less than 25 acres of land, on 
the all together), to the attacks themselves, brought home just how out 
of touch, both the American people and its leadership were, and still 
are, to how The United States of America is perceived by the outside world.

Heads up, we're not very well liked for the shit that we, 5% of the 
world's population, has been ramming down the throats of the rest of the 
world, just because we can, and it was only a matter of time before an 
attack like this was going to happen.

The fact that we didn't see it coming, and reacted the way we did, 
points out just how much all of us have been blithely living in La-La 
Land about our behavior on the world stage for the last 15+ years prior.

We had some real opportunities in the immediate aftermath to do things 
differently, starting with,

"OK, you got a good shot in, and we're going to grieve for an 
appropriate period, and then since we're the most powerful nation in the 
world, we're going to just shrug it off, because something like this 
cannot, and *will not*, do any long term damage to us, and then we will 
land an equivalent punch on those that committed this atrocity, in 
response, and bring them to justice."

Then we're all going to take a time out and figure out what it is that 
we're doing that inspired this level of hatred that men would give their 
lives to try to hurt us like this, and then we'll sit down at the table 
and try to figure out what we *all* can do to ensure that something like 
this never happens again."

We didn't do any of that, did we?

Nope, we didn't.

Not after the 1st attack on the Towers in 1993, (which comes out of the 
same damned well), and not after this second attack, which our craven 
leadership then exploited for their own ends, by turning it into the 
21st Century version of the Reichstag Fire, (following the original 
playbook practically note for note, see: Patriot Acts I & II),  New 
Millennium Stylee.

See, doing all that would have required some real effort on our part, 
and let's face it, we're a lazy people, (not that there's anything wrong 
with that), and it's just a lot easier to rend cloth, gnash teeth and 
pull our hair out of our heads and act all aggrieved, like a spoliled 
child that's had their NintendoGame Boy or PSP  taken away for the 
night, over a hangnail of a wound, (while the rest of the world is 
hungry, blind in one eye, hard of hearing,  limping around with two 
broken legs and nursing a case of shingles and cancer), than it would 
have been to roll up our sleeves and actually do some work around this.

Instead we opted to follow this insane route we're on.

None of this addresses the question of sealed borders, so let me briefly 
return to that.

They're on their way here in The United States of America, and just as 
others have pointed out they won't be to keep people from getting in, 
but like in East Germany under the Soviet, they will be put up to keep 
people in.

For further discussion of this I yield the floor to Marshall Brain, (as 
close to an unimpeachible source that I can find, good luck digging up 
any discrediting dirt on him), who has written extensively on the 
subject for several years.

To get an overview of his thinking, follow all the links you see in the 
following items:

While I'm here, Marshall Brain has also got some interesting stuff to

Actually the State Department web site does not list Mexico on it list of travel advisories currently (see http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/tw/tw_1764.html) but why let facts interfere with a good rant eh?

I'd Rather Be A Matin' Than A Hatin' ~ Me

"Now, 75 years later in an abundant society where people have
laptops,cellphones, iPods and minds like empty rooms, I still plod
along with books." ~ Harper Lee, 2006

"There aren't a lot of things in this world that one can be sure
of, but I do know this; anytime you go by a House of Worship, of any
size, and of any denomination, that's filled to its rafters with
people, you can be certain that the vast majority of those people
haven't actually taken the time out to read The Bible, or whatever
ancient, "Sacred Text" that they subscribe to, because if they had read
it, and comprehended it, then that House of Worship would be nearly
empty." ~Nyc Alberts, NYC, October, 2006

Subject: [sfraves] Geri Dahl We Hardly Knew Ye....

This is a continuation of a fictional piece.....

"Ig"

"What?!?"

"Buick Grand Twinkies Le Sabre hydroxide."

"Oh, OK."

Today, February 15th,  is the anniversary of Geri Dahl Last Post To SFR 
and let us all take a moment to contemplate what in the hell she was 
ever talking about.

Where she came from, nobody knows, (though a friend claims to have hung 
out with her), and where she has gone, nobody knows either.

Some say she's in Vegas, hanging with Mr. Cooper, Elvis, and 900 foot Jesus.

Some say she sits in Karl Rove's ear and tells him what to do, which 
would explain a lot, nicht wahr?

Some say she never existed in the first place and is just the mass, 
collective hallucination of SFR.

Some say that she's the Head Writer of the Cartoon Network, which, given 
the preponderence of the evidence, is the most credible theory out there.

Some say she was the one that guided that missile into The Pentagon.

Some say that none of this is true.

Some say all of this is true.

Whatever the case may be, one shining truth stands out, like Reagan's 
shining city on a hill, if Geri Dahl did not exist, it would be 
necessary to invent her.

Don't know about you, but since I haven't heard hide nor hair of her, in 
a dog's age, I'm a gonna go light a candle, pour out a 40 on the curb, 
and debate her place in the Pantheon of the Events of this Day: 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_15#Events

I'd also like to move that from This Day Forward February 15th Shall Be 
Forever Known As "Geri Dahl Day."

Discuss amonngst yourselves.

Xin Nian Hao!

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: Tonight! Alloy Trex live!



Hi all,

Alex and I are performing at our local lounge, the ReTox tonight, as
our live downtempo duo, "Alloy Trex".  We do breaky, dubby, psy tunes
with lots of beat mashing and synth tweaking.  You might remember us 
from the downtempo rooms of past psy parties, mostly Koinonea, but
also a few others.

ReTox is a very mellow bar literally at the edge of the city in the quirky
Dogpatch neighborhood, just below Potrero Hill.  Super-easy parking, no
cover or anything.  We will play at around 9pm.

We have some samples of our most recent tracks here:

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE FREE

My favorite current "Conspiracy Theory" of the moment is the one where 
Star Trek creator, one Gene Rodenberry, reached out from the grave with 
his cold, dead, hand, and sent the world the Borg, "7 of 9",  just so 
The Democratic Junior United States Senator of Illinois, one Mister 
Barack Hussein Obama, could run for the US Senate, and win, and then run 
for the President of The United States of America, just so he, 
Rodenberry could get a capricious kick out of giving Hillary Rodham 
Clinton a severe case of the kittens.

heheheh.

It's a knee slapper, not near as funny as the Mark Foley page scandal 
thing, (nothing can beat that, I've never seen Fox News Anchor Brit Hume 
squirm quite like that before), but, you gotta admit, given the unsavory 
details, pretty hysterical, nonetheless.

And here's the punchline....

Unlike every other conspiracy theory that's floating out there in the 
ether....

"It's all true."

You can look it up:

http://tinyurl.com/352nhm
http://tinyurl.com/avlbu

Who's smiling now?
http://tinyurl.com/yo55ar

My favorite part of all this is, in a case of Poetic Justice being 
totally real, and served up hot, and piping, is that "Jack Ryan" is also 
the name of Tom Clancy's All American Super Duper Wet Dream Hero that 
the whackos on the right circle jerk off to every night, which was 
dude's main, (some say only), selling point in his burgeoning political 
career that Rodenberry destroyed from the great beyond.

Can't make this shit up.

I'd Rather Be A Matin' Than A Hatin' ~ Me

"Now, 75 years later in an abundant society where people have
laptops,cellphones, iPods and minds like empty rooms, I still plod
along with books." ~ Harper Lee, 2006

"There aren't a lot of things in this world that one can be sure
of, but I do know this; anytime you go by a House of Worship, of any
size, and of any denomination, that's filled to its rafters with
people, you can be certain that the vast majority of those people
haven't actually taken the time out to read The Bible, or whatever
ancient, "Sacred Text" that they subscribe to, because if they had read
it, and comprehended it, then that House of Worship would be nearly
empty." ~Nyc Alberts, NYC, October, 2006

"Ha ha!  Ever had the feeling you've been cheated?" ~ J. Lydon, SF, 1978

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: Tonal - Fire Engine Red next Friday w/ Miles Maeda + Brown!

Rock It Science, Prismatic Tracks, Crush Collective, and sfhousemusic.com
present:

Tonal - Fire Engine Red

Friday, February 23rd
11 PM 'til very late

SF Location: call 888-482-9281 or 415-412-0406, or visit prismatictracks.com
or sfhousemusic.com the day of for directions 

$10 before midnight, $15 after
$5 discount for dressing in Fire Engine Red
(at door person's discretion--make some serious effort people!)
 
After the epic party experience of Electric Blue we are very excited to
bring you Tonal: Fire Engine Red!  Get ready for the next throwdown in this
series of sick new color themed parties brought to you by some of the
hottest crews in the underground house scene. We are teaming up to bring you
only the best in funky, floorshaking underground house music to keep you
grooving until the break of dawn. Tonal parties will showcase talent flown
in from out of town as well as some of your favorite local house jocks.
Strap on your dancing shoes and get ready to move it! 
 
DJ's:
 
DJ Miles Maeda (Ouvre, Aroma, Apt Entertainment)--Los Angeles/Chicago
 
Miles Maeda was one of the pioneering members of Chicago's scene in the
early '90s, putting out a slew of now legendary mixtapes that inspired many
a young aspiring dj.  Miles has since grown to be a favorite dj of many,
known for his precise mixing skills and poised presence behind the decks.
Sharing a residency at Chicago's Smartbar alongside Justin Long and DJ
Heather, travelling the world to share his  music with everyone, and
consistently putting out top notch tracks keeps Miles very busy.  We are
very excited to have him out for our 2nd Tonal party and can't wait to hear
him lay it down!  www.milesmaeda.com
 
Brown (Drop Music, Aroma, Mobile Trax)--Nottingham, UK
 
Nottingham based vocalist and producer, Brown is one of the key players in
the new UK sound which has had a huge impact on the record bags of our
favorite dj's. Featured in collaborations with Littlemen, Inland Knights, Da
Sunlounge, Andrew Phelan & Origami, and Bryan Jones, Brown has put tracks
out on many a hot label such as Drop, Mobile Trax, Aroma, Myna, Prismatic,
and many more.  Brown's debut SF appearance at Crush-o-matic last summer had
everybody grooving, and we are happy to welcome him back for Round Two for
another dj set featuring himself on live vocals.
www.myspace.com/brownrecordings
 
Andrew Phelan & Origami (Prismatic, Drop Music, So Sound)
 
One of SF's fastest growing duos in both the DJ and production realms,
Andrew and Origami put down some serious business.  The boys tore it up at
Electric Blue and will surely do so again this time.  A Chicago native, Mr.
Phelan brings the funk just how we like it with Origami backing him up on
live bass keeping the speakers booming and your bodies moving!
www.myspace.com/apo 
 
Eric Sharp (Rock It Science)
 
Founder of the Rock It Science crew, Eric Sharp has quickly built a name for
himself with his infectious energy behind the decks and the versatility to
rock any party. Eric's opening set at Electric Blue got everybody going just
right.  This time Eric will throw down a Fire Engine Red closing set,
leaving everybody begging for more and heading for the Endup.
www.myspace.com/ericsharp
 
Rob Crush (Crush Collective)
 
Buckle up San Francisco!  Rob Crush seems to be everywhere at once,
spreading the good word about some of our city's favorite parties.  What you
may not know about Rob is that he has secretly been honing his craft, mixing
records deep within the bowels of a dj research laboratory covered by a
biotechnology front.  You are going to wonder why you haven't heard from Rob
sooner, and we look forward to seeing him get a lot more action on the
decks!

I'm seriously bummed that I have a midterm exam at 8am tomorrow that's
preventing me from going to this.  Otherwise I'd be all over it, but I'm not
a big fan of taking exams on no sleep.

Switch is awesome.  CVS is great too.  Mezzanine is a cool place.  Should go
down proper, have fun all you who go.

ps: sorry bam, forgot to hit reply-all last time

          Random Acts of Kindness Week    By David Price
Mon, February 12, 2007, 12:01 am PST
                    
    (Photo by lifeisajourney)"No act of kindness, however small, is ever wasted." - Aesop

On the drive to work today, traffic was bumper to bumper, the brake lights were playing a sick Morse code with my brain, and coffee had dripped from the cheap paper cup onto my clean white shirt. And I waved to everyone. I was getting into the swing of things for Random Acts of Kindness Week. Yes, it's more than a slogan on a bumper sticker. It doesn't really matter what you do; kindness comes in all shapes and sizes. Maybe you can help an old lady cross the street, bring in your neighbor's trash cans, or help a stranger change a tire. If you have trouble thinking of something, here's a list that may spark some kind ideas. Leave a calling card, or just let it be a mystery. However you spread kindness this week, have fun and smile.

Suggested Sites...     
   The Random Acts of Kindness Foundation - inspiring people to practice kindness.   
   Free Hugs Campaign - sometimes even a hug is enough.   
   Extreme Kindness - join the kindness crew.   
   Staged Kindness - make believe the world is a happier place until it really is.   
   Purple Acts of Kindness - even here at the corporate mothership, we like to do acts of kindness.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Purina Diet... DJ Seven....

ooh, there was some guy that got my email address when i was in that  
late night coalition thing and he kept spamming the hell out of me  
with his stupid club mail that i didn't want, well one time he made  
the mistake of doing a cc: instead of a bcc: and i couldn't resist  
doing a reply all with some really rank comments, well probably  
normal stuff if you live in north carolina or something, but you know  
just stupid stuff, then he replied to me actually, took the time to  
reply, and threatened me with all this crap like he knows all these  
people and i should heed warning and all this crap.  i never heard  
from him again.  fortunately i completely forgot the guy's name.  i  
say fortunately for me because that's just useless information i  
don't need in my life.  ju know?

Because every time I go by the Memorial Pit at Church & Liberty I see 
them there infesting the site and desecrating the memory of the people 
that died in the attacks.

Pretty vulgar  display just to move a few DVDs and books.

There are other cleaner ways to make money in NYC, y'know.

Like running a hedge fund dedicated to stealing from widows and orphans.

I buy the interconnected buildings, diesel fire in the basement story.

Still pissed at myself when I missed seeing Lou Reed play at the 
dedication ceremony for the re-opening last year, fucker was so close to 
the audience you could have smelled his breath.

I'd Rather Be A Matin' Than A Hatin' ~ Me

"Now, 75 years later in an abundant society where people have
laptops,cellphones, iPods and minds like empty rooms, I still plod
along with books." ~ Harper Lee, 2006

"There aren't a lot of things in this world that one can be sure
of, but I do know this; anytime you go by a House of Worship, of any
size, and of any denomination, that's filled to its rafters with
people, you can be certain that the vast majority of those people
haven't actually taken the time out to read The Bible, or whatever
ancient, "Sacred Text" that they subscribe to, because if they had read
it, and comprehended it, then that House of Worship would be nearly
empty." ~Nyc Alberts, NYC, October, 2006

"No sage or savior has ever endorsed greed and gluttony as a path  
toward social justice or personal fulfillment.  These sane and  
enlightened people come to us from all cultures and all eras,  
sometimes knowing of each other but more often not.  Socrates and  
Jesus, Lao Tzu and Tolstoi, Gandhi and Martin Buber -- no one can  
find in their lives and words a jot of support for a political and  
economic regime that encourages the acquisition of wealth far beyond  
what is needed for the necessaries -- or even the restorative  
pleasures -- of life while consigning the masses to live and work in  
squalor."
-Stephen J. Fortunato, Associate Justice, Rhode Island Supreme Court.

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of  
the rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will  
gradually become visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

All of this is not to say that I didn't get a tremendous bang out of 
this Pilot Episode http://www.mininova.org/get/507708 of the "Lone 
Gunmen" that ran on 4 March 2001, a solid 27 weeks prior.

heheheh.

Spectacular.

It's a keeper.

And fuel for the fire for the whackos, I know.

I'd Rather Be A Matin' Than A Hatin' ~ Me

"Now, 75 years later in an abundant society where people have
laptops,cellphones, iPods and minds like empty rooms, I still plod
along with books." ~ Harper Lee, 2006

"There aren't a lot of things in this world that one can be sure
of, but I do know this; anytime you go by a House of Worship, of any
size, and of any denomination, that's filled to its rafters with
people, you can be certain that the vast majority of those people
haven't actually taken the time out to read The Bible, or whatever
ancient, "Sacred Text" that they subscribe to, because if they had read
it, and comprehended it, then that House of Worship would be nearly
empty." ~Nyc Alberts, NYC, October, 2006

"Ha ha!  Ever had the feeling you've been cheated?" ~ J. Lydon, SF, 1978

I said that there were teams of self-styled Lone Gunmen types there *on 
the day of* within 15 minutes of the second building collapsing, and in 
the days immediately thereafter, and they didn't find anyfuckingthing, 
not a gaddamned thing, or else we'd have never have fucking heard the 
end of it, given how much noise they're making out of nothing.

And let's assume, for a second, that they're right, and it was an inside 
job.

If I had the cajones to pull an op like that off, do you think for a 
second that I'd give half a squirt of piss about what some conspiracy 
theorist had to say about it?

Neither do I.

End of.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE FREE

Yup, there's that.

Why would they be allowed to live if they were truly onto something?

If I did it, and if  anyone got anywhere close to "the truth", they'd be 
a grease stain, quicker than you can say "doe-ray-mi", bitch

But that's just me.

And on a personal level, all this 9/!! shit really gets under my skin, 
especially this week, and especially today, because it just so happens 
to be the 62nd Anniversary Week of The Valentine's Day Allied 
Firebombing of Dresden, http://tinyurl.com/2zuev9 which might not mean 
jack shit to anyone else on this list, but 100+ members of my family on 
my Mother's side were melted there, and by that I mean their bodies were 
turned into a *sheet of motherfucking glass* in the conflagration of the 
British and Yank's Valentine's Day present to Adolph.

So I don't have a lot of patience for the 9/!! crowd, on either side of 
the aisle.

Also, you revisionists can fucking bite me.

Dresden, by any measure, be it property, (which seems to be the bigger 
concern here in the good old US of A), or loss of life, is a *thousand* 
times worse than what happened on 9/!!.

So I'm not just flapping my gums when I say the USA madly over-reacted 
with our national response to 9/!!, and don't even try to lump me in 
with that asshole, Ward Churchill, either, tyvm.

I've been there to Dresden and I've seen it, we totally fucked that 
place up, yo.

We made it look like New York's South Bronx in the 1970's under Mayor's 
Lindsay and Beame.

So pardon the fuck out of me if I just want the 9/!! Conspiracy Brigade 
to just up and STFU and find something else that's real that they can 
throw their energy into, like making sure we get the hell out of Iraq, 
or better yet......

Katrina.

We shut this motherfucking country down for two solid weeks after 9/!! 
but the biggest issue after Katrina, (which instead of taking out just 
25 acres of land, devasted an area the size of Great Britain),  seemed 
to be where The New Orleans Saints were a gonna play them some football 
that week.

Ugh.

Hello, is this thing on?

What's the hell is wrong with this picture?

Yeah, how about giving New Orleans and environs some of that 9/!! love, 
and money and support, because trust me the rebuilding in NYC is 
proceeding apace, once the greedhead vultures of the LMDC got their act 
together as to how they were going to divvy up the loot that fell on 
them from the clear blue sky, and, besides, New Orleans could use it a 
lot more than NYC.

Ya think?

Yeah, you got some excess energy to burn off, want to make a change for 
the better?

Habitat For Humanity in Biloxi is always looking for a few good hands to 
help out.

Why not go on down there and quit desecrating the Hallowed Ground of the 
9/!! Memorial Pit and leave the memory of those that died there to their 
family and friends?

You know, like show some respect for the dead?

It's kinda the right thing to do,ya know what I mean, Vern?

Thanks!

That'd be great!

results over and over again.  And the reason is, most people offer  
the majority of their thought in response to what they are observing.

oh, i'm sorry, i was still waiting for you to post some evidence,  
some mainstream news articles that proved that guiliani didn't ship  
all the 9/11 evidence off to china and that there were no thermite  
cutter charges placed in the buildings.  but i guess you're not going  
to because it's easier to just parrot bill o'reilly and act like  
you're the only one that lost friends and family that day.  or maybe  
is it because there is no evidence to back up your claims?

can i get you a cracker?

Shatter,

You know, I have to say that I only disagree with you on one point in =20=

this thread, and that is your comment about Peter invalidating this =20
thread with his hateful comments about Col. Ron Ray.  I think quite =20
the contrary, I think the only person he's invalidating is himself.  =20
How anyone could spend so many hours provoking straw man arguments =20
with people, and Peter, how many times do I have to tell you about =20
just throwing links as if no one's going to actually read them.  Now =20
I want everyone to read the travel advisory, I'm posting it right =20
from the link Peter was so kind enough to share with us, and tell me =20
what sane person is going to risk driving around the US Mexico border =20=

especially around Nuevo Laredo.

Don't be alarmed, SFRavErs, just if I were you I'd avoid taking any =20
road trips in most parts of Mexico right now.

Are you a paid asset of the New World Order, Peter?

CRIME IN BORDER CITIES: Visitors to the U.S. =96 Mexico border region, =20=

including cities such as Tijuana, Ciudad Juarez, Nuevo Laredo, =20
Nogales, Reynosa and Matamoros, should remain alert and be aware of =20
their surroundings at all times.

Some border posts have seen an increase in violence over the past =20
year, some of which has been directed against U.S. citizens.  Local =20
police forces have been ineffective in maintaining security in some =20
regions along the border.  Drug-related violence has increased =20
dramatically in recent months, and shows no sign of abating.  While =20
U.S. citizens not involved in criminal activities are generally not =20
targeted, innocent bystanders are at risk from the increase in =20
violence in the streets of border cities.

In Ciudad Juarez, Nuevo Laredo and Tijuana, shootings have taken =20
place at busy intersections and at popular restaurants during =20
daylight hours.  The wave of violence has been aimed primarily at =20
members of drug trafficking organizations, criminal justice =20
officials, and journalists.  However, foreign visitors and residents, =20=

including Americans, have been among the victims of homicides and =20
kidnappings in the border region.  In recent months, the worst =20
violence has been centered in the city of Nuevo Laredo in the Mexican =20=

state of Tamaulipas, where numerous citizens were kidnapped and/or =20
murdered.  U.S. citizens are urged to be especially aware of safety =20
and security concerns when visiting the border region and exercise =20
common-sense precautions such as visiting only legitimate business =20
and tourist areas of border towns during daylight hours.

Mexican authorities have failed to prosecute numerous crimes =20
committed against American citizens, including murder and =20
kidnapping.  Local police forces suffer from a lack of funds and =20
training, and the judicial system is weak, overworked, and =20
inefficient.  Criminals, armed with an impressive array of weapons, =20
know there is little chance they will be caught and punished.  In =20
some cases, assailants have been wearing full or partial police =20
uniforms and have used vehicles that resemble police vehicles, =20
indicating some elements of the police might be involved.

Visitors are very vulnerable when visiting the local "red light =20
districts," particularly if they are departing alone in the early =20
hours of the morning.  In Ciudad Juarez and Tijuana, there has also =20
been a rise in automobile accidents in which municipal police extort =20
money from U.S. citizen victims.

Mexican military incursions reported

By Jerry Seper
THE WASHINGTON TIMES
January 17, 2006

The U.S. Border Patrol has warned agents in Arizona of incursions into the=
=20
United States by Mexican soldiers "trained to escape, evade and=20
counterambush" if detected -- a scenario Mexico denied yesterday.
     The warning to Border Patrol agents in Tucson, Ariz., comes after=20
increased sightings of what authorities described as heavily armed Mexican=
=20
military units on the U.S. side of the border. The warning asks the agents=
=20
to report the size, activity, location, time and equipment of any units=20
observed.

(follow link for rest of article.  There's quite a bit if this that goes=20
on.  I googled for Mexican Army Arizona)

Now, what bothers me about this, is that (and Deep, this is where the=20
Shatter test comes into play) if you replaced all occurances of Mexican=20
Army with U.S. Army and United States with Mexico, this article would gain=
=20
national attention, protests, Mexicans both legal and Illeagal storming the=
=20
city halls and capital builing, national protests, marches, and calls for=20
further Impeechment against Bush.

Instead, because they are on our soil (operating in a militay fashion, and=
=20
quite probably assisting the drug traffic and illeagal activity on our=20
borders) it's not a big deal and people don't have a problem with this.

http://www.ranchrescue.com/

Now while this won't be considered a reputable news source (and I'm sure=20
somebody will find something offensive somewher eto invalidate everything=20
about the site) it does document some things I've read about over the past=
=20
few years, where the Mexican Army has moved in and openerated on U.S. Soil,=
=20
on private property and harassed our citizens.

However, they do have video evidence to back up the claims.

This is some of what I'm talking about when I say to lock down the=20
boarder.  It's not that people can't travel, however how about travel=20
through areas so we can at least monitor what's going on.

The only example I can give, is to ask if you (subjective to who's reading=
=20
this) is if you have a fence around your property?  I always have, every=20
where I've lived.  Can people come over?  Sure, they use the front=20
door.  Anyone living in the house is free to come and go as they=20
please.  Guests must enter and exit through the front door.  You do not hop=
=20
the fence.  You come over at what is deemed appropriate times (4am is not=20
appropriate unless invited).

If there is a breakin, the solution isn't to remove the fences, as well at=
=20
the front and back door, and leave the windows open.  Quite the=20
opposite.  Find out how the break in happened, take steps to make sure it=20
doesn't happen again.  Perhaps better locks on the doors, better door=20
jams.  Maybe a taller fence or a top barrier to discourage hopping over=20
it.  An Alarm system?  Maybe.  In a bad neighborhood bars may be required=20
on windows, as well as a security gate for the doors leading into the house.

Do any of the security measure take away form teh freedom and quality of=20
life of those that live there?  Possible, if they go too far.  However,=20
minimal steps taken shoudn't interfere with your day to day=20
life.  Personally, I don't have problems with fences, that are on teh=20
property line.  It's orderly, and makes things very cut and dry with your=20
neighbors.  This is mine, that is yours.

right.  now getting back to the reason we were talking about the =20
border issue in the first place, Col. Ray's comment about if the war =20
on terror were something real and tangible, that right after the =20
largest terror attack, the borders would have been closed.  instead, =20
we have a literal war zone going on down there and it's being allowed =20
to happen.  so next time fox news comes out with some garbage alert =20
about reports that al-ciada was going to kidnap and behead someone, we =20
can all just laugh at it, because it's more than likely completely =20
fake to prop up a phony war.

Exactly.

Mind you, if we're going to take this all the way, then isn't it within a=20
statical probability that if the Mexican Army is willing to work with drug=
=20
runners, then you could say they're willing to work with people who don't=20
have the U.S. best interests at heart.

Blah blah blah.=0A=0AI posted two links and I read the pages linked to care=

a "consular information sheet" and it is not the same thing as a state depa=

Subject: [sfraves] custom DJ console

after much fruitless searching for a decent DJ console - not a skeezy  
carpet-covered coffin, but REAL furniture - I decided to make my own.  
I've done some furniture design/construction in the past, and I  
thought it was time to get back into it, since there's no way we can  
afford the kind of furniture we want in our new house.

I've been documenting the project, taking photos along the way:
   http://www.flickr.com/photos/44124395037@N01/sets/72157594504962030/

It should be stained and finished by the end of this weekend.

I thought I'd put the word out in case anyone here is looking for  
some custom-made DJ furniture. Send me a private message if you're  
interested.  I already have a couple people who have asked me to  
design/construct custom DJ consoles for them after seeing this one in  
progress.

after much fruitless searching for a decent DJ console - not a skeezy  
carpet-covered coffin, but REAL furniture - I decided to make my own.  
I've done some furniture design/construction in the past, and I  
thought it was time to get back into it, since there's no way we can  
afford the kind of furniture we want in our new house.

I've been documenting the project, taking photos along the way:
   http://www.flickr.com/photos/44124395037@N01/sets/72157594504962030/

It should be stained and finished by the end of this weekend.

I thought I'd put the word out in case anyone here is looking for  
some custom-made DJ furniture. Send me a private message if you're  
interested.  I already have a couple people who have asked me to  
design/construct custom DJ consoles for them after seeing this one in  
progress.

if i make one for brandon, it will have a condom dispenser for sure -  
and a lube pump.

thanks!  there are speakers inside behind the grill cloth, but the  
top flips up to expose a smallish storage area, lots of room for CDs  
- this was designed for CDJs only, so there is NO record storage  
capacity.

and for drinks (yes, i actually did consider this), there's enough  
flat space above the mixer to set your drink.

No problem...  from habit of lists and discussion, It's usually nice to 
include the first paragraph or two with the link, so in speed reading you 
can get the initial gest of the link before clicking over mid message to 
read it.

Again, he's playing at Shine tonight for free w/ Worthy & Christian Martin 
(other Dirtybird DJ's) - it's gonna be pretty badass. You just have to RSVP 
the Dirtybird people via MySpace (or maybe thru their site if they have one) 
for the GL hookup.

Otherwise I'd suggest going to Mighty ;)

Where do you plug in your iPODs?

(snicker)

VERY nicely done.  If only the clubs took that much time with their consoles.

Going that route you COULD set up a hands free condom applicator. Similar 
to the "put you junk in the box" drawing.  Load condom, stick junk throw 
hole, remove junk, tap that ass, keep mixing.

going that route covering teh whole thing with a formica or other thin 
laminate would be sweet, though you'd wanna put a few raised bits to divert 
the spilt drink flow.

Unless you're going for the natural wood look.  In that case, stock up on 
some hank williams.  ;)

you're joking, but i actually considered putting RCA in's on the top  
(just behind the mixer) so you wouldn't have to fish around  
underneath to plug in to the mixer.  not sure if i still wanna do that.

another idea:  just make the cabinet a bit larger so you could put a  
midget hooker inside.  you'd DEFINITELY need a spill-proof laminate  
on it if you go that route. (ew!)

JUST SAY NO

I've had people "guest DJ" and walk up with an Ipod and a 10 cd book.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: More tech geekery - future computing

if you read about the new intel processor architecture, you'll realize that 
the specific claim you state, that "the future won't be these multi core 
chips" with the reason "we're already seeing diminishing returns on them" 
don't jive since the question of how to get cores to swap information 
faster, is the area of development, that hasn't had much development outside 
of the 2-core range.  because of this the 4-core variants available to day 
from intel only get a 2.5 increase in computation power over the single-core 
(those are their numbers - from their website); this new multi-core 
low-power architecture is intels ploy to change all that.

what the new "farm" array of cores, along with the as-yet-fully-developed 
on-chip "network" get you is a miniparadigm of today's high-performance

software-only solution in the 8600AV.  a need was original met with a system 
external to the cpu and when the cpu became capable, the external system was

It is nothing new and continues to this day in every piece of electronic

today contains a TCP/IP checksum offload engine and high-end ones designed

if you read about the new intel processor architecture, you'll realize that 
the specific claim you state, that "the future won't be these multi core 
chips" with the reason "we're already seeing diminishing returns on them" 
don't jive since the question of how to get cores to swap information 
faster, is the area of development, that hasn't had much development outside 
of the 2-core range.  because of this the 4-core variants available to day 
from intel only get a 2.5 increase in computation power over the single-core 
(those are their numbers - from their website); this new multi-core 
low-power architecture is intels ploy to change all that.

what the new "farm" array of cores, along with the as-yet-fully-developed 
on-chip "network" get you is a miniparadigm of today's high-performance 
computer clusters: a bunch of processing units and a network for them to be 
managed and share their information with each other.

that being said, i don't think anybody is claiming this architecture to be 
"the future of computing" so stating so is a rather dubious feather in your 
cap ;)

but from a shear numbers-crunching standpoint, this area of development is 
what will make computationally-intense processing as affordable as the 
integer processing we have today.  it is technology like this that will cut 
the lifespan of our beloved 1024-bit cypher suites exponentially shorter 
than designed.

separate complete subsystems to take the main processing off the 
central-processor model, i cannot agree at all.  that is what happens today,

or a completely separate subsystem, in an effort to maintain 
user-experience, whatever that is.  it's not driven by "coolness" but by 
profit margins as they relate to the laws of supply and demand in a 
capitalistic economic system.

MAKERS! CRAFTERS! SCIENTISTS! ARTISTS! ENGINEERS!

Come one, Come all to The TechShop in Menlo Park on February 24th!
Make Magazine is hosting an audition for Maker Faire 2007 and every  
free-thinking, out of the box, DIY experimenter is welcome to attend  
and present projects, display performances and demonstrate, operate,  
create anything you want!

TechShop
http://www.techshop.ws
120 Independence Drive
Menlo Park, Ca 94025

We are doing auditions to make it easy for makers to show us their  
work. Make and Craft editors Dale Dougherty, David Pescovitz and  
Natalie Zee Drieu will be there.

You can think of these auditions as more like Dorkbot meetings.  
Anyone is welcome to come watch. We ask Makers to go up in front of  
the audience and present their project in under 10 minutes. This will  
be a fun, friendly and supportive event.

If you are planning to come audition, please contact Natalie at  
natalie@oreilly.com. Come show us what you love to make.

For more information please check out http://www.makerfaire.com

Maker Faire 2007:

Organized by the staff of Make and Craft magazines, Maker Faire is a  
newfangled fair that brings together science, art, craft and  
engineering in a fun, energized, and exciting public forum. The aim  
is to inspire people of all ages to roll up their sleeves and become  
makers. This family-friendly event showcases the amazing work of all  
kinds of makers--anyone who is embracing DIY and wants to share their  
accomplishments with an appreciative audience. Last year, we had  
20,000 people at Maker Faire.

Maker Faire Bay Area will take place May 19-20, 2007 at the San Mateo  
Fairgrounds. We are also adding Maker Faire Austin for October 20 &  
21, 2007 at the Travis County Fairgrounds. This call is primarily for  
Maker Faire Bay Area but you can indicate if you are interested in  
participating in Maker Faire Austin.

We encourage you to join the fun and propose a maker exhibit,  
performance or workshop. http://www.makerfaire.com

I'd Rather Be A Matin' Than A Hatin' ~ Me

"Now, 75 years later in an abundant society where people have
laptops,cellphones, iPods and minds like empty rooms, I still plod
along with books." ~ Harper Lee, 2006

"There aren't a lot of things in this world that one can be sure
of, but I do know this; anytime you go by a House of Worship, of any
size, and of any denomination, that's filled to its rafters with
people, you can be certain that the vast majority of those people
haven't actually taken the time out to read The Bible, or whatever
ancient, "Sacred Text" that they subscribe to, because if they had read
it, and comprehended it, then that House of Worship would be nearly
empty." ~Nyc Alberts, NYC, October, 2006

"Ha ha!  Ever had the feeling you've been cheated?" ~ J. Lydon, SF, 1978

I'd Rather Be A Matin' Than A Hatin' ~ Me

"Now, 75 years later in an abundant society where people have
laptops,cellphones, iPods and minds like empty rooms, I still plod
along with books." ~ Harper Lee, 2006

"There aren't a lot of things in this world that one can be sure
of, but I do know this; anytime you go by a House of Worship, of any
size, and of any denomination, that's filled to its rafters with
people, you can be certain that the vast majority of those people
haven't actually taken the time out to read The Bible, or whatever
ancient, "Sacred Text" that they subscribe to, because if they had read
it, and comprehended it, then that House of Worship would be nearly
empty." ~Nyc Alberts, NYC, October, 2006

hello sfr...

i have a leopard gecko that i'm giving away..i thought i offer it to my friends first before i put it out on craigslist..or other boards..

i originally had it for my classroom, but since i gave up teaching...it's at home with me...i hate to give him away...but i don't have time for him anymore...i prefer to give him to a home where he would be getting more attention...

my gecko is a real sweetheart...he comes with a tank..food dish, water dish, heat pad, a lil cave of his own, a cactus for when he sheds, he has new white sand, and some meal worms...also some vitamin stuff to shake the meal worms in..

please let me know if your interested...

love & light
adriana

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) QOD (Mon)

So I've got about 30 quotes lined up and I looked at them this morning =20
and didn't find any that really blazed out to me as great ones for =20
Monday, President's Day.  Quite frankly I'd rather be thinking about =20
one of those tasty DJ consoles for my place.  Actually, one of my =20
decks is disassembled waiting to send off to get tuned up at this =20
place in Texas nstuff.

Anyway, why not just start from the top of the list.  Screw it.  =20
Here's one of the perhaps biggest smoking guns that 9/11 may actually =20
have been a total inside job.  Flame suit activated.

If anyone has any questions, refer to this online video:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DV7Vs7KNlpXU&eurl=3D

...during the time that the plane coming into the Pentagon, there was
a young man who would come in and say to the Vice President, he would
come in and say "the plane is 50 miles out ... the plane is 30 miles
out," and when he got to "the plane is 10 miles out", the young man
also said to the Vice President, "do the orders still stand?"  And the
Vice President turned, and whipped his neck around and said, "of
course the orders still stand!  Have you heard anything to the
contrary?"

- Norman Mineta, Transportation Secretary, testifying for the National
Commission on the 9/11 attacks

I'd Rather Be A Matin' Than A Hatin' ~ Me

"Now, 75 years later in an abundant society where people have
laptops,cellphones, iPods and minds like empty rooms, I still plod
along with books." ~ Harper Lee, 2006

"There aren't a lot of things in this world that one can be sure
of, but I do know this; anytime you go by a House of Worship, of any
size, and of any denomination, that's filled to its rafters with
people, you can be certain that the vast majority of those people
haven't actually taken the time out to read The Bible, or whatever
ancient, "Sacred Text" that they subscribe to, because if they had read
it, and comprehended it, then that House of Worship would be nearly
empty." ~Nyc Alberts, NYC, October, 2006

"Ha ha!  Ever had the feeling you've been cheated?" ~ J. Lydon, SF, 1978

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: Transmission @ Blake's - Thursday!

i'm guessing that for most of you SFR folk, Blake's on Telegraph is a
place where getting down to electronic music on a weeknight is only a
sweet memory.  well, no longer.  Thursday nights have a new weekly
event with rotating genres.

this Thursday is breaks!  i'll be playing from 12-1am.  it's only $2
for you old folks.

although it's not Ascension, i have many fond memories of going to
Blake's.  i believe i first met Michael Stickman there (when he had
long hair).  bought a ticket to a Vibration party from Ryan while
standing outside.

hope to see some of you there!

Save How Weird!


The How Weird Street Faire needs our help right now, and if we don't =20
act soon, we will be mourning its loss instead of freaking each other =20=

in the streets to all sorts of crazy beats, like we should be on the =20
first Sunday in May. Earlier this month, the Faire organizers were =20
denied a new permit, despite their 100% safety record. Apparently =20
10,000 happy people celebrating SF art, culture, and the great urban =20
outdoors isn't everyone in the area's cup of tea. However, lots of =20
neighbors, ravers, artists, DJs, and groovers love the annual =20
jubilee, and they are all sending letters and emails to the the =20
Department of Parking and Traffic, before the appeal hearing takes =20
place on Thursday.

Visit the How Weird site to sign the petition as well as get the =20
letter template. Send your letters in by email or fax by Tuesday, and =20=

do your part to get How Weird back out on the pavement where it =20
should be this spring! We deserve it.

Date: send in your letter by Tuesday 2/20, public hearing on Thursday =20=

2/22, Time: hearing @ 10am, Place: 1 South Van Ness Avenue, 7th =20
Floor, Cover: no cover, =EF=BF=BCMore Info. (DKD)

I also want to mention that I live about 1.5 blocks away. Needless to 
say that since i do not live in the city anymore, its quite exciting to 
get a walking distance weekly once again.

Triple filtered vodka drinks before hand if you want it (this weekend is 
my birthday). Shoot me an email if you want to drop by.

I'm doing this from memory so correct me if I'm wrong.

Day after day
Alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer but

The fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning 'round

I'd Rather Be A Matin' Than A Hatin' ~ Me

"Now, 75 years later in an abundant society where people have
laptops,cellphones, iPods and minds like empty rooms, I still plod
along with books." ~ Harper Lee, 2006

"There aren't a lot of things in this world that one can be sure
of, but I do know this; anytime you go by a House of Worship, of any
size, and of any denomination, that's filled to its rafters with
people, you can be certain that the vast majority of those people
haven't actually taken the time out to read The Bible, or whatever
ancient, "Sacred Text" that they subscribe to, because if they had read
it, and comprehended it, then that House of Worship would be nearly
empty." ~Nyc Alberts, NYC, October, 2006

Thats so funny. when i used to do meth, we would go to the superwalmart, only in the middle of the night of corse, and ALL the torches would be gone. I dont mean the boxes, i mean other tweekers mustve been taking them out of the boxes and leaving the other parts that werent tweeker ready. (i dont even know what the hell you use those things for besides blowing clouds.) EVERY time we wanted to steal one, they were already gone.......
   
  the fetish idea sounds pretty fun

I will even overlook that you were at Walmart and buying Purina.

\m/ \m/


My favorite thing to do in the old days of super tweaking was for several 
of us to get completely fetish'd out in black rubber and go shopping at 
Walmart @ 3am. The staff was not even sneaky. They would be on the 
loudspeaker, telling their friends what isle the girls were in. Nobody 
could take their eyes off us. 3-4 in Fetishwear would be enough to distract 
teh entire warehouse.

That's when the other friend would be robbing them blind - snatch & grab 
like mad. Nota fet things, but loading the backpack and pockets, going to 
the car, unloading, and returning.

Ah the things you do on meth....

I'd Rather Be A Matin' Than A Hatin' ~ Me

"Now, 75 years later in an abundant society where people have
laptops,cellphones, iPods and minds like empty rooms, I still plod
along with books." ~ Harper Lee, 2006

"There aren't a lot of things in this world that one can be sure
of, but I do know this; anytime you go by a House of Worship, of any
size, and of any denomination, that's filled to its rafters with
people, you can be certain that the vast majority of those people
haven't actually taken the time out to read The Bible, or whatever
ancient, "Sacred Text" that they subscribe to, because if they had read
it, and comprehended it, then that House of Worship would be nearly
empty." ~Nyc Alberts, NYC, October, 2006

I'm reading Pat Buchanan's State of Emergency right now.  I used to =20
think he was one of those racist Republicans but I heard him being =20
interviewed on both Alex Jones and KQED's Forum, and I have backed =20
away from that point of view quite a bit.  His book contains a lot of =20
factual information about illegal immigration and he has this =20
interesting quote from an unexpected source that backs up his =20
philosophy.

I would also add my own personal opinion that this not only applies to =20
the illegal immigrants, but this might also apply to a lot of us that =20
have been pushed more and more into finding jobs rather than starting =20
businesses.  I strongly feel we need more entrepeneurs right now in =20
this country in order to survive.

There is nothing more dangerous than to build a society, with a large =20
segment of the people in that society, who feel that they have no =20
stake in it; who feel that they have nothing to lose.  People who have =20
a stake in their society, protect that society, but when they don't =20
have it, they unconsciously want to destroy it.

I know ALL about pwn'd.

However, in this case, owned is far more appropriate, as Paul McCartney has 
to pay Mr Jackson royalties when he performs a beatles song.

That's just wrong.

Pwn'd is:

I'm sure somebody with the drive to google or dig will corect me on this, 
but IIRC, in 1900 2% of all businesses in the United States were 
Corporations.  In 2000 98% of all businesses were corporations.

As such, 98% of the working force are employeed by corporations.  That 
doesn't leave a lot of room for ownership or personal stake in a business 
or the community it's located in.

Everyone takes shots at Walmart, and with good reason.  They're one of the 
largest conglomerates of community destorying parasites operating in teh 
country today.  They claim to help communities by creating jobs, but the 
reality is they treat their employee'd like shit, and the community like 
shit.  They low ball all the existing brick and mortor into bankruptcy, 
then slowly creep the prices back up. They flatly refuse to purchase from 
any distributor that isn't using chinese labor to create dirt cheap 
goods.  They use their market force and distribution channels to censor 
products and medicine they do't agree with.  They won't carry certain 
suthors or CD's in their stores if it's not "approved".  They proport 
capitalism and democracy while pushing an agenda that would have made any 
1960's communist block dictator cum in his pants.

ya...  I'm ranting.

DJ's:
 
DJ Miles Maeda (Ouvre, Aroma, Apt Entertainment)--Los Angeles/Chicago
 
Miles Maeda was one of the pioneering members of Chicago's scene in the
early '90s, putting out a slew of now legendary mixtapes that inspired many
a young aspiring dj.  Miles has since grown to be a favorite dj of many,
known for his precise mixing skills and poised presence behind the decks.
Sharing a residency at Chicago's Smartbar alongside Justin Long and DJ
Heather, travelling the world to share his  music with everyone, and
consistently putting out top notch tracks keeps Miles very busy.  We are

Brown (Drop Music, Aroma, Mobile Trax)--Nottingham, UK
 
Nottingham based vocalist and producer, Brown is one of the key players in

Sunlounge, Andrew Phelan & Origami, and Bryan Jones, Brown has put tracks
out on many a hot label such as Drop, Mobile Trax, Aroma, Myna, Prismatic,

everybody grooving, and we are happy to welcome him back for Round Two for
another dj set featuring himself on live vocals.

Andrew Phelan & Origami (Prismatic, Drop Music, So Sound)
 
One of SF's fastest growing duos in both the DJ and production realms,
Andrew and Origami put down some serious business.  The boys tore it up at

live bass keeping the speakers booming and your bodies moving!

Eric Sharp (Rock It Science)
 
Founder of the Rock It Science crew, Eric Sharp has quickly built a name for
himself with his infectious energy behind the decks and the versatility to
rock any party. Eric's opening set at Electric Blue got everybody going just
right.  This time Eric will throw down a Fire Engine Red closing set,
leaving everybody begging for more and heading for the Endup.
www.myspace.com/ericsharp
 
Rob Crush (Crush Collective)
 
Buckle up San Francisco!  Rob Crush seems to be everywhere at once,
spreading the good word about some of our city's favorite parties.  What you
may not know about Rob is that he has secretly been honing his craft, mixing
records deep within the bowels of a dj research laboratory covered by a
biotechnology front.  You are going to wonder why you haven't heard from Rob
sooner, and we look forward to seeing him get a lot more action on the
decks!

Actually- if you had ever read any business text about why Wal-Mart  
is so profitable while simultaneously offering low prices that are  
tough for others to beat, you would see that it is due to their  
innovation in to-store distribution.  They only accept full  
truckloads of goods to their distribution centers, and trucks full of  
all kinds of different products arrive at the same time.  Then they  
unload all the stuff, mix it up, and put the same load of mixed goods  
right back on every truck- which then goes and delivers it's load to  
a single store.  Not only greatly simplifying inventory and  
warehousing, the primary savings is... wait for it... fuel!  Not only  
does this make Wal-Mart's operating costs lower, it conserves fossil  
fuels and decreases pollution.  How does that taste in your pipe when  
you're smoking it?

> They flatly refuse to purchase from any distributor that isn't  
> using chinese labor to create dirt cheap goods.

That's absurd- I've done no formal research, but I've done a lot of  
shopping at a lot of places in my years.  And in my estimation, Wal- 
Mart is a retailer that has a *very* high percentage of "Made in USA"  
products- far above average.  They don't sell Chinese cast-iron  
cookware, they sell Lodge.  Ever bought a hobo-pie maker?  They sell  
the original, not a foreign knockoff.  Sure they've got their share  
of imported goods (the $1.35 sandals I bought in CO were a bargain,  
wherever they were made), but even in the main area you would expect  
to find them (apparel), they still have a high percentage of stuff  
that's made here.  Go in to any other big store and look at the  
"commodity" stuff- things like clothes hangers, kid's bikes, laundry  
baskets, kitchen utensils etc- and you will find the same thing- some  
things are just simply much cheaper when made overseas.  But witness  
just those couple examples I listed- where Wal-Mart has a realistic  
choice, they seem to choose the items from domestic manufacturers.

> They won't carry certain authors or CD's in their stores if it's  
> not "approved".

Are you saying that Wal-Mart doesn't have the right to choose to sell  
whatever the hell it pleases, and conversely *not* sell things it  
doesn't agree with?
If I'm a bookstore and I refuse to sell Mein Kampf, are you going to  
be upset?

Yeah, I got to side with the late, and great, Molly Ivins on this one 
when she said that Pat Buchanan "sounds better in the original German".

haven't actually taken the time out to read The Bible, or whatever

I got me a green version of this 
http://www.navystuff.com/osc/eshop/images/navy06-L.JPG from a local 
Dollar Store.

The really cool thing about it?

The label inside says "Made In China".

I love showing it to soldiers that are in uniform, just so they know 
who, and what, they're really fighting for.

Xin Nian Kuai Le!

Wal-Mart's main goal today, when it comes to its employees, is to 
eliminate them, because they cost too much, and it will happen for most 
of them over the course of the next decade due to advances in automated 
and robotic systems, both in the back and front-end, and wholesale the 
adoption of RFID.

And it won't just be Wal-Mart, but pretty much every business in the 
service sector that does this, if they wish to remain in business,, 
which means millions of "jobs" will evaporate overnight, with no new 
jobs to take their place.

By the time 2020 rolls around, the America you live in today will 
completely unrecognizable.

The irony is that they are technically a criminal when they enter this 
country as their manner of entry is a crime, regardless of previous 
record.  If this wern't the case there would be nothing "illegal" about them.

You want a cookie or something?

For the record, Walmart hasn't personally hurt me.  However, and I dare say 
unlike you, I'm looking at the larger picture, and not my own personal 
anecdotel experience.  YMMV.

You know how hard it is to find US/US made military fatigues?

Many are US material, assembled outside of US, most are all made outside of 
US.  The US/US ones last slightly longer than those made outside, but 
they're usually a better fit.

It'd be really great to have some creative people from the rave scene  
come out and demonstrate some cool projects that I know you're  
working on. This community is overflowing with engineers, artists,  
crafters and scientists and the audition this Saturday would be a  
great opportunity to have some time with the Make Magazine staff and  
get some publicity for Maker Faire coming in May 19th and 20th at the  
San Mateo County Fairgrounds.

On Saturday, February 24th, Make Magazine will be holding open  
auditions for Maker Faire from 10 am to 2pm at TechShop in Menlo  
Park.   We will also consider the best project for a future issue of  
Make magazine. In addition, a NY-based film crew will be on-hand to  
record this session.

  	If you would like to demonstrate a project at the February 24th  
audition, please contact me, Natalie Villalobos by email  
(natalie@oreilly.com) so we can put you on the schedule.



P.S. COME OUT TO TONAL TOMORROW NIGHT!

Everyone incorporates to avoid personal lawsuit.  Heaven forbid that they 
put theor own personal integrity on the line.

Much better to incorporate and havve no blame, guilt or liability for your 
actions.

"It wasn't me, it was the corporation!  Punish the corp!"

What I'm finding funny on this list, is when the hell did a bunch of PLUR 
loving ravers suddenly become a bunch of republican capitalists?

I think I have a great solution for voting from now on.  We can adjust for 
region, but say for California it'll go like this:

If you make less than 30K and or are on any Gov't program: Democrat
30K - 50K:  Libertarian
50K+   Republican

I think I've answered my own question and explained how trancers took 
over.  *snort*

I think your demographics of income are way off there shatter!  SF and Marin
county are both Democratic strongholds with larger populations of high wage
earners...   50K ain't really that much anymore....  And according to your
rule, most people I know should be republicans.... and they're definitely
not!     Cuz if this was true, SF and Marin should be republican strongholds
and places like fresno should be true blue democrat.  I think most people
underestimate the complexities of the political landscape, yes income and
education are factors, but there are several places across the country where
such general theories get turned on their head...  Why does connecticut have
a strong presence of republicans, and why is it the opposite in SF or
Boston?  Why is marin county a strong majority democrats, but orange county
the opposite despite a much larger minority population?

All of this reminded me of one of the most absurd things I've heard- This
guy was an evangelical minister from Seattle, and like a good evangelical he
preached that using birth control/condoms was against God's will. The guy
had a family of like 9 and had no intentions of stopping anytime soon, one
of the reasons he and his wife didn't practice birth control was to birth
more children  to counter the democratic voting black in seattle... to me
that just seemed insane.  What baffles me even more is how Jesus' teachings
run counter to so much of what the Republican party stands for.

Jesus' teachings run counter to most of what Christians in today's world 
stand for. Pretty fucking sad IMHO.

Actually- if you had ever read any business text about why Wal-Mart -  
whoa! deja-vu there! I mean- why corporations are formed, you would  
see that it has nothing to do with personal integrity.  Corporations  
provide protection against personal liability for debt and lawsuits,  
as well as tax benefits- but in the case of criminal behavior this  
corporate veil is easily pierced and people are held personally  
responsible. (See Enron)  Nothing to do with personal integrity, and  
everything to do with outrageous awards, frivolous lawsuits, and  
circumstances beyond your control.
See Tort Reform: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort_reform

I think it was when they stopped using PLUR as a naive-to-the-world  
starry-eyed statement of some kind, and instead started thinking  
about how to really achieve what it means.

Also- because I can't resist- the values you promote above-  
"liability for your actions", "personal integrity"- those are  
Republican ideals.  Democrats favor social assistance instead of  
personal responsibility.  PLUR!

Well, if you truly believe in these Republican ideals, it does beg the 
question as to why aren't you serving your country in uniform in Iraq 
right now?

I'm sure your local military recruiter will applaud your decision to 
take some "personal responsibility" and follow through with the words 
that come out of your mouth and take some real action and support our 
troops by, y'know being one.

Otherwise, you can say what you want here, and it will carry as much 
cred as it does.

And, btw, can't help but to ask you, what was the deal with the November 
2006 elections?

Has the entire country gone over the wiberal deep-end, or is it that we 
just got fed-up with the lies of the Republican Party?

Take your time.

As a matter of fact- I am in Iraq, and in uniform as I type this.
Hoo-ahh!

I only jest- I would join the military only if they could guarantee  
me a position as a fighter pilot- but they can't.
And well- I have a strong distaste for authority- so I reserve my  
talents for more pleasurable ventures.

But I'm in full "support of the troops"- because I know it's not  
their fault that a few misguided assholes with some unknown agenda  
sent them over there to participate in a big sand-filled jackoff.   
But while they're forced to be there, I'll send them my old Maxim  
magazines and such, because I'm sure they're not having much fun at all.

Don't confuse Republican ideals with the sorry state that the  
Republican Party has become.
I have as much contempt for them as anyone you could talk do-
The Republican Party has been infiltrated by the Religious Right, and  
have done nothing but increase the size, scope, and intrusiveness of  
government- totally contrary to Republican ideals.

If you're curious where I stand politically, I would call myself a  
small-L libertarian.
The Libertarian Party is a joke, too full of conspiracy wackos to be  
ever taken seriously.
The group I am most aligned with is the Republican Liberty Caucus.
We realize that as long as we remain in a partisan VS parliamentary  
system, third parties do not have a chance of making any difference  
whatsoever, and instead work within the Republican Party to advance  
those with Libertarian, and genuine Republican ideals.

It would be too much effort to try to get all attendees to sign my NDA :(

i've got an iDog that hacked with an iTrip so that he would pull himself 
across the carpet to scratch is butt everytime they played a Justin 
Timberlake song on the radio - does that count ?

Um, unless you haven't been paying attention - for SF not being anywhere 
CLOSE to the UK, which is where half these folks are from, next month alone 
we are getting:

Meat Katie & Dylan Rhymes, 30Hz, Krafty Kuts, Soul Of Man, Kraak & Smaak, 
Deekline & Wizard (or maybe just Deekline), etc.

And that's just the last 2 weekends in March. This weekend there's the 
Raindance party w/ Bassbin Twins, The Glitch Mob, Jonah Sharp vs. 
Mr.Projectile, etc.

I think our breaks scene here pretty much kicks fucking ass.

And considering it's not even summer (or even Spring) yet....that's hot as 
shit. You have no idea what yer in for this year as far as breaks, 
tech-funk, dubstep, etc. is concerned.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] nrr: poop & our enviroment

we humans shit into our water supply - and then process it with potable 
water! - in the name of "hygiene".  seems a little wrong, no?

for a household of 4 people, that's 11,680 gallons of water wasted per 
year, and that's using a low-flow toilet.

i'm definitely getting a composting toilet system for our new house, 
but at $1500+, it's not something i can afford to install yet.

gonna get one of these, too: http://www.waterless.com/

hey, bravo, let's encourage people to go be a potential human  
sacrifice in the red zone.  or maybe they'll get lucky and be in the  
green zone, where they have electricity and plenty of halliburton sex  
slaves to go around.  great thinking.  i think i'll run out and buy a  
made in china support our troops magnet just for the occasion.

Subject: [sfraves] moving help needed!

if any of you have a couple hours to spare, say from noonish - 3 pm, we 
could really use some help moving.

i've already taken 5 van-loads of boxes over, so the bulk of what's 
left (and what we really need help with) is the big furniture items.  1 
or 2 medium-to-large guys would be best to help me move the big stuff.  
i don't want araya to hurt herself trying to help me move furniture.

give me a call - 415 255 9776.  we're in north oakland, and moving only 
1 mile away, so it'll be quick.

thanks,
philip & araya

March Forth!

 

A beach cleanup and gathering of your friends & groovy tunes with: 

Donna Matrix (rEvolution, Panda Rejects) 

Alxndr(Downlow)

DJ Goyo (Uptempo Productions)

 

+ a bonfire to keep you toasty as the sun goes down! We're raising awareness
about a sustainable Ocean Beach and having some fun in the process.

 

When: Sunday March 4th, 2:00-7:30 pm

What: Beach Cleanup with good friends + a groovin' afterparty
Where: Ocean Beach, stairway 20
Why: Ocean Beach needs our help! Irresponsible burning and littering leave
OB covered in litter. You and your friends can help by lending a few hours
of your time for a good cause.
Who: All are welcome. Make new friends, clean up the beach. Enroll as many
people as you can to join us!

RSVP here:  <http://tinyurl.com/3bbxno> http://tinyurl.com/3bbxno

 

Schedule

2:00 Meet at stairway 20, just down from the sand dunes at Lincoln Ave. and
Great Highway
     - A member of our team will provide you with garbage bags and gloves
(we'll have a table set up)
4:00 Cleanup complete
4:30 DJ's start spinning records
4:30-7:30 Par-tay (Alxndr, Goyo and Donna Matrix!)
6:00 Sunset 

7:30 Party winds down-- everybody lends a hand to clean up

 

Bonfire-DJ's-drumming-marshmallows-good peeps...a beach party in March!

 

 * Bring warmish clothing for daylight and afterdaylight. Bring your own
food and refreshments to keep hydrated. Bring hot dogs or marshmallows and a
coat hanger to use to roast them! We'll also be taking donations for the
Ocean Beach Foundation which is working to build fire rings at Ocean Beach
to ensure responsible burning.

 

Note: it is the Ocean Beach policy not to have alcoholic beverages on the
beach. If some should happen to appear, they should be in non-descript
plastic containers. For more on responsible beach fire policies please click
<http://www.nps.gov/goga/parkmgmt/upload/firemanagement_oceanbeach_fireregs_
20031204.pdf>  here.

Don't worry, we'll be returning to the dirtiest of conspiracies soon.

I heard from a lot of people that a lot of people attended Matt's  
funeral.  I only met him a few times.  I would have come to the  
funeral if I were there in the Bay Area.  Hopefully you guys  
celebrated his life and remember the good times.

Here is a forwarded message from the owner of Kink.com, a BDSM porn site. As
many of you may or may not know, Kink.com recently purchased the historic
Armory and are planning to use it for movie productions. There are some
naysayers who are trying to protest this and there will be a hearing about
it soon.

*********************

 Hi Everyone,



As you know, we have come under a certain amount of heat for buying the
Armory to use for movie production.



Despite the fact that the Planning Department agreed to our use prior to the
purchase, the Mayor pressured them into holding a public hearing on March 8
th 10-12:30 in City Hall, room 416.



This is an 'informational meeting' designed to hear community feedback, and
there will be no vote.  However, in order to prevent the city from
attempting to rezone the Armory, It is important that we show up in force
and that we outnumber the protesters, so please save the date! We will send
out more information nearer the time.



Cheers

Peter

The mayor was probably screwing someone elses wife or fabricating a drinking 
problem to skirt the bad press about the former when Kink.com's use grant 
papers came through for his signature.

Wasn't the initial fight from the community because the building was  
going to be used for more housing? I remember the whole community  
fighting the permits for construction, due to the noise, etc.  
Kink.com moved in because the city was slow and Kink wasn't doing any  
new building, thus slipped in not needing permits.

http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/02/01/ 
EDGC7N768I1.DTL&hw=kink&sn=008&sc=314

"For decades, politicians and neighborhood activists have rejected or  
neglected well-laid plans for the massive building. Now the  
neighborhood is getting back some of that hostility in the form of  
Kink.com, the on-line fetish porn Web site, which bought the building  
quickly and quietly last month and plans to start filming as soon as  
possible. Because the new owners won't be making any structural  
changes to the building, they've been able to bypass the Planning  
Department -- and all the requisite delays, obstacles and public  
obstinateness. "

"thus slipped in not needing permits."

Kink.com hasn't slipped in all sneaky like. The Planning Department has
known about all the details of this for awhile and everything has been
permitted and signed. This isn't like people in city government looked on
the desk one day and said "Well dang! Those porno folks sure did trick us!"

The only difference now is that the mass media has gotten wind of the deal
and are having the expected outcry over anything sexual. The hearing they
are having isn't anything decisive, but a forum for people to voice their
opinions. But, there will most likely be protesters there shouting about
"moral decline" and "Family values" and the like. Sex seems to really make
people freak out, even though no one will be able to go in there or even see
what goes on from the outside.

Subject: [sfraves] fresno scene?

Fresno just for a night. I know, i know, fresno....

can treat it like a 1-night vacation, ya know? =)
if you have any ideas, let me know! it will be greatly
appreciated!!!
thanx all

 From what I gathered from Peter they're going to use the armory for 
mainstream movies, at least in part.

There will also be opprotunities for large gathering events there...

This alone should make everyone on this list very happy...

Does kink.com own the Porn Palace? They do a ton of parties there.

Question:  After looking at kink.com's material, do you think there
would be an outcry if they did more traditional porn?  How much 
of this controversy is due to kink.com using pain, electric shocks,
water torture, etc. on their female performs?

The driveway to the garage in my house slopes down rather steeply, with 
an ever increasing ledge to it's side as a result.  One night I came 
home to a guy sitting on the ledge getting a blowjob from his 
girlfriend.  Couldn't help but think to myself "good job" as I walked by 
and continued up the steps to the front door.

(The U.S. is too damn puritanical.)

Kink.com operates out of the porn palace.  Semantics, eyc.  There's about a 
dozen sub sites that operate there that all have the same owner.  ;)

By traditional, I was lead to believe a bit of non pornographic films shot 
at the armory.  Making it available for rent to hollywood and independent 
places, etc.

They throw parties at the PP all the time, how ever you could throw one 
hell of a rave at the armory.

If you're referring to the possible corruption of youth, let me ask: how?
How will any kids in the neighborhood be corrupted? They can't get inside
the building and they can't see anything. The most that will happen is that
they might walk by the brick monolith and point and giggle from across the
street.

I understood his suggestion.  I'd be more uneasy having a child have to 
experience a fight/stabbing/...  out of the blue than sex.  Wouldn't 
you?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Help SF Stay Kinky!

i forgot that logical reasoning doesn't play into account here in the sfr 
twilight zone - my bad  :)

your question is a completely separate topic but to answer it, i would agree 
with you that if my child were forced to observe either a) a man getting a 
blowjob, b) a [street] fight, or c) a stabbing, i would slide my #2 pencil 
into the "a" box.

this answer doesn't change my viewpoint regarding your previous experience. 
no counter-speculation will make me agree with your assessment that one 
should be okay with coming home to observe a random stranger giving a 
blowjob in their driveway unless I am the one getting the blowjob !

-=dave

blow jobs are g r a t e !

Which brings me right back to my original comment of the day, that the 
U.S. is too damn puritanical.

And it signals time for a joke (but you better close your eyes SE/30. 
Wouldn't want to offend.)
Little Johnnie walks in on his mom and dad makin love.

Johnnie asks: Mom, what are you doing?

Mom: Umm...uh...Im....um....Daddy gets full of air sometimes and i gotta 
let some out....

Dad: Yeah. Thats what she's doing.

Johnnie: Well mom, thats a waste of time cuz the lady next-door's just 
gonna blow him back up again.....

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Help SF Stay Kinky! - sex jokes !

if thinking that young children shouldn't be taught that public display of 
fornication should be as uneventful as a common handshake makes me 
"puritanical" then by your definition, I am... wholeheartedly.

i want to educate my future child (if any) about all things in life at the 
same pace as their capacity to understand them.  i don't want my elementary 
school teacher or transients in my driveway doing it for me cause it 
invariably breeds misinformation.  a child should get the straight skinny 
from their parents!

like so:

-------------
A little girl came home from school excited and told her mom she had learned 
where babies come. Amused, her mother replied, "Really, sweetie? Where?"

The little girl explained, "Well... OK... the mommy and daddy take their 
clothes off, and the daddy's thing sort of stands up, and the mommy puts it 
in her mouth, and then it sort of explodes, and that's where babies come 
from!"

Her mom shook her head, leaned over to meet her daughter eye to eye, and 
said, "Oh, honey, that's sweet, but that's not where babies come from. 
That's where jewelry comes from."

Actually, that is puritanical. When the Puritans settled here and
encountered the Natives they were horrified at the sexual practices they
engaged in. It was very common amongst Natives for young children to
masturbate in the open or teenagers and adults to have sex where people
could see them and it was no big thing. The journals of some later explorers
are pretty funny when they describe native sexual culture, but the sad side
is that they used the differences in sexual practices to legitimize killing
them and stealing their lands, because anyone who lets children see sex is
obviously an incurable savage.

Nice joke though.

I'm also describing people who were syphilis free until the European
settlers came over. Would you rather live in a syphilis free world or a
wheel free world back then? I would pick the syphilis free one, because a
lack of wheels doesn't cause widespread death.

As nice as it is to see this conversation get derailed completely, if you do
care about what's going on with kink.com, please save the date of March 8th.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Help SF Stay Kinky! - sex jokes !

If you feel that way, then I'd suggest staying the fuck out of Europe, 
where full frontal male and female nudity is constantly used in 
advertising, in print, and during "prime time" on the TeeBee, because if 
you saw that, then your head might explode in righteous indignation, 
like then FCC Chairman's Michael Powell's almost did when he almost got 
a peek at Janet Jackson's big bad boobie during the SuperBowl a few 
years back.

That was pretty funny.

I never thought I'd ever agree with anyone that works at AEI, with the 
exception of Stormin' Norman Ornstein, but when this total hottie of a 
guest of Bill Maher's, Ayaan Hirsi Ali, (from Holland, by way of 
Somalia), asked, "When will Americans ever grow up?" on the show last 
Friday night, I couldn't help but to agree with her.

This thread just reinforces that sentiment.

I've been saying for the last few weeks that we Americans have the 
collective emotional maturity of a 14 year old, but now I see that I 
need to revise that downward to about the age of 12, since that's prolly 
more accurate.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Help SF Stay Kinky! - sex jokes !

agreeing with a single Puritan ideal does not a Puritan make :)

however, regarding what is "puritan", what ideals are Puritan, and what 
ideals are normatively accepable to different cultures, i am not living in a 
tribal community of hunter-gatherers.  my normative ideals would be quite 
different if i were... which reminds me of an old (OLD !)  joke that 
everyone has heard a million times !

--------------
A young man in a tribal north american native community had the opportunity 
to speak candidly with the high cheif after a newborn's "naming" ceremony. 
The boy asked the very old cheif, "how do you come up with the names for all 
of us?"  the cheif replied, "when a child is born, that night i meditate in 
my teepee and the first thing i see when i emerge in the morning is what i 
name the newborn.  When your father was born, in the morning i saw an eagle 
gliding high above the desert and so he was named Soaring Eagle.  When your 
mother was born, I saw a dear bounding carelessly through the snow , and so 
she was named Prancing Doe.  Why do you ask, Two Dogs Fucking ?"

You're forgetting alcohol and tuberculosis- but... they gave us tobacco.
So- the overall "death score"? I think I call it even :)

Sorry to derail your thread, I am in full support of kink.com and the  
armory, not because of any "helping SF stay kinky", but because of  
simple property-use rights :)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Help SF Stay Kinky! - sex jokes !

i attempted to convert a lame sub-thread about someone getting their dick 
sucked in a driveway into a joke thread and nobody bit... just a barage of 
"down with you" intolerant bullshit just because I expressed I wouldn't 
appreciate someone getting a blowjob in my driveway.

i think you're the rigid ones who can't accept the right of someone else to 
have a different opinion.

also, i'm surprised it took you this long to join into a thread mr alberts. 
seems a thread can't go 3 or 4 responses these days before you have to chime 
your complelete non-related $0.02 in about it.   isn't it about time for you 
call "Godwin" ?

go eat a dick in your driveway :)

On the contrary, we've had very similar experiences growing up-

Maybe it's a "grower" versus "shower" thing?
In that, my lack of knowledge as to the size of either my dad's, or  
my brother's cock- is due to the fact that in every instance that  
said cocks were present, neither were in a "raging erection" state.
Further, it was never a point of fascination for me to estimate any  
erect size based on flaccid size- sure when I was 4yo I looked up and  
thought "gee mine's much smaller"- but uh- that's about it.
I guess you could put it as- I didn't care, and it was simply the  
furthest thing from my mind.
Perhaps this is the difference between our experiences...

Answering J.C. as well for brevity's sake:

"Likely, but would he admit to it in public, or would he be embarrased?"

What am I not admitting to?  What am I embarrassed about?
That I never participated in any teenaged circle jerk?
Guilty as charged.
That this is atypical?
I have absolutely no insight in to the sexual upbringing of other  
little boys-
So- uhh- I guess "guilty as charged" again?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Help SF Stay Kinky! - sex jokes !

Hey, Dave, you're welcome.

I'd gladly oblige your demand to suck myself off in my driveway, but 
unfortunately I'm not double jointed in my hips.

If I were, I'd not only never leave the house, but I wouldn't bother 
with going online.

Would you?

Saying that when it comes to sexual matters we Americans are not only 
puritanical to the extreme, and compared to our European counterparts 
who don't bat an eye at nudity on the TV during primetime, we act like 
we're like 12 year old children, seems entirely related to the thread at 
hand, or am I missing something?

If so, then please fill me in.

Thanks!

That'd be great.

Do you really not see a difference between full frontal nudity and  
copulation?

The fucking kid sees himself in the mirror every day, can see the  
front of his own body, and can touch himself all he wants.
I agree that the US is too uptight about nudity on TV etc, but that's  
a very far cry from sex in public.

A 5yo will understand me if I teach him about violence.
A 5yo will understand me if I teach him about his own body.
A 5yo will FUCKING NOT UNDERSTAND ME AT ALL if I try to teach him  
about sex.

since "[you would] gladly ablidge..." i'm sure there are some SFRs out there 
who would help you with this :)

you could take a video of it, ensuring you get the act as well as the 
reactions of the small children passing by, then post it to Youtube so 
everyone on SFR can view and discuss !

I do see the difference between nudity and balls to the wall fucking.

I do too much of one, and not in a nice place like Esalen or Harbin, 
either, and much too little of the other.

As far as your other series of questions go, I dunno, kids ask the 
darnedest things.

Always have, always will.

How would you answer that last question?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Help SF Stay Kinky!

How about this...

Children should be the problem of the people who... you know...  
choose to have children.  And those people should keep them to  
themselves.  Or.... it doesn't take a village, it takes a fucking  
PARENT.

Likewise, those of us who choose NOT to have children (Which I  
personally believe is the more responsible choice; but that's another  
topic.) should not have to have other peoples' children imposed on  
us.  If I choose to watch porn... if I choose to watch kinky porn  
produced in an armory.... you can bet your damn ass there will be no  
children in the room.  And I see no reason whatsoever to, in any way,  
change my behavior, either by myself, with a partner, or a with group  
of consenting adults, on account of someone else's lifestyle choice.

Self-righteous, busybody, "think of the children" types can mind  
their own fucking business.

You seem to have been on a fairly hardcore libertarian-esque binge  
recently.  I'd have thought that you'd have had a similar sentiment.


cya,
john

just as we all have the right to watch porn (Weapons of Ass Destruction is 
one of my favorites !) we each also have the same right to not be inundated 
with it while walking down the street if we desire.  Self righteous, 
busybody, "forsake the children" types can mind their own "fucking" business 
and keep it out of my driveway.  while i have no problem with seeing such 
things and wouldn't think anything of it, if i were walking down the street 
with my 4 year old niece, you can bet your ass you're gonna get a fucking 
mouth full from me, and i don't mean dumping a load down your throat, 
regardless of how much you might enjoy it.

When I come home from work and you're getting a blowjob in my 
driveway, I'm calling the cops, and you're going to jail.  Don't 
change your behavior due to my lifestyle, if you choose, but you'll 
suffer the consequences.

Did you swim in a public pool?  No one was permitted in our pool =20

cabanas for us.

We were Catholic troop 296.  Camping trips were usually a week, =20
sometimes two.  Family values included keeping the BO down to a =20
reasonable level.

Guess my life was atypical.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Help SF Stay Kinky! - sex jokes !

I was thinking of the "Shortbus" movie that came out late last year, 
from the director of "Hedvig and the Angry Inch", which opens with a guy 
blowing himself in his apartment.

The DVD comes out in about a week, consider putting on the top of your 
queue.

I'm sure you'll have no problem with keeping the title in your head, 
since it's so simple and easy to remember, and I'm also sure you're 
already familiar with the word.

"Shortbus"

I heard a rumor when I worked at alt\aff that there was a guy who could 
fellate himself and that he made a vid of it that he put for sale 
online, and made a tidy sum in the process, but I've never been able to 
track it down, so I'm gonna have to go with urban legend on that one.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Help SF Stay Kinky!

I've noticed that starting somewhere in the mid-late 90s that the gen 
coming up behind me has a rising level of prudishness that seems to be 
in inverse proportion to all the "open-mindedness" "hip slick & 
cooleality" and "freedom" they purport to have. It's an odd phenomenon 
and I can't be the only one that's noticed this.

Not that I'm immune to societal indoctrination myself.

I learned at an early age just how quick and deep the indoctrination 
runs here in the good old US of A. When I was around nine years old I 
spent the summer visiting relatives that lived in a formerly communist 
country. Well, there, in the then glorious worker's paradise, all people 
were equal, which meant that their beaches were all clothing optional. 
One of the greatest freak-outs in my life came when we hit the sand one 
weekend and everyone, my aunt, uncle and cousins all went au natural on 
me, on the spot. I was so mortified that I spent the day, not only fully 
clothed but also wrapped in a towel, completely averting my eyes. This 
was at the age of nine.

Once I grew up I saw how brainwashed I had been at such an early age and 
have gone out of my way to break myself of it. Part of that means not 
paying attention to our arbiters of sexual morality, like the good folks 
over at the Catholic Church, they had 1,500 years to get it right, and 
at the end of it the best they could come up with was Paul Shanley and 
John Geoghan, so I don't listen to what they have to say about anything 
on this particular subject, and I wonder why anyone still takes them 
seriously about anything.

On the east coast we called it gym, and it was=20

I have swam in a public pool which required=20

I've seen it, and the legend part is him making any money from 
it.  It's not particularly pleasant to see unless you're into both 
male-on-male AND contortionists.  I'm usually good for one or the 
other, but BOTH? ick.

Dirty Sanchez - The Movie also starts in the same fashion.

For the record, my head is still intact; Mr Alberts, you have zero 
credibility.

---------------
Two nuns are walking through the Mission to the grocery store when they're 
raped by a very well-endowed man.
After, the nuns regain their composure and head on their way.

    What do you think Father Murphy is going to say when we tell him we were 
raped twice on the way to the store?

    But we were only raped once.

    [fanning her flushed face] Yeah, but we're going to have to go back the 
same way we came !

On that same note tonight at Bondage a Go Go it's Davina's going away 
party.  Don't know Davina?  Come out and meet her and you'll see what it's 
sad she's leaving.

Also, we have a bunch of NiN promo give aways for the upcoming DVD that's 
hitting shelves.  First come first serve for the swag.

I'm not trying to bite on Deepfog's style... nope, i admit i completely 
lifted it straight-away !   but i'd like to try something different... 
instead of one person sending the JOD, how about anybody can send a JOD but 
only one per day... kinda like the first person to call shotgun gets the 
window seat, everyone else has to wait until the next car ride.

And without further adieu

Subject: [sfraves] RR question...

I have seen the name of this old breaks track posted on here like six 
million times as peoples all time favorite breaks track, but I always forget 
the damn name...it's "Brass...." (something or other).

What uis the track title, and who be it by?

I know the track by sound, but not by name...

I know someone knows what I'm talkin' aboot. Anyone?


Marc(O)
