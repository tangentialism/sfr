It's so funny seeing people bug out about Patrick Turner...I know him 
personally, and it's cool to see people you know getting props for their 
work. Ol' Patty is a tool outside of his production skills, but hey...gotta 
give credit where credit is due, he's a great producer.

Subject: [sfraves] Track ID

Hey there, i was wondering if any of you could help me ID a certain
track.  I heard it at the Cloudfactory 10 yr.  Unfortunatly i was
sitting up on top of the big slope and i didnt want to walk down to
find out what track it was.

All i can remember from it, was the sample.

It would start saying a bunch of colors, like yellow, red, green, muave...etc.
Then it would say Color Spectrum, and then cycle through the colors
again.  Fucking awesome track.  if any of you out there know what the
name of that track is please help me out.

it was like that acid trip all over again, i had flashbacks and
everything, i'm so happy we finally found that record, thanks to your
help.

You know, you could just sign up for Lockline insurance for like 3
bucks a month and file a claim a few days after you sign up.  I think
they only charge for shipping, which I believe can be billed.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Nrr: anyone got an old verizon compat. cellphone for sale/give?

I don't think so, actually.  When I got my phone they told me that I had to 
sign up for it then or that I wouldn't be elligible for insurance because 
they wouldn't be able to tell if my phone was in working order.  It's worth 
looking into though.  Thanks for the idea.

They try and call your phone to verify it works. Tried that last year.

watch out for that shit man...

i used to work for verizon. whatever you do make sure
lockline gives you a NEW phone. their refurbished
pieces of shit always fail, especially if they give
you a motorola. ask for a new one. it would be too
late to add insurance if you already lost your phone
and reported it as lost. but if it's just damaged and
you have a phone on there where they can call and
verify that its a working phone then go for it.
otherwise i suggest craigslist or ebay.

Artists Break With Industry on File Sharing

Some Musicians Say Web Services Can Be Valuable Means
of Distribution

By Jonathan Krim
Washington Post Staff Writer
Tuesday, March 1, 2005; Page E05

A prominent group of musicians and artists, breaking
with colleagues and the major entertainment studios, is
urging the Supreme Court not to hold online file-
sharing services responsible for the acts of users who
illegally trade songs, movies and software.

The US is:  "...a nation of 200 million used-car salesmen with all the 
money we need to buy guns and no qualms about killing anybody else in the 
world who tries to make us uncomfortable."
-Hunter S. Thompson

"Sometime in your life, hope that you might see one starved man, the look 
on his face when the bread finally arrives.  Hope that you might have 
bought it or baked it or even kneaded it yourself.  For that look on his 
face, for your meeting his eyes across a piece of bread, you might be 
willing to lose a lot, or suffer a lot, or die a little, even."
-Daniel Berrigan

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Nrr: anyone got an old verizon compat. cellphone for sale/give?

It's a flip phone and the top half of the phone is unattached...  I realized 
yesterday that I can still use my phone with the handsfree kit (ear piece 
deally), I just can't see any of the stored information and it doesn't ring. 
  I can still call out though; so I guess it's not so bad.

A friend of a friend is hooking me up with a phone today; thanks for the 
help though.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Spirit of Raving Question: Your definition of PLUR

oh you're gonna just love me for this one ... but a lot of you will 
probably understand me a lot more after this ...

i haven't spent the last 12 years living in the values of peace, love, 
unity, respect.  i try a lot of the time, but i get easily frustrated 
because i don't think enough other people are living their lives 
anything close to peace, love, unity and respect.

i think PLUR to me is just a phrase, because i was around the scene 
before that saying became popular.  i tend to resist labels and tags on 
human behavior, so that's why i resisted this saying ... because i 
think true peace, love, unity and respect often has no words to 
describe it, just as i think true religion has no church to house it.  
it's all what we create in our minds.  but if it's a way of life for 
other people, i think that's fine.

hope that helps ...

I'd say that about hits it on the head for me too.

It's the same reason I don't buy into the whole organized religion thing. 
You shouldn't need a church, a priest, a guru or shaman, nor catch phrase 
(or whatever) to make you a peaceful person, a person who believes in unity, 
or being respectful, or loving your fellow human beings. You should just do 
it. Also (and maybe it's just the asshole in me), some people aren't worth 
being respectful to or giving love to. Some people are just plain shitty.

Of course it's all just a matter of opinion, and totally up to each 
individuals perogative to decide that sorta thing. I'm certainly not 
claiming to know what's good for anyone else....

Subject: [sfraves] 510 Junglists?

What ever happened to them? I remember some bomb parties -- one sticks out 
in my mind from the spot beneath Tenderloft. They had a tendency to fuck 
up and trainwreck now and then but the energy there was -slammin- and 
there was always an awesome mix of peeps in the crowd, young and old, 
ravers and bangers. Where are the 510 Junglists now?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Spirit of Raving Question: Your definition of PLUR

Ok, so detached from our collective dislike for labels, catch phrases,
spiritual doctrines, etc, let's look at PLUR for what it is, or what it
tries to be..

..which is, simply, a damn good idea- and one I see plenty of scene
folks ignoring.

Karina has quite a bit of balls to ask a question like this on a list
as jaded as this one- to me, in the areas of the scene that have
petrified, the state of things can be traced back to a distinct lack
of:

Peace: Drama abounds.  We aren't hurting eachother physically but we
certainly aren't always taking one another's happiness seriously.

Love: There is a lot of "hate" or just sort of regimented dislike in
some areas of the scene.  In some groups, it is de rigeur to hate
certain other groups or individuals.  Shit talking has been elevated to
an artform.  

Unity: See the above, and notice also how, even within your circle or
the 'heads that listen to your favorite music, how few people support
their scene or *gasp* anybody else's efforts.  See how many broken
friendships and strained relationships litter the roads of ravedom like
so much roadkill.

Respect:  See above.  

---

Now in the parts of the scene I see thriving, and in my own friends
circle (for the most part), I see a kind of realistic PLUR applied. 
You  might not Love, Respect, or desire Unity with *everyone* as it
stands, but you're working toward it, within yourself at the very
least.  ..and everybody wants Peace, in the end.

PLUR is what is right with every counterculture movement when it is
thriving, even ones you might think of as brash and violent (punks,
industro-goths, etc), and what is missing when they're at a low point.

Plur,
-gc

510 junglists.  man, i haven't heard that name is like...2 or 3 years?

who all was in that crew, anyhow?

i'm going to start a crew called 415 breakbeat.  who's with me?

and come to think of it....whatever happend to AM BREAKS???  yes,
that's right.  i'm pointing at all of you!  phillip, shelly, tom,
erik.  gba left for LA.  i know the rest of you are still playing
breaks.  tsk tsk.

i was really hoping AM Breaks was going to keep up their momentum.  i
was always sad that my china trip made it unfeasible to be a part of
that crew.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] HAS ANYONE HEARD ABOUT THE SQUAREONE-4 RAVE THIS WEEKEND???

from my understanding of what i've read on Bayraves (yes, i read
bayraves), B.A.M. productions is trying to secure a venue, kinda like
TELIC.  which would mean they'd need money to put down on a lease.

their last party, Cybertron, was completely packed at the Noodle. 
overpacked actually.  there was a line around the block at 11pm.

so these parties are "fundraisers" for this effort.

though i'm not going, i think the fact they are bringing Deepsky to do
a live PA at an all ages show is fucking awesome.

AFRIKA BAMBAATAA:  ALL MUSIC IS DANCE MUSIC


By Nathan Rabin

One of hip-hop's true pioneers, Afrika Bambaataa has made it his life's 
goal to break down barriers between genres and races alike. A onetime gang 
member, Bambaataa went on to form Zulu Nation, an idealistic, expansive 
organization that played a vital role in hip-hop's birth and development, 
putting on shows, helping define the culture, and generally helping expand 
the genre's music and ethos.

Bambaataa reigned as one of early hip-hop's most influential and 
sought-after DJ. He scored a seminal breakthrough hit with 1982's "Planet 
Rock," a perfect, oft-imitated single that helped define and perfect 
electrofunk by expertly blending old-school braggadocio with chilly Euro 
synthesizers straight out of Kraftwerk. The fusion of genres and 
sensibilities became an important theme in his music as he engaged in 
high-profile, genre-redefining collaborations with James Brown and Sex 
Pistols/PIL frontman John Lydon. Bambaataa's wildly eclectic tastes can be 
felt in his popular DJ sets, where he'll regularly throw AC/DC's "You Shook 
Me All Night Long" or the Andy Griffith Show theme song into sets otherwise 
dominated by more conventional dance fare.

Bambaataa continues to record and tour, serving as a respected elder 
statesman and goodwill ambassador for the genre he helped create and 
popularize. His latest album is 2004's Dark Matter Moving At The Speed of 
Light. The Onion A.V. Club recently spoke with the venerable icon about 
hip-hop, politics, and the secret messages behind movies.

The US is:  "...a nation of 200 million used-car salesmen with all the 
money we need to buy guns and no qualms about killing anybody else in the 
world who tries to make us uncomfortable."
-Hunter S. Thompson

"Sometime in your life, hope that you might see one starved man, the look 
on his face when the bread finally arrives.  Hope that you might have 
bought it or baked it or even kneaded it yourself.  For that look on his 
face, for your meeting his eyes across a piece of bread, you might be 
willing to lose a lot, or suffer a lot, or die a little, even."
-Daniel Berrigan

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

Coming from Toronto, E.N.D got his start MCing in the summer of 2001.
In 2002 he hooked up with the Goodfellaz Crew in Toronto to make a
permanent transition into hardcore MCing and DJing.E.N.D joined the
Pitched Up roster in the winter of 2003 and along with Hi-IQ, has
worked hard pumping up hardcore and non-hardcore crowds across North
America! HCFTP is proud to provide and represent TRUE Hardcore talent.

Pistachio vs. Anonymous (www.djpistachio.com)
Back in 1999 these two dj's tore up dance floors all over CA. After
the end of HomeBase and Second and Jackson these two dj's fell off the
radar. It's been almost 4 years since we have had the pleasure of
seeing these two artists perform. Welcome back two of the best dj's in
the bay area trance scene! The return of Pistachio & Anonymous!

Hi Friends, both present and future,
 
I'm sure many of you already know all about this little soiree, but we'd 
love to have as many of you as possible come meet the rest of the family!

<http://california.tribe.net/thread/09f192e3-5abd-41d7-8827-79adfb3a43d1?tribeid=8f684e70-8a70-4f4c-a476-e8130179ef52&threads=true&r=10513#bd4fedd2-ca63-4a18-8bc9-6a0261939c35>
We've about killed ourselves setting this thing up.  We actually have 
PERMITS !! It's shaping up to be epic, and it'd be lovely to see any
or all of your faces there.  It's a benefit, it's not cheap, and that 
kinda sux, but it's for one of our own, and that lessens the sting a 
little. 
 
The lineup is sick, the sound system is the full bore eight stack El 
Circo Bag End affair, and the throb should be massive. 
We are seriously going to shake the place.  And we want you with us!

Check it out and join us, won't you?

Burning Solstinox: Connections  March 5, 2005 8PM-4AM @ SOMArts, 934

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Spirit of Raving Question: Your definition of
  PLUR

--=====================_24143496==.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed



I've been avoiding discussions of "raving" on this and some other formerly 
"rave" lists lately.  So early nineties.  Now, after the bust, many with 
calloused fingers, asses and souls have moved beyond emo to cyno :-)  Hell, 
I clicked on my bookmark for bayraves the other day and found it is now 
BRProductions, the #1 Nitelife Network for California.  LOL.

PLUR.  Once something is defined perhaps it sheds significance and power 
much like genres and sub genres of "dance" music.  Everyone I knew in the 
early rave community exemplified these values but folks didn't sit around 
defining the transformative experiences we shared then.  Now it's 
"nightlife" people we are.  That covers lots of territory and I can't say I 
feel connection and brother/sisterhood everywhere in the night.  Lately the 
underground, political hip hop scene gives me spiritual boners and the 
punks, suicide boys and girls and some of the recycled stuff from the 
seventies and eighties may lead to another cultural revolution.  But now we 
have the new PLUR for nightlife peeps:

P =  PRODUCT.  Peace is so sixties eh?  Love same thing.  This is the 21st 
century.  War.  Terror.  The only way we Americans can deal with the dark 
is to consume.  The nitelife party is now a consumable -- ya know, it's IS 
just a party after all.  Many here now produce the product for 
consumption.  The rest of us buy.  Won't touch the stars, but you can have 
fun!!!  Whatever gets you through the night.  And "product" is just so very 
metro, eh?  And it's....yes... APOLITICAL!!!!

L = LUST.  Love is a very dangerous EMOtion.  Got to have 
commitment.  Sacrifice of self.  Empathy.  Guess it was easy to "feel" 
lovey on "E" for some,  but now 'tis alcohol and for many meth.  Guess the 
drug enforcement people are happy about the former and the latter, while so 
very destructive, is more American than a muscle car.
U = UPPITY.  Arrogance and snobbery often characterize the new nitelife 
community.  My genre is better than yours;  my product sells;  only I know 
what good dance music is.  Elitism.  Unity in the community is 
nineties.  We now have our little niches.  Must make direct marketers crazy.

R = RUDE.  All of us have experienced the decline of respect and civility 
in everyday life.  When one's focus is product, lust and snobbery one can 
expect a jab in the ribs on the Dancefloor every so often...at the 
minimum.  That's nitelife as opposed to raving.  Watch for the spiked 
drinks too...that could be an adventure.

Hey.  Nitelife.  It's all good.  All grate.  Lots of fun :-)  And if you 
want more than just a party, well that's up to you isn't it?  Consumer choice.

I'll close with an excerpt of some correspondence I'm having with a 
Croatian EDM lover.  I asked him what the scene was like in Croatia...that 
is nitelife.  I don't  think they have raving yet.  Forgive the English:

"EDM scene in Croatia is maybe at its golden age. Great parties, ( too ) many
DJ's... However, I often see something's missing.
It is probably the "lack of soul" problem that you mentioned in your mail.
Parties are very popular this days - EDM coming from all the possible
sources, kicks hard but vanishes really fast...
There is a huge amount of people coming to the parties not because of music
& dancing but some other, "higher" intereses...( it's very naughty from me
cuz' there was time when those "intereses" pushed me also, but I hope I
pushed them aside now :)
Yes, we had some really good DJ's ( I really enjoyed one night with Farley "
Jackmaster " and ATFC : ), but, I don't know how to express myself, music
gets colder...It starts to be really borring.
I rarely see men dancing ( most of them move their heads while the rest of
the body seems to be nailed to the dancefloor ) unlike women."

Perhaps, if he's lucky, some anarchists will throw a free party under the 
full moon some night soon.

PLUR,

Apollo

>From the front lines --

It's funny. You know, the kids don't even call it 'rolling' anymore. I 
went to a candy party last weekend, and they called it... 'thizzin'. You 
thizzin dog. You got thizz.

And let me tell you. Those kids were thizzzzzed. Spun out of their minds. 
One kid -- after pestering me and my chums for 'the afterparty' -- told me 
he had been up for two days on the thizz...

We're talking about methamphetamine.

The pills kids are doing now -- I got a couple meth bombs in my day, but 
these things are almost /exclusively/ speed, with a little MDMA or MDA 
thrown in for flavor, along with god knows what else. We're talking the 
shit that has people looking like an asian in the corner of 1015, eyes 
rolling back, twitching. /twitching/.

There's nothing else quite like a Urei 1620. The original rotary fader DJ 
mixer shaped the sounds of almost all the pioneering clubs of the 1970s and 
early '80s, influencing the style of every DJ that followed while helping 
to define dance music culture as we know it today.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] THE LEGEND IS REBORN

Someday, SOMEDAY, mark my words, I'm going to scrounge up an old Bozak
(the first, and some say best, rotary "dj" mixer) and have it modded to
include some modern features, and HOUSE IT ALL NIGHT LONG!!

hehe :)

There's also a guy in france who makes a shit-hot rotary mixer that is
small enough to fit in your record bag.. I really want one - DJR-400.

love,
GC

Subject: Re: [sfraves] THE LEGEND IS REBORN

The Beastie's immortalized it too:

"All you party people who are on my Bozak...."

I believe that line is from "Sure Shot", but I think they mentioned it in 
other tracks too.

Bozak was also slang for "booty", hehe.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] BSP: Folded @ Anu Tonight!

I have to credit our own beloved sninesix (ry.ry) for both the original
concept of "folded" (relating it to origami), and for our "F" logo,
which he drew on a piece of binder paper, scanned, and emailed to me. 
He recently gave me the original at his going-away party.  That was
awesome.

Ryan, we miss you!!

To all the househeads, come out tonight, even if it's wet out.  YOU
DON'T WANNA MISS THIS!

i think the phrase was based on Bozak mixers but the meaning was more like
"eat a dick" or something.

it's good to know that you've been down since day one.  go on player, play.

Subject: [sfraves] Cubik y Origami Airlines (EP review)

Artist:  Cubik & Origami 
EP:  [I won't know the title til I eject the disk]
Wide Hive Records, SF


     This is a confident, pretty, and ethereal (yet grounded) record that lifts off a few miles
north of the Bourbon Street jazz clubs. 

     Our unbearably cute pilots Origami and Cubik make a pit stop in Algeria [track 3] to score
some hash on the way to the next underground chill room [track 4].    Live drums carry a wicked
studio punch that had East Oakland boulevard thugs turning their heads to see whats that noise in
this reporters trunk.   

     Track 5 lands us back on the plains of North America, a plaintive song of some long-lost
warriors, encouraged by stirring battle drums.

   Can an epic run its course in only 5 tracks?  Cubik & Origami do a fine job.  

     Wide Hive Records is a fine label blasting out artists who mesh electronica with live
instruments (DJ Quest, DJ Zeph, Variable Unit and Dissent, for example).   Deserving more credit? 
Yes.  Tearing the roof off this motherfucker?  Yes again.

     Nice job, boys.

     Wide Hive tells me our hometown heroes Cubik & Orgami play every Wednesday in May & June at
Red Devil Lounge, 1695 Polk Street.

     For SFR News, Im Boomerang Fidget.  Peace.

Ummmm yeah, i just might have to ix-nay that order for a party
unfortunatly, Sorry folks but this den of debauchery has been retired.
 With the GF being prego, that wont fly over too well, she cant stay
up late (constantly tired and sometimes a lil bitchy), and she wont be
very happy trying to sleep with loud thumping music playing and drunk
people babbling all night.  Plus with the end of the lease being a
short 3 months away, and after all the time i've spent cleaning that
house after ryan left, i dont want to have to clean it anymore than i
have to from here on out.  I need to start patching up the lil staple
holes and reconditioning the hardwood floors in the hopes of getting
the maximum amount of my security deposit back.  Cause i'm gonna need
as much of that money as i can get in the preceeding months.

We'll have to figure something out for april though for marshal's
bday.  maybe try to put together a bit of a renegade or something,
unfortunatly we wont be having it at my house again this year (see
above).  i think it's April 4th, so i think that weekend before the
4th is when he wants to do it.

Ummmm yeah, i just might have to ix-nay that order for a party
unfortunatly, Sorry folks but this den of debauchery has been retired.
 With the GF being prego, that wont fly over too well, she cant stay
up late (constantly tired and sometimes a lil bitchy), and she wont be
very happy trying to sleep with loud thumping music playing and drunk
people babbling all night.  Plus with the end of the lease being a
short 3 months away, and after all the time i've spent cleaning that
house after ryan left, i dont want to have to clean it anymore than i
have to from here on out.  I need to start patching up the lil staple
holes and reconditioning the hardwood floors in the hopes of getting
the maximum amount of my security deposit back.  Cause i'm gonna need
as much of that money as i can get in the preceeding months.

We'll have to figure something out for april though for marshal's
bday.  maybe try to put together a bit of a renegade or something,
unfortunatly we wont be having it at my house again this year (see
above).  i think it's April 4th, so i think that weekend before the
4th is when he wants to do it.

Theres two events going on this weekend... One at BLUE CUBE, where BAM 
is going to break some new asses 
(http://www.bluecubesf.com/consolidated). I'm gonna go -- gotta 
represent 5th St. and theres a more risque event happening at SOMARTS, 
more burning man related, a Friends of Curtis event.

Undergrounds?? Dunno whats up, but with a 5 dollar event at Blue Cube, 
this is one hell of an excuse to check the place out if you havent already.

--0-1367936543-1109972737=:23467
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

maybe it's just me, but i remember when i considered the sunday t-dance at the endup the best weekly party in san francisco. super thick vibe, ass-shaking tunes, and at least one of everything you could possibly think of. ravers, professors, trannies, hotties, travellers, whatever... everyone was there and everyone got down. i used to drive out from sacramento on the weekends just to hit up that party, and it was always worth it.
 
now it looks like the EndUp has put something together that can rival those days of community, diversity, and straight-up mayhem on the dance floor. can you tell that i'm excited about it? details are as follows:
 
"A Story About Us"
Sundays in March from 11am - 4pm
Premiers THIS SUNDAY 3/6
<send me an email for guest list!>
 
featuring:
Chris Lum
Naz
Leonard 
Loren
 
The End Up
6th @ Harrison
San Francisco, CA
21+ w/ID
 
~brought to you by abitare music group and in house records~
 
so are you in or what? send me an email for guest list privileges and i'll see you on the dance floor!
 
love,
mo

I haven't been to the endup in over a year, but last time I was there, there 
were too many people thizzin' for me to be comfortable.  Maybe it's 
different this year.

you can find beans at your local farmers market. they typically have
all kinds. as for party favors go, you might want to try the Party
Warehouse.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Re: Where can I get some beans in this city?

also, the Ecology Center in Berkeley ( http://www.ecologycenter.org/ ) 
has a seed swap tonight (friday) at 7 pm.

i'm sure they'll have lots of beans tonight - fava, green, pinto, 
anasazi, and probably some heirloom varieties.  just bring a bag, and 
come get some beans (and other seeds)!  everything is free.

i'll definitely be there!

Subject: [sfraves] I'm leaving.. on a jet plane.

I'll be back, for the first time in over 2 years, next friday.

I picked up a job for a company in walnut creek, and they're allowing
me to telecommute. I'll be coming out every 2-3 weeks.

Anyhow, I'm looking forward to seeing all your old faces again, and
hopefully meeting some new ones too.

Oh, and I have hair now, too.

90-hour workweeks do that too.

Not so much, but okay. I don't like going out all the time.

Yup.

This one's my favorite, and probably my favorite past-time as of late:

Cool, I'm a goth kid. Cept, I'm not.
But if you think about it, those above describe basically every child on earth.

The Divine Mirror is us. When we really see things as they are,
we see the Divinity reflected within us. The infinite space of
emptiness and form co-existing simultaneously. This party will
spread that message, through music, dance, visuals, ceremony,
art, and YOU, the friendly subtle and obvious freaks who
collectively make it happen.

We hope you arrive in time to participate in a special midnight
ceremony with Julia Butterfly Hill. Julia is an activist in
spiritually based social change projects. She got her start
doing a now famous and unprecedented 2 year tree sit atop Luna,
an ancient redwood marked for cutting. Her efforts brought world
wide attention to the unheeded environmental devastation
happening at the time, and helped spark movements to stop it. We
are honored to once again have her as a guest. To maintain a
sacred space, there will be no entry to the party during the
ceremony from 12M-12:15

The Divine Mirror is us. When we really see things as they are,
we see the Divinity reflected within us. The infinite space of
emptiness and form co-existing simultaneously. This party will
spread that message, through music, dance, visuals, ceremony,
art, and YOU, the friendly subtle and obvious freaks who
collectively make it happen.

We hope you arrive in time to participate in a special midnight
ceremony with Julia Butterfly Hill. Julia is an activist in
spiritually based social change projects. She got her start
doing a now famous and unprecedented 2 year tree sit atop Luna,
an ancient redwood marked for cutting. Her efforts brought world
wide attention to the unheeded environmental devastation
happening at the time, and helped spark movements to stop it. We
are honored to once again have her as a guest. To maintain a
sacred space, there will be no entry to the party during the
ceremony from 12M-12:15

Not quite a headliner, but somewhat an infamous rockstar, perhaps?

The US is:  "...a nation of 200 million used-car salesmen with all the 
money we need to buy guns and no qualms about killing anybody else in the 
world who tries to make us uncomfortable."
-Hunter S. Thompson

"Sometime in your life, hope that you might see one starved man, the look 
on his face when the bread finally arrives.  Hope that you might have 
bought it or baked it or even kneaded it yourself.  For that look on his 
face, for your meeting his eyes across a piece of bread, you might be 
willing to lose a lot, or suffer a lot, or die a little, even."
-Daniel Berrigan

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."

An honest look in the mirror reveals that we have the capacity for great=20

This MONTH - March 2005 SFRaves turns 13 YEARS OLD :) (March 1992 -> March=

Bash to celebrate the 13th year of SFRaves

blessing this universe. The SFRaves Calendar is also turning 10 this year!=
=20
In effect, we have double the reason to

celebrate :)

In order to kick off the event planning SFRaves is hosting a dinner=20
(location TBD) to celebrate our presence on this

planet as a Free Resource to the community, as well to appreciate the=20
SFRaves community presence in our lives. This

dinner is to be a catalyst in planning the SFRaves 13 Year Annniversary=20
Party! Please join us and realize our

dreams, an event to celebrate our history and contribution to the local=20
scene.

The SFRaves-planners / SFRaves 13 Year Anniversary Dinner is tentatively=20
set for Sunday, March 20, 2005 at 8pm. The

Location is to be determined per the feedback of the list.

The SFRaves-Planners list has risen like a phoenix from the fire, born=20
again from its own ashes :)

Please send an email to sfraves-planners-subscribe@hyperreal.org from the=

BIO: PETE AVILA Pete Avila is one of San Francisco~Rs most legendary DJ~Rs=
=20
and producers, instrumental in the creation of the current dance scene in=
=20
San Francisco.  Starting out DJing for money to help with college in 1984,=
=20
Pete soon found himself taking it all a bit more seriously and started=20
playing other gigs in and around the city, finally settling down for a=20
Friday night residency at Townsend.  Pete would do mutil-houred sets as=20
the sole Dj on Friday nights while Doc Martin would command the club in=20
the same fashion for Saturday nights.  It was at Townsend that Pete began=
=20
learning how to truly forge soundscapes out of the myriad of styles at the=
=20
time, modern rock, early house, latin hip hop.  But the early 90~Rs=20
brought an entirely new phase of excitement to San Francisco~Rs party=20
scene and to Pete Avila in particular.  It was a special, hedonistic time,=
=20
fueled by the use of certain designer drugs, smart drinks, VR, dark=20
dancefloors and even darker chill rooms.  From this spring of creativity=20
was brought forth OSMOSIS, Pete~Rs amazing party at the top floor of the=20
now defunct DV8 club.  For it was at Osmosis that everyone and anyone came=
=20
to party, to dance, to do and be whatever the felt they wanted to.  Since=
=20
Osmosis, Pete has continued to be a mainstay in the Bay Area clubscene,=20
lending his excellent mixing abilities to parties in San Francisco and=20
beyond.  Pete is also a talented producer and remixer, having worked on=20
major projects for Todd Terry, Naked Music, and M-People to name a few.

BIO: JORGE TEREZ Jorge Gutierrez aka DJ Jorge Terez grew up in San=20
Francisco listening to classic disco & funk records played by his older=20
siblings. At the young age of 8, he began collecting vinyl inspired by the=
=20
hip-hop/ break dancing scene. From then on, Jorge's niche was found.=20
Thanks to his older brother, who gave him a gift of 2 Sony turntables,=20
Jorge basically taught himself to mix and scratch." I already had a pretty=
=20
large record collection ranging from disco funk records to new wave/punk=20
records at the time." Throughout high school, he built his DJ reputation=20
by spinning at house parties and also with other local DJs.  In 1987 he=20
began to listen to house records by Todd Terry. By that time, Jorge had=20
been influenced by the Chicago House Scene and decided what he wanted to=20
do for the rest of his life. In 1991 Jorge landed a gig at The Palladium=20
in SF as the opening DJ. Through his Palladium connections, he landed a=20
job at one of San Francisco's biggest radio stations Live 105. He worked=20
various positions eventually working up to production assistant & Mix Show=
=20
producer. In 1997 he defected to San Francisco's urban radio station Wild=
=20
94.9 where he assisted over a year for the Saturday night mix show.=20
Throughout this time, he held down various DJ residencies spinning up to 5=
=20
nights a week at The Sound Factory, Club X, The Box, The Caf=E9, Townsend=
=20
and the infamous PleasureZone parties. Leaving commercial radio in 1999,=20
he was able to focus on the bay area club scene spinning at various clubs=
=20
for various promoters. Wanting to further his career in 2000, Jorge=20
decided to get back behind the scenes and focus on being primarily a dance=
=20
music producer. Currently, he has collaborated with musician Belinda=20
Robles Montoya to produce original soulful house tracks for Bluevelvetcat=
=20
and Deep Vision Records.

DJ influences: all the usual suspects...Frankie Knuckles, Louie Vega,=20
David Harness, Francois K, etc. Bay area dj influences: Miguel Migs, Jay=20
J, Ruben Mancias, and Mind Motion Dj style....."I like to cover the full=20
range of dance music. Ranging From downtempo beat stuff to the soulful=20
house sound even playing the Progressive and break beat stuff. I like it=20
all. As long as it's funky and well produced, I can appreciate it."

Loveworks Resident DJ Bio: MATT VALENZ In a world overtaken by automation=
=20
and technology, soul can be a hard thing to come by.  For someone lucky=20
enough to be raised on the sounds of Earth Wind & Fire, Kool and the Gang,=
=20
Diana Ross, and Tower of Power, being soulful comes as second nature. At=20
17 he was turned onto vinyl and was soon playing Miami bass, freestyle,=20
and primitive house at small underground parties in the central California=
=20
area, then moved on to start a career in the music business when he=20
relocated to San Francisco at age 21.  He continued his drive to learn=20
every aspect of the industry, and returned a few years ago from a two year=
=20
stay in England where he was the booking manager for dy-na-mix agency, the=
=20
best agency for underground music in Europe. Now, back in that city, he is=
=20
resident at ~Q Loveworks Dancing ~Q, a mobile house music phenomenon=20
focusing on vibe, music, and art.  past guests such as Doc Martin, Joi=20
Cardwell, J. Sinister, DJ Diz, and international guests like the UK's=20
Eddie Richards, A Man Called Adam, and Terry Francis have also helped to=20
establish the party as a premier place for true house music, funk, soul,=20
and classics in the bay area.  He continues to play at the some of San=20
Francisco's best parties and is currently assembling a personal studio.

Bio: LOVEWORKS Add a large helping of deep underground house music with a=
=20
side of funk, a heap of disco, and a hint of techno, and you have the most=
=20
nutritious dancefloor experience available in San Francisco. Initially=20
conceived by Dianna Jacobs and Nori Castillo of Toontown / Carefree fame=20
in the summer of '96, Loveworks was envisioned as a refuge from the=20
monotony of local clubs and superficial music, and has become one of the=20
bay area's most well known nights out, while somehow remaining one it's=20
best kept secrets.  It exists to unite people of any race, social status=20
or sexuality together in a comfortable and friendly club environment with=
=20
music as the focal point, and in addition to it's monthly parties at the=20
Minna Gallery, Loveworks also teams up with other like minded parties=20
around the city and has been featured at clubs and parties such as Liquid,=
=20
the Top, Electric, and the Endup.  Besides late night dancing, Loveworks=20
has also been involved in events for Wired Magazine, Apple Computer, Sony=
=20
Digital, Construct Internet Design, and a host of others. Loveworks also=20
had the honor of winning the SF Bay Guardian~Rs ~Q BEST HOUSE CLUB ~Q in=20
1999.


Bio: 111 MINNA GALLERY 111 Minna Gallery is a dynamic ~Qcontemporary art=20
salon~R that provides an arena for multi-dimensional artistic expression=20
in a community atmosphere. The goal of the ~Qgallery-as salon~R concept is=
=20
to nurture and support a communal gathering of artists and a collaboration=
=20
between diverse art forms. This goal is achieved through six-week=20
rotations of visual art exhibitions curated by the staff combined with a=20
variety of music and film events. ~QMinna~R is not only the name of the=20
street on which the gallery is found but also translates from Japanese as=
=20
"everybody," an all-inclusive term that symbolizes the embracing=20
environment of the space. The gallery, which also offers two bars, is=20
crafted in an eclectic, contemporary design with ample furniture inviting=
=20
guests to leisurely relax and enjoy conversation among friends. The=20
combination of art, music, film, dance and conversation found at 111 Minna=
=20
Gallery creates a unique gathering place for a multi-sensory experience.

The US is:  "...a nation of 200 million used-car salesmen with all the 
money we need to buy guns and no qualms about killing anybody else in the 
world who tries to make us uncomfortable."
-Hunter S. Thompson

"Death is our eternal companion.  It is always to our left, at an arm's 
length.  It has always been watching you.  It always will until the day it 
taps you.  The thing to do when you're impatient is...to turn to your left 
and ask advice from death.  An immense amount of pettiness is dropped if 
your death makes a gesture to you, or if you catch a glimpse of it, or if 
you just catch the feeling that your companion is there watching you."
-Carlos Castaneda

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

But above said names are not on the bill...

I personally like a few names on this list very much, not so much for "What" 
they play but the style of how they play.

The US is:  "...a nation of 200 million used-car salesmen with all the 
money we need to buy guns and no qualms about killing anybody else in the 
world who tries to make us uncomfortable."
-Hunter S. Thompson

"Death is our eternal companion.  It is always to our left, at an arm's 
length.  It has always been watching you.  It always will until the day it 
taps you.  The thing to do when you're impatient is...to turn to your left 
and ask advice from death.  An immense amount of pettiness is dropped if 
your death makes a gesture to you, or if you catch a glimpse of it, or if 
you just catch the feeling that your companion is there watching you."
-Carlos Castaneda

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

Subject: [sfraves] Notice: List Subscriptions/Posting now wide open

Hi All-

Fyi, I just removed the delay on new subscriber's posts (an anti-spam 
measure put in when we were being harrased a while back, remember that 
dude?)

So the list is back to its normal state, anyone can subscribe and post as 
they please. Although currently, there is a 25 per post day limit, and 
maximum 7 recipient cross-post limit.

Apologies to anyone who's posts took forever to get through or otherwise 
didn't get through. We should be all good now =)

take care,
-terry

The US is:  "...a nation of 200 million used-car salesmen with all the 
money we need to buy guns and no qualms about killing anybody else in the 
world who tries to make us uncomfortable."
-Hunter S. Thompson

"Death is our eternal companion.  It is always to our left, at an arm's 
length.  It has always been watching you.  It always will until the day it 
taps you.  The thing to do when you're impatient is...to turn to your left 
and ask advice from death.  An immense amount of pettiness is dropped if 
your death makes a gesture to you, or if you catch a glimpse of it, or if 
you just catch the feeling that your companion is there watching you."
-Carlos Castaneda

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."

Yeah, 25 is a little high, isn't it? Perhaps I slipped a keystroke. Oh 
well, nobody has been posting to the level of complaints in recent months. 
It'll change when it needs to change.

In conjunction with DJ Spooky's live performance Rebirth of a Nation,
we present a screening of the landmark film on which the performance
is based. D.W. Griffith's epic saga of the Civil War expanded the
boundaries of storytelling on the screen, conveying a richer, more
complex tale than any movie before it. What continues to be
problematic about The Birth of a Nation is its still-shocking racism.
Griffith, whose political ideas were naive at best, seemed genuinely
surprised by the criticism of his masterwork, and for his next project
turned to the humanist preaching of the massive Intolerance. Boycotted
and protested from the start, Birth sold more tickets than any other
movie (a record that stood for decades), and President Woodrow Wilson
famously compared it to "history written in lightning."

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: Evil Breaks One Year Anniversary w/ General Midi and Roxiller - Live

two things:

one, the $10 online presales for the party will only be available
until this Friday, March 11th.  after that, online presales will be
$15.  i hate to see my friends pay full price, and even though $10 is
actually way below our break-even price, i want you all to get in for
cheap!

two, in the past year, Evil Breaks has grown very close to my heart. 
it started very casually about a year and a half ago when i randomly
bumped into Aaron Jae at a club and he handed me a cd.  we started
talking online about how we loved breaks and that we wanted to see
more breaks shows.  se we somewhat prematurely decided to start
throwing parties and to start pushing breaks at underground and above
ground shows.  our first show was Furious at the dungeon in March of
2004.  since then it's been a wild ride of joy and excitement and
heartache and stress.  it's been a privelage to have seen many of you
out at our events.  and with that, i'd like to invite all of you to
our birthday bash!  it'd mean a lot to us to have you celebrate with
us.

Evil Breaks One Year Anniversary
Saturday, March 19th
9pm-4am

Subject: [sfraves] one.week.to.go...

And I'll be in London for a day and then flying out to Berlin the
next. Decided to not bother with London until later. Just not OK with
a 2 to 1 ratio on my money so they get the finger for now. I've got a
German girl living at my friend's house who's a total house head and
parties a lot back home. She's got me all setup with people in Cologne
so that's where I'll be playing a bit more. All I know is I can't wait
to on foreign soil finally...

http://www.sninesix.com/archive/nyc20005 (pictures from new.york.city)

On that nyc note. I love SF, but I think I'll be living in NYC next if
I move back to the US. SF is just too fucking slow for me these days
now that I've had a taste of NYC. I got there and it felt like home.
Big, eh, yeah sorta, but still felt small to me. SF has charm and good
people (good house scene too), but it's far too complacent and chill.

Feels kinda weird. I'm almost packed and ready to go. Just a few more
things, such as my toiletries, headphones, and laptop to pack.

Gotta get my shoes and smokes from out in the car.

No worries, mate.

I'll be getting in at about 2:15 tomorrow in oakland. I'll probably
try to find something to do tomorrow night.

Ah, the nomad's life for me.

Don't worry, about a thing, cause everything little thing is gonna be all 
right.. Woke up this morning, smiled at the rising sun, three little 
birds, sat upon my doorstep, singing sweet songs, of melodies 
pure and true, .... oh

If you want to live life at 140BPM move to NYC. SF operates somewhere
around 122 - 128. But it is a house head town after all... =)

It's too bad you're not out next Sunday for the first Sunset party of
the year!! (or are you?)

hi all.  just rescribed after five+ years of disappearance from sfraves.

thanks for sharing this link.  surprised that the guy didn't check
himself into the hospital right away; or someone should have advised
him to do so.  i didn't see him pointing the gun at anybody and that
was a good thing.  shouldn't have fired empty shot into the air but i
suppose it was for demonstration.  i believe the rule to carry gun is
pointing nozzle to ground.

no, i'm no gun expert.  just a couple of trips to the shooting range. 
learned a lot and brought my friends along the next.  after
instructing friends on gun handling and safety and ready to relax.. 
guy friend almost blew up his finger because one hand was holding too
near nozzle of gun.  then lady friend stepped up and consistently hit
target that i had failed to hit.  either she was pulling my leg or
watching too many "Kill Bill" reruns :)  i definitely pay utmost
appreciation for my lady friend thereafter, for not only did i receive
hugs and pecks from her at parties, she was also my bodyguard even
though she didn't know it :)

have a great day folks.

l&hugs.

HAHA, ahh comon man, NYC is a house-head town too, only they like it at
130bpm with really awful divas over it ;)

Here we've got techno, ghetto-tek, d&b and breaks, all hovering in the
130-190bpm range.  What's NYC got?  Played-out disco punk and garage
rock?

Just kidding, haahahahahahaahhaa ;) ;) ;)

Would love to (and plan to) make an NYC pilgrimage soon, I need to see
what all the hubbub is about.  I just don't like to see my tizzown
gittin' dizzogged. ;)

love ya man, have fun out there,

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Almost packed...

I lived 4 hours south of NYC for a collective 20 years, and have been there 
many times. I think the party scene in NYC, by and large, sucks asscookies 
through a liposuction straw. People who think they're way more beautiful and 
glamorous than they are, overpriced everything and if you go down from the 
club level to the "rave" level, it's 15 year old dust-heads as far as the 
eye can see. 140bpm pace? YES. But you have to suffer through the dregs of 
society to live it.

Ugh.

I can only guess that for those who didn't grow up on the other coast that 
it holds some sort of odd charm, but I am well over it...

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Almost packed...

I'm talking pace of life. The electronic dance music scene there isn't
much and to them it's rather passe. It's really a big bar life town
full of people that love to drink, but don't like to dance so much. My
take on NYC and it's EDM scene is that it's pretty dead compared to
SF. However the pace of life there is shit fuck ton faster than SF
which thinks it's big and fast, but really it's a sleepy city by the
bay in comparison to NYC. That's why I say SF is a 122 - 128bpm city.
Oh yeah and go figure that most of the house music in SF is right in
that range too. Hahahaha.

All I know is that SF feels too slow to me. I think after living there
for a year in 1999 the allure of the city wore off and I learned just
how small it was and how it wasn't really that fast paced at all.
Maybe it was back when the party scene was blowing up and I had my
head wrapped around trance and nrg, but that was then and now that's
not the case. SF is seriously a huge a house capital for the nation
and for that it rocks. Anyone that I meet that loves house I tell to
go to SF. Finding a club with house in SF is like shooting fish in a
barrel.

buongiorno
 
Want It Radio continues to embitter the inhabitants of surrounding apartments by pumping out fresh house, breaks, and techno all week long! or maybe they're tuned into the loop and dancing around, and that's what all that banging is.
 
check it out for yourself:
 
http://radio.wantit.org
 
our guest this past week was DJ Trixxx, a breakbeat freak from Santa Cruz. he threw down some of the new hotness and some of the classic bangers... dope! it was a rockin' set, and lovely music to get steaming drunk to, which i did.
 
as always, appearances by the Want It residents DJ Chai, DJ Malloc, and Mo Corleone are also packaged neatly into this week's loop. 
 
have a listen, and if you're interested in stopping by as a guest DJ some week then send me an email. if you have tentative plans to attend and/or play records at burning man this year, we'd be particularly happy to hear from you.
 
grazie!
 
love,
mo

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Almost packed...

Just wait till you start hitting up some of those third world countries 
and then we'll see whats up..

My take on NYC --- I went there for a while and can't see myself moving 
there. Overpriced snobbish people that are afraid to make eye contact 
with one another. Go to a club and good luck there. The people spend a 
lot on the glitz and glamour, and indeed there are some intelligent 
people there, but the front they put up is outlanding. Only in New York 
is the gentrification as bad. You can be one block in a place 
reminiscent of Italy and the following block stolling through the slums. 
Like here, right? But the difference is that there is no cross 
pollination of people and ideas across the city.  I saw a woman pay 
$5000 on a pair of socks -- she flew in to shop. You're right, the hole 
in the wall bar scene totally rocks -- but most of the reason there 
isn't dancing is because it's illegal -- theres a law against it without 
a cabaret license. The architecture is awesome. I loved the brick and 
underground.. So is the area around NYU, the only place I would even 
consider moving to.

You'll have a renewed appreciation for SF when you see more. Perhaps you 
won't move back here, but I think you'll remember it teary eyed; I don't 
doubt the words "I miss SF" will also be uttered.

last time i heard Onionz he ripped it.  i'm hoping to make it out to this.

just think, if this nice weather holds up until sunday....sunny skies,
house beats, cold beer, light breeze.

feels like summer is on it's way and i'm loving it.

Summer in the bay area..

Can't fucking beat it.

Today I wore a t-shirt with nothing over it for the first time (I get
cold easily).

Nice one!

Subject: [sfraves] Come-Unity and Slot Machine (was Re: [sfraves] Almost packed...)

Oh yeah, one other really cool thing about this event is SLOT MACHINE
The next generation of musicians will be also playing LIVE at Come-Unity:

Jeno and Jonah Sharp's kin formed a punk band called SLOT MACHINE. I'm 
excited to hear what the next generation of punk sound feels like. :)

KIDS ROCK

Slot Machine - bass player Yan Ingram, drummer Jasper Sharp, lead singer 
Viv Sharp and guitarist Liam Brown) is a true San Francisco  sensation 
whose youngest member is 7 and whose oldest, at 12, is still 
eligible to order a Happy Meal.

KIDS ROCK
Slot Machine (from left, bass player Yan Ingram, drummer Jasper Sharp, 
lead singer Viv Sharp and guitarist Liam Brown) is a true San Francisco 
sensation whose youngest member is 7 and whose oldest, at 12, is still 
eligible to order a Happy Meal. Chronicle photo by Liz Mangelsdorf

Like every rock star, Viv Sharp knows how to avoid questions he doesn't 
feel like answering.

With his hipsterized hair mostly hidden beneath a ear-flapped wool cap, 
the lead singer of Slot Machine slouches, pouts, swings his arms from side 
to side and pretends to be more interested in testing out the swivel on 
his chair than explaining the lyrics to one of his band's new tunes, 
"Mexican Song."

"What's it about? I don't know. Tacos. Burritos," Viv says as his three 
bandmates nod in agreement, adjusting their trucker hats, beanies and 
innocently ill-fitting clothes.

Well, what else do you guys write about?

Suddenly, every eyebrow in the band has turned into a maxed-out stupid- 
question sensor.

"Uhhh ... Pizza?!?," they say, clowning another question in unison with an 
undetectable ratio of sarcasm to seriousness.

Genius.

Meet Slot Machine -- a true San Francisco sensation whose youngest punk 
rock member is 7 and whose oldest -- at 12 -- is still eligible to order a 
Happy Meal.

But don't kid yourself about the boys in this band -- Slot Machine wasn't 
born yesterday.

Formed more than a year ago at the Creative Arts Charter School in San 
Francisco (kind of like an elementary school version of "Fame"), Slot 
Machine has been perfecting its songwriting skills with steady rehearsals, 
gigs and time in the recording studio to achieve a sound its young members 
credit to such influences as the Clash, the Sex Pistols and the Ramones.

They've already got an attitude that the Tommy Lees of the world spend 
decades trying to earn. Even their names are rock star-ready.

Seven-year-old lead singer Viv is lucky the mike stand adjusts as low as 
it does.

Yan Ingram, at 10, is about as tall as his bass is long.

Lead guitarist Liam Brown, 12, digs his new VOX amplifier.

And the drummer, Jasper Sharp, 11, insists that it's totally cool playing 
in a band with his kid brother, Viv.

"Well, he doesn't get stage fright like our last lead singer," says 
Jasper, the deepest and most down-to-business voice of the band. Getting 
past pre-gig butterflies has so far been the biggest obstacle for Slot 
Machine.

"It's one thing when we play in front of people our own age," explains 
Liam, the humble one. "But we get a little more nervous in front of 
grown-ups. We worry a little about messing up in front of them. But we get 
over it once we're onstage."

The stage keeps getting bigger for Slot Machine, which nicked its name 
from a trading card game called Yu-Gi-Oh! It just sounded cooler than 
their second choice, "Wired 9."

"Yeah, Wired 9 was kind of corny," Liam says.

The venues on Slot Machine's resume include the Great American Music Hall, 
Bottom of the Hill, Rickshaw Stop and Slim's. (At 
www.reflectiverecords.com/slotmachine/slot.html you'll find performance 
dates.)

Playing nightclubs in San Francisco must come in handy for impressing 
girls at school, right?

Suddenly everyone has to adjust his instrument. Yan hides his face in his 
conveniently long black hair.

"We're not into the whole rock-star thing," Jasper says. "Music is just 
what we do."

Their goal is to play at the Fuji Rock Festival in Japan. Jasper and Viv 
have been to Japan before, but that was when they were "a lot younger."

"Yeah. I was only like 3," says Viv, admitting to an understandably 
limited rock-star recollection of his last tour of the Far East.

After Japan, the group wants to take on Spain, or maybe Thailand.

But in the meantime, the musicians will be starting off the new year by 
cutting their first record -- a 7-inch single coming out on Reflective 
Records, a predominantly electronica-oriented label owned by local DJ 
Jonah Sharp. Sharp, who records under the name Spacetime Continuum, is 
also Viv and Jasper's manager. And their father. Liam's dad is 
internationally known DJ Jeno.

"It's amazing. They've never been interested in turntables, and they hate 
the electronic music that we're into," says papa Sharp, a native of 
Scotland. "Whenever I put any electronic music on in the car, they're 
always like, 'Ahh, get that stuff off and put on some real music like the 
Ramones or something.' "

"Yeah, Liam was about 6 years old when he started singing along to a Sex 
Pistols song," says DJ Jeno, a former Londoner. "That's when I knew 
something was going on."

Long, long ago, rock 'n' roll used to be viewed as a corrupting influence 
on American youth. But Jeno, Jonah and the other Slot Machine parents see 
the band as a healthy way to keep their kids busy and creative.

"They get their homework done, rehearse once a week and play a few gigs," 
Sharp says. "They get to play music, and we get to relive our youths 
through our kids. It's fun for all of us."

Yes indeed. The kids are all right.

All's Fair in Love and Negativland
   By Dimitri Nasrallah
   February 25, 2005

   Bay Area media-artists Negativland are considered one of the most
subversive, curious bands to emerge from the last 20 years of the 20th
century. A collective of staunchly independent and fiercely intelligent
media pranksters, their records bridge the gap between Faust and Kid606,
between the Residents and 2 Many DJ's. Since their inception in 1980,
they've thrown an entire history of counterculture, from literary satire to
folk to punk to musique concrete, into a creative blender and come up with
a mishmash of ego-debunking tape loops and bristling social attacks. As
culture-jammers, they pulled off some of the most audacious media hoaxes in
music history. As advocates for Fair Use and amendments in copyright law,
they've been embroiled in some of the nastiest legal battles. Now
celebrating their 25th anniversary, after an extended absence from the
public spotlight, they return this year with a fistful of CDs, DVDs, and
books. If any one group has deserved the notoriety of being considered
"dangerous" by the mainstream, Negativland is it. We dust off the hoaxes,
the infamous lawsuits, and the label wrangling that made Negativland the
cult legends they are today.

House Music 101:  http://livingart.com/raving/articles/housemusic101.htm


The US is:  "...a nation of 200 million used-car salesmen with all the 
money we need to buy guns and no qualms about killing anybody else in the 
world who tries to make us uncomfortable."
-Hunter S. Thompson

"Death is our eternal companion.  It is always to our left, at an arm's 
length.  It has always been watching you.  It always will until the day it 
taps you.  The thing to do when you're impatient is...to turn to your left 
and ask advice from death.  An immense amount of pettiness is dropped if 
your death makes a gesture to you, or if you catch a glimpse of it, or if 
you just catch the feeling that your companion is there watching you."
-Carlos Castaneda

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

Subject: [sfraves] BLUETECH at 1015 folsom

Hey music heads--
       I know mine isn't the first post about what could be a downright spiritual Moontribe event
at 1015 Folsom this Friday night. But if there are any fellow Bluetech fans out there, I wanted to
alert you that he'll be playing NEW stuff off his upcoming third album in his live set. If you're
interested, below I've pasted an article I wrote on him this month for the San Francisco Observer,
a small city paper often labeled with neighborhood names: the Castro Star, Western Edition (cute)
and the Haight Beat. Below that, there's a link to the full story on the Observer website if you'd
like to read the interview Q&A. Bluetech has a refreshing take on the world--check out what he has
to say. 
       If you're a Bluetech fan, feel free to hit me up--i'm relatively new out here and it would
be nice to get a sense of who's into psydub and whatnot...
       See you there!
                   jB

March SAN FRANCISCO OBSERVER
Bluetech Brings Soothing Psy Sounds to 1015 Folsom
By Jeremy Bates, Mar 08, 2005 

Like a giant oak with silicon leaves, Evan Bartholomews music grows from deep within the earth
and blossoms into our brilliant modern world. Its organic roots sip silver rainwater and sprout
bionic branches, which you can hear tapping the tangy synths and tweaking the knobs that sculpt
the psychedelic soundscapes Bartholomew inhabits under his preferred moniker: Bluetech.

Psy/chill, ambient dub, downtempo: However a shopkeeper might categorize Bluetechs sound if
required to do so for inventory, there is no mistaking the composer when you hear it. Alert,
deep-throated baselines roll in waves beneath jazzy keyboard splashes deftly fingered by the
classically trained pianist. Syncopated riffs lend a breakbeat feel to sparkling melody lines of
brushed-metallic yet joyfully warm timbre. Bright peaks sometimes surge on off beats, but even
songs lacking such classic reggae accents sway and pulse with dub undercurrents. Via crisp,
precision production, Bluetech embroiders tactile synesthesia into his aural quilts, handcrafting
seemingly three-dimensional sonic sculptures that tickle the brain and swell the spirit. Peaceful,
healing sounds surfing beats that lure listeners to the dance floor. Ear candy with soul.

Bluetech is a psy-scene favorite not only here in the Bay Area  where he grew up and got his
psy-feet wet  but all up and down the West Coast, as well. In fact, he likes to consider himself
a West Coast citizen as he can often be found in British Columbia  where he is based currently
 San Diego, and many points in between. He plays at Burning Man when he gets the chance, but is
often overseas performing live or DJ sets at other thriving events, such as Portugals Boom
Festival, Germanys Voov Festival and Underwater Overground in Croatia.

After playing at Synergenesis in November (an art, music and culture expo produced by
ExploreSpirit at CELLSpace on Bryant Street), Bluetech returns to San Francisco on March 11 for
Sound of Mind: the So-Cal desert-party troupe Moontribes takeover of 1015 Folsom. Hell be
featuring new tracks from his upcoming album  which will be his third following Prima Materia
(Waveform records) and Elementary Particles (Bluetechs own Native State Records). Both albums
were recently re-released internationally as a double CD by Israeli label Aleph Zero.

Bluetech is also eager to swoop through the Bay again in June for the Ambient Alchemy tour
(www.ambientalchemy.com). Happy to be spending some of his spring and summer at home in San
Francisco, Bluetech shares with The Observer his path from North Bayer to at-large North American,
as well as insights into his creative process.

"DJ is my main activity, working every weekend in
clubs or festivals since 1994. I started with hard
techno-acid sounds: Drop Bass Network, Analog,
Interr-Ferrence, Force Inc, SP23, to Detroit and
experimental techno. I figured out it expressed my
late teenage aggressivity. With experience, I got
musically softer and more open-minded.

Actually I play everything that entertains me:
minimal, deep, to kicking techno, mixed with funny our
leftfield tunes, classics, electro, no matter what it
is. That's why I hardly can describe my style. A 2h
monotone set really bores me. If I don't have fun
myself, I'm not able to please people.
DJing must be, in a way, something selfish. I shout it
loud: I don't do it for the people. I never pretended
to educate the audience, I just share a big part of
me, taking it as serious as I love it. Michael Mayer
(Kompakt records, Cologne) said: "Taking it serious
about having fun." Because 1st it's a job, and we
should never forget being paid to give pleasure to
people is a great privilege. If the risks I take in my
sets are my trademark, my priority is still to make
dance the ones who make my living. Question of
respect.

I think I have a sharp technique, pitch-control born
in my acid times, I consider my best weapon to focus
on musical choices.

I love playing records, it's probably the best thing I
know to do in life. I do it because it's big fun and
it makes me free, it even turns into a meditation kind
of thing. With records, nothing is planned, every
record is important. I often compares a DJ set to a
tennis game where each ball counts. But people know me
more for my voice even if I never took singing
lessons."

>>Actually I play everything that entertains me:
>>minimal, deep, to kicking techno, mixed with funny our

>>is. That's why I hardly can describe my style. A 2h
>>monotone set really bores me. If I don't have fun
>>myself, I'm not able to please people.
>>DJing must be, in a way, something selfish. I shout it
>>loud: I don't do it for the people. I never pretended
>>to educate the audience, I just share a big part of
>>me, taking it as serious as I love it. Michael Mayer
>>(Kompakt records, Cologne) said: "Taking it serious

>>I think I have a sharp technique, pitch-control born

>>on musical choices.
>>
>>I love playing records, it's probably the best thing I
>>know to do in life. I do it because it's big fun and
>>it makes me free, it even turns into a meditation kind
>>of thing. With records, nothing is planned, every
>>record is important. I often compares a DJ set to a
>>tennis game where each ball counts. But people know me
>>more for my voice even if I never took singing

I think these dudes are based in Berkeley. You've probably heard of them, and they don't focus *just on breaks. In any event, here's their newest (breaks) stock:

I like 'em.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] u.s. online record stores?

www.dropshop.com (pretty solid stock, even on the import side of things)

www.dmswax.com  (a little limited in scope, but you can get decent current 
favorites, etc.)

www.modernusic.com  (some people I know in Baltimore run this shop - they 
tend to have a solid little selection)

www.satelliterecords.com (although their service is kinda beat these days)

www.planetXusa.com (and these guys are just assholes - but they have 
selection)

Those oughtta cover you for the time being. I know good shops in the UK & 
Canada as well that aren't terribly priced. And a coule of eBay sellers that 
are tight too if you do the eBay thing.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii


i added a smooth house mix to my website done by homero espinoza, aka dj huey.

he's really one of the best house djs i've heard. i like to say that he really understands house music and how it should flow.

check it out:

http://www.djpistachio.com

or the direct link:

http://www.djpistachio.com/audio/homeroespinoza.mp3

also check out his record label's website, http://www.yerbabuenadiscos.com 

 yerba buena discos has been releasing some solid records, and they have some great stuff planned for this year. 
thanks,
carlos aka dj pistachio

Subject: Re: [sfraves] one.week.to.go...

i love new york but i love boston even better.

and about new york, get this.  i have a friend who lives in jersey but 
he lives only 5 minutes from the empire state building.  once you cross 
the holland tunnel you are in jersey.  it's crazy out here.  everything 
is toll roads.

and portland?  portland oregon?  no.  portland maine?  yeah.  portland 
maine is off limits right now cause they're snowed in again.  but i did 
get a peek ...

new york manhattan's look and feel is just like san francisco to me.  
boston is chill.  i think boston is going to be the next hot-spot, the 
next place to be, once they get done with this big dig stuff.  have any 
of you seen it or driven through it?  it's intense!  imagine all these 
freeways and freeway exits right underneath the city.  it would be like 
if they had extended interstate 280 and us 101 right into the middle of 
the city and put them underground and gave them interchanges and full 
entrance and exit services to boot.  absolutely amazing.  and you have 
full cell phone and fm radio in the tunnels.

i'm diggin this traveling stuff.  i'd like to live in boston for a 
while sometime.  i'll probably retire in santa cruz though, that's 
where deepfog, the name, and the infamous spirit was born.

anyway ryan have fun being away from us "paltry americans".

oh, speaking of americans, you guys should have been there when we were 
ganging up on the deer hunters we work with.  making maaaad fun of them 
and their damn magazines and spit cans they leave laying everywhere.  
that was a story for another day.  have fun.  git 'er done!

see you all at come-unity sunday afternoon ...  i've got a flight out 
of philly.

fog out

I have not danced so hard in a long ass time.  Blue Tech, John Kelly were my 
highlights as well as finally meeting John Dee off the list and almost 
making him puke from giving him a nice heart chakra rub  (Hi bud).  Always 
good family and the music was just extremely soul touching.  It was also 
neat seeing Osby "working"  hello 2day~! LOL

ahh.. 1015 - a place that i'll never forget and if you know me, i
forget very often :)
something is always to be had there if i might say modestly.  haven't
been to 1015 in ages so don't know how it's been but it's always been
around.  not sure of any management changes going on throught the
years but i must thank those who run the place for keeping it
available for all those who seek fun.  from accummulated experience, i
recall (caution: i don't remember bad things much): it has friendly
bouncers, cool djs, cool bartenders, attracting cool people to come
and dance and party, the best music and laser gears in the business
while juggling politics and laws that go into running an elaborate
place like that.  this is not easy to do folks for just making
everyone happy is not an easy thing.  i say this as a happy happy
paying customer.  in all, i've seen clubs come and go like baby
diapers but 1015 manages to be around surving through many seasons of
mainstream, underground, and sub cultures. congrats 1015!  please say
you'll always be around so that i can pass a piece of myself to my
kids when they grow up.

don't know of names and faces of folks in Family but i have heard of
them as sweet as honey.  if the Family name is the same, then there
might be a few old old timers that i might be able to recognize.  hey
osby, if you know and appreciate Family, i bet you are one cool
person.  thanks for sharing your experience.

l&hugs.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Moontribe Lastnight.. Oh yeah!

oh man, moontribe @ 1015 were awesome! i miss hearing those guys so
much! drove up from the peninsula at 2am and danced pretty much nonstop
till the end... last time i danced that much i think was at the last
moontribe :) (which was, alas, too long ago). and the crowd was so great
too! such a great vibe from everyone there.

all the dj's were really good that i heard, but especially the crazy
breaks/trip-hop/whatever you wanna call it that was happening in the
front room around 2:45 or 3am, and mr. annand's house set upstairs at
the end of the night. that guy was just on fire! i went up for the
beginning of his set all exhausted already and he just nailed the energy
of the crowd.. it started off slow, let people get into it, then built
up and drew you in. he knew exactly when to back off a bit and when to
push it up a notch. before i knew it, i, and everyone else in the room,
were completely jacking to the music :)

does anyone know who the dj was in the front around 3am? i looked at the
lineup but completely forgot. best i can describe his music, it was like
aphex twin, but way more intense :) anyways, i'm so happy that this
coincided with my visit back. friday night totally made my month!
tomorrow i'm back to relatively ravefree nyc...

ahh.. 1015 - a place that i'll never forget and if you know me, i
forget very often :)
something is always to be had there if i might say modestly.  haven't
been to 1015 in ages so don't know how it's been but it's always been
around.  not sure of any management changes going on throught the
years but i must thank those who run the place for keeping it
available for all those who seek fun.  from accummulated experience, i
recall (caution: i don't remember bad things much): it has friendly
bouncers, cool djs, cool bartenders, attracting cool people to come
and dance and party, the best music and laser gears in the business
while juggling politics and laws that go into running an elaborate
place like that.  this is not easy to do folks for just making
everyone happy is not an easy thing.  i say this as a happy happy
paying customer.  in all, i've seen clubs come and go like baby
diapers but 1015 manages to be around surving through many seasons of
mainstream, underground, and sub cultures. congrats 1015!  please say
you'll always be around so that i can pass a piece of myself to my
kids when they grow up.

don't know of names and faces of folks in Family but i have heard of
them as sweet as honey.  if the Family name is the same, then there
might be a few old old timers that i might be able to recognize.  hey
osby, if you know and appreciate Family, i bet you are one cool
person.  thanks for sharing your experience.

l&hugs.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Moontribe Lastnight.. Oh yeah!

i've been going to 1015 since the early days of Come-Unity, and i've=20
watched it go from wonderful, vibey, and friendly, to a police state. =20=

i was reluctant to go to 1015 last friday because of this, but the pull=20=

of Moontribe was too hard to resist. we had several MT dj's who played=20=

at the Friends & Family/Brass Tax campout last summer, and i just had=20
to see them again.

the club didn't disappoint this time. security was friendly - no=20
emptying wallets, checking pockets, tossing lip balm, etc. - just a=20
quick pat-down and we were in quickly. my friend had to leave early and=20=

get her things out of my car, and the bouncer at the door even let me=20
leave and come back in (!).

(i'm not sure if the new attitude of security was because of the crowd=20=

that was there, but it was a refreshing change from the usual treatment=20=

at 1015.)

on top of this, the front room has been remodeled, with two new=20
restrooms added, and great lighting effects on the walls. the sound is=20=

much better in the main room, and the lights are still as wild as ever.

the drinks still suck and are overpriced though.

the music was great, with John Kelly being the highlight of the evening=20=

for me, even though he didn't go on until 3:30 am. i can only imagine=20
what one of his morning sets must be like in the middle of the=20
Mojave... :-)

the afterparty... it started at around 7 am at a house in the Castro=20
that all the Moontribe people were crashing at for the weekend (all 20=20=

of them!).  the music at the afterparty was mainly MT dj's, playing=20
some 120-125 bpm stuff that was perfect for the cracked-out foggy=20
morning. i left the afterparty at 1:30 pm, and it was still going=20
strong.  amazing.

there is a MT desert party in 2 weeks, if anyone's interested.  i made=20=

some great connections at the Friends & Family campout and this past=20
weekend, and i'd love to get down to the desert to see what Moontribe=20
is like in their native environment.

carpool, anyone?  i have a passenger van that seats 8.  :-)

The desert parties are totally worth it, you get a great mix of SoCal
people and some Bay Area folks as well... I've been to three total going
back a few years.  Hoping to make it to one this summer.

Something like that. I had one really good night at 1015. The Groove
premier afterparty there on a tuesday. 300 people tops and none of the
usual trash that shows up. Basically people that appreciated the music
and knew what was up were there. That's it. That's all I can think of
when it comes to good times at 1015.

>From what I hear it still the boring ass lame people that would pack
that place still come. I say let it go under for a year and force them
out.

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Trying to find tickets to see flogging molly tonight..

Flogging molly is at the Warfield tonight. They're basically the only
thing I listen to other than EDM, and it'd kick much ass to be able to
see them before I leave tomorrow. Being as I completely suck, and
didn't come prepared, was wondering if anyone on her would perhaps
have an extra ticket they could part with? I checked ticketmaster, but
couldn't find anything on where to get them. Was hoping maybe someone
on here has one, or knows where I can get one in very short notice.

Thanks

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Moontribe Lastnight.. Oh yeah!

I just realized I haven't done a review in 2 years, so here goes.

This was the first time I've ever gone to 1015, so I didn't really
have any expectations for the party one way or another. The last 2
years in Arizona have really burned me out, and have actually made it
very not fun for me to go out anymore.

Anyhow, enough bitching..

So I walked up to 1015 with osby around 9:45, waited outside for about
20 minutes with Russ and this very humorous slightly inebriated girl
whom I guess is a friend of mike's also. Her name eludes met though.
So up comes about 10:05 or so and they begin to let us in. Osby had
gone to all this trouble to get me on guestlist, and then I wouldn't
have even needed it that night.

So I finally get inside a little Mike starts spinning. To be honest, I
was enjoying the music, but the vibe just wasn't there at first. I
wasn't having a good time. Plus, I don't recall EVER paying 10 dollars
a shot for alcohol. Honestly, my butt hurt after that one. bought 2
shots, and 2 beers right off the bat. 30 bucks.

So I was standing around, taking up space on the dancefloor, talking
to becca and others, being incredibly dorky, but didn't dance much. I
don't make for that great of a dancer while I'm un-drunk. In fact,
it's very difficult for me to dance while un-drunk, since I'm paranoid
of my white-boy syndrome. As I'm just chillin, I run into at least 15
people that I used to know.

So after mike's set, and his attempted sexual assault on the
dancefloor, I walked around for a while and checked out the other
rooms with Stacey. Ended up hanging out with her a majority of the
night.

Finally met Danny Picard. Been talking to him for years.  That was
pretty groovy.

Anyhow, finally got out of there around 6ish in the morning or so (I
think). Funniest part was getting a ride the whole block and a half
back to G's place. I think the car was actually farther away than
George's place was from the club. Can't complain though. Great
company, and great people to hang out with.

I'm sorry if I wasn't able to say goodbye to most people. As most of
my friends had left by that time in the night. It was pretty cool
though, at least talking to all my old friends.

Kinda nice not being banished to the desert anymore though. :)

Subject: [sfraves] NRR:  Former republican finds some principles...

http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2005/03/14/state/n162642S50.DTL

Not only was he a republican, but also a catholic, and an appointee of Pete
"How I hate the hispanic community, let me count the 187 ways." Wilson!!! (/Me/
chuckles with glee at our bitch-ass, evil-bigot governor and the rest of his
little fundie hatemongering buddies.)

It won't stand, of course. Our supreme court took their own stand with the
forces of hate last year, when they backed up the governor in his anti-gay
campaign. So there's little doubt how they'll rule when the neocons inevitably
appeal.

But still, to see a (ex-, I suppose... now...)republican, catholic,
Wilson-appointee turn over to the side of justice and equality... it shows that
the wheels of progress ARE turning, however slowly.

Too bad you can't recognize conservatives on sight. I'd love to find one
tomorrow, break out my best (not very good though, actually) Nelson Muntz
voice, shout "HaHaaa!!!" and laugh hysterically in its face.

So.... uh.... yeah.... With further apologies to Matt Groening: WooHoo!!!!


cya,
john

Subject: [sfraves] Come-Unity :)

I am looking at the 1000+ pictures I took of Come-Unity, and I am so 
ECSTATIC to see all the smiles on everyone's faces.... amongst the many 
places, we had such good graces, fine music setting many paces, and 
leaving behind any concept of rat races....

My review is coming later, as are the photos.. Much Love to each every one 
of you. Thank you for making it out to show your support for Come-Unity's 
14 year Birthday Bash!

<3 Karina

Subject: [sfraves] Looking for a roommate in Santa Rosa

Sorry this is a bit off topic.
Avaliable 4/1
I am looking for a roommate to share a two bedroom apartment in
downtown. The apartment is in a small garden complex between the
fairgrounds and Sonoma on Brookwood. 
There is a 500 dollar security deposit. The rent includes water and
garbage. PG&E generally runs between 20 and 40 dollars (your half) and
if you want to use it there is wireless DSL which would be 17 dollars a
month. 
Common areas have some furniture already, but I would be open to
additions that fit with the current decor. 

I am looking for someone who will not have any problem keeping common
areas neat and clean, also someone who is respectful of others. 

If this sounds like a place you would be intrested in please reply to
this posting with a little information about yourself as well as the
best way and times to contact you. 

Thanks 
Candi

1965, Ken Kesey, author of "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest", and his band
of Merry Pranksters stage the first Acid Test; a radical and psychedelic
experiment based around music and lighting projections in Santa Cruz County.
Many Acid Tests would follow the Soquel Acid Test, and would prove to be a
major catalyst of things to come in the counter-culture revolution of the
1960's. Circa 25 years later, a different revolution was occuring on the
Beaches and in the Deserts of California. Under the watch of the full moon,
DJ's such as Doc Martin, and Garth and Jeno of the Wicked Crew introduced
House and Electronic music to thousands, and would lay the foundation for
the West Coast Sound for the next decade plus.

Join us as we celebrate all that is positive with the Old, the New, and
everything in between. Re-experience the pure and virgin energy that helped
create and build our House Nation.


Stay tuned for Free Outdoor parties in the weeks before and after Acid Test

Andrew is too kind- he did a *GREAT* deal of work on these tracks, from
sample searchin' to scads arranging, tons of editing, and keeping
things dj friendly.  Without him, this stuff would sound, well, like
all the other Origami house stuff. :)  He is fast becoming a studio
whiz and these tracks show that off.

Just wanted to set dee record straight! :)

OMG! I know exactly who you mean. He ended up being the "Star Trek Nerd" on 
that short lived Comedy Central game show "Beat The Geeks". I laugh 
hysterically every time I see him on Trekkies, which is one of the funniest 
movies ever produced.

Too funny.

if anyone would like to contact M.O.D. and let him know that you
enjoyed his mix, please feel free to email him at:

mod@evilbreaks.com

and he's a really nice guy, very good on the decks.  and despite the
fact that he is known for his progressive breaks, he can also get
pretty funky and has some scratching skills!

Subject: [sfraves] $10 list for Evil Breaks Anniversary - this saturday!!!

ok, our $10 online tickets are gone!  presales are now $15 in stores
and online.  door tickets are going to be $20!

however, i'm going to hook up my SFR friends with the $10 list!  but
just to make it fun, you'll have to correctly answer one of the
following questions.  all questions refer to something i've posted on
this list in years past.  first 3 people that answer one of them
correctly gets in for $10!

1)  where did i pass out drunk after my first ever experience playing
in front of a crowd?  or, what did i wake up wearing?  hint:  it was
at a house party in april 2002 in berkeley at a co-op.  i got
absolutely tanked and don't remember most of the evening.

 2)  my first time playing at a club/bar was at a party Summer 2002
that i threw with my friends Moshen and Tim (both from SFR).  what was
the party called or where was it at?  or, name another DJ that played
that night.

3)  where did i first meet Osby?

ready, set, go!

Subject: [sfraves] anyone handy with a camera?

anyone handy with a camera and who has a good digital camera that can
shoot in a variety of lighting situations that is either a photo
hobbyist or who takes photos on some kind of regular basis?  anything
from portraits to action shots to candid shots to nightlife?

and if this is you...would you be interested in donating your services
for this saturday night?  you'd get free entrance to the Evil Breaks
one year, but you'd have to commit to taking photos for most of the
event.

hit me back off list!

Wow, its almost like somebody should start a site that takes pictures of 
raves and posts them on the Internet. I dunno if anybody would go out of

Yeah, I haven't used the ravepictures one for a while, and 
Dazedandconfused.com went under (MyOwnEmail sucks).

Jay was saying something about the love and 'bond' the two of you 
shared? I must be confused.....

thread hijacking is grate!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] New mix from Origami & Andrew Phelan

i would like to publicly state that i am enjoying this mix very much.

it's grooving me the fuck out for real.

nice job you guys.  and all this time i thought andrew was only a
crossfader twiddler and george only plucked a few strings.  ;)

honestly, this mix is really nice.

My ex-roomate back in DC (whom I kinda don't like) has a pretty decent site 
: www.planetedm.com
that is geared towards this.

No reason on earth that someone from this area couldn't do the same (or 
better).

Subject: [sfraves] Happy Birthday Brian Behlendorf & SFRaves / SFRCal (in advance)! 

This MONTH -
Brian Behlendorf's Birthday falls on the 30th of March.... :)
March 2005 SFRaves turns 13 YEARS OLD :) (March 1992 -> March 
2005) SFRaves is now a teenager!
Also: SFRaves Calendar is now a decade old :) (March 1995 -> March 2005)

It is any coincidence that all three share a birthday in the same month?

Happy Birthday to you Brian - in advance :) Thank you for creating this 
wonderful community 13 beautiful years ago...

<3 Karina

Subject: [sfraves] Re: $10 list for Evil Breaks Anniversary - this saturday!!!

well ok, fuck.  those questions were way too random.

first 3 people who email me back get in to the party for $10.

fyi, the answers to the following questions were:

> 1)  where did i pass out drunk after my first ever experience playing
> in front of a crowd?  or, what did i wake up wearing? 

i passed out ON TOP of the turntables.  my friend has a photo of this.
 i woke up in my bed wearing a tshirt and socks.

> 
>  2)  my first time playing at a club/bar was at a party Summer 2002
> that i threw with my friends Moshen and Tim (both from SFR).  what was
> the party called or where was it at?  or, name another DJ that played
> that night.

it was called Retrograde and was held at Amnesia.  the other DJs that
night were Ms. Throwdown, Konkers and GBA.

> 3)  where did i first meet Osby?

on the steps of City Hall at the Unity party.

Subject: [sfraves] Steroid use in MLB and The RAVE Act II

This is just a rough draft of an idea that i just posted to the local
DC Craig's List BB, that I feel has some merit for us in Rave
community.

If this Congress insists on pursuing this course about steroid use I
feel it's only fair to remind them that they've already passed a Law
regarding this and they might want to start enforcing it.

Anyhow, like I said, this is just a rough draft, but i'd like to
nurture & amplify it a bit and if anyone's got any suggestions as to
how to do that, beside's not giving my LaTourrette's Syndrome full
fucking fly, I know that one, I'd really appreciate the help.

Here's the link, which expires in 30 days or so:

http://washingtondc.craigslist.org/rnr/64228387.html

thanks!

Hell yeah Justin Thyme! If you don't mind I'm going to post your
original letter in a bunch of different forums. We need to get this RAVE
act enforced and put those owners in jail NOW before more people get
hurt.

This is just a rough draft of an idea that i just posted to the local
DC Craig's List BB, that I feel has some merit for us in Rave
community.

If this Congress insists on pursuing this course about steroid use I
feel it's only fair to remind them that they've already passed a Law
regarding this and they might want to start enforcing it.

Anyhow, like I said, this is just a rough draft, but i'd like to
nurture & amplify it a bit and if anyone's got any suggestions as to
how to do that, beside's not giving my LaTourrette's Syndrome full
fucking fly, I know that one, I'd really appreciate the help.

Here's the link, which expires in 30 days or so:

http://washingtondc.craigslist.org/rnr/64228387.html

thanks!

Thanks man, somewhere down the road here we're going to do one that
represents our live DJ/bass sets, good bit different mixing style and
general vibe than this one.

Hey thanks Steve.

Lead with the original Craigslist post, if you don't mind, 

http://washingtondc.craigslist.org/rnr/64228387.html .

Be interesting if this got some traction and George Steinbrenner or
Peter Magowan or Steve Schott were staring at doing some serious
Federale time.

Can't you just see it?

Certainly would make the average overfed and overdressed, Red State,
red meat eating, sport fan's head spin, wouldn't it?

How much do you want to bet the Law would then be challenged on
grounds of being Unconstitutional?

I just left a very polite VM on Senator Joe Biden's office just now,
asking as politely as possible why it is that neither he, nor anyone
else up on The Hill, has picked up on how applicable the RAVE Act is
to this issue.

I left it at that i will be calling back for an answer and will be
asking this question to everyone I know.

I just got up from a nap and the hearing itself just broke up. Damn.
Bet Mark McGwire is feeling more drained right now then when he hit
70.

I halfway considered going up there today to present this idea to
people, F2F, 1-on-1, but I figured my time was better spent on the
internets with this, since I can't fucking abide these corrupt
rat-bastids.

Be nice if the idea were to get out of the forums and enter the
Blogo-sphere as well.

have a great day.

nwa

Don't jinx it!

My prediction: it's going to rain early--tomorrow and maybe Friday, then
continue to look menacing through Saturday night, and miraculously clear
up on Sunday morning. The clouds will part, and we shall dance to house
music all day long.

Or not. I hope they can postpone it until next week if it rains... I'm
leaving the country for all of April and May, and I don't want to miss
the Sunset opener!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Happy Birthday Brian Behlendorf & SFRaves / SFRCal (in advance)!

umm, and let us not forget the role Brian had in birthing, oh, say..... 

Apache. 

without which *none* of us would even be having *any* of this blessed
conversation on the internets.

picture this.....

no listservs, googles, yahoos, streaming porns, p2p-mp3s, flash, sql,
live blogging, emailsies, well no, wait that might still exist in
crappy command line, non-html, pine mode, the list is endlesss......

none of it.

we'd all be in the dark, in a cold, sleeting rain, banging two rocks
together, hoping to get a spark, to light a fire, just so we could
keep warms, in the hopes that we could find one another, someways,
somehows.

thanks to his modest efforts there are now 8+ billion, instantly
accessible, web-pages that didn't exist 10 years ago.

that's nothing to sneeze at.

ya think?

planet earth owes a man like mr. behlendorf a living, but yet, it
keeps throwing nonsense like the bush administration and things like
the rave act at him and people like him and us.

what's up with that?

things are all fucked up inside out and backwards here and it's no
wonder a movie with a title like:

'sideways'

struck such a chord with so many people.

anyways, i don't know any other way to put it, 'cept to say, happy
fucking birthday, and thank you 4 being you.

many happy fucking returns.

peace the fuck out,

nwa

ps: it kills me that this thug will become musically immortal because
of this riff, but here goes:

"Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go shorty!
It's your birthday!
We gon' party like it's yo birthday!
We gon' sip Bacardi like it's your birthday!
And you know we don't give a fuck!
It's not your birthday! "

hear, hear.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Happy Birthday Brian Behlendorf & SFRaves / SFRCal
 (in advance)!

I am very grateful for Apache - after all, many of the websites I host, am 
webmistress of, boxes I ch0wn, test or develop on, applications I use, etc 
run in Apache webserver environment.

Taz, the box I'm connecting from, which gives life to 
Hyperreal.org and SFRaves.org runs Apache...

I am very appreciative of this technology that Mr Behlendorf, a friend 
named Brian co-authored and gave life to not only as a innovative open 
source project, but a technology that has standardized a way of software 
development and freedom of information like none other - Open Source - 
Apache is an innovation of of higher power of software development.

I concur with his notion that there are many cases where innovation and 
creativity in Software Development have been squashed by commercialization 
/ profit driven software development; in effect has made many an attempt 
"rip the soul out of development"; I believe in his axiom of having a 
higher purpose in software through an increase in colloboration, trust and 
transparency.

Historically, Apache's history is colorful. In the beginning:

"...Brian Behlendorf says he's not a very good programmer because "I use 
trial and error a little too much." Yet at the ripe old age of 21, 
Behlendorf orchestrated one of the most successful business software 
projects ever. He and fellow developers produced Apache, the free server 
software that today powers 70% of all Web sites. If copies of Apache were 
sold for the same price as Microsoft's comparable server software, its 
sales would total over $500 million. But Behlendorf didn't make a dime off 
it..." Forbes 03.14.05

  "...To serve up the Web pages Organic hosted for companies, Behlendorf 
used free, open source server software maintained by faculty and students 
at the University of Illinois' National Center for Supercomputing 
Applications. The project was left to wither in 1994 when Netscape hired 
away most of the tech-savvy Illinois students. Behlendorf adopted the code 
and put in the groundwork for a hierarchy-free meritocracy. Developers 
with lots of successful work on Apache gain access to tweak the code 
directly. He set up a mailing list to coordinate updates and bug fixes, 
and helped create a voting system to approve work. New code requires three 
plus votes and no vetos. If a developer votes no, he or she has to help 
improve the project. Apache surpassed Sun's and Microsoft's rival servers 
in only six months, in part because the software was free."It was the 
world's most efficient R&D effort," says Behlendorf..." Forbes 03.14.05

"..Now, at the riper age of 31, Behlendorf is realizing where his true 
strengths lie:influencing people to change the way they do things. In his 
new role as technosocial scientist, Behlendorf travels the world exhorting 
companies to work together to take back control of their software 
destinies from the Microsofts, Oracles and SAPsof the world. Only a third 
of software outlays go for canned code from Microsoft and its competitors; 
the other two-thirds pay for legions of in-house programmers at places 
like Boeing, Bank of America and Wal-Mart. There's no reason they should 
be working in isolation. Write code together, share it, swap it and get 
the job done faster, cheaper and more efficiently..." 	Forbes 03.14.05

It's fantastic to read about you Brian in Forbes Magazine :)

http://www.forbes.com/business/forbes/2005/0314/073_2.html

I remember when Apache.org, python.org among others were virtually hosted 
side by side with Hyperreal, like opensource.org (taz hosts many 
resourceful sites) - among some Hyperreal host now - some of my favorites: 
(too many to list)

bbs.hyperreal.org
compassion.org
ecstacy.org
erowid.org
djsets.hyperreal.org
grid.hyperreal.org
machines.hyperreal.org
microsound.com
media.hyperreal.org
moby.org
music.hyperreal.org
opensource.org
rhythm.org
sfjungle.com
sflnc.com
sisterdjs.com
squishy.org
sushi.org
theorb.com
trainspotter.hyperreal.org
vjmc.org

etc :)

13 years in the making, a teenager grows up.
31 years in the flesh, what a blessing.

Happy Birthday Brian!

OK.. sooooooooooooo much unexpected fun lastnight man... YUM!!!

OK.. so like 1st off, I went 2 school, normal Wed night, then on my way
home eerrr. 2 BART, I made a pit stop @ Butter 2 well.. the 1st night of a

CooL 'cause he was fuckin' Rockin' the HOuse... Really Mellow like I
guess... I mean... almost Tribal I guess w/ a small hint of disco kinda
funky stuff... I Loved it!!!

But I dunno.... I thought that there was gonna be like all the residents
showingup 2 kick it, but that wasn't the case & it was only well.. Rooz &
his DJ mafia Crew... LoL.. I did Groove 4 a while....

So i dunno.. I felt kinda bad like leaving early in his set, but I was
just thinkin' like, "OK.. I was here, showed up, I gotta get home & watch
'The Division' on LIfetime"... so I said my bye 2 evey1 there who works @
Butter & walked up 11th 1 go 2 bart...

So I'm walkin' & I hear Jungle all of a sudden & I stop & listen.. oh
shit.. I was in front of Studio Z.. OH SHIT, I promised 2 be there 'cause
the promoters wanted me there WEEEEEEEEEKS ago!  I also heard my name
"OSBY" when I was standing there like tryin' 2 not B confuzed & it was my
Big Sis Angelica who I been YAY... & Ivry was w/ her & he asked me if I
wanted 2 walk in w/ them, so I did... YAY

OK.. Kinetik was on the decks... when we got in there.. YUM.. I mean.. he
was like playing like really hard style DNB raga beats. .it was Dope!!!
Ummm... Aye~N & Ivry went on next (& 4 sake of like not knowing the right
term & 2 just say' something that described it) & they played some hard
bounce dub the way I like it!oh gosh.. who went on next.. ummm.. ok...
oh.. Raise & 4Real went on next & fuck man... it got more Hard & Bouncy I
mea.. like ooh.. I Love when 4 Real spins 'cause he just knows what 2 play
like I can't expplain it but I've always called him 1 of my fave Jungle
DJs 'cause he always plays what I wanna hear.. well.. be it that it was
this tag set!!  But yeah.. Raise didn't play 2 much Rock Jungle this time

like the Proggy house.. but man.. I Loved what I heard!!!  YAY!!!

Then after hangin' out there 4 a while & kickin' it w/ like every1 there &
hmm.. got in some pictures... went back 2 Studio Z.. YAY!!!

Xplisit was on the decks.. WOW.. he was playing "It's Gonna Be a Fine Day
Tonight" jungle remix... oh shit.. it was Dope.. but man... Xplisit went
hard w/ his set & played just some hard stuff the rest off the night...
Kinetik did jump back in & play some light dubby stuff in the middle of
the hard.. it was actually neat when that happen!!

All in all, it was a Groovy adventure!!  Oh yeah.. so Xplisit said he'd

The US is:  "...a nation of 200 million used-car salesmen with all the 
money we need to buy guns and no qualms about killing anybody else in the 
world who tries to make us uncomfortable."
-Hunter S. Thompson

"Death is our eternal companion.  It is always to our left, at an arm's 
length.  It has always been watching you.  It always will until the day it 
taps you.  The thing to do when you're impatient is...to turn to your left 
and ask advice from death.  An immense amount of pettiness is dropped if 
your death makes a gesture to you, or if you catch a glimpse of it, or if 
you just catch the feeling that your companion is there watching you."
-Carlos Castaneda

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

kinda sounds like the holy hand grenade..

Then did he raise on high the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch, saying,
"Bless this, O Lord, that with it thou mayst blow thine enemies to
tiny bits, in thy mercy." And the people did rejoice and did feast
upon the lambs and toads and tree-sloths and fruit-bats and orangutans
and breakfast cereals ... Now did the Lord say, "First thou pullest
the Holy Pin. Then thou must count to three. Three shall be the number
of the counting and the number of the counting shall be three. Four
shalt thou not count, neither shalt thou count two, excepting that
thou then proceedeth to three. Five is right out. Once the number
three, being the number of the counting, be reached, then lobbest thou
the Holy Hand Grenade in the direction of thine foe, who, being
naughty in my sight, shall snuff it.

Not to diminish Brians considerable contribution, but apache is not
the www. It is fallacious to imply the web would not exist without
apache. It most certainly would.

Perhaps better to say that apache gave us free and corporate
unhindered web serving early on. Combined with Linux, this really
opened the door to letting the everyman be a webmaster, kicking open
Pandoras box *before* the corporate could gain momentum and tie it
down with controls.

So I see Brian's contribution not so much being that the www
exists... I consider it's existence inevitable. Rather, I see it as
key to it's open (and unsupressable) character that we enjoy.

And it would be wrong to say Brian =~ Apache.  Just like here at SFRaves, 
I planted a seed and spent sleepless nights on it for a good chunk of 
time, and then stepped back and let more-capable others step in and make 
it something bigger than any single person could make it.  And just like 
here, I lurk in the shadows and pipe up when provoked... :)

As many of you know, the last Sunset Party of 2004 was rained out. Well, it 
looks as though we are still lurking under this dark and wet cloud for 
Sunday. Instead of waiting till the last minute to see if the weather will 
clear for us we have decided to make an earlier decision and postpone this 
Sundays Sunset Party until April 10th. This is being done for several reasons.

1st from the Rangers: it seems pretty promising that even if it doesn't 
actually rain on Sunday the ground will be saturated and wet which will 
cause the grass to be certainly torn up badly with our large group, not to 
mention uncomfortable to sit on. This ground saturation also effects the 
extended parking lots of Stafford Lake, these will turn to mud and cause 
stuck cars.

2nd from us: By making this decision now we will save hundreds of dollars 
in costs for the day by being able to cancel portable toilets, the truck, 
and generator rental with plenty of notice. We lost this money last year 
with our late cancelation and cannot afford to do this again since we just 
do not have the financial resources to throw away money like that. As we 
have said before this event costs nearly $1500 to put on. Now, there is the 
slight chance we could pull off the event between storms, but that is just 
not where we are at after a decade of Sunset Parties. Especially for the 
1st Sunset party off the year where we want everyone to come and enjoy 
spring together in the sun. And especially in a year where we are doing 
less events and want each one to be as special as it can be.

So please pass the word that we will be back in action in a few weeks. 
April 10th is first available date that will work with the Park and our 
schedules, so hopefully this will also give you all a chance to get work 
off again, change flights, and rental cars. So, in this fashion we will be 
bringing in Spring with a storm of our own...back to back weekends of fun 
since the 1st Boat party of the year will happen on April 17th on a Brand 
New Boat for us with greater capacity and a gem of the San Francisco Bay...

The `Most Sampled Woman in Hip-Hop' Mourned
By Davey D

Last weekend, hip-hop lost one of its great icons. But sadly, not a
whole lot of us have taken time to acknowledge her.

Singer Lyn Collins earned a spot in hip-hop history as one of the
culture's key architects. Those who grew up listening to artists like
Foxy Brown, Lil' Kim, Trina and Jacki-O may never have heard of
Collins. Those who grew up on Queen Latifah, MC Lyte, Salt-N-Pepa and
Roxanne Shante heard echoes of Collins in their music, though they may
have not realized it. Those who came up in the era of pioneers such
as Queen Lisa Lee, Pebbly Poo and Mercedes Ladies, to name a few, will
of course remember Collins, though it was years later that she made
her greatest contributions to hip-hop. Gloria Lyn Collins was born on
June 12, 1948, in Lexington, Texas. She got her start when she hooked
up with two relatives -- a guy named Catfish and another named Bootsy
-- to do some singing. Oh yes, you read that right: the Bootsy
Collins of Parliament/Funkadelic fame.

'Debt to James Brown'

In the early '70s, when hip-hop was rising from the rubble and ashes
of the Bronx, a man by the name of James Brown ``discovered'' Lyn and
her relatives, who joined his band. The rest, as they say is history.
Collins, an electrifying musician with a powerful voice, sang backup
for Brown. She stood out from his singers, and the Godfather of Soul
nicknamed her the Female Preacher.

In 1972, Collins released a solo album with the classic jam ``Think
(About It),'' which would be instrumental in earning Collins her place
in hip-hop. For starters it was a staple heard often at early hip-hop
jams. Second, it was used in the megahit ``It Takes Two,'' by Rob
Base and DJ EZ Rock, which many consider to be one of the most
influential rap records of all time. It's Collins' sampled voice we
hear singing, ``It takes two to make a thing go right.'' The song has
been sampled more than 100 times, making Collins ``the most sampled
woman in hip-hop.''

As if that weren't enough, Collins had more hit records through the
years, including ``Mama Feelgood,'' ``Rock Me Again and Again'' and
``Take Me As I Am.''

We caught up with singer-producer Bowlegged Lou of the legendary
hip-hop band Full Force, who has produced music for James Brown. Lou
said, ``Anyone that was associated with James Brown's band means a lot
to hip-hop . . . but Lyn Collins was, in my opinion, the most
soulful and most popular of the James Brown female singers. You also
had Vicki Anderson and Marva Whitney, but Lyn was a great,
no-holds-barred singer, and all us hip-hop musicians, artists and
music lovers held her songs in high regard.''

Lou went on to say that many hip-hop producers know Collins' name but
not her legacy, and many hip-hop artist don't know her name but know
her voice.

``We were fortunate to produce James' comeback album in 1988, and he
told us lots of great stories about Lyn Collins,'' Lou said. ``She
will be missed.''

`Classy and sassy'

University of California-Berkeley professor and ``History of Funk''
broadcaster Rickey Vincent said, ``Lyn Collins was the most glamorous
of the James Brown singers. She elevated the whole production when
she joined the band. She was classy and sassy and represented
womanhood to a generation who were weaned on James Brown and the Black
Power movement. She let women know you could be strong, sassy and
powerful and feminine at the same time, which wasn't easy.'' Vincent
noted that, at the time of her death at age 56, Collins was still
touring, a testament to her staying power.

``If hip-hop is going to show respect for the elders who are sampled
in our songs, then they should spend a little time and respect the
life path they went through,'' Vincent added. ``Lyn Collins is
definitely someone worth knowing.''

Subject: [sfraves] My Mikey and Me

Whoever thought mike and I weren't cool, very untrue. I just had to
give him shit (which he most definitely HAD to expect) from certain
events on friday night.

Sorry to burst your bubble, kids.  I love the guy, but not in the "try
to take off my pants in the middle of 1015 and buttsecks me there
right in front of the bar" kinda way.

or do I?

Ok - so here it is 7 months later and I finally got around to listening to 
this mix, lol. I know - sad as hell, right?

Well, it's a SICK mix. Blippy and glitchy in spots, funky and chunky in 
spots. Most of the mixing is spot on with a couple of VERY minor slips that 
last all of a millisecond.

Tech-house touches me in my happy spot.

Go listen.

Subject: [sfraves] new (old) mix: Slow Down!

So this thing has been languishing on my hard drive since last August. I
recently resurrected it from an old backup, and thought it was pretty
cool so I'm sharing it with you. Fair warning: this ain't no dance mix.
It's much better suited for zoning out at work, smoking something
illicit, recovering from a nasty hangover, or making out.

The title refers to the fact that this is--by far--the slowest mix I've
ever done. I just hit record one day when I was listening to some new
records, and once I noticed that it was sounding good I gathered up some
older stuff and threw it into the mix. A few records in, I realized that
I was pitching things waaaay down to keep in step. Turns out the track I
started things off with was about 120bpm! Anyway, give it a listen if
that sounds interesting. Fans of so-called "heroin house", dub, and IDM
will not want to miss this.

The title refers to the fact that this is--by far--the slowest mix I've
ever done. I just hit record one day when I was listening to some new
records, and once I noticed that it was sounding good I gathered up some
older stuff and threw it into the mix. A few records in, I realized that
I was pitching things waaaay down to keep in step. Turns out the track I
started things off with was about 120bpm! Anyway, give it a listen if

It is difficult to just show up and get tickets as they usually sold =
out.
You can order tickets online and pick them up at the dock.

I was told (not that I am 100% positive about the info tho), that you should 
book tours about a month in advance due to serious demand . Anyone know if 
that sounds accurate?

I think it depends on the time of year.  During the summer tourist season 
it's quite difficult to obtain tickets at the ferry office.  However, it 
shouldn't be a problem in the spring.  Joey and I just went down there on 
an impulse one day, bought tickets, and did the rock.  Much 
fun.  http://www.blueandgoldfleet.com/ for info.

If it's convenient we just might join ya all.

Love,

"Death is our eternal companion.  It is always to our left, at an arm's 
length.  It has always been watching you.  It always will until the day it 
taps you.  The thing to do when you're impatient is...to turn to your left 
and ask advice from death.  An immense amount of pettiness is dropped if 
your death makes a gesture to you, or if you catch a glimpse of it, or if 
you just catch the feeling that your companion is there watching you."

Wow...big surprise here.

Virginity Pledges Fail to Protect Teens from STDs

Contributed by Gina Borgsdof | 19 March, 2005  19:43 GMT


'Teens, regardless of whether they have a taken a virginity pledge, are 
engaging in behaviors that put them at risk for STDs and unintended 
pregnancy. It is vitally important that we provide all teens with the 
information and skills they need to protect themselves.'

"Virginity pledges" -- that is, public promises to remain virgins until 
marriage -- do not protect the young people who make them from the risk of 
engaging in unsafe sexual practices that could lead to sexually transmitted 
diseases (STDs), suggests a new study published in the March 18, issue of 
the Journal of Adolescent Health.

In fact, the study participants who made the virignity pledges contracted 
STDs at the same rate as their peers who had not pledged. The pledgers were 
less likely to use condoms to prevent STDs, and they were less likely to 
seek medical testing and treatment, increasing possibility of transmission, 
the researchers found.

Alternative Behaviors

Study authors Hannah Bruckner of Yale University and Peter Bearman of 
Columbia University concluded that some pledgers engaged in alternative 
sexual behaviors in order to preserve their virginity. In fact, among those 
who had not had vaginal intercourse, pledgers were more likely to have 
engaged in both oral and anal sex than their non-pledging peers.

Among virgins, male and female pledgers were six time more likely to have 
had oral sex than non-pledgers, and male pledgers were four times more 
likely to have had anal sex than those who had not pledged, the research 
shows.

"This research confirms what we have known for a long time," says Bill 
Smith, vice president for public policy at the Sexuality Information and 
Education Council of the United States (SIECUS). "Teens, regardless of 
whether they have a taken a virginity pledge, are engaging in behaviors 
that put them at risk for STDs and unintended pregnancy. It is vitally 
important that we provide all teens with the information and skills they 
need to protect themselves," Smith continues.

'Enough Is Enough'

Virginity pledges are the cornerstone of many federally funded 
abstinence-only-until-marriage programs. Since 1982, the U.S. government 
has spent over a billion dollars on unproven abstinence-only-until-marriage 
programs. Of that billion, $620 million dollars has been spent in just the 
last seven years.

Under the leadership of President Bush, there has been a continued 
expansion of investment in these programs with $168 million allocated in 
Fiscal Year 2005 alone. Now, the President is seeking an all-time high of 
$206 million in his proposed Fiscal Year 2006 budget. These programs are 
prohibited from discussing contraceptives except in the context of failure 
rates and have never been proven effective.

"Not only do virginity pledges not work to keep our young people safe, they 
are causing harm by undermining condom use, contraception and medical 
treatment," says Smith. "Enough is enough. It is time for lawmakers to stop 
pushing their ideological agenda at the expense of young people and fund 
comprehensive and medically accurate sexuality education programs that 
work," Smith urges.

I'll ask my bro Maximil if he still has any pictures -- if you mean the party

It was rad.

Subject: [sfraves] Thank you from Evil Breaks!

i just wanted to send a warm thanks to everyone who showed up to help
celebrate our Evil Breaks one year!  i saw LOTS of SFR folks at the
party and i wanted to let you know your presence was very much
appreciated.  i know the ticket price wasn't cheap (our most expensive
for a club event) and your support was not overlooked.

thank you to everyone who helped set up, clean up and who contributed
to this event.  a big shout out to our special guests General Midi and
Roxiller for dropping the ill sickness!  thank you to the dancers. 
thank you for your smiles and cheers.  thank you all for being a part
of this.

and for those that witnessed it, you know that our good friend Jauncy
totally outdid himself with the enormously epic ice sculpture!  it
contributed something special for the event and will not soon be
forgotten!  it was so dope lol omg!  <- osby impersonation

it's been a fantastic rollercoaster of a year for Evil Breaks! though
i think i'm the only crew member on the SFR list, i want to let all of
you know that your support and participation in our events has meant
the world to us.  we will continue our efforts to keep the vibe
positive and kickin, the dancefloor packed, the faces smiling, asses
shaking and the beats booming.

to our one year anniversary and all the years to come.  i can't wait
to see what the future has in store.  ;)

Figured I'd share, since I finally got the time to upload them. I
haven't triaged them out yet, so I apologize for blurry, and crappy
pictures.

What no bathroom shots?  How are we going tell if it
was good party if we can't see what's happening in the

Please correct this deficiency in the future.

Nah, only used the bathroom twice or so, so I didn't really think about it.
However, in the future, I'll make sure to get tons of bathroom shots
for you perverts :)

Do you want to live on Yerba Buena Island? 

Commutes are easy as we hop onto the Bay Bridge in the middle with no
congestion or tolls. Driving to downtown SF is less than 10 minutes
and 15 mins to Berkeley or Oakland. MUNI stops at the end of the block
every 20 minutes to the Transbay Bus Terminal in SF, 24 hours a day.

Our unit is in the former Coast Guard Base in the middle of The Bay -
access to Oakland or SF by Bay Bridge. The island itself is a unique
and wonderful place to live. There's a police and fire station, making
it very safe. There's a store where basic supplies can be bought and
videos can be rented. There are public footpaths around the island
excellent for jogging/cycling, rollerblading, tennis courts,
basketball courts, soccer fields, a PRIVATE HIDDEN BEACH only a few
hundred feet away! and small Marina on Treasure Island. Breathtaking
views of SF, Alcatraz, Marin, Vallejo, Berkeley hills, Oakland,
Alameda, The Golden Gate Bridge, Bay Bridge, and San Rafael Bridge.


About our home 

Our home is three bedrooms, with a small garden area, free parking. It

new 53" HD television; Kitchen thats fully equipped with plenty of
cupboard space, microwave, dishwasher, garbage disposal, toaster oven,
gas range and oven, linoleum floor. Washing Machine / Dryer in the
house

House is mostly furnished with spare space for your stuff. We have
plenty of room and are also planning on getting some new furniture
depending on what you may have. The bedroom is not furnished Room is
wired for separate phone, cable, DSL. It has a closet in the room as
well as one right outside the door in the hallway. Nice new beige
berber carpeting. We do not have a house phone as we both have
cellphones but there is a line in your room if you would like to
activate it.


Available April 1st - $750 month 
First and Last month + 500 Security Deposit = $2000 total move in cost 

This includes ALL UTILITIES: water, electricity, gas, sewer, garbage,

You: any age, sex, orientation, nationality welcome. Must be a DRAMA
FREE, clean, stable, professional person with a good stable job
wanting to move in by November 1st. We all pitch in on household
shopping such as toiletpaper, lightbulbs, laundry detergent, etc and
generally buy most of our own food but dont mind sharing everything as
long as its kept equal as far as purchases vs consumption.

There are currently two people living in the condo one in each of the
other bedrooms. We're both males in our mid 20's. We're both sane and
responsible, and easy to get along with. We have busy work and social
lives that keep us out and about most of the time but we do enjoy
spending some time hanging out at home. We occasionally have small
dinner gatherings here or friends over to watch a movie. One of us
works full time for a home audio/video install company, the other is a
bay area event/marketing director. We're looking for anyone that can
pay the rent on time, can help out in keeping the place clean from
time to time and just basically someone that we can get along with
enough to like living where we do. This is a one in a million location
that everyone loves. Once you see the island and the ultimate central
location, beauty, and amenities you will fall in love and never want
to move anywhere else!

Please reply with a little about yourself such as your job, your
average day/week routine, any furniture you have. Need proof of
employment and roomate references

Any Q's please feel free to email for the A's.

Subject: [sfraves] NRR :: greetings.from.berlin

Actually I just got out of Berlin and now I'm 2.5 hours north of there
in a lovely city called Hildesheim. Berlin was a blast. I even managed
to find an underground party that was held in an unmarked room under
the underground's tracks. We're talking old skool rave style where
you're walking down some shit hole alley and you see graffitti
everywhere including all over a door. Doesn't look like where you
should be, but yet - you open that door and suddenly you're greeted to
a tiny 2 room space with people smashed in there. It was all live
electroclash PA. Let's just say the live electroclash group in SF that
thinks they're edgey and cool - well, they'd be sent home crying after
what I saw. Pure raw energy and talent on stage that night. They even
had intermission acts with reenactments of that show Tutti Frutti
here. Then they started throwing fruit and later during a song
dedicated to a maxi-pad brand called smirk they started tossing
maxipads into the crowd. Tit's hanging out, electrical tape and bad
makeup with a one guy having hair like flock of seagulls really made
the night just pure fun. I need to find their *everyone is a dj*
track. You would all love it. No really LOVE IT. The crowd was
awesome, the beer was cheap (=E2=82=AC2) and it was only =E2=82=AC5 to get =
in. Felt
like home to me.

We didn't leave until 7:30am or something. People stayed until the end
too which seems to be rare these days at most parties. I didn't do
much site seeing, but I walked around berlin for hours and hours just
trying to get lost and find spots that I wouldn't if I had been
hitting up landmarks. If any of you ever decide to go make sure you
stay at The Circus hostel. So nice. So cheap. =E2=82=AC18/night and lockers
are free. You're across from the underground station at
Rosenthaler-Platz which makes getting around a breeze.  I can't get
enough D=C3=B6ner here. Turkish kabaab stuff.  I ate way too many of them.
There's a lot more to what I did but I'm lacking the energy to keep
typing more. Basically - went to Sage (club) and Space from Ibiza was
hosting. Trance. Ick. Not a bad club, but definitely a summer venue
because of the outdoor pool and open roof capability. Didn't hit up
Tresor. It closes in 2 weeks. Oh well...

I'll have pictures up and video too soon. For now I'm going back to
bed and getting myself better. Stupid being sick shit pisses me off.
Too much partying I guess...

That saying's not all that plurry..  Unity includes all people, mean or
not, yes?

..and perhaps, in unity, they can learn to Respect others in the name
of Love and Peace.

I agree, that saying is not all that plurry, but even the pluriest of 
people come across mean people some days.. What I shall say is that even 
the mean people I know, I love. I can't expect them to be unified in 
love though :) I only can extend a greater element of 
compassion for them, love them peacefully, be unified in the 
element of love I have for all, and be respectful towards 
everyone :)

I'm leaving the comfort of my WoW addiction and contract dev work to drop 
my installment of HuggerMugger at Lit tonight...

DJs:
Shazbot - the tech/on regular with the irregular grooves
AndyW - endurance setathon covering at least 4 genres and twice as many drinks

Lit - 6th and Mission SF Free all night long

Come out and say howdy... I haven't seen well... anybody in weeks.  :P

Subject: [sfraves] SFRaves Planners Dinner

  In order to kick off the event planning SFRaves is hosting a dinner 
(location TBD) to celebrate our presence on this planet as a Free Resource 
to the community, as well to appreciate the SFRaves community presence in 
our lives. This dinner is to be a catalyst in planning the SFRaves 13 Year 
Annniversary Party! Please join us and realize our dreams, an event to 
celebrate our history and contribution to the local scene.

We will be meeting to discuss:

*Venue
*Sound and lighting
*DJ Lineup
*Decorations
*Permitting
*Security
*Flyers, Promotions
*Shifts
*Badges
*Structure
*Themes
*Further Agenda TBD based on SFRaves Planners input

The SFRaves-planners / SFRaves 13 Year Anniversary Dinner is tentatively 
set for date/time to be determined by SFRaves Planners feedback and input. 
This will most likely occur in the coming 2-3 weeks, so please give your 
feedback now and we'll get the reservations cracking. The Location is to 
be determined per the feedback of the list.

Ideas: For possible meeting times and dates:

Dates: Sunday April 3, 2005 @ 8pm, Monday April 4th @ 8pm
Location: Restaurant of our choice, or someone's place who is willing to 
host.

Cost: Can be free if we do a potluck, depends on who can come, where we 
meet and what the timeframe is. (Hopefully it will be low-cost due to 
everyone's limited budget)

Location: TBD

Subject: [sfraves] smack.you.upside.the.head.with.my.plur.stick

wtf is up with this recent plur revival I'm seeing on sfr?? is there a
sudden rush to rekindle days of old because there isn't much happening
now? plur was a stupid and petty acronym to begin with and it was best
left to fade from existence. anyone that's still having to use that
term is behind the times and is living in the past. fuck your plur
nonsense. plur is nothing more than some bullshit acronym for stupid
etards that need some term to express the e'd out joy they feel. I've
got your plur right here. It's about 3ft long and made of wood. All
the better to knock some sense into you. Deal with reality and not a
fantasy land comprised of weak minded acronyms folks...

fuck.u+you're.plur

Why don't you tell us how you really feel about it?

Subject: [sfraves] NRR - Anyone been to Costa Rica?




Has anybody been to Costa Rica? The wife and I are going there for 8 days in
the beginning of June and are looking for any suggestions on what to see,
where to stay, etc. We definitely want to check out the Arienal volcano and
beaches on the Pacific coast but don't want to rely too much on travel
guides. 

So if anybody has any suggestions please let me know!


Thanks

Could you send me the original flyer/BSP (or whatever it's called) for

You can keep tabs on the Sunset parties through the Pacific Sound events
page (which unfortunately appears to be out of whack at the moment):

ahh.... Costa Rica!

i'm planning a road trip to Costa Rica for next year.  you heard right, 
ROAD TRIP. it's a little insane, but how often do you get to do 
something like that?  we're going to have a veggie oil powered 1987 MCI 
motor coach for the trip.

it will take about a month to drive there.  our final destination is 
Punta Mona, a permaculture community on the caribbean coast.  
www.puntamona.org.  i'd like to hang out there for a few weeks before 
we start heading back north.

i'd like to get an idea of what else is worth seeing in C.R. so we can 
plan our trip accordingly.

anyone wanna come with us?  :-)

Teen's love of 'Slow Ride' inspires quest

Song replaced bell used to signal lunch

By Chris Moran

UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITERMarch 19, 2005 CHULA VISTA - A song can champion a
cause, but in the case of a clever and persistent high school senior, the
song is  the cause.

Daniel Dorman's tale begins with a ring and ends with an overpowering
anthem. He used Gandhi-inspired tactics to confirm the power of one person
to change the world - or at least high school lunch period. And, as Daniel
explains, "Every story sounds better with the name 'Foghat' in it." The ring
is, by Daniel's reckoning, an "E-sharp" bell that dismisses fifth period and
calls Bonita Vista High School students to lunch. It annoys Daniel, and once
he decided it needed to be replaced, there was only one worthy substitute:
"Slow Ride," the classic rock staple by 70s rockers Foghat. So Daniel went
to Principal Ramon Leyba and asked: How about playing "Slow Ride" in place
of the lunch bell? Leyba was amused, and told Daniel that he'd look into it.
Really, though, Leyba thought that was the end of it. But Daniel was just
getting started.

"Gandhi beat the British Empire by not eating," Daniel said, so getting his
school to broadcast "Slow Ride" was surely attainable. Also, the 17-year-old
said, "I have a lot of free time." He put it to use with a three-page letter
that eloquently made the case for "Slow Ride." He launched a petition drive
for Proposition Slow Ride and gathered 300 signatures. He secured the band's
endorsement. Foghat sent him what drummer Roger Earl calls "Fogstuff" - CDs,
autographed photos and the like - and wished him well. Daniel didn't get any
follow-up from Leyba after the meeting, so he and his friends devised
messages in their Web design class to be delivered to Leyba daily. The first
featured a photo of Daniel and an ultimatum that the principal had 10 days
to play Foghat. If Leyba didn't play "Slow Ride," Daniel would go on a
hunger strike. It was followed the next day with a photo of Daniel holding
up nine fingers. When the countdown reached six days, Leyba called him in.
Leyba agreed to play it, but just once. He said it wasn't possible to wire
the song into the school's bell system, and he would not waste staff time
playing "Slow Ride" each day. It was a high point for a boy who had almost
dropped out of school before he got to high school. Daniel and his mom say
the trouble started when he made a threat against a teacher in a moment of
frustration. It wasn't a serious threat, but in the wake of the Santana High
School shootings that year, administrators didn't take any chances. Daniel
was transferred to Fifth Avenue Academy, a Chula Vista school that
specializes in tough cases. He thrived there for two years and then entered
Bonita Vista High in 11th grade. Daniel previously distinguished himself at
Bonita Vista High by having an apprentice - a student who followed him
everywhere, addressed him as "The Daniel," performed menial tasks for him
and dressed like him. That meant wearing a derby hat and carrying a pocket
watch. Daniel had 10 applicants for a second apprentice. They submitted
risumis providing references, listing favorite television shows and
answering questions such as, "If Daniel were to decide to miss school to
watch 'Montel,' would the apprentice write down a short synopsis of what
Daniel missed that day at school?" Yesterday at 12:36 p.m., the music
played, and Daniel's story had a triumphant ending. And it has an epilogue.
Foghat's Earl called Daniel last weekend. The drummer thought back to his
high school days and wondered what would have happened back if he had asked
his principal to play Jerry Lee Lewis' "Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On." "He
probably would have kicked me out," Earl said, but this Leyba "seems like a
reasonable fellow." So when the band plays at Sycuan Casino this summer,
Daniel and three of his buddies will be there as guests of the band. Earl
said Leyba's invited, too.

spirit of the finest west coast dance club of the 70's and 80's?

serving up a helping of delicious, original, authentic underground music " 
la Troc", from the height of the disco era.

In the mix that Jerry brings you, will be an appetizer of a smooth flavored 
uplifting wind up. You'll sink your teeth into the entre, rich and spicy 
in it's intensity. Then stay for dessert, and enjoy the creamy sweetness of 
an early morning wind down.

As a complement to this musical feast, drink in the ambience of color and 
mood created by Bob Bear, "Arc Lamp Diva" Miss Carla and Bobby Moske, it's 
light and sparkling!

You can enjoy this delectable indulgence at its very point of origin, the 
Glas Kat, formerly known as the Trocadero Transfer, 520 Fourth Street San 
Francisco.

there read our "Brief History of the Scene" and some of the new notes on 
the on line guest book. Even if you have already signed in, feel free to

Anarchist Bookfair this Saturday.  We're cleaning out
our collection, and have a wide variety of stuff,

troublemaker is the author and editor of numerous
books and audio CDs. His latest work is On The Justice

infamous dyke-punk band Tribe 8, has been performing
throughout the U.S., Canada, and Europe for over a
decade. She currently teaches at the Harvey Milk

novel, Godspeed, is not your average drug redemption
story, but its obviously based on her own experiences
as an addict in past years, and thats what makes it
so compelling and real.

anarcho-electro/hip-hoppers put out political

(415) 431-8355 

(Subversive Soundz is a project rooted in electronic
dance music and radical politics.  We try to merge the
two as much as possible, bringing politics and dance
cultures together in an unholy alliance to spread joy,
liberation, solidarity, and subversion.  We've done
actions such as helping organize and bringing sound
systems to Reclaim the Streets actions; brought
literature and propaganda to club/dance music events;
organized Unchained Reaction!, an elektronik,
anti-nuclear resist.dance party/convergence at the
gates of the Nevada Test Site as part of a larger
peace encampment; organized the outside dance area at
the annual Anarchist Cafe; and organized numerous
benefits to support efforts such as Legal Action to
Stop the War, Bay Area Indymedia, the DIY Skillshare,
and the Autonomous Mutant Festival.   Our parties are
DIY, all ages, sliding scale, diverse musically,
combine art, magick, and politix, and are done out of
love, and to build bridges between ideas and people. 

For more info, email subversivesoundz@yahoo.com. )

Possessing a side-arm doesn't necessarily mean one will have the will
to use it in a bad situation, and if you feel you might fall into that
category, it might be to your further detriment to carry a piece,
since it can be turned against you

My girl's brother just went down to C.R. and loved it.

Also, it seems that it's one the Ex-Pat destination's of choice these
days, which makes sense, given the pounding the US Dollar is taking in
Western Europe.

Just stepping off the plane in Europa means that your precious dollar,
between the exchange rate & transaction fees loses 40% of its 'value'
right off the top.

That's some haircut.

I'm looking at C.R. as well as Belize as a place to go if shit gets
much heavier than it already is.

I'm thinking Belize because it's kind of undeveloped at this point and
the natives all speak English, and if the shit really does hit the fan
I don't believe anywhere in the 1st Werld, to include Europe, Canada
and the USA USA USA will be any place a person with any sense of
self-preservation will want to be.

New Attack on Raves and Live Music

Defend Your Right to Dance!

Dear Henry,

Last year our supporters helped raise attention to an outrageous abuse of 
power in Racine, Wisconsin, where hundreds of music fans were ticketed for 
being in a crowded nightclub where a few people used drugs. Those ticketed 
had no drugs on them. The police didn't even have any evidence that they 
had ever used drugs. Their only "crime" was dancing at a nightclub where 
other people who used drugs were arrested.  Although only three drug 
arrests were made, police issued citations to 445 innocent attendees with a 
penalty of $968 each for being "patrons of a disorderly house." Thanks to a 
public outcry from people like you, work by the Drug Policy Alliance, and 
an ACLU lawsuit, the citations were ultimately dismissed.

Now, it has happened again; this time in Flint, Michigan. On Saturday the 
local police raided a popular nightclub, Club What's Next, and ticketed 
music fans who were attending a dance night known as "Getting Lucky" (the 
DJs included Halluci-Nate, Sparkimus Prime, White Rabbit, Captain Cheddar 
and California's Dj Primo.) While some people were arrested for possessing 
or selling illegal drugs, most people were ticketed for "frequenting a drug 
establishment," a misdemeanor offense.

<http://actioncenter.drugpolicy.org/ctt.asp?u=488&l=84691>Speak out against 
this abuse of power now.

That's right. In Flint, Michigan (and many other cities) if you go out 
dancing on a Saturday night and the police happen to arrest other people at 
the club for drugs, you could be charged with a drug crime even though you 
had nothing to do with drugs. These innocent party-goers now face up to 90 
days in jail and a $500 fine. They also face a criminal record with all the 
legal and social barriers that brings. Several people at the club that 
night told us club-goers were also subjected to strip searches, including 
full cavity searches  even though they had nothing to do with drugs. 
Imagine the police walking into your favorite bar or nightclub and making 
you submit to a strip search for no reason! Imagine spending 90 days in 
jail or paying a $500 fine for dancing!

The raid on Club What's Next was conducted by Flint's Special Operations 
and Crime Area Target Team units, along with the Flint Area Narcotics Group 
and the Genesee County Sheriff's Posse. We're looking into whether or not 
federal Byrne grant money helped finance the raids. (On a side note, any 
law enforcement agency that has the word "posse" in it should be suspect).

You can send a message that this type of action is unacceptable by doing 
two things:

1)      <http://actioncenter.drugpolicy.org/ctt.asp?u=488&l=84691>Contact 
the Flint City Council and Mayor and let them know how appalled you are 
that the city mistreats music fans and allows the police to punish people 
for the crimes of others.

2)      Forward this alert to your e-mail lists and to friends and family. 
We need to flood the Flint political establishment with faxes and emails.

The Drug Policy Alliance would like to give a special thanks to Will 
Patterson at the Electronic Music Defense Fund (EM:DEF) for alerting us to 
this scandal. He found out about the incident because one of the club-goers 
filed an incident report on EM:DEF's web site. If your rights are ever 
violated by the police at a music event, you can 
<http://actioncenter.drugpolicy.org/ctt.asp?u=488&l=84684>file a similar 
report there. Copies of incident reports go to EM:DEF, the ACLU, and the 
Drug Policy Alliance.

It makes me sick. If the Dems had even half the fuct

would be hung in the streets.

I am sick of these assholes (neo-cons).

It would be funny to see you wear a tshirt called Ravers Suck, holding=20
some PLUR LUBE, ready to lube it up, while simultaneously I wear my=20
anti-plur shirt: "Fuck you you fucking fuck" :)

Cheers to your jaded raver vibe....

PLUR is my way of life, nothing wrong with peace, love unity or=20
respect.
Remember to Fuck the DJ and that DJS don't share needles.

I'm glad I know what PLUR to me means without having to apply some=20
stupid label to everyone's else's meaning (or assume I know what it means=
=20
to them) hehe... as far as the revival goes, there's no use of E or=20
whatever to feel that vibe. It's all in the music, and I feel the love...

I am glad I'm not jaded after 17 years, more power to ya if love to=20
hate :)

Rave On, No Rest for the Wicked, Rave til Dawn, Plur and happy to=20
remember the then and live in the now,
:)

I'd say sunday, I got classes all day on Monday so I wouldnt be able to make it. Hmmmmm maybe we can all eat at Mc Donalds, they got a nice $1 selection........... Have a meeting spot half way between SF and SJ? Going to Sf would kill my tank but hey if everythings going for sf im down to.

Karina <karina@hyperreal.org> wrote:In order to kick off the event planning SFRaves is hosting a dinner 
(location TBD) to celebrate our presence on this planet as a Free Resource 
to the community, as well to appreciate the SFRaves community presence in 
our lives. This dinner is to be a catalyst in planning the SFRaves 13 Year 
Annniversary Party! Please join us and realize our dreams, an event to 
celebrate our history and contribution to the local scene.

We will be meeting to discuss:

*Venue
*Sound and lighting
*DJ Lineup
*Decorations
*Permitting
*Security
*Flyers, Promotions
*Shifts
*Badges
*Structure
*Themes
*Further Agenda TBD based on SFRaves Planners input

The SFRaves-planners / SFRaves 13 Year Anniversary Dinner is tentatively 
set for date/time to be determined by SFRaves Planners feedback and input. 
This will most likely occur in the coming 2-3 weeks, so please give your 
feedback now and we'll get the reservations cracking. The Location is to 
be determined per the feedback of the list.

Ideas: For possible meeting times and dates:

Dates: Sunday April 3, 2005 @ 8pm, Monday April 4th @ 8pm
Location: Restaurant of our choice, or someone's place who is willing to 
host.

Cost: Can be free if we do a potluck, depends on who can come, where we 
meet and what the timeframe is. (Hopefully it will be low-cost due to 
everyone's limited budget)

Location: TBD

Let's see here. . . 
 
Racine, Wisconsin: 445 peepz x $968 per citation (not to mention drug charges) = $430,760.00 (not to mention drug charges) to Racine's finest.
 
San Francisco, CA: 445 peepz x $430,760.00 (not to mention drug charges) = size of the lawsuit if the police ever tried to pull something that facist out here. (Let's hope)

New Attack on Raves and Live Music

Defend Your Right to Dance!

Dear Henry,

Last year our supporters helped raise attention to an outrageous abuse of 
power in Racine, Wisconsin, where hundreds of music fans were ticketed for 
being in a crowded nightclub where a few people used drugs. Those ticketed 
had no drugs on them. The police didn't even have any evidence that they 
had ever used drugs. Their only "crime" was dancing at a nightclub where 
other people who used drugs were arrested. Although only three drug 
arrests were made, police issued citations to 445 innocent attendees with a 
penalty of $968 each for being "patrons of a disorderly house." Thanks to a 
public outcry from people like you, work by the Drug Policy Alliance, and 
an ACLU lawsuit, the citations were ultimately dismissed.

Now, it has happened again; this time in Flint, Michigan. On Saturday the 
local police raided a popular nightclub, Club What's Next, and ticketed 
music fans who were attending a dance night known as "Getting Lucky" (the 
DJs included Halluci-Nate, Sparkimus Prime, White Rabbit, Captain Cheddar 
and California's Dj Primo.) While some people were arrested for possessing 
or selling illegal drugs, most people were ticketed for "frequenting a drug 
establishment," a misdemeanor offense.

Speak out against 
this abuse of power now.

That's right. In Flint, Michigan (and many other cities) if you go out 
dancing on a Saturday night and the police happen to arrest other people at 
the club for drugs, you could be charged with a drug crime even though you 
had nothing to do with drugs. These innocent party-goers now face up to 90 
days in jail and a $500 fine. They also face a criminal record with all the 
legal and social barriers that brings. Several people at the club that 
night told us club-goers were also subjected to strip searches, including 
full cavity searches  even though they had nothing to do with drugs. 
Imagine the police walking into your favorite bar or nightclub and making 
you submit to a strip search for no reason! Imagine spending 90 days in 
jail or paying a $500 fine for dancing!

The raid on Club What's Next was conducted by Flint's Special Operations 
and Crime Area Target Team units, along with the Flint Area Narcotics Group 
and the Genesee County Sheriff's Posse. We're looking into whether or not 
federal Byrne grant money helped finance the raids. (On a side note, any 
law enforcement agency that has the word "posse" in it should be suspect).

You can send a message that this type of action is unacceptable by doing 
two things:

1) Contact 
the Flint City Council and Mayor and let them know how appalled you are 
that the city mistreats music fans and allows the police to punish people 
for the crimes of others.

2) Forward this alert to your e-mail lists and to friends and family. 
We need to flood the Flint political establishment with faxes and emails.

The Drug Policy Alliance would like to give a special thanks to Will 
Patterson at the Electronic Music Defense Fund (EM:DEF) for alerting us to 
this scandal. He found out about the incident because one of the club-goers 
filed an incident report on EM:DEF's web site. If your rights are ever 
violated by the police at a music event, you can 
file a similar 
report there. Copies of incident reports go to EM:DEF, the ACLU, and the 
Drug Policy Alliance.

Lately my outings have gone from SF to LA.. not physically but in spirit.  I
have been fortunate enough to befriend Patrico and Ooah.. two of LA's
hottest and most promising DJ's.. with mad style and even more serious
bookings.   If anyone questions their contributions to the scene.. they need
only look at how well they are doing both personally and musically.. cuz the
boyz got style, hot ladies, and sic events to be had.

Anyway.. this post is to let you know about a seriously Richter event or two

congratulations. i assume you've already accomplished the old "shit, i played the wrong side of the record" and "awsome, my arm just pushed the needle across the record" tricks.

> A similar strategy might be wise for others who ate the contaminated food,

See.  This is why you should pace your drinking when you gotta play.

I'm no one to talk though.  My worst is trying to play a cover that's
really good and playing the boot that is really cheesy on the other
side.  Wow!  How do you explain that you don't like the song that your
playing?

Perhaps then, in actuality  you took a "step down" the DJ Ladder?  j/k  No 
worries, it's happened to the best of us. Now that you've been initiated, go

Perhaps then, in actuality you took a "step down" the DJ Ladder? j/k No 
worries, it's happened to the best of us. Now that you've been initiated, go 
rock the dance floor :)

my favorite digital mistake is assigning the new song to the deck currently playing--OUCH 
talk about an abrupt mix
 
another great one is failing to heed the 45 on a drum&bass record and playing it at 33 after transitioning from a slower record. Trying to speed it up by hitting 45 either during a beatless breakdown or on 1 beat isn't fun. that's a pretty silly error that one has to be fairly drunk not to catch while cueing...although D&B at 33 can sometime sound like some nicely chilled nu-skool....
 
HA! fun thread this is

IMO, most D&B records sound better at 33 anyway. :P

are you talking about giving the "evil eye" to a dancer to pretend that a trainwreck was caused by their bumping the decks?

you know, i think i did this once before at a party.  it's so much 
worse than trainwrecking.  but you know, i think the whole house music 
dj dance thing wouldn't be so special and exciting if you didn't have 
some of the possibilities of bad things like trainwrecking or turning 
the wrong record player off ... one dj once told me he likes making it 
almost wreck to create tension ... and another dj once told me it's 
good to always feel a little tension.

if you can guess who these people are, i'll give you a free hug next 
time i see you.  and i'll give you a hint.  the first one is english, 
and the second one is american.

some of the possibilities of bad things like trainwrecking or turning 
the wrong record player off ... one dj once told me he likes making it 
almost wreck to create tension ... and another dj once told me it's 
good to always feel a little tension.

if you can guess who these people are, i'll give you a free hug next 
time i see you. and i'll give you a hint. the first one is english, 
and the second one is american.

Born in Manchester, raised in London. Sounds pretty English to me. Guessed Dan because you mentioned "the whole house music dj dance thing." Pretty good guesses I thought.
 
Pucker up Osby, Sounds like we're in for quite the introduction!

Jesus ryan, Grow up and let people be.
Quit with this whole "I'm bad-assed, and too hardcore for you" elitist
attitude. I mean, I Love you like a brother and all, but enough's
enough.

Just because you don't believe in plur (which is a pretty stupid
acronym which has been taken out of context by candy kids worldwide),
doesn't mean that you shouldn't still show a little fucking respect
for others.

Cmon bro, Golden rule.

Subject: [sfraves] DJ Emile?

Ever heard of this guy? Supposedly he did a stint out in san francisco
some time between 1999 and 2001. Was wondering if any of you have
heard of him, or perhaps worked with him in the past.

>From what I've read of the cat, he's a tool, but wanted to know
whether or not any of ya'll know of him.

Here's some of his finer work:

you know -- i probably won't be too affected by the finger in the 
Wendy's chili -- just don't let it happen again.

but when it comes to fast food, i'm sorry ... hands down jack in the 
box wins.  unfortunately they don't have jack in the box in virginia.  
too bad, because i was getting addicted to those bruschetta chicken 
sandwiches.

i do have to say though, on the east coast sonic rawks!  anyone ever 
eaten there?

it's some neotech hippy bullshit created by those that ate a few too
many pills one night. Or for others whatever they could cram down
their throats to get high and *feel the love* I will always trash on
those that bust out plur. It's that simple. Did you come to SF and
suddenly have your heart melted again or what yo? I know SF makes you
soft but shit...

you kids and your sensitive pussies about your happy little plur
bullshit. actually all of you that are so up on your plur I want you
to constantly say it to people from here on out at clubs and parties
and tell me what reaction you get. you're going to look like a bunch
of norcal hippy bitches with a few too many burned out neurons. =3D)

nice attempt at downplaying things. shall I remove the filter on my
mouth again? This time around you can't send your stupid little net
kiddy bitches to try and call my office and try to get me in trouble
because I don't work for anyone but myself. I know you remember
*vividly* what I said to you last time. You think people support you
here. I guess it's good to have false hopes rather than no hope. =)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] DJ Emile?

I've heard of him but not heard him. I saw virtually nada about him
during the short time I was in Phoenix but I heard of him years before
then because he was connected to the comic artist Jim Mahfood, who I
believe is now located in LA. And obviously to Z-Trip and Radar
(Bombshelter DJs). Odd that he won best rave dj or whatever according
to that article because Z-Trip and Radar are turntablists, so I always
assumed Bombshelter was a turntablist crew. Beyond that all I know
about him is what Jim Mahfood has written and drawn in his comics,
none of which is flattering, but all of which is entertaining.
(Apparently he was dating a stripper and he complained that he
couldn't jerk off any more because none of the porno chicks were as
hot as his girlfriend.)

Mahfood is also associated with hip-hop more than the rave scene,
although he is kinda well-known for his "anti-rave comic" which got
forwarded everywhere a few years back. It was the one with the ravers
complaining and bitching and whining and complaining about drama and
generally being hypocrites, saying things like "rave music isn't
pre-programmed beats for white people who can't dance! it isn't!" and
"I'm so disillusioned I'm going to throw a brick through the window of
Swell!" and "raves are for everybody! everybody who can afford $5
bottles of water, $20 tickets, and $200 pants!"

Mahfood is also, by the way, an awesome artist, who sent me comics for
free, and he has art for sale, right here:

http://www.40ozcomics.com/new/artforsale.html

And you should buy some. I'm gonna.

Anyway, basically all I know about Emile is that he was friends with
Mahfood and he sounded totally obnoxious. But in a good way. :-)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] smack.you.upside.the.head.with.my.plur.stick

You should know by now I'm the last person you should be giving shit
to when it comes to that kinda stuff. I know you know better than to
assume that I'm some pussy-whipped raver who did too many drugs one
night.

I'm just telling you to grow up  and quit sounding like a fucking retard.

Jesus christ dude, cmon.

As for going soft, soft is most definitely not the word I'd use to
describe what going back to SF did for me. Moreso a spiritual release
than anything. Being stuck in the middle of the desert for 2 years
with no break has a tendency to beat the life out of you.

While you're off seeing the world, and taking an opportunity I will
not have for many years to explore. I've done nothing to attack you,
nor do I think I deserve to be spoken to in such a manner as you
currently are. I find it extremely rude and disheartening, and most
definitely don't appreciate it. Your actions dictate how others
perceive you, and right now, you're most definitely being perceived by
others as a real dick.

Also, one more thing: since you're talking so much about how you're
having so much fun travelling, and want to go back to new york after
you come back, why are you still on here, and for that matter, why are
you flaming people? You're basically starting the only drama I've seen
since re-joining the list a month ago. That's all I've gotta say, man.

I hope you enjoy seeing the world.

Golden rule, man. You get what you give.

Ryan,

Sometimes you should take a nice little chill pill / liquor / whatever 
floats your boat -

called
shut.the.fuck.up

and leave.me.the.fuck.outta.this

Cause 
I.do.not.care.about.your.ignorance.and.pathetic.attempts.to.troll.me

Have a beautiful day, and just.for.the.record.

My last response had nothing to do with you. If you notice... I didn't 
address it to you, it was a reply to Michael.

As far as what you think you know, don't believe everything you think.

One day, you might wake up from your own reality and realize,
Your attempts to libel and slanderize me are getting *really old*

Not to mention, lame as a sitting duck.
Have a beautiful day. Believe whatever you want, it doesn't mean you 
are right.

Good day sir.

Karina

You should know by now I'm the last person you should be giving shit
to when it comes to that kinda stuff. I know you know better than to
assume that I'm some pussy-whipped raver who did too many drugs one
night.

I'm just telling you to grow up  and quit sounding like a fucking retard.

Jesus christ dude, cmon.

As for going soft, soft is most definitely not the word I'd use to
describe what going back to SF did for me. Moreso a spiritual release
than anything. Being stuck in the middle of the desert for 2 years
with no break has a tendency to beat the life out of you.

While you're off seeing the world, and taking an opportunity I will
not have for many years to explore. I've done nothing to attack you,
nor do I think I deserve to be spoken to in such a manner as you
currently are. I find it extremely rude and disheartening, and most
definitely don't appreciate it. Your actions dictate how others
perceive you, and right now, you're most definitely being perceived by
others as a real dick.

Also, one more thing: since you're talking so much about how you're
having so much fun travelling, and want to go back to new york after
you come back, why are you still on here, and for that matter, why are
you flaming people? You're basically starting the only drama I've seen
since re-joining the list a month ago. That's all I've gotta say, man.

I hope you enjoy seeing the world.

Golden rule, man. You get what you give.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] smack.you.upside.the.head.with.my.plur.stick

Here here now, Hell, If I was in Berlin, I sure as hell wouldn't be 
starting flame war threads on SFRaves... but then again, I'm not you, and 
you are not me, and you don't know me.

If I was in Berlin,  I'd be out enjoying the scenery.

You know Ryan, you've got *Way* too much time on  your hands for a world 
traveler, blah blah blah, and for someone who wanted to leave the SF Bay 
area, cause you hate it so much,  you sure put a lot of energy blowing 
smoke out of your ass... and flaming people and places around here like 
you are are all high and mighty.

As far as resources, whatever you want to believe, there's always a flip 
side to the coin...You seem to be stuck on the part that never lets go, 
of the idea that what you think you know is the complete truth. (Say, 
let's take my life and what really has been going on in it - you are not 
my friend - and at the rate at which you are chastising me - never 
will be.

As far as your beliefs are concerned, they don't compute. Your attempts to 
belittle me are so blase and unoriginal, not to mention, disrespectful and 
ignorant of my life at hand, at present, etc.

Hence, whatever you believe, just might not not compute....Regardless, 
this thread is starting to sound like it came from a bunghole...as far as 
your threats are concerned... Have a beautiful life, I'm not interested in 
what you have to say... never really was to begin with when you turned 
from someone with something intelligent to say to someone who thinks he 
knows it all. You definitely do not know me, and whatever you have to say 
is obviously tainted with your self-deprecating hate and repeated attempts 
to spread b$. Perhaps karma will come back to bite you in the ass some 
day.... be well and cheerios!

Spread love, fuck hate in the ass with a strap on...

<3 Karina

Subject: Re: [sfraves] smack.you.upside.the.head.with.my.plur.stick

I'm not in Berlin you tard. And while I was in berlin I was doing more
than you do in a year. But that's why you're still there doing your
same old shit (nothing) and I'm enjoying some downtime doing what I
love. Life is beautiful baby.

More fun - planners. HAHAHAHA. You were handed it to get you to shut
the fuck up already. We booted you out of it when you tried to add
yourself years ago. Ever since then you've desperately wanted to be a
part of it. Now you're finally being appeased just so you'll shut the
fuck up already. Too bad you lack follow through to get anything done.

How are those sleep problems that the doctors *couldn't figure out
what's wrong* going for ya? Did the meth monsters get ya yet?

Remember - the R is for rehab. =)

Oh and more fun for ya - see you can keep trying to spin things away
from you and towards me. You do a wonderfully bad job of it. You're a
source of entertainment as much as I am for so many here. I'm actually
still amazed you're allowed to be a hyperreal anything still. I
thought they were supposed to get rid of you a long time ago?

You can never win Karina for one good reason. You've gone nowhere in
life and doubtfully ever will. So if you want to talk sad - check
yourself and where you're at and look at where the rest of us are at.
Our lives don't consist of that pussy shit IRC crap and who's got ops
and bla bla bla.

Good luck babes!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] smack.you.upside.the.head.with.my.plur.stick

is it just me or have we returned to the flame wars of old?  i
remember these popping up quite frequently the first couple years i
was on here.  not so much anymore.  except back then i kinda enjoyed
them, mostly because i didn't know the people involved!

but now i do know you guys and to be honest, i'd kinda rather not hear
this on SFR.  sure, i could just press delete, but i wanted to ask you
guys if you could either cool it down or just take it offline.  are
your personal differences really worth the drama of sending it out to
hundreds and hundreds of people?

some advice:

ryan, enjoy your travels.  my time spent living in china was a
fantastic experience that i'll never regret.  soak it in.  stop
looking at things from the perspective of an american.  stop trying to
compare things to what you're used to.   just try to see things as
they are and in the context from which they came.  enjoy life as a
human being.  i know taking this trip was a good decision for you.

karina, let it go and continue doing the things that you feel
passionate about.  don't get too caught up in other people's
criticisms and don't feel like you have to defend yourself.  don't
fight drama with drama.  it's really not worth it.

and to everyone else....PLUR!  ;)

TAYO!

holy shit.

not that I've even left the house in months, not that I know a damn
thing about DJs, but, Tayo. yowl, and stuff.

but:
it's Baobinga, not Baofinga. I think Baofinga must be his James Bong
007 villain name. or something.

and it's Photek, not Photeck.

and I think it's Ben Chun not Benhcun.

anyway, Tayo, Tayo is awesome plus plus. that whole smoky dub mixing.

Oy Thanks for your insight. I agree on all levels. Twas'nt my drama to 
begin with, as far as I am concerned, I am passionate about everything 
including life itself. You echo the same sentiments I had regarding the 
rehash of something that was /dev/null for me years back. :)

Thanks for your support, I definitely concur with you - if I wanted 
drama, I'd go watch a play :)

Much love to you, SFRaves  and oh yeah, PLUR :)

Back to Taz....

Hey Ryan,

Just an FYI  / your comments are complete utter horseshit.

As far as I'm concerned, Kiss my ass and enjoy your travels, I'm done with 
your stupid fucking lies :) /dev/null you are....

You have no clue what I'm doing in my life, where I've been, or where I'm 
going...you have no clue where SFRaves Planners is going - and damn, we've 
come along way from *YOUR* prior drama on said list...

I am sure as hell on a wonderful path in life, and it's not the 
destination, but the path and journey I take - which has been much more 
colorful than you can even fathom.

I do not consume, inhale, snort, smoke or otherwise use methamphetamine, 
for the record, enjoy your special K :) I've never been to rehab. Are you 
projecting your woes?

As far as Hyperreal goes, I have the support of Terry and Brian, and have 
done quite a lot for 7 years of volunteer work - something I doubt you can 
say jack shit about - since you aren't staff and never were, I think you 
really aren't qualified to know what the hell you are talking about.

As far as IRC goes, again you have no clue. I'm not on IRC, haven't been 
in say fucking three plus years. You are so misinformed and so reaking 
lies / misinformation it is not even funny. You seriously have not let 
go of your personal attacks of me for years, if you have come so far in 
life, why don't you grow up and fucking move on?

I'm done with this thread, and you. Have a pleasant journey and may you be 
blessed with some happiness and better things to do in life than 
constantly comparing yourself to others, especially those you are truly 
ignorant of.

To the rest of the list, my apologies for this thread - Ryan hasn't 
dropped the attempt to be an asshole towards me for doing my job for as 
long as I've known of him on the list. My work and contribution speaks for 
itself. I wish the SFRaves community much love, and even to your antiplur, 
wish you well in life Ryan. Stop comparing yours to mine, we are not one 
and the same and never will be.

<3 Karina

We are a small, yet devoted group. Our public numbers have been kept 
small, but only because selfish women have been repressing them. Once 
you are discovered as a vagitarian, they will go to extents to make sure 
other women don't know of this.

Actually the Church is a really cool club, that has a lot of local DJs that 
play real fuckin music.  So the underground you are concerned with is not 
sponsered by vodka and cigarettes.  The scened in and around northern CO is 
actually pretty fuckin cool.

It's a tortured life, but for those willing to make the sacrifice the

chant with me the sacred hymn, brother-

oh vagina, we love thee;
0 calories and fat free;
the finest steak can not compete;
strict vagitarians are we.

I have to agree about The Church. It's a pretty rad joint. Is Synergy still 
open? Back in '96 or so I remember that was a hot afterhours joint.

I have had many a fun time at parties in CO - especially the Roofless Prod. 
parties. Those were hot.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Groove on

I am moving to SF on the 2nd of April and my friend and I would really like 
to go to the First Sunset Party, but alas I have no vehicle so if anyone can 
hook us up with a ride I would really appreciate it.

Thanks,
Justin

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

Call you up in the middle of the night
Like a firefly without a light
You were there like a slow torch burning
I was a key that could use a little turning

So tired that I couldn't even sleep
So many secrets I couldn't keep
Promised myself I wouldn't weep
One more promise I couldn't keep

It seems no one can help me now
I'm in too deep
There's no way out
This time I have really led myself astray

CHORUS
Runaway train never going back
Wrong way on a one way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here no there

Can you help me remember how to smile
Make it somehow all seem worthwhile
How on earth did I get so jaded
Life's mystery seems so faded

I can go where no one else can go
I know what no one else knows
Here I am just drownin' in the rain
With a ticket for a runaway train

Everything seems cut and dry
Day and night, earth and sky
Somehow I just don't believe it

CHORUS

Bought a ticket for a runaway train
Like a madman laughin' at the rain
Little out of touch, little insane
Just easier than dealing with the pain

Runaway train never comin' back
Runaway train tearin' up the track
Runaway train burnin' in my veins
Runaway but it always seems the same

The US is:  "...a nation of 200 million used-car salesmen with all the 
money we need to buy guns and no qualms about killing anybody else in the 
world who tries to make us uncomfortable."
-Hunter S. Thompson

"Friend, hope for the truth while you are alive.  Jump into experience 
while you are alive!  What you call "salvation" belongs to the time before 
death.  If you don't break your ropes while you are alive, do you think 
ghosts will do it after?"
-Kabir

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) Quote of the Day (Mon)

well ... like i said, this is going to depend on how reliable my internet
connection is.  today is a good day for that, so life is good!

i had a dream the other night that i was john connor from the terminator movies
and they sent yet another terminator back through time to kill me, and i got
away but the terminator like killed like 50,000 people in one shot, but in
doing so, it also burned itself out.  so go figure.

today's quote is one i found someone wrote on the white board in my workspace. 
have fun with it!

No, only certain Nomads do line in recording.  The 3 brands you want to
check out that have models with line-in recording are:

-Archos
-Nomad
-iRiver.

My friend just got an iRiver, its pretty hot. I have an Archos, and it
sounds good, but I have all sorts of problems with corrupt .mp3 files,
I would not recommend it.  Archos has this nice open-source alternative
software that I use, http://www.rockbox.org/, but it does not help
the .mp3 recording reliability much.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Seeking Bboys/Bgirls/Breakdancers

I got this from answers.com



Toprock is a simple dance done standing up to initiate breakdancing. Its 
style is obvious to anyone watching, because it is incredibly unorthodox 
looking. Breakdancers take pride in having unique toprock that still stays 
within the definition of what toprock actually is.

Uprock is doing a toprock with someone else, sort of like a fight but 
without contact and very rhythmic. Uprocking is often confused with toprock, 
but the two are completely different dances

The basic 6-step resembles walking in a circle on the ground. Only one hand 
is touching the ground at a time. The 6-step is the building block for the 
rest of the dance, and is heavily 'teched' or modified to allow for 
variation and style.

Moonwalk: Many believe that the dance move made famous by Michael Jackson is 
called the moonwalk. In actuality, it is called the backslide. This is where 
a dancer slides backward while their legs appear to be walking forward. When 
a true moonwalk is performed, the dancer glides around on their feet in a 
similar way as a backslide, but travels in a circular, rather than linear, 
path. Mr. Wiggles, a famous hip-hop dancer, reiterates this difference 
during one of his instructional videos on gliding. This error in definition 
is not generally known to those outside of the breaking community.

The Worm: A move in which a dancer lies on the ground and forms a rippling 
motion through his body. This can be done if one of two ways, either forward 
or backwards, either shifting your weight from the upper body to the lower 
body (backwards) or vice-versa for forwards. Sophie Tucker is recognized as 
the creator of this move, which goes back to the 1920's. As this move is 
very old and very well known, even by those outside the breaking community, 
it is generally only performed when joking around and not in serious dance 
battles.

Headspin The dancer spins on his head, often while wearing a stocking cap, 
handkerchief, or even helmet. When the dancer uses his hands to aid in 
speeding up the spin, it is called 'tapping.' A dancer may tap for a few 
rotations and then 'glide' for as many as 15 rotations. Kid Freeze is the 
b-boy who claims to have invented the headspin.

Flare An incredibly difficult move borrowed from gymnastics and resembles 
the use of a Pommel Horse, but is performed without one.

Jackhammer A move performed on the ground, with the dancer balancing on one 
hand while laying his body on the elbow of the same arm. He then bounces up 
and down with his hand as he spins around.

Airflare An advanced move that is similar in theory to a flare or a 
windmill. While performing an airflare, the breaker is inverted with his 
torso at a 45 degree angle to the floor, his legs in a V-shape, and his arms 
straight. The hands are the only body part that touch the floor as the move 
is being performed. The bboy whips his legs, then arms around so that he 
travels in a circular path.

Not without the clunky Linux hack.  And even then, i think the sound

Subject: [sfraves] TTFN!

Hey crazy party kids,

I'm going to be out of the country for the next couple of months, so I'm
unsubbing from all my list subscriptions. I'm going to have all my mail
forwarded to a webmail account, so if you need to contact me just send
me a message at this address... but don't expect a speedy reply. :)

See you in June!

Toodles,

not sure if this would be overkill for your needs, but my 
recommendation is an Archos av320.  i swapped the hard drive for an 80 
gb - it was cheaper to do this than to buy the 80 gb model.

it records mp4 video, mp3 audio (up to 192kbps), or WAV (up to 48khz), 
and with the proper cable, can record digital (SPDIF) audio signal - 
great for dubbing from a DAT deck. also has USB 2.0, so file transfers 
are quick.

i lurve this thing - my only complaint is that the battery life is too 
short.

Drug users flock to Easter parade
By Liam Houlihan, Melbourne Australia
29mar05

EVERY weekend one St Kilda car park is transformed into a bustling, 
open-air supermarket for illegal drugs.

The Herald Sun spent the early hours of Easter Saturday in the car park, 
while a dance party was going on next door at The Palace, and found it 
teeming with almost every kind of illicit drug.

In the space of two hours the Herald Sun witnessed:

GIRLS on the Esplanade openly handling ecstasy tablets.

OCCUPANTS of a car puffing on two "crack pipes" - glass devices used for 
smoking crack cocaine or a pure form of amphetamine called crystal meth.

TWO men using a rolled-up banknote to snort lines of white powder - either 
amphetamines or cocaine.

Early on Easter Saturday we were approached by two men, in a group of four, 
who tried to sell us ecstasy tablets.

"You want flippers?" one of them said. "Come on, you guys, I'll sell you 
flippers at the best price ever - two for $25."

Three of the four then posed for a photograph.

Ravers say drug dealers operate from their vehicles in the car park and can 
be found there like clockwork every Friday night for The Palace's weekly 
dance party, Bass Station.

They say it is an underground Melbourne institution that is as reliable as 
the McDonald's that is only a block or two away.

Dealers sold the dangerous drug GHB directly from their cars to those going 
to the indoor rave, ravers said.

One described it as just like having a hot-dog stand outside a pub.

"The ones that stay outside are the dodgy crew," said Jack, a 22-year-old 
hardcore house fan.

"If you've passed out a couple of times (on drugs), the club is not going 
to let you back in. The car park is for anyone that's really dodgy or 
hardcore. But drugs are quite prominent - buying and selling - inside the 
club, too."

On Saturday morning, some in the full car park did burnouts or danced as 
their car stereos blasted out techno music. Others smoked marijuana joints 
as they queued for tickets at the front of The Palace.

Jack said the concrete lot, which holds more than 200 cars, was the best 
place in Melbourne to go when you were stuck for drugs.

One raver, who called himself "Goat", wore a singlet that said: "Go Home G 
Heads" - a reference to users of GHB, a drug that many in the rave scene shun.

"I just don't like G," he said. "When people are on it, they sometimes 
can't stand up at all. Watching people just blow out on it - it's not good."

In February last year - before the widely publicised admission to hospital 
of 10 people at the Two Tribes rave - paramedics reported treating eight 
people found near the St Kilda car park for suspected overdoses.

Three of those required life support.

The same month, police swooped on the Jacka Boulevard car park and arrested 
five people for drug trafficking and possession offences.

More than 1200 ravers attended the bigger than usual Good Friday version of 
The Palace's weekly house music night.

Dozens more were turned away at the door. At 3.30am on Easter Saturday, the 
car park was still full.

Regulars of Bass Station said they were rarely, if ever, subjected to 
pat-down searches on entering the dance club.

The US is:  "...a nation of 200 million used-car salesmen with all the 
money we need to buy guns and no qualms about killing anybody else in the 
world who tries to make us uncomfortable."
-Hunter S. Thompson

"Friend, hope for the truth while you are alive.  Jump into experience 
while you are alive!  What you call "salvation" belongs to the time before 
death.  If you don't break your ropes while you are alive, do you think 
ghosts will do it after?"
-Kabir

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) Quote of the Day (Tue)

did i ever tell you about the time i had the first job i ever had?  well, this
was either the first or second job i had.  i was a singing telegram.  this
career was short-lived.  in fact, i'm not even sure why i took the job.  i
think i took it because i was so easily hired.  anyway, my first (and last)
assignment was to drive up to daly city in a chicken costume and sing "happy
bird-day" to someone.  well, i got to the block where it was, but i was looking
for the address and i set the chicken head down by my car to find the address.

well guess what happened?  yep, you guessed right!  i came back 5 minutes later
and the chicken head had disappeared!  i was so embarrassed that i drove back
to the place, and gave the costume back and told them i'd "be right back". 
well i never came back.  the lady called my house saying she was going to call
the police if i didn't return the head.  my dad ended up driving me up to
pacifica police department to file a police report.

so ends my first (i think) job).

today's quote i got from the movie "party monster" ... which is disturbing, but
a must see.  here's mcauley culkin to leave you cringing the rest of the day. 
by the way, he's not kidding about what he's saying!

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Wushu from Hong Kong - this week

No, this is not music related at all, but I wanted to get the word out
about a few events this week.  As you may or may not know, I am an
avid practitioner of Chinese Wushu, a contemporary form of martial
arts.  This week, a team from Hong Kong is visiting the bay area and
will be doing several performances.

Even if you don't know what wushu is, you have most likely seen it
various movies, tv shows and commercials.  It is a dynamic and
beautiful art and sport and definitely worth checking out!  Here's the
info on the performances:

Asian Art Museum
200 Larkin Street
Martial Arts Demonstration with the Hong Kong Youth Wu Shu Troupe
Thursday, March 31
6:00 pm
Samsung Hall
Free with museum admission. Space is limited, and is offered on a
first-come, first-served basis. Free tickets will be distributed in
South Court starting at 5:00 pm on the day of the performance.


MACY'S
FRIDAY, APRIL 1ST
Wushu Demo - 12pm
Mens Bldg., Level 1
Come see the World Wushu Champions from Hong Kong as they perform the
Taiji, based on the Chinese philosophy of "Yin" and "Yang" as they
maneuver spectacular weapons used in ancient China like the dao and
the jian. These performers will illustrate the skill of co-operation
and coordination in the Chinese cultural legacy, Wushu.

and

Union Square Park
Saturday, April 2nd
Noon-2pm
They will be performing along with various dance and performance groups.

They will also be performing in the evening at the UC Berkeley Chinese
Martial Arts Tournament.  www.calwushu.com


To get an idea of what wushu is like, check out this video from a
recent youth competition in China:

well, i don't think i have any really fascinating stories today ... not that my
chicken head story was all that great ... but it looks like johnny cochrane is
dead at 67 of a brain tumor or something.  rest in peace, johnny.  hope you
enjoyed life because you can't take the fruits of this one into the next.

turf, little brothers, flowers, hula, hoops, boomboxes, ghettoblasters, D
and C batteries, sound systems, band, troupe, stunt, swimming pools,
trampolines, skate boards, guitars & drums, frisbees, soccer balls, chalk,
hammocks, trees, lemonade, sunblock, beach balls, banners, noisemakers,
instruments, puppets, urban redecoration toolkits, and of course your
friends.

be connected: this is important -- please add your CELLphone # to our
txt-mob!  we're gonna start using text messaging to help people find our

My friend has the iriver and thought it was pretty cool device.  He
did have some serious issues with levels though.  It's easy to clip on
the unit and end up with only static.  It would have been a better
unit if it showed you your levels.

Any idea if any of these do show your recording levels?

the archos shows, and lets you adjust your levels, but the line-in jack 
runs a little high, and i've had trouble with clipping at times, 
especially with less-experienced DJs who go apeshit on the mixer and 
red line the output.

Yeah, what I *really* want is this Edirol R-4:

http://www.edirol.com/products/info/r4.html

It has analog compression/limiting to prevent clipping.  They are so
stupid to do 4 channel, though... why not just stereo at a cheaper price?

The R-4 will set you back $1600... ouch!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: MP3 recorders - line in - suggestions???

It's supposed to compete with things like a Zaxcom Deva and the Nagra
D, which are all 4+ track machines for location audio recording for
video production, and that cost $3K+..

There is that little handheld Edirol that does two channels and goes
for $4-500..  I think it has some sort of limiter function but I
haven't been able to scope out whether it is analog (useful) or digital
(not).

Then again, you could sit it on top of something like a Really Nice
Compressor by FMR Audio- a sub-$200, near-audiophile-quality compressor
that is about the size of a few cd jewel cases stacked up.  It does a
beautiful job of gracefully controlling clipping, if asked, and also
sounds great just for overall mix compression (try SuperNice mode!), if
you're into getting things a bit more balanced before they hit the
A/Ds- I know I am not yet a champ at matching levels track to track
when mixing records and cds..

For basic recording of live sets, there is an Ipod Shuffle-sized unit
called the Muvo Micro, by Creative, that has a stereo line in and costs
$150.  The sound quality is not supposed to be superlative, but for
simply documenting sets, sure is nice to have a solid-state thing the
size of a pack of gum to plop onto the mixer when you play out! :) 
Then get home, plug it in via usb, and shuttle the mp3 right off of the
thing.  Perty!

Cheers,
George

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: RIP Fred Korematsu

FRED KOREMATSU | 1919-2005

OAKLAND MAN'S STAND AGAINST CAMPS LED TO U.S. APOLOGY TO JAPANESE-AMERICANS

By Jessie Mangaliman and L.A. Chung

Mercury News

Fred Korematsu, the unassuming Oakland draftsman who unsuccessfully
challenged the detention of Japanese-Americans during World War II --
but was vindicated 40 years later -- died Wednesday of respiratory
failure at his daughter's home in Marin County.

Korematsu was 86.

``He had a very strong will,'' said Dale Minami, his friend and
attorney. ``He was like our Rosa Parks.''

To many Japanese-Americans and others, Korematsu was a civil rights
icon who risked not only the legal wrath of his own government, but
also the scorn of his own people when in 1944 he challenged the
internment of 120,000 Japanese-Americans.

Korematsu's stirring legal saga was the subject of an Emmy-winning PBS
documentary in 2002: Born in Oakland, he was one of four sons of
Japanese immigrants who owned a flower nursery. When ordered to go to
detention camp, Korematsu refused because he believed that Executive
Order 9066, signed by President Roosevelt, violated his constitutional
rights.

Korematsu, a 23-year-old welder at the time, went into hiding briefly,
altering his face with plastic surgery. He was soon arrested in San
Leandro.

In May 1942, he was convicted in federal court of violating the
presidential order. He appealed.

In the now-infamous 1944 case, Korematsu vs. United States, cited in
every constitutional law textbook, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that
the mass detention of Japanese-Americans was justified by national
security concerns.

At the time, it was a deep disappointment to young Korematsu. But some
Japanese-Americans thought he was unpatriotic. After losing the case,
Korematsu resigned himself to internment camp.

In 1982, three young Japanese-American lawyers in San Francisco
approached the feisty Korematsu and persuaded him to take his case
back to court. Minami, Karen Kai and Don Tamaki were energized by
their own parents and grandparents who had been interned.

The following year, Judge Marilyn Hall Patel of U.S. District Court in
San Francisco overturned Korematsu's conviction, citing government
misconduct through suppression, alteration and burning of evidence,
race discrimination, lack of military necessity, and manifest
injustice. ``We were not only trying to reverse a very bad legal
precedent,'' recalled Don Tamaki, ``but we were also trying to
vindicate our families.''

To Tamaki, ``the case represented the trials that Japanese-Americans
never had.''

``Fred was a giant in our community and a man who fought not only for
the civil rights for Japanese-Americans but for all Americans,''
Minami said. ``He took an unpopular stand at a time when the country
was in crisis. And he withstood criticism and ostracism 40 years
later.''

``There was truly an understanding that this case was a historic
one,'' said Kai, one of his other attorneys. ``It had tremendous
meaning on a personal level, but also in a much larger sense in terms
of constitutional law and civil rights.''

Korematsu's case paved the way for the landmark 1988 Civil Liberties
Act, when the U.S. government acknowledged that the detention of
Japanese-Americans was wrong, and apologized.

In 1998, President Clinton awarded Korematsu with the Presidential
Medal of Freedom, the country's highest civilian honor.

``In the long history of our country's constant search for justice,
some names of ordinary citizens stand for millions of souls -- Plessy,
Brown, Parks,'' Clinton had said. ``To that distinguished list today
we add the name of Fred Korematsu.''

Korematsu loomed large in the collective memory of young
Japanese-Americans like Chris Hirano, a director at the Japanese
Cultural and Community Center of Northern California.

``He's been incredibly inspiring,'' said Hirano. ``He epitomized
courage in the face of adversity.''

Hirano said he had spent some time with Korematsu. ``What I learned
from him is a lesson in simple philosophy of doing what's right,''
Hirano said, ``and in doing that, he changed the world.''

Doesn't sound like it's too hot for recording, but it is cheap:

Subject: [sfraves] Moby gets skewered.



For some reason, I have always thought Moby to be a little dork.  I don't
know why.. something about his attitude always rubbed me the wrong way.
Becuase of this, I took some perverse pleasure by his latest album getting
totally skewered by the New York Times this morning:

ALBUM REVIEW | MOBY


    What's Left After the End of Music

By KELEFA SANNEH
<http://query.nytimes.com/search/query?ppds=bylL&v1=KELEFA
SANNEH&fdq=19960101&td=sysdate&sort=newest&ac=KELEFA SANNEH&inline=nyt-per>

Published: March 31, 2005

In the late 1990's, Moby wasn't yet an ideology or a brand name or even
a pop star.

He was just a soft-spoken music geek, and he seemed likely to spend his
career enjoying the kind of underground fame that might ordinarily
attach to a punk rocker turned electronica producer turned eclecticist.
But then came "Play," in 1999, which laid scratchy old gospel and blues
samples over spotless new house music; nearly every track was soothing,
sort of melancholy, unexpectedly hummable. And soon Moby wasn't just a
musicmaker - he was a paradigm-shifter.

"Play" was an unexpected commercial success, even though the guy behind
it had neither a famous face nor a famous voice nor even, at first, a
famous song. Moby has been lodged in the celebrity constellation ever
since. His albums don't sneak into record shops anymore, they arrive -
or they are supposed to. This week, his new double CD, "Hotel" (V2),
makes its disappointing debut at No. 28 on the Billboard album charts.

How did "Play" make Moby a star in the first place? As most articles
about "Play" mentioned, Moby marketed his album by licensing the tracks
to commercials and soundtracks; relying on the power of corporate
synergy, he had made an end run around the pop establishment.

His wasn't just a success story, then, it was a new kind of success
story. Even better (according to the strange rules that governed 1999),
it was a success story involving the words "geek" and "synergy."
Suddenly, regular pop stars seemed old-fashioned: a bunch of oversized
personalities, jockeying for space on radio stations that broadcast
their songs using an antiquated system of frequency modulation. By
contrast, Moby was a scientist, a musical technician who listened to
everything and distilled what he heard into some state-of-the-art pop
essence.

"I want to have the broadest possible sonic palette to draw on when I'm
composing music," he told Gerald Marzorati of The New York Times
Magazine, adding that he'd been listening to "pop records, dance
records, classical records." And you could tell he felt a bit sorry for
those sad 20th-century types who confined themselves to a single genre.
He was a pop star for a world too sophisticated to believe in pop stars
- a post-pop-star, perhaps.

"The end of history will be a very sad time," the political theorist
Francis Fukuyama wrote in 1989, anticipating, after a fashion, Moby's
world. Mr. Fukuyama imagined a future defined by "economic calculation,
the endless solving of technical problems, environmental concerns, and
the satisfaction of sophisticated consumer demands." The appeal of Moby
was that he would give us a way to enjoy this future; he would satisfy
our "sophisticated consumer demands" through superior engineering.

In 2002, having picked up a few million new fans, Moby got a chance to
put this theory into practice with "18," and it was immediately clear
that something had gone wrong. In the liner notes, he opined, "One
problem in writing an essay for this record is that the circumstances of
the world are in such a state of flux," and many of the songs were just
as banal (and, somehow, as smug) as this bit of boilerplate.

Too sophisticated to believe in musical genres, Moby caricatured them
instead. "We Are All Made of Stars" had some vaguely new-wavey guitar, a
gentle backbeat and lyrics that aped the spaced-out platitudes of a bad
David Bowie song: "People they come together/People they fall
apart/Nothing can stop us now/'Cause we are all made of stars." From the
token hip-hop track ("Jam for the Ladies," which sounded a lot like the
Chemical Brothers) to the "Play"-ish "Sunday (the Day Before My
Birthday)" - which sounds less appealing, not more, when you learn that
Moby was born on Sept. 11 - the album showed the limits of pop as science.

Last year, Moby followed "18" with a stopgap techno album, "Baby Monkey"
(credited to his alter ego, Voodoo Child), which was meant as a lark but
sounded like an insult. He seemed to think he was a smart producer
dabbling in a dumb genre he had long since outgrown (he called the album
"very simple, melodic, electronic, dance music"), although the CD
swiftly disproved the notion that techno was easy.

And now comes "Hotel," packaged as a two-disc set: the album on one
disc, and a series of "ambient" remixes on a second. Again, there are
liner notes to guide us through the music. "I don't feel like making
music that is airless and lifeless because I also really like people and
the messy miasma of the human condition and I want to make messy, human
records that are open and emotional," he writes, as if this truism
unlocked a secret to music making.

More than ever, the focus here is on Moby as a singer and songwriter,
which is strange, because he is not very good at either job. In his
effort to leave generic constraints behind, he has drifted toward some
rather neutral variant of alternative-rock. In the lyrics, as in the
liner notes, he seems to mistake obviousness for truth: the lead single
is a mind-numbing song called, "Beautiful," where the romantic dialogue
consists largely of couplets like, "I love you baby/I love you now/I
love you baby/I love you now."

This music isn't just dull, though. Like much of what Moby has produced
since "Play," it's condescending, too. Much of it sounds like the work
of a producer who thinks pop music is supposed to be kind of idiotic,
and who thinks pop audiences should be glad that he deigns to give us
what we want. Do we like sex? O.K., here's "I Like It," four singularly
unpleasant minutes of heavy breathing. Do we like songs about how the
world is happy and sad and good and bad? O.K., here's "Slipping Away,"
with a wispy beat and Moby crooning, "Open to everything, happy and
sad/Seeing the good when it's all going . . ." - you can finish the
couplets yourself. And, knowing that we like familiarity, Moby has his
collaborator, Laura Dawn, sing a slowed-down version of the New Order
hit "Temptation."

Maybe this isn't really Moby's fault so much as it is ours. Like so many
other things in the late 1990's, his new paradigm seemed like a great
idea: car commercials were going to be the new pop songs and laptop
composers were going to be the new pop stars. But it turns out that we

Mr. Fukuyama, in his famous obituary, might have written (but didn't
quite, of course) that "boredom at the end of music will serve to get
music started once again." That's an appealing idea, but it's also
appealing to know, listening to "Hotel," that it won't be necessary. The
end of music seems to have ended itself.

Yep.. you can take it further too.  There are portable, battery-powered
A/D converters you can buy that output S/PDIF.  This way, you can bypass
your MP3 recorder's mediocore A/Ds and go right in digitally.  They
even have ones with 48V phantom power so you can hook up a mic directly.

Fun stuff on the cheap...

Becuase of this, I took some perverse pleasure by his latest album

ALBUM REVIEW | MOBY


    What's Left After the End of Music

By KELEFA SANNEH

SANNEH&inline=3Dnyt-per>

Published: March 31, 2005

In the late 1990's, Moby wasn't yet an ideology or a brand name or even
a pop star.

He was just a soft-spoken music geek, and he seemed likely to spend his
career enjoying the kind of underground fame that might ordinarily
attach to a punk rocker turned electronica producer turned eclecticist.
But then came "Play," in 1999, which laid scratchy old gospel and blues
samples over spotless new house music; nearly every track was soothing,
sort of melancholy, unexpectedly hummable. And soon Moby wasn't just a
musicmaker - he was a paradigm-shifter.

"Play" was an unexpected commercial success, even though the guy behind
it had neither a famous face nor a famous voice nor even, at first, a
famous song. Moby has been lodged in the celebrity constellation ever
since. His albums don't sneak into record shops anymore, they arrive -
or they are supposed to. This week, his new double CD, "Hotel" (V2),
makes its disappointing debut at No. 28 on the Billboard album charts.

How did "Play" make Moby a star in the first place? As most articles
about "Play" mentioned, Moby marketed his album by licensing the tracks
to commercials and soundtracks; relying on the power of corporate
synergy, he had made an end run around the pop establishment.

His wasn't just a success story, then, it was a new kind of success
story. Even better (according to the strange rules that governed 1999),
it was a success story involving the words "geek" and "synergy."
Suddenly, regular pop stars seemed old-fashioned: a bunch of oversized
personalities, jockeying for space on radio stations that broadcast
their songs using an antiquated system of frequency modulation. By
contrast, Moby was a scientist, a musical technician who listened to
everything and distilled what he heard into some state-of-the-art pop
essence.

"I want to have the broadest possible sonic palette to draw on when I'm
composing music," he told Gerald Marzorati of The New York Times
Magazine, adding that he'd been listening to "pop records, dance
records, classical records." And you could tell he felt a bit sorry for
those sad 20th-century types who confined themselves to a single genre.
He was a pop star for a world too sophisticated to believe in pop stars
- a post-pop-star, perhaps.

"The end of history will be a very sad time," the political theorist
Francis Fukuyama wrote in 1989, anticipating, after a fashion, Moby's
world. Mr. Fukuyama imagined a future defined by "economic calculation,
the endless solving of technical problems, environmental concerns, and
the satisfaction of sophisticated consumer demands." The appeal of Moby
was that he would give us a way to enjoy this future; he would satisfy
our "sophisticated consumer demands" through superior engineering.

In 2002, having picked up a few million new fans, Moby got a chance to
put this theory into practice with "18," and it was immediately clear
that something had gone wrong. In the liner notes, he opined, "One
problem in writing an essay for this record is that the circumstances of
the world are in such a state of flux," and many of the songs were just
as banal (and, somehow, as smug) as this bit of boilerplate.

Too sophisticated to believe in musical genres, Moby caricatured them
instead. "We Are All Made of Stars" had some vaguely new-wavey guitar, a
gentle backbeat and lyrics that aped the spaced-out platitudes of a bad
David Bowie song: "People they come together/People they fall
apart/Nothing can stop us now/'Cause we are all made of stars." From the
token hip-hop track ("Jam for the Ladies," which sounded a lot like the
Chemical Brothers) to the "Play"-ish "Sunday (the Day Before My
Birthday)" - which sounds less appealing, not more, when you learn that
Moby was born on Sept. 11 - the album showed the limits of pop as
science.

Last year, Moby followed "18" with a stopgap techno album, "Baby Monkey"
(credited to his alter ego, Voodoo Child), which was meant as a lark but
sounded like an insult. He seemed to think he was a smart producer
dabbling in a dumb genre he had long since outgrown (he called the album
"very simple, melodic, electronic, dance music"), although the CD
swiftly disproved the notion that techno was easy.

And now comes "Hotel," packaged as a two-disc set: the album on one
disc, and a series of "ambient" remixes on a second. Again, there are
liner notes to guide us through the music. "I don't feel like making
music that is airless and lifeless because I also really like people and
the messy miasma of the human condition and I want to make messy, human
records that are open and emotional," he writes, as if this truism
unlocked a secret to music making.

More than ever, the focus here is on Moby as a singer and songwriter,
which is strange, because he is not very good at either job. In his
effort to leave generic constraints behind, he has drifted toward some
rather neutral variant of alternative-rock. In the lyrics, as in the
liner notes, he seems to mistake obviousness for truth: the lead single
is a mind-numbing song called, "Beautiful," where the romantic dialogue
consists largely of couplets like, "I love you baby/I love you now/I
love you baby/I love you now."

This music isn't just dull, though. Like much of what Moby has produced
since "Play," it's condescending, too. Much of it sounds like the work
of a producer who thinks pop music is supposed to be kind of idiotic,
and who thinks pop audiences should be glad that he deigns to give us
what we want. Do we like sex? O.K., here's "I Like It," four singularly
unpleasant minutes of heavy breathing. Do we like songs about how the
world is happy and sad and good and bad? O.K., here's "Slipping Away,"
with a wispy beat and Moby crooning, "Open to everything, happy and
sad/Seeing the good when it's all going . . ." - you can finish the
couplets yourself. And, knowing that we like familiarity, Moby has his
collaborator, Laura Dawn, sing a slowed-down version of the New Order
hit "Temptation."

Maybe this isn't really Moby's fault so much as it is ours. Like so many
other things in the late 1990's, his new paradigm seemed like a great
idea: car commercials were going to be the new pop songs and laptop
composers were going to be the new pop stars. But it turns out that we
really do like those oversized personalities who clog the radio stations
- some of whom even double as superior engineers.

Mr. Fukuyama, in his famous obituary, might have written (but didn't
quite, of course) that "boredom at the end of music will serve to get
music started once again." That's an appealing idea, but it's also
appealing to know, listening to "Hotel," that it won't be necessary. The
end of music seems to have ended itself.

Subject: [sfraves] FnF camp fund-raiser auction - this saturday!

This Saturday, Friends & Family will be having a live auction and 
no-host cocktail party in SF to raise money for our 2005 Burning Man 
camp.

We'll be auctioning off services such as a 1 hour massage, a night of 
pampering, 2 hours of advanced Photoshop tutoring, a sailboat cruise 
around the bay, didjeridoo lessons, and menu planning and cooking 
services for a 4-person dinner party. All of the services have been 
graciously donated by members of the FnF community. Keep in mind that 
this is only a partial list of the auction items.

DJs for the evening (tentative):  Ethan, Danny Picard, Coldwar, Matt 
G., Indigo, and Dom Baranowski.

The event will take place at a location in San Francisco.  I regret 
that I can't post directions, but we have a very limited capacity.

Please contact me directly for more details.  Admission is free!

yeah, okay, whatever "Mr. I Buy Into Right Wing Propaganda Without 
Questioning".  

Its fair to say NYT is biased, as is all media.  But its just stupid
to say it is crappy.  Its as good as journalism gets in this country.

Get the hell out of your Republican echo chamber and try thinking for
yourself.

Subject: [sfraves] more auction items

Here's an updated list of auction items for the FnF Burning Man Camp 
Fundraiser this Saturday:


1) 2 hours of intermediate/advanced Photoshop lessons from a guy who 
really know
his skills. He can teach you tricks of the trade and how to achieve 
those
techniques you've always wondered about.

2) Up to four hours of Photography work. Either lessons and/or 
shooting. This
could include company photos, family photos, art photos, sexy shots to 
give your
loved one, or maybe just the ego boost of the best photo you've ever 
had taken of
yourself.

3) "Night of the 7 Veils" This is an evening of Moroccan luxury. 
Dinner, belly
dancing, massage, pampering. This item can accommodate up to six people.

4) Video Services. This can include shooting, editing or tutoring Final 
Cut Pro.

5) Sewing Lessons from one of the CFDC Fashion Show renowned designers.

6) 1.5 hours massage, energy work, meditation and/or reiki - sure to 
send you into
outer bliss.

7) DJ services for your party or bar mitzvah

8) Two Didgeridoo Lessons. How often does this come up? And if you 
don't own your
own didge, one will be provided for you. So cool.

9) Guitar Lessons. Acoustic or rock - your choice. Two lessons included 
in this item.

10) Two hours of Graphic/Web Design work. I know some of you could use 
updates to your web site.
Now's the time to do it!

11) Super-Basic Loop & Sample Recording Lesson - want to compose 
electronica? Have
zero musical skills? Cool!! Using Acid and SoundForge, you will learn 
how to make
a smokin' track out of loops and samples from your own records!

12) Scrabble Lesson from a pro who used to play on the tournament 
circuit and
national championships. He can show you how to blow your friends off 
the board!

13) A trip on a 36' Sailboat around the bay for a group of up to 5 
people. The
boat has a bathroom on it, downstairs cabin with 5 beds, icebox and 
stove. Lunch
will be included in the trip. Typical trips around the bay are 6 hours. 
What a
great way to spend a perfect day.

14) Want to relax? Well then, bid on a 1 hour massage with a butterfly 
who's touch
will surely make you forget your own name.

15) Cooking/shopping lesson for a gourmet Vegan meal. We've all wanted 
to learn to
eat healthier, but don't know where to begin. Well here's your chance 
to learn
with someone who's had lots of experience making some of the best food 
this side
of the hemisphere!

16) A night on the town complete with Limo, Champagne and all the 
catering
amenities. This item can accommodate up to four people.

We will be able to take payment installments on any of the higher 
priced items.
We will also be accepting paypal and checks.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Moby gets skewered.

Lately I think the title "Libertarian", when used by folks around here,
simply means, "Republican who thinks they'd be run out of town on a
rail if found out, thus guises it in a less-conflagratory title".

Sorry, I've yet to meet a libertarian that didn't have a double
standard when it came to what "liberty" meant, and your commentary on
this list has been firmly, resolutely right-wing. 

Not that there's anything wrong with that, and neither is there
anything wrong with my being a tofu-toting, organic-veggie-worshipping,
hippie-parents-having bleeding heart.

Just, let's call a spade a spade and also try and keep the troll posts
to a minimum.

George,

I didn't send a troll post. I was agreeing with a post about Moby. It
had nothing to do with politics. My opinion of the NYT has nothing to do
with politics either. It is MY OWM opinion that the newspaper sucks
because most articles I've read from it don't use proper journalistic
ethics.

So, you and Troy can get off my case and go fuck off now.

I don't understand why you guys are such assholes around here.

Clearly George was speaking in general; you've sent troll posts in the 
past, and you will in the future.  George is advocating fewer.

I'm only clarifying the message; while I haven't trolled recently, it's not 
because of George. :)

I just think he's overrated. He has some good tracks, but by and large it's

>"Play" was an unexpected commercial success, even though the guy behind

>since. His albums don't sneak into record shops anymore, they arrive -
>or they are supposed to. This week, his new double CD, "Hotel" (V2),
>makes its disappointing debut at No. 28 on the Billboard album charts.
>
>How did "Play" make Moby a star in the first place? As most articles
>about "Play" mentioned, Moby marketed his album by licensing the tracks
>to commercials and soundtracks; relying on the power of corporate
>synergy, he had made an end run around the pop establishment.
>
>His wasn't just a success story, then, it was a new kind of success
>story. Even better (according to the strange rules that governed 1999),
>it was a success story involving the words "geek" and "synergy."
>Suddenly, regular pop stars seemed old-fashioned: a bunch of oversized
>personalities, jockeying for space on radio stations that broadcast
>their songs using an antiquated system of frequency modulation. By
>contrast, Moby was a scientist, a musical technician who listened to
>everything and distilled what he heard into some state-of-the-art pop
>essence.
>
>"I want to have the broadest possible sonic palette to draw on when I'm
>composing music," he told Gerald Marzorati of The New York Times
>Magazine, adding that he'd been listening to "pop records, dance
>records, classical records." And you could tell he felt a bit sorry for
>those sad 20th-century types who confined themselves to a single genre.
>He was a pop star for a world too sophisticated to believe in pop stars
>- a post-pop-star, perhaps.
>
>"The end of history will be a very sad time," the political theorist
>Francis Fukuyama wrote in 1989, anticipating, after a fashion, Moby's
>world. Mr. Fukuyama imagined a future defined by "economic calculation,
>the endless solving of technical problems, environmental concerns, and
>the satisfaction of sophisticated consumer demands." The appeal of Moby
>was that he would give us a way to enjoy this future; he would satisfy
>our "sophisticated consumer demands" through superior engineering.
>
>In 2002, having picked up a few million new fans, Moby got a chance to
>put this theory into practice with "18," and it was immediately clear
>that something had gone wrong. In the liner notes, he opined, "One
>problem in writing an essay for this record is that the circumstances of
>the world are in such a state of flux," and many of the songs were just
>as banal (and, somehow, as smug) as this bit of boilerplate.
>
>Too sophisticated to believe in musical genres, Moby caricatured them
>instead. "We Are All Made of Stars" had some vaguely new-wavey guitar, a
>gentle backbeat and lyrics that aped the spaced-out platitudes of a bad
>David Bowie song: "People they come together/People they fall
>apart/Nothing can stop us now/'Cause we are all made of stars." From the
>token hip-hop track ("Jam for the Ladies," which sounded a lot like the
>Chemical Brothers) to the "Play"-ish "Sunday (the Day Before My
>Birthday)" - which sounds less appealing, not more, when you learn that
>Moby was born on Sept. 11 - the album showed the limits of pop as science.
>
>Last year, Moby followed "18" with a stopgap techno album, "Baby Monkey"
>(credited to his alter ego, Voodoo Child), which was meant as a lark but
>sounded like an insult. He seemed to think he was a smart producer
>dabbling in a dumb genre he had long since outgrown (he called the album
>"very simple, melodic, electronic, dance music"), although the CD
>swiftly disproved the notion that techno was easy.
>
>And now comes "Hotel," packaged as a two-disc set: the album on one
>disc, and a series of "ambient" remixes on a second. Again, there are
>liner notes to guide us through the music. "I don't feel like making
>music that is airless and lifeless because I also really like people and
>the messy miasma of the human condition and I want to make messy, human
>records that are open and emotional," he writes, as if this truism
>unlocked a secret to music making.
>
>More than ever, the focus here is on Moby as a singer and songwriter,
>which is strange, because he is not very good at either job. In his
>effort to leave generic constraints behind, he has drifted toward some
>rather neutral variant of alternative-rock. In the lyrics, as in the

>is a mind-numbing song called, "Beautiful," where the romantic dialogue
>consists largely of couplets like, "I love you baby/I love you now/I
>love you baby/I love you now."
>
>This music isn't just dull, though. Like much of what Moby has produced
>since "Play," it's condescending, too. Much of it sounds like the work
>of a producer who thinks pop music is supposed to be kind of idiotic,
>and who thinks pop audiences should be glad that he deigns to give us

Define "past" and please show me these "troll" posts.=20

And you can't predict my future.

BTW George apologized in private after he realized his mistake. Maybe

Clearly George was speaking in general; you've sent troll posts in the=20
past, and you will in the future.  George is advocating fewer.

I'm only clarifying the message; while I haven't trolled recently, it's

because of George. :)

Jeez dude, it sure didn't take much provocation to get you to show your
hand again..

I sent you a retractory reply after you blew up at my statement to try
to defuse things a bit, knowing that my email had been a bit of a
pre-emptive strike, and a little nastily worded, at that.  I wanted to
keep the peace.

However, I did write my original message for the same reason- that
being that I've seen you go off on many tangents on this list, some of
them somewhat abusive, most wildly dismissive of any viewpoint but your
own, and some that look like just plain lefty-bait.

This crack about the NYT looked very much like the latter, given that
that newspaper is a popular target for right-wing pundits.  

In any case, at the end of the day, any discussion is better than none,
but let's cool the attacks on people you don't know- especially other
artists whose work you have no familiarity with.  Just because your
promotional style differs from others doesn't mean that SFR is not a
list where people are meant to share about their events.  

Have some heart, and some post-high school manners, bra.

Cheers,
-GC

Well when you tell my boy to fuck off and call the list a bunch of assholes,
I call that a dickhead post.

Oh and don't threaten me on a public forum, if you're going to "come find

Subject: RE: [sfraves]was Moby gets skewered. (Now public apology)


I just want to give a public apology to this list for the posts I made
today.

I'm extremely sensitive right now. Today is my 5th day being sober from
a 2 year daily DXM addiction (about 1gram per day).

Blast away, I'm not embarrassed of my addiction anymore.

Well when you tell my boy to fuck off and call the list a bunch of
assholes,
I call that a dickhead post.

Oh and don't threaten me on a public forum, if you're going to "come
find
me" you might want to leave less of a trail.

just make sure your 5th day turns into 5th year and so on.

as a suggestion, if you're in a sensitive mood, SFR might not be the

I can understand the lure of DXM (I intend to try a trip one of these days, 
once I find
a pure supplier... and have the time and no job and etc etc)  but how the 
hell does
one get addicted?  I can't imagine how the fogginess I get off of 
Robotussin et al
(for colds) being in any way alluring enough to go back and go back again.  the
disassociatives are a bit icky....  ok, K has quite the otherworldlyness 
and the
psychological escapism is obvious.... but DXM?  I didn't think it was that 
powerful

good luck,
doug

Yeek, well, jeez.  Sorry to hear that, m'man.  I hope all is well soon.
 Having dealt with addiction from time to time I can grok where you're
coming from.

Keep the faith!  You can do it.

DXM is way stronger.  Imagine a wall, about 3 feet thick.  K puts you in 
middle of the wall, and DXM puts you on the other side.. but you can move

(Steve) I know it's trading one vice for another, however ganja has helped me overcome a couple nasty habits. 
 
Perhaps it might be worth looking into an Rx. I would be happy to send you some referrals in private. 
 
Best,
 
Chuck

DXM is way stronger. Imagine a wall, about 3 feet thick. K puts you in 
middle of the wall, and DXM puts you on the other side.. but you can move 
around and be active. I've had a lot of fun with it, but I can't bear the 
taste of cough syrup any more. haven't "sipped the scissor" in a couple

Subject: RE: [sfraves]was Moby gets skewered. (Now public apology)

You can find DXM in huge quantities (legally) all over the 
inter-web-net-thing for dirt cheap. Why anyone would CHOOSE to "trip" off of 
DXM tho is totally beyond me. It is absolutely nauseating. Think of the 
deepest K-hole, go about a mile deeper and add a serious drunk on top of it. 
Can we say queasy and not fun anyone??

Steve - good luck on your recovery though. No sarcasm - seriously, good 
luck. Addiction is a bitch.

Subject: RE: [sfraves]was public apology, now Everything begines with an E.


Thanks.

 feel like telling the story so I will:

I was always anti-drug until:

I attended a rave back in 98 and a friend gave me an E.
I loved it. It was a truly mind blowing experience. I connected with
everyone at the party. I remember dancing with a whole group of people,
making eye contact, the feeling of rubbing up against that stranger. The
way the music twisted open and became so full and beautiful. Colors were
vibrant. How strange I thought that we could feel so much and open
ourselves to complete strangers in such a way. I did more (though not a
lot, just an ocasional controlled thing).

Then:

I get a couple bad pills mixed with mdma/mda/dxm which gives me
seritonin syndrome and I get very sick. I research what happened to me
and discover DXM. Looking to experiement and for a safer trip (since dxm
is free of adulterants because it's legal) I order dexalone.

At first the trips were not that great. Compared to e, it was very
different. I continue to start to experiment more. Trying different
doses (the effects are completely different at different doses). I start
doing it weekly.

See, if ecstacy is going into yourself, DXM is the opposite. It is going
out  of yourself (which can be pretty damn euphoric)

So instead of being at a bright busy rave it's better enjoyed in the
dark with headphones on. Floating away. The euphoria of Out of your
body. Out of your problems. Talking with aliens. Talking to God. Visuals
that were better then any lazer show I had ever seen. The next thing I
knew, I was buying powder, packing pills, and doing it everyday. Two
years go by and I'm realizing that I'm killing myself and can't stop.
I'm mentally and physically addicted (some people dispute this, but it
is true, I'm a perfect example)

Yeah I manage to work a normal job, live a normal life and let no one
know that I'm tripping. Hiding it completely. But I'm so far away from
myself I'm nearly dead.

Although this post sounds very pro drug, please realize that dxm isn't
safe, it's an extremely powerfull drug and isn't for everyone, if you
are enzyme deficient it can be a terrible trip. If you choose to
experiement I suggest finding the dxm faq written by William White.

BTW powder is legal (and cheap at fifty cents for 500mg, A pretty deep
trips worth) and you really don't need to find a supplier. 100gram
bottles aren't hard to come by. Please don't be stupid like all the
people that kill themselves by not buying a $19 scale.

How could anyone dis Moby?  Well, because his current music is horrible, and

mean criticizing the music he makes now is anathema.

Spirit of Raving Question: How do you define Community?

IAHO: It's etymological. The origin of the word "community" comes from the 
Latin munus, which means the gift, and cum, which means together, among 
each other. So community literally means to give among each other.

Community can be defined as a group of people who welcome and honor 
gifts, and from those of whom give gifts to one another as well.

Subject: Re: [sfraves]was Moby gets skewered. (Now public apology)

Heh....  I've actually accidently robo-tripped before.

I used to have the habit of detesting being sick so incredibly much 
that I'd naively assault my body with every cold remedy known to man in 
order to try to drown out the symptoms.  About the only thing I hated 
more than being sick was wasting a sick day on being sick.  This led to 
some rather extreme foolishness in cold-vanquishing cocktails.

My preferred mixture used to start with a dose/glass of alka-seltzer 
cold relief.  Then I'd toss in a dose of ny-quill and a dose of 
robotussin.... the CF kind with everything under the sun in it.  If I 
was feeling particularly bad, or was already addle-minded from being 
sick, I'd wind up using the ny-quill cup to measure the robo.... which 
comes out to something like four times the proper dose.  Take all that, 
add a feverishly sick condition, and allow that I hadn't eaten because 
being sick kills my appetite, and you get an intense, but unintentional 
DXM trip.... right before passing out for twelve hours.  In retrospect, 
that probably tore  my immune system to shreds, which would keep me 
sicker, longer.

On the plus side, it blew anything even remotely resembling phlegm or 
mucous right out of my system, brought down my fever, and BOY did I 
ever sleep soundly!

Oh, but did I mention how much I hated taking sick days?  Well, on days 
I had to work, I'd chase all of the above down with 4-8 shots of 
espresso and a couple of Red Bulls; so as to stay awake and at the 
computer.  In retrospect, this was probably even worse for my immune 
system; and I doubt that I was very productive in that state.

But who cared?  We were all owned tens of thousands of shares/options!  
If we all worked crazy hours, and didn't ever let anything stupid like 
a mere cold slow us down, we'd be rich come IPO time!  And then we'd 
all retire, by thirty, to some beach in Thailand!  Oh... wait...

Now that I'm older, and hopefully a little bit wiser, I barely use cold 
medicines at all.  And when I do, I usually eschew the "all-in-one" 
solutions, and try to take just barely enough of the one chemical I 
need to relieve the worst symptoms.  Though I do make an exception, 
still, for ny-quill if I have a hard-core "keep me up at night" kind of 
sick

So, so more robo-rolls, accidental or otherwise, for me.


cya,
john
