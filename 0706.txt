Subject: Re: [sfraves] Massive or Underground

I dunno...  I have personally never been fucked with at a party,  
large or small.  But after the last time I went to a party at the  
crackhouse (And I freely stipulate that going to that one was a  
mistake.) I've pretty much been through with skeezy oakland venues,  
and all the risks that side of the bridge entails.  Basically, the  
local lowlifes decided to raid the party, steal the cashbox, and  
shoot up the place on their way out.  Fortunately, no one was hurt.   
And on our way out, the line of broken-into-cars stopped two places  
before my friend's who drove.

After that, we went back to the east bay for two parties; both at  
venues with secured, fenced-in, parking and nowhere near the  
crackhouse; haven't gone back since; and don't plan to.

Say what you want about overly candy, "fully permitted", commercial  
parties in San Francisco like Lift 2, where I went last weekend.   
Sure, it was a 2500-person "mini-massive".  But by having it at that  
venue, the promoter made sure that I could park my car somewhere  
safe, where I could be sure it'd be there and unmolested when I got  
back to it at the end of the night; and where the locals aren't a  
bunch of thugs who are going to shoot at people.  Bill Graham  
parties?  I can take MUNI there and back and never have to worry.   
The Regency?  I park across the street from the Japanese-old-folks- 
home a few blocks over.

At the crackhouse?! @_@ Wow, I didn't hear about that -- been in Asia for
the past 4 years so I'm pretty behind in the times. I'm glad to hear nobody
was hurt... I went to a party there back in 2001, but I can fully imagine
that happening. :( Must have been scary, your friend got pretty lucky to
have been bypassed by the car thieves!

On a similar note, back in 2002 or 2003, I attended an UG in Oakland and the
party ended prematurely around 3am when a few thugs decided to slug it out
in the middle of the dancefloor -- then after getting kicked out them and
their posse started banging loudly on the warehouse walls... An isolated
incident.

Party poopers -- meh! >_>;

peace,
Chris

Fairfield is where the Jelly Belly factory is.  Other than that, it's  
one of those places on the 80 between the Bay Area and Sacramento  
that you'll miss entirely if you blink too long.

CONGA SQUAD aka C-MOS (Holographic Music, Belgium)
Known to many as Conga Squad, Olivier Abbeloos also produces under names 
such as C-Mos,
Goldbumpers, Dynetic, Bio-nic, Inferno, Quadrophonia, T99, and Kretek. Over 
the past 15
years, this Disco House master has developed a signature sound that is like 
no other in
House music. His style of pumpin, steppy, driving Disco House has made 
Olivier a huge
success with many of the most influential DJ's from around the world. Not 
only a successful
music producer, Mr. Abbeloos is also a successful DJ with over 18 years of 
experience.
Olivier Abbeloos performs all over the world, and has several residencies in 
his home
country of Belgium including La Rocca. Abbeloos is also the founder &

HIGH CALIBER aka BRYAN JONES & MIKE GILLENWATER (Nocturnal / Olive / Moody /

Wrapping up his international Step Back 2007 Tour, DJ Bryan Jones joins Mike 
Gillenwater as
High Caliber, originally formed in late 2002. Both artists hail from Chicago 
where they’ve
independently established themselves as icons in the Funky House scene. Five 
years and
nearly 20 chart-busting EPs later, High Caliber is releasing their biggest 
project to date:
“Old School Sessions,” a four-part all-digital mix series that was too long 
to condense into
one album. Catch tracks from this new groundbreaking series along with other 
HC classics for
a floor-rocking experience San Francisco will surely not forget!

“WTF are CaliGrown Events?”

We’re a spin-off of a former Central Valley UG rave crew called Elysium from 
the
late 90’s - early 00’s. Elysium produced several events in the Central 
Valley, and
some in the Bay Area including a residence at the now infamous Hotel Ibiza 
in
2001. CaliGrown is based out of San Jose. We produce events out of love for 
the
music and the vibe its followers carry.

Bassdrop
Thursday, June 14th, 2007
@ Shine (1337 Mission st)
9pm-2am
FREE!!!
21+

It's our 3rd Bassdrop and once again we've got another WICKED UK
headliner. You really don't want to sleep on this one, cause it's goin
to be a bangin night.


Stabilizer
(Plastic Raygun/Boombox/Functional Breaks/Lithium Music)

As a producer Stabilizer has earned many supporters in the breaks
fraternity and beyond. A series of singles and remixes over the past
three years, on labels such as Boombox Records, Kosmo and Functional
Breaks, have gained the support of Andy Weatherall, Boy George, Annie
Nightingale (Radio 1), Hybrid, Krafty Kuts, Scanty Sandwich,
Scissorkicks, Anthony Pappa and Caspar Kedros (Headrillaz) among
others.

Stabilizer is now signed to the mighty Plastic Raygun and the first
single release, What It Takes rose to Number 5 in the DJ Mag breaks
chart as well as being described as "A Classic" by none other than
Andy Weatherall.

As well as the production, Stabilizer can be found despoiling the
world=D5s ears in a breakbeat and punky house fashion in places as
diverse as Bath, Bognor and Berlin, with a US tour planned.

Armed with a bag of records and a sampler - with an emphasis firmly on
good tunes and a good time - the Stabilizer DJ style is tight, varied
and always full of energy. With genres ranging from Hip Hip and Funk
via punky house all the way to the freshest nu-school breaks cuts.
Only two rules... it's got to be good, and it's got to be funky.


Along with:
DJ Unagi (Word of Mouth) - Special birthday set
M.O.D. (Evil Breaks)
Athena (Evil Breaks)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Anything good going on 6/2/07???

there's a great day party in oakland on Sunday.

SPRING TRAINING
Sunday, June 3rd
Woodminster Falls @ Joaquin Miller Park, Oakland
Noon-8p
Free

False Profit and Rhythm Society are putting on a day party on Sunday
June 3rd in Joaquin Miller Park which is in the Oakland Hills.
Specifically, in front of the waterfalls and pools near Woodminster
Ampitheater . We did this party last year under the name Springfest,
but will likely have a new name. It's an amazing space and rather
unique. Stephen, Brendan, myself and a few others are organizing.


Oakland, CA - Gorgeous Joaquin Miller Park will play host to this
year's Spring Training, a free "Summer Campouts for Dummies" prep
course offered to all investors of False Profit, LLC featuring...

Adam Ohana (Get Freaky) vs Laura (El Circo)
benchun (False Profit) vs Dr. Toast (False Profit)
Alxndr (DownLow, False Profit)
Neptune (Beatchurch)
EPROM (Nexus)
obi-J (False Profit)
Genji (Word of Mouth)

With the summer promising prolonged exposure to the elements and to
wide-ranging frequencies at high volumes, we want our investors to be
prepared.

Like any campout, you will need:

* Food and beverage provisions (to prevent starvation and/or dehydration)
* Sunscreen (to prevent sunburn and/or incineration by solar flares)
* Sunglasses (to prevent retinal damage due to UV rays and/or old age)
* Blankets (to prevent grass stains and/or allergic reactions to the plantlife)

This free offer expires on June 4th.

Remember...practice makes perfect.

[  K  O  N  T  R  O  L  ]

TWO YEAR ANNIVERSARY

Two years in, and what better reason to celebrate than the
fact that techno is alive and well in San Francisco!  On this
momentous occasion, we couldn't be more thrilled to present
to you one of the most legendary figures in modern dance
music delivering a soul-shaking *3 HOUR SET*!


BABY FORD  ( Perlon . Trelik . Ifach . Klang Elektronik : UK )


Peter "Baby" Ford is, quite literally, one of the founders of
the UK's acid-house scene.  After experiencing global
success as a club music pioneer in the early 90's, he took
an unexpected turn towards more experimental and
minimalistic sounds.  Rather than becoming a footnote in
dance music history, nearly 20 years later he's still pushing
boundaries; still at the top of his game.

A few of us were fortunate enough to catch his fantastic
set at last weekend's Detroit Electronic Music Festival, and
rest assured...we're all in for an unforgettable night!


with resident DJs and their special guests:

Sammy D + DJ Wrong?
Craig Kuna + Sasha Braverman
Alland Byallo + Kelley B.
Nikola Baytala + Miles Egner


* We are sad to report that due to a family emergency,
Thomas Franzmann (aka Zip) was unable to make it to the
United States at this time.  We look forward to hosting
him on a future occasion and wish him and his family the best!

BABY FORD

Baby Ford aka Peter Ford is one of the most recognizable names in current
dancefloor techno and was one of the founders of the U.K. acid house scene.

He's released records under a slew of pseudonyms, including Casino Classix,
El Mal, Solcyc and his most frequent, Baby Ford. His early work -- heavily
influenced by the late-'80s acid house sound, as well as Chicago producers
such as Marshall Jefferson, Ron Trent, Armando, and Larry Heard -- appeared
primarily through the Rhythm King label, and included classic cuts such as
"Oochy Koochy", "Children of the Revolution", and "Fetish".

Material has also appeared on Sire, Source, and Insumision/Transglobal. He's
released four full-length albums to date, including the debut Fordtrax (a
staple of most techno DJs) and 1997's Headphone Easyrider, one of his more
listener-friendly albums. His recent work has appeared mostly through Trelik
and Ifach, two of the U.K.'s most highly regarded experimental techno
labels, and both of which Ford has a hand in managing (Trelik together with
Eon's Ian Loveday; Ifach with Mark Broom).

He's also collaborating with Thomas Melchior as Soul Capsule and as
Sunpeople they released together the track "Check Your Buddha". With Ian
Loveday he collaborated on a number of projects (including Minimal Man),
both for Trelik. Less active as a remixer, Ford has reconfigured tracks for
Stefan Robbers' Florence project and pop techno group S'Express, among
others.

there's a great day party in oakland on Sunday.

SPRING TRAINING
Sunday, June 3rd
Woodminster Falls @ Joaquin Miller Park, Oakland
Noon-8p
Free

False Profit and Rhythm Society are putting on a day party on Sunday
June 3rd in Joaquin Miller Park which is in the Oakland Hills.
Specifically, in front of the waterfalls and pools near Woodminster
Ampitheater . We did this party last year under the name Springfest,
but will likely have a new name. It's an amazing space and rather
unique. Stephen, Brendan, myself and a few others are organizing.


Oakland, CA - Gorgeous Joaquin Miller Park will play host to this
year's Spring Training, a free "Summer Campouts for Dummies" prep
course offered to all investors of False Profit, LLC featuring...

Adam Ohana (Get Freaky) vs Laura (El Circo)
benchun (False Profit) vs Dr. Toast (False Profit)
Alxndr (DownLow, False Profit)
Neptune (Beatchurch)
EPROM (Nexus)
obi-J (False Profit)
Genji (Word of Mouth)

With the summer promising prolonged exposure to the elements and to
wide-ranging frequencies at high volumes, we want our investors to be
prepared.

Like any campout, you will need:

* Food and beverage provisions (to prevent starvation and/or dehydration)
* Sunscreen (to prevent sunburn and/or incineration by solar flares)
* Sunglasses (to prevent retinal damage due to UV rays and/or old age)
* Blankets (to prevent grass stains and/or allergic reactions to the plantlife)

This free offer expires on June 4th.

Remember...practice makes perfect.

fyi - Zip had a family emergency this week and will be
unable to play.  :( 

HOWEVER, Baby Ford is doing a 3-hour set, which should
make up for it.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Anything good going on 6/2/07???

"hella young candy kids" have there place, it's a
change of scenary from the sf club scene 

for saturday -
 i think i'm going to end up (yes it's a cliche)
but who can beat minimal all night without having to
change spots into sunrise. 

This sentiment could be because end up is in walking
distance 

and a lot of the philosophy of minimal is that creates
the vibe more so then weather it is "underground or
massive"

real good techno / minimal, to me, transforms the
failures of the promoter. One of the best examples of
this i experienced at fat city when Fumiya Tanaka -
the venue was illing my trip, bad. I was thinking
about leaving beforre Tanaka even started playing, the
rercords shifts of the warm-up djs accidently clanged
a few times, and my over-critical state began just to
hear clanging techno (auditory death).

then Tanaka came on and cleared the dance floor.

many people left - for some reason, I stayed, srangely
interested - after an hour of dissonant noise-ish (idm
without the d) the set became dark and involved - i
was no longer at fat city, i was in the mental
interiors of Tanaka (much respect but the venue isn't
my cup of tea)

that what differentiates a resident dj from a
international dj is that a international dj should be
able to play any where. While a resident develops an
eviroment to it's maximum. i wouldn't say one is
better then the other, just international djs are more
well known. 

peace,

deanizen, mtm

Its from DJ Seven.... I almost guarantee it... Check
to see if his promo company or if he is playing at the
gig... He uses his list to get gigs, and since he is
so hated for spamming and scared of going to jail for
it, he now lets other people use his list
unwttingly.... Or so my attorney tells me.

Didn't see DJ Seven on lineup from the Atimatik spam, but it DID include 
DJ Mick (so maybe THEY'RE trading lists.)

Keep in mind, though, that the press, traditionally the press in  
America is usually about 2 to 3 to 5 years late in recognizing trends  
in American society, culture, fashion, business, technology, medicine,  
etc. For some reason, it seems to me, not seems to me, I've seen  
studies on this, the press is just late.

Just came back from a production meeting at the venue.

I'm really stoked on what Tony/Eyezmind has in store. I haven't seen one

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Bedrock Lable


Bedrock is the layer of earth under the milllions of
years of silt built up above it. In some places, the
bedrock has been smashed to the surface and is
actually visible. Some mountain ranges have been
formed when two segments of bedrock collide over
millions of years forcing one up, the other down, or
some combination of either.

I would hardly call a millions year earth movement
progressive.

On the surface one sees prosperity in the form of new cars and  
trucks, shiny buildings, good roads and busy stores. But underneath  
there is a rotten, futureless, disordered thing, mediated by  
intellectual imbecilities. As of this writing there is no armed  
rebellion, no world war to mark our place. All is relatively quiet in  
the West, for the work of maggots is not measured in decibels.    --

Subject: [sfraves] Subwoofers have way more bass than tops!

I duno if you guys have noticed but I went to this patry last night, and I wnt up to the sound system and i noticed thta the sub speekers (big cones in them) were the part that put ut all the bass- all the highs and shit were coming out of the top speaker part.

I am an old-skool raver but didn't notice that before- I figure the bigger the speaker, the hiher it went, but no- it's totally the oter way around!

BTW, creamy peanut butter is real yumy on wonder bread- especialy if you put it in the micro oven for 20 seconds.  Paese,

Im sorry but im really not trying to impress or prove anything to you. I dont even know you and am not really sure if i want to. If you read most of my post im not all that interested in even attending a "rave". I forgot about the kinda people that go to raves.. *sigh* No offence to the people with lives.

I remember when i was a little younger me and one of my older sisters friends were talking about Amp Tv the show that came on like 3 in the morning on mtv. And he started talking about hard trance and happy hardcore. He played some tribal techno tape from the "trance and jungle factory" (as it was once called) and he told me about how raves were these hole in the wall parties were people used methamphetamines. He talked about some dance where you hold and imaginary ball and move it around, it turned out to be what they call liquid today. He braged about how he was cool with some promoters and knew where all the tight underground parties were and yada yada. He said if i was really interested in checking the scene out that i might want to check hyperreal out. So i did and found out about sfraves after that. But the one thing that i remeber most is when he talked about djing. He said that its better to by one turntable and collect records as a hobby instead of trying to play
 at parties. But yea thats my experience so there you have it.

them. I know that when I was a young rabblerouser, I felt semi creeped out 
at times by the "old guy" at the show or event...I can imagine it can be the 
same for the youngins at the candy raves.

Are you fucking kidding me? Is this the "Clubbers Guide to Clubbing in 2001" 
or something?

I guess it goes without saying that if you are wanting some good progressive 
you should look at the entire Global Underground CD collection....

Now I'm curious.  What sort of people do you think go to raves?  

I really do want to know.  

Peace,

P.S. Its not "lable" its "label".  Spelling counts in the land of rave.

Apparently the people you are talking to don't know what they are talking about.  Try Google, you'll get better information.

And methamphetamines are really bad shit.  They will kill you.

I remember when i was a little younger me and one of my older sisters friends were talking about Amp Tv the show that came on like 3 in the morning on mtv. And he started talking about hard trance and happy hardcore. He played some tribal techno tape from the "trance and jungle factory" (as it was once called) and he told me about how raves were these hole in the wall parties were people used methamphetamines. He talked about some dance where you hold and imaginary ball and move it around, it turned out to be what they call liquid today. He braged about how he was cool with some promoters and knew where all the tight underground parties were and yada yada. He said if i was really interested in checking the scene out that i might want to check hyperreal out. So i did and found out about sfraves after that. But the one thing that i remeber most is when he talked about djing. He said that its better to by one turntable and collect records as a hobby instead of trying to play
at parties. But yea thats my experience so there you have it.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Anything good going on 6/2/07???

Hey I resemble that remark!  

Being a bit older than the list average, personally I always enjoy seeing people even older than me at events.  There's a number of older gentlemen that always go to Sunset parties for example.   And I also enjoy seeing younger people having fun at events too.

I recall one time seeing Mark Farina at Snowdrift...this was a sort of crappy party at a crappy venue filled with dot.com business development and sales types.  Bleh.

For whatever reason a small group of candy kids were there and they were out on the floor smiling and dancing.  This was a lot better than the "table and bottle" crowd that was filling the place so my wife and I gravitated towards them and were dancing with them for a while.  At one point this one big kid seemed very hot and sweaty and my wife got sort of worried about him.  So we bought them a couple of bottles of cold water.  There was no creep factor, there were smiles all around and we danced together for a while longer.  When the party ended the kids saw us in the coat check line and they were like "Hey! There's the people that bought us water! Hi! Thanks!"  Ok, it was a meaningless event in reality, but one full of meaning in the moment somehow.

I really do understand the "creep" thing, but personally I think there is great value in people of all different ages getting together and dancing.  This is something that pretty much every tribe on the planet knows, but which apparently we in the "modern" world seem to have forgotten.  We keep old people and young people apart as if by doing so we can prevent aging from entering our lives.  

Maybe if instead of thinking they are just creepy, if some of the younger folks talked to some of these older people you might find out they aren't cops, they aren't scamming on underage raver chicks, maybe they just like techno or whatever.  I had some recent experiences with this at an underground that made me sort of sad actually. FWIW.  

Of course kids there are actually some creepy and bad people out there both young and old.  Be careful!

Anyway, I say there should be more old dudes and especially more old ladies at parties.  We'll all be there eventually, and there's no reason that old people should have to listen to shitty music or sit at home alone watching American Idol.  Remembering of course that in the rave scene anyone over 25 qualifies as old, aka geriatric, LOL

Regards,

Peter

I guess it goes without saying that if you are wanting some good progressive

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Critical Mass Bike Ride June 8th; Int'l Day of Action Against
 Climate Change & the G8

Int'l Day of Action/Solidarity with Germany Critical Mass Bike Ride
Against Climate Change & the G8.

A Better World is Possible! A Better US is Necessary! Flood the Streets
before the Sea Does!

5:30 Friday June 8, 2007
Justin Herman Plaza
(foot of Market St./Emarcadero BART)
5:30: Gather and Bike Decorating, 6pm Ride

Use pedal power to challenge oil addiction, to show solidarity with
anti-G8 mass mobilizations in Germany and resist the polluting economic
and political system of the G8. As the megalomaniac G8 leaders meet in
police-state Germany, behind fences, cops and soldiers, intent on
leading us further towards catastrophic and irreversible climate chaos,
we must shout, scream and roar 'no more'. Take action to challenge the
fossil fuelled madness of the G8 governments and their oil addicted
corporate buddies. Actions targeting the root causes of climate change
are planned in other G8 countries and around the world on this day.

We know the terrifying statistics: a million species extinct by 2050, 19
of the 20 hottest years on record since 1980, Greenland and Antarctica
melting, droughts, floods, famines ... the G8 have met for over 30 years
to further a global system that is destroying our planet and our future
while they line their pockets, and at the same time stage fake public
relations promises to confuse us. This global system is at the root of
our ecological and social problems; lack of heath care, housing and
education, war, more prisons, the rich getting richer, low wages and
lousy jobs, pollution, and attacks on immigrant, worker and civil
rights. Meanwhile, island countries disappear and hundreds of thousands
die as a result of the freak weather conditions caused by their
irrational and uncontrollable obsession with never ending economic
growth.

June 8 International Day of Action Against Climate Change and the G8 has
been called by the International Rising Tide Network.

Nobody on this list has iPods, we all have sex slaves that travel  
behind us playing our choice of music through elephant tusks that  
angle towards our ears.
When they play something not to our liking, we flog them with seaweed  
and those weird brown pod things.
The welts remind them that-

Err I mean- I steal iPods out of cars as a hobby and have ~90 of  
them- what flavor you looking for?
Also- you want some xtacy????
Or some blow?
Or some yank?
Or some fuss?
Or some spin?

You just make a lot of posts with information that everyone on this list already knows, or with questions that don't really matter.  "The point of a question is to obtain information that you care about."  Do you really care which of these people you don't know owns an iPod?  Maybe you do, but it seems like such a trivial thing to bring up.

I actually enjoy reading some of your posts, but some are just an open invitation to be an asshole to you.

If I still owned an iPod, it would have the Ferry Corsten song "Loud, Electrically Ferocious" on it.

What i was going to ask was what do most of you put on your iPods. Not everybody has an iPod. I go to progressive-sounds.com to get most of my artists to put on it. I know there are some die hard ravers but do you like the music enough to listen to it on your iPod everyday?
  I just joined the list and people expect me to already know whast in your heads and what you already know. Im just not really feelin the rave shiit no more. I guess I'm growing out of it. The music sounds coo but im realising it just isnt the crowd i want to be in and its not the scene for me.

I'd venture to say that nearly everyone on this list listens to some form of electronic music daily.  And that you're not part of a scene to be part of a scene.  You're part of a scene because it meets the criteria of what you enjoy.  I enjoy going out, and I enjoy the music.  If that's not you, best of luck finding what you enjoy.

Or we could bludgeon each other with baseball bats...

Or we could shoot each other with guns...

Or we could deploy stealth bombers loaded with precision guided munitions to destroy each other's homes...

Or we could launch nuclear first strikes...

OR, we could do none of the above and actually try to make the world a little bit better place today.  We could try to understand our anger and redirect it towards postive ends in its true nature as discriminating wisdom.

How about riding in CM and not smashing anyone's windshield?  How about driving your car only when you need to, going under the speed limit while carefully avoiding bicylists, and letting the other guy at the intersection go first?  

How about setting aside anger, hate, and fear for just one day?  

I dare you to do it.

Peace,

Peter

Subject: Re: [sfraves] iPod

No one is selling rave here.   
 
This is not a cult, and it is not a religion.  We are not trying to convert you.
 
This is not an exclusive country club where only a member's referral can get you in. 
 
Do you think its important to anyone besides yourself what "crowd" you do or do not "want to be in"?  
 
What about being in a crowd of one and at the same time being connected to everyone and everything?
 
Chris, to be blunt, everything you've expressed in this email is the opposite of what raving is all about.
 
And if you aren't feeling it, why are you here?  There is no status to be gained here and there are no prizes awarded.
 
Some advice:  be true to yourself and the rest will follow.
 
Peace,
 
Peter

What i was going to ask was what do most of you put on your iPods. Not everybody has an iPod. I go to progressive-sounds.com to get most of my artists to put on it. I know there are some die hard ravers but do you like the music enough to listen to it on your iPod everyday?
  I just joined the list and people expect me to already know whast in your heads and what you already know. Im just not really feelin the rave shiit no more. I guess I'm growing out of it. The music sounds coo but im realising it just isnt the crowd i want to be in and its not the scene for me.

Maybe you do, but it seems like such a trivial thing to bring up.

I actually enjoy reading some of your posts, but some are just an open invitation to be an asshole to you.

If I still owned an iPod, it would have the Ferry Corsten song "Loud, Electrically Ferocious" on it.

Anyone speak Norweigan on the list?

I was especially amused by some of the words.  And bathroom in all the  
european languages is all the same pretty much.  It's either toilette,  
toalety, toolett, you get the picture.

Hey the Norweigan furniture stores are a whole lot nicer than  
Scandinavian Designs.  Been there.  Done that.

Not sure when you joined the list or how long you watched the posts prior to
posting yourself, but please see below link to etiquette
http://hyperreal.org/raves/sf/doc/sfrFAQ.html from the hyperreal website.

The seventh star down reads:
* Normal etiquette is to wait around 2 weeks or more before you start
posting anything; that ensures that you don't tread on old ground and
that you have a reasonably good idea of the mindset of the list.

Thanks.

Who was playing at GGL?  

And how was Hawtin?  There was some discussion before the show about his last time here in SF being boring or too minimal.

in the past two weeks, i hit up GGL at Terra and Hawtin at Mighty.

GGL was a bit lackluster in attendance.  Hawtin was packed to the gills.

Cut Chemist @ 1015 was OFF THE FUCKING CHAIN!!!! He was rocking 2 separate 
set-ups. 2 CDJ's & a mixer and 2 Tech's & a mixer - jumping back and forth 
between both setups and just rockin' the main room like mad. Rogue Element & 
Bassnectar's sets were pretty dope as well, but Cut Chemist was simply FUN 
FUN FUN!

Wen to the Acid Totem full moon the next night, and didn't get to stay long, 
but Kris Kent's set was off the heezy...plus the location was sweet as hell.

Good times.

This is basically my way of operating.  But it can be pretty difficult 
not getting into the finger pointing game when there's such high stakes 
involved.  (I've been hit by a car at highway speeds, so I know.)

Hello all,

Much love to the few of you who remember me...

I am going to be working in Manchester for the week of
June 17 - my company is putting me up in the Hilton
Manchester Deansgate (big ass fuckn tower, woohoo!).

Anyway, any suggestions on dnb or downtempo lounges,
bars, or anything?

any suggestions on anything else that I can do??

Thanks all.

Subject: [sfraves]MANCHESTER DnB Lounges??

Hello All,

Long time no see (to the few of those who remember
me).

I am going to Manchester, UK for work and they are
putting me up in the Hilton Manchester Deansgate (big
ass fuckn tower, woohoo!).

Anyway, while I am there, I would love to hit up a
lounge that spins some dope DnB or Downtempo type
beats.

Any suggestions?  Anything else that I should do while
in Manchester?

thanks all

A while back I was going to head to Manchester for a job interview and I found this web page: http://www.manchesterad.com/  

The job opportunity died and I never went to the UK, so I can't offer any personal recommendations.  

Have fun!

I tried to be nice to him.  He seemed to be really offended by being told why people were being mean to him.

Subject: [sfraves] looking for a track

i'm looking for a copy of Nu Jack (Adrenalin Records) by Cotton Club.  
(NOT the Y2k remixes):

   http://www.discogs.com/release/127956

do you have this?  i would lurve to get a high-quality WAV recording  
of it, please. really, just one of the tracks - i think it's the  
Original Mix, with the super-PLUR bleepy bloopy hands-in-the-air 6 am  
epic breakdown. yeah, i actually play that shit. :-)

i had the vinyl and it went missing.  the sleeve is still in my stack  
of records, but no vinyl.  i miss it, and want to use it in an  
upcoming set.

a long shot?  we'll see. help a brotha out.

-philip-

ps> no copies for sale on GEMM. i checked.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] party reviews?

I found magda to be the real high light of the night.

hawtin spun a pretty amazing set - very much what I
expected from him. He played that record with the
creepy guy trying to give the kid that took too many
pills a back rub ("Yeaaaaa") 3 times and kept remixing
it. He spun some crazy wattery frequencies which made
my ears pop. But he ended at on a real high point (@
about 4am), I felt like i was just getting in to his
set when he finsihed.

Magda really developed her set and came to more of a
natural finsih. Her records choice seemed to draw on
some of the more groove based production and kept a
danceable vibe hightened by her minimal selection, as
aposed to clearly the dance floor. (I had really
wished troy pierce, minus label mate, had played with
them, but I felt Magda represeneted the sound I
commonly associate to him)

Mighty did a nice job at hosting the event - the bass
was a lil muddy and highs a bit intense. However I
really apreciate the energy at mighty of the staff - a
lot of ppl whrere saying how the event should have
happend at mezzanine since the venue is bigger - but
i've always found that venue to be tad bit impersonal.
Which would really hurt the experience of seeing
hawtin since he seems to react so strongly to the vibe
of the event.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] looking for a track

Can't find the MP3 on BeatPort, Trackitdown, Release Records, or 
DJDownload....you may wanna jump on a P2P and try your luck there....

Most folks I know woulda rocked the Y2K version, so it may be really hard 
finding a '97 Adrenalin release.

That being said, this CD MAY be unmixed and has it:

http://cgi.ebay.com/Sex-Sins-And-Samples-The-Cotton-Club-CD-1997_W0QQitemZ160116639796QQihZ006QQcategoryZ307QQrdZ1QQssPageNameZWD1VQQcmdZViewItem

or this vinyl:

Hawtin blew the place apart.  Mighty did a good job, I thought, the place
was packed and it took a while to get drinks but I honestly didn't care, I
was having too good a time.  I liked Magda's set a lot, it was grooving
enough to keep me dancing but still had a minimal taste and didn't steal any
of Hawtin's thunder.  Hawtin just straight destroyed the place, damn that
man can play when he wants to!

The only thing I would have changed is that I personally would have booked
Hawtin until at least 8am, if not longer, instead of just to 4am.  I can
only imagine the insanity of a night like that...

ah - that's a new one by me. didn't know you could do that with discogs.

still, it's not in the for-sale list.  Marco spotted the CD release on 
ebay (for about $4 incl. shipping), so i bought it. i >think< the

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Had fun

Actually several of us tried to be nice to him and I personally wrote him email off list. However, the truth is that "Chris" wasn't what he pretended to be on this list.  Chris is a troll and most likely a sock puppet for an existing member of the list.  To see why I think that, follow along with CHris' brief history here on sfraves...

In his very first email to the list on May 17th Chris writes "I've been into electronica since the amp tv days.. Im also trying to learn about the latest djs artists and labels.. I like djs like mark farina ltj bukem and paul van dyk.. maybe somebody can tell me about more artists.. I think im a cool guy to talk to so if anyone wants to respond just send me an email.. "

Then five hours later after receiving a warm welcome from Marc(o) he writes "I read the rave faq and they were talking about a new style of a electronica called progressive..  Im interested in checking it out and giving it a chance.. Does anyone on the list know about the genre or have any insite into this style of music? I called skills dj workshop and they said the first place to start is to look up djs like Tiesto, Armin Van Burren, and Paul Van Dyk.. What kind of parties play this kind of style.."

And then the same day he also writes "Whats the difference between prog trance and prog house? Where do djs like sasha, dubfire, and digweed spin at?"

Marc(o), myself, and several others wrote him nice enough notes suggesting progressive artists and parties and explaing the differnce between progressive house and trance.  Chris didn't respond.
 
On May 18th he writes "What makes the rave culture what it is today?"  Which I personally answer at some length incluing a number of links and historical references.  Chris responded to me privately off list saying "So it really began as an outlet for the gay community?"  When I responded to him off list to clarfiy his partial misunderstanding of this point, he didn't answer.

On May 25th Chris writes "Is CoCo still on the list? This is one of her old friends.." 
 
On May 27th Chris writes, "I wonder if the same people that think progressive trance is cheesy think raves are cheesy in general. when i play an assortment of genres the only music that reminds me of that rave vibe is that so called cheesy music. In the right place under the right circumstance that shit goes hard. "

But then on May 30th he states. "Is there really a big difference between massives and ug parties? To all those party goers what has been your experience? I used to think undergrounds were the thing to go to but now im starting to think massives might be a little safer."

So while Chris has never been to a massive and doesn't know whether undergrounds are safe, he knows an old time sfraver CoCo and he knows that "under the right circumstance that shit goes hard."

Then on the 31st he writes "How do you the people on the sfraves list feel about the whole glowstick dancing. For me I really see it as a form of dancing and expressing one self. I know some people associate it with ecstacy and visuals but i see it for more then that. For some its might be hard to dance to these rythms. But with glowsticking its more of a abstract way of dancing to the music."

He's never been to a massive, he's unclear on the safety of undergrounds, but he's an expert on the art of glowsticking?

On June 2nd he writes "Ive found that if your looking for some good progressive bedrock would be a good place to start looking."  But he doesn't know where to get any records apparently.

Will Penna correctly points out, "C'mon, even this newbie, cop, or whatever he is, can Google bedrock + rave ...just SEE what comes up! I did, and wasn't surprised....  "  to which Chris responds, "Im sorry but im really not trying to impress or prove anything to you. I dont even know you and am not really sure if i want to. If you read most of my post im not all that interested in even attending a 'rave'. I forgot about the kinda people that go to raves.. *sigh* No offence to the people with lives."

So he's never even benn to a rave apparently.

Yesterday, less than three weeks after joining the list he asks "I was wondering who on here had iPods?"

And then later the same day writes "What i was going to ask was what do most of you put on your iPods. Not everybody has an iPod. I go to progressive-sounds.com to get most of my artists to put on it. I know there are some die hard ravers but do you like the music enough to listen to it on your iPod everyday?"

So now he not only knows what progressive music is, he knows exactly where to get it?  Right.

And of course finally we have a dramatic exit in the email entitled "Had fun"

Chris = TROLL and he's almost certainly someone already on the list under another name.  

Regards,

Peter

I tried to be nice to him.  He seemed to be really offended by being told why people were being mean to him.

I also e-mailed him privately with links to some progressive
mixes with no response.

One thing tho - he did get the list a little more active.  :)


Speaking of which, I hear that Apollo is doing better.  He's
awake and (for the most part) aware of his surroundings.  He's
still in the hospital tho.

Please continue to send your e-mails and well-wishes to him
(via Joey) at eagleqr@sepakeasy.org.

Thanks!
Michael

If I could open my arms
And span the length of the isle of Manhattan,
I'd bring it to where you are
Making a lake of the East River and Hudson
If I could open my mouth
Wide enough for a marching band to march out
They would make your name sing
And bend through alleys and bounce off all the buildings.

I wish we could open our eyes
To see in all directions at the same time
Oh what a beautiful view
If you were never aware of what was around you
And it is true what you said
That I live like a hermit in my own head
But when the sun shines again
I'll pull the curtains and blinds to let the light in.

Sorrow drips into your heart through a pinhole
Just like a faucet that leaks and there is comfort in the sound
But while you debate half empty or half full
It slowly rises, your love is gonna drown [4x]

Your love is gonna drown [4x]
Your love is gonna...

Subject: [sfraves] cop paranoia

wtf?

first of all, that's crazy. occam's razor. you don't need cops posing
as idiots on the internet to explain the phenomenon of people
appearing to be idiots on the internet. there is a much simpler
explanation which will get the job done.

second of all, you gotta think big. why imagine cops snooping on SFR
when you can entertain delusions of the CIA bugging your apartment?

"Make no little plans. They have no magic to stir men's blood and
probably themselves will not be realized. Make big plans; aim high in
hope and work, remembering that a noble, logical diagram once recorded
will never die, but long after we are gone will be a living thing,
asserting itself with ever-growing insistency. Remember that our sons
and grandsons are going to do things that would stagger us. Let your
watchword be order and your beacon beauty. Think big."

- Daniel Burnham, Chicago architect. (1864-1912)

btw I am back in the Bay, adding my genetic and cultural uniqueness to
that of a local corporate megadroid's legion of monkey butlers. I wish
I could contribute my daily quota of inspired madness and deranged
verbiage, but I've had to trim my verbiage as it got too fuzzy. maybe
that's too much information. anyway, thought I'd say hi, in a Geri
Dahl kind of way.

by the way, speaking of Geri Dahl, I heard a rumor that she was a sex
worker, and I am in fact desperately in need of sex workers, but I
only want brilliant people who work for their passion, not for money,
so I am only offering equity. if you are a highly qualified "rockstar"
sex worker, or a team of highly qualified "rockstar" sex workers, and
you are interested in working for equity ONLY, please contact
jobs@gilesgoatboy.org. Thank you.

I also e-mailed him privately with links to some progressive
mixes with no response.

One thing tho - he did get the list a little more active.  :)


Speaking of which, I hear that Apollo is doing better.  He's
awake and (for the most part) aware of his surroundings.  He's
still in the hospital tho.

Please continue to send your e-mails and well-wishes to him
(via Joey) at eagleqr@sepakeasy.org.

Thanks!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] cop paranoia

You're right, human idiocy is very easily explained.  It's due to cat parasites:
 http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2006-08/uoc--cpm080206.php
 
 Anyhow...you might still need to worry about who's bugging your phone, so just in case:
http://lauren.vortex.com/archive/000202.html
http://www.pimall.com/nais/countertelco.html
 
Bizzarely my home telephone randomly switched on in speaker phone last night with an open, but silent line.  Hmm...
 
Bullshit aside, I'm actually really interested in this little problem of creating provably safe email distribution lists, secure P2P networks, and so forth using public key encryption and some other related techniques.  I've been futzing around with some ideas for about a year now related to development of so called "trust" relationships between computer systems that I think is relevant here.
 
Imagine you could hand someone a party invitation with a number (or maybe a bar code) on the back.  The number is an encrypted phone number, URL, or "WiFi" map point location.  Only those that have the key can decrypt the location, URL, or phone number and find the party.  Furthermore I can also ensure that only the person I give the invitation to can decrypt it, and I can trace compromised invitations back to their distributers and authorized holders.   Perhaps this would all be accomplished via some software downloaded onto your computer, phone or PDA instead of with physical invitations.
 
If you are a math, software, or crypto type, consider these papers to get an idea of some of what I am thinking about:  
 
http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/balfanz03secret.html
http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/balfanz02talking.html
http://paginas.terra.com.br/informatica/paulobarreto/pblounge.html#Introduction
 
Some of this gets pretty deep and is beyond my personal expertise FWIW.  
 
And of course this is all purely an academic exercise...
 
Peace,
 
Peter

Subject: [sfraves] cop paranoia


wtf?

first of all, that's crazy. occam's razor. you don't need cops posing
as idiots on the internet to explain the phenomenon of people
appearing to be idiots on the internet. there is a much simpler
explanation which will get the job done.

second of all, you gotta think big. why imagine cops snooping on SFR
when you can entertain delusions of the CIA bugging your apartment?

"Make no little plans. They have no magic to stir men's blood and
probably themselves will not be realized. Make big plans; aim high in
hope and work, remembering that a noble, logical diagram once recorded
will never die, but long after we are gone will be a living thing,
asserting itself with ever-growing insistency. Remember that our sons
and grandsons are going to do things that would stagger us. Let your
watchword be order and your beacon beauty. Think big."

- Daniel Burnham, Chicago architect. (1864-1912)

btw I am back in the Bay, adding my genetic and cultural uniqueness to
that of a local corporate megadroid's legion of monkey butlers. I wish
I could contribute my daily quota of inspired madness and deranged
verbiage, but I've had to trim my verbiage as it got too fuzzy. maybe
that's too much information. anyway, thought I'd say hi, in a Geri
Dahl kind of way.

by the way, speaking of Geri Dahl, I heard a rumor that she was a sex
worker, and I am in fact desperately in need of sex workers, but I
only want brilliant people who work for their passion, not for money,
so I am only offering equity. if you are a highly qualified "rockstar"
sex worker, or a team of highly qualified "rockstar" sex workers, and
you are interested in working for equity ONLY, please contact
jobs@gilesgoatboy.org. Thank you.

He's chattering up a storm.  Non stop for two hours. :)

I also e-mailed him privately with links to some progressive
mixes with no response.

One thing tho - he did get the list a little more active.  :)


Speaking of which, I hear that Apollo is doing better.  He's
awake and (for the most part) aware of his surroundings.  He's
still in the hospital tho.

Please continue to send your e-mails and well-wishes to him
(via Joey) at eagleqr@sepakeasy.org.

Thanks!

I know the operations of this network because I have studied it for 20  
years and was permitted for 2 years in the early 1960's to examine its  
papers and secret records.  I have no aversion to it, or to most of  
its aims, and have for much of my life been close to it, and to many  
of its instruments.  In general, my chief difference of opinion is  
that it wishes to remain unknown.

if you've got iTunes, you should go into the "radio"
section and then look in "Electronic" look for a
station called "BassDrive" - i happen to be a big fan
of that station.  the benefit is that you'll see the
names of the artists and tracks in iTunes as the
tracks play.  that way you can figure out some artists
that you enjoy.

Greenland, the world's largest island, is mostly covered by an ice cap
of about 624,000 cubic miles that accounts for a 10th of all the fresh
water in the world.


^^ Isn't Australia the world's largest island? Stupid CNN.

Australia is considered a continent, not an island.

Also, nobody is disputing global warming, rather the debate is how much of

you'll prolly be sorry one day that you got this suggestion but there's
also

www.dogsonacid.com

just be forewarned, the loudest voices are blatantly rude and sarcastic so
you might want to lurk a little before jumping in.  ;-)

beneath the surface you *will* find some good, intelligent, knowledgeable,
nice peeps, too.  :)

respectfully,

I've always been amazed by the smug attitude of many psytrancers, a 
combination of claimed increased awareness and this air of "I've been 
there, you're not wearing any bright colors so I'll guess you haven't", in 
many cases an almost spiritual superiority complex.

Which if you think about it, if you're annoying to spirits here in the 
simple to connect material world, the ones you're connecting with 
otherwise are probably fuckheads too.  Extra bonus points for the folks 
I'd see walking around in full on psy-warrior regalia, holding a book 
about Hinduism, shirt with Ganesh on it, saying "boom shankar" regularly 
before every toke and holding up the pipe to their foreheads after they 
hit it, totally incapable of discussing even the most basic tenets of the 
faith.  Seems weird to me, if I went out proudly wearing a Cthulu codpiece 
and yelled "fnord" everytime I lit a cigarette, I'd expect and prepare for 
questions, ya know?

But yeah, I've had a disconnect with a lot of the local techno scene here 
in a similar way.  I've had out of town producers recognize me, go way 
back with a lot of the people who put SF on the map and all that, but some 
local club regulars seem to give me dirty looks when I show up to a club 
alone cause I'm outside the current clique or whatever.

Fortunately I'm conceited enough to see it as their loss.  :)

You could also see it like those old enough to be grandparents folks 
wearing Dokken shirts, the boys with their mullets and the girls with 
their feathered hair, calling each others posers.  You can love the music 
and not fall for the retarded social machines that people build around it.

Even if it is Dokken.

Hey don't talk shit about Dokken! Dokken is on a higher spiritual plain than you cou could ever perceive. Dokken helped me speak with the spirits. ;P

Even if it is Dokken.

yep... have an epson that was really cheap and works
quite well.... I actually suspect that most these days
that print to cd's will work well for runs of 25 or
less... maybe 50 or less. The ink and cd's start
geting more expensive than online printers at that
point.

E

PS.. I can model number you if you are interested....
just have to walk out to the studio.

Rohan on Geary is a great first date spot with tons of good veggie food that's fun to share.  Check that out for sure..

Movies, not so sure, but once it's all over, if she's game for a little adventure, definitely take her to the Wave Organ.  If she hasn't been there before, i think that will score some points.  If she's tough, you could go to the seward st. slides ;)

Fun shit!

Dude - just be yourself and work with what you've got. I think too many 
people put their "best face on" on a date, and don't really represent their 
true self (complete with wacky idiosynchrasies, etc.)

Don't go out of your way to impress - just make sure the young lady is comfy 
as hell, and make sure that wherever you go you can conversate. It's hard ot 
learn about someone at a movie theater, other than what sort of habits they 
have when at the movies.

For Veggie restaurants - well, I can't help, I eat animals whenever 
possible. I still have sharp teeth and (as previously mentioned) cows create 
the majority of global warming, so it's a moral imperative to help the 
environment by eating as many cows as you can.


HAVE FUN ON YOUR DATE!

I'm pretty sure I don't have trouble being authentic, but there is the 
matter of picking the feathers you fan your tail with.  For example, one 
of the things I've realized I really want to do someday is go primitive 
hunting (spear or bow), because eating meat and not being able to deal 
with killing an animal seem at odds to me.  But... not an ideal first 
date.

I love the word "conversate".

I've been assured it's not real:
http://www.wsu.edu/~brians/errors/conversate.html
http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=conversate

But it's neato and I actually like it when used casually (as you did).  I 
think it actually might have stemmed from a PIL song ("Careering" off 
their second album aka second edition aka metalbox) in the form 
"Conversating".

Which is funny, cause a few weeks ago I wrote a song that had the lyric 
"Conversate, while our food prepares", which someone told me reminded them 
of a Rapture song called "Echoes" which uses the word "Conversating".  I 
finally get around to listening to that song, and sure enough, it's almost 
a perfect rip of part of PIL's Careering.  But anyways...

-&e->HAVE FUN ON YOUR DATE!

Yeah, that's the point of the question.  Can't help who I am but maybe we 
could be in some pleasant surroundings reduce the shock a bit ;)

andyw

p.s.	if anybody wants to hear the song I wrote that I mentioned above 
it's the "autoplay" pick at http://myspace.com/thelagsf

p.p.s.	i really have to go start a blog.  the slightly baked + unemployed 
+ red bull + no warcraft thing is resulting in writing a lot.

  That sounds like fun. We should all take archery and horseback riding classes. We could all like go out into the mid west and hunt some buffalo with a bow and arrow and start a bon fire and gather around it while we roast the beast. we can set up some tables to or something............

you're asking the wrong guy.  i haven't been on a "date" in years.  :(

wear the leather or chrome codpiece.  save the leopard skin one for

PS.  "Once" has a 96% on Rottentomatoes, if you like Irish musicals.

I would really recomend a drum and bass group call e-z rollers for those that like that softer jazzy sound.

One and Only - by PFM

This is the track I have no defense against.  Just insanely 
chill-o-sex-o-matic.  Perhaps crude and repetitive by modern standards, 
still sends chills up my spine when it gets to that part of Logical 
Progression... which is strangely one of the oldest mixes/comps that has 
seldom been skipped from rotation in my work-time listening.

And um, yeah.  PFM, LTJ Bukem, Lamb, all that shibby is freaking gold 
every so often.  Used to do a weekly where it was all trip hop, ambient 
and dolphin jungle called slow roasted in santa clara.

And then there's the time I sprayed food all over my keyboard at work in 
a related inceident, from a simple captioned photo of LTJ Bukem & Conrad:

I love the word "conversate".

I've been assured it's not real:
http://www.wsu.edu/~brians/errors/conversate.html
http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=conversate

But it's neato and I actually like it when used casually (as you did).  I 
think it actually might have stemmed from a PIL song ("Careering" off 
their second album aka second edition aka metalbox) in the form 
"Conversating".

Which is funny, cause a few weeks ago I wrote a song that had the lyric 
"Conversate, while our food prepares", which someone told me reminded them 
of a Rapture song called "Echoes" which uses the word "Conversating".  I 
finally get around to listening to that song, and sure enough, it's almost 
a perfect rip of part of PIL's Careering.  But anyways...

Yeah, that's the point of the question.  Can't help who I am but maybe we 
could be in some pleasant surroundings reduce the shock a bit ;)

andyw

p.s.    if anybody wants to hear the song I wrote that I mentioned above 
it's the "autoplay" pick at http://myspace.com/thelagsf

p.p.s.    i really have to go start a blog.  the slightly baked + unemployed 
+ red bull + no warcraft thing is resulting in writing a lot.

STIMULUS at the Duplex w/ Brian Seed and a shit-ton of bitchin' locals!!!!

Friday, 6/8: STIMULUS: Excursions into Electrotech, feat. Brian Seed

Is it possible for the excesses of addiction to lend themselves to a 
positive and uplifting overstimulation of mind and body? If our past 
experiences with our own freaky electro-techy-housish musical addiction are 
any indication, the answer is a resounding, "hell mutha-fuckin'-YEAH!"

So once again, we're venturing on an excursion into electrotech, this time 
bringing one of our favorite purveyors of the sound - Brian Seed - up from 
LA to join a prime selection of local heroes, to present to you a night of 
relentless electrotech madness.

STIMULUS: Excursions into Electrotech

Featuring (in alphabetical order):

Brian Seed aka DJ Brian (Moontribe / Ritual Sounds - LA)
A Moontribe resident since '95, Brian Seed has cultured a globe-spanning 
following by spinning genre-defying sets, blending the sounds of breaks, 
acid house, trance, tribal, and progressive, exemplified by his legendary 
"Hardesertrance" releases. Currently, his sets consist of mainly his own 
material, much of which has been released on Fade, Virgin, Pacific Front, 
Desert Trax, Interscope, System, Moonshine, Six Degrees, Ball of Waxx, and 
his own label, Ritual Sounds.

...plus an all-star local lineup, including:

Dirt (Cymbalic / Omniscient Records - SF)
Evinrude (Stimulus / Space Cowboys / NetAmp - SF)
Little John (Raindance / Nexus - Santa Cruz)
Mozaic (Stimulus / Raindance / Nexus / 3WS - SF)
Satsi (Ammo - SF)

Friday, June 8th, 2007
10pm - 4am
Le Duplex, 1525 Mission St., SF
$5 all night; 21+
Call 1-888-650-6660 for more info!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Burning Man Re-Compression?

Not too many events there anymore...

I've never had any problems at 550, but I know other people have.   I would advise strongly against leaving anything of any value in your car in that area.

My two biggest complaints about Barneveld are first that the main room gets too hot sometimes.  The manager there a ways back told me that this was a known problem if they didn't start cooling the space early enough in the day.  Second complaint:  there's very annoying crosstalk between the rooms in the one hallway near coat check.  Very irritating/painful sometimes!

Peace,

Peter

How's the neighborhood? Should I expect to come back to my car in the morning and see the windows busted out? Any trick special super secret parking spots in the area?

I think someone on this list had the idea of gluing razor blades to
the back of your stereo equipment, maybe inside the glove box?

Not sure what an angry, bleeding, car thief might do at that point.

Honestly.... Your best bet is to have a meet up at a
good parking garage somewhere else in the city and
take a cab. Share the cab fare with some friends...
Safely leave the venue. Don't get a DUI pullover just
because you were seen leving the club... etc...

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Burning Man Re-Compression?

Is this REcompression or PREcompression? I know it's not DEcompression yet.

Is there any kind of non-compression associated w/ Burning Man?

I have never seen more pre and post party related stuff for a week long 
party in my life.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Burning Man Re-Compression?

gotta admit 550 is one of my all time favorite venues in SF.  mostly
because i had so many fantastic times there, notably at Thump, Analog
and the early Get Freaky parties.

amazing memories, met amazing friends, heard amazing music and got
amazingly fucked up.

Is this REcompression or PREcompression? I know it's not DEcompression yet.

Is there any kind of non-compression associated w/ Burning Man?

I have never seen more pre and post party related stuff for a week long
party in my life.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Burning Man Re-Compression?

I just wanna know what places of business all these burners work at, that 
allow them to be gone for a week, then be out for all the different 
compression crap too. Cuz it seems like people are off a whole helluva lot 
to party because a party tired them out. (which pains me just to say in the 
1st place)

I need a job that allows me to party that much. Maybe it's time to join the 
circus.

I understand why so many Americans were angry when I was first  
discovered in Afghanistan. I realize many still are, but I hope in  
time that feeling will change.

Actually, I've only met Troy a few times. But I do remember 
early on he said something at Jerold's Deli in 1996 ....

"I never met a Net-raver I didn't like"

Not terribly profound or significant these days, but Troy is 
definitely OG :-)

Oh, come on, it makes perfect sense.

Think back to the late 80s. The Shamen, Terrence McKenna, Hakim Bey
and the Temporary Autonomous Zone. Orbital, and before Orbital,
orbital raves. The Criminal Justice Act. The Summer of Love.

Fast forward to 2007, WMC, corporate superclubs in London, Paul
Fucking Oakenbeast.

Does that timeline make any sense?

The only way it even seems POSSIBLE is if you factor in Burning Man.

WMC = raving morphs into corporate superclubs.

Burning Man = the temporary autonomous zone morphs into a temporary
autonomous metroplex, with its own temporary autonomous economy,
temporary autonomous buildings, temporary autonomous neighborhoods,
temporary autonomous infrastructure, temporary autonomous rhythms, and
temporary autonomous DMV.

Without Burning Man, the story that begins with Chicago house and ends
with Oakenmonkey is a story of doom, corporate power, and failed
ideals. With Burning Man, it's so much simpler. It got big, and it
split in half. The inevitability of cellular osmosis, with the clear
philosophical division of ying and yang.

The Winter Music Conference only really seems cool when you remember
that there's also a Summer Chaos Festival.

And that means that the endless parties before and after Burning Man
are as sensible and obvious as the endless functioning of the music
industry before and after WMC. (The annual events are just
punctuation.)

The punchline to this posting is that Oakenfold and Tiesto both were the "biggest"name at Burning Man a couple of years back...

It was 2005 I believe.

Oh, come on, it makes perfect sense.

Think back to the late 80s. The Shamen, Terrence McKenna, Hakim Bey
and the Temporary Autonomous Zone. Orbital, and before Orbital,
orbital raves. The Criminal Justice Act. The Summer of Love.

Fast forward to 2007, WMC, corporate superclubs in London, Paul
Fucking Oakenbeast.

Does that timeline make any sense?

The only way it even seems POSSIBLE is if you factor in Burning Man.

WMC = raving morphs into corporate superclubs.

Burning Man = the temporary autonomous zone morphs into a temporary
autonomous metroplex, with its own temporary autonomous economy,
temporary autonomous buildings, temporary autonomous neighborhoods,
temporary autonomous infrastructure, temporary autonomous rhythms, and
temporary autonomous DMV.

Without Burning Man, the story that begins with Chicago house and ends
with Oakenmonkey is a story of doom, corporate power, and failed
ideals. With Burning Man, it's so much simpler. It got big, and it
split in half. The inevitability of cellular osmosis, with the clear
philosophical division of ying and yang.

The Winter Music Conference only really seems cool when you remember
that there's also a Summer Chaos Festival.

And that means that the endless parties before and after Burning Man
are as sensible and obvious as the endless functioning of the music
industry before and after WMC. (The annual events are just
punctuation.)

You're right its not a party, its a business and a big one at least in the arts world...

"We've never talked about a principle of transparency as something we should be doing on all levels," adds spokeswoman Marian Goodell, "because we are running a business."

Wakey wakey, eggs and bakey ...

After a man has far more money than he can ever spend, what is left to  
excite him.  For those of the ruling class authority, the answer is  
power.  Raw power over other human beings.  Money can buy that power  
only to a point.  Beyond that, politics is the sport - and world  
politics is the ultimate game.

- G. Edward Griffin, "Capitalist Conspiracy"

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Burning Man Re-Compression?

Well naturally there are good parties at Burning Man.  And there is amazing art and even the occasional miraculous happening.
 
At the same time, Burning Man is run by a corporation that benefits from controlling the brand "Burning Man" and other trademarks and properties it owns.  The corporation can and has sued people.  (http://archives.cnn.com/2002/LAW/08/26/ctv.burning.man/)  The corporation controls the event and receives all of the revenue from the sales of tickets and it sets the rules about what other entities can benefit from these properties and revenue streams. (http://www.burningman.com/press/pressRandR.html)

The counter culture goes through these cycles where "authenticity" is created through new intellectual and culturla movements (i.e. rave culture) and then subsequently exploited for commercial gain (Mitsubishi commercials).  In a way, authenticity is the currency of the counter culture.  So the question arises, is Buring Man authentic?  Or is it simply a crass commercialization of what once was authentic?
 
Never has the relationship between "authentic" counter culture and commercial entities exploiting counter cultural memes been more complex.  Think about Apple's iPod commercials.   Are they authentic?  Lots of people seem to be influenced by the appearance of "cool" at least.

To me the interesting bit here is that Burning Man is both an authentic counter cultural event AND a commercialized imitation of that same event; and it is somehow both of these at the same time.

So at what point did Burning Man say they were not about making money?
=20
At the actual event they discourage commerce. There is mass debate around t=
he sale of coffee and lemonade in center camp. Center camp profits though a=
re donated to area schools.=20
=20
The thing many people cannot see past is the reason for no commerce at the =
event. These people get hung up on no commerce and scream murder when the B=
urning Man Organization makes money. No commerce is intended to help foster=
 relationships without the use of monetary transactions. This is not part o=
f a business plan but a community plan.=20
=20
Burning Man has yet to allow sponsors or outside advertising. The Burning M=
an Organization protects their logos and name as much as any company might.=
 As you could imagine there are many people who use the logo illegally to t=
ry and sell items.=20
=20
If you are going to attack Burning Man look at the pseudo religious culture=
 developing and the desecration of eastern religions. These groups are the =
same people that live in your city and mine. Then attack the fact that more=
 and more people expect the Burning Man Organization to do more for them wh=
en the event is based on self reliance. The problem isn't the business, the=
 problem is the people reading into it and trying to find flaw instead of h=
aving fun.=20
=20
Spend your money at Burning Man or elsewhere but the fact is you are still =
spending money. It is a wicked world and until we decide to make change we'=
ll just continue to be the people that scream and shout about problems with=
out action to solve them.=20

I love the diachotomy of the entity acting as both agent and body for 
experience.  It is subject object dualism as all things manifesting are.  To 
be part of something and yet be uniquely defined, to contibute something 
meaningful, or otherwise, to the experience that is Burningman is what it is 
all about.  It only works if you go.  It only matters if your a part of it.  
Art happening is as relevant today as it was in the 60s and performance art 
is what Burningman is about.  Long Burn the Man!

Subject: [sfraves] the dark side of the summer of love

Hmm. So - there's a really good article in this month's playboy about
the death of the 'Summer of Love'. Essentially, the tale of how a
bunch of stoned-ass idealists got eaten up by predatory tweakers. I'm
recommending it, because I think it has massive relevance to rave
culture, or any other bunch of drugged out dreamers who talk about
peace and love too loudly.

check it, if you happen to read TRASHY PORN RAGS

Heh, I need to go pick on him.  The small amount of time I spent with 
Joel, Christian Smith, Cari Lekebush and Adam Beyer when we booked them 
for the infamous Harmony 5 year was hilarious (sadly, only Christian got 
to play before what had to have been the gnarliest bust I've ever seen).

Hopefully Fat City finds the freaking volume knob on their sound system, 
techno at polite db's upsets me horribly.

YEs, Pete Tall (the only actual Bassbin "Twin"), did play at RS a month or 
so ago. And he sucked horribly. HE played a rack of really wanky house. 
Worthy (from local label Dirtybird) was ten million times better than he 
was.

Now, if he's playing breaks, it might not suck - but if you see him w/ a 
laptop and anything 4x4 comes out of it, I'd run.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Bassbin Twins - FREE Thursday @ Ruby Skye

You know, I have all their orginal BREAKS records.
They came with no jacket, in white sleeves. They are
so dope! Genre Defining even...

Then, I recently went to their myspace page and
checked their new stuff, and it seems like really
boring, Tech House... WTF...

If ever there was a time to bring back the original
sound and just kill it with their breaks it would be
NOW... and in SF... although Ruby Sky is hardly the
place I would expect the Burner/Breaks crowd to go. Am
I wrong? My ony knowledge of who is listening to what
and going where in SF is from you guys...LOL

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Burning Man Re-Compression?

Hey I'm not anti-Burning Man at all, I'm merely pointing out that the apparent dichotomy between BM as an "authentic" counter culture event versus the commercialized Winter Music Conference might not be as simple as was implied.  Burning Man is viewed as authentic (at least by some of its particpants) while still being commercialized in a limited way.  In contrast WMC is viewed as over commericalized and in-authentic.  

In fact if one looks at the history of the counter culture since the sixties, it has become increasingly difficult to find trully authentic non-commercialized cultures and events.  New cultural developments are immediately captured, commercialized, and used to market products whenever possible.  the time from cultural innovation to TV commercial soundtrack is now measured in weeks rather than months.

It used to be that people thought that rock music was "authentic"; and I recall in the late seventies that many thought of disco as being "manufactured" or fake in contrast.  Then rock became "classic rock" and it was viewed as phoney and commercial.  In the nineties it was the alternative/indie rock scene that was "authentic" while classic rock was fake corporate crap.  

But of course the alternative label itself was manufactured by a commercial entity, and lets not forget "grunge", so one can see that the whole thing is in the end a house of cards.  The dichotomy of commerical vs. authentic is false.  As both Burning Man and raves point out in fact the very nature of authenticity is itself in question once some cultural artifact or concept is separated from the moment of immediate experience as "media" that can be packaged, branded, and sold.  That's why these events can't be commercialized in some sense.

In the end, Burning Man becomes a coffee table book even if that book can't ever capture any aspect of the "real" experience. .(http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/sfgate/detail?blogid=3&entry_id=9021)  Rave music is used to sell cars and clothes, but that doesn't mean that raving is merely a commercial fashion trend.  Or does it?

So at what point did Burning Man say they were not about making money?

At the actual event they discourage commerce. There is mass debate around the sale of coffee and lemonade in center camp. Center camp profits though are donated to area schools. 

The thing many people cannot see past is the reason for no commerce at the event. These people get hung up on no commerce and scream murder when the Burning Man Organization makes money. No commerce is intended to help foster relationships without the use of monetary transactions. This is not part of a business plan but a community plan. 

Burning Man has yet to allow sponsors or outside advertising. The Burning Man Organization protects their logos and name as much as any company might. As you could imagine there are many people who use the logo illegally to try and sell items. 

If you are going to attack Burning Man look at the pseudo religious culture developing and the desecration of eastern religions. These groups are the same people that live in your city and mine. Then attack the fact that more and more people expect the Burning Man Organization to do more for them when the event is based on self reliance. The problem isn't the business, the problem is the people reading into it and trying to find flaw instead of having fun. 

Spend your money at Burning Man or elsewhere but the fact is you are still spending money. It is a wicked world and until we decide to make change we'll just continue to be the people that scream and shout about problems without action to solve them.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Bassbin Twins - FREE Thursday @ Ruby Skye

of Pete's recent work, i enjoyed most of the Bassbin Twins vs. Marine
Parade tracks, "ESW" and "Ruffest" off the Y4K compilation.

but the early Bassbin stuff was truly some incredible stuff.  and it's
what i like most about breaks.

My honest opinion is that you are trying to look at this too deeply. This i=
s an event and has never been anything else. A culture developed around the=
 event but the Burning Man organization does try to influence that culture.=
 That is until this year when they are promoting green technologies. The Gr=
ateful Dead spawned a movement but in the end they were a band and they kne=
w it and didn't try to portray themselves as anything else. While you make =
comparisons to the counter-cultures of years gone by the fact is that this =
event has drawn people from many different cultures together in a melting p=
ot of sorts and allowed for an exchange of ideas rather than a promotion of=
 them. So if you want to call this a commercial event that is fine go right=
 ahead. It is an event. The people behind the scenes know this and won't ar=
gue with you.=20

No, nothing to do with BM. This is for something in the fall to raise funds
for San Francisco Sex Information. They're way more important than art cars
and really need the money. Want to donate? Go here ----> www.sfsi.org

Honestly, your best bet is to hire a catering company.
Negotiate the liquor rates. They provide bartenders
and a MOBILE liquor license. The city will never grant
a one-time permit, regardless of the whether their is
an allowance for it in the law.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Single Event Liquor License?

Yeah... have done... and been involved with many OTHER
events that have done the same... Dating back to 1993.

If you are having an EVENT, you will have to
accomodate so many things from security to parking to
police in order to get a ONE-TIME LIQUOR permit...
there will be little chance you will break even let
alone make money for a fundraiser...

A catering company has a PORTABLE license. You will
make monmey off the bar if you plan correctly.

But hey... I was trying to help a brother out... Chase
your tail all you want.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Burning Man Re-Compression?

Hah... this thread reminds me of an old article jwz wrote about  
Burning Man, their brand, and the sheer hypocrisy of the corporation  
behind the event:

http://www.jwz.org/gruntle/burningman.html

What bothers me even more than the hypocrisy alone, is that they mix  
it with a good dose off elitism for good measure...  Like going to a  
week-long party in the desert (Oh, I'm sorry.  I should say "on the  
playa" or "at Black Rock City.") makes them sooo special and sooo  
much better than me and how I (Who prefers my partying and drug use  
in nice 6-10-hour chunks followed by a shower, clean clothes, and a  
good day's sleep in my own bed, thankyouverymuch.) am just totally  
incapable of ever understanding what it's like to be a "burner".

I know not everyone who goes is like that.  I've got a some very good  
friends who go every year.  But as the years go on, and they go and I  
don't, even from some of them I start to catch twinges of a "BM's not  
for you." or "You just don't understand." attitude.

One year or another, I'll probably get around to going... if only to  
see just what the big F-ing deal is.  It'll shock the living hell out  
of everyone who knows just how much I hate sunlight, being hot, and  
being dirty.  But I just can't shake the notion that it's something I  
should do at least *once* in my life.  And when you come right down  
to it, a little hypocrisy on the part of the BM corporation is small  
potatoes compared to the outright evil of corporations like  
microsoft, walmart, halliburton, texaco, enron, and their ilk.  But  
the elitist flack I've caught from "burners" when they've found out  
that I'm not part of their club doesn't exactly acquit the event in  
my mind.  I wonder if I would be made to feel as welcome, as a late- 
coming newbie were I to actually go to BM, as I was when I started  
going to raves?


cya,
john

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Single Event Liquor License?

i've done this several times when i was working for the SF Int Asian
American Film Festival.

it was not that hard and not that expensive.

of course, that was for a well established non-profit, well
established annual event and at venues that were well known.

Subject: [sfraves] Ibiza in Shambles?  Authorities Close Amnesia, DC10 and Bora Bora Clubs

Diario de Ibiza, the news agency for the hottest Summer dance music location on the planet, recently reported that government officials have ordered the clubs Amnesia, DC10 and Bora Bora to shut down.

Nightingale (Radio 1), Hybrid, Krafty Kuts, Scanty Sandwich,
Scissorkicks, Anthony Pappa and Caspar Kedros (Headrillaz) among
others.

Stabilizer is now signed to the mighty Plastic Raygun and the first
single release, What It Takes rose to Number 5 in the DJ Mag breaks
chart as well as being described as "A Classic" by none other than
Andy Weatherall.

As well as the production, Stabilizer can be found despoiling the
world=D5s ears in a breakbeat and punky house fashion in places as
diverse as Bath, Bognor and Berlin, with a US tour planned.

Armed with a bag of records and a sampler - with an emphasis firmly on
good tunes and a good time - the Stabilizer DJ style is tight, varied
and always full of energy. With genres ranging from Hip Hip and Funk
via punky house all the way to the freshest nu-school breaks cuts.
Only two rules... it's got to be good, and it's got to be funky.


Along with:
DJ Unagi (Word of Mouth) - Special birthday set
M.O.D. (Evil Breaks)
Athena (Evil Breaks)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Ibiza in Shambles?  Authorities Close Amnesia, DC10
 and Bora Bora Clubs

Now that is a real shame. That's going to hit the island hard, those 
clubs bring in a tremendous amount of business and must employ several 
hundred people.

    "Is It Live, Or Is It Memorex?"

    "Skynet begins to learn at a geometric rate. It becomes self-aware
    at 2:14 a.m. Eastern time, August 29th. In a panic, they try to pull
    the plug. "

For the last several years it has been a running gag between me and 
those that know me that it's getting harder and harder to tell the 
difference between what we know as "Reality" and what passes for the 
fine reportage from "America's Finest News Source," otherwise known as 
"The Onion".


    Nation Hoping For A Windy Flag Day

    June 5, 2007 | Issue 43â€¢23

    WASHINGTON, DCâ€”With June 14 just a week away, citizens nationwide
    are hoping that brisk, windy weather is in store for this Flag Day.

    "A Flag Day without wind is like a Columbus Day with mail delivery:
    It just doesn't feel right," said Coast Guard Rear Adm. Roger
    Jessup, who is serving as this year's Flag Day grand marshal. "I
    long for the Flag Days of my youth, when the winds were always
    strong and steady. Seems like in the past few years there's barely
    been a breeze and Old Glory just droops. Except for Flag Day '02,
    when it was so blustery the flag whipped right around the flagpole."

    Jessup, whose duties include answering Flag Day mail from the
    nation's children, added that if everyone tried as hard as they
    could to be good this week, "perhaps Starry Stripes, the Flag Day
    Fairy, will blow some nice breezy air our way."

Well, I'm here to tell you that today, June 14th, 2007, at exactly 5am, 
EST, the Flag Day commemoration here in the United States Of America, 
The Weather Channel led with an item about the effects that gusty winds 
will have today.

I don't know any other way to put this....

We're seriously  in big fucking trouble.

Thanks!

I've decided to slip in MLKs A Time To Break Silence (speech against the 
Vietnam war) in between, as it's points are still relevant today here in 
the US and it's a good partner to the environmental talk from Derrick 
Jensen.

I think the reason the government wants to suppress or get rid of  
raves is the same reason the elites want to do away with the middle  
class and have one world corporation that everyone just works for -  
it's a threat to them.  Raves, dancing, with or without the drugs,  
encourages free thinking.  But imagine if there were so many people  
doing undergrounds that the police can't keep up with it.  You know  
if Bush tries to implement martial law and only 2% of the population  
rise up I think it outnumbers the military.  That's why I could care  
less about going to a party that's not "permitted" who cares about  
that shit, you're just paying someone off.  Americans of 1776 would  
have had nothing of this.

>    "A Flag Day without wind is like a Columbus Day with mail delivery:

>    Jessup, who is serving as this year's Flag Day grand marshal. "I

>    when it was so blustery the flag whipped right around the flagpole."
>
>    Jessup, whose duties include answering Flag Day mail from the
>    nation's children, added that if everyone tried as hard as they
>    could to be good this week, "perhaps Starry Stripes, the Flag Day
>    Fairy, will blow some nice breezy air our way."

>Well, I'm here to tell you that today, June 14th, 2007, at exactly 5am,

>>

>>
>>    WASHINGTON, DCâ€”With June 14 just a week away, citizens nationwide
>>    are hoping that brisk, windy weather is in store for this Flag Day.
>>
>>    "A Flag Day without wind is like a Columbus Day with mail delivery:
>>    It just doesn't feel right," said Coast Guard Rear Adm. Roger
>>    Jessup, who is serving as this year's Flag Day grand marshal. "I
>>    long for the Flag Days of my youth, when the winds were always
>>    strong and steady. Seems like in the past few years there's barely
>>    been a breeze and Old Glory just droops. Except for Flag Day '02,
>>    when it was so blustery the flag whipped right around the flagpole."
>>
>>    Jessup, whose duties include answering Flag Day mail from the
>>    nation's children, added that if everyone tried as hard as they
>>    could to be good this week, "perhaps Starry Stripes, the Flag Day
>>    Fairy, will blow some nice breezy air our way."
>> 
>> Well, I'm here to tell you that today, June 14th, 2007, at exactly 5am, 
>> EST, the Flag Day commemoration here in the United States Of America, The 
>> Weather Channel led with an item about the effects that gusty winds will 
>> have today.
>> 
>> I don't know any other way to put this....
>> 
>> We're seriously  in big fucking trouble.

I talk to the manager of the hotel if I'd be able to work at his hotle
lookig the way i look & he said i'd have to take out all my visible
peircings & I tol dhim for Religous reason i can't do that & I don't bite
& I would be perfect to work for him 'cause i've had over 4 years
experience workin' in Hotels & know the dealie.  then he asked if i was
really looking to work for him & i said i wasn't, i was just curious if
he'd hire based on what we talked about ;)  He said i made some good
points & he probably would of if i lived in LA!!!

like so high that he doesn't get drunk... then why the fuck is he driving

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Cross Fading or Volume Controlling?

Depends on the track/format. I switched over primarily to using CD's, and 
anything lower bitrate than 320 Kbps can be janky as far as volume is 
concerned. SOmetimes you can adjust volume just using the EQ's, but other 
times the gain is what is necessary. I have never really played on a mixer 
where it's set up to max out before the fader is all the way at the top of 
the fader channel - I tend to reduce the overall volume so I can slam the 
faders to the hilt. So other than using the faders to do exactly what they 
are meant to do, which is fade the track volume in and out for smooth 
transitions, I tend to primarily do all my fine tuning with the EQ & gains. 
If you work shit properly, you can avoid stuff like bass cancellation and 
huge volume differences like that...or at least, in my experience thus far.

always use the volume faders.

the reason being:

- one, i scratch (poorly) on occasion.  in those circumstances, i
adjust the crossfader to have a steep curve.  that is, if the mixer
has a fader adjust.

- too many times mixing on a rave/club mixer where the crossfader is
shoddy and/or bleeds


really, your best bet is to be comfortable using both.  depending on
the type of music being played and how you prefer to mix, both have
advantages and their own time and place.

Word! On those dam faders that are bad at some venues. Depending on the track 
and the mixer would prompt me on what to do. I still like using a combination 
of both the channel volume and cross fader I also like to eq my mixes but 
some venues have people on mix boards or preset volume threshold that are set 
when all your eq knobs are in the middle and that is were it usually sounds best. 
If u are at venues like this all u have to worry about is your mixing. As for 
using the crossfader, it is fun to use when it is working properly, otherwise 
just use the channel volumes with some eq-ing and u should be all good. MY 
recommended mixers are the rotary rane for seamless mixing but, if u like to do 
some trick and effects I recommend the pioneer600 and or the equivalent allen&
heath xone mixers.

I use the rotary volume controls exclusivly. Then
again I've locked myself into that because I use a
Urei 1620LE rotary that doesn't even have channell
EQ's or gains let alone a cross fader. I do have an
outboard 5 band tube isolator plugged in that acts as
a master EQ though. The upside is it has made me a
much better and much smoother dj.

The shift to climate change being a focal point came about for two
very distinct reasons.  The first reason was, by the mid 80's, a
majority of people now agreed with all the reasonable things we in the
environmental movement were saying they should do.  Now when a
majority of people agree with you, it's pretty hard to remain
confrontational with them.  And so the only way to remain
anti-establishment was to adopt ever more extreme positions.  When I
left Greenpeace, it was in the midst of them adopting a campaign to
ban chlorine worldwide.  Like I said, "you guys, this is one of the
elements in the periodic table, you know, I'm not sure if that's in
our juridstiction to be banning a whole element."

- Patrick Moore, co-founder of Greenpeace

   HIGH CALIBER aka BRYAN JONES & MIKE GILLENWATER (Nocturnal / Olive / Moody / Carizma / Nine / Control, Chicago) 
 Wrapping up his international Step Back 2007 Tour, DJ Bryan Jones joins Mike Gillenwater as High Caliber, originally formed in late 2002. Both artists hail from Chicago where they’ve independently established themselves as icons in the Funky House scene. Five years and nearly 20 chart-busting EPs later, High Caliber is releasing their biggest project to date: 

“Old School Sessions,” a four-part all-digital mix series that was too long to condense into one album. Catch tracks from this new groundbreaking series along with other HC classics for a floor-rocking experience San Francisco will surely not forget!

Great Lakes Christmas Ale is by far the sexiest (yes beer can be sexy) brew
I have ever tasted. Dos Equis amber is a good second and Sol is a refreshing
brew great on a hot summer day.

“WTF are CaliGrown Events?”

We’re a spin-off of a former Central Valley UG rave crew called Elysium from 
the
late 90’s - early 00’s. Elysium produced several events in the Central 
Valley, and
some in the Bay Area including a residence at the now infamous Hotel Ibiza 
in
2001. CaliGrown is based out of San Jose. We produce events out of love for 
the
music and the vibe its followers carry.

It's been a while since I drank ghetto beer... But
before I had the taste for alcohol, like 1989 or so...
We drank Keystone Light. Mostly because it hardly
tasted like beer, or anything for that matter.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Ghetto beer favorites?


"Olde English 800 'cause that's my brand; Take it in a
bottle, 40, quart or can"

I decided to drink a 32 of St. Ides at a friend's
place in LA once.  I remember getting to the bottom of
the bottle and setting the empty on the table in front
of the couch.  I closed my eyes and when I opened them
up again, it was about 4 hours later, everyone had
left, the lights were out and I was laying on my side
on the couch.  I have no idea what happened during the
time between.  I never drank St. Ides again.

Subject: [sfraves] BSP - Tonal: Poppin' Pink this Saturday with NYC's Troydon!

Saturday, June 23rd
10 PM 'til very late
Rock It Science and Prismatic Tracks present:

Tonal: Poppin' Pink

SF Location: call 888-482-9281 or 415-412-0406, or visit prismatictracks.com
$5 before 10:30 PM, $10 before midnight, $15 after
Free mix CD for dressing in Poppin' Pink (make some serious effort people!)
Happy Birthdays: Alida and Barry!

With special guest DJs:

Troydon--NYC (Om Records, Drop Music, Freerange)--2 Hour Set--Premier San
Francisco Underground Appearance!

Troydon has rocked a Stompy party, thrown down a killer set on one of last
year's Sunset Boat Parties, and most recently tore the roof off of the
Endup.  A transplant from South Africa to NYC, Troydon's production skills
have brought him releases on some of the hottest labels in the world,
including a smash release on SF's flagship label Om.  Behind the decks you
can expect a flawless blend of crowd rocking tracks ranging from funk
inspired to dirty techy grinders.  Don't miss SF's premier underground
appearance of one of the hottest up and coming DJ/producers to hit the
scene!

Still Rob G (Om Records, Ankle Breakers)

Rob Grega, A&R kingpin for the esteemed SF-based label Om Records, has a
musical taste that runs the gamut - and a collection that says the same!
His sets are comprised of downtempo, funk, jazz, soul, broken-beat, house,
and minimal tech at any given performance. As a music compiler at Om, Rob
gets his hands on some of the newest, fresh-out-the-studio productions out
there today.  Regularly experimenting with this music in his sets, he is one
of the most up-to-date DJ's on the block.  

Homero Espinosa (Yerba Buena Discos, Control, Detour) -- Special Old School
Set!

Homero Espinosa began spinning records as DJ Huey in the Bay Area in the
early 90's, quickly finding a niche in the underground rave scene.  He has
since dropped the DJ Huey moniker and founded Yerba Buena Discos, showcasing
his own production along with other serious local SF talent.  YBD has been
charted by legends like DJ Sneak, and Homero's production appeared on Mark
Farina's most recent Ministry of Sound mixed CD.  Behind the 1s and 2's
Homero represents the SF sound well, with recent guest spots across the US.
Watch closely this night...you might catch a glimpse of DJ Huey coming out
of hiding!

Plus:

Andrew Phelan & Origami (Prismatic, Drop Music, So Sound)

Eric Sharp (Rock It Science)

Jimmy B. (Green Gorilla Lounge, rxfx)

Greg Yuen (Motion, Hawt, Primal)

Greg Logan (Motion, Hawt)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] beer favorites?

I like beer, but I don't like getting drunk or hung over on beer.

So when I'm out and about and in a beery mood, I usually go with a  
good stout.  Guinness is always a good choice and is pretty  
ubiquitous, so that's what I usually get.  But I'm always up to try  
new kinds.

The advantage being:  Not only do I just like them better than  
lighter beers; but (getting back to my initial point) when you're  
drinking a nice thick stout, no one thinks you're a killjoy when you  
nurse it along for a good while.  It's just too thick to drink  
quickly anyway.  So I can still go and be beery and sociable, but  
actually wind up drinking much less and not getting drunk or hung over.


cya,
john

long, but give my best summary of like each event & stuff :)
------
In January.. the only event i went to was Evil Breaks: Dirty @ Fat City! 
I remember on the way there, I was on BART w/ these group of people
dressed up & they wre kinda lost & didn't know what stop to get off, so i
helped then! Anywaze... it was a Groovy night!!!  It was Awesome kickin'
it w/ FFS & i kept teasing him calling him General Midi. LoL!  Needless to
say his set ROCKED!!!  I'm always happy to see him & Groovy hard to his
Yummy Choonz!!  Fine Young Cannables.. his set rocked to!  Wait.. i mean..
Fine Cut Bodies, right???  Oooh... & Lobudg... they wre YUmmy too!!!  Like
from memory... I recall the sets being (by order of DJs mentioned
a;lready) Buzzy Electric, Smooth Groovy, & Crazy Mad wooohooo!!  When
MODdie opened up, i remember, he threw down hard for an opening set, went
housey a bit, & threw in like 2 80s tracks that night.. So YUm!!  The rest
of the EB Ressies threw down Crazy to that the whole club was Illin'! 
Ambiant Mafia had the side room & man... it was fuckin' Crazy in there!! 
There wwere a few DJs who like played these strait mellow hip hop/ trip
hop/ down tempo sets that had me just Groovin' hard on well.. it's hard

Febuary started out on a weekendnight when The Redline Crew took over
Compression & flew out Miss Reid Speed for a Special night!!  It was Dope
too 'cause even people from like Sac came out to kick it!  1st off, Reid's
set was Fuckin' Sick... I remember her set, she threw down so hard & it
was a perfect set 'cause it kept me dancing!!!  The rest of the Redline
Chicas who spun that night: Eva, Kozzee, & Tess Fetale, oooh my gosh...
ok.. in order of DJ mentioned no no no.. they all busted it fuckin' hard
that night from what i remember!!

Later on that night after the club closed down, we went to Tess's car
cause My Homie Kiro wanted to smoke out Reid & the whole time in the car,
Reid was like totally punishing herself sayin' how she fucked up hella bad
when she was mixing & missed a cue, yada yada yada... we all tried
assuring her that she was bad ass & well.. she didn't believe any of! 
Oh.. i also got a ride home from my Sac HOmies.. so i didn't have to do
the early morn adventure on Publiuc Transportaion! :)

------

I also went to Bohdi Sutra in Feb!  This was the party i been waiting for
in forever!!! Strictly Techno all night fuckin' long & so Dope!!  OK.. on
the way there, like i was suppose to call my ride when i got to West Oak
BART station, but i confuzed the "9" for a "4" in his phone #, so instead
of waiting there, i went to OW to wait!  When i figured out my problem.. i
called my ride & got to the venue!  OK.. so like all i can remember from
this night, since i waited soo long to post this, was that i was in
HEAVEN!!!  I mean... Techno all night long & just Groovin' away on the
dance floor.. so Dope!!  Esp when DDR came on.. Oooh man!!  Hello 2Day!!!

Promotions went kinda odd.. lol... for this.. like as underground as they
wanted to keep this, they also decided to post on Bay Raves which wasn't a
bad idea anyway 'cause mosta those kida on there don't really know what
real Techno is... but from that... Bohdi Sutra got posted on more boards &
lists & like for that venue in Oak, alooooota people over crowded it, but
it was still fun!!!  It was also nice to be with family that night!!It
reallyl Sucked though 'cause there was another all Family Techno party
that same night  :(  But ya know... havin' 2 Techno parties the same night
only shows how strong we got it here!!!!

Oh yeah.. next Morn - afternoon, i helped Phillip Diaz & Familia paint
their new pad :) LOLOLMAO  that was Fun!!  & PLaying w/. my Lenny Fishbutt
all day was Dope!
------

Febuary was also the month that a new Bi Monthly started @ Blakes again...
Transmission!  My Homie Tim put it together!!!  This 1 thursday night,
Brandon played for Transmission & LMAO.. he fuckin' Killed it so hard that
night... I mean.. the other DJs did good too, but ok.. i'm biased as
fucked 'cause Brandon's 1 of my Best Bros!  But really, he actually got
people dancing, he threw done yummy ch00nz, & was inter-active & reactive
to the crowd on the floor :)  I can't remember who else was on the line up
that night.. u mmm... Flywash, ummm, ooh... Blueboy what's his name, 7 ooh
oh oh.. Adam Ant!! :)  It was Awesome seein' the Blakes staff who still
work there!  Big John, the mamanger, like totally got mad @ me for not
coming more often to visit :)  That was Dope!

Level faders work better than cross faders for bringing stuff in, and 
fading stuff out.  Your basic mixing should be going on here.  The 
cleanest, smoothest DJs usually bring in one channel with the fader while 
starting to roll off the EQ on the "already playing" record to start 
taking it out as they approach equivalent volume.

Crossfaders are good for slamming between the two channels, cutting, etc.  
Your chaotic spazzery should go on here.  Note, there are so many 
crossfaders out there, with anywhere from a 6db dip in the crossfader to 
no dip at all in the crossfader, and travel of all varieties.  They're 
also usually the first thing to break.  Relying on them is a not-so-good 
idea.

The comments about using the EQs to mix are useful, but I've been on this 
kick lately where I am getting away from using them when possible.  If you 
go back to the tapes from the early 90s, they didn't *have* per channel 
EQs in most cases... and in many cases the stuff just sounded better.  The 
cheap fixed freq EQs used on most mixer channel EQs don't sound all that 
good, and heavy cutting of the bass isn't the best thing to do to get two 
records to play along nicely (of course it works better than getting bass 
soup, but in most cases there's another way... waiting for a break, using 
a tool record, etc to get those two things butted up nicely).

One of the funnest things about DJing is never knowing what you're gonna 
get when you get to a booking.  I remember one time, Siphon and I showed 
up at a house party (paid booking I think, it was kinda funny) with a 
Realistic 2 channel mixer and 1 Belt drive deck and a 1200.  We followed a 
really bad wedding DJ level skills dude, with a tagteam breaks set.  It 
wasn't ninja clean, but being able to rock it given any set of tools goes 
a lot further than clearing the dancefloor and grumbling about the mixer 
not being what you use at home.  The only way to learn to do that is get a 
chance to play on every kind of setup you can, even if it "sucks".

There's something kinda almost fun about doing your best on what you're 
given and still managing to sound like yourself without the effects, eqs, 
scratch faders, gains, rotary levels, beatkeeper (ROFL), per channel level 
meters, good (or even "seperate") monitors, effects, kaos pads, filters, 
headphone cue/master mix knob, etc that we tend to get hooked on.  Hell, I 
was only playing bug parties till about 2001, but even then it wasn't 
uncommon to walk up to the decks and be eye to eye with a pre-historic 
Rane mp-24 (they were many a sound company's choice, because the very 
simple gain structure and EQ sounded great out of enormous sound systems 
and made it virtually impossible for DJs to distort within the mixer or 
present ludicrously high levels).

Nothing says "pwned" like following a DJ who is whining about the gear as 
an excuse for a bad set and wiping the floor with their ass.  Extra points 
if you're drinking a 40oz or smoking a blunt while you do it.  And oh, 
have fun.  People can hear fun coming through.

Amen, brother!

For the longest time, my home setup consisted of two
plasticer-than-plastic belt-drive turntables that I
got for about $8 each at a Salvation Army store, a
pair of Radio Shack needles, a Gemini PMX-15 Scratch
Master mixer, and the whole thing ran through my 1976
Sony tuner and a pair of self-refurbished speakers. 
Now, that setup drove me absolutely insane.  It was
more frustrating than you'd believe.

But -- I'd show up to gigs where they'd have two
1200's and some fairly nice Vestax mixer, and DJ's
would be bitching and whining because there were
Stanton AL-500's on the tonearms instead of Ortofons
and the crossfader didn't have a curve adjustment and
the decks weren't modded to have blue LEDs in them and
how are they supposed to even possibly play a set like
this... And I'd step up and breeze through my set with
no problem at all.

I've long said that any rave DJ worth their salt
should be able to beatmatch bicycle wheels with paper
cones with seweing needles taped to them.  All the
trick equipment in the world won't compensate for you
not taking the time to learn the basics of
beatmatching, track construction, listening to the
breaks, effective fading, etc.

Subject: [sfraves] 2 Mackie 450 speakers for sale


http://www.mackie.com/products/srm450/

We have owned these for about 3 years and they have
probably seen under 40 hours of use during that time. 
We have only used them a couple of times a year and it
is time for us to pass them on.  

They are in excellent shape and come with awesome
telescoping stands and all the cords that you will
ever need.  

We are asking $900 for the two of them together ($450
each), which includes cords and stands.

If you are interested and live in the bay area
hit me up.

Thanks,
Monica

And I have to head out the door in 10 minutes damn it!  I'll tune the FM to 90.1 as long as the signal holds out though...

Stevian is one of the best DJs in the area IMO; always original sets that illuminate and instigate...

Peace,

Peter

Subject: [sfraves] MLWRs: March - April


Oh yeah... MLWR =  Mondo Late Weekend Reveiws btw ;)  Oh oh oh, yeah like
i realized from the last WR i wrote, this might take a long time to read,
so print out & read when u lunch or something ;)

March was another like not dull month, but I just didn't go out as much
really... my parents like also were away on a 2 week cruise goin' like
around the world or something, & when their gone, i just wanna stay home
as much as possible... it also woulda been kinda hard to go out on the
weekends 'cause it woulda been hard to get home kinda when they ain't home
& i'm like butt fuckin' tired from the night & walking home from the bus
stop in Hercules is just not gonna happen... I also spent most of the
month on the phone almost everyday w/ alota my counselors from school on
when i can go back & start again & getting that school shit sorted!

In March though, i did catch my Hollywood Homies back again in the
Richmond in Rockit Room & they performed w/ Pea Soup again! Oh yeah..
lol.. that night, after RR, I did end up @ BAGG @ Glass Cat :)  LoL...
that was fun 'cause I did hang out w/ Big Bro Chazz & see a few Family
there!!!  I also remember waiting for BART that morning to open was killer
'cause i waited @ Jack In The Box on Mission & actually made friends w/
the workers there & got a free refill on my drink & also got extra fries
;)

http://s131.photobucket.com/albums/p314/OsbyWonka/warnerdrive-BAGG-3-14-07/

Ooooooooooooooh yeah.. there was also the Evil Breaks 3 Year Anniversary @
Whisper that month.. LoL.. on the way there, i made friends w/ this group
of people goin' to Pac Bell Park for the game & lol.. it was fun.. they
were fun!  But oh my gosh.. ED 3 YR.. oooooooooh... Whisper was fuckin'
ALIVE that night!!  Well wait, like i was there early enough for like
Deekline to do a sound check for the room upstairs.. ooooooh.. he spun
hella Ghetto Tech & I was in Heaven!!  Anywaze, yeah, the vibe that night
was Dope!!! Komega played a live techno/ breaks set, Sticky & Rafiq
ooooh.. all the DJs played yummy shit... I swear i lost 10- pounds that
night dancing my ass off!!!  After, went to an after party & didn't get
home 'til the next day in the early afternoon :)  So Fun!  Oh yeah.. & the
vibe @ the club.. soooo off the hook like totally mondo man!!!

http://s203.photobucket.com/albums/aa170/osbyjamz/EB3YR33007/
-- 

Now the Loco of Spring time fun came in April!  Things started off in a
big way w/ BUNNYJAM 2007!!!!  NeonBunny, who throws it, like has been
asking me for yeeeeears to go check it out & stuff, but there was always
another event that i went to on the same night BJ would go down!  But
there year, i made it & I'm sooooo glad that i did!!  It was help @ Porn
Palace this year & ooh my gosh.. so much fun!!  Like I went early & helped
out, then when the party got into full swing & started.... my 1st duty was
to be a human catcher.. 'cause people who showed up to BJ were wither full
bunny, 1/2 bunny, or no bunny... so it was my job to catch the humans in a
net, bring them to the Bunnification Modification Station, & the Bunny
Modifers would make the Human into a bunny!!! :)

I just gotta say, i don't know why i waited so fuckikn' long to go to
BunnyJam!!!  I swear.. this annual event is sooo FUN!!!  The music is all
like Breaks, Techno, Electro, Blue Grass, Folk, Rock, House, Disco, 80's,
just everything Yummy!!  I even heard a jungle set in 1 of the rooms! 
There wre 3 rooms of music!  All kinds of Bunnies were there: Sexy,
Playboy, Strippers, Doctor, Nurse, Hobo, Geek, Hippy, Clown, Monster,
Leather, oh my goodness man... all kindsa Bunnies!!!  There were even
Carrots & Girrafes @ the party!  At like some point during the night, I
gave a Bunny Puppet show in the puppet room! Oooh.. & lemme tell you,
there were heeeeeeella horny bunnies!!  I saw alota thumpin, humpin, &
bumpin goin' on!!  Hello 2day!

I also spent some time @ Anu that night 'cause it was also Still Doin
it... the jungle monthly they have there!  Pretty much all the residents
were on the decks that night & ooooooh... so much fun dancing there & just
seein' my Jungle Familia!  Anywaze... after we striked Sunday Morn & the
Chinese guy workin' @ All Star Donuts kinda got well... annoyed with me
just sitting there drinking coffee, i kinda took off & started like just
walking!  Then the gas tanker dude @ Shell on 5th & Folsum like he worked
graveyard & wasn't sure if he was actually seein' a Easter Bunny actaully
walking up the street or just a normal person (I totally forgot i had my
bunny face & ears on still).. then we ended up hangin out for like 45
mintues while he filled up that station w/ gas & said he'd gimme a ride
ome to Hercules, but his truck was GPSed & stuff... so I just walked down
Folsum & like well.. i ran into a crack head from Chicago who was lost or
something.. so we hung out until bart opened up... I even ran into Big J
from Butter @ some point that morning :)

http://s203.photobucket.com/albums/aa170/osbyjamz/bunnyjamSDI-4-7-07/

The next weekend, Friday, was the Yuri 40 Yrs ago Flight Anniversary
Cel... well.. the Rave @ Nasa :)  that night was soooooo fun!!  I
seriously wasn't expecting to go, honestly, but i got a call from the
producer of :codeTV & he wanted to do segments @ the party... so me,
Bruce, the other Camera person, Veronica, went!  I have to say, it was
soooo Dope partying down in a fuckin' hanger @ fuckin' NASA... Musically,
it was alota Breaks, house, down Tempo, trip hop, & dub step!  In the VIP
rooms up stairs, there were NASA officials, astronuats, FOOD!, oooh...
Chocolate, & this space suit from that space place in Berkley hills,
what's it called again?  The Unimog was Dope!!  Like when the party was @
peak, there was probably over like 1500-2000 people there!  Unfortunately,
the party ended 2 hours ahead of schedule 'cause of "the rain".. i mean..
it was a hella light drizzle, but "NASA officials were scared of a
electrical shortage" yada yada yada!  It was all pretty conspericy (sp) as
to who really shut down the party & there was even a fist fight between 2
dudes in the crew.  Anywaze, after NASA, we packed up & went to an
afterparty down the street & chilled there for a while, ate food, drank,
socialized w/ more Awesome People, saw hella naked people, then went home

The next night, see, like i mean.. i just started my new class & juat got
back in school again & i was kinda set on doing homework that day/night
(since i also just got back like from the NASA after party @ like 10AM),
so i planned on staying in Toooooooooooootally!  Anywaze, i get this call
from Unka telling me that we're goin' to Evil Breaks @ Jelly's!  Heeeeello
2Day.. i was hella buggin' 'cause well.. YAAY, i mean.. i didn't get to
finish my homework, but it was sooo FUN & I got down & DIRTY!!!!  All the
DJs rocked it ofcourse & Kid Blue & BLIM played their yummy sets & music!!
I mean... SubScience even make it more Yummy 'cause they had the Jungle in
the back patio place & ooooh... so Groovy, So Dope!! I just like remember
like it was a mondo fight for me to like decide what room to stay in
'cause they were both sooo YUMMY!!!  It was Awesome 'cause alota more
Familia showed up as the night went on & we jsut fuckin' brocked outon the
dance floor man!!!  I knowq there was a dub step event that night @ Club 6
& alota people from there like came to Jellys!! But yeah... Groovy, Yummy,
So Dope!!  Loved It!

http://s203.photobucket.com/albums/aa170/osbyjamz/evilbreaksdirty41407/

ok... so the next friday after that was 4-20!  A few of us got together w/
Unka in this Sushi joint in Oakland by the lake for her Bday!! 
YAAAAAAAAY... & SO YUMMY!!!  Then after, we went to OW for their 1st
shindig in liike forever... Hello 2Day.. it was soooooooo damn fuckin'
Good to be home again!!!  It was Pretty Ill 'cause i mean.. Music was all
TEchno Electro Breaks & Proggy Yada yada in th3 main room & in the side
room it was all like Breaks Jungle & hmmm.. alota Experimental Electric
Hippy stuff!!  WOW!!!  It was nice being w/ Familia that night & seein

crowd for OW, but so much damn energy, Yummy vibes, & just WOW!!!

http://s203.photobucket.com/albums/aa170/osbyjamz/evilbreaksdirty41407/

i also went  to a Birthday party @ a comic book store in the City this
month for Chris & SuzyTek... from the Dub Step Familia:)  No music, just
alota drunk, snacks, Carot Cake, & ooooooh.. it was such a good night :) 
So like what happen was b4 i even got to the City, like when i hoped on
the bus, an old Homie from while back pops up & told me he was in jail for
like 8-9 months, jsut got released, & had no where to go... So he ended up
taggin' along w/ me & came to the bday party in the comic book store too
w/ me!  It was kinda funny 'cause well.. him & me together, his name is
Giovani btw, are like both kindsa intense... he's was the creepy WTF & i
guess i'm the more hyper Hello 2day... & all the Homies kinda got freaked
out by him... LoL.. Hello 2Day :P

Nope, just a fellow SFR listmate that has had some recent challenges with some rather unpleasant health problems.  Something many of us will have to look forward to ourselves in the not very distant future.  

But hey as long as its happening to someone else its funny right?  

Try carrying around your poop in a plastic bag attached to your side and see if it puts you in the party spirit.

Of course in some cases a visible and stinky bag of shit would actually be a substantial improvement over the (invisible) sacks of emotional shit that some people seem to be carrying around these days...

GRR! What happened to the PLUR?

I dunno about the rest of y'all, but that wasn't maliciousness on my
part. I just found the message indecipherable and cryptic on a Geri
Dahl level. Now that you lay it out -- oh. That's what's going on
here.

Uh, no... it's funny to the person it IS happening too... only not to you.

Indeed I am sure I could learn a lot of Adriana.

In the end you have to live with whatever situation you've got and you can choose to laugh or cry about it...

So laughing at your own situation is just smart, but laughing at someone else's situation is more often than not just meaness.  I suppose you are saying that you were simply laughing along with Adriana, so fine, but it didn't come across that way to me when I read it.  

FWIW, etc.

Peace,

Peter

The first party to thrown down the gauntlet in the name of peace holds a

Or something like that.

LOL no flame war on sfraves is complete without all the relevant parties contributing their $0.02.

FWIW, Adriana has written several times on the list about her health situation previously, but obviously not everyone reads every message on this list.  For those of you that don't know her, she's a cool person going through some health related suckiness right now, and was I assume just reaching out to the list for a little humor and support the other night.  

Maybe I misinterpreted SE/30's posting, and I was pre-caffeine, but I don't have any regrets for standing up for Adriana.  I'd even do it again.  :P

And hopefully my sorry attempts at ghettotech lyrics will help out a tiny bit with the humor part. 

Get healthy Adriana!

Peace,

Peter

I was in fact making fun of the idea of posting about it in ghettotech lyrics style.

Which is actually damn funny.  Thanks for the suggestion.  

Please post all future responses in "cheesy trance anthem" format.

Thnx,

I'm not too up on all the performers that will be there, but the Ethel 
Merman Experience was freaking hilarious the one time I saw them.  Of 
course, they were all drunk, it was the Odeon I think, we barely made it 
out alive.

This site has a utube link with U2's "I will follow"& the Beatle's Helter 
Skelter properly Mermanized:

In April I was struck down with spinal meningitis. Nearly killed me  
There was one of those "should we pull the cord" moments.

My partner decided not to so here I am: after 2 1/2 months in  
hospital; diminished hearing and sight; and, most important, loss of  
20 lbs muscle and the ability to walk...for now. Need much PT, I hear  
a year, to walk again:(

So I'll get about in a wheelchair and lower my decks to spin. Maybe I  
can dance in my chair?:)

LOVE,
APOLLO

Loved the version of Helter Skelter.

In other Pride weekend celebration news, apart from the huge "Queen" party out on the pier, Anon Salon is having a "Stray Pride" party at the Anon Gallery space on 9th...I haven't been in there for a long while but you can expect the usual weirdness from Spoonman and company.

DJ Food tonight at Blasthaus, there's this thing http://tilldawn-productions.com/events.php  , Acid Totem Lucid Dreams fund raiser tomorrow  (great cause, more bass!), there's Sunset in GGP at the band shell Saturday, Pangea at the Oasis in Oakland Sunday, and isn't there a Panda party in bunny meadow Sunday? 

Too many parties to even remember...

I'm not too up on all the performers that will be there, but the Ethel 
Merman Experience was freaking hilarious the one time I saw them.  Of 
course, they were all drunk, it was the Odeon I think, we barely made it 
out alive.

This site has a utube link with U2's "I will follow"& the Beatle's Helter 
Skelter properly Mermanized:

Back a few years ago I met a fellow on the dance floor at Arc (formerly Vinyl) in NYC one New Years Eve that was tearing it up in his chair, rolling around at top speed, spinning, and smiling so it can be done and even done well...

Peace,

Peter

In April I was struck down with spinal meningitis. Nearly killed me  
There was one of those "should we pull the cord" moments.

My partner decided not to so here I am: after 2 1/2 months in  
hospital; diminished hearing and sight; and, most important, loss of  
20 lbs muscle and the ability to walk...for now. Need much PT, I hear  
a year, to walk again:(

So I'll get about in a wheelchair and lower my decks to spin. Maybe I  
can dance in my chair?:)

LOVE,

Any word? Please email privately. The clubs and above-ground
undergrounds aren't offering much, but I know there's something else
going on. Last weekend left me with about a pound of mud in my lungs,
but shieeet it was fun. Whats the haps?

Dear Apollo,

I have been a member of this list for about a year but have never posted.  =
I grew up in Salinas and spent my high school and early college days raving=
 in San Fran (91-95).  I am now a young adult of 32.  I moved to Mammoth La=
kes after graduating from USC in 98 and became an avid skier, rock climber,=
 etc.  Three years ago, I broke my back skiing here at Mammoth and just wen=
t through my third surgery at UCSF 7 weeks ago.  I joined SF-Raves to keep =
up with my old passion as Mammoth is almost completely lacking in our favor=
ite music (a few super secret full moon parties now and then.)  Anyway,  I =
just spent 6 weeks in bed for 22 hours per day.  I completely empathize wit=
h what you are going through!!!  I snuck away 2 years ago to the "Power to =
the Peaceful" 9/11 after hours in SF.  I could barely  walk but somehow pul=
led out the strength to dance the night away until 4am.  The secret lies wi=
thin.  The soul is  more powerful than the body.  The gifts and lessons we =
learn from being struck down are infinitely divine.  You may learn that you=
 are an artist, love reading or you may just grow to savor every single exp=
erience infinitely more.  I look forward to dancing with you, Apollo, in a =
year when our backs our healed, the physical therapy is behind us and we ar=
e up on our feet again ;).....

Much love from the High Sierra,
Christina

This paranoid and groundless frenzy has been fomented and promoted by
a shameless collection of lunatics and losers; crooks, cranks,
demagogues and opportunists, who claim the existence of a top secret
master plan to join the U.S. , Canada and Mexico in one big
super-state and to replace the good old Yankee dollar with a worthless
new currency called 'The Amero'.

Did you dress in pink?  

Who most perfectly embodied the attitude of "poppin' pink" in costume and personality?

Sigh.  Hopefully Audrey and I will make it to one of these Toanl parties before they get reduced to teal and puse...

Peace,

Peter

P.S. Pink is the new black.

>From the Nigerian Tribune:

"There is a secretive sexual practice common to both men and women, as well
as young people, and it is known as masturbation. A team of scientists in
Australia recently found that 98 per cent of men engage in this sexual act,
while many women cannot also feign ignorance on this sexual act. In fact,
they revealed that 89 per cent of females also practise [sic] masturbation.
Your Health findings show that this habit is no respecter of age, as many
young boys and girls are also aware of what masturbation is all about."

This was a seriously funny movie. I laughed so hard at
one point that I farted! Of course, the fart occurred
during the most quiet part of the film, and led to the
entire theatre, including me, laughing hysterically at
me...

So, I got to laugh at myself, as well as the movie...
Don't be afraid to get dragged to this one for a date
movie, it was worth it.

Speaking of Paul...

After Die Maschinen Saturday I got asked by somebody "Paul Oakenfold?  
You heard of him?"

"Ya"

"Is he Industrial?"

"What?"

"His music, is it Industrial?"

"Dude.  That's Techno."

Now, anyone who has heard me bitch about recent "industrial" music

Ya' know I was thinking about just that:)  Like I would dress up in a  
black fedora, black scarf and dark glasses.  Go for a stroll on the  
beach path and do a wheel chair version of Isadora Duncan.

I know "Spinal Invasion"  has a downer tone.  I wrote it when I first  
came home and was greeted with a giant hospital bed in the middle of  
the living room and all the rest.  Kind of despair set in.

Then Joey gave me all the cards and very moving emails sent to him  
and me from you loving ravers during my hospitalization.  I'm feeling  
like a real weight around the world's neck right now.  Your comments  
made me realize that I have people to live for.

Much love,

Apoll

Ugh.

After all that, please don't.

Seriously, gallows humor is one thing, but...

I don't even know what to say to that.

Maybe I'll find it funny later, I guess.

Speaking for myself, I got goosebumps, good ones, when I saw that you 
wrote us.

Despair has been the last 2 and half months of not knowing.

Yeah, and you being around keeps me going too.

Much love to Joey. If I were currently local I'd take him to the best

I wouldn't call it an ideal date movie.

It was damn good, funny, and carried well.  But, I was on a date with a 
woman who was a little bit more straight edged than I, so seeing this 
movie about a woman who has her shit together, in this situation with a 
guy who is a beer guzzlin/stoner/music lover/still likes to make fart 
jokes with his friends/has trouble taking things too seriously 
sometimes...

I could see how this might affect perceptions on a first date (but not of 
me of course).

Andy,

are you insinuating that you got somebody pregnant,
are now trying to prove yourself worthy of husbandry,
cleaned up, tuned in to the corporate megalyth, and
will soon be reading parenting books and going to
sleep at 8:30?

LOL...

I could see the squirming element for all us "other
side of the coin" meets corporate beauty folks...

Was hilarious... and my girl laughed as hard at me as
I did...

Speaking of DJ tech talk.

Check out this dirt cheap $200 Behringer laptop DJ controller.  I mean,
for that price, just buy it for the toy value.  It even includes a copy
of Tractor LE:

Eff that Behringer trash - here's where it's at:

http://www.musiciansfriend.com/product/Vestax-VCI100-Tabletop-DJ-MIDI-Controller?sku=630189&src=3WFRWXX

I have seen it up close and personal - it rocks socks. You can even rock 4 
"decks" at once (if you are that special anyway) with it.

Behringer doesn't have the best reputation, and that controller in
particular has gotten less than optimal reviews in forums and magazines.

Better controllers (in no particular order):

Controllers from Faderfox (http://www.faderfox.com)
M-Audio (http://www.m-audio.com):
    * Trigger Finger
    * X-Session Pro
    * Connectiv
Kontrol-DJ (http://www.kontrol-dj.com/):
Novation Music (http://www.novationmusic.com/):
    * Remote SL Zero (or one of the bigger models w/ keys)
Allen & Heath X:One 3D
Korg Zero8

and there are others...

To get some hands on experience and talk shop, you should stop by
robotspeak on haight:
http://www.robotspeak.com/

Checking Traktor[1] and Ableton Live[2] forums is also a good idea.
The Kontrol DJ[3] site above has some decent forum chatter from time
to time, and there is also the Ableton Live DJ[4] forum that has
forums dedicated to controllers and an Ableton Live Wiki[5]
that probably has some controller infos.

[1] http://www.native-instruments.com/index.php?id=forum_us
[2] http://www.ableton.com/forum/index.php
[3] http://kontrolprodj.com/component/option,com_wrapper/Itemid,23/
[4] http://www.abletonlivedj.com/
[5] http://www.teragon.org/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page

If you happen to be using live, there is also a local (bay area) list
that doesn't get much traffic that you can join:

But the Vestax is $500.

I just got one of the new X-Sessions for my VJ Rig:
http://www.m-audio.com/products/en_us/XSessionPro-main.html

Piece of junk compared to their older (less-DJ oriented) model. 
But, it came with a copy of torque so I've been using it as a 
poor-man's audio mixer instead.

If the Berhinger's platter's work halfway decent, at $200 I
might pick one up. I'd like to cue and scratch video like you 
guys. Here's what else I was looking at getting:

hrm....

Decent gear with good faders/knobs and electronics isn't going
to come in at the sub ~$200 price point ($300-$500 at a minimum).

You'll get what you pay for.

The Vestax is $500 cuz it's built like a tank in comparison - not to mention 
you can swap out the faders like any other Vestax mixer. Something tells me 
those other modules aren't quite so easy to repair/replace parts for .

You get what you pay for - if you only pay $200, that's all you gettin'...

I'm sure it'll drop in price soon enough - but from what I've seen of it, 
all it's features considered, it ain't that bad. And it's USB connected - 
plug that bitch in your laptop and go!!!

Yeah, even better to go ogg q10 or a lossless format like flac, aiffc.

All software does DSP on the signal, so the cleaner cocaine you have
before you start cutting stuff in, the better the high.

Oh, wait, we were talking about beats...

Okay, well, just for the record...

I currently own 3 peices of Behringer gear.. a slider MIDI controller,
a small mixer, and a multiband compression box.  All of these are rock
solid.  I use them in the studio, take them to gigs, etc, and I have
yet to have a single problem.

I own one little Vestax mixer and it is a peice of crap.  the cue bleeds
right through to the main mix.  

You can dismiss Behringer all you want on features.  But I am quite happy

Yeah, but I don't have just a laptop. My rig is
out-of-control big, right now I'm using matched laptops and
midi controllers for video. I've used some really cool MIDI
controllers, but it just seems the DJ-oriented ones (with jog
wheels) are unecessarily large, well for me they are.

I'd love a simplified compact model with jog wheels where I
could fit 2 in my existing VJ coffin. But I don't think that's
gonna happen for a long while.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Cross Fading or Volume Controlling?

I'm not saying they are totally worthless - but I have found that for the 
gear you hammer on more than normal (like a mixer), they suck ass for 
longevity. That being said, I suppose you could always replace most of their 
crap 2 times before you reached the typical value of their competitors 
stuff. Kind of like buying multiple crappy used cars instead of a brand new 
one.

Tuesday, July 3rd, 2007
@ Mighty (119 Utah)
10pm-4am
Presales: Limited $7, then $10
Door tickets: $10 b4 11:30 & $15 afterwards
21+ w/ID


Evil Breaks, Sister SF, In Deep, along with the new addition, the
Ambient Mafia, will be teaming up to bring you a 4th of July party
celebration you're not going to forget. And since everyone has the
following day off, why not come and spend your Tuesday night in
debaucherous style with us at one of the best venues in the city??
Many of us know and love the music of our headliner, Carbon Community,
but noone has seen him do his Live show in SF since we brought him out
waaaay back in December of 2005. Dave will also be bringing out his
drummer Pete who will be playing on his full drum kit, along with Dave
bangin away on his synths & hanging drums. Carbon Community Live has
been constantly compared to Uberzone's Live show, and with the
addition of the hanging, light-up drums, it just might be taking it
one step further. If you missed seeing Carbon Community Live the last
time they were out here you really need to come see how amazing a Full
Live PA can be.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Cross Fading or Volume Controlling?

Behringer deejay gear sucks right out of the box. Especially their 
mixers. It doesn't matter how cheap or easy it is to replace parts, they 
all suck. Fuck longevity, I refuse to play on that DJM600 ripoff brand new.

Now some of their PA gear is well worth what you pay for it. I've got a 
Eurorack UB902 that I bought for less than $100 new and I couldn't ask 
for anything more from it. It sounds and performs beautifully! Just stay 
away from their DJ mixers.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Internet Radio "Day of Silence"

FWIW, when I was at Live365.com I had the displeasure of meeting with their chief counsel Steve marks in the RIAA's DC offices.  This was maybe seven years ago now. It was clear then that the RIAA was interested in killing Internet radio.  At that time their angle was "stream ripping" which in case you don't know is the (possibly illegal) recording of an Internet streaming broadcast.

The RIAA wants to kill Internet radio for one simple reason: control.  They want to be able to control what music people hear, so they can influence what they buy.  With terrestrial (AM/FM) radio the recorning industry felt they had lost control of their content, allowing broadcasting companies such as ClearChannel to benefit from their properties without paying the RIAA.  The law in the U.S. requires radio stations to pay only the songwriter not the performing artists, hence the radio stations pay ASCAP/BMI but not the RIAA.

The RIAA has been determined from day one not to let the same scenario happen with respect to Internet radio, and hence has sought ways to force Internet radio to pay even when AM/FM broadcasters wouldn't have to.  And the rates set where 

The punch line to the whole story is the establishment of SoundExchange, originally as part of the RIAA and now operating as a "independent" entity (the RIAA and its member companies still control a large group of SX board seats).  SoundExchange is the entity that collects and "distributes" the money from the various Internet radio broadcasters and satellite boradcasters to the labels and artists supposedly under a 50/50 split.  

The thing is, that really something like 70% the money distributed is distributed to the labels and only 30% goes to the artists, because SX claims they can't find many of the artists in order to pay them (http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20060921/192446.shtml) Former SX counsel told me that they only find and pay 40% of the artists, while (of course) they *can* find the labels and pay them over 90% of the time.  

Many artists getting Internet play just aren't getting paid at all.  But SoundExchange collects money for these broadcasts anyway and holds it for three years when it "escheats" to SX to offset costs.  Note that since the labels get the bulk of the distributions from SX, that decreasing SX's costs benefits the labels most.  There there are those "administrative fees" (http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20070607/092053.shtml) that the broadcasters somehow forgot to oppose, but that's another story I guess.

The problem is that the Internet radio business is just isn't that great of a business.  None of these operations are making much money and certainly not enough to pay these new rates.  In the end many may be forced to shut down and therefore will pay SX zero.  And yet the head of SoundExchange and the RIAA continues to promote the higher rates.  Why? Because control over what people hear is more important than the measily revenues they are getting from Internet radio today.  Consider how much the industry has paid in payola and "independent marketing" fees (http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/10/22/spitzer_targets_musiclabels/ and http://www.daveyd.com/lettertofcc.html)

The RIAA wants to silence independent Internet radio once and for all.  That's been the agenda since the founding of SoundExchange and has been obvious since the early demands for ridiculous and even impossible listener reporting requirements (http://www.futureofmusic.org/news/CARPreplycomments.cfm)  

Why? They don't want you to be able to choose from 50 channels of techno, Tuvan throat singing, or the latest Bulgarian death metal whenever you want.  Too much choice makes it much harder to get the consumer's attention and that means higher marketing costs and lower profits.

So while I support the broadcasters, I feel that a day (or week, or month, etc.) of silence is just exactly what the RIAA wants.   Why give them what they want?  Instead of a day of silence, how about a day of music sharing links to broadcasts (for example) that originate outside the U.S. and do not pay the RIAA or SX?

Here's some non-RIAA funding radio from Germany for example: http://www.infectedradio.com/content/

Peace,

Peter

"No wonder kids grow up crazy," the midget says. "A cat's cradle is  
nothing but a bunch of X's between somebody's hands, and little kids  
look and look and look at all those X's..."
"And?"
"No damn cat, and no damn cradle."
-Kurt Vonnegut

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of  
the rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will  
gradually become visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

Thanks for the link!  This is exactly what I thought of in this current 
instance.  I don't care to cave in and let people of this ilk succeed. 
I'd hope others feel the same.

Subject: [sfraves] Techno Question for Andy W....

Sometimes Techno mixes sound to be off measure wise to
me. I can do the math on a single, and sometimes they
seem "normal" and sometimes odd... Like high-hats
coming in on the down beats, kicks later, and patterns
that seem off. Whats the deal? I know there is numbers
difference betroit6 Detroit/Chicago vs German/Euro

Enlighten me please....

Part of this goes back to a time when I had Mattski
play at our room at the first Mega-Buzz... One of
biggest systems I had ever played on. It was so loud,
the reverb off the walls so gnarly, and I was so
stoked to have pulled off the main room at home bass
for the $2000 budget I was given... Anyhow, at times I
seriously could not tell if it was a train wreck or
perfectly ordered kaos. I believe it was the latter. I
just remember hard beats with an off shuffle, with one
elastic tweaker sound on each track that just made it
all melt into craziness.

Evil Breaks, Sister SF, In Deep, along with the new addition,
the Ambient Mafia, will be teaming up to bring you a 4th of
July party celebration you're not going to forget. And since
everyone has the following day off, why not come and spend your
Tuesday night in debaucherous style with us at one of the best
venues in the city??

Many of us know and love the music of our headliner, Carbon
Community, but noone has seen him do his Live show in SF since
we brought him out waaaay back in December of 2005. Dave will
also be bringing out his drummer Pete who will be playing on
his full drum kit, along with Dave bangin away on his synths &
hanging drums. Carbon Community Live has been constantly
compared to Uberzone's Live show, and with the addition of the
hanging, light-up drums, it just might be taking it one step
further. If you missed seeing Carbon Community Live the last
time they were out here you really need to come see how amazing
a Full Live PA can be.

Any sequencer that's going to be in use today is at least 96PPQ-  
newer ones will be 384-
So that means that you can stick sounds in very wrong-sounding, yet  
still in-beat places.

You are at the mercy of the producer :D

Subject: RE: [sfraves] tonal review

Yeah that was probably the best party I've ever been a part of, great music,
crazy insanity vibe, perfect venue, packed but not overpacked, completely
eclectic mix of people, etc. I was sooo happy with how everything turned
out.

I'd have to give Natalie the "poppin' pink" award for her outfit.  Pics from
the night are up on Nitevibe now n stuff.

Next up is Tonal: Fade to Black on August 11th with our biggest lineup yet:

Jeno
M3
Galen
Leonard
Worthy
Sen-Sei & Andrew Phelan
Syd Gris
Eric Sharp
Michael Anthony
The Fingermonsters feat. Audio Angel
Rouzbeh
Sharon Buck
Michael Tello
Jimmy B

Full info soon...

I don't know why - the coke here in SF sucks donkey balls for the most part. 
I have had some that is ok - but nothin;'compared to what the Jamaicans 
slung in DC.

Like, if it doesn't make your whole fuckin' head numb after a rail, what's

Not too tough to figure out I think- with the web on its second wind  
the salaries have been going up a lot around here and the whole feel  
has become more "decadent".

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Is EVERYBODY on coke now? WTF?

I think it's just due to the drop in prices (I've seen blow go for $30/gram of late!), a shift in the focus of the city's party people from happy huggy raving to dirty techy parties, and, like JC says, a not-exactly-celebratory near-decade in our country's history.

I met some australians that were used to $200+ prices per gram in their native land.  They bought 6 or 8 grams here, out of sheer novelty- and subsequently went batshit.

Personally, I hate the shit.  I just wish it were easier for people to turn away.  There's a reason they call it "candy".  That said, I don't like E much lately either.  

Or weed.

..so I guess I'm sort of disqualified from the proceedings.

Touche! A lot of my friends attribute the rise of coke use out here to the rise of electro, but I'm on the fence on that one. That's like saying prog. trance is the only reason e got so big. 

Trendy, me thinks. Good point about the regressive rule.

I've noted this at the few parties I've been at recently as well.  Personally I don't like the stuff and I really don't like the effect it has on certain people.  I guess I saw too many people do too many stupid and self destructive things related to cocaine back in the eighties.  

Coke liars in particular annoy me.  What's up with coke use and lying?  The two seem to go together like peanut butter and jelly.

Peace,

Peter

I don't mind it in moderation, but I find myself less and less into the 
chemicals and more plain ol' happy with weed & booze. Uppers tend to only be 
used for keeping me awake more than a high...

I was just about to mention the Hipsters and their rampant use of the stuff.

Caught several people holding at work this past weekend.  No shocker

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Internet Radio "Day of Silence"


Can anyone explain to me the difference betwween these "Fee collections 
on behalf of artists" and a "Neighborhood Insurance" shake down racket?

I mean seriously.  When your whole business is going to other people and 
extracting funds, without actually doing or producing anything, you are 
a leech.  What's SX's percentage the keep even when they find the 
artist, and really, how are are they looking?

Fight the power, Free radio now!

But SoundExchange collects money for these broadcasts anyway and holds it for three years when it "escheats" to SX to offset costs.  Note that since the labels get the bulk of the distributions from SX, that decreasing SX's costs benefits the labels most.  There there are those "administrative fees" (http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20070607/092053.shtml) that the broadcasters somehow forgot to oppose, but that's another story I guess.

In the end many may be forced to shut down and therefore will pay SX zero.  And yet the head of SoundExchange and the RIAA continues to promote the higher rates.  Why? Because control over what people hear is more important than the measily revenues they are getting from Internet radio today.  Consider how much the industry has paid in payola and "independent marketing" fees (http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/10/22/spitzer_targets_musiclabels/ and http://www.daveyd.com/lettertofcc.html)

Is it common for raves to have a house dealer set up in back? Some babe was
cutting lines under a little blacklight setup when I went to a rave promoted
on bayraves. It was pretty easy to discrimate who was rolling at that party
and who was on coke.

I'm pretty new to the rave scene, but it's upsetting to see people at a rave
doing an ego-hardening drug. It gave the night a dirty edge (some asshole
borrowed my weed pipe and smoked coke bowls with it, tasted awful
afterward).

It made me feel more inclined to be around candy kids. At least they're
rolling balls, and even if it just involves giving away ugly bracelets, it's
nice to feel empathy at a party. That's why I went.

Coke sucks, I demand molly.

ah ha!

Think I figured it out...

MATTSKI IS FUCKING INSANE/RETARDED/AHEAD OF HIS TIME/ON ANOTHER PLANE.

He has records that are so incredibly rhythmically nutty, that fall in 
line with a genre usually referred to as "Jack" (usually associated with 
Chicago, but people from Japan to Sweden have released stuff in that 
vibe).  While a few of us in the San Jose techno cabal had a love for this 
(it *is* funky as all hell, and fun to mix, sorta), Mattski and Derek 
Scott could and would play whole sets of this stuff.  Think weird DJ Rush 
stuff, it's something some people just love and others not so much.  It's 
also about twice as hard to mix as something with a more stable count, a 
big part of that genre is setting up swing/shuffle/groove templates that 
are so whack that the snare or hi hats will seem noticably behind.  This 
element exists in a lot of Latin rhythms, but it's pushed to the 
foreground with Jack.  It's also extra fun to mix with a very minimal 
straighter sounding record (really the only way to get in/out of those 
kinds of records).

Rolling basslines, hypnotic repetition, a penchant for almost cartoony 
accents using bits of voice or quirky synth lines, and snare/hihat stuff 
all over the place.  Just really another direction to explore in breaking 
some of the shackles that bind dance music.  Compounding this, a lot of 
these records are genuinely fuckign weird in other ways and have to be 
thrown on a beat other than the one, have strange-count breaks, etc (I 
would actually put star stickers on these records to avoid grabbing them 
when I literally can't see, which also used to happen to me from time to 
time... I have very light sensitive eyes and a good pass across my face 
from a cyberlight or goldenscan would just cripple me for 20 seconds or 
so).

Exactly!  Sounds like you had an open mind about it, but the sound in that 
place was probably a mess.  And another thing about massives, after a 
couple hours of crap at that volume, your hearing just smears anyway.  
It's why I always used to go for a walk right before a set, just give my 
ears a chance to relax and be fresh.

And to be honest, it's a bear to mix on loud systems, especially with back 
wall reverb or a lack of proper monitors (you can't trust the kick, or 
basslines, or snare or hihats exclusively, the "true 1" depends on the 
record).  If anybody has audio of that Moksha party where Chris Jackson 
and I did a 2x4 set, parts of that were Jackin as all hell and I recall 
both of us were in it pretty good (and we were in a damn good mood, Moksha 
Krooo had set us up with a Schmoke and a Pancake and good monitors and a 
12 pack of the olde Nut Brown... although I recall one deck being on the 
fritz), but given that I don't have that set anywhere... (does anyone?).

Here's a set I did for Neulight that should be sorta what you're talking 
about (at least at the start and finish... the middle is more standard 
fare funky techage):

Lemme know if that's kinda what you meant,

I am NOT a fan of techno that sounds like it is off. In fact, I wanna 
cockslap the producers who make stuff like that for wanking off on their 
gear a bit too hard for their own good.

Dance music should be danceable. Period. If it is "off time" or 
"experimental" it is not "dance music". Unless it's made for those who are 
afflicted with the dreaded "no rhythm" disease. In which case, it makes 
sense.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Techno Question for Andy W....

Mind you...all of this music Eric and Andy are talking about IS =20
quantized, ad is most certainly "dance music".  Actually, it's a hell =20=

of a lot more danceable than most shit I hear now-a-days.  The =20
shuffle is heavy, but the tracks are "on time".  They're just swingy =20
and shuffly as all hell.  Which I think sounds funkier than a =20
straight forward "funky" techno track ala Ben Simms/ Samuel L. =20
Sessions etc.  I rarely made a track that didn't have some sort of =20
shuffle or swing to it.  In most case a pretty think shuffle.  =20
Straight 4/4 quantized 1/16  notes sound a bit too "white" to me.  No =20=

soul.  Just straight forward and lame.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Techno Question for Andy W....

Shuffley music is one thing, but there are some techno tracks I have heard 
that straight up sound OFF. That shit is not cool, danceable, or any more 
funky than anything else. In fact, I find things that sound off time to be 
counter-funk, as it ruins any good, steady groove.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Techno Question for Andy W....

James Brown may not be "on" all the time, but his music never throws you off 
a solid groove. I am definitely not saying "all techno" has this affilction 
- but there are some records floating around that are just plain 
off-sounding, and they (at least for ME) fuck the flow up of a set if not 
PERFECTLY dropped into place.

As someone who doesn't just like to mix breakbeat after breakbeat (I play 
4x4 and toss in half-time stuff as well), I understand how to quirk out a 
set a bit - but some of my more "off" sounding tracks just plain sound like 
shit if not dropped in the proper context.  Maybe it's just been my 
misfortune and personal experience that I have heard these wack techno 
tracks, and they have sullied the sets I heard them in.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Techno Question for Andy W....

Techno refers to the philosophical concept of
technique, a key contributor to the development of IT
and virtual machines (computers).  I think Jacques
Ellul put it best "...when technique enters into every
area of life, including the human [including the
human's music] it ceases to be external to man and
becomes his very substance."

That we see best with dave clarke, who has repeatedly
reminded us that Underground anthems are techno, which
go to a core of the collective desire and transform
electronics (experimental, minimal) into something
inate, a vibe. And thus, techno is the ultimate rebel
music, desireing no more to jack (thieve, mercelessly)
the house, fuck u w/ liquid layers of 303, and get
darker than sweedish anarchy death metal, to build-up
driven melody that sounds so sickly sweet it created a
particular type of scenester - candy.

technique applied to dance music has the goal of
making everyone dance. (which may not be simoltaneous)
And by dance, i mean dance to the music, not the
sexual ego demaning attention which represents the
typical house/club atmosphere. Techno is to lose
oneself, an outter body experience that fucks me up
intellectually, physically, and retrospectively more
so than any substance.

as is written in graffiti of aphex twin's windowlicker
music video (an artist who's technique surpassed the
goal and "warped" it into a cd friendly
post-psychadelia product).

TECHNO IS GOD (really)

much love, Morgan Trueblood, Denizen ConeXus

((anyone got a sharpie))

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Is EVERYBODY on coke now? WTF?

Coke is also not very music friendly.

i don't know if u guys ever had the pure shit (which
doesn't exhist in SF) but when u have a nice big line
of that it makes ur ears ring, u can't hear shit, and
that continues to a lesser degree for the entire day.

 maybe k would be a good alternative for snorting
fetishes. Although in a group of 5 i was the only one
who really enjoyed K enough to do get gitty every time
i'm at the right vetenary clinic. However, in the
party monster sense, k and horror mix well, i fell
into a hole watching clock work orange - u'd think
that'd be horrible right? o conttrare (yes my spelling
sux)  it was like  all the blood in my body turned
into a potential orgasim.

people do that, but not enough, we need lots of acid
(lsd 25, the trip of god, and astro-projecting
possibilities) and everyone will forget that coke even
exhists.

if u want to give me a free hit - i can show u a place
where the beat never drops (teather ball

Well, I gave an example of what I was talking about... not sure if you're 
referring specifically to that or some piece of alien math rock or what... 
if someone can find that set I was referring to by me and Chris @ Moksha, 
the whole room (househeads, breakshead, etc) was going apeshit... plenty 
of SFravers were there, it went off despite some deep shuffled jack-style 
stuff.  Ironically, the DJ after us played "straighter" Belgian/German 
minimal style techno and lost most of the dance floor in short order.  
Ooops, looks like someone left out the "fun" in that set, bing bong!  EZ 
to dance to, sure, but why...

Referring to the original post from Eric, Mattski is a damn good DJ, one 
of the best in town.  He can play house that will totally fucking drop 
science on your head.  He can also drop some techno that is pretty 
fucking out there with this wickedly swung groove.  I support him as an 
artist, he's brave and soulful and visceral and fun and he's had me 
dancing like my feet are on fire on many occasions.

-&e->Dance music should be danceable. Period. If it is "off time" or
-&e->"experimental" it is not "dance music". Unless it's made for those who are
-&e->afflicted with the dreaded "no rhythm" disease. In which case, it makes
-&e->sense.

It's called funk, it's called soul, it's called flavor, and yes, it's fun 
to make and creative and can go too far for some people.  It's called 
pushing the art form, and it is the life force of all creative movements.  
Without this element of music we'd all be playing Amazing Grace and 
Gregorian chants.  I'm not saying everything that's weird is good, far 
from it... but when someone can make/play effective compelling dance music 
that's well outside the same old shit, I for one tend to be STOKED.

I would way rather hear a DJ take 20 risks and have a couple land wrong 
and a couple just be insanely good than some fucking douchebag playing a 
pre-picked set of sleepily similar garbage.  It's the difference between 
experiencing a performing musician who happens to use other people's 
records as their real time collage, and some uptight dork taking a test 
where there's a "right" and "wrong" answer for each "mix here point".  
It's like a lot of the "techno" I keep hearing at clubs around town... 
wake me up when you do something for a change instead of mixing soulless 
tech-house garbage I've heard a thousand times before.  Just like when I 
see a live band, I don't want perfection, i want jamming, improv, fun, and 
not exactly what I heard on the record.  In the digital age, making a 
perfect Xerox is *way* easy, it's coming up with some whammy on things, 
flexing a bit that makes it fun.

As long as we've got our cocks out ready to slap, I wanna fucking 
schlongpummel anybody who makes boring formulaic shit that's been done a 
thousand times over and has the nerve to call it "progressive" or new in 
any way.  32 beat cliches abound in almost every genre nowadays, the 
builds and breakdowns are all kinda the same lately, who's making the real 
shit?  Where the fucking artists at?  As we move more and more towards 
tools like Ableton Live, "beat" tools that "fix" loops so the beats are 
right on the 16s... music is getting further and further from a 
manifestation of human rhythm with shuffle and accents and becoming 
metronomic and cold preset- punching genre correct commodity crap.  
Seriously, modern dance music with little exception is in a state of this 
morbid manifestation of the addage "those who cannot remember the past are 
condemned to repeat it".

over and over and over again

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Techno Question for Andy W....

I dunno - some amount of formula to dance music doesn't bother me that bad. 
It's when I hear a sound or style formula go ape-shit and rampant that I 
tend to get bored a bit more easily. (read - I don't wanna hear the same 
fucking "style" being mirrored and repeated till it's beat to death and you 
can no longer distinguish between artists)

I don't mind some experimentation and risk with production or performance - 
I agree it helps in some situations. But, I have heard some bands/DJ's go a 
bit too far with warping their material, and some who could've stood to do 
something a bit less (or more) than an exact copy of the original.

It all really boils down to how the artist works the material. Either they 
will work what they have, or they won't. Just because a track is "different" 
than the norm doesn't make it any good. and just because a track is very 
"the norm" doesn't make it bad. Some people can just execute the idea better 
than others.

Sorta like the Ramones - they played music that is EASY copied/ripped off. A 
billion bands (like Green Day for instance) have capitalized on their idea 
to some success, but you know damn well that NO ONE has done it to the 
perfection the Ramones did. (and no, just because Green Day has sold a 
billion albums does not mean what they have done with that style is 
innovative or interesting - it just means people are fucking sheep and will 
buy what is forcefed them). They (the Ramones) knew how to execute that 
sound/style/vibe to perfection whereas others can try and can even be 
technically "perfect", but they will never get that "it" factor into the 
music.

I think it's just due to the drop in prices (I've seen blow go for $30/gram of late!), a shift in the focus of the city's party people from happy huggy raving to dirty techy parties, and, like JC says, a not-exactly-celebratory near-decade in our country's history.

I met some australians that were used to $200+ prices per gram in their native land.  They bought 6 or 8 grams here, out of sheer novelty- and subsequently went batshit.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Is EVERYBODY on coke now? WTF?

LOL I was a bit older than that at the time. ;)

Actually I lived in LA for most of the eighties.  It was a really weird time for me personally.

We went to the Palace a lot, some underground punk parties, the Cat and Fiddle pub (and many other bars, pubs, etc.) and we also sometimes frequented this super snotty club in Beverly Hills.  I got invited to join by this girl I knew that was friends with Cher's PA or something stupid like that.  In LA it seems like everyone knows someone famous.  The club's name was a number, but damn if I can remember it.  Rod Stewart was a member and also some other famous type people.  They had a dance floor that changed colors and was lit from below.  Lots of blow.  Everywhere.  People snorted right at the tables.

But I was already really down on coke by then because of the damage I had seen done during my college years and so I did not partake.  

But I sure drank a lot during the eighties.  Phew.  

Peace,

Peter

P.S. I'll take bad hair over NO hair!

Anybody old enough to have been in their upper teen years through the 80's
can see the parallels between now and then. Inflation, corporate power and
bad hair...  So it's no surprise to me that the shit is back too.

History repeating itself in front of our eyes.

Wow... I said something.

I've noted this at the few parties I've been at recently as well.
Personally I don't like the stuff and I really don't like the effect it has
on certain people.  I guess I saw too many people do too many stupid and
self destructive things related to cocaine back in the eighties.  

Coke liars in particular annoy me.  What's up with coke use and lying?  The
two seem to go together like peanut butter and jelly.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Is EVERYBODY on coke now? WTF?

I do drink on occasion- I find it to be a low-commitment social lubricant, and fun, as long as I don't overdo it.  I was mainly speaking to the fact that my zeal for inebriants in general has faded significantly of late.  I still dig a good hard party night now and again, but I find I value a clear head a lot more these days.  

I've been to a number of parties lately, that start out great great great, friendly, everyone smiling and laughing and dancing...  ...until somebody shows up with blow or gets a bug up their butt about finding some, and then people descend into shady, secretive, fiendy BS.  It's so sad!  It's like "oh great, we have to do this now, awesome.", like somebody changing the channel from Discovery to QVC.  Cellphones come out, people lock themselves in bedrooms, etc.

I love plenty of people that love coke, but it sure sucks to see them metamorphose on it.  Or to feel compelled to jump in myself so I can be on the same wavelength.

I've noticed a lot of this too. It probably has a lot to do with
'thizz' and the steep decline and stepping-on of thizz pills.
Ghettonomics has determined that people in a crowd can't tell what's
in your pills, and if you put just a taste of mdma in there, it will
have people coming back to find you and hand over more $10 bills.
Meanwhile, the meth kicks in and it suddenly makes sense to pop a few
more in hopes of catching the ecstatic euphoria. Eventually, your
customers don't even mind that there's no E in your Es, because now
they /want/ the tweak.

My point being, here, that the decline in quality in raves' #1 drug
means all those kids that 'just want to have fun' are going to search
out drugs with a more reliable effect. The interest in cocaine will
probably wane as the coked out dealers get greedier and step on THEIR
shit more and more

...and then we'll all be on OCs, because the drug companies are the
only ones pushing fixed dose reliable crack! Buy Pfizer.

Acid's great, but I can't picture tripping at a rave, unless it had the
perfect vibe. I've been rolling and seen shit where I've been glad I wasn't
on acid/shrooms at the time...When you find stuff like people shaking from
amphetamine overload and looking nervous at a rave, it's great to feel
empathy in your blood so you can go up, talk to them and offer to smoke them
out. I think if I were tripping, that would freak me out and I wouldn't be
able to add anything to the experience.

And fuck methy pills! Maybe this shit went out the window years ago, I saw
some video about it in high school, but why isn't there anything like
DanceSafe tents at raves? Some of their kits just tell you "there's e in
this pill" but other kits can breakdown fairly well the contents of a pill.
Does this just not gel with promoters/venues, as if it confirms there are
drugs in the building? My next roll is at Space Girls, hopefully Santa Cruz
throws down the molly...

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: IsEVERYBODY on coke now? WTF?

Personally, I think it is retarded to talk about your
drug use on a public list. It might be ok to talk
about the effects of drugs on the scene, a particular
incident, etc... But from a personal standpoint, you
should always think twice about documenting your
debauchery... You never know when it might come from
nowhere to bite you in the ass...

Think not? What about getting a DUI, or Drunk in
Public, or possession charge under an overzealous new
DA trying to make a point... and they "happen" to know
about list-serves on the internet... and after they
confiscate your comupter find you are on sfr, read the
logged messages, and have your personal account of
behavior...

Think i'm crazy? I've seen it happen... in the last
year... fortunately to a scumbag GHB, coke, K, meth
dealer that tried to crash his way into our group of
friends. Luckily, I politely excused him from our
group 18 months before he went down, as he was way
sketchy, overt, braggered, and pushing NASTY stuff
like GHB on everyone...

Just a thought...

You make an excellent point.  Lotsa drama involved with coke and those who
use it...

It's hard to avoid drama when you're trying to answer life's deepest
questions. Such as, 'where can we get more blow?'

So this mix found it's way onto my hard drive a couple of weeks ago. I have
no idea who's responsible for it, but you should check it out regardless. .

Subject: [sfraves] Wanna buy vinyl??? READ ME


This is only gonna apply to those that can *physically* come see/hear shit, 
cuz I just don't have time to catalog my records and give a list.

I am moving this weekend and wanna lighten my load, plus I need money bad as 
hell right now (moving is muy expensivo).

Now before people freak out and tell me not to sell my vinyl...I am only 
selling stuff I can get on MP3 (cuz I can play CD's and Final Scratch/Serato 
now). Mainly breaks and tech-funk, but there is some techno, tech-house, and 
other assorted crap in there as well. Preferrably people who wanna come hear 
this shit either tonight or tomorrow will scooby on this ASAP....

I will be selling most titles for around $2 - $3 a record.

Stuff *not* for sale (i.e. rare/white labels/booties/etc.)  MAY be bartered 
for, but it's not gonna be nearly as cheap in all honesty (there's a reason 
it's not in the normal "for sale" list). Tons of this stuff is fairly new 
condition, and relatively recent - so maybe you missed getting some titles 
on vinyl and don't have the ability to rock MP3's (or just plain prefer 
vinyl). This sale is FOR YOU :)

Message me off list to schedule time to come sift/needle drop...I live at 
3rd Avenue & Geary in SF.

If you want to spot the coke heads, install more black lights,

Um...why not? They are cheaper than vinyl, easier to attain than vinyl, 
lighter than vinyl, etc.

I still love my analog, but I am utilizing the technology that is available 
to me. Being poor, I don';t have scads of cash to toss away on the black 
crack. Plus now i can get a single track rather than having to buy a whole 
12" of something I may only play one side of. That is a bad thing?

Nah, I actually can't hear the difference between a 320kbps mp3 and a wave, but it's not much more to buy the uncompressed version of the song, just incase.

I think digital sounds fine, the highs just hit a little too hard sometimes.

I still love my analog, but I am utilizing the technology that is available 
to me. Being poor, I don';t have scads of cash to toss away on the black 
crack. Plus now i can get a single track rather than having to buy a whole 
12" of something I may only play one side of. That is a bad thing?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Wanna buy vinyl??? READ ME

Who not? It's not cool? I admit it. Who fucking cares? Even when I had a 
love affair with vinyl I never would hate on a jock for playing CDs, so 
long as he/she was actually deejaying.

Am I less of a deejay because I play CDs now after 10 years of 
collecting records? I say no. The only people that care are record nerds 
anyways. And I've always hated those people for the most part. Usually 
working at the record stores and hording anything remotely rare so that 
it never makes its way to the sales floor where us "normal people" can 
buy them. But it's just not that, they usually are the WORST deejays.  
Fucking record nerds.

I haven't bought a record in about 11 months now and I'm proud of it. 
I'll still play some old records when there are 1200s at a party, only 
old stuff I haven't sold yet though. Anyone want any records? I've got 
about 3,000 to go!

It's hard to avoid drama when you're trying to answer life's deepest
questions. Such as, 'where can we get more blow?'

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Techno Question for Andy W....

That pretty much answered my question. Some of it came
to mind as I was going through records for "BACK ON
TRACK" this weekend. I have a lot of techno records
that I like, but never play. Lots from the late 90's
and early 00's. When I was listening to them, many had
production oddities, some written in 12 bar fashion,
some 8, some 16, and some seemingly without any
numerical resolution at all. Just got me thinking
back, whether this was a trend to be "different", a
visit to the world of musically ignorant but sonically
cool, etc... 

The "I put a sticker on some records" was really the
answer for me... lets me know that yes, some shit is
just wrong... but sounds cool anyhow.

*that depends how u define a dj - some one who makes
clean matches and gives the crowd exaxtly what they
want to hear, a dj like Carl Cox or Dj Icey, or a
dj/electronic experimenter who may fuck up on occasion
but tries new techniques to gauge the audience
response, like dave clarke or claude young - I mean
fuck, Dave clarke would scrartch using filters from a
kaos pad, while using the fader, i don't know how
someone could do that w/out 3 hands, and sure if Pro
tools has some new plugin the perfectly replicates
that style, that's great

but dave clarke was doing it live in 1995, (perfected
in the famous essential mix in 98).

sure he fucks up, but sometimes it's purposefull and
to disrupt the audiences expectations.

[lurker here] Never heard Dave Clarke live, so yeah, I don't doubt he trainwrecks some.  But K7's Electroboogie Vol 3 is one of the greatest electro mixes of all time, and probably one of the bigger latent subconscious seeds for the later resurgence of electro... IMHO.

BRUNO PRONSATO

Seattle via Berlin producer Bruno Pronsato (aka Steven Ford) took several
giant steps in 2005 toward the peak of the experimental techno mountain.
Both on vinyl and onstage, Pronsato kept up a hectic pace of production and
performance, catalyzing listeners and crowds in Germany, Switzerland,
Turkey, Mexico, throughout the United States, and a triumphant set at
Montreal's MUTEK festival. Twelve-inches on esteemed labels like Orac,
Musique Risqu=E9e, Milnor Modern, Philpot, and Telegraph further elevated h=
is
stature and built his international fan base.

A sound scientist whose work is equally playful and rigorous, Pronsato
deploys a canny use of space and idiosyncratically fashioned rhythms to
disorient and build suspense=97like some 21st-century Miles Davis or Eric
Dolphy of the laptop. Despite being a minimal-techno artist, Pronsato offer=
s
a palette that's as full of unexpected patterns and meticulously rendered
textures as a Wassily Kandinsky painting.

Pronsato's compositions unsettle in original ways, yet they also slyly
tickle funnybones. Often both humorous and erotic, his cuts are the wild
cards that adventurous DJs pull out when they want to take the dance floor
to strange new levels of motion. Therefore, Pronsato's releases have become
elite selectors' secret weapons of beguilingly baffling quirkiness that
still move asses.

Unsurprisingly, 2006 is promising to be as eventful as last year. As demand
for his music has waxed, Pronsato has accordingly increased his productivit=
y
while maintaining his usual exacting quality control standards. March will
bring Pronsato's debut 12 for Hello? Repeat while summer 2006 will see EPs
issued by Orac and Telegraph (watch for the last two editions of the
four-part Limeworks series), plus another collaboration with Argentinean
Franco Cinelli for Milnor Modern (Picaro, their first joint effort from lat=
e
'05, contains some of Pronsato's most flavorful club bangers). A temporary
residence in Holland will enable Pronsato to spend even more time in 2006
devastating European audiences with his uniquely psychedelic and funky
techno live sets.

DRUMCELL

Founder of Droid Recordings and co-founder of Droid Behavior, Drumcell (aka
Mohamed "Moe" Espinosa) has been one of techno's greatest allies in Souther=
n
California in recent times. A graduate of the Musician's Institute and a
long-time performer at parties in Southern California, Drumcell has been
influenced by music from his earliest years. After being exposed to raves i=
n
the early 90s, He grew addicted to the sounds of acid house, techno, in its
many forms, and industrial.

It was not long before he was copping turntables to satisfy his vinyl
fetish. By the early age of 14 he was playing in various local bands, and
through out the rest of his teenage years, cut his teeth-producing hip hop
records, dub and various forms of electronic music on Los Angeles based
underground labels. By combining his production, DJing and networking skill=
s
and focusing in on his more mature musical tastes he soon established
himself as one of the major players in LA's growing techno scene.

Associating with the members of Acid Circus to form Droid Behavior as an
event production group and record label was the next logical step to raise
awareness for techno in the city and to help expose local Artists,
established djs, and performers from around the country.

Over the last 5 years Drumcell has rocked parties from big to small on a
weekly basis in LA as well as gigs all over the U.S alongside such names as
Kenny Larkin, John Tejada, Tim Xavier, Daniel Bell, Ben Sims, Adam Beyer,
Jeff Mills, Speedy J, Ritchie Hawtin, Mathew Dear, etc. and has also
released quite a few heavy tracks on labels Omniscient, Remains, Heavy
Industries, and his own DROID Recordings imprint.

Drumcell has been known to keep on the edge of technology and continuously
pushing the limits to what the future has to offer.He is always in the
process of developing homebrew software as well as cutting edge hardware
solution to bring a fresh innovative taste to his production and
performances. When performing, Drumcell can be seen blurring the lines
between a live and a DJ set by utilizing tools such as FX processors,
samplers, drum machines and other devices  to weave a thick blend of acidic
techno and aggressive but funky minimalist groove to ensure a frenzy amongs=
t
his listeners.

With the state of electronic music in North America leaning towards strippe=
d
down funk rather then progressive fluff these days, Droid has become the
center for LA techno and Drumcell remains steadfast in his mission of
putting this city on the global map.

Subject: [sfraves] My new mix - A Decade of Deep

Hi everyones, so I just finished a new mix and it's probably my favorite
I've ever done.  120bpm deep, melodic, atmospheric house music:

Also all of my old mixes are available here:

Enjoy!

Subject: [sfraves] [BSP] Update on Joel Mull at Fat City tonight

Since many folks have asked, Joel Mull will be performing with a
combination of vinyl, fx and Abelton Live.

He will be the last act of the evening, going on well after Midnight,
so if you're hitting other parties, you can definately catch Joel's
unique set.

If anybody would like to get a 10 discount for early arrival before
10:30, we're still accepting RSVPs. Please email to: info@babd.org

Actually, I remember when Joel Mull was supposed to play at the DNA lounge 
when Shane had his weekly.  Then 9/11 happened.  My at-the-time-gf's 
birthday was on the 13th so I put her us up in this hotel nearby.

Our plan was to see him, so that's what I mean by I've been waiting to see 
him for years.  :)

love always
