best post yet
props, apollo.

it's tough bein' a raver in the states these days.
i resorted to being a gypsy just to hump speakers to good t3kno.
the gas prices are killing me and the soundsystems are becoming more the 
size of mine.

i'm not sure what the hell happened, but i'm hearing it from everyone.
this doesn't even fit into the "old & jaded" category.

i've even started to go to salsa & swing clubs just to find some real 
dancers.
it's beautiful & all but their lasers,     well..........

now i guess we've all become what we were supposed to be,

consumers.
shall we drink at a club now????

Subject: Re: [sfraves] (nrr) wasvNew Plan..Now sfraves

Maybe the decline has more to do with the staggering economy (esp'ly)
in SF rather than 9/11. If u got half the city's hi-tech employees
getting pink-slips and have to flip burgers or wait tables just to get
by, it's kinda hard to find room for passion. The only spirit
remaining is mere survival.

I don't know if I still want to call myself a raver, I always hated
that term. It's been bastardized, commercialized and routinely
stereotyped. While I still believe in the spirit and will be forever,
it's a loaded label that I'm afraid to put on myself.

Much of our scene has been poisoned by posers and corporatism, so
nowadays I find myself gravitated to the BM crowd (though I'm
definitely a raver not a burner), where love is still pure and
universal like our old days (and I mean REALLY OLD days).

I rarely expect to find love and unity when I go out nowadays, it's
just not there (though I'm sure you have it better in SF). I go out
for my passion for music, and I feel reasonably satisfied most of the
time. Maybe I'm jaded, I don't know.

I do know that I can't change the scene nor the world. But I also know
that I do represent a philosophy, and I try to do my part and go out
and reprazent proper. I think that's the least anyone could do.

I'm sure the scene will thrive again, the love will be rediscovered.
The cycle will continue. Until the next summer of love, I'll just be
hibernating I guess.  LOL

Subject: [sfraves] From moderator: please read

Apollo, Starchild, SFR-listers...

As the moderator of this list (actually I'm only the gnome on duty behind 
the curtain)...I appreciate your exchange. Your expressions are a classic 
debate, although coincidentally happening on the eve of our presidential 
debate...oops, political, bad moderator, bad. ;-)

However, you both bring up good points.

I'm sure Brian would have never believed that his simple attempt to find 
raves here in nor-cal back in '93, plus his adeptness at creating 
discussion lists would bring us here today. I joined this list back in '95 
also to find parties...and *boy* did I find parties =) A large percentage 
of us here found SFRaves the same way.

When I joined, I was impressed that this list was a single stream of 
consciousness, or an "organic community" as stated. It also had an amazing 
level of that "organic" organization in creating events and disseminating 
info on related events. I have learned so much from engaging this list 
from active discussion to personal relations. And the stories produced 
from my experiences due to this list will be retold in my grand-age.

I met Starchild in '96 at Bonnie Dunes at a daytime Harmony party. And 
while our exchanges have been brief, we were strangers by face but family 
as the SFR community. He was one of the PLURy characters on SFR that made 
me believe there was something more than my life at the time.

I met Apollo in '99 at Mission Rock, about a week after he posted to SFR 
about starting the Moksha Tribe. We had a interesting rave-scene 
discussion as strangers by face but more as family of the SFR community.

Perhaps it's just me, but I'm proud to be at the helm of a discussion 
today where these minds can meet, continuing this stream of consciousness.

Enough of my exposition from this point (thanks for listening =)...

While Starchild has returned to SFR charged with politicalism, I still 
read his posts, because while this is "rave" list, we are an "OLD-rave" 
list, and I find find it interesting in reading the political views of my 
peers. This list keeps me grounded in times of uncertainty. And while I 
may not agree with everything that is being said here, I refer here to the 
pulse of others that have gone through the same stuff as I have.

Apollo has passively suggested that our list has become complacent. Low 
signal to the noise, and less of all, which I also acknowledge. The old 
SFRaves dynamic is moving farther away every day, and has been for many 
years. I have no answer to this. We are who we are. This is what it is. 
Many of the people on this list are that same people that have been here 
for years.

SFRaves is a unique list, and it *has* changed, and it will continue to 
change. But I hope you all understand that this list, this discussion, and 
our tangible outcome is *yours*. I'm not here to tell you what to do, or 
what to think, or how to act, or how to learn. None of us are.

We're just here by chance, and *hopefully* have some sort of a shared 
consciousness that we can discuss, learn and grow, and maybe even take 
action...whether it be help us find some cool places to check out, or 
throw some really fun parties for ourselves, or talk about how electronic 
music or raves, or how it changed our lives...or perhaps discuss random 
thoughts, news & events, and yes even ::shudder:: politics...as it relates 
to ourselves.

I'm sure I have much more to say, but y'all do much better job in your 
collective discussion than I. Thanks for listening.

take care,

-terry

My Fellow Americans,

Things are hard. They require hard work, which makes them hard. But we have 
to do these hard things with resolve. We can't send mixed messages about the 
hard things we have to do with resolve. Because they're hard things to do. And 
they require resolve.

And don't forget Poland.

Thank you, and God bless America.

George W. Bush

What a moron. I watched the show last night. It is
interesting to see what he does when he is on his own,
without tele prompt and his croonies backing him up. 

What a moron.

Don't forget:

You can't be critical of my policies during wartime.  What message
does that send the Troops?  Our Allies?  My puppet leader of Iraq?

How can you expect to be Commander in Chief when you don't support
what me, the current Command in Chief, is doing?

you know... i couldn't agree anymore. i argued for
years with my family, who always asked, "when are you
going to grow out of this rave shit?" that as long as
there was a viable scene, i was going to be a part of
it.. 

but these days i'm not.  i haven't been to a "rave" in
god knows how long.. the closed thing i can think of
would be a full moon party on koh phangan this summer,
but even that really isn't the same...

perhaps viable is the key word.. the way this economy
is  with so many of us out of work or struggling on a
salary that hardly makes living in one of the most
expensive cities in the country easy, there is not as
much freedom as we once had.  it costs me $10 in gas
and bridge fare and a 45 minute drive just to go out to
the city for a night, nevermind ticket costs or cover
charges, or other expenses... 

i remember a time when i used to wonder why people
would drink at parties, then slowly i became one of
those people.. the people i threw parties with all
started to move towards club nights and other things...
the love of the music still there, but the drive and
determination to go out and search for underground
venues, to bust ass pulling a one-off together with a
group of friends, to party until 6am then cleaning up
together before heading off for breakfast.... it all
dwindled... we "grew-up" and out of the scene... got
older and started worrying more about the legal
reprucussions in a society more aware and more hostile
to our world... lost the ability and desire to stay up
until all hours of the night, and the idea of crawling
into bed sometime before the sun comes up took the
place of the idea of staying up to watch the sunrise...

i definitely cherrish all the memories, and especially
the friendships formed then, and still hanging on
now... but perhaps i have in a way, "grown out of all
that rave shit".  because i know there are still events
going on now, but maybe im too jaded for it... maybe
the years i had in this scene when it was so much more
alive and thriving ruined me for a scene that seems
struggling to hold on and recreate something that once
just existed.  

i will always hold those memories and experiences in a
special place in my heart, but like everything in life,
there comes a time to evolve... so maybe i'e evolved
with the  music and the friendships i've created and
moved onto other outlets and venues.... 

ok, enough babbling.. this is what happens when i try
to read email before having my morning tea.. ;)

love and hugs and kisses,
tina

Subject: Re: [sfraves] From moderator: please read

Again, I'd like to point out that there are political discussion
lists that are more appropriate. Brian runs a very high-quality one
where a lot of you can *really* get your politics on.  Ask him about
it.

I'm not saying that politics don't ever belong here. We discussed a
LOT of politics in the debacles that eventually led to the formation
of the SFLNC and the SF Entertainment Commission. I consider that
entirely germane.

But I do think that most of the politics lately: "Hey *this* sucks",
"Hey *that* sucks", Bush, Bush, Bush, Bush, Bush, Bush, Iraq, Iraq,
Iraq, Moore, Moore, Bush, Bush, etc. are getting really tedious. And
most aren't really any discussion at all, but reposted URLs or media
stories that I'm already bombarded with. They're at a frequency of
posts that it's elevated to the level of spam. I've started putting
hard mail filters on people. I really hate to do that most of all.

There's no difference to me between Captain Stupid putting up 60
spams a day, and 20 people putting up three, each thinking they
won't make much difference.

Sigh, I'm pretty close to throwing my hands up and unsubbing. I can
barely find the wheat in the chaff.

Are we really in a decline?

In '93, people were saying the same thing, "rave is dead".
Same thing in '97.
Same thing in '00.

So, has it really declined?

I also wonder how the Entertainment Commission has affected things.
It's possible to get permits now, whereas in the mid 90s, it was not
possible to get one at all. Period.

I don't see that much difference in party activity, but maybe I'm
just not seeing it.

I dunno... what do you think?

You people depress the heck out of me! ;)  The scene has become
complacent and events are not coming as rapid-fire as they once were,
but I must have had 10-20 awesome experiences at "raves" this summer
alone.  Sure, a good bit of that number was made up of campouts and
renegade outdoors, but hey, it's summer.

I'm not 21 or 22 and I still relish the sunrise.  I'm not just exiting
college, and I still feel the PLUR out there when the right event hits
at the right time with the right people.  I entered the scene around
'99 so I never really saw the heyday, so to speak, but much like a
favorite defunct band whose members are all still ALIVE and VIABLE, I
have to wonder why we aren't a little more motivated to do it all over
again?

The RAVE act sought to bury our culture and has had little impact
besides spooking some venue owners out of hosting parties.  What do the
"kids" do?  They break into fabled old venues and use unlikely spaces
that somehow squeak just under the radar.  One of the more giddy, "oh
my god, how the f*** are the cops not here right now :)" moments I had
this summer was at that Element party, where there were cracked-out
candy kids milling around in plain view of a major street.  Nothing
happened, except a fun party with a suprisingly with-it lineup.

The glimmer in all of this is thus:  The more understated we get and
the longer this sort of half-cocked hiatus lasts, the more underground
the scene goes- until, perhaps, the watchful post-9/11 eyes lose
interest and we can strike out and be a little bolder.  Moksha Tribe
has been having a tough time finding a venue of late, but you can bet
that once that gets squared away (and it seems to be about to be), we
will be throwing more sweaty, crazy, unifying "raves", because we
believe the area, and the world in general, needs it.  ..and let's face
it, we just like to have fun.

Does anybody else like to have fun?  :)

I gave BayRaves it's first shot last night after all the talk of it,
and I have to say, it's a pretty energizing place, for all of its
highschool drama.  I'll have to start paying attention.  In the
meantime I have become more of a clubber than I ever was before.  There
is not such a sense of decline in clubland, and there is PLUR to be
found on some of the better dancefloors out there.  Alcohol and its
abusers do not thrill me at all, and that is the major turnoff of the
clubs for me.  

I'm thinking of trying to find a space to host small afterparties for
club events so people that want to go all night and maybe get a little
crazier than they can in the clubs can do their thing.  It'd get some
new blood into the scene and it'd be a lot of fun.  Something sort of
like an afterhours version of "The Loft" in NYC that Apollo outlines in
House Music 101.  

Right, like I need another excuse to lose sleep ;)  These days I am
much more involved in making dance music than dancing to it, and that's
fine- but I would be really happy to the "the band get back together",
so to speak.  FnF, Cloudfactory, Viberation peoples- all of you are
very much alive, young, vibrant, and creative.  The campouts this year
were breathtaking.  Let's see some warehouses get defiled!  Let's see
some minds blown! 

Let's do this thang before it's way, way too late.

"Do not go gentle into that good night,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light."

AMEN. :)

Excellent post, George!  There is still a lot of great stuff going on ... it 
isn't necessarily presented right in front of us on a platter, but it's there. 

I was wondering when there would be another Moksha Tribe party ... It took me 
a long time to make it to one, but I sure enjoyed Catch 20-2. And ... I sure 
hadn't ever seen a DJ play bass while spinning!  :)  that's really something 
to see and hear.

Hmmmm...
 
>From a Sacramento point of view, if that carries any weight at all, it has declined.  I remember 2 years ago there were random campouts almost every weekend throughout summer in the sierra foothills.  Hell, sometimes there were the occasional party up in the tahoe area.  I remember BFE some years ago that was busted up, then re-organized in placerville for a 2nd night. Good times.
 
I also always remember hearing here and there about modesto/stockton parties, and their success.  I haven't heard of any of these lately.
 
Anyone interested in orchestrating maybe a once-a-year hyperreal-member (sacraves/sfraves/whoever else) type campout? It's been a pipedream I've had for awhile, but I got generators to donate!!
 
Too much redbull...

Campouts are GRRRRATE!!

In '93, people were saying the same thing, "rave is dead".
Same thing in '97.
Same thing in '00.

So, has it really declined?

I also wonder how the Entertainment Commission has affected things.
It's possible to get permits now, whereas in the mid 90s, it was not
possible to get one at all. Period.

I don't see that much difference in party activity, but maybe I'm
just not seeing it.

I dunno... what do you think?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] (nrr) wasvNew Plan..Now sfraves

it's been my dream to just break into a warehouse and spontaneously throw a 
party.  i wish i had bigger balls...and a sound system to make that happen.

but i don't...so i just throw parties at clubs, which, to be honest, has 
actually been very satisfying and have been very happy to see people coming 
out to.

but damnit, it's about that time to rave again.  haven't really raved in 
awhile now.

calling all ravers, let's get it on!

I've always had this thoery that the rave scene has a 4-yr cycle.

So it's 2004 now, where's the big party?

Maybe the big day where everything turns itself around is tomorrow,
hopefully.  :)

Have fun tomorrow y'all. I wish I could make it.

I'd have to agree.  I have a little Clive bag that I sometimes hold my
essentials in, and I'm sure it'll get a lot of use over this fine Love
Parade weekend.  The only problem is, my less-secure-in-their-manhood
friends like to call it my "manpurse", which I find a little demeaning.

So what if I like to carry my nos bottle in a slate blue shoulder bag
with red accents?  SUE ME!

Rock on, Geri..

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Cmon!  Was: Re:  (nrr) wasvNew Plan..Now sfraves

excellent post.

i think the trick is to constantly change, while at the same
time have fun.  i've been partying on and off since '89, but
not always in the same context.  god, how boring that'd be.

feel like you're stagnating?  help out at a party for a little
bit.  maybe get some records together and join the too-many-DJs
posse that is san francisco.  throw your own party.  poduce
your own tracks.  or do something completely different...

for me, it's always been about the music.  it's been a social
scene, yes, but the music is what drew me in, and keeps me
here.  i don't necessarily like all the music that's played in
SF, but i certainly love the stuff that i play out.

Well that's good at least someone likes the stuff you play out.

I for one have embraced the term "manpurse". They're great for CDs, an
iPod, a notepad, a bulky cell phone or so-called "tobacco accessories".
Call them what you want, but for me it's a helluva lot better than
wearing a big 'ol backpack all day.

Much love,

I've made the same argument, Sean, and still believe some aspects of raving 
are alive....and, of course, no one knows what the future may hold.  I'm 
still optimistic, but not to the degree I was even a year ago.

As for this list and politics, Sean, addressing your prior post:  yes there 
are numerous list for the discussion of politics.  I'm on more of them than 
I would like these days.  But there are also many lists devoted to music, 
EDM, and various genres.  There are discussion groups focused on music 
production.  Better lists for party information than sfraves these 
days.  What makes us different?

I was listening to Cornel West today on NPR.  The man's wisdom, 
intellectual achievement, and vast understanding of philosophy and history 
are remarkable.  But it is his "musical" approach to politics that makes my 
heart sing, as do the passion with which he invests his beliefs.  West said 
that to him "democracy" was a verb:  that is, a way of life; a belief 
system that is actionable in everyday life.

Early raving was like that.  It was not just "the music," or esoteric 
discussions of music making, or fun parties.  Yes, all these components 
somehow made up the whole of raving, but there was more behind it than just 
technique and getting high with friends one day a week.  One thing I admire 
about Starchild is that to me he is an example of a maturing raver who has 
taken what he learned in our community and actualized these beliefs in his 
life.  I don't agree with all of the Libertarian agenda, but I understand 
how integrating early rave ideals could be manifest in parts of that agenda.

So, what is/was raving?  What is different in our community twelve years later?

In the early nineties there were lots of clubs.  Good ones.  Much more free 
than now, with minimal security.  Why in the hell did the early ravers 
decided to throw underground, un permitted parties?  Makes no sense.  As 
Tina implied it's lots of trouble;  requires much tiring labor;  opens the 
promoter to great liability;  and for most of us then and now creates no 
monetary return.  Lots easier to throw a club night.

The early rave community was much older than the demographic in the late 
nineties.  So one  can't say they were a bunch of underage kids looking for 
ways to drink, smoke, take drugs and party all night long until they were 
old enough to get into clubs.  There were other motivations -- much more 
powerful -- in play then.  What were they?  Do they still exist?

I was thinking about all this at Catch 20-2 when the police came barging 
into our un permitted event.  At the very same time a guest who had 
swallowed a whole box of cough suppressant pills was freaking out and I had 
no idea what his physical condition was.  While waiting for the EMT's 
assessment I asked myself why am I doing these parties?  Worse case 
scenario the guest will need an ambulance, the police are right outside, 
and we all could be going to court:)  I must have stronger reasons for 
doing these events than making "fun" parties.  Perhaps Starchild remembers 
what these beliefs are.

Sure, there are lots of club nights these days.  Clubs seem to be doing 
OK.  Lots of booze again.  And there are the ubiquitous campouts during the 
summer.  The remnants of the old rave scene seemed to be defined by the 
campout now.  Lot safer and easier to do a couple of these a year. But for 
those of us unable or unwilling to do campouts ain't much out there but 
clubs and booze.  As far as I know there are two collectives who regularly 
do outdoor FMRs and the remarkable Modified people who actually still do 
break ins.  Telic is not, IMHO, and underground.  There is a house 
collective in SF that throws one of two ugs (usually terribly oversold and 
uncomfortable) a year.  And Moksha.  Our last event was in March.

Urban development has certainly reduced the number of reasonable 
underground venues available.  9/11 has, as Tina suggested, created more of 
a "police state" here and elsewhere.  Why bother with the big trouble of 
throwing an underground when you can rent a club?:)  Get into the business 
of selling booze?

The 18+ permits in SF, Sean, are fine for those who throw rather large 
parties, charge a hefty ticket price, and sell many things inside the 
venue, but the economics of finding a space that is not a bar yet still 
meets fire and other requirements is daunting and very expensive for those 
interested in throwing more intimate 3-400 person events.

I'm implying here, of course, that raving has something to do with 
underground, un permitted parties that provide a measure of freedom and 
liberation not found elsewhere.  If this is no longer true, then raving is 
dead.  Go to clubs.  Do club events.  I spent two thirds of my dance and 
music life in clubs, beginning with the Paradise Garage.  I had fun. But 
then, the PG didn't serve booze.  They provided LSD punch:)

Lots of questions in my mind these days.

As for this list and politics:  well, if raving is truly a way of life with 
a belief system, then everything is connected here.  One can't have 
temporary autonomous zones in a police state.  If life has become 24/7 
survival with no time for personal development, then that's a political, 
economic problem that affects raving.  If we are now just looking for a 
good club every couple of weeks to dance a little, drink, and leave at two 
when the bar closes then we are no longer ravers.  If we learned nothing 
about compassion, empathy, love and community from our raving experiences, 
then I think we were not raving.

Love,

Apollo

Subject: Re: [sfraves] (nrr) wasvNew Plan..Now sfraves

I could never understand why people COULDN'T find all the "connectiveness"
at clubs. Granted, it depends on where you're at, but the vast majority of
what I consider to be VERY "rave" moments were at  nightcluba in DC (namely
Buzz). I was raving long before going to Buzz, but that's where I forged
REAL bonds with people - and this wasn't until '99. I started raving in
'91 - you do the math.

I think it REALLY comes down to what people bring to the table. Are they
openminded, willing to meet new people, let themselves go, relax, lose the
'tude and not focus all their attention on being a scenester - or are you
just there to bitch about the music, the club the dj, the drink prices,
security, etc. ?

There're only two noticeable differences between undergrounds and clubs. A
bar and legality. Other than that, it's a dark spot, where dance music is
played over a huge soundsystem of some kind, where hopefully - people are
dancing.  It's the ravers that make the party what it is. I have been to
parties where there have been sick lineups - and the vibe sucked ass because
people were bitchy, or didn't feel like showing. I have been to crappy
little parties with no-name dj's that rocked socks - because the crowds vibe
was tangible.

*Each and every one of us can make or break that vibe. When you have people
who won't leave the city to go to the East Bay, and vice versa, DJ's who
won't go to parties they aren't playing at, people who are (insert genre
name here) fans that will ONLY go to that particular genre club and/or party
night...things aren't gonna be great. Things stagnate.

BTW - it's like this all over the country. Over-commercialization of the
scene, crackheads with no ability to moderate their drug use, archaic drug
laws and witch-hunts, coupled with a great deal of people "growing up" and
moving on (*and the aforementioned reasons) accounts for most of why things
are the way they are.

People are forced to go legit in order to keep the party going. Some of us
may not like that idea - but it's a necessary evil in my book.

For me - I just go where I like the beats the best. Could be a dirty
warehouse, could be a sparkling new club - it could even be someone's
apartment with 5 other people kickin' it. Rave - much like punk was to me
(and a lot of other folks) isn't what you wear, or what you say - it's who
you are, it's a state of mind.

Pardon my rambling...this thread has had me thinking.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] (nrr) wasvNew Plan..Now sfraves

Thanks for the great post, Apollo!

I am not very enthused about the club scene, myself. Yeah there were
all the Wickeds and the Spundae's etc., a lot of them really going
off. But the legal spaces like the King St. Garage never really
appealed to me. The drinking vibe was all different. The club vibe
was all different.

Underground has a special energy... I'm not sure why. Is it the fact
that one is "getting away" with something? People flocked to our
Urban Wasteland parties despite the fact that we never had much
production at all and things were always just a little on the edge.
We got busted plenty of times, and more times, we weren't. People
came to expect that possiblity, and it was part of the adrenaline
ride. Lord I don't know how many times I've talked to the cops
myself, maybe 30 times???

Is the danger, the "undergound factor" a magic ingredient? I wonder.
I *know* if I threw a party in a "virgin" warehouse space, there'd
be a vibe I'd never see at a club.

I also wonder if the fact that permits are available eventually will
mean that enforcement will be harsher for those without one. This is
not an effect the people who founded the Entertainment Commission
would have wanted, I'm sure of that.

And you're totally right about the cost. It may be possible to get
permits now, but getting a space to meet all the fire code and other
requirements, even though it is factually safe to have the party
without improvements, can be outrageously expensive. I'd like to see
some sort of cost analysis to get an average space fully permitted.
I'd guess that unless it's dialed-in code-wise, the average cost is
in the tens of thousands of dollars.

That said, is the scene really dead? I'm one of the original Friends
and Family founders, and we just don't throw very many parties
anymore (nice analysis on the campout thing, btw). And yet there are
some spinoffs doing really well. Brass Tax always seems to rock the
house. I *very* much recommend going to their events. They've got
new energy whereas a lot of us FnFers have been going at it over a
decade.

(And by the way, even though I started in '93 at the age of 31 (!!),
I am *nowhere* near done. I only party like mad maybe 4 or 5 times a
year, and I love it, but I'm nowhere near done yet. :-P)

Who are the new tribes? That was always where the big energy was
coming from, once some people get fairly well organized, there
seemed a frenzy of energy. I think the older tribes have perhaps
stopped drawing in as much new people. Probably my biggest role (and
perhaps still) -- was meeting new people and connecting them with
others. The scene always needs new energy. It is an equilibrium, and
it is good.

But the ideas persist. Most of our society is still separationist.
There is a lot of conservative thought. And there is always the
resistance to that. I think that's where a lot of us come from.

And rave I think comes ultimately from the tribal drums. The group
experience of letting go and expression through beats and dance.
It's many tens of thousands of years old, and I don't think it will
just die away like that. We may be in a lull, but there is something
deep in us that responds, and the lull is probably temporary. It may
be rediscovered, it may take on new form, but there is something so
deep and primal that isn't just going to go away. Not until we're
wired differently. Perhaps we will evolve beyond it eventually. But
for now, the attraction to the beat way inside, and how that
connects us to ourselves and others, will persist for a long long
time. I'd bank on it.

Finally, again, people have always always always been saying the
scene is dead. It was dead when I started, and it's still dead. And
yet there's a Love Parade tomorrow and some afterparties that will
be utterly ballistic. This didn't all happen because people were
ready to give up. It happened because they really want to do this
thing, because it means *so much* to them. Enough to take risks
(monetary and otherwise). Enough to put forth a huge amount of
effort.

The rave scene isn't dead. It changes, and it's different for
everyone. As long as someone beats on drums and someone dances, it's
alive. Deep in the brain, you respond. You dance. And it's good.

Sean

I have this manpurse/fannypack hybrid. It's like a fanny pack that's
flat, or maybe u can see it as a manpurse with a waist belt. I't's as
practical as a genuine  fanny pack but with the contemporary styling
of a proper manurpse.  LMAO  :)

I used to never wear it cuz it's just, well.... a manpurse is a
manpurse (and I had it for 4 years). Then I started wearing it a lot
since I got an iPod: It carries the iPod, accessories, my PDA, my cell
phone, etc. All in one place. I no longer have to check all 6-7
cargo-pant pockets to find something.

Manpurses are grate, I'm a believer now. Let's embrace the fashion
victim in us all.  :)

Unfortunatly I have, and you know i was a big time rivethead and he
somehow managed to turn me from my favorite music.  How's that for a
good DJ, they're supposed to make you like music, not hate it.  Now I
hate industrial as much if not more than I hate him.

Well, for me, that feeling of "connectiveness" is just entirely killed 
by the alcohol-fueled meat-market vibe of clubs.

Maybe I'm a hypocrite for being being negative about some drugs, while 
being positively disposed towards others.  Whatever.  I don't like 
alcohol.  To be more specific, I don't like being surrounded by large 
numbers of drunk people.  When I am, there are really only two options 
for me:

1) Get drunk myself.
2) Leave.

And, given the fact that BART and MUNI shut down overnight, my 
transportation situation usually makes #1 impossible.

Bitch about the irresponsibility.  Complain about the e-puddles 
crowding the dance floor.  Whatever.  The fact is... that wether I've 
decided to be sober, or indulge in some drug or another (even if it's 
alcohol... yah... maybe that makes me more of a hypocrite), I'd much 
rather be stuck in the midst of a thousand e-tards than just a hundred 
drunks.  Even if the "connectiveness" of those e-tards is more 
chemically induced than not, they're STILL a damn sight more pleasant 
than the drunks.  And let's not even GET into the belligerent drunks.  
The worst that can happen to you with an overbearing 'tard, after all, 
is that they'll tell you their life story and give you a big sweaty 
hug.

Then there's the meat-market thing.  I go out to have fun.  That's it.  
If I happen to meet someone, that's great.  But that's not my 
motivation behind going out.  The idea, that if you don't "hook up" on 
a given night you're a failure, is ludicrous in my mind.  There's more 
to life than empty sex.  Some time ago (Just after Blake's forced 
Ascension to end, actually.), I went through a stint of going to Faith 
fairly regularly with some friends (Nothing to do on thursdays now, and 
may as well give clubs a second chance, after all.).  And, often, by 
the time we'd make it through the crappy music and shady people in the 
front room to the (fairly decent, usually) main room, I'd have 
accumulated half a dozen free condoms.  And I could've easily had more 
if I actually picked them up myself, in addition to taking the ones 
actively given me.  Now, it's definitely good that this sort of thing 
is available.  But, for a while, the floor of my car was littered with 
so many free (unused) condoms that it was positively absurd.  And the 
intrinsic message behind that level of condom-saturation is obvious.

With raves, that meat-market vibe is not there.  I can go just to have 
fun.  And that's not a big deal because that's mostly why others are 
there too.  There's no pressure to "hook up" or otherwise be a failure. 
  And you can socialize and meet new people without those predatory 
undertones.  That freedom makes possible, to me, a level of 
"connectiveness" that is just not possible in a place where the main 
objective is just to "score".

Subject: Re: [sfraves] (nrr) wasvNew Plan..Now sfraves

I dunno - I can see that point, but maybe it's because the people I
surrounded myself with back east weren't like that, or maybe because any of
the nights I have gotten out around here haven't been like that - I don't
sweat the "meat market" thing. Typically the clubs where that vibe is thick
are clubs I wouldn't go to anyway - for numerous reasons.

As far as the alcohol good or bad thing...well, I like to drink, and most of
the people I know like to drink. The vast majority of those folks are not
belligerant drunks. They do exist tho - there's no denying that. And yes,
they do suck major ass. It's a double edged sword.

Still ,I have found the same vibe at clubs as I have at raves (underground
or otherwise). It just depends on the person. Some people are into the
"scene" and some are just along for the ride...the trick is figuring out who
is who.

Of course people can find connectivity at a club.  I have written very 
passionately about the vibe and unity at the Paradise Garage and local 
events like Come-Unity and Wicked club events.

Some caveats, however.  The Paradise Garage was a membership only club and 
it was very difficult to get a card.  One had to be recommended by at least 
one current member.  The crowd here was self-selecting also:  comprised of 
gays, most of whom were African American and Hispanic, who had come 
together with a shared experience of oppression.  Very powerful.  Those who 
share a common bond on the dancefloor produce the best platform for a 
memorable, unifying dance experience.

Same with Come-Unity.  The Come-Unity crowd was comprised of the ravers, 
house heads, who started the whole rave scene here in the Bay.  The party 
originally had some barriers to entry: it was on Wednesday nights and one 
had to be a die hard to dance all night and go to work the next day.  When 
they moved to a Friday night the monthly started to unravel and now there 
is no more Come-Unity.

Wicked.  At Townsend the Wicked club night, usually a quarterly event, 
again attracted the old raver crowd.  When they moved to the DNA the event 
began a long, downward spiral.  More parties, but more clubbers and fewer 
ravers.  For me, Wicked at the DNA was an unmitigated disaster.  The house 
oversold the door, and the last party I attended there was one of the most 
horrible nights I've ever spent at a party.  I was assaulted twice by 
drunken patrons.

One problem with clubs vs raves -- a mass marketed party means that you get 
just that:  whoever has the admission price on the flier they discovered on 
their car comes.  Russian roulette.  Some nights can be good, others 
awful.  And, again, drunk folks can be happy or aggressive and sometimes 
violent.  At raves the promoter attempts to create some more focused 
invitations to an event and that tends to attract a more friends inviting 
friends environment.  Like the Paradise Garage, which I still see as a 
"rave" back in the day.

Love,

Apollo

My personal take is there is good clubs and bad clubs, good parties and
bad parties.  With anything you have to weed out what you don't want and
find places that you like and feel comfortable.  I go to many clubs and
rarely get that it=92s a meat market vibe more so than at a rave.  At =
some
raves I'd rather be at a club watching a beligerant drunk get escorted
out than listening to mediocre sets and watching 14 year olds take way
too many pills. =20

One of my favorite non-meat market clubs that plays really decent if not
great music every night with a crowd of people there for the music and a
few drinks is The Top.  I'm not a huge drum and bass fan but I try to
make it most Tuesday's to the Top for the happy hour to support my
roomie and Solution and sometimes stay for Phuturo.  DNB isin't really
my thing but what they play there is enough to get my booty shakin' for
a little while.  I also have nothing short of an amazing expierience
anytime I go to one of the Thump parties at 550.  It doesn't seem to
draw a meat market crowd but I can't say that for the rest of the things
thrown there.  It all depends on promoter, venue, style of music and how
easy it is to get to.  Make a club hard to get to and you'll most likely
only have people there who are there for the music, promoter and party.
Although that can also run a promoter into financial woes.  111 Minna is
kinda a cross.  Almost always a good vibe, even though you get a
distinct sort of meat market vibe at the same time, but the parties are
always really good for whatever you're there for.  And then I've always
enjoyed the atmosphere on Wednesday's at the Arrow Bar.  Lately though
I've been going to a lot more bars with pool tables, live music etc..
One club I've grown to hate is the Luna Lounge.  Even without a style of
music that=92s going to bring a meat market crowd, the bouncers and =
d=E9cor
make it seem more like Ruby Skye or 1015.

I dunno - I can see that point, but maybe it's because the people I
surrounded myself with back east weren't like that, or maybe because any
of the nights I have gotten out around here haven't been like that - I
don't sweat the "meat market" thing. Typically the clubs where that vibe
is thick are clubs I wouldn't go to anyway - for numerous reasons.

As far as the alcohol good or bad thing...well, I like to drink, and
most of the people I know like to drink. The vast majority of those
folks are not belligerant drunks. They do exist tho - there's no denying
that. And yes, they do suck major ass. It's a double edged sword.

Still ,I have found the same vibe at clubs as I have at raves
(underground or otherwise). It just depends on the person. Some people
are into the "scene" and some are just along for the ride...the trick is
figuring out who is who.

And for yours, Sean.  I've been genuinely trying to understand where raving 
is going these days and, quite frankly, whether the passion for the 
underground still exists.  If former ravers prefer clubs these days is it 
worth all the effort to throw undergrounds?

I think danger is a part of it:)  Another reason I think undergrounds have 
a consistently better vibe than clubs is, as I mentioned in my previous 
post, that the underground is not a mass market deal.  Rather, it was (and 
is) more about building community through word of mouth with, at its best, 
friends inviting friends.  You know this from your experiences with FnF.

Yes, I feel this is what the effect will be.  In the end, it will be the 
big parties and commercial massives who will most benefit.

Which means, again, that to make a party economically viable it must be 
large and expensive.  And you also, as a promoter, are I think less able to 
showcase new local talent since your heart is focused on the bottom 
line.  Another good thing about the underground was that local talent had a 
chance to perform more frequently than they can in the more dollar driven 
commercial scene.

I've been opening myself to more of the smaller events in town.  Had a very 
good time at Evil Breaks last week.  Lots of sfr people there and a good vibe.

LOL.  I'm older than you and the same goes for me.  I figure I'll prolly 
die on the dancefloor:)

Modified Productions is one.  And Moksha Tribe is always looking for people 
with new ideas and energy.  I have always been eager, personally, to train 
new blood, share resources, and do whatever I can to keep the underground 
alive.

I agree.  After over thirty years of this I have seen much death and 
renewal, and that's the natural order of things.  This is an ancient rite 
and, I think, is as much a part of being human as sex and family:  the 
touching of the other through music and dance, and genuinely embracing the 
self through the orgiastic experience of the dancefloor.

Thanks for the thoughts, Sean.

Much love and respect,

Apollo

This is going to be a big issue!

I'd suggest:

Park somewhere around 3rd St. and 20th St. (the "Dogpatch" area),
and take a "15" 3rd Street bus back north. The only problem is
getting there. I'd suggest getting off the freeway at Cezar Chavez,
head East towards the bay, and make a left on 3rd. Any other
way to 3rd street necessarily has to go very near the parade.

or 

Park near the Castro Muni Metro station (difficult) or the Forest
Hill station (easier) and take any inbound Muni train to Embarcadero
station.

or

Park at or near the Ashby BART station in Berkeley at Ashby and
Martin Luthor King Jr. Way, and take any SF train to Embarcadero
station. This is probably easiest of all.

Sean

Oh and I should point out that when this thing's over, Muni

Subject: Re: [sfraves] (nrr) wasvNew Plan..Now sfraves

Well that's why I always just go to afterhours instead on weekends,
and not get out of my house until 3am: Avoid all the drunk ppl.

During the week is not so bad, there's always a handful of good
weeklies during the week with exceptional music and very little bull
shit.

As for Faith... been there once. Twinky gay boys typically makes me
vomit. But then I look like a twinky gay boy anyways... **sigh**  I
was hoping the youg gay scene in SF would have a little more diverse
personalities, but it's overwhelmed by mass consumerism just like
everywhere else.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] (nrr) wasvNew Plan..Now sfraves

Yea - my experience is also limited to an environment where undergrounds
were all but extinct as early as '97. The promoters kind of had to switch to
a club atmosphere to continue what they were doing without going to prison.
So the core crowd were "ravers" as opposed to "clubbers" and until recently,
it remained that way.

SF still has relatively close ties to the real deal - and I can imagine
seeing it slip away, or change is disconcerting to folks. I can't say
whether or not it will ever fully happen here (the 110% switch from raves to
clubs ). But as long as there are warehouse collectives, and solid crews
that know how to successfully do a one-off type event - that mystical vibe
can still be found. Maybe fewer and farther between - but honestly, who can
devote 5 days a week to raving anymore??? (aside from Osby of course, lol)

I prefer them being quality over quantity anyway...a few good parties a
year, with some club nights in between to get my music fix on makes me a
happy camper. I guess I'm just weird like that...

Blackstone is no longer doing Faith, although I guess it was twink 
heaven:)  I hear he has a party over at Mission Rock.  18+.  Don't know the 
details.  David Harness usually spins at gay parties with a good vibe.  If 
you see him on the DJ list give it a try.  He has a party called Loveworks

Subject: Re: [sfraves] (nrr) wasvNew Plan..Now sfraves

Heh...  I'm with you there.  (Except for the Twinky gay boys inducing  
vomiting,)

I was lucky enough to already BE here in SF by the time I figured out  
that I like boys.  That saved me the hassle of dealing with the shit  
that would have come along with that if I had had to deal with it when  
I still lived in the fetid south.  The main problem being, that I find  
the "gay scene" to be appallingly tacky.

I just can't stand the cafe or the badlands.  In fact, the entire  
Castro strikes me as being a tacky and overrated parody.  It's like  
Disney came along, took all the stereotypes of what america thinks is  
"gay", wrapped it in shiny rainbow paper, and put it up for sale to  
tourists.  I just can't abide the place.  Even the Haight, which does  
the same thing only with "the '60s" instead of "gay", feels more real  
to me.

One of the main things I liked about Faith, was that it was *HUGE*.   
And I never saw a crowd that came close to filling it up.  So there was  
always room to dance, room to breathe, room to just get away from the  
crowd for a bit if you needed a break.  You can't say that about the  
cafe or the badlands.

Oh yeah...  the MUSIC is also much better in the rave scene than in the  
"gay scene".  WTF is up with THAT???  "Superior music" is... like...  
the one GOOD stereotype I always used to hear about the "gay scene".

That was me.  I am going around saying that a lot, so perhaps I ought to 
clarify this statement.

The analogy with PLUR is apt, actually.  PLUR is a nice slogan and all, but 
how many of those coming down from their E trip,
after they've been spouting PLUR all night, actually behave the same way at 
work or in their regular life the rest of week?  That's the
problem I had with the constant sloganeerring.  There's a difference 
between a slogan vs. living up to something and integrating
it into your life.  And to use PLUR as a blanket reason ignores the fact 
that true compassion sometimes requires kicking someone's
ass for their own good - PLUR was often tied to "it's all good" - the 
lassiez faire attitude to everything.  Just let everything slide....
So to say PLUR, PLUR, PLUR evinces a lack of understanding about the grey 
areas of life, much like the slogans "free love" and
"tune in, turn on, drop out".

In the same manner, Libertarianism, with a capital L, is like communism - 
it is too idealistic and ignores the nature of the world
and the nature of human psychology.  If humans were entirely rational and 
responsible, I'm sure it would work out fine.  But that day
is far into the future and will not come without a certain fundamental 
restructuring of human psychology and how humans view
the world.  I do see the beginnings of this with the ideals of the rave 
scene (it's only a scene) and the Burning Man culture that is
arising out of the rave scene.  When the Burning Man culture and its ethos 
becomes predominant, I think libertarianism may very
well arise naturally.

In the meantime, to try and even implement some of Libertarianism is to 
give an opening for the people, who akin to Stalin, will
take advantage of the loopholes and fuzziness in the political structures 
of society and implement something akin totalitarianism, but
which involves corporations - if Libertarianism was fully implemented, with 
the nature of American society today, the Enrons and
Worldcoms would FLOURISH.  And the government would be even more 
ineffectual than it is, and the social infrastructure would
crumble.  The world is not ready for Libertarianism.

Libertarians seem to have a blind spot when considering the nature of 
capitalism nowadays - responsible capitalism is certainly
possible (see the movie "The Corporation" for a glimmer of hope) but to 
think that the mechanisms of the free market can solve
everything is asinine.  In my mind, the neo-cons are trying to restructure 
society along certain lines akin to Libertarianism and
the negative effects are going to be felt for decades.

I'm not an idiot; some parts of libertarianism make perfect sense.  But to 
subscribe to it wholeheartedly and say it -is- THE solution
to be implemented as soon as possible ignores reality - just like when the 
faux PLURries spout off about how "it's all good".  No, it isn't.
To say "it's all good" expresses a shallow understanding of the Tao, just 
like Libertarianism.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] (nrr) wasvNew Plan..Now sfraves

OK to all u other jaded hetero old skool ravers. If u think the rave
scene has gone all consumer-centric, u should look that the
progression of the gay scene for a sec.

The gays in the' 70s were leading modern arts and culture (think Andy
Warhol, etc.), they're responsible for disco and house. Then came
AIDS, rewound the gay civil right movement back to square one.
Throughout the '90s they fought hard for our civil rights and freedom.
Gay ppl usually had hard lives both at family and at work, so they
respected each other because they all knew what pain each other had to
go through on daily basis.

And where are we at now? We have our own TV shows, our own subgenre of
dance music, we have equal rights in most major cities, we have
domestic partnerships. but u know, the gay community is now just a
marketing demographic. Gay shows and magazines relentlessly selling us
this pre-packaged "gay lifestyle" U know, Diesel and Aberzombie and
Pottery Barn. And the frightening thing is the majority of gay ppl
actually subscribed to this lifestyle. A community that used to take
pride in diversity, now desperately imitate each other. Nobody take a
look at themselves and try to think for a min about who they really
are, they let TV and magazines (and gay porn) to tell them what they
should be.

Gays used to have great taste in music and fashion, in fact we were
pioneers back then. Now whenever I go to a gay club I see so much bad
taste and hear so much bad music that I need to vomit. (Hence my
previous comments.) What happened?

What's your take Apollo?

The rave culture is just another target for Corporate America, much
like any other alternative culture. From hip-hop to punk to goth to
rave, Corporate America has already discovered that these alternative
cultures are the best way to reach the other 30% of young teenagers
that Britney and Christina and Justin can't reach. They repackage
these underground culture into disposable bands and off-the-shelf
merchandises, where teenagers can conveniently purchase them @ their
local mall.

While there is a mainstream, consumer-centric rave culture for a
number of years now, it's my belief that there'll be those of us
who'll continue to support the underground and represent proper. Bare
in mind that every one of us began our journey much like all these
other clueless like kids. It's our responsibility to show them the
spirit of what this is **really** about.

Don't segregate, educate.

All this aside, I don't care about what y'all say but  I still love my
manpurse.  LOL

Subject: Re: [sfraves] (nrr) wasvNew Plan..Now sfraves

I agree with you whole heartedly. I don't understand why many hardcore
ravers hate clubs. There are plenty of good weeklies to go to during
the week. The vibes at clubs are usually better during the week no
matter where u go (but of course, except the obvious ones that u
already know u should avoid).

Buzz is a **very** good example. I've never been there myself, but I
have to say all the Buzz kids I ever met are all hardcore,
passsionate, respecting, fun-loving individuals that leave a lasting
impression. I was told that the vibe @ Buzz is better than many of the
best raves, and I really have no doubt that's true.

So was Shadow lounge in Maimi. Sure there was a dress code (even bars
had dresscodes there) and the crowd looks all money. But if u see past
the handful of Versace/D&G fakesters and silicon bimbos, u'll find the
place was filled with music lovers for the most part, and there was a
great deal of passion. It was considered one of the best (if not
**the** best) trance clubs in the U.S.

Once upon a time, 1015 was a respectable venue too.

And that's some of the other benefits of clubs: It's always at the
same location, so u frequently run into some regular ppl, and can make
some connections. A clubs is safer in general, you can always count on
good ventilation, good lighting and sound system. The fact that a club
is at a fixed location also means it bring familiarity and a sense of
home, which can nurish a sense of family much like any underground
collective throwing one-offs.

BeatCamp in Miami (a d&b weekly @ the Mission) was such a family to
me. I made many great friends there and keep in touch with them still.
I'm sure that's how u feel about Buzz too.

Hey all,=20

most of you probably have heard something about this.=20
Just think of how many of you would be in iraq right now if this draft =
action was already active. . . something you definately need to pay =
attention to. Really, if you think about it. . .if there is a draft =
again, a lot of you won't be able to go about your fun party lives, but =
might have to take long breaks in the military which may or may not cost =
your life in one way or another.

The worst part about that is, I bet most of us are just totally NOT the =
types to go fight in the military for ideas we don't totally agree with =
under orders of someone else. . .and to be pulled from our normal lives =
for something that many of us just simply dont believe in. . .

I'm passing this on from a media buddy,
Mandatory draft for males and females (ages 18-26) starting June 15, =
2005, is something that everyone should know about. This literally =
effects everyone since we all have or know children that will have to go =
if this bill passes.

There is pending legislation in the house and senate (companion bills: =
S89 and HR 163) which will time the program's initiation so the draft =
can begin as early as spring, 2005, just after the 2004 presidential =
election. The administration is quietly trying to get these bills passed =
now, while the public's attention is on the elections, so our action on =
this is needed immediately. Details and links follow.

This plan, among other things, eliminates higher education as a shelter =
and incl reement with Canada which will no longer permit anyone =
attempting to dodge the draft to stay within it's borders. This bill =
also includes the extention of military service for all those that are =
currently active.

If you go to the select service web site and read their 2004 FYI Goals =
you will see that the reasoning for this is to increase the size of the =
military in case of terrorism. This is a critical piece of legislation, =
this will effect our undergradates, our children and our grandchildren.

Please take the time to write your congressman and let them know how you =
feel about this legislation. www.house.gov <http://www.house.gov/ =
www.senate.gov <http://www.senate.gov/

Please also write to your representatives and ask them why they aren't =
telling their constituents about these bills and write to newspapers and =
other media outlets to ask them why they're not covering this important =
story.

$28 million has been added to the 2004 selective ser 03, "to provide for =
the common defense by requiring that all young persons(age
18-26) in the United States, including women, perform a period of =
military service or a period of civilian service in furtherance of the =
national defense and homeland security, and for other purposes."

These active bills currently sit in the committee on armed services. =
Dodging the draft will be more difficult than those from the Vietnam =
era. College and Canada will not be options. In December, 2001, Canada =
and the U. S. signed a "smart border declaration," which could be used =
to keep would-be draft dodgers in. Signed by Canada's minister of =
foreign affairs, John Manley, an

hey there

ok an interesting situation.

I bid on a dutch (mulit-item auction) on ebay for one of the 12 =
Alienware Area51m Laptops @ $300. . . which first in itself is out of =
the ordinary.
The seller doesn't sell out of the US, but it supposed to be located in =
the UK.
The auction ended, and I lost to one of the other 74 bidders. And for =
some reason the sellers ebay registration isn't valid anymore.
The seller (or someone with their email) emails me saying I was 2nd and =
the winner was suspected by fraud. . .etc etc. . .( but there were 12 =
laptops, was that buyer buying all ? I was second ?)

So I was like YES. . . let me know.

She? emailed me back saying it would be $400 for the laptop, sent via =
western union money transfer to that persons address in Italy. . . I =
also sent an email thru ebay to the person that they haven't recieved.

Since then I've spoke to a couple other bidders who asked me if it =
seemed suspicious to me, they recieved the same email initially.

Now. . .the seller is still wanting to know if I want one. . .=20

So here, if you want to play, Give me $400, I'll buy the item. . . if =
it's legit and I recieve a laptop like in the auction, then I'll give =
you $600. . .if not and it is a scam, you lose your $400. . .  but if it =
is real, you make $200 . . . I'll write up some contract to be signed, =
one of the rules will be "no crying about losing" . . .

another interesting thing. . .

I just got an email another real powerseller who has one of those laptops
listed in her auctions. She told me that it's not hers, someone hacked into
her account and is listing it themselves. . .

hmmm

hey there

ok an interesting situation.

I bid on a dutch (mulit-item auction) on ebay for one of the 12 Alienware
Area51m Laptops @ $300. . . which first in itself is out of the ordinary.
The seller doesn't sell out of the US, but it supposed to be located in the
UK.
The auction ended, and I lost to one of the other 74 bidders. And for some
reason the sellers ebay registration isn't valid anymore.
The seller (or someone with their email) emails me saying I was 2nd and the
winner was suspected by fraud. . .etc etc. . .( but there were 12 laptops,
was that buyer buying all ? I was second ?)

So I was like YES. . . let me know.

She? emailed me back saying it would be $400 for the laptop, sent via
western union money transfer to that persons address in Italy. . . I also
sent an email thru ebay to the person that they haven't recieved.

Since then I've spoke to a couple other bidders who asked me if it seemed
suspicious to me, they recieved the same email initially.

Now. . .the seller is still wanting to know if I want one. . .

So here, if you want to play, Give me $400, I'll buy the item. . . if it's
legit and I recieve a laptop like in the auction, then I'll give you $600. .
.if not and it is a scam, you lose your $400. . .  but if it is real, you
make $200 . . . I'll write up some contract to be signed, one of the rules
will be "no crying about losing" . . .

so did anyone want to play ?

: )

gotta let me know like today. . .

hehe

yeah I know. . .this was an easy one.

I've talked to like 8 diff people from indonesia who wanted to buy tables I
have with stolen credit cards. . .

why i always pretty much use paypal, biday, andale, or whatever. . . .

I wonder how many of the 75 total bidders are actually sending the person/s
money right now. . .

But the Liar In Chief said, pointedly, "an all volunteer army to..." in the

That phrase stuck out very noticeably.
But what has GWB said that wasn't the complete opposite of what really happens?
Better start doing pull-ups, guys (and gals)

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) Asia Times:  The costs of the failed Iraqi transition 

From:
http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/FJ02Ak04.html

  The costs of the failed Iraqi transition
October 2, 2004
Asia Times online

Key findings

  "A Failed Transition" is the most comprehensive accounting of the 
mounting costs of the Iraq war on the United States, Iraq and the 
world. Among its major findings are stark figures about the escalation 
of costs in these most recent three months of "transition" to Iraqi 
rule, a period that the Bush administration claimed would be 
characterized by falling human and economic costs.

1. US military casualties have been highest during the "transition": US 
military casualties (wounded and killed) stand at a monthly average of 
747 since the so-called "transition" to Iraqi rule on June 29. This 
contrasts with a monthly average of 482 US military casualties during 
the invasion (March 20-May 1, 2003) and a monthly average of 415 during 
the occupation (May 2, 2003-June 28, 2004).

  2. Non-Iraqi contractor deaths have also been highest during the 
"transition": There has also been a huge increase in the average 
monthly deaths of US and other non-Iraqi contractors since the 
"transition". On average, 17.5 contractors have died each month since 
the "transition", versus 7.6 contractor deaths per month during the 
previous 14 months of occupation.

3. Estimated strength of Iraqi resistance skyrockets: Because the US 
military occupation remains in place, the "transition" has failed to 
win Iraqi support or diminish Iraqi resistance to the occupation. 
According to Pentagon estimates, the number of Iraqi resistance 
fighters has quadrupled between November of 2003 and early September 
2004, from 5,000 to 20,000. The deputy commander of coalition forces in 
Iraq, British Major-General Andrew Graham, indicated to Time magazine 
in early September that he thinks the 20,000 estimate is too low; he 
estimates Iraqi resistance strength at 40,000-50,000. This rise is even 
starker when juxtaposed to Brookings Institution estimates that an 
additional 24,000 Iraqi resistance fighters have been detained or 
killed between May 2003 and August 2004.

4. US-led coalition shrinks further after "transition": The number of 
countries identified as members of the coalition backing the US-led war 
started with 30 on March 18, 2003, then grew in the early months of the 
war. Since then, eight countries have withdrawn their troops and Costa 
Rica has demanded to be taken off the coalition list. At the war's 
start, coalition countries represented 19.1% of the world's population; 
today, the remaining countries with forces in Iraq represent only 13.6% 
of the world's population.

HIGHLIGHTS

I. Costs to the United States

A. Human costs to the US and allies
US military deaths: Between the start of war on March 19, 2003 and 
September 22, 2004, 1,175 coalition forces were killed, including 1,040 
US military. Of the total, 925 were killed after President George W 
Bush declared the end of combat operations on May 1, 2003. Over 7,413 
US troops have been wounded since the war began, 6,953 (94%) since May 
1, 2003.

  Contractor deaths: As of September 22, there has been an estimated 154 
civilian contractors, missionaries and civilian worker deaths since May 
1, 2004. Of these, 52 have been identified as Americans.

  Journalist deaths: Forty-four international media workers have been 
killed in Iraq as of September 22, including 33 since Bush declared the 
end of combat operations. Eight of the dead worked for US companies.

B. Security costs
  Terrorist recruitment and action: According to the London-based 
International Institute for Strategic Studies, al-Qaeda's membership is 
now at 18,000, with 1,000 active in Iraq. The State Department's 2003 
"Patterns of Global Terrorism" documented 625 deaths and 3,646 injuries 
due to terrorist attacks in 2003. The report acknowledged that 
"significant incidents" increased from 60% of total attacks in 2002 to 
84% in 2003.

Low US credibility: Polls reveal that the war has damaged the US 
government's standing and credibility in the world. Surveys in eight 
European and Arab countries demonstrated broad public agreement that 
the war has hurt, rather than helped, the "war on terrorism". At home, 
52% of Americans polled by the Annenberg Election Survey disapprove of 
Bush's handling of Iraq.

  Military mistakes: A number of former military officials have 
criticized the war, including retired Marine General Anthony Zinni, who 
has charged that by manufacturing a false rationale for war, abandoning 
traditional allies, propping up and trusting Iraqi exiles, and failing 
to plan for post-war Iraq, the Bush administration made the US less 
secure.

  Low troop morale and lack of equipment: A March 2004 army survey found 
52% of soldiers reporting low morale, and three-fourths reporting they 
were poorly led by their officers. Lack of equipment has been an 
ongoing problem. The army did not fully equip soldiers with 
bullet-proof vests until June 2004, forcing many families to purchase 
them out of their own pockets.

  Loss of first responders: National Guard troops make up almost 
one-third of the US Army troops now in Iraq. Their deployment puts a 
particularly heavy burden on their home communities because many are 
"first responders", including police, firefighters and emergency 
medical personnel. For example, 44% of the country's police forces have 
lost officers to Iraq. In some states, the absence of so many Guard 
troops has raised concerns about the ability to handle natural 
disasters.

Use of private contractors: An estimated 20,000 private contractors are 
carrying out work in Iraq traditionally done by the military, despite 
the fact that they often lack sufficient training and are not 
accountable to the same guidelines and reviews as military personnel.

C. Economic costs
The bill so far: Congress has approved $151.1 billion for Iraq. 
Congressional leaders anticipate an additional supplemental 
appropriation of $60 billion after the election in November.

  Long-term impact on US economy: Economist Doug Henwood has estimated 
that the war bill will add up to an average of at least $3,415 for 
every US household. Another economist, James Galbraith of the 
University of Texas, predicts that while war spending may boost the 
economy initially, over the long term it is likely to bring a decade of 
economic troubles, including an expanded trade deficit and high 
inflation.

  Oil prices: US crude oil prices spiked at $48 per barrel on August 19, 
the highest level since 1983, a development that most analysts 
attribute at least in part to the deteriorating situation in Iraq. 
According to a mid-May CBS survey, 85% of Americans said they had been 
affected measurably by higher gas prices. According to one estimate, if 
crude oil prices stay around $40 a barrel for a year, US gross domestic 
product will decline by more than $50 billion.

  Economic impact on military families: Since the beginning of the wars 
in Iraq and Afghanistan, 364,000 reserve troops and National Guard 
soldiers have been called for military service, serving tours of duty 
that often last 20 months. Studies show that between 30% and 40% of 
reservists and National Guard members earn a lower salary when they 
leave civilian employment for military deployment. Army Emergency 
Relief has reported that requests from military families for food 
stamps and subsidized meals increased "several hundred percent" between 
2002 and 2003.

D. Social costs
  US budget and social programs: The Bush administration's combination 
of massive spending on the war and tax cuts for the wealthy means less 
money for social spending. The $151.1 billion expenditure for the war 
through this year could have paid for: close to 23 million housing 
vouchers; health care for over 27 million uninsured Americans; salaries 
for nearly 3 million elementary school teachers; 678,200 new fire 
engines; over 20 million Head Start slots for children; or health care 
coverage for 82 million children. A leaked memo from the White House to 
domestic agencies outlines major cuts following the election, including 
funding for education, Head Start, home ownership, job training, 
medical research and homeland security.

  Social costs to the military: To meet troop requirements in Iraq, the 
army has extended the tours of duty for soldiers. These extensions have 
been particularly difficult for reservists, many of whom never expected 
to face such long separations from their jobs and families. According 
to military policy, reservists are not supposed to be on assignment for 
more than 12 months every five-six years. To date, the average tour of 
duty for all soldiers in Iraq has been 320 days. A recent army survey 
revealed that more than half of soldiers said they would not re-enlist.

  Costs to veteran health care: About 64% of the more than 7,000 US 
soldiers injured in Iraq received wounds that prevented them from 
returning to duty. One trend has been an increase in amputees, the 
result of improved body armor that protects vital organs but not 
extremities. As in previous wars, many soldiers are likely to have 
received ailments that will not be detected for years to come. The 
Veterans Administration healthcare system is not prepared for the 
swelling number of claims. In May, the House of Representatives 
approved funding for FY 2005 that is $2.6 billion less than needed, 
according to veterans' groups.

  Mental health costs: The New England Journal of Medicine reported in 
July that one in six soldiers returning from war in Iraq showed signs 
of post-traumatic stress disorder, major depression, or severe anxiety. 
Only 23% to 40% of respondents in the study who showed signs of a 
mental disorder had sought mental health care.

II. Costs to Iraq

  A. Human costs
Iraqi deaths and injuries: As of September 22, between 12,800 and 
14,843 Iraqi civilians had been killed as a result of the US invasion 
and ensuing occupation, while an estimated 40,000 Iraqis injured. 
During "major combat" operations, between 4,895 and 6,370 Iraqi 
soldiers and insurgents were killed.

Effects of depleted uranium (DU): The health impacts of the use of 
depleted uranium weaponry in Iraq are yet to be known. The Pentagon 
estimates that US and British forces used 1,100 to 2,200 tons of 
weaponry made from the toxic and radioactive metal during the March 
2003 bombing campaign. Many scientists blame the far smaller amount of 
DU weapons used in the Persian Gulf War of 1991 for illnesses among US 
soldiers, as well as a sevenfold increase in child birth defects in 
Basra in southern Iraq.

B. Security costs
Rise in crime: Murder, rape and kidnapping have skyrocketed since March 
2003, forcing Iraqi children to stay home from school and women to stay 
off the streets at night. Violent deaths rose from an average of 14 per 
month in 2002 to 357 per month in 2003.

Psychological impact: Living under occupation without the most basic 
security has devastated the Iraqi population. A poll conducted by the 
Iraq Center for Research and Strategic Studies in June found that 80% 
of Iraqis believe that coalition forces should leave either immediately 
or directly after the election.

  C. Economic costs
  Unemployment: Iraqi joblessness doubled from 30% before the war to 60% 
in the summer of 2003. While the Bush administration now claims that 
unemployment has dropped, the US is only employing 120,000 Iraqis, of a 
workforce of 7 million, in reconstruction projects.

Corporate war profiteering: Most of Iraq's reconstruction has been 
contracted out to US companies, rather than experienced Iraqi firms. 
Top contractor Halliburton is being investigated for charging $160 
million for meals that were never served to troops and $61 million in 
cost overruns on fuel deliveries. Halliburton employees also took $6 
million in kickbacks from sub-contractors, while other employees have 
reported extensive waste, including the abandonment of $85,000 worth of 
trucks because they had flat tires.

Iraq's oil economy:  Anti-occupation violence has prevented Iraq from 
capitalizing on its oil assets. There have been an estimated 118 
attacks on Iraq's oil infrastructure since June 2003. By September, oil 
production still had not reached pre-war levels and major attacks 
caused oil exports to plummet to a 10-month low in August.

  D. Social costs
Health infrastructure: After more than a decade of crippling sanctions, 
Iraq's health facilities were further damaged during the war and 
post-invasion looting. Iraq's hospitals continue to suffer from lack of 
supplies and an overwhelming number of patients.

  Education: The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) estimates that 
more than 200 schools were destroyed in the conflict and thousands more 
were looted in the chaos following the fall of Saddam Hussein. The 
State Department reported on September 15 that "significant obstacles 
remain in maintaining security for civilian/military reconstruction, 
logistical support and distribution for donations, equipment, textbooks 
and supplies".

Environment: The US-led attack damaged water and sewage systems and the 
country's fragile desert ecosystem. It also resulted in oil well fires 
that spewed smoke across the country and left unexploded ordnance that 
continues to endanger the Iraqi people and environment. Mines and 
unexploded ordnance cause an estimated 20 casualties per month.

  E. Human-rights costs
Even with Saddam overthrown, Iraqis continue to face human-rights 
violations from occupying forces. In addition to the widely publicized 
humiliation and torture of prisoners, abuse has been widespread 
throughout the post-September 11 military operations, with over 300 
allegations of abuse in Afghanistan, Iraq and Guantanamo. As of 
mid-August, only 155 investigations into the existing 300 allegations 
had been completed.

F. Sovereignty costs
Despite the proclaimed "transfer of sovereignty" to Iraq, the country 
continues to be occupied by US and coalition troops and has severely 
limited political and economic independence. The interim government 
does not have the authority to reverse the nearly 100 orders by former 
Coalition Provisional Authority head L Paul Bremer that, among other 
things, allow for the privatization of Iraq's state-owned enterprises 
and prohibit preferences for domestic firms in reconstruction.

III. Costs to the world

A. Human costs
While Americans make up the vast majority of military and contractor 
personnel in Iraq, other US-allied "coalition" troops have suffered 135 
war casualties in Iraq. In addition, the focus on Iraq has diverted 
international resources and attention away from humanitarian crises 
such as in Sudan.

B. Disabling international law
The unilateral US decision to go to war in Iraq violated the United 
Nations charter, setting a dangerous precedent for other countries to 
seize any opportunity to respond militarily to claimed threats, whether 
real or contrived, that must be "preempted". The US military has also 
violated the Geneva Convention, making it more likely that in the 
future, other nations will ignore these protections in their treatment 
of civilian populations and detainees.

  C. Undermining the United Nations
  At every turn, the Bush administration has attacked the legitimacy and 
credibility of the UN, undermining the institution's capacity to act in 
the future as the centerpiece of global disarmament and conflict 
resolution. The efforts of the Bush administration to gain UN 
acceptance of an Iraqi government that was not elected but rather 
installed by occupying forces undermines the entire notion of national 
sovereignty as the basis for the UN charter. It was on this basis that 
secretary general Kofi Annan referred specifically to the vantage point 
of the UN charter in his September 2004 finding that the war was 
illegal.

D. Enforcing coalitions
Faced with opposition in the UN Security Council, the US government 
attempted to create the illusion of multilateral support for the war by 
pressuring other governments to join a so-called "coalition of the 
willing". This not only circumvented UN authority, but also undermined 
democracy in many coalition countries, where public opposition to the 
war was as high as 90%. As of the middle of September, only 29 members 
of the "coalition of the willing" had forces in Iraq, in addition to 
the US. These countries, combined with US, make up less than 14% of the 
world's population.

E. Costs to the global economy
The $151.1 billion spent by the US government on the war could have cut 
world hunger in half and covered HIV/AIDS medicine, childhood 
immunization and clean water and sanitation needs of the developing 
world for more than two years. As a factor in the oil price hike, the 
war has created concerns of a return to the "stagflation" of the 1970s. 
Already, the world's major airlines are expecting an increase in costs 
of $1 billion or more per month.

F. Undermining global security and disarmament
  The US-led war and occupation have galvanized international terrorist 
organizations, placing people not only in Iraq but around the world at 
greater risk of attack. The State Department's annual report on 
international terrorism reported that in 2003 there was the highest 
level of terror-related incidents deemed "significant" than at any time 
since the US began issuing these figures.

G. Global environmental costs
US-fired depleted uranium weapons have contributed to pollution of 
Iraq's land and water, with inevitable spillover effects in other 
countries. The heavily polluted Tigris River, for example, flows 
through Iraq, Iran and Kuwait.

  H. Human rights
The Justice Department memo assuring the White House that torture was 
legal stands in stark violation of the International Convention Against 
Torture (of which the US is a signatory). This, combined with the 
widely publicized mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners by US military and 
intelligence officials, gave new license for torture and mistreatment 
by governments around the world.

Press Release

Press Release from Boycott For Equality

Gays to Withdraw Cash From Banks-Could Total Billions

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Contact: Dale Duncan (757) 257-6215 dsd@boycottforequality.org

Gays to Withdraw Cash from Banks October 8 - Could Total Billions Atlanta, 
GA, September 22, 2004 - Organizers of the Boycott For Equality are 
expanding their nationwide walkout to include a coordinated cash withdrawal 
from the economy on October 8. To demonstrate the need for equality in 
marriage and the workplace, Straight and Gay supporters will each take out 
$80 from their local ATM.

Boycott For Equality expects the action will exhaust the cash in many ATMs, 
leaving a reminder of gay economic power to all who try to use them 
throughout the long bank weekend. To further drive home the lessons taught 
during the Boycott, participants should refer to the Boycott when 
communicating with their elected representatives, particularly when 
candidates ask for money to fund their campaigns. "Let them know you 
participated in the Boycott" explained Duncan. "Just take your ATM receipt, 
cross out your account number, circle your balance, write GAY MONEY on it 
and mail it to campaign headquarters in the postage paid envelope they 
provide. They'll get the message that nobody in America can be taken for 
granted." The amount represents the amount the average member of the 
Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) community contributes to the 
US economy each day, and could grow beyond the $1.4 billion that LGBT 
workers contribute each day - more than $500 billion each year according to 
computations by Washington D.C.-based public relations firm Witeck-Combs 
Communications.

The walkout combines several actions highlighting the various ways that 
Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) Citizens contribute to the 
economy on a regular basis. Other components of the Boycott include a 
one-day work stoppage or "pink flu" day to demonstrate solidarity to 
employers and colleagues; a moratorium on spending for goods and services 
such as gas, food and clothing, to show retailers what would happen if 7% 
of their revenue goes away; closures by sympathetic businesses to make 
their customers aware of how dependent Americans are upon each other; and a 
halt to cell phone use to spread the plea for equality throughout the 
participant's network.

Close to fifty businesses and 15,000 people have already pledged to 
participate using the online forms at the group's web site. Some major 
groups that have endorsed or encouraged Boycott For Equality Day include 
Don't Amend: The Equality Campaign, The Advocate magazine, Civil Marriage 
US, several local PFLAG chapters, DC Diversity, Equality Illinois and 
Wyoming Equality. In at least 36 states it is still legal to fire some one 
because of their sexuality - even if they never bring it into the 
workplace. And nowhere in the United States are these taxpayers able to 
file joint federal income tax, combine tax deductions, or access their 
partner's social security or disability benefits. ----------- Boycott For 
Equality is an Atlanta-based non-profit formed to promote the boycott, 
scheduled this year for October 8.

For that day, GLBT Americans and their straight allies are encouraged to 
withdraw from the economy in five specific areas: 1) Stay home from work. 
Do not generate payroll taxes, income taxes or add to the economy. If you 
run a business, let your customers know by closing for the day. 2) Withdraw 
$80 from your bank account at an ATM. 3) Don't shop. Do not generate sales 
tax or business revenue. 4) Hang up your cell phone. Your silence will 
affect your whole communications network. For more information, visit

Scam.

Any item like that you use an Ebay recommended escrow service. If
they insist on anything else, it's a scam.

I'd suggest drawing them out as much as possible, like they did
on the famous Slashdot "I scammed the scammer" article. Serve them
right.

Subject: [sfraves] Love Parade

So now, instead of fighting off the beginnings of a cold with lots of 
green tea and vitamin C, I'm officially sick.  But it was worth it.

I thing Tigger said it best.  Love Parade was like a "ravers' class 
reunion".  I saw SOOOO many people that I haven't seen in ages.  The 
only difference was, unlike the people I went to high school with, I 
was glad to see everyone I found at Love Parade, and it reminded me how 
much I miss hanging with them, and how I'd really like to see more of 
them.  Fun times.

And the event itself was hella cool too.  More good music than you 
could shake a stick at; and many, Many, MANY people just having fun and 
doing their thing.  Only complaint I could come up with is the woefully 
inadequate number of port-o-lets they had on hand.  But presumably, 
they've learned from that for next years go around.  And damn am I 
looking forward to the next one!

Okay then.  Time to drink see if I can do anything else about this cold.


cya,
john

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Love Parade

I have to agree. For the 1st attempt at a Love Parade here, it was not bad
at all. Some of the floats were a little bland, but there was a ton of good
music - much happiness all around. People just gettin' down and having fun.
Very refreshing, and a helluva nice way to spend a Saturday afternoon. My
only complaint - not enough breaks! Although - someone on what looked like
the Skills float decided to abandon trance for long enough to drop "Alright
All Night" by the Lee Coombs/Christian J, and everyone around the float just
broke out dancing like maniacs in the middle of the street. That was
sweetness....

Next year (if they have it) can only get better. I'd go again...

Subject: [sfraves] How I Spent the Weekend of Love

--=====================_17389104==.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

The Love Parade was an extraordinary event for a first-timer, and I hope it 
becomes a yearly celebration in the City of Love.

The high point of the weekend for me, however, was one of the after 
parties:  this one at Club 6.  Yes, I know I write about Club 6 a lot and I 
rarely see people from the list there.  But it really hit me in the groin 
and heart last night that Angel has achieved something at 6 that I have 
been looking for, and working towards myself, in San Francisco.

As some of you know from reading my House Music 101, I grew up in music and 
dance in primarily African American and Latino subcultures.  As a teenager 
in Pittsburgh, PA, I spent my weekends in the Hill District drinking, 
dancing and socializing in black bars and clubs that played Motown, R&B, 
and Blues.  My favorite radio station was WAMO.  Also made many trips to 
the Chicago scene with my black friends.

When I moved to New York it was the same.  The Loft had a good racial mix, 
and the Paradise Garage was a haven for gay African Americans and 
Latinos.  I was a part of the early rap and hip hop scene and used to 
regularly attend sound system battles in the Bronx.

Arriving in San Francisco with my Hispanic partner in the late eighties, 
the most striking thing we noticed about the gay club scene here and the 
music culture in general was the very small representation of African 
Americans and Hispanics.  It is a dirty little secret in the gay dance 
scene, perhaps not so secret lately, that people of color are discriminated 
against.  I think it's not so move overt, but covert.  One of the major 
promoters in the circuit party community here still brags that the brown 
skinned boys don't patronize his events.  One club event that was an oasis 
in this colorless desert was Page Hodel's Thursday night gay weekly at what 
is now the Justice League.

As time went by the Latino boys created their on gay club nights, and I've 
danced at some of these though I confess I can't deal with some of the Tex 
Mex stuff they spin at times.

The rave community is notable, for whatever reasons, for its lack of 
African Americans although one saw over time more Latinos and b-boys at the 
massives where hip hop, breaks, and jungle were featured.  It's 
encouraging, tho, that there is a growing Asian and Hispanic presence in 
the community.

What to do?  I really like dancing with African Americans.  They have a 
fluidity of style and movement on the dancefloor that inspires me to put 
more effort into my own moves.  And, obviously, I'm physically attracted to 
people of color.  I tried some of the commercial hip hop parties but didn't 
feel many of them were gay friendly.

Then Angle took over Club 6 a couple of years ago.  A man with a clear 
agenda:  to bring together an ethnically diverse dance crowd under one roof 
that was also sexually mixed.  He books quality underground hip hop parties 
regularly as well as house, breaks and other diverse genres.  As time went 
by one saw more and more b-boys coming down to the house floor from the hip 
hop room upstairs and visa versa:  the house heads experienced good hip hop 
and vibe.

Last night was an amazing example of the fruition of his efforts.  There 
were lots of parties last night, but we chose to go to Club 6 because our 
old friend Jesse was spinning, and following him was Roy Davis, Jr.  I 
wondered before we went who would show up to dance to classic, old school 
Chicago house.  Virtually no one I know from the house head crowd 
attended.  Rather -- and this is something I've dreamed about but never 
thought I would see -- the b-boy crowd was well represented with lots of 
people dancing hip hop fashion to soulful Chicago house.  Incredible.

As the evening was coming to an end there were three of us dancing 
energetically in front of the decks:  me, a Latino guy, and this b-boy who, 
in the fashion, was grabbing onto his crotch every four or five seconds, 
smiling at me, and dancing ever so fine.  I found this quite 
compelling.  Then Roy threw on an old house anthem about all the races 
dancing together -- the three of us putting everything into it at this 
point -- and I felt so completely happy and centered.  One of the best 
experiences I've had in ages.

I'm focused on having TrueSkool do a hip hop room at one of Moksha's 
parties.  I know that it took Angel a couple of years to do what he's 
done  at Club 6, but one takes one step at a time.  House and hip hop went 
there own ways at one point, but I think the circle is closing again.  I'd 
like to help make that happen.

Much love,

Apollo

"Enlist one of your friends as a "Crotch-Buddy". Have him concern himself

I'm covered here.

I sometimes wondered why that is, myself.  After all, you see plenty of 
white, Asian, and hispanic ravers of just about every persuasion you 
can think of.  And I can think of a not-insignificant number of ravers, 
I know, of Indian descent, and a good-sized middle-eastern contingent 
too.  And you see plenty of gay, lesbian, and bi ravers; and even the 
occasional transvestite.  So it's not like a case can be made that the 
rave scene wouldn't welcome a black kid in.  But, even if I wrack my 
brain, I can count on one hand the number of black ravers I've seen 
regularly.  And I can only honestly say I "know" one of them.

Curious.

when she saw the dancing people. She had to stop and
watch. 

"I think it's wonderful," she said. "The whole feeling

that they're happy. It's a good feeling. We need a lot
of it."

Didn't take many at the parade. Forgot to charge my batteries and was having 
more fun enjoying the surroundings and skating around. I gotta say - getting 
on skates for an event like that is the way to go. You can get around faster 
and people MOVE the fuck out of your way when they see you coming. =)

Wow, good times.  George C.  on bass guitar & that kid
on the piano rocked out the jams.  The dance floor was
cozy and stuffed.  It's nice to see live instruments
rocking the house.  I had a mighty fine evening.

Saw some good people, too-- Mikey, andy, angie,
Justin, Calamity Jane, and met lot of LA kids.    That
was an exciting night before LP04.

Next year:  a little elbow room at the LP05 landing
spot?  It's hard to freak the ladies when suckaz be
spillin the cash from your blunt papers.

whoop whoop.  Good times, Bay Area.

love,

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Origami bounced Friday at Anu (thump)

Thanks much for coming out, Peter and all the rest of y'all freaks! 
That was the most fun I've had throwing a club night, hands down.  This
party is now a monthly affair, every first friday @ Anu (on 6th st
between Market & Mission in SF), and we're going to have some nifty
lineups coming up in the months ahead.

On the 1s and 2s was my live performance and production partner Andrew
Phelan (www.djandrewphelan.com), a badass man on the decks and behind
the console.  On keys was local phenom Ryan Manley, known for his work
with band Loquat.

Starting off the night was our old pal Justin Hale, housin' the thang
right, and closing it off was AndyW, playing a set unlike anything I've
ever heard from him, absolutely off the hook. :)

To say we were happy with the turnout and the music would be a big

Hi Terry,

	Thanks for the kind words. You have a good memory to recollect the 
party we met at. I wish my own recollection were sharper about all the 
wonderful people I met at so many blissful events. I hope it's true 
that when you die, your life flashes in front of you -- I'm just afraid 
it may happen too fast for me to take notes.

	Anyway, I'm glad we're having this conversation about... what is this 
conversation about? I'm not exactly sure. I'm not even sure what I'm 
doing on this list, or whether I'm a raver any more, or whether there 
is such a thing as a rave "scene" in San Francisco (or anywhere else?) 
now. Maybe this will help me figure it out.

	For me, the magic that happens at a good rave will always be in a 
place by itself. But here I use the term "rave" broadly, to encompass 
any kind of experience of communal love bonding/tribal dancing/altered 
state experience. I have personally found that more strongly in the 
all-night electronic dance community than anywhere else, but I think it 
has happened many times and places throughout history.

	And I think it's important to have a sense of that. Back in the day, I 
often shared the sense, talking with other ravers whether in person or 
online, that we were part of something historic. Something that had 
changed our lives, an exciting social and technological phenomenon. I 
always wanted the scene to be more consciously about changing the 
world. I applauded the elements that made raves distinctly raves -- the 
illicit nature of the rave, the colorful clothing and accessories, the 
love puddles, the things like bouncy castles and brainwave machines 
that no one had thought of bringing to dance parties before. No one 
talked about "candy ravers" at the start, because that perspective was 
so mainstream within the rave culture that it didn't need a special 
category to describe it.

	I remember getting into an argument with one of the guys who worked at 
Ameba on upper Haight. Not Amoeba Records, but the small clothing and 
ephemera store that used to be across the street. That store had more 
of the flavor of the scene than any other store I'm aware of, except 
perhaps for "Raver Books" in Seattle (Groovin' Kim, you in the house?). 
Anyway, they had a display of rave hats -- you know, now that I think 
about it, maybe the display was at Villains down the street. Whatever, 
they had a display where they had taken a bunch of rave-type headgear 
and put them on top of very dark looking skulls. I found this deeply 
unfortunate, even offensive. Although I'd previously embraced a lot of 
goth culture myself, and still loved dark fantasy, cemeteries, the Cure 
and so on, I felt that to mix this kind of thing with the positive vibe 
of the rave scene was a complete corruption of what the spirit of 
raving was about. The guy made the counterargument of pointing to the 
Grateful Dead, perhaps the seminal band of the '60s era, and their use 
of skeletons in their artwork, not to mention the band's name itself. 
But it felt different to me. I didn't know that much about the Dead and 
still don't really, but their artwork has generally seemed to me to 
have more of a cheerful quality, as if they were laughing at death, 
trying to remind people of the transience of life, but in a 
non-threatening, playful kind of way. The evil-looking plastic skulls 
wearing the rave hats didn't give me that feeling. Around this time or 
perhaps a bit later I also remember a few parties that tried to promote 
the idea of "gravers" -- a mixing of goth and rave culture. Fortunately 
this ungodly concept never quite caught on -- no big surprise there! 
But I saw this type of thing, and many other influences, perhaps most 
notably the continuing mainstreaming of rave in all its manifestations, 
slowly diluting the energy of the scene, chipping away at the sense of 
what it meant to be a raver.

	Like I said, I always wanted ravers to be more conscious of the scene 
as a kind of project to change the world. But many never wanted that -- 
they wanted to have fun partying, and nothing more. Some people thought 
(probably still think) that what happened was a result of the music, 
and that the spirit of raving was uniquely tied to electronic dance 
music, perhaps even particular forms of electronic dance music. While I 
think electronic dance music is very well suited to orgiastic communal 
bonding experiences of the type we seek, I think other forms could 
potentially work just as well in the right place and time -- Sufi 
music, the Grateful Dead (whom I've never enjoyed all that much 
musically, but I love their fans), etc.

	Hmm... this message is rambling all over the place again. I don't know 
exactly what I want to say. It would be nice to have a sense of who's 
out there. How many people are on SFRaves now? How many of you have 
taken Ecstasy? How many of you consider yourself idealists? I think 
idealism is incredibly important to our scene. Anyone who dares to 
imagine the world much better than it is, after all, is an idealist. 
And if we can't (or won't) imagine a better world, how are we ever 
going to get there? It's been said that the only constant is change, 
and this is true. So why do people sort of settle for the idea that 
things aren't going to change that much -- that really wonderful, 
positive change is out of the question? I don't think I'm unrealistic 
about it, but maybe I have a rare gift for being able to maintain an 
optimistic outlook alongside a clear-headed view of reality. I don't 
think history is preordained to end in 2012, or that humanity is going 
to undergo some kind of marvelous transformation at that time. But if 
you can believe in something like that without fear of becoming 
disillusioned if it *doesn't* come to pass, then by all means believe! 
If enough people believe, it may happen. Or perhaps the expected good 
will not come about, but something else positive and unexpected will 
manifest.

	In 1967, Jerry Rubin and the Yippies led an anti-war protest in 
Washington D.C. to the Pentagon, where they sat down and attempted to 
use their minds to levitate the building away into space. I was at a 
lecture where this event was being talked about by someone who had been 
there, and he said that many of the people present actually expected 
the effort to *work*. Some, he said, even claimed to have seen the 
Pentagon rise a couple inches off the ground. Nuts? In a literal sense, 
certainly. Well, I'm 99.9% certain. But there was something beautiful 
about making the effort, even if from a political standpoint I wish 
they would have taken less of a knee-jerk anti-American posture and 
also gone after the Viet-Cong and international communism, which really 
were much worse than the U.S. government, even if the administration 
had horribly botched the war in Vietnam.

	Well, I guess what I'd like to see, what I believe would really make a 
difference, is to have a renaissance within the rave scene to reclaim 
the true spirit of raving as a conscious, idealistic project to change 
the world. Because without that kind of focus on larger goals and 
vision, it's too easy to get sidetracked. "If you don't stand for 
something, you'll go for anything" -- words of wisdom.

Peace, love & liberty,

I certainly hope so too. It was so great to see people from all facets
of the EDM community out here united in a single cause. Next year should
be even bigger and crazier!

Friday night was a great way to wind things up. George and Andrew: great
job getting all those peeps out for a night of housey goodness.
Unfortunately I missed the bi-curious makeout session, but I had to
catch Stewart Walker at Rx. I have to say though, that place is really
wierd. Maybe it's the crappy sound; maybe it's the disproportionately
male clientelle; maybe it's the lack of a full bar. Whatever it is, this
place just never seems to go off, despite all the amazing talent they
bring in. Needless to say, after a while we were on our way back to Anu
to catch the remainder of Andy's painfully entertaining 90's house set.

Then, the parade. Melissa and I got there at noon to help out, but it
was pretty poorly organized so we just ended up mulling around watching
people set up. One thing I would stress, now that you all know what it's
about, is for more people to VOLUNTEER next year. It's pretty amazing
that things went as well as they did, given that there were less than 20
volunteers this year (aside from dedicated parade staff). But with more
people from our community involved next year, it can only get better.

Now, for those of you with future float aspirations, I have some
recommendations:

1) talk to people that did floats this year; there's much to be learned
   in the art of securing turntables and sound systems on a flatbed full
   of dancing people.
2) if you go, save your shit (costumes, art car decorations, etc.) from
   Burning Man. You will save a TON money.
3) start planning now!

The festival afterwards was kind of lame, IMO--like a massive with
several really small, relatively underwhelming sound setups. I guess
it was a lot easier to organize than an "official" stage featuring
talent booked separately by all of the float staff though. Anyway, at
that point I was a bit tired and my brownie was kicking in, so I had to
get home and catch some sleep before my door shift at...

LOVE MACHINE! With the exception of some issues with bathrooms and water
(seemingly unavoidable at that venue), everything went smoothly and
people appeared to be having a great time. The only DJ I was able to
catch a good deal of was Forest Green, on point as usual with the
totally seamless dancefloor techno mixing skills. I caught bits of
Mochipet and Brizzle's merciless live performances, and an excellent
electro/breaks set by Saru. Cheers to those of you that stuck around
late enough to catch me (and Amber) winding things down upstairs. I
think the playlist speaks for itself:

Terence FM - Feelin' Kinda High (Cajual)
Ricardo Villalobos - What You Say Is More Than I Can Say (Playhouse)
John Shananigans - Charlie's On the Dancefloor (Cynosure)
Ricardo vs. Jay - Cactus Love (Contexterrior)
John Tejada & Arian Leviste - Ghetto Platypus (Palette)
Copacabannark - Garden Parade (Perlon)
Ectomorph - Ritmo Sinestro (Interdimensional Transmissions)
L'usine - Push (Ghostly International)
Unai - Night Fell (And So Did We) (Sub Static)
2 Dollar Egg - Implantat (Klang Elektronik)

Good times. Let's do it again!

Subject: [sfraves] Spirit of Raving (or E vs LSD)

It just striked me recently that the phase "the spirit of raving"
implied something very fundamental about what I missed from our scene:
spirituality.

Whether PLUR is a good slogan or if kids these that actually live by
the motto is besides the point. The slogan entirely omitted the
spiritual aspect of our scene.

Before E became the drug of choice, acid ruled the scene. Our
objective of the night wasn't getting blissfully E'ed out and jump
into hug puddles at every corner. Instead, we were trying to preceive
the world in a new light and raise ourselves collectively to a higher
consciousness.

Yes, "higher state of consciousness". It used to be a catch phase.
Spitituality was a major focus in our scene, now the idea all but
disappeared. Coincidentally, it's when PLUR and E became popular (in
the mid '90s).

Have we all been consumed by the need of artificial, chemically
induced empathy and compassion? Have we fogotten that what connect us
together is more than just music and philosophy, but our collective,
singular existence beyond our physical reality?

Just thinking our loud.


Love,

- Jeff

Subject: [sfraves] [skylab2000] Whistle!



Back in March of 2000, when the scene was in full swing, the massive Whistle 3 party took place at the South Jersey Expo Center. About 10,000 people were there to see a lineup of the best live performers and DJs the US scene had to offer. 

Yep, skylab2000 played there, and it still stands out as one of the best shows we have ever played!

This weekend, in Philadelhia, Local 13 presents Whistle 4!!!

Yes, skylab2000 will be there, playing a 100% live set.

Subject: [sfraves] interactive music machine available

hi list -

i've been lurking for ages but i'm stepping out of the shadows to say -
i'm part of an arts collective that has built an interactive
sound sculpture that allows up to four players to do live
remixing/performance of original (and some plundered) electronic music,
ambient and dance.  we've had our improbable orchestra at burning man for
the last three years, and especially this last year, people reacted really
positively.  so, any promoter on this list who would like to break down
the dancer/dj divide at your event - this is you chance, we are
available.

IO consists of four speakers on stands, pointing inwards,
arranged in a circle around a central control podium which lights up at
night.  This podium has on it four control stations with a number of knobs
and buttons that allow non-musician players easy but thorough control over
the music that is playing.  please see:

http://xiphoidprocess.com/io/

for detailed description, photos, and video (i've found that it's much
easier for people to grasp what this thing does after watching the
videos).

we can tailor the music our machine makes to your event - for example, if
you're going to have detroit techno party, we'll sample a bunch of detroit
techno records - then you can have people dancing to techno djs in one
room, and people being their own techno djs in another room with our
machine.

please email me if you're interested.  also, if you saw us at burning man
i'd be curious to know what you thought...

jacob

what's great about that picture is the way it's framed
 by a pointing finger, a middle finger, and someone
with his jaw open.  Nice vector angles.

Tom Wax (Phuture Wax, Frankfurt)

DJ Pat (Teknique, Sacramento)

=20

For those of you that are sitting there thinking "I know that name" but
just can't remember where u heard it, Tom Wax pretty much invented the
German techno sound.  In addition to putting out literally hundreds of
records over the last 15 years under names like Arpeggiators, Microbots,
DJ Tom + Norman, AWeX, etc., he's also remixed just about everybody on
the planet from Erasure and Depeche Mode to Hardfloor.  And if producing
the longest discography in all of EDM over the years wasn't enough, Tom
has spent the last 15 years personally shaping the sound of underground
music.  His most notable work in this department was working as A&R
manager for Harthouse where he pushed new artists like Cari Lekebush.
He's worked for a number of other labels over the years but none more
important than his own Phuture Wax label, where he launched the careers
of numerous artists like Timo Maas, Terry Lee Brown Jr. Jean Frank
Cochois, and so on.  Whether you like hard minimal techno, deep house,
tech-house or trance, Tom has had a hand in shaping that sound.  So for
those of you that wouldn't normally come out to a "Techno" oriented
club, tonight is the night you will want to check it out! =20

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Gays to Withdraw Cash From Banks-Could Total Billions

It's actually a secret plan by Bush administration to obtain a secret
database of gay americans. The banks will turn over pics/videos of
every ATM customers who withdraw $80 that day to the Dept of Homeland
Security, along with their detailed personal information, their
lifetime bank statements, etc. The Bush Adminstration plan to draft
every gay person who make under $25,000 a year into the military and
send them to Iraq. Since they have little contribution to the economy,
and typically have no legal spouses nor children, ttheir casualities
will result in little financial consequences to the gorvernment.

Welcome to the police state. Mwhahahahahaha

Instead of the need for artificial, chemically induced enlightment?

I am not anti-drug, but I don't think it is fair to say that acid=good
for scene, e=bad.  Whats enlightment without love?  Whats love without
enlightment?   I think the key is to take the lessons learned from 
these substances and apply them to your everyday, non-chemical life,
and know when you have learned all there is to learn.  True love,
red wine and a hottub is just as good as the phatest hit of e.  A computer
loaded with the latest music software is more fun than acid.  Or is that
a computer loaded with Acid is as good as acid?  

Man, if I owned a hot tub, I would never ever need drugs.

I think I've said it before, but a huge way to impact the economy is to
take your money out of the bank/s&l (are they still around?) and move it
into a credit union.  Take it out of the hands of the power players.
Read up on it.

The key word is "consumed", not "arrificial". Physical euphoria is
more instantly gratifying than spiritual enlightment.

It never fails that whenever an arguement mewntions drugs, someone
will reducie it to the drugs alone.

I was speaking mostly in terms of how the scene used to be spirituality-driven.

I think the last scene to really have true spirtuality was goa/psy-trance,
but lately it has succumb to being simply harder and darker.

Truth is, most people don't like sprituality in their scene.  They want
to party, not go to church.

There is such a fine line between true spirituality and hippie mumbo-jumbo..
or worse, true spiritualty and cult-like cliques.

Its out there, people still do spiritual-oriented parties.  I think much
of what goes on at Cell Space falls into the catagory.  

Lots of people think Goa Gill parties are pretty spiritual...

I am going to start selling hot tubs to afford drugs.

Man - almost any SERIOUS house club IS like going to church. What more 
spirituality do you need than jackin' yer body with a few hundred other 
folks, all blissed out on the beautiful beats??? That tribal feeling, the 
primal feeling - that's what it's all about.

I think you can get your "spirituality" on with any kind of EDM, if that's 
what moves your soul....

Well, to each his own.  I'm not sure what needs to be "refuted" here, but I 
do know that many people in the community, both gay, straight and in da 
middle are going to withdraw the $80 and document it.  No real sweat of my

John Edwards 'Increased the Cost of Medicine', Former Associate Says
By Marc Morano
CNSNews.com Senior Staff Writer
February 10, 2004

(CNSNews.com) - A former North Carolina obstetrician-gynecologist who =20=

served as an expert witness and consultant to Sen. John Edwards during =20=

his days as a trial lawyer, now accuses the Democratic presidential =20
candidate of increasing the cost of medicine and forcing doctors into =20=

retirement in the senator's home state.

"What he has done with those lawsuits is increased the cost of =20
medicine, and he has not changed the practice of medicine in a way that =20=

you can see that there are fewer cases of cerebral palsy," William =20
Brannan said in an interview with CNSNews.com.

As CNSNews.com first reported on Jan. 20, Edwards won record jury =20
verdicts and settlements by arguing that in certain cases, =20
obstetricians and the hospitals where they practiced had been =20
responsible for botching the treatment of women in labor and the =20
delivery of their babies.

It was that botched treatment, Edwards argued, that resulted in the =20
infants sustaining either brain damage or developing cerebral palsy, a =20=

brain disorder that causes motor function impairment and lifelong =20
disability.

Brannan, the chief medical officer of Mission Hospitals in Asheville, =20=

N.C., said he was forced to end his medical practice this year because =20=

of skyrocketing medical insurance premiums. Brannan said he consulted =20=

for Edwards in an attempt to "bring only the valid cases into the legal =20=

system."

Edwards' campaign metaphors about standing up for the poor and =20
underprivileged in the battle between the "two Americas" does not =20
resonate with Brannan.

"I have some argument with [Edwards's] idea that he's out there to help =20=

the poor person and that he's out there helping all. No, he was very =20
selective in his cases, and went for those that were going to go for =20
large judgments," Brannan said.

"He was not an individual that would go out and help the poor person =20
who needed help in a low-dollar amount. If you look at his cases, they =20=

were all high-dollar amount and he didn't work for low-dollar =20
settlements," he added.

Brannan's role as a consultant and sometimes expert witness for Edwards =20=

and his legal firm allowed him to see Edwards's career up close.

"He was an expert at getting [cerebral palsy cases] settled without =20
going into the courtroom," Brannan said.

Brannan is very skeptical of Edwards' and other trial lawyers' =20
accomplishments in seeking to blame infant cerebral palsy cases on =20
botched labor and deliveries.

"I don't think that there is a correlation between bad medical practice =20=

and the incidence of cerebral palsy," Brannan said.

"Studies that we have done have found no changes in the incidences of =20=

cerebral palsy occurring either with increased vigilance...or the =20
increase in C-section rates that have occurred," he said.

Despite the scientific evidence, Brannan is not optimistic that medical =20=

malpractice cerebral palsy cases will fade from the courtroom anytime =20=

soon.

"Most juries have a live person in the room that they feel sympathy =20
for, and it's very hard to make the cold statistics of a scientific =20
study cancel out the sympathy that they feel," Brannan said.

"So most of juries, knowing that there are insurance policies behind =20
all of these [cases], will then want this family to have something to =20=

be able to provide care for the child," he added.

Edwards defends legal career

Edwards has conceded that infant cerebral palsy usually is not the =20
fault of the doctors who deliver the baby -- even though he argued =20
otherwise in his days as a trial lawyer.

According to an article in the New York Times on January 31, "...Mr. =20
Edwards did not dispute the contention...that few cases of cerebral =20
palsy are caused by mishandled deliveries." Edwards did say that during =20=

his legal career, he represented only the few cases that were the =20
exceptions to the rule.

Edwards was responding to allegations first reported by CNSNews.com on =20=

Jan. 20. The CNSNews.com report noted that a large part of Edwards' =20
legal career was based on "junk science," which he used to win hugely =20=

lucrative legal judgments or settlements against the medical profession.

The outcome of those cases, many of them dealing with the debatable =20
cause of cerebral palsy in infants, made Edwards a rich man, allowing =20=

him to self-finance a 1998 run for the U.S. Senate from North Carolina =20=

and position himself as a presidential candidate in 2004.

The CNSNews.com report pointed to medical studies, dating back to at =20
least the 1980s, which asserted that doctors could do very little to =20
cause cerebral palsy during the birthing process. Two new studies in =20
2003 further undermined the scientific premise of the high-profile =20
court cases won by Edwards.

Edwards now insists that the cerebral cases he represented were the =20
exceptions.

"I took very seriously our responsibility to determine if our cases =20
were merited," Edwards told the New York Times in the January 30 =20
interview, just days after refusing to answer CNSNews.com's questions =20=

on the same topic.

"Before I ever accepted a brain-injured child case, we would spend =20
months investigating it," Edwards added.

The Times article noted that between 1985 and 1995, "Edwards filed at =20=

least 20 similar lawsuits against doctors and hospitals in deliveries =20=

gone wrong, winning verdicts and settlements of more than $60 million, =20=

typically keeping about a third."

'Crisis'

Brannan believes that Edwards did his part to contribute to the =20
American Medical Association's listing of North Carolina as one of the =20=

"crisis states" for rising liability insurance.

Many physicians in the state are opting to quit their practices because =20=

they cannot afford the insurance premiums, according to Brannan.

The hospital that Brannan now serves as the chief medical officer also =20=

has been the target of Edwards and his law firm.

"Our hospital (Mission Hospitals, formerly St Joseph's) had two major =20=

suits brought by [Edwards's] law firm -- one of which he was able to =20
prevail and got a judgment, and another one his firm lost," Brannan =20
noted.

Brannan said he personally was forced to stop his Ob/Gyn practice when =20=

his insurance premiums shot up.

"My premium two years ago was $44,000 a year, and my insurance carrier =20=

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Gays to Withdraw Cash From Banks-Could Total Billions

Whom ever thinks this would do nothing is not far from a moron. I
think the last time I saw an actual count they said there was a
million + gays in America. Do the math if all the gay people and
friends of gay people pull 80 bucks out each that will put a serious
dent into the banks. I think it would make quite a bold statement.

"Not everyone understands House music; it's a spiritual thing; a body 
thing; a soul thing."

I've written lots on this subject in House Music 101 and elsewhere.  I 
think one has to define the term "spirituality":  it means different things 
to different people.  I've never been to a party that is 
"religion-based,"  but I've been to many where I've touched the sun, meshed 
with the flesh, and moved outside my own, often dismal little world.

As for religion I guess I'm more a pagan who practices Buddhism as a 
personal discipline.  I used to be an atheist.  Then I thought that it was 
much more fun to "believe" in a world of magic:  a place where Pan with 
hooves and a big dick runs amok;  where the sun is actually a "god" with a 
chariot who manifests truth and music.  LOL.  What difference does it 
make?  I'm not going to spend my time these days waiting for Godot and 
dealing with existentialist dilemmas.

As for goofrider's comment on LSD vs MDMA -- 'tis true that many in the 
rave community and in the dance scene as a whole from the seventies onward 
used acid and magic mushrooms to enhance perception and embark on personal, 
often epic, journeys of the body and soul.  Then MDMA was added to the mix, 
which introduced some empathy into the stew.

What I see these days are folks either numbing themselves with booze (or 
worse heroin) or burning themselves up with performance drugs like cocaine 
(the choice of executives even now) or speed.

Then I guess there are hot tubs and juice:)

People do what they will to make this arduous journey of life a bit easier 
and more meaningful.  I prefer a place where I can play with the wood 
nymphs, dance with Dionysus, and talk with some shamans once in 
awhile.  Magic.  I'm so burned out on cynicism and darkness.

Love,

Apollo

Subject: [sfraves] So much for a QA job. :)

Well, it looks like my QA skills are a bit lacking in some areas.  I
just realized that 2 of the songs that I had online as part of my most
recent mix were incorrect. (Tracks 10 and 11 to be specific.)  SO, if
you listened to it, and thought that there was some space/time
distortion kind of thing going on, try again.

And I'm afraid that's the only space/time distortion I have control over
right now.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Gays to Withdraw Cash From Banks-Could Total Billions

yo, Mary,

Babs and i are both doing this as a show of solidarity, and I'm about
as straight as you can get.

I posted this on the the DC Craigslist Rants and Raves section, and
one guy wrote back calling me gay because I used the word 'breeder' in
a sentence, and he also called this almost as dumb as the FMA itself.

sigh.

I stopped short of calling him a 'Capo,' which was my first gut
instinct, when i posted back, but i did say that there were some black
folk in Montgomery that did ride the busses, and there were white
people that joined that boycott, and that one of the reasons that I'm
going to do this is to take up their slack.

I also got a chilly response when I walked into a few local stores
that had Rainbow flags on them to let the people working there now
about this and what keywords to use to find out about it on google.

Took me by surprise, since this is such a simple idea.

Also surprised that i'm not seeing this all over the different cities
that Craigslists has in the personals, rants and raves and forum
sections, that strikes me as the most obvious place to virally market
this idea, give the explosive, exponential growth he's seen on there
in the last year.

And finally, Nick, my guess is is that number is much higher, think
overall gay population, in any given country on earth, is somewhere in
the 7-10% range of population.

Figure the USA is somewhere around 270 million people and key off of
that and the number gets much higher.

This is a process, be interesting how much play it gets in the
mainstream press this weekend, and it would be even crazier if it
actually had an effect that rippled out from the banks to Wall Street.

btw, speaking of which, since the Stock Market is essentially at the
same spot today, the lower 10,000 range, to where it was on September
10th, 2001, why is Wall Street still giving Bush the time of day and
why isn't Kerry all over that?

It's the Economy, Sweetheart.

frankly, i think a new drug would revive everything
rave. everyone could go back to wearing their
shittiest clothes without caring, making 10 friends a
night, and not remembering a damn thing about the
previous night but with the reassurance that it was
really fun. 
yeah.

"The government, which was designed for the people, has got into the hands 
of the bosses and their employers, the special interests.  An invisible 
empire has been set up above the forms of democracy."
-Woodrow Wilson

"There are times when you have to obey a call which is the highest of all, 
i.e. the voice of conscience even though such obedience may cost many a 
bitter tear, and even more, separation from friends, from family, from the 
state to which you may belong, from all that you have held as dear as life 
itself. For this obedience is the law of our being."

	I wish CNSNews was a libertarian news service -- we could use one. If  
you're commenting on the fact that the article has an apparent point of

control that process. The more election monitors the better, as far as  
I'm concerned, and I hope that lots of monitors from other countries  
are watching the U.S. elections, not just a handful invited by  
left-wing members of Congress or left-wing groups like Global Exchange.

Elections Department in San Francisco, over the past couple weeks to  
urge that the department immediately release all the raw data on vote  
totals on election night, instead of only the first-ranked results for  
the races using ranked-choice voting, as they are apparently planning  
to do.

	Anyone who wants the vote results to be as transparent and free from  
potential malfeasance as possible should be in favor of all voting  
results immediately being released to the public and to the media as  
soon as they are tallied, and I encourage people to call the SF DOE at  
(415) 554-4375 to request that this be done.

Seemed that it was coming from the libertarian slant to me.  As was a
fair # of the other articles available on that site.

Are you implying that they might not be honest in their judgements?

I had heard that they were planning on doing just that.  Either that, or
I was having a hallucination. :)

Even better yet is to continue the tradition of (generally highly
accurate) exit polls.  Which unfortunately seem to have been dropped,
since the recent voting machines don't seem to be so accurate for
whatever reasons.

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Voter registration

SO, I'm trying to figure out the most likely reasons why someone might
be removed from the voting polls.  And about all I can come up with are
either of the following two reasons:
1. You've not voted in any of the previous 4 elections.
2. You've submitted a change of address form with the U.S.P.S. (does a
'vacation' request count?  What if mail accidently got returned for an
extended period of time.)

Does anyone know the qualifications actually written into the statutes?
I've heard that as many as 30% of folks who think they're registered may
actually not be.  And that scares me.  Who knows the truth??

Subject: [sfraves] conspiracy or coincidence...

I came into my cube this morning, and, lo and behold, tacked to my 
bulletin board, was a Wal-Mart Connect CD.  Now I can't help but 
wonder... is this some unsuspecting co-worker's idea of a joke, or is 
the CIA / G8 / 2008 Olympic committee trying to intimidate me?

"The government, which was designed for the people, has got into the hands 
of the bosses and their employers, the special interests.  An invisible 
empire has been set up above the forms of democracy."
-Woodrow Wilson

"There are times when you have to obey a call which is the highest of all, 
i.e. the voice of conscience even though such obedience may cost many a 
bitter tear, and even more, separation from friends, from family, from the 
state to which you may belong, from all that you have held as dear as life 
itself. For this obedience is the law of our being."
   Gandhi

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

message to us from Dale Duncan, boycott organizer:

< Anytime our issues are on the front burner, we win.

There are 17 million of us (Forbes.com).  We spend $1.4 Billion per day.
If just 25% of us do this (about 4 million) and take one straight ally
with us, we will have about 8 million participants.  If the cynics drop
the negativity and unify, that will send a powerful message.

Cynics have never been on the forefront of great change.  We have an
opportunity to send a clear message....if we seize the moment.

Please forward this to your circle of friends who are cynical....

Thanks,

Dale Duncan >


so please don't be cynical!

let's seize the moment!  :)

c'mon!  it'll be the greatest if we do this and it works!

Press Release from Boycott For Equality

Gays to Withdraw Cash From Banks-Could Total Billions

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Contact: Dale Duncan (757) 257-6215 dsd@boycottforequality.org

Gays to Withdraw Cash from Banks October 8 - Could Total Billions Atlanta,
GA, September 22, 2004 - Organizers of the Boycott For Equality are
expanding their nationwide walkout to include a coordinated cash withdrawal

from the economy on October 8. To demonstrate the need for equality in
marriage and the workplace, Straight and Gay supporters will each take out
$80 from their local ATM.

Boycott For Equality expects the action will exhaust the cash in many ATMs,

leaving a reminder of gay economic power to all who try to use them
throughout the long bank weekend. To further drive home the lessons taught
during the Boycott, participants should refer to the Boycott when
communicating with their elected representatives, particularly when
candidates ask for money to fund their campaigns. "Let them know you
participated in the Boycott" explained Duncan. "Just take your ATM receipt,

cross out your account number, circle your balance, write GAY MONEY on it
and mail it to campaign headquarters in the postage paid envelope they
provide. They'll get the message that nobody in America can be taken for
granted." The amount represents the amount the average member of the
Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) community contributes to the
US economy each day, and could grow beyond the $1.4 billion that LGBT
workers contribute each day - more than $500 billion each year according to

computations by Washington D.C.-based public relations firm Witeck-Combs
Communications.

The walkout combines several actions highlighting the various ways that
Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) Citizens contribute to the
economy on a regular basis. Other components of the Boycott include a
one-day work stoppage or "pink flu" day to demonstrate solidarity to
employers and colleagues; a moratorium on spending for goods and services
such as gas, food and clothing, to show retailers what would happen if 7%
of their revenue goes away; closures by sympathetic businesses to make
their customers aware of how dependent Americans are upon each other; and a

halt to cell phone use to spread the plea for equality throughout the
participant's network.

Close to fifty businesses and 15,000 people have already pledged to
participate using the online forms at the group's web site. Some major
groups that have endorsed or encouraged Boycott For Equality Day include
Don't Amend: The Equality Campaign, The Advocate magazine, Civil Marriage
US, several local PFLAG chapters, DC Diversity, Equality Illinois and
Wyoming Equality. In at least 36 states it is still legal to fire some one
because of their sexuality - even if they never bring it into the
workplace. And nowhere in the United States are these taxpayers able to
file joint federal income tax, combine tax deductions, or access their
partner's social security or disability benefits. ----------- Boycott For
Equality is an Atlanta-based non-profit formed to promote the boycott,
scheduled this year for October 8.

For that day, GLBT Americans and their straight allies are encouraged to
withdraw from the economy in five specific areas: 1) Stay home from work.
Do not generate payroll taxes, income taxes or add to the economy. If you
run a business, let your customers know by closing for the day. 2) Withdraw

$80 from your bank account at an ATM. 3) Don't shop. Do not generate sales
tax or business revenue. 4) Hang up your cell phone. Your silence will
affect your whole communications network. For more information, visit

Let's also not forget that we're in the midst of a serious drought of 
our holy water, too; since the Wamego bust 
(http://www.cjonline.com/webindepth/missilesilos/) folks have been 
pretty hard up for a glimpse of the Godhead around these parts...

Subject: RE: [sfraves] BSP: Freaker's Ball

You know I have been to the freakers ball several times and I am done with 
it.  For one, all the Santa Cruz djs (moontribe 13) will be playing the same 
tribal breaks they have always played for the same group of people that they 
always play to.   The freakers ball is the one party that they throw every 
year where they invite other dj's from elsewhere to come and play with them. 
  You almost cannot find a more clicky group of party kids in Cali. I am 
very surprised that they have Tom L-G playing, he is a great techno dj and a 
wonderful guy.  He and Jeno will tear shit up, that is if these two actually 
got decent set times to play.  Maybe cuz they only have a set 15 dj's who 
always play there parties they thought it would be a good idea.  Not only 
that, the Civic auditorium is a shitty venue for a party.

wow, I am talking shit, crazy...

Subject: [sfraves] nrr: looking for a career change for music

Hey Peeps,

I'm really fucking tired of doing shit that I really
dont want to do. I'm looking for an entry level job in
the music industry to get me started on my career. ( I
eventually want to record/produce, possibly own a
record label, or get into artist management or law). 

I was wondering if any of you have any pointers as far
as finding these jobs. I would be willing to start as
a clerical/admin because i have these skills, or even
an internship doing something.

If any of you can help me out let me know...

Thanks!
Delia:)

Subject: [sfraves] Fall and new leaves?

So what the heck is it about fall that people start getting their shit in
order? I've noticed a bit of a trend -- in my circle of friends and
acquaintances, at least -- of people coming to harsh realizations and
getting their butts into gear once summer totally shits itself and the
long winter haul draws near. People seem to start cutting back on or
terminating their drug intake; slow down on parties; start thinking more
seriously about work and school and their lives.

Anyone else taken notice of this?

Delia,
I would consider going back to school.  More specifically, a tech college to 
get your feet wet with the gear (soundboards, micing, wiring etc.)  I could 
recommend the Recording Workshop (some in CA) which has a quick six week course 
not to bad on the $$.
This will show any employer that you mean business.  Or better, Fullsail 
which has numerous degrees.  Look into it.  I dont want to burst bubbles but if 
you have no other music industry experience, you will be the last in a very long 
line to 
"get to play with the goodies".  But of course if you can book a PA 
(production assistant)
gig, you will learn more in a year than some do with four years of college.  
Start calling all studios, and dont forget media/video production facilities 
in your area and ask if they are hiring PAs.  Most likely you will come across 
one or two cuz a lot of these outfits go through PAs like toilet paper.  You 
will work like a dog till all hours and get treated like shit and pay>?!  HA>!  
Dont expect much.  But after a year you will know more about the industry 
than you want to.  And you will have somthing to boast about on your resume and 
next interview.  Then decide if its for you.  I would say that its not all 
glitz and glamour.
No matter what industry your in you still have to deal with overbearing 
bosses, bullshit tightwad clients and all the politics that come along with it.  
There are so many nich
Good luck

Jon

Fullsail, or the Conservatory down in Tempe Arizona - another great 
recording school.

Don't bother trying to get into the music industry on an entry level basis, 
unless u wanna do shitwork for the next 10 years or so.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] BSP: Freaker's Ball

Hey.. being an SC resident and hearing of few parties myslef.. I can attest 
that yes.. you do have to be in the know.. but that is just life in the 831. 
  I also wanted to correct you on a major oversite.. although I do not think 
it is one for the better per se.. They are holding this years event at the 
Vetran's Hall.. two stories, indoor and outdoor venue, but smaaaaalllllll.  
I dunno how they will fit as many people as normally would attend in such a 
small venue.

I also wanted to point out that Lorin is playing this year, with Hamsa 
Lila,and Goddesses of Funk, the all female percussion group, with other such 
live acts that I think will really make it a memerable occasion.   Hamsa 
Lila is amazing, and Lorin coming off of BM 2004 is in fine form.  It should 
be a very true Santa Cruz event.. very close to the hearts of all who live 
here.. so if you want to get in on the vibe.. this is the ONE event to get 
at, got it, good! :)

ma $.02 from the 831.
Cheers,
Ranger

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Fall and new leaves?

And thank goodness for that. I'm damn ready for the summer madness to end 
about now. At least here that is. Too many of the same circles treaded and 
time to switch that up. Thailand it is to start. From there it's off to 
other warm spots until Europe gets out of the winter nasties. Maybe I'll 
endup in Tahoe for boarding season. I'm kissing the well paying corporate 
job goodbye. Turning my back on everything that's my safety blanket and 
finally doing what I need to. I guess that's getting your shit together. I 
can't wait either way. Just need more $$ and I'm set. I also think with the 
coming elections and the general uncertainty in the world that people are 
going for the things that are secure and safe. They're thinking long and 
hard about what THEY need to be happy. Also toss in an age factor and people 
are just growing up man and taking their lives seriously...

Subject: Re: [sfraves] nrr: looking for a career change for music

If you're looking to get in on the administrative/business side of
things, a business degree program and as much industry schmoozing as
you can stand would be a good course of action.  If you want to be a
recording engineer, producer, or artist, you will probably be better
served by sinking that big recording school dough into a home recording
setup you can really start doing your thing with.

The big recording schools will acquaint you with lots of high-end
equipment, and prepare you well to intern at a major studio, but ~$25k
will buy you a top-flight project studio setup these days.  Most folks
I've talked to in the industry consider heavy hands-on experience in
engineering fundamentals to be more valuable than a certificate or
degree.

I used to advocate recording schools for my friends that wanted a fast
track way to learn, but in the end most of them have told me they'd
rather have invested in their own setups and had something functional
to work with, in the end.  It's nice to have your hands on
multi-million-dollar gear, but engineering is a skill that scales
exceptionally well.  A person who is familiar with a well-equipped home
setup and reads a few textbooks will generally be able to work in a
large studio with a minor leap of thought.

Case in point: I've had only cursory experience with large consoles, as
my background is in digital audio workstations and small-to-mid size
project studios.  A few weeks ago I showed up to a big studio and
needed to operate an SSL console- a 20-foot-wide, $750,000 beast.  I
looked at the board for a few minutes as the other engineer did some
tasks, asked about 3 questions, let go of my fear, and I was rockin'
with little incident.  

Also, if one *really* wants to get in at the ground floor of the
mainstream music business and make it their living, it's almost
imperative that one lives in a major music market - LA, Nashville and
NYC all come to mind and one's choice between them hinges mainly on
what kind of music and/or work you're interested in.  I do a lot of
music stuff but my interest is not in commercial music or engineering
as a profession, so the bay area suits me fine.

YMMV, just my thoughts.  Not that you won't learn a lot and gain some
great experience/contacts through these schools- they just seem to have
become an outdated concept.  Large studios (and the job paths within
them) are, sadly, a dying breed.

I just got a new, fairly well paying job that has the potential to be very
good for me in the long run, and it appears as though I'll finally be able
to situate myself a bit better as a result.

I've always loved fall - it always seems to bring me a much needed stroke of
luck. My summers have consistantly lacked. Now if only I could bypass Xmas
altogether - I'd be set....

Yeah I'm definitely going to school for sure. I just
want to work my way through school while doing
something that will actually help my overall career.
Thanks for the advice:)

I think fall tends to be a reflective time.  Harvest.  The summing up of 
the past year and life.  Most of us probably haven't reaped as much as we 
would have liked and the "death" of winter is right around the corner:)

However, the celebratory season will soon be upon us with hopes in the new 
year and anticipation of rebirth in the spring.

Love,

Apollo

Subject: [sfraves] nrr: My encounter with Mealy-Mouthed Big Dick Cheney's Evil Twin today

Oh My Fucking God.....

I think I just had one of the Greatest Fucking Moments Of My Entire
Life, like, ever.

like, just fucking now.

Holy Fuck.

I had just gotten off werk and was leaving the Metro in Bethesda with
my bike and as I was heading towards the elevator I saw this fat,
bald, old guy in front of me that looked **exactly** like your
favorite arch-enemy and mines.....

Mealy-Mouthed Big Dick Cheney's Evil Twin.

Holy Shit, Batman!

I'm talking spitting image here, right down to the bright bald pate,
bad teeth, glasses, tacky pin-striped suit, bad teeth, lapel pin,
shoes, gut, the
dismissive Executive attitude, and the eyes, those horrible,
not-quite-able focus, sharklike, soul sucking eyes.

in other werds, the whole, complete, kit 'n' kaboodle, motherfucking package.

What a loser.

Just the kind of guy the resident, modern-day Eva Braun's of Modern
Day DC go for in a big way.

After all, guys like him pay **really** well.

I knew what I had to do and besides, I felt the Hand of God on my back
@ werk here, so I stepped up my pace just a tad, not that I had too,
this elevator is notoriously slow, but, hey, why take chances?

Now, bear in mind, this elevator, historically, for me, is one of the
great nexuses of evil on the planet, the shit I get into on there, you
would not believe, a while back I had a Rosa Park look-a-like
literally tell me to 'get on the back of the bus,' and I'm a
white-boy, but that's another story, for another time, babs has heard
them all.

Usually I'm on the receiving end of that energy and it feels pretty
shitty, but it totally felt like it was going to be my turn.

(Full disclosure: I *was* just a little tipsy, a buddy at werk passed
me one of those new funny labeled fruit drinks and after i got off
werk I drank it, and unbeknownst to me it was spiked with the rot-gut
vodka, good thing I waited too, because I never drink and drive, bear
with, there is a payoff to this).

I caught up to cocksucking Mealy-Mouth at the elevator waiting area
and since I was wearing my Kerry-Edwards button atop my www.alt.com
outsourcing parting gift T-Shirt, (i wore it today because it's got
Halloween orange and black colors, but more so in solidarity with the
prisoners of Abu Ghraib for the short shrift they've been getting in
the debates),  it was kinda hard to play off my affiliation, but I
wanted to make nice until we got into the elevator, so I made a point
of being cordial until I knew we were going to share that confined
space.

Asked him who he thought 'won' the debate and I played along, said
some things that i knew would be catnip to him, these guys just roll
over when one mentions Wall Street in a positive fashion, and build up
some levels of, you know, trust.

hubba hubba hubba.

Then as soon as the doors closed I lit into him like we all wish
Edwards woulda, coulda, shoulda last night.

(See: RudePundit link below, and I made damned sure I threw in a
little Joe Welch for good measure, I'm DONE playing with these
people.)

Nothing like a captive audience, let me tell you.

And that's one long fucking elevator ride.

Finally he pulled out his 'Big Guns,' (turns out, in my case at least,
the 'leaves you breathless' line is just another bullshit, urban
legend, piece of Madison Avenue PR), he smelled the vodka and made a
snarky comment about it, along the lines of

'I might take you seriously if you weren't so drunk.'

right.

I laughed right in his motherfucking face and said:

'Y'know what, you're right, I'm little tipsy right now, and that's all
well and good, and nothing I need to be ashamed of, but you're
PSYCHOTIC and, guess what, I can sober up.'

Then of course, the doors opened up and it was time to go our separate ways.

the sheer sense of satisfaction I'm feeling right now is pretty
fucking indescribable.

Right this very instant, I feel like I've been fucking a harem of 72
decided non-virgin super-models, non-stop, for a solid month, with a
getting mad lit in a Thanksgiving, Christmas Day, New Years, Best
Birthday Party in the History of Earth aspect thrown in.

What's not to like?

feel free to forward this out to all and sundry if you happen to like it.

If not, then, hey.....

kick it.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] nrr: My encounter with Mealy-Mouthed Big Dick Cheney's Evil Twin today

uh, this *wasn't* dick cheney.

why harass someone who looks like someone you don't agree with?

what would happen if i went around and kicked everyone's ass
who looked like the dude who raped my ex-ex-ex-ex-girlfriend?

yeah, you feel like a million bucks, but what the fuck.  if
someone pulled that shit on me, you can bet i wouldn't be as
gentle on him as this dude was to you.  props to him for
keeping it together, regardless of his political affiliations
or likeness to dick cheney.

and thinking someone is a "loser" based on the way they look is
pretty fucking lame.  you'll learn.  you'll meet the makers and
shakers of this little community and you'll be amazed at how
these "losers" made this community into what it is today.

if i'd seen you pull that little stunt, i'd have told you to
get on the back of the bus as well.  the short bus, no less.

learn to live with everyone, learn to love.  learn to accept
people.  we don't all have the same opinions, and that's okay.

Subject: [sfraves] a mixed review of the love and fuck parades

Ive got mixed feelings about the love parade, but I
was glad to see it happen, and hope it continues to
happen and grow over the years.  however, I think it
may only get better if San Francisco's musical taste
gets better.  I only got into the music for about 10
minutes total, and I was there for a while.  maybe I'm
just picky (yes), but...what can I say?  I did hear
some good techno on the DEFSF float, but it was one of
the smallest and worst sounding sound systems there. 
And I heard KJ play some decent acid as he went by on
the Thump system, and a bit of decent house from a
woman on I think the Sunset system.  I didn't have
high expectations, but I guess I expected to wander
among the systems at the end the parade, and get
turned on to some new electronic music.  Oh well.  

Another problem was the fact that all the systems were
jammed in so close together at the end.  Sound clash
hell.  I know there's always sound clash at events
like this, but it was overwhelming and ridiculous. 
Also, nowhere to sit down, hardly any curb areas.   

On the plus side, I did enjoy being out and about,
smiling at people, and all the dancing in the streets.
It was no Reclaim the Streets, but still, it was fun.
And I appreciated peoples creativity in dressing up
(particularly the clowns.)  Well, some people I wanted
to photograph for "Donts" for a Disco Dos and Donts
spread, but luckily I didnt have my camera.  There
was some of cheesiness, like I would look at some
floats and ask myself, "Are they from Vegas?" but
overall it was ok.  I wasnt too happy about the
corporate sponsorship, and the high price for getting
a float in, but I was willing to overlook it and have
some fun.   

But I began to get a bit melancholy while there.  
Partly it was the onset of autumn (along with the
frigid, frigid wind), and partly because I got
nostalgic for my time in Barcelona earlier this year,
when I went to a free, 3-day long techno party in the
city, outside SONAR, an international techno festival.
 SONAR was great, and the "alterni-SONAR" outdoors was
amazing as well.  It was overwhelmingly hard acid
techno, not my favorite genre, but with about 10
systems there, there was some diversity, and some
really good music.  And thousands of people dancing,
all free, unsanctioned, renegade-style.  Fucking
amazing.  I thought of it Saturday because it was in a
similar kind of outdoor space as the SF Love Parade,
an industrial district near the docks, with corporate
office parks, in the east of the city with the hills
rising to the west.  I remember standing at the
festival in Barcelona, looking west, and thinking of
how much this mini-"teknival" was like what my friends
do here at home, and appreciating them and their
efforts.  But there were thousands of people dancing
at this renegade thing in Barcelona, and here, well,
renegade things, if they happen at all, are a lot
smaller, and it seems like not as many people dance. 
And I can't imagine anything like the above happening
in the u.s., without severe police repression.  I
know, I shouldnt compare  the Catalan (Catalunyan?)
people seem to love their techno, whereas in the U.S.,
I just dont think that many people understand dancing
yet.   

Anyway, on to the fuck parade.  No police repression
that I witnessed (though maybe they were diverted from
an original location, I dont know), but hardly any
people either.  The fuck parade was the renegade,
non-commercial, "hardcore" alternative to the love
parade, and I was looking forward to it.  Not my
favorite genres of music (I expected mainly hardcore
and drum and bass, based on the flyers), but I
appreciate the spirit.  Unfortunately, it was rather
difficult to find the location, and by the time I got
there the wind was blasting and I was ready to get
inside.  And it was tiny.  When I was there, there
were maybe 30 people and four sound systems.  Granted,
I did go a little late.  

So, I do hope the Love Parade continues, and brings
more events and afterparties to SF that week.  (I was
glad to see Stewart Walker in town on Friday night,
though I left when I saw the "No Patron Dancing" signs
at Rx Gallery.  WTF?  Guess it's the usual bullshit,
cabaret permit, whatever...Should have stayed,
though.)  And cheesy as it was, I feel kind of proud
that the first Love Parade in the U.S. was in San
Francisco.   I also hope the Fuck Parade continues as
well, though hopefully with a few more people.

At future love parades, just like at Burning Man, I would love to see
fewer, but higher-quality sound systems.  

Love Parade could do this by increasing the float entry price.  It would
force more groups to work together and colaborate.

Love Parade could also allow smaller, non-sound floats to participate for 
free.

F*ck Big Media: Rolling Your Own Network

Mark Pesce Lecturer, Interactive Media, AFTRS
markp@aftrs.edu.au www.playfulworld.com


Preamble

The worldwide consolidation of media industries has led
to a consequent closure of the public airwaves with
respect to matters of public interest. As control of
this public resource becomes more centralized, the
messages transmitted by global media purveyors become
progressively less relevant, less diverse, and less
reflective of ground truth.

At present, individuals and organizations work to break
the stranglehold of these anti-market-media-mega-
corporations through the application of the courts and
the law. However, because of the inherent monopoly that
anti-market media maintain on the public mindset,
legislators have been understandably reluctant to make
moves toward media diversification. We are thus
confronted with a situation where many people have
interesting things to say, but there are progressively
fewer outlets where these views can be shared.

The public airwaves, because they are a limited
resource, are managed by public bodies for the public
interest. While honorable, the net effect of this
philosophy of resource management has been negative: a
public resource has become the equivalent of a
beachfront property, its sale generating enormous
license revenues, but its transfer to the private
domain denying the community access to the sea of
ideas.

If a well-informed public is the necessary prerequisite
to the democratic process, then we must frankly admit
that any private ownership of public airwaves
represents a potential threat to the free exchange of
ideas. Now that private property has mostly
collectivized the electromagnetic spectrum, and with
little hope that this will soon change, we must look
elsewhere to find a common ground for the public
discourse.

We are fortunate that such ground already exists.

"The government, which was designed for the people, has got into the hands 
of the bosses and their employers, the special interests.  An invisible 
empire has been set up above the forms of democracy."
-Woodrow Wilson

"There are times when you have to obey a call which is the highest of all, 
i.e. the voice of conscience even though such obedience may cost many a 
bitter tear, and even more, separation from friends, from family, from the 
state to which you may belong, from all that you have held as dear as life 
itself. For this obedience is the law of our being."
   Gandhi

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

ON THE ANALYST'S COUCH WITH ECSTASY

Ben Fulton, David Adams, Salt Lake City Weekly
A handful of intrepid shrinks are hoping to bring the club
drug MDMA back to its psychotherapeutic roots by using it
in therapy sessions (and yes, it's still illegal).

-Woodrow Wilson

"There are times when you have to obey a call which is the highest of all, 
i.e. the voice of conscience even though such obedience may cost many a

itself. For this obedience is the law of our being."

Subject: Re: [sfraves] SRR:  F*ck Big Media: Rolling Your Own Network

Someone still has to pay for all of it though. Anyway,
wish I'd read this essay back when we were building
Live365.com  As Abbie Hoffman said, "The first duty of
every revolutionary is to get away with it."  Too bad
I failed to get away with it there, but hopefully
there will be more chances in the future.

You know I may not always agree with everything Mark
says, but he always brings a smile to my face.  I'll
never forget the evening when Mark whipped out the 15"
dildo in front of 200 people at the Exploratorium back
in the early nineties.  (Oh shh it was a panel
discussion about sex and virtual reality ha ha)

Hey Mark Pesce we love you.

Peace,

Peter Rothman

Subject: Re: [sfraves] nrr: My encounter with Mealy-Mouthed Big Dick Cheney's Evil Twin today

oh, you'd never take me for a crack-head weirdo if you passed me on
the street, I'm pretty clean cut, even on days when I wear my black
dot.com.bomb T-Shirts.

Don't get me wrong though, I'm extremely grateful for those days. 

For had I not stumbled down that path, after years of complete
abstinence, (try it sometime, it does have some pretty cool rewards),
while I served in our US Marines, as a volunteer, and did a few year's
stint on Wall Street and SF's Financial District across the street
from the Transamerica Pyramid as a stockbroker, I would still be one
of 'them' to this day and you probably wouldn't like me very much.

Then again, we wouldn't be having this conversation, I'd probably be
chilling in my crib up on Skyline Drive right now.

I'm glad I chose this path of music, dancing, drugging and otherwise
having a good time, instead.

Aren't you?

Hella more fun, ain't it?

both your points are well taken.

My Mom's, who grew up in a commie, totalitarian, country and my
left-of-Karl Marx raver girl are of the same mind, so you're in good
company.

however, this really felt like 'if not now, then when? and 'if not me,
then who?' situation.

there's a famous quote about people not speaking up 75 years ago and
what the results were of that.

is that a lesson of history that we can afford to blithefully ignore
because we want to be all loving and understanding and tolerant?

Please bear in mind just who we're dealing with here.

There is a war on, and has been going in this country for many, many
years and it's been declared on YOU and I, and if you want, or need to
keep rolling over and taking it, suit yourself.

For starters, they're just champing at the bit to lock people like you
and I up in a Federal Gulag for a minimum of ten years, and they're
hard at werk writing even more hostile laws against us which carry
much stiffer penalties.

you *do* remember the RAVE Act that they passed a year ago April?

That hasn't gone away, y'know.

They're pretty hell-bent on putting lights out on our little parties,
and excuse me for taking that at face value and matching them
tit-for-tat instead of sticking my head in the sand and playing the
game of it'll go away if I just stick my head in the sand and pretend
this bad shit isn't happening and that these people that are doing it
aren't bad people.

It's a choice, and they're choosing to do what they do each and every
day, and so I'm just responding to that.

It's not like that or the Patriot Act are simply going to vanish.

They're the LAW of the Land now.

Watch for enforcement of those pieces of legisaltion to begin in
earnest after the election.

I'll put money on it that by this time next year you will personally
know of at least one person facing persecution under that law, if you
don't already.

Even to begin the process of challenging the Rave Act, someone is
going to have to get arrested first, and then argue it all the way up
to the Supreme Court, which is a very costly endeavor, no matter how
you slice it.

Once a government starts writing and passing laws like that, it's only
a matter of time before they start lining folks up against the wall
and shooting them.

That's the reality of it, OK?

on the flip-side, being polite and civil has kind of gotten us into
this situation to begin with and we really took our eyes off the ball
and let our guard down when Nixon left office and we're now reaping
the benefits of falling asleep at the switch today.

This didn't happen in a vacuum, or overnight, and people like myself
who stood by and didn't do a damn thing, though we knew better, are as
equally complicit in this as they are.

A thousand pardons for doing my best for making up for lost time, in a
better late than never way.

Now, just because I said 'What a loser' in that post doesn't mean I
said it to him directly

I just chucked that in there because I was listening to the beastie
boys's new CD, 'To The 5 Boroughs, and I got that line from there,
it's an interstitial throw away that seemed to fit what i was writing.

if it's good enough for the Beasties, then by god, it's good enough for me.

:P

But yes, that's totally my opinion of an individual like that, and
given the laws they've passed against me and mines they take a much
dimmer view of the likes of me, so this is just a matter of showing
the same kind of respect to them that they do me.

Now I didn't jump his shit on sight. 

I made damn sure who I was dealing with first by asking him a few
questions, had he answered differently it may have gone another
direction.

The first thing I asked him was the same thing I asked at least 50-75
other people that day, who 'won' the debate?

Since I saw it as a draw, as did most people I spoke with earlier, it
was pretty revealing how strongly he came down in Cheney's camp, which
tells me that it wouldn't have mattered one iota what to him when the
flat out bald face lies Cheney told during the course of the evening.

I moved on from their, and i admit I deliberately played dumb with the
next series of questions which went along the lines of....

'See, sir, here's what I don't understand and maybe you can help me with this? 

I follow the markets and one thing I know is that the Dow Jones opened
this morning, 3 years later, at almost the same exact spot it did on
September TENTH, 2001.

What's up with that?

The man's had a SOLID three years to get it right, and at this
juncture his policies are not only werking, but they're costing you
and everybody else the usual 10% per year gains the market usually
sees.

How can rationalize the blind support you've been giving him, given
the miserable job he's done so far?

Just because he says 'we've turned the corner' 23 times over the
course of a weekend in his speeches, doesn't necessarily make it so,
now does it, sir?'

'And why aren't the Principals behind Enron and MCI, to name two just
companies, being prosecuted as vociferously as an inner city crack
dealer?

They've certainly wreaked just as much damage to Americans that placed
their trust in them?

Which is worse, sir?'

of course he had nothing to say to that, nor the spiral that millions
of people have had into poverty in this country during the same
period, I mentioned that too before the elevator showed up.

When we got into the thing after the usual interminable wait, I
shifted into a little discussion of foreign policy, centering around
the lies around the non-existent WMD's, the 10,000+ dead Iraqi
civilians, 1,000 dead and climbing US troops, (it took until 1967 that
we saw that many dead in Vietnam, just for point of comparison, so the
pace here is radically higherand the fact that if the Arab world was
ambivalent about the US before Abu Ghraib, they REALLY hate us now.

Bring out the Gimp. 

(On a side note, good thing we caught it then, because it's a given,
left unchecked, it would be sooner before later that we started making
lamp-shades and soap out of people).

What's making Abu Ghraib infinitely worse is the complete lack of any
sort of contrition our leadership is showing.

Try and blow it off all you want, but this will haunt the US for many,
many years to come.

That's pretty much the gist of what I got off to Mr. Mealy-Mouth Bush
Cheney supporter, and if you feel that that was out of line, good for
you.

And as far as sprinkling a few 'fucks' in there as i spoke, well, I
was only showing the same amount of respect that Mr. Cheney showed in
what I consider the Hallowed, Holy, Halls of our US Congress, when he

'said what needed to be said, and I'm glad I did it' 

when a member of the Senate confronted him earlier this year.

I'm not the one setting the example here, now am I?

The difference between a man like him and a person like me is that
I'll go so far to use harsh language when I see something I don't
like.

These people use force, guns and jails to get their point across.

If you can't tell the two apart, I can't help you.

I've been living in our Nation's Capitol for 2 years now, a place that
has been in the running for 'Murder Capitol USA' for the last ten
years now, some years coming in first.

About 2 weeks ago, in this sort of environment, Congress voted to
repeal a long-standing hand guns ban here in DC, which if it passes
the Senate, and Bush signs it into law, will not only make it legal to
own a Saturday Night Special again, but you won't even have to
register it with the cops.

Guess which one of our two parties led the charge to push that bill
through the House?

Just in point of contrast, I ride a bicycle here and it's the law that
if I own and operate it I not only have to register it with the cops,
but I have to have a receipt on me as well.

Failure to comply means I risk having my property siezed.

I need to register my bike, but not my gun?

Doesn't that strike you as a little nuts?

20 years ago, a punk band called The Clash wrote a song where they
described an urban environment where poor people stood on steam grates
in the winter because they had no other means to stay warm.

My first February here in the year 2003 went down in DC history as the
coldest one ever sionce they started keeping records in the 1860's

Now, not only did I see this tableau of human misery, up close and
personal, my girl is an attorney and the Courthouse she works at is at
3rd and Constitution, and I saw this every single day I went by there.

What made it really special, is at that this particular locus the most
dominant feature in the landscape is the Capitol Building.

Quite the view, can't miss it, it's right in line of sight of those
people freezing to death on the sidewalk.

See, I'm not just mad about all this, I'm livid, and I've got to
wonder what's going on with people that don't feel this way?

It's not like it's hidden or anything.

Then again, you probably don't have any childhood friends like I do
that have had their left leg blown off beneath the knee by an RPG in
Fallujah like I do.

He's finally getting out of rehab this week to go home to his wife and kid.

Multiply that by 10,000 young people, many of whom he's luckier than,
since they're much more maimed for life than he is.

What really got me started on all this was the Reagan Funeral this past June.

Day after day of this pushing bad news off the TV in celebration of
his 'Legacy.'

Quite the spectacle wasn't it?

I'll tell you what his 'Legacy' is, I pass it on every damned corner
of this city.

See, I remember an America that WAS a Shining City On The Hill, the
one that these people went out of their way to destroy.

When I was coming up there were no 'homeless' littering our streets
like they do today.

It was Reagan who tossed them out into the streets to fend for
themselves, and when this first happened 20 years ago, there were 10
times of them around as you'll see today.

Question, where'd the 90% of them disappear to?

Did we re-open the hospitals?

No we didn't.

Did they return to their families?

No, in most cases, they didn't.

They're dead because we're too MEAN and CHEAP to do the right thing.

What these people's 'Legacy' is that no one talks about is that that
simple act killed in cold blood just about as many of our own people
as Hitler killed Jews.

Just because we didn't use a gas oven to accomplish this doesn't make
us one bit better.

At least they could defend themselves, to a point, the Americans we
killed on the streets were the weakest, frailest, most vulnerable
human beings in our society.

I am so ashamed.

Heads up, we ran out of those people, and now we're going after our
elderly, infirm, ailing, black and brown people and they've already
made it quite clear that they don't like us free-spirit, gypsy, hippy,
raver types either.

In Soviet Era Russia, 30 **million** people starved to death in the
Ukraine, the greatest source of food on the planet.

That's just what happens when you have a bankrupt, corrupt system in place.

<shrug>

Here in the United States, we have the greatest health care system the
world has ever seen, yet we are rapidly approaching the point where
one out of three people can't get access because they lack the
ability-to-pay.

What do you think is going to happen to **millions**  them?

That's just what happens when you have a bankrupt, corrupt system in place.

<shrug>

These people have the gall to speak of corruption of others?

I love my country with a deep and abiding passion and i'm now at the
point where I see whoever wins this election being irrelevant.

No matter who wins, we're either going to do one of two things after
this election.

Either we're going to collectively come to our senses and start
working in earnest on these issues that are staring us in the face, or
we're going to take this as far as we can and many, many many people
will be hurt, for nothing.

At the end of it, the United States that we live in today will cease
to exist in its present form.

You may think what I did was speaking out of turn, so be it, pardon me
if I feel that to not speak is completely abdicating and shirking my
responsibilities and my Patriotic Duty as a Citizen of this once great
and proud Republic.

I used to be such a nice guy, too.

Those that know me personally once knew me to be the plurriest person
on the planet, and if you catch me on a good day, some of that does
shine through, still, and honestly i'd rather nurture that than feed
this, but again, this IS a war we're in and I just know that sitting
on the sidelines and letting things happen and going out to the party,
party, party is not only lazy and weak, but will have grave
consequences, not just for me, but all those I love and care about.

There's an added degree of difficulty because I'm not one to raise
anything more than my voice in anger, and that's decidely not these
people's approach, they freak over a black women's nearly exposed
nipple during a nothing football game, but boy, oh boy don't they
positively drool over an aerial view of a Daisy-Cutter Bomb dropped
from a great height?

That's a little backwards, and so I will continue to speak to them
like they are backwards children, since they exhibit the same
behavior.

Once they start acting like the adults that they physically are, sure,
sure I'll tone down my rhetoric.

Gladly.

Nothing will make me prouder and my language will reflect that instead
of the shame that I am feeling about all this.

There's more, as you can tell, but that would be gratuitous, I think
you see where I'm coming from, so I'll leave you with this....

My Father's last job before he retired was at the World Trade Center
and fortunately he died on the Father's Day 3 months before 9.11, he'd
been predicting a catatrophic event like this for years prior, and I'm
glad he wasn't around to see his worst thoughts confirmed.

Undoubtedly, he knew someone that perished there that day.

Want to prevent another event like that ever happening again?

Good.

So do I.

Everybody wants that.

How about, instead of using the approach we've got going on now, we
double what we pay the Vietnamese Nike sneaker assemblers?

Think that might cost a whole lot less than the $200 billion dollars
we just spent that's not going into our schools, roads, healthcare and
crumbling domestic infrastructure?

Who knows, it might even restore some goodwill that we used to have in
this world.

btw, where's Osama?

Love,

nwa

Subject: Re: [sfraves] nrr - i voted

I just registered for the first time in my voting career as a Democrat
and still haven't got my registration card back in the mail, got so
caught up in that last post here I spaced calling The Board before
they closed for the evening.

Damn, I don't like cutting things this close.

Oh, a brief synopsis of my voting history of all years since 1972,
this included who I would have voted for prior to coming of legal age
as well

1972:      it would have been:     Nixon        (R)

1976:      "                          "    Ford         (R)

1980       volunteered on the      Anderson  (3rd Party effort)

1984       my first ever vote:       Reagan      (R)

1988       wrote in:                    Nixon         (R) (was
appalled by the Willie Horton ad no way
                                                                     
was I going to vote for Bush cuz of that)
1992       volunteer/voted 4:       Perot

1996       sat this one out, didn't 'get' Clinton until 1998 and Dole
is too mean-spirited a
              "human" being for me to be comfortable with him as my Prez.

2000        also sat this one out because (a) I was in California
dinn't think it mattered and (b)            the gravity of what was at
stake eluded me, but I was already on my way towards converting.

Woulda tossed a coin in the booth 'tween Nader or Gore.

You should see our yard, we sit on a corner where a HS Football field
faces our backyard and right now there's about half a dozen KE signs
that I put up this afternoon, as well as a liberal sprinkling of local
Dem Congresman and US Senator signs.

We're getting a dozen more tomorrow because the HS is having their
annual Homecoming Parade and they're going to be marching right past
so we wanted to make it as visually stunning as possible.

It's really cool, maybe I've got a future in party decor planning after all. :-)

Kick-off is at 6:30pm, so this is an Anti-Karl Rove Counter-Measure
since Rove picked this date and hour because they knew half the
country was going to be at a game like this and the other half was
going to be lit like a Xmas Tree.

ratbastids.

It's a highly trafficked street otherwise so their use will go on
right until Election Day.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] nrr: My encounter with Mealy-Mouthed Big Dick Cheney's Evil Twin today

i never faulted you for your opinion, moreso the way you chose
to go about voicing it (on a dick cheney lookalike, in an
elevator).  it seems that you picked on this guy solely based
on his looks, initially.

regardless of his views, i can't help but think you walked away
the lesser man.  if your conversation went anything like the
way your email (below) did, i'm sure the guy left the
conversation thinking you were an opinionated crackhead drunk.

is this the image we want to set forth?  did you change
anything with your actions?  speaking up and picking a fight
are two different things.

i don't get the rest of your email - sounds like you are in
dire need of a blog.  try livejournal.

i'm from seattle, so it's not like i'm an expert on this ;) but i didn't
get the impression that it was about sf's music taste. i thought it was
more about who could afford to operate a float.

it seemed to me like most of the floats were using it as an opportunity to
advertise their upcoming club/party.

electronic music.  Oh well.


well, in all fairness, i'm not certain that love parade in any country is 
particularly experimental in terms of the music that gets played. most of
the people that played in berlin seemed to be on the 'mainstream' side of
the electronic spectrum, regardless of genre.

i'm fine with that. i just wanted to run around in the street and party.
if i want innovative sounds i attend that sort of event or dj 'em meself
;)

very true. i didn't get the impression that they were expecting that size
turnout. i wonder how many of the attendees were tourists like myself who
had flown in for the event.

strongly agree with you. i was at barcelona last year and adored the
renegade events nearby. (and sonar and barcelona in general, but that's
another topic.)

i'm from seattle, so it's not like i'm an expert on this ;) but i didn't
get the impression that it was about sf's music taste. i thought it was
more about who could afford to operate a float.

it seemed to me like most of the floats were using it as an opportunity to
advertise their upcoming club/party.

well, in all fairness, i'm not certain that love parade in any country is 
particularly experimental in terms of the music that gets played. most of
the people that played in berlin seemed to be on the 'mainstream' side of
the electronic spectrum, regardless of genre.

i'm fine with that. i just wanted to run around in the street and party.
if i want innovative sounds i attend that sort of event or dj 'em meself
;)

very true. i didn't get the impression that they were expecting that size
turnout. i wonder how many of the attendees were tourists like myself who
had flown in for the event.

strongly agree with you. i was at barcelona last year and adored the
renegade events nearby. (and sonar and barcelona in general, but that's
another topic.)

I was just in Chicago last month.

Gramaphone seems to be the game in town. It's by Lincoln Park on Clark
St, south of Diversey I think. Across the street from BestBuy on Clark
St.

Mostly house (it's Chicago after all), and some good techno (probably
for its proximity to Detroit). Very little trance and d&b, breaks is
non-existence.

Since the Internet emerged, the real barrier to a grassroot media
outlet is no longer the limited airwaves, but the unreasonably
restrictive copyright laws (and the media industries' army of
ligitation-happy lawyers).

Unless you can come up with all-original footage, you'll bound to run
into the big guys when u try to get permissions to air some of their
clips. U know how that'll turn out.

Fight fair use.

Oh BTW, I know u weren't asking about clubs, but check out SmartBar

If u're staying Monday night, check out Boom Boom Room @ Green Dolphin

Take to the streets and shoot your own video.  Then
you own the rights.  Unless your shots include images
of trademarked products, company logos, or images of
somewhat famous people, etc.

One of my great disappointments with Internet radio is
that no street level grassroots reporting ever
emerged.  (It would be relatively simple to do "live
in the street" reporting from any WiFi hot spot)  In
fact to this day there is very little trully original
content on Internet radio.

Contrast this with the wealth of original content out
there in blogs.  The breadth of original content in
the blogosphere is completely staggering.  Sure some
of it is crap, but this amazing wealth of triviality
is one of the reasons that blogs are a social
phenomena while Internet radio still really isn't.

Regards,

Peter

in the spirit of keeping it real, we pretty much have
refrained from participating in discussions since this

sort of consistancy, but being that it is my turn
today, and being that you said something so
interesting, i felt moved to reply. hopefully , no one

my point is, we could all hope that the schizophrenia
is either  assisted by the crack, or better yet,
caused by the crack, then there'd be an easy remedy. 
not to rag on your dancing.  I was just interested in
the mental disease. :)

Funny you should mention that.

See just about 45 minutes prior to my demonstrating that lapse of
judgement on my part with that Republican in that elevator, I was in
the alley directly behind the DC offices of Project For A New American
Century, (an actual client of the people I contract with and I've set
foot in their offices on bizness more than once) finishing off my
morning's paperwork.

I go there to unwind a bit because my werk is a bit demanding and I
need a break.

Anyhow, there was this other person in there just chilling, as many
street people do, and I we wouldn't have spoken had he not asked me
for a cigarette.

He was listening to the radio and as I passed him the smoke I asked
him what he was listening to.

turns out it was Rush Limbaugh's show.

Dude looked like he was in his 50's and had spent a few months living
in his clothes, which were quite dirty, ripped, and he coulda used a
shave and I bet if I got close enough, a shower.

In other words your typical, unconnected, DC crackhead weirdo, and I'm
pretty clear on just how far he'da got if he showed up at one of our
UG's one night and tried to get in.

Intrigued, I asked him why on earth he would spend a second listening
to that junkie.

Turns out he was a regualar listener, not because he aspired to
'better his situation in life,' but because he wanted to know exactly
what people like him were up against.

We spoke for a bit after that and it turns out that he, like many
others in the service sector here that I've been speaking with, was
just as up to speed on the news of the day as any one on these lists.

For example, he knew more about the Wal-Mart/Gillette RFID tag story than I did.

Who knew?

If Tyler Durden were to suddenly spring to life today, he'd have no
shortage of people to help him out, it turns out.

:P

That was my point. But it's easier said than done . Costs alone is a
problem, not to mention how easily your can wander into copyrighted

Fun+games #1: Whip our your camera phone and take a picture of your

Internet radio never takes of because it cannot be consumed like
over-the-air radio: you can't listen to it in the car (drivers are the
majority of OTA radio listeners). Podcasting sounds like a good
concept though. The availabilty of DNC/RNC speeches and presidential
debates on iTMS is also a sign of other things to come.

Blogspace is ture democracy at work. However trivial each blog is,
collectively they become a powerful voice.

The truth is, grassroot media do not operate as well in the
traditional mass media's asymetrical, one-way-only,
stuff-your-head-with-marketing-and-propaganda broadcast model. It
operates better in a 2-way format, where we don't simply "consume"
ideas, we exchange them. Isn't it why you subcribe to this mailing
list in the first place?

Don't let the media giants box you in. Just that they do it one way
doesn't mean it's effective for us to do it the same way.

The Internet is our war against the mega-corp propaganda. The
revolution has already begun.

And, yeah, fight for fair use and stuff.

Love,

- Jeff

true.  my friend who was with me had been to the
berlin parade, and said it was pretty similar in terms
of so-so mainstream music and soundclash and all
that...

actually, i've been to the detroit for demf/movement
for the past 4 years, and will continue.  i may not
have been very clear - i can see something official
like sonar going on, but not an alterni-sonar, as big
as it was in barcelona, right in the middle of the
city going off as it did.

it's possible, depending on what city, where, etc.  i
don't think it would last 3 days, though.

i guess i'm thinking of stuff near cities, and you
know, i'm thinking more of mutantfest (usually in the
nw, this year in ca), one of the most autonomous
spaces i've been to, but where most people generally
just don't dance, at least the years i've gone. 
arrgh!  but maybe that's just the crowd that goes. a
bit frustrating - incredible music and no one on the
dance floor.  but you all probably have more renegade
type stuff going on the in nw, it seems...

i know, i just had the fear of me and my partner being
the only ones dancing, which we'll do, but we just
weren't in the mood. plus the rx is such a sucky place
for dancing.  anyway, we thought we'd check out john
selway at tokyo electro, but we got outside there and
it sounded awful!  


take care, and thanks for the feedback,

Sorry for the public post everyone. While I'm big in the know of who's who
in the trance / tech circuit, I'll admit I'm sort of a dunce when it comes
to the house scene and well. 
I'm just sort of at a loss when it comes to the more esteemed house
weeklies.
 
Here's why I'm writing (and if you happen to be a promoter of a weekly house
event, then this is specifically aimed at you!
 
The fabulous act Tortured Soul is looking to come to SF and perform
somewhere between Monday, Nov. 2nd - Thursday, Nov. 4th..  
 
If anyone is interested, please contact me via email at this address and
I'll gladly forward you more info.
 
Thanks for your minute.

I read widely, and one of the publications I study each month is the 
"Proceedings of the U. S. Naval Institute:  Independent Forum on 
Defense."  I'm also a long-time member of the Institute.

This month's "Proceedings" covered Iraq in perspective.  Included were 
thoughtful articles about the need for more understanding of 
cultures:  "...it is more important to understand motivation, intend, 
method, and culture than to have a few more meters of precision, knots of 
speed, or bits of bandwidth..." in the war on terror;  the military's 
responsibility in losing the media war in Iraq;  and an editorial on pork 
in military appropriations.

I trust many of you know that the military is not comprised of automatons 
who obey orders without question.  Yes,  they may execute the orders of the 
Commander in Chief for that is their sworn duty;  but that doesn't mean 
that these people, often with excellent educations and training, are 
without ideas and values that may be contrary to current national political 
agendas.

I thought I'd pass on this excellent history-based critique of the United 
States' desire to impose democracy (a code word for corporate capitalism) 
on Iraq and other third-world nations.  Please forgive any errors:  scanned 
and OCRed the piece.

Love,

Let Them Eat Democracy


By Stephen Pressfield
Commentary
Proceedings of the U.S. Naval Institute, October, 2004


"We are here to help the Vietnamese. Because inside every gook is an 
American trying to get out."

The quote above-from Stanley Kubrick's film, Full Metal Jacket-was of 
course played for satire. Unfortunately, if you revise the nationality, it 
is a pretty accurate summation of current U.S. policy in Iraq. If we give 
our Iraqi friends a taste of American-style democracy and freedom, they 
will take to it like Moscow did to McDonald's.

Will they? Is individual liberty compatible with Islam? Can democracy work 
in a society that is essentially tribal? Inside every Iraqi, is there an 
American struggling to get out? A precedent from the past may be 
illuminating. Let's flash back to Athens during the golden age of Pericles.

Athens in the 5th century B.C. was a democracy and an empire, much like the 
United States. Athens was an enlightened empire. Its power produced peace. 
Trade flourished. Its subject states (nearly 200, from Sicily to the Black 
Sea) got rich. The Athenian drachma was as universal as the Yankee dollar; 
its law courts facilitated prosperity by adjudicating trade disputes. Like 
the United States, Athens was the reigning superpower.

Athens did not have Disneyland or Hollywood movies, but it had the 
Parthenon and the plays of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides. It was so 
dominant militarily, culturally, and commercially that it simply held the 
world in thrall. The energy of its people seemed irresistible and very, 
well, American.

An Athenian is always an innovator, quick to form a resolution and quick at 
carrying it out.... they are always abroad; for they think that the farther 
they go, the more they will get.... they prefer hardship and activity to 
peace and quiet. In a word, they are by nature incapable of either living a 
quiet life or of allowing anyone else to do so.'(1)

Athens had a tactic for keeping its subject states in line. It compelled 
them to become democracies. For their own good. And for a while it worked. 
But a funny thing happened on the way to hegemony by imposed democracy.

The shadow side of Athens's benevolence began to show. The subject states' 
people saw that their democracies could vote for any measure except 
autonomy. They could pass any bill except self-determination. Athens's law 
courts fleeced them. The states began to hate the Athenian drachma. They 
hated the sight of Athenian warships in their harbors and Athenian marines 
in their towns. They sought a champion and found it in Sparta; the 
Peloponnesian War began. The ol' democracy trick had back fired on Athens. 
Its tributaries perceived this "democracy" as a device for their 
subjugation. It was hollow, puppet democracy. So intense had the states' 
hatred for Athens grown, they now willingly sided with the sternest of 
oligarchies, Sparta, and an alien empire, Persia-all in the cause of 
shedding Athens's yoke.

Does any of this sound familiar? Are those who forget the past condemned to 
repeat it? The Iraqis are not stupid. They can read Ambassador J. Paul 
Bremer's "100 Orders," which, in effect, tie up their economy for years and 
hand it on a plate to U.S. corporations. They see through our altruistic 
aspirations for them, as the ancient states saw through those of Athens.

If we think we can impose democracies abroad and people will like us for it 
(when democracy is a code word for corporate capitalism, which is itself a 
code word for American domination), we are deluding ourselves and scorning 
the lessons of history. If the past teaches anything, it is that a 
people-any people-will gladly take bad rule they can call their own over 
the most enlightened governance by an alien occupier.

In the end, Athens lost. The very democracies it had established to secure 
its dominance ganged up and brought it down. In 403 B.C., Lysander's 
Spartan fleet entered the port of Piraeus and "to the music of flute girls, 
tore down the city's Long Walls." The day was hailed, said Xenophon "as 
beginning of freedom for Greece.'(2)

"The government, which was designed for the people, has got into the hands 
of the bosses and their employers, the special interests.  An invisible 
empire has been set up above the forms of democracy."
-Woodrow Wilson

"There are times when you have to obey a call which is the highest of all, 
i.e. the voice of conscience even though such obedience may cost many a 
bitter tear, and even more, separation from friends, from family, from the 
state to which you may belong, from all that you have held as dear as life 
itself. For this obedience is the law of our being."
   Gandhi

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Gays to Withdraw Cash From Banks-Could Total Billions

a similar thing happened years ago in my home state of
Maine, when locals in a little seaside cove decided
they didn't want them queers coming to buy antiques
and titter over their fancy tea like it was the new
Fire Island.

The following tourist season, them gay interlopers
stamped "Queer money" on every bill they spent in 
town, and needless to say, us locals got the picture. 
 Them fuckers was rich!

Season after that, seems old Mayor Jenkins took to the
buggery himself.  Town meetings ain't been the same
since.    This is mostly a true story, leastways how I
recall.

Hahahaha, I only wish..  Emailing hip-hop beats is HELLZA gonna happen.
 Snuggling is on the lowlow side @ current and I've been in the studio
for like 23923624 hours per week since the parade!

Hehe.

Life is weird when your creative pursuits have deadlines!  In any case,
you should just come on over and we can make the beats to your
specifications, and go WH00pwhoo00pzipiddeedoodaaah.

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) Michael Badnarik arrested trying to serve legal papers at debate

	The presidential debates -- democracy, or lack thereof, in =
action...

On Rational Review...
"NEWS FLASH: Badnarik arrested trying to crash debate"
http://www.rationalreview.com/announcements/10092004.html
-----------

Libertarian Presidential candidate Michael Badnarik
and Green Party Presidential candidate David Cobb were
arrested Friday evening when they crossed police lines
in an attempt to gain entry to the presidential debate
they had been excluded from at Washington University
in St. Louis, MO.

Reached by mobile phone at approximately 11:30PM
Central time Friday, Badnarik campaign Communications
Director Stephen Gordon reported being in a hectic
rush to gather, verify and distribute information on
the situation.

=93Michael Badnarik is currently imprisoned at an
undisclosed location in the St. Louis area. I've
gotten a report from our man John Airheart out in the
field saying that law enforcement officials are unable
to provide info on his exact whereabouts, but he is
believed to probably be in a St. Louis municipal
lockup. We intend to get him out as soon as we can
find out more, as he has campaign appearances
scheduled in St. Louis, Champagne-Urbana and Kansas
City on Saturday.=94

Gordon went on to stress that Badnarik was doing far
more than merely protesting his exclusion from the
debates when arrested. He was attempting to serve
process papers on Commission on Presidential Debates
officials.

=93Michael had process papers in his pocket related to
our suit in Arizona against the CPD. Two previous
attempts this afternoon to serve papers to the CPD at
their facility in Washington, DC were thwarted by
guards they recently set up. We expect to be releasing
more information on that as it becomes available=94

The Badnarik campaign said they also made attempts to
serve process via email and facsimile to the
Commission on Presidential Debates and others involved
in the suit, which may soon take a turn for the
dramatic.

=93We will be in court Tuesday morning to stop the third
debate. Public money is being used illegally to
promote only certain candidates=94 said Gordon, who also
mentioned that photos and audio of process papers
being served to Arizona State University officials for
their role in the upcoming third debate will be made
available by the Badnarik campaign shortly.

Asked about the mainstream media blackout of Badnarik
and Cobb's arrest, Gordon was undaunted. =93Americans
know now they can not trust the mainstream media to
cover real events in real time. The Internet is taking
over because it has to. Americans have no place to go
for the truth anymore but the Internet.=94=

Yes, I agree.  Ever since the debates were taken out of the hands of the 
League of Women Voters these staged media events have become a tool of the 
Democratic and Republican parties.  There is no democracy in action 
here.  We are, really, moving swiftly to a one party system -- and you know 
what that means.  There is no room for dissent;  no place for a dialectic.

Love,

Apollo

Subject: [sfraves] 10 DJ mixes on my iPod

......aka: "what's been rocking in my pants"

Sorry, I just have this strange impulse to tell everyone what I've
been listening to lately. I tried to tell ppl on the bus but nobody
cared. Maybe some of u would actually give a fuck.

Here I picked 10 of the recent DJ mixes I listen to the most in the
past 3 months:


1. GU024 Reykjavik - Mixed by Nick Warren

- Say what you will about Global Underground. The first disc here is
phenominal. It's all downtempo/ambient cuts and builds up to some
atmospheric breaks at the end, very atypical of the series, and a real
masterpiece. Reminds me of Nick's Back To Mine release, only better.
Check it out even if u HATE Global Underground.


2. GU025 Toronto - Mixed by Deep Dish

- You already know what it is. Deep, sexy progressive house, choice
cuts with that usual Deep Dish trademark pop sensibilty and smooth as
silk construction.


3. Bedrock Breaks - Mixed by Meat Katie
4. Wired - Mixed by DJ Hyper
5. Frabriclive 08 - Mixed by Plump DJs

- Funky-ass nu-skool breaks. Makes me bounce around like an
Energenzier Bunny all night long.


6. DJ World Series: Breaks from Australia - Mixed by Phil K
7. Fabriclive 16 - Mixed by Adam Freeland

- Mostly amtospheric breaks. Nice chill-out stuff for breaksheads.
Can't listen to K&D Sessions all the time u know.


8. Subliminal Sessions 5 - Mixed by Erick Morillo

- I don't even like house music all that much, but this rocks. Disc 1
is more funky and soulful (it even opens with the disco classic
"Relight My FIre"), groovy and playful. Disc 2 is the darker
progressive stuff. But overall it retains a New York house sound. FUCK
Mark Farina, FUCK Miguel Migs, FUCK Ben Watt. ***This is house
music****.  Flame on.  :)


9. Balance 005 - Mixed by James Holden

- Trance is dead, right? This is the only trance DJ mix I actually
liked in the last... um... 2 years? Deep, progressive and techy, what
you expect of James.


10. Nite:Life 06 - Mixed by Ian Pooley

- OK this one is oldest (2001). But this is some damn sexy, jazzy,
soulful, groovy deep house.


There, I feel better now.  :)


So what's on YOUR iPod? 

- Jeff

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Gays to Withdraw Cash From Banks-Could Total Billions

that's a pretty funny story.

where I finally got with all this, is that the proposed family
amendment to the US Constitution wants to turn US citizens who just
happen to have this orientation, into 3/5ths of a human being, just
like blacks used to be

So not cool, and a big step backwards.

Either everyone is equal in this country, or they aren't and I say

5 Fifths or Fight!

How's that for a rallying cry/slogan?

Subject: [sfraves] Beastie Boys are always on vacation!!!

I'm actually writing a review of the new Beastie Boys CD myself right
now that I might post a link to here when i'm done, and I'm trying not
to repeat anything anyone else is doing so i'm looking at what other
people are saying and I found this:

http://www.joyzine.co.uk/bboy.htm

too funny, and it would be great if this as a review style catches on, ya'think?

What's the real kick in the teeth for me, is that last week when I
de-lurked here after like a 2 year layoff with those really long
political posts out of nowhere, (that someone told me off-list are
better off going into my Live Journal, which sounds about right),  I
came to the realization that had I just posted a link to it, like I am
here:

http://www.beastieboys.com/ 

(doesn't that artwerk on the cover with the Towers standing like 9.11
never happened give you goosebumps? It does me. What a bold, visionary
artistic statement),

it would have been a lot better way to present some of the ideas I was
putting out, just to use shorthand and recommend this CD to people,
since they're sying the same things I am, save that they're so much
better at it than I am.

On repeated listenings what i'm hearing is that they're performing a
political miracle.....

They're showing us a way to take the rancor out of politics.

I now believe that we're going to be able to move the caliber of
political discussion in this country *back* to being a dialogue and
away from being in this crazed polemical state it's in today.

It WILL happen.

Holy shit, that's so huge i don't even have werds for it, except to say

a) sorry for dragging ya'll through those long posts, when this woulda
been a much better way to do it, so I'm doing it now.

:P

b) i have a much different sense of direction than I've had in a long
time, a lot of negativity and sense of overall despair that I've had
over things has moved out of my body and I'm now seeing a way out of
all this that i just couldn't see before.

It's a rush.

For the past few days I've been floating on air, feels like I took a
hit of pharm grade mdma, except that I haven't.

If you're not feeling it, let me share this with you......

Even if Bush wins the election, as bad as it will be for the country,
it won't matter because he and his crew are in the process of
self-destructing, and more importantly, the Democratic Party, as well
as other groups that share some of that ideological mindset, are in
the strongest position they has been in the last two decades, even
though it doesn't look like it this very second.

The tide *is* turning, I'm sure of it, I can feel it in my bones, and
that, my friends, has sucked the fight, or the desire to fight out of
me.

Even if this process takes 20 years to get to, and i, for one, am
prepared to wait for it, now that i know that we as a people are going
to get there, it changes everything for me.

man, if only i could bottle this feeling up and put it into a pill.

;-)

m'kay, now back 2 the music!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] SRR: F*ck Big Media: Rolling Your Own Network

I just read the full article, I should have soner. What's most
interesting in it was BBC's "Flexible TV", a video-on-demand service
for PC using BitTorrent at its distribution mechanism.

That can really be a blueprint for grassroot internet media. Using a
P2P model takes away the enormous bandwith requirement of streaming
video. Not to mention that this can also be used as strong evidence of
P2P's "substantial non-infriging use" if INDUCE Act ever become law
and we have to strike it down in Supreme Court.

Sorry, this is getting hella NRR. I'm kind of a copyright/media reformist. =
LOL

Subject: Re: [sfraves] BSP:  Beats On The Cheap

Not a bad time - too bad the Long Island Ice Tea I quaffed turned my ass out
and forced me home much earlier than anticipated, lol.

One thing I noticed about last night tho was, it seemed like the epitome of
"fashionably late" there. People didn't really turn up till well after 11pm

delusional happy talk (you did say you felt you were on MDMA)
If Bush wins, "they" are reinvigorated because they obviously have
a mandate from the American people to do whatever they like.  If
Bush loses, "they're" going to make life for Kerry 10x worse than
Clinton ever had it - they had a taste of almost absolute power and
they are not going to give it up.

Things may be better 20 years from now, but that's only because
an entire generation has died off.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] BSP :: FREE Underground in SF tonight..

I had some friends that got married in '00. The wedding and reception were 
at a house out in the boondocks of VA (near Quantico).

There were around 15 dj's and 100 + ravers there. It was perhaps one of the 
most raucous events I have ever attended. Considering how close we were to 
the FBI academy - and the large quantities of illicit substances that were 
being bandied about, it's a wonder there weren't a metric shit-ton of felony 
arrests/charges levied....

Weddings can be GRATE!

hello, this is a continuation of a fictional piece:
 
supa got bored with dealing with ig. as great as ig is, supa is a little bit more independent, and longing for an independent journey to the east coast. supa knows that everyone "thinks" they are on east coast time, but no one is a slick as the east coast variety, plus, it is time to hit up his favorite aunt for import candy to bring home to ig. :)

Bush will need a vacation if he wins, and, given the exigiences of hs

That'll fuck anynes shit up, i know I'd freak if I was in the spot he's in.

Subject: [sfraves] Notice: Subscription moderation turned off, new configuration

Hi All-

Last week Brian and I modified the SFRaves list configuration so we 
could keep the list open with subscriptions but have some level of 
security against those who want to abuse it.

So far seems to be working great, so I'm letting you guys know. For 
everyone on the list now it's back to business-as-usual, the only 
difference is new subscribers might experience a delay in their first few 
posts.

Any questions, just let me know =)

DON'T YOU STOP

Cori Taratoot, PopMatters

2004 has been a strange year for the feminist superheroes of
Le Tigre. But a new major-label deal is giving them the
chance to blast their queer-positive, progressive message
to more listeners than ever before.

"The government, which was designed for the people, has got into the hands 
of the bosses and their employers, the special interests.  An invisible 
empire has been set up above the forms of democracy."
-Woodrow Wilson

"There are times when you have to obey a call which is the highest of all, 
i.e. the voice of conscience even though such obedience may cost many a 
bitter tear, and even more, separation from friends, from family, from the 
state to which you may belong, from all that you have held as dear as life 
itself. For this obedience is the law of our being."
   Gandhi

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: ROOM FOR RENT!!

Howdy Boys and gurls..

The time has come again when I have a room for rent and im looking for a 
cool down to earth roomate here is the skinny on my place:

2 Bedrom 2 1/2 Bath Townhouse located centrally in Milpitas (southbay)
Near all Major freeways (101,237,680,280 etc) Close to the great mall and 
McCarthy ranch.
Room for rent: Dimensions 11W x 13L Nice Mid size room two good sized 
sliding Mirrored closets
Private Balcony,Private Bathroom and exclusive access to one car garage.
Rent $650 Plus half Utilities.
Perks (Me as a roomate)!! Well that ain't really a perk but im laid back and 
cool so I guess in a way it can be.

House specifics. Central A/C and Heat. Satellite TV in every room. Nice 
living room entertainment center with 50 Inch TV for you die hard TV addicts 
such as myself.  Wireless DSL etc..

I will have pics up soon after I paint the room.

minor roomie requirements:
Male or female 21+  (Male prefered)
Non Smoker (Or smoke outside)
420 Friendly but it pretty much stops there with the occasional others.
Stable income, don't have to be a "Techie" but at least be able to support 
yourself.
Snowboarder or mountain biker (You get ++ points)
DJ,Artist or all around cool person (++ points again.)

If you read this far.. thanks  ;-)

If your interested or know someone that is hit me up privately and I can go 
over it some more.

Macadio

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Beastie Boys are always on vacation!!!

Points taken, but I wasn't talking about that.

I'm talking about a **real** vacation, not one of those empty
self-indulgent cruises to nowhere, or one that's all about  living in
the land of posture like George does in Crawford TX every year, but
one for his soul.

The path he and his associates have been on cannot possibly be a
healthy one for the spirit.

Have George go to Esalen, Harbin Hot Springs, or Taos, NM, and do a
few workshops and get in touch with his humanity.

Mebbe a re-birthing werkshop would be just the thing for where George's at.

Get some healing going on. 

I'm only saying this because I care about George as another human
being, just like me and everyone else, I really and truly deeply do.

No matter what.

I'm no longer going to get sucked into the hate on hate on hate hate
on hate on hate game, no matter how easy, seductive that is.

That's over for me.

Somehow i managed to break the spell of that, and I now see a way out.

Everything I'll be saying or doing from this point on is a result of that.

you've been warned, & I mean that in the nicest way possible.

:-)

either plur is an all-inclusive concept, or it isn't.

And if it isn't, then I've been fooling myself about who I am & what
I'm about for a very long time.

if plurs something I say I believe in, then I better start acting like
it if I want to sleep well at night.

the real litmus test of plur is not at some party with the most
awesome vibe ver, but comes when dealing with someone that you don't
necessarily agree with, or better yet, this person made it quite
clear, (see: rave act), that they don't like you at all

you know George won't like the idea of trying a different approach at
first, especially if his mindset is that he's beyond redemption, but
he'll thank us later for suggesting it.

I know this.

It's either that, or him going out & getting blinding drunk. 

(which, 12 step opinions to the contrary, (btw, i'm living
motherfucking proof that those guys don't have all the answers they
fucking think they do), may not be the 'bad' thing it looks like at
first blush.
God, if his Dad could chow down on Pork Rinds for the cameras, George
can certainly pop open a tall cool Bud, and not suffer for it in the
least, ya think? After all, given his history with alcohol he'd be
doing nothing more than following his bliss.)

Getting unutterably hammered is fun, as we all know, and is great for
the pressure release I'm talking about, which George so obviously
needs, as well, but doesn't have lasting effects that carry into one's
life, so I'd suggest he goes on a retreat of some sort after the
election, whetehr or not he wins, or doesn't.

Christopher Reeve (Sept. 25, 1952 - Oct. 11, 2004)

"Look, I've flown, I've become evil, loved, stopped and turned the
world backward, I've faced my peers, I've befriended children and small
animals and I've rescued cats from trees," Reeve told the Los Angeles
Times in 1983, just before the release of the third "Superman" movie.
"What else is there left for Superman to do that hasn't been done?"

"I refuse to allow a disability to determine how I live my life. I
don't mean to be reckless, but setting a goal that seems a bit daunting
actually is very helpful toward recovery," Reeve said after his 1995
horse-riding accident that caused his paralysis.

"The government, which was designed for the people, has got into the hands 
of the bosses and their employers, the special interests.  An invisible 
empire has been set up above the forms of democracy."
-Woodrow Wilson

"There are times when you have to obey a call which is the highest of all, 
i.e. the voice of conscience even though such obedience may cost many a 
bitter tear, and even more, separation from friends, from family, from the 
state to which you may belong, from all that you have held as dear as life 
itself. For this obedience is the law of our being."
   Gandhi

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Beastie Boys are always on vacation!!!

totally natural, and it's been like this for going on a week now.

nice thing is, is that it doesn't wear off, and there's no come down,
at least not yet.

it's like touring around the Nation while being on a permanent vacation.

you can have it too, if you like. 

catch is, to get to this point, I had to lose the anger first. 

which I did.

this is so great to feel this way, esecially in these, oh, so polemical times.

mad props to Mike & Dave for putting me in check for ragging on the
Cheney look-a-like dude in the elevator, (yup he's God's kid too, and
if I bump into him again I will tell him that I was out of line,
unless, of course, he cleans my clock first), last week, it kinda
triggered this line of thinking.

Here's the short version of how to get get here.

Know, not think or feel, but KNOW that the Democratic Party today is
in the strongest position it's been in a long, long, long time, the
wife says at least since 1992.

This is a direct result of being woken up by people like Dr. Dean, and
Michael Moore, who also, SuperDuperSpecialExtra added bonus,  proved
the point beyond any reasonable doubt that it IS true that just one
person can make a difference.

Know that the poor Republicans, who seem to have it all at this point,
(like the friggin' House, Senate, WH & SC), are on their way out, even
as we speak.

Won't happen in this election cycle, and maybe not even in the next
one, but they are not only finished, but they won't be coming back in
their present form because in one of the greatest acts of political
self-sabotage, ever, they've undermined their long-term prospects by
not cultivating a back bench.

Outside of a man like John McCain, there's no there there.

they present leadership of the Republican Party has  driven away many,
many good and decent Republicans, myself included.

I just now got werd, Hello 2day, that my voter registration and party
affiliation switch just went through.

I just turned 40 this year, and for the first time, ever, in my voting
life i'm no longer a Republican, but a Democrat, and I won't be going
back, which really stung at first, but what choice did I have?

I didn't do this lightly, at all.

To borrow a phrase, I didn't leave them, they left me, and I know that
there are hundreds of thousands of Americans that feel the same way,
and we are the fucking future of this country.

OK, and this is really important, and if you can dial into this, KNOW
these people that are 'large and in charge' are very sick people and
you don't get mad at sick people, that's not the right way to go about
it.

Would you lay into your Mom because she has cancer?

Same thing.

No point in getting angry or mad or upset because a new society is
coming up on the horizon, one that you and I and everyone we know will
build.

It's gonna be a **lot** of hard werk to get there from here, and Bush
may even have to win this time to make it happen.

which may not be a bad thing, over time, because the upside of that is
is that the lessons we're in the process of learning today as a people
will really stick.

We'll know better than to go back down that path again.

It takes time to build.

you gotz to chillllllll....

:-)

peaceout motherfucker,

nwa

ps: even with all this 'A Bitter Pill' is still very much a GO, I
haven't completely gone off the deep end with this.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Christopher Reeve (Sept. 25, 1952 - Oct. 11, 2004)

Semiotic deconstructionist Jacques Derrida died today as well and his
passing has not gotten near the same amount of play in the Press,
'natch.

I wrote this below to another list in response to that.....


Holy fuck, this is bigger than the passing of Reeves.

weird that they'd check out within the same 24 hour time period.

without a fucking doubt both these men were Supermen, in their
respective, chosen, fields

I wore my star-spangled 'S' t-shirt to werk today, & will again tmw, as a s=
how
of respect 4 Mr. Reeves, and the Kinks 'Superman' has been on mtv
level heavy rotation  here in the old homestead since day-break as well.

i werked with Mr. Reeves back in 1986 on his (& Morgan Freeman's
breakthrough, Academy Award nominated, role, in 'Street Smart),' it's
always a blow when that happens to someone you've been in the same
vicinity with.

Odd how that is.

I never got to have that w/Mr. Derrida, but since I've traveled in the
high country of the mind, for a spell, I feel his loss just as acutely.

It's going to take a lot more effort on my part to acknowledge him &
his passing than throwing on some ratty ass t-shirt & playing
some tunes.

then again, "Superman" is a fitting tribute to him as well & it would
werk great as a d'n'b or House remix.

if nothing else, it's good that it was you that broke the news to me.

thanks.

i'm gonna go light a few candles now.

peaceout mothrfucker

oh I have.  I've understood the shape of things to come for some time
as well as the deeper resonances (now you understand what Tom and
I keep jabbering about on RaverG, how one election isn't going to do
squat?)

But I still battle with despair because it is going to take a lot of strife
before things get much better and the global outcome is not at all certain.
And America has people who aren't afraid to use nuclear weapons

Great, so knowing this, where do we go from here?

This will take some long term planning & execution on our part & as my
dad used to say.....

There's no time like the present, is there?

SUPPRESSING THE BLACK VOTE
http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/9660865.htm

BOB HEBERT, NY TIMES - More than 80 percent of the population of Detroit
is black. This is very well understood by John Pappageorge, who is white
and a Republican state legislator in Michigan. "If we do not suppress
the Detroit vote," said Pappageorge, "we're going to have a tough time
in this election."

Oops! Republicans aren't supposed to actually say they want to suppress
black votes. That's so retro. It's so Jim Crow. This is the 21st
century, and the thing now is to do the dastardly deed, but never ever
acknowledge it. That's where our friend Pappageorge went wrong.

After his startling quote was published several weeks ago in the Detroit
Free Press, Pappageorge, who is 73, apologized and said he certainly
never meant to suggest that anything racist or illegal take place. But
he reiterated to me in a phone conversation last Friday that he did
indeed mean that the vote in Detroit needed to be kept down.

A lot of other Republicans have similar views about the vote in areas
with large black populations. Most blacks vote Democratic. If those
votes can be suppressed, Republicans benefit. And there is increasing
evidence that a big effort to suppress the vote among blacks and some
other heavily Democratic voting groups is under way, which is why it is
important to keep the following phone number handy:

1-866-OUR VOTE.

That's a hot line set up by the Election Protection Coalition, a group
that was formed to identify and stamp out attempts to disenfranchise
voters, especially in predominantly black and Latino precincts around
the country.

On Election Day in November, the coalition expects to have as many as
25,000 volunteers, including 5,000 lawyers, available to provide
assistance to voters who encounter irregularities or feel they are not
being treated fairly at the polls. Voters who call the hot line will
immediately be put in touch with volunteers in their local area. The
coalition is also urging people to call the hot line now if they are
aware of efforts to discourage or prevent people from voting.

threats during he late 40's-60's (Jim Crow)

Subject: [sfraves] NRR - Santa Cruz raises its Limits for Medical Users =)

Just a little late on sending this out, but i thought a few people on
here may still be interested to here about this...

http://safeaccessnow.org/article.php?id=1470

-------------------

Medical pot limit raised in Santa Cruz

by Maria Alicia Gaura, San Francisco Chronicle
October 7th, 2004
 
 
Santa Cruz County medical marijuana users may now legally possess as
much as 3 pounds of pot -- at least as far as the local authorities
are concerned.

The county Board of Supervisors voted unanimously Tuesday to set the
3- pound limit at the urging of medical marijuana advocates, who
argued that the sickest patients frequently use upwards of an ounce of
marijuana per week to ease their symptoms. The board also voted to
allow medical users to grow a home garden plot of the herb measuring
100 square feet.

Marijuana is an annual crop, so the 3-pound limit will allow users to
obtain a single supply that can last them an entire year.

"Three pounds sounds like a lot, but it's just a few marijuana
cigarettes per day, when you break it down," said Valerie Corral, one
of the founders of the Wo/Men's Alliance for Medical Marijuana, a
Santa Cruz marijuana-growing collective.

Corral uses marijuana several times daily to suppress seizures caused
by injuries she suffered in a car accident.

"About 15 percent of our patients use in excess of 5 pounds per year,"
Corral said. "They suffer from everything from chronic pain to cancer
and AIDS, chemotherapy and wasting."

While the new county ordinance will protect marijuana users from
prosecution by local law enforcement, it won't do much to dissuade
federal agents. The federal government does not recognize California's
rules allowing medical marijuana use, which voters enacted in 1996 by
passing Proposition 215.

"The federal government still insists that there is no such thing as
medicinal marijuana," said Glenn Backes, director of the Sacramento
office of the Drug Policy Alliance, a national advocacy group
organized to reform drug laws.

"Unfortunately, these state and local guidelines still leave patients
vulnerable to attack from the feds," Backes said.

Last October, outgoing Gov. Gray Davis signed a bill by state Sen.
John Vasconcellos, D-San Jose, that attempted to standardize the
jumble of local medical marijuana legislation passed after Prop. 215
took effect.

The bill, SB420, set a statewide possession limit of 8 ounces of
medical marijuana for patients with a doctor's recommendation, but
encouraged individual communities to set higher limits if they saw
fit. The legislation also allows medical users to possess six mature
marijuana plants or 12 immature plants for personal use.

(The bill number was an inside joke referring to 4:20 p.m. -- the time
that many recreational users like to take a smoke break and some refer
to as "Miller time for stoners.")

Santa Cruz County is among a growing number of communities that have
adopted higher limits, according to NORML, the National Organization
for Reform of Marijuana Laws.

Humboldt and Sonoma counties have limits similar to Santa Cruz's.
Calaveras County allows possession of six plants and 2 pounds of dried
marijuana. Yuba County allows five plants and 1.5 pounds, and the city
of Berkeley allows 10 plants and 2.5 pounds.

Santa Cruz attorney Ben Rice, who represents the Wo/Men's Alliance for
Medical Marijuana, says that the new limits are a positive step, but
that more refinements to the law are needed.

"It is kind of a bare-bones ordinance," Rice said. "One question that
remains is, what should law enforcement do when it comes across what
is alleged to be a medical marijuana garden?

"Historically they cut down the plants and resolve the issue later --
and in the meantime the medicine is lost," Rice said. "I've had a
couple of pounds of (seized marijuana) returned that was nothing more
than green mush."

He cited a city of Santa Cruz guideline that directs police to take a
sample of the suspect marijuana as well as photographs, but to leave
the plants standing until the district attorney decides whether to
file charges.

3 Eeers for Santa Cruz!!

Eeer!
Eeer!
Eeer!

I love santa cruz, almost all of the time.  I firmly believe that the local 
government sets ordinance for the people, and the county sheriff's 
department does what they can for people.. untill the feds tell them to do 
otherwise.. and then it is not without some positioning by local authority.

Deal with the feds... and the states will follow. Kerry 2004!

Subject: [sfraves] DJ/COLLECTIVE question...

Just curiously - how do you folks out there in crews/collectives decide who 
is and isn't "material" for your crew/collective?

Is it a strictly friends type of thing, or are there more qualifications 
necessary than that?

I realize style/genre, etc. play into it as well - but what do you all truly 
look for in your DJ's?

Just curious, and to be honest, part of the reason I ask is because I'd kind 
of like to find some West Coast affiliation sometime in the near future...my 
East Coast credentials aren't really helping me much here. Heh.

Well, aside from being a DJ, to be in my collective you have to have
found One Eye'd Willy's treasure, and escape the Fratelli's.  If
you've done that, you're a shoe in.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] DJ/COLLECTIVE question...

1) you have to be decently good.  not absolutely top-notch, but
pretty good for what you do.

2) commitment and willingness to help.  if you don't help, you
don't get the bookings.

3) we all get along.  ie:  if you're harassing all the females
in the collective, then you're gone.

4) meet an unmet need.  ie:  you're good at decorations, you
have sound, a generator, etc.  this is not necessarily
essential, but is nice to have.

If you so wish...not a requirement...but a nice lil added bonus, you
will get better booking slots if you do, specially if your one of the

Subject: [sfraves] Marginal Groove: The Politics of Raves in Richmond

Something I accidentally found today...


Everyone knows how it feels to be out of place.
However, not everyone knows explicitly what that
means. To be out of place is to fall outside of
certain "expectations about behavior that relate a
position in a social structure to actions in space"
(Cresswell, 1996, p. 3). Ideological norms are
determined by those highest in the social hierarchy to
further and perpetuate their dominance. In this
complex web of power relations, places are inscribed
with and convey meanings; these are ordinarily
implicit, requiring a disruptive event to expose them.

Raves may be and have been examples of transgression
in many places they have occurred. A rave is typically
an all-night social gathering, featuring electronic
music and dancing. Common but not essential to these
events is a variety of psychedelic stimuli, including
visual effects and the consumption of recreational
drugs by some participants (see Brown, 1995; Rietveld,
1993; RollerGirl, 2000). As a culture, rave has its
roots in the United Kingdom's acid house movement of
1988 and 1989, which was set off by the combination of
house music from the United States, New Age hippy
values, and the empathogenic drug ecstasy (Silcott,
1999). Loosely described as a subculture or
counterculture, rave made its way to North America,
first establishing itself in New York, and slowly
spreading across the United States and Canada during
the 1990s.

In Moksha the procedure involves a current member sponsoring someone he/she 
knows for new membership.  The current member then becomes a mentor for the 
newbie and is responsible for bringing him/her up to speed on collective 
responsibilities and procedures.  The newbie is then required to work 
successfully at one party before he/she becomes a permanent member.

>truly look for in your DJ's?

Depends on the event, that is, what themes and genres are the 
focus.  Overall we look for very competent DJs who can get people to dance 
on the dancefloors;  when we offer a chill room, we look for innovative DJs 
in the ambient genres.  We are much interested in giving new talent 
opportunities to perform.

Moksha has a music team comprised of permanent and volunteer members who 
make DJ selections and then offer their recommendations to the collective 
as a whole for approval.  The team listens to promotional CDs we have been 
sent as part of the selection process.

That's a brief response, Marc(O):)  If you have more questions, give me a 
hit off line.

Much love,

Apollo

What do you know about organizing a collective dude?  Does bringing in

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: any financially challenged and mechanically inclined people out there?

Ok, sorry about the NRR but I'm having major problems finding a
mechanic. Actually, it's kind of rave-related, I need to get her fixed
so I can haul other people's sound systems again! nyuk nyuk.

If you, or anyone you know is a mechanic and is looking to make a few
bucks, I need someone to cruise by my place on Friday to replace the
starter and a few other items in my pickup. CL is proving to have no
one competent or reliable and the only friend i have that's halfway
mechanically competent is in Fresno.

I will pay cash. Or do the work for free and I'll haul your sound
system anytime you want :o) Please email me if you can help. Peace
y'all.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] DJ/COLLECTIVE question...

Nice to see a potentially great thread deprecate into peanut gallery 
humor....um ok not really ;-)

Looks like a loaded post to me.

imho, a superstar collective DJ should:

Spin a rockin' set, schlep gear up and down the beach (or in/out the 
warehouse), bring personality, hang with the locals, treat a booking as an 
"adventure", fix EQ'ing for sound people correctly, know how to re-fill a 
generator (or assist in the breakers blowing), know how to talk to the 
cops, spin a rockin' set....no, not the same one you did last weekend, 
pick up trash, come to breakfast, have a bloody mary/mimosa at breakfast, 
talk shit at breakfast, and all for no money and be willing to do it again 
next weekend =) Grilling a tri-tip in the afternoon a plus.

Wow, that sounds cool, doesn't it =)

Libertarians Win a Hearing in Debate Case

BY JOSH GERSTEIN - Staff Reporter of the New York Sun
October 11, 2004
URL: http://www.nysun.com/article/2962

The third and final debate between President Bush and Senator Kerry has 
been thrown into doubt after a state judge in Arizona ordered a hearing 
on whether the event, scheduled for Wednesday, should be halted because 
the Libertarian Party's nominee for president has not been invited.

Judge F. Pendleton Gaines III instructed the debate's hosts, Arizona 
State University and the Commission on Presidential Debates, to appear 
in his courtroom in Phoenix tomorrow to respond to a lawsuit filed last 
week by the Libertarians.

"I'm happy so far with the way things are going," an attorney for the 
Libertarian Party, David Euchner, said in an interview yesterday. "He 
did not have to sign that order. The fact that he did is a good sign."

The suit argues that the university is illegally donating state 
resources to the Republican and Democratic Parties by serving as host 
for a debate that showcases Messrs. Bush and Kerry but excludes their 
Libertarian counterpart, Michael Badnarik, who is on the ballot in 
Arizona and 47 other states.

"They can't have debates that make public expenditures for private 
benefit," Mr. Euchner said. "A.S.U. is spending its money in violation 
of the state constitution."

A spokeswoman for the university, Nancy Neff, said she was unaware of 
the hearing tomorrow. "If that's the judge's order, then we'll be there 
for sure," Ms. Neff said.

While the university is constructing a massive press filing center and 
has incurred large expenses for security, Ms. Neff insisted the debate 
will take place at no cost to taxpayers.

"We are not spending public money on the debate. We have underwritten 
it using private donations, in-kind gifts, and private foundation 
funds," the university spokeswoman said. "The price we've been working 
with is $2.5 million, and that's what we've been trying to raise," Ms. 
Neff said.

Major sponsors for the third debate include a heavy equipment maker, 
Caterpillar Inc.; a local utility company, APS, and an Indian tribal 
group that owns two casinos near Scottsdale, the Salt River 
Pima-Maricopa Indian Community.

Ms. Neff acknowledged, however, that the university has yet to raise 
all the funds required for the event, which is scheduled to take place 
at an auditorium on the school's Tempe campus, just east of Phoenix. 
"We're still raising money even as we work on it," she said, adding 
that at the last tally about $2.3 million had been pledged.

Mr. Euchner said the university's claim that no public money is 
involved is laughable. "The fact they've got their hat in hand helps 
us," he said. "The evidence is pretty clear that if there's a shortfall 
here that A.S.U. is holding the bag. They made, essentially, an 
interest free loan."

Mr. Euchner said the state's involvement in the debate is part of what 
many Libertarians see as a pattern of improper use of government funds 
to promote the two major parties. "Taxpayers foot the bill for the 
Democratic and Republican national conventions," he complained. 
"Anything they can get the taxpayers to pay for that way, they do it."

Several legal experts said the Libertarians face an uphill battle in 
attempting to use the so-called gift clause of the Arizona Constitution 
to block Wednesday's debate.

"It doesn't strike me as a very strong ground," an author of a book on 
the Arizona Constitution, Toni McClory, said. "It's not a violation of 
the gift clause if the state is getting something of real value." While 
state universities have been hosts to presidential debates in the past, 
Arizona State is the only one to do so this year.

Ms. McClory, who teaches at a community college near Phoenix, said the 
publicity surrounding the debate might be considered a substantial 
benefit to the university. "It's giving the university a great deal of 
public exposure," she said.

A law professor at the University of Arizona, Robert Glennon, said the 
court dispute is likely to turn on whether Arizona State is seen as 
discriminating against the Libertarians. He said offering the 
Libertarians the use of a similar facility on campus would probably be 
enough to fulfill the state's obligations.

"So long as the state has a nondiscriminatory policy, the fact that one 
particular party or one religion uses it is of no consequence," Mr. 
Glennon said. The professor noted that the requirements to bring a case 
for abuse of taxpayer funds are often lower in state courts than in the 
federal system, but he said he was surprised that the judge granted the 
Libertarians a hearing.

Judge Gaines was appointed to the bench in 1999 by Gov. Jane Hull, a 
Republican. In his show-cause order issued Friday morning, the judge 
also required that the university and the debate commission be served 
with the lawsuit by Friday afternoon. An attorney for the university 
accepted service, but security guards at the commission's headquarters 
in Washington ordered process-servers to leave the building, Mr. 
Euchner said.

Indeed, Mr. Badnarik and the Green Party nominee, David Cobb, were 
arrested Friday night after they crossed a police line at the 
presidential debate in St. Louis. Mr. Badnarik said he was trying to 
serve the lawsuit on a representative of the debate commission. The two 
candidates were released after being given tickets for trespassing and 
refusing a reasonable order from a policeman.

The commission, which is a nonprofit corporation, has insisted that it 
applies nonpartisan criteria to determine who is invited to the 
debates. The rules require that candidates have at least 15% support in 
national polls to qualify. None of the third-party candidates this year 
has met that hurdle.

Critics of the debate commission assert that it is little more than a 
front for the major parties. They note that the Democrats and the GOP 
issued a joint press release announcing the creation of the 
"bipartisan" commission and describing its purpose as facilitating 
debates between their "respective nominees." More recently, the 
commission has described itself as "nonpartisan," although its 
adherence to that standard remains in question.

Last month, a spokesman for the debate commission told the Sun that the 
panel could not comply with a provision in the agreement worked out 
between the Bush and Kerry campaigns that dictated the makeup of the 
audience for Friday's town meeting debate be one-half "soft" supporters 
of Mr. Bush and one-half "soft" supporters of Mr. Kerry. "We can't use 
soft Bush and soft Kerry supporters because we are a nonpartisan group, 
not a bipartisan group," said the commission spokesman, who asked not 
to be named. "We have said we'd use undecided voters."

In an interview with CNN last week, the editor in chief of Gallup, 
Frank Newport, said that more than 90% of those in the audience for 
Friday's debate had stated a "soft" preference for either Mr. Bush or 
Mr. Kerry. Mr. Newport did not indicate whether supporters of the 
independent candidate Ralph Nader or of Mr. Badnarik were considered 
for the audience.

In August, a federal judge in Washington sharply criticized the Federal 
Election Commission for ignoring evidence of bias on the part of the 
debate commission. Judge Henry Kennedy Jr. noted that in 2000 the 
debate commission gave security guards "facebooks" with pictures of 
third-party candidates and instructed the guards to prevent those in 
the photos from entering the debate venues, even with valid audience 
tickets. "The exclusion policy appears partisan on its face," Judge 
Kennedy wrote.

In a national poll taken in September, 57% of likely voters favored 
including presidential candidates other than the president and the 
Massachusetts senator in the debates. The survey, conducted by Zogby 
International, found 57% of likely voters in favor of adding Mr. Nader, 
and 44% in favor of including Mr. Badnarik.

"The government, which was designed for the people, has got into the hands

empire has been set up above the forms of democracy."
-Woodrow Wilson

"There are times when you have to obey a call which is the highest of all, 
i.e. the voice of conscience even though such obedience may cost many a 
bitter tear, and even more, separation from friends, from family, from the 
state to which you may belong, from all that you have held as dear as life 
itself. For this obedience is the law of our being."
   Gandhi

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."

	Would you be asking that question if we were speaking of international 
monitors invited by right-wing politicians and groups? Seems to me that 
it's in the interest of fair elections to have monitors brought in by 
people from a variety of political backgrounds, not just one (whatever 
that one may be).

	Exit polls are all well and good, but official outcomes are determined 
based on tallied results, not exit polls, so you still want to make 
sure that there's no opportunity for anyone to tamper with the vote 
count.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] DJ/COLLECTIVE question...

I feel that too. I guess one of the resons I asked, is because having been
an independant, and only recently associated myself with a partner (thus
forming our wikkid two man crew, lol) I would like to perhaps find a
crew/collective that was likeminded. I could care less about trying to make
myself seem cooler by having stuff after my name, because not much could
make me cool, hehe. To me it's more of a "these are my people, we look out
for each other and want to bring you the best party experience we can" type
of thing.

*shrug*

Thanks for all the fedback thus far tho folks - it's nice to see a topic on
here that isn't saturated in politics.

They should sell their decks and find another hobby.... or get over 
themselves and get back on the dancefloor.
125 mg of MDMA should assist in this.

I'm going to have to disagree with this.  Some DJs don't dance much 
anymore from  knee surgeries, spending too many long nights dancing on a 
concrete dance floor or any number of things that just make easy mobility 
of knees nearly impossible.

Should I sell my decks and my studio?  No.

Just wondering, knowing it's hard for smaller parties to get into the 
debates, would it make sense for all the small parties to have some kind of a primary 
among themselves to determine which person would be THE third-party 
candidate? 

I'd be interested in hearing another view besides Bush and Kerry ... I really 
would. However, with a limited amount of time, I don't think people want to 
see eight candidates on stage without any way to ask questions in any depth. 
Maybe if the third parties could list all their candidates and collectively 
vote, at primary time, on which candidate would have the best chance of 
challenging the Demo and Republican candidates. 

One fairly strong third-party candidate would have a lot more pull than eight 
or so minor candidates who deserve a chance but don't have one. I know it 
"doesn't work that way" but it's something i just thought of and i don't think 
it's a bad idea.

But they do act as an indicator of fowl play.  I believe their
elimination was a conscious effort to allow for that fowl play.

Uhhh, no. :)

The minority parties, for the most part, represent very specific
positions on a wide array of issues. Libertarians, for instance, would
be unlikely to support the nomination of a Green party candidate because
their party stands in direct opposition to the regulation of industry
that the Green party advocates.

That's not the point though. Minority parties don't seek just to
challenge the major parties for the hell of it; rather, they have
specific policies that they want to push. Nominating a single third
party candidate doesn't accomplish this goal, so I doubt that any
minority parties would support doing so.

No shit. That is and always has been my biggest complaint about some
of the underground scenes. They keep scheduling DJs because they're
friends even though those friends tend (over many instances) not to
generate dancing!

DJs who continually put out lackluster sets that are disconnected
from any crowd... that's just annoying loud music. I can go to
social scenes without that.

It's rocket science, and every DJ should aspire to it. How do you
make people dance? Learn it. It's not easy or obvious. But if you're
dedicated to it, you will get there.

And if you don't care if you make people dance, why the fuck are you
playing records at dance parties?

Sean

Yeah - but look at the majority of DJs out there! Most I know will at 
most bob their heads a little while standing around on the floor, but 
nothing else...such a sad state of affairs...

So...dance, dammit! <ahem> excuse me.

I sort of go back and forth- I'm so into the music sometimes at parties

that and actually get down to it :)

Not dancing just so you can keep your "cool factor" up, however, is
dumb.  Dancing is cool anyway!

Mobile phone 'ear tumours risk'

Using a mobile phone for 10 years or more increases the risk of ear tumours 
by four times, research suggests.

A 750-people study by Sweden's Karolinska Institute found the risk of 
acoustic neuroma rose by 3.9 times on the side of the head the phone is used.

There was no increase in risk on the other side of the head - giving an 
overall rise in risk of 1.9 times.

Acoustic neuroma is a benign tumour in the auditory nerve, which can cause 
brain and nerve damage.

It affects one in 100,000 people.

Those who had used mobile phones for less than 10 years were not at a 
greater risk, the team reported.

IOut of the 750 people who took part in the study, 150 had acoustic neuroma 
and of those one in 11 had used a mobile phone for at least a decade.

Professor Anders Ahlbom, from the Stockholm-based institute, told BBC News 
Online he was "surprised" by his team's findings.

"The results show there is a relatively substantial risk and we are hoping 
others will follow up our research.

"We do not know what is causing it but the risk certainly increases over 
time."

He said he would not go as far as warning people not to use mobile phones.

But he added: "If people are concerned the simple way to avoid risk is to 
use a hands-free kit.

"Our researched showed that the risk is only on the side of the head on 
which the mobile phone is used."

Risk

At the time of the study only analogue mobile phones had been in use for 
more than 10 years.

The majority of people now have digital (GSM) phones, which came on to the 
market in the mid to late 1990s.

Some of the people who took part in the study had used both analogue and 
digital phones. There was no evidence to suggest solely using digital 
phones for 10 years increased the risk.

Dr Michael Clarke, a spokesman for the National Radiological Protection 
Board, the UK's advisory group, said it was a "good study from a well 
respected institute".

He said: "It is suggestive rather than conclusive but we will obviously 
take it into account when we issue guidance in the future."

And a spokeswoman for the Mobile Operators Association said: "The mobile 
phone industry takes very seriously questions relating to the safety of its 
products and is committed to addressing public concern in an open and 
transparent manner."

But she added: "Individual studies must be seen in the light of the total 
research effort into mobile phone safety. There have been other recent 
studies that have failed to show any link between mobile phones and tumours."

Three quarters of adults in the UK own or use a mobile phone.

The mobile phone industry has always maintained there is no scientific 
evidence of negative effects from mobile phone use.

But over the last few years experts have remained divided over the question 
of risk.

A study by Finnish scientists in 2002 found electromagnetic radiation, 
which is emitted from mobile phones, affected human brain tissue.

But the UK government-commissioned Stewart report in 2000 concluded there 
was no evidence of harm associated with using mobile phones.

However, the report recommended a precautionary approach and said children 
should only use mobile phones in emergencies.

"There are times when you have to obey a call which is the highest of all, 
i.e. the voice of conscience even though such obedience may cost many a 
bitter tear, and even more, separation from friends, from family, from the 
state to which you may belong, from all that you have held as dear as life 
itself. For this obedience is the law of our being."

Subject: [sfraves] Wed Night review: Clandestine in SJ... woooooooohooooooo =)

So like over 2 months ago, my Jungle DJ Homie from LA,
DJ Primo, told me that he was gonna be up here spinning
@ a Jungle Club & ofcourse Hello 2Day, I said I was
down to support!!  Also, I was getting hella shit from
DJ Aphelion, who help runs Clandestine, to go and hang
out down there!=20=20

So the time finally came when Primo trekked up here
from SoCal & via public transportaion, I made the 3 1/2
hour voyage down 2 Johnny V in downtown SJ to finally
kick it @ Clandestine!!!  LoL

Wow... I had sooooo much fun there!!  It was a light
crowd that night (I was told), but man... the energy &
the vibe was So Dope!  Alota Groovy people were hangin'
out!!!  LoL.. saw hella people I ain't seen in 4ever
daze!!  LoL.. people were kinda shockled 2 C me down
there... LoL... Oh mY Goodness man... I finnaly hung
out w/ Proxy after heeeeeella long!!  LoL.. we had alot
2 talk about & stuff!!  YAY.. Love Proxy! =3D)

Totally kicked it w/ Aphelion after hella long also &
we had alooooot 2 talk about man!!  So Dope!!! =3D)

It was Rad 2 finally meet & hang out w/ Primo 'cause we
been like online Homies for a while now & he always
sends me CDs of his mixes & tracks he produces....
Primo is fukin' Sick man.. I swear.. & when this Dude
spun his set.. it was so Bad Ass!!!  He like totally
opened w/ this like 1/2 beat slowwer than Jungle tune
that totally pumped up the floor.. then BOOM.. he went
strait up w/ hella hard ass DNB like 2 minutes after
and kept it all the way through his set!!  It was
Sick... Loved it... totally Danced my Ass off!  It was
Groovy too 'cause like alota the hard tunes he played
had vocals & man... I was in Heaven!  Mondo Yum!  I
mean, Mondo bass/ tricky percussion driven tracks all
the way!

Before him was DJ ummm... Tommy Jeramy... Dope set
(well, he was on when I got there)... he was spinning
alota hard Jungle also in his set!!  It was sick 'cause
he was juggling @ one point during his set, then he
hella scratched alot, lol... he did 1 rewind... LoL...
Good Shit man... yeah, ummm, alot of his tracks were

the club, grab floor, and Groove right away... Dope

After Primo, Aphelion hopped on the decks for a whlie!!
 LoL... I wasn't even looking @ the DJ booth @ that
time, lol, but as soon as I heard some Dub come on... I

Subject: [sfraves] The "Lesbian Daughter" Card

Dick and Lynn Cheney slammed Kerry for mentioning their lesbian
daughter in the debate, calling it a "cheap shot". Isn't this much ado
about nothing?

Was it a political move to hurt Bush/Cheney? What's the point of
mentioning Cheney's lesbian daughter when just about everybody already
knew about it? Dick Cheney had made many public appearance with her
daughter in front of gay audiences, and he already admitted that he
disagrees with Bush's opinion on using consititutional amendment to
define marriage.

A right-wing religious voter would already know about all this, and
even if they really didn't know Cheney had a lesbian daughter, would
they instead vote for Kerry (who's pro-gay, pro-choice, supports
federal funding for abortion and against consitutional admendment on
marriage) because of it? Voters who believe being gay is not a shame
wouldn't find Kerry's comment inappropiate either -- it's not a shame,
and Dick Cheney has made his lesbian daughter more or less a visible
figure as anyone else in his family, so it's not an invasion of
privacy. So it doesn't matter how hard the Cheney family slams Kerry,
ultimately, the controversy itself won't even affect a single vote.

What I found particularly interesting is that Kerry was cold,
uncomfortable and almost shameful when he made that comment. This is a
striking contrast to Edwards' comments in the VP debate: he spoke of
Cheney's family in great deal of admiration and positivity, and Dick
Cheney returned a very warm "thank you".

Now why would a pro-gay Democratic senator from Massachusetts acted
the way he did when he said the word "lesiban"??? He knows the Cheney
family is very supportive of Mary, he knows being gay isn't a choice
and nothing to be ashamed of. It's all very "uncharacteristic" of him.

So it's in my opinion that he did it deliberately, to get a reaction.
When Edwards played it with respect, Cheney reacted in respect. When
Kerry played it with shame, Cheney reacted in shame. I really want to
believe it wasn't a calculated expression,  but I think Kerry
delivered the comment with some deliberation.

So what's the point of invoking a shameful reaction, when in reality
such reaction won't benefit Kerry among voters anyways?

What this deliberate "look of shame" generated is the Republican's
over-the-top reaction and focus on attacking Kerry's character, which
will probably go on for the next 2 weeks. Great for Kerry, because you
know how Karl Rove loves to use dirty tricks to attack his opponent's
character. And now Kerry somehow made the Republicans to focus their
ruthless personal attacks on Kerry on the basis of a comment revolve
around what they think is a dirty word -- "lesbian", rather than
something that would actually hurt him.

Brilliant.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] The "Lesbian Daughter" Card

The "Lesbian Daughter" card was indeed played well.. but perhaps we might 
assign too much credence to the Keery camp for playing it.. it was in fact a 
valid and forthright response to the constitutional amendment charge that 
defined marriage as a "right" between men and women, to the question of 
whether or not a gay person is to be defined by choice or nature.

The whole question was loaded to split the candidates futher apart, devide 
and concquer is the game now.. and it is disseminating from the media down.  
This is the real beast, for the democratic party is split amoung varying 
degrees of moderate and liberal views, while the republican party is holding 
the party line firmly.  If Kerry looses, it will be because the democrates 
have split their vote based on how far the division takes the democratic 
voters away from the moderate left.

This is the brilliant part.. and it is not in Kerry's favor.
Rove is an amazingly hateful mastermind indeed.

Anyone read the Vanity fair artical on the election 2000 smear campaigns?
This is super highly recommended reading***

Subject: [sfraves] The "Lesbian Daughter" Card
Date: Fri, 15 Oct 2004 05:23:00 -0700

Dick and Lynn Cheney slammed Kerry for mentioning their lesbian
daughter in the debate, calling it a "cheap shot". Isn't this much ado
about nothing?

Was it a political move to hurt Bush/Cheney? What's the point of
mentioning Cheney's lesbian daughter when just about everybody already
knew about it? Dick Cheney had made many public appearance with her
daughter in front of gay audiences, and he already admitted that he
disagrees with Bush's opinion on using consititutional amendment to
define marriage.

A right-wing religious voter would already know about all this, and
even if they really didn't know Cheney had a lesbian daughter, would
they instead vote for Kerry (who's pro-gay, pro-choice, supports
federal funding for abortion and against consitutional admendment on
marriage) because of it? Voters who believe being gay is not a shame
wouldn't find Kerry's comment inappropiate either -- it's not a shame,
and Dick Cheney has made his lesbian daughter more or less a visible
figure as anyone else in his family, so it's not an invasion of
privacy. So it doesn't matter how hard the Cheney family slams Kerry,
ultimately, the controversy itself won't even affect a single vote.

What I found particularly interesting is that Kerry was cold,
uncomfortable and almost shameful when he made that comment. This is a
striking contrast to Edwards' comments in the VP debate: he spoke of
Cheney's family in great deal of admiration and positivity, and Dick
Cheney returned a very warm "thank you".

Now why would a pro-gay Democratic senator from Massachusetts acted
the way he did when he said the word "lesiban"??? He knows the Cheney
family is very supportive of Mary, he knows being gay isn't a choice
and nothing to be ashamed of. It's all very "uncharacteristic" of him.

So it's in my opinion that he did it deliberately, to get a reaction.
When Edwards played it with respect, Cheney reacted in respect. When
Kerry played it with shame, Cheney reacted in shame. I really want to
believe it wasn't a calculated expression,  but I think Kerry
delivered the comment with some deliberation.

So what's the point of invoking a shameful reaction, when in reality
such reaction won't benefit Kerry among voters anyways?

What this deliberate "look of shame" generated is the Republican's
over-the-top reaction and focus on attacking Kerry's character, which
will probably go on for the next 2 weeks. Great for Kerry, because you
know how Karl Rove loves to use dirty tricks to attack his opponent's
character. And now Kerry somehow made the Republicans to focus their
ruthless personal attacks on Kerry on the basis of a comment revolve
around what they think is a dirty word -- "lesbian", rather than
something that would actually hurt him.

Brilliant.

"Take Your Clothes Off When You Dance."
Frank Zappa


There will come a time when everybody
Who is lonely will be free...
To sing & dance & love

There will come a time when every evil
That we know will be an evil...
That we can rise above

Who cares if hair is long or short
Or sprayed or partly grayed...
We know that hair ain't where it's at

(there will come a time when you won't
Even be ashamed if you are fat!)

Wah wah-wah wah

There will come a time when everybody
Who is lonely will be free...
To sing & dance & love (dance and love)

There will come a time when every evil
That we know will be an evil...
That we can rise above (rise above)

Who cares if you're so poor you can't afford
To buy a pair of mod a go-go stretch-elastic pants...
There will come a time when you can even
Take your clothes off when you dance
...

Funny, everyone always tells me to put my clothes back on when I
dance.  I aint gonna be buying no go-go stretch-elastic pants...but my
blue jeans are just as easy to take off.  Just taking the advice of
Billy Idol....I'm just Dancing with Myself!!!!

If, John Kerry mentioning Mary Cheney in a respectful, appropriate
manner in the context of answering a legitimate question makes him a
'bad man,' then doesn't this make Lynne Cheney a 'bad mother' and Dick
Cheney a 'bad father' for not acknowledging their daughter Mary until
it was politically expedient to do so?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] USDOJ Problem-Oriented Guides for Police Series: No. 14: Rave Parties

Dow (symbol: DJIA) Striking Distance Watch:

09/10/01 DJIA closing:   9,605.51
10/15/04 DJIA closing:   9,933.38

It's the economy, Wall Street.

<br>

In reading through this DOJ, (full disclosure, they're a present
client), document I picked up an interesting sub-text, which is though
the werd 'problem' is used throughout, the description of said
'problems' make them out to be practically non-existent from the point
of view of a street level, beat cop.

That practically leaps off the page.

I think any good cop, and they are still the majority of those that
protect us Citizens from each other, will see right through the BS,
not that, when push does come to shove, they aren't going to not do
their sworn jobs and uphold The Law.

Even one as odious as this.

It's going to be a long struggle, but I believe that we will
ultimately prevail, though it may take 20 years and at the end of it
the United States will no longer exist as we know it today.

This will be a good thing.

Wow!  This looks _really_ dangerous, everybody!  Quick, let's all get
rid of our cellphones; that'll prevent EM-induced cancer, right?=20
Unless we were to get it from our television, radio, CRT, cordless
phone, microwave, Wifi network, satellite TV, or any of the myriad
public safety, military, and commercial sources of radio and
microwaves that emit electro-magnetic radiation in quantities and
intensities far greater than what's being kicked out by your
cellphone...

Yay for America and it's system of inducing fear at every available moment.

BLAH.

I live, I do, I eat, I druink, I sometimes smoke, I say "fuck it" to cell
phone tumors and microwave cancer, and I could give two shits less about
anti-bacterial handsoap.

As it's sometimes said - "You only live once..."

I'm having a good time while I'm here.

This has generally been the case in my 11yr experience with the
SFPD. They are pretty laid back, compared with most of the other PDs
in the bay area, and don't seem to have a predilection to harass
people when there's not really a problem.

If you're well organized, have someone sober and competent to meet
the cops and offer to deal with things, there isn't teenage
drinking, and the situation doesn't look obviously unsafe, SFPD will
generally let you get on with it. Occasionally you'll get the cop
who's going to shut you down no matter what, and there's nothing you
can really do about that. But usually, they're pretty reasonable.

I've been at a party in Sausalito that was busted because people
were talking too loudly on a balcony in a private residence!
Perfectly safe, fun event. And the cops were complete assholes,
right to the core.

SF has it so easy that way. I love SF :) :) :).

DUB TRIBE SOUND SYSTEM Farewell TOUR
Sat October 23rd 9pm
Veterans building 846 Front St. Santa Cruz

Little John  & Strydah will be opening the show

  Now Then lets take a walk back in time to a  Friday night Come-Unity 
party in San Francisco in some
smoke filled club in 1994. Who are these wild haired freaks playing the 
dirtiest grooviest acid house and
breakbeat I had ever heard. No they were not playing records they were 
playing samplers, sequencers, keys
live percussion and singing about love, freedom, revolution, and Mother Earth.

  Well needless to say I was my doors were blown open, never to be shut 
again. It marked a new eara of music
and a turning point in my life.

  Their music was so inspirational, their message powerful, and the 
production top notch. Over the years I began
to know the people behind the music. And it made all that much more 
beautiful and powerful.

  I / We have been honored to host four Dub Tribe shows here in Santa Cruz 
over the years. The first of which was
supposed to be at our original location were we threw The Deep at the end 
of the pier in Santa Cruz ,but as a
twist of fate would have it, the party got moved at the last minute to a 
biker bar called Skinny Mcdoogles that no longer
exists.

  The next show was done proper, this was still The Deep but it was now 
home at Palookaville ,which also no longer exists.
Doc Martin was also on the bill, but could not attend due to an illness. So 
we had Carlos do the opening set,nobody complained
about Doc's absence.

   The third was up into San Lorenzo Valley at Don Quixote's in Felton. 
This was the most memorable for me. I don't know why but
they were on FIRE this night, and the crowd was full tilt vibration.

    The last time they were here  we were further up in the Valley At the 
Brookdale Lodge. On this tour they had a full production crew
sound, lighting, stage scene, huge disco ball, and a locker full of elves 
that set everything up for them. It seemed like they had moved
into a new phase and level of production.

Now fast forward to 2004. Sunshine and Moonbeam are the proud parents of a 
3 year old baby boy. They are ready to settle in and
let the next faze of their life unfold.

We are quite honored that Dub Tribe wants to do one of their final shows 
here in Santa Cruz. If you have not seen them in the past
this will be your one and only opportunity to catch these pioneers of 
conscious electronic dance music

"The government, which was designed for the people, has got into the hands 
of the bosses and their employers, the special interests.  An invisible 
empire has been set up above the forms of democracy."
-Woodrow Wilson

"There are times when you have to obey a call which is the highest of all, 
i.e. the voice of conscience even though such obedience may cost many a 
bitter tear, and even more, separation from friends, from family, from the 
state to which you may belong, from all that you have held as dear as life 
itself. For this obedience is the law of our being."
   Gandhi

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

Subject: Re: [sfraves] USDOJ Problem-Oriented Guides for Police Series: No. 14: Rave Parties

	SF cops damned sure ought to be cool. They have a good thing going on. 
When you make in the neighborhood of $70,000 a year from the taxpayers, 
plus overtime, plus generous pension and benefits, plus being hired at 
good rates for off-duty security work for clubs and events trying not 
to get shut down, plus presumably a bit of graft here and there in some 
cases, why rock the boat?

	It would sure be nice if they would uphold the law, as stated in the 
Constitution, the highest law of the land, but most of them, most of 
the time, will follow orders and do as their superiors instruct 
instead. That's true in SF as well as elsewhere, so I wouldn't say that 
the SF cops are good, I'd say that cops elsewhere are often even worse.

The problem that they have is why bring her daughter's personal life into a political debate.  I can understand why he did it, but the Cheney's feel that their daughter's personal life should not be brought up.
 
my 2 cents.

do the fucking math, Wall Street, and stop drinking that Kool-Aid, at
least for the month of October, it's costing everybody money.




If, John Kerry mentioning Mary Cheney in a respectful, appropriate
manner in the context of answering a legitimate question makes him a
'bad man,' then doesn't this make Lynne Cheney a 'bad mother' and Dick
Cheney a 'bad father' for not acknowledging their daughter Mary until
it was politically expedient to do so?

I'm just askin'.

<br>

I hear that, but you know what?

If these people, or anyone else wants to run my country, with my
permission, part of my vetting process is damn well going to be to see
just how well they treat their own.

That goes for everybody that wants to sit in the highest office in the
land, period.

Their treatment strikes me, and many, both gay and straight, as about
the shabbiest fucking thing you can do to your own flesh and blood.

No gay person I know picked that for themselves, that's who they are
as a person and the Cheney's argument takes on a lot of water pretty
quickly when you stop to consider that Mary Cheney is not in the
background, but is pulling down $100k to work for the Bush/Cheney
Team.

These people are so fucking **cheap** they can't even lay on a decent bribe.

Where was their outrage when fellow Republican Alan Keyes, who himself
has a bi/lesbian daughter,  fucking full on assaulted her by saying
she's "a 'selfish hedonist' because she is a lesbian," less than 2
months ago?

I didn't hear them stick up for her then, but oh, right, that would
have spoiled their lovely convention in New York City.

Jesus christ, don't you get it?

These people eat their own, with relish, and if that's how they treat
their family then I don't want them fucking running my country.

I can't make it any simpler than that, and i've only been a registered
Democrat for the last 7 days.

Thanks!

peace out motherfuckers,

nwa

ps: are you the same Amory that posts on Washington DC's craigslist?
If so, that's too cool that you're a raver and I promise i won't 'out'
you if you are, not my style.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] The "Lesbian Daughter" Card

But Dick Cheney brought the subject up himself throughout his entire 
campaign in 2000. Mary is out, Dick brought it to the public himself
previously.

And now it's "inappropiate" to bring up a fact about your opponent's
daughter? The opinion of whether it was "inappropiate" or not entirely
depends on whether you consider "lesbian" a dirty word or not.

What if the debate question was about disability instead of
homosexuality, and Mary were blind instead, and Kerry said...

"if you were to talk to Dick Cheney's daughter, who is blind..."

Would that have been "inappropiate"? Obviously not. But somehow "lesbian" is.



What the Cheneys are complaining is basically that:

1. It's our daughter to cash in on, not Kerry's

2. It was OK for us to cash in on her during the last campaign and
make it  public knowledge, when we pretended to be moderate,
conpassionate conservatives.

3. Now that we re-oriented to the far-right neoconservatives like we
really were in the first place, we consider her being a lesbian a
private issue

4. we can't even say the word "lesbian"

Ultimately, it still changes nothing. You can believe it was
"inappropiate" only if you think "lesbian" is a dirty word, or believe
it was a "privacy issue" only if you can overlook that they made it a
public knowledge during the last campaign and now try to bury it
because of ideological reasons. They can keep crying wolf about how
"insensitive" Kerry was, when in reality anyone who's sensitive about
gay rights at all would never touch the Bush Administration with a
10-foot pole, and woudn't consider "lesbian" a dirty word in the first
place.

The only thing Kerry's comment was insensitive about is the Bush
Administration's neo-conservative ideology.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] BSP:  DUB TRIBE SOUND SYSTEM Farewell TOUR

I used to live up in Boulder Creek back in those days.

Anyway are there any SF dates?  Between getting a
babysitter and driving to Santa Cruz this isn't doable
for us probably...

Peter

(I wrote this last night on the Rave Act and its general implications

cross-posting it here...thanks!)

What I love is the selective enforcement that the Rave Act affords
our Powers That Be....

The President whined about steroid abuse in major league sports this
past January in his State of the Union Address and I'm like that is
such horse-hockey, you already have the Rave Act on the books, why not
apply it to, oh, say, the owner of the San Francisco Giants, if it
turns out that Barry Bonds was enhancing his performance that way?

Oh, right, that would really fuck your,
sedate-the-masses-with-your-modern-day-version-of-Bread-&-Circuses,
shit up

Or, better yet, throw George Steinbrenner in a Federal Gulag for 10-20
years, take the day's gate money, the team, and lay a hefty fine on
his ass, if it
turns out that he may have been "knowing or having reason to know" and
reasonably aware that his players were trying to get an edge and
resorted to using illegal and banned substances to help them keep
their multi-million dollar jobs.

Actually, that one would make a lot of New York Yankee fans and New
York Yankee haters both pretty fucking happy.

All kidding aside, once a society starts passing laws like the Rave
Act it's only a matter of time until that society starts lining people
of an artistic temperment, such as are found in our rave community, up
against the wall and shooting them.

That is after they've werked their way through their mentally ill,
alcoholic, addicted, homeless, infirm, elderly & chronically ailing
and otherwise disabled.

In 1930's Germany people in those categories were called "useless
eaters," and they were eliminated from their society by degree long
before they got around to slaughtering the Jewish People.

The modern day US equivalent of such language that you hear daily
would be "homeless crackhead," "dirty hippy," "welfare queen," or it
'*costs* too much' to help that person.'

Phrases like that get bandied about every day here on the web and
elsewhere in the US.

The genocide of the Jewish people was just the tail-end of a long,
on-going process.

We've already seen a large percentage of the United States's mentally
ill population freeze to death in our streets over the course of the
last 20 years, so, being that we've kinda run out of them to kill in
cold blood, and we're still very hungry for more blood, to the point
of being insatiable, we're going to move on to the elderly and infirm
next, if the Medicare Bill that passed last year is any indication of
where all this shit is heading.

They took out the Gypsies, probably that society's closest equivalent
of us Ravers, before they exterminated Jews and if there is any truth
to "the US has morphed into Naszi Germany" meme, then this set of Rave
Act laws and bills seems to be right on time, going off of that
schedule.

Pretty grim sounding I know.

My grandfather was a Preacher and he & others saw it coming and tried
to do something about it, which nearly cost him his life, but he knew
Russian and they at the time needed him more than he needed them, so
instead of short visit to his friendly, local, nieghborhood Death
Camp, he got to go to the Eastern Front and help them figure out
Stalin was up to.

He got really lucky, and now, 75 years or so later, as his grandkid, i
see the same shit happening here and I'm nowhere near as gifted and
connected, (Thomas Mann was a personal friend and he translated the
werks of Kirkegaard into German), as he was, nor do I have a position
of respect in the community as he did, nobody's coming down to *my*
Church this weekend, (where's the damned 'recessive gene theory' when
you really need it, huh?), and I despair of being able to do anything
like he did to push back the tide.

It's fucking hard enough for me to being taken seriously in this
milieu, the closest thing the US has to a 'bohemian intelligentsia,'
you should see how well I do in mainstream American Society.

:P

On the other hand, it is encouraging that so many people here in the
States *are* speaking out in a way that they just weren't doing in
that by-gone era, so there is that.

The future is not written.

Biggest issue around the Rave Act that's already been stealth-passed
as a rider to the Amber Bill, a year ago April, is that while protests
and rallies such as ROAR have their heart in the right place, they
aren't going to do a damned thing to get that law overturned.

That time has passed as soon as Bush signed it into Law.

In order for that to happen, somebody has to get ARRESTED and then
challenge it up the chain and have the US Supreme Court throw it out
as Unconstitutional.

Who wants to go first?

My guess is is that now that it's on the books it's going to take a
minimum of 20 years for this law to get overturned and some bad shit
is going to happen in the meantime, if things keep going the way they
are.

This is not to say that we should not fight the impending passage of
these new bills with every full measure of energy and devotion that we
can collectively muster.

So do what ROAR suggests, and if you can afford it, throw a few bucks
their way to help them help you out.

Bill O'Reilly isn't looking out for you, but they are.

Who knows, if we keep our eye on the ball from this point on, we might
be able to push back and reverse this shit before it becomes too late
for all of us.

But keep your bags packed just in case, and keep a low profile otherwise

Better act soon, cuz if Bush get re-elected there'll be a whole new
bunch of neo-conservative justices sitting on the bench of the Supreme
Court, all cheerleading to a born-again, bible-thumping Attornel
General John Ashcroft.

And they'll be there for the rest of their fucking lives.... Or when
they feel like getting off. Whichever comes first.

And John Ashcroft will probably make mixed-sex dancing a felony by next year.

When you've got a major artery gushing blood you don't try to
reconstruct the entire area right then. You put a tourniquet on it.
John Kerry is that tourniquet.

They made the case for the following changes if Bush were to appoint
3 very conservative judges on the Supreme court:

-Abortion would be illegal in 30 states.
-States could use taxpayer money to spread Christian gospel
-Beating/abuse of prisoners would be legally tolerated

And a host of other changes to the law.  If Bush gets elected, it
won't just be 4 more years of Bush.  It will be a lifetime of laws
decreed by his conservative judicial appointments.

Just think what they would do to the rave scene, all you conservative
raver wanks out there...

KRS One Rebuttal To NY Daily News Article

Like everyone I was shocked to read that I and other African-Americans=20
actually "cheered when 911 happened" and that I have "declared my=20
solidarity with Al Qaeda". When I read my words taken out of context I was=
=20
shocked and disappointed that the Daily News would go this far to=20
assassinate my character and distort my views.

Such statements with no follow up explanation or interview from KRS-ONE as=
=20
to what he may have meant or even a complete quote of my point is simply=20
irresponsible journalism on the Daily News' part. I would never just say=20
something as crazy as "we cheered when 911 happened!" I was making an=20
objective point about how many Hiphoppas as well as the oppressed peoples=
=20
of the world felt that day.

I am a philosopher and a critical thinker, I speak truth and I urge people=
=20
to think critically about themselves and their environment. Yes, my words=
=20
are strong. Yes, my views are controversial. But to call me a terrorist is=
=20
simply wrong!

A young lady asked about what we can do beyond voting to change the=20
political state of things in our country? I responded not by irresponsibly=
=20
stating that "America has to commit suicide if the world is to be a better=
=20
place" and that's all. I am a poet and I speak poetically. My full=20
statement was "America has to commit suicide if the world is to be a=20
better place".

If you want to go beyond voting American interests must put a gun to its=20
head and commit suicide because as long as we are only interested in=20
American interests we go out and invade the rest of the world. The real=20
question is are you a citizen of the United States or are you a citizen of=
=20
the world? And so for me, I would say voting in a corrupt society adds=20
more corruption.

I was asked by the New Yorker magazine to discuss "different and personal=
=20
beliefs musicians hold and the contribution artists like myself can make=20
to the nation's political dialog". My views were indeed different and most=
=20
were personal. However, when I was asked about why Hiphop has not engaged=
=20
the current situation more (meaning 911) my responds was "because it does=
=20
not affect us, or at least we don't perceive that it effects us, 911=20
happened to them". I went on to say that "I am speaking for the culture=20
now; I am not speaking my personal opinion" I continued to say;" 911=20
effected them down the block; the rich, the powerful those that are=20
oppressing us as a culture. Sony, RCA or BMG, Universal, the radio=20
stations, Clear Channel, Viacom with BET and MTV, those are our oppressors=
=20
those are the people that we're trying to overcome in Hiphop everyday,=20
this is a daily thing. We cheered when 911 happened in New York and say=20
that proudly here. Because when we were down at the trade center we were=20
getting hit over the head by cops, told that we can't come in this=20
building, hustled down to the train station because of the way we dressed=
=20
and talked, and so on, we were racially profiled. So, when the planes hit=
=20
the building we were like; mmmm justice". And just as I began to say "now=
=20
of course a lot of our friends and family were lost there as well," but I=
=20
was interrupted.

My intent is never to demean or disrespect anyone's loss or gain; and of=20
course I did not literally "cheer when 911 happened". I made an objective=
=20
statement about the feelings of those who were oppressed by world trade=20
policies. I was just as saddened as everyone else on 911. However, for=20
many of us that were racially profiled and harassed by the World's Trade=20
Center's security and the police patrolling that area as well as the=20
thousands of American protesters that spoke out against the World Trade=20
Organization months before in Seattle, Washington there was a sense of=20
justice, a sense of change, a wake up call watching the twin towers fall.

These are not my views only; these views represent a popular truth that=20
few people are really ready to hear. No one wished death on anyone or just=
=20
sat and "cheered when 911 happened". But some of us can see through the=20
bullshit! America must change its approach to the world and its citizens.=
=20
This, I believe is what all Americans should be thinking about. How do we=
=20
make our country better?

For years my career has been one of promoting peace, love, unity and=20
having fun; such has always been Hiphop=92s cultural principles. So how all=
=20
of a sudden now can I be aligned with Al Qaeda? What happened to honest=20
debate and freedom of speech! I don't speak for the African American=20
community exclusively, I speak for HIPHOP! And let me be clear here; most=
=20
of the Hiphop community is against the war in Iraq! But to align me with=20
Al Qaeda is clearly an attempt by the Daily News to interrupt the street=20
voice of our Hiphop community, KRS-ONE's leadership and the increased=20
momentum of our Hiphop political movement.

I don't think Al Qaeda needs my solidarity nor did I ever offer it, so=20
what's the point. For a major news organization to now align KRS-ONE with=
=20
Al Qaeda shows the unwarranted contempt that such an organization has for=
=20
me. Such is grounds for a law suit!

Finally, no one should ever believe anything that the one-sided Daily News=
=20
has to say about the same Hiphop community that it (the Daily News) has=20
tried so desperately to undermine for years. The only thing the Daily News=
=20
seems to be interested in is scandal and controversy and for years I have=
=20
challenged the Daily News on its depictions of Rap artists and Hiphop as a=
=20
whole.

I know they don't like me. However, I don't give a ---- either! They never=
=20
cover our efforts toward peace and all the charitable work we do within=20
the Hiphop community. They never air our grievances or how we feel about=20
the state of the world, nor have they ever aired our views on America's=20
invasion of Iraq simply because they just don't want to hear them. The=20
Hiphop community forces America to look at itself; and no one likes to=20
take b.l.a.m.e. for their own for immaturity Because Looking At Me ain't=20
Easy!

For the record, I am an American philosopher. I speak and seek truth. If=20
the slander that the Daily News has printed regarding my political views=20
has disrespectfully offended anyone in any way I truly apologize. Again,=20
it was never my or Hiphop's intent to disregard, disrespect or demean the=
=20
tragedy of September 11th 2001 and those that died that day.

However, we do have a voice and a point of view and if you are not=20
prepared to hear what Hiphop has to say about its view of world events=20
then don't ask!

All the World's a Stage: Bringing Hip-Hop to the Theater




By Desiree Evans, WireTap
Posted on October 18, 2004, Printed on October 18, 2004


In the first act, the dancers' movements are slow, calculated. The lights 
focus in on the stage to highlight the sinuous muscles of the three men 
rising and turning in an avant-garde mix of movement over break beat. The 
textured lights follow a narrative of fluid motions that seem to mimic a 
ship at sea, a journey taken from break dancing to modern dance. The 
dancers, members of the Philadelphia-based 
<http://pennpat.org/artist_results.asp?id=149>olive Dance Theater, are 
performing a production of Olive, an original multimedia narrative. In this 
performance dance takes a fantastical journey through the art of b-boyin.'

When the lights come on, they shine on an audience that many may not 
consider your typical theater-going crowd. They are young (many are 
teenagers and under the age of 30) and primarily youth of color. After the 
show some gather outdoors in corners freestyling, while others comment on 
the performance.

Thus began the third Annual 
<http://www.hiphoptheaterfest.com/home.html>Hip-Hop Theater Festival in 
Washington, D.C. This festival, which was founded by 
<http://www.dannyhoch.com/>Danny Hoch, Kamilah Forbes and Clyde Valentin in 
New York in 2000 (then in in D.C three years ago and San Francisco last 
year), has evolved into the nation's most comprehensive and influential 
display of Hip-Hop aesthetics­showcasing solo and ensemble dance pieces and 
plays, as well as workshops and panels. According to critics, the 
festival's popularity with a younger crowd symbolizes Hip-Hop's movement 
from margin to center stage in contemporary theater.

Once a movement of the underground, "Hip-Hop Theater" has burst onto the 
stages of the mainstream, blurring the line between high and low cultur. As 
one of the organizations that has brought the movement to the forefront, 
the Hip-Hop Theater Festival's mission is to present and support live 
performances by artists who stretch, invent and combine a variety of 
theatrical forms, including dance, spoken word and live music sampling to 
express the diversity of the human experience through Hip-Hop culture. 
While supporting the production of Hip-Hop theater-based work, the festival 
also designs and implements programs that address the socio-political 
issues impacting their target audience­underserved urban youth spanning the 
ages of 12 to 35.

This year's artists mean business. Marc Bamuthi Joseph performs "Word 
Becomes Flesh," a series of performed letters to an unborn son in which he 
uses poetry, dance, live music and visual art to document nine months of 
pregnancy from a single father's perspective. This runs alongside 
<http://www.ayadeleon.com/>Aya de Leon's Hip-Hop feminist manifesto, 
"Thieves in the Temple." Her show is described as a battle cry for 
grassroots Hip-Hop consumers and creators, particularly women. Tackling 
similar, complex issues is Chad Boseman, the director of "Deep Azure," a 
play that addresses the concepts of abuse, brutality and redemption.

Then there's Full Circle Productions, a nonprofit entertainment company 
that graces the stage utilizing DJing, breakin', MCing, spoken word and 
dance, all infused in Latino and African American youth culture. Its 
founders, who worked their way from the outdoor performances of street 
shows, now reach large audiences touring internationally at festivals like 
this one.

Full Circle's artistic director, Gabriel "Kwikstep" Dionisio, says that not 
much has changed in how they approach their shows. "We're just street 
performing to stage," he says, adding that he was trained in an art that 
has been passed down through generations. "The social exchange is a village 
experience," says Kwikstep. "[You] go into cipher or circle and learn it."

Redefining Aesthetics

These Artists see Hip-Hop Theater as being at the center of a global youth 
culture. But this generation is not alone in calling for an aesthetics that 
encompasses their experience. When Danny Hoch called for "theater that is 
by, for, and about the Hip-Hop generation" he echoed the words of W.E.B. 
Dubois, who called for "theater by, for, about and near" African Americans 
in the 1920s. The revolutionary aesthetics of the Black Arts Movement (the 
artistic arm of the 60s Black Power Movement) created artistic work that 
took on the struggle for socioeconomic, racial, gender and sexual equality 
(inspiring artists such as Amiri Baraka, Sonia Sanchez, the Last Poets and 
Ntozake Shange). Many of these movements were in tangent with cultural and 
musical revolutions (August Wilson's plays were informed by the blues and 
Ntozake Shange's work was informed by jazz).

"We are not reinventing the wheel. Just look at our history," says Daniel 
Banks, a New York University drama professor who helped to create the 
educational parts of the Hip-hop Theater Festival.

The rituals today known as Hip-Hop were birthed in the post-60s climate of 
New York's inner city neighborhoods, sprouting from the lives of the people 
who lived there. A collage of art forms­graffiti, emceeing, break dancing, 
turntablism­reclaimed public spaces by turning inner city walls into art 
galleries, street corners and parks into dance clubs, and turntables into 
technological inversion as symphonic as any saxophone.

Hip-Hop Theater was shaped on the streets and then nurtured in community 
performing arts centers and on college campuses, outside of the modes of 
mainstream funders and foundations like the National Endowment for the 
Arts. But is goes back even further than that.

"We are rooted in music and are practitioners of an ancient tradition," 
says performer Marc Bamuthi Joseph.

The use of Hip-Hop aesthetics continues to define this cultural continuum. 
"[Hip-Hop] is just this generation's relation to sound­Black people and the 
drum. [We] move from sound to rhythm to text," says Joseph. "We move, 
speak, dance in folkloric traditions We are folkloric traditionsour art is 
interdisciplinary, a mythological method."

Playwright and actor Chad Boseman sees Hip-Hop Theater as ritual, as well. 
"We are taking it back to what it was in the beginning­a ritual, a 
reenacting of what is in front of you, a myth happening," Boseman says. He 
adds that you can't box Hip-Hop in because "when you do that it is no 
longer Hip-Hop."

"If our art is not evolving us, then it's oppressing us," Boseman 
maintains. "When an emcee is on stage, some people say its not theater. But 
it is. It's just not Western. We are griots; we are reclaiming this [art] 
in our indigenous forms. We want to take theater beyond what people 
normally see."

U.K.-based artist Benji Reid calls the work he does in Hip-Hop Theater the 
marriage between "movement and language and the power of storytelling." 
Reid tries to use the language of breakin' to signify emotion and to speak. 
"It is about how to tell stories of all the suffering in a new context to 
tell stories of suicide, redemption, rites of passage," Reid says.

"Hip-Hop Theater is the prose of Hip-Hop," says performer Aya de Leon. 
"Some of us have craved to tell the longer story. The stories of people 
trying to transform their circumstances."

De Leon also points out that women have a strong presence in Hip-Hop 
Theater, if not in other elements of Hip-Hop. But the combination of the 
two (Hip hop and theater) has created new spaces for women. "I felt like I 
was coming in the backdoor of Hip-Hop," she says.

She underscores that her work is about reexamining Hip-Hop. "I grew up on 
Hip-Hop and it's my voice. So now I can reclaim my voice and look at how 
sexism plays a role in discouraging voice," she says. She wants to be an 
example of Hip-Hop Theater for a new generation of women coming up. "There 
is a demand for women's voices not being filled in other media Hip-Hop 
Theater is a place for this."

Performing a Generation

The idea to call it "Hip-Hop Theater" came about in 1999, at the National 
Black Theater Festival in Winston-Salem, NC. Since then, these festivals 
have reached out to nontraditional theater audiences, such as young people 
who may not identify with the world of theater, but who do identity with 
Hip-Hop.

Kamilah Forbes, the festival's artistic director, sees the art form as an 
evolution of our generation speaking in a way they need to speak. "There is 
always contention about what Hip-Hop Theater is. It has an energy, a 
spirit, something transcendent," she says. The actress, director and 
playwright, adds that Hip-Hop Theater is "a growing aesthetic, defining and 
developing itself."

Although Hip-Hop Theater can trace its origins to the do-it-yourself 
mentality of this generation, its influence has hit the mainstream 
recently, winding its way into a steady flow of Broadway and off-Broadway 
productions. (Think of Sean "P. Diddy" Combs playing Walter Lee Younger in 
A Raisin in the Sun, Regina Taylor's Drowning Crow and MC/actor Mos Def in 
Suzan-Lori Parks's Pulitzer-winning Topdog/Underdog). Much of today's 
Hip-Hop Theater can find its origins in the spoken word movement that 
rocked coffee houses in the late 1990s. Russell Simmons' Tony-award winning 
Def Poetry Jam is one such influence. Spoken word champion and "Hip-Hop 
poet" Reg E. Gaines also introduced the Hip-Hop aesthetic to a vast 
mainstream audience in the early '90s when he penned the poetic phrases 
behind the Broadway hit, "Bring in da Noise, Bring in da Funk."

Hip-Hop theater artists often bring underrepresented voices to the stage, 
such as Danny Hoch (whose Jails, Hospitals and Hip-Hop combines 
beat-boxing, deejaying, spoken-word poetry and rap to tell the stories of 
multiple characters living in the inner-city) and Hanifah Walidah (whose 
"Straight Black Folks' Guide to Gay Black Folks" tackles sexuality in the 
Black community). Other artists make their impact in choreography, like 
Jonzi D and Rennie Harris (Puremovement of Philadelphia); in ensembles, 
such as Universes and I Was Born With Two Tongues; in solo acts, such as 
Danny Hoch, Sarah Jones, Will Power, Caridad de la Luz, Marc Bamuthi 
Joseph, Liza Colon-Zayas, Teo Castellanos and Mariposa; and in playwriting, 
like Ben Snyder, Kris Diaz, Eisa Davis, Chad Boseman, Candido Tirado and 
Kamilah Forbes.

"Harlem Renaissance writer James Weldon Johnson once said that history 
judges a race by the quality of its literature and art. If jazz and 
modernism are the formal legacies of his generation, Hip-Hop may be one of 
the formal legacies of ours. Content may never change, stories always stay 
the same, but new forms alter consciousness, actually change the way we 
imagine ourselves," playwright Eisa Davis said in an article for the 
Theater Communications Group.

Indeed, this generation of artists is a generation much like Hip-Hop itself 
­ one that reshapes, reflects and remixes the past and innovates toward the 
future. It is a generation that finds its voice in a variety of 
languages­visual, music, dance and poetry.

Kwikstep says Hip-Hop Theater is a start, but there will be a day to "just 
let go... it will not be Hip-Hop Theater anymore just theater."

Subject: [sfraves] Israel decriminalises ecstasy

Since drug war (in any country) should be important, and this is a 
club/rave drug.  I thought some of you might be interested.

-maz


http://www.inthemix.com.au/news/intl/18011/

Israel.s Justice Ministry announced this week that people caught in
possession of up to five ecstasy pills will no longer face prosecution,
and explained that the change is .a case of adapting legislation to meet
reality. (Ha'aretz, Jerusalem).

However, the Ministry stressed that possession of even one pill will still
be technically a crime and explained the new category of .personal use. is
designed to distinguished between users and suppliers.

The change coincided with the publication of a report in the UK by leading
civil liberties organisation Transform which predicted that all drugs will
be legalised in the UK by 2020.

"Drugs will be legalised in the not too distant future because prohibition
is an ongoing catastrophe Click Here of startling proportions," Transform
director Danny Kushlick said as he unveiled the report, titled .After the
War on Drugs, Options for Control', at a presentation at Britain.s Houses
Of Parliament.

"We need to consider more effective, just and humane options," he
continued. "In the UK, the prison population and property crime would be
halved, drug related prostitution would end, opportunities for organised
crime would reduce substantially, prohibition related corruption would
disappear and drug turf wars would end," he said.

The .drug policy road map report. was immediately dismissed by British
Home Office officials though was endorsed by a number of MPs and
influential Brits including former Times editor Simon Jenkins.

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) Libertarian Party of San Francisco recommendations on local candidates & ballot measures

U.S. Representative, district 8: no recommendation.  There is no
Libertarian candidate in this race, though Republican Jennifer DePalma
sought our recommendation.  While there was wide feeling that her 
positions
on most economic and social issues were good, her support for the U.S.
military action in Iraq was considered unacceptable.  (DePalma: 2 
votes; no
recommendation: 8 votes.)

U.S. Representative, district 12: Libertarian candidate Harland Harrison
(unanimous endorsement).  Harland is a Libertarian activist for peace,
human rights, and civil liberties.  His top priorities in Congress 
include
ending the war in Iraq and bringing the troops home, dismantling the USA
PATRIOT Act, and reducing spending to balance the federal budget every 
year.

State Senate, district 3: Libertarian candidate David Rhodes (unanimous
endorsement).  Dave has been an active member of the Libertarian Party 
for
several years.  His top priorities are to reduce regulations on small
businesses, end the War on Drugs, and to balance the state budget.

State Assembly, district 12: Libertarian candidate Chris Maden 
(unanimous
endorsement).  A ten-year member of the Libertarian Party, and currently
Chair of the San Francisco party, Chris's top priorities in Sacramento 
are
a dollar-for-dollar tax credit to shift charity from a government 
function
to personal and community activity, and returning state government to 
the
hands of a part-time legislature.

State Assembly, district 13: Libertarian candidate Jonathan Scott Marvin
(unanimous endorsement).  Jonathan would work to decentralize state
government, move funding for state projects from taxation to fees, and
introduce tax cuts starting with the lowest tax brackets.

Board of Supervisors, district 5: Jim Siegel (recommendation).  In the
heart of San Francisco's so-called "progressive" district 5, there is 
one
candidate who understands that government is the enemy of progress.  
While
not completely libertarian, Jim, a small business owner and landlord, 
would
work to reduce government interference with property ownership and 
business
operation.  The chief reservation was with his fondness for using
historical preservation laws to save neighborhood character; however, he
also understands private approaches to preservation, and notably raised
private money to save the former site of the libertarian bookstore at 
1800
Market, now part of the LGBT Community Center.  (Siegel: 7 votes; none 
of
the above: 1 vote; no recommendation: 1 vote.)

[There was no recommendation for any other supervisory district, nor for
any other candidates in district 5.]

Board of Education: Libertarian candidate Starchild (unanimous
endorsement).  Starchild is perhaps the most well-known ambassador of
Libertarianism in San Francisco.  While we believe that the government
should not be in the education business, Starchild has an innovative
proposal to decentralize the school district's management and spark
competition between schools.  This should raise the quality of the
government schools and reduce the cost, while setting the stage for
conversion to a free-market educational system.

[There were no recommendations for any other Board of Education 
candidates,
nor for any Community College Board candidates.]

Proposition A: NO (unanimous recommendation).  Proposition A is a $200
million bond issue for building and renovating "affordable housing".  
Every
property tax increase worsens the housing situation in San
Francisco.  Imposing such a tax to help the housing situation is
oxymoronic; housing needs will be better served by reducing taxation and
regulation.

Proposition B: NO (unanimous recommendation).  Proposition B is a $60
million bond issue for protecting city-owned historical resources.  If 
the
resources are worth protecting, a fund-raising drive is the appropriate
means of restoring them; private foundations do very good work at this 
kind
of job.  In contrast, government tends to do a very poor job, and
Proposition B contains no guarantees as to which sites will get the 
money
from the bonds.

Proposition C: NO.  Proposition C sets up a separate City department to 
run
the Health Service System, taking it out of the hands of the Human
Resources Department.  This is essentially a change to enable extension 
of
City health benefits to city residents (Proposition G), which we also
oppose.  Growing the bureaucracy is bad, especially when it's to enable 
a
worse cause.  (NO: 7 votes; no recommendation: 3 votes.)

Proposition D: NO (unanimous recommendation).  Proposition D makes a 
number
of changes to the Board of Supervisors' operational rules, and also 
removes
the fixed number of aides each Supervisor may employ.  This is a Trojan
horse: the Supervisors constantly complain about having too much work to
do, and rather than run our lives less, they are certain to hire more 
staff
as soon as they are allowed.  Passage of this measure is sure to 
increase
the cost of City government.

Proposition E: NO (unanimous recommendation).  Proposition E increases 
the
survivor benefits for police officers or firefighters who die in the 
line
of duty.  The benefits were reduced effective in 1976, and any employee
hired since then has agreed to the current terms.  The middle of a 
budget
crisis is not the time to raise them back again.

Proposition F: YES.  Proposition F extends the right to vote for Board 
of
Education elections to non-citizen residents with children in the school
system.  Some felt that citizenship is not too high a hurdle to require;
others felt that the measure does not go far enough (non-citizen 
taxpayers
who fund the schools will have no say over the board).  But overall, it 
is
a step in the right direction.  (YES: 7 votes; NO: 1 vote; no
recommendation: 4 votes.)

Proposition G: NO (unanimous recommendation).  Proposition G would 
extend
the medical and dental plan currently administered by the City for its
employees and their dependents to all interested city residents.  The 
City
is not an insurance company and should not pretend to be one.

Proposition H: NO.  Proposition H would officially name Candlestick Park
and prevent the city from selling naming rights.  While Libertarians 
would
prefer that the city not run a sports stadium at all, hamstringing its
ability to make money is just senseless, especially during a budget
crisis.  (NO: 11 votes; no recommendation: 2 votes.)

Proposition I: NO.  Proposition I would require the Controller to 
produce
an economic analysis of proposed legislation as well as a long-term
Economic Development Plan.  While we support the principle of an 
economic
watchdog, creating yet another government agency to perform that 
function
is a case of the foxes watching the henhouse.  (NO: 9 votes; YES: 1 
vote.)

Proposition J: NO (unanimous recommendation).  Proposition J would raise
sales taxes to provide funding for a budget that assumes it will be
there.  The budget should be balanced by cutting spending back to
pre-dot-com days, not by raising taxes on an already-damaged economy.

Proposition K: NO (unanimous recommendation).  Proposition K would 
impose a
gross receipts tax on local businesses.  As with Proposition J, this is 
to
provide revenue already assumed in the current budget, which is 
dishonest
and poor budgeting.  Further, gross receipts taxes particularly punish
low-margin high-volume businesses like supermarkets, and would be 
imposed
on top of the payroll tax already in place.  San Francisco will never
thrive until it stops punishing businesses for locating here.

Proposition L: NO.  Proposition L allocates some of the 
currently-collected
hotel tax money to restore and preserve single-screen movie theaters.  
This
is so far from a legitimate function of government as to leave one 
stunned;
worse, it is narrowly tailored so that the allocated money can only go 
to a
non-profit organization established by the measure's sponsors.  (NO: 12
votes; no recommendation: 1 vote.)

[Proposition M was stricken from the ballot.]

Proposition N: YES.  Proposition N is a statement, on behalf of the 
City,
that the U.S. military action in Iraq should be ended.  While it is not
clear what exactly the measure will accomplish that hundreds of 
thousands
marching in the street did not, since it is on the ballot, it should be
passed.  (YES: 9 votes; no recommendation: 1 vote.)

Proposition O: NO.  Proposition O allocates the sales tax revenue that
would be collected if Proposition J passes.  As we oppose Proposition 
J, we
hope that Proposition O will be moot, but earmarking revenue by ballot
measures is a bad practice that tends to lead to future budget crises 
and
tax increases.  (NO: 9 votes; no recommendation: 4 votes.)

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: Hugger-Mugger Tonight!

Sorry for the short notice folks... one of my guests cancelled on me at
the last minute and I've been trying to find a replacement all day. I
haven't found anyone, so my only guest for tonight is my friend Dres,
who shares my penchant for strange minimal techno and will be bringing
the bizarre beats from 10-11-ish. The rest of the night will be a
resident free-for-all featuring:

AndyW
Clairity
Forest Green
Li
Juan Segovia
and Shazbot

Hugger-Mugger takes place every Tuesday night from 9-2am at the Lit
Lounge, 6th & Mission in San Francisco. More info here:

<http://tech-on.com/huggermugger.html>

Although we like to call Hugger-Mugger a "techno" weekly, it's really
much more than that. We're constantly on the hunt for talented guests,
searching for local music afficionados with unique tastes. Techno is all
well and good, but there's a lot going on in other electronic music
circles: electro, (don't-call-it) IDM, breaks, drum and bass, abstract
hip-hop, dub and house all continue to evolve, often borrowing stylistic
cues from each other to create new sub-genres and distinct sounds. As
much as we'd like to stay on top of everything, it's just not possible.
Musical diversity makes our community stronger, and that's why we need
to bring in guests and give them the exposure they deserve.

So if you that sounds like something that you might want to be a part
of, come on by tonight with a CD and say hi. Even if you're not a DJ,
come down and have a drink. At the very least, you'll get a sneak peek
into what some of us are going to be throwing down at the OtherWorld
next weekend. :)

Cheers,

Hacker Hits California University Computer

2 hours, 36 minutes ago

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A computer hacker accessed names and Social 
Security 
(<http://us.rd.yahoo.com/DailyNews/manual/*http://news.search.yahoo.com/search/news?fr=news-storylinks&p=%22Social%20Security%22&c=&n=20&yn=c&c=news&cs=nw>news 
- 
<http://us.rd.yahoo.com/DailyNews/manual/*http://search.yahoo.com/search?fr=web-storylinks&p=Social%20Security>web 
sites) numbers of about 1.4 million Californians after breaking into a 
University of California, Berkeley, computer system in perhaps the worst 
attack of its kind ever suffered by the school, officials said on Tuesday.

"The investigation is continuing but we have no idea if the (personal) 
information has been compromised," said Carlos Ramos, assistant secretary 
at the California Health and Human Services 
(<http://us.rd.yahoo.com/DailyNews/manual/*http://news.search.yahoo.com/search/news?fr=news-storylinks&p=%22Health%20and%20Human%0AServices%22&c=&n=20&yn=c&c=news&cs=nw>news 
- 
<http://us.rd.yahoo.com/DailyNews/manual/*http://search.yahoo.com/search?fr=web-storylinks&p=Health%20and%20Human%20Services>web 
sites) Agency.

He said state agencies and the Federal Bureau of Investigation were 
investigating but the hacker had not been found.

The names accessed by the hacker were being used by a UC Berkeley 
researcher who had collected data on elderly people and individuals who 
provide in-home care to seniors to study the impact of wages on in-home 
care, Ramos said.

The data, which included home addresses, telephone numbers and dates of 
birth, was being used at the state's authorization but without the consent 
of the individuals whose information was being used in the study.

Ramos said the state is authorized to share with researchers the personal 
information of individuals who participate in state programs administered 
by the state social services department.

George Strait, a university spokesman, confirmed the school's computer 
system had been penetrated in what he believed was the most significant 
hacking job the university had experienced.

The university detected its computer system had been broken into at the end 
of August, but did not notify the state until Sept. 27 after the school had 
done its own investigation with the FBI 
(<http://us.rd.yahoo.com/DailyNews/manual/*http://news.search.yahoo.com/search/news?fr=news-storylinks&p=%22FBI%22&c=&n=20&yn=c&c=news&cs=nw>news

umm, my gut tells me that this is purely an economic, if not cynical
decision on their part, if memory serves Isreal was one of the major
black-market suppliers after the Dutch in Amsterdam and they're prolly
not wanting to chase after the small fry.

but you know what?

I'll take any chink in a the armor at this point.

yeah, I agree with you, and I guess it's a wise
policy.  I was just interjecting [politics].    I
don't hear much about Israel & Palestine anymore--  I
wonder what's up.

whubba?  whatchoo talkin bout, nwa420?  I'm not sure
what you mean-- what's the armor and what's the chink?

Whoosh was an intimate (and intense) psychedelic party
that happened in an old anarchist bookstore, tucked
away in a derelict part of East London. Starting in
'89 and ending in '91, it wasn't a "rave", but instead
followed in the wake of the once vibrant and eclectic
warehouse party scene in North and East London that
had been pretty much destroyed by the arrival of "acid
house" and the resulting attention it received from
the authorities determined to stamp it out.
Fortunately the bookstore was off the beaten path and
therefore far enough away from the drama and busts
that were plaguing much of the London party scene at
the time. Not having to worry about get shut down
allowed us to have a night where rules were few and
far between and the atmosphere was very free and
hedonistic..

What also made it special was the mix of friends and
other eccentric characters who'd make it out to East
London to share the night with us. In fact if it
hadn't been for the help and support of people like Al
and Trish (of Wicked), the North London Posse, the
Brixton Posse, and also Greg Smith (now of Ultra
Magnetic) who brought the Turbo speakers, it would
never have been quite so memorable.

Jeno, Markie, Bones, Para, Ron Aslan, and other
occasional guests would throw down a heartfelt mix of
soulful grooves, acidic beats and other left field
musical treats. While Markie would blow minds with his
occasional 3 turntable mix-madness, some other dj's
didn't really mix at all. Often it just worked better
that way..

Although some of us worked with and/or were regulars
at the now legendary Tonka parties, the Whoosh parties
were quite separate, Markie being the only dj who
played at both. After helping Tonka get going and
throwing their first parties in London I realized I
wasn't going in the same direction they were taking,
and looked for creative outlets elsewhere, ending up
in the basement of the bookstore. The influence of the
Whoosh parties has never really been written about,
but it's where many of the ideas that we brought to SF
were fermented, and it's where many of the roots of
the Wicked party lie..

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Important for California voters

You have the right to ask your election official, in your balloting
location, for a paper ballot instead of using a Diebold machine.  This
is California law, and a very good idea.  I suggest all of you do so!

See the bottom of:
  http://www.ss.ca.gov/elections/elections_w.htm

"In response to concerns about the security of touchscreen/DRE voting
systems, the Secretary of States office has required these systems to
meet 23 additional security measures before these systems can be used
in the November election. These additional security measures require:

That every voter be given the option of casting a paper ballot. If
you would prefer to use a paper ballot instead of a touchscreen/DRE,
you may request one when you sign in at the polls."

House Music 101:  http://livingart.com/raving/articles/housemusic101.htm


"The government, which was designed for the people, has got into the hands 
of the bosses and their employers, the special interests.  An invisible 
empire has been set up above the forms of democracy."
-Woodrow Wilson

"There are times when you have to obey a call which is the highest of all, 
i.e. the voice of conscience even though such obedience may cost many a 
bitter tear, and even more, separation from friends, from family, from the 
state to which you may belong, from all that you have held as dear as life 
itself. For this obedience is the law of our being."
   Gandhi

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

Subject: Re: [sfraves] News: KRS One Rebuttal To NY Daily News Article

If they want to talk about defiling the memory of those that died that
day, I'd say, rich, white, (mostly), greedy, venal Wall Street Traders
who went  short when the market re-opened a week later is a much
better place to start making accusations like that than jumping on
some rapper like KRS-One.

Please.

I cover that issue here: 

http://apenwarmedinhell.blogspot.com/

btw, much is made that Dubya panders to 'the base,' right?

Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't Al-Qaeda mean 'the base' as well?

Don't know if that means anything, but it does strike me as an odd coincidence.

nwa

ps: here's a case of 9:11 being a very good thing indeed:

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Terry,Brian,or.Karina....What's-wrong-w/-achieves?

nice werk-around the space bar issue, osby.=20

i use the period.......trick too if i'm composing a web page that
won't let me use more than one blank space.....between letters, then I
change the text color of the periods to white so the periods become
invisible.

umm i think the archives are all zipped in some way so google's or
other search engines spiders can't read them so easily, Brian thought
of this long before google existed, which is why he's our fearless
leader and all

i'm on a linux box here and the last time i  cracked an sfraves
archive file i was on a windows box but that was a long time ago and I
forgot how I did it, but i'm sure you can figure it out from here or
someone else can help you over the part you're having issues with.

The law enforcement agencies that participated in Operation Rave Review=20

Subject: Re: [sfraves] DJ Rap's Gear Stolen!!! Need Help! 

I met DJ Rap when she spun at a party at Studio 54.  I
didn't realize who she was actually, until after she
had to run to the bathroom during her "pee record."  I
complemented her on her spinnign and then felt like a
doofus afterwards.  We were nominated for a Yahoo
Internet Life award and I was there to accept if we
won which unfortuantely we didn't. I was supposed to
be seated next to David Bowie actually, but he never
sat in his seat.  Martha Stewart was two seats over on
the other side, but she left after Amy Mann played.  
And Rick James spilled a cocktail on my partner at the
pre-party.  Ha ha!

DJ Rap got us into BT's gig at the Bowery Ballroom the
next night for free where she was opening.  That was
the night that our friend David P. was so drunk he
jumped out of a moving taxi cab in the middle of
Manhattan to walk off the spins for the second night
in a row.  Hey Dave you don't *HAVE* to drink those
free drinks at industry events...

DJ Rap is one of the niceest people I've met in the
dance music business and I really hope she gets her
gear back.

Peace,

Peter

Unless you can prove it, you've just seriously libeled Atchley.

This made me want to say something. I take pics of light shows at parties. I 
take them 'cause they look cool, and people might want to see the pics when i 
post them. Normally, you can't see who's doing the light show in the pics, 
just the lights. However, if anybody feels uncomfortable being photographed, 
please tell me and I'll delete the picture right then. 

Also, sometimes people look f'd up in pics. Could just be because they 
blinked, and the half-closed eye makes them look wasted.  I avoid posting pics in 
which I think people look bad. I use red-eye correction to help. People can ask 
to see the pic after I take it, and zoom it in to see how they look. I'll 
delete it if they want. 

I take pics and post them so people who went to a party can have something to 
remember it by ... and so people who wanted to go can see what they missed. I 
would feel terrible if the pics were being used as evidence of illegal 
activity. 

That DOJ page is just SO morally wrong ... receipts for purchasing water are 
evidence of illegal activity? Emergency room and EMS records? fuck!!!!  

People have issues with cops all over the place, but at least in San 
Francisco, thanks to the SF Late Night Coalition and others, cops can't use 911 
emergency calls as evidence to shut clubs down. I've seen cops come into a party 
looking mainly for underage drinking and not hassle people over anything else ... 
maybe sometimes looking for people under 18 at an 18+ party  ... but not this 
knee-jerk attitude that the party is all wrong, every time.

This leads to a broader issue of posting pictures from private
parties without permission. This is probably breach of privacy. But
everyone is doing it, and most of the people photographed don't care
or like them available., so it isn't usually a problem.

I have seen sites which seem to be about publishing pictures of
women looking sexy at raves. This seems exploitive to me.

I've struggled in dealing with this issue as well.  I've found it rather 
difficult to ask and/or beg people to leave their cameras and recorders 
at home.  Without fail, every time I make such a request on a BSP a 
flood of complaints is almost always guaranteed to follow.  I've had 
some success providing one on one directions/requests with people before 
they get to the party, but even then you get those people that have a 
hard time listening.  Next to cavity searches and kicking people out 
caught with them (both of which I frown upon), I have yet to have come 
up with some sort of solution.
I've seen first hand police and news agencies come into parties take 
pictures, pick up fliers and shoot video only later to see it pop up 
overly exaggerated on the news or in printed anti-rave literature.  I 
understand that drug use and certain drinking situations are against the 
law - but more often then not such material ends up being being used as 
propaganda or shady law enforcement tactics.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] RR News: Another USDOJ page (archive) & rave pics

I find this paragraph interesting for obvious reasons...

"Members of private drug education and drug testing organizations, called 
"harm reduction organizations," have appeared at raves over the past 10 
years. They attend rave events to test samples of illegal drugs so they can 
inform ravers of purity levels. Members of these organizations believe that 
they help reduce the number of overdoses by educating users on the physical 
effects of specific drugs. Conversely, many law enforcement agencies believe 
that the practices of harm reduction organizations encourage drug use, and 
they support their position with national statistics that show an increase 
in club drug overdoses as harm reduction organizations have become more 
active. "

Why do I find that last sentence the biggest cop out in history?

Not only can you truly draw no correlation between HR groups and drug OD's.. 
but since law enforcement themselves usually are the ones fighting to KEEP 
HR orgs out of parties..  isnt the evidence inherantly flawed anyway?

Next DOJ thing will probably read "Many fire fighting agencies believe that 
the practices of the boy scouts encourage forest fires, and they support 
their position with national statistics that show an increase in fires 
starting near camping areas as Boy Scout Troops have become more active"

THE WAR ON RAVES

Forget Terrorists; Let's Fight The Dancers

You can dance if you want to -- well, no, you can't The government doesn't 
want you to dance.  Actually, the government doesn't want you to take 
drugs, and it thinks that getting you to stop dancing -- or buying plastic 
tubes of neon to wave in the air -- will cut down on your drug intake. 
Nothing, and I mean nothing, should ever stop you from exercising your 
right to wave a glow stick.  It's right there in the Constitution, sort 
of.

Let's backtrack a bit.  Last year, the Department of Justice sent out a 
painfully funny memo ( found at 
usdoj.gov/ndic/pubs/656">www.usdoj.gov/ndic/pubs/656 ) to law enforcement 
bodies throughout the country about raves and "club drugs." Among other 
incorrect assumptions, the missive suggested that rave organizers were 
condoning drug usage by providing free water, allowing on-site testing of 
Ecstasy purity, and making party fliers that emphasize the letter "e," 
which we all know spells trouble ( or at least helps spell it ).

But the least amusing part of the memo concerned a "methodology for the 
potential prosecution of rave promoters who [allow] open, unabated drug 
use." The bulletin explained how certain prosecutors were shutting down 
nightclubs by using a 1986 law designed to rid cities of crack houses. 
This statute says that any building manager with knowledge of drug use on 
the premises can be sent to prison for up to 20 years and/or fined 
$500,000.  In other words, if one guy's doing Ecstasy at a rave, the 
organizer of the party can be held responsible.  If this law had been in 
effect in the '60s, Bill Graham would've been up shit creek.

In 2001, federal prosecutors used the "crack house" law to arrest the 
owners of two dance clubs -- Club La Vela in Tallahassee and the State 
Palace Theater in New Orleans.  Neither case stuck: In Tallahassee the 
jury returned a not guilty verdict in only 75 minutes, while in New 
Orleans the feds merely got a plea bargain, which stipulated that glow 
sticks, pacifiers, and face masks would be forbidden in the State Palace 
Theater.  But the American Civil Liberties Union appealed the Louisiana 
case, and in February of this year, in what the ACLU called "a major 
victory" for free speech, U.S.  District Judge G.  Thomas Porteous ruled 
that "the government cannot ban inherently legal objects that are used in 
expressive communication because a few people use the same legal item to 
enhance the effects of an illegal substance."

But don't lace up your dancing shoes just yet.  Recently, federal 
lawmakers sneaked a little provision into the proposed bill HR 3782, the 
so-called "CLEAN-UP of Methamphetamines Act of 2002," that expresses 
similar ideas to the "crack house" statute.  Section 416A, a one-paragraph 
addition to the bill, says that a promoter who handles "any rave, dance, 
music, or other entertainment event ...  where the promoter knows or 
reasonably ought to know that a controlled substance will be used or 
distributed" can be fined or imprisoned for up to nine years.  The wording 
is incredibly vague, not to mention ridiculous.  As Turner Madden, general 
counsel for the International Association of Assembly Managers Inc., 
writes in a letter to the chairman of the House Committee on the 
Judiciary, Rep.  James Sensenbrenner ( R-Wisc.  ), "businesses are 
generally not liable for the criminal acts of third parties." To prove his 
point, he brings up a 1985 decision in which a judge ruled that a Los 
Angeles Dodgers fan who got mugged in the parking lot after a game 
couldn't hold the team financially responsible.

Not to be outdone, the California Narcotic Officers' Association is 
sponsoring a statewide anti-rave bill, AB 1941.  The legislation requires 
that promoters of raves -- defined as all-night parties where "repetitive 
electronic music" is played -- jump through extensive permit hoops, 
acknowledge in writing their sufficient knowledge of drugs ( what, show 
off their bongs? ), and promise cross-your-heart style not to condone 
violations of drug laws.  Both the ACLU and the Center for Policy Reform 
have submitted letters opposing the bill, on the grounds that it is 
discriminatory, arbitrary, and draconian.  Unfortunately, the California 
Assembly passed the measure by a vote of 79-0, so we may have to hope the 
courts will strike it down.  Still, it couldn't hurt to send your state 
senators a letter saying how strongly you oppose the legislation.  Maybe 
include a glow stick as well.

For more information on both bills, go to www.emdef.org .

Subject: [sfraves] (NRR) Looking for a room to rent

Hi All,
  I'm looking for a new place to live and thought I'd try this group of 
like minded individuals to see if anyone has something available. I'm 
looking to live in Oakland or Berkeley, or perhaps Treasure Island. I 
have a full time day job, and my free time is usually occupied with 
activities related to DJing and Fire Dancing. Thanks ahead of time for 
your help!

Happy

"The government, which was designed for the people, has got into the hands 
of the bosses and their employers, the special interests.  An invisible 
empire has been set up above the forms of democracy."
-Woodrow Wilson

"There are times when you have to obey a call which is the highest of all, 
i.e. the voice of conscience even though such obedience may cost many a 
bitter tear, and even more, separation from friends, from family, from the 
state to which you may belong, from all that you have held as dear as life 
itself. For this obedience is the law of our being."
   Gandhi

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

Well I wish I had me $1 million dollars
Oh one million to call my own

I would raise meat and say, "grow for me baby"
I would raise me a tobacco farm

Well I wish I would have me a great deal of money
Yeah and mighty good things all over town

Now I ain't got no more money
All of my good friends are putting me down

So now I gotta pawn my rifle and pistol
Yeah I'm gonna pawn my watch and, chay, chay, chain

I would have pawned my sweet Gabriella

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: SURPRISE! George Bush doesn't believe in civil rights issues!
 (fwd)

http://www.guardian.co.uk/uselections2004/comment/story/0,14259,1332231,00.html

Passing almost without notice earlier this month, the public release of
The Civil Rights Record of the George W Bush Administration - the
official staff report prepared by the US Civil Rights Commission - whose
submission is required by federal law, was blocked by the Republican
commissioners. None the less, it was posted on the commission's website:
"This report finds that President Bush has neither exhibited leadership
on pressing civil rights issues, nor taken actions that matched his
words."

hi i'm sophia, i'm twenty years old and am working for my american sign language{asl} degree right now. i have a studio on shoreline drive, which is the beach area for alameda, i am hoping to find a roomate for a one bedroom or two bedroom ... i think prefferably a two bedroom would be perfect. it's called shoreline apts.. it's located on shoreline drive between Kitty Hawk and Grand. i'm really easy going, i would prefer a male although i'm flirting with the idea of lesbianism{for myself that is } it's great it has two pools but don't be fooled they are only warm about 3 months out of the year. kitty's are allowed but no dogs. i myself have a fifty gallon fishtank and a hamster. um.. i'm attending vista for asl then i plan on getting my interpreting certificate at Ohlone citty college. i love kicking back and watching movies on my futon and i would really love some company in my life. call me if  your interested and i'll get back to you [510]390-4845

1-866-OUR-VOTE is the hotline to report any incidents in
which voter's rights may be compromised from now on
through election day. The Election Protection Coalition
has put together a highly visual web-based voter based
monitoring system called the Election Incident Reporting
System (EIRS). The system tracks reports of voter
incidents on a color-coded map that rapidly identifies
locations where multiple complaints have occurred and
connects to a rapid response system where observers,
technical, and legal help can rapidly be sent out to
observe and record.

The brightly colored maps are drawn from information
collected by volunteers staffing hotlines.

The effort is funded through more than 60 voter watch
organizations. Volunteers can sign up through the site
to monitor polling locations for irregularities and help
with other implementation tasks.

Since its deployment on August 31, 2004 more than 1,000
incidents have been recorded and mapped.

"The government, which was designed for the people, has got into the hands 
of the bosses and their employers, the special interests.  An invisible 
empire has been set up above the forms of democracy."
-Woodrow Wilson

"There are times when you have to obey a call which is the highest of all, 
i.e. the voice of conscience even though such obedience may cost many a 
bitter tear, and even more, separation from friends, from family, from the 
state to which you may belong, from all that you have held as dear as life 
itself. For this obedience is the law of our being."
   Gandhi

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

Subject: [sfraves] ROOM FOR RENT !!

Howdy Boys and gurls..

The time has come again when I have a room for rent
and im looking for a cool down to earth roomate here
is the skinny on my place:

2 Bedrom 2 1/2 Bath Townhouse located centrally in
Milpitas (southbay)
Near all Major freeways (101,237,680,280 etc) Close to
the great mall and McCarthy ranch.
Room for rent: Dimensions 11W x 13L Nice Mid size room
two good sized sliding Mirrored closets
Private Balcony,Private Bathroom and exclusive access
to one car garage.
Rent $650 Plus half Utilities.
Perks (Me as a roomate)!! Well that ain't really a
perk but im laid back and cool so I guess in a way it
can be.

House specifics. Central A/C and Heat. Satellite TV in
every room. Nice living room entertainment center with
50 Inch TV for you die hard TV addicts such as myself.
Wireless DSL etc..

I will have pics up soon after I paint the room.

minor roomie requirements:
Male or female 21+  (Male prefered)
Non Smoker (Or smoke outside)
420 Friendly but it pretty much stops there with the
occasional others.
Stable income, don't have to be a "Techie" but at
least be able to support yourself.
Snowboarder or mountain biker (You get ++ points)
DJ,Artist or all around cool person (++ points again.)

If you read this far.. thanks  ;-)

PS: Room is avail Nov1 or sooner email for specifics.

If your interested or know someone that is hit me up
privately and I can go over it some more.

Macadio

hello, this is a continuation of a fictional piece:
 
a long, long time ago, far away on a completely different planet with a completely different atmosphere, food, water, general eco system, a planet with a completely different idea of what time it is, what day it was, and a planet where there was lots of cotton candy in a multitude of colors, there was a rainbow in a box under a floor board on a shelf, and it glowed and glowed, and it even made kind of a humming sound when there were lots of the kind of people that live on that planet who were kind of humming too. :)

For all of you that may not have heard, SKINNY PUPPY is playing the
Regency Nov. 26th.  I missed the last time they came to town, for some
very stupid reasons and I aint about to miss em again.  And all you
industrial lovers shouldn't either.  I havent heard they're new album
yet, so if anyone out there has it uploaded somewhere or can give me a
nice lil run down on it, i'd appreciate it.

"The government, which was designed for the people, has got into the hands 
of the bosses and their employers, the special interests.  An invisible 
empire has been set up above the forms of democracy."
-Woodrow Wilson

"There are times when you have to obey a call which is the highest of all, 
i.e. the voice of conscience even though such obedience may cost many a 
bitter tear, and even more, separation from friends, from family, from the 
state to which you may belong, from all that you have held as dear as life 
itself. For this obedience is the law of our being."
   Gandhi

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

When you've got a major artery gushing blood you don't try to
reconstruct the entire area right then. You put a tourniquet on it.
John Kerry is that tourniquet.

When you've got a major artery gushing blood you don't try to
reconstruct the entire area right then. You put a tourniquet on it.

"Opinions are my own only, and do not necessarily represent those of
KZSU Radio or Stanford University." (or words to that effect.)

Subject: [sfraves] The art (and science?) of set construction

So does anyone know of anything semi-intelligent
written about the art of set construction and
development?  *How to DJ Right* has some thoughts, and
I've done some google searches, but I'm looking for
something a bit deeper for a project.  Any help will
be appreciated...

Peace,

Peter

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Cast a spotlight on voter intimidation

I don't have a video phone, nor a camcorder.  But for those that do,
consider this effort.  And with early absentee voting efforts not having
the same rules and regulations that voting day does, I've heard of
intimidation coming from both sides (unfortunately.)
(http://www.VideoVoteVigil.org)

CAST A SPOTLIGHT ON VOTER INTIMIDATION

No right is more central to a functioning democracy than the right to vote.
Yet in this critical election newspapers are reporting daily on
anti-democratic efforts to suppress the vote. This must be stopped.

Working together we can do it. We are issuing a nation-wide call for
volunteer poll watchers armed with video cameras to document voter
intimidation efforts at polling places.

To support our efforts please contribute here:
http://texansfortruth.org/contribute.html

Texans for Truth is setting up a web site, http://www.VideoVoteVigil.org,
where citizens can post digital copies of their videos. We've prepared ahea=
d
of time to provide sufficient bandwidth and server space to make it easy fo=
r
volunteers to post their digitized videos. This site will be completed in
the next few days.

This year, when thugs raise their fists and phony felons lists to frighten
voters from the polls, they will be caught on camera and frozen in their
tracks.

We're looking for volunteers to film voter intimidation efforts wherever
they take place: highway road blocks, polling places, work sites, or
neighborhoods.

Attempted voter suppression will be exposed IMMEDIATELY =AD before they can
steal votes from our democracy. Working together, we can let would-be
intimidators know they cannot hide from the eyes of the world. We must
succeed in diminishing these voter intimidation efforts and providing
critical support to Americans trying to cast ballots in the 2004 election.

This year's effort has been well-documented by bloggers and the mainstream
press. Just Saturday, October 23, the New York Times described planned
efforts in Ohio to hire thugs to intimidate voters.

Daily Kos has a clearinghouse of information on voter intimidation and
TalkingPointsMemo has reported extensively on abuses here and here as have
many others.

Throughout the nation, in election after election, Republicans rely upon
voter intimidation and suppression strategies. As GOPer Webster Todd once
said after helping elect his sister, Christine Todd Whitman, as governor of
New Jersey, "That's where a lot of our effort went and a lot of our
planning, getting out the vote on one side and voter sup--and keeping the
vote light in other areas." Todd caught himself before finishing the word
"suppression."

In my 2004 book, The Politics of Deceit: Saving Freedom and Democracy from
Extinction, I make the case that the voter suppression effort is the most
under-reported political scandal of our time. Now, because of your support,
we are able to do something about it.

Bullies like to work in the dark. They like to hide. But with the help of
tens of thousands of volunteers, we can shine a light on these thugs. Join
us in this historic effort.

The thugs cannot escape a million righteous eyes.

thank you,
Glenn Smith

--=====================_5378904==.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"; format=flowed

I haven't been to the DNA since a horrible night at a Wicked party many 
moons ago.  My anti-big-club bias wasn't strong enough, however, to prevent 
me from attending True Skool's fifth anniversary party there on Saturday 
night.  Hell, I'd crawl on my hands and knees naked for ten miles in a snow 
storm to hear Afrika Bambaataa.

Further, I have become a big True Skool hip hop fan.  Been to a number of 
their parties and had a consistently good time.  TS attracts a crowd much 
like the early house/rave community did in the early nineties:  friendly, 
accepting, and very passionate about dance music.  Moving into a different 
musical subculture in this town can sometimes be a bumpy ride for a newbie, 
but even at my first TS event I felt like I was with family.

As you know, I have been feelin' the need for more funk and soul in my life 
and it is at these parties that I get my fix and more.

We arrived late as usual:  around 12:30, and the party started at 
nine.  Everyone seems to be getting to events earlier these days, and I'm 
still on the old NYC schedule.

I don't know if things have changed at the DNA, but for the TS party 
security was very chill.  Just an ID check at the door and no hassle with 
ins and outs.  They didn't even search my partner's camera bag.

The DNA was packed with the usual diverse and friendly TS crowd.  Very few 
if any clubber types.  No drama.  No aggression.   And it appeared from the 
lack of lines at the bar, very little drinking.

First thing we saw was a break dance performance by Soul 
Sector/Headhunters.  Impressive.   One guy spun like a top on his head, 
body perfectly straight, for several seconds.  Then Coop D'Ville came on 
with a live performance.  TS is an openly political collective with an 
agenda that harmonizes with my own beliefs, so it was refreshing to hear 
Coop rapping about our current political climate.

We spent some time in the smaller room dancing to hip hop, and then Bam 
arrived on the main floor.  Bam is a DJ like DJs used to be.  He plays a 
very eclectic and innovative set, and his musical experience goes back to 
the seventies.  I love and respect this man, and god did I enjoy his 
set.  So many extraordinary remixes of old school stuff -- and, what a 
happy surprise, he ended his set with "Respect."  Haven't danced to that in 
a club in decades.

As I was dancing with abandon to Bam a kid who didn't look a day older than 
21 comes up and suggests I go up on the stage with the breakdancers.  He 
said:  "I still had it goin'."  Well, the days of spinning on my head are 
gone, but it's cool to know one's display of love for the beat is still 
appreciated:)

True Skool is doing something very important for the dance music community 
in the Bay and is right in synch with my own musical direction these 
days.  In fact, it is the only party in town right now where I would 
really, really like to spin.  So I'm going to put together a demo for them 
when all my political work is finished in November.

This Friday another soulful party, a tribute to Stevie Wonder, is going 
down at Club Mighty with DJ Spinna and Bobbito.  This year I'm just burnt 
out on Halloween so I just may do my weekend celebration there.  No costume 
needed, and Sake-One from Local 1200 will also be performing.

Much love,

Apollo

1000 door tickets have been held at $30, doors open at 10PM first come first 
serve.  I believe they blew through 1000 or so presales really fast, so you 
probably want to get down there early if you want to make sure you get in. 
If you make it say hello, I'm playing with George on bass in the Green room 
2-3:30...

        I'm lame and poor so I wasn't able to get tix online this go around. 
I've checked the web and saw that the pre-sales are sold out. I didn't see 
any mention of what door prices are. So I'm asking all the knowledged here. 
Door price and if it's easy/hard to get them, prefered time to arrive to get 
them etc.

        *sigh*

        On another note, I watched both Human Traffic and Groove this week. 
Hadn't watched them for awhile. Ahh good times. Sometimes I really miss 
that.

Oh c'mon.  Any Clear Channel concert would cost way more than that...
and Simon Posford is certinaly top-bill talent.  I can think of no producer
who is more talented than him.

Presales were cheaper too.

They're bringing in two of the biggest most respected international 
psytrance acts out there, running 4 rooms of talent from SF and LA, and 550 
is not cheap to rent out either, believe me even with a sell out they aren't 
exactly going to be making bank.  Supply vs. Demand, obviously enough people 
are willing to pay that much for the party they get in return.  Plus they 
gave the presale ticket buyers a break, so if you wanted to go that bad for 
cheaper you could have.  Plenty of other options on Halloween weekend anyway 
if that's not your cup of tea.

No matter your genre....heads that know will miss John Peel for the many 
years of dedicated enthusiasm as a true pioneer of progressive music....



"He became one of the first DJs to give exposure to punk, reggae and 
hip-hop, before they crossed over into the mainstream. "



------------------------------------------------



Legendary radio DJ John Peel dies

Veteran BBC broadcaster John Peel has died at the age of 65, while on 
holiday in Peru.

Peel, whose radio career spanned 40 years, was on a working holiday in the 
city of Cuzco with his wife Sheila when he suffered a heart attack.

He was BBC Radio 1's longest-serving DJ and in recent years had also 
presented Home Truths on Radio 4.

Radio 1 controller Andy Parfitt said Peel's contribution to modern music 
and culture was "immeasurable".

'Hugely missed'

He added: "John Peel was a broadcasting legend. I am deeply saddened by his 
death as are all who work at Radio 1. "John's influence has towered over 
the development of popular music for nearly four decades.



HAVE YOUR SAY

John Peel stayed true to what mattered most in music
Pete, Nottingham, UK

"Hopeful bands all over the world sent their demo tapes to John knowing 
that he really cared.

"His commitment and passion for new music only grew stronger over the 
years. In fact, when I last saw him he was engaged in a lively debate with 
his fellow DJs over the state of new music today

"He will be hugely missed."

Mr Parfitt told Radio 1's Newsbeat that Peel had been on a holiday of a 
lifetime when he died.

'Irreplaceable'

He added: "He had gone on holiday with Sheila to a place where he had 
always wanted to go."





BBC director general Mark Thompson said: "We are all very shocked and 
saddened by the news of John's death.

"He was one of the giants of radio and will be missed, not just by everyone 
at the BBC, but by millions of listeners of all ages."

Tony Blair's spokesman said the Prime Minister was "genuinely saddened by 
the news".

He added: "His view is that he was a unique voice in British broadcasting 
and used that voice to unearth new talent and different subjects and make 
them accessible to a much wider audience."

Radio 1 DJ Jo Whiley, who presented coverage of the Glastonbury Festival 
with Peel, paid tribute to her colleague and close friend.

She said: "John was simply one of my favourite men in the whole world - as 
a music fan and presenter he was simply an inspiration."

Mainstream music

Peel was born in Heswall, near Liverpool, and after completing his military 
service in Britain in 1962, went to the US where he began working for a 
radio station in Dallas.



It was because of him I got to hear some of the most obscure but 
influential music I ever heard
James Dean Bradfield, Manic Street Preachers

He joined Radio 1 at the launch in 1967, and established himself with the 
late night programme Top Gear.

He became one of the first DJs to give exposure to punk, reggae and 
hip-hop, before they crossed over into the mainstream.

Peel's programme built up a reputation around the world, and in addition to 
his Radio 1 programme, he could also be heard on the BBC's World Service.

James Dean Bradfield, lead singer of the Manic Street Preachers, paid 
tribute to Peel.

He told BBC News Online: "It was because of him I got to hear some of the 
most obscure but influential music I ever heard.

"He was a lifeline to hearing music I would never have heard otherwise. The 
service he provided was getting to hear music that you couldn't buy in 
Cardiff. He was a portal to a whole new world."



He always had his finger on the pulse of the music industry
Michael Bradley, Undertones

Blur lead singer Damon Albarn said John Peel's patronage was "one of the 
most significant things that happened to us in our careers".

"The world is going to be a poorer place with his sudden departure. I will 
miss him deeply," he added.

"I want to send my heartfelt sympathy to his lovely family. John's memory 
will never be forgotten because he had the spirit of music in him."

Favourite record

After announcing Peel's death on Radio 1, the station played his favourite 
song, Teenage Kicks, by the Undertones.

Michael Bradley, bass player for the Undertones, spoke of his shock on 
learning of Peel's death.

He said: "He was a very funny, very warm man and we will always be grateful 
for what he did for The Undertones.

"Personally, I find it incredible what he did for the band and we always 
got huge pride out of the fact that he said Teenage Kicks was his favourite 
single.

"He always had his finger on the pulse of the music industry and the fact 
that Radio 1 played the Undertones, the White Stripes and the Strokes today 
showed just how relevant he remained throughout his career."

"The government, which was designed for the people, has got into the hands 
of the bosses and their employers, the special interests.  An invisible 
empire has been set up above the forms of democracy."
-Woodrow Wilson

"There are times when you have to obey a call which is the highest of all, 
i.e. the voice of conscience even though such obedience may cost many a 
bitter tear, and even more, separation from friends, from family, from the 
state to which you may belong, from all that you have held as dear as life 
itself. For this obedience is the law of our being."
   Gandhi

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

I had no plans on going. I really could care less about psy trance. I just 
really get annoyed when I see events with jacked up prices. Sell ALL tickets 
at the same price. Fuck that markup at the door shit. I have zero respect 
for that kind of shit.

I didn't realize that Thump was in league with Clear Channel. That's a 
horrible comparison and unjust to the Thump people. I'm more annoyed with 
the usual jack up the prices at the door shit. Worse is when they jack up 
prices at the door, and then as it gets closer to peak hour the prices go up 
again. To me it's very simple. The price is set and it doesn't change. I 
rarely pay to go to events like that. Not worth my $$.

I don't see how discounted presales that allow people who really follow the 
promoter and/or artist (ie the hardcore in that scene) to get in for a 
cheaper price is a bad thing.  The price has been announced for $30 on the 
flyer itself, they're not jacking up the price at the door.  The presales 
went for a price cheaper than advertised on the flyer...

Tickets were cheaper because it helps the Thump crew to make plans when
you buy your tickets early.  So to incentivize you to buy them early
(thereby forgoing 1 month interest on that 25 bucks), you get them a few
dollars cheaper.  If you have a problem with the price, buy early.

If you have a personal problem with cheaper presales, then DON'T FUCKING
GO.  But for fuck's sake, quit whining about it.   You already said you
didn't want to go anyway.

> Now maybe if they brought in REAL top notch talent playing live like they 

Umm, it's a bit cocky of you to decide what REAL talent is.  Most everyone
who is into psytrance agrees that Simon is one of the VERY BEST producers
and musicians.  And not only do we get his new solo act, we get his
Shpongle act, too.  That's *REAL* talent.  

You may not think Simon is worth 20 or 30 bucks.  There are a couple
thousand other people who do, and we'll have a great time without you.

Simon Posford, who puts out releases as Hallucinogen and Shpongle (as well
as others), is about as "real top notch" a talent as I can think if in the
dance world. He is arguably the best psytrance producer in the world. $30
to see him in a good club like 550 is not a bad deal. It sounds to me like
you're just having a bad day again. :)

I don't think $30 is worth being spent on most nightlife period. What I call 
real tallent is my choice and what I spend my money is my choice. You're 
just pissy because I don't think $30 is worth spending on what you think is 
real talent. =P

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Thumpoween question

Naa man - I've got a gorgeous view in front of me right now and some great 
music in my headphones. My day is just peachy. I just could give a rats ass 
about psy trance. I know who the guy is. I know the other acts he performs 
under. I know this fucking area loves that shit. It's not for me. Now that's 
just me, and really I'm not ripping on psy trance here. I like it in small 
doses.

Beyond all of that I am getting more and more annoyed with the increasing 
prices of clubs these days. Thump I will give credit to actually putting 
effort into the production and for those of you into psy trance and the 
relevent artwork - you're stoked. To me when I have been I see it as *at 
least they actually put some effort into production with banners, string 
art, fire dancers outside, etc* and it ends there. I see people like Dax out 
there throwing parties in the D7 warehouse with people pissing in the sink 
and shitting in the shower with zero production, no effort and jacking up 
prices throughout the night just because people are stupid enough to pay. 
It's an overall trend in SF. Even *Walnut Creek* (LAUGH) is getting away 
with charging $10 cover for their stupid little clubs! I'm amazed that 
people pay out like that. I really wish that things hadn't taken such a 
business greed turn lately. I know things can be done better than what I've 
seen and for a lot less.

Hell it's gone so far that even my stupid high school reunion planner kids 
can't figure out how to throw an event for less than $75/head and that's not 
with an open bar! Oh and it's at the old Charlie Brown's in San Ramon.

Who started this thread?  And you are calling us pissy?

What was your point?

You didn't want to go anyway, so why do you even care what it costs?

"That fucking Britney Spears concert charging $50 bucks a ticket?  That
so stupid, you're just suppose to bend over and take it like a good 
consumer?  Of course, I am not going to a stupid Britney Spears concert.  
But $50 bucks a ticket?  Its an outrage!!!  And you should be outraged
too!!!"

I am and thank god I'm not a parent with a kid that wants to go to one of 
her concerts. Fortunately people voted with their money in that case and she 
called off her tour. So did christina aguillera and jessica simpson. People 
wouldn't pay up. Now if only that would happen in SF clubland...

and god damn man - you've reduced yourself to an argument of who started 
this thread? You've got better critical thinking skills than that...

Presales ease the budgeting process by getting money in sooner. I
think rewarding people who hand in their money sooner is reasonable.

Perhaps the wording should be: Tickets $30. Presale ticket buyers
get a $5 discount.

One should get a *whole lot* for $25 or $30, At that price point
collectives I've been associated with have thrown events with great
light shows, visuals, and artists. We've provided free-food, plenty
of porta-potties, smoothies, chai, earplugs, etc. We've provided
bust-proof venues with lots of room, friendly and professional
security, and EMTs too.

I'd be disappointed in a $30 party that didn't run till at least 7
or 8am, that was in a less than permitted location, that was
oversold, that had a disorganized crew, that wanted to sell me
bottled water, etc.

Exactly my point. Thus when you get into club land and its over inflated 
pricing it makes you wonder. Even DNA can throw a $5 Alumni party and pack 
the place. That's how it should be right there. More bang for your buck and 
less overpriced club crap that suck. But I guess once you start dealing with 
the club scene you have to sell yourself out and get down with the lust for 
cash money.

I think the Bay Area has an extremely good mix of free, cheap, medium, and 
high priced parties, as well as a good mix of electronic music, and of 
bar/lounge, club, underground, and rave scenes...something for everyone.

Any industry will have some people that do it for the greed, some that do it 
for the love, and some that love it and are trying to make a living out of 
it.  I see plenty of people on both side of the fence in SF, but I'm glad I 
have options.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Thumpoween question

I really hate to stick myself into this innane arguement, but I see the
business side of it - from the venue owner's point.

The rising cost of material to run the club rises every day. The more
people drink, the more supplies you have to buy to replace used/broken
material. Bars have to order new glassware every week, new janitorial
supplies, employees salaries, utilities, etc.

And because of the rising costs, they have to pass that along in their
rental costs and door charges. That's where WE come in - we have to pay
these rising costs, drink more, etc. to keep them in business.

Now when you add that in to the costs of running an event such as
Thump, there you get your $30 door tix, with the $5 off price if you
buy early. It's a deal for what you're getting for 7 hours of fun
times.

So honestly, I don't see why *anyone* is bitching - inflation & the
cost of living here is fucking high. I think we're LUCKY to only have
to spend $30 to see Simon & hear lots of other awesome acts and enjoy
the decor.

Anyway... have fun @ Thumpoween... I have to miss it for a family
funeral in Ohio.

Jessica

Where does this information come from? Are you speculating? It
doesn't seem to jibe with anything I've seen or heard.

I've known many bar/club owners and none have ever complained about
breakage. If people are buying enough drinks to break a lot of
glasses, the bar is making BANK. Glasses cost *nothing* compared to
the markup on alcohol. *Nothing*.

If you want to see something interesting, look at both Thump's and
550 Barneveld's _actual_ budgets for that night.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Howard Stern calls in and clashes with FCC Chairman. Check it!!!

Yup.. crazy indeed.  Michael is a very well spoken man.  Articulate, sharp,
thoughtful.. Essentially the quintessential lawyer turned FCC politician.
Howard came in a little frantic, and should have taken the two hours for
which he knew he was going to call and draft out some questions with his
lawyer.  Perhaps he did.. Perhaps they just don't have much of a position..
regardless.. Howard came out of that a little ruffled.  

Here is the wrap-up

1. Consolidation: Rules for spectrum allocation regarding consolidation by
conglomerates have tightened to restrict large firms from buying broad
market shares.
   
2. Indecency jurisdiction: The FTC governs commercial content, and that is
subject to protection under the first amendment, except in cases of
indecency in which the FCC was granted special power to impose fines and set
standards for indecency as determined by the Supreme Court and congress.

3. FCC Board constituents are non-partisan.. although some have expressed a
conservative and over-reaching desire to curb further indecent private
content.  To this Michael responded that he felt it was wrong to try and
restrict private content under first amendment rights and that the it was
the wrong direction for the governing body. 

Too bad nobody called to inquire about the free-radio bans in santa cruz and
elsewhere.. one caller was from santa cruz.. but the ass-wipe made the fatal
error of having his background radio on and it looped into the broadcast and
so was cut off.  I can't believe he friggin did that.. what a dork..  if you
are reading this.. better luck next time.. oh ya.. what next time.

Cheers!
Ranger

Also, I don't think Thump is exactly a windfall in the drinking area.
Most Thumpers are otherwise engaged.

That's the case for pretty much any after hours club, not just Thump.
People just don't down non-alcoholic drinks after 2am like they do booze
before 2am. So you have 4-6 hours of operating time where there bar isn't
doing much business. Most people don't get to a club til midnight, so that
leaves only 2, maybe 3 hours of drinking revenue. No wonder the cover for
most after hours clubs is so high. This is especially the case if you have
to pay for out of town big name DJs. The bar does help subsidize that
somewhat, but not like if it there were alcohol sales past 2am.

	This is the best article I have seen yet on why Bush does not deserve  
reelection. That's certainly not to say vote for Kerry -- in many  
respects, he simply offers more of the same, and has plenty of his own  
problems to boot. Michael Badnarik is the only responsible choice for  
president, in my opinion. But a vote for any of the significant  
candidates running would be better than a vote for Bush:

"There are times when you have to obey a call which is the highest of all, 
i.e. the voice of conscience even though such obedience may cost many a

itself. For this obedience is the law of our being."

Honestly, it's good to see a major celebrity taking a stand, period.  I 
know there's quite a few older hollywood famous people with varying 
political views, but I don't see many young stars expressing their beliefs 
so well.  Even if it turns out more voters FOR Bush, I applaud Eminem.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Thumpoween question

Just throw in my own twi bits on this one....

I have to agree with Ryan almost 100% on this one.  I don't so much 
have a problem with pre-sales being a bit cheaper.  I've even been 
known to pop out to the record store, myself, to score the el-cheapos 
to a party I know is getting jacked up.

But as far as ticket prices go, it seems that far too many promoters 
*STILL* haven't gotten it through their skulls that the dotcom boom is 
over, the economy's in the shitter despite what the talking monkey 
says, and we're NOT all swimming in money anymore.  I know *I* sure as 
hell can't drop $30 (JUST for the ticket, double or triple that for the 
whole night's expenses.) on a whim.  And I certainly WON'T for a club 
night at a skeezy place like 550 barnevald.

I wonder what the average pay-cut on SFRaves has been over the 
2000-2004 timeframe?  I'd guess it's been quite significant.  I know it 
has been throughout the Bay Area overall.  But are promoters lowering 
their prices accordingly?  A few are.  A few more never got the idea of 
making phat bank off  the rave scene in the first place, and have had 
reasonable prices since I first moved here.  And kudos to them.  But 
all too often, you see promoters still expecting to live the high life 
off of the scene, and still charging dotcom-era prices of $30 or more, 
with $4 water, and so on, for one night's worth of entertainment.

Hell, even Skills has dropped the price of their tickets!  The first 
Popsicle I went to, I think I paid $40 for my ticket.  The one coming 
up, I paid $22 including the record store's service fee!  And Skills is 
the "big commercial massive promoter" that everyone loves to hate!  
(Heh... bonus:  they've also finally figured out that telling people to 
go home at 2am is teh lame, otherwise I wouldn't be going even with the 
cheaper ticket price.)


cya,
john

Yes, it warms my heart to see this happening all over, including oh so
many newspapers who endorsed G.W. in 2000. :)  I see international
travel prices going through the roof if this doesn't come through.

(And it looks like I beat the 4am. deadline too! Oh, I hope Osby found a
crash space.  I didn't hear any doorbell ring nor knock.)

P.S., If you're wondering about how you can help out with this thing
even if you're in Cali, email me and I can try to point you in the right
direction.)


http://www.yesbushcan.com/media.shtml

October 27, 2004
  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Contact
  Website: http://www.yesbushcan.com/
  Act: http://www.yesbushcan.com/act.shtml

BUSH CAMPAIGN GROUP ENDORSES KERRY

"Yes, Bush Can" now says "no, Bush can't!"

Yes, Bush Can, an independent group dedicated to communicating Bush
policies directly to the public, has abandoned its campaign and is
officially endorsing John Kerry for President.

Before changing sides, the Yes, Bush Can team drove around the
country supporting the President in a campaign bus equipped with
sound and light systems, confetti cannons, and various props and
costumes. They gave dozens of stump speeches, distributed campaign
videos and "USA Patriot Pledges," and performed patriotic songs to
audiences across the country. (See
http://www.yesbushcan.com/media.shtml and
http://www.yesbushcan.com/pledge.shtml.)

Last week, the group officially split with Bush. "In the course of
our travels, we ended up learning more about Bush's policies than he
wanted us to know," said Harmon Spellmeyer, one of the Yes, Bush Can
team. "We came to see that this administration is a catastrophe for
most people."

Before breaking with Bush, the Yes, Bush Can team worked earnestly to
support him. They went to the Pacific Northwest to promote Bush's
Healthy Forests Initiative--and discovered it was enabling the
logging industry to cut down our last old-growth forests. They
visited a nuclear power plant in Ohio to promote Bush's domestic
security policies--and found no one in the guard booth to meet them.
In western Pennsylvania, while promoting the President's energy
policy, they learned that it allows coal emissions which kill 23,000
people a year. Finally, while defending Bush's war on terrorism, they
found out that most analysts--including Donald Rumsfeld and many
generals--feel that the Iraq War has actually generated many
thousands of new terrorists.

After many similar discoveries and much internal turmoil, the Yes,
Bush Can group arrived at the difficult conclusion that they could
not continue their work. At a press conference Tuesday, the team
defaced and abandoned their campaign bus in order to demonstrate how
profoundly they are rejecting their former boss's ideas and policies.

 From now until the election, the former Bush campaigners will be
doing all they can to make sure that Bush is prevented from winning
the presidency. They will be joining many thousands of others in
going door-to-door to "get out the vote" in cities throughout
Florida--beginning with Jacksonville, a mostly Black city where
11,000 votes were never counted in 2000. (Statewide, 179,000 votes
weren't counted, more than half of them Black. 90% of Blacks voted
for Gore.)

The former Yes, Bush Can team recommends the following websites to
those who wish to help "get out the vote":

http://www.democrats.org/roadtrip/
http://volunteer.johnkerry.com/traveler/

support to "get out the vote" efforts, visit

Finally, visit the Yes, Bush Can website to follow the Yes, Bush Can
team as they join thousands of others in helping make sure that Bush
can do no more damage to America's economy, ecology, and dignity.

John Kerry is that tourniquet.

I work at a restaurant supply company in the territory sales department
- we SELL them their supplies. I have a very keen idea on how much the
local entertainment scene buys on a regular basis. Thousands upon
thousands of dozens of glassware goes through us for your nighttime
enjoyment. And it may not be the customers breaking *all* the glasses -
the employees aren't that careful, either.

And it's not just Tump - it's EVERYONE that buys drinks there
throughout the weekend, month, year... all of that cost is passed along
to you in your drink prices & door charges.

I have worked at *many* bars/nightclubs, and this is RARELY the reason for 
increased door prices. It is typically noticed in higher drink prices, if 
anywhere.

OBSERVING TIMES
US and Canada: The Moon enters Earth's shadow at 9:14 pm EST / (6:14 pm PST), followed by totality during 10:23 - 11:45 pm EST / 7:23 - 8:45 pm PST and exits Earth's shadow at 00:54 am EST / 9:54 pm PST.

Europe: Eclipse occurs during the early morning hours of Thursday, October 28. The Moon enters Earth's shadow at 01:14 UTC, followed by totality during 02:23 - 03:45 UTC and exits Earth's shadow at 04:54 UTC.

Sorry for the job span.. but a brutha has to reach out sometimes :-)

 

If anyone has any leads on recruiters or if you have job referral programs
with your financial or IT centric company in the downtown SF, or SouthBay I
could sure use a new job.  I am looking for something in the following: IT
Project Management - newbie associate position (15 years IT), Market
Research / Data Analyst - Masters in Applied Finance and Economics, or  an
IT position in Software Support.. what I have been doing for the last 10
years.

 

Thanks,

 

Ranger

A friend just posted this little jem.. thought some lucky peeps in the city
might get off on this battle of vinyl proportions!


Wed. Oct. 27th: S??perQo?l vs Sister


Qo?l has invited us down for another head-to-head session! 

With: Forest Green, Seraphim, Samira, and residents Spesh, Mark Musselman,
Scott Carrelli, and Jerry Bonham. 

It starts at 5pm, so, make an executive decision & leave work early! 

111 Minna, SF, 5-11pm, $5, 21+ 

==================================== 

Step right up and toss down five bones for your chance to witness another
epic battle of the sexes. The ultra-slick residents of Qo?l welcome the
Sister SF super vixens to the arena of 111 Minna for another record-slinging
showdown. This is some serious turntable talent, and the last time these two
crews got together every ass in the house was helpless before the onslaught
of their combined grooves.

Subject: [sfraves] MIX REVIEW: Koroma Live on House Nation

Ok, so Koroma gave me this like 3 months ago (maybe more), and I am just now 
peeping it as I sit here at my lovely new job (which allows me the luxury of 
jamming beats all day long whilst I work).

I have to say, barring a few sloppy mixes - this mix SLAYS. Definitely your 
mama's sleepy ass progressive house. This mix bangs like crazy, has an 
overall excellent track selection/programming and really gets you amped up. 
I am bouncing in my seat as I listen to it, and I'm quite sure my co-workers 
think I'm ADHD or crackhead - somethin' along those lines.

Anyhoo - I don't have a tracklisting, but rest assured, it is dope.

While we're BS'ing about prog.house - go to  www.friskyradio.com  and 
download Jack Triumph's latest mix "Feel". It is 
realllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllly pretty, well executed, and epic. As 
good if not better than those shite Global Underground mixes put out by the 
"pros". (and Jack actually mixes - no digital mixing)

Most excellent.  I also just got a gig where I can
listen to good tunes while I work since its a music
oriented job.  And I was just digging some old
progressive house mix from Nick Warren.

I'm heading over to friskyradio next.

Peace,

21 WASHINGTON (11 EVs):

Play It Again, Sam
John Kerry named Sam Rodriguez his new WA state dir. Rodriguez said the
Dem ticket is "a perfect match" for the "trade-dependent state, despite"
GOP criticism of John Edwards' "protectionist views." Rodriguez said
he's "guardedly optimistic" that Kerry and Edwards will carry WA's 11
EVs, noting that "the high caliber" of Sen. Patty Murray's (D)
reelection campaign "will lift all Democratic candidates." Rodriguez
said the Spokane media market "is a key target"; the region "narrowly
went for" Pres. Clinton, but Pres. Bush "trounced" Al Gore in 2000.
Rodriguez: "We feel good about breaking even or winning there this time"
(Ammons, AP, 7/10).

  'Hobbit' joins human family tree
BBC News

Scientists have discovered a new and tiny species of human that lived in 
Indonesia at the same time our own ancestors were colonising the world.

The three-foot (one-metre) tall species - dubbed "the Hobbit" - lived on 
Flores island until at least 12,000 years ago.

The fact that little people feature in the legends of modern Flores 
islanders suggests we might have to take tales of Leprechauns and Yeti more 
seriously.

Details of the sensational find are described in the journal Nature.

The discovery has been hailed as one of the most significant of its type in 
decades.

Australian archaeologists unearthed the bones while digging at a site 
called Liang Bua, one of numerous limestone caves on Flores.

The remains of the partial skeleton were found at a depth of 5.9m. At 
first, the researchers thought it was the body of a child. But further 
investigation revealed otherwise.

Wear on the teeth and growth lines on the skull confirm it was an adult, 
features of the pelvis identify it as female and a leg bone confirms that 
it walked upright like we do.

"When we got the dates back from the skeleton and we found out how young it 
was, one anthropologist working with us said it must be wrong because it 
had so many archaic [primitive] traits," said co-discoverer Mike Morwood, 
associate professor of archaeology at the University of New England, Australia.

King of the swingers?

The 18,000-year-old specimen, known as Liang Bua 1 or LB1, has been 
assigned to a new species called Homo floresiensis . It was about one metre 
tall with long arms and a skull the size of a large grapefruit.

The researchers have since found remains belonging to six other individuals 
from the same species.

LB1 shared its island with a golden retriever-sized rat, giant tortoises 
and huge lizards - including Komodo dragons - and a pony-sized dwarf 
elephant called Stegodon which the "hobbits" probably hunted.

Chris Stringer, head of human origins at London's Natural History Museum 
said the long arms were an intriguing feature and might even suggest H. 
floresiensis spent much of its time in the trees.

"We don't know this. But if there were Komodo dragons about you might want 
to be up in the trees with your babies where it's safe. It's something for 
future research, but the fact they had long arms is at least suggestive," 
Professor Stringer told BBC News Online.

Studies of its hands and feet, which have not yet been described, may shed 
light on this question, he added.

H. floresiensis probably evolved from another species called Homo erectus , 
whose remains have been discovered on the Indonesian island of Java.

Homo erectus may have arrived on Flores about one million years ago, 
evolving its tiny physique in the isolation provided by the island.

What is surprising about this is that this species must have made it to 
Flores by boat. Yet building craft for travel on open water is 
traditionally thought to have been beyond the intellectual abilities of 
Homo erectus .

Legendary creatures

Even more intriguing is the fact that Flores' inhabitants have incredibly 
detailed legends about the existence of little people on the island they 
call Ebu Gogo.

The islanders describe Ebu Gogo as being about one metre tall, hairy and 
prone to "murmuring" to each other in some form of language. They were also 
able to repeat what islanders said to them in a parrot-like fashion.

"There have always been myths about small people - Ireland has its 
Leprechauns and Australia has the Yowies. I suppose there's some feeling 
that this is an oral history going back to the survival of these small 
people into recent times," said co-discoverer Peter Brown, an associate 
professor of archaeology at New England.

The last evidence of this human at Liang Bua dates to just before 12,000 
years ago, when a volcanic eruption snuffed out much of Flores' unique 
wildlife.

Yet there are hints H. floresiensis could have lived on much later than 
this. The myths say Ebu Gogo were alive when Dutch explorers arrived a few 
hundred years ago and the very last legend featuring the mythical creatures 
dates to 100 years ago.

But Henry Gee, senior editor at Nature magazine, goes further. He 
speculates that species like H.floresiensis might still exist, somewhere in 
the unexplored tropical forest of Indonesia.

Textbook rewrite

Professor Stringer said the find "rewrites our knowledge of human 
evolution." He added: "To have [this species] present 12,000 years ago is 
frankly astonishing."

Homo floresiensis might have evolved its small size in response to the 
scarcity of resources on the island.

"When creatures get marooned on islands they evolve in new and 
unpredictable courses. Some species grow very big and some species grow 
very small," Dr Gee explained.

The sophistication of stone tools found with the "hobbit" has surprised 
some scientists given the human's small brain size of 380cc (around the 
same size as a chimpanzee).

"The whole idea that you need a particular brain size to do anything 
intelligent is completely blown away by this find," Dr Gee commented.

Because the remains are relatively recent and not fossilised, scientists 
are even hopeful they might yield DNA, which could provide an entirely new 
perspective on the evolution of the human lineage.

FRIDAY, October 29th

KeiStar Productions in association with, Massive Selector, Fresco, & 
Fatsouls presents:

WONDER-Full

Even the most devoted contrarian has trouble hating on Stevie Wonder. So 
why not do a party dedicated to the wonder of Stevie ? New York 
DJ-producers Bobbito , a.k.a. Cucumberslice (Fruit Meat Records), and 
Spinna (Beyond Real) have been doing just that with their Stevie Wonder 
appreciation party  Wonder-Full  for five years now, even taking it on 
the road to Amsterdam , London , and Tokyo . On the West Coast for the 
first time, this promises to be a good-time jam full of all soul flavors 
inspired by Wonder, with local support from Sake 1 (Local 1200), Said ( 
Fatsouls ), and the Massive Selector and Fresco crews.

ABOUT DJ SPINNA
Born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, DJ Spinna is regarded as one of the 
most versatile and talented producers / DJ's / remixers in today's musical 
arena. He's produced numerous tracks and remixes for artists such as 
Michael Jackson, De La Soul, George Michael, Mary J. Blige , Mos Def, Shaun 
Escofery , Grand Puba , Zero 7, and Soulive . Those who follow DJ Spinna 
and have witnessed his legendary DJ sets claim that he is one of the most 
important figures in the world of music today.
   <http://massiveselector.com/radio.php?show=spinna>--> Listen to a set

ABOUT BOBBITO
Although Bobbito aka Dj Cucumberslice is a bonafide Hip-Hop legend, any 
reader of his Vibe column would know that his musical passion goes way 
beyond just Rap. As a club DJ, crowds worldwide from Sweden to South Africa 
have celebrated his unique blend of Rare Funk, Latin, Afro-Beat, Soul, 
Classic Rock, House, and Ballads. He's an accomplished music columnist for 
the Vibe Magazine, 
<http://massiveselector.c.topica.com/maacMeDaba0S1a5lYmlcaeQyb9/>wrote the 
most the most talked about book regarding sneaker culture, "Where'd You Get 
Those?" , and even runs his own record label, Fruitmeat . But who can 
forget back in 1990 when he met DJ Stretch Armstrong and started the 
Stretch & Bobbito Show on WKCR 89.9 FM. Voted the "Best Hip Hop Radio Show 
of All Time," Stretch & Bobbito introduced the world to unsigned acts like 
Nas , Jay Z, Big Pun, Wu-Tang, Mobb Deep, and many others that would go on 
to change the face of Hip Hop. Bobbito's list of accolades goes on and on...

Join us for a special evening in celebration of soulful music in all forms 
inspired by the genius of Stevie Wonder. From Funk to Hip-Hop, House to 
Broken Beat, Dancefloor Classics and beyond, DJ SPINNA & BOBBITO are coming

"The government, which was designed for the people, has got into the hands 
of the bosses and their employers, the special interests.  An invisible 
empire has been set up above the forms of democracy."
-Woodrow Wilson

"There are times when you have to obey a call which is the highest of all, 
i.e. the voice of conscience even though such obedience may cost many a 
bitter tear, and even more, separation from friends, from family, from the 
state to which you may belong, from all that you have held as dear as life 
itself. For this obedience is the law of our being."
   Gandhi

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

House Music 101:  http://livingart.com/raving/articles/housemusic101.htm


"The government, which was designed for the people, has got into the hands 
of the bosses and their employers, the special interests.  An invisible 
empire has been set up above the forms of democracy."
-Woodrow Wilson

"There are times when you have to obey a call which is the highest of all, 
i.e. the voice of conscience even though such obedience may cost many a 
bitter tear, and even more, separation from friends, from family, from the 
state to which you may belong, from all that you have held as dear as life 
itself. For this obedience is the law of our being."
   Gandhi

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

Subject: Re: [sfraves] snowboarding anyone??

I have a free 2 night stay at one of the major South Lake Tahoe
casino-hotels to give away this month. No strings attached, really. No
specific travel dates that I know of. Must be 21+.

First one to hit me up and complete the entry form before the end of the
month gets it.

Word from Tahoe is that it dumped like mad (5+ feet?) and Sierrra is
opening this weekend. Any takers?

Subject: RE: [sfraves] MIX REVIEW: Koroma Live on House Nation

Hey Marc,
You know i got that cd as well. I literally can't keep still to it either. i 
Actually got a few of his cds. Went to POP 4 and he was there giving out 
Cds.I got me ONE! I have the demo he gave out from POP 5 too.
This dj can spin. HE really keeps me pumped and wanting more proggie house.
I went to his site recently because i saw that he's been mixing all over the 
place. He's got a page with all his mixes he's made and you can buy them.

I bought his live New Years' Eve set. It was awesome. 2- Disc or you could 
buy them separately.(Buy them both, i learned that if you buy one you'll 
crave to hear the rest of it....*Slapping hands*BAD GIRL ME!) Listening to 
that set i literally thought i was there, he really had some great tracks 
there too.

Check it out. it's www.koroma.com. it even gives you a little taste of what 
you get in the CD.


L8eRs!!
Ciao,
CHic09

Ok, so Koroma gave me this like 3 months ago (maybe more), and I am just now 
peeping it as I sit here at my lovely new job (which allows me the luxury of 
jamming beats all day long whilst I work).

I have to say, barring a few sloppy mixes - this mix SLAYS. Definitely your 
mama's sleepy ass progressive house. This mix bangs like crazy, has an 
overall excellent track selection/programming and really gets you amped up. 
I am bouncing in my seat as I listen to it, and I'm quite sure my co-workers 
think I'm ADHD or crackhead - somethin' along those lines.

Anyhoo - I don't have a tracklisting, but rest assured, it is dope.

While we're BS'ing about prog.house - go to  www.friskyradio.com  and 
download Jack Triumph's latest mix "Feel". It is 
realllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllly pretty, well executed, and epic. As 
good if not better than those shite Global Underground mixes put out by the 
"pros". (and Jack actually mixes - no digital mixing)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] snowboarding anyone??

This weekend is just too damn busy, but the first weekend in November I'm 
very down. I might even moonlight as a lift op in Tahoe for the season 
before I leave the country. Always wanted to work the resorts one year and 
go back to college fuck off years mode. =)

I just started a new job this week, so i cant go
tomorrow, but sierra is opening tomorrow (friday) with
$5 lift tickets, and $44 on saturday.. tomorrow would
be a steal to board for $5! 

i'm getting a season pass to northstar/sierra, and
would totally be down for weekend day trips, just not
the next two weekends :) 

love and hugs and kisses,

Subject: [sfraves] Perhaps the strangest thing that's happened to me so far this campaign...

	Last night I met a woman at the Qool party (111 Minna) who had just  
been at a gathering with some friends. The purpose of their gathering  
-- to discuss the ballot and ask (seriously?) "What would Starchild  
do?" in the context of a drinking game (see below). To the best of my  
knowledge, I'd never met her or any of her friends before.

	This is the sort of thing that makes all the hard work of running for  
office worthwhile.   8)

Groove on,

2004 ELECTIONS

It Takes a Strong Constitution to Run as a Libertarian

Michael Badnarik has no chance of winning, but he just might siphon key =20=

votes from Bush.
By Susannah Rosenblatt
Times Staff Writer

October 29, 2004

SALEM, Ore. =97 Michael Badnarik is hardly a household name. But some =20=

analysts are wondering if the Libertarian Party's presidential nominee =20=

=97 almost entirely absent from the national media's consciousness =97 =20=

might be pulling a Ralph Nader on the right.

Could Badnarik, a 50-year-old computer programmer from Austin, Texas, =20=

cost President Bush a key state or two by attracting the votes of some =20=

conservatives, much as Democrats worry about Nader siphoning liberal =20
voters from Sen. John F. Kerry?

At the least, Badnarik's potential appeal to some conservatives is =20
undeniable.

Gun rights? Check. Free trade? Check. Lowering taxes? Badnarik wants to =20=

scrap the Internal Revenue Service. In fact, he would like to abolish =20=

most of the federal government, along with public schools and welfare.

Badnarik got the Libertarian nomination after driving across the nation =20=

and explaining to audiences why he should be president, occasionally =20
running out of cash to keep going.

Helped by an impressive debate performance in May at the nominating =20
convention in Atlanta, Badnarik beat out two better-known opponents, =20
producer Aaron Russo and talk show host Gary Nolan.

"To say I was a dark horse in the campaign is a blatant =20
understatement," Badnarik said recently while traveling to a speech at =20=

Willamette University in Salem, Ore.

Since his nomination, Badnarik has visited 42 states, secured ballot =20
access in 48, raised nearly $1 million, and left some pollsters =20
wondering about his possible effect on the election.

In a race in which a state or two is "decided by a hair," Badnarik =20
"could be the kingmaker," said Larry Jacobs, director of the 2004 =20
Elections Project at the University of Minnesota's Humphrey Institute.

Jacobs said the Libertarian ticket would be fortunate to draw 1% of the =20=

vote nationwide. But "there may be a few battleground states where =20
they're able to reach 1% or even 2% =85 perhaps tilting the [state] in =20=

John Kerry's direction," Jacobs said.

He cited Wisconsin as a possibility.

For his part, Badnarik has zeroed in on New Mexico and Nevada. He has =20=

aired television ads in both =97 $60,000 in New Mexico, about $50,000 in =
=20
Nevada =97 and visited them.

The 33-year-old Libertarian Party espouses fiscal conservatism and a =20
dramatically reduced federal government, coupled with social =20
progressivism, all under the umbrella of personal freedom.

Like any good Libertarian, Badnarik is a fan of the Constitution =97 so =20=

much so that he developed an eight-hour Constitution class that he =20
sometimes taught on the campaign trail to raise cash.

"We have this really crazy idea that the Constitution actually means =20
something," Badnarik said.

He advocates the rapid removal of U.S. troops from Iraq, arguing that =20=

America is "not supposed to be policeman of the world." He disagrees =20
with the Bush administration's doctrine of preemption and would attack =20=

nations harboring terrorists only if presented with clear evidence of a =20=

threat.

He also said that if the passengers aboard the planes that crashed into =20=

the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001, had had guns, the terrorists =20=

"wouldn't have gotten past the beverage cart."

Badnarik favors legalizing drugs and considers a constitutional ban on =20=

gay marriage "bigotry." Abortion is a stickier question among =20
Libertarians, and Badnarik describes the party as split on the issue.

David Robinson, 26, an assistant manager at a Burger King, was among =20
about 40 supporters standing in the spitting rain at a recent Badnarik =20=

rally on the Capitol's steps in Salem.

He said he might have voted Republican were it not for the federal =20
budget deficit that the Bush administration had incurred. "If the =20
Republicans walked their own talk in terms of fiscal responsibility, =20
then I could vote for more Republican candidates. But they don't =20
nationally," Robinson said.

The Bush campaign is not concerned about Badnarik's possible effect on =20=

the president's reelection chances.

"We're focused on the contrast between President Bush and John Kerry," =20=

campaign spokeswoman Tracey Schmitt said.

The Libertarian Party's national numbers are small: Only 600 hold =20
elected office nationwide, and the party garnered about 400,000 votes, =20=

or .36%, in 2000.

Badnarik has struggled to make his voice heard. He was arrested with =20
Green Party presidential hopeful David Cobb three weeks ago trying =20
enter the second presidential debate at Washington University in St. =20
Louis, but the stunt hardly made news.

"Michael has jokingly said we'd have to set ourselves on fire in the =20
middle of the street to get attention," said Badnarik's assistant, Jon =20=

Airheart. "Of course, that only works once."

I haven't seen the dude in years, but it was the
baseball hat in the pic that got me thinking.  Plus, I
could kinda picture him doing the Lynndie on some
chic's ass. 

http://badgas.co.uk/lynndie/michelle.jpg

and more Stealth Lynndie pics at 
http://badgas.co.uk/lynndie/  

I'm sure it's played out by now, but I'm catching on a
few months late as always.

Subject: [sfraves] wackest Stealth Lynndie yet (NRR/Halloween)

How about an entire platoon of Lynndies for Halloween?
 Tan v-neck T shirt, desert combat pants, boots, and a
cigarette.  

Anyone interested for a group assault / genital
mocking?   We could stealth Terry while he's engrossed
in his laptops.
  
who's got tickets and LSD?    I have wine and 16 balls
the light up when you bounce them.  Looking to get rid
of at least 14.

Oh yeah, almost forgot... here's the wackest Stealth
Lynndie yet.  (Sorry, I'm slow getting into this
thing):

in a tree and shot, Bentong, Malaysia"

Yup, I've been up since dawn.  The committee that
meets in my head had an emergency sunrise caucus.  

5 - 1 vote in favor of the "My Life Sucks and Everyone
Must Hate Me and Things Will Never Get Better" bill.  
 :oD.  

That bill was sponsored by the Think of Everything
You've Ever Done Wrong in Your Life Organization.

I would have posted messages earlier, but I didn't
want to wake anyone up.  Ha ha.

Time for lunch.  Too bad nothing's open yet.

I'm not just the president of Boomerang's
Broken-Hearted Bachelors Club, I'm also a member.  :oD

Happy Halloween,
Spooky Boomy

Subject: [sfraves] Jesus, another Halloween idea

So, watching "Passion of the Keee-RIST!" isn't the
thing to do if you need cheering up or a peaceful
night's sleep.  But is does inspire awesome costume
ideas.

If anyone's good at makeup, you should go as Gibson's
bloody, lacerated Christ.  Man, there's nothing like
watching a guy getting the bejeezus whipped out of him
for 126 minutes.  

To complete the Gibson version, moan and grunt
frequently. Remember, you're only human.

Here's a rad picture to get you started:

hello, this is a continuation of a fictional piece:
 
"what are you doing for halloween, ig?"
"i'm waiting for my candy delivery. what are you doing, sweet thing?"
"'im going to spend as much time with a bunch of dorks as i can. hopefully, someone will spend as much time as possible making fun of me, and maybe they might even hurt my feelings and not care."
"sounds interesting."
"maybe you should go, and i should wait for the candy since that is where you are at."
"i guess so, but also, i am actually going through a really wierd growth spurt which makes me really fictional."
"cool. guess we get to live happily ever after just like the story says."
"as soon as the candy is here." :)

I'll be heading out later as well, I can't wait. Anyone going from the south bay area? Just trying to figure out how to get back home afterwards since Bart stops running pretty early on. I'll help out with gas $$. Email me privately if you are heading towards Burlingame and willing to help. Thanks!

Thrives their helter-skelter play.

BROKER/DEALER [LIVE] - SAN FRANCISCO, CA

Equipped with an array of samplers, sequencers and vintage synthesizers,=20
San Francisco wunderkinds Broker/Dealer make catchy minimal electronic=20
music equally suited for the den or the dancefloor. Simultaneously=20
channeling the aquatic dub of Berlin's Chain Reaction label and the=20
genre-defining minimal techno of the Kompakt imprint, on their debut=20

artists like Mike Ink, not to mention Metro Area's innovative=20

=20
their new 12" single on Ghostly's Spectral label. The duo will perform a=20
special live set in honor of the release along with celebrating the=20
Dealer's 30th birthday!


JEFF SAMUEL [DJ] - SEATTLE, WA

Jeff Samuel's foray into electronic music began in 1995 when he first=20
witnessed a DJ set by Detroit's Claude Young in Columbus, Ohio.  He was=20
then introduced to that city's ele_mental collective, an inspiring core of=
=20
artists which included Ohio artists Titonton Duvante, the Archetype and=20
Todd Sines among others.  Through their concept-oriented events which=20
showcased the finer points of electronic music, he became enthralled and=20
began to DJ in 1996.  Soon after, he purchased his first synth and drum=20
machine.

While attending college in 1997, Jeff began exploring the possibilities of=
=20
software-based music production where he saw greater possibilities for=20
creativity and workflow.  He encountered much scrutiny for attempting to=20
make techno using only a computer.  Nevertheless, by 1998 he had started=20
to create his own completed tracks using an early version of Fruityloops=20
(now FL Studio).  Music from his first demo was signed to the German label=
=20
Lo-fi Stereo.  The "Bidooba" single was released in 1999 and featured a=20
remix from Kompakt's Michael Mayer.  Other tracks from the same demo found=
=20
their way to minimal techno pioneer Daniel Bell, who released them on his=
=20
7th City label in 2001.

Jeff pushed into the new millennium continuing his DJ career, releasing=20
more music and completing his college degree in Audio Production=20
simultaneously.  2002 proved to be a significant year which saw his=20
'Digital Self' Tektite EP remixed by Ricardo Villalobos, his abstract=20
material released by UK label Emoticon, and the beginning of a long=20
relationship with Cologne-based Trapez Recordings.  He also left Ohio for=
=20
the western port city of Seattle, where he pursued a career as a Sound=20
Designer in the videogame industry.

Today, Jeff Samuel is a sought-after remixer with a heavy DJ and=20
production schedule who still finds the time to make SFX for videogames.=20
His records are played by a diverse range of the world's most talented=20
DJ's including: Richie Hawtin, Sven Vath, Ricardo Villalobos, Francois K,=
=20
Steve Bug, Akufen, Craig Richards, Mazi, Claude Young, Timo Maas, Josh=20
Wink, Electric Indigo, Michael Mayer and John Tejada.  He is also=20
currently the only American DJ represented by the elusive Kompakt=20
organization.

Friday, November 12, 2004 ** Lee Coombs - Breakfast of Champions **

In the history of SF underground parties, there is one party that has=20
become the after party to start all parties.  In the spirit of keeping=20
things fresh, fun and original, the Breakfast of Champions party was born.=
=20
It traditionally starts at 6AM, the first day of the year, with the intent=
=20
on keeping the party going for those that didn't want to stop.  A bus full=
=20
of Space Cowboys collected those filing out of the parties across San=20
Francisco, and brought them to BOC.  After a few New Years passing, the=20
party is proudly maintained by everyone who walks through the doors.

Of course this party would not be mentionable if it wasn't for the DJs=20
that have graced the decks.  Along with all the Space Cowboys DJs, we have=
=20
hosted several local & international superstars who saved their best for=20
last and played amazing sets at 9AM.  One of these DJs is Lee Coombs, from=
=20
the Fingerlickin' UK family.  His uniquely tuned styles of acid tinged,=20
bass driven breakbeats, have been the soundtrack to many a Space Cowboy=20
party.  He joined us in '02 & '04.  He proudly returns to San Francisco to=
=20
promote the 11/16/04 release of his new album entitled 'Breakfast of=20
Champions.'

We need say no more.  We're tickled pink.  And ready to rock.  Please join=
=20
us for a night with new music, old friends, at one of the undeniably best=
=20
sounding clubs in the city.

BIO: DJ MFR DJ M.F.R. resides in San Francisco, California, U.S.A. His=20
musical history began at the early age of 18 when he began to djing in=20
Rome.  M.F.R's musical influences range from reggae, hip-hop and soul, to=
=20
classic rock and jazz. In 1990 he connected strongly with the soothing=20

Moving to San Francisco in 1995, he immediately started playing in local=20

Loveworks Resident DJ Bio: MATT VALENZ In a world overtaken by automation=
=20
and technology, soul can be a hard thing to come by.  For someone lucky=20
enough to be raised on the sounds of Earth Wind & Fire, Kool and the Gang,=
=20
Diana Ross, and Tower of Power, being soulful comes as second nature. At=20
17 he was turned onto vinyl and was soon playing Miami bass, freestyle,=20
and primitive house at small underground parties in the central California=
=20
area, then moved on to start a career in the music business when he=20
relocated to San Francisco at age 21.  He continued his drive to learn=20
every aspect of the industry, and returned a few years ago from a two year=
=20

and classics in the bay area.  He continues to play at the some of San=20
Francisco's best parties and is currently assembling a personal studio.

Loveworks Resident DJ Bio: DAVID HARNESS In 1990, David began DJ'ing in=20

=20
nutritious dancefloor experience available in San Francisco. Initially=20
conceived by Dianna Jacobs and Nori Castillo of Toontown / Carefree fame=20
in the summer of '96, Loveworks was envisioned as a refuge from the=20
monotony of local clubs and superficial music, and has become one of the=20
bay area's most well known nights out, while somehow remaining one it's=20

combination of art, music, film, dance and conversation found at 111 Minna=
=20
Gallery creates a unique gathering place for a multi-sensory experience.

the middle of the dancefloor & skulls & 2 Huge screens
that showed Yummy visuals all night long above the
DJ... the side room was kinda made up like a forest I
guess... LoL... & just Awesome lighting... upstairs it
was all like big huge screen visuals =3D)  LoL  It was
total eye candy everywhere!

OK.. well.. I could like go on & sound like fluffy &
stuffy.. but it was just something I needed 2 recharge
me... LoL... yeah... & this was the mondo perfect way 2
wrap up my Birthday Festivities... LoL.. Yeah..
Perfect!!!

So y'all have a Groovy week!! =3D)

Take Care,
Peace=3D-> O=A7bY {8O)
