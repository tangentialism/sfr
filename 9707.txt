        to keep the 3 message limit thing in mind, I will combine my two
questions.

1: I heard a rumor that XLR8R magazine is going to do a review of the
Illumination party from back in May. I don't know why, but the party ended
on a very bad note. I met two of the people from XLR8R there, and I hope
they know what they are doing. It wasn't my party, but I am good friends
with the people who threw it, and they tried their best. I would've done a
few things differently, but lots of people flaked out on them, and it really
hurt things. I thought the party was getting REALLY good, the vibe was
there, the music was getting good, and it's too bad things had to end the
way they did. 

2: I am finally confident enough to spin at parties that aren't my friends
parties. How do I get things rolling, basically? I have spun enough to know
that I can do it, and I have a mixtape in works once I can borrow my
friend's professional dubbing deck. Is distributing a mixtape a good way to
get 'noticed'? God, I hate doing all this stuff. Maybe I should just stick
to spinning at friends parties, it's easier and I don't care about not
getting paid since I already have a job.

The south bay lunch is still on, we're just not having it on Tuesday,
because it's a bad day for some of us.  The whole gang is letting Branka
decide what's best for them.  Branka?  Are you there?

Okay... well... I think it's Thursday, and I think it will be Chinese, but
I can't be sure.  So if your name is Branka and you care, call me.

Also: this week in Santa Clara...

Wednesday at City Espresso on Steven's Creek @ Lawrence Expwy from 8-10pm

_Slow_Roasted_ brings you Matt Schmitt and Hak *408*.....
Say hi to friends or make new ones or just look dramatic drinking coffee
by yourself, and listen to some of the finest musics from nice people
while Alex tries to keep turning the volume up.  It's fun.  Try it.
You'll like it.

Sorry folks.  I failed.  I wanted to have the lunch on Thursday, and I
thought it would be a good plan, but some people wont be here cause they
don't have to work or just took the day off for 4th of July.  If you all
want we can still have it Thursday and gather as many people that are
working that day or not.  I'm really busy these days at work so I haven't
had any real time to get it all together.  Could the people interested let
me know if you all are interested for Thursday and where is a good place?
If not then we can wait till next week and I promise to do better at
planning it out...

Have a wonderful day,


   S       i       p       h       o       n

People -

Went to MAD last night & had a really fun time, despite only staying for
about an hour.  Sho spun some nice, really crunchy stuff - I ate it right
up (with a tall glass of rice milk to wash it down :)

Mostly just wanted to express sincere thanks to the MAD people!  MAD has
been an institution for as long as I've been in the city - if your
weekend hadn't been enough for you, you could always go expend the last
of that energy at the Bahia on Monday :)

I don't know where I'll go to boogy on mondays anymore, but MAD's shoes
will be hard to fill.  Thanks!  And I'll try to be out for the last couple
of action-packed MADs... see you there!

Hey all you smilies out there,

   Well, I'll make this story short: My close friend has this bombin'
apartment in San francisco that she is subletting for the summer, but
 just this weekend, her roomate decided to leave San Francisco forever
 after a bad experience she had on Friday, after happy kids.
Baisically, the point is that now my friend will be stuck with her 
roomate's half of the rent for the rest of the summer(July and August)
if she doesn't find a new roomate pronto! She cannot afford to cover
 this cost and she needs to find someone to move in as soon as
 possible. 

     My friend's name is Ibukun, she's a beautiful raver girl in 
desperate need of a new roomate( that's female ) Sorry guys :( The 
place is on Fulton street in the Richmond district, right above the 5
busline( very convenient :) ) It's two bedroom, with a kitchen,one bath
, walk in closet, and a little balcony(aka: the fire escape with a bomb 
ass view of the ciy! The neighborhood is safe and the apartment is very 
clean and ultra cute and the rent is only $233 a month! This place is
only available for rent for the remaining months of summer and then the 
original 
owners will be moving back in and Ibukun will return back to school. 
So, if anyone is interested in renting this shared room or know of 
anybody who is interested in this opportunityfor the rest of the
 summer, email me back and I'll call you to talk more about the 
apartment...


Please be prompt in responding because this is kind of an emergency 
situation that needs to be taken care of ASAP :) Let's all of us try to 
help out this fellow raver because she needs our help and if we can all 
work together I'm sure we can help her :) Lots of hope and lots of love!
       
                               Peace,Love, and Sparklies,

Hi,
Tickets will be available at the door only. Since ULTRA is going to be a
weekly, there's no real justification for us to do pre-sale. Though, we are
going to start early, and that means 9p!!! Since there will usually be 2 -3
headliners... each night. On another note, for the month of August, we have
confirmed, Talvin Singh, DJ Rap and DJ SS on three seperate nights :) In
the works are Fila Brazillia (Pork recordings), Thievery Corporation and
more ALL at ULTRA!!!

Greetings,

I am searching for an establishment in the Bay Area that still sells
the  plastic sleeves for CD's.  

I am interested in the CaseLogic, (or was it the ProLogic?) sleeves that
leave room for the liner notes.

I hate jewel cases,

Diana

Right on!  

MAD has been a great habit, I will miss you MAD guys.

I will not miss the last MAD, or even the second to last MAD!

~~~~ reminiscing  harp music here~~~~~~

My first MAD.

Matt Lanier had a Monday Night Dinner at his apartment, I brought a
friend, we all ate the best food; Shawna made the most incredible salad,
I think, (or was it vegi-lasanga?)

The guy across the street watched a porno, naked in his living room, as
we each typed our portion of an email to sfraves on Matt's wireless
laptop.

We got to MAD just in time to get in for 2 bucks, I dropped an *,
realized with horror that "nobody does * at a MAD!" I was mortified
beyond words as my friends sat there looking at me, wondering when I
would peak.  The * turned out to be bogus; or rather, my particular
biochemistry rendered it so...

We all walked down the street to get donuts as I figured out that I
liked a certain guy...

The music was sooo great that night!  (I used to feel nervous dancing in
front of others - but MAD nights broke me of that self consciousness.)  

MAD, to me, has always represented a "pure" appreciation for the SF rave
scene.  The only way I can explain that better is to say that it wasn't
about posing, costumes or stuff like that, (not saying that those things
are bad,) but rather, MAD had/has a "family feel" that was so _comfy_
that we didn't even think to worry about what we looked like as we
communed and danced with friends.  

I wish I understood the lingo better to describe the music that I heard
at MAD.  All I can say is the music _never_ sucked.  

I can tell you that the first time I ever got high, (without drugs!) was
dancing to Sho spin some _beautiful_ housey magic...  That experience
was the first of many that convinced me that I could indeed forgo
chemical *nhancements and still PARTY. 

Anyway, enough with the reminiscence!  MAD is still here for two more
Mondays.  I propose that we have, at least, one more, (hopefully 2?)
fantastic Monday Night Din Din's, and off to MAD to show those guys our
support and the appreciation we feel for our favorite ravin' habit! (I
think Mr. M. Lanier is on the case already?)

wear it.  I will be wearing jeans, gray Nose shoes and I have long brown
hair....

Hope to see many of you there :).

SF Raves,

Hey, Have I told you lately that I love you?

I love you!

I don't know why, but I really wish I could give all of you a hug right
now.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
What the F*ck!!??  Has anyone even EVER heard me say anything like that
in this group before?  I don't even like to hug people.(I don't know
what came over me there - I'm sure I will return to my usual acerbic,
sarcastic self soon.)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
But I mean it.  

I do love all of you that make up SF Raves.

Plastic sleeves:

Berkeley and Emeryville Tower's, (all 3,) are out.
Ameoba & Rasputin's are out.
Mod Lang swears the have never carried them.

Can they be ordered?  Who the hell cleaned 'em all out?

Diana
ps Tim, Thanks for your offer, I will await your findings.

Is it because we're beautiful?  Because we rock?  Because glitter is
enough of a reason?  Because the time is right for change?  Or is it just

We've never heard you say that, but I find the notion rather commonplace
on this list.  Doesn't lessen the value.  Thanks hon.

And your friendly local acerbic, sarcastic friends will make sure this
doesn't happen again.  Diana, you're being too damn positive... how long
before you start wearing furry pants?   :)  I dunno... you might look damn
good in them fuzzy pants...

I'd like to say, that the few times I've made it out to the city on a
Monday night, I have loved Mad.  Nowhere else can I enjoy a Guiness served
by people who actually seem to be happy we are there, dance to music that
DJs like to spin and I like to dance to, and enjoy the Brazilian motif's
contrast with the sparse blips clicks and whirrs of the gorgeous music
burping forth from Gateway (they actually seem custom made for each other
after a mere two or three beers btw).

If I didn't have to be at work at 7:00 am in San Jose it would be a
regular thing, but alas... I am usually sleep deprived enough on Monday
without staying out till they kick me out of the Bahia.

fuck yah man!

I'm way psyched about this show...

I'm really curious how you're planning on doing the lineup though; are you
gonna do, like: dj, dj, dj, crash, dj, dj, etc?    

Anyone who hasn't experienced Crash Worship:  oh man, GO!  FIRE!!  DRUMS !
DEATH!  SEX!  FIRE!! WINE!  SWEAT!  DRUMS!  FIRE!  SCREAMING CHAOS!

Very fun.  Very...  there.

Satori, and the DJ lineup, is specific to the Oakland show, right?  

The SF show the following day at the Trock won't have DJ's?

    I'm fairly new to the rave scene and SFRaves.  I'm not sure what's going 
on but it seems this list took an ugly turn at about the same time a couple 
weeks ago.  Maybe it had something to do with what Foolish Fish said about it 
being astrologically tense.  (I'm also subscribed to the MW-Raves list and the
same things are happening.)
    What I do know is that even though the list may have gotten pretty nasty, 
the people are still wonderful.  I was at Area 51 on Saturday and that place 
wasn't giving me a very good vibe.  I think it because the place was so big and 
dark and the music was dark and repetitive. It kind of brought me down.  But 
then as a friend and I were getting water, I heard a bunch of people that 
sounded real happy and giving each other hugs.  Lucky me, I stumbled upon the 
SFRaves net meet.  And even though I didn't know anyone there and had only 
lurked on this list, I was welcomed into the group with hugs and smiles.  I know
I'm not good with names, so to remind those of you I did meet, I was the Asian 
guy with the butterfly glasses.  From that point on, my spirits were high, I was
feeling a positive vibe and I had a great time the rest of the night.  Just 
wanted to say thanks to the SFRaves crew that was at Area 51 for bringing me up 
and hope to see you all again real soon.  I also got to meet Ben and Iris and 
are they ever the coolest people you'll meet.  I hope we can hit a happy 
hardcore party together sometime you two.

Positive attitudes and smiles,

Lang

Along time ago (maybe '92 or '93) there was a party called Mr.Magoo's
Groove or something like that. It was in a warehouse on 2nd St between
Brannan & Townsend. Up a flight of stairs there was a room with twister
mats on the floor and walls. They were selling beer from a keg.
Does anyone remember this party? Who were the Djs? Is there a archive for
the calendar going that far back?

Hey folx--

Can anyone recommend any quality rave- and techno-related magazines?  How 
would I go about subscribing?  Remember, I live in Sacramento, so these have 
to be things I can get locally or get sent to mi casa.

Thanx bebes,

xoxo--MIccaela

I've never actually checked out this magazine, since they started sending me 
Option, instead of the now defunct UHF magazine, but I got this from Mr. 
Postman today: Option magazine.

So I paged through the thing and found one article pertaining to female dj's.  
Pretty good article, and talked about locals such as Polywog, Charlotte the 
Baroness, and *Stareyes*, so check it out.

It's Option's July/Aug 97, #75 issue.

article: p. 60- Female dj's- by Neva Chonin

At yer finer mega magazine newsracks!


Ciao, Mr. 2

What is up with that?

 You can do anything you want in the chill room. Jeeez..  I mean,
well..Anything but dead silence. They could of atleast thrown on some Jesus
Christ Super Star betweeen records, or something. Huh?

 I like didn't go anywhere to dance this week myself. Last minute plans
lead me up to my Dads house in Tracy. Met my new sister (Dads new wife's,
daughter) who was relly cool. Stayed up there all weekend. Other than that
I had a pretty crappy weekend. No, just kidding..




Sorry I missed everybodies parties though..     =[

It's all about respect..!  Oh.

You know..

E hits everyone differently. For me. It was like becoming an acid head all
over agian.

How many times have you heard someone say "I am going to have to smoke two
joints now just to get off"?  Awight then....

With um the weed...Just ask the fruity parrot "Your nose always knows"  You
never know what your getting wid the E.

"I always know what I am getting when I buy E. Maybe your just not getting
it from the right people"
 SHUT-UP! Oh...Sorry.



I don't know. But I do know that E took me way down, there for awhile.

But the weed....Just a major "de-modivator"  Which kinna sucks. Expecially
when your always around un-modivating people. I need some modivation from
time -to- time.




Lets just figure out what were going to do..BEFORE we fire it up. OK?

anybody remember that last year at about this same time SFR seemed to be 
falling apart from some horrible flame wars and then magically everybody 
came back together?
:)
Maybe when the flames start up again, we will remember that it's just 
part of the cycle and we'll get back to loving each other again more 
quickly. :)
Or, I can send a positron emition that will trigger somethign in Data's 
positronic 'net and cause him to bring up the number 3 everywhere...

I was reading posts on the alt.rave newsgroup, and there was one about 
popsicles at raves.

I thought this would be a good idea.  How come popsicles aren't sold at raves 
(or at least the ones I've been to)?  I bet they would sell!

popsicles at raves =
sticky ass floors in the morning. now this isn't all that bad if you're 
into mopping, but what if your party has carpeting? it's bad enough to 
deal with cigarette burns and gum in the carpet..
sticky ass walls too, i'm sure.. sticky ass ravfers with sticky grime on 
them ...
popsicles at raves would be cool other than the stickiness factor.. 
one thing that would set it back would be a power of frozenness -- 
either rent a mini-freezer, or get a buncha dried ice, throw it into a 
huge cooler and pile the popsicles ON :)
	ice cream would be even cooler, cookies n cream.. or mint 
chip.... MMMMMMM

Greetings n stuff all

I have been watching all the words flow thru sfrave recently
about the lack of atmospere, decorations etc and the posts
n stuff about theme partys and then there is my project,
the art partys which is still looking for space and time
which I may not have until after this beautiful summer
that we are all enjoying. So I was thinkin n stuff
about how all these ideas could come together.

Maybe we could do a pre-party art party
to decorate these places and maybe bring in some 
exhibits like at the digital be-in. If that 
big chill room at area 51 could have been full
of artist, crafts people, astrologers, tarot,
massage,info booths etc ...that would have been
great fun and might even reduce the price of entrance.

what do you think? anyone interested n stuff?

Let me tell you something.  If homeboy from Michoacan, the guy with the
pushcart and flavors GALORE like pussy ever came through, I would sit
there and rap with him about Julio Cesar Chavez and how weird Zacatecas
kids are FOREVER.  I would be like, nuts to this boing dancing stuff,
bring on a Jamaica-bush flavored popsicle, and let's get down to the nitty
gritty Michoacan reality...NUF SAID.

Uh, I was at 1015, and besides some fairly un impressive house coupled
with some brother's pretty intensely incredible turntable skills, uh, I
didn't see any flying cybernetic netcast stuff.

Two other comments:

1)  that catfight at VSF was perhaps enough to make up for spending money
on the Tyson Tooth Spree.


2)  Concerning that party on 16th between Mission and S Van Ness, I just
want to say:  if you are going to make me turn away with a 2 dollar cover,
why don't you let me in free, and let me buy like 2/3 of a whiskey?

3) Oh, and while I'm counting to 2, let me say THANK YOU FUNKY TEKNO TRIBE
FOR the imminent perfection of ULTRA.  This Bay Area is well-ready for an
expedition deep deep deep adentro la selva.

Word, MAX

I have an IDEA, it came to me tryin to figure out how to get the 
fullest enjoyment out of my pacifier....get a drinking cup or something 
that will hold liquid in it( helps if it can stand on its own ) And at 
the top place your pacifier down partially into the drink-freeze & and 
voila while you wait in line you have a pop and when you get in you have 
your pacifier back!!

Please hold the applause-for when I dance.

OOO...that's a great idea!  I for one wouldn't mind having a push-pop or a
dole fruit and juice bar while I'm drippin sweat on the floor.  Out of
curiosity , how does one become a vendor at a rave?  A business license
and a phone call to the promoters?

but we pay those massive promoters $20-$25 a night.... why can't they
fuckin' use that money to decorate and stuff? I this it's BS that Area
51 didn't decorate hardly at all. The UG parties are always decked out!
I guess I'm a 'lil biased too though... I hate massives! =)

there were a few things that were very attractive and nicely decorated
at area 51 though.... the booths where they sold crap! bah....

I went there! it was at WET Studios.  there was a party at townsend the
same night, it was a Wicked.  we were going back and forth all night
long!  I love that spot.  There was a great wooden dance floor that made
it realy fun to dance on.  I don't remeber the dj's, but i totly do
remeber that room you are talking about with the couches, the tv and
fridge, that overlooks the dance floor.  the flyer was a small card with
Mr Magoo on a green swirly background.  This spot was alos used for the
very first Basics and a few other parties that i can't reacl right now,
but I thik they were either Equinox, or Detiny, andyways,thanks for
trigering that memory, much apreciated.  I might be able to look up the
dj's for you in a day or two, so check back..K :)

This is something I would also like to know, because I sort of made an ass
out of myself at Step2K one time, and I felt bad.

They were selling bananas and bottled water, but after a certain point,
they were giving the bananas away for free.  So I was grazing bananas and
bought a bottle of water JUST as a copper strolled in.  The poor lass that
was behind the makeshift counter thought Officer Puerquito was going to
fuck with her for selling me a bottle of water without a permit.  I felt
like a wingding.

But say I just wanted to SELL MY SOUL/BODY, would I need to ask
permission?

Keep it unreal,

Most parties I've been involved with at clubs don't get paid by the venue
or from bar receipts. The door's the only way to cover expenses for the
people that throw the party, bring sound, pay DJ's, etc.

	Actually, if you play "The 39 Lashes" at 45 RPM instead of 33,
it could almost be a techno song. Got to do something about the guitars,
though.

       I have an idea!. Find a vendor who wants to sell his popscicles. 
And make him plunk down a deposit. One that is big enough to cover the 
cost of cleaning any all gooey popscicle residue. 

I think _everyone_ could benefit.

I am really excited to have my old friends Dennis and Simon of SKYLAB 2000
come up to San Francisco to do a show at Nikita on Friday.  As I am playing
hostess while they are in town, I am looking for a cool thing to do on Friday
(daytime).  

If anyone is having a bbque on friday, please let us know?  

Otherwise, I think I will be throwing one myself.  I sure don't mind doing
this!   However, it is short notice and I will need a little help.   I could
probably have this bbq at the main house of the intentional community that I
live in.  It has a communal gardens area that is quite large and could
accomodate a really nice daytime event.  

If any one has input, please e-mail back asap
greta

I went to L.O.G.I.C., a Sunday weekly in LA, to see Carl Cox spin on three
turntables last winter.  I had a good club experience because of the great
music (ala Carl Cox) and the lack of gross guys trying to pick up on my
friends.  But y'know big name DJs have a tendency to bring out music
lovers, so I don't know what LOGIC is like on other weeks.

Wow . . . I'm floating right now (and at work no less) -- if you're
stuck inside, GO OUTSIDE FOR A WHILE!  The sun is shining, there's a
nice breeze blowing, and I'm listening to "Sirius Sounds" by Children
of the Bong.  This CD isn't exactly new, but if you haven't heard it
yet, you've got to check it out.  It's got those tracks that make you
feel like someone is shooting a lightning bolt down your spine (or
maybe it's just me . . .)  Have a happy day everyone!!!

Much love to all you folks --

Gary

For those of you who may have missed this post the first time around. . .

ROOMMATE NEEDED IN SAN FRANCISCO!

Our ideal roomate would be a female, or a male with a female spirit, who
can play with us, create with us, question the world, marvel at the
everyday and respect others.  They would know that it is as important to
respect uniqueness and individuality as it is to recognize
interconnectedness and universality.  We are looking for someone who is
true to themselves, intelligent, creative, & an explorer.

We are three raving, jubilant Goddesses, of varying sexuality.  We are all
self sufficient and together we form a warm and caring community.  The
house is often filled with singing, drumming & philosophizing- but it all
quiets down around 10PM Mon-Thur (hey! we've got day jobs, ya' know!).  Oh,
and there are 2 cats and a turtle on patrol at all times!  If you think
that you have a unique element to contribute to our home- give us a call!

E-MAIL: Glittergirl@value.net
Phone: 415-759-9649, hit #3 during the msg. (sometimes ya' have ta hit it a
couple of times)

RENT:  $260  UTILITIES:  $30/Mo.

Cigarette smoking in the backyard ONLY!

i thought the money went towards paying off the police...

i love big raves but i must agree i haven't been to a good massive
around here yet. so i'm beginning to understand why everybody hates
massives. why don't you do it differently then? i still have the same
complaint: the mass is not one. there is no focus, no direction in
which to dance in, nothing to bring the crowd together (no stage, no
MC). the trainspotting crowd around the dj makes it impossible for
him/her to see what's going on w/ the crowd. how can the djs have a
connection w/ the crowd like that? how can they know whether people
are dancing or not. i'm beginning to think that dancing is not really
the priority here. i found it so off-putting when i was dancing near
the speakers at one point and openend my eyes and noticed that i was
the only one dancing! oh man, and the music, although good and hard
and fast at times, became sooo monotonous rather quickly.

happy kids last friday was nice (the art of british understatement!),
nice venue, liked the carpet, nice atmosphere, good music upstairs,
and more people were dancing. and so much effort and enthusiasm from
the organizers!

the best thing about going to parties here, however, is that when ben
and i introduce ourselves to someone it sometimes happens that they
say, "oh wow, ben and iris! i've heard about you guys." it's great to
be famous! (hey jeremy, you looked liquid at happy kids)

and we've been here long enough now to always find people we know at
parties (hi to all of you). and it's such good fun to put faces to all
the names on this list (sorry if we don't remember them all after the
first meeting. but i'm sure we'll see them again)

i'm looking forward to freedom (wouldn't mind going to armageddon in
search for hardcore but it is a bit far w/o a car :)

ive been to logic once (actually to see carl cox) a while ago (by the
way. i HATE house...i don't know what i was thinking by
going!).......anyways...
it was a meat market....usda grade F beef...there were so many jarhead
(marine looking types) with there tight levis and a white button up
shirt half opened exposing their wife beater undershirts (you know the
type)...and chicks in their skimpy faux leather minidresses ...etc....

the vibe sucked..unless you were looking sleeze.

just my impression....

haven't been back yet

  I know a woman that used to work for Playskool down in L.A.  she was the
"Otter Pop Girl"  they gave her a big ice cream push-cart filled with Otter
Pops, the cool popsicles in funky colors with otter charaters on the front.
 Not only are these a nice cool-off treat, but they turn your tounge bright
colors!  She got to work right next to the velcro wall.
If I could find a decent push-cart somewhere, this is a job I'd be interested
in.  Anyone want to venture in as a popsicle vendor with me?  Just a thought,
but icey juicy stuff is a good idea.

	Hiyaz, my name is Nico (frealz) and I'm moving to Fremont in early August.
 I'm gonna have no connections out there. All I really need help with is
finding out if groups from this list meet because going to raves by
yourself is not something I wanna do.  Even though it's easy to meet
people, I'm just not all that good at it.  
	Any help is appreciated and I'll buy ya some candy for your generousity
when I'm up there.  : )

	TIA

	Nico

 HEY ALL, THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT SO PLEASE READ THIS.
        I HOPE THIS IS AS IMPORTANT TO YOU AS IT IS TO ME.
        IT'S KINDA LONG BUT PLEASE, JUST READ IT! IT EFFECTS US *ALL*
 hello, everybody, how are jou? it's me stariana. i just got back from a 
weekend of happy and grumpy kids. it was great to see all of you, and happy
to meet some new people, too. (hey, rubilicious  and mercutio!)
unforunately, there is more to this post. please, before you think badly of
this post, THINK about whether or not it pertains to you. I'M NOT FLAMING,
but only trying to open people's eyes to the BULLSHIT. so reach inside of
yourself and evaluate. 
okay, i started raving for the music and the community of wonderful people.
i felt that the people i met through raving were better than anything else i
can imagine, and my life is much happier and richer because of those people.

but this weekend, a wave of uneasiness washed over me and i was seriously
considering stopping raving, due to the feeing that seemed to overwhelm me.
there has been sooooo much that has changed, most importantly: LACK OF UNITY.
it seems that all that is important now are drugs and being popular.

people constantly speak/write plurriness, but it feels like just a front.
kinda like well "everybody thinks i am just da bomb ass motherfucker and i
am so plurry and cute and lovey" but it's a facade. you start talking shit
about someone and then that person comes up to you to give you a hug and you
act as though you are their best friend until they walk away again. it's not
like talking shit about the homie g in da corner yelling "X" but it's
talking shit about those you consider your FRIENDS. 

c'mon, people, what makes you a raver? i rave to hang out with my friends,
to dance, to play and be silly and love and meet new people. to FEEL the
music, to FEEL the vibe. can YOU feel it? can you anymore? 

you are missing the point if you go to a rave to be seen or to see how many
followers you can get and see how many people you can get with--(by the way,
dry fucking in the dance floor is NOT fun to watch) 

listen, if you are popular, i hope it is because people like you for WHO YOU
ARE, AND WHAT YOU, ALONG WITH EVERYBODY ELSE IN THE SCENE, CONTRIBUTES. that
means: BE YOURSELF, DON'T PRETEND. if people don't like you for you are,
then fuck 'em, you don't need to deal with those people anyway. they don't
need to deal with you. 

COMMUNITY AND FAMILY means working TOGETHER. you know, a team effort. we
always say that everyone is accepted in our scene. that's WHY we have our
scene, so people have a place where you can be accepted regardless of
anything. right?

i see people selling out to popularity and drugs. THAT IS BULLSHIT, STRAIGHT
BULLSHIT. and i along with others are sick and tired of it. BULLSHIT! i
don't go to a rave to hear about who's fucking who or who is a bitch/dick
etc.etc. 

remember that piece of literature passed out a happy kids #3 titled: READ THIS? 
does anybody still have this besides me? if ya got it, go read it. if
someone could post it, that would be good too. that piece of paper said
everything. IT'S NOT ABOUT DRUGS OR FASHION OR ANY OTHER BULLSHIT. IT'S
ABOUT PEACE LOVE UNITY AND RESPECT, RIGHT? RIGHT? 

        IT'S ABOUT US, TOGETHER. 

how can we not practice what we preach? plur applies to all, not just the
people who don't happen to piss you off. 

        LET'S MAKE THIS A COMMUNITY EFFORT, FROM OUR ***HEARTS***

everybody is so segregated and all we're doing is feeding the negative
energy that already surrounds our scene. we aren't sending a good message to
anybody, not even to ourselves. i want everybody to realize that if it isn't
a group effort, we won't have a community to call our own. we will be just
as bad as those who bring us down in the first place. 

don't we all want to come away from our scene with more good memories than bad?
memories of a place where we can be FREE, FREE TO BE OURSELVES, AND FREE TO
BE HAPPY. 

don't come to a rave with a bad attitude, no one wants to hear the bullshit
THINK ABOUT IT: we feed off the happiness that others emanate, so GIVE IT BACK! 
YOU GOTTA GIVE TO GET

I WANT THIS SCENE TO PREVAIL AND TO KEEP ON GROWING INTO SOMETHING SO
BEAUTIFUL THAT NOT EVEN OUTSIDE FORCES CAN KILL IT. 

        ISN'T THAT WHAT WE ALL WANT? THEN LET'S DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT,
                                *TOGETHER*

        *PEACE- NO FIGHTS, NO BAD VIBES, TRANQUILITY, NO SHIT TALKING

        *LOVE- GOOD VIBES, KISSES, HUGS, COMMON COURTESY

        *UNITY- COMMUNITY, F.A.M.I.L.Y., TOGETHERNESS, US, WE

        *RESPECT- GIVE IT TO RECEIVE IT, TREAT OTHERS LIKE YOU WANT TO BE
TREATED, EQUALITY  


if you don't like somebody, fine you don't like them. so ignore them, or
confront them and try to reach compromise. if it's not possible, again,
ignore them. remember, that someone that you hate/dislike may be friends
with someone you do like and that talking shit won't help your situation or
anybody elses, except maybe boost your low self esteem. AND WE, AS RAVERS,
SHOULDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT OUR INSECURITIES, because we are all ACCEPTED,
or at least we *should* be. 

look, i'm not writing this to be all authoritative or look like i know
everything, because i don't. i only write what i see, and what i feel.
i wouldn't write this if i didn't think it was important. i felt compelled,
as a raver to write this, to maybe get some of you who i am describing to
THINK and change. i only want to help this scene and make it beautiful as we
all want it to be. i hope hope hope i reach some of you. 

also, i didn't write this to be flamed. i am not pointing any fingers, and i
am not talking shit. all of the above is actually true. think about whether
or not you are described in this post. if you aren't, try to encourage
others who are to help contribute to make our scene hella phat. if you are,
please take  a good look and try to change. everyone will be willing to
accept your good attitude. i know i will. 

please,   CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT, UNITE UNITE UNITE! FIGHT THE BULLSHIT

THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR LISTENING.

MAD MAD LOVE GOES OUT TO ALL OF YOU FROM ME, UNCONDITIONALLY, ALWAYS. 

sugarkisses,
***stariana***

i am open for positive feedback and constructive criticism.

I've said it before and I'll say it again - the key to the massives [the ones
I've been to at least] is having a large group together so you can have your
own vibe if the overall party vibe isn't there for you.

With that in mind, I'd like to do another sfraves group hug at freedom.  Is
anyone hip enough to the location/setup to be able to suggest a place?  Water
sales booth at say 10 or so?  What do you guys think?

Holy holy holy Shit, poop of power and might, this weekend is going to
DETONATE for our causa de la selva, nuestra vida junglista.

I don't even know what to do besides give thanks to the heights:

Punckateck's got Soul from Shaolin Fist Crew in NYC, plus Abstract Noel
Spell residentially.

Friday, STEP2K's got R.A.W. from Los Angeles, SWRV from Indianapolis who
did Phunckateck last week, plus Gamekat, Noel, and Push.

There's the Stompin' party with jungle at it, Freedom, I do believe has
jungle going on, and hell *I've* got jungle going on.

Eat it!

Yours truly,
Max McCauley
Grade 5

I'm sending this a little early due to the holiday (and my busy day
Thursday).  Thanks to everyone who's been sending in info - unfortunately
I usually don't have time to respond to each one personally.  

I don't have as much stuff as I would expect for the big weekend, but Stompy
and Freedom should be big enough for everyone, and there's probably other
stuff that I just haven't heard about.  There's a couple of new weeklies of
note - check out the listings for Music Box and Ultra...

hi everybody-  

I'm leaving for Europe for about 10 months...I'll be staying mostly in 
Spain, England & Israel.....I know there is definately a scene in the UK, 
but anybody have any tips about Spain??  (I figure Israel is probably a 
long shot...)

thanks in advance!!

hey, there were these parties for a couple months in la called Smaller and
the last couple times i went, the promoters passed out popsicles for free
to everybody around 4:00 or so. it would be the coolest and most welcome
thing after a couple hours of sweatbox dancing. i trip out on the the icy
steam that emanates from the popsicle whenever i hold it up to a light or
laser.

so, i guess i dont really have a point with this post, just that popsicles
at raves are really cool!

 I think popcicles would be cool, but you need to give out those wet-nap
things so you can un-stick yourself afterwerds. And have like a place where
if you turn in your popcicle stick when your done you get a bracelet(or trade
it in for the wet-nap), to motivate people to thow them in a trashcan other
than the floor! welp my $.04 bye now

How about a theme party about creating a better world?

we could decorate the place up like a huge garden with 
tangerine trees and marsmellow clouds and
marmalade skys.

what would you want to see there?

what would you like to take there?

how would you make the world a better place?

And how can we use music to make the world a garden of eden?

Hrmmmm...ok, I don't want to sound mean or anything but It seems to me
that just maybe...your situation and time at raves right now is unlike
others? It seems as though you might be trying to get some higher meaning
out of raves then they really are? Or maybe not, that's just what I'm
readin in to. You can't really blame the Rave or the Scene in general when
bad vibes come about because there are soooo many different types of
people and sooooo many different ideas that each person has about going to
raves...
	Unfortunately, to some it's just an escape to sneak out of thier
parents house and do drugs. To others, it's a place to listen to really
cool music. Some go to hang out with friends, and some go expecting to
make new friends and are dissappionted when they find out that not
everybody else there wants to go around making friends. Some go for
this...some go for that and so on...get the point? *shrug*

	So even though it's been said a million times, I guess it always comes 
down to the same simple saying...A RAVE IS WHAT YOU MAKE OF IT. You can't 
really expect to have a good time or a good vibe hit you on the head. And 
when things are not going as well as you expected them to, you have to 
try to make the best of it. When I'm having a bad time at a rave here's 
what I usually try to do...
	1) look around at all the people who are having fun, smile, and 
	   think how cool it is to be at a party where people are having fun.

	2) Go dance...listen to the music...lock into the music. Try and 
	   stay there all night. I'm mean, hopefully you came there to dance?

	3) Try to find some of the sober people who helped put on the 
	   party, or try to find a DJ that you can talk to about the party or the 
	   scene in general, and basically make good conversation with as many 
	   people as possible.



...The most important thing is this though...It seems as though you have 
a problem with certain people who might only go to parties to do drugs. 
And from what I've scene on this list and at parties you're not alone. 
And to some extent I agree with you,...BUT, you just can't can't can't 
let that bother you because it's ALWAYS going to be there. Whether we 
like it or not, unless we start having private parties, these people who 
go to parties for the sole purpose of doing drugs are always going to be 
around. As painful as it might be, the best way to deal with it is to 
just try to not let it bother you. Stick to your friends. Stick to 
sfravers (by the way...EVERYONE remember to wear your laminants...case in 
point ) ..... and .....

Instead of being one who tries to catch on to a good vibe that isn't 
there, be one who realizes that party needs a good vibe and create 
yourself, for others to catch on too.


Well, it's late, enough blabbing, off to bed, hope this helped?

and

Staaaaaaaay Cooooooooool!

Freedom, Freedom, Freedom!!!!!! Yes, Yes, Yes!!!!!!! For all of you that
didn't have the opportunity to attend last years, or the previous years, this
is the party of all parties, around here! Last year was awesome, electrifying
and wondrous!!! If you are thinking about it, think no more, go out and get
your tix! Meeting at this party should be a trick, because of the shear
volume of people, but I suggest the bleachers, it's prolly the easiest place,
and most spacious. I shall be there, and I hope to see all of your smiling
faces there as well.......

P.S. Don't forget your camping gear, tents ARE allowed!

so i am meeting a friend of mine tomorrow night and what's better than to hang
out in the junglist ambiance. so i wanna know, should i go to milk and honey
(the minna gallery sounds like a highly interesting place. so it's a gallery
and also a club? how european! (what a snobby thing to say, forgive me)), or
should i go to phunckatech? hopefully someone'sbeen to both? oh yeah,  i went
to my first party last week, which was grumpy kids!! wow. it was so nice. you
could touch the water and watch the smoke coming out of the chimney and the
dogs were biting each other and the ppl seemed nice, though i was alone and
left early. i saw the sfpd car when i got on the bus around 1145. maybe that
was not the ones who busted, anyway. thank you!!!i had fun clutching my
shoulder bag and tried very hard to not feel too self-conscious of all those
ppl who were not dancing. to byroni, lara, kobayashi, chezmoi, and chloebb.
will write to all you soon. it's been nice to get mail from someone. i don't
know how to work my daaaaaad into going to a rave, since the hours are not good
for him (good for me!!). got a shabby turntable, and that makes me the
happiest. bye. wanna go to freedom and ultra and get a job.

Hey!

I know a whole carravan of 20 people coming up from SLO for FREEDOM and I
leave tonight for San Jose.  I'll be there.  Probably see alot of people
from the list but won't reallize it so... HI right now.  I hope the Right
Front speaker family will be in the house and all those I know from back
home are there so this should be a great party.  I've been out of the SF
scene for 2 months now and I wonder how it has changed...I hope for the
better

I probably will go to Nikita after some 4th of J festivities... Sky lab
2000 are good and I met Dennis in La - he's a cool cat.

You can recognize me buy the white glowsticks I'll have - blue hat and
DIRTY blue jeans and I'll probably bring a tent..

It has been a stressful week and this weekend should relieve me of some of it...

see ya in the promise land...

Happy 4th!

Welcome to the real world. Do you think that people, whatever scene they

Spain has lots of clubs where you'll get to strut your stuff to the latest
charttopping handbag tunes. But that's not what this is about...

Israel a long shot??? I don't think so. Israel has the best goa parties in
the world. (ok, so going to one in India might be sorta cool, but hey...)
The Israeli government actually throw huge ass raves with the most amazing
djs and live acts. My advice would be to check local newspapers and record
stores in the big cities like Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. =)

Ok, hold it right there. I don't know if you know star or not, but she's
one of the bestest people to be around at parties. She's not trying to "get
more out of raves than they really are", she's there to enjoy the LOVE that
_should_ be a huge part of the experience. Be it love for music, people, or
whatever. If you love drugs and go to parties to do them, go for it. (of 
course, I'm not saying that drugs are "good", and under no circumstances can
you hold ME responsible for anything that happens to YOU when you do drugs.)
All us other ravers can ask of you is that you're honest. Honest with yourself
as well as us. If you don't like the other people at raves, you just want
to feel the e hit you, or all you care about is the trembling bass or the
tweaks of the 303s, don't pretend that you like us only to talk smack about
us as soon as we're not there.
Is this asking too much? I don't think so. I have raved on both sides of the
Atlantic, and the scene in Europe is pretty much about either looking good or
being a musical elitist. You either wear the latest creations from Dolce &
Gabbana, Tommy (yup, he's big among Euroravers), etc, or you dance for 8 hours
straight. Where's the vibe? There is no vibe. In SF there _used_ to be a vibe.
After two years at Sonoma State, I returned to Sweden this summer. My plans
were to come back for the fall semester. When I got a offered a _very_ well-
paying job over here, I declined because I knew I'd miss the scene in SF so
much. But lately, I've heard a _lot_ of depressing things from my friends over
in CA. I'm not so sure it's a scene worth coming back to. And I really don't
think it's because I'm looking for more in the rave scene than it has to
offer,
do you?

>	So even though it's been said a million times, I guess it always comes 
>down to the same simple saying...A RAVE IS WHAT YOU MAKE OF IT. 

That's very true. But that's not the issue here. Imagine this scenario...
You go to rave X, where you talk to person A, who's hella friendly and
tells you
how much he/she loves you, and you get a really good feeling about them.
The next
day you find out that person A went around telling everyone what a pain you
are.
How can that rave be "good"? No matter how much you try to make it a great
rave,
being deceived like that will bring most people down. 

All I'm saying is...I don't care why you go to raves. We all have our reasons,
and they're all GOOD reasons. I just don't want you to do anything you
don't want
to just because you feel you have to. If you don't want to tell me you love me
when you really hate me, then don't. If you DO tell me you love me even though
you don't, please don't walk around telling people what a jerk I am. I won't
make ANYONE's evening more enjoyable.

*huggies, lots of them. and they're sincere...*

Hi ben + Iris,

I have never met you guys but I have heard about you and we know
mutual friends (Hi Jer,Ari,Beth,Jelo etc..) You get the Picture. Well
my 0.02 Cents on the trainspotting is. First off for all you Train
spotting up and coming DJ's DO NOT LOOK at what the DJ is playing
trying to hypnotize yourself by seeing what track the DJ is playing.
That is VERY disrespectfull I like for people to watch me play and
have a good time but I dont like when DJ's are trying to trainspot my
rekkids. If there is a crowd of people watching a DJ play you can be
rest assured it is because he is throwing down and 9 times out of 10
you can be sure that people are going off to the beats. Or else people
would not watch the DJ. You don't watch boring people do ya? Well that
is enough from mEE
Take care all...

Macadio

Wait, hold on a sec - "go out and get your tix"???????

I didn't know there were any presale tickets for Freedom.  Are there? 
Someone in the know please confirm or deny.  There have never been
presale tix for the Freedoms in the past that I know of...

See ya there either way!

I'd *love* a chance to hug all the sfravers again! :):)  The watering
hole is always a good spot to meet because it isn't as large as the
ambient room so we can all find each other. I do kinda think 10 is a bit
early though - especially since there is always a chance that it might
get started late (although with the Gathering I doubt it).  How bout the
usual 2 am???  Seemed to work just fine at Area 51.  

love,
Amy

Trainspotters make me extremely nervous.  Mostly because I'm generally
pretty self-conscious and hate to have people staring in my general 
direction...but also because of exactly what Iris + Ben say above.

But I trainspot too, at times, if I hear a track I really like...so I had
an idea while driving to work this morning.  If you're the type of DJ who
plans their set out in advance, why not post the set list where trainspotters
can see it?  That way they can get the track and label names and then 
get out of the way.  (Of course, this only applies if you're not the kind
of DJ who tapes over the labels on all their records to prevent some sort
of state secret from leaking out.)

I know a lot of DJs spin by the seat of their pants, or only plan out the
first few mixes, but I also know a number of them plan out the whole set
(with a few alternate paths in case a change of direction or mood becomes
appropriate).

Opinions?

Another thing that helps break up the "wall of non-dancing voyeurs" is
for the DJ to convince their friends that it is absolutely necessary for
them to come dance right in front of the tables during their set :-).  And
finally, if the DJ himself/herself dances behind the tables, the trainspotters
get caught in this weird vortex of happy motion and hopefully get the point.
Oh yeah, and I've even been known to lean over the tables, make little
shooing motions with my hands, and smile and say "go dance!  it's more fun
that way!"

> HEY ALL, THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT SO PLEASE READ THIS.

Hello Stariana-

I just wanted to point out a couple of inconsistancies with your post, or
somehow help you to see that things aren't as bad as you may think.

For one, the negativity that you are now feeling and the vile things you
are seeing at raves now has really been here the whole time. It always has
been here and it always will be. I encourage you to go into the sfraves
archives on hyperreal and read about people saying these exact same things
about the scene in 1992, and in 1993, and in 1994, and in 1995, and in
1996, and now in 1997. About how the initial love is gone and all people
care about now are the drugs and being hip.

and likewise, obviously the cool and wonderful things about raving has also
been here the whole time, and always will be. At the same time as one half
of the people are talking about how negative things are getting, there's a
whole other group who insist that today is the brightest day their eyes
have ever witnessed.

So what's going on... well frankly, it's you. It's not them or the scene.
Everything begins and ends with you. And when you started out you were
amazed at this new way of looking at things, of this new way of interacting
with people, of listening to music and expressing who you are. You chose to
see all the wonders of the good things, and so things were all just great.
But the drugs were still there. The guys in the corner with shifty eyes
whispering X out of the corners of their mouth were there. The cluster of
girls were there in another corner giggling about how outdated girl X's top
was, and how slutty she must be, and the smarmy 24 year old guy was there
macking on clueless 14 year old girls. and Joe Pistol kept getting in Bull
Dog Pete's face about how someone's ass was grass.

But you didn't see those things. You saw the incredible unity of love and
how people's energy can be connected together and how this can propel your
soul upward into other realms and other understandings of the universe. But
then that slowly got old and you started seeing what else was going on. and
it looked like everything that was initially so good was turning sour.

>people constantly speak/write plurriness, but it feels like just a front.
>kinda like well "everybody thinks i am just da bomb ass motherfucker and i
>am so plurry and cute and lovey" but it's a facade. you start talking shit
>about someone and then that person comes up to you to give you a hug and you
>act as though you are their best friend until they walk away again. it's not
>like talking shit about the homie g in da corner yelling "X" but it's
>talking shit about those you consider your FRIENDS.

There's a saying, you are what you pretend to be. So what are you really?
both nothing and everything, except when your pretending... People who
write plurriness are plurryness. Who are you to say that plur doesn't exist
for them and to call them liars. Just because you've lost sight of that
plurry feeling doesn't mean it no longer exists. You signed off your post
saying that you love unconditionally. I seem to feel quite a bit of
conditions in the things you've said, and the ways you're describing all
these other people. You first thought that "ravers were better than
everyone else"... well right there you started off with a condition that is
bound to lead you into trouble somewhere. and what about the person who
gets high and becomes your best friend for a night, and the next day talks
shit. Do you no longer love them... well, perhaps that's why they no longer
love you. People make those kind of drastic changes when you set conditions
on them, and expect them to behave a certain way. They must come to
dissapoint you, because people must always maintain their freedom, and
break through all expectations, good and bad. And then what happens when
you write people off as bad... well, you will no longer give yourself the
opportunity to see the good sides of that person that made them be your
best friend for a night.

>c'mon, people, what makes you a raver? i rave to hang out with my friends,
>to dance, to play and be silly and love and meet new people. to FEEL the
>music, to FEEL the vibe. can YOU feel it? can you anymore?

Can you feel it anymore? When you did feel it did you know what made some
people ravers and some people not? no, you didn't. The reasons you mention
for being a raver are great, but greater than other people's reasons...
must everyone have the same reasons to be a raver, to be a part of unity...
I certainly hope not, or thing would get very boring very fast. The times
when you do feel it are the time when you stop judging and start feeling
all the other things that people and things are. It's not already knowing
what they are and what they should do, it's totally not knowing. That's
where the magic is. My best advice to you is to put all your established
rave notions back in the closet and start from scratch again. The goodness
is there, the challenge for you now is to find the strength to just let
yourself see it, and to make the leap of faith required for you to believe
it.

Don't worry so much about getting the support of the collective and
fighting the bullshit and making everyone go the way you want them to go.
Just be yourself and give yourself the strength to be who you ideally
envision yourself to be, that's all and nothing else, and you will find
that everyone and everything else will follow.

Again, everything, and I do mean everything, begins and ends with you.

and you're not alone in this struggle. I think you'll find that almost
everyone who has been a part of the scene for a while has had to deal with
this collapse of the initial goodness in some way. Some people choose to
leave completely, and some choose to reach way deep within them to find the
strength to push through the darknesss.

good luck-

-john.

*delurking*

I have to concur with Laura on that one.  Trainspotters (at least the ones 
who stare intently at the booth, just waiting to see you screw up, do tend 
to get me out of "the zone" which allows me to achieve anything approaching 
decent mixing.

However, I must admit that I, too, am guilty of the more-than-occasional 
trainspot.  As often happens, you'll go out, hear this fleeting track which 
has eluded your grasp for many a week, and have the opportunity to find out 
"What the hell is that thing?"  That being said, I like to think I'm pretty 
concious about the whole "rude" thing.  If checking out a track means 
totally getting into the DJ's face, then I don't do it.  Period.  I like 
the setup at Stompy (held at club VSF) because you can stand behind the DJ, 
see the record, and they never even knew you were there.  Otherwise, I try 
to grab a glimpse from off to the side of the booth.

The other side to the debate about trainspotting seems to surround the 
protective nature DJs have towards their tunes.  I think that's bullshit. 
 A good track isn't "yours".  Number one, it belongs to the producer who 
spent hundreds of hours getting the thing done, not the DJ who stumbled 
upon it.  Number two, tracks are extremely perishable.  By the time any of 
us poor souls get our hands on the good tracks (when they go to wide 
release) the big name DJs have already had their way with them, and they're 
all "played out".  To think that "secret weapon" tracks will give you a 
"competitive edge" is immature, selfish, and most of all, naive.

End rant.

Oliver

Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.org

Hello all -

I'm heading out to Southeast Asia in a month or two. I've heard that the
Thai beaches are kinda like Goa with full moon parties and full-on beach
raves.... was wondering if anyone had been out there recently and knew
where I should go to find said parties? I've also heard that the police
have been pretty harsh on cracking down on them....Any opinion on the scene
out there? See or skip?

thanks,
Janelle

     I think what John Darrow had to say was pretty right on, at least I 
     related to it.  
     
     Often times you see all the good things in an activity, or person, 
     first then start to notice those aspects that you may find less 
     appealing.  For me, I adapted by realizing that these aspects were 
     there before I ever came on the scene, and will continue to be 
     present, so just appreciated and enjoyed the more appealing aspects.
     
     This reminds me (jumping on a little soapbox for a moment) of 
     relationships in a way.  When you first start dating someone you often 
     see mostly the good side of the person and all is fun with no 
     disagreements.  As it is with all people there is both a "good" and 
     "not so good" side to an individual.  After a time you begin to notice 
     that not-so-good side and have to deal with that.  Either severe the 
     relationship if it's just not going to work for both of you or try to 
     overcome the negatives.  There's no one right way, obviously, just the 
     way that you choose.  (clarification...when I use "you" in this 
     paragraph I'm really referring to me since you may have a different 
     viewpoint.)
     
     Off soapbox...I just (and really still am) went through this 
     experience recently so felt like tossing this out in response.
     
     Have a great holiday !
     
      - Robert
     
     P.S., after nearly a year of being off SFRaves I have returned (run 
     for it!), but with a new email address.  (though I'll unsub for the 
     weekend since dealing with 500 or so emails on Monday would be a 
     bitch.)

pour it on baby.  the dykes were in full force behind my curtain at 
Warmth -2-.  And i had such a...flowing set that night.  

we ought to have a rave where at 3am EVERYONE is encouraged to take 
their shirt off.  oh, wait.  boomerang's friends tried that.  but the 
house they did it in was too crowded.  promoters, remember that.  too 
crowded is my pet peeve.  unless we're all naked.

sorry :)  recently hyperreal.org change to hyperreal.org for some reason...
no one really said anything about it either.  I figured maybe my emails to
hyperreal.org weren't getting through, so I sent to the other address also
without removing the first one - sorry :)

<delurking as well>
funny this should come up...
i was one of the original sfraves list folks back in '92 and '93... and i
just recently got back on the list 4 years later b/c i was curious what was
going on these days on the list. first thing i noticed was that things
didn't seem to change.... there was still a lot of bitching about big
massives, of bad vibes and too much posing. but there was also still a lot
of talk about peace and love and unity and the joy of community and unity.

hey star - i'm sure i posted almost identical posts as you're posting 4-5
years ago. i still bitch about how much better it used to be. yet, i'm
still going out (albeit, never a massive). the key is finding a scene
within our the now-pretty-much-mainstream rave scene which becomes your
home. fact is, the scenes so big these days that there are tons of folks
that won't share your love vibes - they're just bored folks looking for a
place to get fucked up. so find your own friends, carve your own niche, and
stay away from the places that offer those bad vibes.

it's never as good as it was in the beginning.

Absolutely--I think it's pretty childish if a DJ shields his record
collection out of fear that someone else will then 'know his/her song',
especially since DJing is built upon the very principle of making music
out of other people's music!

Earlier, a sfraver wrote:

The other side to the debate about trainspotting seems to surround the
protective nature DJs have towards their tunes.  I think that's bullshit.
 A good track isn't "yours".  Number one, it belongs to the producer who
spent hundreds of hours getting the thing done, not the DJ who stumbled
upon it.  Number two, tracks are extremely perishable.  By the time any of
us poor souls get our hands on the good tracks (when they go to wide
release) the big name DJs have already had their way with them, and
they're
all "played out".  To think that "secret weapon" tracks will give you a
"competitive edge" is immature, selfish, and most of all, naive.

	That would be cool, would feel less out of place if that
happened. I have been at raves inside warehouses that got hot where
other women got down to their bra's (never wear the things myself),
and one time saw another woman get totally topless, but usually it is
just me...

	Yeah. Mine are raves that give out the location more than an
hour or two before it starts, or who advertise outside of SFraves and
their own personal crowd of followers. Not to be ageist, but I am not
all that interested in going to parties where the average age is under
18... Been there, done that, had people try and slip me a roofy... Not
to mention people who don't know what "dyke" means...

I was in Thailand for 3 weeks this last January (the cool season - man,
do I pity you!) and unless you have somebody who speaks Thai you are
going to be S.O.L.
I spent 2 weeks in Bangkok and if you do not know where to look for such
things (flyers, stuff like that) you probably won't find anything.
Granted, I was there to meet my fiancee's family and I wasn't there
necessarily to party, but I was seriously on the look out for something 
cool to go to.
I suspect that most of these beach raves (if they truly exist on a
regular basis) are organized by people that are not native to Thailand.
The other thing is this: When you go out looking for these types of
parties here, you usually go to record or DJ stores or cool clothing
outlets where people know what is going on. In Thailand those places are
almost impossible to find (I looked unsuccessfully) and record stores
are completely non-existant.

Anyway, if I was you I would look for U.K. sponsored stuff where they
have special events booked over there or something. I wouldn't wait to
get to Thailand to find out.

	Ok, I'm sorry about all this but you've completely misread me. I haven't 
met Start and I'm sure she's a really cool person ( with definately a 
cool name :) ) and she did say in her post that she did not want to be 
flamed and I did take note of that and had no intentions a flaming 
what-so-ever. I might have completely misread her too, I havent been in 
the scene for long, and I was just simply trying to help. I thought maybe 
she had a bad time at a rave and wanted to give her some ideas on how to 
turn it into a good time. 

	On the other hand here, I feel I have just been persecuted by you 
for something that is very unlike me. Everything you've discussed here in 
your post...telling people I love them when I don't really, Call people 
friends then calling them jerks behind thier backs, acting a certain way 
or doings things just to fit in at raves...are things that I would NEVER 
do, and those who know me can vouch for me. So like I said, you 
completely misread me, and the opening paragraph in my post was simply a 
suggestion...once again, I was only trying to help. In fact, I think it's 
pretty safe to say that everyone on this list is trying to help, and 
maybe we should all ( including myself ) think a little about that before 
we blame, flame, reply, or whatever.

One other thing...

Take into account that unless one is a perfect writter, it's very 
difficult to get the exact messages and the exact emotion that he or she 
want's to express out onto thier post. Before replying, please everyone 
make sure you've read the entire messege thouroughly and have a really 
good understanding of what the person is tryin to say...I know that 
sometimes I don't do this...but I think I'm going to start reading into 
post carefully from now on.


Thanks, and...

Staaaaay Cooooool

Dear All;

	If this is a repeat please disregards as I haven't seen my original come
back yet. Dis is where you can find me these days, I should be here for a
little while until I eventually return to California. I'm healthy, wealthy,
wise & relocated to parts; cause parts is parts and this is no life east of
the Bay Area so I won't bore you with the details of my location. 

	It's my B-Day on the 4th of July, and I'll be 35; and I'm depressed at the
moment that I won't be out on the West Coast to celebrate it with you all.;
I'm hopeing that this dark cloud that's over me will past soon. I'm sick
with the flu from all the AC they have out here that I haven't been in for
many years.

	Hope you all have a wonderful and safe fourth of July, and you are missed.

Peace
Brian

Hi everyone!  I've been more or less lurking for a while now, and I 
haven't yet had a chance to meet any of you. =(   However, I'm pretty 
sure my boyfriend, another friend, and I are going to be at Phunckatech 
tonight (I've never been), so if any of you are gonna be there PLEASE 
come up and say "hi!"  I'm not sure what I'm gonna wear, but I will have 
my little blue vinyl happyface backback with my SFRaves laminate attached 
(Orson was kind enough to send me one)!  I'm 5'9" and have longish light 
brown/blondish hair.  We're friendly, I promise!

Love an' hugs,
Amy (a.k.a. Lotusmoon Trancedancer)

P.S.  My lil alien friend says "hi!" ---->       <(*_*)>

It's good to hear that I'm not the *only* girl that occasionally gets topless
at raves - I hardly ever see it.

Take it off, babes!

Okay - here's the deal.  Yes, there is free water.  All sfraves who are
interested come to the MAIN water dispension place at 2am - per usual.  I'll
try and come by there on the hour after midnight [so that's 12, 1 and then 2],
so if anyone wants to hook up before then we can.

See y'all there!

Freedom hugs - yeah...

Don't worry, you're not going crazy. There's a filter set up at hyperreal
that changes any instance of hyperreal[dot]com to hyperreal.org in all
email going through the box.

Hahaha, my master brainwash plan has worked!  I will force you all to
forget hyperreal .com ever existed!

Actually I have a filter on mailing list mail to enforce the change.  I'll
probably turn it off soon, I just had it there to help avoid problems with
double-posts, etc.

It was changed to .org to better match the mission of hyperreal, which is
not run as a commercial enterprise.

The party actually starts sat afternoon so 2am might be a bit late in
this case.

I would like to suggest the water bar at 2 hour intervals starting at 8pm

I will be working at the door so I will miss the gathering again...maybe
I 
can make one of them . I was 20 ft away from the hug circle at area
51 in the smart bar but couldnt come over because we were too busy =(

Hope to see you all there and bring warm clothes and dust
masks...hint...hint.

><{{{"> <"}}}><

foolish fish

Anyone interested in a gathering in SF to watch the fireworks...we could
bring 
boom boxes for a mini-rave

We need a SFraves flag...who has design ideas?

Hello all!

I just had an idea of having a tent designated  as the sfraves meeting
spot, so that way thorought the whole night people can come by and meet
each other and what ever.
I want to make a banner on canvas with a sfraves design on it, so it can
be easily seen.

If anyone on the list is interested in providing a tent or sending me a
TIFF file of a cool design, email me and hopefully we can make this
possible. 

see you all there, 

Pete
=)

guess. we just really wanna go, and we live in oakland. so yeah....please let
me know! love-all.

Freemont specificly, by myself and i have no one to go with me to freedom

forever thankful:)! Thank you all!

I agree with ten possibly being too early. I for one don't like to get to a
party too early, though with Carlos doing the sunset ceremony I'll prolly be
there at 5:45ish :::grin::: can't miss Carlos! I think 2 is about perfect,
and the watering hole is a place that we can all find and know quite easily.
Even though I just signed into this community I can't wait to meet all of
you, and feel the PLUR, in person, that I feel through my comp. Blind love to
you all, and PLUR from way down deep!

Ok ok, ok ok, wait! Why don't we just make it a tradition of our own, that at
3am we take off our shirts! Not like a one time thing, but every party we go
to, that way everyone might figure out what we're doing, and after a few
parties they might start joining in, and in about a year's time we could have
the whole party shirtless at 3 am sharp!! It would be ought of this world!
That would be Unity!!!! Just a thought....

Oh my god, my heart is in the bottom of my shoes right now. This is NOT
normal activity is it?? I mean, Star came out with a feeling that she was
having, and thought to bring it to everyone's attention, not intending to get
negative feedback from people who, it seems to me, think that they are better
than her! I haven't been in this community long, but I am appolled at the
responses that Star has gotten! Don't berate her for speaking her mind, don't
ever berate anyone for speaking their mind, when they don't do it to hurt
you! If you want to reply to her post, I for one would not like to see you
write something negative. You are not her, and can't possibly see things
through her eyes, so don't try to tell her what's up! Please keep in mind
PLUR, it should be the basis for everything we do, say, write, eat, sleep,
everything, at least that's my belief. We can't expect to gain respect in
other's eyes, if we constantly tear each other apart. I suppose I might be a
little offensive through saying all this, but I'm a little peeved about the
less than positive posts that have been coming through. Why can't we all just
get along?! ::::duck:::: ok, I've gone too far! I'm out.....

Much PLUR and smiles, for all, even you!

OK, it's not that I can't see this situation being impossible...

But check it out, I understand the difference in obtaining a work permit
for the US as opposed to Canada, but here's at least a little light in an
otherwise dark forecast.

Bukem played Vancouver on July 1.

So, we'll see, we'll hope.  Logical Progression Tour without Bukem would
be like the Grateful Dead without Jerry.  Nearly unthinkable.

DETONATE THE SKIES,

hey all, it's me again!

first of all, i hope everyone is enjoying their day off today!

second of all i wanted to say thank you for all who replied, it means alot
that i have reached alot of you.
 
also i wanted to clear up a few things so i can help you guys understand me
a little bit more.

i wasn't oblivious to the fact that all the points i brought up were there
already, rather, i was only pointing out that it SEEMS to me that it has
gotten way out of control, more so than what i usually see, so that's why i
felt i needed to write. believe me i am no stranger to the drugs, the
dealers, the seedy guys, the 12 yearolds on e, the backbiting, etc etc... it
just feels like poeple are forgetting what used to be important. and the
people i see contributing to it are people who i see are getting sucked into
the drug part of it, where they once didn't depend on drugs as the sole
source of entertainment. 

some people though opened up my eyes a bit wider, making me *reluctantly*
realize that there's not much you can do to stop it. oh well, i guess i will
just have to try harder. anybody with me?

"welcome to the real world" someone mentioned. okay, okay, so we can't
expect to change it entirely, but i guess somewhere in my little naive heart
i thought that maybe we could possibly hopefully reach out and fix maybe
part of the problem. is that too much to ask?


well, i think i have exhausted the topic. 

remember to keep what is important to you close to your heart, and believe
in it.

take care and play safe this weekend. have lots of fun partying.
spread your love 

starpower goes out to all of you,
stariana*

Heya, SFRaverkiddies :)
It's been awhile since I last wrote to the list, and I've been unsubbed for
about a month due to trying to get some of my life in order (it worked!!).
Anyway, does anyone have any clue as to what could possibly be fun to go to
tonight (other than fireworks, that is...)  I haven't been raving or
dancing or nuthin' for about 3 weeks, and I want this to be fun.  Oh, and I
have a new love-interest who I want to impress, so please help me out
here!!!
Thanks a bunch!
Love ya!

I'd just like to say that this is my first message thingee on sfraves, 
a nice big hello to all!!!!
(My name is meg by the way)
I've been sorta "lurking" for a while, and from what I've read, you 
all seem like completly grounded, nice, real people......
that's super refreshing!!
I just want to wish all the kids going to Freedom a very nice time, it 
sounds like it's gonna be so gorgeous!!(lucky me, I have no dollars so 
I get to sit in my sucky town, yeah.)
Anyhow, it was my friend Jil's b'day yesterday, and I know she'll be 
at Freedom with this gal, Lisa........ soooo if you see her, give her 
a nice b'day hug or a smooch or something else just as lovely. I know 
that would make her quite a happy girl!! 
Have a happy fourth, and take care!

There most assuredly are presale tix for Freedom, I believe there were last
year as well, but i wasn't able to purchase mine prior to the party, so I
can't say that I know for sure. This year I can say for sure. The info line
is 415.905.9629/415.522.3994, they might say where you can get them out of
San Jose, but i haven't yet tried the line.... But, if you live near San
Jose, or are willing to drive there, you can buy them at a dj store called
Solid Grooves, on N. Bascom Ave. right next door to the Pink Poodle strip
club thing, at the corner of Bascom and San Carlos/Steven's Creek. They sell
for $21, and there should be plenty to go around. I'll try to get more info
on where else you can get them, but I won't be getting mine til I get there I
fear....

PLUR!

I think if you we can get that done, it's a wonderful idea. Then we won't
have to be worried about what time it is, and I, for one, don't even own a
time telling device at all (even my car's clock doesn't work!). Only problem
is getting a tent, and a noticeable sign. As a suggestion I think we should
put some sort of red, white and blue stuff on it, but not in an american flag
set up, just as designs. :::shrug:::: just a thought....

No there are people out there that aren't forgetting "what is
important"(whatever that happens to be for you), however as the scene gets
larger and larger you have to look a little harder for people that sync
with your vision of how things "should be," and "what it's all about."
Different people have different opinions on just what is important.  

> "welcome to the real world" someone mentioned. 

That would have been me. Didn't mean to sound harsh(for a change), however
this scene like any other is made up of human beings, and human beings no
matter what scene they are in are going to have their personal prejudices
and biases, rather they be against certain styles of dress, the color of
someones skin, religious preferences, a style of music, etc. etc. And
being human people are going to express those dislikes. And their
audience, whomever they are, are going to make judgements about that
person based on what they say and how the act. Scene, whatever that scene
may be does not transend this in my experience.

Yes. You cannot change people unless they want to be changed. If people 
want to get wacked out on any chemical cocktail they can devise every
weekend, if Suzy want to dis Jane's hideous dress and her poor choice of
hair style, nothing you do is going to change that unless *they*
want to listen to, or are willing to change their behaviour. You can
reach out all you want, but there has to be someone on the other side that
wishes to be reached, and changed. 

If you were to "fix" part of the problem, how would you do it? Where would
you start? 


> remember to keep what is important to you close to your heart, and believe

And share it with those around you that you care about! But just keep in
mind that your vision is not the only one, or the only "right" one, IMHO.

If some one has a tent I have some flourescent tape
and we can put SRF on the side...

I think there will be people meeting at the water bar
every two hours possibly every hour starting at 6 pm
and the main meeting at 2 am. 

to control another is to take away both his and your FREEDOM
because you have to expend energy to control him. Give others 
the freedom to be who they are and our own freedom will grow
as a result. we can only love or hate another as much as we 
love/hate ourselves. Perhaps some thing to think about as we
celebrate freedom...How can we make the world more free for all?
How can we use the dance to free the spirit of love and happiness?

A happy foolish weekend to all

happen again. if you have something to say to me about it, please do, i don't
want any hard feelings because of my post, especially since i'm so new, and
most of you are prolly thinking that i have no right to say such things.
you're right i don't. i don't know any of you really, so i should have just

Was my response negative? I really don't think so.

Was I berating her at all? well, it was sincerely not my intention to do
so. I guess it's a matter of opinion though, if someone's feelings get
hurt, I suppose in a way then I am indeed a bit negative. But you must
understand that being harsh or negative is not my intention in the
slightest. Nor is it my thinking that I am in any way better than her. I
thought I was very careful to phrase my words in a considerate and
uncondecending form. But how can I say anything at all if I don't say what
I feel, and respond honestly to the points she brought up in her post. And
what I said isn't "right", but it is my experience. and if there is any
point to my reading all of your posts and posting any of my own then I must
relate my experience as truthfully as possible. Otherwise I might as well
just leave you alone so that you can live in a world of no consequence or
diversity, where everything and every idea conforms to your preconceived
notions.

I understand that Star's message was very important, and means a great deal
to her. and I felt and respected it so much that I related my own feelings
on the matter back. I've gone through the same experience, or at least
something very similar, and felt that I have now come to a point where I
understand it and feel that I have moved through it successfully. How could
I not want to share that success with someone who seems to be struggling in
the same way I did? Sure I am not her, and I don't see through her eyes. So
what... I am not a lot of things, and I understand very little except for
what I think I see. all I can ever do is make my own interpretations and my
own self-conceived actions. Does that mean I shouldn't ever act because I
do not truly see? I saw something that I felt I could help with, and I so I
acted. I might have been wrong, but surely no more wrong than you are in
trying to judge me here and now.

Plur is good but where does it end? Does it end with the person who
"appears" to be unplurlike... or is it up to you to go ahead and respect
that person anyway, even if he doesn't follow the rules.

I am not attacking anyone, except for those people who feel like they're
being attacked. That's my whole point, it's up to you to stop feeling like
you're being attacked. Just like it's up to Stariana to stop her own
feeling like the scene and feelings that she loves so much are decaying.

cause the fact of the matter is that no amount of telling people how bad
things are will ever really make things good again. Rallying the troops and
showing them how to march won't really fix anything. Things will only
become good again when you make them good again. plain and simple.

my sincerest regards-

-john.

So I'm happy to report that two of my favorite neices travelled from 
Pasadena to OC to attend a little "Open Deck Party" (or ODP as we all call 
'em) in Costa Mesa!
It was lods of fun and Star seemed happy and plurry as always, so those 
who may be worried need not fret.  :)

I'm tired now and I'm going to go to sleep.  Last night I had a dream 
that I was playing with my synthesizers and I was making these really 
rumbly bass sounds.  It's fun to dream about bass.  Maybe I'll dream 
about squitchity high end stuff tonight.  :)

Janelle,

Once in Thailand, you should go to an island on the east side called Koh
Samui. You'll eith have to fly from Bangkok or head south towards Suri
Thani and take a boat. From there, you need to take a ferry boat to a
tiny neighboring island called Koh Pangang. That's where there's a big
Full-Moon party each month on the beach.

Have fun!

where I should go to find said parties? I've also heard that the police
have been pretty harsh on cracking down on them....Any opinion on the
scene
out there? See or skip?

Hello there.  
	disclaimer:  Well I'm very new to your community scene and I hope none
of you guys mind if I'm bringing up something that's already been said.
	Anyhow, I've read on the Blue Room Released page (www.bandblueroom.com)
that Koxbox is going to be somewhere in San Francisco on July 20th.  Last year
they were in some warehouse somewhere, and there were some flyers around, but
this year I haven't heard anything more.  Being that most everything on the
Blue Room label (incl. well known Juno Reactor) is so incredible, in my humble
opinion, one can imagine how worried I am at hearing nothing more about
Koxbox's imminent whearabouts.  If anyone can help out (I've already checked
the hyperreal sf calendar and scouted sf's flyers and the guardian), I would be
forever indebted.
	Thanks much,
hope y'all survived the 4th,
Elise

Hi, Monty here again. I ALSO wanted to let you know about a special Sunset
party happening tomorrow. It's time again for Pacific and The Justice League
to have their annual jam together(I think this is either the 3rd or 4th year
we've done this)!

Once a year during Independance Day weekend, Pacific and the JL form like
Voltron to bring you a slamming day of music and fun! Your DJ's will be:

Kamahele(JL)
Joe Rice(JL)
Solar(Pacific)
Monty(JL)
Galen(Pacific)

As you can see from your scorecard, we have them out numbered this time and
we intend on capitalizing on that :)!

Hey guys...

I just wanted to say hi. I haven't been posting too much lately... I've
moved out and have so much going on right now... but I'm still going to
parties and seeing you..... I wanted to send a big hug to the entire group
and hope to see you at Freedom tonight. It's going to be life changing....
I can feel it. I can't wait to hear TONY for the first time in a
month.....aaa... :)

"Jean-Luke-Picard".... <-- there's a song that Tony spins that is really
deep house that I swear says this....

See you there!.. I'll be wearing a Tushiki (sp?) if it's not too cold and
my hair is freshly dyed blonde.... !

But I think it's Tony.. Or is Josh Tony? I don't know.. And then there is

First I must admit that due to time constraints as of late, I didn't read
*all* of the messages in that thread, but I do want to contribute a few
ideas (which may or may not have been expressed ;)...

I'm pretty new to the rave scene (thanks...many thanks...to beth), and did
e for the first time a couple of months ago after a 3 year moratorium on
psychedelics. I like it a lot, and want to keep liking it, so I don't do it
al the time...but enough of the disclaimers.

I have *very* fond memories of area51, but I can see how some people might
not share that sentiment. The decor was rather anemic and it was kind of
dirty (no...very dirty), and there were a lot of people standing around.
But, I didn't notice that. The group I went with (beth, ari, matt, ed,
gavin, shua, nick, becca), and everyone who gravitated to the same little
area upfront, are what I remember most distinctly.

The only real bummer for me was the fact that there were so many people
that just didn't want to smile. That kind of sucks the energy out of
me...again, it's good to have a home base full of good peoples.

Beth and I went to boomboomBASKET yesterday...and it was proof to me that
e isn't a requisite part of a good time (btw...greetings Jeremy, Jeremy,
Jacob, Forrest, Micron, Astronaut Scott)...it's the immediate surroundings.
I was even able to filter out the foaming-at-their-mouths
hiding-in-the-bushes goth guys later in the evening. Blue skies, great
people, and that cute lil dachsund(sp?) puppy made it one hell of a fourth.

Ok...maybe I'm just green, naive, wet-behind-the-ears as my grandpappy used
to say. But even with all of its flaws, the bayarea rave scene hasn't left
me with a frown on my face yet.

Thanks for listening...hope to see you all at freedom (I'll be wearing a
big puffy Uncle Sam hat)

For 4 years, I went to parties by myself, didn't talk to a single person,
danced to the point of vomitting most times, and left in the morning by
myself, on my gay pink and purple bike.

i was a tweaked out (not speedy, just naturally), freaked out, painfully shy
dorky  dorkhead with no friends,  but

I    had
the
time
of
my 

life.


unconditional interest,

hey. Scroll down or hit the arrow key.
i hope this works on your screen.  try a smaller font if it doesn't look
right.  some sections are a bit chunky, but I spent too much time on it already!

all of you who are even remotely interested in jungle..
REALLY MISSED OUT LAST NIGHT!
step2k 
was
fucking
SICK!
i left @ around 2/2:30 am cuz we were so damn tired but it was BUMPIN 
when we walked out the door..
SWRV from indianapolis threw down a shitload of rollin bumpin bouncy 
tracks with thick chunky basslines...
and R.A.W... well, how can i explain it.. he started out with "your 
sound" (j majik) on 2 decks and then just exploded into a frenzy of 
scratching and bouncing and just sick sick WICKED MAD SKILLS :)~
he needs to leave L.A. and move up here. 
	and the crowd, well if any of you wanna tell me that junglists 
have attitude, FUCK YOU :)~ cuz everyone there was smilin, bouncin, and 
the dance floor was packed.. ok at first it wasn't, it was a row of 
junglists sitting on a bench but once more people showed up and SWRV took 
the decks, people started to really move..and then when R.A.W. took over, 
he floor was packed!
	major props to step2k for the video game room in the back, and 
the soopercomfy couch :)~ and for giving proof that true junglism does 
still exist -- that a jungle party ccan go off without a shitload of 
cheeseheads walking around with attitude. 
AHH! i am in such love with the jungle scene up here, don't ever let it 
go bad!
	i'm serious, step2k last night was the sickest, raddest party 
i've been to in a LONG ASS TIME. no DOUBT. i'm not gonna be missing a 
step2k again in a LONG time. :)~ i don't think i've danced this hard 
ever! 
	the beats were phat, the skills were mad and the vibe was good.
see u all out,
lara:)~

eep!  can i get some tech support here?

it came through all fudged up when it came back to me, too.  I  reckon it
has to do with how  hyperreal interprets fonts and sends them back out.  I
don't know if it came out funny on everyone's, or just on certain people's
screens.

did anyone see it the way it was supposed to be seen???

imma git som e sleepnow..

Minh Le, who is studying in Berlin right now ( and who will probably go to the 
Love Parade which I'm REALLY upset I'm going to miss),  wrote me this.  Anyone 
familiar with the NY scene, who can pass along a few tips?  Reply to the email 
at the bottom.


--> Sounds like a deal.  BTW, I am returning to California in the end
of July, I hope to be introduced into the scene again ASAP.  Are you still
going places or just spending time in?  But before all else, I'll be in
New York City from July 22 - July 30 for the first time of my life.  I
don't have a clue, but was wondering if anybody on the list might have
some suggestions or tips they can pass on.  You know, the first time is
always supposed to be the best time....


Ciao,
M&m

I got it!!!!!! It's cool, it's cool, I love it!!! Sorry I'm a little excited
about being back from Freedom! Though I would have been happier meeting more
of the smiling faces behind those handles, but I won't get to that!

Okay it's Jen...delurking briefly...
I don't know guys...I am glad that people had fun last nite, 
but hmmm, last nite really took a bite out of me, and i mean 
a huge chunk.  I feel like i went to that party and it was painful..
The music hurt, it was scary, and I couldn't leave. It was one 
of those nites where you feel like you just aged a year.  Not blaming 

anyone and I am sorry if this is non-PLURry, but it reminded me
why I stay away from the massives.  
I am still trying to figure out what happened over at the jungle tent.


I don't know what else to say.
I just want to go to sunset.

yeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaahhhh  SUNSET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

ok thats it.,

There was a time when I said I wasn't going back to the ranch, but last night somehow changed my mind, and I'm glad I was a part of something that's been going strong for the past 6 years.

Joe Rice- Props to you guy! For those who missed out, you should give him peeps at Sunset today.  Always a treat to hear.

Daniel from Moontribe- Was it just me, the dust, or was he M.I.A. last night? Curious

Doran- Started me on the groove trip

Spun- A succession of four mixes that almost made me forget I was outdoors! Boy the shoes are ready to go! For those of you who went primitive- barefoot, I give you guys massive props.

Tony- Jamming tunes

Jon Williams- rocking out again; always a fav.

Soulstice PA- AWESOME! The boys in the breakin' circle to the left of the dj booth had some incredible moves in the rough sand pit.  The PA was just as vibe-filling.

What happened towards the end of their PA? Did someone accidentally blow something out, or was that meant to be?

Yes, it was a maze to find yer car in the morning, the dust getting into you system, if you wern't one with the mask, but the pros outnumbered the cons, and I'm glad I made it out this year.

Peace, and zzz's, Mr. 2

>BOMB...anyone know "What's the Buzz"? 

        this is late, I had to go home to visit the parents for 4th of
July... but I just have to do this..


        What's the buzz, tell me what's hapenning, what's the buzz, tell me
what's happening...

JCS is my favorite rock opera, I have seen it countless times(I hate the
movie)at different playhouses and I still love it... I just LOVE the music!
Those songs are great!

        See my legs, I can hardly walk, see my back, I can barely stand, see
my mouth, I can hardly talk, see my clothes, I'm a poor, poor man. Why don't
you, why don't you heal me Christ! Why don't you, why don't you heal me Christ!

        (btw, I'm not Christian, and I've never been to church a day in my
life. I just love the music!)

        I visited Vietnam a while back, and notice a Goa party which was
about to happen on a beach near my mom's house. The beach was called Nga Noc
Tran(you guys should hear me say it before you even try to pronounce it,
unless you know Vietnamese of course.) Unfortunately, I had to leave before
it. But I noticed there were lots of college students around(mostly
international business students trying to get the inside track on a new
market) and one told me there were Goa parties in Vietnam all the time,
which was weird because it is still communist. Although it's so rural I
don't know what they could do. I don't know about Thailand though, but it
could be similar. Vietnamese raves. Who would have guessed?

We were wondering about Daniel as well. I think he was MIA, as you put it.
Though that whole jungle thing got a bit messed up after the speaker fell
over. I was also wondering if anyone knew who was spinning just before dawn,
say as the sun was rising, but before it actually crested? We were in the pit
before we ascended the mountainside, and were enthralled by the beats, they
were absolutely captivating! Loved it, two thumbs up, and much respect; it
was a well done massive.

        I'm back in Berkeley! Finally! I went 5 days sober, after 2 months
of smoking pot about 5 or more times a day, and smoking out at least once or
twice everyday for a year before that! Sure, I took days off now and then,
but never 5 days sober! That lets me know I can stop when I want to, and
that's nice to know(although those first two night were REALLY hard to sleep
through...)

        I missed Freedom and feel lame, because it seems everyone went
except me. I was in Granite Bay, which is like, 45 minutes east of
Sacramento.  My parents moved there after I moved here, so I knew no one
there and spent my time being incredibly bored, but I got things done. I
also hooked up with some fatty fireworks from Georgia(my dad and I are
pyromaniacs)and we lit so many until we got bored. I grew up with fireworks
and I can't bear to be apart from them even though the laws here are real
strict to weed out idiots who screw it up for everyone else. I love
fireworks! I love the sense of danger you get from them, that's half the
fun! Anyways, it was like, 95+ degrees everyday outside so I'm glad to be back.

        But I got an idea. Next time my parent go on vacation(which will be
later this summer)I should organize something up there! My parents live on
Folsom Lake, which is huge! There are only like, 20 or so houses which are
actually on the lake(the rest is a state park)and at night, the temperature
stays around a nice 70 degrees or so, perfect weather for an all night,
outdoor party on the lake! Maybe I could stretch it multiple days! Just
ideas to throw out.

        I also am sad that I missed all of you at freedom, I wanted so bad
to meet all of you since I haven't yet(except for Rebel and Kawai)... So I
await the next chance to dance... I was so fiending for techno I had to
watch Amp, which suprisingly, wasn't too bad all the time(they actually
beat-match videos now, and mix them up a little sometimes.) But those ATR
videos, oh boy, I don't know how much of that I can stand.

        As you can tell, I have too much energy. Time to smoke, I'm back,
and I'm a stoner again. I got my turntables right here! I'm ready for action....

        I was recently informed by good ole' Brett(DJ Flite)that we are
having a rooftop party today, and Noel and Flux will be here! So cruise on
by later tonight, it may start a little before sunset(the astronomical
event, not the party) but I'm not sure, I'll post again later.

        2422 Ridge Road, Berkeley. I-80 to university exit, head towards
campus, left onto Oxford, right onto Hearst, left onto Euclid, left onto
Ridge, we're on the left(the weird, tan-ish cement building)

        if you're bored and you don't want to go to sunset because you're
insane, check it out! I'll be here, it'll be on the roof, it'll be small and
close(hopefully not TOO small)... I found out when I was at home that I
actually am a starving college student, because I lost 25 pounds since
January. So I will be the tall, brown-haired skinny guy with a blue eye and
a brown eye.

        go rooftops! yeah!

The Buzz is on the Buzz-Line 415-569-3300.  I used to play a disco remiz
of that song in the background of the message, untill i lost the tape.

But never the less, the BUZZ IS ON THE BUZZLINE!

 quark records(siam square soi4)have an okay dance section upstairs.
 come by on a saturday afternoon and chat with expatriate junglist
 Bee about possible goings on in town.here you may also find fliers 
 for some of the larger underground events, but don't count on it...  
 silom soi 4 is generally pretty frisky come friday or saturday night
 ...passionately queer and deliriously decadent, it's home to dp 2000,  
 one of the most hammer n tongs tekno clubs i've ever had the pleasure of 
 collapsing in. if the notion of k'd up drag queens voguing to gabberhouse
 trips yr switch, then this may become your new home. further
 up the block is divine, which used to host some interesting afterhours
 action, but may be no more as of this writing...the israeli backpacker
 massive tends to convene at star bar, (temple end of khao san rd. hard
 to describe where exactly. ask around...) where falang djs slam trance    
 dats till dawn most nights. i don't like it here. you may. another
 longstanding thai tekno institution is saturday's passion at narcissus
 (sukumvit soi 25, again, not easy to find the first few times...)
 beautiful venue,awesome sound, and okay music, but the door price is
 high and the vibe is bad at best...still, a good place to find out about 
 undergrounds and such like. thai night life changes constantly, so this
 may all be completely out of date...the traveller trance scene on ko
 phangan is okay. slightly better than goa,imho. the music is more
 advanced(turntables!),the atmosphere is kooler overall,and the 
 locals actually seem to dig it for the most part... a club called
 harmony operates here during the high season(nov-may).they play trance,
 and on a good night, blow away everything happening outside of the
 capital,full moons included...yes, partiers are occasionally arrested
 or harrassed by police in hat rin ...these folks are usually either
 stupidly indiscrete or set up...watch out, but don't be too worried...ko
 samui sucks en total...avoid at all costs...anyway, i hope this is 
 of some assistance...

Hello beautiful people!

Perhaps against my better judgment, I've re-subbed again :)
I've barely dipped me foot in the party pool this year, but I
look forward to becoming more involved, and more conspicuous,
this summer, and to seeing my wonderful friends (any of y'all
still out there?) :)
I promise not to post like there's no tomorrow anymore ;)
Love and peace to all!!!

It's my understanding that Sunset happens every OTHER Sunday, today _not_
being one of them.  The next sunset will be a "boat party" - meaning you
won't see a normal beach-park sunset aghain until three sundays from now.

Hi. If you're a weed guru, maybe you can help me. 

I'm sure you've heard of "brown" weed, right? It's that low-grade stuff that
sells for about half as much as better quality stuff. Anyway, I was just
wondering why anyone would want to "make" brown, if they have any control
over it. 

Anyway, I was just curious. =)

Scales of economy, not everyone can afford a bag of green for $50, so they
buy the browm at greatly discounted rates.  The same applies to booze, why
do people drink that, er, stuff called budweiser and NOT a good beer like
Newcastle , Sameul Adams triple bock, or Chimay?  Some people have no taste
(given), but I think it's more a factor of economics than taste.

I am not a weed guru, but I play one on TV.

Peace,
John

P.S.  Also accessibility (my girlfriend informed me).  Back east it is
probalby harder to find the kind than here.  Let's face it, the best is
often from teh west, we are spoiled by a really good climate (fairly much
year round), very fertile soil, and relatively lax law enforcement (in SF
it is a no priority item).

Peace.

Hi, Monty here again. I ALSO wanted to let you know about a special Sunset
party happening tomorrow. It's time again for Pacific and The Justice League
to have their annual jam together(I think this is either the 3rd or 4th year
we've done this)!

Once a year during Independance Day weekend, Pacific and the JL form like
Voltron to bring you a slamming day of music and fun! Your DJ's will be:

Kamahele(JL)
Joe Rice(JL)
Solar(Pacific)
Monty(JL)
Galen(Pacific)

As you can see from your scorecard, we have them out numbered this time and
we intend on capitalizing on that :)!

"Brown weed is usually "commerically" grown. It is grown in huge outdoor
crops where the males and females are not seperated. This results in the
males polenating the females. The females then start puting their energy
into producing seeds instead of THC (the stuff that gets you stoned).

To make it short - I HAD A BLAST!!!
Fortunately for me, I had been to the site of Freedom in the past and knew to bring a dust mask.  I just felt bad when at least 3 other people asked me if I had any more and I didn't.  It was SO cute how we all looked like smiling, dancing powdered donuts by morining!!

I was in the thick of it - front and center between the two speakers about 15 people thick from the dj booth.  Something about being in the heart of the dancing that is MAGIC!  I stayed there for HOURS!  

Tony did a real housey set - he always is full of surprises, as far as his mixing style.

Jon Williams just tore shit up!

Stacey Pullen - he sure knows how to make an entrance.  What an interesting style he has. It was good enough to keep my feet dancing enthusiastically.  

The morning set was so great.  We finally left around 9 and it was nice, sunny and hot.  Something us San Franciscans don't get enough of!

See ya next time!

Amy

That accounts for the weed to have a less stoney effect, and being "seedy",
but it does not explain the brown color, which I think is due to how the
weed is cured.  For instance what you say is correct, but you can also find
less potent and seedy green weed.

After all there are only two types: sinse (sic) (totally seedless female
bud), and, er the other.

When I was in Florida as a youth, brown was everywhere.  Why?  Primarily
because the stuff was being dumped out of planes in leaky bags into salt
water, and then later dried out, producing the famous borwn.  And yes, some
was sinse, but it was hard smokin'!

I dunno...is it curing or is it THC?  I say curing, anyone else?

Well, I'm looking at some of my flyers and I see some names I kind of 
recognize, either from friends, the list, or other parties, and I was 
wondering whether anyone could offer some information about them, e.g. what 
kind of music do they specialize in, why you like them or not, what kind of 
parties they do, etc. etc.

So here's those names:

1.  Jeno
2.  Tony
3.  Garth
4.  Ethan
5.  Mars
6.  Myster-E
7.  J.P.
8.  Markus Mark

Oh, and any input on any other notable djs (especially from Sac, or that do a 
lot of Sac parties, but Bay Area dj info is good too) would be appreciated.

Its the curing that makes it brown, but the curing itself removes a portion of the THC from the plant (I hear anyways).

Also, maybe the curing method itself may be more cost-effective and/or rapid. Okay, lets say yer a producer and brown takes
like 3 hours to cure with artificial lights whereas green takes a week. The drawback is potency but if you have a heavy demand you
might need to get it out on the streets faster :P. It would make sense to produce brown if that were the case
but this is all speculation anyways. just my 2 pennies.

Hi everybody!

I had such a blast!  I knew just as soon as everyone got in that big ol'
circle at sunset that the vibe was going to be insane (insane in a GOOD
way, mind you...)  My tent was set up right in the frontrow of tents,
directly in the center between the speakers, right where I could sit on
my lawn chair and see everybody dance and enjoy the laser show above my
head.  (Man, those lasers combined with the stars in the sky is such an
excellent trip...) I bought a whole bag of Jolly Ranchers and passed them
out to everyone... (a great way to meet people, may I add...)  Met some
extremely friendly people from Sac, San Luis Obispo, and Malibu even!

but...

I can't sEEm to rEmEmbEr what happEnEd to mE betwEEn thE hours of around
12:30 to about 4:00 except:

*I met (the now-infamous) Ben and Iris!  (Two of the most friendliest
people you will ever meet, by the way...)
*I met some other people (sorry I can't remember any names besides Ben &
Iris...  was it Melanie, Amy, George, and Juan???  I feel so bad not
remembering...)
*We took a picture, which will be up on my website soon... 
*And the last thing I remember was waiting by the water table wondering
where the rest of all you SFRavers were...  wasn't there supposed to be a
big group hug at 2AM?  

Oh yeah... I have to say that watching the sun rise on the top of the
hill with about a hundred of your fellow ravers is something that makes
Freedom such a wonderful party... 
<sniff>it was so beautiful... <wiping tear from eye>you guys are the
best... i think i'm gonna cry...  ;-)

Luv all of ya!!!!!
Jay
(doughboy!)

<poke my belly and i go "hee-hee">

P.S.  I have to ask this question--  Someone told me last night that I
"don't look like the raving type" (i guess it was my clothing or
something- I had a Raiders jersey on)  Just what exactly is "the raving
type" supposed to look like? It's not like I stand by the entrance
mumbling the word "doses" over and over to everyone that walks by...

The comment kinda pissed me off, kinda didn't...  ya know?   =p

Watch out. Here comes Mr Attitude.

I had alot of fun. No help from "the people" ofcourse. Actually, I think
that "the people" try to help make the scene a very uncomfertable and
unsettling experience for me. But after I blocked everyone out. It felt
just like camping out with a couple of friends. Which was great.

Nothing like a field of rocks to make your true clumsEness show.

I am having trouble understanding this line. I think your saying that you
danced your booty off during the DJ Spun set. But SPUN only succeeding with
four mixes? I figure that guy can mix 120 records in one 2hour set. 15
seconds to find a record, 5 seconds to cue it up, and 40 seconds of
blending. He went off at Planet Rock. Or was it The Gathering? Yea The
Gathering, I think it was.

While waiting in-line for the outhouse. My eyes only had two choises. To
either be blinded my the floodlights facing the stalls, or turn around and
be blinded with dust in my eyes.

But. Gee... Can you believe it? I had a good time!
Sorry if I came off with an attitude later on in the night. It's just that,
some shit really gets to me.

Peace & floating paper boats.

Your funny.

Actually.. In basic nStuff language.. Brown weed is just not as good as
green weed. There for it is not worth as much. 

Amongst other things like.
 Brown weed is usually picked from the ground prematturely, where green
weed is grown up to it's full potential. Which may add up to more labor
charges.
 Most green weed is made right here in the US of A. Brown weed is usually
imported from another country, Concealed in harsh enviorments like dirt for
months. And who wants to pay more money for dirty old weed?
 Green weed is usually grown in an artificial enviorment that makes the
plant produce more of it's pontential organic compounds. Which in the end
cost more money too.


 Or maybe.. Some brilliant pot head, one day decided he was going to go out
and make himself a less costly weed, so that people without jobs could
still smoke pot. Hense forth, Econo-Bud.


 I need to goto bed.

Isn't the raving type. Thoughs people with the big greasy permagrins
driving down the street with the windshield wipers on in the middle of a
sunny afternoon?

I think that the ravE types are actually, well atleast the massive types
are the kind of people that spread around there opinions untell they have
just about everybody thinking there facts. The type that goes around
talking shit and making fun of people they don't understand. The "poor
loser" type. That high school "follow" the leader type.

Watch out! Even the ones that act total friendly can be decieving you.
Cause most of them really have no care in the world rather than to feel
good. Even at other peoples expence.



Anyways.. That only goes for that "ravE type" I am referring to at the
moment ofcourse.
You know who you are.


Jeff (and you think your gonna cry?)
Make me feel comfertable, and I will repay you with an open heart.




Here are a couple quotes from FREEDOM:

"He's a fag" "are you sure?" "I am possitive"
"Your spoiling are rave"
"Has been"   <--- Very original. I see people are getting more creative.

"will he ever get better"   <----- I found this very heart warming. It's
comments like this that make me believe there are actually people in the
scene that care for something other than there own self immage.
Ofcourse, I didn't get to see this persons face but. I know when someone is
talking about me.

Anyways. Enough venting.
 My friends trip off me. It's like...I can tell they feel like, if they
were in my shoes they wouldn't be-able to take it. But...No biggy to me.
It's only a ravE thing. And a ravE is one of thoughs things that I can just
wipe off my to-do list at anytime.
 But you know what, taint no thing.  I will just go for the music, I for
the dance.  I can live with that. Even if I have to put up with being
pissed on for ever. 


What a nasty massage huh?
You think this is nasty...You can't even immagine the nasty, evil, twisted
vibes I deal with.

Only at the ravE.
Peace.
Jeff agian.

>1.  Jeno

Basically he's the shit in SF, and all places in between.  Probably the
most influential DJ in the bay area.  And dare I say if it weren't for
Jeno, who has brought in so many styles of house music (including but not
limited to trance, chicago trax, techno, happy house, garage, deep house,
and breakbeat) many people wouldn't be DJ's, there probably would be only
one record store (BPM), and you wouldn;t have the plethora of house music
that you have today.  His influence is far reaching, his standards?  Yet to
be matched.  The ultimate mental DJ.

>2.  Tony

Tony's first gig that I remeber was the VERY FIRST Basics in 93.  He played
@ the Wet Studios and from that time on I know *I* wanted him to play for
Vortex.  Great freindly guy who has a smile for everyone, and has nary a
bad word to say.  He's also one bomb of a DJ.  I credit tony with being one
of the first of the newer DJ's to really develop his own sound and kinda
broke away from the "I wanna be play like Jeno" trap so many up&coming
DJ's fall into.

>3.  Garth

Oy vey, Garth...what is there to say.  Part of the Wicked crew since it's
inception.  Part of the Jeno/Garth mega tag team.  Remeber Wicked's inb the
basement of 1015 on Fridays?  Garth has layed down so many groovy grooves
and has made so many people happy with his style of music he is the one
when it comes to getting a floor moving, and geting butts shaking, it can
only be Garth.  he too has a following and his influence can be heard in my
opinion, in Simon's playing.  Now I haven't heard Simon in a while, but I
do know at one point Garths influence was clear in Simons music as well as
other noted bay area DJ's.

>4.  Ethan

SFR's own.  My history with Ethan starts with arguing, as I beleive over
boycotts.  From that point Ethan & Bryce began the party known as friends &
family.  He's is part of the "Techno Warriors" here in the city.  Ethan, I
must give props to, because he was WAAAAY ahead of the curve when it camer
to techno.  If fact, Ethan was playing techno when it was getting little
shrift from househeads like myself.  I remember berating him about anything
over 120-124 bpm.  But Ethan, a ture warrior kept his faith, and whadday
know?  Now everryone is on the Techno bandwagon since it is the latest new
thing...;)  Now we have MAD, F&F, and Ethan is ubiquitous with Techno here
in the bay area.  And from what I understand through the underground wire,
he's the shit when it comes to playing it (I remeber when he got dex).
He's also here on the list as one of the silent "old-skoolers".


>5.  Mars
>6.  Myster-E
>7.  J.P.

I don't know the rest of these personages.  Amybe someone can fill in the
blanks and or make corrections.

Ahh...great day out in Berkeley yesterday. Justice League and Pacific
hooked up for a VERY mellow affair. Decent turnout, smooth grooves and
nice sunshine made this one a keeper. Thanks to both crews.

Massive-

Hope to see many junglists at VSF tonight for the
EdRush/DocScott/JMajick/OhmyGosh gig. From the look of the reviews
back east, it's going to be one to remember!

Also, I dropped off a couple mix tapes at Zebra records on haight
street. If you're into dark groovy jungle, check it out:)

-peace-

Hello, and good_morning to all.

Well I must say that I was impressed with this event.  I got there about
11:00 thinking the line of cars to get in was going to take forever, but to
my surprise it actually went really smooth.  After getting searched and let
in I was bombarded by multiple pushers, it was a bit funny to say it
nicely.  We headed towards the chill spot and I believe Joe Rice was on his
marathon run (3hrs).  Yes, Daniel did not show.  

Checked out the stands where the water was and saw a very close and dear
friend of mine who I never saw again unfortunately (hope you had a good
time).  I ended up seeing a lot of people I knew and met a lot of new
friends in the process as well.  As we got ourselves situated we headed for
the Viberation tent (homebase).  Thanks Mike and Terry! =)  We kicked it
for awhile and then headed out to hear an amazing set by Spun (jason).  I
haven't heard him in a VERY long time and it was re_freashing and moving.
My feet just started kicking up dust(pun intended) and I was off...  The
sound system was fully dialed in when Spun was on, what happened to it
around 5:30 or so???  It just sounded really bad.

N_e_ways, I left that area to check out what I came for.........NOEL!  This
guy had me dancing for sometime.  Nice set.  Wonderful sound system.  Well
after an hour I headed to the main area to check out Jon Williams.  Good
minimal techno.  Stacy Pullen was one dj that took me by surprise.  This
man was twisting my brain.  He was just unpredictable and had a very unique
mixing style.  I enjoyed it very much.

I was kicking it in the back of the dj booth at some point enjoying the
view of happy energetic people.  I must say that the vibe at this event was
pretty damn good.  Everyone was very nice and polite.  The crowd just kept
growing and growing I have no idea how many people were actually there, but
with that many people and still keeping a thick vibe was amazing enough for
me.  

I did a lot of dancing believe it or not.  I'm not one to dance to much. =)
 I walked around most of the night never really staying in one place for to
long.  At some point during the night my ride was tired and went home.
That left me to walk and socialize with everyone, and this I did.  It was a
great party and I'm glad I went.

The sun_rise was very cool.  Tons of people walking up the hill to watch a
wonderful and hot sun_rise.  Everyone had on a smile and it was so nice to
actually be able to see some of these faces I've been bumping into all night.

I left around 8:30.  Dirty as all hell and dust in every possible place.
The dust was my only real gripe.  My eyes were hating me all night long.
That and Dan(micron), my ride to Oakland, losing his keys and somehow
finding them on the bleachers in the morning.  That was just pure lucky.
Thanks for the ride Dan.  Sorry for getting us lost... =)

Thanks goes out to Martin great event, Greg your a wonderful friend, Terry
and Mike You guys are just to cool. =)  And to all the other wonderful
people I shared the night with either in person or in spirit you all are
just amazing.  For a massive I was simply impressed.

Have a good day!

Hey everybody,
  I have a new e-mail address, for those of you who would like to reach me
OR had me on your e-mail's insty-delete filter setup ;). Please refer to
the new addy.
 I also have been there and back (?@%&!) and will be returning for good to
the beautiful land of the bay area in a few weeks... Heh, we put 6000 miles
on my car in two weeks and "trust:Surrender" was the best party I have ever
attended (once we finally found it [took 8 hours from Berkeley {duh}])!
 I feel very special to be joining such a great set of people out there
(everyone I met was totally wonderful) and I look forward to the positive
contributions I can make to the scene, life and stuff in general.
 Anyway, soon I may get a chance to write up a little ditty about my
wondorous travels... there and back and there again!
 One question... I didn't know there were fights at parties (raves)? Does
that happen often and I gotta wonder... why?

Wishing you all the best of plurmm,
 m

that's the thing. we're _all_ raving types. it's the love of the music, the
dance, the energy that makes one so. not the clothes (s)he wears, the drugs
(s)he does.... it's what's inside. anybody who has to classify a person by
their appearance, imho, has a long way to go before becoming a mature
raver/person (whatever that is!). *yawn* i graduated from high school 12
years ago.... enough of the bullshit already. i guess i have the most
respect for the ppl who follow their own path, who are true to themselves
and don't follow the dictates of some fad. if you love the music, you're a
raver. if you love the diversity that the scene brings, even better! this
(diversity) is what makes us as a group so unique. anyway, who wants to be
judged by the clothes on their back? not me....

cheers - e. :)

Hiya, all...
... had 24 hours to recover from freedom6, still struck by the same question:

Why were only 1/10, 1/20 of the people dancing? Music was loud, people
seemed nice enough, but it was really distressing to be surrounded (at both
dance areas) by undancing folks, just milling around eyeing things ...
Would have been fine if there were simply periods of non-dancing, or
smallish groups of non-dancers, but I found myself all night wandering
around trying to find (and failing to find) any group of people dancing
dense enoguh so as to get that ever-spiraling-upwards
getting-energy-from-other-dancers thing...

Not to knock the event - good free water, friendly crowd, but it felt more
like a state fair than a party.

Anyone else or am I a stick-in-the-mud?

some words about the Freedom party:

I noticed the unusually high concentration of Acura Integras on the
road around us and surmised that we were getting close to the site,
and seconds later we arrived at what looked like a more friendly
version of Mad Max's Thunderdome.  

The initial impact was *awesome*.  As we pulled up behind a pack of
cars waiting to get in, a cop in his car drove by our van ... I smiled,
and he ***WAVED and SMILED***.  This set my initial vibe-o-meter at 
around 'really good'.  

It was like a rave circus.  Wads of tents with people rolling around
in, on, and around them.  People mingling, talking, dancing, and wiggling.
A lack of people trying to push drugs obnoxiously to me.  (except right
when I got inside)  The jungleish room was pretty amazing for most of the
night -- whoever was on at about 1 was _ripping it up_.  (Noel?)  Later
in the same area I heard someone mix KRS-ONE and Blondie, which made my
body tingle and nearly made me fall down (literally, I lost my balance).
Dusty, dusty, dusty.. I have muddy boogers.  :)  Next time a dust mask.
The hills surrounding the event were sweet, as were the stars which I've
missed since moving to SF. 

The bigger dancefloor seemed nice .. I only danced out there about 4:50 or
so when we all danced the sun up.  What a sweet sunrise.  Gave out some
fruit.  Saw a guy giving out roses.  Climbed up onto the hillside with
about 1,000 of my close friends and watched as the sun rose over the
carnivalesque environment.  

Danced more.  Danced more.  Hugged people.  Got glittered up.  Danced.
Hugged people.  Yay.

First-rate, especially from a Floridian's point of view, as any party
this size in Florida would have had much less dancing and much more
static.  (I saw no altercations - yay!)

Kudos to the producers ... my body hurts!

these gentlemen are the owners of frequency 8 and they spin a style of 
music known as trance, of which there may be subgenres known as goa and 
cyber that they favor. i hear now that they are planning their first 
release on their own label. perhaps someone could confirm that rumor?

Hey all!!!!

   Rubilicious here!!!!! Man, it seems like forever since I've posted 
a Review. But anyways, I just have to say that FREEDOM was bomb!!! I 
have never been to a party that has lasted that long and it was just 
awsome I didn't want to leave when it was over. I saw so many of you 
beautiful sfravers and it made my time so much better because I had 
a chance within' a big ass massive to still feel that underground vibe
that is so seldom felt at massives. So, much love to you guys!!!! 

You see, the story is as follows: my Friend flaked on me to go to 
FREEDOM so I decided to go by my lonesome. I knew I would be able to 
still have fun by myself, but it was so intimidating to find anyone at 
a massive that large all by myself in the dark! Lucky for me I found you
guys and I also met alot of new ravers that weren't on the list:) I had
too much fun and I got one of those bombin' new laminates(thanks 
chand in blue and girlfriend: you guys are gorgeous)A quick Hi to 
Christine the candygirl, finally we meet! Pricilla, it was bomb to see
your smilin' face again:) And of course to the regulars( it's not a 
party without you guys) Beth, Byroni,LaNG,Paula ect..... I love you 
guys. 
And I'm not forgetting you Deepfog: thanks for the "Doughnuts" :) And to
everybody else that blessed me with your presence that night who I may
have forgotten your names(But not your smilin' faces): Much hugs to 
you guys!!!!!!!!OH, and the reuniting of the rave princesses (you know
who you are!!) was one of my favorite episodes of the night too :) :)


Nevertheless I would have to say that the morning music sets were 
awsome!!! My most favorite part of the whole rave would have to be 
dancing on top of the stage while the sun was new in the sky and that 
guy was singing live! WOW!!!! It was soo cool from up there, you could
see everyone dancing down below, you could see the people on the
 mountains,it was freakin'amazing. 

Oh well, I just thought I'd share my happiness wich ya'll.


                 Peace,Love, and Sparklies,

                                   rubilicious

  The music hurt me, too, but only because it climbed into my ass and
  shook it all around.  :)

  Seriously, though, what happened that was scary?

  All I saw was a lot of dancing .. what are you referring to?

The reason one sees brown weed is the same reason why one sees
large, rolling hills of golden grass -- the sun.  Many Mexican
and to a lesser extent Jamaican marijuana farmers dry their
crop by laying branches out in the sun over racks, and the
sun dries them; unfortunately this is not the optimum way to 
cure marijuana, and if the sun is really hot (ie nearly
equatorial) it can simply bleach out the marijuana.  Also,
be aware that this improper curing causes THC to degrade into
other cannibinoids especially CBN and CBD, which is not a good
thing from a getting-high standpoint.  Often brown weed is 
sprayed down with roach spray to make it work better.  It's
best avoided.  Also, black weed is probably moldy and as such
not such a good idea to put into your lungs.

Set in those beautiful rolling hills, when we left at 9am we were treated
by incredible scenery.  With ok computer playing, thousands of windmills
as far as the eye could see harnessed the earth's energy.  Which is
exactly what everyone at Freedom was doing, harnessing energy of music,
light, and love.  Brilliant...!

My first outdoor rave, and one of my faves.  Being outside completely
grounded me and kept me lovin' and dishing it out.  Some of the positives
that I can remember; the beautiful star quilt above the freakout room,
laser designs projected against a sheer rock face, the hillside sunset,
the windmills, tent city, dancing with my nitrous balloon (if you do it
just so, oh oh my!!), smokin bowls with guys on the freakout stage (one
guy had the most beautiful flowing  red afro), dancing with incredibly
charismatic (cute) people (hi selwa, juan, chris, amber, aubrey!), meeting
some sfravers (mr doughboy, ben, iris, amy)  didn't really get to hang out
with ya'll.  And last of all, cleaning my nose at the end of it all.  I
think I could have thrown a small pot from all the clay that came out!
buhahaha!!  

Some criticisms, I really wish the DJ lineup was posted.  Only good can
come of it.  Actually it pisses me off.  If someone could give me a
logical reason, please?  I would say it should be a fairly high priority,
up there with decorations and stuff.  Come on promoters, let the masses
know who's spinnin' so that we can buy their mix-tapes, go to parties
where they spin, and talk shit about them :).  Sure I ask people around
the booth who's spinning, but it really would be so great.  ALL parties
should let the masses know who's spinning somehow.  IMHO.

And then there were all the leadfooted people loitering around the dj
booth.  Move over bacon, cuz here comes something meatier.  If you were a
dj, whould you rather have people freakin out in front of you or have
people watch your technique and learn.  I dunno, i'm no dj, but the freaky
people reciprocate what the dj gives.  So, what i did and will start doing
is try to get the watchers moving.  It sort of worked but it would help if
I wasn't going solo.  I love watchin the dj sp[n too, and I love dancin',
so if you're just watchin, I think I'm gonna bump you out.  Let's form a
little pep squad.  Who's in?! 

One last thing, how do you approach someone and let them know you want to
cuddle?

I had an amazing time.  Love to all.

Like many have said, brown weed is due to curing process.  BUT, brown weed
does not always mean schwag.  Usually brown weed is from out of the
country, mass produced and smuggled in.  The sun breaks down most of the
green pigments (ie, chlorophyll) when the stalks are cut down and sun
dried.  Microbial activity also affects the color.  When they press
the buds into bricks, you get something along the lines of a compost pile
of grass.

I must say that, while brown weed doesn't have the fine bouquet of flava', 
that don't mean it aint got the chemical goodies.  Ever heard of Columbian
Red, Acapulcan Gold, Oaxacan, Jamaican?  These equatorial varieties
(sativa) are trippy, mind-fucking, psychedelic grass that comes into US
brown.  Now if you lived down in these areas, and got to cure your own
you'd be in for one hell of a treat!  You'd have green buddha, and you
might glimpse satori.

Subject: A different review of Freedom (long)
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.org
Precedence: bulk

My opinion is pretty much different than of many people on the list, but
why not share that as well.

I went last year, and although I had an OK time, I decided to go this year
as well.  The main reasons were that it was one of my best friend's B-Day
who really wanted to go, and it was an outdoor party (got to love those).

After a nice BBQ (with good DJs sets at my friend's house in Marin) we
started the journey.  I was really looking forward to it, and hoping we
would catch Doran's set....  As things go (lag, lag), we ended up at
Freedom by midnight, and after parking, being searched etc. we finally made
it inside and missed Doran.

I was so ready to dance and have fun, but somehow the music didn't do it
for me the entire night.  I guess I just know what I like, but there was no
trance to be found anywhere at the party.  I was glad I came with my best
friends, because that made things better, and I was able to hang out with
them and have some fun.    I danced for some of the night, but that wasn't
dancing because music was good, it was dancing because I was bored and I
like dancing.  Although I really *love* mornings, I was ready to leave when
my friends suggested it (around 7am).  So in case you didn't go, and you
are regretting it - don't - maybe you would feel about it the same way I do
- it was an OK party, but can't compare with many, many other parties I've
attended it the past, and I know I will not go next year.  I am happy so
many other people had fun :) - at least not everybody felt the same way I
did...

Good parts of the party:
- it was warm, and it was nice to be able to dance in a T-shirt all night
- hanging out with my best friends and being silly
- seeing people I know and chatting with them
- getting candy in the morning from this really nice girl who was dancing
close to us for a while
- exchanging smiles with this cute boy while dancing and running into him
at the gas station after the party

Not so good parts of the party
- this guy who was "out" of it and kept dancing close to us and screaming
"Where is Pete?  There he is!" while pointing to the sky.  He was jumping
around, hitting people (by accident, because he was so out it - one of my
friends tried to talk to him, but the guy was gone).  I hope he was OK -
hope somebody managed to help him....
- flashlights - can anything get more annoying than people walking on the
dance floor and flashing lights in your face while you are dancing
- no trash cans - it would be great if there were more places to put your
empty water bottles and other trash - for $25 that's the least that could
be provided.
- dust and people constantly asking me if I had vapor rub in my dust mask
- MUSIC (I already bitched about that one)
- seeing the accident on the way back.  I hope nobody got majorly hurt (I
saw somebody on the strecher, but hope they are OK)

Hi you all,

Question for any of you who were at Freedom-  Who was the DJ spinning in
the Jungle tent from about 9:30-12:30 and what would you call the style
he was spinning? He was spinning sort of a trancy hip-hop- smooth, legato
bass lines, hip-hop beats etc.  

Also this being my first post here's a quick intro-  I just moved out here
from NY.  Totally new to the SFrave scene and fairly new to the rave scene
in general though I've been listening to electronic music and computer
music for a while (even write some)- sort of came to the electronic dance
scene via the more experimental electronic music as well as a longstanding
interest in rhythmically based folk traditions (India, North Africa, West
Africa).  Anyhow glad to see a thriving scene out here, If any of you all
would like to meet up with me I'd love to meet you- drop some mail.
(either at this account or my new account pchordia@cisco.com).

Nada Brahma
Peace

Parag

Well Instead of working at a party I deceided to party at a party.. I had a
piece of mUshroom pizza and off I went. too bad I completley forgot who I
was, what was going on and how to walk. I uh finally ended up sleeping in my
car and waking up to see a massive amount of people on the hill and the sun
was coming up! 

Good things: Doran's set... every other Dj's set was just a lot of bass soup
in my head... the visuals were ok.. trippy when you are sober. Scary as all
hell when you are not. 
Bad things... The distorted sound in the morning. the HUGE amount of people..
too many. the dust and the wind... and the really nasty port o potties...
YUCK! 
Oh well, lesson learned.. stick to working at parties. no more mr fungus! 

Lemme think... people I remember seeing...
Terry,Siphon,Greg,Ben&Iris,Pengo,Bill,Josh,the rest are a big puddle inside
my mind.. oh and I guess I was somewere near mr doughboy cause I kept on
getting jolly ranchers or something?? Geez!

That was me. =) I was playing downtempo mainly - some might call it trip-hop.

You must not have been where I was:  Front and center of the DJ about 10
people back.  There was SO much energy there and it was between the
speakers so that it wasn't ear-splitting.  I stayed put there for
literally hours and hung out with one of my best friends, Ken, his
girlfriend and also Ethan and Reagan. It was so much fun:  I met folks
dancing next to me and we shared smiles and "holy shit this mix is
great" - type vibes.  You can usually find lots of high energy dancing
when you are near the dj and it was full on at Freedom! 

love,
Amy

some foolish thoughts for a monday morning....

Everyone has a photographic memory. Some don't have film.

I feel like I'm diagonally parked in a parallel universe.

Honk if you love peace and quiet.

A day without sunshine is like, you know, night.

I just got lost in thought. It was unfamiliar territory.

Atheism is a non-prophet organization.

On the other hand, you have different fingers.

Nothing is fool-proof to a sufficiently talented fool.

Hey Mr nStuff!
(hi to Jondabomb and Matt early in the night in the tent!)
The rest of the peole I saw were all ol' faces from the East Bay tent area whom I haven't rocked out with in ages.

Okay, here some responses from Mr. 2 for Mr nStuff ---> we've gotta hook one day and go out dancing brother!

(Katie- Sorry I didn't talk to you more @ Freedom! You're a very very cute girl! :-)
 ------
+ They were playing some really groovy tunes. But...It's all about bringing
+ some cardboard boxes next year to dance on, to vend off them "bad groove
+ trips"

Next year let's do that man.  I think I tripped over 100 rocks Saturday night.  Check out my shoes too!

+ I am having trouble understanding this line. I think your saying that you
+ danced your booty off during the DJ Spun set. But SPUN only succeeding with
+ four mixes?

Yes, my bugged out post meant to say Spun had four great tracks in a row that he played, and made me shake my butt away, like you do too.  Some tweeker in a Troy Aikman jersey got up on the laser booth and tried to be like Superman n' stuff.  My friend and I said, "Jump!"

I heard the music stop in the jungle room as well. I heard someone knocked a speaker over.
Hey, that was the smoothest dance floor you could  have the whole night man!

Peace, Mr. 2

It's mind over matter, if you don't mind,  it doesn't matter.

Wow, freedom was so increditbly WONDERFUL!!!!!!

I had sooooooo much fun hanging out in the VIBERATION tent and meeting 
all these happy people!!!!  You guys were great!  I had sooooo much fun 
dancing with my friends for a while.  And the vibe was so good.

The lasers were soooooo sick!  They were amazing!  I loved that video 
screen they had running.  They had some awsome visuals going.  The music 
was great.  Some of the DJ's had some sick ass sets.

I hope all of you got to see the beautiful sun raise on top of that big 
hill (huff,puff, my legs hurt from that still!)!!!!  It was 
soooooooooooooo pretty! =)

Love you all and lots of huggie hugs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Paula

Yellow,
I'm hoping that someone out there has some music business knowledge they
could bestow on a poor, uneducated, guy who's band has unpublished material
being played on the radio.  (That would be me.)

The situation:  We recorded an EP for a tiny label back in '95.  We were
less than thrilled with the finished product, and we figured nothing would
ever come of it, so we never bothered to set up our publishing co., or even
file with BMI/ASCAP for writers credits.  Well, the EP was finally released
a few months ago, and to our complete surprise, it's doing fairly well on
college radio stations.  

The question(s):  Obviously we would like to see some money from this
unexpected turn of events,(new instruments...yum) that means getting the
publishing and writers credits taken care of, has anyone out there done
this before?  The choice for DYI operations seems to be between BMI and
ASCAP, anyone have any feedback?  I've heard ASCAP is EVIL, but BMI makes
it hard to get the application to become a publisher... not that I can
decipher the stuff they have sent me.  

Our label boss recommends seeing an entertainment lawyer, anyone been
there/done that?  How much would that cost?

Any info/feedback would be extremely helpful!  You may want to respond
privately,  so as not to bore everyone any further...

Thanks in advance..nstuff

Dear Sf Raves

I just started going to raves on New yrs, and in my time since i have been to
many parties w/ great vibes. I think i have been spoiled from all the happy
parties i've been too.  Yesterday I went to the Vans Warp tour, it was my
last punk show i will ever attend. I was happy to see Jil (CHeerioHN), big
huggz. I love the music, but the vibe was not there. if i wanted negativity i
would just stay home. i go out to have fun, and see people give hugz, and
give hugz. but not to see people get hit in the head. Violence doesnt make me
happy. i know right now i sound like a PLURY raver. But i don't care, that is
who i am i guess. I am who i am, and i'm prouyd to be in SF underground
SCene. and i'll see you many times soon.

Hope to see everyone at @spire.

love you all 

jeremy

hi people...

does anyone know if that girl survived the crash on Vasco Rd. heading 
back from Freedom?  I hope she's ok...it was a pretty bad crash.  It 
looked as though she may have been thrown from the car.  the jeep was 
in the middle of the road on its side when I saw it.

transitions:

this message reminds me of where I came from before I started going to raves/parties.

here's a brief history of jsl's music past:

soul/funk/70's music -> rolling stones/wagner -> david bowie/devo/gary numan -> front 242/skinny puppy/clock dva/foetus -> rap (gangstah)/rap(political) ->
house music all night long -> house/jungle -> ???

I love music.  Sorry about the bad vibes at your former haunts, it's sad to let the things of the past go sometimes, but it's a sign of growth.  Revel in it and most of all , enjoy the music.

Pax,
John

I posted about this a long time ago (about a month). I wondered who would be attending the Lilith Fair. So far I have the following people going:

Myself
Cristine (candy girl) (luv ya)
Erin Connolly
Joe H (are you going to make it?)
dorena
Max Vision

If anyone else is going let me know, so maybe we can all meet up. I have never been to Shoreline before, so I don't know any good meeting  spots. Is shoreline really big? Is it even possible to meet up with fellow sfravers? Feedback & comments & questions are appreciated much.  Hope to see a lot of beautiful peeps tomarrow. 

Mad luvin and hugin,
Julie
*fairy princess*

This is George, not Erin.  I'm borrowing Erin's account, eh?  Anyways, 
It's going to be a wonderfully estrogenic concert. Female tenderness,
compassion, and beauty.  Oh, my.  I'll probably get there at 5:30.  Maybe
we can meet at one of the secondary stages.  How about the second stage
for leah andreone's set?  I think it will be crowded, and if I don't meet
up with you all, that's ok.  love to you anyways.

Here's the lineup.  Wouldn't it be nice if there were dj lineups like this
available at raves?  *hint*hint*

                       Time Start Time Finish      Stage
      Gates Open       3:00pm
      Lauren Hoffman   4:05pm     4:25pm      Village Acoustic
      Mudgirl          4:25pm     4:50pm      Second
      Leah Andreone    5:05pm     5:25pm      Second

Hey, kids.  I picked this post up on the Washington DC/Baltibore Ravelist.
I thought it was funny & scary & beautiful  & kooky all at once.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Boy,  I haven't truely danced an gotten into the trance for about two weeks
now and  I feel incomplete ,I feel lost. I'm trying to moderate my going out
but its got me hooked like crack and there's no place to hide. I need to lose
myself so I can find myself. Yea, thats it, I need to get lost in it, tossed
in it, let it take me to the place of no names or walls to be free from the
prizm that I cannot see that I build up in my mind when I 've been away from
it to long. I need to be released, and our beloved music is the only thing
that can do it. My love has been so deep for this that my own girlfriend of 3
1/2 years broke things off with me 4 months ago because she was jealous.
Isn't that a trip. And the funny thing is that it doesn't bother me one bit
because I know the music will be with me till the end of time!

                                I gotta run wild!
                                I need to unwind!
]                               I gotta be free!

Sup?
	I'm not gonna give a huge Freedom review except that it was Bomb as 
Fuck!  I wore my Happy Face Shirt with a Hit of Ass-Id on the tongue.  I 
just want to know if anyone else went to "Plastik" in August of 1995?  I 
went to Plastik which was at the same location as Freedom.  At Plastik, 
in the morning I saw everybody run up the Hill while the Sun was rising.  
I was NOT one of them and regreted it.  2 years later, I go to Freedom 
97 and was so excited when I found out it was in that same location.  I 
thought/knew that this would be my chance to redeem myself by going up 
the Hill in the morning.  I was with a special someone that night and 
told her to meet me at the tent at 5:30AM so that we can walk around 
together and talk.  As soon as we met at the tent, it 'clicked'.  "This 
would be perfect.  I can have my walk and climb the Hill I always wanted 
to with Her"!  We climbed the 1st hill and then saw the second & taller 
hill and climbed that one.  I took a picture of her with the whole party 
behind her in the background.  It's Beautiful.  I Love The Gathering 
Parties...

Now god damnit, it's ON ON ON.

This is like Tribe Called Quest and Latyrx playing live in London or
something.

I personally will be trying to show them that this Bay is ready for them
and their friends to come make us shake our heads, screaming Whoah, but
needing MO.

So watch for the unhappy looking, but very very happy honkey with the
Orioles hardhat on.  I am going to be a mess, I can feel it already.

HEADLINE OUR CITY, lads, VSF GONE SHAKE.

Pax,
MAX

Hey Everyone!!!!!
Gee what a weekend hunh!?!!! First a nite of spectacular fire works, a day of
skateboarding (and slurpee drinking) And there i was off to FREEDOM. Now I've
never been to one before, i knew a lot about it cuz everybody was talkin
about it, but i had no expectations. The windmills on the way casted all my
troubles, bad thoughts and whatever was on my mind into the wind, leaving me
totally centered on what it was that was going to happen later that evening.
When we pulled up, i was beyond excited, here was this track thingy in the
middle of two mountains, and a whole buncha tents. I got there real early,
the sound wasn't on yet, and others were settin up camp. I walked around, saw
some friends, checked out the area, got in trouble for climbing the big
hill(i guess they were saving the view for sunrise!) And set up our little
sanctuary of a tent. Then what i believe to be mozart(i don't know my
classical artists) came on, now that was the only scary music i heard the
whole evening. weird deep gothicish music really really loud! Then the kick
ass sunset hand holding almost a circle  rush into the middle and get down
thingy started the smile on my face that never went away!! WOW,  thank you to
everyone of you that went and added to the awsome incredable vibe that was
goin on, thanks for makin my nite oh so yummy! I was lucky enough to run into
Pyro and got a big *hug*, and i met only beth(b.) at the 2:00 meeting i
expected more but there was mad peeple in the area so o-well next time
rite!!??!!I didn't wait for long i was really inta Noels sic bomb-ass set wow
that was fun!! Well then a big B-L-U-R. YAY off to dance up the mountain, and
watch the sun make its daily apperence, what a cool thing i got
lots-o-photos! So then it was time to dance away the energy that was left,
and close camp and head out i had to meet my ride to warp tour at 10am and it
was 9am, i had just enuf time to scrape the 1/8 inch of dirt off that coated
my body, but no time to sleep, warp tour, was the exact opposite of plur~talk
about bad vibes, i used to be all inta punk rock but i do believe my likes
have changed!! Whoa, what a competative un friendly scene! i didn't mind it i
guess back then but now that raves have totally changed my ways i can't
handle the bad vibes, but i got to see Jeremy, so i got a hug YAY! I was
sleepy and got really sunburnt! now im payin for it all, im sick , so im
takin next weekend off, im gunna stay in my hermitge and drink tea So you
kids have an excellent week, don't werk to hard, and watch the pretty
sunsets!!
Mad love and HUGS out there and of corse 
P   L   U   R

Ok.. Deepfog is my like..E-mail buddy n'all that..

All jokes set aside though. I am compleatly serious.  I tell you, me being
a headrosexual male at the ravEs. I get verbally gay bashed more than any
of you Homosexuals do..Or how did my friend Lu say it?..Newsexual.
 

Unfortunetly, things are getting worse everytime I go...People are now
coming up with other things to call me. This time,  very negative things to
be spreading around about someone. VERY uncalled for. And pretty soon, I
might have to go postal on some of these little ones just to keep from
getting hurt physically. And ofcourse, this will make me look like the bad
guy.
Food for thought...I skinny baseball bat hurts alot more on impact than a
phat baseball bat. I am very skinny. =]

Anyways. I am just being weird today.
I love the ravE scene still. But there really should be an age limit.. Like
anyone that can act there age is aloud in.

I got it though! Once I feel up to spinning at a ravE.. (Which will happen.
I have alot of confidence in my ability to "catch the break") Anyways.. I
will just wear a giant Dread Lock wig so no one knows who I am.. Get the
whole ravE pumping with my knowledge of "whats tasty & whats not" Then
before my set is over.. Bust out with the phat red Nike sweat jacket and
tear off the wig... SURPRISE!!  Walk off stage.. Aw yea..

Mr Attitude is waking up..!


Thats it for now. I ran out of time. Cannot reply to any further posts at
this time.
Night night Mr nStuff

And for the misinterpreted people.. I am not a violent person.
Peace in your base ball cap.

Jeff

Hmmmm, why weren't people dancing..

All my humble opinions set aside. I am going to go with the fact that the
rocky Mars like terrain kinna threw everybody off time.

Thats the only thing that kept me off the dance floor. It certianly wasn't
tom thumb in the corner making chicken sounds in my direction.

You know what?  I feel funny today.  It's hot too.

The sound quality was hell of phat at FREEDOM though wasn't it.

Jeff on the left.

So anyways I take my Japanese exchange student to Freedom.

It was his first raving experience...except for a small prelude at CF's 4th
of july party,

I don't think he's even *heard* techno music.

We get there, set up camp, and I give him a lil prEsEnt.

Then he disappears for like 6 hours or something!!!!

I finally run into him in the morning...He's sweatin like crazy, covered
with dust, and has a big smile on his face.

I ask him, "Where the hell were you all night, I was worried!"

He says, "I ras dancing, and I couldn't reave my spot, cuz someone else
would take it...........
                  and it ras the *best* spot!"

I love raving!

much love and energy,

Terry

Hey all!

I'm not part of the SFRaves list, so you probably don't know who the 
hell I am.  My name is Todd and I'm a SoCal raver.

This weekend I got to go north and party with you guys for a change.  
What a great weekend.

It started off by going to a small gathering by Cloud Factory in 
Monteray with friends from San Jose.  Great loction, small vibey group 
of people, Chai...what more can you ask for?

Sat. was Freedom.  What a great party!  A little too much house music 
for my ears, but everyone else seemed to go ff on it, so it's all good.  
Thank God for Jon Williams.  He always seems to kick my ass!

As for Daniel not showing up....He was in Arizona on his way to Roswell 
New Mexico.  Did he know he was on the flier for Freedom?  Who knows.  
All I know is that he has been planning on playing the 50th annyversary 
of the Roswell crash for sometime now.

Sunday we went to Sunset.  What a great location and a great group of 
people, too.  Again, more disco house music.  You guys sure like that 
stuff, don't you?  We don't get much of it down here anymore.  In LA it 
would have been all trance or breaks.

Well, that's about it.....

Thanx all for the great weekend!!!!!!!!!!!!


love
Todd

Someone asked for the site to view the pictures from mars
so here they are...incredible stuff.


" martian tv reports that the large object that fell
from the sky today was not an alien craft but a weather
balloon...."

 
etimated landing time 10:70 am pdt  at 19.5n 32.8 w
btw. 19.5  is the same as the pyramids on earth and
the eye of jupiter and the exact location of 
a 3d merkabahs intersection with a sphere.

The sittuation: I have this boy from Belgium flying in on Friday 
afternoon. He spins hip hop, pretty much exclusively, and I really 
don't know the what on any hip hop clubs, shows, parties, etc. around 
here. (I've been searching around on my 'puter for info, but it keeps 
getting all wacky.) He really wants to see what the bay has to offer 
in that department, and I know there's stuff out there..... welp, he's 
gonna be here until the 26th of July......if anyone has any 
information, or recommendations, please drop me a line! I'd appreciate 
it greatly!!! thanks....

Just to inform everyone who went, and saw the accident as they were leaving:
I met the female that was in the accident, at the gas station on my way out
and gave her a big HUG. She was upset, but otherwise fine. The car, or jeep,
was pretty much totaled, but she got the rear view mirror, which is always
good to have! The person on the stretcher was her boyfriend, don't quote me
on that one though, and he was ok, just road rash on one arm and a bump on
the noggen. She had insurance and a ride and was with friends, so she was ok.
That concludes this portion of SFR's news report on 'the accident at
Freedom.' Now back to our regularly scheduled programming.......

I just had the funniest conversation with my Mom and I thought I'd share 
it all to you...

I was overhearing her talkin to my Dad about her going somewhere with a 
bunch of her friends...she walked out of her room, and while sitting here 
reading mail, and not really paying attention to her I impulsivly raised 
my voice to ask her...

" Where ya going? "

Not really paying much attention to me and not really feeling like giving 
me the long answer she half-sarcastically asnwered...

" Nowhere "

I jokingly replied...

" Well gee, that's a lot of people that want to go Nowhere with you..."

And, in kind of a half-dazed state, she replied...




" Well lots of people want to go nowhere..........All the time "




I was quite amuzed, and  hope you are to :P

Stay Cool!

Wow - Wow - Wow.. I spent 3 week in Thailand and had the most fun out of every place I have ever been. I went there to trek though the country and found everything you did not. 

I would tell all go to Thailand!! The true essence of the rave can be found on the island of KOH PHANG YANG...

I was in Thailand for 3 weeks this last January (the cool season - man,
do I pity you!) and unless you have somebody who speaks Thai you are
going to be S.O.L.
I spent 2 weeks in Bangkok and if you do not know where to look for such
things (flyers, stuff like that) you probably won't find anything.
Granted, I was there to meet my fiancee's family and I wasn't there
necessarily to party, but I was seriously on the look out for something 
cool to go to.
I suspect that most of these beach raves (if they truly exist on a
regular basis) are organized by people that are not native to Thailand.
The other thing is this: When you go out looking for these types of
parties here, you usually go to record or DJ stores or cool clothing
outlets where people know what is going on. In Thailand those places are
almost impossible to find (I looked unsuccessfully) and record stores
are completely non-existant.

Anyway, if I was you I would look for U.K. sponsored stuff where they
have special events booked over there or something. I wouldn't wait to
get to Thailand to find out.

I copied this from a poster at Freedom.

Your biggest responsibility in life is to love yourself. 
Only when you  make a commitment to love your 
body and soul in every aspect can you make a positive
change for your self or others. Do not forget that you 
are the most divine and special creature you will ever
meet. Inside of you is planted a seed of light  and
the capacity to make anything come true. As you
become aware of this tremendous power invested in you
a great power will be put into your hands.
This responsibility is to act out the truth and love and to 
make your life the most wonderful and exciting 
experience possible. As your inner light begins
to glow and expand, other peoples light will 
become activated and set in motion. The more
love you have for yourself, the more you will
radiate to others. love is contagious.The amount
available is limited only by your imagination.
As each days unfolds you will see how life transforms
itself according to the energy you have chosen to live
by. Never fear other peoples judgement, you are always
justified for the sole reason that you are a living creature
on this earth. Understand that having a good time and
being happy is your mission here in this time and place.
You are a vital part of a much bigger plan to replant
the seed of love on this planet. Live the light.


I want to make posters like this to hang at 
partys.If you have any thing similar to this
or poems, sayings...etc that you would like 
to be a part of this send them to me and 
if you would like to help in making these posters
also let me know.
We can get together for some pizza and tunes
and get out the fluorescent paints and glitter and
markers and make inspirational posters...

and any producers that want these hanging 
at you next party also email me.

You know. I am really sorry for sounding so evil on the list an all.


This message was originally spoken for one person on the list. but I want
everyone to listen.



I am pretty depressed right now. And I am still hearing voices to. Which is
annoying, because they are the voices of the evil villinz nStuff.}:\ I seem
to take them with me after the rave. I know that these people make it
difficult for me to communicate, but alot of it is still my fault. I need
to make some changes agian, adjust. I don't want to say, I am going to quit
doing that, or do this more often, but I need to work things out. And what
ever comes and goes during that time will just have to be delt with. You
know what I mean? But friends will always be friends.

It's strange. It's like, I feel it when people are listening to me talk.
And I know at an instant when someone does not understand what I am saying,
or gotten lost in my conversation, instantly. But what sucks is that, I
feel it when people are just listening to me talk to judge me, listening to
the tone of my voice searching for anomalies. Like "oh that sounded alittle
salty, he must be gay, I am going to go tell my friends" I sence this kind
of stuff. And I have even gotten proof that what I senced was right. Dozens
of times. Almos all the time. It's almost as if, I know exactly what there
feeling before they even articulate the feeling them selves. It's like I
really got to start saying "I know what your thinking" or "I know what your
trying to accomplish" But that would be crazy..So I have gotten proof, so I
have been right in the past. But what if I am not right? I would sound like
a compleat loonie. I just wish the sences would go away. I wish I wasn't so
perceptive. You know? Sounds crazy huh?

There are very few people in the ravE scene that seem to be-able to
communicate with me, or me communicate with them. People that come up to me
to talk, not just listen. I don't expect someone to do all the talking.
That is crazy. What I am saying though is, very few people in the scene
will actually come up to me, to meet me..Ask me some question, try to get
to know me. Errr.. This is all so crazy. But it happens all the time. Most
people just listen into my conversations to cast judgement. I know it's
because I am mysterious (or how do they say it in the 90's? Weird) I am
sure that I look very difficult to aproach, but I am not. You know? First
impressions are not everything. The truth of the matter is, you can not
judge people by the first impression. No one can truly know someone that
quickly.

And what is going on here around me at the raves. Totally wrong. People
either assume, or simply hear things from other. And then they just sniff
around me searching for clues to proove it. And ofcourse because they are
thinking it, they only grasp for signs that seem to point to there
assumtions. And because everyone wants to proove there right, they only
really search for what there thinking. Instead of getting the real picture.
You understand what I am saying?

And it's not all there fault. It's mine. It's my fault for closing up, or
coming off wrong because of the fact I am sencing there intentions, there
motives, or there beliefs. So the high perseption I have seems to backfire.
And I can't help it. It's like I am thinking.."Oh no, there thinking this
or that" and I get all ... Quiet agian.

It really sucks. A person with suicidel tendencies would have killed them
self long ago if they were in my shoes. Thats how much pressure I take in.
When a doctor says "you may feel alittle pressure here" to me.. It's like..
"Doc, you obviously do not have a clue as to what pressure is"

And stab me in the back. I could be the one casting to much judgement. I
just want it to stop being like this.

But it is a fact that these people are being wrong.
And the really weird part is. I don't hold a grudge with any of them. I
care for all concious beings. I don't want to see anyone lose them selves.
Even if it means losing myself to avoid it. I may despize, be hastey, or
not like someone for certian reasons. And only when thoughs reasons go
away, will I feel comfortable around them. And the reasons I am referring
to are incorrect feeling. I know what is right and what is wrong. And these
people have no right to act on there assumptions without searching for
solid verbal answers by inquiring them. And then, for them to go around
spreading there assumptions to other people is almost worse than committing
murder. When a person dies, they die who they are...But if I die right now,
thanks to these people..I die who everybody thinks I am. And they are
wrong...

I really do try to do everything right. There's just alot of things that I
can't seem to..Do right. You know?

Night nStuff.

Hi,

 I just hope that your flyers address the music style. I would really hate
to drive all the way down there to listen to trance all night. I do enough
trancing listening to breaks.

 Night, night.

That problem is now turning into more than just fag.
Jealous fools now threaten me behind my back. And more.




I am not homophobic. They are.
Bottum line. The shit really gets old.
And on that note. I would like to say to all "thoughs people" out there.
Speaking of old. My dance may get old to you. But there is always someone
out there that will still enjoy it. Atleast for the first time! So shut the
f*#! up. And keep your defencive opinions to your self.  Sorry. 



You know?
Argh.. Oh.. I need to goto bed.

hi there
we are all the same
i read your message
and we all feel the same thing to a degree
you are not alone
you are a very sensitive being to be feeling all of that right now
but you are all of us reading/feeling/being
this is such a great forum for expressing all feelings
like the universe is too
please be nice to your self
we all want you to be nice
i too have felt that 'oh i know what they are feeling or thinking
because their feelings/thoughts emit or cause vibrations
that i can feel
and sometimes i believe i can read their mind
or heart or something like that
like all our feelings go right through one another
im not sure what im saying
i hate really 'saying' things
i like being
things
you know what i mean
you all do
this screen you look at to be your self
to view your self through someone else
we all feel you
thank you
love
love
love
love
love

What's up everyone,

I went to this new weekly event called Ultra, if you're into drum and
bass you should definetly check it out, the place where it was at is
called VSF, its a very cool location, with two rooms and a  chillin
rooftop balcony.

Then it was off to MAD where some good bumpin tunes were played, and it
looke like a lot of people were having a good time dancing, I'm stoked
cause I got a Freaky Chakra vs. single cell orchestra poster.

have a good day everyone!

Pete

Got to the city late to find the club hadn't started on time. Once we
got in we chilled to mudfoot while chomping on the cheese, crackers
and vegetable munchies: yes, the place was in style with free food to
boot!

Anyways, J.Majik hit the decks around 11 or so and started pretty
techy with a VIP mix of the last Optical track. The floor got full
pretty fast as he laid down dub-plate one after another and soon the
vibe was very thick.

MC Justice put on his wireless mic and started layering some very
smooth rhyming over the top and then the crowd really grooving. I've
got to say, Justice was the surprise of the night: Easily the most
reserved MC I've ever seen. He knew when to hype the crowd a little
and when to step back from the mic like during some of Ed Rush's set,
who came on around 12.

Ed had a pretty incerdible set, starting off very mellow and slowly
building from deep rollers into incredibly dark and trancy steppers.
By the end the crowd was seriously going apeshit when he dropped a
track off the No U-Turn album. People were shouting and slapping
hi-fives: it was a zoo!

Anyways, Doc Scott finally stepped up to the plate and started
dropping some really interesting tracks. I only got to stay through a
third of his set, but it was very, very tight when I left.


 For the people I still hear saying 'You can't dance to jungle'...oh
my gosh...there were a few hundred nutters proving you wrong last
night! I have never seen so many smiles and looks of awe in a CLUB
before. 

Finally, Thanks to FTT for bringing the tour into sf.

-peace-

Gotta agree with you about Ultra.  The tracks were lean, and the breaks
clean.  J Magic cut some smooth tricks, and Justice was on the ball.  I was
gutted coming home from an 8 month stay in London, you all could imagine.
 Bringing the boys out is great.  Last night hit as hard as any Thursday at
the Leisure Lounge, or Sunday night at the Blue Note.   Bukem is right around
the corner, see you guys there.

No, you're not.  Freedom wasn't a rave, it was a huge high school party
without kegs.  I will not be attending another.

If you are not dancing, get the FUCK off the dance floor.

on the same (sorta) subject, does anyone know what happened to the guy

HI EVERYBODY!!!

My name is Charmayne, but most people know me as the Gabber Girl.  I just
joined your list recently . . . I'm from Minneapolis, living in Chicago
right now with my boyfriend Matter.  We are moving to Oakland, CA at the
end of the week!!!  I'm really looking forward to being a part of the bay
area scene!  I went to "Trust:Surrender", and it was the best event I've
ever been to.  The people were so  great!  Down to earth, smart,
happy--well, you know who you are!  I hadn't been to a party near that fun
since the early 1800's . . .

About me:
I appreciate every kind of music(despite all my jokes about house), but I'm
a dj that likes extremes--hard acid, hard gabber, noisecore, speedcore,
gaabbahaus, old school midwest style hard tekno, and intense, mental
jungle.  Anything that your mother would not approve of!  I like gettin
under people's skins as much as I love makin people dance!  Do not be
afraid--I won't hurt you!  Just cuz hardcore is my favorite doesn't make me
an icky person.

In Minneapolis, I was promoting small-scale hardcore events as Warrior
Princess Productions.  That's how I met Matter--he did a live pa at my last
party.  We were just crazy enough for each other that it worked out!

ATTENTION DJ'S AND RECORD COLLECTORS:

I got this post off of Mw-Raves.  It's from Mr. Bill of Milwaukee, WI.
Thought you might be interested!

howdy all,

 my name is bill, MR.BILL to most of you. as some of you might or might
 not know i make flight cases for a living.you know they're
 black(mostly), they have silver edges and steel corners with twist tyle
 latches. some of you might even have one from me.well im letting those
of
 you that dont know about them.prices start at $60 and go up from there.
 the basic size (half case) is 6.5" inside with black carpet inside.
they
 hold about 50 records. the next size up holds about 90 orso and costs
 $80, then theres the monster, holds over 100 disks has two handles and
 weights a ton full(for the marathon sets). that one costs $110. If you
 want to know more call me. my number is 414.372.2010, im at my shop mon
 thru fri 10am to 4 pm.I also make cases for turntables and amps ,and
all kinds of things.if you want a quote just ask.

 thanks for the time.

 bill wilson
 "MR.BILL"

 "rock on" dudes!

There was quite a few posts after this one of people that own his cases and
have highly recommended his work.

Well, I have to go and finish packing!  See ya in a lil bit!

---[snip]---

On an almost daily basis the public is being subjected to media misinformation on
the dangers of GHB. The bias and ignorance of the media is evident by the
appellation "Great Bodily Harm" (GBH) applied to Gamma HydroxyButyrate. A
close inspection of the facts as revealed by modern scientific research however,
reveals that, contrary to most media and government "reports," GHB is not only
very safe, but extremely beneficial. So safe, in fact, that CARL has a standing
offer of a $10,000 reward for any scientifically documented permanent harm
caused to anyone by ingesting up to 50 grams of pure GHB alone! 

---[snip]---

Mostly when I've heard of someone hurting themself with GHB it has been in
conjunction with other chemicals, usually a depressant.  Mixing drugs is a 
good way generally to hrut oneself.  

This doesn't make it okay that this happened, though.  Anyone got the real
scoop about what happened at freedom?

Ironically, Martin just yesterday was asking me if the rumours of death had
started on SFR yet... (last Gathering/Nomad Interactive, etc...) The person
pulled through ok.

Try the club called Deco in the outskirts of the tenderloin. Especially
tuesdays, when various members of the scratch picklz (usually) hold
court... I can't remember exactly where it is, but I'm sure it's in the
phone book, and they usually have ads in the guardian/chronicle. If you go
there, you'll probably pick up some leads for other places.

It sounded good!

 Unfortunetly, I am not much for the downtempo thing. The beat is just to
repetative for me. It's like "ah 1 and ah hm, hm. ah 2 and uh mh mh.Zzzz..
I don't know.
 I like the stuff that, perhaps it was Noel was spinning? After the
DownTempo set thingie.. Hardstep or Tekstep maybe?

And. You might have noticed. I was the totally annoyed person standing
behind the DJ booth waiting for an uptempo beat to come on while getting
the flood light pointed in my face, while you were spinning..  Hi..!!!


Spin, spin sugar. Bah neh bah neh bah bah..
Peace nStuff
Jeff

I wish people wouldn't be allowed into the parties if all they were
interested in was the drugs. That's so fucking stupid. Have some respect
for yourself, your family and your friends. The pain you'll endure
when you OD is nothing compared to the pain that will never leave
those loved ones you leave behind.

The music is what I love and that's what it should be about. The joy I get
from the music is a million times more rewarding than any drug.

I think it's so sad that people slip away so young.. when they have so
much to look forward to. There is a whole world out there to explore. It's
not worth losing that opportunity for a night of drug use.

We should all look out for eachother and try to prevent senseless things
like this.

... Love the music, not the drugs.

I think it might be because we all like different speeds of music.
So if I like 180 beats per min and you are dancing
to the beat of a different drummer...say one that is
drumming at 120 beats per min then I might percieve
you as lagging because you are in a different time continuum 
or something like that and some one who likes 210 bpm
would see me as the lag. 

so we need a good cosmic dj to mix all our individual 
beats in to one texturally rich trac of peace and harmony

yanno i was there once, though.  every party i would go to i would 
take something.  now that has reversed, i hardly ever take anything 
and it surprises some folx.  so i don't know if i would go excluding 
those people, just the only thing we can really do as individuals is 
to stay in the positive zone and avoid the negative zone at all times.  

what are positive emotions?

desire
faith
love
sex
enthusiasm
romance
hope

what are negative emotions? (TO BE AVOIDED)

fear
jealousy
hatred
revenge
greed 
superstition
anger

why is this important?  because we want to positively reinforce these 
people so they will someday get out of their negative depressing world 
on their own.  the drug war is a bang your head against the wall deal, 
because it attempts to suppress the human nature of exploration.  

but if you see someone that doesn't look like they should drive, speak 
up.  

and if you see someone convulsing off ghb, help them.  if they die, 
mourn.  

then forget it.  cause they sealed their own fate.  it's not your 
problem.  

gotta go...-=dEEp=-

Well ladies and gentlemen, I am proud to announce that I'm back on the
list again.  When I unsubbed a whole two weeks ago, I had to deal with 14
units in school.  I've since dropped 8 of those units because I ended up
not having to take those classes.  As a result, I can now party.  It's
summer time and I'm going to live up to my capabilities.

It turned out that raving was like a drug and I was unable to go cold
turkey.  Instead I went to Sunset and Freedom soon after I unsubbed. 
(Had a dope ass time with Bryon and Rubi).  Therefore, I shall not be in
denial and I will go out as saying that I don't think I can ever stop
raving if I'm allowed to in the first place.

So anyways, just wanted to say hi to everyone and I can't wait to get
word of the killer parties and the killer ravers on this list.

Bye Bye

Sound fills my mind
lights dance on air
Our souls converge
My mind within yours
Reaching deep into your thoughts
Expressing feelings
Feeling expression
I look into your eyes
and see myself already there
peace
Kindred spirit...
Surprise
Acceptance
Understanding
Your soul
my solace
One mind
one thought
peace
Lights dance
Music beats the tribal drum
Heat
Unity
We are Kindred Spirits.......
By chance we meet
Destiny?
Fate?
Luck....
I am complete
lights dance
peace
Eyes closed... I see your form
Eyes closed... the music beats on
The sound fills my mind



hello to all,

I need to go again.. its been almost a month, and I'm looking for the next
perfect experience.
I wrote this after a very perfect evening.... thought I would share.
I have had incredible, wonderful experiences at all the Raves I've
attended, the last and best so far was F-8, on the Solstice.

Peace to all,

sandy

This reminds me.  Have any of you been to a party on the East Coast?  NYC
for example.  They usually have big ass turn outs and there's *always* kids
laying in the middle of the dancefloor giving big 20-person E massages.
While I myself like to see kids happy, it bothers me when I'm about to
stomp on some whacked-out ravers head or arm, or other body part.  It's
especially frustrating when the kids are all in their K-Holes and drooling
on themselves not moving.  I say, if you're gonna get fucked up, get fucked
to the point where you *can* control yourself and not pass out on the floor
and embarass yourself later.  Or at least pass out away from the dancing
area.  Maybe that's what the chill-out rooms are really for.   Just a
thought.....  Love Toy

Never having been subscribed over a summer before, I was wondering if
traffic here really slows down as a result of people going home from
school or vacations. I'm not complaining about the flow..just curious
what it's been like in past summers.

It's one thing to go for the music and enhance it with something else...
but to only go to get fucked up is another story.  You knew what I meant

Um.. ok, this is my Semi-rave related letter.  Glad everyone had a good time
at Freedom, sorry I couldn't make it.  As for up-coming parties.  What's
going on with True Love?  I haven't heard any news on it lately.  I'm
*hoping* nothing else bad fell upon this event's planning.  Other than that
I'll see you all this weekend @ Aspire, Or Infectious Grooves or wherever my
Teresimo decides to take me.
 Oh, and this is also a page for Annissa.  Could you drop me a line? I forgot
your e-mail address.  Thanks!

i've never been famous (or infamous) before. it's bloody good fun :)
especially since i'm normally a rather shy person and need a long time
to warm up to strangers. this is definitely the greatest vacation i've
ever had. we know so many people already, every party we go to we run
into people we know. it's great to be part of the sfravers family.
and meeting you, doughboy, was so much fun. i love your sense of
humour. this big smile on your face still makes me smile now.

yah damnit, where was everybody? well, we found lots of you throughout
the night: pengo, julie and the candy raver bunch, nice meeting
christine (candy girl), the south bay trance family (that adam
introduced us to. what are your names again? oh and don't ask me
complicated questions when i'm out of my face, please!), who else?,
byroni (who we came with, i love your bubble car), dErEk (where did
you disappear to?), rubilicious (you always look so yummy), amy and
sorry-i-forgot-your-name-melanie?-melissa?, 

adam - where were you?

ignore them! people who say stuff like that have no clue what the rave

freedom was wonderful. 
what's next?
anybody going to spiral tribe on the 16th?

It has been brought to my attention by a concerned list participant that my
signature is pretty rude . . . I'm sorry if I offended anyone, but I did
let everyone know that I am a gabber girl, and I appreciate house music (I
even love some kinds! I do live in Chicago!), but that I will joke about
it.  It's in my nature to joke around. In real life, I can't even kill a
bug, so why would I purposely want to hurt anybody's feelings?

I just wanted to clear this up before I recieve anymore warnings.  I might
change my signature sometime in the very near future (if I can find
something more funny).

Love, Gabs*

On a GHB note....
While I was working away near the fine capitol of California today, I
noticed a bill trying to classify GHB as a Class II ( i think) Controlled
Substance.  Looks like another drug is hitting the Illegal status.....Darn
lawmakers.... Love Toy =)

The problem certainly isn't isolated to mixing drugs.  GHB NEEDS proper
measurings otherwise it's all a gamble.  Often not the good one either.
For something that has so much risk involved, I don't see the joy of it.

Anyway I think people should steer clear of that and other substances.

should we."

Peace,

Hi,
Thanx to the 450 people that showed up last night and helped ULTRA go OFF!
For those who missed the show last night, the boyz from the Betalounge were
there recording the show both on video and audio. The audio version of the
whole show should be up on http://www.betalounge.com soon, and an edited
video version (including interviews with Ed Rush, J Magyck, Doc Scott and
MC Justice done on VSF's roof by Mudfoot) should be up by next week!!

We had some problems getting the ISDN line in on time, but once its
installed, we'll be bringing all shows from ULTRA live - both video and
audio, including interviews with all artists during the shows on VSF's
roof.

Next Monday 14th, we have some special guests that we hosted last year at
two parties... the one infront of city hall and the one at Mission Rock...
LTJ BUKEM, BLAME, CONRAD AND MC DRS. Bukem will be at the show... he had
some problems with his work permit, but we have settled that... be
there!!!

Monday July 14th
ULTRA Presents
LOGICAL PROGRESSION LEVEL 2
with LTJ BUKEM, BLAME, CONRAD AND MC DRS
Club VSF

I'm down for Cafe Kismet on Thursday.  I hope to see you all there too...
REGARDING LUNCH>>	
I know I mentioned that I would try and organize one, but I just CAN'T
think of a place for our beautiful presence.  Every place is too hard to find,
slow or expensive!!  I have heard some talk about having a dinner...
I know a great place we could go for that (cheap too) and of course we could
always dine at my place.  If you trust my cooking!  Need some feedback people.
I'm strapped for ideas.  I just want to make you smile, but you have to tell 
me what will work best!  South Bay isn't making fun for us, we have to make
it ourselves...

Does anyone else out there hate that "Thank heaven for little girls" Mountain
Dew commercial??  What are they getting at???

>I dunno...is it curing or is it THC?  I say curing, anyone else?

Not necessaraly, brown weed usually has to travel a great distance. Most of
it probably comes from Central America although I've heard of shipments
from Africa getting busted on there way here. Anyways it takes along time
to get from the plant to your pipe, bong, joint, or whatever, and it gets
really dried out on the way. The curing can have something to do with it
too. When they harvest these fields of "grass" they just yank out the
plants and let them dry in the sun (very, very bad).

Hi,
My partner (at FTT) and buddy Kevin and his friends were in a car right
infront of the jeep.... and saw the whole thing in the rear view mirror...
he told me that the jeep was travelling fast and went up the side of an
embankment and rolled over...
They slammed on their brakes and ran back to the jeep and started pulling
everyone out. He told me that only one of the guys there was badly hurt,
but the girl who was driving the jeep was hysterical. Kev was also put on
hold for about 10 minutes when he called 911 because the message kept
saying..."all operators are busy..please hold"...duh!!! Anyway, while some
of the crew were re-directing traffic... they tended to the kids while
waiting for the paramedics... and according to Kev... there were not in the
state of 'mind' to drive!! You can email Kev at email:kevon@funkytekno.com

Yeah! Only users loose drugs!  Uh...wait...
 
Ok, so what's more irritating, people who stand in the middle of the dance
floor, or people who are just interested in the drugs?  How about people
who stand or sit in the middle of stair cases while the rest of us end up
packed like cattle trying to get to the next room?  How about pushy 15 year
old dealers with a pocket full of Vivran?

I read LOTUS on the way home this weekend and one of the articals that
struck me was the interview with Kevin Reese Saunderson.  One of the
Detroit Techno inovators along with Juan Atkins and Derek May. If you have
the time I sugust you read it but the hilights for me.  He discusses
history of Detroit techno, the f@#ked up record distributors who but out
anything [music] for a buck, dancing as meditation and uplifting.
        He says "You know...most parties I've been to in America, there
like the worst parties I've ever been to in my life!...You get all these
damned people in a big party and all they do is stare.  There's no kind of
feeling- ... I went to a party in San Francisco recently [The Gathering]
that was one of the better ones I've done in America."

This makes me proud to party in this part of the country but ya know it's
not universal everywhere and this can only be done in America through
comunication, education, and spreading the vibe everywhere you go.

It has been said that SF has been the center point of many cultural and
sub-culture revolutions and we have the power, here in SF, to spread the
Love and Vibe around.  Make it be known that we are positive and that it is
possible for all to follow in the same footsteps everywhere.

Kevin also mentioned that the reason America doesn't have the vibe that
Europe has is because the attitude of the kids with their drugs in the
scene and that drugs DO make a difference in the vibe of a party.
"Honestly, in Europe, the main thing that helps people be a little bit more
spiritual, more into the music, is becasue of the drugs.  I know people
take drugs in America, but its different over there.  I've been to parties
[in Europe] where 90% of the people are on the same drug.  [They'll have]
30,000 peopleat a party and 25,000 will be on ecstacy.  In America, we have
more people on worse drugs and its harder to get 3 of 4 thousand people in
the same direction."

I haven't been every where KRS has been but I agree with his statement.  I
don't necesarlly advocate only exstacy use in our scene but if people would
lay off the drugs for a night and go for the purpose of the music or scene
would have more energy.

I don't have an answer myself just thoughts.  Read the artical or just make
your own opinion about the situation.  Take a step out a look at our scene
from the out side.  I see many young kids following blindly the older
generation and following the mainstream aspects of the scene : fashion,
money, power, drugs.  There is not much eduaction.  What happened to the
parties where the promoters or someone else would speak after the party and
explain the love the ravers had just experienced,  the e parties where only
e was taken and all who went just knew... Ya know?

"Let's party like the way we used to do it"  and then take it to another
level today through guidance, vibe, education, communication, and love.

peace!

Hey All!

Well I got to come up this weekend and do many things.  Dance my ass of was
my main objective and let me tell you I succeded..

About Freedom...

I feel I have come full circle after going to this party.  My first "real
rave" was Freedom in 93 and now I have completed 4 years of "the rest of my
life"..
I partied but I also thought (a lot) about the scene today and came to some
interesting conclusions..

First my party review...

We (my sister Lisa, Jil and friends) arived at 7.30 -the earliest I can
remember ariving at a party.  Sunset ceremony set the vibe and I was happy
all the way through till 9 am (13.5 hours of party WOW!)  We had a tent in
the front.
I think Doran started but for some reason I thought it was Josh.. The music
was fluid but most as inspiring as I had hoped.  Good mixing by Spun, Jon
Williams and Tony - Gotta lov 'em I always do.
I had seen many firends Sarvi, Jan, Raf, Dorena, Eric, etc. etc. I guess I
shouldn't list them all.  But I thought I was going to see alot more
recognizable faces.  (I guess many of my older friends are burnt out
already on the rave scene..)
Noel was sick.  I love that hardstep shit,  got me movin' but I kept
switching from him to tony untill Stacey Pullan came on.  I was tired and
thought I'll dance a few songs and rest but no!  SP would not let me!  My
body would not stop to this man's groove. I love that funky house.  That's
the shit I've been buying from the rekkid store but I don't have as much
quality music as he does.  The man was wicked with the switches and then
Roy Davis Jr. from chicago came on with some more of that funky chicago
house and he even sang to the key boards in the morning too.  Good artist.


        I caught some of Solustices live PA and it was good too but I
couldn't miss SP.  We all caught the sunrise on the hill, nice FREEDOM
touch..
People was all around great, friendly.  I met many people from around Cal.
The only person who gave me bad vibes was some one on this list... I know
cuz I saw the laminate and I tried to talk to him but he brushed me off
"what ever" and kept walking..  Hey, we all know there are assholes every
where, why not on the list too..  oh well.

There were no mounds this time which helped with the rock situation but no
trash cans so in the morning all the water bottles on the dance floor was a
big problem.  Was it me or did they blow some speakers by morning?  Did
anyone else see the guy dive off the scafolding where the laser was early
in the night?  IMHO there weren't enough toliets but I'm a guy so I
improvized.

The vibe: Great but it could have been better and this is where I started
to therorize.  I think that the reason there is no unity and togetherness
in the vibe is because of the diversity of the drugs in our scene.  There
were alot of people frying at this party which IMHO is not the best drug
for a positive vibe.  It can be very frightening, trippy, weird, and fun
all in one...
True the rocks and the dirt discurage many dancers but that doesn't mean
you can't wave your arms, shout, or spread the vibe...  Don't get me wrong
there were many dancers on the floor but there should have been more for
the music was the bomb!  I think it is the drugs that people do in this
scene that get people TOO f@#ked up to dance so they just want to sit and
listen or talk or trip or whatever... (For more on this read my post "Kevin
Saunderson in Lotus")

I've decided I'm going to concentrat more on the music side of our scene by
buying more rekkids and going to less parties.  I've already been doing
this because I live in SLO but I think "rave" is dieing.  Rave as in Peace,
Love Unity and most of all Respect for others, the space we party at and
especially yourself.  The Dancers are getting younger and they need to be
educated by our peers not the drug dealers or money hungery promoters.  I
think Martin does a good job of providing a good environment for the
Dancers but there are promoters out there that don't... It's happening all
over.

Well I haven't seen any events I want to look forward to so if you see me
it might be at an UG.  I might check out LA when I'm in Newport this August
but other wise... Take care all...

surely you jest... the traffic on sfraves NEVER slows!

seriously, i would guess that for every person who does home from school, someone else COMES home from school. like me! this truly is a wonderful place to come home to... i went to the lightseed party, comet, when i was here over spring break and i think that gave me the energy i needed to finish out the school year and pass all my classes. have i told you today how lucky we all are? I LOVE IT!

        "Brown" is more of a result of curing, it comes from when the weed
is dried. But it basically means the plant probably as much as it needed to
be, so most of the THC breaks down into CBNs, so more is needed to get high,
which is also different. So it could be made, but why?

 Don't worry, most of us understand that people who really love hardcore
tend to slam other things all the time and I think it's funny and cool. I
mean, look at any magazine that reviews hardcore records! Look at Massive or
something. Okay, then go try a hardcore party! It all makes sense to me. I
know hardcore is way underground in SF, but the scene does exist.(I know, I
went to a party to spin at that turned out to be a hardcore party. The guy
before me spun gabber and sort of scared people away.)

I read your post of the sf list and found one of the dopest people on the 
list, I am done flattering you now. I am in Seattle, WA. We don't have a 
hardcore scene (yet), except for 2 djs Nitsuj and R2Dj. Three weeks ago 
Nitsuj spun hardcore at a party called Apollo and the place went off. 
That is now my favorite type of underground dance music and so I've been 
checking the record stores for hardcore and it is non exsistant. Will you 
please tell me some record labels and ways to order hardcore vinyl. The 
closest thing I ve found is a song called speed ball but just sound like 
crazyass trance:\. Please travel up north to Seattle so we can dance for 
you;]
Peace,
Dougl@s
Ps: have you ever heard the hardcore record with the ONYX rap sample 
"Back the FUCk up!" its my favorite;]

Hi!

I'm the happiest SFRavers in SoCal right now.  
Why is that, Uncle Noah?  you may ask.
Well here's why:
1)  I bought my ticket to come up for True Love today :)
2)  I got one of the new sampling CDs I mailed ordered today :) :)
3)  I listened to Licensed to Ill all the way through for the first time 
since 1988 today :) :) :)
4)  I got some new records :) :) :) :)
5) I FOUND MY PHOTOS FROM THE CABIN PARTY!!!!! :) :) :) :) :)
6) THE NEGATIVES WERE WITH THEM SO I CAN PRINT THE ONES I LOST!!! :) :) 
:) :) :) :)!!!!

I was sooooooooo upset that I had lost these photos!  I had given a set 
of them to Joey, but they got lost somewhere in that mysterious vortex of 
a house he lived in back in Davis and I've been feeling really bummed 
about losing them lately for some reason.  And now I've got 'em!  They 
aren't great.  There aren't many of them.  I'm just happy they're back.

So anyway, now I'm going to go catch some Z's so I can maybe make it to 
werk on time tomorrow.

I miss you all and I will see you soon!
:)
-UncleNoah

Yep.  Guy in #8 Troy Aikman jersey, correct? He must of knocked everyone down in his path on his way up to the scaffolding.

My friends kept egging him to jump, one even wanted to throw this big rock at him, but I told him that would be kind of mean to do.  Anyways, I think he did jump after he saw the fireworks in the circle go off or something....

The vibe was the best within the area of the dancers in the front of the dj booth from the left to right speakers, and back.

o.k., here goes:
iris's theory on the difference between english and sf rave culture: 

(i'm just saying this again: this is a highly subjective view based on
my limited experience of both scenes. so don't hack me to pieces right
away. i'd appreciate some constructive input on this. i'm also not
judging or declaring one *better* than the other. i'm just theorizing.
we're talking different cultures here. ...and i like them both.:)

it took us 4 weeks to figure out that we were taking the wrong drugs.
e just doesn't go w/ the music here. the music is generally slower and
softer here. house and trance goes much better w/ acid. e is a drug
for stomping and bouncing. it requires hard fast music. acid is an
introvert drug while e is an extrovert drug. in england ravers don't
generally take acid at raves, everybody is on e, which binds the whole
mass of ravers into one, due to the enhancement of the empathic and
extrovert aspects. acid is a lonely drug and the house and trance
music takes you on this trip of your own. i think this is why people
here dance alone or in small groups detached from the world around
them. 

so why, i was wondering, do people here like it slow and introvert.
why is the rave scene here based on an acid experience rather than an
e experience. it's obvious. california is the birthplace of the acid
and hippie culture of the 60s. where do you think the candy raver
phenomenon comes from? am i the only one that thinks that candy ravers
are the hippies of the 90s? there is a strong acid/hippie tradition
here which is detectable in the preference for slow spacey music and
the smileys, colors, candies, love and peace and hugs and happiness.
oh, and aliens! england doesn't have this acid history, at least not
to the same degree. you guys are hovering above the earth while
english ravers are stomping the ground.

does that make sense? i'd love some input.

hmmmm.... i'll have to agree with you about e binding ppl together - and i
really prefer that atmosphere to one in which everyone is off in their own
world. this togetherness is what makes a party, imo. and from my own
experience, e really does turn me into the energizer bunny - i keep going,
and going, and going! gotta love it! i love the feeling i get when i'm
dancing around a room and making eye contact with other dancing maniacs -
it's a unified, happy feeling. warm fuzzy, almost, but a bit harder.

makes sense to me.... my experience in other places has been primarily with
e (or both), and judging from my one sole acid trip at a party - there
really is a different feeling produced. anyway, ppl here are a bit more
laid back - on the east coast we're all a bit more on edge, i think. but
maybe too, it's economics. e costs a hell of a lot more than a little piece
of paper. and my theory on the candy: when you're dancing your ass off all
night your body craves glucose in a big way. sugar is an instant fix. you
can tell when you need it if you start getting a headache. orange juice,
too. never mind the need to have something in your mouth!

cheers - e. :)

Strapped for time since I have to work in an hour. I have many ideas and good
friends in San Jose that can help us with locations, mostly outdoors and all.
Let's keep in touch and keep the ideas flowing. Also! I just started working
at Black Angus on Kiely and Saratoga, so if you want to meet me I work during
the lunch hours there, though i'm still training now. We could go there for a
lunch on some sunday through thrusday, and as long as there aren't like too
too many of us, I get 25% off! Anyway.....

Hi-

I was hanging out with a friend last week and he says,'Hey do you
remember the Woopy Ball??'. 

The woopy ball was a party in march of 92 that a friend of mine was
helping out at- a 2 day warehouse sleepover, basically. Even though I
didn't go, I still have the flier (a cheesy 2-color deal with dr.seuss
guy on front) and totally associate it with my early days of partying.

So yesterday I decided to check out the very first post to sfr in
march of 92.Nostalia time, check this out:

Subject: To start things off...


        Here's a list of some upcoming events I've heard about...

        Friday March 6th through Sunday March 8th - The WOOPY BALL - 
                yes, a weekend-long rave, taking place in Oakland.
                info: 1-800-894-9001. Should we have a meeting place?

        Friday March 6th - Primal Scream at the Warfield.
                okay, I know this isn't exactly "underground", but it's
                being billed as a rave, and rumors exist that the Orb
is
                gonna be there, too.....

        Saturday, March 7th - The Gathering
                This sounds great. Jeno, Garth, and Josh. 415-267-4800

        Friday, March 13th - Lunacy - 510-874-4924. Scott Hardkiss'll
be there.

        Friday, March 21st  - The Utopia Project presents Matrix - 
                510-874-4955

        I'd elaborate on each of them but I have to go to class in
about
ten minutes.....:)

        Wow! 35 subscribers in 24 hours! This may get gigantic......

        Brian

--------------------------------

(Sorry Brian, I don't know how many times this has been posted)

Anyways, I started browsing through the messages for that first month
of SFR and I was so psyched! People were posting things like "I just
bought a cd by some band named the orb"- no flames, just a bunch of
people psyched on the music and the scene. 

Noah was telling me yesterday about the first party SFR ever threw at
bonnie dunes...he said there were SOOO many people. It really sounded
like a community. Today, on the other hand, sometimes sfr feels like
several communities all bussed into the same place. 

Don't extract too much out of this. I'm more than aware of the reasons
why everything is different now...in some ways for better and in some
ways for worse. I just wanted to share my little blast of nostalgia.

I went to party in Thailland and Bali and Hong Kong and Vietnam last year.
Spent 3 months in search of the perfect party...wouldn't you know I found it
in Florida.

Phuket, Chang Ma are great but Pat Pong..now there is a story. Bali...not
worth the trip unless you are in the area. Oh yes...the Aussies know how to
party. Check out Hamilton Island in the Barrier Reef. We danced all night
then went skydiving while on E and then the next day went diving on the
reef..also a trip when you are still flying from the night before.

I have been back to Australia once and Thailand twice. Definately recommend
it. Wonder how Hong Kong is going to change....can you see all those Maoists
raving???

My view on your view :).  Gathered from observations at parties in this
area, observing people who engage in both activities etc.

I don't agree that A is a drug for slower music than E.  I think it's the
other way around :).  A is more aggressive, and gives (some) people more
energy to dance to hard-ass sets (that are sometimes very hard to find at
SF parties).

Also, I think that A isn't a lonely drug (unless you are way out of you
head, but the same happens if you are way out of your head on E or whatever
else).  Some people are more talkative on A (true, they get witty and
sometimes talk shit - although it's humorous if you like that kind of
humor), less shy, dance more (if the music is good) etc.

>so why, i was wondering, do people here like it slow and introvert.
>why is the rave scene here based on an acid experience rather than an
>e experience.

Hmmm...  Maybe I haven't been to parties in many other places, but seems to
me that there is still a significant amount of E over A.

>it's obvious. california is the birthplace of the acid

>phenomenon comes from?

I think candy ravers are influenced by E more than A :).  Can't imagine
many people on A who would want to walk around covered in glitter, have
tons of things hanging of them, those big lashes etc - many people can't be
bothered while on A - maybe I'm wrong.

>there is a strong acid/hippie tradition
>here which is detectable in the preference for slow spacey music and

>oh, and aliens! england doesn't have this acid history, at least not

>english ravers are stomping the ground.

Hugs are IMO more of an E thing than an A thing (the touchy stuff is more
appealing from sweaty people you don't know on E rather than A).

Anyway, it's interesting to compare observations and views...

What I think about this True Love party:

We just know this party will be awsome because the basis of it is about love.  These two beautiful peeps, will be wed in holy matramony at the party, how beautiful it is that Amanda and Dustin want to share this speacial evnt with all of us. Could we ask for a better vibe? A better way to have a reception? This party will go down in the history book of raving, well it will for me at least.  

Keep Loving,
Julie

I am THINKING of selling my stuff...Two 1200's with stanton 680's, a RANE MP22 mixer, and a grip of jungle twelves...Tons from '93 to present...

I'm still considering this of course, but I was wondering if anyone was interested, and if so, how much would you be willing to pay.

PS  Everything including the records is in great shape...Mixer doesn't bleed and the tables are good as new...Needles probably have another six months to go on them....

no, i think the age groups represented at raves here and in england
are the same, they just look younger here because of the fluff and
candy and glitter and toys. to be honest i don't quite understand why
especially women want to make themselves look like little girlies. i
know it's cute and fun and everything and fun to look at and a release
for the tenseness (am i making words up?) of everyday life, i'd just
personally rather go for tank girl then barbie. (lots of love to my
favorite candy ravers: rubilicious and julie fairy princess :)

i don't think e is the acid of the 90s. acid is the acid of the 90s :)

do you really think that the laid back san franciscans will ever dance
to 180 to 240 bps? (hi gabber girl!)

yeah, but we don't all need to dance to the same music. i'm quite
happy to dance to happy hardcore and techno at home and to trance here
in sf (it's just the comeback of disco that does my head in, but
that's a matter of taste). how boring would the rave scene be if it
was the same all over. i kind of enjoy the culture here.
politics? hmmm...the only politics i see in the rave scene is the
lets-do-it-anyway or how-dare-they-outlaw-fun attitude. it's a
hedonistic not a political movement.

i love you all. this vacation has been a lot of fun so far. thanks for
being so nice to us. would anybody like to come to a new years eve
rave in england?

Hoooooooohhhhh!  Gabbergirl in da hooouusee!

Awww yah, I just have to chime in here that this chick is th' shit!

Gabberbirl, you described your style to a T (of course!) but you neglected
to mention what an awesome sense of humor you have, and I'm talking about
on the turntables!

I remember up at the trust gig, you mixed in "somewhere over the rainbow" 
into a gabber set!  Fuckin' nuts!  And then there was that hilarious John
Wayne sample, "a day without blood is like a day without sunshine".  Man,
I was rolling. 


So welcome to Cali and You Go Gabbergirl!  Looking forward to seeing you
again...

	Well, I don't know if I agree that the drugs are the reason.
First of all, there are *plenty* of e parties here. At least half or
more of the people at these things tend to dissolve into people piles
(see - ambient rooms) or get into hand orgies, or maybe just run around
hugging everybody. The point is - just because everybody's on e doesn't
mean that everybody's dancing.

	Also, I've been to a *lot* of acid parties where many/most
people were dancing, dissolving ego bundaries in a communal experience.

	I think maybe Americans are just more individualistic.

	Also - raves are more mainstream in the UK than they are here.
People who go to raves in the US are looking for something different,
which may just mean that they're disinclined by mature to do whatever
everybody else is doing.

Might receive twice.  Did the whole .com .org thing as well. : P

What I think about this True Love party:

We just know this party will be awsome because the basis of it is about love.  These two beautiful peeps, will be wed in holy matramony at the party, how beautiful it is that Amanda and Dustin want to share this speacial evnt with all of us. Could we ask for a better vibe? A better way to have a reception? This party will go down in the history book of raving, well it will for me at least.  

Keep Loving,
Julie

the whole point of paying attention to pot plants.   watering, pulling
males, training,  adding co2, grooming,  and very importantly curing and
proper storage,  is to produce as much THC in the plant as possible.  all
plants are different and the genetic makeup of the plant is important, 
but i have smoked from two plants that are genetically identical (cloned)
and found that one was much better because of the grower's attention to
the plant.    but back to the brown question. leave it alone.  sometimes
brown comes across the border in gas tanks or on the tires of cars.   you
just have no idea what it has been through.

ohmigod, the whoopy ball.
my very first rave. i remember sitting and playing with flourescent paint
and freaking out about all the folks in floppy hats. and someone gave me a
candy necklace and i was hooked.

my, times have changed. if there was an all-weekend rave now it'd probably
be at Great America, would cost 80 bucks, and about 200,000 people would
show up. and it'd be busted by morning #1. or maybe i'm just being jaded?

btw, i was trying to find the old sfraves archives last week, but they were
all in gzip format and i could get 'em to open. are there hidden ones that
aren't in that format?

Ive been perusing the SFRaves calendar weeklies and coming events and all
of that happiness but am left with a question that the trip-happy elements
of this list must be scratching their heads over...

Where does a person go for a full-out dub-trip experience?  Are there
clubs in the area that do a good job with this (I noticed *some* listed
but really hate browsing clubs since most often they suck :-/)
Recommends, please?

WOW, Do I ever remember that party!  It was DECEDENT, to say the least. 
The location was at Paradine Studios, on San leandro st.  Some guy
manded Mark used to run the place.  It was also a haven for the local
chapter of the Hells Angels, and other weird things that went on in
there.  That place was wild, part junkyard, part live work space and
many diferent rooms always for rent, and there was always something
hapening there.  I remember that i went to a few small weeklies that
they had there on tuesday nights in the back area, next to this trailer
that the dj would spin out off.  There were several parties that hapened
there...but none of wichy i can remeber, even though i went to all of
them :)
  I loved the whoopy ball... I had such a good time.  the barbaques, the
tents, the matress pitt, the music... it was all so new at the time
(Only my second year raving) that i don't think i will ever forget the
feeling and memory.  48 hours of..... EVERYTHING you can imagine!  And
even though it was so disorganized, everything just seemed to have
fallen into place.  Thats what made it so much fun.  Thanks for the
memories alex :)

keep it real

Yeah- *nods*

Also, it's wrong to say that a competitive society is not a natural
society: you find more examples of competition in nature (i.e. outdoors,
plants and animals, etc.) than you do among people--plants compete for
sunlight, animals compete for territory, food, and grazing territory, in
the exacty same ways that human beings compete.  I know what you're trying
to say, megan, and I'm not flaming you or anything, but to me, capitalism
is the most 'natural' of all forms of social structure.  I'm certainly not
saying it's perfect--but it is the most natural: it demands both
competition and cooperation in equal amounts.  

peace and love and healthy competition,
Timothy

     I think it's all about what you want to make yourself feel.  The 
     drugs are just there to lower you inhibitions.  My mindset has been 
     really bad lately, and I haven't been having a good time because I 
     feel really burned out.  Taking something doesn't help my mindset.  
     It may be time for a break.

My view on your view :).  Gathered from observations at parties in this
area, observing people who engage in both activities etc.

I don't agree that A is a drug for slower music than E.  I think it's the
other way around :).  A is more aggressive, and gives (some) people more
energy to dance to hard-ass sets (that are sometimes very hard to find at
SF parties).

Also, I think that A isn't a lonely drug (unless you are way out of you
head, but the same happens if you are way out of your head on E or whatever
else).  Some people are more talkative on A (true, they get witty and
sometimes talk shit - although it's humorous if you like that kind of
humor), less shy, dance more (if the music is good) etc.

>so why, i was wondering, do people here like it slow and introvert.
>why is the rave scene here based on an acid experience rather than an
>e experience.

Hmmm...  Maybe I haven't been to parties in many other places, but seems to
me that there is still a significant amount of E over A.

>it's obvious. california is the birthplace of the acid

>phenomenon comes from?

I think candy ravers are influenced by E more than A :).  Can't imagine
many people on A who would want to walk around covered in glitter, have
tons of things hanging of them, those big lashes etc - many people can't be
bothered while on A - maybe I'm wrong.

>there is a strong acid/hippie tradition
>here which is detectable in the preference for slow spacey music and

>oh, and aliens! england doesn't have this acid history, at least not

>english ravers are stomping the ground.

Hugs are IMO more of an E thing than an A thing (the touchy stuff is more
appealing from sweaty people you don't know on E rather than A).

Anyway, it's interesting to compare observations and views...

YES! finally!
we've been here 6 weeks now and still haven't set a foot outside the
bay area. what are we going to tell the folks back home?

them: "how was the trip to the states? what did you do?" 

us: "we were in san francisco for 10 weeks."

them: "what? you didn't go see yosemite, the famous redwood forests,
seqouia trees, or drive to the grand canyon or to las vegas or
...(insert other touristy stuff)... what were you doing all the time?"

us: "oh, you know, hanging out with people, going to parties, spending
5 hours a day reading sfraves..." i don't think they'd understand.

now, the problem is, we haven't got a car, but if someone would be
willing to give us a ride, we'd share gas and driving. we've got a
tent and sleeping bags. oh and can we do it before august 5th,
pleeeease?

...and we would finally meet foolish fish, after we missed him 3 times
now!

oh exitement!

i would have to agree to some extents, but i've noticed taht 
"candyravers" are MORE into the E experience, the huggy lovey feelings 
and warm fuzzy and cuddlyfuddly licksmoochgropegigglebestfriendsforever 
kind of stuff.. 
i have yet to meet a candyraver who is way into acid :)~ (ok i know one, 
but he's an e-baby as well).
anyone remember that goa party 2o12 (250 blopop eric i remember that was 
your first party) and it ended with a circle of people dancing their 
booties off and a huge group hug??
REMEMBER?
i really miss that.
god do i sound really ignorant in this msg?
time to sleep or something...
but yeah i miss it.
i remember seth tried to get a huge grtoup hug going at warmth II, it 
just never went off.. maybe at true love??

Hey there my fellow South Bay ravers!!!!!

      Rubilicious here with the scoop about thursday night @ the

434 S.first st. in Downtown San Jose. There is NO cover and it's all 
ages!!! Oh, and Don't forget to wear your laminates and your smiles:) 
:) :) :) :)

If you are not from the south bay and you still want to come, it's 
all good!!!!!! ( So, if you need more in depth directions call cafe
Kismet and I'm sure they'll be more than happy to hook you up with
some directions:(408) 292-4226.)

I think it's like open mike night or something, but everytime I go

that will be the case this thursday. Regardless, it will still be 
a great place with good vibes and bombin' art to meet ya all at :)
If you see me, come introduce yourself, I'll be the one with the

It's important to consider the difference in the qualities between whats
here and whats in the UK. From what I understand, E is much much more
pure in the UK than here. I don't think many people in the SF scene have
a lot of experience with pure 100% like-mom-used-to-make E. Hence,
peoples reaction to it is different. It would be better to consider the
E here and E in the UK to be different drugs. I mean, everyone I've talk
to says it's MUCH better over there. That makes a difference.

	That is a real generalization... Maybe Sfians (though I would
disagree with that even)... I have met people I think are very
individualistic on both sides of the ocean. I have also met tons of people
that conform to the set way of being on both sides of the ocean. I have
seen it in raves here and the UK. I don't know if this is meant as an
observation or a judgement or both, but in reference to parties
themselves, I have seen as much if not more new inventitive themes/stuff 
done at the parties in the UK than here in SF... But then, maybe I am just
missing stuff here and saw the most diverse range that existed when I
was there...

	Yes and no... There are raves that are way out of the mainstream,
kind of like you give up all your shit to follow them and be a part of
them... Then also, there are a lot of students over there going out to
raves... Raves are accepted as being part of the culture there, here they
stand for shitty, boring music and a bunch of wierd drugged out people
either being aggressive, trying to be 2 years old so to shirk
responsiblity for themselves, stuck in the dayglo era, or too drugged out
to notice that they are associating with such types (hmmm, I am sure I am
leaving out one or two categories of "those who attend raves").

	Here are a few other thoughts... It rains a lot in the UK. One
spends a lot of time indoors and you get a bit of energy pent of this
way...

	The British have their heads screwed on pretty fucking straight
eariler in life. Maybe cause when you're 18 you better fucking start
scrounging for yourself (ie, they are not as protected as we americans so
they "mature" quickier)...

	The British I have met and dealt with (including a bunch of
average adults with kids near hexham....) are less centered on what you
say you do and seem to be able to see what type of person you are... Ok, I
assume some wankers out there would look at me with my hair and term me a
worthless traveler, no good squatter... They seem less reactionary and
more grounded in experience (?)... Maybe that has something to do with
their tv programming, isn't really not quite so programming...

	People are people in the european derived world. There will always
be those that into putting up a good show, and those that ould care less
about the show...

	Things (material goods) in general cost more to purchase, cost
more to run (though taxes and power bills and petrol prices and the such)
so people seem to tend to pool their resources a hell of a lot better than
they do in the states (at least those that I have met)... Going out often
meant crashing at someone's flat, or heading to the train station/tube
station and trying to keep one another up til the train came and we
waddled on board...

	It's very green there...

	We are different cultures. Right now in the Bay Area, people tend
to like to do other things then dance at parties (much to the dismay of
those trying to build the energy off of each other til it shoots out of
them, travels round the world and descends back into the pulsing crowd)...
I know there are exceptions to this, though some of those exceptions seem
to be into a single way of getting there... Take what you will, do what
you will I suppose...

Hey y'all.
	Damn, that Freedom thing sounded hella cool.  How come it's always so
jarring switching from one scene to another?  Well guys I don't know any of ya
but I take it from reading the hundreds of messages pouring into my box (sheesh
guys, i mean i forgot to check my email one day and the next day i was greeted
by 170 of your messages!).  Anyhow, from my reading I take it that this FREE
LOVE thing's gonna be pretty cool.  Right?
	What I'm especially waiting for is news of KOXBOX (Blue Room
Released)...
	I've been reading about this whole drug controversy discussion yer
having and it seems this way to me:  however much i love 'em, i've actually
gone sober to some raves.  somehow i've been designated as driver... such are
the downs of car-ownership.  but ya know, all of those raves i really look back
on as great.., sure i got tired faster, but the music just courses through
one's system and keeps it alive.  not proof, but perhaps a suggestion that a
young'un such as this 19 yr old finds a lot in what you nostalgic ravers seem
to be calling 'the good old days'.
not that nostalgia isn't a wonderful thing.
	so unless anyone has any suggestions as to what else a portlander who
loves hardcore, goa, and trance should be doing with the time - short of
working, sigh - then i'll hopefully meet some of you at this True Love event.
	until then merry messagemaking,
Elise

Most definately!  My first massive party and hit* I was just blown away 
by the whole thing:) I was just coming out of the industrial scene and 
basically didn't care for techno music.  But because my dear friend had 
found a new scene, she persuaded me a night of fun and excitement:) I'm 
very glad I was open to try it.  I still have my best friend and the 
deep love and respect for our raving community.  
5+ years of raving and still going strong!  Since some of us are on a 
nostalgia kick, does anyone remember the Toontown - Jan, 92?

in Minnesota????

Help, I'm stuck in Minnesota. Does anyone know what to do around here (Twin
Cities area, St. Paul/Minneapolis)? The culture shock of leaving Freedom on
Sunday, jumping on a plane, and landing in Minneapolis for four days is
killing me. I found one party here so far (called Oppression!) but I
couldn't even get myself to go in.

Anyways, I'll see yall this weekend.

-demon

Stay tuned for Jeno, Tony, Simon, DRC, Spun, Mark Jellybear, Jazz-E, Josh
Scwab, and many more on August 30.

HELP!  HELP! HELP!  HELP!  HELP!  
INFO!  INFO!

DEAR ALL,
Two thing's:
1).  On July 16th 1997 Spiral Tribe, the original UK underground dance
massive, are doing a one night only party in SF.  $10; 21+.  If you have
any interest in what parties where like back in London in 1990/1/2/3 you
should check it out.
2).  ALSO:  S.P.A.Z. and Spiral Tribe are also doing a massive free
festival this weekend - 11th and 12th of July 1997 - up in the hills
outside Eugiene, Oregon.  This party will be featuring Spiral Tribe's 45k
sound system as well as Jungle and Chill-out tents.  As I was up in Oregon
last weekend for the Rainbow gathering (which was okay - not great, just
okay) I saw the site and it is beautiful and there are an awful of
people who are going to go; especially from the Rainbow gathering and from
Seatlle/Portland area.  In short, it's going to be massive.  I urge
everyone on this list to go because it does not get any more intence or
old school as this.  they will also be doing another festival in the bay
area on the weekend following the July 16th party.
If anyone is interested in going to the Oregon festival (it will be about
an eight hour drive) please call me, Tristan, at 415-252-0454 because I
need a ride and I know how to get their (I have gas $ etc).  It really
should be a great free weekend of great music and beautiful evironments.

For more info on all of these events call 1-888-984-2075.

Peace out,
Tristan.

hi everyone!!

While in Portland a few weeks ago I picked up a snazzy-looking free mag 
called SWEATER.  It just started being published and I haven't seen it in 
the bay area yet, but I also haven't been looking so it might be here.  
It's a pretty neat rave/club mag.  In the first issue were interviews 
with the Hardkiss bros., Doc Martin, Daft Punk, and a few other DJs.  The 
magazine also had an interesting fashion layout and interviews with a 
couple fashion designers (not neccessarily ones who design 
"typical" rave wear, a plus in my book) including the guy who design the 
W&LT label, some cool stuff.  And of course there were reviews of every 
new record most of which I thought were fairly well written.  The 
articles in all were pretty good, if a little short, except for the daft 
punk one which went on for pages and I just lost all interest after the 
first few paragraphs, those daft punk boys are a bit odd, maybe it's 
language barrier?  At any rate, I would call it a (skinnier) fashion 
concious XLR8R and would recomend it.  two pinkies up....

My name is Joel. Kevin asked me to mention that I was using his account. 
I want to describe a feeling of unity I remember from playing music with
different groups of people. At a point, when the whole band is
improvising, certain psychological barriers between the members are
naturaly and intuitively abandoned. These barriers relate to self.  the
individual no longer exists to represent the individual but to express the
time and harmony so the melody can exist. This time , harmony and melody
exist without the musician or the band. So, as the individual becomes more
in tune and in time, they can relate to musicians who have come and gone
and who are here and who will come. It seems so peacefull to me to give
time and harmony so a melody can exist.If one only plays a single note
but they play in time with the other musicians, and the other musicians
have good time and can make the changes(the harmony) work around that
note, then, for a moment that person can feel the unity of which
I speak.  The psychological barriers I mentioned pretain to the
individuals ability to appreciate what little they can do to support
the melody. If the individual is playing the melody then their ability to
appreciate the chord progression and the feeling of the time, that the
rest of the group is creating will cause an interaction of their minds.
The music may be there without the musician but the acoustic instrument
will not play itself.

 This interaction of minds at an improvisationallevel can
only be described by itself. You have to be there to hear it. It won't 
be on the recording.  There are basic principles that exist when any music
is being created. Any one, even a deaf mute person can learn these
principles and have a voice. Each aspect of music that has time, melody, 
harmony and formm can be described as a voice. So, as one developes their
voice for music, people who are furthur along will recognize you  
and if you are improvising they may attempt to mentor your efforts.
This is when the psychological barriers come back and unity can be lost.
There is only so much a person can give and only so much a person can
take. When the music is playing unity is expressed in the harmony and
melody and the time they exist in.   when the music stops the musician
can attempt to continue hearing the chords, melody and time.  Eventually,
if one is persistent, thoughtfulness will afford the knowledge of the
harmony just before it happens. No one can take that away. We are all
capable. Listening, practicing and playing are all it takes. There is no
hurry. I apologize for going on and on.  This is my goal. to be able to
hear and play music regardless of the instrument. I'm not a purist, I like 
all music especially dance music, if its funky, all the better.

				peace

For all those who weren't watching the Real Word casting call special... You
missed one of our wonderful family attempting to get on the Real World via
his video tape that he sent them...

There is Spencer... (One of the Warmth big boys) Sitting in the midst of a
redwood forest... Blonde curls blowing gently in the wind...

He smiles and states proudly," Excuse me, I have to go hug a tree..." runs
back to one tree... thinks a moment and hugs the giant redwood.

Once again proving that Spencer is the bomb... even on international
television!!! :)

Love 'n' Lucky Charms,
~^v^~ Stefi ~^v^~

Anyone else planning on going to LoveParade . . . I think it's on December 7th 
(the day before my birthday!)  My friend Monica and I are playing around w/ 
the idea of going . . . she was an exchange student in Germany for a year, so 
she's all fluent and stuff.  Plusthe poor baby was staying w/ a rave-opposed 
host family so she couldn't go to LoveParade in 1995 . . . so we want to go 
this year, and go to one of the phattest raves in the world (so we've heard).

It's either that or I'm going to Hawaii w/ another friend.  Or I'm saving my 
money for furniture and a deposit for my own apartment.

But yeah, is anyone going to LoveParade?  It'd be nice if other people were 
going besides just us two little girls.  Probably safer too.  But as you can 
see, I'm not too sure whether I can or I will.  Still, let me know if you're 
going, if you've been to one before, or whatever.

xoxo--Miccaela

>From the impression that I have of portland, this might be a dumb
question...but I hope not. I'm going up north this weekend, and was
wondering if anyone can recommend any parties &&/|| clubs there.

My current impression (that there isn't much going on) is drawn from my
experience that the whole town closes down at about 1:00am (except for
Garbanzo's, that is :).

So, any suggestions?

Thanks,

Does anyone on this list know if there is a URL for downloading the archive to a _particular date_, instead of the whole month?

Much appreciated,
Mr. 2

Um... or it almost compensates for what a jerk I was being to everybody
last night at Slow Roasted/Viberation meeting.  I think that thinking I
wasn't going to spin made me a er... tad grumpy.

Sorry to anyone who got an earful, especially any individuals I may have
singled out (you'll know who you are if you get a post from me today).

Doh! I guess life is something that takes a lot of work to get right.  I
really hope I have the maturity of a 20 year old by the time I turn 30...

Unfortunately, the marvelous Love Parade is THIS WEEKEND!!  So you'd better 
hurry and get airline tix!  I had tried to organize a trip over there, but had 
2 ppl flake out, and I couldn't find cheap (< $800) airfare.  BUT, if anyone's 
got some extra $$ just burning a hole in their pants and is up for a 
spontaneous adventure and would like to take along kind ole Nathan, I can set 
us up with accomodations, act as translator, and show you all the hot spots in 
Berlin!  C'mon, I'll even teach you how to polka  (BSP) 

Peace, Nathan

i saw spirl tribe when i was in boston, and i would agree: their live pa is very very intense, very driving. very fast. unfortunately, when i saw them it was in a club and it didn't feel the same... :(  but a good show, if you are above the arbitrary age limit -- i mean, if you are 21+, check it out.

  Well, actually I am into all hardcore, not just happy hardcore (i.e.
  gabber, killcore, etc..) I consider myself to be part of the positive
  hardcore scene, which basically means hardcore without all the
  immature violence and moshing.

Yeah that was a killer party... and I heard about it through SFRaves...
I only went to one night of it, but I had a great time. I was one of
the initial subscribers -- just reading ba.music newsgroup to find out
what was going in the SF scene. Having had a truly wonderful time
raving in Ibiza and London in the summer of '88... I was thinking to
myself, gee, it's too bad they don't have parties like this here in the
Bay Area... and then I saw BrianB's post to ba.music and SFRaves came
along and I started finding out where the parties were, and so on and
so forth...

PS: speaking of killer parties, Stompy on 7/4/97 kicked ass! Old school
and new out in force, tearing it up. Nothing better than a party where
they're playing top-notch House music. Mark Green's set was like being
in a gospel church where everybody's whoopin it up arms in the air and
vibe-filled and dancing like there's no tomorrow -- it was like there
was a shiny new god up in the sky and people were feeling the spirit
move them. That's house music for you.

Hello fellow SFRavers,

I'm working on a project involving programming in Java, and I was
wondering if any people knowledgeable in Java on the list would be
interested in making some money helping me out in their spare time.  In
addition, I have a need for people with a strong cryptography background 
and at least a bit of Java experience.  If this sounds interesting, please
mail me back and I'll let you know the details.

Thanks,
Jake

you meant Mark Grant, but yeah, stompy was (as always) an *excellent* party.
Nicely put Niels :)

Mark Grant put out a 12" on guidance a couple weeks back,
definitely worth seeking out.  www.33rpm.com for more info...

Oops. Yeah, I meant Mark Grant. Slip of the brain there. Or the
fingers.  Or perhaps my single-remaining-neuron needs to be replaced. 
And many thanks to Sun Kim for letting me know who the DJ was!

Stompy! This was an awesome party, and Mark Grant really ripped it up.
Anyone know where he's based out of? Is he out of chicago?

I have to say that stompy is one of my fav parties and always has been.
This is one party that could put the whole club vs. rave debate to rest. If
you haven't been, you should, and if you haven't been in a while, get your
ass down there and shake it!

Speaking of guidance, I've read a review of a CD they just put out called
"Hi Fidelity House, Imprint One." A friend also told me really good things
about this. I can't find it ANYwhere. Anyone got any leads?? If it's
anything like the stuff that Grant was spinning, I've gotta have it.

Here Here for Stompy!

Stompy seems to be the one last bastion for no-nonsense, chunky funky house 
on a phat system!  I'd highly reccommend all house-heads check one out.

As for Mark Grant, he is out of Chicago, and has done lots of remixes as 
well as original tracks.  Check him on out Casual on the recent Andre 
Harris EP and the Chicago Connection EP.  And that one on Guidance is _the 
kind_.

On the Stompy note, does anyone know what's up with Johnny (aka Jonene)? 
 That guy's got the sweet deep sound I love so much, but aside from the 
occasional Stompy, I don't see him out anywhere.  Anyone know where he's 
been playing lately?  He's supposed to have a mixtape (recorded at a Stompy 
a few months back) out, but it's not in any stores.

Thoughts?

you forgot to mention the mega corporate advertising, lots and lots
of full and double page glossy ads for camel, jim beam, harmon/kardon,
absolut, altoids, kahlua, beefeater, bacardi, etc... it's more like
a yuppie lifestyle/fashion mag with some "electronica(tm)" articles
and reviews. i haven't read it so i can't comment on the quality
of the writing, but i was kinda suprised to see reviews of some more
relatively obscure stuff along with the usual chem. bros, orb, daft
punk, etc...

it's free (it better be with all of that $$ coming in from those ads,
i can't imagine actually paying for it), but xlr8r it is NOT.  no
comparison really...

Shall we try this one more time?

Anyone up for a trip to yosemite this month?
There is a full moon next weekend so that would be 
spectacular...it just happens to be in capricorn
which is connected to  mountain climbing for
all you astrology people.

this would be a great opportunity to meet and socialize
with everyone in one of the most beautiful places
around here. Make some new friends and get to know
each other which is sometimes hard to do at raves.

Let me know if you are interested and if you have a
ride to share or need a ride.

	Hiyaz, does this mailing list have an IRC channel on EFnet or Undernet (or
even Dalnet)?  That question just screaming to be let outside of my head.

OK vintage synthe freaks I've finally established my priorities....
need the cash for other investments (not to mention the space in
my studio).... so I'm parting with some old friends that some of
you might recognize and want to give a good home to....

ALL my stuff is well cared for one owner stuff ( I even have receipts)

Sequential Pro-1  perfect condition, all knobs etc. manuals incl service
                  have a home-built wooden case for
it....                     $400

Roland SH-09/ with digital sequencer   The SH-09 is a forerunner to the
                 SH-101 - great bass line synthe with the 256 step
sequencer
                 a lot like the pro -1 with it.... manuals etc..
both          $450

Roland D-50    - classic digital synthe - with anvil
case                      $500

Yamaha DX-9    - very early digital sythe like the DX-7 but less
complex       $250

Korg  MS-20    - monphonic synthe with on panel patch bay can process
an       $350
                 external signal...                                     

I have a couple of rack units that I'm up in the air over  Korg M1 and
 a Yamaha TX81z  if any interest you might convince me to part with
them...


  If anyone is interested drop me an E-mail or a call at phone in
sig....

  Thanks,

  Mike

PS  Not to worry I still have lots of synthes left... I'm just tired of
having a synthe museum...

with it. looked through his records (bone thugs n harmony
and some other rap stuff) looked through my parents records
(engelbert humberdink??? barbara streisand, sarturday night 
fever <yay!> n some other old people stuff)

oh did i have fun fun fun!!!

oldies stuff etc etc etc.

Are you talking about the one at the Fashion Center.  It was on the same
night as the Nirvana Concert at the greek theatre in berkeley...  That
was a great night!   It was the first ever rave at the Fasion Center.. 
It was incredible!  Remeber the bouncy castle on the lower level, and
the catacomes of halways to get lost in... MIND BLOWING!!!

aspect of the mainstream incorporation of underground Culture.

Hey guys..

I'd be rich if I had a dollar everytime I told you guys how much I love
LTJ BUKEM... so I have to share with you how happy/excited I am about
Monday night at VSF. 

You see he's going to be here!! I can't believe it. I am so excited. He's
my favorite Dj/Producer/Muscian....  I love his style and want to spin the
same style of music and have been guying hell of records of his labels...

I'm going with a few friends and would love to hookup with some SFravers
for a group date... let me know by way of private mail..

and remember.. 

Life moves pretty fast, if you don't stop and look around once in a way
you could miss it..

just.jer is throwing.  i'll be juicing it up.  "ah, yes, i'd like one

We already have a trip planned for the weekend of July 25 etc 
If you are still interested... (I've emailed some of you privately...
But consider this a Roll Call of sorts if you are still interested!) 

A bunch of SoCal Ravers are meeting in the valley on Friday the 25th
Some are climbing for the first time (with experienced climbers) on Sat-Im
Leading that climbing effort...

Some are hiking / lounging aound / trainspotting 

Sat night we are going to get together and have a small party (no rave here
But maybe some music and othEr ActivitiEs might be plAnnEd..

Sunday some are hiking with me to Halfdome's summit-incredible views.. I'm leading
This little hike as well!

So please email me NOW if you're interested!

I think SFRaves and SoCal Raves gathering would be a great chance to present to the
Rest o the community on the Valley Floor the greatness and coolness of PLUR

gEoff ;)

incerdibly original....just goa trance with a jungle beat, still it's

heyhey everyone,

kris and i are lookin for a housemate to share a home in marin... we're 
located in greenbrae, right on the 101 just south of san rafael.

what we need:  someone who is laid back _yet_ financially stable (yeah, 
there's always a catch... =)  , likes music (a lot - as in able to sleep 
to funky housegrooves or ambientgroove, nothin too aggro...), is ok with 
cats (we have three - all are very great), somewhat clean and responsible, 
likes being around people, and wants to live in marin...

what we offer:  kris is a very warm person who is currently working in 
(surprise) the whole web dev scene - she's into spinning ambient, and the
exploration of the role of media in the evolution of culture (yeah, it's 
pretty wordy on the outside but interesting on the inside...)

i dj, primarily house music - anything with a groove and that uplifting 
funk to it...  and jam/compose music (i have a full studio and decks)... 
i've been into house and rave culture for years - up and down the west 
coast, from l.a. to seattle... i'm also doing web dev to pay the rent...

about the house:  nice place, 4 bedrooms (of which you would have two 
bedrooms - one of which is a master bedroom, including private bathroom), 3 
bath, 2 common rooms, washer and dryer, and a swimming pool...  rent is 
$733 + utils per person, which, is a good deal considerin where you are 
and what you get...

email me (leaf@ted.net) for more info or to meet kris and i...

thanks,
phil

wow. i've never heard grooveriders' music described as goa trance
jungle. i'm beginning to think that we use completely different terms
to describe music in england. or maybe djs change their music for the
american market. or maybe i don't really understand what americans
understand as goa trance.
i'm confused..

Yeah, it's called mishmosh, really popular in Western Samoa.

and on that note! It's my Bday on Monday, the 14th, but I'll be celebrating
it next Sunday at a Park in San Jose! I'm inviting all of you out there, and
though I don't know half of you I still want you there. If you want to come
it will start around noonish, and it's at some park that I'll have to give
you directions for, since I don't even know where it is myself just yet! I'd
like to have music, but I don't know anyone that can bring a rig and mix for
me (hint hint). Anyway, it's BYOS (bring yer own shit) since noone can ever
agree on what to eat or whatever. We'll be BBQing and generally having a good
time, so bring smiles if nothing else.

Well, I would...I really really would...exceptin' that I'm flying up.
Normally I do drive on these last minute things, but since my car is badly
in need of maintenance AND my registration has been expired since march (a
state trooper was kind enough to point this out during a 'routine' traffic
stop when Beth and I were returning from the Cloud Factory get together on
July 4), I've decided not to risk it. Zhal.

I don't even know if I'll have time to head down to Eugene
myself...grumble.

Hope you find a ride...

some masters of drum'n'bass mixing it up for a big crowd, should be

well, I don't know, I excused the ads 'cause it was free and it did have a wide variety 
of stuff in it.  

(I didn't really like the magazine advertising clubs for major cities either but that's 
just my elitism speaking.)

And I don't know that I would call it yuppie becuase I just didn't get that feel from 
the scope of the mag and where I found it (the only place I saw it) (buffalo exchange, 
not a big yuppie hangout). I felt it catered to more in-the-know people because it did 
cover some more obscure stuff that would bore anyone just reading it for daft punk.  I 
thought through the ads it was aiming for a more frat crowd, something I don't care for 
but I thought originally maybe the mag got money wherever it came from.  But since it 
turns out that it is put out by camel I won't ever pay for it but I would for sure read 
it again if only for the glossy pictures.

there is always a place in my heart for more shiny magazines.

        I don't like the moshing, but I sort of like hardcore and gabber. I
can dance to happy hardcore longer and I like it too, as long as the DJs go
easy on the divas(a little is okay, 2 minute diva breaks is pushing it)

Well lemme see i always found out about raves and stuff from friends of mine at
the college; but one place to look for flyers/info is this little record store
on like 2nd and one of the tree-named streets.  umm, yeah, in those few blocks
on ash, right by the river in downtown (westside) where it's still SW (not NW)
but almost hits Burnside (the division street between north and sourth).  Just
some dingy postered looking place that'd be a good place to check the scene. 
can't promise anything though, but i went to a kick-ass rave through them
(Evolution).
another thought:  
a contact/ friend of mine:  jkemper@reed.edu ; he's mostly into the grateful
dead now but he's still up in portland and can probably hook you up with a few
events.

also near there, I think, is a spiffy huge bookstore called Powell books. 
 I recommend it immensily even if you aren't looking for anything in 
particular.  I don't recomend the parking garage there unless you drive a 
tuna can on wheels becuase it is a VERY tight squeeze to park in.

So I plot down with the new copy of Lotus and flip to page 29 and who is 
there on an ad for the "Green Party (Vol. II)"?  DJ Noah (of Colour) 
listed as spinning Funky Breaks.  Now, I saw DJ Noah's name for the first 
time about a year ago on a flyer at Beat Non Stop for some party where my 
homeboy Moonpup was also spinning.  I also saw DJ Noah's name on the 
Frosted Breaks flyer.  However, due to random circumstance, I've never 
actually met the guy or heard him spin rekkids.  Does anyone know him?  I 
think it would be fun to meet another 'Noah' who spins funky breaks!  It 
could lead to an interesting vs. mixtape...
Thanks
plur, etc.

Where the hell did I get December 7th?

There's something going on that weekend, in Europe, I'm sure of it!  I know I 
didn't just make that date up.  If anyone knows what the hell it is, and could 
tell me about it, I'd be eternally grateful.  Or tell me about any HUGE phat 
ass parties going on anywhere sometime during December.  I'm not talking a 
pretty good UG party in SF or a massive, I'm talking about a _global event_.  
Something that can't be missed.

Maybe next summer I can go to LoveParade.  I should _definitely_ be able to 
pay for the airfare (I heard I'd better have around $1500 for a round trip 
ticket) by then.

So . . . if anyone is really really serious about some nonstop partying (and 
of course the usual sightseeing) in Europe next summer, drop me a private 
email.  I'd like to spend a month over there, so I'd probably be staying in 
youth hostels and the like . . . I'm not exactly rolling in dough.  Any 
takers?  You know the best trips are those planned way way way in advance, we 
can start soon!

Dear Friends,

Attached is a file for any bay area individuals interested in action on
preserving a stretch of California Coastal area, an area where many raves
are held on the beaches.  Pass it on to interested individuals.


>>------------   ORIGINAL ATTACHMENT   --------
>>SENT 07-02-97 FROM CURRAN_ANNE @MAILMN
>>
>>Hi,
>>
>>As you may have seen recently on Channel 4 News or San Jose
>>Mercury News, a beautiful open space on the San Mateo Coast
>>called Cascade Ranch is in immediate danger of development. A
>>grassroots effort to save Cascade Ranch is underway. The
>>Coastside Habitat Coalition is leading this fight.
>>
>>Cascade Ranch is halfway between Santa Cruz and Half Moon Bay
>>near Ano Nuevo State Park.  Development of 112 RV sites, 76 tent
>>campsites, 130 room resort, 12 cabins, 40 room lodge, store,
>>conference center, multiple gyms, 2 pools, tennis courts, etc. is
>>planned for the site.
>>
>>Issues with the proposed development:
>>-------------------------------------
>>   - One of the most beautiful stretches of California coastline
>>and open space will be marred.
>>   - This campsite/lodge can support about 1000 people per day.
>>Neighboring communities are small (<500 people).   Traffic along
>>highway 1 will dramatically incease.  Impact on local communities
>>and coastside ecology will be major.
>>   - An endangered species (San Francisco Garter Snake) and a
>>threatened species (Red-legged Frog) currently inhabit Cascade
>>Ranch and will probably not survive this development
>>   - A large well will be drilled at the site of a former Ohlone
>>Indian settlement.  This is the place where the explorer Portola
>>first encountered the Ohlone Indians in the 1700s.   It is a
>>potentially valuable archaeological site.
>>
>>What concerned people can do:
>>-----------------------------
>>   - Forward this message to others who may be interested.
>>   - See http://www.outre.com/cascade for more info.
>>   - Join the grassroots effort and contribute in whatever way
>>you can.
>>          Address:  Coastside Habitat Coalition
>>                    P.O. Box 71
>>                    San Gregorio, CA 94074
>>          Phone:    (415) 726-0565
>>          E-mail:   sangregoro@aol.com
>>   - Let your representatives and the media know what you think
>>about preserving the coastside.
>>   - Participate in a *nature hike* July 5.  Join naturalist Joe
>>Barnwell to explore beautiful Cascade Ranch State Park which is
>>adjacent to the private development site. This hike is sponsored
>>by the Coastside Habitat Coalition. Suggested sliding scale
>>donation of $5 - $20.  Meet at the San Gregorio General Store at
>>the corner of Highway 84 and Stage Rd. on Saturday July 5 at
>>10:00 am. Call 415-726-0565 for more information.
>>   - Attend the next *volunteer action meeting* on Wednesday

Subject: Music For Newbies
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.org
Precedence: bulk

When I first started raving (gee, like, three or four months ago), I was 
having the hardest time finding music.  I didn't want to spend money on CDs 
that I didn't like, but I didn't know what I liked yet, and I wasn't familiar 
w/ a lot of artists and genres.  Well, I'm still not.

But I've gotten some great, no, fantastic CDs  (sorry all you vinyl lovers) 
and compilations, and not only do they contain really good music, but they 
really helped me define my tastes in techno music.

So if there are any other newbies out there who don't know what the hell to 
buy, but are really craving some good music, email me privately and I'll send 
you a list of some of the really good CDs, including price, track listings, 
where they can be found, etc.  They're really easy to find and affordable 
(well, for imports).

Oh, and if there are some CDs that all you oldskoolers know about and would 
recommend, could you let me know about some of them . . . I can never have too 
many cds . . .

xoxo--Miccaela

If I remember cirrectly intoxication was absolutely awesome. Heard some great
music, felt some great vibes, and met some wonderful people. I think I might
acually go to this years too, even though I have about sworn off massives.
Also, while I was leaving Freedom I saw a guy handing out flyers for
Intoxication, and I asked him if it would be at the same place, and he said
that they had a bigger place for it this year. Just my input...

in the Buddhist tradition, there is a meditation called <<metta>>, 
which best translates as <<loving-kindness>>

i~ll describe how to do it, i wanted to share this w/ you because you 
might want to do this at a rave w/ a friend, obviously someone you 
love and care about, or at home, whatever...

sit across from each other and take a few deep breaths, focus on 
breathing...
Wish yourself well, say mentally 
<<may my heart be peaceful and happy. 
may i be safe from harm. 
may i be kind.>>
then, as the metta phrases are flowing through your mind 
exhale and imagine the energy of loving kindness flowing from you and 
surrounding you and infusing someone you love.
Breath in loving kindness and breath it out to those you love.
Let it surround the globe, send this to all beings
Silently say <<may i be well, may all beings be well>>

goodnight!

Hey everyone!

I was listening to my friend's tape this morning and heard a drum&bass
song that samples the guitars from Van Halen's "Ain't Talking About Love"
 at hyperspeed...

My buddy said that he heard that this song is called "Ain't Talking About
Dub"....  Any one have a clue who does this song, and if it's available
on CD????

I NEED IT!!!  (By "it", I mean the song...)  =p

Can anyone out there help out a lost soul?

Mad Hugs!

That's "Ain't Talkin' Bout Dub" by Apollo Four Forty... I have two
different versions of this song on Virgin's "In The Mix 97"
compilation, and the Polygram TV "Dance Zone Level Nine"...  I picked
up these sometimes-cheezy compilations at the London Heathrow Airport
during a layover on my way back from a recent biz-trip to India. I think
I've seen one of these at Reckless Records on Haight St...

I'm up for doing digital-to-digital DAT or CD-R trades of these and 
other CDs I have... for personal use only of course...

I think we should start a DAT (or CD-R) "tape tree" thingie much like 
deadheads and phisheads do... (http://www.atd.ucar.edu/rdp/dat-heads/)

Nope, they're refering to the largely german scene of bands like alec
empire and atari teenage riot who make heavily distorted
techno/metal/jungle.

Anthem was AMAZING! The music slammed, the attitude was nonexistent and
EVERYONE was just moving to the beat or rhythm or whatever is it is they
hear.  The floor was thoroughly  doused with talcum powder and all payed
tribute to our house.  It's still giving me chills.

Sorry to bring this feud back up, but I dance 5-6 nights/week and 9 times
outa ten, 1015 or Cats Ally or wherever on a week night is better then any
huge mega rave and co$t$ far less.    What's with gathering in a circle and
watching some show-off jump around anyway?  

Anthem last night could only be compared to an old fashioned (circa '94)
underground rave.  What happened to those raves?

Hey everybody. Just wanted to let you all know that Underbrush is now 
from 9pm to midnight, Saturday nights on KZSU Stanford 90.1fm. We also 
broadcast via RealAudio 24/7.

For those who don't know, Underbrush is an "electronica" show, with a 
special focus on drum'n'bass. I also have a lot of guest djs spin, so if 
you're a dj interested in playing on-air, send me email.

peace,
-radon

Iris, 

Grooverider is not a goa artist, and I didn't mean to imply that he
was. For those who don't know, Groove is one of he most respected drum
and bass dj's and producers in the UK. However, he does do many
remixes for a variety of artists and this remix in particular is for a
goa artist. It sounds, literally, like goa jungle.  Perhaps sometime I
can play it for you and you'll see what I mean...

We already have a trip planned for the weekend of July 25 etc 
If you are still interested... (I've emailed some of you privately...
But consider this a Roll Call of sorts if you are still interested!) 

A bunch of SoCal Ravers are meeting in the valley on Friday the 25th
Some are climbing for the first time (with experienced climbers) on Sat-Im
Leading that climbing effort...

Some are hiking / lounging aound / trainspotting 

Sat night we are going to get together and have a small party (no rave here
But maybe some music and othEr ActivitiEs might be plAnnEd..

Sunday some are hiking with me to Halfdome's summit-incredible views.. I'm leading
This little hike as well!

So please email me NOW if you're interested!

I think SFRaves and SoCal Raves gathering would be a great chance to present to the
Rest o the community on the Valley Floor the greatness and coolness of PLUR

Shall we try this one more time?

Anyone up for a trip to yosemite this month?
There is a full moon next weekend so that would be 
spectacular...it just happens to be in capricorn
which is connected to  mountain climbing for
all you astrology people.

this would be a great opportunity to meet and socialize
with everyone in one of the most beautiful places
around here. Make some new friends and get to know
each other which is sometimes hard to do at raves.

Let me know if you are interested and if you have a
ride to share or need a ride.

and on that note! It's my Bday on Monday, the 14th, but I'll be celebrating
it next Sunday at a Park in San Jose! I'm inviting all of you out there, and
though I don't know half of you I still want you there. If you want to come
it will start around noonish, and it's at some park that I'll have to give
you directions for, since I don't even know where it is myself just yet! I'd
like to have music, but I don't know anyone that can bring a rig and mix for
me (hint hint). Anyway, it's BYOS (bring yer own shit) since noone can ever
agree on what to eat or whatever. We'll be BBQing and generally having a good
time, so bring smiles if nothing else.

enough with the bad-rep of ghb. GHB is a drug. I use it/I like it....it's
great. the biggest danger is mis-information and/or irresponsible use.
Continuous daily use can and will result in disrupting the *normal* level of
brain chemistry as the users body fights to adjust to  the fluctuating
levels, if you are using daily you have a problem that may take a couple of
months to self-correct, but it will.
  GHB is not a problem, it's mis-use is. The more we talk about it, the more
curious people become who haven't tried it and that is dangerous. One cap of
GHB can be several times stronger than another cap from a different supply,
so be careful if you usually take four or two or whatever, y'know?? GHB has a
stronger reaction in females than males, so dosage is halved or you may pass
out. Don't mix it with alcohol EVER, you will barf and then pass out,
guaranteed.
  Just say NO is a policy that will not work, we all know that. Being
responsible is a policy that will work. G will bring your e-peak back, G will
soften a bad trip, G will ruin everyones night if you don't have a clue and
just don't care.
  Sorry to beat this thread to death yet again, but was involved in a
conversation where GHB was reffered to as a "bad, bad drug" and after talking
a couple of minutes realized the ppl didn't know, y'know ? just spreading
mis-information

I went to party in Thailland and Bali and Hong Kong and Vietnam last year.
Spent 3 months in search of the perfect party...wouldn't you know I found it
in Florida.

Phuket, Chang Ma are great but Pat Pong..now there is a story. Bali...not
worth the trip unless you are in the area. Oh yes...the Aussies know how to
party. Check out Hamilton Island in the Barrier Reef. We danced all night
then went skydiving while on E and then the next day went diving on the
reef..also a trip when you are still flying from the night before.

I have been back to Australia once and Thailand twice. Definately recommend
it. Wonder how Hong Kong is going to change....can you see all those Maoists
raving???

exactly.  i am officially no longer a "raver".  raves have nothing to
offer anymore besides circle dancing, people standing around on the dance
floor and/or undanceable "trance" techno.  sorry, i'll take 1015
or stompy over a rave any time.

don't worry, i'll still go to the december gatherings and f&f's if they
ever happen again.

Hi!  ]=}

 I was working at this party before and after and have not heard word of 
any camera. I'll talk to others on the crew and see if anyone had heard 
anything about a camera. I kinda doubt it is findable though. Sorry!  :(

	Hiyaz.  I had asked some people from the list about whether or not an IRC
channel existed.  Well turns out that it does.  I was told it was in it's
earlier stages of development, but all we need are enthusiastic SF rayvuhs
to come and make some noise.  
	If you don't know a damn thing about IRC like me, then I could point you
out to some primers and FAQ's, plus a few tutorials.  Most people are
interested in IRC, they just don't know where to start.  Email me back and
I'd be more than willing to help yaz.  Or if you're one of those types that
like to learn on their own, here's a decent site to start from:

	http://shoga.wwa.com/~edge//newbie.htm

	Anywayz, take care of yourselves and oh yah one last thing, JOCKS SUCK.  : )

	Nico

I think the reason parties are not as good in the south east is because
the local authorities are much harsher than here. In fact I think it's
in Thailand (or is it cambodia?) where they have a super-low crime rate
because the punishments for even petty crimes are inhumanely severe.
Being cought selling E carries a pretty severe punishment here, what do
you think they would do in a 3rd world country? Hauling them off to jail
is too expensive, theyd sooner have 'em sleep with the fishes.

I haven't been to Hong Kong yet, but after what happend in Tenimen(sp?)
square a few years ago, what do you think they would do to a buncha
ravers? (*SMACK* *SMACK*)

But of course, you can't enjoy the benefits of a drug without actually
using it, so GHB has to be evaluated on how easy it is to "mis-use",
particularly by well-intentioned people.  And GHB just doesn't stack up -
it has many bad interactions with other drugs, can be of unpredictable
strength, and produces many bad side effects at slightly higher dosages.
It's just not a drug that is amenable to "street use" - in very controlled
situations where people can experiment with slightly increasing dosages to
find their tolerance, it might be safe, but how many people out there do
you think do that?

Going beyond philosophy, though, look at what's actually happened - GHB has
sent more people to the hospital from raves this year, it seems, than all
other drugs combined.  

I really don't think people are missing out if they don't do GHB; there are
so many other /marvelous/ drugs out there which don't have this level of
risk, that it seems just kind of silly to do it.  Yes, even drugs which
give a similar reaction.

And thus, I will continue to urge people to not do ghb, unless they really
can handle learning "how".

Nope, it's intentional, so that the search engines out there don't have an
easy time indexing them, and so spammers can't mine it for email addresses.
 Most of the common compression software should be able to uncompress them
- pkzip, stuffit, etc.

The Woopy Ball was my first SF party - my favorite was the fact that
admission was free *if you brought a couch for the ambient warehouse*.
Which many many people did!

All we need to do to get some sort of revolution out of this is to unite
under one same sort of philosophy; PLUR. If we all lived, breathed, shit, and
ate PLUR we could really make that difference that we all want to make! But,
I also believe that timing is everything! In the 60's there was quite a
movement and it was squashed by the government before it ever really made a
difference, we need to remember that the government is still in control, and
that all the people in control of that government, for the time being, are
the same people, with the same ideals that squashed that first movement. We
need to proceed with caution and work subtly. Just a thought...

Ok, here's the story...

I'm driving home on 680 from SanJo and I'm half asleep... it hasn't been
more than 24 hours since I put my "Yes, I am a raver..." sticker on my
rear windshield.
I don't realize it, but traffic is passing me as I am behind an 18
wheeler going 40 in the slow lane (I can never tell how slow I go when
I'm half-asleep...), so i put on my 119k.r.u CD to try and wake myself
up.
As traffic slows to a 5MPH halt around Fremont, this blue mini-truck
pulls up next to me, and the driver goes, "Hey!"
Being 3/4 asleep by now, I hear the yell, but I am too tired to even turn
my head...
And then I hear, "Hey Doughboy!"

All of a sudden, I am awakened...

These two guys in this mini are yelling at me that they remember me from
Freedom and some other partys...

On the 680 freeway of all places!

Could this be any of you guys on the SFR list????

Just wondering... sorry if I wasted your bandwidth.

Mad hugs!
jay
(doughboy!)

P.S. Finally met MEGS (Megan) the other day; she is SO kewl... and I'm
not just saying that 'cause she hooked my sh*t up!!!  Phat waffle cone
full of ice cream and everything....  YUM!  Anyways, if ya ever get to
meet her, make sure ya say doughboy sent ya!

1. tiennamin square is in china. who knows what'll be happening in hong
kong now, but i doubt that they'll be as strict in crushing democratic
ideals. 2. tiennamin square was a protest for democratic rights - a little
different than hedonistic ones. who would have time to worry about how much
fun you could have when your friends were being thrown in jail (and shot
at) for speaking their minds? totally nrr, but it's easy to forget how
fortunate we are here. my little brother was in beijing when all that shit
went down... it's just really sad to think that these ppl were our age,
fighting for, and losing, the most basic human rights.

peace, e. :)

oh, i know you were being lighthearted and joking about the whole thing -
didn't mean to get so serious!

i don't think a revolution is necessary. what would you want to
achieve? 

i think ben and i and the whole circumstances of our stay here are
proof of the global unity of the rave movement. we might differ
slightly in musical taste and cultural heritage but the fact that we
could simply contact ravers in sf and ask if we could come and stay w/
them (you) shows that PLUR exists.

there will always be conservative, pleasure-hostile groups and people
but i've given up on being a missionary long aga. if they want to be
miserable, let them.

and when it comes to government, i think people don't pay much
attention to governments these days anyway. governments run by big
business have become so detached from the people. they are not part of
the people and if we can we ignore them because they don't make much
sense outside of their countryclubs.

raves might be illegal but they are still happening and growing.
(some) drugs (at least in europe) are on the way to becoming
legalized. just keep doing what you want to do as long as it doesn't
hurt anybody or stops others from doing what they want to do.
government? what's that?

iris

p.s. to be honest i don't think we could get a revolution together.
slow reformation maybe (as the evolution of culture does anyway), but
revolution....?

a rescent study has shown that sex causes your brain to release dopamine 
and serotonin, two neurotransmitters known to produce feelings of pleasure.
these reactions in the brain show simmilarities to those reactions caused 
by heroin and cocaine. it is these reactions, causing a heightened 
feeling of euphoria, that cause people to scurry back for more, thus 
addiction is inevitable. due to these new findings, your government is 
working on passing a bill that will outlaw sex. our children need 
to be protected.

get it?

      Well, kiddies!  I kinda pulled a disappearing act for a while.  I
left the list without an appropriate goodbye.  I'm sorry.  My bad.  I
had to deal with my life.  Anyway, things are better now and I'm back to
succeeding in school (I'm transferring to U.C. Berkeley!  Wahoo!) and
I'm getting my car back with a new engine, so now it looks like I can
come back and party with you guys every once in a while!  Yeah!  So I
decided to resubscribe to the list (remember me?  It's the one and only
SmileGrl1!), but if you want to send any mail that is specifically meant
for me, please send them to either <JewelMae@aol.com> or
<SmileGrl1@aol.com>.  It makes life easier for me when I don't have to
dig through the posts for personal mail, so thanks in advance.
       Now I was hoping to be out this weekend with my days without my
car finally coming to an end.  Unfortunately for me, my car was supposed
to be finished today and now it won't be done until Monday...  sniff,
sniff.  I was going to ask you all to come celebrate my birthday with me
at @spire's "In the Beginning", but it doesn't look like I can even get
down there now that my car's still in the shop.  I wanted more than
anything to be surrounded by my friends and family on my birthday this
weekend, but instead I'm stuck up here in the middle of nowhere doing
nothing.  I live in the Jamestown/Sonora area and the closest greyhound
station is at least an hour away and the Bay Area is 2 hours away!  Matt
and Stefi said they'd come get me if my car wasn't done, but someone
owes Matt money and he can't come up here until he has money for gas for
the trip up here.  So whoever out there owes him money, please give him
his money so that they can come up here and get me and make my birthday
special for me!!!!  Anyway, if there are any beautiful people out there
who are anywhere near me that would like to come get me, I'd really
appreciate it.  I'd be very generous with the hugs, smiles, candy, good
vibes... and let's not forget money for gas!!!  Oh, and since this would
be one of the most wonderful birthday presents, I'll even let you use my
vibrating hair-brush (ever get a head massage while you're tripping?
well this is even better!).  I know it's a lot to ask, but I've only
been out to one party (Warmth 2) in the last 3 or 4 months and I really
wanted to be with you guys for my birthday, and now I'm just bummed
about the whole thing... If any of you have any suggestions on how to
resolve my dilemma, please call me at (209) 984-3918 or, if that's busy,
call (209) 984-5151.  Or if all else fails, e-mail me at my AOL address
that I mentioned earlier (not the one I'm posting from).  Like I said,
it's a lot to ask, so I'm not getting my hopes up, but I miss all of you
so much and I hope my weekend gets better.  Well, that's all for now,
except my "thought for the day" that I put below.  (Remember those?)  I
hope this finds everyone doing well and living life fully.
                                       Cherishing PLUR,
                                                  Julie Mae

10/16/97 is the given launch date for the Jupiter 2 from the TV series 
"Lost in Space".

Given the current penchant for all-things-flying-saucer-shaped and that 
there's a movie version in production for next year....

Seems like a party idea to me: "Lost in Space" -- marooned on another 
world for the evening.

The big problem is that mostly people shit PLUR.

Why not join unto an existing movement with an equally preposterous
notion that we all unite under the word Jesus. Not the deeds of jesus,
not the thoughts of jesus, not the ethics or mores of jesus. Just say
the word, while you keep on acting hateful, selfish, ignorant, divisive
-- but not to "your own" just to everybody else that doesn't believe or
doesn't share a particularly condoned lifestyle/credo/fashion/ethos. To
follow this path, get thee to a Baptist revival immediately.

No, the 60's squashed itself because people found out that the
beautiful "peace and love" world they had hallucinated for themselves
through drug abuse, "free love" and general shirking of
responsibilities -- all these things had consequences that caused the
movement to fall in on itself... Because, after looking at the big
picture, it was a very selfish movement, prone to decadence and decay,
disease and illness,  posturing and lies, lots of talk, and little
effective action.

In fact the only people that succeeded to change the world out of the
hippie movement did so through some very old fashioned, very american
techniques -- hard work, individualism, idealism & being at the right
place at the right time (e.g. Jobs/Wozniak and all the other
hippy/geeks that have revolutionized the world with personal computing
and brought multimedia connunications to the masses)  and politicians
like Bill Clinton who were willing to fake the pose needed to be
popular during all time periods (i'm sure he was all PLUR-spouting and
love-bead-bangled fduring the 60's, and he's equally full of shit
during the 90's -- whatever makes him seem "groovy" enough to get
elected to the most people most of the time). 

Any changes that happened as a result of the 60's hippy movement were
evolutionary and not revolutionary. The hippies didn't effect the
changes directly, but society changed through a very slow & painful
transformation brought about by discussion, fighting, politics,
warfare, killing, etc between the establishment and the rebels...

Basically, if you wall yourself off in PLUR-ville, you will become
ineffective at change. Ravers will never make a majority, you'll never
be able to dose the world so that everybody shares a consensual
hallucination about how the world should be. You're going to have to
work with the establishment under their terms if you expect to get
anywhere. Yes, this sucks and it's hard -- it's called reality.

Also, to the outside world, all this PLUR-spoutin' looks pretty
irrelevant. Maybe it even seems as ridiculous as the hippies "peace and
love" soundbyte while images of Altamont danced on America's TV
screens. "The people" still hear about the OD's at raves, the suicides,
the stabbings, and the squalid lifestyles of drug abusers. So the
reality is that there is no shining example of "a better way" to hold
up as a model for how to live correctly.

PLUR is a word. An ideal. You can't be it, you can't live it, you can
just talk about it and chastise other people for not being up to this
impossible ideal. We've already been through 2000 years of this
self-torture via Christianity and it's need to grade people against an
unattainable metric of a sin-free life, whether or not you were
sin-free enough to go to heaven, and whether you could measure up to an
idealized image of a man-god, Jesus' , and his supposed beliefs. This
kind of ethical self-flagellation brings about a lot of pain and
suffering that is, IMHO, detrimental to humanity. It ignores human
nature, and the fact that we're all animals trying to survive in a
sometimes brutal&inexplicable world.

eek - had to read that one twice to get the preposterous! the problem with
all of these movements is the 'holier than thou' attitude - 'this is the
_only_ way to create change... i'm right and you're wrong and sinful for
not agreeing with me.' i'm still all for the democratic ideals (the real
ones) - respect ppl for their differences. and of course, the christian
dogma of 'do unto others' which kind of emcompasses this democratic notion
- would you really want someone with disagreeable ideals trying to force
you to see things their way? debating them is one thing, but force is
another. like in _the last supper_ (the movie) - you can't go around
killing ppl who don't share your beliefs. this is obviously extreme, but
there are better ways of invoking change.

was the hippie movement really about political change? there were a lot of
political activists during that period, fighting for human rights, era,
peace, etc... but i don't think they were the ones doing all the drugs and
free lovin'. the ppl who were spending their time wearing black arm bands,
protesting the policies of the time, they were the ones that enacted
change. not the ones who were tripping their faces off.

i'd call it the human rights movement, or something other than the hippie
movement. the hippie movement, like the rave culture, was a hedonistic
thing - personal, somewhat selfish, and not having to do with the politics
of the time. how many raves (with the exception of kerry darling) are
really out there fighting to change things? you can't do this when you're
fucked up on drugs. plur is not political, imo. it has to do with what's
inside of each of us... it's an attitude that affects our outlook. but an
attitude can't change the world. really. only hardcore action can instill
changfe, and for this, folks, you have to stop talking and do something.
what is it that you want to change? plur says nothing of what policies need
to be changed. you want equality? go fight for it. peace? protest in active
ways. you merely want the right to party your asses off? a nice want, i
agree, but completely selfish and having nothing to do with political
issues. please. read your history books. read the newspaper. decide what it
is that you're unhappy with and _do_ something about it. organize a
protest. write your congress people. vote. write letters to the newspapers.
and if there's something you can do that is a little more direct - say you
want to end domestic violence - volunteer! stop sitting on your asses and
murmering 'plur'. this does nothing.

i'm still confused about what the issue of change is here ... plur? what
does this mean? what are you protesting? to reiterate, plur, to me, is a
personal thing. it's how one looks at the wprld. and i do believe (i'll
give it this much), that outlooks are contagious - if i treat the hooker on
my corner with respect, perhaps she'll pass that feeling on. if i stop
flipping off idiot drivers, perhaps they won't do the same. i think that
these energies spread - hence the 'do unto others'. and if anything, it
does some good for your own psyche. you will feel better for respecting ppl
who are different, rather than bashing them, which really doesn't hurt
them, it only hurts the basher. but beyond this, it's ridiculous to think
that this will actually change anything. anyway, i don't want to change
other ppl. they are who they are.... respect them for their choices. i'm
sure a lot of ppl would disagree strongly with the choices i've made, but
i'd like them to look to me with respect because i've found a way of life
that works for me. but this is so selfish, and has nothing to do with
changing the world. the rave movement, again, is a selfish, hedonistic
movement. selfish in that we want to live a certain lifestyle.
not that we don't help others when they're in need.... but selfish in that
we're pretty selfish as a group. don't know if that makes sense, and i'm
sure someone out there is going to misunderstand what i'm saying, but
wanting to party to me is a pretty irrelevant desire in the overall scheme
of things. i posted something a while back about a group of ravers in the
uk who are actually using their parties to establish change - setting up
communal housing and such from the profits - i guess the only way i can see
raving as a way to change things is to actually use the proceeds to benefit
something.

Hi Folx!

Seeing as this Monday (7/14) will be the last MAD, that venerable staple of the 
SF scene, what about a dinner or meetup beforehand to send it off with a bang? 
This was discussed a few weeks ago, but I don't know if anything's come of 
it--- Matt, got any plans in the werks?  Let me know if there's something going 
down; if not, how about a rollcall of MAD participants, and suggestions for 
restaurants or a meetup spot?  


On another note, I went and checked out Nikita last night, for the first time 
in about 2 years.  Not bad, I must say, apart from the occasional hassles to 
the gal I was with from overambitious young bucks.  Decent jungle (but LOUD!!) 
in the basement, and the top floor music and crowd was pretty good. It was 
interesting that in one club, there were 4 different scenes going on 
simultaneously-- mellow ppl sitting in booths listening to jungle downstairs, 
cheesier music/ pickupy scene  in the small front room, straight techno in the 
main large room, and great hardcore and a friendly crowd in the top room.  Had 
to take a nap on the leather sofa for awhile around 4, but overall a fun time.  
There's hope for clubs yet..

Peace, Nathan

 It has been said that there is value in attempting to achieve an 
Ideal that one *knows* one cannot achieve.

I had a GREAT time at Karma last night..
GREAT location, air conditioned... didn't this place use to be a juice 
bar??
Admission was a little steep for a Sac rave, but thats ok..

Music was alright..  Not my favorite style, but the DJ's had skills..

There were a lot of people just standing around watching, but there was 
a good vibe on the dance floor...

Those girls dancing with the poles were kinda crazy....
It was a fun night of dancing with good friends.....
I would say the best rave i have been to in Sac..

the trip to yosemite is planned for the weekend of 
july 25-27.

Geoff has prepared a very thorough explanation which 
he will post soon.

In the mean time, this is the situation.

The campgrounds in the park are booked full.
Geoff has an alternative which he will explain
and I am looking at sites outside of the park.
People need to decide if they are going and
get your names to us especially if we need
to make reservations.

I also need to set up carpooling info. Several
people want to go that don't have rides.
We may rent some cars if there is sufficient interest
and need.

Please let me know if you have a ride available
or if you need a ride and what your location is.

this is going to be an incredible trip as this park
is extremely beautiful... so don't miss out.

><{{{"> <"}}}><

have a great weekend

Hi! I have nice color printer and a laminator at work so if anybody wants
some laminates just e-mail me with the design that you want and i'll make
'em. The plastic is a little thin, but i can run tehm thru a few times.
They might not come out as good as kinko's, but it's FREE!!

Geez!  I guess I must have been away from the list too long.  Well, even
though I've been part of the SF scene since 1992, I've been living in
Jamestown, CA (near Sonora) almost continuously (with a semester spent
in Hayward as well) since 1994.  I'm almost afraid to admit that even in
the 3 years I've been living so close to Yosemite (about an hour's drive
or less), I still have yet to go.  I've always had friends say that they
would like to go with me, but when it came down to actually going, I've
never gotten any commitments from people.  So now that I have come back
to the list, it was refreshing to see that a group is planning a trip
there!  And it starts the day after I finish my summer session college
courses!  Yay!  What a way to reward myself after a summer spent
studying.  And since I had to miss partying with all of you this weekend
for my birthday because of my car troubles, at least I know that I can
see you guys then!  I miss you guys so much.  It's been too long (3
months).  So let me know the details and I'll meet you guys there!
                                       Always,
                                              Julie Mae

Yes, Karma was fantastic!

I had soooo much fun.

When I got out of the car, I had this really bad feeling, like something was 
going to go wrong--I thought I was tripping, but my two friends had the same 
feeling.

Got in the party, everyone's standing around, drininking alcohol, about 10 
people dancing.  Whatever.  I'm still tripping, wondering why I spent $12 to 
go to a weak party w/ bad bad vibes in an ex-strip joint/juice bar 
(Tailfeathers!).

Then Rig-A-Tony (that is the first blonde guy who came on, right?) came on, 
and I (and it seems everyone else) just had to dance.  And then bad feeling 
was gone, and the bad vibe was gone.

The people were soooo nice.  I saw/heard of a couple people tweaking HARD, but 
not anything too serious, and there were no medical emergencies (I think).  
And there were some (ahem) older people there, I was thinking I should have 
brought my mom along, but they were cool. I've never felt so good at a party.

But Rig-A-Tony and Karizma were the highlights of the night.  Overall, it was 
a great party, and I don't think I've felt so good at one for a long long long 
time.

Okay, help me out, folx!  There's this song I've heard at Karma last night 
(maybe when Rig-A-Tony was spinning, but I'm not too sure), at the free 
Memorial day Kick Drum party a while ago, and I think I heard it a long long 
time ago (as in early 90s ) too.  So it's an old song, maybe a classic.

It mostly consists of this guy talking.  I'm not too sure about what he's 
saying, but I caught some parts, like "smokin on some weed," and "and over 
here you have . . . "  Then there's the somewhat chorus part that says 
something something, "prepare to dance" (???) and the music goes BOOM--it's 
like a breakdown or something.  I assume it's house music.

Okay, I know that's really vague and terrible, and I probably butchered the 
lyrics horribly.  But can anybody help identify this song?  I like it a lot.

trainspotter Pete here  [: P

The song you're talking about is called "flash" by Green Velvet, It is
released on Relief records from Chicago. It is probably the original
version as there are other remixes by  Paul Johnson, DJ Sneak  and
others.  It goes: 
 
Good evening parents,
tonight I'm going to take you on a tour of club Mad.
where all the bad little kiddies go to try  to leave their bodies......
So I've equipped each and everyone of you with your own individual
camera,
so you can take pictures of bad little kiddies doing bad little things ,
for tomorrows paper...

Not here more than 30 seconds and I already see a bad little kiddy doin'
a bad little thing,
He's sucking on a balloon, but this is not a ordinary balloon, its a
ballon filled with a gas called Nitrous Oxide,laughing gas, he he he he
he ha ha
but this is no laughing matter,
camera ' s ready, prepare to flash

And there's more , but you have to hear it, its a very good tune.
I hope this is what you're talking about,
 
Pete
If you can't find it, e-mail me

The desire to have raving be part of a movement comes from a need to
have a "purpose" for raving, perhaps to legitimize it in ones mind.

Raving to me at its core is about personal expression, art, which in
it's purest form is without excess baggage such as a dollar $ign. This
may explain why we view the idea of "mainstream" with a wary eye.
Americans seem to only appreciate art that is "worth" something, just
because someone else said it was good.

Hence, I believe raving in America is the voice of the personal desire
to express oneself, which has otherwise been labeled and sold for $0.99
with a fill-up at AM PM. Personal artistic expression is ravings
purpose.

i wrote this to iris in a personal post, and here's my theory on it all:
the protestant work ethic is so engrained in our minds here that we feel
guilty about having fun. raving is a movement, a hedonistic one. but this
doesn't fly here in the us. we don't feel comfortable about shedding all
our mores and having a blast for the sake of having a blast. i was
introduced to this movement by a bunch of foreign students in school back
in '90, and their goal in raving was was to forget about all the pressures
of the 'real world' and just have fun for the night. this is what it's all
about. a hedonistic escape. nothing more. i think that the reason americans
try to give it a political edge is because we feel guilty about being
hedonistic. if there is some legitimate reason we can give to it, it makes
it okay. but that's bullshit. you know, at least for me, this, and my life
in general, has been about questioning the belief systems i have  - where
they came from, why i have them... why the hell do i feel like a bad person
for wanting to party my ass off and not focus all my energies on my career?
it's because i was raised to believe that hard work is the only way to
attain happiness, which is bullshit. i came to the conclusion a few years
back that some of my socialized beliefs do work for me, but some of them
are outdated beliefs that probably didn't work for my parents, or their
parents before them. each generation questions these stodgy ideals, and
takes with them the ones they think will work for them individually. for
me, yes, work is important, but it's not the only thing. it's important to
put aside 'reality' and go nuts once in a while. for me, finding a balance
between all of my needs is the key. i don't see the need to 'excuse' my
desire to have fun. it's a need, and it's a right.

i have said this before: the only way i can see raving having a political
agenda is if the proceeds from a party are used to benefit a needy group.
otherwise, it's all about having fun, entering an altered state of reality.
leave it at that, and enjoy it! it's okay!

it's about having fun. but yes, this is a form of personal expression. hehe
the reason i view the mainstream with a wary eye is because i was the kid
all the popular ppl picked on - i don't trust anything remotely 'popular'.
i like just being myself without the pressures of having to fit into some
sort of clique - i can do this in my chosen career, and i can do this at
parties. i think that probably a majority of us prefer to maintain our
individuality and this 'scene' provides a comfortable forum for doing so.

hmmmm.... maybe for the musicians in the group... and yes, dress is a big
form of personal expression. wrote a thesis on that very subject in school.
but to me, this will always be a place where i can be myself and have a
blast. artistic expression? i'm an artist by trade - i'd rather keep that
out of my partying experiences. :P

cheers - e. :)

     Hey everybody!!!
   Ok something funny happened today, but it was for the better, My mom and i
went on a drive to the lake today and i was telling her how i was going to go
back to SF on the 25, she asked what i was planning to do, i told her like
ive always told her:"lisa and i are going dancing", (she's heard this a
billion times before, and thinks im going to club x or something(because i
went there once) I always feared to tell her i was going to a rave, cuz she
thinks everybody goes and shoots heroin and  gets high(a mothers nitemare :o)
)So then she says 
"do you go to Rages?" 
"what?" i said, eventhough i knew what she ment, i thought it was funny
"Rages?"she said again 
"Raves you mean mom?"i said kinda laughing 
 "yeah" 
"yep" i said shyly, as if she would say i couldn't go(how old am i?)
"Arn't there a lot of drugs at those things?"(i knew she'd say that!)
"Not the ones i go to mom, im not inta that stuff" AAACCKK i was hopeing
she'd buy that!
Well luckily that was the end of the convesation, so im gunna go listen to
some music now, you all have a good "one"
Mad love and PLUR
JiL

reading that person's post about how, as americans, we have a need to paste
a reason to everything we do in order to validate it, i can see how that
applies to me. but then ive always been some sort of romantic, raving then
added a streak of idealism to that, what can i say? but ive always tried to
maintain a perspective, and even though one cant help getting caught up in
the emotion of something, ive also at least tried to admit to myself that
im merely caught in the emotion of something, when i am.

nevertheless, i think there is something going on at most raves that can be
spread to the rest of the world, that feels like could change the world in
some way.

what i found at my first rave that i dont find in my normal life is that
unselfishness and lack of judgement, the act that most of us perform of
being nice to somebody, talking to them, hugging them, giving them a piece
of candy, and all for no real reason, just for the sake of being nice.
furthermore, when we do this, we do not exclude anyone, but give it out to
anyone who wants it.

when i first witnessed this, i was shocked at how much i discovered i
really need that sort of situation sometimes, how simple it is, and how
good it makes me feel.

sometimes when i watch the news or read the paper, or hear of awful,
negative events that happen to other people, i wonder that the rest of the
world cannot realize and know the attitudes and actions that permeate the
rave atmosphere. if only people could, living and working, then dying,
would be so much nicer.

we do this every weekend, but it is true that it is probably not going to
change the world. but what i hope is at least happening is that all the
ravers that experience this at parties tries to live it in their regular
daytime lives a little bit, then passes it on to their children. teach them
this attitude, let them know the enjoyment of practicing it for its own
sake, rather than attach some vague, uncertain reward, like going to heaven
when youre dead. then, who knows? maybe in the future, society will be that
much more utopian? and so in that sense, i guess i sortof think of raves as
a kind of movement.

If this is the case then why does raving work in other countries whose
cultures are also steeped in Protestantism ( ie Germany or Great Britain)?
There has to be something more too it than this...Why is it that the more
fucked up a city is the more likely it is to develop a thriving rave scene
( and also one that is based on harder forms of techno )?

 It seems to be strongly accepted (in academia at least) that the more 
repression (of certain human needs and desires) you have, the more likely 
expressions of the situation will crop up (unexpectdly) in the strangest of 
places.

 The example I learned from was that of Classic Hollywood Horror films 
and gay/lesbian sexuality. In the 30's (the start of Classic Horror for 
Hollywood) we have many Horror movies that treat gay as "other" or 
monsterous. Bride Of Frankenstein is a very good example (check out the 
sterotyped "bad" doctor). The reasoning goes along the lines that gay 
sexuality simply wasn't talked about or accepted in America. This 
repression resulted in an increased desire to expose this lifestyle (by 
Gays) to mainstream America. One avenue was the Horror film. Horror was less 
tightly regulated and there were many Gay directors, screenwriters and 
actors.

 Thje results are often hilarious in some cases. I spent an entire 
quarter of looking at Horror films every week and studying Gay theory. 
Quite the eye opener.

 Hope this helps,

peas,

You can wait for the domestic release of Apollo 440's latest album which is
due in August or pick up the import now of course.

Search for "Apollo 440" on the search engines for their home page location,
etc.

This track is *old* btw. "Raw Power" is what's going down now. Joe Bob says
check it out.

Hi all.

Here is an updated vers. of a post i put onto the vrave list a a little 
while ago:

I'm over in the US from London, England until mid September travelling 
all over. Just a DJ & his tunes & a couple of friends looking for some  
fun times & party people. With some chilling out thrown in for good 
measure & good health. So heres the deal...

This is my first time in the US and my first chance to DJ outside of 
London. I play Drum & Bass, chillout & trance/acid techno & I've got a 
few things lined up but i'm looking for some more. At the moment i'm in 
NYC (fun & crazy!) until July 14 then up to the mid west (St Louis & 
Chicago) onto Madison for the full moon (18/19th?) back to MPLS for the 
26th & then onto Oregon & down the CA coast (SF, LA & SD) then to 
Burning Man in Nevada @ the end of Aug & then back to NYC & then home in 
September (haven't decided when yet!)

I also work for a new record co. in London (Seraphim Records) - we're 
putting out some lush, chilled D&B soon and other styles in the future - 
and i'm looking to make some contacts over here. If you DJ, promote, 
distribute, run a store, a record co or know someone who does or 
whatever you will love what i've got with me. I'm not being pushy, its 
just that everyone we play the tunes to loves them! Or maybe you'll hate 
them. It would be quite good to meet someone who does just to balance 
things out a bit!

im also looking for tapes of stuff for future releases on the label


I'm also pushing my flatmate's internet based radio station in London 
(starting soon on www.0171.com - cool site check it out) & DJ agency.

And maybe i'll have a holiday in between. Maybe!

So there you have it. Anyone interested in any of the above? If so, say 
hi. I pick up my mail every other day (ah - the joys of the 'net!)  and 
it'll give me a chance to find out a bit more a bit about the various 
scenes & styles over here or just communicate with some good people.

Is anybody out there??  (sorry for being so corny!)

Love

invisible cola (Rob)

UPDATE ON 14th July:

Well NYC was soooo good. Met lots of excellent people (hi to Dara & all 
@ Breakbeat Science, Astralwerks, Sm:)e, Koncrete Jungle, Jungle Nation 
& Twilo plus all the loverly ravers & jumper i met!),  had some great 
parties & everybody who heard our pre-release CD loved it! Lots of 
interest so Seraphim Records will be droppin' on the US sometime in the 
future. As will our DJs & artists :)

After the craziness of NYC im looking forward to seeing & meeting the 
other parts of this fair land.

Thing is i know San F. & area is going to be just my style so come back 
& say hi. See yous in August :)))))))))

I want to thank everyone  who came out on friday. Everybody was so cool and
well behaved!  Once the drinkers crawled home to their beds, we let it rip
until dawn.   I thought that most of you kids were sobEr, but the absense of
50 bananas the next morning made me think otherwise!  I'd like to get loud
about the dj's who shook the rafters:

...Annie Mae...Deepfog...Marshall Villarosa...Vertigo...Jonathan...@@ron

These kids are sharp as tacks; keep your ears open for them if you haven't
heard them already!

To anyone who I know but didn't invite; it means that I didn't know how to
contact you!

And to those who left early and missed the sunrise orgy with the aliens;
next time you'll know to stick around!

PS,  Hey everybody, Pengo talks in his sleep!

heavylove,

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Precedence: bulk

This is a groovy book i just read based on SF Rave culture.
 
At first, when i saw the book w/ it~s electric cover and the words
<<Ecstasy Club>> i thought [man, here we go, another sensationalized
book about our scene, with everything blown out of proportion], but i
was pleasantly surprised and immediately became engrossed.
 
Here's the gist...<<when the young, hypertalented idealists who call
themselves ECSTASY CLUB find an abandoned piano factory in Oakland,
they make it the focus of a round~the~clock rave the likes of which
the Bay Area has never seen before [hmm]. They also make the factory a
base camp in their search for a method of time travel [sign me up!]
that combines computer wizardry, esoteric spirituality, and
mind~altering substances [yum, my fave]. The Club's mesmeric leader,
Duncan, and our resourceful narrator, Zach, actually manage to 'break
time' online, only to discover that an unsettling array of characters
has beat them to it. Government [THE MAN] agents, corporate saboteurs,
religious zealots, and even the local cops [no shit!] are suddenly out
to get the Club. As they battle an ingeniously conceived conspiracy,
Zach battles his own growing affection for Duncan's lover [drama!],
Lauren, and begins to wonder whether enlightenment is all it's cracked
up to be.>>
 
So it's pretty well written, i heared Rushkoff talk about his book,
his focus is on <<current counterculture>>, how first it is a <<cult>>
and then becomes <<overculture>> and he talked about our search for
authenticity, he respects Ravers, especially in his interviews since
he talks about the Rave scene an all of its aspects, he's not out to
exploit us, but IMO he's helping in giving an understanding of what
Raving is.

Welp, that~s my $17.50 [cost of the book] Rushkoff's website is listed
under http://www.levity.com check it out if you're curious, and please
email me w/ your <<deep thoughts>>
ciao,
~~ena~

Subject: Last Night.. A raving story(long)
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.org
Precedence: bulk

Well, after my ride toyed with Teresa and my hopes for a week as to which
party we were going to.. it all blew up last night.  Originally, way back a
month ago, Teresa and I were thinking, *ok, we'll go to Infectious Grooves.*
Heeheheh.. bad Idea.  Anyway, so along comes @spire, and with my current
financial situation (or lack there of) I thought an outdoor party sounded
like damn good fun!
*So here's the deal..* I tell Teresa.. *We should go to @spire."
But it was really all up to Matt (our ride) because, wherever he goes, we
sortof get taken to. Not that I don't appreciate getting driven around.  I
really do.  But here's what happened...
Matt thought we were going to the Gathering... but there wasn't a gathering
this weekend.  And then he said Intoxication.. which isn't until next
weekend.  SO someone's calander is a little off.  But all we know is we are
MAKING IT TO A RAVE SATURDAY NIGHT.
SO there I am.. sitting in Teresa's room, glitter in hand, when Matt calls.  
*UH.. would you guys mind if we didn't go raving?*
Cuz matt's friend had some DJs coming up to spin and Matt's house was the
perfect location to have it.  But it was a no-win situation.  Either the
house party and no rave for us.. or rave and no house party for his friends.
 So we compromised with the Be home by 3 a.m. thing and decided that's what
time his house party could start.  It was now 8:30, and we still didn't have
a rave to go to.  OUt-A-SIght!  But the voice mail was a message saying to
call back closer to July 12th.  There were only 3 and a half hours left in
the day, and I didn't know how much longer we had to get closer to the 12th.
 
Anyway, so we ended up going to Infectious Grooves.  I was expecting a huge
line, with homie G's all lined up and the whole bit.  But there was virtually
no line.  We got right in the door with some smiles and such from the
cashiers.  There couldn't have been more than 200 people there.  So we look
around as the place starts to fill up.. and find some pure MDMA.  =) No more
bunk E!  I'm seeing a few people I know and dancing around.  I realized I
tune out all bad vibes so beautifully.  Not that there were many.  The
visuals were beautiful.  Except, at one point I looked up and realized they
were showing the opening scene from "Kids".   I ran into part of my candy
raver crew from Area 51.  Hello to: Sandy!  MarQ, Ben, ( and his little bro
Billy) Mars Man, Crisco, Luke Squared, Lisa, Jamie, Sky, and all the many ppl
who are just faces in my head.  I love you all.  And with the E and the hugs
and the "I love you so much" I had a really good night.  DJ Ghost was
spinning some of DJ Dan's "LOose CaBooSe", which was ok, since I love a lot
of those tracks.  Thanx to Crisco for naming his stuffed toy after me.. DOn't
forget her name now!  To the girl on the floor who looked like she passed
out, but once we gave her some water and massages she was ok.  IF I missed
the bad vibe and circle dancing and gangstas I really couldn't care less.
 This is why I love raving.  Just me and my little stuffed Nosy Bear.  Hope
to see you all soon..

       hugs n'Stuff,
           'trice the tekno diva                 <<<<RAVEON>>>>

>>------------   ORIGINAL ATTACHMENT   --------
>>SENT 07-02-97 FROM CURRAN_ANNE @MAILMN
>>
>>Hi,
>>
>>As you may have seen recently on Channel 4 News or San Jose
>>Mercury News, a beautiful open space on the San Mateo Coast
>>called Cascade Ranch is in immediate danger of development. A
>>grassroots effort to save Cascade Ranch is underway. The
>>Coastside Habitat Coalition is leading this fight.
>>
>>Cascade Ranch is halfway between Santa Cruz and Half Moon Bay
>>near Ano Nuevo State Park.  Development of 112 RV sites, 76 tent
>>campsites, 130 room resort, 12 cabins, 40 room lodge, store,
>>conference center, multiple gyms, 2 pools, tennis courts, etc. is
>>planned for the site.
>>
>>Issues with the proposed development:
>>-------------------------------------
>>   - One of the most beautiful stretches of California coastline
>>and open space will be marred.
>>   - This campsite/lodge can support about 1000 people per day.
>>Neighboring communities are small (<500 people).   Traffic along
>>highway 1 will dramatically incease.  Impact on local communities
>>and coastside ecology will be major.
>>   - An endangered species (San Francisco Garter Snake) and a
>>threatened species (Red-legged Frog) currently inhabit Cascade
>>Ranch and will probably not survive this development
>>   - A large well will be drilled at the site of a former Ohlone
>>Indian settlement.  This is the place where the explorer Portola
>>first encountered the Ohlone Indians in the 1700s.   It is a
>>potentially valuable archaeological site.
>>
>>What concerned people can do:
>>-----------------------------
>>   - Forward this message to others who may be interested.
>>   - See http://www.outre.com/cascade for more info.
>>   - Join the grassroots effort and contribute in whatever way
>>you can.
>>          Address:  Coastside Habitat Coalition
>>                    P.O. Box 71
>>                    San Gregorio, CA 94074
>>          Phone:    (415) 726-0565
>>          E-mail:   sangregoro@aol.com
>>   - Let your representatives and the media know what you think
>>about preserving the coastside.
>>   - Participate in a *nature hike* July 5.  Join naturalist Joe
>>Barnwell to explore beautiful Cascade Ranch State Park which is
>>adjacent to the private development site. This hike is sponsored
>>by the Coastside Habitat Coalition. Suggested sliding scale
>>donation of $5 - $20.  Meet at the San Gregorio General Store at
>>the corner of Highway 84 and Stage Rd. on Saturday July 5 at
>>10:00 am. Call 415-726-0565 for more information.
>>   - Attend the next *volunteer action meeting* on Wednesday
>>evening July 9 at the San Gregorio General Store at the corner of
>>Highway 84 and Stage Rd. at 7:30 pm. Call 415-726-0565 for more
>>information.
>>   - Come out and have fun at the *Coastal Protection Concert*
>>the first weekend in August. The concert will feature hot Bay
>>Area bands including Box Set, Frontmen, Pele Juju, Harmony Grits
>>and Claddagh Band. This concert will raise money for legal

I have worked in Yosemite for the National Park Service, not the snack
bar or the cafeteria but in search and rescue, with police rangers, and
educational tours and history programs for children.  And I'd like to
give some free advice....
 

     1. if bringing drugs (I don't reccomend) be very discreet... I
     mean  VERY.... what  might be a simple misdemeanor outside the park
     or national forest can be a very big Federal Crime..... and these
     Police rangers usually don't play around.  also the if you have to
     have a court hearing it is done by the federal judge appointed to
     the court in Yosemite and he is not a nice guy to people doing
     stupid things.
     2. try your hardest to carpool into the park... the pollution from
     the cars is killing the trees in the park...especially the
     ponderosa and jefferey pines.... and also, the entry fee was raised
     from $5 - $20.
     3. Try to keep the wildlife WILD.... do not feed the animals... by 
     people feeding them, they are becoming unable to take care of  
     themselves and are not living as long as they should/could...    
     also try to stay on the trails... they are there for your safety
     and  so that the natural beauty of Yosemite stays as untouched as
     possible.

 

sorry for sounding like an old man but that place is one of natures most
beautiful works of art and we must preserve it....

Well, kiddies!  I kinda pulled a disappearing act for a while.  I left the
list without an appropriate goodbye.  I'm sorry.  My bad. I had to deal with
my life.  Anyway, things are better now and I'm back to succeeding in school
(I'm transferring to U.C. Berkeley!  Wahoo!) and I'm getting my car back with
a new engine, so now it looks like I can come back and party with you guys
every once in a while!  Yeah!  Just in time to ask you all to come celebrate
my birthday with me at @spire's "In the Beginning"!!!  After being away for
so long, I want more than anything to be surrounded by my friends and family
on my birthday this weekend!  Now, "In the Beginning" is not my party, it's
Jeremy's and Aaron's, but that's where I'll be, so I don't consider this BSP
(yeah, I remember the rules...).  But please, please, please, please go to it
so I can see you!  Okay, now I'm done begging and groveling. 
      So I decided to come back on the list.  I'm actually subscribing using
my <juliemae@goldrush.com> address but I plan on making my posts, as well as
receiving any mail personally addressed to me, through this address.  Believe
me, it makes life easier for me not to have to dig through all the posts
looking for stuff that's to me specifically.  So whenever you guys write to
me, use either <JewelMae@aol.com> or <SmileGrl1@aol.com>.  Thanks in advance.
 Well, that's all for now, except my "thought for the day" that I put below.
 (Remember those?)  I hope this finds everyone doing well and living life
fully.
                         Cherishing P.L.U.R.,

Hi Folx!

How about a pre-MAD dinner at 10,000 Buddhas?

Stellar (Kevin) describes it as:
vegan
cheap
really
really
good food
and run by buddhists
part of the profits go toward building a temple im told

on geary between jones and leavenworth

Say, maybe around 8:30 or 9?  I haven't called yet to see how late they're 
open, but it sounds like a good place.  SO, if ya wanna go, fire off an email 
to me AT THE FOLLOWING ADDRESS:

nathan@cwsi.com

(the server for the email account subscribed to sfraves is very very slooooow, 
and I sometimes don't get messages until the following day, so don't send it 
there)


I'll make a reservation for the number of ppl who want to dine.  If you can't 
respond until after 6 pm for some reason, call me at 370-5060 and I'll add 
you.  See ya then!  

Peace, Nathan

well back WAY back when I was 22 I had contacts.  And I used to wonder why
one of them would always fall out at night when I would sleep.  I had
softies that you could sleep with.

Months after I had given up the contacts for a more John Lennonish look
fresh for the 1990's and Green Day 1990, I fell asleep drunk on Lindsay's
floor.  Later on that morning someone told me, surprisingly, that I
actually sleep with one eye open!

Hey Blake, maybe we would be a good act together, my eye flickering, you
doing a presidential state of the union in your sleep and b((merang (he
alwyas comes back to you!) playing his abstract mindbender...

well, it's just a thought.  perhaps it is not profitable enough.  oh well.
time to get depressed, quit dj'ing and appliy for a job at Mickey Dee's.

I'm actually 320 years old, and I traveled here from the early 25th
century, where me -n- Buck Rogers used to sit around and pound red hook
ales and pick up on Venutian Belly Dancers.

Anyone like B((merang can testify to how much "Star Trek:  The Next
Generation" I watch, so that is proof enough that I was accidentally
teleported back here into the dismal 20th century when I was in a tanning
booth and apparently the operator spilled coffee on the control panel and
it went haywire causing a temporal causality loop that causes me to jump
around the space-time continuim whether or not I am exxing.  Whew.  Did I
say that all in one word?

So does California rEALLY  fall into the ocean?  I'm not saying.

Cause wE are creating our own future, and I wouldn't want to alter the
possible course of history to repeat itself.

I wish I could go back though to get a 1998 horse racing results or
something.

all right blah blah blah.  that's enough chatter.  My theeth are getting
tired, gonna have to go take them out now.

Since what you said interests me I thought I'd make a comment and
express an opinion....(or two ;-)

 Although it might feel like that I really don't think so.... what MOST
people feel (although I can't speak for you) is :

  1) the mind expansiveness of psychedelic drug use (see 60's movement)
    which if it doesn't go beyond "just" taking more drugs leads
    nowhere (see R. Alpert aka Ram Dass)
  2) COMMUNITY!!!  Cities ABSOLUTELY SUCK and SUCK bigtime in their
    community - they DON't have it and it feels lonely!! Pure and
simple.
    Most of my life I've lived in small towns ie under 10,000 people.
    There you know your neighbors etc. Everytime you go shopping you
    meet friends... everytime you do business you meet friends....
    You can leave your doors open...  You know 1000+ people and
    you can share....
    Live with 4000 people and you know 2000 people.... live with 
    6 million and you're lucky if you know 12 (at least well)...
    see my point?

  What you are feeling here is community... like going down to the local
  market and really talking to the people there, talking to the clerks,
  having them help you because they actually know you... actually
"knowing"
  people when you go somewhere.....
 
  So for an experiment: go to Safeway... pay attention to your time
there...
  How many people do you talk to? How many people do you share something
  with? etc...
  Now consider how nice it is to go to a rave and start meeting lots of
  people who actually want to see you, talk to you etc.  Feels good
  doesn't it! 
  Now go to a club... Well they've got lights and music JUST LIKE a rave
  don't they?  But notice how lonely it is because people aren't
sharing.
  
  So raves aren't special because of lights or music are they? CLubs
have
  that and they aren't special... so I'm not a believer that what
  makes raves special is the "music".... It's the sense of community....
  It's the sharing... It's the fact that the DJ's who play the music
  actually hang out and are part of the community... which feeds back
  and causes you to like their music even more because you know them
  etc.....

  You actually need "community".... some people get it at their local
   church... some people hang out with the new age, yoga whatever
groups...
  some people hang out at schools... and some people hang out at
raves...
  but without the sense of community or "belonging" life is pretty
lonely...

  All these negative things you read about are MOST often (but not
always)
products of large cities with breakdown of community... Jack the Ripper
normally happens in big cities.... bank robbers, drive by shootings
etc...
gang violence etc... these are the products of big cities...

 Of course small towns are NOT utopia... people sometimes go bonkers and
shoot their family... bad things happen... but bad things happen at
these
wonderful raves too.... just not as often in small towns....

  My relatives in small town WV could never understand all the negative
things they read about in the papers... it really wasn't a part of
their world....

  You might really like living in a small town like Bodega Bay or
someplace
where you actually "knew" people around you.... I guess what I am saying
is that I don't believe raves are going to change the world... they are
just helping you discover how much it sucks to live in a world without
community (which is the way of life in big cities and always was, even
hundreds of years ago)....

  SO people living in small towns across the world already are
"changed"...
they don't need the rave movement to teach them what they already
know...
living in community is the most positive way to live.... we (in the
large cities) need raves to give us a community to hang out in....

 Just my opinion,

 Mike

Hey all you wavers let me tell you about this Misson of ours,

My day starts off good nice sunny morning I am supposed to meet Jer at
City E at 10:00 am. I look at my clock after I shit, shower, shave
etc.. I think Shit it is 10:00 I am supposed to be at city E but as I
am walking out the door I get a call it is Jer saying he is running
late but he will be at City E in a while and tell everyone to stay and
wait till he gets there. I show up and there is No one waiting to move
anything I get my Chai Tea  and boom Jer is there with his truck and
sound system. And with what looks like a small skeleton crew. I think
Alright lets get it started cause we are already running kind of late.
We hang there for a while then we decided to leave. We get to SC kind
of lagging I lose them we are playing pager tag. Then we hook up they
need me to get the generator. Which is a mission to get to the place
to rent it. I look at  my watch and it is like 1:00 I am like "Fuck"
we are way lagging the party was supposed to start at 12:00  so we get
the gene and they get the sound down the Hill (ha, ha, ha,) I think
Kewl I did not have to take the speakers down that steep cliff. So we
proceed to setup and as I am getting the gene out of my Van guess who
rolls up? Who you ask well the beach patrol. And they ask what the
Gene is for and we say for our sound system cause we could not lie and
say for our BBQ or Cars so we asks if we have a permit and we say No
and he says then you have to pack your stuff up and leave. We sit
there for what seems like hours as disapponted ravers show up and we
say we are going to move it to our new secret location. He hang out
some more then proceed to our secret local. When we show up
there,There are some Locks on the gate to the forest location and
signs that say No trespassing. We think Shit our new location has been
busted too. At this point we are really starting to panic we have  car
loads or Ravers that want to party. So we run around for like hours
trying to find a new location. Well actually Jer did we all marinated
at the little mexican restaurant on Highway 1 So finally Jer comes
back at 11:00 PM and says he has found a spot. Keep in Mind this party
was supposed to start at 12:00 in the afternoon. So we go to the spot
and set up and get things going. I have to send a special thanks to
all the DJ's that played they were all good. Shouts goes out to Phil
(pistachio) and Anonymous sorry did not get your real name and there
buddy Jeremy that bought the Dope lights that lite up the beach. Phil
went on playing some good mellow trance I think? then Anonymous busted
some real nice melodic trance. Then I stepped up to the plate and
Played. I hope those that were there liked my sounds? It was good till
the circuit breaker went out twice as I was Knobbing the sound and
Eq's right at the climax of some real good hard Tek rekkids. But it
was fun and everyone was real nice the 300 + plus hard core dedicated
party goers Me and @spire crew would like to thank you. This was Jer
and Arons first party and it fucking rocked!! Even through out all the
problems of some persons trying to get the party busted it still went
off!! better luck next time to the assholes that tried to get it
busted. I wont forget what Jer told me in the begging of our mission.
He said "Macadio I will make sure you spin at this party today. It
will not get busted I will do whatever I have to, to make sure you
play" And he held up on that promise by putting on a phat party Thank
you Jer and I look forward to playing for you and Aron any time. O BTW
thanks to all the crew that helped Vertigo, Adam G, george, the wonder
twin girls and all the rest that I can't think of. Sorry this post is
so long I can keep going but I will stop now. For those of you that
missed out. Sorry but you truely missed out this was a really good
party.

Love ya all,
Macadio

I remember a while ago Niels saying something about riding his dinasaur to a
Rave, wearing shaved momoth skin baggies or something.  That would make him
pretty old. :)

At 45 I still wasn't the oldest member of
>the list but,...

yes, actually I am the oldest one, though I can't prove it to any of you.
I'm actually 320 years old, and I traveled here from the early 25th
century, where me -n- Buck Rogers used to sit around and pound red hook
ales and pick up on Venutian Belly Dancers.

Anyone like B((merang can testify to how much "Star Trek:  The Next
Generation" I watch, so that is proof enough that I was accidentally
teleported back here into the dismal 20th century when I was in a tanning
booth and apparently the operator spilled coffee on the control panel and
it went haywire causing a temporal causality loop that causes me to jump
around the space-time continuim whether or not I am exxing.  Whew.  Did I
say that all in one word?

So does California rEALLY  fall into the ocean?  I'm not saying.

Cause wE are creating our own future, and I wouldn't want to alter the
possible course of history to repeat itself.

I wish I could go back though to get a 1998 horse racing results or
something.

all right blah blah blah.  that's enough chatter.  My theeth are getting
tired, gonna have to go take them out now.

Well folks, this is it. MAD is ending. After tonight, that's it! Sayonara,
Arrive a derci, 
Adios, Cheers, A Slaam A-Laikum,  C-YA!

I just want to thank everyone, especially the punters and gurners who came
out and spent their hard earned money to dance at the club every week. I
really apprieciate the opportunity to be involved in MAD(Thanks Joe!).

Lasting memories from the club:
-Meeting/hanging out with Carl Craig & his girfriend Hannah. Then...
-Carl Playing live @ Madness while Bruce Lee's "Chinese Connection" was on
the big screen(per his request).
-"Dennis Hopper" the security guard.
-2001: A Space Odessey.
-The one kid who NEVER EVER had his ID, or any money who insisted on trying
to get into the club EVERY week!  Most of the time with no luck.
-Star Wars.
-Fred the security guard wearing tampons in his ears one week after losing
his earplugs.
-Alec Empire saying in his teutonic tinged accent, "This is crazy!"
-Driving around SF with Dave Clarke, just listening to him talk.
-"No Eye Contact Man."
-Antonio the batender and his computer questions.
-Menstral Blood discussions w/ Sig.
-Portuguese accents.
-The MAD/Orbital Giveaway night. And the arguments before it.
-Happy Donuts.
-Eddie the security guard.
-Alan Oldham weekend.
-The Final MAD.

See you all tonight!

Hello friends of music, I need your help.
I lost a very special necklace at aspire, a gift from my best friend. I
guess I was so involved with my glowsticks that I didnt notice the
necklace slip off.
Its a candy-raver necklace and it has a Ying - Yeng bead in the middle
and two beads with the letter G.
If you have seen it, or know anyone that has, please write back.
Thanks all!

gEnE-E

P.S. Aspire was BOMB!

we were not talking about whether and where raving _works_. we were
talking about whether the rave scene could develop into a political
movement. and our theory was that it wouldn't because it's a purely
hedonistic movement w/ no interest in politics. e.menon suggested that
political _justifications_ for raving are sometimes given due to the
feeling of guilt we are all raised w/ in this culture. raves work in
england, in germany, in the u.s. ... as raves, but not as a political
forum. (you must have missed some of the thread of this conversation.
nobody is saying that raves don't work, aren't fun...whatever.)

In my usual theme of always going to Mexican food, I would like to
recommend:

Wednesday Noon till 1:00 or so...

El Torito - In Santa Clara
101 N or S
Exit Great America (aka Bowers)
Go West (that's right if you're from the North, and left if you're from
the South)
Right on Augustine
Right on Lakeside Drive
2950 Lakeside Drive (just around bend on left side)
Total Driving Time once off freeway is less than 2 minutes!
408-727-4426

Your meal should run about $8.00-12.00, but cheaper plates are available.

I'd love to see you all there... and if you show, I'll tell the story
behind my last post.

;)

Reservation is for Andy or SFR

And finally... why Wednesday?  Because:

a.	I miss Branka, who can never make it on Tuesday.
b.	It's hump day, and I'd rather be with you all.
c.	It doesn't start with a T.
d.	I don't think my jaws will be fully unclenched until Wednesday,
and it's damn hard to eat those free chips with lockjaw.

RSVP if you can, so I know if I should change the size of the reservation
at 408-435-5259.  Also, if you only get an hour for lunch, we can order
for you, and you just arrive to your hot steaming plate.  Because that's
how much we care...

Peace,
AndyW

p.s.	They're opening a new Indian food place near my work, but they're
not open yet... next time I promise it won't be Mexican.

What i've heard is that it was the switch from psychedelics to speed that
killed it - same as the first raving "peak", circa '91-92 ... whatever -
any movement based primarily on pleasure & desire isn't going to last
anyway - but Rave Culture is something deeper - the resurfacing of the
ancient ways in a new context - what Camille Paglia, Starhawk, etc. have
written about many times - more later ....

hi everybody

ben and iris are unsubscribing because we're moving on to berkeley to
a computer-less household and although i'll be checking my mail as
often as i can (afford it), maybe every 2 or 3 days, i won't be able
to handle 600 or 700 messages when i have to pay $7/hour for internet
access.

if anybody is going to spiral tribe or has any info about it (esp. the
free one on the weekend, if it's happenning) please cc your posts to
me (or any other interesting stuff - like the yosemite discussion and
updates, please)

hope to see you all around (we'll still be here until august 5th)

I think it was more cops with battons, guns and attck dogs, the FBI and 
various other state-run instituitions than it was psychedelia that 
destroyed the movement...  and then went about reprogramming the youth of 
the next generation to think that was not how it happened...

I have not been home for a while but I heard Coney Island High and DJ   
Spooky and company's traveling party which I heard sometimes appears at   
the Knitting Factory (I think it is called something like SOundlab).  I   
heard Expo can be good (if it still open) as well if very unfriendly at   
times.  But the fact of the matter is Giuliani has been after many of the   
clubs and shutting them down by slapping them with selling pot.  They   
open up again but they have to do it in underground locations.  Best bet   
is to go to one of the before mentioned clubs and chat up a club kid.  By   
the way, Fez is a great acid jazz club that is always a rocking time.

I understand the impuldse about small towns-but cities are capable of   
small town feeling-they are called "neighborhoods" places where people   
could walk .6 mi in any direction, get anything they needed, while   
running into their neighbor walking a dog......i have lived in both biug   
cities and small towns...i personally felt more lonely in the small towns   
becuse i ran into an extreme amount of Xenophobia on top of the fact that   
the only real social avenues to get into the VERY close knit social   
fabric of the town was the church and the AMerican Lesion, and various   
other clubs (like the Elks or the MAsons) or the hunting lodge.  Yes,   
small towns can be great but their defintion of community can be very   
exclusive....plus, with the advent of the supremacy of the car...the   
chance meetings of walking into your neighbor are quite lessened...

I love cities like S.F. for the chance meetings that can occur and the   
fact that what I am interested in and what hooks me up with people can   
not normally be found in small town America (at least from my various   
experiences).....community can be found in many ways...i personally feel   
lonelier in the country because i am an urban person....some people feel   
lonely at a rave because they don't like the drugs, they think everybody   
is in their own drug world and they feel excluded,etc....what I think is   
key is finding those things which interest you and link you with other   
people and not being afraid...i knew all my neighbors in New York City   
becuse we all walked are dogs together, got involved with the   
neighborhood assoc. and the tenant group...though we were all very   
different we felt it was all in our common interest to be involved...the   
small towns I have been in everyone preferred to stay walled in their   
respective familial enclaves...it was very hard to be accepted as a   
minority and outsider even though the house I moved into had been owned   
by our family for ten years at that point..

community has to be defined by the values of the society and whether city   
or country, if people are going to be protective and do not see it in   
their common interest to get together they won't ....suburbia exists to a   
great part because people bought the myth that the detached single family   
dwelling which afforded privacy was a great way to bring up a family anf   
offer security (plus a way out of increasingly diverse aka minority   
cities).

IMHO

Since what you said interests me I thought I'd make a comment and
express an opinion....(or two ;-)

 Although it might feel like that I really don't think so.... what MOST
people feel (although I can't speak for you) is :

  1) the mind expansiveness of psychedelic drug use (see 60's movement)
    which if it doesn't go beyond "just" taking more drugs leads
    nowhere (see R. Alpert aka Ram Dass)
  2) COMMUNITY!!!  Cities ABSOLUTELY SUCK and SUCK bigtime in their
    community - they DON't have it and it feels lonely!! Pure and
simple.
    Most of my life I've lived in small towns ie under 10,000 people.
    There you know your neighbors etc. Everytime you go shopping you
    meet friends... everytime you do business you meet friends....
    You can leave your doors open...  You know 1000+ people and
    you can share....
    Live with 4000 people and you know 2000 people.... live with
    6 million and you're lucky if you know 12 (at least well)...
    see my point?

  What you are feeling here is community... like going down to the local
  market and really talking to the people there, talking to the clerks,
  having them help you because they actually know you... actually
"knowing"
  people when you go somewhere.....
   

  So for an experiment: go to Safeway... pay attention to your time
there...
  How many people do you talk to? How many people do you share something
  with? etc...
  Now consider how nice it is to go to a rave and start meeting lots of
  people who actually want to see you, talk to you etc.  Feels good
  doesn't it!
  Now go to a club... Well they've got lights and music JUST LIKE a rave
  don't they?  But notice how lonely it is because people aren't
sharing.
    

  So raves aren't special because of lights or music are they? CLubs
have
  that and they aren't special... so I'm not a believer that what
  makes raves special is the "music".... It's the sense of community....
  It's the sharing... It's the fact that the DJ's who play the music
  actually hang out and are part of the community... which feeds back
  and causes you to like their music even more because you know them
  etc.....

>

  You actually need "community".... some people get it at their local
   church... some people hang out with the new age, yoga whatever
groups...
  some people hang out at schools... and some people hang out at
raves...
  but without the sense of community or "belonging" life is pretty
lonely...

  All these negative things you read about are MOST often (but not
always)
products of large cities with breakdown of community... Jack the Ripper
normally happens in big cities.... bank robbers, drive by shootings
etc...
gang violence etc... these are the products of big cities...

 Of course small towns are NOT utopia... people sometimes go bonkers and
shoot their family... bad things happen... but bad things happen at
these
wonderful raves too.... just not as often in small towns....

  My relatives in small town WV could never understand all the negative
things they read about in the papers... it really wasn't a part of
their world....

  You might really like living in a small town like Bodega Bay or
someplace
where you actually "knew" people around you.... I guess what I am saying
is that I don't believe raves are going to change the world... they are
just helping you discover how much it sucks to live in a world without
community (which is the way of life in big cities and always was, even
hundreds of years ago)....

  SO people living in small towns across the world already are
"changed"...
they don't need the rave movement to teach them what they already
know...
living in community is the most positive way to live.... we (in the
large cities) need raves to give us a community to hang out in....

 Just my opinion,

 Mike

	Um, who told you this?  Who died because of psychedelics?  Remember Jim, 
Jimi and Janis...  Junk, reds, and alcohol is more like it.  Mostly the alcohol.

PS of course there are rumors of the CIA distributing bad "orange sunshine", but 
that couldn't be true, could it.

Adventures _in.the.beginning_
with stars:
Jer
Aaron
George
Krissy
Euginia
Macadio
Vertigo
AdamG
Todd Manley
Tony (aka Deepfog)
and many many more!!

ok... started out friday night with tons of stuff to do before the
party... pickin' up crap, buying stuff, and stuff and stuff. =) no sleep
for me. Woowoo it's Saturday... day of the party, let's go! 7:30 am, I
get on the move, get everyone together and all head down to meet up at
City E down in Santa Clara. We get outta there with the whole crew and
move out to Santa Cruz to set-up. Finally get to the day party location
around 1ish and start to set up, but dun dun dunnnnnn.... beach patrol
shows up. Let me tell you guys something.... beach patrol sux!!! Now the
adventure begins. We drive all up and down highway 1 with a shit load of
people running from beach patrol, but we out smart 'em and head over to
our forest location to set up for the night party. *BOOM* the place is
locked up and no trespassing signs everywhere. Now check this out....
we've been scoping the place for a week, and like 3 hours before we went
there to set up, we checked it, and it was exactly how we left it. In
between the hours that we checked it and went to set up, someone locked
the place up. *beep beep* *beep beep* pagers go off. Aaron and I check
our voice mails, mine said "are you guys through yet?", Aaron's,
"DENIED!!! you guys will never throw your party!". Seems as if we have
someone trying to stop us. Guess they didn't quite know who they were
dealing with! I do NOT give up, and I do NOT fail, especially when there
were so so many people planning to come out at night! it's about 6pm
now, so we send everyone to hang out at davenport while we take care of
business. 5 of us go all over the place to find another location as
special as the forest location that got popped, but no luck. It's
10pm... time to use the back up location. We go back to davenport and
pick up the 50 or so people there and head on outta there. We way north
of davenport and set up. The crew kicked ass.. they got the sound going
in 30 mins. We send 3 girls down to 7-11 in santa cruz for a map point.
We needed the map point so that our back up wouldn't get busted. Whoever
was screwing with us was checking the VM and tippin off the cops and
beach patrol. 7-11 lasted about 45 mins till it got busted, so the girls
started bouncing all over the place, 5 places in total, where they ended
up in Safeway. hehe our last voice mail said, "go to safeway, go in
safeway, look for 3 girls walking around, ask them for directions." =)
well we pulled it off..... 500 smiling faces out there... awesome
lighting and sound (thanx ari, and the other jeremy who brought the
lights). and it went off from 10:30pm till 8:30 in the morning. Too bad
I missed so much of it though =( I fell asleep hehe. Woke up to Aaron
spinning hardcore at 8am and people still dancing. we clean up and get
outta there.

I'm still tired so I missed a lot of stuff and stuff.

thanx to everyone who came out and sorry to those that couldn't make it
or find it.
special thanx to montery jeremy for working the entrance forever =)
sorry man. thanx to bao for doing that too... thanx to all the dj's who
played and made it out there (anonymous, pistachio, macadio, anakin,
vertigo, li, marty) I fell asleep but I think deepfog spun too.... thanx
to the djs for helping out so so much too! thanx to everyone who helped
clean up. thanx for not making fires and throwing up tents =) thanx to
anyone I missed. and if I did, I'm sorry... i'm just soooo tired hehe.

more on all this later.

love you guys!!!!!!!!! jer - @spire

ps. have faith in us... I know a lot of you didn't come out when you
heard the day party got busted, but we will never ever disappoint, and I
promise you guys that!

till next time, @spire

You sure that it's El Toritos and not Pedros. The directions look like
Pedros, but I could be wrong.

I was wrong, there is an El Toritos there... So you all should goto El
Toritos on Weds and NOT Pedros.

Hello all.  I don't post very often, but I have been a long time member of SFR.  I was off the list for a while and have just recently resubscribed so I wanted to say HI to all of you I know and HI to all that I don't know.

I would like to talk about Music and Money.  If you havnt noticed lately, the music we all hold so dear to our hearts is now getting a lot of attention.  I havnt really decided if this is a good or a bad thing.  Recently, My brother's band, SmashMouth, got a major record deal with Interscope Records.  Their music is your typical KOME 'Alternative Rock'.  And now they are all over the radio, all over the country, with a video soon to be on MTV.  What is so strange about this, is I've been listening to my bro write killer music for years.  But nobody knew, except for the local San Jose music scene that would go out and watch them play.  Now, the same songs that they were playing a year or two ago are all over the radio and everybody loves them.   Why?  Because there is a whole bunch of money behind the band.    I am not saying this is a bad thing.  My bro and all the members of the band are living their dream.  They have accomplished something that doesn't happen to very many people, and they are doing what they love to do.  

OK, lets compare this to techno music (I'm using the word 'techno' as a global music genre term, go ahead and substitute it with house, D&B, ambient, whatever) .  Orbital, Chemical Bro's, Orb, Prodigy, etc.....have all been writing killer music for years (well, maybe with the exception of the Chemical Bro's..).  And they are now finally getting noticed.  Why?  You guessed it.   Some suit wearing exec. in a 20th story office building in LA can make allot of money off of this 'electronica' music.   What really sucks about this, is  for every one artist that gets noticed, there are a hundred that are writing music that blows the Chem Bro's & Prodigy away.  I have friends that live down the street from me that are writing the most innovative music I've ever heard.  But they cant release it because they don't have the money or resources to do so.

I guess you can say I am feeling a little bitter toward the music industry.  It pains me to see very talented artists getting stepped on, while the ones that are 'appealing to the masses' are looked up to.  It just reconfirms my belief that the world, and this country especially, is ruled by money.  Wouldn't it be so much nicer if money was outlawed and the world went back to the trade and barter system?? 

Just a thought.

Peace,

Dear SF Raves~

Yes the party did go off, and jer no worries about working the the cars for 2
and a 1/2 hrs. just remember my party is Sept. 20th. First i want to say how
did that many people eventually show up at the beach. It was amazing, the
vibe was great for it being so dark. I FINALLY got to hear Macadio spin out
at a party, boy that little man spins some hard shit. I havent heard any
thing that hard in some time, it was refresshing. I don't want to leave out
anyone, deepfog was great in the morning, along with vertigo, anakin set. i
was also impressed with anonymous, i've never heard him before he was quite
good. sowee this is such a short review but i've got a planning meeting to go
to.for my party. 

remember ASR Productions Presents *Play Nice*

the 60's were just a preview..

the seed was planted and now in the 90's it is sprouting.

will we nurture it or let it wither away....

everyday we have choices...

to make our little section of the world better or worse...

do you smile at the stranger or ignor them....

do you look at how you are different or how you are alike...

do you judge or accept...

do you let things remain as they are or  do you try to 
make things better...or at least try to find ways to do so...

do you love or hate...

do you buy just one blowpop or do you buy an extra one for 
someone feeling gloomy...

You just have to wait for the technology to improve.  Once the net gets
fast enough, anybody will be able to have worldwide distrobution of their
music without needing any record company or distributer to help them out.

You will probably have big databases of artists that cross reference them
to their styles.  Imagine a search engine where you say "Goa trance with
breakbeats, 132 BPM, no 303's"... and have 14 different tracks pop
up from artist's servers around the world... hear a snippit of all of
them and download those you want.

The recording industry is a dying beast... well, there will probably always
be pop music and cute girls who hook up with talented producers who do
happy sing-along tracks like spice girls... but I think technology will outpace
the record company's ability to successfully sell electronic dance music.

*** The trick is mainly this.  There are people that want to make money
making music and there are those that like making music for music's sake...
The extremely few are people that are able to both make the music THEY
like as well as making it a kind of music that appeals to the masses.   I
guess that's why you see some bands that try to appeal to various audiences
(I.E. Monacos' new CD) and the few that play THIER music ad fu*k the rest
(like The Dwarves)...***

>I guess you can say I am feeling a little bitter toward the music
>industry.  It pains me to see very talented artists getting stepped on,
>while the ones that are 'appealing to the masses' are looked up to.

*** There are always others out there that try to make music for musics'
sake and create thier own scene.  Look @ our own underground.  Aspire,
Pacific, SPAZ, ARM, FTT (to an extent) and the various other sound systems
(ours included) that eat the costs and let us dance and have a great
time... free of charge.  ***

Just my reality,

Oh boy...my first working monday after a weekend of partying...ug...I 
feel like hell *8^)...

	Anyway, after taking last weekend off ( something wich I should
probably do more often :P ) I was back in the scene for yet another
eventful sfraves weekend. I started it off just finishing setting up my
sound system and was really excited to go watch some good DJ's this
weekend, continuing this really cool learning proccess. Anyway, friday
night...1015. This didn't really do it for me. I was told later on Sunday
never to go there when there wasn't a big name DJ spinning and now that I
think about it they're probably right. The music wasn't hoorible, but it
didn't quite go off. Once a DJ started going off it felt like about five
minutes later they would fall flat, pretty much losing my interest. 
Besides the music, I gotta say that the vibe was pretty non-exsistant. I
don't know, maybe I needed to throw down a few beers before I could have
felt it, but I really wasn't in the mood. 

And then Saturday came and the crew from Aspire saved the day! :)

Luckily I didn't plan on going during the daytime so my friends and I 
didn't have to deal with all the annoyances that went on earlier. We got 
there around 11:30 and it was just started to go off!

The music:
Had to be some of the best I've heard in a while! FINALLY got to see 
Macadio spin again...Man, you f-inkg WENT OFF! posing up there like some 
superstar...hehe...love the music! And as for the rest, everyone..went 
off! I think Sat night was the most I've ever danced at a rave yet. Oh 
yeah...for some reason the sound just sounded more awsome and powerful 
the usual...hrrmmm...I wonder why ;)

The vibe:
Living up in Santa Cruz over the past year I've been to just about every 
beach rave that's been thrown up there, and the vibe Sat night was by far 
the best out of any beach rave I've been yet. I did not see ONE  unhappy 
face!

Decorations:
Once again tops the beach rave list. The lights were sweet, and the 
location was prime!

In general:
This was simply an awsome rave, I can't wait for the next! When a beach 
rave is so good that I actually want to stay long enough to watch the 
daylioght slowly arrise, you know something special is goin down. Thanks 
guys!

Hugs to the XOR crew, and everyone else...you guys are AWSOME!

Staaaaay Coooool!

-Matt...the other one-

hello mark

I dont think it is money, after all that little piece of paper
is easier to carry around and trade than a pocket
full of apples or a pocket full of glowsticks.

I believe the problem is the focus that we put on money...
The idea that money is what life is all about is what needs
to be changed...and that can get pretty complicated.

   we had about 500 or so I think.... the beach by the sound was packed
back almost to the water and then we had people off to the sides
chillin'... I could be wrong... I don't think I'm very good at
guestimating # of people, but it was the biggest crowd I've ever seen on
a beach by far. =) and yes the dj's tore shit up! hehe first time
macadio got to spin a full set at a party for a couple months I think.
hehe man he tore it up too!

jer, you'll have to forward this to sfraves... I used my 5 times.
peace.jer!

well....in usual raver fashon we were lagging a bit.....so FF to about
midnight or so when we finally arrived @ the spot. I knew it would be a
great nite when I saw Jeremy (mercutio) helping out with the cars...=)
For a backup location, the crew had done a great job. The little "cove"
area we had was protected, and the ocean was right there. The path from
the cars wasn't long at all, and we were far enough from the road to not
be heard or noticed. (phew)

All of the DJs had great sets...the music was just epic....the speakers
were set up so that there was this one area right in the center where
you could get perfect stereo sound...it was rEally intense.  The crowd
grew and grew and there were so many happy people dancin away under the
stars...(and fog)....the visuals were extra special because they were
partly natural....the lights coming off the ocean were great..the
rainbow light hitting the water and luminating the mist was so cool. I
felt a really good vibe from a lot of people....everyone was so happy
the party was going off......the DJs were rippin it up...and we were
partyin' in the coolest spot! This really was a great party....I think
everyone there had a super time and felt the energy....there was still a
crowd of ppl dancin away at 8am.....nothing like terrorcore in the
morning to knock you senseless. WOW.....

I remember sitting out on this rock that was kinda in the water,
watching everyone dance and hang out....I was able to take in the whole
scene....it was just so great to see all these people out having a blast
at 6am on the beach......<<gush>>

can't even name everyone I saw there....so HI to you all! xtra thanks to
jer for sticking with it and pulling of a great party despite the odds.
YOU Rock!!  Anonymous, Vertigo, Li, Macadio, Deepfog, Anakin,
Marty....damn! you were all really good....everone put alot of energy
into their sets....and the crowd felt it....and gave it back!

Some hilights were....Anakin dancing himself into a hole....Vertigo
sleeping....again. Marty in a tie....Macadio blowing up the
circuts....again.....(that boy need more power!!!) Just about everone
smiling and vibing out all nite long. The location. The sound.....I
could go on and on...a huge shout out to EVERYONE!!

until next time.....

I resisted for like four days on this thread.

Now I must open my mouth and pull out...

>>>>Andy's Lame Rant on this Topic<<<<

The beats of the late fifties and early sixties were really onto
something, but it was more a reaction that an action.  They were about
fuck the confines of this Leave It To Beaver ideal little pink houses
world.  What can we do to turn this over?  Why do we hate the commies so
much if we all act more like their ideals than they do?

Then the hippies came.  From the dissarray of the beats, a common thread
was established.  People started expeirimenting with communal living, with
alternate lifestyle, with experiemnting with freedom not for the sake of
the experiment, but out of the firm belief that there was a better way.
These "ways" required lots of deviants who pioneered the various
disciplines.  Abbie Hoffman burned money and asked hard questions, Timothy
Leary and Ram Dass pushed the limits of perception, Allen Ginsberg tempted
literature, Bob Dylan twisted music into a new honest folk, literature was
cutting into the fray (it was after all the first salvo, echoing back from
the beats), and probably the most vocal was rock music.  These all rang
true with freedom, with misfit power, and a strange incling that with each
passing day we could take these ideas furthur (sic) and fashion a new
life from it.  We could plant a seed and bear a youth that understood a
new way (flower children).

With all of these fresh ideas, the hippies had what it took.  Many saw the
diversity as threatening and decided to work towards unifying the vibe
(all you need is love, give peace a change) while conflicting messages
came from the dissenters who had made this freedom possible (don't trust
anyone over thirty, spitting on vietnam vets).

Somewhere in this melee people got wise to the fact that a message had to
be put together.

Woodstock nation.

Star children from the black hole to salvation, citizen of the forest and
child of the woodstock nation...

As the fashion and entertainment industries were catching up to hippie
trend, the mentality was sick with dissent.  The ideological quilt of
diversity was pulling at it's own seams.

Mixed messages were being sent by groups like the Black Panthers, the
Yippies, the Communal Hippies, the New Age Reformists, and soon there were
only two types of people left...

Those who kept going and those who gave up.

The media, the same tool that the hippies had used to make themselves so
powerful, had turned the cameras on the real people, and America was
disgusted with what it saw.

Burnouts, venereal disease, bad trips, Altamont, violence, dissent, Kent
State, and an enraged group at the core of it all figuring out what could
be done.  

What does peace do when it has been beaten to it's knees?

This single dillema probably killed the movement in my opinion.  Most
people either bailed out and er... dropped right back in, tuned out
even harder or turned on to start movements that still go to this day.  
The inability to seperate hedonism, idealism and intellectual
and spiritual revolution created the stereotype we have till today of the
hippie.

Out of the core of all of this, suddenly bellbottoms and long hair become
the epitomy of fashion, and this amazing movement ends sickly with a
parody of itself.

Maybe a couple thousand people took CIA acid, but the threat of a team of
Men in Black was more dangerous than anything they could actually do.  The
paranoia, of Protestant guilt catching up with their lifestyles which many
of them did not even understand was too much bear.

Ask yourself if any of this sounds familiar...

Rave is about not having to defend or justify anything, it is living.  For
some of you, you will take what you can and walk away, and to some, you
will live it for a while and it will change you so that you live with it
forever.  Make that change and make it good.

There is nothing sicker than the face of those people who called
themselves hippies and then gave up their bellbottoms for Pierre Cardin
and BMWs later in the 80's.  If you live an honest life now, there's
nothing to hide ten, fifteen years from now.

Or maybe I just want something to type about.

I hope all of us remember what it's like to hug someone you just met, or
to dance like an idiot (albeit an inspired, beautiful idiot) because it
feels good. There is no shame in being yourself, and that means you, and
those all around us.

Therin lies beauty.  Be yourself, whatever that may be, however far it
takes you.

Now can we talk about some parties or something, or is this going to keep 
being a socialogical forum?

This has, unfortunately, always been the case. I've watched friends and
family "on the bleeding edge" of music get burned out for not having
the time, money, or recognition to follow their art. Or simply lose the
motivation to slog through a "day job" just so they can spend all night
in a recording studio and get dissed by the same mindset record execs
that thought the Beatles sucked back in the early 60's, before they got
signed. It's no wonder the artists that do make it have such ridiculous
primadonna attitudes -- it's just payback for the shit that they had to
live through before they got famous.

People just don't get it, until it's too late. And then the new art is
just treated like a fad and exploited/stripmined until the artform is
but a mockery of the original intent. And then it's time to struggle,
and move on to something new.

ANd then, a few years later, a big record company does a big commercial
push on a band with crappier songs, less musicality, and jumping on a
once-avant garde bandwagon a few years too late. THat's life. It sucks.

But let's not dwell on the negative :-)

On the other hand, when said musicians kill themselves or wind up in
insane asylums, or collecting garbage, or driving cabs... and by some 
miracle, they come back into recongition among the trainspotters...
then  you can always say, yeah, i knew so and so and saw them back when
they played in a small club. And point to a collection of potentially
rare albums that are now worth money to other trainspotters, even
though you picked them up for a few pennies when the record store was
trying to get rid of them so they could stock more of the current fad
of the time.

Besides, it's just so cool to have the rare pleasure of knowing some
group that no longer exists, because their genius was totally ignored
by record companies ... e.g. in the "pop" genre, the band "Big Starr"
(the Replacement's deification of Alex Chilton notwithstanding) ... or
in Funk, the group "Mandrill" or "The Fatback Band"...

On the bright side, at least with "electronica" becoming a reconizable
genre, those of us that have been tinkering w/ electronic music for
many years now at least have a label under which to describe the things
we waste large amounts of our time and money on, seemingly for no
professional or personal benefit whatsoever other than the acquisition
of a bunch of knowledge and techniques that most people find akin to
the joys of stamp collecting.

But at least with the fact that this kind of music is at least a
"genre", one may have hope for greater glory, or at least, to make a
few kids bug out to the beats, as opposed to covering their ears as
they flee from the awful noises coming from one's synths and samplers.

Please remember that just a few short years ago, people thought popular
music *HAD* to have a guitar player *AND* one or more vocalists (no
matter how painful and dissonant their crooning (e.g. Grateful
Dead))... when you think of that, you have to realize, we've come a
long way baby!

To: "sfraves" <sfraves@hyperreal.org>

Hello all.  I don't post very often, but I have been a long time member
of SFR.  I was off the list for a while and have just recently
resubscribed so I wanted to say HI to all of you I know and HI to all
that I don't know.

I would like to talk about Music and Money.  If you havnt noticed
lately, the music we all hold so dear to our hearts is now getting a
lot of attention.  I havnt really decided if this is a good or a bad
thing.  Recently, My brother's band, SmashMouth, got a major record
deal with Interscope Records.  Their music is your typical KOME
'Alternative Rock'.  And now they are all over the radio, all over the
country, with a video soon to be on MTV.  What is so strange about
this, is I've been listening to my bro write killer music for years. 
But nobody knew, except for the local San Jose music scene that would
go out and watch them play.  Now, the same songs that they were playing
a year or two ago are all over the radio and everybody loves them.  
Why?  Because there is a whole bunch of money behind the band.    I am
not saying this is a bad thing.  My bro and all the members of the band
are living their dream.  They have accomplished something that doesn't
happen to very many people, and they are doing what they love to do.  

OK, lets compare this to techno music (I'm using the word 'techno' as a
global music genre term, go ahead and substitute it with house, D&B,
ambient, whatever) .  Orbital, Chemical Bro's, Orb, Prodigy,
etc.....have all been writing killer music for years (well, maybe with
the exception of the Chemical Bro's..).  And they are now finally
getting noticed.  Why?  You guessed it.   Some suit wearing exec. in a
20th story office building in LA can make allot of money off of this
'electronica' music.   What really sucks about this, is  for every one
artist that gets noticed, there are a hundred that are writing music
that blows the Chem Bro's & Prodigy away.  I have friends that live
down the street from me that are writing the most innovative music I've
ever heard.  But they cant release it because they don't have the money
or resources to do so.

I guess you can say I am feeling a little bitter toward the music
industry.  It pains me to see very talented artists getting stepped on,
while the ones that are 'appealing to the masses' are looked up to.  It
just reconfirms my belief that the world, and this country especially,
is ruled by money.  Wouldn't it be so much nicer if money was outlawed
and the world went back to the trade and barter system?? 

Just a thought.

Peace,

for one, i don't think these countries place such an emphasis on _work_.
this is a combination of the protestant roots and a capitalist society.
don't europeans get ourtageously long vacations where we only get 2 weeks
per year? i can only speculate from my own personal experience, and that is
that europeans in general  party _way_ harder than your average joe
american. they have learned, somehow, to leave work at work, and to
concentrate on playing when it's play time. i just don't see that as a
prevalant thing here.

as far as fucked up cities go.... hmmmm. food for thought. i had always
attributed it to the weather (until i came here) - in comparing the great
lakes region, and the uk, where the weather sucks and the parties fly, to
tx, where (imo) the parties aren't all that.... well, the weather makes ppl
depressed, and maybe in the same way so do socio-economic problems, so ppl
feel the need to create an altered state of reality.... their own
controllable niche. hence the wild parties. just speculation tho!

For those who are interested, I'm in the process of putting together 
a deal with a local computer company who is setting up their server 
to put together a Real Audio server which would allow budding artists 
to hold Concerts and invite people from Music Magazines without them 
expending 500$ or more on a plane ticket just to hear you..

The time to the Real Audio server would be 'rented' or scheduled some 
way between those people who were interested..

If anyone is interested in this idea and would like to support my 
goal, I'd love to hear from you, and what kind of music you do etc...

I'll post something again once I have more information..

I think we should try to stake out some turf on the roof, sistren and
bredren.  I am so excited for tonight, I think that ULTRA is a TIGHT idea,
and after last week, and after these lads all get back to England, there
is no telling how much props we are going to get.

They will come.  With flowers in their hair.  Because we have fine herb,
and the BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE GONE JUNGLING.

Oh yes, this is indeed the Summer of Jungle in San Francisco, oh yes.
Turn or burn, rejoice, or learn.  there are beats inside the beats,
flatfoots, come jump up with us.

For all thsoe who have problems with dancing to jungle, I must say that
the Bukem style is most conducive.  Very airy, very brainy.  You will like
it BOOMBOOMBOOM folks!

PAX,
MAX

this lack of community is so prevalent now.... funny, i feel it less
actually now that i'm living here in sf - in tx, it was so bad. i always
felt like the jetsons, sort of - have my little isolated apt., get in the
isolated car and drive to my isolated office. at least here in a large
city, there _are_ neighborhoods - it's up to you to make them your
community. i actually do know the grocer on the corner, the ppl in my
bldg., the regular bums on the street.... a community doesn't just happen.
but you can make it happen, anywhere.

i really believe that if you act this way in your day-to-day affairs,
you'll begin to sense this all the time. talk to ppl. share. smile at
strangers. it comes from within - nobody is going to hand it to you. it's
obviously easier at a rave where this sort of thing is the norm, but you
can spread this feeling into your daily existence.

and i should add - this you sensed at your _first_ rave. one, ecstacy
really amplifies these feelings. _hugely_. and when a whole group is
feelings these things amplified - what a way to create an instant
community. two - and there was some discussion of this earlier - you do
come down off the pink cloud eventually. it is so funny to see ppl for the
first time on e - they love _everybody_. i don't feel like getting into it,
but as much as i love raves, there is an awful lot of real life going on
within as well. cliques, crime, etc.

this is a human need - a need for connection. read jane jacobs on urban
sociology. you can get this both in and out of raves. this list even is a
community. but i can't stress enough that if you walk outside and meet your
neighbors, the local vendors, you'll get this sense at home too. and that's
where it's so important. if indeed you want to use your raving experience
to 'better mankind' - get out and join your community. make yourself known.
not only will it make your life more pleasant, it'll probably be safer as
well.

see, the thing is, big cities have small towns - called neighborhoods -
within them. and (yawn) this is where the change will happen. it won't
happen if we wall ourselves off in our little rave community.

not so. maybe in your neighborhood. again, read jane jacobs. visit some
neighborhoods that have strong community networks. they really do exist. sf
is a fabulous city in this way - not like some other places where
everything is so sprawled out. you have neighbors. you have community. it's
up to you to utilize it.

and i disagree. ;) maybe if you're viewing a community as a place where
everyone has the same likes/dislikes, i suppose. but what a boring
community that would be. the first key to a vibrant community is diversity.
celebrate it.

cheers - e. :)

And what is up with Jonathan Wishnev on the turntables???

At my party on Friday night he pulled some pioneering tricks out of his
sack.  He is the very first RETRO techno DJ that I've ever heard, OR heard
of.  Everyone else is manically zooming to the record store for the brandest
newest, hottest off the pressest, and Jonathan's digging for the oldest!

I've heard of DJ's playing an old rave song now and again, but kicking 'em
for an hour +?   Salud to Jonathan for clever back-assward thinking.

And what is up with the kill tricks at the end of your set, Jon?   Flicking
the Line Switch like Carlos on crack!

Very chancey.
I like it, a lot.

went this past Sat.  Me pal Luke and I caught kinda a bad vibe when we
cruised up to the place cos it looked like they had a ton of security for a
kinda small event and a lot of colors were being flashed by the crowd that
waz lining up.  I usually dig much more plurry events than the sorta
breakdancing set that seemed to be the majority here.  But the lineup waz
jest too grt ta miss, so we checked it out.  Good thing, too, the muzaq waz
phat!!!  Jeno and DJ Ghost were incredible as waz everyone else.  Jeno
fully amazes me, since I've now heard him bust some incredible sets of
Trance, Underground and Breakbeat.  The sets usually switched between some
trance or goa, to breakbeat, tekstep and other D & B.  Ghost even managed
to perfectly mix a Cypress Hill tune with the rest of his set!  I met two
grt gals that were there sober, as I always am, and saw one SFR laminate,
tho the gal, Christi wasn't a member.  Anyway, props to Ghosttribe, tho the
water could have been definent'y cheaper, if not free!  Take care...

> I dont think it is money ...

	I'd have to agree. It's not primarily money that's the issue.
It's *fame*, or *celebrity*. Basically, what it boils down to for the
most music buyers is that they're not going to buy something they've
never heard (or heard of). That means that bands have to become famous i
to sell records. And for labels it comes down to "if we pay the money
to get this band on the radio/MTV, how many people are going to buy it."
And the result is that most bands have an average sound that appeals to
the average buyer.

	One of the things that's cool about the techno scene is that
people are more interested in what they *haven't* heard. I'm not hold-
ing my breath waiting for the major labels to figure out how to deal
with that.

	Or did you guys all run out & buy the chemical bros & prodigy
records already?

   we had about 500 or so I think.... the beach by the sound was packed
back almost to the water and then we had people off to the sides
chillin'... I could be wrong... I don't think I'm very good at
guestimating # of people, but it was the biggest crowd I've ever seen on
a beach by far. =) and yes the dj's tore shit up! hehe first time
macadio got to spin a full set at a party for a couple months I think.
hehe man he tore it up too!

jer, you'll have to forward this to sfraves... I used my 5 times.

Superbrian, are you lads going to be right stage right of the DJ's again?

Or did you work out some Popemobile thang?  And did the ISDN line get put
in, or do you need me to, uh, have somebody take care of it for you?

I guess I might as well be the one to make up an alternate meeting place,
since the scene around Brian is so crazy, although yall really should tell
him how fresh a man he is for providing us with free 6 hour long mixtapes
VIA THE INTERNET.

What if I do two things:
1) I will put a pad of paper and a couple pens on that bar up by the
phones on the roof, so that we can like B kewl graf Writurz N shEEit,
d00d.  Or like, connive up on some meeting points, and secret activities,
and leave notes about who the Interpol agents are.

2) Yo, what if we all just meet at that Roofies Bar at say 11:30, 12:30
and again at 1:30?  The reason for this of course, is that speaking for
myself here,  you would have had to know some pretty intricate techniques
to get me off the floor last Monday, and time and other such vectors are
completely lost on me at the hands of the drum and the bass.

I read an interview in the San Fran Examiner a few weeks ago with Douglas
Rushkoff and he expressed in a few words what I've been trying to tell my
parents for years--why we go to raves . . .

"I wanted to focus on rave culture as a milieu becuase that is where I see
most of the progressively evolutionary conscious forms of spirituality
today.  It is a place where science, technology, global culture and youth
culture meet as a spiritual pagan ritual.

"It is the closest thing to a religious experience that I have ever had.
There is a magic moment that can happen at a rave--at 2 or 3 in the
morining, when everyone is dancing, you experience a feeling of collective
organism [orgasm?], and I think people who have had that experience see the
world differently afterward.  They don't see the world made up of
individuals vying for power, but rather they see it as one throbbing thing."

Well put, Doug!

back in the "good 'ol days", record companies used to be owned and run by
musicians(gee- what an unusual concept). all types of bands could, and would,
get signed. the emphasis was on musical creativity and deversification. 
  unfortunately, the record companies started losing money. soooooooo- along
came the suits, who took over the record companies and turned them into the
money making, bubble-gum music producing-( i know, there are many
exceptions)-entities that they are today. they don't give a rats ass if the
band has talent or not-all they see when they look at a band is dollar signs.
the more dollar signs they see, the better chance the band has of getting
signed. what else can one expect of a bunch of lawyers put in charge of
art!?!

If I were to be stuck on a deserted island for the rest of my life, this 
tape would definitely be the one to accompany me. Science drops some of 
the nastiest beats, with some of the smoothest, well-thought-out mixes 
I've heard in a long time.
	His tracks pile up nastier and thicker one by one -- 
starting off with optical's eerie "to shape the future" and thus throws us 
into the mix on the darkside with masta ak,decoder, tech itch, ed rush, 
zenith 
and roni size to name a few..  speaking of roni size, big massive ups to 
science for throwing NEW FORMS in the beginning of the flip side, with 
some beautifully intelligent and strong lyrics.. 
I swear to god this shit is DOPE!
the second side rocks my ass even more than the first -- sample warfare 
-- warped basslines beyond beleif -- I couldn't ask for anything more.
	So if you're out, or you run into Alex Ward aka SCIENCE anywhere, 
pick up one of his tapes -- it's well worth your while.. Shit it's more 
than worth your while, it's your obligation and duty as a true junglist 
to pick up this tape and listen to it from start to finish over and over 
again to give mad respect and props to the man.
I shit you not.
-+- looking forward to the day she can sit on a deserted island and step 
all the day long -+-

nStuff..


 I was pretty sorry I didn't show up to the B))m n party this weekend.  
=[:. ..
 I went to my friend Wayne's party though. And it's not every week that
yout bestest buddy for 10 years throws alittle HOUSE party.

 I had a few beers, and guess what? I spun, spun sugar! We had the phat DJ
booth going on, with my phat mixer ofcourse. I have very little records
but. I really enjoyed using everyone else's.. But check it! I was ripping
it up!  =]:.. It is so much fun when something truly "clicks" in. I pretty
much got the HOUSE tunes que-ing up phat! I have full on confidence that,
when I like..GET SOME DAMN RECORDS! I will be ready to get all of you going
too! Which would bring me great joy no doubt. I rules when you don't have
to worry about a record running to it's end.
 My que-ing has gotten to where, I can throw down a beat matched mix that
lasts for a minute or so, and still get both records to break at the same
time. And I am proud of myself.! Damnit!! Oh.. Well slap me on the back or
something!! Just kidding..

But I gotta go. Haven't cleaned my mail box since thursday or something.

Whens the next party nStuff?


Night,
Jeff

Hey all,
 I had time to scribble a brief messageand still without the time to go
into any great detail about my adventures towards the promised land, I
thought I might express some pent-up frustrations I have with stuckedness.
It has been over a month since our planned departure date and we have been
to the Pacific and back... You may ask; why? So many worldly possessions...
"necessities"? Even though I have successfully gotten rid of about half of
my stuff... There is still so much of it to pack and move... And the
remaining bits of improvements on the house, which I must soon sell... Not
to be a downer or anything, but sometimes, I simply feel like I'm stuck...
I try to get things done, without straining too much or slacking, either...
But things NEVER go as planned and it can be frustrating... especially hard
when leaving a great bunch of people and  looking forward to joining an
even greater number of good people, only to be held captive, by the tasks I
set for myself... Ah,well, I suppose that everything happens as it is
supposed to... And everything is just "doin' it's thing". Well, We plan to
leave tommorrow... I hope we can pull it off. :)

Love going out to alla ya,
 m

Yeah, what about last year at HomeBase when he dropped "Brass Monkey" to open up his set?

A good dj in my opinion is one that plays a set that combines the new, old, and some current albums.

He/She tells a story within the set that expresses the feelings of how they're feeling at that moment.

Whether it'd be the opener, the closer, the dj that's playing in between...

Saturday 12.7.97 Berlin Love Parade,



 Well folks, I survived another Love Parade and haven't slept in
three days.  The parade this year was different from last, somewhat worse,
but ohhhhh, all those parties afterwards!  Unfortunately, I was too
stressed out from school to go to all of them :(
 Okay, apparently, the numbers of people for this year is 1-1.5
million participants.  Advertisers and media folks here love to use the
term "ravers" to describe everyone, but that is far from the truth. I
would say 1/4 of the crowd were clubbers, 1/4 "normalos", 1/4 vendors, 1/4
random "Fussball jerks", and some actual ravers mixed in between.  Don't
get me wrong, there were really nice people there overall, but there was
always the exception (European soccer fans are the worst).
 The route this year started at Ernst Reuter Platz again (same as
last year), but continued on past the Siegesaule (big upside down Mariachi
type monument in the middle of the Tiergarten/park) towards Brandenburg
Gate, and circled back towards the Siegesaule.  The parade started at
14:00 and lasted till probably midnight or past (I believe there was a
free open air at the Siegesaule endpoint again).  The logistics were
different this year in that instead of having all the wagens (roughly 40?
The sign-up fee is a purported 4,000 DM to 40,000 DM; can't verify it
either way) following each other, there were three-wagen groups that were
separated 'bout 15 minutes from each other; total LAG!  As the last wagens
started coming up, people were already making a mass exodus towards other
places. The most disturbing thing, is the rampant commercialization of the
whole event.  Cars had bigger "FILA", "PIONEER", "MARLBORRO", etc. signs
than club identification tags.  I just didn't feel comfortable worshipping
the "FILA" wagen as compared to the let's say, Trance truck, etc.; it _is_
about the music, afterall.
 Each year the parade gets worse and worse; I'm afraid of what it
would be like next year.  Believe it or not, the parade started off quite
small years ago as a demonstration against descrimination, racism, sexism,
destroying the environment, etc. (basically PLUR-y type things), but has
lost much of its original purpose.  It should be called the Skin Parade
and meant to celebrate consumer culture and the massive amounts of litter
that 1 million people produce.
 There is a "Hate Parade" which started off as a counter-demo
against the commercialization of the parade (same time, same day,
different location) plus other stuff, but I missed it, and I don't
particulary like Gabba or Hardcore that much.  
 Enough of the baggin', here are the good points:

Free open-air at the end
Chillin' in the Tiergarten
Meeting old comrades
Hangin' with friends
Making new contacts
The parties afterwards
Perfect weather
All the beautiful people 

 My recommendation is: go see the start if you really want to (it
will be crushingly uncomfy), set up home base at the Siegesaule, bring
food and _alot_ of water (extortionist prices), return to Ernst Reuter
Platz at roughly 22:00 for an excellent mini-party, and lastly, friends
are the best way to go, and try to avoid the massives afterwards if
possible (they are a rip).  The absolute BEST GOA FESTIVAV/RAVE was
"Nation of Godwana" with this line-up: Sven Dohse, Tsuyoshi Suzuki, Mark
Allen, Mahasukha, Bimmel, The Chemist, Bass Dee, Thsa'ba, & Rolle.  
Too bad SF's own Goa Gil was spinning at a different venue.  My friend
Clare said it was held outside the city limits (free shuttle service) and
was held in a field within endless fields, and was comparable to Burning
Man.  She also swears by Tsuyoshi Suzuki, and apparently, he is coming to
San Francisco sometime this August, don't miss him--unless you are at
Burning Man, that is!
 The best guide to the scene and all the parties is in "Flyer".  It
is free and the size of a flyer (but a small booklet), a bit hard to find,
but all the cool places have it; published every three weeks.

 Well, that's it folks, I am presently in the middle of papers
(Germans apparently don't write their term-papers till the end of the
semester), and my next conquest (hopefully) will be New York City in seven
days.  I will be back in August and hope to meet some of you Net-izens
then....

Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.org

hello happy people...

i am up at 2am cause i've been reflecting on the great weekend i've had.
just.jer threw a great party this weekend.  my opinion is that anyone that
would cut his methods down of how he organized this event are simply
jealous because they maybe don't have the same type of drive and motivation
that jeremy does.  @spire went off.

anyway, the reason for my email...

I started Aware Environments to promote aware environments.  Are you with
me?  Part of Aware Environments is about throwing really high quality raves
that cost money to go to, but make you feel like you've spent your money in
the right place.  Now I've just started throwing them and not everything
has been perfect, but bear with me.  Part of my reason for taking a small
breather from throwing a party is so that I can singlehandedly go through
each step and learn what i think should and should not happen.

Another aspect of my business is promoting the use of naturally based
consumer products and natural herb supplements for promting longevity of
the mind, body and spirit.  I'm not a doctor and I don't have any degrees
in nutrition, but I strive to teach based upon what I have learned.  If I
don't know the answer to something, I will tell you rather than try to make
up something out of thin air just to get you to buy my products.

I don't have employees, only business associates that are independent of
me.  I don't plan on having employees at all, except in some special cases
where I might throw a large party (this would not be a Warmth party,
because Warmth is Spencer's baby and that's his decision on what he wants
to do with it) and need to hire people, but that's only like a one time
deal.  I work most closely with people that are willing to invest in
themselves and in their future. Because we can't throw big fat parties on a
regular basis if we're constantly worrying about whether or not our next
paycheck is going to cover the next phone bill or whatver may be pending.

I hope there are not too many people offended by this blatant self-promo of
my business, but a lot of you have asked me what I do, and, well this is
basically it.  I'm always looking for new people to hook up with that can
either be a customer of my products and services or for us to make some
kind of exchange that doesn't involve money at all.  Eventually I would
like to know so many people that I would never have to set foot in a store
again, because I can call so-and-so for this thing and so-and-so because
she sells insurance or whatever.

If you are curious and would like more detailed info about the products and
services I can offer you or think you would like to do something like this
yourself, please email me privately and we'll talk.  I love meeting new
people, and email is a really great way to do this.  Again, I hope I'm not
stepping on anyone's boundaries because of this.  But really.  the SFR
people I have met of late have been some of the most top quality open
minded people that i have met since i have been raving since 1991.

i love you all and i hope to hear from some of you in private.  it's up to
you.  :]

Love, dEEpfog
PS-  Call the Aware Environments private bat line to hear my favorite song
of the week!  415.595.3427

Hi everyone,

I want to take a second to tell you about my night! :)

I drove to the city around 10:45 to pick up Beth and a friend of hers.
Then we cruised down to VSF and got in line. We were afraid that there
wasn't going to be any room left inside, or if there was that we'd be
sardines. Time passed and pretty soon we were inside. The first thing I
noticed was that there were tons of people from all walks of life. It was
pretty interesting. Sometimes when you are so into an artist you forget
about all the other peopel who are also into him/her. Moments later we
were in the main room dancing to DJ BLAME. It was SUPER HOT in there and
was totally uncomfortable. :( After about 30 minutes we had to go to get
some air! So we walked up to the roof and chilled for a bit. A few moments
before we went upstairs I recognized a familiar face that lives on the
wallpaper of the server I manage work... LTJ BUKEM! And only a few people
were recognizing him. I couldn't resist so I walked up to him and
introduced myself. I told him how much I enjoy his music and that I've
introduced a lot of friends to it. I shook his hand and exchange smiles
with him. At about 1:45 I went down into the main room to prepare for a
real treat. Fifteen minutes later he was up there spinning some BEAUTIFUL
music. He's so calm and smooth. "Thanks, mate", where the words that left
his lips as I shook his hand. He has such a smooth and relaxed aura (sp?).
It was amazing... His set was fantastic. I loved how people cheered during
the phases. Unfortunately the power or something was going out and every
oonce in a while the decks would stop. But he just smiled and continued to
mix... and we all cheered in support of this extremely talented human
being.  His set ended at about 3:35 and a few of us shook his hand and
exchange smiles and words. I thanked him for the beautiful set and walked
to my car. It was definately worth getting 3 1/2 hours of sleep...!! :)

Hi to all the SFRAVERS I saw there... and Hi to all the ones I didn't!
Next time he comes around you've got to see him... ! This was the best $7
I've spent in my life.... I would have paid tons more to see him spin.

Props to Funky Tekno Tribe.

Well folks, last night was the last session of MAD and I must say that it
was one of the best times I had.  For as much as I wished I could've
watched LTJ Bukem, I must say that MAD rocked the house last night.  At
first it seemed kind of slow and lame with a small turnout (duhh, that's
what happens when you're the fifth or sixth person there.)  But within a
hour or so, it was going off.

I have to give PHAT props out to all the DJ's.  They did a great job. 
Joe Rice's set was incredibly good.  You know, last night was so awesome
that it has caused me to be in denial.  Could somebody explain to me why
there are no more MADs?  

Well, N E Ways, it was a great night.  All except for my injury I
sustained in my calf muscle from dancing too much.

See ya'll later.

P.S.-- Hey Byroni, dude, I saw Tiffany there last night.

That's a huge problem, because this is an industrialized society
based on commerce and free enterprise.  Our society (into which
we had the misfortune to be born) attacks us with that ideology
from every angle, trying to tell us that we WANT to be a part of
it, that it's good and fun to play the corporate games, step on and/or
ruin our neighbors in order to advance ourselves (which really
means in order to make someone else more wealthy), and to die
with the most toys.  We live in a sick society, and it's not going to
get well until there is some sort of significant change in our systems
of government and commerce, which are so often hand-in-hand.

There it is,
Eric

well, to sum things up...last night was magical...
not only were there all walks of life @ ULTRA to see the Logical
Progression Tour (LTJ Bukem, DJ Blame, MC Conrad, DRS), but
there was a definite mystical energy in the air....
to those of you who couldn't make it last night, shame on you...
as i told many of my friends there "this is history in the making".
i was in sheer awe to see one of the pioneers of modern drum & bass
that i couldn't resist to press palms wid da man dey call Bukem...
a friend who frequents club VSF on friday nights remarked that he
has never seen the place so jam packed with people, and of all
things on a Monday night!
yes it was like a sauna, yes there were TOO many peeps, and yes
there were hundreds of smiles all united under one thing, the music...
much props also goes out to FTT for managing to import such talented
artists to come out to San Francisco and perform for us...
however, i hope the numerous technical difficulties that was apparent
throughout the night didn't leave a bitter taste with the Logical
Progression
crew...
thanks again to Bukem, Blame, Conrad, and DRS for putting the widest smile
on my face last night...have a safe journey and hope to see you back in the
very
near future...

i agree with you jer, but...

i've found that karma actually works a lot faster than we might think.

the gods rewarded you with a party despite trying to ruin your night.  this
guy was on the negative emotion trip.  he i don't think was having fun
calling the cops on our party.

we however, were having loads of fun dodging the beach patrol...remember
when we pulled over to get a burrito?  hee hee ha ha.  that core group of
people that sat there patiently waiting for you to come through was a group
that all got to know each other a little better.  i mean, i had the chance
to hang out with Macadio and AdamG. and just talk in a way that I don't
normally get to at parties because of the music distraction.

so although someone may have been trying to put a rainy day on @spire, now
this party has become a pretty big subject of discussion.

so, in short, they failed their mission of busting your party so that
everyone would pay $25 to go to theirs.  or $10 or whatever.  i dunno who
it is and i don't really give a crap.  let them try.  we'll just throw
another underground next month on the same night as their masive.  there's
only 24 hours in a day and only 7 days in a week.  there are 5 billion
people in the world and something like 5.5 MILLION people in the Bay Area.
I think both parties could afford to be well attended.

so whoever tried to bust jer's party, may your wife divorce you.  or some
bad karma shit happen to you.  like your hands get cut off in a train
accident so you can't spin.  eww!  imagine that.  sitting there lookin at
the tables but you can't use them.  that's torture.

Hello Sfraves,

	We are pleased to announce the following party...

			On the weekend of August 15th - 17th,

Harmony will be teaming up with the Pacific Sound System, Cloud Factory,
and the MAD Crew to bring you a very special family gathering.

We have a 180+acre site right smack in the middle of the redwood forest.
The party will run from Friday afternoon, all the way until Sunday
afternoon (with breaks for sleeping). You are encouraged to come up Friday
and spend the entire weekend with us. However, if you do, you are also
responsible to bring your own food! This is very important! Bring enough
food to last you through the entire trip! There is plenty of free fresh
mountain spring water (the kind you pay $1 for in the store), as well as
tons of places to hike and camp. On site, there are hot and cold showers,
as well as enough fully plumbed rest rooms for the entire weekend. (no
portopotties!!!) Together, we will be supplying two sound systems (dance),
and one ambient/meditation area. 

This is going to be sooo much fun!!! There are much more detail to come, so
please keep your eyes and ears open! We will be selling a limited number of
presale tickets for this party, but they are not available yet. But as soon
as they are, we will tell you! See ya soon!!!

Peace and love

Heyhey everyone, Citru will be spinnin at Static tonight!  He's bein 
flown in from France to spin a massive down in l.a., but was able to 
swing by the bay on his way there!!!

For those of you who are unfamiliar with Citru - he's a dj and producer 
affiliated with Tribaux Pinguin of Montepelier, France...  He's spun 
alongside the likes of the Orb, System 7, DJ Trance, Rabbit in the Moon, 
Moontribe, etc...  He's by far one of the best dj's i've ever 
encountered...

Anyway, if you're lookin for somethin to do tonight, check him out! He's 
definitely got that crazy french sound...  Tig will also be featured 
tonight - another very cool and very funky dj...  so catch them both!

10pm-2am, $2. 2925 16th @ S Van Ness, SF

l8r,
leaf

p.s.  i know it sounds like a BSP, but i'm not citru - or tig - or 
affiliated with the club - i just love good music... cya on the 
dancefloor...

I was just kiddin' guys =) hehe.... I'm not really pissed off... I love
the adventure of raving.... i love it when things don't go as planned,
but I was upset that a lot of people were let down when they couldn't
find us. =( sorry guys... next time we'll have a better plan! =) and I
know karma will take it's toll on the guys who messed with us... how
could it not! I think this is a turning point for the UG scene..... too
much bad stuff has happened at parties in the past month or two... for
some reason I feel like the spell has been broken and it's time for the
UG scene to flourish! here we go ending the summer with a big BANG!
Can't wait! =) much love to you guys, and thanx for all your support!
damn  I'm so in love with the scene it's not even funny! right now I
should be sooooooooooo tired and not even able to function, but the
energy I feel from this passion for the scene is putting me on turbo!

weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee, jer - @spire

if Rodney King were a raver, he'd say, "can't we all just rave on?"

You CAN build a community, with careful planning . . . just because you
live somewhere means you are going to be able to be friends with the people
in your neighborhood.  Even if you are an accepting person, it doesn't mean
your neighbor is.  But you can, over a course of time, build a community.
4 years ago, 5 of my friends, all that I met at a rave or through a raver,
found an accepting safe neighborhood that we felt comfortable in, and we
rented a house.  4 years later, in the five mile vicinity, there was 12
"rave" houses and 2 warehouse lofts.  There was nothing boring about it . .
. Just because we all had one thing in common (our love for techno music),
didn't mean we were much the same after that.  Their were students, clerks,
producers, barristas, druggies, straight-edgers, a pro photographer, a
Dungeons and Dragons addict, snowboarders, etc.  They were all ages, races,
and income brackets.  It was great!  All the Charly Brown's came together
and built a neighborhood . . .

It sounds to me like, you are looking for that party with all the "cool"
people. You know the ones.
>From my experience in studying these cool type of ravErs, I am able to
predict where they will end up next.

Saturday, July 19th - Intoxication
two year anniversary
415.437.6905 510.674.8663


I will probably be to tired to go after Nikita Friday night. But I am going
to try to make it to this. I feel the need to express my feelings to some
of these cool ravErs. But I guess if I miss the party, I can always hit up
the summer school campuses to find them.


Peace & understanding
Jeff

supernatural is in the daytime.  so i don't think it will be a problem. 
Jeno is supposed to play from about 6 til 8 pm so there will be time for
him to get back from santa cruz to the city or where ever they have him
play that night.

Ouch - based on the snippets quoted by the SF Weekly over the last couple
of months, it's a pretty outlandish book using the sf rave scene as a
backdrop for a pretty wacked out plot.  

Maybe I'm just still kind of peeved by his book "Cyberia", which painted a
rather unflattering (in a backhanded-compliment-sorta-way) picture of the
SF "cyber" culture circa 1991/1992.

To each their own I guess.

...rawked hard.  I will really miss it - but it'll make the anticipation

I remember the time I stopped avoiding this question.  It was one of the

	Im siting here, readimg the posts about the incredible adventure and
amazing persaverence that your crew encountered through this ordeal, and
I am filled with joy about the enthusiasm that you and your crew had in
making this event happen.  It reminds me of my old school days... and
the type of stuff we did.

	But now I read the above statement about this Massive Crews screwing
with your event... and my whole atitude about the situation compleatly
has changed.  If you know something for sure and you want to make it a
mater of public record... THEN SAY IT.  But don't be looking for
scapegoats and starting desention without the information to back it
up.  Thats not right.  I seriously doubt that anyone messed with you for
financial reasons.  that more or less eliminates any Massive Promoters. 
Chances are that someone had a personal grudge with you guys and wanted
to mess up your party.. or whatever...  but lets not start saying that
Big promoters are trying to ruin small promoters, cause that is RARELY
EVER the case, and certainly NOT in the bay area.

	Im realy pleased that your and your people persevered to make the party
hapen against so many obsticles.  I also look forward to seeing many
positive events from your crew in the future.  

	So, Keep it positive, and Keep It REAL!

Yeah, yeah, more self promotion for me and the tribe! (Of course, who
else will promote me so hardcore?)

You might have seen the flyers around town, BUT
This just may be the last Tuesday that Tryptafunk will be held! 
Normally at the Transmission Theater (314 11th St., San Fran) it will
be held at the Paradise lounge (which is next door) this evening.

Starting at 9:23, performances from fire dancing to the trippy band
Channel 23.  At Midnight, DJ Goldilox will spin Jungle, Breakbeat, Trip
Hop 'till closing...All the freaks should be there.

FREE before 10, 2 bucks with costume, 5 bucks after 10 without costume.
(Last week a person came on his unicycle and rode out to trip hop, so
anything goes)

824-9023 Tryptafunk Line

It was a beautiful site- Joe, Monty, Sho, and Alex, all sloshed on
champagne, fighting against the evil Overlords of the Bahia Cabana to play
their last 30 minutes together as Mad.  The lights went on one by one, but
the dance floor stayed packed.  There was no stopping them this time.  They
took turns throwing down classic tunes one after the other, all of them
perfect ending tracks- but no one wanted it to end!  Even when the music
stopped, the cheers and screams forced an encore.  Finally, at 2:30, we
said goodbye to an era of Bay Area techno...

Thanks guys, we're gonna miss you... ~sniff

hey all! it's me, cricket, back from the dead to humbly ask for a favor.
see, i'm in summer school right now and have to write a paper about *our*
kind of music. the paper is essentially about a type of music that you feel
really communicates with the listener and evokes strong emotion. for me,
chosing the type of music was completely easy and obvious, but relating to
my professor exactly WHY this music makes me feel the way it does is a lot
harder. i mean, what IS it about this music that makes me get up and dance

*** Hey, I remember you...  You went down south I believe.

Anyways,  Let's see.  Since I DJ lots of styles of Techno I look for mixes
that give me that tingly chill that people can associate with either a
subtle wind breeze or the feeling of an E-shiver.   I guess to make it
short its the tracks that put a series of noises / notes that evoke such a
feeling of love, sadness, happiness or just a wacky acid line that makes me
want to jump around like a lil maniac.
(And thats the run on sentence from hell).


Anyways, hope that helps!

Here is a web site that asks that very question "WHY???"  It is focused
on Goa Trance, (my personal favorite) but you could probably stick any
sort of "rave" style music in the place of the words Goa Trance and have
a good description of Why...  There are many people's eloquent responses
to what it is about the music that makes them love it so much, and maybe
their words might inspire your ideas for your paper.  I hope it helps.

     The first time I heard a techno(or insert your own descriptor here) 
     record spin( I was sober mind you! ;> ), I was hypnotized. Here's a 
     consent beat, never-ending for 6-8 hours, with a very complicated 
     structure. At first, I didn't realize the hundreds of people next to 
     me, moving along the same beat, hearing and feeling the bass along 
     with me. It's a moving experience to someone who has never been that 
     close or sync'd with so many loving people. Sometimes, I don't believe 
     people actually realize the skill and emotion a DJ will put into a 
     show. REALITY CHECK: When you're dancing and sweating throughout the 
     night and into the morn, DID YOU HEAR THE MUSIC STOP???? 
     
     I hope you get a good grade, and if you have a cool teach, take 
     him(her) to a party! Feel it!

hey all! it's me, cricket, back from the dead to humbly ask for a favor. 
see, i'm in summer school right now and have to write a paper about *our* 
kind of music. the paper is essentially about a type of music that you feel 
really communicates with the listener and evokes strong emotion. for me, 
chosing the type of music was completely easy and obvious, but relating to 
my professor exactly WHY this music makes me feel the way it does is a lot 
harder. i mean, what IS it about this music that makes me get up and dance 
no matter how tired i am? what IS it about this music that gives me chills? 
what IS it about this music that has the power to get every single person on 
the dance floor jumping, yelling, whistling, hugging, smiling, and feeling 
the same way at the exact same time? i know what it is when i listen to it- 
it's in my heart- but it's hard to put in to words. which is where you guys 
come in.....i wanna know, i want you guys to tell me (and the list) why you 
love the music. why is it so powerful?
how would you explain it to someone who just hears random electronic noises 
instead of the harmony that's really there? any input, thoughts, 
experiences, ideas  -anything - would be GREATLY appreciated :) thanks!

What?!  Planning for next week already?!  Oh yeah.  After Wednesday's El Torito
fiesta, mark you calendar (or back of your hand or whatever) for Monday.  
Monday vibes need some serious help. 

The lunch will be at Little Baja by 880 and Gish (VERY close to the 101 
interchange).  I ate there today and it is cheap Messy-can (Mexican) eats.
The food was pretty light too.  I want to run the directions myself before
I broadcast them...but I just want to give you a good warning.  

Can't wait to see you all tomorrow...and this weekend...and next week...and
the next weekend...

Yeah, I haven't been to a massive since _Planet Rock_ (yeah yeah yeah, i 
know), and I think it's about time I went to another.  I'm looking for a 
massive with djs and/or musicians from all around the U.S. and the rest of the 
world too.

So I got a flyer here for the Space Children 2nd Annual Juggernaut Festival on 
Saturday, August 2nd.  There are djs and musicians from all over the place, 
there's 3 rooms in a big ol' permitted central bay location, and presale tix 
available almost everywhere for $20.

So I think this may be the kind of massive _I'm_ looking for . . . what do you 
all think of this event?

but here's the lineup in each room:
Chaosphere (main stage):  System 7 (live), Spacetime Continuum (live), The 
Crystal Method (live), Derric May, Tim Taylor & Slip (live), Barry Weaver, Jon 
Williams, Cesar.

Drum n' Space:  Dimensional Holofonic Sound, J. Saul Kane, Diesel Boy, RAW, 
Abstract, Noel, & UFO on 4 decks as Phunkateck, Jason Mouse

Halluciniation:  Mark Allen, Kode IV & Cieba (live), Daniel x Trevor, Brian x 
Brad, Dutch, DRC

call 415.213.1622, 510.461.SPACE for more info, or go to www.spacechildren.com

xoxo--Miccaela
P.S.  And FGE's Mega-Buzz-Mania is coming up too (Saturday August 30th)

 One thing you might want to state is the fact that the music is none stop!
It's one big solid groove fest! Bring in your favorite mix tape, show the
class (of all ravErs anyways no doubt) show them how it keeps going. Like
one big infinity of rythms!!

 I think this...music...we love so much is compleatly predictable. But for
music, whats wrong with that. It's like I want it to do this.Make this
change.And it does! I love that!! It's almost as if you are the one making
the music while your dancing.

Good luck on your essay, essay.. It is kinna hard to put into words.



But what do I know, everything is hard for me to articulate.  =]:..

Except for, the rythm..

 Alright u all,
Veann wants to show all the people up in Humbolt County how it's done in 
SF,wonderful idea! Right??? OK, all u ravers that know me know by now 
that i live in wine country, Napa Valley. It's soooooooo beautiful up 
here! People around here need to know how it's done. I'm surprise there 
hasn't been a party up here yet! The only parties i know of around here 
is in the Sonoma County this 25th. 
Anyways.........i really think it would be a wonderful idea to throw a 
very wonderful party in this very beautiful valley. This valley has 
soooo much places to throw a great party. There are many many various 
places that are secluded around here that are in great locations. My 
friend's family owns a winery up here and he has a very very nice house 
with a great place to throw a decent size party and he's very willing to 
share it with us wonderful people as long as we follow some rules but i 
know we would do a great job on that,right??? of course. :0)

To all the promoters out there..........an outdoor party would be 
incredible up here!!! I would guarantee it. :0)

I'm totally open for any suggestions, negative and positive(of course).  
:0) 


                                     Luv u all,

What is music?

I think music is the only representation of something perfect (unless
the  DJ trainwrecks) . When you listen to music it is based on math, it
is patterns that go in formations. Even classical music follows this
rule, if one note was out of place, a person who is really listening to
the music, can tell something is wrong.

When we listen to music, perhaps we visualize it as the only form of
perfection we are exposed to on this planet. The way music makes up feel
is more mysterious;  certain tones, chordes and arrangements make us
feel differently,  for example listen to a  motion picture, close your
eyes and listen to the music, and I'd bet you will be able to tell
emotions such as fear, love , celebration , wonder and many others.
Perhaps it is the different audio frequencies that act on certain areas
of our brain. 

We all have music in our heads, and since we are not telepathic (that we
know of) the most effective way to communiacte our feeling and emotions
is through music.  And when fellow people know  almost exactly how you
feel or what state of mind you're in, it brings the human race closer to
understandin each other.

Ok, that's my thoughts on the matter.

Hi,

If anyone from up north is planning on going down to Summer of Love
and has extra room in their car,    please contact me...   I would
really like to get a ride.

I'm currently near Fresno,  about halfway between LA and SF,   slightly
out of the way,    but I thought I would join SFRaves and SoCal Raves
again to just ask,  in the remote possibility that someone PLURR'y
enough might take a little time to come and pick me up on the way
down...  I am in such a remote location that the nearest hiway is
more than 6 miles away,  and the nearest town is about 30 miles.
Squaw Valley has 4 buildings,  and if you blink your eyes,  you'll
miss it.    This place brings a whole new meaning to the term "Boonies",
but at least I can live here phore free.   If anyone that knows me is
interested in wanting to know how I managed to get here,  please Email
me privately.

For those northerners,  Summer of Love is in the Angeles forest,  and
will be goa trance in the finest way,  with DJ's from both San Diego and
LA....

I've heard there is supposed to be a posse of people from SF area heading
down,  from some sources that know.   If this is true,   I would really
like to be rescued from Squaw Valley and hyjacked for a few days.

I can help with gas $ and got great stories to tell on the way down...

I haven't been to a rave since the rainbow gathering,  and am dying
to get out and dance in the woods....

JD

Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.org

        hey, I just had a weird weekend of spinning, dancing, and trying to
setup two parties, one on Saturday and the other on Sunday.

        On Saturday me and a bunch of other bored Berkeley people decided to
throw a party with all the equipment and setuff we had lying around, and did
it in the basement of Cloyne Court(which houses 150+ people, so it's a huge
basement called "The Dungeon"). It was fun, but while Thomas Trouble(who
went first) was spinning, an amp exploded! I was sort of excited at first
because it was cool and not my amp, but then I realized the sound level
dropped and now all we had was bass. Hardcore is boring with just bass, so
we had to scavenge for another amp. We eventually found someone with a huge
stereo that had a 200 watt amp and it worked, so it all turned out good.
Kraig spun some psychadelic trance that had everyone moving for a while,
then Kenny came on with some deep house. Unfortunately it went later and I
didn't get to spin, but my buddy Restive did a nice job of confusing the
group with some electro and acid-breaks before the night ended.

        On Sunday another friend had a party in Berkeley, in his basement(of
a building which his parents own). He calls his party 'Imogen'. It's a cool
place, with a very unusual vibe(mostly hardcore and gabber fanatics). I spun
there last weekend and I was excited to do it again, but this time I figured
tech and darkstep would mesh easier with the crowd. It was really cool for a
while, but too many DJ's who wanted to spin showed up so I only go to go for
45 minutes. I was glad people were dancing for a while, Greta went on after
me with some cool downtempo stuff, then the party go shut down. Oh well.

        Yay Berkeley underground! Go gabber and hardcore! Hey, I haven't
heard to much of it around, so it's weird seeing a party with two gabber,
one hardcore, and one jungle DJ. 

        -chris

Dear Everyone~
      I went to infectious Grooves on saturday, and while I was there my book
with phone numbers and addresses and notes from friends, was taken.  It was a
notebook with a redish-pink metal cover with a flower shape cut out.  The
cover page is purple. It's a ring notebook if you know what I mean. It is
very valuble to me.  I am going away to school and stuff in it was my only
way of ever seeing or contacting them and it had some things from my friends
that I will never see again.  I will give a reward if someone finds it.  No
questions asked!!!   The reward will be worth more than the store price of
it.  So please if you have any idea of who has it or how I could get it back
please let me know.   My house number is (408)395-6280, my pager is
(408)994-4894.  Please help!!!! :(:(:(
   THANK YOU!!!                             Love,

some say love, it is a river, that drowns the tender reed
some say love, it is a razor, that leaves ur soul to bleed
some say love, it is a hunger, an endless aching need
i say love, it is a flower, and you its only seed

its the heart afraid of breaking, that never learns to dance
its the dream afraid of waking, that never takes the chance
its the one, who won't be taken, who never learns to give
and the soul afraid of dying, that never learns to live

when the nite has been too lonely, and the road has been too long
and you think that love is only for the lucky and the strong
just remember, in the winter far beneath the bitter snow...
lies the seed...that with the sun's love, in the spring...
becomes...the rose. 

sound familiar.....


love is intangible....a feeling within that can make you laugh, cry or
happy  or sad....
....and sometimes...not all the time....love hurts....

Hmm, good one, good one! I define love as two things: First, in the most
natural ways; it's what drives you to feel biased towards that which might
otherwise make you feel indifferent, or even selfish. and Two; that which
makes you feel strife for that which you might not otherwise feel so strongly
about... Just a quicky for now, I haven't smoked anything yet!

this is what how i felt about it acouple years ago!


  Love cannot hurt me, 
                         I'm numb to it's sweet kiss. 
                         I will not let it bleed my soul 
                           Or Posion me with bliss. 

                           Love cannot touch me 
                         My disquise is too complete. 
                    My walls are raised, all weapons bared 
                             I taunt it in defeat. 

                           Love cannot mock me 
                          I'm wise now to its ploy. 
                      No facade of joy can hide the truth 
                             I will not be it's toy. 

                            Love cannot reach me 
                            So armored in my sin 
                         Alone I sit, forever damned 
                     and dream what might have been..... 

                           Love..cannot save me.

Leigh I read you this one time, the question has been how can we define
love?  How San Francisco.

~~~
How do we work this thing.  It isn't perfect., in fact, even the
scaffolding is drifting away.

When we aren't looking.

When we talk, we sound as though it won't go on without us.

It is immune  and invulnerable.

The laws that string us up are not within it.  It was created.

It is not destroyed.

Not like a circle or a cycle or a timeline.  It started with an end to
nothing.  Radiating at every possibility from a single...

not a point...not some stellar ultra-dense non-existant matter...

not from primordial...we cannot explain what no one prophet purports to
understand.
~~~

That poem was not about love, but then again it was.  It was about life.
But love IS life.

QED, mothafucka!

PAX,
MAX

I thought this was worth noting:)  Ravers take over Berlin!!! Yeah!


BERLIN, Germany (Reuter) - The sun blazed down on the world's largest 
techno music
party Saturday as an international crowd of up to one million people 
boogied and sweated
through the center of Berlin for the city's ninth annual Love Parade.

Ravers came from around the world to dance behind 38 brightly decorated 
floats equipped
with turbo-powered sound systems down a four-mile stretch of an 
eight-lane boulevard
which leads from the landmark Brandenburg Gate.

``We came because it's something you just have to experience,'' said 
Cornelius Hummel, a
19-year-old student from Stuttgart dressed in a Scottish kilt and 
bug-eyed sunglasses.

``You can't find this kind of euphoria anywhere else,'' said Karl-Hans 
Mayer, 50, a Berlin
cameraman who has attended the parade nearly every year. ``You simply 
cannot beat it.''

As temperatures climbed to almost 86 degrees F, first aid workers said 
they had treated
over one hundred people for dehydration and heatstroke, but added nobody 
had been
seriously injured in the huge crush of dancers.

The annual event, which last year drew 750,000 people, attracts fans of 
techno, a mix of
thundering beats and repetitive electronic riffs supplied by disc 
jockeys and their enormous
sound systems.

Overcrowded buses, trains and cars with visitors from across Europe 
bound for the parade
caused traffic jams across the country's highways and up to two-hour 
delays at Berlin's
main train station.

Some new arrivals held an impromptu ``rave'' Friday evening in front of 
the Zoologischer
Garten station soon after stepping off the platforms, while 3,000 others 
hijacked the posh
Kurfuerstendamm shopping avenue for an all-night party.

Most accommodation has been booked for weeks with people coming from as 
far afield as
South Africa, Australia and the United States. The Love Parade appears 
to have become
an essential stop on any backpacker's European tour.

My first Ultra exprience and I must say, IT WAS HOT!!!  

I was chillin' in the pool room waiting for my turn- just kickin' it, and
who pops his head in?  Bukem!  He's all, "pool aight!"
I said to him, "you're Bukem, yeah?  I hear you're the BOMB!"
He smiled at me with his gold tooth and we started shootin' the shit...
during which time I asked him if he wanted to play pool.  Once again- out
came the gold tooth with a very quick response, "YEAH, tha'd be GREAT!"  I
didn't have the nerve to tell him to put his quarters on the table and wait
like everyone else- it was BUKEM.  That would have been very, very,
BAD-FORM!!  Since I was next on the table, I gave it up as a token of the
VIBE he created for me, and the VSF/ULTRA-insomniacs!!!!    I told him
since I was giving up: sleep, $7 cover, countless bottles of water for me
and everybody in my crew (15 total by nights end), and the drive to SF from
SJ and then back after I recovered from the heat-stroke of the main
floor...  He smiled- shook my hand and said, "thank you, thanks SF for
coming out for his set!!!   And he MEANT it TOO!!! 

So his turn came...  he won...   The it was my turn to cue against him.... 
I was a pretty close match too.  When our round first started, the pool
room had a few people in it.  But towards the end of the game- the room was
packed with onlookers.  Bukem playing pool- people just stared with mouths
open...  I had him against the ropes!!  I had one left then the eightball,
he had two more then the eight...  I had a long green shot for the corner
pocket, and what does he do...  Seconds before I hit the cue ball- he put
two of his fingers in the hole I'm shooting for and started twinkling them
around.  Of course, I miss and totally set him up to finish me off!!!!!  I
look up and at him with a smile and say, "Bukeeeeeem.... BAD FORM!!!"  He
grabs his stomach with laughter- walks over, high-fives me and says, "sorry
Mate couldn't help it!"  I just smiled as he cleaned me off the table...  I
wished him luck with his set and left the table.  

I was up front for his whole set...  He noticed me as he was gig'n with a
smile.  I don't know what happened but, shortly after, he hit the turntable
his hand making the record skip...  He shock his head and put it right back
in the GROOVE!!!!  Then it hit me, those were the same two fingers he
twinkled as I was shotting....  'Poetic Justice' I thought too myself... 
But I was over it thereafter!!! He had me in a DEEP JUNGLE TRANCE!!!  [:)> 
 

Thank You Bukem!!!  YOU ARE THE d'BOMB!!!!!!!!

slow roasted wed in SJ-   then Nikita on fri.

c 'eah  then....   Ces and Candice roll on by!!!!

peace

   well I'm not saying any massive promoters did do that. but I can only
assume, I don't really have any personal grudges with anyone, at least
that I know of. Of course it could of been just some idiot that didn't
like me, but then again in recent days I do know that a couple of the
massive promoters have been bitching out small time promoters for
throwing free parties the day of theirs. It's happening and leads me to
assume, but I will never know the truth, so I won't point any fingers.
The question still stands, regardless of my party or anyones party, why
do massive promoters mess with ug promoters? it's a different crowd.

for the love of the scene.jer

I wish we could all just get along =)

Love is when you hug someone really close and you can't tell if you're 
feeling your heart beating so strong, or if you're feeling theirs...

To Joe & the list:

    Thanx joe, for your gentle reminder about why I (& many others)
started &are still going to raves.  I remember the joy I felt to find
such unjudgemental , unique, and happy people. To be a part of something
that, I too , felt had the power to change the world for the better.

 Today however,the power I felt the parties and the community to posses,
in my eyes has faded.  Drugs, commercialism, the new Generation gap our
scene is experiencing & constant antagonism by authorities has worn down
the appeal & the spiritual experience I once felt when I went to
parties.  My friend Jason consoles me by reminding me that nothing can
ever be as good as the first time, but I feel that the parties & the
people have changed and if they can get worse.........they can also get
better.

have you priced a grand piano recently?? you can get a car cheaper than
a grand piano...

nowadays, you can find "digital pianos" that multisample a real grand
piano for a lot less $$$ than a real piano. check out roland, yamaha,
kawai, and general music. 

or get a good sampler, and a high quality multisampled digital soundbank
of a grand piano.

of course, the "hardwired" digital pianos sound a bit more realistic
since they emulate the sympathetic string resonance you get on a real
piano.

best thing about a digital piano is that you don't need a whole room
to fit it. you can move it in the trunk of your car.

just a thought. yeah, nothing is better than the real thing, but sometimes
you have to compromise.

I've seen them, no experienced them, the last 7 times they have
performed in the bay area, and i gotta say, the experience that Crash
Worship provides is, well, very, very DEEP. They are both Frightening
and beautiful, sexy and ugly, mysterious yet fammiliar, Crash Worship
touch a very primal root in anyone who checks them out. Personally, and
please do not take this the wrong way, I have learned more about the
human condition at a Crash Worship performance than at any Rave. Any
thoughts? Comments?

just an observation.

No Shit!  It's because you can't hear the tone of voice that would let
people know that you're just joking around.  I constantly worry that
people would take my messages wrong because I'm a very sarcastic person.

-Pyro had written I had taken the easy way out of defining love...-

Is there an easy way out of love...I think not *8^)


    I can can recall in my travels a Dragon. An enourmous, flying,
firebreathing Dragon, who I saw faceless, without a home. Using my magical
powers I could open up, and look at his mind like a vision from a witches
couldren, and see his pain and passion. I saw him standing tall, towering
over the pine trees with his head almost reaching the clouds, and staring
down into a small patch of ground far below. He was staring at a rose. He
loved this rose more then anything could have loved ever before. He had
fought off pain, weariness, weeds, and demons, just to ever so 
infrequently catch a glimps of her beautiful red pedals or a scent of her 
wonderful sweet smell. He had traveled great distances, wounded, 
exhausted, awake, and in his dreams, just to feel that certain, mystical 
euphoria, that rumbling in his stomach, which only that one sweet rose could 
make him feel. And he then fell to the ground. He lost his strength and 
fell. Lying flat with his gigantic head landing in the one position where 
he would be forever staring directly at his love, he looked one more 
time...deeply...and saw a sweet, beautiful red rose, faceless, without a 
home.
    I slowly step away from the sleeping dragon, hoping that one day he 
will find a home again.




For those of you curious, this is a very short summary of a much larger 
piece of my writting. Love, (as I briefly wrote before.) is truely 
undefinable as it is grows on different people in different ways. We have 
all at one time in our lives know it and felt it. To deinfe it means to 
me that we would be taking away from it's mysticism. To express it 
rather, means to me that we are all sharing our experiences in it's joy. 


Love: the one thing on this planet that cannot be defined, yet can be 
infinately expressed :)


Stay Cool!

-Matt...the other one-

Love is an intense feeling deep inside that is so strong and has so much
meaning that there is no other feeling like it.

well, bastille was packed...  but there was a lot of suits, breedahs, and 
cultural elites, if ya catch my meanin...  but fortunately there was also 
some groovers...

my favorite line of the night:

sunshine is singing (as the bourgeouis suit and tie crowd stand 
motionless in front of him - much to busy to dance, being aborbed with 
pontificating to their fawning female accessories the deeper implications of 
alcohol on the inner workings of their sex drive... but i digress)

so sunshine's singin:  "How can you be so awake yet still so asleep"
*cuts out the beat for a second to bust out* "AND GET YOUR CUP _OFF_ of 
MY EQUIPMENT - HA!"

*drops the beat and the party goes nuts*

so the crowd was, well, not my blurryplurry fave, but dubtribe sounded 
sooooo damn good that it was still totally worth it...

Hi Folx,

Can someone kinda describe what Spiral Tribe will be like tonight?  i.e.,  what 
the music is like (in more detail than "it's techno or d&b),  and what the live 
stuff is??  It sounds pretty kewl, but MAD on Monday made yesterday hell,  so I 
gotta get fired up to go (and make Thursday hell!).   Plus I need to explain to 
another friend who must also work early on Thurs why it'll be worth it to 
sacrifice the body tomorrow for the spirit 2nite.  


[-- :) ----  :)-------- :)--------- :)---------  :)----------  :)---------

size afterwards!.

 You are all bee-you-tea-full  ppl!

Well, sorry I didn't talk much and stay long, but that wasn't my lunch time
and had to get back to work. I work from 6am to 3pm so my normal lunch is
at 10am-11am.  Maybe next time I'll stay longer. I just change my lunch
hour next time.

Later...

	The Answer to your question is Realy a Matter of Perspective.  If you
reverse the question and ask it form the other side, it might sound
like; "Why do all these UG promoters throw free parties, Which can
happen on any night of the week (when there is nothing else going on) on
the night that we have been working on for months?"  You see, It is all
a matter of perspective.  And then you ask the question.... Whoos REALY
messing with who?    Hay its a free world and everyone can do anything
they want.  I am in no way saying that Either perspective is right, Nor
am I saying that either perspective is wrong.  What I am trying to say
is that we should RESPECT eachothers Place and Space.  Every Promoter in
this scene has their own visions to acomplish, and it certainly sucks
when you get cock-blocked from within Your own scene.  
	In adition, you need to understand, that NO-ONE wakes up in the morning
and decides to throw "massives".  Every massive promoter that i have
ever met (nad i have met a lot of them) has started of as an underground
promoter, and expanded their vision to larger events.  Most massive
promoters have earned their place, and to them it can be rather
offensive when UG promoters (most of which have not been around as long)
decide to throw a free party (which is rather easy to organize or
rescedual) on the same night that they have been working on for MANY
months and have a large invesment of time and resources behind.  
	Personaly, I think that free parties should take place on the
Weekdays.  In the past, that has always been the way it has been done. 
There are only so many Saturdays in the summer, but there are a lot more
weekdays.  Whats the difference when its a free party anyways?  It can
be on any night, why does it have to be on a saturday night?  You see
MASSIVES Have to be on Saturdays, Free UG's Can be on any night of the
week.  So when you get back to your original question of "why do massive
promoters mess with ug promoters" You realy need to reavaluate your
perspectives, and make sure youre not the one thats doing the messing.  
	And what the hell does it matter anyways, the bottom line is that its
all about KARMA.  Maybee some massive promoters deserve to have this
happen to them.  Or maybee you are writing your own Karma for the
future....  Your parties may get biger, and someday someone will throw a
freebee on your big night and rain on your parade.    The only save bet
is to Practice and be an example of the PLUR philosophy....  Its the
closes thing you can do to insure a happy life and secessfull endevours.

it all about:

Love is blind....

Love is acceptance....

Love is always thinking of the other's needs before your own.

Love is letting go of your ego... your selfishness... your greed...   

Love is worth worth waiting for...

Love is what makes life worth it all... whether you are IN love or just full
of love... It makes it all worth it.

Love is...

	What you feel after you have been whipped to the point that
your back is opened and bleeding, your throat is raw from screaming,
and the bonds that have been holding you up for the last hour are
released and you colapse on the ground at the feet of your owner
unable to do much more than twitch, your muscles exausted from
straining, and you look up into your owners' face and see they are
proud of you for enduring it for them.

well, i'm new here, but thought i would share a few of my thoughts on how
impersonal e-mail and chat really is. it's almost as though all of the things
you type are put through some sort of filter. you could be e-mailing your
best friend, and later chat to a distant acquaintance and sound exactly the
same. plus the written english language  is overwhelming limited with the
noises we can develop with letters and punctuation it would be nearly
impossible to connect symbols to everything that comes from our mouths.
hopefully soon we'll be able to send e-mails that are recordings of our
voices, i think that would help. 


as for now.....i guess we'll have to make do with what we've got......

Sorry, Ray - I just have to disagree with you here...
Most of the ravers I know prefer either massives *or* UGs, so I'm
betting that most of your crowd that would be there the night of your
massive would be there whether or not an UG was going on or not.  Same
with the folks that prefer underground parties - that's just their
preferance and massives don't appeal to them.

Then comes the question of money.  There have been several massives that
I would have liked to have gone to, but couldn't because I didn't have
the $20-$25 it costs to get in. This is especially true since I no
longer live with my parents and I'm living in one of the country's most
expensive cities etc, etc, etc.  At least the UGs provide a place for us
economically challenged ravers to go when we would still like to boogy
down! :)

One more thing - if things were your way, I would never ever be able to
attend an UG party because I work during the week and have to get up
early!  The only time I've ever been able to make it out to Mad was when
I was still unemployed!   I **LIVE** for my weekends, as I am sure many
of us do, and to have the *luxury* of *CHOICES* here in the Bay Area is
something I hope we always have.  

loving both massives AND undergrounds,
Amy

undergrounds. more bang for my buck and all.

While you are completely entitled to your opinion, I have a few questions.
First off, what past you are talking about?  There have always been
free parties on weekends.  Even when I was living back east and raving in
Brooklyn in '92.  Even when I started coming out to SF in '93.  Even
when I moved here in '94.

>There are only so many Saturdays in the summer, but there are a lot more
>weekdays.  Whats the difference when its a free party anyways?  It can
>be on any night, why does it have to be on a saturday night?  

Because, MANY of the people who help put on free UG parties have day jobs
and so can't stay up all night on a weeknight to set up, run, and break
down a rave.  Weekends are just as convenient for the UG party planners
as for the massive planners.  Also, because we have day jobs, we can't
always set up and throw a party on a Friday night either.

>You see
>MASSIVES Have to be on Saturdays, 

I certainly agree with this.  The amout of set-up and tear-down work
requires it, along with the fact that for a massive to attract enough
people to make back its investment it needs to be on a Saturday so it
can pull in a big enough crowd of people with day jobs to pay for it all.

>Free UG's Can be on any night of the
>week.  

I've been to a number of free UG parties that have had such intense set
up and tear-down production requirements that the above statement can not
be considered to be strictly true.  It can take up to 8 hours to set up
for a UG, 5 if there's a big crew and people really push hard.  It's difficult
to do this on, say, a Thursday, and have the party end at 6am or so and
get it torn down (another 4 hour+ job, especially if you count returning
sound equipment) and still make it to work.  Oh, and did I mention sleeping?

>So when you get back to your original question of "why do massive
>promoters mess with ug promoters" You realy need to reavaluate your
>perspectives, and make sure youre not the one thats doing the messing.  

I think there's a hint of paranoia in this statement.  In my 5 year+
experience, UG party planners don't pick dates and times just so they
can "mess with" massive promoters.  Dates are usually picked because that
is when a certain space becomes available, and it's either have the party
that Saturday or never have it at all.

I think if a massive promoter puts on a good enough party, has an
interesting enough set-up and DJ line up, and charges a fair price, then 
people will choose to go to it even if there is an alternate selection of 
free UGs to choose from.

And one more thing about "free" UG's.  They are never truly free, it's
just that in the case of the UG's the lighting, sound, and DJs donate
their time and skills and the the party planners choose to eat the remaining
production costs (e.g. space rental, security, refreshments, truck rental
to haul gear around, flyers, tickets...).

	So Vlad, on the one hand you say the massive promoters just
*don't* mess with UG promoters, on the other hand you seem to imply 
that they do, but they wouldn't if the UG people would just stay away
from the Saturday nites. Which is it?

What a joke.

Wouldn't that would be lovely if we all just layed down and got of your way
so you could make Big Phat Profit every saturday night.

Never.

I'm here to tell you, that I personally will continue to throw undergrounds
on saturday nights for the express reason of providing quality, low cost or
free parties *as an alternative* to large scale expensive parties.

In fact, the more posts I see like this one, the more parties I'd be
inclined to throw.

You should be ashamed for yourself for even suggesting that people throwing
parties purely for the love of it should get out of the way of your profit
motive. Yuch. I'm disgusted.

Sorry for the waste of bandwidth.  I just found this today.  I picked up
in Germany last summer.  It's short so just read.


	TOPIC:  Doing the dishes.

		There are four people named Everybody, Somebody,
		Anybody, & Nobody.  There was an important job that
		had to be done and Everyody was asked to do it.  
		Everybody was sure Somebody would do it.  Anybody
		could have done it, but Nobody did it.  Somebody got
		angry about that, because it was Everybody's job.
		Everybody thought that Anybody could do it but Nobody
		realized that Everybody wouldn't do it.  It ended up that
		Everybody blamed Somebody when Nobody did what
		Anybody could have done.


Thank you for your time.  Pretty cool huh?

1. people don't go out as much during the week.  why would you want to
spend your $$$ on having a free party if no one is going to go.   free
parties aren't free for the promoters.    it might not be as large an
undertaking as a massive but usually the people throwing free underground
parties are small groups.   massives take alot of work, but if you really
come from underground roots you know that UG promoters work hard to make
thier parties fat.

2. if you are throwing a massive and you are going to charge $20 or
whatever, you should have a party that is fat enough so that people will
go no matter what else is going down that same night.   massives and free
UG parties are not in the same league.  if people want to have a free
party thats cool.  more people can access rave/house/trance/D&B culture 
it is better for the scene.   remember people throw free parties because
they love to party.   not because they want to take $$ away from you.  
cause remember its not about $$.... right?

Do you really think that just because you have been throwing parties for
a long time you should exclusive rights to party on a particular date?  
diversity is good for the scene.    not everyone that wants to party on a
saturday night is down with the massive vibe.  and besides with the $$$
that massive promoters pay for superfat flyers and posters and crazy dj
lineups and lasers you guys should be attracting people.   do you want to
make money because people can only go to your party that nite (no other
choice).  or do you want to make money because your party is really fat. 
if I was throwing massives i would want people to go because of the sheer
fatness of the event not because there is nothing else to do.

> So when you get back to your original question of "why do

giving people a chance to get down isn't messing with anyone.   its not
like selling dope on the corner where there is "turf".  no one owns
ravers. let them go where they want. 


sorry if this sounded confrontational but every one wants people to go to
their parties and  no one has a "right" to reserve any particular night
of the week.   I am not saying that any massive promoter is "messing"
with anyone.  I have no problems with massive promoters.  i think it is
cool that the bay area has people that can pull off really, really fat
parties.   

 but no one should ever call the cops on anyones party so that  more 
people come to theirs.  in my opinion anyone who does is nothing but a
money sucking judas goat.  but until it happens to me or others close to
me i would never accuse anyone of that.

at least i hope people around people around the bay are not like that.
are they?

peace to everybody

Yeah, I don't think I've ever seen so many fonts on one page!  One of the
things that bugs me the most about big rave promotion is the overwhealming
presence of offensive graphic art.  Rave art used to be innovative and
exciting, but now it seems like only one in a hundred fliers shows any kind
of creativity.  That's kind of the way I've been feeling about raves in
general.  They've been pretty much the same for 8 years now.  Black lights,
flourescent posters, lasers, disco balls, trippy computer generated
visuals.  The music has continued to grow and change, but the rave
environment has remained largely the same.  I'd like to see some parties
with more of a concept behind them.  I'd like to see environments created
that are more than just expensive, flashy props.  It would be nice to see
some kind of fusion of raves with art installations, experimental film,
etc.  Has anyone seem Granular Synthesis?  They're an amazing video
performance group that was featured on the cover of this month's XLR8R,
spotlighting "visuals".  Funny thing is, they didn't actually talk about
Granular Synthesis at all in the actual artical.  Instead, they focused on
the "trippy computer visual" guys who've been doing the same thing for
years.  What's up with that?  When are we going to see something new in
this scene?

Right on, Ethan!  the concept of massive crews "owning" my saturday night 
is egotistical and ludicrous.  I'd take a vibey night at the beach with 
some warm groovers over a cold, commercialized dusty warehouse any 
weekend...  maybe that's what they're afraid of.  

competition is good for the scene - maybe if the massives weren't so 
impersonal, smaller parties wouldn't spring up.  who needs the 
hierarchies and the territorial pissings.

keep up the UG's - that's where you find the spirit of community...

[FLAME BAIT DELETED]

My take on this... 
If I threw UG parties, I'd schedule my UG's on the same nights as massives
on purpose.  That way, the people who came to the UG were there 'cause they
wanted to rave, not because they were bored/wanted to sell drugs/pick up on
someone.  

'Course I like the occasional massive too, makes a good change of pace.

I know that myself and others on this list feel the same way you do,
Seth.  Remember after Area 51 there was a whole discussion on turning a
party into something with a real theme with maybe literature and
lectures?  Your ideas about art installations and experimental film
sound cool too. Maybe someday soon that might become a reality.  I think
raves *are* evolving - for example there are more raves that have some
kind of opening ceremony and are spiritually themed (this is definately
an UG thing).  There are parties that happen outdoors on the beach or in
breathtaking paradise gardens (i.e. Tribal Future).  Then you have
Burning Man, which of course is not even a rave.  Come to think of it, I
think this scene has come quite aways - you just have to stop and think
about it for a few minutes...but I do kwow what you mean!

Hoping to find myself
at a great psy-trance
party on the beach this 
friday...love,
Amy

I'm sensing a mini-flame war coming on (UGs VS massives), so I thought I'd
forward along some humor...
Your welcome :)

Here's some political definitions for y'all, in case you were
interested... 
*********************************

FEUDALISM
You have two cows. Your lord takes some of the milk.

PURE SOCIALISM
You have two cows. The government takes them and puts them in
a barn with everyone else's cows. You have to take care of all
the cows. The government gives you a glass of milk.

BUREAUCRATIC SOCIALISM
Your cows are cared for by ex-chicken farmers. You have to take
care of the chickens the  government took from the chicken farmers.
The government gives you as much milk and eggs as the regulation says
you should need.

FASCISM
You have two cows. The government takes both, hires you to take
care of them, and sells you the milk.

PURE COMMUNISM
You share two cows with your neighbors. You and your neighbors
bicker about who has the most "ability" and who has the most "need".
Meanwhile, no one works, no one gets any milk, and the cows drop dead
of starvation.

RUSSIAN COMMUNISM
You have two cows. You have to take care of them, but the government
takes all the milk. You steal back as much milk as you can and sell it
on the black market.

PERESTROIKA
You have two cows. You have to take care of them, but the Mafia
takes all the milk. You steal back as much milk as you can and
sell it on the "free" market.

CAMBODIAN COMMUNISM
You have two cows. The government takes both and shoots you.

DICTATORSHIP
You have two cows. The government takes both and drafts you.

PURE DEMOCRACY
You have two cows. Your neighbors decide who gets the milk.

REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY
You have two cows. Your neighbors pick someone to tell you who
gets the milk.

BUREAUCRACY
You have two cows. At first the government regulates what you
can feed them and when you can milk them. Then it pays you not
to milk them. Then it takes both, shoots one, milks the other
and pours the milk down the drain. Then it requires you to
fill out forms accounting for the missing cows.

CAPITALISM
You don't have any cows. The bank won't lend you any money
to buy cows, because you don't have any cows.

PURE ANARCHY
You have two cows. Either you sell the milk at a fair price
or your neighbors try to take the cows and kill you.

ANARCHO-CAPITALISM
You have two cows. You sell one and buy a bull.

SURREALISM
You have two giraffes. The government requires you to take
harmonica lessons.

OLYMPICS-ISM You have two cows, one American, one Chinese.
With the help of shrilling violins and "state of the art"
montage photography, John Tesh narrates the moving tale of
how the American cow overcame the agony of growing up in a
suburb with (gasp) divorced parents, then mentions in passing
that the Chinese cow was beaten every day by a tyrannical farmer and
watched its parents butchered before its eyes. The American cow wins
the competition, severely spraining an udder in a gritty performance,
and gets a multi-million dollar contract to endorse Wheaties. The
Chinese cow is led out of the arena and shot by Chinese government
officials, though no one ever hears about it. McDonald's buys the meat
and serves it hot and fast at it's Beijing restaurant.

Right on!  What right do those commie UG party throwers have pulling 600
people away from your 5000 person massive for a "free" party.  The nerve of
some people.
Maybe we can come up with a "Saturday night rave tax" and keep them from
being a problem.  I hear calling in noise complaints on them is
particularly effective.

Yanno, 
It'd be great to have weekday parties, but FUCKIN SHIT some of us have to 
work.
How can we throw parties if we're doin 40+ hours during the week of work? 
Just curious.
And if outdoor parties only pull a certian amount of people, small amount 
compared to what massives draw, why should we be pushed out of the weekend?
Throwing free parties is not a crime, it shouldn't be dissed just because 
the promoters want to do something for the little jungleheadz or ravekids 
out there. Massives are NOT being hurt by outdoor parties. Kids who wanna 
go to huge warehouses and go to huve parties, do so. Kids who want to go 
to outdoor free parties and have a smaller party, do so. Sometimes they 
jump from one type to another -- ALOT of times they do.
But why should outdoor/free party promoters be threatened by massive 
party throwers? There's no reason, they have no right.
Yeah some of them have been around for a long time, that is proof that 
they're gonna be around for some time to come. But they don't RULE the 
scene. this is not a monopoly, it's a scene where everyone can contribute 
and shit. if kids wanna throw outdoor free parties the same night as a 
massive, it's their right to do so.
'nuff sed
and mad respekt to all.

Maybe if those massives kept up with massive props, massive ideas for
locations (oh gee, home base again), massive talent, and some massively
innovative ideas, they wouldn't be so concerned.

I was going to post a couple months ago how I thought it was a little
strange that massives were starting to suddenly acknowledge a large amount
of our UG DJs by having them spin.  Ironically, many of those UG DJ's that
were being acknowledged also throw UG parties.  Kinda like a corporate
buyout or something.  Neat way of guaranteeing that no larger UGs occur 
that night But then, better sense got the best of me, and I
wrote it off as another paranoid delusion.

I honestly think that Vlad's post started out as a almost joke, to show a
little perspective on Jer's post.  Let's just say it's not going to help
anyone if none of us trust each other.  There are some promoters who pull
some screwy stuff, and some use politics and some just suck.  When that
happens, we should make sure we know it's actually happening, and then go
ahead and call them on it.

Small parties are difficult to make money on, particularly free parties.
A well managed massive can make money, but only if draw works out.  I
don't know if I'd be able to maintain my integrity in the face of risking
losing $250,000... I almost feel I strengthen it by being involved in free
renegades every once in a while.  There's something almost purifying about
dragging a generator through half a mile of sand, then seeing people spin,
maybe even getting a chance to myself, and watching all these wonderful
people come out to join us and share in the nuttiness of it all.

It's up to the people going.  If they want to be part of the nameless
whorde and see the big names and do that then let em.  If they want to
gather in small groups risking their asses as a group, simply for the joy
of gathering and dancing, then let them.

In fact, a lot of these recent posts have been running around with the
idea of what money does to people, integrity, etc.  I've been thinking
about the best parties I've been to this year, and some were big parties
and some were small.

Just ask yourself this question:

Which promoter cares more about the vibe, the one with several thousand on
the line, or the one who KNOWS they're losing $500 to show some people a
good time.

Which DJ is gonna hookup with the crowd, the one that is hella stoked to
spin their favorite music for their friends and party, or the one who
negotiates with the promoter over whether they are really worth their
$1000 asking price?

Peace,
AndyW

Vlad,

First off, history lesson: "In the past, there weren't $25 commercial
massives produced by greedy promoters, it was simply an artistic expression
created by a group of friends, bound by the music and the culture."

Second, it's been well talked about in the underground that *you* had
Spundae's Nation party shut down last year by flooding the police w/
complaints, etc, etc -- and they aren't even underground promoters -- it
was rumored that you were simply jealous that they were proceeding to have
a ma$$ive in SF before you could. I find that revolting.

You are and very well represent quite a bit of what's wrong with the
beautiful world wide community movement known as "rave" -- and it's your
shameless capitalistic tactics and values that are moving us closer to the
"1993" that we all want to forget, all over again. Infighting, promoters
calling the police on each other, and shameless commercialism is just what
got us there, and "that's you."

For you to suggest that groups producing free events as a passionate
artistic expression "get out of your way" so that you can fill your wallet
is the most offensive thing I've heard in quite some time. Just like (and
with) Ethan, I would *do my best* to ensure that there's always a *real*
alternative to anybody's commercial schwag-fests, including yours.

Finally, everyone, listen up!: If your party, big or small, gets busted, be
sure to "Think/Thank Vlad" -- based on his (and the communitys') earlier
innuendo, he's likely behind it.

Signed,

A passionate artist of the underground

Here're a couple of theories I worked out in my head at work (ahh 
brainless jobs that pay just enough to keep you from quitting are great 
for sitting around thinking up shit) as to why music moves us, and 
all of that shit. REad on.
	All our lives, from the very beginning, we have associated the 
sounds of music with pleasure. As infants, our mothers often sang to some 
of us. The soft, recognizable voice manipulated into a melodic reassuring 
tone brought us to a state of contentment and releived us of frustration 
of not being able to talk. As we grew older, tunes were played to 
celebrate joyous occasions, and we learned songs to make learning easier. 
Music hs brough a light to all of our lives, perhaps this is one of the 
reasons why it moves us.
	Music not only soothes my mind and soult, it heals my broken 
heart, brings out the best in me.. Lifts my spirits.. There's nothing 
like a wicked jungle track (hadda say jungle, i know, i suck) to bring my 
attitude up, a smile to my face, my self esteem begins to peek through 
and that surge of "fuck YEAH, life is DAMN good and you can't bring MY 
funky ass down even if ya TRIED" runs through me. Music keeps me sane.
	Bouncy or warped, rollin' or wicked, the basslines rattle and 
caress my mind and body, and breaks and samples rupture the flow like 
fuckin sunshine on a rainy day. On any day stick me in a windowless room 
with nothing in it. I guarantee I can entaertain myself -- I'll be 
groovin to beats in my mind. You can take my freedom, you can take my 
money, you can take my heart and break it mothafucka but you can't take 
music away from a person, coz you can't take my mind, and you can't TAKE 
my heart and soul -- and that's exactly where music comes from. 
	Maybe that's why I like music so much -- not coz it's always 
there for ya, which it is yanno.. But because it's NOT random sounds here 
and there. If you hear a sample, it's not there by accident, someone 
strategically placed it there for a reason -- to get a message across. 
Music is the artist's passions and dreams. Soemone's story. Here is an 
artist who is channeling their emotions into a sound they can express to 
anyone they please, sharing their passions with the world through melodic 
energy. And here are we, listeners, and not just receptors to random 
sound but to emotion in audio form. The artists -- our storytellers; the 
music -- the story; us -- the audience. The most beautiful way of 
communication and we can celebrate it whenever we damn well please. Pure 
emotion in fluid audio form. 
	Electronic music is just as beautiful and awesome as any other 
form of music, if not more so. Although it is composed with modern 
technology, it is still the expression of passion and emotion. The use of 
electronic devices does not devalue the music, correctly used it makes 
the possibilities in the realm of music endless -- there are no 
boundaries. Incredible, beautiful sounds can be made from a machine. It 
is the INGENUITY and PASSIOn of the ARTIST, *NOT* the instrument that 
makes beautiful music.
	Musicwill always be important and beautiful to me. It makes me 
move, brings tears to my eyes and a smile to my face. Inspires me. 
Touches me. It's a huge part of my life, always has been, always will. 
And if I could be so talented and I ever find the courage and 
determination, music would BE my life.

respekt,
lara

I "massively" agree with this - I have been to large parties, paid $20, and
thought I got every penny's worth.  There are some honestly good large
party throwers in our scene, who don't worry about competing with free
parties.

love is quiet and huge and small and overwhelming and wonderful and awful

ok, I WAS joking, but trully, is there any way but the easy way out of
explaining love? Each of us must define it for ourselves, but to trully
define it, I think is impossible! So, we all take the easy way out to define
it, but in trying we can find out more about ourselves and others... Just a

Okay, this is me going off on my tangent:

If the majority of the people who go to massives are supposedly so degenerate 
that they screw up the vibe as much as (some) people say they do, then why let 
these people take over that part of the scene?

For instance, say you are one of these real ravers, you know, 
hardcore-old-skool-not-in-it-for-the-drugs-keep-it-underground types (which is 
not a bad thing to be, in fact it's a damn good thing to be).  Damn it, you 
love the scene so much that you can't stand to see "those people" fuck up a 
party, selling drugs, overdosing, freekin to trance music, or whatever it is 
that "they" do.  So how do you respond?  You just bitch about it and stop 
going to massives?

Well, sorry if this seems a little chickenshit to me.  But don't you think 
that it is your _responsibility_ as as _true_ raver to keep going to these 
parties, to set an example, to keep the vibe positive, and not surrender a 
whole part of the scene (the massive) to "those people?"  Just let them take 
it over?  What are you going to do when these folx start coming to UG parties 
(because, honey, eventually they will)?  Stop going to those?  Sit around at 
home listening to your Kraftwerk records bitching about how "those people" 
took over your scene?

I believe UG parties aren't necessarily better than massives--they're just 
different.  They're apples and oranges, baby.  But if you, like many others, 
believe that massives aren't as good as UG parties, that's fine, it's a 
somewhat valid viewpoint.  But if your reasoning behind that belief is that 
"those people" (discrimination and prejudice are beautiful things, are they 
not?) tend to overpopulate the massives, perhaps you'd better ask yourself how 
much of this is your own doing.  Look within yoself, chile.

Now, personally, I like massives.  Why?  Because they usually offer a lot of 
variety in music, talented djs and musicians, a whole lot of space & rooms, 
lots of cool party peoples, and they're usually popo/bust-free.  And because I 
refuse to let a couple bad seeds bother me too much.  If I tripped off every 
drug dealer, hoochie mama, and whoever else, I'd be angry as hell all the 
time.  In my (twisted) mind, these folx just aren't worth the time, effort, 
and emotion that goes into bitching about and avoiding them.  I just say, hey, 
fuck it, I'm in control of my own experience, and get my groove on regardless. 
 Besides, "they" sometimes aren't that bad if you take the time to get to know 
them.

Hmmm . . . isn't plUr about not dividing yourselves into US and THEM?  About 
getting to know and understand other types of people?  I think it is, but, 
I've never been a big fan of that plur thing, because it is too often said and 
oh so _rarely_ practiced, ya know.

Look up in the sky it's a bird it's a flame . . . sorry folx, just expressing 
myself, felt it needed to be done.  When I write posts like this, I want to 
make you think, not piss you off.  But sometimes getting people excited is the 
only way to do it.

So . . . If you're seriously angry after reading this, stop being so damned 
self-righteous!  Don't take yourself so seriously!  Besides, why the hell are 
you so worried about what I think anyway?  Instead of posting that flaming 
retort, go plant a tree or read a book, use that time for something more 
constructive.

Ahhh . . . does anyone else get all tense when they see 15+ posts w/ the same 
subject line . . . you know something's up, and you can just hope that it's 
not directed at you and won't piss you off too much if you read it . . . and 
you know that you _will_ read it, and probably contribute to it . . . no 
matter how much you said you wouldn't participate in flame threads when the 
last one erupted (Death at Origin, anyone?).

Hey, long live the flame war--I've learned a lot from some of those angry 
little posts.  It's good to have your values and viewpoints questioned and 
assaulted everyone once in a while--makes you think.  A flame a day keeps the 
ignorance away, maybe?

I don't think anyone is saying (in the UG vs Massives thread) that people
who go to massives, per se, are the problem.  So far the debate has been
centered on party planners who see it as a competitive business rather than
something to do for fun.

The reason I help throw UG's is *precisely* because that's the best way I
know how to "set an example".  To me, raving is all about the
Do-It-Yourself ethic - expressing yourself - being independent and creating
your own wealth of happiness rather than paying someone to dish it to you
on a silver platter.  I don't feel that's adequately communicated in a dark
100K warehouse with three strobes and four blacklights and Shredder
speakers and 3000 others.  Wandering around handing out glowsticks and
candy doesn't do it.

I'm not saying wonderful experiences can't be had at large parties; they
very often happen.  But without the grounding of the small parties, it's
very easy to mistake a big warehouse with booming speakers with a coliseum
rock concert.

I would much much much rather see 10 different parties with 500-1000 people
at each, than 1 big party with 10000 or 2 with 5000.  But your mileage may
vary, as they say...

Do You even know me?  Obviously NOT!  You could not be further from the
truth on what you just wrote.  I love this scene, I have been behind it
for Many Years, Suporting it in every way posible.  I don't know exactly
what it is that you have against me, but you've got me all wrong.  Have
you evr talked to me?  I am so Hurt by your post that I started to cry
after I read it.  Why would you say such mean and cruel things about
someone you don't even know.  I have devoted my life to make people feel
good and support everything that this scene stands for, and that
includes the opinion of people like yourself, but man... do you even
believe the things you just wrote?  Do you call yourself a raver?  Im
going to take some time off and reavaluate why I love this scene,
because after reading what you said, Im not sure about this scene or the
people in it.  Thanks for placing another straw of misbeliefe on this
camels back.  I hope knowing that you hurt me has made you feel good
about your self.

Ok.. a few have expressed interest in this topic...  This is the essay I 
wrote on it for English 1a last year..
While researching this I also found a report about the CIA 
giving Jack Kerouac and Carlo Marx LSD, and then observing them..
pretty crazy stuff

Gregery


          LSD and the CIA
    Everybody knows that LSD can be a very harmful drug.  Nobody knows 
this better than our government, but they still slipped large doses of 
this illicit drug to thousands of citizens.  MK-ULTRA was the code  name 
for the CIA's program derected at gaining control over human behavior 
through the use of chemical and biological materials.  Their goal was 
mass mind control.

The CIA used LSD at least as early as World War II and continued for 
many years after MK-ULTRA's publicly stated conclusion.  MK-ULTRA 
performed an undetermined number of bizarre and often grotesque 
experiments.  Many of these experiments were responsible for deaths and 
brain damage.  

Among the goals of the MK-ULTRA project were to develop the following.  
1. Substances which will promote illogical thinking and impulses to the 
point where the recipient would be discredited in public.  2. Materials 
to render the induction of hypnosis easier, substances which will 
produce 'pure' euphoria with no subsequent let-down.  3. Materials and 
psysical methods which will produce amnesia for events preceding and 
during their use.  4. Substances which alter personality structure in 
such a way that the tendency of the rercipient to become dependent upon 
another person is enhanced.  5. Substances which will lower the ambition 
and general working efficiency of men.  There are NOT noble goals, but 
not suprising considering the United States government.  The director of 
the CIA at the time of the founding of the MK-ULTRA program justified 
its notable unethical aspects with the rationale, "We are not Boy 
Scouts."  The MK-ULTRA program officially ran from 1853 to 1964, when it 
was renamed to MK-SEARCH and continued until 1973.

The CIA victimized certain groups of people who were unable to resist: 
prisoners, mental patients, foreigners, the terminally ill, sexual 
deviants, ethnic minorities.  One project took place at the Addiction 
Research Center of the US Public Health Service Hospital in Lexington, 
Kentucky.  Lexington was a place where heroin addicts could go to shake 
a habit, and although it was officially a penitentiary, all the inmates 
were referred to as "patients."  CIA documents describe experiments 
conducted at Lexington in which certain patients - nearly all black 
inmates- were given LSD for more than 75 consecutive days.  In order to 
overcome tolerance to the hallucinogen, double, triple, and quadruple 
doses were administered.  It is no wonder that Lexington had a return 
rate of 90 percent.

Tests were not limited to only helpless victims.  The CIA did massive 
internal testing.  Such testing in November 1953 resulted in death.  On 
the second day of a three day CIA retreat, the after-dinner cocktails 
were spiked with LSD.  After the cocktails, the guests were informed of 
what they had ingested.  Dr. Frank Olson, and army scientist who 
specialized in biological warfare research, had never taken LSD before, 
and slid into a deep depression.  In the weeks that followed, he 
developed some very strange behavior.  It was concluded that Dr. Olson 
was in "a psychotic state with delusions of persecution"  that had been 
"crystallized by the LSD experience."  Arrangements were made to move 
him to a CIA sanitorium.  On his last  night before leaving, he was in a 
New York hotel room with a  CIA agent assigned to watch him.  In the 
early morning, the scientist
plunged head-first through a closed window to his death ten floors 
below.  Olson's apparent suicide caused CIA security to be drastically 
tightened.  An elaborate cover-up erased clues to the actual 
ciircumstances leading to his death.  Olson's widow was eventually given 
a government pension, but the truth was not revealed for twenty years.

There is quite a bit of evidence that the CIA used LSD in the 60s to try 
to keep the youth from creating uncontrollable political movements.  The 
use of LSD among young people in the U.S. reached a peak in the late 
1960's , shortly after the CIA initiated a series of covert operations 
designed to disrupt, discredit, and neutralize the New Left.  Ronald 
Stark was a leading distributor of LSD in the late 60s.  The CIA has 
never admitted that he was an operative, but in 1979 he was  standing 
trial in Italy for armed banditry.  He was released after investigators 
found "an impressive series of scrupulously enumerated proofs" that 
Stark had worked for the CIA "from 1960 onward."  Tim Scully, chief of 
Stark's major LSD-brewing outfit, believed that Stark was employed by  
an American intelligence agency that wanted to see more psychedelic 
drugs on the street.  John Lennon once said, "We must remember to thank 
the CIA and the army for LSD.  THey invented LSD to control people and 
what it did was give us freedom."

Then there was operation "Midnight Climax."  The CIA employed a group of 
drug-addicted prostitutes in san francisco.  They sent them to bars to 
try to lure men back to an apartment.  While at the bar the prostitute 
was to slip acid into the man's drink.  Back at the apartment CIA 
researchers sipped martinis and observed the scientific action from 
behind two way mirrors.  The official purpose of this was to test the 
exploitation of sex for espionage purposes.

LSD was not the most potent drug investigated by the intelligence and 
military agencies.  Nor dfid they limit their research to drugs.  
Hypnosis, electronic brain implants, microwave transmissions, and 
parapsychology also were researched.  John Marks, and author on the 
subject, readilyh acknowledges that the researchers "probaly" planted 
electrodes in the brains of men.  Marks points out that the electrode 
experiments "went far beyond giving monkeys orgasms," one of the 
researchers' early achievements.

Psychiatrist Ewen Cameron recieved CIA funding to test a procedure he 
called "depatterning."  This technique, Cameron explained when he 
applied for his CIA grant, involved the "breaking down of ongoing 
patterns of the patient's behavior by the means of particualarly intense 
electroshocks," in addition to LSD.  Some of his subjects suffered brain 
damage and other debilitations.  One sued the government and won an 
out-of-court settlement in 1988.

Sometime around 1973 when the founder of MK-ULTRA was to retire, he 
ordered the majority of secret MK-ULTRA documents destroyed sue to "a 
burgeoning paper problem."  Amond the disposed materials were all 
existing copies of a classified CIA manual titled "LSD: Some 
un-psychedelic iimplications."  Their exists today no on-paper evidence 
that MK-ULTRA was either a conspiracy to unleash remote-controlled 
lethal human robots or to emasculate an entire generaltion by 
oversaturating it with a mind-frying drug.  But MK-ULTRA was very real 
and the danger of a secret government program to control the thoughts of 
its citizens needs no elaboration.

I'd like to thank everyone who came out to Slow Roasted last night!  We
had a great time, and if my set was half as good as Maiz's, then the music
rocked too.  She's just winding down, and Matt and I can't think of a good
reason for her to stop (well the shop is closing.. but... errr).

Hope to see you at one real soon...

Andy, Matt and Alex

i was sitting here minding my own bussiness, then you had to blame the list
for taking offense to a irresponsible post you made. I was going to keep
quiet, but that bothered me. You said that UG parties should be thrown on the
weekdays because they are not throwing the party for monetary gain. that
means since Feel Goods goal of making money protects it in some way. so no UG
crew is to throw a party conflicting w/ it. Thats like saying that wrong to
make coca cola when there is pepsi. it's about decisions, the UG promoters
decide to throw a party for the crowd that would rather be there than at a
massive. this isn't about what is better or worse> i would rather personally
go to a UG party, but i like the option to go to the massive if i chose so.
I'm sowee to everyone but i felt that was disrespectful to blame the list for
a post, i'm sure you know would bring negative posts.

love~
jeremy

It's about the love of the scene not your own monetary gain

FAMILY.

a sense of belonging;
gratitude;
kindness;
acceptance;
understanding;

and above all,
*forgiveness*

remember that next time someone you "love" does something you don't 
agree with.  Whether it be their lifestyle choice, their taste in 
friends and significant others, or if they've just made poor decisions.  
Once you love someone, you *always* love.  

There's no such thing as conditional love.  

g`night everyone,
christine the candygirl!

<<<Make sure every day that those people you love know how you 
feel...they may be gone before you know it.>>>
                       
That's a quote from my mommy. So what if I'm immature. She'll love me 
anyway. =9

Hey Everyone on SFRaves! I Love you and I missed you!! Did you miss me?
Of course you did! Well, I don't know how each and everyone of you feel
about me and I know that some of you people (especially the ones who
never met me) don't like me, but thats okay. Someone must like me!

Well, I missed you guys and I am so sorry if anyone emailed me and I
never got back to you. I just went away from my computer for 2 weeks and
when I came back there were 500 something messages and I was like no
way. I just kept putting off dowloading them all. Then one day Paula
(that beautiful and happy girl) gave me the idea of deleting my email
and then remaking it. All the 1455 email messages were deleted along
wiht my email. Then I got my email name back and now i just downloaded
105 messages for today.

I don't know what some posts have been about. I have heard stories about
stuff and I have some things I would like to say about certain things:

1) Wonderland. Even though sooo many things went wrong that night, (the
map point, the voicemail, the bust up, the after party confusion, the
projecter, the gum etc.) I think that it was an experience that i will
never forget. Not only did it show that the SF Scene has a STRONG sense
of unity, but also it made me realize jsut how many ravers I care about
and how many care about me and my friends. I thought that the night was
spiritualy uplifting and special. Remember its not about the party at
all its about US and the one thing that seperates us from the rest of
today's society. UNITY!! Yes, todays society lacks it greatly. Some how
ravers have still been able to keep it strogn between them and
Wonderland proved that in every way possible!

2) Death at Origin - I don't know the details, but I am sorry about what
happend. Its sad. My heart goes out to anyone who knew the person who
died.

3) Cops - They suck!!!!! They are assholes and no matter what peope say
about them doing their jobs, they are still jerks. Now, I take that back
I know a few cops who are damn decent people and are fair and
considerate. Those are the ones who should be comended for a job well
done.

Thats all I have to say about that.

Well I am gonna begin posting once more. Also, Amanda or Dustin will onw
of you please email me. Sorry to use SFRaves as a pager, but I neeeeed
to get ahold of one of you. Preferably Dustin. 

Lotsa Luv,
Paul*E*Wog

At first I planned in writing this long post on this Massive n UG
thread. But after some thinking well, I just dont honestly know where
I stand on this. I see a lot of good points on both sides. But anyway,
here we go

I dont really think that there is anything wrong with throwing a free
party the same night as a massive, just dont shout the word out as
much. A free party has less of a problem getting the word out anyway so
its not necessary to really push the flyers. Let the parties that cost
money to put on do that. Yes I know "free" parties cost too but they
dont need to get that money back. Massives do. So for instance if
something like a FMR happened the same night as a massive I dont think
anyone would care because Full Moons are so low key anyway. 

I come from a long line of entrapanuers (All the way back to the
Mayflower!), so I give total props to anyone who makes their living
doing something they love. For me, thats the ONLY way to live. You have
to bring home the bacon somehow, might as well be something you enjoy.
But should a big budget, 20-10 dollar party take priority over a free
one? Raves started out free I thought. Its not that I dont like
massives, on the contrary, I love em! And having only worked one massive
personally, I totally appreciate the work that goes into them, and it
would suck to have someone throw a free party the night of your massive.
But I think its really a matter of economics. If people are in fact
choosing to go to an outdoor, less glamorous, free party as opposed to
the brighter, louder massive that costs, that should tell you something!
That should tell you something about what people really want. As the
saying goes "The people make the party."

It seems everything costs money these days. People are always trying to
nickel n dime you any way they can. So to me, the word "Free" just
keeps sounding better and better. Think about how much noise people make
over a $1 bottle of water, and how much they love free stuff. When
something is free, its more than just zero cost, its saying "no
strings attached" or "giving you this is my reward". And in todays
society, doesnt that sound refreshing?

OOPS! Well, I guess this did turn out to be pretty long! :P

You knows what is really funny... Whether a promoter is throwing a party for
money or if they just love the music, nobody has the right to judge another
for their reasons.. 
And on the same token, I really dont think any promoter chooses to throw an
event depending on what else is going on that night... 
Get along. or else it(the scene) will fall apart.... and about the comment
that UG's should be on weekdays.... Hello??? Don't people work during the
week? Go to school? isn't the weekend when we unwind and party?

greetings from across space =)

im writing this message to let everyone know that the Ion Exchange is 
open. we are located at 765 cedar st suite 102 in Santa Cruz. (408)454.9976
we carry psychedelic trance/ trance/ jungle vinyl, CDs, and mixtapes - 
Spacetribe and Silver Palm Leaf clothing.
***			
four months ago, five friends opened this 
record store in santa cruz. these four months have brought their share of 
trials, stresses, obstacles, adventures, and experience. during some 
rather adverse times, when faced with situations neither of us have 
ever encountered in their lives, some of us decided to leave. at this 
point it wasnt evident wether we could continue or not.

a core of us remained to hold together the vision. that core, 
along with a few new members, has spent the last two weeks restructuring 
the framework of the business. among many things, this includes a much 
larger selection of music.

each one of us has concluded that this vision is much to awsome to let go 
of, and to the best of our abilites we intend to continue to channel this 
very beautiful and powerful music - which has literally changed our lives 
- into downtown santa cruz. 


the Ions.

What is this? I am gone for a day or so, and everyone is picking on Ray
Vonie agian! Oh. 
While were all telling what we think. I think people should reach out more
if they want something. I think people should get to like one another
before they get to fighting. I think Jeffrey Dahmer will remain behind
bars. I think Terry Mullan is a no show at Nikita Friday night. I think UG
ravEs are better than Massives because people have no corners to hide in
when they want to talk shit, making shit talking at a low. I think it's
12:36 and time for bed.


You know?
Thats what I think nStuff. And lemme tell yea, I don't think that often.

Listen.

Why I am getting involved in this, well, i don't really know.  but im
typing, so i guess you're reading, we've got a little somethin goin here...

Yanno, when this thread first started, I made an assumption based upon
something i heard secondhand.  And what have i been trying to do all these
years?  Never make assumptions based upon what you have heard, Tony!  What
an idiot I was!  Oh my god.  I assumed that massive promoters were trying
to bust up @spire so they could put more $ in their pockets.  Vlad is right
in saying that this might not be true.

However...

If it IS true, whoever is doing that is making some really bad business
practices.  Worried that they're not going to have enough.  That's what it
would be if it were a massive promoter calling the cops on an UG party.
Why bad business?  Because if they were throwing truly good parties where
you pay $15 or $20 and get a good party in exchange, why would you have to
worry about 3 or 400 kids not attending your shindig?  Worried about that
extra ten thousand dollars?  why?  you're not guaranteed to get those
people.  they may not want to pay $25.  but if you are producing a good
product, people will buy it like hotcakes.  trust me.  people will start
sayin, ' i wanna go to this massive cause they throw good parties.'  basics
and the gathering has that reputation.  some others are getting there, they
just need to tune their engines a bit.

you see, there is one thing that maybe the massive people might want to
understand about the UG people.  I defintely am more of an UG person,
myself, so I don't know if I would accurately portray the point of view of
a massive promoter, but i might try after i portray the UG side.

UG people, in their extreme, from my observations, are very unmotivated by
money and glitz.  They may not want to be around the big crowd.  So
everyone with their belief systems being different, the average person in
America today when they are confronted by something that attacks their
belief system gets pretty defensive.  We have not been taught as a society
to look at the other person's point of view first.  We have been taught
that we have to be right.  Think about it.  why does everyone have to prove
they are right till they're blue in the face?

but anyway, we have these 2 schools of thought here the UG's are saying
screw the massives (on the extreme) and the massives are saying the UG's
should courteously move aside whenever the massive people want to throw a
party and just understand they need the money.

as rodney king would say, "can't we all get along here?"  i mean really.
there has to be some happy medium.  unless you guys like fighting on email.


personally i think that the scene is big enough now to support a lot of
different events going on in one night.  if you people started spending
your energy on working together instead of pointing fingers at each other
(by the way, when you point the finger at someone, 3 fingers are pointing
back toward YOU) imagine how much better things could be!  I always have
trouble believing that anyone would be just motivated to sit there and
bicker.

well that's enough.  im just throwing this out there. im convinced that if
there were one of those valued brain to MIDI interfaces, like we could all
just plug into each others brains and understand what each others points of
views are and start working together instead of against each other.

but there is something almost as good as a brain to MIDI interface.

Listening.

Try it.

It's not easy.

Sometimes we think we're listening but we're not.

Everyone has a right to their opinion.

There are some valid points in this thread, it would be good to read the
whole thing again.

dEEp

its funny that you come from a long line of entrepeneurs, cause i'm startin
a long line of entrepeneurs. my goal in life is to help other people
achieve their goals.

one thing about the word 'free'.  it is good to have free things offered to
people.  to a point.  sometimes when free stuff is just given and given and
given, people stop appreciating it.  at free parties there should be some
type of exchange encouraged.  passing around the trash bags.

but not expecting, though, becausxe the best type of  giving is
unconditional.  and sometimes it's nice to come to a party, and just party
and not have to worry about anything.  but just kep in mind that when you
come to a party, someone spent their time and money so YOU could have a
good time.  so just respect it.

free but respect.

All of a sudden, I am getting a ton of SPAM to this account, which I only

getting it as well. I am trying to figure out which mailing list is the

Wait a sec...freekin to trance music is a ***WONDERFUL*** thing to do! 
To me, that is what the core of raving and getting in touch with my
consciousness in all about.

Sorry for the analness, I know that is probably not what you meant.

ok guys.... the only reason I brought up the thing about ug's and
massives is to understand it better.... it's understood now and I don't
wanna see you guys flaming vlad for what he said... he was just trying
to help me understand what's going on. and he has. I don't think he
meant to say what he said the way you guys took it. he's a cool guy and
throws some of the best massives in the scene. FGE was talked about by
so so many of the ug kids as a really good massive, and I've heard a lot
of good about him as a person in the underground scene. I just don't
wanna get too deep into a flame war. Discusion is one thing, but going
off is something else. I'm not saying that I agree or disagree in what
his origional post said that started this whole thing, but I think it's
time to either take this into personal one on one email, or drop the
subject in it's entirty... all in all I really really really don't want
a war between ug and massives, there are reasons there are both and
there is good and bad in both. People have a preferance and that's why
different kinds of parties are important in the scene as a whole. We are
the rave scene.... we love the music, the people, and the vibe. We try
to melt it together as a whole, but it's impossible. Our diversity is
what makes our scene unique and special.

peace and love to all you yoots!

Hey, y'all!

I had an idea (alert the media!): since the love thread got so much
response (should've posted mine to da list, too), what say we take
it a step further, and, in the spirit of this list, expand the topic to
how love, as we've been defining it, fits the whole raving thang?
Just a thought.
Love and peace to all,
Eric

One of few good posts I have read concerning the whole Vlad thing. Personally
I chose not to get involved originally, because I didn't feel i needed to be
a part of a flaming match, I'm just not that way. The real point is that we
all have different values and views on life and all the subjects contained in
it, and we need to be considerate of others' views as well, if we are to
obtain the peace we so long for. So, my only statement is this: Look
objectively, because it's the only way we know how; Listen wholeheartedly, as
we have learned that it is the best way, and; Respond considerately, because
otherwise we are not creating, but destroying, which is the complete opposite
of what we are trying to accomplish....
Just a thought, from me to you....

P.S. This is NOT directed at anyone personally, since I didn't read but two
or three of the posts involved, just some insight to all that are out
there....

NO!!

i think it is our responsibility to offer these kids an ALTERNATIVE. 
A safer, more creative environment.  If we just kept going to ALL the
massives then there would be no alternatives for people to go to.  I
mean sure there are some massives that i would go to....but these are
becoming more and more scarse.

the underground is here for a reason.....or reasons.

Here are some.

--selfless and creative promoters that are willing to GIVE to and not
just take from the party goers.
--provide a cheap and safe place for people to go
--promote values and individuality
--promote "other" types of music that u don't always get to hear at
massives.  i.e. techno, trance, trip-hop, d&b....etc.etc.

The UG's are here for a reason and us "old-skoolers" support them for
a reason.  Hell...personally i've been through the cycle of massives
and UG's and i mostly go to UG's for a reason...i feel more
comfortable there.  I went to massives for a long time...but they just
can't offer me what the UG can.  I think that is why a LOT of "old and
new skoolers" end up in the UG.

okay...enough rambling.

Is this for real, or someone's twisted idea of a joke? When exactly
this weekend is this happening? I'd love to see garth spin in the
glorious outdoors (i like dancing in fresh air, no cigarrette smoke, no
recycled lung-goobers from tubercular tweakers , no B.O., no
humidity...)

How do these go off without getting busted?? Is Safeway allowing this
to happen? (it's not a bad idea -- they could sell water, soft drinks
and snacks and increase their income significantly from all those
thirsty, hungry, dancing ravers).

Anyways, please let us all know if this is really happening, when it is
happening, and keep us posted on future dates as well.

Thanks.

>If you have a choice of E or GHB...why not the E?

	I'm totally straight-edge, myself. But I have to say that I
would choose to use GHB before E. Why? Because GHB is a substance that
already occurs naturally in the body, and is fully metabolized by the
body when ingested (it doesn't leave any toxic residues hanging around).
It is also legal, which means that it is possible to get pure GHB of
known strength (you have to get it mail-order from overseas). 

	If I were to decide to use this (which isn't really likely),
I'd certainly experiment with dosages in the safety of my home before
attempting this at any kind of party. And I would get religious about
not mixing it with anything - not even a joint or a beer. Of course,
that's easy for me since I don't use those things anyway.

	Even pure GHB has this weird property that it acts like a
stimulant in low dosages, a downer in higher dosages, and knocks you out
at even higher dosages. I'd probably look for the stimulant effect mostly,
but sometimes you just want to take a nap and that pounding bass makes
it really tough ...

I don't prefer neither, 

 But.. If someone actually said they prefer GHB over E. My opinion would be
because it doesn't last as long. Kind of like how some people like to fry,
but not for eight hours straight.


 Ok, venturing forth now.

To love is to suffer. To avoid suffering one must not love, but then one
suffers from not loving. Therefore, to love is to suffer, not to love is to
suffer, to suffer is to suffer. To be happy is to love, to be happy then is
to suffer but suffering makes one unhappy, therefore to be unhappy one must
love or love to suffer or suffer from too much happiness.

Have you ever complained about the price of something? Like the price of
a massive or UG? Or the price of an 1/8 of green or E? Then you "give a
fuck" about economics.

Economics effects us all. A good economy is what makes it possible for
people to have excess money to spend on records so they can become DJs
so we can have raves in the first place.

and a white visor , and something that says fila on it.

Subject: UGs, Massives & Church
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.org
Precedence: bulk

I had a dream last night that there was a town with ten churches, and the
Baptist Church, which was small and had little money, got upset because the
Catholic Church was spending so much on its new building that some of the
parishoners actually wanted to go to Mass to experience the opulence, which
would mean even less money in the collection bowls.  

Then the Christian Scientists anonymously called the building inspector to
report a possible hazard in the Unitarian Church, and when he came and shut
down the church on Sunday morning, they were there handing out directions to
the Reading Room.  

Meanwhile, the Seventh Day Adventists were issuing press releases with
unsubstantiated and unverified rumors about how the Methodists were
underdeclaring the money received in the collection each week, and the Jews
were holding a meeting to see if they could keep the Buddhists next door
from chanting during Friday night services, because the noise disturbed them.

Thankfully, I woke up, knowing that dream was ridiculous because truly
spiritual people would never behave that way, because they know that all
beliefs deserve respect, and that if you don't respect other's right to
believe differently than you, then you're missing the point.

Then I checked my email, and what a nightmare.  The church of the massive
was being attacked through innuendo by the church of the free-beach-party,
and the church of the old-school-underground was being attacked by the
church of the massive, and the church of the old-school-underground
retaliated with some "he-said-she-said" accusations of its own.

As a "churchgoer" who considers herself a contributing member of all of
these "religions," this is so disturbing.

This is yet another example of how divisiveness hurts our scene as a whole.
Certainly we can't expect that all promoters have the same motivations and
priorities.  But, in a scene that theoretically is based on a shared love of
music and dance and the coming-together of like-minded people, it would seem
obvious that learning to respectfully work together is a priority of the
highest order.

Nobody "owns" this scene.  Nobody has a "right" to stop someone else from
throwing a party on any particular night.  And *nobody* has a right to make
slanderous and libelous statements in a public forum without substantiating
them.  

How about let's leave the rumor and innuendo to the tabloids, and act like
responsible and admirable adults, giving others the respect that we would
like to receive from them.  

If anyone thinks that the only way they can "succeed" is to try to get
someone else to "fail" ... or that they can only be right by making someone
else wrong... then think again.  

The real way to success is by *being* successful, by behaving in an honest
and pure way, by considering the effect of your actions on others, and by
being the kind of person who is worthy of respect.  Show that you are worthy
of being treated with respect through every action, every word, every deed.

The way to have other promoters respect your party is by respecting them,
and respecting their events.  When conflicts arise, talk about it, try to
work it out.  Sabotage is never acceptable, whether it's by anonymous phone
calls complaining about a "competitor's" party, or by posting
unsubstantiated rumors on SFRaves. 

If you're a promoter in this community, then you have a responsibility to
set and maintain high standards of behavior.  We all win when those
standards are met, and we all lose when petty ego-driven issues get in the
way.  

Optimistically,

Leslie

no, it means you have to wear a dress.  it'll be cute.  and since they
provide security, you can give your bodyguard the night off.  unless you
look *really* good in a dress, in which case bring her along for some extra
protection.

i don't know if you have been really reading the posts or just looking at
the subject and getting pissed off.  people are not bitching about people
overdosing or selling dope, or going to massives to pick up girls or
whatever.   people are not stereotyping "those people" at massives. 
people are just pissed of that vlad thinks that people should not throw
free parties on the same night as massives out of some kind of "respect"
that vlad thinks many massive promoters have earned in HIS mind.  try to
figure out the root of the discussion before you go off on a tanget that
has nothing to do with the discussion.   no one is trying to stereotype
people.  what we are talking about is wether people should have to step
aside every saturday nite so some fat cat can make a killing charging $25
+bass charges just because no one can go to any other kind of party that
nite.   people are not dissing the crowd at massives.

did you read the posts or were you just getting pissed of because you saw
the same subject over and over?

and another thing why is it chickenshit to not want to hand over $ 20 to
get into a party if there is nothing there for you.  I will pay $20 for a
party that is fat enough but why should someone keep going to massives if
they are not having fun?    You talk about it like it is our
responsibility to "keep going to these parties".  well some of us never
went to that many massives in the first place.  living in santa cruz i
was lucky. i could go to full moon every month so i didn't feel like in
order to have a good time i had to hand over my$20 just like all the
other 5000 people in line.   some people like the more intimate vibe that
little parties offer.   no one is "responsible" for giving someone else
money if they don't want to.     thats what we are talking about. choice.
 according to vlad people should not have the choice to go to a free
party on a saturday night.  do you think that is right?

peace

Nod Nod, I agree, now can we all just be friends? Kiss and make up or
something?! I'm gettin sick of all this UG Vs. Massive thing. Different
people like different things, and that's all there is to it. If you don't
like it, then don't be a part of it. We aren't getting anything done bitching
amongst ourselves. Just a thought....

   ghb is less harsh on your body, and cheaper... and the quality of e
goes up and down all the time, and is almost as unpredictable as ghb,
although the likely hood of an extasy OD is very unlikely, it does more
damage to your body than ghb does. If you could measure the doseage of
ghb and know how much your body can handle... ghb would be one of the
safest drugs out there. =)

Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.org

Okay, after this I'll shut up.

1.  Yes, I was wayyyyy off topic w/ my post.  Going off on my tangent.  But I 
don't think there would have been _as much_ fuss about what Ray said if he 
said "UG parties shouldn't be on the same night as each other" or if he was a 
UG promoter.  I think a lot of people on this list have a lot of hostility 
towards massives and I wanted to address that.  If you look at the posts 
you'll notice that they say things like "if I was a UG promoter I'd make sure 
my events were on the same days as massives so only the true ravers would come 
out" or "I just don't like to go to massives."  If this doesn't reflect bad 
feelings towards massives, I don't know what does.  I felt something had to be 
said about that, even if I was off topic.

2.  You don't have to go to massives.  You don't have to pay $20 to go to a 
party you don't think you can have fun at.  You don't have to do anything.  
But don't complain about the way massives are if you aren't even trying to 
make them any better.  And don't complain when "those people" that go to 
massives start coming to the UG parties.  Because they will.  And then you 
won't have to pay $3 to go to a UG party you don't think you can have fun at.  
You can stay at home.

3.  Back on the topic--I was appalled at some of the posts directed at Ray.  
Regardless of how true anything you said might have been, you had no business 
posting it to the list.  Those posts merely expressing disagreement were fine, 
but personal attacks don't belong on the list.  Act your age.


But that's just my opinion, and I'm pretty damn sure not everyone agrees.  I 
could be wrong.  Go figure.  I'll shut up and let this thread die now.

xoxo--Miccaela

I know that we are all lost in the nostalgia of the old days, but don't you
think that 5 years is long enough to carry on a thread. 

Every possible argument about undergrounds vs. massives has been stated,
there are no winners, there are no losers, go where you want to go. Why
can't we all just get along?

I'm over it...

toodles... we'll do lunch!

Five listings for Friday and eight for Saturday (not including the weeklies)
makes for a good selection.  Actually, a lot of them are outside of
San Francisco, or feature new DJs or different kinds of music, so there's
a lot of diversity too.  Being a cancer, I might stop by the Top Friday night,
and The Mist on Saturday is a great chance to see the Technics really 
being worked.

At this intersection there will be a strip mall-thing on your left.
Many of the signs are written in english and again in some Asian language.
Go to the big red sign that reads

1: i just picked up this cd - by a group called 'the egg' - i actually saw
them live back in austin - really fabulous - funky, jazzy, and some sort of
808 state-ish sounding stuff. highly recommended.

2: as long as ppl are polling about things, i have a poll:

        i currently freelance for a magazine called _soma_ and we're sort of
        re-working things there. our target audience is 20-35, and i'm
curious -
        what do ppl like to read about? they're printing a lot of fluff right
        now, and i know that the mag could be so much better... so i'm
        wondering: what sorts of things make you pick a mag up? (other than
        techno) what interests you, and what do you actually read?

3: on the same note, we're looking to get a new pool of writers (all sorts
- commentary, journalistic, fiction, poetry, music, theater, dance, art and
movie reviews, you name it, i'm interested in checking it out). i'm also
looking to develop a pool of photographers (to cover several things -
clubs, fashion, documentary - i'm hoping to run some photo essays, and just
someone to go out and shoot things that we need shots of!). also, we need a
pool of illustrators. interested? email me privately.

4: and as long as ppl are selling things, i've got a 270mg syquest that i
have absolutely no use for. do any of you? i'll give you a good deal for
it....

cheers! and thanks in advance for any help!

Who is Smiles?  Did some DJ take my name?  How dare they use my name to
spread the good vibes and beautiful beats to people...  Just kidding.
Anyway... Mark, I'd like to see this shindig of yours materialize.
Sounds like a beautiful place to frolic in utter bliss... But really,
who is Smiles?

Well, I'm not actually going to try to define such a concept that is
defined differently by each individual for his or herself.  Love means
too many things to count, much less try to put into one single
all-encompassing framework.  Love just is, and despite its diversity in
practice and meaning, there is one thing I will say about it that I
think everybody would agree on.  Love is beautiful.
                                       ~  Julie Mae
By the way, I felt like including a quote below that I thought was
appropriate:

"Love gives not but itself and takes not but from itself.
 Love possesses not nor would it be possessed;
 For love is sufficient unto love."  ~ Khalil Bibran

massive undergrounds in the enchanted forest

When you plant lettuce, if it does not grow well,
you don't blame the lettuce. You look for reasons
it is not doing well...it may need fertilizer, or more
water or less sun. You never blame the lettuce.
Yet if we have problems with our family, we blame
the other person...But if we know how to take care
of them they will grow well,like the lettuce. Blaming has
no positive effect at all, nor does trying to persuade
using reason and arguments.

No blame,no reasoning, no argument, just understanding.

if you understand and you show that you understand
you can love and the situation will change.

I agree with the first part of this. If Ray had said that UG's shouldn't
be on the same night, he wouldn't have gotten as much flak. But there
is a definite reason behind this. What you are seeing is resentment of the
sentiment he is expressing because of the fairly obvious reasoning behind
it, that is that he feels that UG's are cutting into profits, or
somehow "messing with" his parties.

If you look at the responses, I think it is pretty obvious that they are
sarcastic retorts to the assine statement that UG's should be on the
weekdays as to not interfere with the massives. Sarcasm can sometimes be
hard to catch via this medium.

*MY* biggest problems with "massives"(read high $$$ parties) is virtually
all of them make claims to be about things or causes other than their
primary mission which is to turn a profit. If the promoters of these
parties were honest, I would have *0* and I mean *0* problems with these
parties and the people behind them. Instead you get a bill of goods about
how the party is about togetherness, bringing all types of different
people together to share in some awe-inspiring spirtual mindfuck that will
change them forever, or for some cause or another which some unknown and
undisclosed amount or percentage of their profits are going to, etc. etc.
ad nauseum. All of this is secondary to their primary goal which is to
make money. As long as these types of deceptions continues, I will always
speak out against the promoters that engage in this behaviour and parties
they throw. I would hate the thought that some unwitting person would
believe that they would have to spend $25 to have a good time at a party
with the diversity and quality of many of the low-cost parties around...

My, we are most demanding aren't we? If "those people" are the same
clueless fucks that tag, steal other peoples' things, O.D. on 15 different
drugs and expect someone else to deal with their sorry asses, *THEY* can
stay at home.

Rather you think it belongs on the list or not, I am going to relate the a
couple of things that really struck me negatively in a conversation that
Ray and I had via email the last time a similar subject came up and I got
into it with him. Perhaps others have had conversations with him, or
know things that explain the reaction and the statements of others. I can
only speak for myself:

Ray made a statement that a particular party he was throwing was a 
"partial proceed" to some charity. I asked him what percentage. He refused
to tell me, and used many of the same "you don't know me so how can you
talk shit about me" arguments that he made this time around with other
folks. After several rounds of back and forth, Ray said that if I came to
the party, he would tell me just how much he was donating to charity.
READ: I would have to pay him the price of admission($20 or $25 I forget)
for him to tell me what percentage or amount he was donating to charity. I
can't say I hold too high of an opinion of Ray, but it is for a reason. A
reason, not some rumor that a friend of a friend heard. 

Ray, if you have another take on the exchange, and/or think I am being
unfair, please share your thoughts with us. I have the emails, and would
be happy to post them to the list with your permission of course. And
spare me the alligator tears....

This whole massives vs ug's thing is another discussion from the past.
Funny how some things will never die.  And beleive me, we'll be discussing
this again sooner than we all expect.  With that in mind, I really didn't
mind Ray's comments.  I thought, from my reading that what he was proposing
was not just some edict to boycott or tell people what to do, although it
could have easily been construed that way.

I saw it more in light of a conversation I had with a prominent promoter
some time ago when I first got involved in SF UG/dance Culture.  I was in
wonderment at all the "competition".  I mean, parties going on all at the
same time, double booking of Dj's , the whole thing.  I also remember
mentioning to this person how great it would be if the promoters cooperated
more.  This promoter replied "I tired, but people just won't give up thier
ego's.  It'll never work."  The translation, which I found out much later
was "Hey, you're right, people should move thier parties since I'm throwing
one.".  I knew then I understood what all of this was about, at least for
some people.

Anyway I think the best way to foster something that you like is to either
support those events that emobody the ideals you have within yourself, or
start a party with your ideals in mind.  Simple, if Ray want's to start a
trend, then let him step forth and do so, I aks any others who have such
notions to do likewise.  That is the only way to change things often
enough, it starts with you.

As for promises on flyers and the general bullshit of "flyer philosophy", I
pay about as much attention to that as Willie Brown's promises (how things
change over time, eh?).  It's just an advertisement wrapped up and
disguised as good will, all for the sake of your dollar, and often, all too
often, that is what all of this boils down to.  Yep, people do it for love,
no doubt, but few and far between are those who would sacrifice thier
earnings and material wealth consistently to make others happy.  And free
parties DO cost money...everything costs money, nothing is free.

Even if one were to do a series of freebies, who is going to spin that will
attract the hundreds that may be down for a free party? (there have been
free parties thrown, and since there are no "name" Dj's nobody shows up)
Dj's personality is at an all time high, and the premium is steep
(although, dig this, MUCH CHEAPER than the heyday).  But there is always
fresh talent and there will alwys be people who want free, it's human
nature (although you get what you pay for often enough).  Now if someone
wishes to point out Sunset as an example, the guys who play at that party
are working DJ's who have no other obligations on that day.  True
selflessness is hard to find in our very capitalist society.  It is
impractical in this system.  Although quite doable.

As for specific days, i understand.  The weekend is money time, and to many
people's suprise there are PLENTY of DJ's who have to support families and
themselves.  Free parties destroy that capability to support themselves
while making others happy.  To me this is the one part of our society where
you are actually getting something for very few $$$'s.  $25 for a party?
Big f-ing deal.  Break it down by hours, let's say 8 hours you're talking
$3.15 per hour.  That is CHEAPER than going to the movies ($3.75/hour),
cheaper than a good dinner here in the city (I never eat cheap), cheaper
than E (which at $20/hit lasts about 4 hours you're talkling $5/hour). The
scene is a part of a larger capital driven machine and it acts accordingly.
I'm over the too expensive, or the other cost concerns.  People need to pay
because the money is not only going into the pocket of promoters (who often
get paid last), but to those people who bring us joy and can only do it by
spending cashish, the DJ.  So I can dig, from a certain perspective why Ray
might feel like this or anyone else who may make money via dance culture.
The weekend is payday, and that is how most of the DJ community lives.

So if he or anyone else wants to start a trend, they are welcome, throw a
series of freebies during the week, then do your money weekend, and good
luck.  It is certainly no worse than the calls for boycotts because of $'s,
and you get your dream realized, maybe.

Tangent (as if I'm just arriving at one): If you can't afford the $$$'s it
takes to go out, there are alternatives; cheaper parties, or no partying at
all, just getting together  with some other friends and chilling listening
to music and talking.  Now that's just as good as boom boom for 8 hours.
Sometimes ;).

Well, I'm done, poke me with a fork.

Much peace,
John

P.S.  BTW, I am one of those who thinks that if you really feel that way,
then fine, do something about it.  As for how others should act & do?  Set
the example and maybe others will follow.  Over and audi...

Or maybe we can blame the 40 foot high rutebega that's blocking the sun,
or the soldiers who put salt in the ground, or the dog that always sits
on it... or maybe it's just crappy lettuce.

I think massives and micros and UGs and beach parties and beer busts and
frat parties can all peacefully coexist.  I know the large crews look out
for each other's dates, I know the small crews look out for each other's
events when possible, and as long as we keep the intentions good we'll be
fine.  I believe the point was made that we've seen some bad intentions,
so we need to go past idealism and see if there's a way to deal with it.

Just to clear the air, Vlad was never the person suspect by the @spire
crew of tampering with them.  I think we've seen some good points all
around, and I'd hate this to be viewed in retrospect as another massive
vs. UG war, because it's about as useful as another round of tastes great
vs. less filling.  The point was about the ethics of people throwing
parties, and we got some interesting insights.  I for one learned a
little.

> No blame,no reasoning, no argument, just
understanding. > 

Sounds like a nice dream.  Too bad that without blame, many people would
act very irresponsibly, without reasoning nothing would make any sense
other than that dictated by those who know what's "best for us",
and without arguement there would be no consensus (which is what our more
beautiful collectives run by).

> if you understand and you show that you understand
> you can love and the situation will change.
> 

And you can walk into the slaughterhouse knowing that nice man who feeds
you would never think of hurting you.

We need to keep our ideals, while still maintaining a degree of self
protection.  It would be nice to tell the police that "yes, this is a
rave, but it's a carefully thrown rave", but we can't.  We just lost a
location that way recently...

In the real world, there is bad intent, there is greed, and there is
distrust.  Only by being aware and dealing with the outside world can we
be effective in creating environments that are outside of those
influences.

The defenders of the faith live with a foot in each world,and their heads
teetering between.  We don't get spaces by going on about how beautiful
this warehouse will be with tons of people dancing about (usually), we get
them by waving money.  The trick is letting the dream of collective
consciousness, natural peace and the beauty of dance navigate their
actions, and not the material concerns of the "other side".

A tip of the hat to the partythrowers who don't suck, regardless of how
big or small their parties are.

Peace,
AndyW

Hello everyone.  I think that this thread has been beat down soo much that
everything that has been said has been said already.  But, Just to add a
bit of my perspective, I'd like to say this...  I'm one of those nutty folx
that LIKE to help, set up and tear down an event.  I enjoy staying pretty
much sober in the case of cops dropping by and having to act fast to keep
em from finding us or if a speaker goes out, EQ dies, whatever.  I enjoy
running with different crews, both established and up-in-coming...  Both
Massives and UG's.  But eventhough I enjoy helping, DJing and dancing @
such events.  I'm still wary and selective as to which crews I assoicate
myself with...

Why?

Because of thier true intentions of throwing a party.  Im a promoter too.
Like Jer, Vlad, Greg, Ethan, Leslie and the soo many others that pepper
thier post with either blainant or hidden BSPs.  And I'll usually promote
the parties I just GO to and have no association with as well.  But when a
promoters eyes are opened as to WHY a crew is throwing this party to do
such and such instead of this or that...  Well it getts hazy and confusing.
I remember seeing a few newbe crews out there that once they see the cash
flow in...  Well prioirites change.  And once the scene figures this out,
the backlash can be severe.
Other crews have to get rid of "Stuff" and so the party is built around the
dispensions of such items. Some parties are thrown for the sheer beauty of
danicing and listening to kick ass DJ's spin kick ass music. And some
people are out to make a name for themselves or thier crew.

You know what I say....

It's summer.  Fuck it. Go out, have a ill time.  True partygoers,
scensters, ravers... you KNOW where the real party is @...  Be it at
_ORBIT_, _LETTIUCE DANCE_ , _WALLY WORLD_ or _TRAINWRECKS ON THE BEACH_.  A
massive warehouse full of screaming dancers or a house party with 20 or so
people.  You create that vibe withing you, and whatever you do that vibe
will express itself.  If someone is F***ing with you, then deal.  I've been
threatend with arrest, hidden in a dumpster, watch (Helplessly) as a tide
almost washed away a sound system "oh I guess the tide didn't come in yet
after all...".
And the most recently was the snafu of trying to move all the wires from a
burnt out surge strip to another surge strip...  DURING THE MIDDLE OF A
PARTY (talk about pressure).

But to any of those big time producers out there that feels to be compelled
to "toy" with undergrounds, well what is rightfully derserved will come to
you.  Secrets in the scene do not stay secret for too long....

And on a lighter note... All of those involved with Rebel Alliance Sound
(or who want to be)...  Drop me a lil note.  It looks like a nice space has
opened up and the accounting dpartment is telling me that I can live my
life again off or Top Ramen for another two months after another party...

Possibly, The logic of that statement is flawed, but have you ever *really*
wondered about that? I think it's actually more crucial that those events
that *can* pay their DJ's actually do so. *That* is more important to keeping
things fresh in the scene while the promoter uses his/her money wisely so
that they can continue to provide quality events(whether free or paid) in the

But please consider this:

 We're supposed to be experiencing a boom in our economy, the likes of which
analysts havent seen since the post-WWII era, right? The dollar is very
strong world wide against everything(with the exception of the Deutsch Mark,
I think). If this is true, then it may follow logically that if I live in
this country, not only will I have more money to spend(if I have any money at
all, that is!), but will things will be cheaper to buy, especially things
that come from outside the US.

So, here's my question: WHY IN THE F**K AM I STILL SPENDING UPWARDS OF $11
SOMETIMES TO PURCHASE *ONE* 12'' SINGLE? Every DJ/import record collector on
this list knows exactly what I'm talking about here. You have to be born
eyeless to miss the fact that import record prices have gone through the roof
in the past couple of years, while domestic prices have only gone up a little
bit. And what makes me particularly suspicious is the fact that I go to
different record shops and see the same records being sold for totally
different prices. For example, I was at a well-known, immaculately kept
record store in SF last week. There was a 2x12''  import on the Defender
label called "It's a DJ Thing pt 5." The price tag was $13.99. A few days
later, I was in Berkeley at a record store known for it's um...urges(?) and
the very same record was $23.99!

I worked at a distributor I know what happens to the records and how much
they cost before they get to the retail outlet. Can someone provide an answer
as to why when I used to go to buy imports they were $8.99 and now can be up
to $11.99, and why back in the days, domestic singles cost me $4.99 and now
cost $5.99? Am I barking up the wrong tree or what?

i have to totally agree with monty here.....i have to actually put off
some other expenses JUST so i can buy records.  I have like a $40-60 a
week record habit and it's killing me.  I get like 3-5 records now
when i used to get and get 6-10 for around the same price.  It's
ridiculous.

The problem is that they have us (well atleast me) by the b*lls.  I
mean...what choice do i have...not buy records anymore???

I have, however, come up with 1 solution.  And that is to buy used
records...i now spend $0.95 to $3.95 per record and am quite happy. 
Sure, i may not get all the *new* stuff all the time...but i've found
some kick-ass used records.

one broke dj.....

                     BBQ & BEATS Campout
August 8th - 10th   Fri, 11pm  to  Sun 6pm
DJ's for the weekend will be, in no particular order..

Main Area
BioJeff, Joe Rice, Monty, Henrik, Goldilox, Tom, Greg Sandler, Matt Schmitt
Li, James, Vertigo, Siphon, Andy W, Science, Micron, Stillwind, Macadio,
Todd Manley, Forrest Green, Knucklehead, Jonathan, DJ, Fat Tony..and more TBA

Ambient/Chill Area
C-Lab, Dionysus Dreams, Lola, Jon Logan..and more TBA


        The BBQ & BEATS crew would like to offer you a choice. If you
attend our campout and bring your own food to eat, then you can come enjoy
the weekend for free. If you'd like the BBQ & BEATS crew to feed you, then
we are asking for a $10 donation that goes toward your food. You'll have a
choice between ribs, chicken, hamburgers, hot dogs, or veggie burgers or
veggie hot dogs, and maybe even some spaghetti and stir fry, some kind of
salad and another side dish as well as a soft drink. If we do the spaghetti
and stir fry, there will be vegan friendly servings of spaghetti and stir
fry also. This should make the veggie and meat eaters both happy.

We will also be flippin pancakes, eggs, and potatoes for Saturday and
Sunday breakfast. With the main meal going for most of the afternoon on
Saturday until it starts getting dark.  If you don't get the ticket that
includes meals and would like to have the breakfast we cook. Alittle
donation to help cover cost will be great during the campout. But we won't
turn you down for breakfast food, unless we run out of course.  The main
meal will cost much more and we ask if you plan on eating the main meal
too, then we suggest a donation of $10 to cover cost, but we do encourage
you to get the ticket for meals before the campout so we can plan and have
the correct amount of food for those with the tickets for meals. We will
have two tickets available soon. One for people bringing there own food and
one for people wanting to eat the food we bring.

We have thrown several free daytime parties with lots of food for all to
enjoy for free.  We would love to do this for the Campout, but 2 days worth
of food for everyone can be expensive, not including other cost for
throwing this event.

So the choice is yours, let us cook for you, we ask for a $10 donation to
buy your food. You supply your own food, then come and enjoy for free.

Tickets will be available shortly,  again there will be two different
tickets. One for those wanting us to cook, and the other will be for those
bringing there own food.

We hope to see as many of you come and enjoy the weekend with us. We will
be sending out info about how to get your tickets soon.  We will also have
an info number to get the details shortly, so keep your eyes and ears open.

In the meantime, feel free to check out the BBQ & BEATS Homepage
(http://www.bbq-beats.org) for any updates. We will soon put up the details
about the tickets and how we will work out the food. If you have any
questions feel free to ask.

We thank you for all your support on our past events and hope you can come
out and spend the weekend with us.

Take care...

The record prices are adjusted for inflation *8^)...I really don't think 
there is more to it then that and maybe a little rise in demand...but 
then again, that could also be due to Inflation-Higher Wages-I can buy more 
records-Demand records increases-retail stores think "Hey, we can charge 
more money for records"-inflation .......etc


Stay Cool!

Hi My name is Macadio and I am a Vinyl Addict!!!

I hear you guys on that one it seems like I am trying to buy more and
more rekkids each week. But good thing for me is that the Metallic
industrial Tekno that I like to play is kind of rare with the
exception of Missle rekkids which I hate. So for me it is hard to find
good rekkids One thing I have noticed is for me the Prices have been
just about the same with the exception of $1 like for instance the
store I shop at come to think of it they should make me a co owner
cause I spend so  much in there Solid Grooves I can get a rekkid there
for like $10.90 and see it in the city for $11.90 So I have not really
noticed any real price gouging. That is just what I have noticed.

Peace,
Macadio

hello to all my fellow $BROKE$ d.j.'s out there,

i have a suggestion that y'all might be interested in.  get a business
licence for your dj services. the cost of the licence is only 50-75
dollars(depending where you are). with this you can:

1. order direct thru distributers(nemisis,intergroove, watts, etc.)
	a. this means you can pick up new wax for 3-6 bucks!
	b. contact the distributers(the #'s are usually on the bottom of the
sleeves) 		   and ask them to send you their faxes. if you have trouble
getting their #'s, e-	   mail me privately and i'll try to help you.
2. use expenses (money spent on records, gas getting to parties, phone calls
to        	promoters,etc.) as tax write off's. the federales give you 1 or 2
years b-4 you 	are supposed to make a profit.

you'll have to pay taxes on any money you make, but payin' taxes on a gig
that you only got a couple bucks for is totally worth the money you'll save.

well, take it easy and happy spinnin',
			stillwind

This event is just going to be too cool to miss. Food, sun and fun in the
forest with a running stream along with fat DJ's pumping out the beats.

Let's get naked and dance y'all - or we could keep our clothes on.

11.90 for 12"'s? Hmm, a bit steep, especially considering that all the
stores pay the same prices... We try to sell stuff for 8.98 and 9.98 at the
store I work at (Drop Beat), with only French imports generally going 10.98
or 11.98. (German and French imports tend to be higher cost than UK
records, with the French being most expensive) The prices charged to stores
tend to vary .50 either way depending on the week and the distributor, but
I haven't noticed a trend towards more higher prices overall...

There are a couple of UK mail order places that can be worthwhile... The
people that do the Juno weekly new release list offer records to the US at
ukp3.75-4.50, or roughly US$6.30-7.60. If you order several records at a
time and can get decent shipping prices it's possible for the total price
of each record to average around $8, not a big reduction, but still
noticeable, and some  of those records don't get picked up by the US
distros. Their published shipping rates are a bit out of hand, so I haven't
ordered them, but I've had good luck with 4th World, a shop in Scotland.

 You know,

 I haven't been a breaker for over 13 years. Except for that phat flair I
desided to pull off at a Space Children party a few months back. Breaking
makes my widdle bones creek. What I really need to be doing over at the
aura reading booth is some sit-ups, or maybe some push-ups. But
unfortunetly, I need to be working on Wednesday. And I work no where near
Palo Alto.  =[..


 But Nikita auta be phat tonight..

You know,

 Your actually right. I do think to much. Sometimes compulsively. And it's
really a bad problem. You can really drown in your thoughts. To the point
where you don't really hear anything people are saying to you. It sucks.
Disorders suck big time.

 I think.

Hey y'all...

I know it's late, and I know that the chances are slim but if there are any
friendly sfravers out there that would want to give me and two of my buds
a ride down to SC for viberation tonight I would be most grateful.  We're nice,
we smell good and we want to DANCE tonight!!  Micron and Li are two of my 
favorite DJs and I'm going to be heartbroken if I miss them.

Gas money - whatever, you got it.

Page me at 415/655-9633 if you can help out.

Peace,

from 101 take University exit toward Palo Alto
take University street down to Middlefield road
turn left on Middlefield road
go down Middlefield until you get to Homer
make a right turn on Homer
Homer is a one way street heading toward Alma
Whole Foods is at the corner of Emerson and Homer
it is about two blocks away from Alma street

hope these are clear

The Facts of Life:

. If at first you don't succeed, skydiving is not for you.

  Deja Moo: The feeling that you've heard this bull before.

. Psychiatrists say that 1 of 4 people are nuts. Check 3 friends.
 If they're OK, you're it.

. It has recently been discovered that research causes cancer in rats.

. Always remember to pillage BEFORE you burn.

  It may be that your sole purpose in life is simply to serve as a
warning
  to others.

  Paul's Law: You can't fall off the floor.

so how many sfravers does it take to change a light bulb

2 old schoolers to tell you how they used to change bulbs back
in the day...

two candy ravers to hug the bulbs and draw glittery smiles on the old 
bulb...is that a gE BuLb?

two spiritual ravers to set the energy and make sure the stars
are correct for making changes

two grouches to post to the list how stupid the whole thing is
and argue about whether massive producers or 
underground producers are better at changing light bulbs.

two aliens to monitor the evolutionary

Did anyone respond to my post regarding the GHB dangling letters on the

and didn't see any of the responses, if there were any.....  Please
re-post (privately is fine) cause I'd love to hear what you had to say! 

If no one had anything to say about it, that's ok too!  I just wanted to

Nope, but there is a solution to the problem.  Why not get a bunch of us
record geekouts together and , get this, start a company and start buying
our own records.  It's cheaper in the long run (I mean those guys are
getting rekkids @ 3.99 - 4.99, imports are usually going fo 6.99 and up.
That is one solution to the problem, put or financial resources behind one
another to help each other out.  The upside is that not only do we get good
prices, but the promos and white labels will start flowing in like water.
We could then sell these back to record stroes at a gain.  Put the money
BACK into the collective to purchase more choons.  Now I know that most of
these distributors require acertain amount of purchase, but look at this.
If each of us is spending $60/week on records, and there are let's say 10
of us, that is $600 per week.  Any distributor would kill to have that
steady stream of business.

I am 100% down for this solution.  Why?  I work first off, secondly I don't
have time to go around and shop each week, and next the prices get to me
too.  If anyone else is down I think this is a great solution to our
problem.  Anybody up for it?

Just food for thought.

Peace,
John

P.S.  Group economics is the ONLY way to get over these days.  if we team
up and pool our resources to a common end we can all be winners.

hI!  need some imfo . . .

Atari Teenage Riot (ya know, the riot beats band engineered by techno
wizard Alec Empire, with vocals by Carl Crack and Hanin Elias) are going on
tour--I saw a few dates posted on mw-raves for the midwest region.

ATr and Wu Tang Clan will be opening for Rage Against the Machine so it
will probably be in some sort of big auditorium . . . has anybody heard any
imfo on this for dates in the bay area?  ATR was supposed to go on tour
with Beck last spring, but hanin was about to pop out a lil riot beat bAby,
so they either cancelled or cut their tourdates . . . I really want to see
them!!!!!

This situation is a possible catch-22 for people like myself who have been
playing records and getting paid for it since 1989. What if I get audited?
 Will they root out some information that leads them to the conclusion that I
should pay back taxes, retro to 1989? It's a gamble for sure. 

And the business license thing is a good idea, if it could actually work. You
see, I know that when people used to call me when I worked at the shite
record distributor that I was employed at and told me they had a store and
they wanted to start ordering from me, They would fax over a copy of that
business license. Then they would start ordering, but they always got busted
because no individual is gonna do the same type of ordering that a retail
store will. Stores by like 10's and 15's of the same record. Individual DJ's
dont. And as we were relatively lenient on folks who used to run this
scam(because we were so desparate for money in order to pay the people we
owed money to) I know for a fact that people like Watts and Nemesis wont fall
for it. I know legit stores that are having a hard time trying to get these
people's attention, much less getting them to send these very real stores
faxes every week to sell records with.

I'm down to do this like Brutus! It can be done. The only thing is, would we
be able to access more than one distributor ? I'm sure the people involved
enjoy a variety of music. Hell, I'm sure some non-DJ folks who buy CD's and
stuff just for listening at home wouldnt mind getting in on this.

In response to your notion that records are to expensive, one might want 
to take into consideration a couple of issues.

1) In order to keep inventory as current as you buyers expect, we have to 
have records shipped to us fed-ex, or 2nd day UPS. When this is happening 
from the east coast, that can add as much as $1.00 to the price of a record.
Depending on the exchange rate between the dollar and the different 
European currencies, this makes import vinyl as much as $8.00 before it 
even goes to the shelf.

2) The typical mark-up in this business is 50%...about half of the 
mark-up in any other retail business.

3) On top of providing new vinyl every week, most stores provide 
listening stations, which have to be maintained.

4) If you go into a record store and listen to 50 records, but you only 
like 5, you can leave spending about $50. If you were to order 
blind, without the ordering background and experience that we feel we have, the 
ratio of songs you like versus those you don't will probably decrease. My 
point being that in the end it is definitely cheaper to buy from the 
store than to take your chances on random selections off of distributor 
faxes. 

Keep in mind that the record stores you are a bit fed up with are 
supporting our scene as much as anyone else. You get party info from 
them. You see your long lost friends at them...and they allow you to 
perpetuate your biggest addiction.

I've tried the group ordering thing before opening a record store. Some 
weeks it worked out for some people, and other weeks it sucked for 
everyone. In the end, we didn't feel that it was worth while. Try it, and 
maybe your experience will be different. If anything, it might be worth 
jsut getting a deeper look into the working of dance music.

good luck.

E.S.

Well I didn't want to get into this due to well... I'm currenlty working @
a record store now...  But what it sounds like you all want to do is form a
record pool.   It's not too hard to actually do, granted that some NAMES
need to get put on the roster.  What a record pool is (And im sure most of
you know this):
        -Record companies make limited promotinal pressings of all thier
_HOT_ songs (Currently on my hit list is Monacos "What do you want from
me?" trance mix)
        - Selecet copies go to Established Record pools that have DJ's in
various circuts (mainly Clubs and Radio, but mobile DJ's are not uncommon)
to put the tracks on "Heavy rotation" thus allowing the consumer to want
to: see the concert, buy the album, ect.
        -DJ's get into a pool sorta like a fitness membership (Monthy dues
~~90$ or so. Plus startup)
        -DJ's fill out surveies on crowd response and rotation which is
sent back to the record company.

I have many good friends that established the SO-BAD (SOuth Bay Area Dj
Assoc) record Pool in SJ, which consists of djs in radio (Kmel, Ksol, Kllc,
and Kits) as well as club dj's (like Julis Papp and Bad Boy Jess).  Again,
it can be done, and gettin a Phat stack of 20+ records every two weeks
(from domestic labes like Ovum [Wink], Artista [Robert Miles], Nervous,
Elektra [Shamen]) is KEWL too.

But the drawbacks are:  Not every record you get would you play.  Some are
worth less than the vynal it was pressed on.  I've yet to see CD pools
(Sorry CD DJ's). The pool would have to be diverse (else you'd have every
DJ playing the same songs over and over and over and over and over and over
and... well you get the picture.  Usually to get into a record pool the DJ
has to show that he/she's established, and most importantly...  Record
companies tend to want to SEE how the consumer will have access to buy a
finished good (Album).  The last argument tends to kill the prospects of
imports cos many imported tracks don't appear @ , say, Tower or The
Warehouse....

And also A record pool is a bussness.  Many hours are used to establish
contacts, pickup and deliver crates of 12's as well as the mountain (And I
MEAN mountian) of paperwork required to keep the bussness running.

But if you're gonna do it, might as well do it right....

P.S. Sorry to hear about the Viberation thingy...  But it was sorta funny
watching cars zoom back and forth from location to location (Myself
included)  in the wee hrs of the morning...

Not to be blunt but this is exactly what I'm not talking about.  A record
pool is way too much work for people who work (like myself).  I am familiar
with this type of solution and it basically sux.  There is NO GUARANTEE, as
you said, that you will get what you want.  Basically what I want to do is
open a record store without a storefront, whose purpsoe is to get records
cheap.  There would be NO INVENTORY since we would order direct the wax we
want, we would cut out the record store shopping altogehter since we would
be getting exactly what we order, and we would have no overhead, except for
that of yearly taxes.  When divided among 10 people that's about $80/year.
Not bad considering the thousands you save by incorporating and splitting
the costs.

forget the record pool idea.  For less work and hassle it is better to
incorporate.  The other thing is that if some members were so motivated, we
could open our own records store and just add to the competiton.  There's
more flexibility to incorparating, getting a tax id and ordering rekkids
than just forming a record pool which has, at best, mixed results.

Thanks for the input though anakin, greatly appreciated.

BTW for all:  People are becoming millionaries as this stock market keeps
climbing.  I for one am sick of working while the "man" gets rich.  I am
down to use my money this year to make myself some more money or at least
stretch my dollar.  If anyone is interested in forming an investors club to
get in on this hot market, or has a place where they can point me to info
on starting one please get in contact with me via mail and let's get to
work.  I am motivated, have some capital, and am ready to get things moving
asap.  Get in touch.

Peace,
john

No guarantees yet...but it looks like I will be having a little gathering
at my place the evening of True Love (July 26).  For those of you who came
last time, I am at a new location (plus, i had better see you again.)  
This time we will have DJs (Hooray!)  Meeks and Jelo will most likely be
spinninng for your listening pleasure.  

I'll post again as the details fall into place.  Until then, I will continue 
to find creative ways to pass the time until i see you all.      

Just trying to get this town to suck a little less so that I'll stop getting
hickies...

Heee Heee Heee.  I was just thinking of that FREE party that was on
Friday night.  While it was cool seeing old faces and meeting new ones,
it was by far the shortest party I have ever attended.  45 minutes until
the fuzz came and busted it.  Wow!  I was barely able to finish a
cigarette before I had to leave.

Well, it's all good.  It was fun while it lasted.  :o)

Are you joking? Please.....You dont HAVE to have your records shipped Fed-Ex
or 2nd Day UPS. Stores do it because all the other stores do it, not because
they have to or because DJ's demand that they do that.

>>2) The typical mark-up in this business is 50%...about half of the 
mark-up in any other retail business.<<

This doesnt excuse the fact that many people *still* feel as though they're
paying more than they should be for their records, many of which can be
wrought with fingerprints, warped and/or water damaged and still sold as
brand new.

>>3) On top of providing new vinyl every week, most stores provide listening
stations, which have to be maintained.<<

That is a choice the retailer makes. If they want to sell their wax, it's
smart for them 
to provide listening stations. I feel that the listening station thing isnt
essential though.   Why should the patron have to pay for that?  Dont you
think that that should be chalked up as a regular business expense and not be
passed on to the consumer?

>>4) If you go into a record store and listen to 50 records, but you only 
like 5, you can leave spending about $50. If you were to order 
blind, without the ordering background and experience that we feel we have,
the 
ratio of songs you like versus those you don't will probably decrease. My 
point being that in the end it is definitely cheaper to buy from the 
store than to take your chances on random selections off of distributor 
faxes. <<

I guess, but what if everyone was more educated on the music, read a little
more than just XLR8R and URB's often times dated record reviews (due to some
of the unfortunate realities of print journalism). We would get our more of
our money's worth, right? And I know plenty of buyers who fack up and order
shite records. And who is forced to pay for those mess ups in the long run?
The consumer. 

>>Keep in mind that the record stores you are a bit fed up with are 
supporting our scene as much as anyone else. You get party info from 
them. You see your long lost friends at them...and they allow you to 
perpetuate your biggest addiction.<<

First of all, I never said I was fed up. I was just looking for answers and
wanted to spark discussion I think hasnt really been broached here before.
Second of all, Not all of our local stores give a fack about our scene. There
are many that do, though. Ameba was a shining example of this. But this fact,
along with your points about getting party info from stores and seeing our
long lost friends at stores has nothing to do with the fact that I, along
with most of the DJ's I know fell as though records are too expensive. 

When was the last time you ever saw one of your favorite DJ stores have a
sale on its new inventory?

Went to DNA on Friday. Band was great but club was too crowded. Couldn't move
on the dance floor and it was over 100 degrees upstairs. No ventilation, no
fans..total disregard for the patrons Spencer. And can you add a few more
toilets. With all that water we drink we spend half our night waiting in line
for the bathrooms. Suggestion: Increase your cover and charge for water and
use the money for airconditioning, fans and more toilets. DB Hayes spun some
great tunes after the live band went off. But too hot and too crowded to
enjoy it.

Went to VSF (Sugar Shack) on Saturday. Brought eight friends, got a booth and
then listened to heavy slow house music. The setting and ambiance were great
but the music sucked. The dance floor was empty. We asked the DJ (James) if
he could spin a few higher energy tunes but he said flately...no. He didn't
seem to care that no one was dancing so we took our money and went to
Release. Great as always on a Saturday night. Nabil..you are doing a great
job. But you also need some more bathrooms. The girls have to wait over a
half an hour and are afraid to take E and water for fear of not making it to
the bathroom in time. Otherwise it is still the best club for Saturday night.

Heaven 19 at Compadres...Sebastion, who puts on Indulgence at Starlight on
Wednesday nights put on this gig. Anyone go? Any reviews would be
appreciated.

Anyone go to Holy Cow? Reviews please.

Understood.  I really don't care about when I get the record as long as I
get the record.  I do not need to get everything the next day.  So with
that in mind our overhead wouldn't be as much as you predict.

This is not true.  You are implying that there are other businesses that
charge 50% over, and yes they exist, but for the most part markups of
27-40% are most common.  Records, because the people who order them usually
have no idea, have poor inventory mgmt, don;t understand what people want
and what sells often carry large amounts of inventory.  Something the
collective will NEVER have to deal with.

Qualification:  Most people carry crappy listenting stations which are
cheap and rarely listenable over the "hosue" sound system which is often
played too loud to hear the record.  Once again, something the collective
will avoid.  No listening stations, no overhead.

Eric, not to be blunt, but you're stating what we already know.  And I've
been buying records and been in the biz before house music was around for
the most part.  Obviously we would not be ordering blind, obviously we know
distributors who want to do business with us, obviously the people who join
our little group will know what they want to order and do not and have not
relied upon the, er, expertise of the store owner.  Which is often not to
my tastes and RARE is the storeowener who is really in touch with his/her
buying public.  They sell records to as many people as possible.  Little
time to become expert in what *I* want.  Now Darrin & Barry of Tweekin &
Primal repestively have thier pulse on thier buyers tastes.  Others just
carry huge amounts of unmovable inventory.  I am to the point , for the
most part, where I can pick and know what I want, moreso than someone
working in a rekkid store.

As for faxes, consider this, If I am working with a distributor giving them
some $600/week in business I will bet the farm I get those lists faxed to
me on time everytime.  Few are the stores who deal with a signle
distributor in such money volumes week after week.  I am talking upwards of
$600/week.  I think there are plenty of distributors who would love to have
that business.  I can think of two right off the top of my head.

And at a profit.  I would rather pocket that money and get what I want
everytime.  Sonce I don;t have long lost friends I doubt a record store or
a party will ever replace the good old telephone.  Anyway...

Maybe it was the people you were dealing with, maybe it was the money (were
you ordering $150 worth of $600 worht of records a pop for instance).  I
think that anyone interested in my idea will have thier eyes wide open and
be experienced in record buying.  The only thing it will give us greaster
insight into is the sleazy world of music and it's denizens at the other
end.  I just want to save $$$ otherwise.  And this I am well prepared to do!

Hi ...
I guess you all know buy now that Spiral Tribe's outdoor free party got
busted last night.  We were hoping to do a party on the beach, but that
didn't seem possible after three parties got busted on Friday.  So after a
little scouting, we found a different location northeast of Berkeley.  This
was not a success either.  

Why are all the cool outdoor places being found out by those who don't want
us to dance?  

Did anyone go to something fun outdoors last night?  I would like to hear
about it as I am feeling quite dissappointed in the S.F. free party scene as
of lately.   

Besides all this... Spiral Tribe's are getting antsy around here, maybe a
 Sunday thing in the SUN????  If I don't get them someplace to party soon
there will be one at my house.!!!

THX

I'm sorry that Spiral Tribe didn't get to go off.
Yesterday (7/19)  there was a free outdoor day party.
Supernatural, it was really cool! Jeno closed with a
an old disco tune Super Nature, it was epic.

peace,

I totally agree with Eric Spire. IF you think record stores don't 
need to this or don't have to that whats the point of a retail store? How
often do you buy records? I mean if your a regular vinyl connoisseur
you would go back often and would want new records to listen to.
So someone would have to pay for the shipping of UPS or FED-EX.
Actually alot os DJs I know when they order something, they want
it ASAP. And you mentioned something about records having finger-
prints, being warped and water damaged, why dont you check you records
to see if its damaged before you put your money down? You do have the
choice!
Those people I know who own record stores do give a fuck about the
"scene"  or else they would not be DJs, promoters or producers in the
scene.
peace,
RACHEL

Well as me and my three friends pull up at about 12:30 we are  greeted by a
popo hangin at the door. it was then that i got the feeling that this wasnt
going to be one of the most memorable nights. as we walk up to the entrance
we are stopped by some oversized rent a cops where we are then patted down
and I had my bag searched. Then as we walk up to buy our tickets, we find out
that its $25!! if we hadnt driven 40 mins to get there, we would have turned
around and gone home. anyways we walk in and see a bunch of OG's posted up at
the entrance staring at us like were some kind of freaks. werent many people
dancing, just a lot of standing.  the lights and visuals were the most
positive part of the party, the fx were amazing. i cant say as much about the
music though. there were a few good sets, but most werent worth dancing to.
inside it was like 100 degreez and after paying $25 to get in, you'd expect
to atleast get free water, but we didnt. it was 2$ a bottle. after going
through my pockets in the morning, i realized i spent $50 last night!!!! 25
on the ticket, 5 on water, and 20 on other necessities.
overall, was it worth the 25 dollar cover? hell no

    Basically, yes the stores don't HAVE TO do anything.  but in order 
to better service their customers, who often want the ltest tracks and 
also want to be able to listen to the product b4 buying instead of 
getting any random crap, they provide all these options.  if a customer 
did not feel that the $10 a record was worth all of these options they 
would not buy records.  people only buy things if they feel that in some 
way they are getting their money's worth.

    As for business expenses, if a business needs to pay more random 
expenses as overhead, that obviously must be passed on to the consumer.  
Overhead is always figured into the merchandise price as well as the 
actual cost of the product.  If people didn't care about the top new 
recent tracks, or listening stations, they could buy records at tower 
that sells them for cheeper.  it's the consumers choice.  better service 
= higher price.

All I can say is I'm pretty excited. 

:)

As you all may know, there's this groovy little party coming up called 
"True Love"
It will feature, for your listening enjoyment, all of your favorite DJs AND
(drumroll)

Me! Your Uncle Noah! :D (4am-5.30am)

I'll be flying all the way up from SoCal to wish Amanda and Dustin a 
happy onion...er.. union and to spin out a few interesting breakbeat 
tracks for you kiddies.  

So, if you want to shake your butt on Saturday the 26th, go to True Love.  
You'll be glad you did!


And don't forget to wear your Abduction Productions buttons!  I've heard 
some pretty fun stories about folks who've been running around with those 
"Kiss Me I'm Eing!" and "Kiss Me I'm Sober!" buttons!  

Do you think I should make a couple of "Kiss Me I'm Married!" buttons for

Well...

Rumor has it that at the CFC 4-year, they will have automatic escalators to
take you up and out of the sand-pit.  They will be built underneath the
sand so that when it is running it will lOOk like the sand is mOVing.

well, maybe not.

but perhaps if you didn't go and can take the next year or so to like get
in gOOd cardiovascular shape, you might like be into these folx's
anniversary parties.

Parking!  How cool.  Plenty of it.  We really pulled the wool over their
eyes.

Sand.  There was defintely no shortage of sand.  I am like covered... From
head to toe in sand.  No, don't worry.  It didn't get in some places.
Whew.

Muzik.  Um...except for it like getting distorted on the speakers a few
times, the music  was nice.  It was nice to go to one of these shindigs for
once where they are not playing
fry-your-brain-well-before-your-drugs-kick-in acid trance (...please micron
don't kick my ass!)  ALL NIGHT LONG with no break.  arrgh.  no, they had
different styles all night.  course stonies a pretty neato dj and sorry
josh i missed yer set again, but i know we'll still be tearin it up one day
at a Let Freedom party together or some shit like that.

Vibe.  I don't have much to say about it.  No words to say...it was nice
and relaxed like all the Cloud Factories...=[]

Scenery.  Oh.  I forgot to mention!  I like gave in to adrenalin
junkieness!  I rolled down the sandy hill like all the other natural high
freaks were doing. These girls were screaming at me as I took the Nestea
plunge.

Taco Bell:  Oh, yeah.  we stopped at Taco Bell on the way back.  Probably
not the most nutritious food, but grubbin nonetheless.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

oh, yeah, and it was danny's first successful beach party.

and he finally did end up getting sleep!  =]

welp.  gotta dive!  -=dEEp=-

Because nobody like us.

Or my theory is they have all been abducted by aliens (like myself, but
I was realsed because I  was to weird for the likes of them) and will be
returned in time for True Love.

Okok...  Maybe I need to get out a little more.  Which I will be doing
starting tommorow at the Monday's South Bay Lunch lunch with all those
happy faces.  Hope to see all you there!!!!!!  I will be there thanks to
>:) Amber's generosity.

Bye the way, who is going? 


					Take Care,
						Matthew

PS..... If your down, ;-{  Listen to some Enya...  Life will become so
amazingly beautiful, you will burst with love for all to enjoy!!!!!!

I would also like to thank everyone who helped out or  helped clean up or
handed out flyers, or donated $$  everyone's effort is greatly
appreciated

one wierd thing that i had to write about.
there was a wedding in the church next to the park that we used.
at the first supernatural there was a wedding on the beach.
every supernatural party that didn't get busted 
had a wedding

anyway thanks again to everyone who came or helped out 
I haven't had so much fun in quite a while.

peace

I just wanna know one thing.

How did you manage to spend five bucks total on two dollar bottles of
water?


After all, iNtOxiCAtiON is a pretty cheesey name for a ravE.
But $50bucks? I would have spent 85 easy! Thats, 25 to get in, 20 for water
(atleast a 10 bottle minimum), Bomb (because I run out, bums), and then you
have your friends bummin 20 tell next payday. So you got it easy.
 Oh yea, I forgot the 10 dollars for gas, 5 dollar cigarette stock up,
$3.95 Jamba Juice, $5.25 for a cut buster burrito & coke, $1.09 for that
extra lighter incase yours gets pocketed, 6 bucks for beer before the ravE,
12 bucks for beer after.

Night.
Jeff

Well I would like to take this time to nominate Stefi (AKA MerStefi,
AKA GoldeMoon) because she is the best, strongest, most beautiful and
so incredibly loving person I have ever met. 


Anyone else have a nominee that tops that!!?? I doubt it!!! But I 
am open.

hello everybody-
	just wanted to take a minute to let everybody know about our bus
trip/themecamp to/at burningman this year.  SO REAL is organizing a bus trip
to burningman this year. if at all possible, please consider this option. the
less cars that are out there, the less impact we'll have there will be on the
environment. it'll also be a fun ride and we'll all be able to meet new faces
and friends.  if you don't take the bus, please try to carpool.
	SO REAL will also be putting together a themecamp this year. the theme is a
21st century cafe.  we'll be playing the best of all styles of electronic
music while in a cafe setting (along with all the lights and decorations that
make for a gnarly night of techno!). for dj listing check out the sfraves
calendar.
	for more info. check out the SO REAL web site:
	www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~ben/burn/index.html
hope to here from you all, Peace Love Unity n RESPECT

The dollar is the stongest it has been in years!! I remember when
imports went up from $8 to $9 to $10...the record stores all told me
it was the weak dollar. Is anyone interested in passing the SAVINGS to
the customer now that this trend is reversing? Hell no.


Now I know that for the most part, the record price thing is an
institutional problem...more on the shoulders of Watts and Nemisis
than anyone else. However, the fact still remains that there are
record stores in the city which sell their stock for a full dollar
less than anyone else. How do they do it?? 

They have listening stations...how do they do it??

My impression is that they're more commited to the true vinyl junkie.
Pure and simple. Along the way, their low prices also pull in more
business. 

Anyways, record stores need to start talking to their disributors,
asking them what's up. It is nothing less than extortion charging so
much for 2 SONGS. Like myself, at least 90% of dj's out there are
home-bound and are buying plates out of the love for the music. They
will rarely or never play out, if they do, they probably won't get
paid, and if they do, they consider themselves the luckiest people in
the world...getting paid for playing records...what a silly idea:)

This isn't a back-ally addiction, this is a passion and art and it
saddens me to see is expoited in such a fashion.

-tired of the runaround-

whoa. nominating the most loving person in the world? that's a tough one,
especially
when you've had a rough year like me. over this last year, a lot of people
have come
into my life, and i love them all. a few of them have already been
mentioned on this
list, and i'd like to comment on amanda's post. :)

>The love of my life.... DuStIn 

aww my gosh, this boy is just rad. the first (and only) time i met him was
at feel
good experience (which incidently happened on my last night in cali...). we
talked
for a really long time, and at the end of the night when i was starting to
realize
that i wasn't going to see a lot of people for a very, very long time...i
was so so
sad, but dustin brightened up my morning by giving my his badass
kaleidoscope straight
from his own keyring. i carry that with me every day, and when the longing
gets too
intense...i break out the 'scope and dream about the parties and people
over in cali.
lots of huggies to you dustin. and best wishes to both amanda and dustin,
you guys
are truly beautiful!

>My bestest friend in the entier world... LaRa 

hey, she's my bestest friend in the entire world too! *smile* lara is the
bomb, that's
all there's to it. but hey, i think most of you knew that already. ;) i
love you so
much lara. (just take care of my tables and stuff, k? *grin*)

and here are my additions to the "miss/mr/mrs loving pageant". =)

orson - ok, so maggie (hi sweetie!) mentioned him first, but i still love
the boy.
this guy isn't just laminates you know, he's a really really wonderful
person too!

star - my savior up at sonoma state when my life was crumbling earlier this
year.
i honestly don't know what i would have done without her.

cricket - the berkeley lovebug. j/k, cricket's definitely my favorite berkeley
student, and i'm _sooooo_ happy she got to come see me in sweden this
summer. :)

and oh, everyone else on this list. you all deserve mad props for being such a
loving bunch. =)

well i had the chance this weekend to hear solar spin out in the desert in socal... despite a late start (the sound system got lost on the way!) and a visit from the sherrif's department, in between it was a good evening in a beautiful location and some good music was played. it was the first time i had ever been out to the desert (at night), and the nearly-full moon was amazing.

btw, how was the sunset boat party?

There is no single most loving person, but some of the most
loving, open, warm-hearted people I've ever met in my loooong
life are part of this beautiful underground scene of ours :)
Love and more love,
Eric

Friday night started off totally cool with my getting a ride down to SC with
Pengo.  It totally sucks that Viberation got busted, but I did get to see some
friends and hang out in a parking lot in Santa Clara.  After this night I was
sure that I could navigate all the major freeways in the South Bay.


Saturday drove down to Monterey for the CF Three Year Anniversary party.  I
_loved_ this party.  The location was great - a big round sandy crater with
little torches around the perimeter of the party.  On one side was a really
steep dune that people were rolling down all night.  It was also cool to sit up
there and look down at all the happy people and have the ocean behind you.


The vibe was immense.  Those CF people are *tight*.  We were still going off at
10:30 in the morning and didn't want to leave!  Highlights:

Breakfast survey with dEEpfog
Putting stickers and a candy necklace on AndyW [Hey, anybody wanna make him
some fuzzy pants?  =)]
Sitting around the fire with WonderPaula under a towel
Big group hug/Scott Nelson sandwich
Rolling down the hill [Yeah, I did it too.  And I had sand everywhere.]
Jer showing up at 6am
Breakfast  [Can we get a table for 40, please?]

The music was awesome, I thought all the DJs had great sets.  Big thanks to
Forest who was throwing down when I arrived, James Christian, inTIMidator, Sho,
Stonie, Cloud and Swoops for rocking my world.  I danced so much that night -
especially after I discovered the piece of plywood!

Props to the CF family.  It was a night to remember.


Happy Monday, everyone.

Love,
b.

	Why would you want to get someone to stop doing anything that
they liked to do, if it isn't directly harming them? And even if it
was, isn't that also their right? You didn't say if your friend is
experiencing problems at work or school or in the rest of their life,
but if not what difference does it make if they do a little weed/E/ghb
whatever? Drug use does not equal drug abuse, you know.

Sorry to be blunt-

Friday night was a fucking disaster.

3 parties got busted. Cops and rangers were sweeping down the coast
form half-moon bay to santa cruz. They were working late shifts to
make the point that the beaches were now off limits. 

On behalf of the Viberation crew, I'm sorry if you were out there in
friday. Hundreds of unhappy ravers were roaming up and down the
30-mile stretch of coast hoping for a relocation of at least 1 of the
3 parties. We tried our best, but decided to call it quits at 4 am.

So, thank goodness for the cloud factory. My happy family of
dream-makers pulled it off again and we partied in style. 

We had SO many people to help set up. Everyone was smiling, many
dancing (some nekkid). I made it through a couple hours before I
passed out, sleep-deprived in a tent overlooking the gathering.

I think we went till 10:30 or so, and only stopped b/c we were so
hungry. 

I had a fabulous time, thanks guys:)

and so the story goes...

Well, those SRC boys set up on this rad little beach located on the
Sacramento River, which was nice since it was hot as hell out there. There
were also a lot of boaters who were parked on the beach for the day. Most of
these people were getting heavily intoxicated(all right, straight-up drunk)
which made some of them quite belligerent. The cool thing was, for every
group of them that threatened us if we didn't turn it down, another group
came up and threatened us if we didn't turn it UP. Who says house music isn't
universal? Well- we compromised and left the volume where it was at.
Everybody that came was having great time just chillin' on the beach, dancin'
in the sand, and gettin' some sun. About 6:30pm the cops came in response to
a noise complaint. They were pretty cool tho and explained to us that we
could continue, but if they got called again it would get serious. Well...we
persisted on w/ the lowered volume. Everything was goin' fine 'til about 8
o'clock. It was half an hour into my set when i smelled somethin' burnin'.
One of my flippin' monitors was on fire! Those were some hot-ass beats i
geuss. The surrounding people dealt with it immediately and we kept on
rockin'. The SRC guys decided to shut down at about 8:30 out of consideration
for the neighboring houses. This was en excellent idea since half way thru my
last record someone came running over to tell us that the cops were back.  We
shut down and high-tailed the equipment up a side-trail back to the cars
while the police were walking down the main path. The cops came down and told
us that they had another call. We said were done and would be out of there in
about 10 min. In return they gave us 2 min. to beat it. Adrenalin does
wonders for your ability to move, I'll tell ya. All in all, everyone there
had a great time and all the dj's were playin' some great sunday afternoon
grooves. Hats off to John , Raju, Chad, Scott, Mia and everyone else that
helped make this event happen .
	Well, another one down. Next one's in 2 weeks(we'll find a new space!). 

	love all, stillwind

Boat Party kicked ass!

Norm y Rhoda picked me up about 7, and we gots to the docks by 7:30.  It was 
sold out, but we hung around looong enough, and after the ticket holders, VIP 
list, guest list, boat crew list, Presidential list, and several others were 
done, they let everyone else on (I don't think they had to turn anyone away).  
We missed the actual sunset as it was too cloudy.  However, the boat took a 
nice cruise out and under the GG Bridge.  It was packed, but not quite 
claustrophobic.  Fatty disco/funk tunes came from the second deck, which then 
gave way to housey hip hoppy stuff, then a live act.  The first floor pounded 
out techno beats without stop.  The trip was long--  did we go to Visalia and 
back?  j/k but there was a neat mix of funky folx on board which made it a good 
time.  Overall, a very very fun party.  Sunsets are my favourite parties, and 
since they've given so much for free, it always feels good supporting their 
for-pay events. Woo hoo!

Yep, the boat party rocked. John Howard played a great set, and Loran
(sp?) is a great up-and-coming DJ who plays jungle-I-can-dance-to and 
is quite entertaining to watch as well (he goes apeshit behind the
decks). This one was actually a few notches better than some of the
other boat parties I've been to, though most Sunset boat parties tend
to be great. Good vibe too. Not the smarmy exclusive kkkandy raver vibe
like you find at supposedly "cool" UG events -- the Sunset vibe
welcomes all, irrrespective of age, fashion statements (or lack
thereof), color, sex, orientation, ugly, pretty, normal, wierd,
tweaked, tripping, sober, drunk, or whatever. 

Sunset is definitely up there w/ other SF "must see" events (Stompy,
Wicked, Funky Tekno Tribe)...

PS: I picked up a flyer for the next Stompy @ VSF -- Sun Aug 3 "Noon
til then" (which usually ends up being 9 or 10 PM). DJ's are Jonene,
Preston. Special guests are Johnny Fiasco (*), Tres Manos. Plus Kevin,
James, Gavan. Johnny Fiasco should be quite interesting -- Stompy
always seems to get a good big name outof town DJ. But who is "Tres
Manos" from Boulder Colorado??

I was definitely glad to have been able to make it to this party. Yes, the
asking price was extremely steep ($25) but I do have to say that it payed
off. The "hard room" had some kewl jungle and the "soft room" busted out some
groovy house. The vibe in the soft room was incredible. There were so many
smiley people and everyone was moving. I was up dancing on one of the box
thingys so I was able to get a view of the entire place. I think the party
peaked @ around 3 when the vibe in the "soft room" was so thick and the
glowsticks were flailing everywhichwaywhere!!!!!!

I went with three of my greatest friends and we all had an amazing time. I
hope everyone else that went to the party did too. For those that didn't make
it, I hope you had an awesome time doing whatever you did on Saturday night.

Sm;)e baby, SM:)E DAMMIT!

> Friday night was a fucking disaster.

No way!!!  Thank you Viberation!  Viberation got me down to santa cruz, 
and i spent the night on the rocks overlooking the ocean (near pigeon 
point?) with some really cool people, relaxing and enjoying nature and 
everyone's company.  much more intimate and warm than if i had been at a 
dusty warehouse (although, truth be told, i was every bit as grimy =)

neway, even if it got busted, it still got me out and around some really 
great people!  thanks!!!

=)

He's a Boulder DJ who...(from what I remember from living there/hearing
him) spins house. He's a fairly prominent Colorado scene DJ.... I met
him at the record store he was working at...nice guy. His name's Brad.
Technically he's a good DJ...plays the breaks...scratches. If you are
into house he will definatley keep you groovin.

DJ Sneak is a FTT resident now? Did he move to SF? Cool! DJ Sneak
rules, as long as he's not getting too trax-y (when he played stompy,
he played a great set. Unfortunately, there's parts of his Moonshine
"Buggin' Da Beats" CD that are just too trax-y for my tastes...

Welp... I would have to say that, the most lovingest person in the whole
world would have to be....My mommy.  =]:..  She loves ME even! But for all
of you, it would take along time to figure out where her heart is. Because
like me, she is the quiet type.

Oh.. I think I am going to cry...  =[:..
But I think that Lara is the mostest lovingest person too! =]:. ..

You forgot one Minor Detail,

You have to have a minimum $2,000 order from most Dist. at least that
is what I heard. In addition to that I doubt they will sell to a
person that is only buying 10-20 rekkids a week it is not worth there
time or yours. it is not worth the hassle of going through that.
Unless you have plenty of $$ and dont have a job it is worth it. Also
I have talked to the local rekkid store that I pay rent on since I am
a valued customer and the profit margin is not that high and you have
to put up with a lot of shit.

But then again I could be wrong that is just (IMO) -Dennis Miller

	Ok, as one of the people involved in one of the parties that
got busted Friday nite, here's my take on the situation ...

	There've been too many parties in the same few locations on
the beaches of southern San Mateo county. The local residents are 
pissed. They pass the heat on to the cops, the cops pass it on to us.
What comes around, goes around. It isn't about massive promoters calling
the heat on us, it's about good party spots getting over used & burned
out.

	Of course, our little party (the one in that dusty grove, not
on the beach) probably wouldn't have been found if a bunch of people
from the busted beach parties hadn't decided to caravan over there
en masse, thereby leading the cops who busted the beach party right
to us. It would help if ravers would use their brains every so often
in these situations, but maybe that's too much to ask.

	Time to spread it around & find some new outdoor spots, people.

	Rob

Dont let the drugs blind you.  lots and lots of the people using drugs now are using them as an escape.  This IS a major problem for obvious reasons.  Im scared of your assumption that this person DOESNT have problems.  I think drug related matters need to be taken at worst case all the time..cuz if you dont..pretty soon you WILL be in a situation thats harmful and it might already bee to late. Rave safe marisa.  Dont let drugs get the best of you.

Well, although I would agree that many of the previously mentioned
people are all spectacular in their love and warmth, I failed to see
cited the one person I regard as the most loving person in our scene.  I
would say that it would have to be Jeremy (Mercutio73) who brightens my
day when I'm down and is always there to lend an ear to my tales of
successes as well as my failures.  Jeremy, you are a wonderful friend,
sincere and true.
                                            Always,

LTJ BUKEM...

I can't thank you guys enough for bringing him out. I already thanked you
before seeing him, but I wanted to say thanks again.

I actually introduced myself to him and chatted for a few minutes. He's
as cool as I thought he would be.

Did he fly out here just for San Francisco??

My only complaint was that it was TOO HOT and way over crowded.... but it
was a dream come true.

This is not a rumor.

SPIRAL TRIBE IN SF TONIGHT

I just got a call from the promoter who must have gotten them last
minute.  She said tell all your friends because she did not get a chance
to promote.  

5 bucks!  Cat's Alley Bar & Grill which is on 8th and Folsom.

This is nuts!  You guys chased them around Santa Cruz and Martinez and
Oakland over the past week, well, they're here, and nobody knows about
it until now!

You're right, distributors will require some sort of considerable volume (at 
least to get a worth while price).  But, you over looked to important 
points: one pro- one con:

1) You wouldn't have the hassles and costs of a store (rent, theft, 
security, replenishing stock, displays etc) if you were indep. or working as 
a small co-op.  big +
2) if DJs worked as a buying co-op you would need a re-sellers licences to 
buy from the distributor (especially if you want to look like a business). 
 This isn't difficult but a lot of resposibilty for the person with their 
name on the paperwork! The CA state board of equalization can be very nasty 
 ;-(  to whomever they think owes them money.  trust me on this one.  big -

You forgot one Minor Detail,

You have to have a minimum $2,000 order from most Dist. at least that
is what I heard. In addition to that I doubt they will sell to a
person that is only buying 10-20 rekkids a week it is not worth there
time or yours. it is not worth the hassle of going through that.
Unless you have plenty of $$ and dont have a job it is worth it. Also
I have talked to the local rekkid store that I pay rent on since I am
a valued customer and the profit margin is not that high and you have
to put up with a lot of shit.

But then again I could be wrong that is just (IMO) -Dennis Miller

I agree. If, for example, a person abuses drugs because of self-esteem
problems (which is often the case) you can be supportive of them as a
friend to help them feel better about themselves. Only then will a
person care about themselves enough to make the choice to end it. But
telling someone directly about their problem will only push them away.

	I agree. They will see you as a busy-body holier-than-thou
type and stop listening to you at all, nomatter how good a friend you
might have been in the past... And that is assuming that they really
do have a problem and that the original poster didn't just feel that
someone doing drugs at a rave or wherever was a problem in itself
which I don't think was ever answered...

On behalf of myself and the crew I'd like to extend a big apology for those
who tried to make it out to viberation friday night.

While the whole evening was truly discouraging for a lot of people, we are
trying our best to take it as a learning experience. It's easy to point
fingers and make assumptions, I believe it's more a matter of striving
harder to find the delicate balance our gatherings have in this world.

It is likely that we will be taking our parties below the SFR list. If you
would like to be informed about our future plans, please respond to this
message with your email or snail mail addy (or both) and we'll be sure to
let you know.

Thanks again for your support, and be sure to look out for the BBQ and
Beats campout - August 8th to 11th plus Harmony, Pacific, Mad, and CFC
coming together for a very special event the following weekend.

much love and energy.

Terry

Who's escaping?  From what?  To where?
In a rare moment of seriousness (hehe!), I will
state here and now that I've never used any
substance to escape from anything.
OK, no more seriousness for a good long time ;)

A DJ at one of the hottest dance clubs told me that alot of DJ's subscribe to
a service called Promo Only. I just subscribed to their Import Series (they
also
have a Club Series). They send you (and all the other DJ's) compilations of
promo CD's that are sent to the DJ's by the record companies. Their web site
is www.promoonly.com. Very kewl stuff.

I also purchased the three CD set from interhit records. All great dance mix
cd's. Their web site is www.interhit.com. A subscription to their DMA
Magazine gets you two free CD's. One from Club Bash in Miami is awesome. The
other is a rap crap jungle thing that sucks.

Last but not least for all you wannabe DJ's. Bought two Import series CD's
from REMIX Central (websire www.remix-central.com). Great techno dance stuff.

Venture forth and Dance

first of all, please respond to my posts personally as well as on the lists, because i'm not subscribed to sfr while i'm abroad to control the volume of messages while i'm paying 5 pounds an hour at internet cafes.

SF vs UK.......

I've been in the uk for close to a week now.  Where is the underground that everyone is talking about?  I was at the blue note last week, and I spent two nights this week at club 414.  The music was phenminal, but the vibe was.... missing.  Now don't get me wrong.  I've met loads of nice people here, and at clubs as well.  But It's nothing like back home.  In SF, the rave scene and the club scene is two different worlds.  Different music, different people, differnt cup of tea.  The "Undergound" of sf is a tight knit community of people working together for what we call PLUR.  This is something that the uk has seemed to have forgotten about.  For the UK people, plur stands for Peace, Love, Unity and Respect.  It is a motto that we try to live by.  When you go to an undergound event in SF, you are always surrounded by smiles.  You are always welcome. You are accepted.  You always see people that you know, but you also always meet new wonderful faces.  Here, It seems that Unity is a bit iffy.  Love is only for those w/ girlfriends and boyfriends, and Respect?  I have recieved it only from some.

I have a theory.  Electronic music, dancing, etc. is mainstreem here in London.  Everyone and their uncle listens to house, drum & bass, etc.  They play it in their cars, barber shops, pubs...everywhere.  

Is this the direction the SF scene is heading too?  Is it inevitable?  The dilution of our precious scene?  

I'm sure the underground is here too, but where?  If anyone knows, please drop me a line.

I'm having a fantastic time here in Brittain, i'm meeting lots of nice people, (and staying w/ them) and I love it here.  But (and please exceuse the velveeta) my heart is in San Francisco.  Always.

I love my scene.  I love my music.  I love my community.  

PLUR!  everybody.  please never forget.

Hi all!

We got in to Magic Wednesdays during the end of Simply Jeffs set and the
place was pretty packed and the breakbeats were rockin the joint. I guess
Jeff has a new mix CD on City of Angels that just came out and was having
his release party.

Astral Matrix then came on at 12:30 and played a great live minimal housey
set that lasted about 1Hr and was perfectly beatmatched the whole time.
Very  kewl trackky type of stuff. It was great to see the 40-50 people up
on stage with Astral Matrix with nothing but smiles and giving off positive
vibes!!

For those that would like to check out photos of Astral Matrix last night
at Magic Wednesdays, Happy Kat took some nice shots that are now up at:

Hello everyone,

We are having a problem at Wish.  You see, we are an 18 and over club in San 
Francisco, and our problem is that we _must_ check ID's at the front door. 
 We have recently moved to a much bigger and nicer location than our old 
space at Bahia, (Wish is now at 836 Mission St., btwn 4th & 5th St) and the 
owners/managers at the new space are very strict with checking every single 
ID that comes in the door.

Last week alone, we had to turn away almost 30 people for not having a valid 
ID with them.  I know for a fact that many of these people were over 21, and 
left their drivers license at home!  This just doesn't make any sense to me. 


Please understand, that if it were up to the promoters of Wish, we would 
allow for all ages to be welcome at our weekly.  However, we still have to 
play by the same rules everyone else does, and therefore cannot do throw an 
all ages weekly.

Not only that, but we honestly _need_ every bit of your support to continue 
throwing Wish, every week.  We are currently in our 64th consecutive week, 
and we rely heavily on the advertising of word of mouth through the 
community to promote our club, rather than sending out flyers to every party 
and record store in the bay area.  We believe that this helps keep the Wish 
crowd energetic and fun, and so far we have had good luck with that.  So, 
please please, come out to Wish and see what's happening...

Thanks very much for your time!  See you at WISH!!!

:-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)

Kenneth Sol

DRUG USE does NOT equal DRUG ABUSE...... but there comes a time
when you have to STOP. maybe if its just to take a break. when you
start doing drugs to get F@cked up on purpose everysingle day and
your excuse "its cause its the summer" that I don't consider good
thinking. DRUGS are very delicate things that need to be handled with
care. You you are unlucky, you won't notice the changes yourself, but
those around you will.

I'm not talking nescesarily about "Physical"harm...think about what
all this drugs are doing to your mind every single weekend... 

I personaly chose to STOP. mainly cause it wasn't the same anymore.
it was all a waste. too much $$$, coming home every weekend f@cked up on
something, huge black bags under my eyes, loss weight, corrupted
sleep/wake patterns, depression. It feels soooooo much better to me
to come home clean and sober rather than f@cked up on something  all
wasted out from the night before :) :)

I also stop'd cause it was starting to become a vicious trap, to me
at least. I must agree, drugs changed me in very good ways and I'm
grateful that
I was able to experience that :) I was able to see myself from the
outside and
worked on changing the things I did not like... they made me a better
person inside as well
as the outside ;)

I do have to say, even tho it might hurt, you can't change someone into
not doing drugs. You just gotta suffer through it and let them suffer
the consequences eventually. I'm going through it...and it hurts.

its hard to see how your friends waste away, in the vicious cycle.
its not cool to see your friends on drugs everyday...or almost everyday.

Not trying to start a flame war :)
just my dollar fifty ;).....

[*hugs*]
Pablito

As far as I know, most distibutors don't mind small orders, but the
additional shipping costs will negate the discount unless you make a
substantial order.  You can order lots of great Detroit stuff direct from
Submerge (www.submerge.com).  In general, though, I've been disappointed by
orders I've made directly from distributors because I haven't been able to
hear the tracks first.  Even with labels and artists that I buy every
release from and *know* I like, I inevitably end up with the stinkers when
I order direct.  So I've decided that the small markup of the record store
is worth it for the ability to listen first.  Plus, most stores struggle to
survive as it is, so I think it's good to support them.

Now *this* sounds like a party with value, and I am really psyched about it.

I am definitely going, so maybe I'll see some of you there.

Lara,

If you do it so often that your dreams become mixed with reality - you
are truly blessed - and it is up to you to live it any way you want to.

I rave sober these days; but I cherish my memories of f*cked up
cra-zee-ness!

Keep it surreal.

To be able to think like a child, the essence of my goal.  To see what is
THERE instead of what I expect.  To hear people's words individually, and
then not take unmeant meaning from them.

To delve into the mysteries of the tailside of a penny.

To run a lot, and drink water messily, and then run some more.  Fall down,
GO BOOM.  Get up, and CHARGE CHARGE CHARGE.  To sing three words to myself
for an hour.

Babbling.  Band-aids are for wimps.  Rubbing salt in cuts.  Kicking rocks.
Chasing cattle.  Jumping off things.  Making hoooo-hoooooo noises.

But NOW......

It's different.  The more we learn the less we CAN learn.

So then we eat a grip of mushrooms.

'Let's pretend we're pregnant cats!  I'm a black one!  (run)  You've got
bad luck, BAD LUCKY BUTT!'

THE END.

Yours truly, 
Max McCauley
Grade 5

Heyhey...  I'm looking for Jordan Fields concerning licensing one of his 
tracks for a remix - can anyone help me locate him?  So far, i've heard 
he's from Chicago, and from Sacramento, so i figured i'd try both 
lists...  Clement and I called La Casa records, but their number was out 
of date...  Anyway, if anyone has contact info for him, please email me 
or respond directly to Clement (DJ Citru) at jeanv@bred.univ-montp3.fr

thanks!

you mean i only get to pick one?
i sat here trying to think of the most loving person in the world and i 
started to cry.
I couldn't pick just one. I love so many people.. I realized.. There are 
SO MANY BEAUTIFUL LOVING CARING PEOPLE in this scene, AND in the world. 
Sure, there's alot of negative shit, which I've been down about lately, 
but yanno, there is alot of GOOD out there. 
	Amanda, she has done for me what no one has ever done for me in 
their lives. She's gone out of her way for me, only my mothers have done 
that for me (yes, i have 2). When I am feeling down, she not only talks 
to me and reassures me, she tells our friends to cheer me up as well, 
which is a sweet thing. She goes out of her way to make me smile, and I 
love her for that. I love her for her consideration, warmth, loving, and 
beauty that shines from within. When I feel that I'm alone in the world I 
just have to think of Amanda and I know that I'm FAR from alone.
	All of you are beautiful loving and caring people, I wish I could 
name you all but in fear of leaving people out or embarrassing others, I 
just leave it at that. And I have to say that my birth mother, and 
adoptive mother have played incredibly positive and loving roles in my 
life, I owe the both of them more than my life.
	There are a couple of you that stand out in my heart, you know 
who you are. I talk to you every day. You tolerate my bitching, my lack 
of sanity, and my obsession with jungle. I love you guys for being there.
	SO THERE I DID MY MUSHY SHIT.
NOW CAN I SAY *BIG UPS TO THE TRUE JUNGLISTS?!??!* :)~

Mayan Prophecy foretells a thinning veil,
Beginning this month.


>From the Celestine Journal, by Ann Buzenberg.

Ancient prophecies interest many of our celestine Journal readers, so
this
month an event foretold by the ancient Mayans of Mexico may fascinate you
as it did me.

On New Year's Day of the Mayan Calendar, which falls on July 26th, 1997.
It
is said that a thinning of the veils will occur between our Material
third
dimension and the fourth dimension- the afterlife dimension explored in
The
Tenth Insight.
The Mayan calendar calls July 26th 1997, Kan HO (yellow overtone seed
day).
 Prophecy says on this day, access to the fourth dimension is opened to
humans. To celebrate this opening, Mayan calendar followers plan a
celebration in Mexico City, in Japan and locations worldwide.
To learn more, we spoke with Bonita Luz, an American transpersonal
psychotherapist who has studied traveled and worked in Central and South
America.
"I've been interested for years in the ancient indigenous prophecies"
Bonita says, "especially those of the Inca, Maya, Hopi and Cherokee,
because they say similar things about these times we now live in. My
inner
knowingness always whispered, 'Pay attention-these prophecies carry the
message of hope for our times."
Bonita has studied with Mayan elder Hunbatz Men, author of Mayan Science
and Religion
She is excited about this Yellow Overtone Seed Day.
"On this day, the prophecies of Pacal Votan indicate that a gate of time
will open, causing a mind shift to occur.
Mind shift, for me, means a conscious shift of dimensions, taking us from
third dimension reality   the mechanistic, material world, with all it's
ego-based drama, fear and illusion   to a higher dimension of
consciousness. This is the dimension where we raise our energies up to
live
in a place of LOVE, HARMONY, PEACE and BALANCE =  a consciousness of our
higher self that is free of the web of third dimension illusions. We can
then, for the first time, become truly effective in this world   We can
be
in this world, but not of it.
"According to the ancient Mayan calendar and also modern science, we're
near the end of a 26,000 year cycle, in what the ancients called the
Shift
of the Ages, a time of great change," says Bonita. "The day-long global
peace meditation known as the Harmonic Convergence, August 16-17, 1987,
began an intense 26 year transition period which ends in the year 2012
and
closes the 26,000 year cycle. In this cycle, we begin stepping into what
the Mayan call the New Itza Age  an age of Light and Wisdom in fourth
dimensional consciousness. AS FORETOLD, THIS TRANSITION PERIOD IS A TIME
OF
PURIFICATION AND INTENSIFYING ENERGY FREQUENCIES. It is a time for us to
WAKE UP to REMEMBER WHO WE REALLY ARE and begin to INTERGRATE with our
Light Bodies, and REATIVATE our natural telepathic abilities. Wisdom and
focus is needed through this evolutionary transformation. By 2013, we
reach
a new reign of enlightenment, living a new dream".
Synchronistic modern scientific discoveries which correspond to these
prophecies seem to come Bonita's way. At Ft. Lauderdale,FL, planetarium,
she heard astronomers verify that we are ending a 26,000 year cycle they
call the Wobble Effect  Earth's elliptical rotation around the central
su=
n
of our galaxy.
Then the April 29,1997, New York Times' front page featured an article
about astro-physicists discovering a fountain of invisible, high
frequency
energy rays spraying out from the center of our galaxy. Scientists
measure
them as gamma rays  light particles or photons produced by colliding
electrons and anti-electrons. "For me, this is physical evidence of the
Galactic Light Beam, which the Mayan prophecies predict our Earth is
going
through at this time," Bonita says.
Scientists point out that if this spray of energy ever reaches Earth, it
will cause no harm, Bonita believes, however, that these light particles
do
affect us directly, and that many of us now are feeling these intensified
energies in our physical bodies. "The energies of the cosmos are aiding
us
in that mind shift for which we have longed," she says.
"One of the key things I learned studying with the Shamans," says Bonita,
whose graduate studies ten years ago took her deep into Peruvian Jungles,
"was the importance of our intention and our willingness to invite the
spirits to communicate with us. Now the energies are with us for a mind
shift  both the increasing light energy from the Galactic center and the
energy of Yellow Overtone Seed, which opens the inter-dimensional
doorway.
When we synchronize our intention and willingness with these energies,
amazing results are possible. When we gather as a group and set a
collective intention, even more amazing things are possible.
Bonita plans to lead a spiritual journey to Mexico on July 24-August 7,
in
order to do just that. August 6 is another auspicious day known as Blue
Electric Eagle Day. The last time this day fell on August 6 was in 1945,
when Hiroshima was bombed. Another Blue Electric Eagle Day was August 16,
1987, when the Harmonic Convergence was held worldwide. "It is important
to
bring the peaceful Harmonic Convergence energy into this August 6 to
clear
the energy of Hiroshima," Bonita believes.
 or the Maya, science and spiritual cosmology were inseparable. Their
highly precise calendars chart the past and predict the future, using
cycles within Galactic cycles and synchronization's with planets and star
systems  especially the Pleiades. Bonita believes that we can learn from
these cycles and calendars.
"Palenque is a beautiful, most sacred center where the veils between
worlds
is thin. Much of our work, individually and collectively, will be here,"
Bonita says of the group journey.
Mayan prophecies foretold of this time when we would return to the sacred
sites to retrieve the secret knowledge encoded in the stones, glyphs and
pyramids to reawaken the memories and powers that have been dormant in us
for so long
"NOW IS THE TIME"

Good evening

Rarely do I watch the news anymore (just read the papers), but I saw on t.v. last week, local reporters standing in front of 1015 Folsom and talking about how suspected Versace murderer, Andrew Cunanan partied down at that locale back in the day, when it was called... Colossus??

Can someone on this list confirm this? I wasn't paying much attention to the segment, but I did see the big ol' black doors, and the 1015 sign.

Hey. I am in summer school this summer. SUX!! And we are studying
religions now and we had to do a report on a religion of our choice. So
I thought about it and i put down Technoshamanism as the religion i
would research.

The teach said that wasn't a religion, and I told him he was nuts
because It was a branch of Shamanism. He said Okay fine and he told me
that if it was a religion that I had to do a 5 page report. 

So yesterday i tuned in a 5 page report on raves. And believe it or not
I looked up Technoshamanism and it really is a religion. Look it up on
Hyperreal.

No matter what your birth religion is, raves are a religious ceremony.
Some people may think that its just caca BS but think about it.

What's our place of worship? A rave.
What's are our commandments? PLUR
What is the point to our religion? To enlighten ourselves and our hearts
through dancing to the rhythms of life.

What we are doing truly is a religious ceremony. This made me realize
that raves aren't just something we do for fun. They are a way of life.

Something to think about

Luv,
Paul

I
I use to have a small business selling tapes and cds at the swap meet. I had
a seller's permit which was really easy to obtain.....the only thing you have
to have is a name for your business. I went through a local distributor,
which did require a large initial order of over $1500.....but....after that
initial order the required minimum amount was only $100. They also took
returns......95% on tapes and cd's....80% for vinyl...which would go towards
your next order. That was in 1989.
As for the State Board of Equalization......they send you something at the
end of the year to figure out the sales tax you owe the state. I added up all
of my purchases, added about $50 to make it look like i was trying to make a
profit, times it by the tax amount at that time......then wrote the check.
That is the part where it can get tricky. If you were to start this now,
July, I am sure there will be people who aren't going to be around at the end
of the year when it is time to pay taxes. Then like stated in an earlier
reply, whoevers name is on the sellers permit can end up getting stuck with
alot of shit.
Whoever decides to start this is going to have to do alot more than they
think. It will be a business whether you like it or not. The same person will
have to do the ordering, have to get the money from all of the people ahead
of time, which will include taxes, have to return any money left over due to
out of stocks on orders, you will have to divide the shipping costs between
all of the people placing an order, and you will have to distribute the fax
from the distributor to everyone so they can see what they want to order. Oh,
and what about the records they send to you because the ones you ordered
weren't in stock?? Who gets the promo's?? How do you know if you are going to
like a record, if all you know about it is what the distributor wrote on the
fax.....usually about three lines.....and always positive....cuz they want
them to sell. 
If your lucky the distributor you go through might have a web page, with
soundbites, that you could order from.......and that would change everything.

sorry for the ramble.......by the way, this was my first post to SFR.....I
recently moved up here from Southern California (Laguna Niguel, South Orange
County)
Hello :)

Wrong?

I don't think so.

I think they are and intergral and important part of our community. 
I think the rave community was built on friendship, music and drugs.
Destructive and problematic sometimes - sure.
But partying sober and partying _not_ sober are two totally different 
experiences. 
Parties that really GO OFF do so because of many people in altered 
states.

In any case whether substances are a part of a persons good time or not to
each his own.  I don't feel any of us have the right to preach what we
should or shouldn't do at events or with each others lives in general.  The
only concern I have is substance abuse and individuals that are not aware
or educated in twisting their bodies chemistry.

I'm not sure I 100% agree with the "events that go off are the ones with
altered states".  Sure they have a thick vibe and they are a blast, but
I've been to plenty of events that have gone off and most people are sober
and are enjoying it just as much as being altered.  Its really up to the
people and promoters and the vibe they bring.  The substances are just a
surface escape.  It goes deeper than that for most people I know.  But I
won't get into that.

Lets just kick back and enjoy our selves.  I feel we are over analyzing and
feelings start to get ruffled...

Good day!

no, parties that go off do so because the group of people there is
friendly, energetic, and outgoing. if they are on drugs, then they are in
control of their drugs. a bunch of passed out ghb casualties and e-heads
with bulging eyeballs and groping hands do not a good party make.

the problem with drugs is not the use of them, but the abuse of them. 

people may try to brainwash you into thinking that all using is abusing,
but it's not true. the trouble occurs when one becomes consumed by the
usage. it's that point when you can only perceive having fun when
altered. it's as though you personally can't have fun anymore and you
have to call up your unsober self to do it for you. when all you can
think about is how and when you are going to be able to have *fun* again
is when you should realize that you are drowning.

Along the same lines, I've been to some events where most people were 
doing drugs and the party still was horrible :P  (unsober)

Agree. I think friendship, music and drugs (well..maybe not every kind) are
as important as sunshine, air, and water to ravers.

	I don't know Deep *that* well, but I think I know him well enough
to recognize that this was a sarcastic/joke post.

	Personally, I don't think drugs are wrong. I wish people could do
all the drugs they want to & never get hurt or caught by them. But they
can't.

Just send it as an attachment to "sfraves-owner@hyperreal.org" and I'll
handle moving it into place.

I remember Colossus Club, Gus Been used to promote it, But I thought
that it used to be at 177 townsend?  I may be wrong, since i never went
there, but It might have been at 1015.  or even at the Sound Factory,
cause i know that Gus Worked there promoting a Gay saturday night when
the club first opened up.  And then it moved over to 1015, and was
called "product" or something like that... 

Anyways, If anyone can remeber, I sure would like to know...  It would
make a great chapter for my book.

Keep it real

And abuse is generally classified as usage in a manner that a doctor 
would not approve of, right?  Of course, those who abuse drugs like to 
alter this definition so it doesn't include them.  A person who does E 
once a month might define abuse as doing E once a week.  Or someone who 
does E once a week might define abuse as doing something that is 
physically addictive.   etc etc etc.

Hi SFraves,

After some failed attempts to hook up with a few people over the net
on the purchase of some turntables, I have decided to just drive up to
Berkeley or SF this weekend to buy them NEW.

I want to buy turntables for two primary reasons - I want to make mix
tapes of all sorts of music (drum&bass, post-rock/mathrock, guitar
ambient/drone) for myself and my friends - and I need a record player
because I don't have one.

So can those of you out there well versed with the technicalities and
justifications of what to buy and what to avoid please help out a
newbie?  I've been told by a number of DJs that Technics 1200's should
be the turntables I buy, and the mixers have been a jumble of names
that i can't remember.

Price really isn't an issue, since I've already conceded to buying
NEW, but if you know of a location that has good prices, I'll be ever
so grateful. 

thanks much, peace.

- DJ Newbie

Years ago when I went to Germany my clubbing friends there introduced me

in the states...

Well, now it's being test marketed in the Bay Area. BUY THIS DRINK!! I
tell ya it's the best energy drink I've ever had. And it's an awsome
drink to have before a party.

So next weekend when you make that traditional stop at the 7-11 for your
blowpops, buy a few cans of RED BULL!!!

I remember this drink.  I heard that it has soooo much caffine and other 
stuff in it that it was illegal in some European countries.  Does anyone 
know if this is true and/or if this test market drink has the same levels as 
in Europe?

     Peace all,
     
     Does Hyperreal happen to have a mirror site anywhere, specifically the 
     famous party calendar page(aside from the weekly calendar)?  friggin 
     firewall problems... Any info would be delightful. Love thy neighbor!

This sounds really beautiful, but I am really worried that this is not what
Yosemite needs -- a bunch of ravers descending on a beautiful natural
place, taking a lot of drugs, trampeling the environment, and leaving trash
and cigarette butts everywhere in their path.

Am I a cynic or a realist? :-( I really hope for the best but I have been
one of the last persons at too many parties picking up HUGE piles of trash
left behind by thoughtless ravers, and it really saddened me.

Please add me to the mailing list, I promise I don't leave trash in my
wake, and I really love Yosemite.

     the stuff in redbull, it called 'taurin' (not caffine).in some 
     european countries (austria, netherlands) the have a red bull version 
     with more taurin. in germany we have a version with less taurin. a 
     actual cocktail is red bull with vodka.
     its true that you go really speedy with this stuff, but you can also 
     get very aggressive.
     When you need a stronger energy drink take 'flying horse' or 10 
     caffeine tabs (its cheaper, and is also legal).

Hi everyone.

I blind copied some of you on this so if you are on SFRavEs and get it
twice.  that's why.

just reminding you that some of us will be at Whole Foods in Palo Alto
tomorrow at Noon.  there is a walk-up cefeteria there with lots of
nutritious and maybe not so nutrituious foods.

and if you wanna get foggy, do it on your own time.  i mean before or after
you get there.  i suggest before if you're gonna do it at all cause then
you'll be hungry and thirsty.

ok, you little lover-people...go make a difference tonight and i''ll see
you all tomorrow!

love, dEEp!

ps. if you don't know how to get to whole foods in palo alto, someone put
exact directions a while back ,but i dont think i saved them.  i just know
like 1100 something emerson st. palo alto.  near universtity.

Wayne, don't worry... there isn't going to be a bunch of ravers
descending upon Yosemite Valley...
(the entire group numbers about 20 people now)
And its not that much of a party... Saturday I'm leading beginning
climbing and rapelling "classes" for those who
Are interested.... and on Sat night we're heading outside the park to
BLM land where we are going to all camp 
together and play Some music... really low key though... and we're
bringing tons of trashbags and plan to be very respetful
Of the environment-Sunday there is a bunch of us heading to hike the
halfdome trail... so its really not
A party-more like a cool mellow camping trip with ravers from both
lists-a great chance to talk, share,
And grow in one of the most beautiful places on earth (besides the
Trocadero or the San Bernadino Sports Arena) (hee hee 
Sarcasm!)

Glad you're coming...  

gEoff ;)

Hey Adam, I just got back from spending close to 8 months livin in Fulham,
London.  There is definately a scene there.  The partys start down by club
606, that is down Fulham Road, ya know where Sid and Johnny formed the Sex
Pistols, a left on Broadway and down toward the Brittain Gas Co.  606 is a
pretty cool jazz bar, met many a raver there.  from there it is about a 5-10
minute walk to the Derby cafe, by the mini grand prix raceway.  try going on
a saturday nite at ~ 11pm you can not miss the lights thumps etc.

When in doubt goto The End, a nite when LTJ is spinning, ask for Slim, lanky
brit type.  he will hook you up.  

PS Manchester goes off.  Try Sankeys

        Hello!

        Can I get in one more vote for the most loving person!?? =)

        You know him, you love him, he is MY best friend in the world and
        just happens to be one bad-ass jungle dj...

        Yes, it's Mr. Noah(Siphon)Ruiz! This guy is so giving and loving and
        is always there for the people that he loves. He is the one who first
        introduced me to raving and got me hooked!

        I am lucky enough to be able to work with him and see him everday and
        today he even brought me a rose and a teddy bear because I was having
        a bad morning, thank you sweetie!

        I don't post often ( ok, at all - fear of flames! ) but I couldn't pass
        up this opportunity to cast my vote for the sweetest, most loving,
        supportive, comforting, best advice giving, cutest raver boy, funny,
        smartest ( are you nauseaus yet? =b ) person in my life!

        Thank you Noah, I love you with all my heart!

        luvies,

Hello.

I subscribed to this list because James (my wonderful friend) and I will
be staying in San Francisco (probably N. Beach) from July 31- Aug. 18.
We're very excited because it will be our first time on the W
coast......but we don't have a clue about the clubs or raves over there.
The only party we know about is the Off the Streets Record Release. It
sounded like a great change from the materialistic, brainless events
here (Florida)-- so we're definitely going. 
If anyone can tell us about some great events, clubs, etc. in SF please
email us- it will be appreciated.

Thanks
Ivy :)

So there's this one person that I want to nominate (so what if I've 
already nominated people!)
I've only really hung out with her twice, but she's a very supportive 
person with a good head on her shoulders.  She seems to always be there 
to encourage me to do whatever naughty things I feel hesitant about doing 
and she just has a nice vibe to her all the way around.

So what if she doesn't really know how to get out of the way of flying 
boat parts?!  Who cares about a black eye!

Anyway, since I think it probably would be bad form for you to nominate 
yourself :D  I hereby nominate Diana Greer!  :P

If you haven't met her, you should make an effort to do so!

I was just going to nominate myself.. because lately I've been spoiling
myself and getting to know me better.... You are right.. you can't love
someone else until you love yourself....

Sweetdreams everyone.

See my view on drugs is also dont abuse them. I don't really see them as
a drug if used properly. I know that a certain drug has helped me
realize things on a hihgly positive scale and have changed me into a
much much more open minded and positive loving person. If used as
self-medication drugs can work wonders. Abuse is a really problem!!
Luv,
Paul

Welllllll..... I must agree with Blake, $25 was toooo much to pay. This party
was nothing near the last one, but it had it's good points. I didn't care for
the music as much as I could have, and the chill room was anything but chill,
but the vibe was descent, once you got past the wardens at the door, and
after you got over the shock of hearing that it was $25. They should have
made that more clear. Besides all that, I had a great timE! Went to the
afterparty too, where they charged us $5 to get in, but since I had my
laminate, they gave us a good group rate. Oh well, all in all I had a good
time, and was glad to have gone and met all the smiles that I got to meet.
That's my report....

this cat refers to fsol as "basic"??!!

future sound of london may be well known, but they are well known not
because of catchy marketing schemes and catering to the mtv generation, but
because they create ground breaking, innovative, creative and beautiful
soundscapes that are quite deserving of the public eye.  i consider their
music anything BUT basic.  just because an artist is recognized by the
mainstream does not mean that their expression is "basic"....

on a similar note, just because something is underground and not well known
does not mean that it is good music.  like the mainstream scene, i hear
plenty of ug music that is pure rubbish.

fsol strives beyond every endeavor with each successive album they release.
if this person actually listened to the music he was making a judgment
about, he would know this quite well....

lifeforms as a piece of ambient experimentation is ahead of its time, and
set the stage for much in the ambient genre.

isdn is conceptually intriguing and pretty darn funky to boot.

accelerator as a dance album is extremely cohesive and better than many
techno artists could release on the whole.

dead cities as a concept album is absolutely brilliant.

let's *know* the music we are making sa generalization about before making
the generalization, please.

that is all.

love,
lola

Hello everyone, its jsl's girlfriend, Megan, again.  This conversation has
disturbed me and I feel the need to respond.

While I agree that people will only stop abusing drugs when they,
themselves, are ready, I disagree that, as a friend, you can't have
influence on them.  Granted, you may be pushed away.  This is what drug
addicts do; sometimes they don't even need a reason.  But is that the real
issue?  As a true friend, your concern for the abusers opinion of you
should not override your concern for thier safety.  What is friendship,
anyway, if we can't talk to eachother about the hard stuff?

There are ways to communicate concern without coming off as pushy.  Focus
on the positive things you like about the person & why their drug abuse may
be threating those qualities.  No matter how much they resist hearing you,
don't let them get away with hurting themselves.  Speaking up will at least
let them know that someone notices what they are doing.  (Sometimes the
only reason for drug abuse is the pursuit of attention.)  A little nudge
from the outside can spawn a great recovery.

If you consider yourself a true friend, you owe it to your friend to try to
help them.  Your help may be refused but you've got to, at least, try.
They may push you away initially, but believe me, in the end, they will
remember the people who challenged their destructive behavior.  And they
will come back to thank you.  If they push you away and you never hear from
them again, their problem is probably bigger than you want to deal with,
anyway.  Do you really want a chonic drug abuser in your life?  Is that
friendship?  I don't think so.

And yes, I know all of this from experience.  I've been on both sides of
the equation.  And I remember the people who challenged me.  I didn't want
to hear what they were saying, but it needed to be said.  I am forever
grateful to them for helping me pull my head out of my ass.  I couldn't
have done it alone.

Thanks... that's all til the next time I poke my nose in.
Megan

Goodnight. I hope to see you all soon.  You will all be in my dreams
dancing and playing on the San Doons at the beach, listening to the
music bringing your spirit and soul into our mother earth. The ocean
waves crashing into the rocks, The earth is talking to us. Open you
mind, open your heart, open your body, open your soul.  Listen to
what she is saying.

I can now sleep knowing you will all be in my dreams. Take care. I
love you all.

Try this, point to point directions on yahoo? It's easy
www.yahoo.com, Select maps, then select point to point and there you
go.  Now enter where you are, then where you need to go and it brings
up a whole map, even tells you where to turn and the # of miles
between each turn..  It's kool.  Try It.

					Take Care,

AMEN!!!  I swear I have never been so fascinated with a music group
before.  These two guys have always been able to set the standard for
what techno is going to become.  There work is very groundbreaking and
also allows other techno groups to follow their ways.

So very TRUE.

>and

Show me any FSOL album that isn't way ahead of its time in one way or
another.

>isdn is conceptually intriguing and pretty darn funky to boot.

Good music after the herb.

>accelerator as a dance album is extremely cohesive and better than 
>many
>techno artists could release on the whole.

Did you know that shit (accelerator) was released in '92?  Compare that
dance music to anything else around that time.  They sound so much like
what we listen to today proving that they set the standard for techno
today.  If it wasn't for groups like FSOL, techno would never evolve
nearly as fast as it has in the last 5 or 6 years.

It's groups like FSOL that make me love ambient so much.  I mean, my
little goal is to someday get a couple turntables along with a mixer. 
The only problem is that I don't know if I want to spin ambient or GOA
trance.  It's groups like FSOL that make me want to spin ambient.

Well, good bye everyone and ya'll have a good day.

Yea.. I heard she plays the choice jungle.

 I have one of her records. It's kind of hard to mix in with my other
jungles. Matching the beat that is.
 I will be right up front boogying to her tunes. I hope my Funky Techno
Tribe dance thingie doesn't distract her to much. Huh Deepfog?

 Oh.

when I moved here in '92, Colossus had started and yes it did later   
become Product.  I remember a flyer which was an obscene size and had a   
shirltess amn on the front in jeans with a huge eye in a Townsend Street   
location.  I don't remember it being at 1015 but I may be wrong.....

I remember Colossus Club, Gus Been used to promote it, But I thought
that it used to be at 177 townsend?  I may be wrong, since i never went
there, but It might have been at 1015.  or even at the Sound Factory,
cause i know that Gus Worked there promoting a Gay saturday night when
the club first opened up.  And then it moved over to 1015, and was
called "product" or something like that...

Anyways, If anyone can remeber, I sure would like to know...  It would
make a great chapter for my book.

FSOL is beautiful. I remember the first time I heard them in 92'.. on the
soundtrack to COOL WORLD... "papua new guinea". God I love that song. They
are so talented.

And to continue what Drek was saying... Oop!.. that's Derek.... I think
it's really cool how an artist can compell you to spin a certain kinda of
music. It's that connect you make with the music that makes you a DJ....
the love you feel for it, the way it touches your soul...

I wish you guys could have been inside me to feel the
joy/ecstacy/happiness/serenity I felt when I heard LTJ BUKEM spin live....
man... I can never get enough...... in fact I'm listening to it right now
at work... :) This CD is going to have grooves in it soon...

I hope you all have a really nice day.. and learn something knew about
yourself.... and perhaps understand yourself more....

Hi-

Does anybody know of any cool RealAudio sites I can go to to listen to some
music.  I like to listen to everything, so any suggestions would be
welcome.

-Thanks, Todd

Then is it ok for people to bring their crack pipes? How bout bringing
heroin? Sorry, I know what your intent is, I just find it ironic sometimes
that there is now a specifically *stated* "non-acceptable" drug at
party. Better start making a bigger list... ;-)

There is a place Http://www.liveconcerts.com that has old concerts 
archived that you can listen to the whole show.  
Http://www.betalounge.com has dj's sets archived and sometimes whole 
raves like the recent Funky Techno Tribe.  Http://www.webrock.com has 
more rock but every once in a while they have some good selections.  Also 
if you go to Realaudio's home page at Http://www.Realaudio.com they will 
have some links to follow.

Hey everybody,

I just wanted to voice my opinion on a little thing that is starting
to become popular and you all guessed it (Drum roll please) the $25
dollar party trend it seems that the last few big parties have been
asking for $25  and from what people have posted it seems like they
were not even worth $20 let alone $25 This is real distrubing to me
cause productions have gotten smaller and shitter and prices have
gotten higher. I remember back in the day when some promoters charged 
25 at least the party was worth it like FTT did some partys for that
price but they put a lot into there parties by having tribal dancers
good lights visuals lasers etc?? and at one FTT I remember they had a
30 Ft. Alien that spit out fire in the middle on the night and I just
said Damn this was worth my money. Now some promoters put a lot into
there parites and offer several arenas of dance music and bouncy
castles and ferris wheels and stuff like that so I understand them
charging a high price but for people that don't have all that just a
big wherehouse with minimal lights and stuff it upsets me. I dont want
to point any fingers or anything but it is just sad. Now I have helped
out with some big parties and stuff so I have a general Idea of how
much a big party cost and I just dont see the justifaction in charging
$25 if Harmony can do a big party with 2 sound systems 2 multi colored
lasers chill area and all the other amenities and still charge $20 I
think everyone else can as well I know for a fact that there party
cost plenty and they may have not made a lot of $$ or even any at all
but they put on a good party. And isn't that what it is about?  I am
starting to ramble so I will shut up know I just think it is sick that
these people are in some cases raping there patrons. I know some one
will probably flame me for my views but that is Ok cause I am not
accusing any one promoter if your shit is real you have not need to
defend yourself. 

Peace love,
Macadio

In my humble opinion, the only party that is worth that kind
of $$ is The Gathering.  Or a multi-day extravaganza like the
upcoming Harmony Anniversary (no, that's not a plug...or is it?).
It appears that the people who set admission prices are not
keeping the target market in mind: mostly youngish people with
mostly limited incomes (if any).  I've seen far too many $15 parties
as well, some of which I attended, and came away feeling that I
didn't get the most bang for my buck.
Well, enough of that.  Just thought I'd add some change...
Peace,
Eric

Thanks to everybody out there who replied to my realaudio post.  I'm

Actually, are there any sites with archived music that ISN'T 28.8
REALAUDIO (which sux unless you enjoy the sound of a pocket AM radio),
like perhaps MPEG-2 or something? After all, if it's archived, I really
couldn't care less about receiving in "real-time". I'd be just as happy
to get a higher sample rate, stereo file that is huge and takes all
night to download. That's what sleep is for -- so you can upload and
download big files :-).

Other suggestions??

Also, y'all might wanna check these:

-In case your getting this twice, sorry ,but I don't think that it
actually got sent the first time-

Boy is that one a tuffy! There are a lot of people who I feel have been
there for me when I needed them. Out of all of them. The most I am
gratful to are.

Victoria, Anny Ting, & Russ.
They have been there for me at times when It was really tough. I don't
think I could have continued without them being there.

Victoria: I have known since 3rd grade and we have been good friends for
many years. She brought me to my first party and has always chosen me
over her mom and given me a place to sleep when I needed one. She was
there for me when i needed to talk to. I know I can forever count on
here any time any day. And she can count on me to no matter what.

Anny Ting: A great friend to talk to when I have been having emotional
problems. Helped me sort out feelings and she has always seemed to make
me feel better. This is one of the few people in who's arms I cried in.

Russ: What can I say. For the short time I have known him, he has been
there for me during and indredibly difficult, and scary acid trip. He
kept me sane and held my hand all the way through. He has also helped me
out with many things and I don't think he realizes how mush I appreciate
his friendship.

There are a whole lot of people that I love a lot also. Too many to
name, but It could be fun to try. 

Love,
Paul

P.S.

Oh and Leslie has been there to make me grow up and realize how dumb I
was and to give me many chances. This may not sound like good things to
do, but sometimes we need to be told straight out. I love her and always
feel safer knowing she is at a rave.

Heck, there's even been parties with, top notch DJs, 3 sound systems;
lights, lazers, and all the trimmings for, what? - $5.

Raves don't have to be a business; that many of them are represents nothing
more than a decision by that promoter to treat it as such.

I'm not opposed to raves that are run as business ventures, some dear
friends make their living this way, but the world also very much needs
raves that come from a different place.

How nice that here in the bay area we have a wealth of both to choose from.

see ya

If you have an ISDN or faster connection, set your Real Audio preferences
accordingly and try the Beta Lounge.  At 40kps the sound quality is much
better than AM radio, kinda like an el-cheapo radio shack fm jobber...  

I thought the registered version had a perfect play feature?

between the loop, they seem to occasionally put on a scifi-flick
outtake ("i am locutus of borg, resistance is futile")... then i heard
a station id where they said "this is kbgg... we now return you to our 
irregular programming"). 

i also saw something in the paper about how darien o'toole (the
attitude with ovaries morning talk-show person) got the boot from KBGG
since they're changing format to "adult contemporary" or something like
that.

i never listened to that station before, but one thing we don't need is
another adult contemporary station. i was kinda hoping they'd have a 24
hour techno/electronica station. now that'd be a good format for radio,
'cept it would be hard to do a smooth mix if you had to interrupt your
progression with some dinglebutt screaming "COME TO GRANDMA'S USED CAR
JUNK-SHION AND PICK UP A NEWLY REFURBISHED JAGUAR/BMW/MERCEDES TODAY SO
YOU CAN MACK ON ALL FINE GOLD DIGGERS OUT THERE" every 5ive minutes...).

They are in the process of upgrading and preparing
for initial contact...
please be patient as alien technology is a bit tricky 
to interface with.

they were mixing in live conversations from the MIR
space station a few minites ago and now carl sagan
is speaking about traveling to the stars...

 You sound just like one of the receptionists at my work. She is always
sharing with me, the wonderfull feeling it is to be pregnant.
 Didn't you and your boyfriend for two years just break it off? Your
already looking for a mate?



Just playing.
Night, night.
Jeff

<< SIGNS THAT YOU ARE TOO DRUNK:
  
  You lose arguments with inanimate objects.
  
  You have to hold onto the lawn to keep from falling off the earth.
  
  Job interfering with your drinking.
  
  Your doctor finds traces of blood in your alcohol stream.
  
  Career won't progress beyond Senator from Massachusetts.
  
  The back of your head keeps getting hit by the toilet seat.
  
  Sincerely believe alcohol to be the elusive 5th food group.
  
  24 hours in a day, 24 beers in a case - coincidence?? - I think not!
  
  Two hands and just one mouth... - now THAT'S a drinking problem!
  
  You can focus better with one eye closed.
  
  The parking lot seems to have moved while you were in the bar.
  
  You fall off the floor...
  
  Your twin sons are named Barley and Hops.
  
  Hey, 5 beers has just as many calories as a burger, screw dinner!
  
  Mosquitoes catch a buzz after attacking you
  
  At AA meetings you begin: "Hi, my name is... uh..."
  
  Your idea of cutting back is less salt.
  
  You wake up in the bedroom, your underwear is in the bathroom, you fell
  asleep clothed. - hmm.
  
  The whole bar says 'Hi' when you come in...
  
  You think the Four Basic Food Groups are Caffeine, Nicotine, Alcohol, and
  [Women or Men].
  
  Every night you're beginning to find your roommate's cat more and more
  attractive.
  
  Roseanne looks good.
  
  Don't recognize wife unless seen through bottom of glass.
  
  That damned pink elephant followed me home again.
  
  Senators Kennedy and Packwood shake their heads when they walk past you.
  
  I'm as jober as a sudge.
  
  The shrubbery's drunk from too frequent watering.
  
  You wake up screaming "TORO TORO TORO!" in the middle of the night.

Booooo.  The fun is over.  Sounds like they've changed to an average top 40 station.  Kiss FM.

Wasnt Kiss FM the name of the old all techno station down in LA??  Or was that Mars FM......

my 98.1 experience....12:20pm thru 1:10 pm
<enter vehicle>
 tink..tink bwooossh tink tink bwooosh...for so long..they were then
sampling both the Apollo 13 mission as well as the MIR transmissions.
even over each other...  then back down to tink..tink bwooossh tink tink
bwooosh. finally  they began to break in with a radio tuning
sample."twweek woooonk....tweek..woooosssseeeaaarrr pop! ....then"
"you are witnessing the birth of a new radio station......what you hear
today will change tomorrow. this is ......w>>>"
(couldn't make out the call letters)
<exit  vehicle....eat lunch>
burrito....yum ;)
<enter vehicle>
after getting back from lunch I heard them annoucing their new radio
station again.....
(and once again I couldn't make out the call letters)

then finally they busted into some music. =(

I think it was Funkytown......hmm....could be another 70's station. I
only heard 2 tracks...both disco esque......kinda a letdown after all
that cool space stuff....
<exit vehicle>
well....the samples and the minimal background stuff was really
cool.......still hoping for the late nite programming  to be a bit more
do de do do..dwooo   "out there"

	My best friend got a job for a comic book studio and subsequently he can't
move to Fremont with us.  We're desperately needing a roommate.  

	You'll have to share a room with me but trust me the apartment is big.
Rent is around $350, 2 bedrooms, 2 baths, vaulted ceiling (I creamed when
they told me this particular unit was available)....

	Hm..... what else....?

	Well, the only qualifications are that you kinda need to be young (18-25),
dependable, financially stable, and clean.  Sanity is a plus but by no
means necessary.  If you're interested please mail me back!!!!  : )

	Nico

My god this line-up sounds amazing!  I do wish that I could go, but
after a full month of raving every weekend, I made othe obligations. 
Looks like there will be some mind-blowing goa! 

Is there still a goa list going on?  Anyone that knows please email me

Amy

Hey there everyone for those of you that I have not had the priveledge 
of knowing or being introduced to, I thankfully have been aquainted with 
the party scene in the last month or so.  I give all my thanks to the 
Harmony crew that hang out at City Espresso, for without them and all 
there help I would still just be a lame mocha maker.  I know Ive been 
missing out on a lot but there still is a lot more to experience--just 
not crystal meth  ;(---not a happy thing .  I recognize some names on 
sfraves, and I am looking forward to meeting more of you in the future,   
Take care all. Love yourselves and everyone else to the fullest!
                                   Big baBy

It looks like Cyborganic will soon be moving out of it's 654 Mission
location:

---

...(1) We are actively seeking a new tenant to assume the lease on our space
here at 654 Mission. (Please see the message following for complete
details; please contact me immediately if you or your company might be
interested.)

(2) Our servers may be moving from our 654 Mission location to a new
colocation facility at some time during the evening of Thursday 24 July....

---

The Cyborganic Community has been especially cool to the Rave Community
allowing us to do parties, dinners and planning meetings there.  If
you get a chance to thank any of them, I would strongly suggest it.  Even
though it was used a lot, 654 Mission hosted some of the best parties
this city has seen recently.

The minute i heard my first love story
I started looking for you, not knowing
how blind that was.

Lovers dont finally meet somewhere,
they are in each other all along.

Hey! does anyone know where I can find Groove Radio these days?
I used to listen to the Swedish Eagle (the DJ who ran the show)
religously...taping all the late nite shows...then the station in
Boulder, CO that carried the show dropped it or something and I haven't
been able to find out where/when its on if at all since that time. (like
2 years ago) is it still on?

Anyone......anyone.......

Of course it was nothing compared to Saturday nites on KZSU....Radon's
show is awesome!  =)

I think we should start a newsgroup for SF Clubbers. We need more discussion
and reviews about the clubs in town, hteir DJ's, sound systems, music,
security, bartenders, etc.

Any advice anyone about starting a thread on SF Clubs? Anyone know of another
newsgroup  on clubs.

 Here is a goodbye from a most special human being. Jess is the kind of 
person that makes you feel really good about being a human being.

 She definately gets my vote as most loveable.

Hi everybody- those who know me and those who don't.

  I've gotta unsubscribe now- I'm losing this account and I'm leaving the
country for a while.... However if you need to get ahold of me, my sister
will be reading my email & mailing me (snail mail) anything important-  my
new email address is
  
Jesberkson@aol.com.  

This is my permanent address for life - and I will always be able to be
reached there.  Pretty much.

I'll subscribe again next spring.

so bye bye until then.

With all the outdoor party/campouts and BBQ's
going on next month...I thought this was something
to think about.

><{{{"> <"}}}>< 

Its true - check out the web site for the pictures, video and t-shirt...


<<Our subject today is lighting charcoal grills.  One of our favorite 
charcoal grill lighters is a guy named George Goble (really!!), a 
computer person in the Purdue University engineering department.
     
Each year, Goble and a bunch of other engineers hold a picnic in West 
Lafayette, Indiana, at which they cook hamburgers on a big grill.  Being 
engineers, they began looking for practical ways to speed up the 
charcoal-lighting process.
     
"We started by blowing the charcoal with a hair dryer," Goble told me in 
a telephone interview.  "Then we figured out that it would light faster 
if we used a vacuum cleaner."
     
If you know anything about (1) engineers and (2) guys in general, you 
know what happened:  The purpose of the charcoal-lighting shifted from 
cooking hamburgers to seeing how fast they could light the charcoal.
     
>From the vacuum cleaner, they escalated to using a propane torch, then
an acetylene torch.  Then Goble started using compressed pure oxygen, 
which caused the charcoal to burn much faster, because as you recall from

chemistry class, fire is essentially the rapid combination of oxygen with

a reducing agent (the charcoal).  We discovered that a long time ago, 
somewhere in the valley between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers (or 
something along those lines).
     
By this point, Goble was getting pretty good times.  But in the world of 
competitive charcoal-lighting, "pretty good" does not cut the mustard.
     
Thus, Goble hit upon the idea of using - get ready - liquid oxygen.  This

is the form of oxygen used in rocket engines; it's 295 degrees below zero

and 600 times as dense as regular oxygen.  In terms of releasing energy, 
pouring liquid oxygen on charcoal is the equivalent of throwing a live 
squirrel into a room containing 50 million Labrador retrievers.  On 
Gobel's World Wide Web page (the address is http://ghg.ecn.purdue.edu/), 
you can see actual photographs and a video of Goble using a bucket 
attached to a 10-foot-long wooden handle to dump 3 gallons of liquid 
oxygen (not sold in stores) onto a grill containing 60 pounds of charcoal

and a lit cigarette for ignition.

What follows is the most impressive charcoal-lighting I have ever seen,
featuring a large fireball that according to Goble, reached 10,000 
degrees Fahrenheit.  The charcoal was ready for cooking in - this has to 
be a world record - 3 seconds.
     
There's also a photo of what happened when Goble used the same technique 
on a flimsy $2.88 discount-store grill.  All that's left is a circle of 
charcoal with a few shreds of metal in it.  "Basically, the grill 
vaporized," said Goble.  "We were thinking of returning it to the store 
for a refund."
     
Looking at Goble's video and photos, I became, as an American, allchoked 
up with gratitude at the fact that I do not live anywhere near the 
engineers' picnic site.  But also, I was proud of my country for 
producing guys who can be ready to barbecue in less time than it take for

guys in less-advanced nations, such as France, to spit.
     
Will the 3-second barrier ever be broken?  Will engineers come up with a 
new, more powerful charcoal-lighting technology?  It's something for all 
of us to ponder this summer as we sit outside, chewing our hamburgers, 
every now and then glancing in the direction of West Lafayette, Indiana, 
looking for a mushroom cloud.>>

Hey guys, it's me dErEk.  I'm just sitting here taking a break from my
preparation for a presentation.  I'm thinking about tomorrow (Thursday)
and how it is an extremely big day in my life.  It starts off by taking a
big test in Psyhology.  Then I have to quickly drive up to Richmond for a
job interview with Zeneca, a chemical manufacturing company.  This is for
a good paying job (in terms of 19 year olds) and the interview shall
consist of getting drilled for 3 1/2 hours by 4 different teams of
scientists.  Then after that I have to drive to Livermore and take a test
in my Art class.  Afterwards, I have to give a presentation to the 50
kids in my Art class.

Point being that tomorrow is going to be tough and if you know me
personally or just know, or for that matter, don't know me at all; just
keep good vibes in your head for me 'cause I'm gonna need all the help I
can get tomorrow.

I can't wait till True Love so I can just vent any frustrations I have in
a loving way.

Good bye, and I hope all of you have an excellent day tomorrow.

dErEk

Oh no.. Nothing can top my last headline.

"16 year old kid seeks revenge by murdering x-girlfriends teddybear."




But that was along time ago. I have matured alittle since then.

I don't breakdance.. That was like back in junior high when I used to like
songs like "beat street is where it's at" and I always had an open wound in
the middle of my back.

Subject: SRR:  Happy Hardcore Question
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.org
Precedence: bulk

Hey, I've listened to 2 types of music that are both supposed to be happy 
hardcore, and I was wondering which one of them is _really_ happy hardcore, or 
if maybe they're both are happy hardcore, just different types of it or 
something like that . . .

Anyway the first type I heard was this CD called "Happy 2b Hardcore."  It just 
sounded like diva house music sped up really fast, and it was super happy.

The second type I heard was a import CD compilation I just bought called the 
"Best of Happy Hardcore."  This sounded like jungle, as in there was hella 
breakbeat, but not as dark or angry as some jungle tends to be.  It had a more 
complex sound than "Happy 2b Hardcore," which is a little repetitive.

So which of these is true happy hardcore?

And can anyone recommend some good happy hardcore CDs that I can buy?

Thanx a million
xoxo--Miccaela

Well, as far as I remember when I was last in LA, Groove Radio was playing
almost all very commercial, very OVERground house and dance music.  I once
heard Joey Beltram's "Energy Flash" mixed in, but it was quite a shock.
The rest of the time, I had a difficult time stomaching most of what they
play.  It seemed like a cool idea to have a dedicated "dance" station, but
I'm extremely disappointed by the result.  

We actually have quite a bit of underground electronic music on the radio
up here.  There's an extensive listing on the sfraves calendar:

http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/sf/calendar/gencal.cgi#radio

My personal pick would have to be Shortwave on Sunday nights at KALX 90.7fm
in Berkeley, but that's because I dj there :)  The number of electronic
radio shows has grown significantly in the last year though.  Almost all on
college stations as well, which means NO commercials :)  And don't forget
the Beta Lounge webcast.  Lots of great stuff to choose from, I'd say...

Yeah Groove Radio plays all your favorite over played tracks... mostly 
cheese-ball commercial house and cheese-ball trance.  

BUT

The thing is I probably wouldn't mind most of the tracks on Groove if I 
didn't hear them once an hour (or more) every time I turn the station 
on.  

Really really late at night/early in the morning they spin more 
underground stuff, and on Sunday nights there are some really cool shows 
like the Groove Radio International countdown.  All-in-all you wind up 
realizing that they need to pay their bills just like any other radio 
station, but at least some really good stuff is getting some airtime.  

They have realAudio from their web page, I think... www.grooveradio.com

Heya gang!

Yup. It's that time again.

More dark and rollin' Drum and Bass!

2 different ones this time: One by RINSE, One by the Mouse man, JASON MOUSE.

15 of each, randomly selected for mailout. 

Don't worry. They're both real good.  :)

Mail me your snail addy and I'll get it out this week.

Yeah, the new format sucks as bad as the old format did. The new 98.1
"KISS FM" is playing Brandi, Toni Toni Tone, Luther Vandross, and
Michael Jackson's "I'll be There" right now. Adult contemporary indeed.
More like the shit that KSOL/KMEL would play if they had the "fuck music
hour". Well, at least they don't interrupt the flow of velveeta jism
with endless "shout outs"....

I'll stick to KZSU (90.1), KALX (90.7), KPOO (89.5), KPFA (94.1), KUSF
(90.3), and KFJC (89.7 ... when I can actually receive it in SF).

Next...

Mr. 2 wants to know:

What was it like the 1st time you went to a rave, and what were your 1st impressions?

Music, lights, people, etc.???

Has anyone heard yet whether it was indeed Andrew Cunanan on that houseboat?

Kind of hard to believe that he partied down at 1015 back in the day at Colossus.

Goodnight, Mr. 2

thanks for the info....I only knew Groove Radio as a show on wednesday or
mabye it was friday...dunno....nites. It used to start at like 1:30 am and
go till 3 or so. It was hosted by the Sweedish Eagle or Egil (sp>?) It was
the "countdown"....he'd mix the top 20 or so tracks from the Intnl.
charts...some of the tracks rocked...and I hear them all over the place,
others were ok....This was while I was living in Boulder, CO. ...so some
local radio station was cool enough to carry just the countdown show once a
week. 
>grin<  its all coming together now.....

Yeah Groove Radio plays all your favorite over played tracks... mostly 
cheese-ball commercial house and cheese-ball trance.  

BUT

The thing is I probably wouldn't mind most of the tracks on Groove if I 
didn't hear them once an hour (or more) every time I turn the station 
on.  

Really really late at night/early in the morning they spin more 
underground stuff, and on Sunday nights there are some really cool shows 
like the Groove Radio International countdown.  All-in-all you wind up 
realizing that they need to pay their bills just like any other radio 
station, but at least some really good stuff is getting some airtime.  

They have realAudio from their web page, I think... www.grooveradio.com

>So which of these is true happy hardcore?

to be quite frank, i haven't heard either of the albums. but from the track
listing on "happy 2b hardcore", it doesn't really sound like a good hh-album.
but then again, that's just what i think. =) but hh these days has a lot of
breakbeats in it. basically, the typical hh song is a straight 4/4 beat, you
get some sped-up vocals, and a breakbeat. and if you're lucky, there's a
piano riff thrown in there somewhere. =)))

>And can anyone recommend some good happy hardcore CDs that I can buy?

sure can. check in the import sections and see if you can find:
rave collision (compilation on broken beats records)
anything with dj paul elstak (his first mix cd is amazing)
anything with dj slipmatt

want more recommendations? lemme know. =)

  Well, depending who you ask, people have lots of ideas about what happy
  hardcore is. Currently the sound of happy hardcore is (IMO) similar to
  the sound of UK hardcore circa early 90's. Happy Hardcore generally
  (at least in S.Cali) isn't associated with Jungle, ALTHOUGH - I have in
  my possesion a 'happy hardcore' tape that I mail ordered from some DJ
  from New Jersey two years ago which contained a lot of junglish tunes in
  it, which I am really opposed to (at least under the name HH). IMO,
  the CD with the divas sounds more like 'true' HH.

		  http://www.ravenetwork.com/~hardcore

E>And can anyone recommend some good happy hardcore CDs that I can buy?

  I always liked Happy Rave '95 despite the fact that I obtained it
  through Columbia House. Its kinda housey though at points. Otherwise,
  its a REALLY good compilation of HH.

De-Lurking:  I saw this in the L.A. Dining and Nightlife, "bombastic
sounds of house music" Oh! Brother!  Any comments?






                    Raves and Groovers

                   "Nearly a decade ago, house music fans crammed into
                      warehouses
                    and other unconventional spaces around the world  
                      dressed in gym
                    wear, especially anything by Adidas, and T-shirts 
                      and accessories
                    depicting Sesame Street, Dr. Seuss and Disney     
                      characters. Their
                    parties were called raves, and they were one-night
                      celebrations in
                    the name of technology, peace and global
community. 

                    The raves dwindled, especially in L.A., as police 
                      became more
                    savvy on how to bust them. Most were, after all,  
                      held illegally.
                    Gangbangers also crashed the party, having no     
                      concern for the
                    message of unity and peace. 

                    It's doubtful that groovers have had as much of an
                      impact
                    internationally as yet. But signs indicate that
this                     is a regenerated,
                    if not slightly revamped, version of rave culture 
                      that began taking
                    shape a couple of years ago. As for when it
decided                      on a name, no
                    one can guess. 

                    Groovers' uniform of their culture is actually a  
                      hodgepodge of
                    pieces from various sports. "Doing battle" means  
                      competition, but
                    their activity of choice is dancing. The          
                      electronically hypnotic,
                    sometimes bombastic sounds of house music serve as
                      their
                    soundtrack. Though no one can say for certain when
                      groovers
                    emerged, the elements that define them are not
new. 

                    Clubs and parties were once affectionately called 
                      raves, but the
                    term has fallen out of vogue due to its           
                      mainstreaming and has yet
                    to be replaced."

Well I, as a 28 year old, am a little offended.....I guess this confirms
that I am in fact OLD!

Hey now.....:-) seeing as how I go to school in Pittsburgh I can 
definitely say this will not work.  There isn't really a lot of 
interesting stuff to do there to keep people entertained.


Question:  **HOW does one get someone to stop doing drugs?**

Answer:  Move to Pittsburgh PA

Hey everyone,  Myself and a few friends are planning on going camping  
up north of Santa Cruz tonight if anyone wants to go, you are more than 
welcome!~!!!  About 5 miles north of santa cruz there is a white, 
reflector fence and an old torn up van on the right side of the 
road...park on the road off to the right before the van so you don't get 
a ticket from the nice Rangers  :) Go across the road and across the 
traintracks and go down the trail on the right , you'll hear us 
hopefully.  We'll be there around 7:00 PM   WE are gonna have a BLAST!
                                      Drive carefully!
                                         BaBY DAN

1st time I ravEd? Aberigionee(sp) at the acme building.

 Hmmm.. Well.. Although people seemed really peacefull and conciderate. It
seemed to me that no one was looking for new friends. They seemed to have
there's and. Well.. I felt like I was pretty much butting in.
 Was 1st time E'ing, felt great. The feeling of floating was phat. Can't
say it felt quite the same agian. It's all down hill from there.. I
remember looking around..Some people looked pretty messed up from abusing E
for to long.  Desided I was going to NOT do it as much as they seem to
have, but ended up doing to much anyways from there on out.
 I noticed people breakdancing..That was a major blast from the past.
 Couldn't keep these two guys from breathing down my neck wispering. Made
me paranoid so I moved elsewhere, because they made me feel like I was
going to be a victom of some gang initiation. I never would of thought
then, that today I would need a rear view mirror.
 I noticed a cute girl giving me the winks. Couple minutes later I noticed
she had some guys hand up her skirt.
 1st time listening to techno.. And found it captivating. Now it's a part
of me, that seems to take up most of my mental resources when it's around.
Making it hard for me to concentrate on much more than te music.
 I noticed that NO ONE was "stomping there feet to the beat" And I had SO
MUCH fun that night. I remember on the drive home...I mentioned to my
friend Wayne about no one stomping there feet to the beat. And I told Wayne
I was going to make the foot stomping dance very popular.

One things for sure. Going to that first ravE didn't make me think I was
going to start smoking agian.



True story.
I don't lie. Unless you ask me what drugs I am on..
Jeff

So it turns out the rumors about the Mayan Galactic celebration
in Mt shasta were not entirely true...well they were
but solutions have been found.

It is still happening and they got a bus going from san francisco
for $20 + $5 for the party.

That's 25 for a 3 day trip/party in mt shasta...incredible.

Any one else riding the bus up?

I hope to see you there....and don't forget this is sacred ground
so be respectful with the trash and stuff.

I am responding about rumors that the Galactic Newyear Festival is not
happening ---IT IS!!!

Ok I am back.  Thanks for e-mailing me about the rumors because now it's
my job to undo them.

Everything is going as planned and even better and a rumor can really
wreck things.

I just found out that Flux and Galena are up at the site right now and
will change the voicemail by tonight.  Please call it later tonight. 
415-331-1500 x722

Your question was about food and camping.  Camping is free, bring your
own food and EVERYTHING you need. No alcohol, weapons, or fireworks. 
The party may be anywhere from 5-10 bucks, and the bus ride is 20 bucks
and is for both ways.

It leaves 150 folsom Fri morn, be there around 9:30 to make sure you get
a seat and so they have time to load in.  I think it's coming back Sun
night.

This party's going to be so great, I can't wait.  Please let people know
what's really happening!  I am bringing a soundsystem so I know FOR SURE
that there will be at least one system,  "THE MUSIC MACHINE"!!!


Ok, peace 
(I need to ground myself-- take a deep breath)

Lisa

PS I am not actively on the raves list so e-mail me directly if you have
any concerns-- I can only answer them until 6pm this evening.  Please
call the VM aft that.

*BLUSH*.... well, I am a grouchy old man. At least in comparison to the
current kkkrop o kkkandy ravers... actually, it's not grouchy, it's
just well tempered by reality. And you know what? OLD is GOOD. GROUCHY
is GOOD. Real positivity means one accepts the grouches as well as the
pollyannas, the young and the over-27. Those with, and without
popsicles, glitter, and vicks-vapo-rub. Even those wearing ugly brown
"graduate student" shoes, unpierced bodies, uncolored hair, etc.
Yea verily. Can I get a witness!

sheez, guys, how do you think *I* feel?  seriously, many of you know how
funny i find it that so many people who are 25-30 bring up how old they feel
in the rave community.  allow me to assure you, feeling old is just a
passing phase... you'll grow out of it if you're lucky!  

love, leslie

  Get on 880 south which will turn into HWY 17 over the santa cruz mtns,  
Once you are in SC take the Half moon bay (HWY 1 North) exit then just 
keep on going for probably a total of 7 miles or so then there will be 
the shittiest looking, thrashed van on the right of the road just past a 
white reflector like fence,,, park down the road right before it you'll 
see our cars probably( the green piece of Honda with the crap inside and 
the other(have no clue,,think Impulse or something?)park infront of us 
okay...Cross hwy 1 and there is a little trail inbetween bushes and 
stuff, about 15 ft, later you'll see the train tracks...The trail 
continues, but splits off into a fork,,,go down the trail on the right 
that goes down and walk 1-2 hundred yards then you'll be at the 
beach,,,We will be to the right,, youll hopefully see a fire and people 
running around naked :)
Have fun & good luck...This message will self destruct once you hit the 
delete button,,,I guess that wouldn't be self destruction though huh?  
Later

    I have a good story to tell everyone, one in which ocurred to me 
early this morning...wish it didn't.  I woke up to work the early shift 
at City Espresso around 6:45 am, took a shower by myself,  got dressed 
in my own clothes and headed out the door.  I sat in my luxurious, 
aqpple green '81 Honda and turned the corner with my cigarette dangling 
ever so gently from my lips. 
    I was sure that I was going to have a great day at work despite the 
sleep deprivation and the fact that I have an oil leak in my car.
    When I turned the corner,  I did not see this beautiful white Ford 
Escort rearing up on my haunches like a bat-outa-hell.  I turned onto 
Lawrence xpwy as usual, except for the fact that there was a blond 
bearded, white-trashy piece of ass staring at me with the most evil 
looking  grin,  the same guy in the Escort.  He was about  a foot from 
my bumper(obviously he did not see my bumper sticker which states: 
"Don't tale gate me or I'll flick a booger on your windshield")  He was 
probably too close to see it.  
    We were stopped at the stoplight and he, of course, being right 
behind me, sticks his head out of his window as if he were going to 
start yelling at me or something, which he did propmtly after he hauked 
a big lugie on my rear windshield.  I replied,  "What the Fuck do you 
think you are doing Mother Fucker?....We exchanged a few words like 
"@$#%#!~~!@##@$##$%$@#$%^^%%^&&&%^*&&()&^**^)%#@@##" and he quickly sped 
off. 
   I was trying to think what type of person he must have been and what 
his occupation might be...I was pretty sure he must be a high school 
guidance counselor...I don't believe that I was the reason for this 
outrage, it must be bad sex or his impotency, dunno.  
   To tell everyone the truth, I had to stop myself from stepping to his 
low by slamming on my breaks as my vehicle quickly started going 
backwards towards him.  Boy it would have been fun though,  but I'll 
save that for people like him.  
  15 dollars in tips later, I am happy as can be, and if I ever see that 
guy again, he left something on my car   :) 
                                     Peace to All,
                                        BaBy HueY

Tim,  I ve been there a couple of times and never busted,, I'm very 
familiar with the area, not bonny or panther, its very secluded and non 
accesible by auto,  the only prob is where you park,  but I appreciate 
the warning very much, 
                                  Always,
                                    Danny

I've found myself referred to as a 'candyraver' lately - presumably b/c I
"attacked" someone with a candy necklace and stickers.  =)  Does wearing some
stickers, glitter and giving out candy make me a candyraver?  I personally
associate that with the ravers that totally get into it and are over the top a
la Paul Hayden, Ivan, etc...

Lovinhugs,
b.

 Vital selections from all corners of the Drum'n Bass world. Support
the 
 SF jungle underground!
 
 -------------------------
 
 Elements of Noise- Torch- Smokers Inc.
 
 The Elements are a couple of the most prolific producers over the
past 
 couple years. From their smooth trancy tracks of old, to their
techstep 
 of new, you can always count on quality and boom on the dance floor. 
 This 12" is really out there! The A-side is a dark, sinister track,
but 
 it starys away from the distortef bass that they commonly use. Nope, 
 this is DEEP. Halfway through this one, it breaks into this string 
 section and then slowly builds with metalic half-beats, eventually 
 rolling down into a dark pit of dispair. Really next level shit!!
 
 Nico & Makai- Omen- NU Black
 
 Tech step pioneer and german nu-schooler combine to form a wacked out 
 track on the No U-Turn sub label. Wikid distorted melody, and
clanging 
 drums make this one a stomper.  Signature Nico bass line drills into 
 your head, just the way they want it to. Wikid.
 
 Future Forces Inc.- Triton- Hardware
 
 The FF team takes a different direction on this long awaited single. 
 Triton has a long drony intro with no bass which eats up half the
side.  The drop is nice and dark with a jumpy break. Flip side is much
   mellower than anything they've put out. A nice deep analogue
bouncer.
 I'd tell you to watch out for'em, but they're already here.
 
 Codename John- The Warning- Metalheadz
 
 Couldn't even begin to explain how incredible this Grooverider track
is.  I don't know if I'll ever drop this on a dancefloor, but this is
the  most interesting, devilish stepper I've heard in ages. Along the
same lines as the R.Size and Shadow 100 remix, this track takes you on
a real journey. Deep as Phuck, you have to hear it to beleive it. The
flip  side, Structure of Red, not only has the coolest title I've
heard, but 
 drops you into a dark trancy place only Groove can take you. Big Up
the 
 Godfather.
 
 Elements if Noise- Warning- Bassrush US
 
 Domestic 2-tracker from the Elements. Dark and supah tough!! Both
sides 
 feature trancy synth lines which drop into hard mashing workouts. If
you like your techstep, you can't miss this one.
 
 DJ Die- Reincarnated- Ful Cycle
 
 Smooth remix by Bristol massive resident. More drums than the
original, 
 and a smoth jazz sample to round things out. Not massive, but
definately the shit.
 
 Mix'n Blen #3 Promo
 
 Wikid new squelcher from Kenny Ken's camp. A-side is an energetic >
analogue stepper. B-side is a massive tearout for the jumpers.
 
 Nasty Habits- Shadoboxing relick- 31
 
 Big up the D O C. Takes his classic tune and injects amen fill while 
 tweaking the droney bass line. Wait till halfway through when the
record skips in time...over the top! B-side is a smooth stomper with
punchy bass hits. If you were at Ultra, you heard this one.
 
------------

-peace-

P.L.U.R. everyone.  I am now in LA, on a business trip.  I liked the
103.1fm when I was here last month. But the signal is kinda weak if you're
not near Orange county.

BTW, I have to tell you I really enjoyed the music and the friendly,
peaceful atmosphere at the City Expresso last night (well, if you saw a
tall and nerdy Chinese-looking guy that's me). I think I will start to go
there regularly and maybe meet a bit more friends. I love you all...:-)

cheers,

Ah, my deflowering.  Yes, I remember it well...

Friends and Family, July 1997 [at the ripe, almost old age, of 28].
FUCKING AWESOME!!!!!! I have changed my personal mantra from "I am my
own sysadmin" to "I am a raver".

So, OK.  I knew a few people who were going to be there, and I went with
a new friend and two total strangers, as my G was setting up the party
[which, of course, is how i found out about it in the first place]  What
I got was an amazing environment, complete with kids of all ages, music,
images, black-lights, beanbag chairs, public sex, crrrrrazzy candies
and lots of interesting conversations.

Music and DJs and Wayne [the nicest big-guy I've met in years] aside,
think about it.  This is an "underground", "subversive" culture which
essentially defines itself by screaming "HERE WE ARE" - the
differentiations in uniforms [goa, candy ravers, glitter guys and girls,
ex-deadheads, blah blah blah] were so interesting to me, because they
aren't, uh..., subtle?

I was essentially separated from the small group i went with for the
majority of the evening, my Gool-guy was either dancing or working, and
you know what?  I can't remember having more fun in, like, a really long
time.  It was like going to an amusement park [only you don't have to
use the bathrooms at the scary Karaoke bar at parks].

There aren't many places left where, essentially, anyone who wants  can
gather for the enjoyment of thoughtful, emotional, experiential and [may
my classical musician parents forgive this] *organic* music.  The way
Ethan created and maintained and changed and developed the experience of
his set is what I remember the most.

So there you have it.  Save for the two little girls (maybe 13) so
freaked out on Sid I felt obligated to act as the adult I am for a few
moments, it was a safe, sane, fun, funny, interesting, compelling and
definitely addictive. I got home at 8:00 am, and I woulda stayed longer,
but I'm not as young as I used to be :-)

**regarding Cunanan***
Cunanan's body was identified earlier this morning.  Some f-cked up
someone at some official something seems to think that, if he was HIV+
that would explain why his profile didn't fit that of any other serial
killers.  Nice, eh?

Gotta go deal with Burningman - aw,yeah!  If'n your'e going, check out
our Lewis Carrol Summer Camp - did anyone say 'eat me'? South Side of
the Plya - play flaming croquet - crawl through the rabbit hole, smoke
with the caterpillar on the 5' mushroom....

So, as someone who just heard his first rave music a couple of months
ago, Maybe you can explain - What's a candyraver?  :)

I dont know about sho...he will have to speak for himself

Next beach party...we find  locations about a mile away from the party
and set up some liquid oxygen and a remote control detonator.

when the police come to bust the party...we detonate the diversion
and they see and feel the explosion which is a much higher 
priority than busting a party and they leave to investigate....

we  keep setting them off all night and they will be too busy

Due to popular demand, (Okay like 6 people). Here is the 

The Complete Raver Personality Guide!

So You can have all of it to keep, sleep on, or just delete, hoping I never
write anything again.

Sorry about the formatting, I can't seem to fix it without having to redo 
the whole thing.

Nailvarnish

You just thought nobody was watching you.......but you were wrong.




Come on admit it, you all old folks out there you were once a:

SEPTEMBER CHILD!

How to spot one: All their gear is new. Clean shoes, brand new Adidas 
back pack, perfect parting everytime (Female).

Where to find them: In every big undergrounds, and clubs.

They always appear:     Just after the summer, either they were introduced
to the scene in the holidays or at the beginning their first year in university.

Internet characteristics: Their account has edu behind it.
Their post consists of Lot of "I LovE you all"
"It was so fluffy and PLURry." "I have nEvEr had 
 friEnds like this.   They always capitalisE thEir Es.

Pros:           They are grEat to look at. They givE you candy. They makE
you smilE bEcause you havE lost that innocEncE.


Cons:           They're annoying when you're pissEd off and recEivE an
Email from them, e.g.. "It's all abovE lovE. pEace" In other
words what you say don't count." ThIER posts are hard to rEAd, with the big Es
all over it. 

 They don't know the difference between trance and breakbeat
if it hit them. SO they resort to posts on NNR things.

What they become:       Usually they drop out of the mailing list and you
never hear of them again because the e has worn off. 

They become cynical and complains like the rest of
us, after being  flamed one too many times, and been ripped off and
given crap drugs, and gone to bum parties..

Don't feel bad if this is YOU! Everyone gets their turn.....

                        ___________________________________


After the September Child stage there are many other variations!!

The Old Sckooler: circa 89-92.

How to spot them:       Their clothes have a washout look, the prints of
the T-shirt are faded and have dates that say: 1991. 

Where to find them:     In the background, in the dark, at the ticket booth
and All the anniversary raves celebrations.

Internet characteristic:        They hardly posts (because every thread
they have seen already) but when they do it's to correct 
someone's misinformation.
(See grouch)

Pros:           They answer all your rave related questions. They know the
cultural significance of the fifteen minutes solos. They
remember 15 minutes solos!
They have cool stories to tell, esp ones like, "It used to
be $5 to get in and you get free water." 

Cons:           They complain ALL the time. About how the scene was better,
(See quote above).How the ravers now don't have the have the
same attitude.Sometimes they post you realize your
smallness. They remind you all the time they've been around.

Sometimes they also are......

The happy-43-year-old OLD skooler.

How to spot them:       Their age, pretty obvious really. They dance the
way THEY want, usually having to give them lots of space.

How you find them:      Usually with their spouses, or they're telling you
their spouse tells them to grow up!. In the midst of all
these young people that worship him or
her for his/her longevity. Still dancing when all
the 20 year old have had it.

Pros:   You can't believe they are still at it! 
You want to be like them.

Cons:      If you're not paying attention and get a glance of
them, they make you think of your parents at home,
wondering what you're up to.

                        __________________________________________________



Edition 3: This is no necessarily evolutionary, but you have to reach the
first to get to 2 and 3. Here we have the ultimate raver, the
about-burnout-raver, the born again raver.

THE ULTIMATE RAVER:

How you spot them: The have all the clothes that you want. They have more  
glow sticks, and bike lights on their bodies then even the 
average raver. In the day, they look the same, sans
glow sticks and bike lights.

Where you find them: EVERY rave. Seen dancing anywhere there are strains of
techno, by their car,  down the street, anywhere.

Characteristic:   They are always there. When they wake up the first
thing they do is put hard trance on and play it real loud.

Pros:           Best person to call when you want to go out. They'll always
go with you, and they know where it Is. They give you warning
and directions to secret parties. You can count on them
being there. They lend you lots Of tapes.

Cons:           The can become About-burnout-raver (see below). They don't
understand when you're tired, or don't want to go out.

                Pray they don't live in the apt above you.

                                __________________________________________


The About-burn-out raver.

How you spot them:      They look more ragged than their 12 year old teddy
bear. Their shoes are a non-discript colour of blah.
They haven't washed their hair for a month, in fact
they haven't done that to their bodies or
clothes for a while either.

Where to find them:     Again at every rave. But this time, really really
at every rave.
Including clubs on the weekdays, and cafes that
play techno in the afternoon.
        
Characteristics:        They are always high, coming down or about to come
up. When they laugh it's a full body laugh where
their heads flip backwards, and thier jaws lock. They
know everybody.

How you find them:      In the day, SLEEPing, among a pile of water
bottles, and fliers and  miscellaneous MESS. In fact
they can trace each bottle to the specific
rave they were at. They are tired all the time until they                 
get to one.

Pros:           The are great fun. They always can find you the drugs you
want, and it would be great. Sometimes they give you some free. 

Cons:           They never have any money except to go to raves and for
drugs. Keeps borrowing from you, for  important things such as
food, rent, and cigarettes. 


What happens to them:   Usually a hiatus where they sit in front of the
computer and lives in the rave mailing  lists,
and seems quite bitter about not going out, but
not having the energy or money.Become a
born again raver (see below). 

Worst case scenario:     Rehab, or parents.


                              
_____________________________________________


THE BORN AGAIN RAVER. (Straight edge)

How to spot them: They are walking in a straight line. They
TELL you.

Internet characteristics:       Their posts usually contains some promotion
of raving sober

Characteristics:      They are clean. They leave at 5am. They
always have a bemused look when you see you fall
over, or curled up in the corner, or bowing to the speaker.


Pros:  No more fights about who's driving home. He or she always
does. 

Cons:  You are aware that they will remember things that you don't
or pretend not to. The can laugh at you and there is nothing you
can use as ammunition.

________________________________________________________________________

THE INTERNET RAVER PERSONALITY.


The Grouch:
There are usually a few long term grouches on each mailing
list. But the grouch bug catches everyone at somet ime. Another
characteristic of the grouch bug  is that you have
specific-topic-grouches. Like the commercialization
grouch, the PC grouch, the drugs grouch, the music grouch, 
the I HAVE SAID THIS BEFORE LETS NOT HAVE NRR POSTS grouch. 

Where you find them:    Only found on the internet

How you can spot them: They are telling someone what they wrote
was wrong, stupid, or ignorant. They correct
all misinformation printed in the list, and
then say, "Grrrr look it up on the hyperreal
web page, before you posts, the address is: 
                               
http://hyperreal.org.everything/youneedto/know/andmore"
                                Their posts are over 6000 words each time. 
                                THEY USE A LOT OF CAPITALS TO MAKE THEIR POINT!!

Non internet characteristics:   They are actually quite pleasant, 
                                intelligent human beings that hardly ever
yell.  But somehow change once they sit in
front of the screen and can be anonymous! 

Pros:       If you support the point they are making for that
day, you're happy because you know you don't even need to say
anything, because this person will say it all for
you, in 6000+ words.

Cons:   If you get on the wrong side of the debate, you
know you'll be in it for at least 5 days, always defending yourself,
because the grouch is great at finding hidden text in
your words that you didn't even know exists. It's
really annoying to delete a hundred posts a day                        
because you really don't care about the topic, in fact by then the         
subject line has nothing to do with the content. 

Also known as:  Depending on your point of view on the debate, the grouch
could also be seen as "The person who is right." "The
person who is overreacting." "The Flame monger." or just
plain dumb.


The grouch has a mutual dependency with the peacemaker. 
Neither can exists without the other, like the hippo and that bird that
sits on it's back. Or the screen and the hard drive. 

                ___________________________________________

The Peace Maker

Where you find them:    Again on the internet

How you spot them:      They are silence for a long time during a debate,
and finally their name pops up and inevitably the post
would start of with: "I really want to stay out of this
but............." followed by, "I want to remind
everyone..." Key words founds in the 
posts are: "Respect," " Off-line," "Think," and
"community,"

Pros:           They help end that one post that has been taking up
bandwidth or days. You are even sick of reading the subject heading,
let alone opening the msg. They may save you, if you're the one being
flamed.

Cons: When it's directed at you!
        You have been riled up to the point of no return, and the grouch
bug has caught you. YOU JUST DON't WANT TO STOP! In fact you have been
enjoying, flaming this person, and the Peacemaker will remind you that you
have been behaving like a fool in  public even though you've been
sitting at home.

The evolutionary of a thread.

1) E posts something
2) Grouch descends and tells E what is wrong with it.
3) E becomes upset, and writes something in retaliation.
4) Grouch slams what E said.
5) X times a number of people join in on either end. 
6) Both Grouch and E are trying to defend their points. E has now caught 
the grouch bug. 
7) Nobody actually knows who's writing what. There are too many forwarded 
arrows, little comments.
8) K flames T about something E said.
9) E flames K, T, L and the WHOLE DAMN List.
10) Grouch his/her  camp posts anti E comments,
11) E and his/her camp does the same.  
12) By this time, there are four different threads all regarding the 
same topic.
13) PEACE MAKER COMES IN.
14) Second PEACE maker comes in.
15) People start to shut up, because the weekend is about to arrive and 
there have better things to do.

The DJ

How to spot them:       One shoulder is lower than the other. They have bad
posture from bending over their decks. They always have
an entourage surrounding them. Managers, friends
that needed to get in free,groupies of the male  or
female persuasion. With their gear.

Where to find them:     Behind the decks, or hanging out with other DJs.
They NEVER dance. Behind their decks at home.

Characteristics:        They are either ultra arrogant, or they are really
cool. There is never an in-between.

Pros:  We NEED them. If they're good, they make you
ecstatic. You life depends on them.When they are
starting out, they give you tapes, they play at your
parties all for FREE.

Cons:  When they suck, your life feels like it's over. If
they're your friends you never see them, because they
are either playing, or practicing.They don't go to
the raves unless they're playing at it. you don't go out
with them and when you go to the one they're playing at they are           
surrounded.

 Drug Dealer


Where you find them:    Near the doors at the parties, in parking lots. Or 
quietly by themselves looking around for people. 

How to spot them:   The usually yell something subtle like"EEEEEEEE"
 Or the grab you and say, "I like
your jacket. Do you want some E?" Usually
appears standing alone and sober.
        
Cons:           When you're already high, they keep asking you, "Are you
sure? I can give you five and take $2 off."  because you might be so
fucked up you buy it anyway. If they're your friend you never
know if you want to give them a ride of not, due to the possession laws.
        

Pros:           Well it's quite obvious really.

Worse case scenario:    Bum drugs, i.e. it's a pain killer, or has heroin
or PCP.

Complaint:      I remember the days when you could talk down the price of a
pill to $15,if you said something like, "Come on my boyfriend
use to sell this stuff, I know the mark up. Just because
you're in the know. Now so many people take it they laugh in your
face.

                ___________________________________________________


The groupie, or hanger on.


Where you find them: Around somebody important. Either it be a DJ, a
promoter, and club kid, a drug dealer. Hanging out with the other people
that put on the rave, but isn't actually doing anything. 

How you spot them. The lone person, or two in a group of people with
laminates.

Characteristics:        They try to get into things free. They walk to the
front of the queue, and ask for somebody to the
security guard. They won't talk to you unless you know
someone or is someone. If they do talk to you,they name
drop. You gets extra points for reconising the name, and                  
even more points for saying you know the person. 

Sample monologue:       "Well so I was there in this cafe, and I was having
Sunday lunch with the promoters, yeah, and then Carl Cox
comes over and sits down. Man that was da bomb. You
know him? Good, he is da shits. Funny thing was
there was this guy from Moon shine records, you know,
trying to sigh my friend onto the label. You  know
Moonshine right?"

Pros:   They introduce you to the people you might actually care to meet. 

Cons:   That is if you're cool enough in the first place to deserve to be
spoken to.

                __________________________________________________

The Candy Raver (north cal), Club kid (Socal)  Geographically different
terminology.

Where you spot them: Everywhere in the scene.

How to spot them: You can't really miss them can you? In the 7 inch foam
platforms.Incredible makeup, wigs, fluffy flurry
jackets, lots of lights and glow things hanging of
them.  Glam Glam Glam. Not in addidas because that's
sporty! Don't forget PLASTIC, is the word. They are wearing
clothes and holding things that are great when you're feeling tactile.

What they are not:      Drag queens! They are fantastic creatures of the
night that have no gender indentity.

Pros:   They are so fun to look at! Some of them, have the most interesting
lifes. Go talk to       Trixie who spent some months meditating in a budist
temple in Asia. If you are one, you get in free to events. Sometimes
you get paid to go to them. 

Cons:   When you're their friend, it's hard to get to talk to them, because
everyone else is trying to do the same. They are so visible that
everyone comes by to say "hello."

How they start out:     That sticker thing! The glitter, the sesame street,
soft toys bak packs, teddy bears,  PACIFYERS. 




The Scenester.


Where you spot them:    The occasional large raves, but usually in the
smaller parties or clubs, where no one
goes, especially the early weekday ones. 
Invite only parties with industry suit types (they're                     
sooo hip, they transcend the label of sell out (ahem). Their               
own private parties with  all other scenesters buddies. They               
are always   at raves that have no fliers.

How to spot them: The NEVER wear raver fashion, except the
sunglasses, and  Mondorama   long sleeves
black shirts with the bold colour print 
(orange, lime green,) some trendy trainers.


Occupation:                     Industry types, (but not top five record
companies) They work for MGM, Sony, some
artsy TV film thang or have their own record
labels or  specialty Techno shops. They                                
manage DJs, groups, or are graphic artists, that off course as             
a hobby design fliers. Some are promoters and DJs. 

Characteristics:        They hate ravers. Especially September Children.
Complain about the fashion, and cringe when they see
people on E who runs around raves holding hands. They
are never seen with a whistle. They go to big events
and then talk about how much they prefer the smaller                   
more "intimate" ones.  

Pros:           If you hang out with them enough, you get to be included in
the oh-so-exclusive-scenester crowd. You get to go to invite
only parties. You get free stuff.

Cons:           They never know what to do with their friends who continue
to be unashamedly     "RAVER." (Damn it I like my
pigtails, stickers, glitter AND I like the big events. :P
Suck my left nipple!! Baby!) They hate the people that
support them. Ungrateful bastards.


The GURU spiritualist

Where to find them:     All outdoor raves. In the desert, in the mountains.
The Full moon parties. 

How to spot one:        They look hippyish, but not quite. Real postmodern.
The hard core ones are doing tai chi at sunrise. 

Characteristics:        Herbal drugs! They love that stuff, not to confused
with the stuff on the market like herbal E. They are into
things I can't spell,bought in health food stores.. 
They talk about the energy, and focus, and stuff
like that. They try to find the Goddess somewhere in
the rave. At sunrise, or beach parties, the younger ones yell out          
exaltations, "Sun oh, sun! You have arrived!" or "The sea, I love          
you."

Pros:           They tell you what to eat and what herbal stuff is going to
help your high. If you're into it, you can go off in the search and swap
tips with each other. 

Cons:           Some people are just atheist, non-spiritual beings that are
there to have fun. On Sunday mornings, when they preach, you
wish you had a door to slam in their faces.

                __________________________________________________________

Fashion raver. (The most despicable off the lot.)


Unfortunately will be appearing more and more.

How to spot them:       You just know. They wear glitter, and hello kitty
back packs.Baggy jeans, Vans. The block print shirts.
In the DAY. They are so put together, you know they
haven't been dancing.

Where to find them:     In the mall. In your classroom. In the bank.
Wandering around somewhere. But NEVER NEVER NEVER at
any event.


Pros:   There are none.

Cons:           They are only wearing the stuff because they saw someone
else in them. They read a magazine, and it said that was
cool.They have no idea why you said "hello." They don't know what
the fuck you are talking about when you ask then where they
went on Saturday. They make you think you could actually
talk to them. 

Sample conversation: 

Raver: Hi
Fashion raver: err.
Raver: Where did you go this Saturday?
FR: Yeah, I went to a raving phat party, there were loads of people
scamming and three kegs.
R: ????
FR: We were hard core!
R: Uhuh, so em who's your favorite DJ?
FR: Howard Stern, and em  Adam Carolla on Love Line. I like Dr. Dru but he's 
not really a DJ.
 R: So you don't listen to techno do you?
FR: huh? That repetitive shit. It's so boring.

Among other bands, i hear the Orb, Prodigy, and Atari Teenage Riot are
playing. Yipes. Electronica <mumble>....

Anybody have the full lineup??

Have I woken up on a different planet? What's going to happen to all
the W.T. "rock n' roll" lovers? Will they shrivel up and die? Retreat
back to their trailerparks and/or Santa Cruz :-)...  Will they finally
stop saying "disco is for fags?" .... Enquiring minds want to know.

*kinda long.... *
        Ok... This is just my opinion... I've had to deal with a picky
Happy Hardcore dj, so that's biased my opinions a little ;) . Anyway.. the
HH on this cd tends to be a little cheesy.  Isn't it put out on Sm:)e or
Moonshine?  I tend to find that they like to put out a lot of cheesy songs
sometimes.  Not *all* the time, but sometimes on their big ol mass-produced
cd collections.  Anyway, the HH on this cd tends to be 4-beat style and has
a lot of diva and piano breakdowns.  Not totally the best HH has to offer
but a good sampling of it. I think Anabolic Frolic mixed this one?  Dj's
usually dont have any say on what tracks they mix when the cd is put out by
a big label.


>The second type I heard was a import CD compilation I just bought called the

>

        When's the copyright year on this one?  Jungle and HH are cousins
of one another and the whole reasons Jungle came into being was the fact
that a lot of people were getting mad over the Cheesy 'Rave' music that was
being played back in 1992 or 1993??  That may be why it started sounding
darker, and it was getting away from the Children's song sounding tunes.  I
guess people got mad after everyone jumped on the bandwagon of children's
tunes and they just got plain repetitive and they were everywhere in the
scene back in the UK.  Anyway, HH can have a breakbeaty sound to it, and
songs that verge on the sounds of HH and Jungle.. or breakbeat as I guess
they called it back then, formed around that time.  I'm not really telling
you a good story right now cuz I just woke up from a nap.
        If you go to www.breaks.com  I think they have a history of jungle
on there and it talks about the 1992-93 era.. and tells you what songs and
artists and dj's were playin around that time.  It's a really good article.
I wrote a report on the history of Jungle music for a paper this past
semester and I found a lot of helpful facts out there on the net.  Check it
out... :)
        As for a good HH tape, I can tell you... go to
http://happy.hardcorps.org   and get a copy of Noahphex's new tape.  or
wait until I get back home and I can dub you a copy of his old tape... '
Sunny Days' by Muppetfucker.  Anyone that hates HH usually loves this tape.
Mixed well.  Enough promotion of my friends.. I'll go back to sleep!
Love Toy :)

No, wearing stickers and generally being a jolly happy soul doesn't make
one a candy raver... you're not full blown till you start attacking people
spun out of thier minds with stickers and candy necklaces and wanting to
take pictures...

;)

AndyW

p.s.	I actually got a little sad taking the stickers off...

It's so fun to convert my poor office mate from Costa Rica into a full
fledged technohed.  He's going on about the changes in JB3's Believer
right now.  Ahhh... the joy of corruption.  :)

the Orb and maybe Atari Teenage Riot are playing, but prodigy is not.
Prodigy and i think the Chemical Brothers are only playing the eastern
half of the tour. others playing at lolla.... are tool, korn,
snoop......and alot of other people i've really heard of. you might want
to check the sunday pink pages on the back of the front page where they
advertise all those mass consert types for a full listing.

Saturday's listings go on forever...  With the good weather, there's more
outdoor events and camping events 'round now too.  A free party in the park
on Saturday is too good to resist (unless you're up in Shasta for the
Gaiamind party), then the On The One party, Abstract Science, and Pro-Soy
all caught my eye.  Crash Worship is certainly a unique experience if
you haven't seen them yet.  Catch either on Saturday in Oakland or Sunday
at the Trocadero...

Niels,

Not all rock 'n' roll lovers live in trailerparks and/or Santa Cruz.
This sort of comment smacks of prejudice to me.  Some people
might take offense to it...remember the "white trash" thread many
moons ago?  It ain't cool, man.

Peace y'all,
Eric

Found some info -- Local Lineup doesn't include Prodigy (yay!) or
Atari Teenage Riot (waaa!). I'd have loved to see people's faces
and reactions to their music. Not even sure if I can take their
noize, but it's interesting nonetheless.

aug 15 fri The Orb, Tool, Snoop Doggy Dogg, Tricky, Korn, James,
       Julian & Damian Marley And The Uprising Band,
       Second Stage:  Failure, Pugs, Lost Boyz, Demolition Doll Rods,
       Skeleton Key, Orbit at Lollapalooza '97
       at Concord Pavilion, Concord a/a noon/2pm * #

who is "Orbit" -- i wish that was a typo for "William Orbit" or "Orbital"
but it's probably not...

So I've been raving for a little over a year now so you can take this 
message for what ever it's worth *8^)


In general, a Candy Raver could be described as one who dresses, and acts 
the part of a stereotypical raver at all the parties they go to. They 
wear bright flourescent and neon colors, baggy pants, tons of glow in the 
dark stuff, glitter, etc., and then the one thing that they get thier 
name from...they have tons of candy either in thier possesion or dangling 
from thier clothing somehow. They act in a very energetic, happy 
manner...always smiling, and running around trying to meet people in a 
flash, giving them candy and then taking right off again. They have a 
good intent of trying to keep the vibe of the party as positive as it 
could possibly be, but can be occasionaly annoying when you're having a 
bad time or just simply not feeling as happy as they are :P 

Now, when somebody mentions "candyraver," in thier sentence, they might 
not always be refering to exactly this defintion. Occasionally, 
"candyraver," might be used as a more negative term when someone is 
trying to refer to some younger-teen newbie who is most likely trying to 
fit in at his/her first rave but instead just ends up ruining everyone 
elses time as they overdose on GHB ;) ( it was an example...no flames 
please :P ) 

			OR...

As in Beth's (and my) case, you could say we're like candy-ravers, but 
you would be using the term more losely,. We have been raving for a 
while (therefore might be a little more at ease to go around and meet 
people at raves,) and we also enjoy dressing up for raves!, but you 
couldn't really call us by definition "Candyravers." And the only way to 
truely understand that is to go out and experience some Candyravers first 
hand, and then come and talk to us...

You'll notice the difference...granted it's not a big one :), but you 
will notice the difference.


Hope that helped

Stay Coool!

Well, I would just like to thank all of you guys who were sending me the
good vibes today.  I swear to god (or that there of), I could just feel
the vibes flowing from all around.  I did pretty good on my tests. (knock
on wood)  My big three hour long interview went very well.  In fact, it
seemed like one of the interviewers (a guy at that) who was giving me a
tour was hitting on me (too bad I'm not gay).  So anyways, the job is
practically mine since there were me and someone else be interviewed for
two jobs.  Another cool thing about this place is that it's right down
the road from the Berkeley Marina.  So if ever there's a Sunset, I can
just cruise on by.

Then I did my presentation in front of class pretty good.  I'm going to
assume I got a high B or low A.  Whatever's clever, I'm not a real big
art fan.

So I would just like to thank all of you because without you it wouldn't
happen.

Oh Yeah!!!  If you're going to True Love, stop by the waterfall/fruit
table sometime between 1 and 2:30 because I'll be chillin there workin'
the table.

Bye
Bye

It's too quiet in here.  Somebody say something!  Helllooooooo!  Where
is everybody?  I'm here.  It's Julie Mae and I'm waving to all of you
and jumping up and down because I'm happy as a butterfly.  (I know what
you are thinking, and I am not a candy-raver!)  For all of you who are
wondering why I'm a bit too much on the cheery side for a Thursday
night, let me just tell you...  I got my car back yesterday (haven't had
it since June 10th)... $3400 and a new engine later, I finally get to
come back out to the Bay Area and party!  Let me see, I've been to one
party since April... so by now, you'd be safe to assume I'm going
through withdrawals for all of you.  Oh, and I finished my summer
session college courses today!  Yay!  Three weeks off!  (Seeing as how I
had finals tonight and haven't slept since Tuesday night because I
pulled an all-nighter studying last night, I'd say part of this
cheeriness is resulting from the sleep-deprived delirium that set in a
few hours ago...)  Oh, and of course, we cannot forget that True Love is
this Saturday, and wouldn't you know it?  I'm going to be there!!!  More
on that tomorrow... Oh yeah, and did I mention that it is too quiet in
here?
                                   Smiling brightly,
                                                   Julie Mae

Oh, and yet another dose of the beautiful word:
"Knowing others is intelligence;
 knowing yourself is true wisdom.
 Mastering others is strength;
 mastering yourself is true power."
            ~ Lao-Tzu

I think it might be everyone prepairing themselves for the insanity of this
weekend (Free parties on Friday night and Saturday day @ golden gate, as
well as the MILLIONS of parties Saturday night).

 Well, I love summer now that I have my car and can take advantage of
it...  I tell you, being stuck 2 hours from civilization for 2 months in
100-105 degree heat without a car to escape with can really make summer
a drag.  But now my summer can commence!  Let the fun begin!  Oh yeah,
and I'll be celebrating my birthday at True Love.  I know it's like 2
weeks late, but hey, I was stuck here for my birthday, so the
celebration is much needed!
                                     Still Smiling,
                                             Julie Mae

Hmmmm...

I thought that White Trash was people like.... Nevermind.


This is not really funny. Doesn't make much sence, kind of like me I guess.
I mean.. I always thought Santa Cruz was full of tired hippies and cool
buff tan guys with no talent. And trailer parks? Isn't that where old folks
live? And isn't it actually the ravErs that are more homophobic than the
Van Halen freaks? And "enquiring mind(s)" Don't you mean YOU want to know?

want. if you wanna dress up soopanice go for it! i'm um doin the whole 
maid of honor thang so i'm gonna be wearing a dress for the first time in 
like, a year. it's hard to imagine me in a dress, isn't it?
anyhoo! i think it'd be neet if you all just be yourselves and wear 
whatever you want and
bring the truest vibes of them all.

The beer is good, the people are good, and you can listen to some good old
fashioned bumpin' & thumpin' HOUSE music played by no other than DJ Loren
the maestro!

Partay starts @ 10:00 p.m.

hi 
ben and iris (jarmin@rocketmail.com) here on ed's email account

we haven't heard anything like what us brits would call current happy
hardcore around here. everything that we've come across here under the
label happy hardcore is at least 3 years old, sometimes going back to
when jungle and happy hardcore hadn't split into different types of music
and scenes yet. that's why old hardcore has some jungle beats in it. even
some of the stuff labeled 97 is old. people here aren't into the fast
stuff.
at freedom they were playing a tune that sounded familiar but not quite
right to us and then we realized that they were actually playing it at
the wrong speed (33 instead of 45).
happy hardcore has a 4/4/ beat and a lot of happy uplifting melodies and
lyrics (sometimes at chipmunk speed), 160-190 bpm, the old stuff may be
as slow as 140 bpm.
give us your address and we'll send you a tape or come to true love, find
us, and we'll give you one there (although we've only got the really hard
stuff left now)
or, even better, come to england and we'll take you to a rave, new years
eve maybe? some other people from sf might be coming. (this invitation is
open to all sfravers)
we'll be taking trance home w/ us.

Hello Magz...

Well I'd like to think of this event as a party as well as a wedding.
Dress as you wish is my take.  I'd hate for you to discomfort YRself on
accounts to "fit in" (geez, it almost sounds like catholic school).

as i was driving the usual meditative drive to work this morning i found
myself suffering from a new kind of DTs, the DTs that shake you when your
booty has been rockin to the same DnB grooves for the past several
months....and something must be done about this.

basically, to make a long story short, in the past 6 months i have become
mildly addicted to the drum and the bass that makes the peach fuzz on my
arms and the back of my neck get perpendicular.  and i have been listening
to the same 2 mix tapes of absolutely brilliantly dark twisted and evil
DnB.  they are terrific tapes (*plug* mixed by none other than superstar
djs science and re ach *plug*), but i am yearning for some new sounds, and
what better place to turn to than the "underground."  with all of you djs
out there, i was hoping that one of you or maybe even 2 or 3 would stoke me
on a new DnB mixtape.....

i shall erect an altar in your name(s) and forever worship you.  and maybe
even invite you to make a guest appearance on my radio show ;>

thanks in advance.

love,
lola

Hey guys, I just wanted to update on the results of sending me the good
vibes.  Well, I've got the job.  I can only hope there won't be a drug
test. (but that's a different story).  So it pays 9 bucks an hour and all
I have to do is spend about 4 hours of the 9 I get paid for to water the
plants that are part of a scientific experiment.  The other five hours I
get paid to do whatever I want.

Also my presentation went good and every student I talked to said they
liked it.

So thank you very much everyone who donated their good vibes.

Gosh, where would I be without you guys.

  Well... I am a candy raver.  And I do not take it as an insult.  Does this
go along with those *raver personality quizes* (is this you?) that went
around a while ago.  Are candy ravers really just all September children?
 I've been wondering lately if you could still classify the people in the
baggy pants and addidas candy ravers because their hair is slicked with
glitter gel and they are wearing a pacifier.  And I also had a conversation
with my friend and our non-rave going friend the other day.  He was asking us
about the attire and such and I realized the girls are the ones that have a
greater tendency to dress in the glittery clothes.  I just enjoy it.  If I
dressed like that everyday (aside from being a megga-phreak [which actually
wouldn't be that bad])  it would make going to raves less of a special event.
 Getting decked out and putting thought into my outfits is part of the
excitement.  It adds to the theme.  You don't have to dress that way and have
your parents wondering where they went wrong.  Just for me, the giving candy
and stickers is part of it all and if I piss people off because I"m always
happy, I'm sorry, but that's just the way I am.  Just a candyravers 2
blowpops....

       hugs n'Stuff,

 The rythym has control.
 The rythym is inside me.
 The rythym has my soul."

P.S.  I will see you all at true love and I will be wearing my care bear
overalls, bubble necklace, laminates pacifier, chokers, glitter bracelets,
toys and enough candy and glitter to supply the rave community for a week.
 Say hi.. I don't bite.

The ceremony will start at 1:30, map point will close NO LATER THAN 1:00 
and there ARE limited tix (about 400). SO be good and show up ok? 
Leave any bad attitudes and bullshit at HOME. Save the drama for 
anothernight.
I'll kick you out if you fuck shit up. :) And I mean this nicely.
	Well I LOVE AMANDA and this night is really important for her, 
and well I'd just have to be REALLY REALLY UN-PLURRY if anyone tainted 
the night.
	This night isn't just about Amanda and Dustin, well it mostly IS 
BUT! Let's extend the TRUE LOVE from them and let it shine for all of US 
as well. Let's celebrate love, life. Let's show each other how much we

Hi, my friend is making som music with a keyboard and he wanted me to ask you guys 
these two questions because hes not on the list. Ok here goes:

1. What is the best digital audio manipulating software available?
2. Are there any software products out there that can change the pitch 
of a wave file without altering the playing time?


Email me back and I'll forward it to him.


Hugs, Diego

P.S. see you all at true love!! :)

When I first got down to San Diego in 1991, I soon found this wikid
zine called URB. It was hella big and came out on newspaper print. It
detailed pretty much everything that was goin on in S.Cal and was way
on top of things. Over the years, it went through many changes;
getting a glossy cover, featuring more and more mainstram-type
artists. Less personal focus on the scene which fostered its growth. 

Now I rarely ever read it. Although some of the articles are good,
it's just not the kind of vital info I'm looking for. The reviews are
cool, but usually about 2 months dated by the time the magazine
actually arrives in newstands.

Anyways, this week I needed some lunch-reading last week so I picked
up issue 54. Now it does have a pretty cool article on Kool Keith, and
a blurb on Single Cell Orchestra and Jason Mouse, but overall, I was
pretty dissapointed. The last straw came when I flipped through the
reviews and saw 2 records (central fire and dee patton) being reviewed
that were 3 or 4 years old! The reviewer (initials TCR which I assume
is Todd C Roberts the exec. editor) talks about them like they are
new, which I find really disconcerting, considering how long he's been
in the scene.

It made me laugh at myself for spending my money on it.

At least we have XLR8R which manages to do a pretty good job reporting
on an ever-increasing commercial scene with an underground edge.

-peace-

What the hell was that all about? What the hell is a groover? Are we
considered groovers? I'm confused!!!! Just another reason I dislike LA soo
much.... It sounded interesting at first, but quickly turned into one of
those Raider's of the Lost Ark last scene things, where the angels turn into
demons! Did that make sense? Anyway, I'm lost....

>1. What is the best digital audio manipulating software available?

Dont mean to be Bias or anything, But Digidesigns ProTools in the best, IMHO.  Curretnly, its only on the Mac, so if you're buddy has a PC, I'd go for Cubase VST or Emagic Logic.  Both are Sequencers but have increadable audio editing features.

>2. Are there any software products out there that can change the pitch 
>of a wave file without altering the playing time?

Most Sample Editors will do this.

Hey- 

I'm at work with this bizarre migrane headache and noone here's got
any ibuprofine for me:(

Does anyone know any new-age type deals (like pressure-points) which
could help me out??

-in pain but in a good mood-

I share your views completly on the state of URB Mag.

The Central Fire record was just Recently Re-released.  Thats probablly why it is being re-reviewed in URB.

Yup, but check this out..the review states,"Word is that this is a
repressing from a few years ago, or it's a first pressing on a 12 that
never saw the light of day."

C'moooon. This 12" was soooo huge when it came out...everyone played
it.

anyways, no big deal, just humorous.

there is a pressure point between your thumb and forefinger, like a
tendon or something.   pressing on it is supposed to cure your headaache.
  i think the pain of pressing there distracts you from the pain but i'm
sure someone else has a much better explanation for how it works.
good luck

How funny. This is actually the second time that's happened. Last time they
reviewed it, he/she was comparing it to all these tracks that came out
afterwards, talkin like Courtney (of Central Fire) was copying all those tracks.

i wouldn't recommend protools - on either platform.  with that kind of 
sticker price, you could buy a good sampler, a dat, and a 
slidermaster...  if you need the digital editing, buy a scsi connector 
and hook up your k2k (which you can afford by not purchasing protools) to 
your computer.

avoid cubase for pc's - it's a great idea, but my experience has been 
that the damn thing crashes every 5 minutes.  it looked great on the mac 
though - i'd prolly buy it over protools on the mac...  from the little 
i've seen of emagic, it seemed like something by engineers, for 
engineers - slightly clinical...

I heard that by pressing the pressure points (yea it hurts) you release
endorphins which are your body's natural painkillers.

you might want to try lots of chammomile tea or something too.  It's
supposed to be relaxing, and it helps me a little.

ooops... guess i should read the email addresses before replying...  
i don't mean to totally rail on protools, mark - it _is_ good at what it 
does - i just don't feel that the price tag is warranted.  and i'm 
interested in seeing what happens to digidesign when the wave of 
recording systems floods the market - is digidesign finally gonna drop 
their prices to compete?

also, it depends on whatcha wanna do - personally, i'm much more into the 
live/jam session feeling when i'm making music, and i feel that most 
sequencers have pitiful support in this area.  i'd rather lessen my 
production quality a little and gain some more realtime freedom and 
interaction.  for me, music is as much process as product, yet most 
software designers seem only concerned in the bottom line - the "what 
happens when i hit play" mentality of work-followed-by-reward.  why not 
be more concerned with what happens _while_ playing - of reward within 
work?  there's no reason to _not_ have instant (and increasing) 
gratification through music!

music as process is where its at... feedback loops, where there is no 
audience because everyone present affects the outcome.  not some 
orchestrated concert or album or static snapshot, but a continually evolving 
living experience.

Age is in the mind.  In my mind, I am almost always old - I'll let you
know when I get there officially - probably the moment before I die ;)

alas, no.  The party is at a warehouse in Oakland, no presale tix.
Here's some basic info, including numbers, line-up and survival options.

It should be monumentally interesting to see the marriage of ravers and
burningpeople [since there won't be a rave at the burningman festival
this year :(]

***CW Virgin Notes****
 CRASH SURVIVAL GUIDE!!!!!!

     a) bring minimal clothes that you don't care about wearing ever
again
     (cw is not usually a place where i care about my fashion
statements,
     naked is better, though there can be some flying sparks...)

     b) tribal paint or body glitter are nice

     c) bring water (to rinse yourself off with) and a complete change
of
     clothes in yoiur car

     d) no open toed shoes. yoiur feet will get stomped (even though i
     have noted that the crowd is usually supportive if yoiu fall over
or
     get pushed, there are always a couple troublemakers)

     e) earplugs are a good idea, and tie up your hair (it will be
soaked)

     f) remember, these notes are from a vetran, but just like burning
     man, i cannot guarantee anything will or will not happen (including

     orgy-like piles near the front of the stage.......)

     g) leave any sexual inhibitions at home. ;)

     * if you are seeing cw for the first time, i reccomend that even if

     you use drugs(or alcohol), you dont. reasons:

     1)it is very hot and dangerous, and unless you are over 6 foot 3,
it
     is so sweaty and cramped in the front, you will barely be able to
     breathe (even when sober)/ when you are on hallucionegens, you
won't
     be able to tell if you are being burned by flying sparks, or if it
     could be really harmful to you later.....

     2) it is almost impossible to carry a water bottle, and the wine
that
     is usually passed around will only dehydrate you.

     3) it's really cool to see what the show can be like sober...trust
me,
     it's an awseome "buzz" in itself.


general info:
Okay, I'm breaking my temporary vow of silence for a minute to try to
clarify  something.

Crash Worship (tribal party band from San Diego, blah blah y'all know
already) is playing *two* nights in the Bay Area at the end of the
month.

by
Rebecca)
9pm - 6am, $15

Call for info:
415-263-4818
408-535-0404
510-287-8874

Sun., July 27 -- Trocadero, 520 4th St. @ Bryant, SF
Doors at 8pm, $10
Crash Worship and Duarte 6

their
wigs and muumuus. . .

hello all,

for the last month I've been planning on attending the pro-soy party this 
saturday as the party to celebrate my moving to a new apartment but now 
that I've realized, how this escaped my attention I don't know, the 
satori party is the same night I don't know what to do.  Seeing as how 
crash worship is such an experience and how I missed it last year at the 
troc. becuase I got really hungry and almost passed out before they came 
on stage I think I owe it to myself to see them now.  But my fave dj is 
playing at the pro-soy party.  Any suggestion out there in my dilema? and 
no I can't go to both.

later,
Megan        czefir

well since you're going to regret it either way... make-up a new reason
to go to a party... like say..... if there was a wedding taking place at
a party... and it's a once in a rave-time experience.... you should
definately go there =)

solution: don't go to pro-soy, don't go to satori, go to true love. =)

This is totally incorrect. It should read like so:

Candy Raver: North Cal & So-Cal

Where you spot them:      Everywhere in the scene. Usually its at
underground in the SF Scene and they are everywhere in So-Cal.

How to spot them:      You can't really miss them can you? In the
colorfully furry pants, or one of the million of bell bottoms with
triangle inserts of so cartoon character fromt he 80's (ie: care bears,
rainbow bright, popples, smurfs, scoobie doo, yoggie, sesame
street),incredible ammounts of gilitter and stickerss,puffy vests, lots
of florescnet necklaces and braclets and a huge wallet chain made of
some kid stuff (blocks, bears, toys) hanging of them.  Hugs Hugs Hugs.
Not in addidas because that's sporty (unless they have furry triangle
inserts).Never tight plastic pants! They are wearing
clothes and holding things that are great when you're feeling tactile.

What they are not:      CLUB KIDS!!! They are fantastic creatures of
the night that have a slight gender indentity that can only be
understood if you are one or know the person.

Pros:   They are so fun to look at! Some of them, have the most 
interesting lifes. Go talk to Trixie who spent some months meditating in
a budist temple in Asia. If you are one, you get in free to events.
Sometimes you get paid to go to them. They have already met everyone at
the rave in a matter of seconds.

Cons:   When you're their friend, it's hard to get to talk to them,
because everyone else is trying to do the same. They are so visible that
everyone comes by to say "hello." They are constantly persecuted by the
Hardcore Kids in the So-Cal scene. They are broked cuz they always spend
their money on clothes, jewelery, or toys.

How they start out:     All it takes is one sticker then its all down
hill from then.

___________________________________________

Club Kid:

Where you spot them:   Everywhere in the scene.

How to spot them: You can't really miss them can you? In the 7 inch foam
platforms. Incredible makeup, faux eyelashes that are a mile long, wigs,
feather boas, tight plastic or lycra pants. Glam Glam Glam. Don't forget
PLASTIC, is the word.

What they are not:      CANDY RAVERS!!! They are fantastic creatures of
the night that have no gender whatso ever.

Pros:   They are so fun to look at! Some of them, have the most 
interesting lifes. Go talk to Trixie who spent some months meditating in
a budist temple in Asia. If you are one, you get in free to events.
Sometimes you get paid to go to them. They can spot anyone in a mile
radius since they are the tallest person there.

Cons:   When you're their friend, it's hard to get to talk to them,
because everyone else is trying to do the same. They are so visible that
everyone comes by to say "hello." Some of them (not all are so into what
they look like to even pay attention to you.

How they start out:     All it takes is 2 inches of foam on your shoe
and its all down hill from then.

I never really thought of myself a candy raver until people had been
refering to me as one. I was just dressing up to have fun. It is fun to
dress up. But I think its more than dressing up. Its the type of
attitude you have, because if you think your better than everyon else
just because your dressed up colorfully, that is th wrong attitude for
candy ravers. It not about competition, its about bringing in a positive
vibe with the way you are dressed and your pos. attitude of thinking
yoursefl to be on an equal level with all those not dressed as
colorfully. Just because you wear a lot of necklaces doesn't make you a
candy anything. it just makes you a happy raver. And there nothing wrong
with being that at all.

Love,
Paul

To add to the Candy Raver Definition...
This is my personal opinion, if you do not wear the same style of
clothes you wear to raves out of raves (work exeption) you are only half
a candy raver. That's just my opinion. But glitter and stickers every
day can get annoying.

  Hey everyone, I haven't posted in so long that today I thought I'd wear out
my limit.  What is it again?  Five posts? Three?  anyways, I figure True Love
is going to be a big SFR fest and I wanna meet you all!  Yay (this would be
the candy raver/ september child aspect of my personality) I Love you and you
are all such beautiful people!  Look for my overalls n'stuff.
Ok.. and on the personality note... I was thinking about the *trendy raver*
and how I so dislike anyone who tries to be something they are not.  With
this contempt in mind I was sifting through trend city (a.k.a. the mall)
 Disgusted with some of the people and clothes hanging about (although I did
find this cool $5 sequin top) I left.  So back at my friend's house I find a
Delia's catalog on her kitchen table.  Whatever.. I'll look through it.  They
not only have their fall line of artificial snowboard wear.  (c'mon, I know
some of you know what I"m talking about.. it's a five-letter word, starts
with pose?) But they also have some chicks modeling baggy jeans with a *SPIN*
hooded sweatshirt and all sorts of shoulder bags.  Then come the girls with
the Japanamation shirts and the Keropi back-packs and I"m thinking.. this is
so the *trendy-never-been-to-a-rave-but-look-like-I-have* person.  That's
about the time I got really disgusted and went home.  ANyways.. that is my
dissapointment for the day.. but I know going to true love tomorrow will make
me happy and I will get to see all you true ravers who love techno.  Whew..
that was a long bunch of bullshit.  see you all soon!

            hugs n'stuff,
              'trice the tekno diva                <<<<RAVEON>>>>

I'm considering said purchase.  Does anyone have any experience with this
machine vs. other samplers?

I already have a sequencer (MasterTracks Pro 6.0) for the Mac and wonder if
the extra cost for the on-board sequencer is worth it if not merely for
ease of use.  I'm looking for something versatile enough for both intensive
editing during recording and on-the-fly editing during live performances.

cheers,

in your mind you're almost always old??? i hope you mean the opposite! so,
anyone want to form a peter pan club? there was one in austin of ravers who
had reached the benchmark of 30.... i had just made it in before i moved
out here! but we could make it 28.... anyway, i will never forget a dance
instructor i had once who was in her mid-40's - you'd never know it. age
really is in the mind. i look at my father a lot and think that he's the
epitome of a kid in a 60 year old body. years have nothing to do with it.
yes, you grow wiser, but that should add, imo, to your youthful
experiences! hey, you know how to handle them now!

cheers - e. :)

'trice & others,

Don't be too harsh on the
*trendy-never-been-to-a-rave-but-look-like-I-have* folks.

There is an eliminate of poser in us all.

I remember my supreme indignation just last year when Macy's windows
downtown were FULL of raver fashion.  Macy's CAN NOT KNOW WHAT IT IS TO
BE A RAVER!  

At that same time there was a HEATED debate about how great it would be
when rave culture became mainstream, (we should promote it so that every
dancehall in America was a rave,) and what a beautiful world it would be
vs. shhh!: lets keep it our secret underground 'thang.

I really like the underground thing, but I am also grateful to be able
to walk amongst my community of "straights" and not be sneered at
because of my "ravish" wardrobe.

My closet is already too full of my sex kitten (poser!)outfits, jammed
right next to my (poser) business suits, and squished between that is my
(poser)sailing gear plastered with major labels, my (poser)mommy togs
and ballet wear.  (boy, talk about a poser, that's me in ballet class!)

I have a special place for my too-expensive-but-good-poser-wear-Oakly
shades.  You know the ones that have no warranty on their $140.00 (not
even scratch resistant) lenses?

Go to Pro-soy. The people that run the Troc, and the security are pure
assholes. I know I have missed a few good shows, and regret missing CW,
but I won't go to any show that is held at that poor excuse for a venue.

I think that's pretty inconsiderate and rude of you to say.
I'm djing at Prosoy, and while I won't be attending True Love, I woulndn't
tell anyone that they would regret going.

Using the word regret is a bit strong.

I'm hoping that no one ends up regretting going to True Love, you may have
to eat your words ;)

CW's playing the Troc on Sunday. Satori on Saturday is at the 2nd & Jackson
warehouse in Oakland. Or so I surmise from the ads in the Guardian and
Weekly which say only "Crash Worship - Saturdy July 26th, 2nd & Jackson,
Oakland" with no mention that there's a rave going on around it...

 Okay, you said you couldn't go to both.  Does that mean you can't go to
both on the same night?  Or you can't go out both nights.  Because if
you can't go to both on the same night, but you can go out both Saturday
and Sunday, I'd suggest you go to ProSoy on Saturday and Crash Worship
on Sunday.  The CW tomorrow night is in Oakland for $15 and the one
Sunday night is at the Trocadero for $10.  Now, that will seems like a
better deal to me, although the Saturday night one has free water and I
don't know about the Troc show.  Well, don't mind me if you really meant
that you couldn't go both nights.  If that's the case, I unfortunately
don't have a suggestion, as I'm skipping both on Saturday to go to True
Love, so there is no dilemma for me.  I'll just go to Crash Worship on
Sunday. Good luck deciding, and have lots of fun wherever you go!
                                   Smiling,

here's how i see it:
yeah there are tonsa kids running around full "rave gear" on
but we're the ones that know in our hearts what the scene is about 
and the music is the our passion
the love is our passion
and they're OURS to keep and only WE know about it and appreciate it..
and that's what counts most, right?
so let everyone wear whatever they want, even let kids who don't go to 
parties say "yea i rage" or "raves? never been but i want to"
that's their freedom of speech or whatever.
the fashion isn't exactly all the scene is made up of..
as long as they don't destroy our passions..
it's all good :)
keep the vibe alive and keep it UG eh? ;)

High class!

Todays project involves burning steel, gas/alcohol and flame. 

We are providing this for informational purposes only!

First construct a box of the steel mesh they use for hamster cages. Keep 
that cute little door cause you gotta fill the insides with 000 grade 
steel wool.(Home Depot)

Now connect a steel wire or chain to each of two corners. Sorta like a 
purse strap. Bring the opposite ends together and connect them to a 
steel cable.

Fill the box with 000steel wool. Soak with whatever flammable liquid 
works for you. Soak being the operative term.

light twirl in circles make fire art.

This is extremely dangerous. You will get burned. People nearby will be 
burned. My advice is not to try it.

Hernan...pyro with all 10 fingers and no skin grafts.

'trice & others,

Don't be too harsh on the
*trendy-never-been-to-a-rave-but-look-like-I-have* folks.

There is an element of poser in us all.

I remember my supreme indignation just last year when Macy's windows
downtown were FULL of raver fashion.  Macy's CAN NOT KNOW WHAT IT IS TO
BE A RAVER!  

At that same time there was a HEATED debate about how great it would be
when rave culture became mainstream, (we should promote it so that every
dancehall in America was a rave,) and what a beautiful world it would be
vs. shhh!: lets keep it our secret underground 'thang.

I really like the underground thing, but I am also grateful to be able
to walk amongst my community of "straights" and not be sneered at
because of my "ravish" wardrobe.

My closet is already too full of my sex kitten (poser!)outfits, jammed
right next to my (poser) business suits, and squished between that is my
(poser)sailing gear plastered with major labels, my (poser)mommy togs
and ballet wear.  (boy, talk about a poser, that's me in ballet class!)

I have a special place for my too-expensive-but-good-poser-wear-Oakly
shades.  You know the ones that have no warranty on their $140.00 (not
even scratch resistant) lenses?

Okay... So, are you surprised by this?  Every underground fashion becomes
mainstream and exploited at some point in its career.  And that fashion is
always based on the music of the people.

	*50's R & B
	*60's Freedom Rock
	*70's Disco Inferno
	*80's New Wave & Industrial/Goth

The nighties have probably had more fashion exploitations than all three
previous decades combined.  It's been easy.  There are enough of us
"alternative hipsters" now to break it into a whole bunch of convenient
little categories.  Gangster Rap.  Hip-Hop.  Grunge.  Punk.  Raver.  And
I'm sure that somebody, somewhere is still exploiting the old classic
trends of the past, too.

Ravers have not been around forever and their fashions developed from those
which preceded them.  Ever notice how someone going to a rave and someone
going to a hip-hop show can look an awful lot alike?  Where do you think
those baggy pants came from, anyway?  Personally, I think it's all started
to look very much the same.

But don't stress over this issue too much.  It won't be long before the new
underground trend comes around.  And you can bet that it, too, will
eventually show up at the mall.  You might even learn that the stuff
probably started out at the mall before it made it to the underground.
FILA... ADIDAS... TOMMY HILLFIGER... NIKE ...  The list goes on and on.  A
trend is a trend is a trend.  Why should rave fashion be held any more
sacred than any other trends?

Thanks and I hope everyone has a lovely evening.
Be Safe.

adam! you're giving england a bad name.
you're in london. you've been there for 1 week.  and you
expect to have already found the underground. no chance, mate. you've
got to know people. it's far more underground than it is here. 
and don't talk about clubs, please. how many times have i said that
clubs
in london have NOTHING to do w/ the rave scene!!!!!
the *vibe* will not be the same you're used to anyway, even if you
don't end up in clubs by accident. but the vibe is goooood. you
haven't found the right places yet.
what the f**k did you do w/ all the phonenumbers and email addresses
we gave you?
just hold out until the 5th of august and come to milton keynes, we'll
take you to a rave that weekend.
no, it's not like sf. it is completely different. but you'll figure it
out or we'll explain it to you. you are the one who really got us into
the scene here, into the music. you took us to the right places. we
can't wait to do the same for you mate. 

see you soon. take a weekend trip to amsterdam. see you in less than 2
weeks.

I've met loads of nice people here, and at clubs as well.  But It's
nothing like back home.  In SF, the rave scene and the club scene is
two different worlds.  Different music, different people, differnt cup

working together for what we call PLUR.  This is something that the uk
has seemed to have forgotten about.  For the UK people, plur stands
for Peace, Love, Unity and Respect.  It is a motto that we try to live
by.  When you go to an undergound event in SF, you are always
surrounded by smiles.  You are always welcome. You are accepted.  You
always see people that you know, but you also always meet new
wonderful faces.  Here, It seems that Unity i!

If soneone is going to true love and has access to this kind of equipment, please bring it!

If someone has a laptop computer with a ricochet modem and a quickcam, it would be really neat if 
we got live updates and an archive of pictures for people who couldnt go to true love to see.

Or, if perhaps betalounge want to haul some gear down.... :P

Okay, so this will be my first weekend in the Bay area in too damn
long.  I'm leaving in the morning on my first road trip with the new
engine in my car!  Yay!  So, I think I've put it out there loud and
clear that I will be at TRUE LOVE tomorrow night, and that I'll be
making up for my missed birthday at it!!!  So I want to meet all of you
that I haven't met already.  I don't have my laminate anymore, as I
donated it to a new SFRaver back when I unsubscribed and they
subscribed. Now, wasn't that nice of me?  But now they are gone, and my
laminate is gone, and I'm back on!  Go figure!  So Orson, if you read
this, please put one aside for me!!!  Pretty please!  Okay, but until I
get a new laminate, I'll probably wear my Warmth 2 or Symbiosis
laminate, so you'll still know who I am.  By the way, I'll be wearing
cute little low-slung jean shorts with a blue bare-midriff sleeveless
mock turtleneck and white heeled sandals.  Oh, and I have long wavy
chestnut hair and big blue eyes, the color of which you may not be able
to see because my eyes might be too dilated! Oh, and except for the
heels, I'm quite petite (5'2"). And last but not least, I will probably
be wearing some glowy stars next to my eyes, carrying around a plain
black backpack full of not-so-plain stuff, and I'll be one of the ones
with the ear-to-ear grins all night.  But then again, won't we all...
Someone will need to volunteer to massage my facial cheeks, because they
will be so tight from smiling too much all night... LOL.  Anyway, I hope
to see all your beautiful faces on such a beautiful night!
                                 Smiling,
                                       Julie Mae

Thought for the day:  You are never given a wish without also being
given the power to make it true.

Hey!

Okay, I'm really really really excited 'bout this one kiddies!
:)
I'll be there with my orange national-team-of-Holland futbol jersey and 
my SoCal Raves laminate hanging right next to my SFRaves laminate! :)  
Also, I'll be the weirdo spinning at 4am.

:)

So, when you see me, come up and say Hello, introduce yourself twice 
('cuz I'm sooooo bad with names) and share hugs, smooches, idle chit-chat 
or whatnot :)

See ya then!

   For all the people that can be recognized as "customers" when they go 
to a coffee house for a double vietnamese non fat mexican mocha ,oh and 
extra hot, The facts that go on behind the counter just are not shown to 
you folks.  Why do silly day programs called soap operas take places in 
hospitals and funeral homes when they could just film at a coffee shop?
   The other day I was with a couple of friends, one who likes Days Of 
Our Lives and the other just thinks it is so incredibly dumb now he's 
hooked and during that episode, there was a nun who was trying to 
persuade her twin sister (who is actually the same actress, creative 
huh?) to do the "good religious thing"  The actress has the same part of 
her lip snarled so high up that it almost touches her nose, with both 
characters.  My point with this example of almost dual personalities is 
this: The coffee shops are almost entirely ruled by these dual 
personality peoples, I refer to this sort of person as a Gemini.  I'd 
say 3/5 coffee personel are of the Gemini sign, the rest are either way 
whacked in the head, gay(nothing wrong with that) or homeless and wont 
tell the boss.  
    The customer usually sees the happy gemini and the pleasant whacked 
workers trying their best to satisfy them, but uh-oh, watch out because 
if whatever is going on behind the counter comes out in front with the 
customer, consider it a soap.  
    Last night, my friend Sarah came in to my shop and I took my break 
(fourth, actually) I was smoking my cancer stick and telling her that 
all cafe workers should have electrode type thingies attatched to our 
heads with TV monitors up above displaying all that is going through our 
warped minds.  To be honest we would probably lose a lot of clientel but 
at the same time, we would gain the entire viewing audience of Days of 
Our Lives...It would be well worth it I think.
                                    Lotsa Love,
                                       Danny

I seem to remember that before we started to rave PAtrice 
that for a few months we could have been considered posers too.  You 
know because we totally stood behind & supported raves and dressedto 
go, yet never went. 
	Yes it upsets me to see a poser that has never been & 
dresses to go & doesn't want ot go but oh well whatcha gona do?

        trust : updates                               7/25/97

        Our last full-scale event, surrender, was a huge success, thanks
to everyone who contributed to make it such a beautiful experience.  We
ended up loosing us a bunch of money, due to lack of donations.  So we
are going to be putting together some smaller benefit events in the next
few months.  They will be friday night outdoor renegades in the bay area,
and will be denoted as 6.x.  Hopefully we will make back the $4000 we
lost on the surrender, before our next large event planned for spring
98.

        We are exploring many themes for the 6.x series, which will
include an ambient experience in the forest, hardtrance and acid, drum
and bass, and a deep deva disco house torture night.  =)

        Please help to keep the donation and shareware based events in
existance, we are going all out to provide beautiful events at any cost.
We hope to continue offer them relying on free-willed support from
everyone.

        We are going to be using mostly word of mouth, and internet
promotion for these events, to reduce costs.  point your browser at:
www.immersivearts.org, or stay in contact with the underground to learn
all the details as they evolve.


--------------------------

trust donation fund 7.0:

for the 6.x series events, our overhead is:
promotion:  $50.00
gas (for truck and generator):  $100.00

We are also in debt $4000.00 for our last large-scale event: surrender

We have recently started a dedicated permaculture fund, that will
hopefully grow to cover costs for a small eco-rave-village.

All surplus donations go to purchase new and better equipment...

We have recently purchased 2 cyberlights, a controller, and all neccesary
cables and cases.   Total cost approx: $19,000

our next purchase is:
2 electro-voice MT-4L.

These state of the art subwoofers provide 1,600 watts continuous power
per side...  an amazing 5,600 watts peak per side.   the cost of this
equipment is:  $6000.00

Equipment we plan on purchasing in the near future:
2 MT-4H (high box, companion to the MT-4L subwoofer)
4 terrorstrobes
2 more cyberlights

Thanks for your support...  Our (meaning all of our) events will continue
to thrive and grow.

-trust-

----------------------

The Shareware Concept

        In computer software the term "shareware" is used to describe
software that you may use before you pay for it.  This creates a trust
between the creator of the software and the end user, as the software
works whether you pay for it or not.
        We feel that this is an excellent way to throw parties as well.
Instead of charging for our events, to pay our overhead, and work towards
purchasing new equipment, we ask for what the attendees thaught the event
was worth.  this allows the ravers to experience and analyze the event
without having to pay for it first.  it also destroys the possibility of
paying $20 for a horrible event, while opening up the possibility to give
generously, knowing exactly where the funds will go.
        As this concept has not been tested very heavily in the rave
community, many people are unfamiliar with it.  We realize that it may
not work, and we will be forced to charge for our events.  We hope that
this is not the case, and that you, the ravers, will support the
shareware concept, and donate what the event you attended was worth.

------------------------

        trust : NO ATTENDEES ALLOWED

        This and all of our events are based upon particiapation.  When
there is even one person that is not contributing, there is a drainage in
the creative flow, that restricts the attainable energy level.  Our goal
is to raise that energy level by encouraging individual contributions.

        Particiapation comes in many forms, but the primary step is in
the mental picture of the event.  When one views the gathering as a
collective effort, where everyone involved (inculding themselves) is a
vital piece of the whole, an interconnected web is created linking
everyone.  When this interconnectedness is visualized by the whole, it
becomes very real, and nearly unbreakable from outside forces.

        After the relationship between you and the rest of the
particiapants has been established, the focus should move on to personal
creative desires.  All creative outlets you would like to contribute are
encouraged, whether it be providing decorations, singing, photography,
screaming for the acid builds, whatever, please bring/do it.

        As with all underground events there is the possibility of being
visited by people who think what we are doing is wrong and it should
stop.  These people will usually look for the "person in charge", in an
attempt to focus thier destructive energies on this person.  Within our
interconnected web there is not one person responsible, but many people,
everyone is responsible.  You may be approached by such an authority
figure, and you should be prepared to acknowledge your involvement, and
point out everyone else as sharing this responsibility.

        If you would like to contribute to these events, we would love to
have your energies there.


We love you!

[[sorry, i can't think of anything *more* rave related than techy
discusions about making music -- they don't call it techno for nuthin,
ya know?]]

So what do you all use for MIDI sequencing and audio? (esp synchronized
audio and midi??).

I use Cakewalk Pro Audio 6.0 (http://www.cakewalk.com), but that's just
because i've been using it and upgrading it for very little money since
about 1988. I kind of hate it, mostly because it usually crashes my
computer right around the time i got something good going. i keep on
thinking about trying something else, but i haven't felt like spending
money on cubase or emagic -- i prefer spending it on hardware because
at least with hardware, i can make some noize while my computer is
rebooting :-). Strangely enough, I've been more productive w/ the
braindamaged hardware sequencer on my MC-303 (or my Yamaha SY77) than i
have been in Cakewalk because invariably something goes  wrong or i get
sidetracked figuring out why something isn't working. In fact, if it
weren't for my need to store the gobs of controller data spewed out
when analoguing with my JP8000, i'd probably be perfectly happy w/ a
hardware sequencer.

I wish someone produced a music-making package that didn't suck (on
Linux, preferably, so it didn't crash every time you sneeze). Something
that supported the process of making dance music, as opposed to
orchestrating a bunch of wank for a GM synth card. Cakewalk and it's
ability to deal w/ music as "clips" seems like the right approach, but
its UI is just not quite there yet to make things foolproof and easy,
and neither is the reliability when you're sending out synchronized
digital audio along-side yer MIDI. 

I've seen Protools being used and it looks great but i'm not about to
go out and buy a Mac, and i'm waiting for things to stabilize in
MMX/pentiumville before i go off and buy a PCI-bus computer that'll
support all the new multichannel audio cards such as Event electronics
Darla/Gina/Layla...I currently have a 120Mhz pentium laptop and a
docking station with ISA slots for my Zefiro Acoustics ZA2 audio card
(http://www.zefiro.com) and a parallel port for my MOTU Midi Timepiece
AV).... my opinion is that the PC digital audio workstation concept is
still in its proof-of-concept stage right now, so putting anything
other than a minimal number of $$$ into such a system would be very
disappointing -- you'd be up to your neck in bugs and incompatibilities
and upgrades and crashes.

Sounds like us Sfraves music-makers ought to get together sometime
and jam, or talk, or share, or whatever.

PS: any of y'all have an opinion on MIDI gear i could use to do that
stuttering type gating (transforming) your hear on a lot of classic
techno. Yeah, I could try hammering the volume controller on my EMU
EIIIxp but that's not particularly easy to sequence. On the other hand,
there's the $1200 LA Audio MIDI Gate, which lets you gate/VCA 16
channels of  audio via midi note on/off (much easier to
sequence/synch), but it's  pretty expensive and kinda overkill. Then
there's the Presonus DCP-8 (8 channels, less money), but I'm not sure
if you can level control it quickly enough to get a transformer type
sound. What do you all use? Anybody know where I can pick up an LA
Audio MIDI Gate (or DCP-8) used?

forgot one thing w/r/t the original topic of discussion, which seemed
to be more oriented towards digital audio editing/tweaking/stretching/etc.

Check out Sound Forge 4.0 -- very complicated program, kinda expensive
for a piece of PC software, but it looks like it'll do just about
anything anybody could ever want w/r/t sound editing and processing.

If I keep on having the troubles I've been having with Cakewalk Pro
Audio 6.0's digital audio editing, I may be purchasing it myself one of
these months. Also, check out Syntrillium's Cool Edit Pro.

Subject: Emergency -- looking for Diego
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.org
Precedence: bulk

I was so stupid that I thought true love is in the day time... Today at
10:30AM, I went to a place in Palo Alto to pick up Diego but didn't find
him, then I went to F8 at 11:30 AM and wandered around trying to buy
tickets. Then Anakin told me the tickets will be selling from 9:00 PM.

If anyone of you have got Diego's number please could you give him a call 
and tell him that Bruce wants to go a bit earlier. Please tell him my
number (408) 247-2246 and ask him to give me a call or e-mail me. Actually
I had Diego's number but somehow it's lost in LA.

OK this is emergency because we may not be able to go to true love without
your help. 

Luv ya.
-bruce

Hey everyone out there.... just checking your mail one last time 
before you go out tonite?  yah, I thought so.  But, uh... this isn't 
Teresa.  Oh no... I kidnapped her and tied her to the bed.  This is 
Patrice.  After all the mean posts she's been sending to me (I am 
not aware of how many actually made it to the list) I decided to 
take action.  Teresa may be my master, but under the influence of 
some candy I slipped her, she is sedated.  I think, with a little 
werk I can transform her into the ultimate candy raver.  Then 
again... mebbe not.  Ok, she wrote on my arm.  If you can read it @ 
True Love... it says "I am owneby Teresa"  (She doesn't spell very 
well)  and her arm says "I am Patrice's master"  See what happens

Hey - I am out the door to see Crash Worship.

I want to go to True Love afterwards.

Can someone email me directions to True Love?

I am coming home after CW (2-ish?) to shower and check my email.

Please email!

Love and plaster....

I just tried to call the Voice mail before leaving and it seems that it's
not working correctly.  Hopefully somebody who is at the party may be
checking their email and get this message and let somebody in charge know
:)

Anyway, I can't wait to see everybody there.  It's going to be amazing to
be part of this event!

since I am visiting my parents in Sacramento(now they actaully bribe me
to come home)and am bored and again sober, I must spout off to SFraves
since I am missing the greatest parties(once again!)this weekend. I
can't believe I am missing True Love, and I also wanted to check out
that Mayan New Year campout in Sonoma... but oh well. I hope all of you
have a great time while I enjoy some beautiful 105 degree weather here
in glorious Granite Bay(my house is right on Folsom Lake)..

	actually it's a nice 70 out, although it is 1:30am..

	I just wanted to tell all you guys how much I luv ya, and I can't wait
to get back out there again. I finally met Pengo and Deepfog at a really
strange house party last Monday, and I'm so upset I'm missing the chance
to meet most of you, especially after Amanda made me promise long ago(at
Happy Kids make-up)to go to this as she handed me a pre-pre flier. I
wish you guys the greatest...

	just a little spout of sobriety there... but hey, I just designed my
mom's web page for her new business(Vietnam Connection).. the price I
requested was $340... y'all probably know that it's JUST the right
amount for something which I've been looking forward to for quite some
time now.... 

	may all of your paths be beautiful ones...

It is 3:42 a.m. and I just got back from True Love.  My boyfriend and I had
to leave early to spend some lovey, couple time together.  The ceremony was
INCREDIBLE.  The most real and touching ceremony I have ever seen.  The
love was felt everywhere, flowing over everyone.  The ring bearer was
adorable in glow-in the blaclight colors with a gorgeous ring pillow.  The
bridesmaids were darling little faries scatter good will, light, and love.
The bride was lovely in her flowing white gown, and the groom was eqully
lovely in his feather boa.  I have to say a special "hi" to Dave (I think
that's his name), the usher in orange who gave everyone a big ol' kiss as
they went out.  You are the coolest.  The most special moment came before
the ceremony when Laura read a deeply heartfelt speech.  A tear came to
everyone's eyes when she broke down with emotion.  It was an amazingly
beautiful experience, and I thank you for allowing us to share in it Amanda
and Dustin.  I think the ceremony bodes well for an amazing existence
filled with laughter, friends, happines, and (always) TRUE LOVE. . .

My boyfriend, Mac, would like to say something now. . .

i reiterate everything that robin stated.  As well, i'd just like to say
that this ceremony moved me (and everyone there, i believe) in such
wonderful, positive, love-affirming, and life affirming manners.  the
sharing of love, pure love the real thing, was felt by all and sent back at
the beautiful couple.  i'd like, as well ,  to thank all the spectators for
really feeling, really loving and really caring.

and one more from robin. . .

to all who were there: I feel a special bond with you, like we have
witnessed something special and great which has bound us all togehter.
Peace, happiness, and TRUE LOVE to you all. . .

Robin

Hi Everybody-

Sitting here eating an early scramble slam from denny's, I just have to say
that last night was incredible.  I don't think I could possibly sum up the
amount of love in the room when the wedding was taking place.  Hey even the
amount of love before and after the ceremony was incredible.  It was great
seeing everybody I knew, and meeting a ton of new people(way too many to
put into an email).  Special thanks + congrats go out to Amanda and Dustin
(who I finally met) for allowing all of us to be part of this special event
in their lives.  It definitely was true love :)

Now if I can only get some sleep without that music in my head distracting
me too much...

-Todd Manley

Todd,

I know what you mean about the music in your head going on and on!

What a LOVE-filled night!

Crash Worship crashed.  Jeno and Friends ripped! (talk about PLUR; it
was all over the house at 2nd & Jackson in Oakland!  Gangsta's, old
skool raverz, candy-ravers, freaks, goths, metalheads, trash,
princesses, and creeps COEXISTED so PEACEFULLY AND RESPECTFULLY in that
far-too-overcrowded-venue with limited free water.

True Love was loving.  I witnessed your set, & Uncle Noah's set.  Very
stimulating! (Especially for the dude on the bad acid trip...)  I
missed  Amanda & Dustin's nuptials; but the vibe amongst the kids in the
house afterwards was TRUE LOVE!  I don't think I have _ever_ experienced
such a collection of truly happy and considerate ravers!  (Folks, that's
saying something!)

CHI/Universal Fire: Again.  Yet another very happy, wonderful rave
experience!!!!!  What the hell is going on?  Did the Magic Fairy
sprinkle the entire BAY Area with only the best, or was it just the end
of the millennium washing all the regular negative shit from our
essences as predicted?  I fell in lust listening to ???? spin his
happiness.  And it was good.  Very good.

Came home.  Music thrumming trough my system.  Whip up a soy smoothie. 
Release feet from shoes.  Sleep.

I love you all so very much!

But that's me these days,

Diana Greer the converted cynic wearing a sticker on my cast.

This post is from Claudia and Eric:

Last night was unbelieveable!  First off the wedding was amazing. It
left us feeling an incredible sense of AHHH, Sigh!!! It was just great
seeing two people so much in love and everyone in celebration for their
love. The energy all night long was elevated to levels of pure
enjoyment. We've never experienced anything like that before. 

Thank you so much to the people who put it all together and made it work
so well. Congrats to the newlyweds!!! We wish you nothing but happiness
and eternal feelings of love from now until forever. 

Peace           Love            Joy             Harmony
Happiness               Bliss           Tranquility             and all
that
other stuff!!!

Good Luck to you both.

Love,
Claudia and Eric

P.S. Macadio was awesome!!!!! I love you soo much baby!! 
Love, 
Claudia

Coexisting on the highest level of True Love, that was what this party was
about to me... i feel so anxious to share this (already memory) with so many
of you, and yet wish i could freeze last nite, and live within that moment
forever.. i cannot even explain the daze this party has left with me... and
it's not the E... it is the feeling that i was not only a witness to 2
beautiful people exchanging their vows for one another, but also because
there will always be a glow inside me when i think back to this nite...  i
know that many if not all of you feel the same way...i love you all and i
hope you have a happy morning, full of this glow that True Love has left for
us... take care and i love you all
thank you Amanda and Dustin  and everyone there for sharing such an
incredible moment in time, together, that is true love~

*~*much love, good vibes, smiles and hugs*~*

We went back to VSF again last night. Much better music, the most awesome
dancer on stage I have ever scene. She was mesmorizing. Her name was Tracy.
At about 2:00 am they switched to deep house..sort of industrial trance..and
off we went.

What ever happened to high NRG music????? Too much creativity for me.

Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.org
Precedence: bulk

      First off this is semi-negative and very long. Both of which are not my
fortays. Please read then re read this. I am not trying to initiate anythign
here. If you have a bone to pick, e-mail me PRIVATELY. thanks.......


      I went to Satori last night and came to some serious conclusions. I am
a gumpy old, burned out, raver!!!=( 
    I just don't feel the same way I did when I first started going to
parties. I'm not collecting flyers like a maniac. I'm not dancing my ass off!
Did I lose the love? Did I go thru a phase? OR am I just sick and tired of
the scene in general?
     There are a bunch of reasons why I didn't like last night, as well as a
bunch of things I LOVED last night. There was incredible music, I was
surronded by my friends, and everyone seemed to be having fun.
    BUT, I totally can't stand the fact that my right to personal space means
nothing to promoters. I come to parties to dance and have a good time. At
ALMOST every party at 2nd and Jackson, I find that I have no room to dance,
let alone breath! It gets really nasty in there and very cluastrphobic.
People left and right were pushing each other. Nobody said excuse me, or
sorry.  I don't understand why promoters charge(and I am not trying to beat a
dead horse here) $2.00 for a bottle of water. PLEASE MARK MY WORD!!! I am
going to throw another Famtasia b4 I am off to merry ol England, and I will
sell bottles of water at cost... a mere 30 cents!! Anything more is bullshit!
Cept if you are charging a dollar because you have to pay people who work for
you to sell it and stuff. 
    Crash Worship was OK. During there intro I swiftly left the building
fearing for my life. I almost went up to the fire marshal and said something
to him. There was absolutley NO reason that they should have been spewing
fire onto curtains or throwing firecrackers and flowers into the crowd. They
used a lot of fire and it was insanely dangerous. What if they threw a
firecracker and it went off in front of someone's face, WHILE they were
fucked up, or when they are sober. I think it was totally careless of the
promoters to put the crowd at risk like that. That venue was not proper for
that type of group. But if people didn't give a shit or couldn't see that it
was unsafe and stayed in the venue, then it is there own fault if something
happened.
     Well, I think I have said enough here.. BTW I am really bummed I missed
Rob's set. Can someone please fill me in on how it went? Tony, Jeno and Josh
tore shit up!

Hey.  I wanted to take a minute to thank everyone involved with True 
Love, from Amanda and Dustin (hey congrats kids!) all the way down to 
whoever was the last person to walk in the door for putting together such 
a wonderful party and such a happy vibe.  I really had a good time 
spinning for you kids and I am very thankful to you all for hosting me! :)
My friend Ann from Sandy Eggo had a great time also and said she really 
liked meeting so many of you great folks :)
I'd like to extend a big public thanks to Todd M. and Rob Rayle for 
letting me screw around on the synths for a little while and I'd like to 
extend a special thanks to Rob Rayle for bringing all his wonderful toys 
and creations and dealing with getting shut down before being able to 
finish a really fun and exciting set (IMHO).  Let's hear it for the 
composers!  Live techno it where it's at, kids.  :)

Thanks again to all.

peace
Uncle Noah

Hey John,

Crash Worship is about the moment in which who *you* are gets taken over
[or given to, if you're like me] - the rhytm, heat, spectacle and
experience of something that we have supposedly outgrown as a species:
Surrender.

Does that make sence?  Fire is birth at the moment of death.  Re-birth
at the moment of re-lease. Plus, it's a lot of fun to dance topless in a
sea of bodies, touching and touched as it so happens - and know that you
_are_ safe. [Confession: I got some small burns on my hand and my right
nipple and almost passed out after dancing with the Centaur, but i think
those are definitely prices worth paying.]If you ask me, it's like -
giving into something that is so much bigger than you - not caring what
you look like or smell like or feel like, because every little piece of
what each and every single person does in the experience makes something
so much larger happen.  It's quite Gestalt, actually.

<snip>
There was absolutley NO reason that they should have been spewing fire
onto curtains or throwing firecrackers and flowers into the crowd.
<snip>Are you specifically speaking of the point at which a bunch of us
burned our clothes on the floor?  Just so you know - I saw no less than
two spotters, and they definitely had their eyes wide open on all of us
closest to the flames.

Crash Worship is release and joy and unity, just as so much of what a
good rave vibe is - it's just different.

I see where you're coming from Jonathan.  But I wouldn't say you're "a
gumpy old, burned out, raver" - it seems to me, given what you've said
here - you just don't jive with the CW vibe.

I'm sorry you didn't enjoy your time last nite.  Guess I won't be seeing
you at Burning Man, eh?

Kate

ps - Hernan:  I'm practicing the spray this afternoon :-)

We had an amazing time watching the love and committment of Amanda &
Dustin! Plenty of love to go around in the crowd as well. Thank you both
for sharing this special moment with us all.  We wish you all the love and
hope for a wonderful life together.

The rave was beautiful, the crowd loving and the music was wonderful.
We had a blast - True love indeed!

Until we meet again - love to all,

Hello everyone its me Jeremy back again for my night reccalections. I was so
happy to arrive at True Love w/ plenty of time in the day to help set up.
(Thank you Julie Hayes) I said my hello's then went to visit my friends at
Pro-Soy. I love Amanda and dustin so there was no way I would miss tonight
ceremony. My trip to Pro-soy turned from hello's to two hours of sound
proofing the windows upstairs. its all good thought i love ernie, maya, and
rachel too. After some early work at Pro-soy, i treked over to True-Love
worked the final 4 hrs there helping set-up. Following set-up we waited for
people to arrive to some of Siphon's nasty Jungle. Then it was my turn to
work the door, there i was standing outside in my candy-pants greeting the
oncoming traffic of beautiful faces. Nick and i soon finished our shift w/
the help of Blow-Pop Eric, at around 11:30. 

Now it was my time to enjoy the party, when I went out side the vibe, and
Love in the Place was amazing w/ the help of set-up crew. When I returned it
had quadrupled in size, but the vibe only got better. Marty was soon to
finish his set, damn i hate missing marty spin, oh well there will be much
more music later in the night. by 12:00 the mad heads I had hoped for had
arrived bringing there smiling faces and leaving the baggage at the door.
Thank you.  

the ceremony soon arrived for us to see, i witnessed some I thing i could
never forget. Not sayuing I would ever want to, but i never could. It was the
entire scene coming together to for one common cause, Amanda & Dustin's
TRUE~LOVE. There Love filled our hearts as did Lara's beautiful speech, that
helped show a glimpse in to that grrl's amazing heart. i will forever be
proud of you for sharing w/ us so lovely. Vertigo did a outstanding job w/
the ceremony, "You go boy." 

if I thought the vibe was beautiful before, it got soooooooooo much better
following the ceremony. i stayed around for it a bit then it was time for me
to get my fix on Ernie DEAKS. In my point of view he is the best DJ in the UG
scene, and a good friend. I then made the trek back to Pro-soy, I was happily
greeted at the door by my CFC friends. THere is nothing better than having
good friends throughout the scene. I arrived, and Sabin (Cloud) was spinning
some crazy shit. I was mad impressed. However I Deaks was not on for about a
!/2 hour, so i walked around saying "hi" to all my friends over here. I was
in line for the restrooms when i heard someone mixing out of  Cloud's set. I
knew it was time, YESSSSSSSSSSSSSS, It is so phucking hard I danced so hard
my feet still hurt.  I think this was the first time, alot of these heads had
experienced him. It definately is always a experience for me when ernie
spins. following my hard-stepping dancing all i could do is return to True
Love. 

That is where I belonged that night, I couldn't dance anymore, too tired. so
i hung out w/ all of the beautiful people at true love ( Amber, Nichole,
Jennifer, Jamie, andrew, Euginia, Shawn, ari, jeff, and everyone else i
forgot to leave out.I love you too) Then my next mission to find a ride home,
mission accomplished I love you two Kevin, and Jessica. I'm sorry this post
is so full of PLUR, but after last night, nothing else would have done it
justice. I love you Amanda and Dustin.

love~jeremy

for everyone else, this weekend seems to have gone exactly as i had predicted
it, it was epic. after a series of about two not-so-good weekends, i had been
planning on this one to be one of the greatest, with tru luv on saturday (a
wedding at a rave, now what can beat that) and then crash worship today.
yeah, i had an interesting night last night, stuck in the hospital barely on
this oxygen treatment with pnemonia (i would have rather been at true love,
but atleast i had a good looking nurse). and today i'm not allowed to leave
my bed but i can actually breath again. anywayz, i keep reading all these
amazing posts and i hope that maybe after next weekend one of them will be
mine. keep the good posts rolling in.
plur and good health to all

well gotta do somethin.

um...i had a friggin blast at this party.

totally.

my eyes watered as i watched lara, amanda, dustin, um, let's see who else,
um, SPENCER!, um, who else, well i think that's it, get in front of a
microphone and talk in front of 2-300 people.   wow.  that's something i
really can't do.  i'd crack up.

but i can play in front of 2-300 people.  so i did.  and my sets are only
as good as the crowd dancing to them, and let me tell you, i saw a lot of
BUTTS shakin away.

of course, i dunno if anyone noticed me swingin my booty on top of the
chair at the smart drink table.  i figured since there were no cages at
this place where people could show off, that i'd do something similar.

but wow.  karma-wise, i read dustin and amanda's energy as being very clean
and pure.  therefore, they deserved this party to go off and this beautiful
wedding.  one thing i liked was the fact that the wedding was only a very
small part of the whole party.  pretty much after it was over they were
back to doin what they do best.  make other people feel like they mean
something in this world.

see the frog float.

Babs is cool.  So is um...Lisa W.  Kat W. bill...hope...andy
p....pablopop...danny...fubari/jelo conglomerate (hi guys!)...iris and
ben...pengopen...alik e...beth j...jill......

you know what is so funny is i never ventured downstairs more than once or
twice to get water....it lookied like a totally different party down there.
i think that downstairs room should be the ambient room next time.

get vlad to do some mc'ing.

no just kidding.  but the expresso bar would have to be in full effect.

along with the 'assorted greens' menu...

well i guess i thought i had more to say.

but sometimes less is better, wouldn't you agree?  =]

Man, there are some parties that change you.  For example; Superlove,
Eminence (w/ Keoki), Love Affair, and True Love.  These kind of parties
are just so awesome that they just change your point of view towards life
for the better.  True Love last night was one of those parties.  The love
that you actually see floating in the air was just awesome.  It just
reminds me of how wonderful our scene is.  We should be so proud to be a
part of this.  I know that I'll be very proud to describe to my kids what
I did while I was growing up.

That party had absolutely nothing to be ashamed of.  Everything there
wen't perfectly.  First off, I believe it's because it was at Cyborganic.
 God I love that place. :o)  Then every DJ that was there just did an
amzin' job.  That was the first time that I know of that I heard Marty,
and also Anakin, and without a doubt they were awesome.  MACADIO, man,
you were rippin' it up down in the basement.  I swear I've never danced
so much to so many awesome ass tunes.  (I hope I didn't make your head
any fatter than it already is.)  UNCLE NOAH'S set was very lively and
much fun to listen to after one has inhaled a bit of some herb.  I was
having a blast just chillin' and listening to your set.

Then the wedding.  Geeez, that was really great to watch.  Even though I
had one of the worst seats in the house, listening to it was just
beautiful.  Seeing those two so happy to be joined together in the scene
where they both met.  Hey, didn't Dustin propose to Amanda at Cyborganic?
 That is just so cool.  Also, LARA, your poem was very powerful.  I give
you phat props for that material that you produced.

All in all, that was a great party to be at and anyone can consider
themselves lucky to be there.  HEY BYRONI!!!!  You shoulda gone.  It was
such a bomb ass party.

One more, ORSON, where were you?  I looked all over for you.  Matt said
he saw you once but I didn't see  you at all.  Oh well.

And finally, congratulations to DUSTIN and AMANDA.  I wish you two a
happy life together.

Bye Bye

What happened to the voicemail for the party for True Love? Just out of
curiosity, what time did the directions to the map point go up at? When I
called I just got a long beep. Due to my confusion, my friends and I headed
out to Oakland to go to Satori. What the hell we wanted to see what all the
hype surrounding Crash Worship was all about.

We saw fire, sweaty naked people, paint encrusted bodies and bobbing
paper-machet heads. SOMEONE PLEASE explain why these people are so
entertaining and appealing. I just don't undersatnd. I'm a very open minded
person, but I rilly couldn't figure out what was so amazing about them.
Anywayz, Jeno, Minor Minor, Josh etc. tore the place up so that made the
night worthwhile. The highlight of the entire event (in my humble opinion)
was in the morning around 4 to 6 when all the people that sat around in the
main room left and awesome progressive busted out and everyone, (the few
left) just grooved on 'till the very end.

I would like to know how Universal Fire was. I would appreciate it if someone
could post a review of that party. I'm rilly happy to hear that everyone that
went to True Love had an amazing time and congratulations to <3Dustin and
Amanda<3!

Hope everyone had a phun philled weekend ;)

Hey everyone.  I'm a sad, sad little tekno diva.  I'm sure you all noticed, I
wasn't at True Love last nite.  I made it to San Fransisco... but that's
another story.  If you want to know all about it you can e-mail me and I'll
tell you.  So with all my true love gear, I ended up going to Satori.  Mebbe
it was the fact that it was my sober nite, or that I wasn't in the place I
really wanted to be.  But this had to be the worst nite of raving in my short
little party life.  Cruising the line, I noticed a bunch of people that
didn't look like the usual crowd.  (going in I had no idea about Crash
Worship or what was going on)  Bunches of naked 50 year old stoned out people
screaming and running around.  Thought maybe they'd stay in their room and
we'd stay in ours.  Oh so Wrong.. The nekkid people ran into the rave chamber
at about 2 a.m. with fireworks, flamethrowers and drums n' screaming loud
enough to scare the DJ into stopping his set.  (that or it just drowned out
the music)  NEways.. After my hair caught some sparks we left..  I'm really
sad that I missed True Love, and I know I looked stupid for crying at Satori,
but that's how I felt.  I need cheering up if anyone feels like e-mailing me.
 That's about all.

          hugs,

They
 used a lot of fire and it was insanely dangerous. What if they threw a
 firecracker and it went off in front of someone's face, WHILE they were
 fucked up, or when they are sober. I think it was totally careless of the
 promoters to put the crowd at risk like that >>

Hello there,  I just woke up and it is around 6:30 PM yuck! and now 
checking the reviews,  I really appreciate your comments about me.  I 
feel like I've been blessed and honored to have been able to have helped 
with the wedding and to able to witness such a strong , loving group of 
people shed tears as the beauty carried on through out the evenning.  I 
know every person at True Love did experience the love that everyone 
shouls feel even at 6:30 pm when they are a total E-tard.

                                 Lots More Love To All,
                                     Danny(the guy in the orange shirt)

What an interesting night. It started out being stuck in a line with all
types of people freezing my ass off as I wore shorts. Finally the line
starts moving and I get to be searched and they look in my bag and ask me
about my sticks which look a little burnt and I say their my jggling
sticks (which they are) and on I go... We get in to a small room with one
stack of speakers arranged to produce a good amount of sound, but no
stereo image which feels a little wierd.

Someone plays for a while and a whole bunch of glittered up people stream
in and dance with wierd looks on their faces which seemed out of place
with the little shiny happy cutsie backpacks they had on. So me and gem
stand around talking and tapping our feet as the room fills and we notice
their is a pretty definite division between people, there are the "ravers"
and then there are those there for Crash Worship (and a few of us that
were there for both)...

Eventually the other room opens and it means we have a chance to get to
the toilets for the first time in many hours... We then notice and comment
on the fact that the free water people are not there and the NomAd
interactive types seem to be selling water for $2 a bottle (I believe
they were smaller bottles than normal, like a 10 instead of a 12 oz).
Later we find that they are taking water at the gate (hmmmm)... Eventually
a band comes on but it isn't crash worship and it seems everything is way
behind schedule and we realize that this is going to be a problem as the
Crash Worship people are not on the same schedule as raver types. Not
only this, but the sound system is distorting to hell (hmmm, or maybe it
was so loud that was my ears,though the wet toilet paper seemed to take
the edge off it).
	So we sit waiting for the band to end as going into the rave room
proved pretty uninspiring... And we wait.... And we hear the glittered up
people in front of us commenting on the girl in front of them who had on a
see thru dress with underwear on under neath and how none of these people
seemed all that (i believe)... And then the band ends, ah ha! And people
start moving forward a bit and then the speaker's erupt forth with..... A
rumblingkick drum... Ohhh gooody... And then some electronic noises, hmmm,
and then its tribal house which certainly isn't what I have heard about
crash worship... And the music seems a far cry from the tribal drumming
and banging and bending that I know cw shall produce and so the housey
stuff just doesn't move me now... Oh well, back to soaking the torches I
suppose...
	I sit and try and talk with the people I was there with, but the
wet toilet paper has does a pretty good job at attenuting the frequencies
necessary to understand human speech, so I sit and wonder how strong the
kersone is smelling for a long long long long time... And then I am
thristy, so off to get some water, but it seems the free water ran out. So
I volunteer to take their cooler and fill it, if they will get me past the
security which was instructed (most likely by NomAd interactive as it was
their security I believe, though I could vbe wrong) to take people's
water. Alas, they are just doing what they have been told to do and they
won't help me out here, so I fork over $2 for some water (which they
seemed unwilling to sell me, must be the dreads or something)... And back
I go to my seat on the cool concrete, in between some raver's who
complained about CW followers and CW followers who have been waiting for
2+ hours for an experience to being (and who are tired of this slow
monotonous music)...
	Eventually I see other torches moving toward the stage and that
means something is going to bne happening... And sure enough, something
did happen... A percession of skilled fire breathers and torch bearers
moved into the crowd followed by the band, and the crowd responded. Fire
has an alluring quality, I think everyone feels, it has the ability to get
your heart beating when a plume of fire rushes up and the heat wave rushes
out. And then the drums pound out rhythums which reminded me of the
festivals in Scotland (hell, the percession remind me of one night in the
woods with torches lit people danced through woods followed by bagpipers
and drummers gathering more people as they wen, down the path to satavi's
sound system, ahhh the memories, but I digress) and the drums pound and
the guitar pitch bends, and the bass makes bass noises and the crowd
dances, no the crowd STOMPS, and people yell and scream, and fire
erupts... And you sweat, and people are packed in close but no one minds
because from that close hot dance, the enrgy builds and builds and
builds (until CW stops or comes up with one of those 4 or so rhythums
that I just couldn't figure out how to dance to)...
	I remember one couple that I coiuldn't surmise whether they were
with the band or not, a guy in black and red and a girl, who knew how to
swing a torch, I wouldn't mind taking a lesson...
	I saw a few people I met up at Fly Ranch over labor day (ok, I
didn't so much as meet them as worked with them, but I have a decent
memory for faces). I saw some raver types picking and choosing their
grinding partners (though very few of them seemed to want the grind, maybe
it's something about the motives, or maybe its something about the fact
that these guys never wanted to get involved with the girl's energy, they
just wanted a thing that moved under their pressure? The same with
half the guys grabbing at the watermoleon woman's ass)...
	There was something about CW which reminded me of what I like
about really good parties, and that is the way the energy builds and what
it builds from, and I fear over time, with everyone focused on making
raves "comfortable" places, this has either been lost or throw to the
side, snd so be it... If raves are a business then safety and
comfortableness of the clients are of the utmost importance. On the other
hand, if raves are a bunch of people with a love of something incommon,
donating forth money so as to split the cost of the event evenly, then
what CW made of the participates of the show seems entirely just what the
crowd ordered up ;)
	Eventually the pounding and banging built itself up in the middle
of the floor and ended with 3 beats of the drums in unison (I think it was
3)... And then the crowd moved away and I rinsed the oils from my mouth
once last time and put the torches away to look down at a most grimmy
floor... I looked under a bit and was told it was doubtful at whether
Minor was going to spin with the layer of crud on the floor, so we headed
out to the car to change clothes and drive home... I just want to know
where the rest of the gunk was, and where I can pick up a water based fire
extinguisher...

	Just when I thought the love was virtually dead in the scene... 
You all surprised me, reminded me why partying was such a big thing in my 
life. you all reminded me why I love being stuck in a hot sweaty room 
with 300 people. Why? LOVE. 
	Amanda and Dustin started a disease that spread so quickly last 
night -- I have never felt so much love in my life! I cried, I cried, I 
cried. Amanda -- you looked so divinely beautiful last night, especially 
after all the stress you had to deal with!! Dustin, you pimp! :)~
	The music was phat, I hafta give Rinse props for getting the 
crowd moving upstairs in a big way, even though a half hour was all he 
had. And Marty, Deepfog (yummy green stuph!) and Uncle Noah.. Rob Rayle.. 
Todd Manley.. MAN I WISH i 
was energetic enough to go downstairs, I'm sure you guys rocked the place 
as well! 
	"ALWAYS." MAN! Amanda and Dustin, your love is so beautiful!
We all witnessed something magical last night. TRUE LOVE MAN! :)~
I want to thank pyro n bruce for the ride home, you guys saved me. I get 
my car next week and owe you guys one :)~
	And for all who showed up, bringing your smiles, open hearts, 
good attitudes.. If I threw any negative attitude up in the air, I 
sincerely apologize -- too many things were going on all at once, and 
when you're doing 5 things at once to make sure your dearest Amanda's 
wedding will go perfect, PLUR is really at the back of my mind. 
	I will truly never forget this night -- Spencer, your joke was 
SOOPERDOPE! And Vertigo.. MAN you ROCK!
And Jil -- the "YOU ARE LOVED" pins were PERFECT! :)~
I could go on forever but yanno, It's time to sleep or something :)~

  +     I just don't feel the same way I did when I first started going to
  + parties. I'm not collecting flyers like a maniac. I'm not dancing my ass off!
  + Did I lose the love? Did I go thru a phase? OR am I just sick and tired of
  + the scene in general?

I've been at that stage before too man.  Know exactly what you are talking about, and figured I might as well add to your insight.

I've been enjoying the best that SF has to offer since summer 93', and have seen a lot of new and old faces come and go.

I think a lot of us have gone through this phase, brother.  Believe me, I have as well.

Ever been to a party and you were having the shittiest time and asked yourself, "Why am I here?"  Why isn't a nice cozy bed better than being here with a frown on your face, while it looks like others are having the time of their lives? The boom-boom is giving you a headache, the people are vibeless, the music sucks..... sounds familiar?

And how about when you feel so tired at a party, that you just have to go to a corner/chill room and sleep, waking up and the party is over?

When the party's over, the lights come on, and the sun rises, it's a dawn of a new day, and back to the realities of life.

There will always be the scene man.  If you feel like the vibe isn't there, then take a break.
There's such an array of choices that you can find on any given night- so don't limit yourself to one particular choice.  Diversity is life.

Much love man, Mr. 2

Brain to Danny, Brain to Danny,  we need to make initial contact...The 
bomb fest (True Love, I mean)was the most energetic, fun filled, 
magically tearful evenning I have ever experienced in my life.  I 
emailed Amanda asking if she needed help yesterday, not knowing she 
wanted me to help usher those gorgeous boys out to meet their women 
under the beach canopy, but when she did ask,  I was absolutly 
flattered.  A tRue honor indeed.  It was fun too cuz my "e" just started 
to kick in. It would have been fun anyways without  :) 
   All you fun filled people that I got a chance to meet lastnight are 
so beautiful in all your own unique ways, even the people that I didn't 
get to meet I'm sure you are the bomb too :) 

The decorations, lights, smells :( and  other pshychadellia made up for 
a wonderful evenning (after 7:00 I don't remember a thing sorry :))  
  Noah A, Collin, Lara, Nick, Anne,Vlad & Friend, too many new friends 
for me to name off, but it was a pleasure to meet and remeet you guys.  
Yury, Pablito, Gene Ryan,Deep,Bonnie, Paul, Fernando you babe! Russ, 
Kristin, BootieGo  ooops! I mean Vertigo :)  Bomb ass people that I 
would have never met if I didn't start spending my entire paychecks at 
parties.

   Last, but not least, Dustin, you are a cutie pie and so are you 
Amanda, Thank you for letting me help out with your beautiful rendezvous 
of love and eternal friendship and may your love carry you and all your 
invities into the next life with an event that we will never, ever 
forget.

Love To all, and to All a Good Night,
Danny (the guy in the orange)

	I'm only 23, was sober (except maybe for kersone fumes), and I
still had shorts on (I don't seem to remember seeing any completely naked
people actually). What exactly do you mean by 50 year old stoned out
people screaming and running sround? We as a group built a lot of energy
up in that room and I for one did yell and scream... What was it that
people didn't like about those in the big room? The nakedness? The
stompyness of the dance (I love stompy music, and I believe it is from
this kind of music that the "tribal" connotations come). Is it the age
separation? Sorry, don't know how to fix that... Is it the sexual element? 
That is a part of many people's life and can be viewed in about as many
ways as the use of e.

	CW broughgt something with them. It dropped what appears to be a
real bomb on numerous people... Now, if ravers are so open-minded, why are
people complaining about a difference of taste like this - why is it just
not your thing, but judged negatively to be "Bunches of naked 50 year old
stoned out people screaming and running around" who seem to be a threat to
ravedopm's very existence...

Hi Folx-

It sounds like it was quite a wild weekend for everyone...we had the 
ultra-lovey True Love wedding (congrats A&D) and the raw wild Satori.  Two very 
different energies BOTH of which IMO are elemental to the scene.  Sometimes 
it's great and good for the spirit to bond with others in a PLURRY state of 
mind, but sometimes ya just wanna tap into raw primal wickedness for release.  
I, however chose the middle path and went to neither, but had a great time 
nonetheless.  The day started out in GG Park for the Cannabis Network party, 
which was mellow and fun.  I couldn't dance for some reason, so just kicked it 
on the grass and ppl watched for awhile.  

The evening rolled around, and because it was the easiest choice,  me n Midori 
went to Minna  A couple glasses of vino and some funky beats were neat, but you 
didn't miss too much.   Walking towards the motosickle parked in that alley, we 
heard beats that were more MY style....bump bump thump bump.  The sign said 
"Private Party", but when we talked to the bouncer (who was really cool, BTW) 
he informed us it was the Pro-soy event.  He let us in without making us go to 
the map point first,  and we went upstairs for some hard fast beats-- jus what 
da doc ordered.  It was surprisingly crowded-- I thought everyone would be at 
TL or Satori-- and there was alot of recognizable faces from the GG party.  Who 
was the gal in the lime green bells and purple tshoes? Pure rave energy.  
Anyhoo, a good time was had by all.  It's great to know that at least 3 events 
went off on the same night all with success!

Now just saving some brain cells for Reggae on the River...anyone else going?  

Peace, Nathan

from gem (getting frustrated reading over dave's shoulder and wanting to
voice some thoughts...sorry about the piggy-backing) 		

 Participating in both CW and raves for several years now, i was looking
forward to Satori as a possibly illuminating and hopefully entertaining
experiment in vibe mixing...

  Conclusions: (being part of the experiment myself obviously skews allthe
data all to hell but...)
  1.) tekno d's and naked people do not mix. Unfortunately, i myself saw
only half-naked people, of all ages (don't know if they were stoned, left
a vital piece of testing equipment behind, but they had at least danced
themselves into a very altered state.is this a state only allowed in the
domain of the glitter encrusted?) However, i observed numerous people of
the raver persuasion who wasted no time in immersing themselves in the
middle of the throbbing bunch of sweaty bodies. they looked pretty
...ah...happy? transported? ecstatic, perhaps? maybe not such an alien
scene for some of us.
 
 2.) some people apparently only feel safe partying in a very well
controlled environment. (happy helmet salesmen, here is your El Dorado!)

3.) some CW followers do not like techno. 

4.) no one caght on fire. at least, not where i was.

5.) taking away  water bottles at the door and then selling little bottles
for outrageous amounts is wrong. at least alert people to this outpouring
of greed on the voicemail, we wouldn't have brought huge bottles with us.
(by the way, who gets them all later?)

6.) CW still plays when the genny goes out.

7.) all of us rave-goers who bought the whole mind expansion thingy we
read
about on the flyers we were given back in the early 90's had an awesome
time. maybe they just don't make rave propaganda like they used to. for
some people, chemicals, tribal music, dancing in a crowd that feels less
like a bunch of people and more like just a vast, vital, kinetic , larger
expression of oneself, and maybe a bit of humanity induced chaos thrown
in, is what we've thrived on. i think those people, no matter what drew
them to this event in the first place, had a good time.

OK, so I have to give Nomad props for bringing CW out at all, and for a
good location.  HOWEVER, "doors at 9, CW at midnight?"  Doors at 10:30 and
CW and 3:30 is more like it, and the free water ran out in about an hour.
So thousands of people get to sit around for three hours inhaling cigarette
smoke and suffering through the worst opening band in the universe while
paying $2 for 10 oz. of water?  And the directions to the event, involving
a whole TWO TURNS off the freeway, were totally fucked?  And the sound
system was so distorted in both rooms that all the DJ sets sounded the
same?  (WHOOM-WHOOM-WHOOM-WHOOM)  Come on, guys.  No class at all.

CW tore it up, btw, with the best show I've seen them do in several years.
I guess if you don't get it you don't get it.  If you can just let go of
your "oh my gawd, my backpack is all wet, my glitter will wash off, who
_are_ these freaky-looking people", and all the other mother-nagging and
schoolyard cool-paranoia you've internalized, you'll have more fun and be a
better person for the experience.  JSL wonders where all the bras and booty
went?  Right here, sir.  Just let your hair down, shuck your shirt, and
jump in.  And if you can't stand the heat, well, then get out of the oven,
hmm?

They've been doing this for at least eight years and I haven't heard of
anyone getting injured by the fireworks yet (and I've personally been to at
least seven shows in that time, all with plenty of fireworks).  All the
propaganda about "fire is dangerous, you'll hurt yourself" is only
half-true.  Why do you think they soaked the crowd down with fire
extinguishers before they started?  It's a warehouse, for crying out loud.
Concrete DOES NOT BURN, and neither do wet, sweat-soaked clothes.

(If you're not comfortable with what was going on, exercise your right to
leave.  Just don't assume the rest of us need protection.  The whole back
of the warehouse was open to the air so I wasn't worried about getting out
in a panic.)

Cigarettes tossed out windows, however, DO cause fires, like Oakland Hills.
 Dry grass catches fire much easier than wet warehouse.

I'll take that risk, thank you.

Well, aboveground, love was in bloom.  The decor was rave wedding caliber.
The lighting spaned from professionals as well as home systems (Thanx Rob
Rayle and Co.).  Smiles, bliss, and yes indeed... True Love....

But something vastly different was abrewing below...

After a walkthrough to the downstars room, well kiddies...  A RAVE WAS
GOING ON!!!!!

>From Pete doing damage to the InSect VS ViRus 2*4 (Yep a classic CD vs
vinyal match with Hard Acid being the Battlefield) in the wee Hrs of the
morning...

First up, Pete:
        -Did an excellent job of bringing the vibe alive. Unfortunatley the
switch on circut #6 had to keep being thrown. (Just too much power for that
poor lil fusebox).  Major props to all the opening DJ's... It's you who
start the flame and set the pace to which all the other DJ's must follow...
And Pete had them moving!   Peeps gruuving to that sick, drippy, breaks and
beats.  Driving the crowd up, breaking them down and building them up
again...

*** (Second DJ review intentionally left blank) ***

And then Macadio:
        - Despite the insurmountable odds (Police, circut switch being
thrown two or three times, and, oh , yeah a wedding).  Macaddy took people
THERE!  (And if you don't know where there is...  Well, some things are
best FELT not SPOKEN).  Some people spend many a years to acquire 1/4th of
the skills being spun by this gentleman.  Coupled with some _KILLER_
hypnotic trance... The Dungeon was begining to live to it's name... A nice
film of persperation acquiring on both floor and ceiling.  Dancers warping
themselves into thier own realities.

Micron had to keep it up,
        - With some new tracks up his sleeve, Dan showed the nature of a
true DJ.  The ability to move the vibe from hard Acidy beats to the melodic
flow of some serious mental trance.  And nicely done with some awe
inspiring flowing tracks. (Bettah put a lock on that record bag Micron =)
)...   4:30 AM and the floor was still packed with glowing vibe filled
Ravers (<---- OR insert YOUR term for positive vibe-filled persons here)!

So a slightly 420'ed Andy W  steps to the 1210's (I should know, cos I
420'ed w/him):
        - The words to Andy's set can be summed up as...  Unexpected.
Nonconformist. Unknowing...
Every time I think that I understand the message Andy tries to weave, he
suprises me anew.  I might of been just phyically drained or mentaly
overstimulated but Andy's set parked my ass and had me thinking Really Hard
(And quiet frankly, I can't remember what the fuck I thinking about!!!).
Props to the man that can sit this dancer!!!

But my mental haze dissapated with a oh-so-famillar sound of HARD ACID!!!
        - The remaining loyal of the underground sweatbox was about to
witness the magic of the InSect Vs. ViRus battle.  It looks as if the
spoils of of that war was our (dancers, that is..) sanity.  Now those two
can cut sheet up!  I saw another electronica wall crumble that night (or
rather should I say morning).  The cutting up and mixing I've only seen
parralled by our scenes' finest breakbeat DJ's.  Breakbeat DJ's cutting up
ACID??? Or Acid DJ's that are demanding respect by exaulting thier skills?
Whichever the case may be, these two were working not with just two
turntables, nor with two CD players... But with BOTH CD and vinyal mediums.
Major props.

I guess The City couldn't handle it either since the Po-po arrived @ 6:45
to say:
        "Party's over folx.  Time to go home...."

Hell no.

RAS commandos were in wait all along and quickly sealed off the bass-ment
from any outside forces and told the DJ's to commence...   How funny it was
to see the dungeon fillup again in the typical,
"just-try-to-stop-this-raver-from-having-a-good-time" fashion.  The
hardcorps were still rocking hard even as the last wax trax was dropped,
and as the undergrounds last tune was being spun I think not anyone truly
realized that the bowels of Cyborgantic will never again be treaded by the
feet raver-kin again.   An era has closed kiddies....  Now you can say,
years from now, that you once rocked in the underground of SF's legendary
Cyborgantic parties.

L-8 (or, untill next weekend...)

I must be a burnt out raver as well because I didn't like the show either.

I'm not going to complain about $2 water or starting late or any of that 
because I've lived through a whole year of Chicago-area raves and any 
event in the Bay Area is better than those.

However, I didn't enjoy Crash Worship's performance. I think I would have 
enjoyed it more if it had been outside. Yes, I do "get" the whole primal 
nature of it. If I'm interested in that in the future, I'll go to an SRL 
show. Now that I know I'll enjoy.

>NAKED PEOPLE ARE NOW SCARING THE PLUR OUT OF RAVERS.

Not at all. In fact, I rather enjoy knowing that those folks feel 
"comfortable" enough to get naked. It makes me more "comfortable."

Why didn't I enjoy it? The music wasn't what I had hoped for. (During the 
opening band I commented, "They sound like Bill and Ted practicing.") I'm 
not really that keen on cigarette smoke, let alone the fumes from burning 
fuel-soaked rags and fire breathers. I'm also not keen on 
excessive-alcohol vomiting, of which I was made to bear witness to 
several times. And the last thing I needed was some yahoo trying to sell 
me Special K. Put the whole thing out on the playa or on a beach and I'm 
sure I would have had a great time.

yes it was crowded but  surprisingly, it was less crowded than other 
events there.  by the time i got there, they only let one person in for 
one person out which helped keep down the number of people.

yeah, people there were extremely rude.

of course there was a reason.  for entertainment value.  people love 
fire and explosions.  it is a cool visual just as say lasers or 
projection screens.  Also, humans have always liked a slight aspect of 
danger.  it's a thrill.  for the same reason people watch scary movies, 
climb mountains, bungee jump, and skydive.  the fireworks and fire 
breathers were part of the excitement of the show.  In fact the main 
reason why i feel crash worship were so great was because it was so 
interactive with the audience.  just like the rave scene, the show 
wasn't just on stage but everywhere around you.  Also i find it kind of 
funny how a few firecrackers are much to dangerous to have at parties 
and yet toxic chemicals like E and acid are just fine. hmmmm.

later,

Back in the day, Funky Tekno Tribe threw those parties called "Le Theater de Futur" at the Richmond Civic Center, and they'd always have a spectacular performance w/ fire, weird dancers, and an awesome set by Dj Dan or Graeme for that matter.

Great parties! Reminiscing ol' times gone by.

Hey y'all. 

Well.

This show has certainly sparked some interesting & illuminating debate.  I
thought I'd add my review into the mix fer the hell of it.  This was
written for another list, but I thought I'd share it with ya.

I really want to underline that the mixing of the tribes (ravers and
primitives) is a *good* thing.  The music of each scene has tremendous
similarity at a very deep level; all you need to to hear it is listen. 
Listen to the beat.  Hear that?  It's trance drumming, and it's a
commonality that spans cultures and time since folks figured out beating a
stick against something sounds cool & could take you somewhere else... 

I was one of those people who went for both scenes, and i wanted to see to
what degree and how well they'd mix.  Yah, there were some sketch points. 
Everything didn't go smoothly, and it didn't help that Nomad put out
flyers promoting the rave with absolutely no mention of CW; i genuinely
think that it sucked that some folks got their rave brownie dosed with CW.
And i also noticed CW flyers for the Satori show that didn't mention any
DJ's at all.  What the fuck?  

Anyway, here's how it wuz accordin' to goolie:


*****************************************


Hey hey boogie bodies.

Well, we came, we saw, we burned, we got in various states of nekkidness,
we became one.

We, in this case, was Katie Z., Eric, and Wayne, although katie and eric
each had possies in tow (hi vagabond jim!) 

I have some rather mixed feelings about last night, but Crash Worship was
awe-inspiring, as usual.  

First, so i can vent, the lameosities:
  * Price-gouging $2 per bottle water (Their cost:  .30).  Few things
    aggravate me more then trying to make a margin on water.  And to add
    insult to injury, the advertised "free water" ran out in about an
    hour.   'Ran out' my ass, fuckers.  Do we look that stupid? 
  * Security armed with handguns
  * Blocked access to the bathrooms ("sorry, the room isn't ready yet) for
    a full half-hour, at least.  Great PR strategy!  Have you even seen
    50 people
    who really gotta go being told repeatedly to wait?  Can you say riot?
  * Crash Worship went on 2 hours late.  
  * Opening band for Crash - oh lord, have mercy.  Is my karma really
    *that* bad?  There wasn't even an opening band on the bill.
  * Nomad group space - this crew has some baaaaad mojo man.  Their
    current tally is 2 deaths at the Splish boat party, and 2 stabbings at
    their last massive at their space.  May it go no higher.  I don't
    think I'll be attending any of their events, unless given very good
    reason (like this show). 

OK, i feel better now.  

As i suspected, both the crowd and vibe at this party were very
interesting, with a fascinating cross section of house homies, candy
ravers, modern primitives, nekkid mud-people, neo-hippies, circle-dancers,
awesome age dispersion (easily teens though fifties).  Their were
definitely two distinct groups:  one to see Crash, the other to hear the
DJ's.  I was worried that the twain would self-select and basically ignore
each other, but there ended up being exactly the kind of
cross-fertilization I'd hoped for.  CW sucked in quite a few ravers of all
kinds from the House room, and at the end of the show, there were a lot of
the CW folks out there dancing away.

The primary similarity between the two (CW and DJs in general), and the
reason why each can interest the other's crowd, is, of course, the trance
drumming, and have I ever told you how much I enjoy commas?  I totally dig
that, I love the convergent validity of the Convergence, the sameness in
the difference, and visa-versa.  

CW Scenes:  
  * There was the Lucky Lady, carried atop her platform by at least
    10 of her paeonic male followers.  Completely nekkid 'cept for a small
    section of glittery cloth covering half of her cute ass and pubes, she
    would sit atop her charges, gyrating and lusting and fucking the
    entire crowd and no-one in particular at the same time.

  * There were the fire breathers and drummers of course, who circulated
    throughout the crowd for most of the show in a scene very reminiscent 
    of Brazil's Carnival. If you were particularly in
    the Zone, as i was, letting yourself go and willing yourself to the
    edge could easily take your right to the heart of the traveling
    drum n flame show.  At this range, the heat and flame could get quite
    intense, and as such there were two water-spotters who's job it was to
    aim streams of water at the burners.  Don't want 'em becoming
    burnees, y'know.  at one point, I was so close to the burners, i had a
    dedicated water stream aimed at me and the burner, else i probably
    would have been burned some.  Amazing and so intense. 

  * Assault on Raver Room - so, there's two main rooms in this joint, see?
    And CW is parading all over the room, leading this motley group of
    sweaty, smelling, flaming, tranced-out screamers from one end to the
    other like some burning man pied piper on acid.  All the sudder, the
    lead drummer/flamers make for the ramp that leads to the completely
    packed other room, where the likes of Tony and Josh are spinnin'
    away.  And we keep going, going, ploughing though
    the pumping, housing crowd like a very hot knife though butter.  Oh
    my, everyone was so loving it!  Right thought circle dancers (AWWWW
    YAHHH! I've always wanted to do that) and CW was so powerful that we
    just about overpowered the DJ sound system with *unamped* drums.  After
    our jaunt, we headed back to our assigned room, but Assault on Raver
    Room is something I've going to really remember... 

  * The Fruit Lady - dunno what else to call her.  Like Lucky Lady, she
    two was born above 10-12 porters, aloft & swimming in/on her platform
    of cut up fruit:  watermelons, pineapples, apples, oranges, you name
    it.  Nakedly wallowing in it all, she had an expression of bliss and
    ecstasy that is so rare to witness...  the crowd would run up and
    assist her in her fruit-smearing activities, spreading chunks and
    seeds all over each other, tossing fruit detritus into the void, she
    loving it as much as the crowd.

  * The bath Lady - also carried all over the floor by porters, taking
    a sudsy bath in a hottub like thing...

  * The Cheerleaders - One dude and one chick, complete with red-and-white
    pom-poms and letterman sweaters, standing atop the tallest bank of
    speakers, cheering the crowd & dancers & drummers & undifferentiated
    mob it all became on and on for the whole show.

I think the most bestest thing i got out of it all with the complete
blurring of the line between audience and performer.  We all became the
show.  Crash Worship demands that you take part and become one.  I dunno
who many of you have read _The Diamond Age_ by Neil Stevenson, but Crash
Worship very very very much reminds me of Stevenson's underground 
Drummers group...

The DJ's were excellent too.  Rob Doten was really hiting it well when we
got in, and Minor Minor was in the middle of a great set when we had to
leave at about 4:30 from overstimulation.

Hey, I have two friends who have tickets to Reggae on the River but

They are *super cool* and if any one could help them with a ride that 
would be awesome.  
They are, of course, willing to pay for gas.

Please call Natalie at 510-443-7531.

Yes. Because people keep going to parties that are thrown by these folks, 
and others like them who engage in the same practices. This is not
something new. And every time, a couple of people bitch about it, but then
they go to the next party and the same thing happens, and they bitch about
it, but then they got to the next party.... ad nauseum. If you want this
to change you have to let promoters that do this know that you *WILL NOT*
tolerate this, and won't attend their events. And you have to be willing
to follow through on this, no matter what talent they may be drawing.

Alex,FOR THE RECORD,  some [well, at least one] of us got ill after
consuming vast quantities of water and getting tossed around by other
nekked people.  We tried desperately to find a can, but - alas - none
were provided.

Haven't you ever been overheated?  Far as I know, the vast majority of
us who were there for CW were not on drugs at all.  We know better than
to fuck with our bodies and then place them in an environment as hot,
sweaty, naked and potentially dangerous as CW.

The thing that pissed me off/surprised me the most was that the
infirmary didn't have any salt tablets.  Does Nomad have even half a
clue?  No one should have been surprised by CW - THAT is what sucked
about the nite.

ARTICLE IN TIME MAGAZINE ABOUT ELECTRONICA

It has a cover of an alien on it and talks about the Roswell Files, but
within its pages is an article about how this summer was supposed to be
the SUMMER OF ELECTRONICA! <kabang>

It mentions that U2 has a great album out called Pop and a great tour
but sales are not doing so well (i don't know what to think about that,
is it worth mentioning?).  It mainly talks about Prodigy and the
Chemical Bros.; they put in a Moby quote; mention that there are about
the same number of electronic music fans in the US as there are Dennis
Rodman fans in Utah.  

Interesting article, look for it.....

Hmm...why is it that there are so many events on da calendar, but
so few of them look tasty?  I'm seeing more and more dj line-ups
where I recognize only a couple names...and the line-up is a major
factor in determining whether or not I'll consider attending a given
party (I know I'm not alone here).
Here's what looks good to me on this week's calendar:

Juggernaut (yeah, this surprised me!)
Terra
BBQ & Beats Campout (naturally!)
Orange Sunshine Dayglow
The Gathering (a given...moreso because of the word "free" ;) )
Lepidoptera (because I know da kidz, and they're all right!)
Portal 13
Electric Highway
Wyrd/Power of Love
Big Surprise (PHAT lineup!!!)

Does anyone relate?  Also, admitting my ignorance of what's currently
cool, would anyone like to alter this list to reflect anything I left out
that looks like a really good time in the making?
Love and peace, y'all!
Eric

***RAISE YOUR HANDS IF YOU LOVE MONDAYS!!!***

...I didn't think so ;)


God I don't even know where to begin.

An event like this is truely an awakening to many people in many 
different ways. Before anything else, most importantly and once again, 
Amanda and Dustin...CONGRADULATIONS!!!. Saturday was actually the first 
time I had the chance to meet these two INCREDIBLE people, and the 
feeling of becoming great friends with someone of whom I've met the same 
day has seldomly happened to me like it did on Saturday. You two are truely 
special people, and playing a role in and just witnessing such an 
incredible event was an experience which is truely one of the greater 
building blocks of life's journey. Anyone who attended true love on 
saturday, and had been unclear about what true love really is, I'm sure 
can now say that they have a better understanding. Once again, I wish you 
the best of luck.

Continued...


Stay Cool

Good morning everyone,
   I feel kinda weird asking you all a favor, and it is a BIGGIE, but 
I'm going to do it any ways...Tough circumstances ie. loss of job, 
contract up with home, and other things has pushed me to wonder if their 
is any body that would happen to have an extra room around in Berkeley 
or something not really picky but I need to find a place to live with 
good , friendly people, a job  (thinking of Berkeley because jobs are 
plentiful there) and fun times and new experiences.  I'm 19 a good, 
loyal cancerian that can use some help.
If you know of anything, please email me.   poobear@hotmail.com

Desperate and Stressin'
Danny Picard

I'm using Master Tracks Pro.  Simply because I've always used it (going all the way back to when I used to have an Atari 1040).  Pro 6 does everything I need in a Sequencer.  Plus, I know it so well that I just havnt bothered to switch over to one of the biggy sequencers.

I'd be into this!

I've done this with CC#7 (volume).  Most sequencers will let you draw in the continuous controller info.

Thanks for everyone who responded to my questions.  I'm satisfied, because 
your responses (particularly those about the history of jungle/happy hardcore) 
answered a whole lot of questions I've had for a long time.  I'm trying to 
reply to everyone personally but I'm kinda busy these days and it might take 
me awhile.

But the jungle-ish happy hardcore compilation "Best of Happy Hardcore" was put 
out in 1995, but the cover calls the songs "happy hardcore classics," so I 
have a feeling they're pretty old.  No matter, I really like them, as a matter 
of fact I'm playing cd 2 real loud right now.

If anyone wants to pick it up, I found it in the import section of Virgin 
records, although I had to dig through the hidden shelves underneath the 
displays and all that to discover it.  It's called "Best of Happy Hardcore" 
and it's a set of 4 cds, it's yellow, and it's put out by Low Price Music or 
something like that.  It has songs by Red Alert & Mike Slammer, DJ Slipmatt, 
and a whole bunch of people, I can send you a track listing if you like.

But thanx for the recommendations and information, I really appreciated it.  I 
learned a lot.

xoxo--Miccaela

As far as I can tell tonight looks to be UMOJA HI-FI, who I'm not familiar
with, but curious (Mohan, can you give us a briefing?)

The webpage, was new and improved with a coming events calendar and a link
to the RealAudio resources.

The one big question running through my mind is whether or not Raymond
Roker is still a part of tonight's line-up?  I might be mental, but I feel
like I remembered mention of him on earlier flyers, but don't see his name
anymore.


What's the four one one, Monseignor Mohan?

PAX,
MAX

No one ever saw that Lexus commercial with the jungle beats in the
background?


I've seen that one. And I don't even watch TV. I space out to much, to

A little while ago there was a thread about how to represent your
emotions over e-mail. I found this little piece of info that might just
help you guys out. Enjoy :)


We all know those cute little computer symbols called "emoticons,"=20
where

:) means a smile and :( is a frown.  Sometimes these are represented by
:-)

and :-(  Well, how about some "ass icons"?



Here goes:


            (_!_)      a regular ass


         (__!__)    a fat ass


              (!)        a tight ass


           (_._)      a flat ass


          (_^_)      a bubble ass


          (_*_)      a sore ass


          (_!__)     a lop-sided ass


          {_!_}       a swishy ass


         (_o_)      an ass that's been around


         (_O_)     and ass that's been around even more


          (_x_)     kiss my ass


          (_X_)     leave my ass alone


         (_zzz_)    a tired ass


         (_o^o_)   a wise ass


         (_13_)     an unlucky ass


       (_Clinton_)   international sign of an asshole




[Note: insert whoever you dislike into that last one]

An incredible gathering in shasta to celebrate the Mayan galactic
new year.....

The following qoute from Shamanic Trance CD give you 
a clue about how this weekend was.

Lets have more raves like this...

"Do you remember the times when we danced around those original
campfires, 
 One tribe united in Spirit, celebrating our connection to each other,
the
 sky our father and the earth our mother.  Dancing gave us power.  It was
 our rite of passage, our shamanic journey into altered states of reality
 where we embodied Great Spirit and the magic of life.  We were the
 American Indians, we were the aboriginals, we were the Celts, we were
the
 Jungle Tribes.  We stomped, we chanted, we raised our arms in the air.
 We were there...and we still are now......

              Let us forever live the eternity of the dance.

         With love, as One, may we always remember the sacred ways.

                           RETURN TO THE SOURCE."

 Hi,
UMOJA Hi-Fi is TOMAS (whom I'm sure a lot of you are familiar with), JUN
(who's worked with QUANGO MUSIC GROUP) and mixed the QUANGO SPORT CD and MC
CORKNI O'DIRE. ABSTRACT will be opening for Umoja. Raymond won't be there
due to URB commitments, but we'll be doing a 'SCIENCE' night soon ;)
On the flip side, we have these shows coming up...

Next Monday Aug 4th
TALVIN SINGH and the ASIAN UNDERGROUNDZ EXPERIENCE presents ANOKHA

Just spoke to Talvin and he's pretty excited about the show... though not as
excited as I am ;)

Monday Aug 11th
Brian G from V Recordings and a VERY, VERY SPECIAL EXCLUSIVE DEBUT DRUM AND
BASS set by our resident DJ SNEAK!!!

Monday Aug 18th
The return of DJ SS and MC WARREN G!!!

As far as I can tell tonight looks to be UMOJA HI-FI, who I'm not familiar
with, but curious (Mohan, can you give us a briefing?)

The webpage, was new and improved with a coming events calendar and a link
to the RealAudio resources.

The one big question running through my mind is whether or not Raymond
Roker is still a part of tonight's line-up?  I might be mental, but I feel
like I remembered mention of him on earlier flyers, but don't see his name
anymore.


What's the four one one, Monseignor Mohan?

PAX,
MAX

Hey all,
I had a few questions about this Juggernaut thang this weekend.  How are
the parties that Spacechildren throw?  I totally love the lineup,
especially if the price is 20 bux.  You'd pay 20 bux back east for not even
as many cool ass people on the lineup.  Just to see the phat ass Techno
lineup.. i'd pay 20 bones.  Anyway.... My question was about the story of
the 4 hour wait in line last year for their party?  I just wanted to hear
about the quality of the events..... No matter what I am going. I cant miss
Spacetime Continuum.
Thanx... Take care y'all... Love Toy :)

OK, I want to ask a question that is extreamly opinionated. It has to do with
drugs, But I am not sure whether or not it has been discussed. Is this
subject matter something we can all discuss without letting it blossom into
something it is not.. I don't want to create a flame war and i dont want to
cause tension. 
Is this question I have worth asking??
If someone goes to a rave for the first time and does drugs, will this
persons concept of what raving is all about be drug related? What about
someone who goes to their first party sober, then tries drugs at a party, or
someone who never does do drugs...

Hey there love toy!!!!!!

well in my opinion, all the space children parties I've been to have 
been bomb!!!!!!!!!!!So, I would definately recommend going because it
DOES have a pretty good line up of djs. Plus, there is sure to be 
plenty of sfravers there to bring some good vibe like always :P

we should set up a meeting place there, anyone have any ideas?????

see ya there BABY!!!!!!!!!!!!!

well, the first rave i was at, Sharron 91' i dropped E for the first

guess.

given the number of volvo's driving slow in the fast lane that make
people pass on the right, i'd expect volvo to be playing ambient, or
even new age music in their commercials. the only thing that's slower
is a  vw bus, but that's partially because the driver is trying to
channel jerry from the hiss on a 20 year old 50th generation bootleg
tape of the dead.

It depends on a persons individual persona and personal choices...Also someones maturity level and age must be taken into consideration.  I think that we as ravers need to help get the drugs out of teh forefront of our scene and get the music back to the forefront where it belongs.

I dont think this is a question that can be answered.  Like you said, it is a very opinionated question.

I really think it depends on the person.  I was sober at my first party.  I didnt even know what E was.  I personally dont think Raves are all about Drugs. However, no matter what anybody says, Drugs are a very important part of the Rave.  Always have been, always will be.  Its up to the individual to decide if Drugs are important to them, and if they need drugs to have fun at the Rave.

*that* long, I don't know if it has been over-argued.  Anybody wanna voice

OK, I want to ask a question that is extreamly opinionated. It has to do with
drugs, But I am not sure whether or not it has been discussed. Is this
subject matter something we can all discuss without letting it blossom into
something it is not.. I don't want to create a flame war and i dont want to
cause tension. 
Is this question I have worth asking??
If someone goes to a rave for the first time and does drugs, will this
persons concept of what raving is all about be drug related? What about
someone who goes to their first party sober, then tries drugs at a party, or
someone who never does do drugs...

I think it all depends on the type on the mentality of the person.
for example, from my experiences.

people who have NEVER done drugs and/or have always thought of them
as big NONOs and go to a 'rave'for the first time and do 'e' for the
first time, they get to see a lot of the plury thing, and get to learn
about 'vibes'and stuff, etc..you know, all the goodies.

Everyone is different...it depends on your mentality and the party
you go to I guess...its all about the experience :)

Cause of Head aches::::::: The main reason that people get headaches is from
presure that is built up from blood in the brain. Your brain is being
squeezed and it doesn't like that. So your brain complains and that is your
headache. Headaches are caused from many different things but the most common
is stress. Usually if you have been under a lot of stress or even minor
stress, your neck muscles tighten up. When this happens the blood flow that
moves into the head is constricted by the muscles in your neck, so that the
blood flows in but it is hard for it to flow out.

How to get rid of Headaches::::::: Yes you can take Tylenol and all of those
other legal drugs out there but they are not to good for you (in high
amounts). ThE bESt WAy tO gET rId Of hEaD ~AcHhES~ the natural way is this
-------------> Relax, breath in seven counts and breath out seven counts. you
lay down on flat surface (preferably a bed) stomach down (If you are on a bed
let your head hang off the end). Now you need a freind to massage your neck
on the sides and on the top. Gentily pull the head from the shoulders. This
will loosen the neck muscles. But when you gentily pull DO NOT add any
torque, you could hurt the person. Continue to message the back side of the
neck. Soon your neck muscles will be loose and your headache will have
vanished. This also works for stiff necks too. Hope I helped. Party on
                    O r i o n

CC#7 is what i meant by "hammering the volume controller". However,
dealing with these as MIDI notes (as the LA Audio MIDI gate permits)
would be a lot easier to control, and more musical (as opposed to
computical)... TOo bad it's so f'ing expensive. Drawing in the
controllers seems like a real pain -- hard to edit, hard to change the
timing, etc.

hello all-

>Is this question I have worth asking??

what question isn't worth asking? =)

>If someone goes to a rave for the first time and does drugs, will this
>persons concept of what raving is all about be drug related? What about
>someone who goes to their first party sober, then tries drugs at a party, or
>someone who never does do drugs...

i went to my first party not exactly sober, and in my experience <flame
fodder>i have had a different experience from those i know that started
partying sober</flame fodder>.  was it better?  i don't know.. you only get
to go to your first party once, so i have nothing to compare against!!!

in my not so humble opinion, i think it totally depends on the person as to
what is better.  knowing myself well, i think that the life changing
experience i had at my first party might not have happened had artificial
chemicals not been coursing through my brain.  THAT WAS ME, AND THAT MIGHT
OR MIGHT NOT BE RIGHT FOR SOMEONE ELSE!!!

my concept of raving, though, has not been all drug related.  after my
initial six months, i started going sober, and started having a very
different, but welcome, experience.  i started working on the parties,
giving water to everybody, doing that parental thing that i do well.

that's my opinion.  enjoy!!!

love to you all-

matt =)

Hey all I thought I would just put in my 2 cents to these posts.
my first party I was sober and the party was not that great. It was at
one step beyond about 5 years ago the sound and DJ's were not so hot
but it was after all my first "Rave" and it was new exciting and fresh
the scene had been here for about 2 years before I started going to
parties. then I went to the second gatherings new years party at
vallejo fair grounds Took some mind bending chemicals and had a great
time, not that going sober the other times were not good. It is just
with the chemicals the music sounds louder and tripEr and you feel
real happy and unhibited you are and as well as everyone else very
open. Fortunatelly I had a ravEE partner and me and her had a bonding
experience. So to sum it up I think you can have just as good of a
time sober or Bent. I think a person should ExpEriEnce a party in
altered states at least once to get the other side of the fence
feeling.

>If someone goes to a rave for the first time and does drugs, will this
>persons concept of what raving is all about be drug related? What about
>someone who goes to their first party sober, then tries drugs at a party, or
>someone who never does do drugs...

hmm... let's start with the people i have brought to parties through the
years. a lot of them went with the intention to experience both the partying
itself _and_ the drugs. let's all be honest here, to most people the rave
scene _is_ a drug scene. and a lot of first-timers go just because of this.
and yes, if your first party is a party where you do drugs, they will become
very important when you party in the future.
oh yeah, my friends. a lot of them very average joes and lindas with no
real interest in techno music. they had heard my stories, they had seen me
all pimped-out and ready to go. and they wanted to find out what it was like.
so i brought them along. and i'm sure a lot of people on this list went to
their first party without being total technoheads. and if you're not totally
into the music, and it's your first party so you don't know too many people,
the drugs might be a really "good" way to get into the whole thing.
unfortunately, this might lead to the person being totally bored at a party
if they don't do drugs. and in the case of a few of my friends, if the party
is $10, they won't go unless they have at least $50. "it's not that i can't
have fun without drugs, it's just that...well, you know" is the kind of
argument they'll come up with. pretty sad isn't it?

i hope no one took offense to my post. =)

Well...thats a good question.  Do we actually want to meet and Jam, or just swap tapes, or talk, or hang out?   I'm down with all of the above.  Where do all the SFR SynthHeads live?  I'm in San Jose.

Ya, it can get quite time consuming.  Another way I have done this is with a Gate.  I have a Yamaha ProMix 01 that has a built in Compressor.  The compressor sucks, but the Gate works well.  Lets say you want to do the transforming on a sound thats coming in on mixer channel 1.  You set the gate to effect the audio on channel 1.  You can set another mixer audio channel to open and close the gate.  So what I've done is sent a sound (doesnt matter what type of sound, but preferable a short perc. sound like a closed hi-hat) to mixer channel 2 with the channel volume down.  If the hi-hat sound is sequenced 16th notes, you'll get a 16th note gate on channle 1.......  

hmm.. hopefully that makes sence.  I'm having a hard time 'splaining things today for some reason....

how 'bout using a compressor/noise gate?  many gates have a key - a 
controller that allows the signal to flow through.  this can be triggered 
with an external source, such as a drum machine or a synth...  another
possibility is routing a square wave lfo to the vca gain or the vcf 
cutoff.

actually this is not really an opinion needed, but they are very
welcome.  

this is more me expressing my opinion.  and it's right along the same
lines as Jondabombathon's post.  

i am not a drugless raver, but many of you have been shocked to find out
that i have gone through many a rave night sober.  recently i've even
gotten invites and with a sort of comment toward the end like 'you're
gonna take e too right?'  and i have sort of more or less made the
decision that i am bored with psychedelics because i've been using them
since i was 16 and now i am going to be 30 this year.  

but i've made the sort of committment to some people that are throwing
house parties over the next 60 days and some of these committments to
stay and do drugs i may have to reevaluate.  

some of you may be reading this and i hope you don't take this
personally as an attack on you personally.  but i am in a totally
different space than a lot of you partygoers right now.  i am in
business for myself at least part of the time, and when i go to a rave
and stay all night without sleep, it is hard enough to recover and get
back into 9-5 mode so i usually spend all day sunday sleeping.  

but there is just this amazing push i receive from some people to make
sure that i make it to the next after party or whatever is happening
right quick soon.  but i get bored easily and what i have discovered is
a new drug anyway.  

that drug is called achievement.  

making a difference in someone else's life.  
helping people.
giving complements.
telling someone they're the coolest.  

i would like some of you to try this drug.  it's addicting.  in the long
run, it's more addicting than ecstacy.  

some of you that i observe at ravEs take a lot of ecstacy, well, too
much ecstacy.  

ecstacy is a doorway to pure love.  it's meant to be opened, observed
and shut.  

because otherwise you let out all the heat you've saved up in your
spirit.  you know?  like when someone leaves the freezer door open and
then you come back and everything is melted?  especially the ice cream! 
=[  

i hope i didn't offend anyone.  but i hope that some of you that invite
me to a house party will understand that i am a very INFREQUENT heavy
drug user.  except for pot.  i don't consider that a real heavy drug. 
it's like drinking coffee in my eyes.  

any opionions are welcome.  

love, 

dEEp

i hear the terms dubplates and acetates used interchangeably (i'm sure 
some kind soul will correct me if i'm wrong)...  dubplates are single 
pressings of a track onto a cheaper medium (acetate?), which tends to 
have lower quality and wears out much more rapidly than a regular vinyl 
record.  it's typically around $50 - $60 to press an acetate - it gives 
the dj a chance to drop his/her track into the mix and see how it sounds and 
what sort of crowd response it generates...

btw, does anyone have any places in the bay area that they would 
recommend for pressing acetates?

thanks,
Phil

Hello strangers,

Just wonna tell you that after true love, I have made a couple decisions.
(well, actually not only a couple, but these two are symobolic)

1. From now on, I am the "eboy", you will see my nick on IRC #sfraves.
2. From now on, I am a vegeterian (it's a good vibe isn't it?....:-).

Love,
-Bruce

The compressor/gate option is why I mentioned the Presonus DCP-8 and
the LA Audio MIDI gate. The latter seems the best solution because,
rather than having to produce a sound to generate a gate, it lets you
gate one of the channels direclty via a midi note-on/off. (Seems
like a waste to tie up one instrument just to generate a gate).

I was kind of wondering if anybody knew of a gate like the LA Audio
MIDI gate that was significantly cheaper than the $1200.00 they're 
charging. For one, i don't really need 16 channels of
automation/gating. I mentioned the presonus DCP-8 because it's cheaper
and it has only 8 channels and it also has 8 channels of MIDI
controlled compression, mixing, etc. However, it's not clear whether
you can do gating via MIDI notes directly, as opposed to using an
external trigger (which implies slinging some wires around -- something
i want to avoid).

I think you're smart and I appreciate you expressing your current
situation. 

I'm kinda at the same point. Where I am choosy about when I use
and when I do not use. But mr green jeans is always enviting me down to
the turquoise lounge for an old soul massage. :) I can never deny myself
this pleasure. :)

I've noticed a few of my friends get really into E and it just ruins
things. Basically they NEED it to have fun after a while and don't even
know whose spinning or whose promoting the party, etc. When you need to
take a hit of E to have a good time there's a problem. The vibe alone is
mind blowing in our scene. I went down to la recently and was surprised at
how different things are. The VIBE sucks and the people/crowd is so much
different. THere was no one smiling, sharing things, or even talking to
one another. It seemed like people were trying SO hard to act fucked up
and didn't take the time to relax and absorb the music and surroundings.
Our scene is so wonderful.. and my experience in LA makes it even more
beautiful and meaningful....

     Eboy,
     
     I'm glad that True Love ment something to you. I hope that your 
     intention to change to a non-meat eating lifestyle means more to you 
     than just a VIBE! It's a very important movement, and we need all the 
     real support we can get. I just hope you don't do it to be cool. 
     
     Note: No flame here, just hoping we have a strong believer in the 
     movement. Peace always! <JCO>

Hello strangers,
     
Just wonna tell you that after true love, I have made a couple decisions. 
(well, actually not only a couple, but these two are symobolic)
     
1. From now on, I am the "eboy", you will see my nick on IRC #sfraves. 
2. From now on, I am a vegeterian (it's a good vibe isn't it?....:-).
     
Love,
-Bruce

Okay guys, it is time again to spread the PLUR ity of our scene to the world around us.  Where do we send it this time?? UK baby!!!!

On July 30 (or so, I think) It is Ben' 20th b-day. =) Those of you that have met him, know he his a "splendid" guy.  They (ben and Iris) have been here for about 10 weeks now, and they are leaving very soon.  I think that it would be soooo wonderful if we could send them off with a birthday party filled with PLUR. Just think how much love they could recieve from our scene as they head back home to England.

I was thinking...um...  house party perhaps??? I will be putting something together, so watch for more info.  If anyone has any ideas (i'm new to this sort of thing)please e-mail me privatley. (d.j's, ideas etc.)

Thatnks for you help! 

peace & love,
Julie

Subject: Crash Worship at the Troc
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.org
Precedence: bulk


Well this isn't exactly rave related but...

I had a *blast* at Crash Worship at the Troc last night; it fully
satisified my need for death, destruction, fake blood, and naked
people for the next couple of weeks. The band opened their set by
thrusting themselves into the crowd of happy club goers, whilst the
guitarist sat on stage, squealing away. They had huge Mardi Gras style
masks and large torches, with people blowing kerosene to create huge
burst of flames from their mouths.

The show alternated between an apocalyptic tribal ritual (very Burning
Man-esque), a death punk show, and a display of pure, primal erotic
energy, with red wine, grapes, and syrup poured all over it to cool
things down (or at the very least, to make things nice and
sticky). For the periods of time that band decided to stay on stage,
they had a powerful presence with their many drums, a long bass
guitar-like thing, several keyboards, and a singer that would spend
his time screaming into three pitch shifters. The rest of the cast
consisted of topless dancers, cheerleaders, and people who would just
randomly squirt fluids onto the audience.

I didn't catch them at the rave they played at, but chances are, it was
probably a bad mix. I think the Troc crowd is a little more tolerant of
a band who actively tries to set the audience and the venue on fire. >:)

Anyway, it was my first Crash Worship show after having known about
them for years, and I must have more. And I'm all rev'ed up for
Burning Man now.

Steve

	There was a time when and a place when raves had this energy as
well. There still are, just few and far far between. I am not trying to be
an old grumpy type, but, I miss being able to find raves that as the music
builds, you start dancing harder and then the music plateaus, but for some
reason, something keeps propelling you to dance harder, to squish in with
the crowd and stomp around, and as you dance harder, the person just in
front of you and to your left dances harder too, and it makes you dance
harder and then they dance harder (but they couldn't SEE you dance harder,
so what caused his/her back to arch just a little more and his/her legs
hit the ground just a little harder, and his/her arms find a new way to
move throw the air? All this open room to dance, who needs it ;) Give me a
packed room where everyone is shoulder to shoulder and everyone's sweat
gets smeared all over everyone else....

Seriously, brother, and interestingly enough, to connect this to the club
vs rave discussion from a bit back, I have been finding that this
proximity of bodies all going fucking mental together has been more common
at clubs lately than at underground events.  The one example that
blatantly stands out in my mind was the Carl Cox set at 1015 at the end of
May.  Hundreds of people with no space around them bumping and grinding
each other, but not macking, and unable to muster any thoughts past THIS
DUDE IS GOING NUTS I AM GOING NUTS ALL THESE PEOPLE AROUND ME ARE GOING
OFF THE FUCKING NUTCASE.

OK, real sorry about that.

PAX,
MAX

WOW!  I still have warm-fuzzies from all the love that was in my apartment!
Firstly, bless my neighbors for not complaining at all about the music.  
(Miracles do happen!)  Jelo and Fubari, I have heard you two spin, but never
like you did that night!!  You gave us the best that you had and we went
totallyfreakinutsoid for it. %)  My guests who came from far and wide...I did	it all for you and you can come over and eat, dance and sweat anytime!  	THIS WILL BE HAPPENING AGAIN!  You can never get too much of a running start
on love...

I hope to see more and more and more of you in the future!!

Hi Jody,

Well... either way. I am not doing it to be that kind of cool, but I think
I love this word "cool" because it means so much if you really think about
it.

I have to say thanks to my best friend Pyro because I got the idea after
some chatting with him, he really inspired me a lot. Well...thanks to true
love, I got a best friend in one day......incredible...:)

Jody, my answer is: Yes, I am taking it very seriously.

Love,
-Bruce

Oops, one more thing forgot to say.

Jody, I support the movement. If you guys need any help from me, ask all
what you want. I will do my best.

Actually I think the vibe could be cleaner, Jamie lost her yellow bag which
has her everything in the party. I lost 40 bucks (well could be my fault)
as well. Let's make it clean.

Love,
-Bruce

i can say with certainty that true love was the best party i've ever been
to. the vibe was just amazing.
the wedding was truly cool. i will definetely remeber last saturday night
for the rest of my life. 
i usually spend lots of time dancing at parties, but saturday i found myself
running around
trying to meet all the smiling faces i could. i'd list names of people i
met/hung out with here,
but as bad as my name memory is, it would take all day.
i met a few first time ravers, all of whom just seemed blown away by the
incredible vibe. what a perfect party
to go to for your first.
all the dj's rocked. whoever's sound that was in the dungeon, i just want to
give you props, that's
some of the deepest bass i've ever felt. 
thanx to amber and everyone at her pre-party for making my first time
spinning out such a good
experience.

hugz,
jelo

Hey there!
I think it totally depends on the person.  The parties that I've gone 
to, well have honestly not been too sober, but I am definately planning 
on it for about a month at least.  The drug thing runs in my 
family...lots of f*ck ups but I'm planning on revolutionizing that 
because my brain...wait, what was I saying?  Just kidding, is fine, a 
little sore from True Love.  Originally, to be honest I do kind of think 
that parties would be related to abuse if you do drugs at them for your 
first party  (makes no sense whatsoever, its purely becasue I'm tired 
though, I swear), but people do need to experience them sober...because 
they are fun that way tooooo!
Love Always,
Danny

Mohan, the ULTRA star was supercool and described what one might expect
from Umoja Hi-Fi tonight, and I thought I would come sit on the brown rug
and share with the class.


" They'll be doing drum and bass... the last time they spun at Halloween
Tribal Massive, John Coxon from Spring Heel Jack told me that their set
was one of the most amazing he's seen and heard!"


Holy Shit.  And Abstract is opening for this.  SEE YOU THERE ITCHY foot,

How do you know it's "Jerry" they're listening to in those VW buses, Neils?
Just this weekend someone was talking on the 313 list about this new techno
release that's so subtle that you *have* to put on headphones or stick your
head in the speaker to understand the marvelous whatever being done.

Myself, I always wondered what to do about the hiss on my old high-gen
Grateful Dead tapes.  Now I know: sample it, filter it, loop it, release it . . .

Hello.

Just wanted to jump to the defense of my hometown. Elevation,
Moontribe, Organic, and a hell of a lot of other parties in the last year
or so have been damn good.  Me personally, I find it upsetting sometimes
that we (the list) bash so much on LA.  Those parties are some of the best
I have attended, and I should hope you're not bagging on those.

Parties for the most part seem a tad more hardcore (esp. the UGs) in terms
of how die hard the people going are.  Parties tend to start later and end
later (noon sometimes even further).

If you came to SF, and went to a crappy corporate event, or a bad party in
general, I should hope you wouldn't go back to LA saying the scene here
sucks.... and I'd love to see us return the favor.

Trust me, they DO go off down there from time to time.

Just be prepared to dance more and talk less...

Peace,
AndyW

at my first party i was in an altered state of mind. if i hadn't have been, i
am sure that i would have had a different perception of what raving was about
and what it was like, not necesarily better or worse, but definitley
different. i'd like to say though that you can have great fun at a rave no
matter what state of mind your in. personally, i think just being at a good
party is like being fucked up.

this was a party that reminded me about why i love to rave. i've gone
through some times when i've questioned our scene and when i've questioned
myself for being in it. i won't ever question that again. true love
completely restored my faith and overwhelming love for raving and ravers. it
was definitely a night i will never, ever forget. to all my old friends, all
my new friends, and all those i didn't get a chance to talk to - you all
made my night incredible, you all made the vibe unforgettable - and i love
you all very much. special thanks to amanda and dustin (and congrats!), for
a night i'm sure none of us will soon forget.

love, hugs, and of course, smiles,
cricket :)

To all the customers, friends, and family thet I have met while working 
at the most laidback, awesome, and friend-oriented coffee shop in the 
world,
  This morning I was woken up by my pager which I had left next to my 
brain just in case I had to work this morning.  Yup,  It was my last, 
very last shift at City Espresso in Santa Clara.  This job was the ONLY 
job I have ever thoroughly enjoyed.  Not because the work was easy but 
you, the customers and friends I met by working here made it fun and 
enjoyable for everyone.  
   Another groovy thing  (I know the word is entirely overused these 
days  :)  I would not give any credit to anyone but the City crew and 
the big Ol' Grumpy raver Matt  :), Andy W, Keri, Lee, Alex, Jen, Jay, 
Vlad, Allegra,Noah...You guys all kick ass!!! All you great faces that 
come to Slow Roasted every wednesday,,well you kick bootie too!  I'm 
going to miss all of you, well I'll still probably be in every day until 
I get my act together but who knows how long that will be  :)   
Michelle, I can no longer flirt with her for hours on end and all the 
othe cool customers that don't gimme shit from spittin' in their drinks  
J/k  :) I've never done that and have never been tempted to because 
1)bad karma, 2)I respect my cutomers too much, even Miles 3)It is gross, 
4)tips are usually lower  :)  5) Do unto others as you'd want done to 
you!!!!! (I think that is kinda how it goes)
I will never forget any of you beautiful people.  Stay Rad, loving and 
willing to take anyone with a smile into your arms.

I Love You All Very Much and please don't be afraid to stay in touch  :)

 Always, Forever,
 Danny Picard

Guys just a little help needed. Jamie Jones, a friend to most of us, lost her
yellow bag at True Love. It was a plastic material backpack sorta thing that
had a lot of everything in it. It also had her ID in it. If anyone has ANY
info on that, she would be very much grateful. Thank you thank you in
advance.

I gave away my quota of free tapes at 'True Love' and Abduction Productions 
says I need to let people know where to get them so here you go:

The tapes are currently available at Dr. Freecloud's Mixing Lab in Costa 
Mesa (www.drfreeclouds.com).

I swapped a few out for copies of Sprung that didn't move.  When I got 
there, my tapes were kinds low in the racks, so I requested that they be 
moved up a little.  I said I didn't mind being kinda low, but I wanted to 
be at least higher than JBondy.

Copies will be moving out to other stores this week and I'll let you know 
when they've been distributed.  :)

thanks.

As a member of the SoCal scene I feel a need to pipe up here too.  There 
are a lot of really good, quality events down here.  You just have to be 
in the know to find them on a consistent basis.  SoCal Raves does a 
really good job of helping people find the good stuff.  

I agree, Moontribes are fun, Elevation2 was possibly the best rave I've 
ever been to (and I'm spinning at Elevation3... :D  ), the house parties 
and BBQs have all been so fully of positive energy and happiness that 
it's hard to describe.

Yeah, so maybe that Go Ventures party you went to wasn't so great.  Or 
maybe you wound up at Blitzkreig with me when it got busted up at like 
midnight, but for every event that gets busted or is too corporate, there 
are four or five others that might even be so UG as to have only 15-20 
people, but they went off like crazy.

I think that in SoCal there is a real quantity issue.  There are _so_ 
many events to choose from that it's hard to know what's going to be good 
or not.

Now, here's where I let my Socialist agenda poke through:
The real problem I see in SoCal is that there are a lot of 
business-persons in the scene.  Too many promoters looking to turn a 
profit, too many DJs looking to turn a profit, and too many possibly 
non-rave friendly space-owners looking to turn a profit.  And this 
results in kids running around desperate to be at 'the right party' at 
'the right location' and you wind up with problems like Double Hit Mickey 
and stuff like that.  I feel that the SF scene has an edge here because I 
see more promoters, DJs and ravers who are in it for the music and the 
vibe.  I'm not syaing this doesn't exist in SoCal... it's just masked 
under a lot of profit-hunting.  Chances are you'll get a flyer for some 
massive corporate thing and not for a backyard BBQ, ya know what I mean?

So that's my take on SoCal vs. SF.  Is one better than the other?  Nope.  
It's just different. :)

Well I helped setup and I feel as if I had been with all the planning sence
the beggining.  Well all I can say is that when I arrived at the space at
2:00p.m. saturday I knew the minute I walked in there the party awas going
to go off.  It was soo incrediably positive, and the energy, coming not
only
from the people there, but the building as well, into the top floor was
soooo
overwhelming it almost knocked me over.  I knew  we were not going to
have any major problems with the party getting broken up.  When the party
first got
started and people started showing up, the energy from 2:00p.m. just
escalated all night long, the a huge escalater with no ending.  I was
outside most of the night working the door,  anyone who I offened at the
party by being really rude by having people move out of the door way I am
so sorry, I hope you can understand where I was coming from.  Anyway after
the police said turn off the music at, WHAT TIME,  6:30a.m., hello the
party was
almost over, but he didn't break up the party we just had to turn off all
the
music.  Well after about an hour the music got started going agian, and
everyone was really happy.  I talked with a lot of poeple there and all I
heard from everyone was, This is an incredible party, it has changed my
life forever,  it made me see myself in a new way,  anyway I am sure you
all get the point.  Again I am sooo glad everyone came out in support for
Amanda and Dustin, you know I love you GUYS WAY WAY TOO MUCH!!!!, as well
for the Kalediscope CrEw.  I hope everyone keeps the vibe from this party
GOING and GOING to every party you may attented to.    Thanks again 

Eric

Hi groovy SF people, this is Ken here from Pure Acid Mixtapes in L.A...

	Anyway, for those cool people who are heading to JUGGERNAUT this
weekend, we're making the road trip up to set up the Pure Acid Mixtapes
booth, as the lineup looks like something I can't pass up!

	If you've never heard of us, we are rave vendors with the largest
selection of DJ mixtapes in the U.S. (over 500 tapes to choose from). 
We also sell $1 glowsticks, cool toy necklaces, and lots of other neat-o
stuff!  If anyone would like to see a picture of our booth (in .jpg
format), e-mail us privately and I'll send it to you.
If you went to Burning Man last year, we had a booth there too.

	Looking forward to meeting new people in SF, and checking out Jack
Dangers, System 7, and all the others on that phat lineup!  SEE YOU
THERE! :)

Hey Everybody!!!!!!

Wow! what a weekend hunh!?! Well, true love was undescribably incrediable!
The love and vibe was by far the best i have ever experenced!! My cheeks are
still sore from smiling so much!!(anybody know how to give a cheek massage?)
 I finally got the oppertunity to put some faces on these screen names and
boy were they cute!!!  

I, being the curious kiddo i am, just had to stop by 7-11 on my way to the
city just to pick up my very own can of Red Bull. Geez that stuff tastes
weird!! Its like fizzy sour blo-pop juice :o  I don't know if it effected
me...maybe it still hasn't kicked in yet :o) 

I hope i was lucky enough to give everbody a lil red button, and if you
didn't get one i'll be back down soon to give one to you with a big hug to
follow!  

When i came home on sundae i was still smiling as i drove my 3 hour drive
thruogh the heat of the bay back home to Reno, and as my car trudged over the
seirras thunder and lightenig tore through the sky...i can honestly say it
was one of the most beautiful displays of nature ever. The trees the rain the
lightening and thunder it was amazing...kinda like the wedding...Lara your
speech was breathtaking and the emotion in your voice as you read it made it
so much more powerful! you are truely beautiful and Amanda and Dustin are
lucky to have a friend such as you :o)  Amanda and Dustin...i hope all your
dreams come true and you live happily ever after!

And for all the kids i met...why is it that SFRavers are so damn cute? its a
fact, you are all perfect! Gosh i never got so many yummy hugs from such cute
kidz in my life!! i hope to see you all really soon!! 

Also Hot August Nites is gunna be in reno really really soon and i don't know
if any of you are into cars but if your gunna be up here lemme know so we can
play!!!!

You all take care...be good to each other...stay cute as always!!
...lots of all that stuff that makes you smile...
PLUR
JiL   aka Cheerio :o)

P.S. really...i wasn't hot in that vest :o)

Wow.

Ok ok...I know everyone has said it...but I gotta have my turn...TRUE LOVE
WAS INCREDIBLE. I've never felt so absolutely in phase with collective
happiness. I think some of my synapses have been rerouted.

So I have an excuse to be a little mushy...but it's not just me. A *very*
special friend visited me this weekend, true love was her first rave. She
was nervous at first, but the transformation was incredible. Krista picked
it up right away, and is still talking about how much fun she had.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to her, and my, night...beth, fubari,
jelo, ed, shua, valentine, pablo, dia, nick, becca, amber, rubilicious, ...
phew ... julie, eric, elizabeth, shannon, everyone I whose name I forgot,
everyone who I didn't meet but emanated good vibe, and of course the
newlyweds! what a way to kick off a new adventure.

Again I say, you kids are swell.

/justin

ps...who gave a beautiful girl their sfraves laminate?

reviews. i'm not subscribed at the moment but would really like to

here. we'll be proudly wearing our new sfraves laminates at raves in
england soon.

true love was wonderful. and it is great that we know *so* many people
here now. we really enjoyed being part of the sfrave family for a
while.

 Last year was just wrong. It was not at all a festival. I am pretty sure
the cops made it that way. They were cracking down on the location, just
the week before the last Juggernaut. And the location was pretty much rank
anyways. The Bue, Iron Factory. People liked to piss on the walls inside
the building.
 The party was broken up into to little sections. When I got there only one
room was going off. But it was more like a tiny hallway. With these stairs
on both sides, that went up to nowhere. That room started sounding like 5
in da morning music around midnight.
 Then some DJ came on out side that   -tore- -it- up-    for about a half
an hour.
 There was another room discovered around 2AM. Didn't open up tell about 3.
That was the Iron factory it's self. That room was pumping at three. You
could tell all the DJ's were hyped up from waiting while the room took
shape.  Because no one was in there most of the night dancing, I guess
someone felt alittle chilly and desided to set the inside of a garbage can
on fire. Inside the building. Turns out the can was filled with alot of
plastic materials. There ended up being this really nasty cloud of gasious
polymer chemicals floating around.
 Really hard to breath.
 But. To answer your question. Spacechildren ravErs are defonetly bomb ass.

Hey you house freaks!  I just heard this DOPE house track on a tapa and was
wondering if anyone might know it from the vocal..

It's a chicago style rythm with a female vocal like...

I love the wa-I know,

I love the wa-I know,

I love the wa-I know,

I love the way you make me feel

The last part is sung...

It's on the mixed tape by Steve Loria "Live at the Moon"  by the people

Also on the same tape is another song but it's not as emotional as the last
one I [attempted to] described...

It has another distinctive house/disco chicage style beat with a piano riff
and an organ solo(played to a snare and bass beat)  It has a male vocal:

My forbiden lover

She's my forbiden lover

I love these songs and would enjoy having them in my collection.
Any help is appreciated.  Thanks alot in advance!

bye

Hey folx=)

	ya ya, I'm a new one here... kinda new to the scene inna way. Guess you
could call me a recycled rave virgin... well, not quite. I'm kinda at
the horns of a little dilemma bull. I used ta party back in the day,
then I got put in a treatment center, my folx thought I was going a wee
bit overboard with drug usage <they were right> so I stopped partyin for
3 years. then, about 6 months ago, I got bored with the AA/recovery
scene and started partyin again, but it seems like the peoples I was
around back in the day either disappeared or the way they use drugs <and
their vibe> scares me. At the same time, the people I was hanging out
with in AA kinda ditched me <their attitude being along the lines of
'oh... you've become one of 'them' again... we can't hang out with you
if you're going to be doing what 'they' do but if you want to do what we
do, come back... unfortunatly, in my eyes, what the AA ppls do seems
rather boring and umm... enough whinin, I'll leave it at that> so I'm
kinda caught in the middle, I want to get back into the scene, start
feelin that luscious vibe and being happy with it again, but lessee,
where am I going with this... I need help getting back there, and I was
hopin and wonderin if ya'll'd help me with that.

my name's hikaru<if ya don't wanna wrestle with pronouncin that, call me
mickey, most ppl do=) > I'm in Berkeley, and umm.... I dunno

				if u could help, muchas gracias=)
ps o yeah, if I'm not supposed to have put this kinda msg out there,
lemme know=)

well, i know this is totally off the subject, but i figure a few people 
could use this info:

i havent seen this reported in the news yet, but for those who dont know 
the contract for UPS and the Teamsters is up on thursday, 11:59pm.  so 
far UPS hasnt agreed to anything that the union wants, and the union 
hasnt agreed to anything UPS wants for the new contract.  so what that 
means is that there might be a strike on friday 12:01am.  for those that 
do shipping with UPS i would sudjest to use another company during this 
week, such as AirBorn Express (union company), until things get back to 
normal. this could be UPS playing high stakes poker and will hold out 
until 11:59 and then agree to what the union wants, but i highly doubt 
it. if you want more info, email me. 

thanks for your time.

Yeah-

Dubplates are the masters that vinyl pressings are cut from. In the
UK, there is a 'culture' of dubplates surrounding the d'nb scene.
Producers cut their tracks and give them to their friends, or popular
dj's who will A) test it for crowd reaction, and B) build anticipation
for the track so that if and when it is pressed it will sell well.

Often times tunes will be on plate for as long as a year before being
pressed. Sometimes they never come out at all, as is the case with
many V.I.P. mixes.

I've called around to several record pressing plants, and noone in the
Bay Area I've found will press them individually (without a vinyl
pressing) but there are several places in that I know of in NY and L.A.

I and other BnB crew will be at Slow Roasted to listen to Audio Electronic
from ProtoLab playing live from  8pm till 10pm at City Espresso,  5237
Stevens Creek blvd, Santa Clara. 408.248.4500.

So come and enjoy some great music and people. And while your there you can
pick up a ticket for the  BBQ & BEATS Campout. Remember, there are two
different tickets. One is for people bringing there own food, which are
free. If you can make any kind of donation to help cover cost that would be
great but not required. There also will be tickets for those that want to
eat the food we are bringing, and those are $10.

Hope to see as many of you there tomorrow as possible!!

If you need tickets and can't get to the South Bay, please let me know and
I can arrange a way to get them to you.

Take care,

I've had a couple questions about dubplates, so if you are interested
in them, check out http://www.mindspring.com/~brydaguy/scene.html for
a detailed historical look at them. Pretty cool. To know where you're
goin, you gotta know where you started:)

Yup -- good track.  It's called "The Way" on F-Communications.  It's been out for a while now, I'm not sure if I've seen it around.

Hi everyone!! I heard that the whole Wicked crew ( Jeno, Garth etc.), were
going to be at Lollapalooza this August! Can anyone tell me if this is true?
If it is that would be cool since I get to go for FREE! When I heard that
they might be there I didn't think that it was true. It didn't seem right to
have Snoop Dogg playing with Jeno.
  Anyways if someone knows for sure, please let me know!!

there's also a global communications track that's on the deep house tip, 
with something like "i love you ilove you iloveyou ilove the way you make me 
feel" - extremely beautiful track...  this might be the track - very very 
deep and emotional (well, one mix is, the other is lighter...) There are 
at least two 12"s with different mixes...

btw, what's the group that put out "the way"?

thanks,
Phil

Err -  Yeah, that's the track I ment.  Global Communications, 
 F-Communications...who can keep 'em all straight??? ;-)  I think one side 
is called "The Way" and the other is called "The Deep"???

Hello there,
My dad has been with UPS for almost twenty years now and he was telling 
me the same stuff except that he really doesn't think that it will 
happen.  "What they wanted to do was to give us a .90 cent raise every 
other year, that's bullshit! I've been working here too damn long and 
hard to be shafted like this, I really think they'll (the teamsters 
Union) just try to negotiate.  but on the bright side, I'll be .90 
richer in the year 2000."  But sometimes everyone, even father doesn't 
know best.  Good luck to the Teamsters and UPS dudes, even you Dad   :)

Peace,
Baby Huey

PS apparently the union reps at the San Jose station took a poll to see 
if they can "recognize" a strike.  Out of 830 people, 14 voted "no"  "I 
would like to know what the f*ck those 14 people were thinking."--Pops 
Huey

CFE - Call for Entries for the Cloud Factory's new newsletter - Skyy Times

        ----------------------------------------------------------

   The Cloud Factory, a collective non-profit group based in the Monterey
Bay Area is starting a newsletter.  We are making a call for entries from
several of the communities where we feel we have roots.  This includes
the SF Bay Area, the whole West Coast rave scene and small roots in many
other places.

   The newsletter will contain several focus areas.  They include, DJ
interviews, DJ top tens, Poetry, Vegan and Vegetarian Recipes,
Environmental Updates (protest dates, places to write or email, etc.),
Inspirational Propaganda, Letters to the Editor, Upcoming Events,
Horoscopes, and Ask Mutor...(questions about sound and sound systems).  We
will be accepting entries in any and all of the focus areas.  We will also
be accepting entries for our newsletter logo and opening graphic, as well
as photography or original artwork.

   We have a core group of people who will be helping to contribute
material, edit entries and submissions and design layout.  If you have any
journalism experience or have had experience with small zines/newsletters
before, we'd love to hear comments you have, experiences, do/don'ts and
any other advice you might have for us.  Currently we plan to release a new
newsletter each quarter and have a circulation of 1500 to start with.

   Please submit text in a plain text file format, Microsoft Word, or via
an email message.  Please submit graphics in any common graphic format
(i.e. pict, tiff, jpeg, gif), EPS graphics of line art would be preferred.

   If you are interested in more information about the Cloud Factory
please see our home page at http://www.cloudfactory.org/, it's a bit
outdated but that's on our list to update too.

   Submissions can be sent to info@cloudfactory.org or submit@cloudfactory.org

Thank you

Scott Nelson
drenalin@cloudfactory.org

Please forward this email to any appropriate lists or friends that might
be interested in contributing to an exciting new newsletter.

In reality my friend, yes, it was bad judgement to send this to SFRaves,
but since I'm a supervisor for Corp. Dist. here at Cadence Design Systems
it was a very informational note to me!

So please be respectful on the list, but I'd also like to thank the person
who sent it at the same time.  =)  Just don't let it happen again..... ;)

Hmmm.,

 What kind of moves was she doing?
 Did she look like she was doing some 80's strutting, with a little
moonwalk strafing?

 I myself, like it when girls dance in a sexy sorta fashion. And to be
honest, I don't see many girls dancing sexy in our scene. I mean. I see
alot of really good dancers. But they don't hypnotize me with seductive
moves. Why is that?
 Anyways. Was she short /w black hair?


Alrighty.

I remember in 95', the song "The Way" by J Daniel.... that one?

This year's "The Way" is a good look your rave mate at 3am in the morning, while you're giving him/her an e-massage rekkid, and say, "I love the way you make me feel" :-}

Hello!

I'd like to thank Amanda and Dustin for sharing their love to the rest of
us.  I only personally met Amanda, but I'll get to meet you one day Dustin!
=) 

Thanks to Lara for having me spin.  It was a great pleasure to contribute
to this wonderful event...You looked great during the ceremony and your
speech was so emotional and meaningful.

Amber and I had such a great time together.  The vibe was so loving. =)
Everyone was in such good spirits.  While Amber and I were watching the
ceremony we just kept thinking "What a great
way to share this memorable moment with everyone".  This event is
definitely one that we'll remember for ever.

Hello to everyone that Amber and I met that night!  

Take care,

Noah(aka:siphon) & Amber =)

I just thought that I would come right out and say that the following post
made me laugh.  I attribute that to the fact that complaining in public,
to all the members of the list, that something was off-topic, is even more
off-topic than the original post.

I would also like to mention that I am sponsoring a contest to see how out
of line this string can get.  Thank you.

Your pal,
MAX

Hello-

This is going out to the fellow dj's I talked to while at true love, plus
anyone else that's interested.  I have several email lists for new releases
which you might be interested in.  If you are please email me privately and
I'll give you the info.

	Hi. It's late and all, but I just want to say thanks to everyone who
showed up for tru luv, and that I felt it was a priveledge to help make it
happen. Also, thanks to all the DJ's who spun, and especially thanks to those
of you who spun upstairs for being so cool about letting me jam with you - I've
had lots of negative experiences around that kind of thing, but you all were
completely excellent and non-ego-tripping about it. Although my own set got cut
a bit short, that experienc totally makes up for it.

	It was great to meet so many of you from the list, you know who you are.
	I imagine my crazy biker-looking friend Chuck will have some good photos
available soon. If anybody wants to scan them & put them up on the net, let me 
know. More on this to follow ...

	I've just got to say that I've never heard anyone spin breakbeat like
Noah before. Incredible.

	Peace, Love, & Grooviness to You,

	Rob

Hey, thanks for the heads up, my company uses UPS extensively.  For some
reason the potential strike isn't in the news yet, so your warning is
doubly appreciated.  Also, thanks for using the NRR header, this list has
shied away from properly tagging messages lately.

Amen!! :)  I think that guy needs to look the word up in the dictionary 
or something because to me, If I ever meet him I might step out of the 
whole plur thing and teach him about respect.  He really did not have to 
read the email nor did he have to WASTE his time by writing that sh*tty 
comment.  The UPS thing involves a lot of people ie. my father, and 
obviously you and he should learn how to respect that a little bit more, 
Take it Easy,

HI Everyone, I hope everyone is having a wonderful day.
I am here...at work, waiting to go home finally...

I'm kinda lonely :( buts its ok, I have Ganesha to 
keep me company when I get home. (Ganesha is a stuffed
elephant I sleep with) :)

Last night I experienced the most beautiful thing,

I received an electronic postcard from a girl I met
at TRUE LOVE, her name was Brandi :) (Hi Brandi!!!)
it made me feel very very very special :) and it made
me cry :(

I dunno, I felt loved :) 
I wish I could feel like that everday...
but its hard... sometimes people forget about us happy people :(

everyone always sees me happy...I think people take it for granted :(
I'm sad :( but I'm happy to be sad...I'm just lonely, all my friends
are behind a computer screen and I only get to see them once a week.

I just miss you all, I wish I could hear your voices more often...

Have a wonderful day...
{*huggles*}
Pablito :(

For anyone that went to True Love there were two Noahs spin'n that night!

Me(noah)aka(siphon) @  9:00pm I played Drum & Bass and breakbeat.

Then there was...

Uncle Noah @ around 12:30pm or something!  What time did you play Uncle Noah?

There seems to be a bit of confusion with some personal replies back to me
after my review of True Love!  Just thought I'd clarify that!

Thanks again!

to be cool. We spoke at length about many things, and the meat thing was

Ahhh mr. Green Jeans! The two of us have been close confidants for quite some
time, and I'd have to say that without his help I'd be a lost soul by now.
But I have decided, and this came to me just today, with the help of a really
wonderful girl, that I can no longer accompany him to his palace. After four
years of hard core smokin' and tokin' I have made the decision that I am
ready to leave his gaurdian wings, and move on to a more spiritual place of
my own. Though, I must admit that this place has been built by the strong
arms of many many good friends, and a longing of change. Someday, I hope to
be reunited, under different circumstances, with my dear friend Mr. Green
Jeans, and chat on the same level, instead of me being the student, and he
the teacher. Please help me in witnessing this major change in my life. I
think of all of you as my friends as well, friends that helped me build my
sanctuary of love, life and happiness.......

I was on 4.30am - 6am, preceding Rob Rayle.  I was the guy with the

I don't think this is a waste of time... as a person who depends on UPS
almost every day to deliver the latest kikkin' vinyl recordings, (ie
records), I appriciate very much this info.  Without it we might not get any
new records in the store this week!!!  Then the SF ravester would have to
dance to the same tunes they heard last week! AAHH!! (personally I think
there is enough good music out there already to play back to back for at
least a week without ever hearing anything twice, but the addiction to new
vinyl is a hard one to break.)  I'll go with another shipper until this
shindig is over... Thanx.
(And why would someone get pissed off at this, maybe slightly annoyed ???)

I think it's going to be in the same warehouse the gathering, analog and
area 51 was at. It's the only 1 big enough (dirty enough) to be in.
Well it's not that dirty now, area51 was ok... But it's BIG!!! I love
the space, I love dancing at that warehouse.
Anyway, hope to see you there, just look for 2 glowsticks and a phaty
smile.

awwwwww, poor guy. you had to spend 1.5 seconds for pressing the delete 
key.  maybe the person who posted that ups thing should give you a 
public apology for his terrible crime.

ps. the subject says NRR. if you don't have time in your busy schedule 
to read a message that isn't up to your rave-related standards then 
ignore it.

	I'm coming out to SF from Detroit for the weekend of the 16th and 17th. 
 I'm wondering if anyone can give me a few suggestions for parties or clubs 
for those dates... I heard about a big beach party that Saturday night. 
 True?

Thanks!!!

HI everyone, just here listening to UNCLE NOAH's ARK II mixtape
I really really enjoyed this one :) very very much...there is a
track at the end of Side II, which I believe to be BEAUTIFUL! 

Uncle Noah, where did you find such wonderful piece? :)

its amazing.... its more of a jungle type thing, but its amazing...
Its got a some string arrangments..... violins, and a beautiful
piano sample....its BEAUTIFUL. I really really like it since
I'm a composer myself, I love pianos :P hehehe :) its amazing...

and the whale sounds in the begining and the end of Side1 give it a
magestic feeling of animals acutally going into Noah's Ark :) I dunno
I have to say... this MIX TAPE really took me on a Trip to a beautiful
place, another world another lifetime...

Noah, THANK you soooo much! :)

Stop Pablito!!!  People are going to realize that I slipped you $20 to post 
that stuff! :D

The track of which you speak is "Music for the Lonely" by Jamie Myerson 
and is taken from the Nu Emotions EP on sm:)e (1996 SM-9040-0 for you 
trainspotters out there)

The whole EP is pretty fun.  It's on white vinyl and has tracks by Sub 
Zero, DJ DB and Tommy-D and Jason Mouse as well.  If you like D&B, this 
one fits the bill.  Good stuff for warm evenings and nice sunset kinda 
times :)

Thanks a lot for sharing that. That was really cool.

I think I will be at the same point one day in the next couple of
months.... when hopefully some one I've been dreaming of walks through my

Speaking of mr green jeans.... he's on my back right now... so I gotta go!

That guy just happened to be on the receiving end of my periodic blasting of
NRR peeple. His post happened to be the lamest NRR post I have seen in ~7
years. My response is directed at all the NRR peeple. I'll never win but I
can keep trying. I'll go back into hibernation now.

 I hope this gets to you before you leave.  Sorry it's so late, but I
just got home and checked my e-mails.  As for what to bring, there is a
checklist of things to bring on the BBQ & Beats web site
<http://www.bbq-beats.org>.  The checklist is pretty extensive, but I'm
sure you'll be fine if you don't bring some of that stuff all the way
out from Florida.  You can buy some of the necessities like water,
sunscreen, etc here in the Bay Area, and some of the bigger things might
be easily borrowed..  After all, a lot of those things other people will
have and the types of people that go to these events are ones that are
more than happy to share.  I'm one of them.  I'll put the word out for
people to bring extras of things (i.e. tents, lanterns, etc.), but I'm
sure quite a few will be overprepared anyway.  Don't let the
extensiveness of the list keep you from going.  If you don't check
e-mails once you're here, you're welcome to continue corresponding by
calling me at (209) 984-3918 or (209) 984-5151.
    With regards to the rave fashion posts, I must say that we are
definitely not preoccupied with looking like a real raver.  There is no
single definition of a real raver.  We are all real ravers and we dress
as we like to.  Some ravers are preoccupied with how they dress/look,
but that isn't always going along the lines of a rave-trendy fashion,
just doing their best at their own personal style.  I said rave-trendy,
but it seems that every type of fashion is represented at parties/clubs
here.  Some people choose some more predominant styles, but really I see
an extreme mixture of personal styles more than anything.  We don't look
at ravers who wear more predominant styles as "cooler" or more of a
"real raver."  There's my 2 cents, as I'm sure is shared by many here...

     For all of you on SFRaves, I posted this to the list as well in the
hopes that you all will be most welcoming (as in the case of Ben and
Iris) to these two who are coming all the way out from Florida to visit
us.  And if you are going to be at the BBQ & Beats campout, could you
please bring extras of things if at all possible?  Please e-mail them to
let them know if you can help out in any way.  Or if you'd like, you can
e-mail me.  Anyways, hope everyone is having a wonderful week!  Be kind
and respectful to those around you.  Oh, and I have another quote down
below.
                                       Love,
                                           Julie Mae
                                      (a.k.a. SmileGrl1)
Thought for the Day:  The search for knowledge is always the correct
path to take.  It is something that, once acquired, can only add to your
spirit and beauty.  Knowledge is indeed a powerful tool and knowledge of
self is the ultimate power."

 There are so many Star Trek(tm) spin-offs that it is easy to fool 
 yourself into thinking that the Star Trek vision is an accurate vision 
 of the future. Sadly, Star Trek does not take into account the 
 stupidity, selfishness, and horniness of the average human being.  Allow 
 me to describe some of the more obvious errors in the Star Trek vision.
      
 Medical Technology
 ------------------
 On Star Trek, the doctors have handheld devices that instantly close 
 any openings in the skin. Imagine that sort of device in the hands
 of your unscrupulous friends. They would sneak up behind you and seal 
 your ass shut as a practical joke. The devices would be sold in novelty 
 stores instead of medical outlets. All things considered, I'm happy 
 that it's not easy to close other people's orifices.
      
 Transporter
 -----------
 It would be great to be able to beam your molecules across space and 
 then reassemble them. The only problem is that you have to trust your 
 co-worker to operate the transporter. These are the same people who 
 won't add paper to the photocopier or make a new pot of coffee after 
 taking the last drop. I don't think they'll be double-checking the 
 transporter coordinates. They'll be accidentally beaming people into 
 walls, pets, and furniture. People will spend all their time 
 apologizing for having inanimate objects protruding from parts of their 
 bodies.
      
 'Pay no attention to the knickknacks; I got beamed into a hutch
  yesterday.'
      
 If I could beam things from one place to another, I'd never leave the 
 house. I'd sit in a big comfy chair and just start beaming groceries, 
 stereo equipment, cheerleaders, and anything else I wanted right into my 
 house. I'm fairly certain I would abuse this power. If anybody came to 
 arrest me, I'd beam them into space. If I wanted some paintings for my 
 walls, I'd beam the contents of the Louvre over to my place, pick out 
 the good stuff, and beam the rest into my neighbor's garage.
      
      
 If I were watching the news on television and didn't like what
 I heard, I would beam the anchorman into my living room during the 
 commercial break, give him a vicious wedgie, and beam him back 
 before anybody noticed. I'd never worry about 'keeping up with
 the Joneses,' because as soon as they got something nice, it 
 would disappear right out of their hands. My neighbors would have 
 to use milk crates for furniture. And that's only after I had all 
 the milk crates I would ever need for the rest of my life. 
 There's only one thing that could keep me from spending all my 
 time wreaking havoc with the transporter: the holodeck.
      
 Holodeck
 --------
 For those of you who only watched the 'old' Star Trek, the holodeck can 
 create simulated worlds that look and feel just like the real thing. The 
 characters on Star Trek use the holodeck for recreation during breaks 
 from work. This is somewhat unrealistic. If I had a holodeck, I'd close 
 the door and never come out until I died of exhaustion. It would be hard 
 to convince me I should be anywhere but in the holodeck, getting my oil 
 massage from Cindy Crawford and her simulated twin sister.
      
 Holodecks would be very addicting. If there weren't enough holodecks to 
 go around, I'd get the names of all the people who had reservations 
 ahead of me and beam them into concrete walls. I'd feel tense about
 it, but that's exactly why I'd need a massage.
      
 I'm afraid the holodeck will be society's last invention.
      
 Sex with Aliens
 ---------------
      
 According to Star Trek, there are many alien races populated with 
 creatures who would like to have sex with humans.
 This would open up a lot of anatomical possibilities, but imagine 
 the confusion. It's hard enough to have sex with human beings, 
 much less humanoids. One wrong move and you're suddenly 
 transported naked to the Gamma Quadrant to stand trial for 
 who-knows-what. This could only add to performance anxiety. You 
 would never be quite sure what moves would be sensual and what 
 moves would be a galactic-sized mistake.
      
         Me Trying to Have Sex with an Alien
         -----------------------------------
      
         Me:      May I touch that?
      
         Alien:  That is not an erogenous zone. It is a
                 separate corporeal being that has been 
                 attached to my body for six hundred years.
      
         Me:     It's cute. I wonder if it would let me
                 have sex with it.
      
         Alien:  That's exactly what I said six hundred
                 years ago.
      
 The best part about having sex with aliens, according to the Star Trek 
 model, is that the alien always dies a tragic death soon afterward. I 
 don't have to tell you how many problems that would solve. 
 Realistically, the future won't be that convenient.
      
 Phasers
 -------
 I would love to have a device that would stun people into 
 unconsciousness without killing them. I would use it ten times 
 a day. If I got bad service at the convenience store, I'd
 zap the clerk. If somebody with big hair sat in front of me 
 at the theater, zap!
      
 On Star Trek, there are no penalties for stunning people with phasers. 
 It happens all the time. All you have to do is claim you were possessed 
 by an alien entity. Apparently, that is viewed as a credible defense in 
 the Star Trek future. Imagine real criminals in a world where the 'alien 
 possession' defense is credible.
      
 Criminal:  Yes, officer, I did steal that vehicle, and
            I did kill the occupants, but I was possessed 
            by an evil alien entity.
      
 Officer:         Well, okay. Move along.
      
 I wish I had a phaser right now. My neighbor's dog likes to 
 stand under my bedroom window on the other side of the fence 
 and bark for hours at a time. My neighbor has employed the bold 
 defense that he believes it might be another neighbor's dog, 
 despite the fact that I am standing there looking at him 
 barking only twenty feet away. In a situation like this, a 
 phaser is really the best approach. I could squeeze off a clean 
 shot through the willow tree. A phaser doesn't make much noise, 
 so it wouldn't disturb anyone. Then the unhappy little dog and 
 I could both get some sleep. If the neighbor complains, I'll 
 explain that the phaser was fired by the other neighbor's dog, 
 a known troublemaker who is said to be invisible.
      
 And if that doesn't work, a photon torpedo is clearly indicated.
      
 Cyborgs
 -------
 Given the choice, I would rather be a cyborg instead of 100 percent 
 human. I like the thought of technology becoming part of my body. As a 
 human, I am constantly running to the toolbox in my garage to get a tool 
 to deal with some new household malfunction. If I were a cyborg, I might 
 have an electric drill on my arm, plus a metric socket set. That would 
 save a lot of trips. From what I've seen, the cyborg concept is a 
 modular design, so you can add whatever tools you think you'd use most.
      
 I'd love to see crosshairs appear in my viewfinder every time I looked 
 at someone. It would make me feel menacing, and I'd like that. I'd 
 program myself so that anytime I saw a car salesman, a little message 
 would appear in my viewfinder that said 'Target Locked On.'
      
 It would also be great to have my computer built into my skull. That way 
 I could surf the Net during useless periods of life, such as when people 
 talk to me. All I'd have to do is initiate a head-nodding subroutine 
 during boring conversations and I could amuse myself in my head all day 
 long.
      
 I think that if anyone could become a cyborg, there would be a huge rush 
 of people getting in line for the conversion. Kids would like it for the 
 look. Adults would like it for its utility. Cyborg technology has 
 something for everyone. So, unlike Star Trek, I can imagine everyone 
 wanting to be a cyborg.
      
 The only downside I can see is that when the human part dies and you're 
 at the funeral, the cyborg part will try to claw its way out of the 
 casket and slay all the mourners. But that risk can be minimized by 
 saying you have an important business meeting, so you can't make it to 
 the service.
      
 Shields
 -------
 I wish I had an invisible force field. I'd use it all the time, 
 especially around people who spit when they talk or get too close to my 
 personal space. In fact, I'd probably need a shield quite a bit if I 
 also had a phaser to play with.
      
 I wouldn't need a big shield system like the one they use to protect the 
 Enterprise, maybe just a belt-clip device for personal use. I could 
 insult dangerous people without fear of retribution. Whatever crumbs
 of personality I now have would be completely unnecessary in the future. 
 On the plus side, it would make shopping much more fun.
      
              Shopping with Shields Up
              ------------------------
      
      
          Me:          Ring this up for me, you
                       unpleasant cretin.
      
          Saleswoman:  I oughta slug you!
      
          Me:          Try it. My shields are up.
      
          Saleswoman:  Damn!
      
          Me:          There's nothing you can do to
                       harm me.
      
          Saleswoman:  I guess you're right. Would you like
                       to open a charge account? Our interest 
                       rates are very reasonable.
      
          Me:          Nice try.
      
      
 Long-Range Sensors
 ------------------
 If people had long-range sensors, they would rarely use them to scan for 
 new signs of life. I think they would use them to avoid work. You could 
 run a continuous scan for your boss and then quickly transport yourself 
 out of the area when he came near. If your manager died in his office, 
 you would know minutes before the authorities discovered him, and that 
 means extra break time.
      
 Vulcan Death Grip
 -----------------
 Before all you Trekkies write to correct me, I know there is no such 
 thing as a Vulcan Death Grip even in Star Trek. But I wish there were. 
 That would have come in handy many times. It would be easy to make the 
 Vulcan Death Grip look like an accident.
      
 'I was just straightening his collar and he collapsed.'
      
 I think the only thing that keeps most people from randomly killing 
 other citizens is the bloody mess it makes and the high likelihood of 
 getting caught. With the Vulcan Death Grip, it would be clean and 
 virtually undetectable. Everybody would be killing people left and 
 right. You wouldn't be able to have a decent conversation at the office 
 over the sound of dead co-workers hitting the carpet. The most common 
 sounds in corporate America would be, 'I'm sorry I couldn't give you a 
 bigger raise, but . . . erk!'
      
 And that's why the future won't be like Star Trek.

talk to me. All I'd have to do is initiate a head-nodding subroutine 
during boring conversations and I could amuse myself in my head all day 
long.
     
I think that if anyone could become a cyborg, there would be a huge rush 
of people getting in line for the conversion. Kids would like it for the 
look. Adults would like it for its utility. Cyborg technology has 
something for everyone. So, unlike Star Trek, I can imagine everyone 
wanting to be a cyborg.
     
The only downside I can see is that when the human part dies and you're 
at the funeral, the cyborg part will try to claw its way out of the 
casket and slay all the mourners. But that risk can be minimized by 
saying you have an important business meeting, so you can't make it to 
the service.
     
Shields
-------
I wish I had an invisible force field. I'd use it all the time, 
especially around people who spit when they talk or get too close to my 
personal space. In fact, I'd probably need a shield quite a bit if I 
also had a phaser to play with.
     
I wouldn't need a big shield system like the one they use to protect the 
Enterprise, maybe just a belt-clip device for personal use. I could 
insult dangerous people without fear of retribution. Whatever crumbs
of personality I now have would be completely unnecessary in the future. 
On the plus side, it would make shopping much more fun.
     
             Shopping with Shields Up
             ------------------------
     
     
         Me:          Ring this up for me, you
                      unpleasant cretin.
     
         Saleswoman:  I oughta slug you!
     
         Me:          Try it. My shields are up.
     
         Saleswoman:  Damn!
     
         Me:          There's nothing you can do to
                      harm me.
     
         Saleswoman:  I guess you're right. Would you like
                      to open a charge account? Our interest 
                      rates are very reasonable.
     
         Me:          Nice try.
     
     
Long-Range Sensors
------------------
If people had long-range sensors, they would rarely use them to scan for 
new signs of life. I think they would use them to avoid work. You could 
run a continuous scan for your boss and then quickly transport yourself 
out of the area when he came near. If your manager died in his office, 
you would know minutes before the authorities discovered him, and that 
means extra break time.
     
Vulcan Death Grip
-----------------
Before all you Trekkies write to correct me, I know there is no such 
thing as a Vulcan Death Grip even in Star Trek. But I wish there were. 
That would have come in handy many times. It would be easy to make the 
Vulcan Death Grip look like an accident.
     
'I was just straightening his collar and he collapsed.'
     
I think the only thing that keeps most people from randomly killing 
other citizens is the bloody mess it makes and the high likelihood of 
getting caught. With the Vulcan Death Grip, it would be clean and 
virtually undetectable. Everybody would be killing people left and 
right. You wouldn't be able to have a decent conversation at the office 
over the sound of dead co-workers hitting the carpet. The most common 
sounds in corporate America would be, 'I'm sorry I couldn't give you a 
bigger raise, but . . . erk!'
     
And that's why the future won't be like Star Trek.

now, but I used to throw raves down in Miami... backinthaday! 
  I don't know if I'm going to make it to BBQ&Beats, but if I do, I'd

are getting so tiring! it seems that a lot of ppl feel comfortable pouring
their souls out on this list, and since i don't have a therapist perhaps
doing the same will help me out here. so here's the scoop: i moved out here
a few months ago, and posted an intro and met some ppl from it. i thought i
had found some good friends.... actually, i met one person who introduced
me to his friends, and they were all around my age, so i thought i had
found some sort of a niche here. well, tables have turned at this point,
and what it all boils down to is the old adage "don't sleep with your
friends". don't. you know, it's weird. 'coz i have in the past, had these
sorts of relationships and we're all still friends. guess it depends on the
person. anyway, since i know of only 2 ppl on this list who know what's
going on, i don't think this is a problem, posting this. besides, i give
these ppl enough credit to form their own opinions of both me and this
other person. so, here i am, back to where i started.... lonely in sf. (and
*you* [k] - my loneliness isn't about you at all! you're my bud - i'm just
rambling at this point 'coz i'd like to meet some more ppl!)

so, if there's anyone out there in the same boat, relatively new to sf, or
not so new.... i work (really) hard, play (semi) hard (i say this 'coz i've
met some ppl out here who make me look like a complete prude!), love to
dance my ass off, what else.... a bit on the older side (25+? i'm 30...).
and girls! why is it that i only get responses from men? not that i mind,
really (most of my close friends _are_ men), but i could use some girl
friends! anyway, i think i make a really good friend if you're a good
person.... it's just that i'm really busy with work, and sort of shy, so i
find it hard to meet ppl. outside of raving, i'm obsessed with the arts,
and sf ballet is performing FREE this sunday if anyone wants to join me!

and the ppl that were interested in SOMA.... please write me as there's
been some major changes.

feeling not so much bitter as much as confused and lonely (had to sign off
like this as i feel like i'm writing dear abby!)

cheers - e. :)

It looks like everyone is in the market for 1200's again...

I know this thread has come up before, so I appologize for re-hashing it...
but who has the best price for new 1200s in the bay area?  What about
from other cities?

thanks,
-troy

Hey! Another 'mature' (Ha!) woman that doesn't feel too old to go out 
and dance her ass off! We should hang out sometime. I have some GREAT 
friends that are really positive (like me... now) and non-judgemental 
(again.. like me) and work really hard (geez.. this is gettin' old!). I 
still consider myself new to SF (almost 2 years now) but I'm lucky 
enough to have met better friends here than I had back home.. maybe you 
can be one of them? CORRESPOND GIRL!

Troy, I just bought some decks last weekend at K&K Music in the
southbay.  They wanted like 550 a piece but Science and I talked the
guy down to like 500.  It was still disappointing because I was
expecting to pay (at most) 500 - but more like 450-475 per table.  

I hear you can get last month's (or this month's) X-celerator (is that
how you spell it?:) magazine and clip out the technics 1200's for 449
coupon from the Trance & Jungle Factory and it to Good Guy's where
they'll match prices in the bay area.  Catch is, Good Guy's will call
and if T&JF doesn't have them in stock, they won't match.  Yikes, I
know.

If you've got a lot of patience, you can probably get them for lower
than what I paid (500), so good luck.

-jspace

ps. did anyone find it really hard to install the cartridges onto the
head rack?  damn, those nuts and screws they give you are way too
small.
It literally took my roommate and I like several hours to assemble my
1200's, no thanks to my Stanton's.

Sfraves,

Anyone here going to City Espresso off Stevens Creek and Lawrence
Expressway tonight?

My friend Gus from Audio Electronic (Protolab) will be playing for
several hours tonight.  The music is all original so there will be no
DJ'ing going on (I don't think).  

It should be a good time - and an even better time if I could meet the
sfraves cast who will be attending.  I haven't really had a chance to
meet most of you (except Andy, Siphon and Matt).

Let me know if you're going and I'll keep an eye out.  I'll be wearing
umm.... what I'm wearing now (at work) - a Sonic Youth t-shirt or
something.

Peace, JSpace (che)

ps. it starts at 8

And while your there you can pick up  tickets for the  BBQ & BEATS Campout.
Remember, there are two different tickets. One is for people bringing there own
food, which are free. If you can make any kind of donation to help cover

want to
eat the food we are bringing, and those are $10. You can checkout the BBQ &
BEATS

Hope to see as many of you there today as possible!!

Take care,

It was excellent, deaks is the bomb, and I didn't get elbowed by too many 
people (that means there was room to dance), although it was a little 
toasty the whole night.  Another excellent pro-soy party :) !!

     Pro-Soy was a sweet ass party! Everyone in attendance was cool. No 
     attitudes anywhere. Cool location also. The chill out room was 
     excellent, however I wished it was a little darker. Brightest room in 
     the place. 
     
     I think I had the best-tasting organic fruit I've ever had, oh yeah 
     and the E was great also(Tastebuds were flaming)!! Fantastic Beats all 
     night!! Chai shakes are cool... I am a dedicated fan of Pro-Soy! 
     Please party again soon. 
     
     Oh yeah, it was kinda warm, but still sweet.
     
     Peace Always!

I suggest buying them mailorder. I've had good experiences w/ J&R Music
World in NY, and very good experiences w/ "One Call" (aka Huppins HiFi,
Camera and Video) in WA (see URL below). In addition to saving on the
ridiculous 8.25% sales tax, they have very competitive pricing. With
J&R Music World, you can haggle them down a few more percent on some
items, or get them to throw in free shipping (3% of purchase price), or
get them to match some other price. "One Call" includes shipping as
part of the price.

In either case, you can save serious bucks over the prices at a place
like Guitar Center or the Good Guys (both of which are total ripoffs).
Good Guys has a "low price guarantee" but they won't apply it to out of
state mailorder places... combine that with the 8.25% savings on sales
tax and I end up NEVER buying any gear other than cables and connectors
and other widgets at local shops.

Anyways, here's a good listing of mail order retailers
	http://garbanzo.ssesco.com/nau/mailorder.htm

I know that J&R sells 1200's, don't know about "One Call" ...

Subject: (sorta sp) fashion question
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.org
Precedence: bulk

I know that most of y'all don't like to make an effort to look 'like a
raver', so I'd like to pose a couple of fashion questions:

1) Where do you shop?
2) Do you go for a type of look (hippieraver, candyraver, clubber, mod,
whatever) when you go out to a party or club? If not, can you describe what
you wear when you go out?
3) What clothes do you want and have a hard time finding?
4) Would you buy clothing online?
5) How much do you spend on clothing in an average month?
6) What information would you like to see on a site that sold clothing
online? Club info? UG Party info? Music/DJ info?
7) What accessories would you buy online? Glowy things? Whistles?
Sunglasses? What else?

The reason for these questions? Simple. Profit... pure profit..... greed is
good, greed works.... Oh, wait a second, I'm getting carried away.
Seriously, a partner and I are investigating the possibility of starting an
online store, specializing in club and rave fashions.  For obvious reasons,
we'd like to be as responsive to the scene as possible, and can't do it
without your feedback. So, any thoughts you might have would be
appreciated.

Let me know what you think !! - Kolin

I just discovered a good local MC-303 web site and an international
mailing list. http://www.mc303.net/index.html is the URL, and
http://www.mc303.net/maillist.htm is the URL for subscribing over the
web.
 
The site even has links to  good audio samples links so the doubters
can hear that you can have "the sound", plus polyphony,
multitimbrality, and even good drums all in one portable, easily
battery powered box (http://www.acid.demon.nl/).

For manual subscription:
      To manualy Subscribe, Unsubscribe or switch between
      Digest and Active (normal) messages, mail to
      listserver@mail.mc303.net.
      The FROM field of the email message MUST contain your
      email address.
      The BODY (thats where you type your message) MUST
      contain ONE (and only one) of the following commands:

                  SUBSCRIBE groovelist
                  UNSUBSCRIBE groovelist
                  SET groovelist DIGEST
                  SET groovelist ACTIVE

      Post your normal messages to
      GROOVELIST@MAIL.MC303.NET not to the listserver
      address.
      And ofcause, don't send administrative messages to the list,
      use the listserver address.

Yeah, I have to agree here.  Matter of fact I think it was Niels that told me
...um.....er "advised" me to try J&R for my Pioneer mixer. :)  I saves over a
hundred bucks and got it delivered to my front door. :)

I suggest buying them mailorder. I've had good experiences w/ J&R Music
World in NY, and very good experiences w/ "One Call" (aka Huppins HiFi,
Camera and Video) in WA (see URL below). In addition to saving on the
ridiculous 8.25% sales tax, they have very competitive pricing. With
J&R Music World, you can haggle them down a few more percent on some
items, or get them to throw in free shipping (3% of purchase price), or
get them to match some other price. "One Call" includes shipping as
part of the price.

In either case, you can save serious bucks over the prices at a place
like Guitar Center or the Good Guys (both of which are total ripoffs).
Good Guys has a "low price guarantee" but they won't apply it to out of
state mailorder places... combine that with the 8.25% savings on sales
tax and I end up NEVER buying any gear other than cables and connectors
and other widgets at local shops.

The definition of "nimrod" is mighty hunter.

I somehow doubt that was intended as a compliment.

>I know that most of y'all don't like to make an effort to look 'like a
>raver', so I'd like to pose a couple of fashion questions:

>1) Where do you shop?

Depends on how much money I have in my pocket.  Those "Clothes by the Pound" places are pretty cool.  Ross is also a good hookup for cheap clothes.  dont buy shoes there.

>2) Do you go for a type of look (hippieraver, candyraver, clubber, mod,
>whatever) when you go out to a party or club? 

I've never understood this 'trying to achieve a certain look' with fashion.  I guess I just wasnt raised with a fashion consious outlook on life.  I know what cloths look cool to me, but I dont try to achieve a look.  

>If not, can you describe what you wear when you go out?

The same thing I wear when I stay in.

>3) What clothes do you want and have a hard time finding?

none really.

>4) Would you buy clothing online?

maybe.  I usually like to try stuff on first.  If there was some sort of return policy then maybe I would.

>5) How much do you spend on clothing in an average month?

I dont go shopping for clothes every month.  This month I spent 50 bucks on a pair of shoes.  I need some shirts and socks...

>6) What information would you like to see on a site that sold clothing
>online? Club info? UG Party info? Music/DJ info?

A 'who has bought our clothes' section.  You could have people send in pictures of themselves wearing your clothes (You know, like what they do at Hobee's)

>7) What accessories would you buy online? Glowy things? Whistles?
>Sunglasses? What else?

Backpacks....buttbags.....earplugs...mix tapes....

Oh yeah, and if you happen you happen to buy anything from "OneCall"
(aka Huppins HiFi, http://www.onecall.com/,  1-800-340-4770) please
tell them that I recommended them to you -- cuz I get a 1% referral
fee, which I can use towards the purchase of more equipment!). :-) 

(I guess this should be a BSI post "blatant self interest"...)

I wish J&R had a referral fee, cuz I've referred a whole bunch of
people to them for the Pioneer CDJ500mkII's CD player and the CDM-500
mixer. :-)

I'm just curious - since I have to get a CD player to accompany my
sound system, I might as well get a CD player which I can use to mix. 
How much do Pioneer CDJ500mkII's go for a piece?  I'd probably only
get 1 and not a pair.

The thing is, I just have a shitload of CDs I could use, if I only had
a Cd player which can do more than pause/play.  

Thanks.

Hey there. I have a request of all you fine folks. When you are replying
to someone's message, please consider quoting just the relevent parts.
There are are a few reasons for this:

1) It is really annoying(for me at least) to page through a 10 page quoted
   message to see someone put a "me too" or a couple of lines of followup.

2) It saves bandwidth which is at a premium.

3) You will feel better as a human being, and people will find you
   irresistable.

Well no promises on #3... ;-)

I got my CDJ500mkII's for $599.95 ea.  I personally think they're great
and they sound good too, and they're quite solid.

There was an argument on this list a while back about these players
skipping when the bass is too loud -- like on a 10,000 watt soundsystem
with inadequately compliant isolation... (i have plenty of loudness --
130dB w/o distortion -- plenty of bass, have my speakers on the same
"industrial" shelves as my CD player, and have no problems w/
skipping). 

The other ones to look at (IMHO) are the Vestax (which are cool, but
expensive) and the Denon's (which have a crappy "user interface" in my
opinion). THere's also a new Vestax out which has 2 cd players and a
mixer in one unit for  a lot less money than separate components...
Avoid Gemini, Numark, GLI, etc. (you get what you pay for).

> 1) Where do you shop?

COSTCO! (Fuck fashion -- i save my money for electronics and CD's!). 
Ross.
Garage sales.
Used/Consignment stores.
Clothes I pick up when I'm travelling.
Nordstrom's (when they have a sale).
Macy's (when they have a sale).
Random shops that I pass by that have clothing that isn't raver-fashionable
(i buy things that transcend raver fashion, that will remain fashionable
(or uniquely hideous, or simply useful) long after the fashion-du-jour has
become cheezy -- I have yet to buy any clothing at a "raver" shop, and
I doubt I ever will (unless there's a sale, and the clothes fit and 
are good quality).

I try to look like myself. Pretty much what I'd wear anytime, except
that I like something a little more colorful for going out. Jeans.
SLacks. Shirt or T-shirt. Last rave I went to (Sunset boat party) I was
wearing $20.00 slacks i bought at Costo, a $20.00 cotton hawaiian print
shirt i bought at Costco. And $80.00 Rockport Prowalkers I bought at
Nordstrom's (other than CLark's, these are the best dancing shoe on the
planet). And a futuristic-looking red/shiny metallic "solar alpha" ski
jacket  (Kaelin) that they had on sale at B&D sports a while back
($150.00 for a jacket that normally costs $350.00  -- such a bahgain!).

> 3) What clothes do you want and have a hard time finding?

Diesel Jeans. Too fucking expensive. Last pair I had was great and I
got them in NYC for $40.00 cuz they were on sale.  That, and these very
comfy and high-quality pants you can get in the UK called "Gentlemen's
Breeches" (GB). Clothes by Hugo Boss that isn't overpriced :-)....

> 4) Would you buy clothing online?

No way.  How could you tell if it fit? Being taller and bigger than
most folks, I wear XL or XXL shirts, 'cept that not all XL's are
actually the same size. SO there's no way I'd trust the mfgr's
labelling of something to be indicative of fit. I've even managed to
dissuade my girlfriend from catalog-shopping cuz the product you see in
the picture looks much better and fits much better than the product you
actually get. OnLine is no different than catalog shopping. Don't need
it, don't want it. OnLine is only good for buying CD's,
Audio/Video/Electronics/Computers....

> 5) How much do you spend on clothing in an average month?

$0.00-$50.00, depending on the month. Sometimes more for special
long-term clothing like shoes, jackets, sports clothing, etc.

> 6) What information would you like to see on a site that sold clothing
> online? Club info? UG Party info? Music/DJ info?

There's plenty of this info available in a non-commercial context.
Unless the site had info that was very specific to the goods being
produced and made you *hunger* for the product in an almost
teledildonic fashion, it's not useful. Do you really want to compete
with hyperreal? Here's a site that has made me part with my not-so-hard
earned $$$ http://www.sweetwater.com -- note that it's not clothing.

> 7) What accessories would you buy online? Glowy things? Whistles?
> Sunglasses? What else?

Cables, Connectors. Plugs. Adaptors. :-)

***  Well, I pick up my clothes in a similar fashion...  When I give 4+
ravers a ride to a local  (I.E. Party) and bring 4+ different ravers
back... I ususally get a collection of clothes, toys, waterbottles and such
left in my car.   So I guess one can say that I keep up with raver trends.
Alltho' I'm not really trying...

 I shy from the shiny stuff...  I guess that I'm stuck in 1993 when cops
cracked HARD on break-in raves (SPAZ 93-94... the good ole days).  It was
easiest to wear dark jeans and a dark shirt so you can bolt from a busted
party and dissapper in a crowd or alley (Try blending in a group with
bright orange pants, a yello shirt, and 3ft platform shoez).

I'm sorry guys, but do you think somebody could explain to me what this 
whole conversation is about... The thing is, I'm looking for a pair of 
low price 1200's, so if you guys actually know anything on that matter, 
please e-mail me...

plur and hugs

Subject: RE: (sorta sp) fashion question
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.org
Precedence: bulk

>1) Where do you shop?
Thrift Stores!!!  My favorite is this phatty one on Fruitridge (I live in 
Sacramento), I hear Funk City is pretty good for trendy type used gear but I 
haven't got a chance to really check it out.  For new clothes, I love Ross, 
that store is the greatest, cheap and sorta trendy.  Or the kid's section in 
any cheap ass store--I got this cute & quality Dr. Seuss tee at McFrugals for 
$4.99!!!
>2) Do you go for a type of look (hippieraver, candyraver, clubber, mod,
>whatever) when you go out to a party or club? If not, can you describe >what 
you wear when you go out?
When I go out . . . depends on where I'm going.  I like to go for 70s-ish 
clean cut polyester freak mama, but I've been sporting a lot of jeans and tank 
tops since it's kinda hot outside.  When I'm going to a party I'm usually 
sporting slick comfy yet feminine stuff I can dance in and *bonus* maybe looks 
cool in a blacklight.  Comfort first.
>3) What clothes do you want and have a hard time finding?
Clothes to wear in the heat!  Like I said, polyester just doesn't cut it in 
100 degree weather or a sweaty party in some poorly ventilated crowded 
wherehouse.  I'm usually not looking for certain brand names cuz I'm a big 
bargain shopper, but that usually means I dress a little more originally than 
most folx so that's okay.  I'd still like to find some more neon stuff because 
I love bright clothes in or out of parties.
>4) Would you buy clothing online?
Er, probably not.  Why?  1.  Can't try stuff on  2.  I don't have credit cards 
and those are best for online shopping  3.  How do I know if I send off a 
check that I'm going to get stuff back?  Anybody can set up a website, can I 
trust every one I see?
>5) How much do you spend on clothing in an average month?
$50-$100.  I love shopping, I like to hit thrift shops once a week (new stuff 
coming in all the time).  I'm due for a trip real soon, matter of fact.
>6) What information would you like to see on a site that sold clothing
>online? Club info? UG Party info? Music/DJ info?
Yuck, not really any of those, seems kind of cheesy for a clothing site, plus 
I can get all that kind of info through sfraves, hyperreal, or URB.  Maybe 
some pictures of fashion trends, like some pictures of people at a party, or 
on the street.  Real people, not fashion models sporting unattainable Versace 
(btw a fashion legend) and runway type fashion, but just some regular folks 
walking around living life . . . fashionably.  And other fashion info like 
hair tips or stupid little trends I'll end up following, etc.
>7) What accessories would you buy online? Glowy things? Whistles?
>Sunglasses? What else?
Now I would buy hard to find "rave" gear online, because where the hell else 
are you going to find it?  Like an industrial sized box of 200 glowsticks, or 
a 60 oz. vat of neon green body glitter, or black lights, or those huge 
lollipops you can only get at Disneyland, big bright glowy toys, glow in the 
dark jewelry, and other asinine (sp) wastes of money.

I love clothes!  If this site gets up and running, I might have to go against 
my better judgement and make a purchase . . . 

xoxo--Miccaela

It's 2 am, it's time for me to try to sleep
I feel insomnia tapping at my feet
smiling at Eudora high on life
I listen to mystere all day and night
My best friend yury will leave the country at 11am
In Europe I wish him happiness and fame
He just left my house, I hugged him bye
to bad I smoked that roach, we coulda gotten high
back to the point I was going to make
I should get to bed for tomorrow I shall wake (late)

ok I was going to rhyme the whole thing, but I ran out of rhymes. Who wants
to go somewhere for lunch today (Thursday) around the san jose area? I'm
down for whatever time, whatever place, whatever.
Actually I'm listening to graeme the special edition tape and it's PHAT!!!!
This is the only tape that's so emotional, it made me cry. I know it's
-=*house*=- music, but house has a bad rep for no reason, it's not the same
as it use to be, and all you house haters probably never hear good house
(not to start a flame war or anything :()
anyway, e-mail me, or page me :510-319-0374, and we'll satisfy those cranky
munchies.

i know i know we're discouraged from promoting our own stuff on these lists.

but i've seen ohter people do it, and i just stayed up ALL NIGHT so you
people could have something new and exciting to listen to.  it's now 6:20
am.  curse that santa cruz roasting company.  actually i should thank them
for giving me the stamina to stay up this late.

But if you like bouncy bubbly tripped out sorta but not totally derrick
carter style house and breakbeat, you could be in luck. "Champagne Trance".

No, I wasn't drinking when I made this tape.  But you see, I just dj'd my
first ravE wedding last weekend (hi amanda and dustin 3!  love u!)  and I
just thought champagne reception.

Of course there wasn't much champagne being consumed at this rave wedding.

Now I would like to clarify something.  This tape is not a live
performance.  This tape was recorded at Ten Forward Studios (my house) in
Belmont, CA.  94002.

If you think you are at all interested in the tape, I'm not going to go
through the hassle of doing the record store thing for this one.  Strictly
word of mouth.  And I'm only gonna charge $7, not including mailing cost.
So email me privately if you would like a copy.

(ps, amanda and dustin please give me your address, this is my gift to you)

love,

dEEp 415.595.3427

follow up:

ended up going to k&k music in san jose primarly becuase they were
open until 9pm :D

I got this killer little Vertax mixer... very simple, small, and well
thought out... completely different from those flashy, noisy Newmark/Gemini
mixers.  The Vertax sounds great, looks very cool, and was only 230.00.

highly suggested...

-troy

ps:  k&K took about 70 dollars off the whole deal of turntable, mixer,
ortofon...

50 FUN THINGS TO DO AT WAL-MART OR K-MART


1. Take shopping carts for the express purpose of filling them and
stranding them at strategic locations.

2. Ride those little electronic cars at the front of the store.

3. Set all the alarm clocks to go off at ten minute intervals
throughout the day.

4. Start playing Calvinball; see how many people you can get to join
in.

5. Contaminate the entire auto department by sampling all the spray
air fresheners.

6. Challenge other customers to duels with tubes of gift wrap.

7. Leave cryptic messages on the typewriters.

8. Re-dress the mannequins as you see fit.

9. When there are people behind you, walk REALLY SLOW, especially
thin narrow aisles.

10. Walk up to an employee and tell him in an official tone, "I
think we've got a Code 3 in Housewares," and see what happens.

11. Tune all the radios to a polka station; then turn them all off
and turn the volumes to "10".

12. Play with the automatic doors.

13. Walk up to complete strangers and say, "Hi!  I haven't seen you
in so long!..." etc.  See if they play along to avoid embarrassment.

14. While walking through the clothing department, ask yourself loud
enough for all to hear, "Who BUYS this junk, anyway?"

15. Repeat Number 14 in the jewelry department.

16. Ride a display bicycle through the store; claim you're taking it
for a "test drive."

17. Follow people through the aisles, always staying about five feet
away. Continue to do this until they leave the department.

18. Play soccer with a group of friend, using the entire store as
your playing field.

19. As the cashier runs your purchases over the scanner, look
mesmerized and say, "Wow.  Magic!"

20. Put M&M's on layaway.

21. Move "Caution: Wet Floor" signs to carpeted areas.

22. Set up a tent in the camping department; tell others you'll only
invite them in if they bring pillows from Bed and Bath.

23. Test the fishing rods and see what you can "catch" from the
other aisles.

24. Ask other customers if they have any Grey Poupon.

25. Drape a blanket around your shoulders and run around saying,
"...I'm Batman.  Come, Robin--to the Batcave!"

26. TP as much of the store as possible.

27. Randomly throw things over into neighboring aisles.

28. Play with the calculators so that they all spell "hello" upside
down.

29. When someone asks if you need help, begin to cry and ask, "Why
won't you people just leave me alone?"

30. When two or three people are walking ahead of you, run between
them, yelling, "Red Rover!"

31. Make up nonsense products and ask newly hired employees if there
are any in stock, i.e., "Do you have any Shnerples here?"

32. Take up an entire aisle in Toys by setting up a full scale
battlefield with G.I. Joes vs. the X-Men.

33. Take bets on the battle described above.

34. Nonchalantly "test" the brushes and combs in Cosmetics.

36. Hold indoor shopping cart races.

37. Dart around suspiciously while humming the theme from  "Mission:
Impossible."

38. Attempt to fit into very large gym bags.

39. Attempt to fit others into very large gym bags.

40. Say things like, "Would you be so kind as to direct me to your
Twinkies?"

41. Set up a "Valet Parking" sign in front of the store. 

42. Two words: "Marco Polo."

43. Leave Cheerios in Lawn and Garden, pillows in the pet food aisle,
etc. 

44. "Re-alphabetize" the CD's in Electronics.

46. When someone steps away from their cart to look at something,
quickly make off with it without saying a word.

47. Relax in the patio furniture until you get kicked out.

48. When an announcement comes over the loudspeaker, assume the fetal
position and scream, "No, no!  It's those voices again!"

49. Pay off layaways fifty cents at a time.

50. Drag a lounge chair on display over to the magazines and relax.
If the store has a food court, buy a soft drink; explain that you
don't get out much, and ask if they can put a little umbrella in it.

*BONUS*  Attempt all of the above during the same visit.

hey guys... I'm going to be leaving my company soon and wanna see if
anyone is interested in my position. You don't need stupid certification
or papers or any crap shit fuck like that =) (I hate that crap, but
still it's a plus), but you do need to know your shit! ya gotta know
computers well, basic and advanced concepts. We use novell 3.11 and
cc:mail r8, we have remote access and ummm video teleconferencing, and a
buncha stuff like that. All PCs (yay!), and ummm running wfw311 on
almost all. You gotta be able to catch on quick and be a good and fast
learner. You've gotta be resourceful. The company is a mortgage/loan
firm, with a pretty impressive computer department. We're family
oriented, and of moderate size (about 100 or so employees). We try to
stay on the leading edge of technology. You need a valid drivers license
and insurance, because we have satellite offices (which mean field work
too). ummm need to be able to build, fix, and troubleshoot PCs. This is
an awesome opportunity for superdooper cool experience. Must dress nice
(we are a mortgage/loan firm), and look presentable. No hats or rave
gear at work. No funky hair or colored hair, no odd piercings,
nananana...

anyone interested? write me back or call me at 408.281.3600 ex.218
between the hours of 10am and 7pm. Best to call me, but you can write
back if you'd like. ummm if you get my voice mail, leave a message and
I'll call you back.

peace and good luck.jer

Perhaps you don't understand...No knock on TT, but they can't get the
decks for that price...

So you're not 'dissing' T&J factory for Good Guys by doing that.

Sfraves,

Howdy. Had a good time last night at Slow Roasted (it was my first),
met many people, all was good.  I didn't get to meet a few of you out
there who sent me e-mail so tonight would be a good chance to make
that happen. :)  

Anyone going to Kismet on S.First St. San Jose tonight?  

Again, Audio Electronic will be playing so if you missed them last
night... you know what to do.

I thought this was kinda creative -


The European Union commissioners have announced that agreement has been
reached to adopt English as the preferred language for European
communications, rather than German, which was the other possibility.
As part of the negotiations, Her Majesty's Government conceded that
English spelling had some room for improvement and has accepted a
five-year phased plan for what will be known as EuroEnglish (Euro for
short).

In the first year, "s" will be used instead of the soft "c".
Sertainly, sivil servants will resieve this news with joy.   Also, the
hard "c" will be replaced with "k".  Not only will this klear up
konfusion, but typewriters kan have one less letter.

There will be growing publik enthusiasm in the sekond year, when
the troublesome "ph" will be replaced by "f". This will make words
like "fotograf" 20 per sent shorter.

In the third year, publik akseptanse of the new spelling kan be
expekted to reach the stage where more komplikated changes are
possible. Governments will enkorage the removal of double letters,
which have always ben a deterent to akurate speling. Also, al wil agre
what the horible mes of silent "e"s in the languag is disgrasful, and
they would go.

By the fourth year, peopl wil be reseptiv to steps such as
replasing  "th" by z" and "w" by " v".

During ze fifz year, ze unesesary "o" kan be dropd from vords
kontaining "ou",and similar changes vud of kors be aplid to ozer
kombinations of leters.

After zis fifz yer, ve vil hav a reli sensibl riten styl. Zer
vil be  no mor trubls or difikultis and evrivun vil find it ezi tu
understand ech ozer.

        Ze drem vil finali kum tru.

Gamecenter.com has a write up about the work Mars did with Commander
Tom, I didn't know it was from Virtua Fighters! It even mentions some
correlation between the game community and the underground dance
community.

None of the cards are the same.   It's an old card trick.  You 
concentrate on remembering your card and not what the other cards 
were.  As long as they look the same you probably won't notice.  You 
just notice that your card is not there but really none of the 
original cards are there.

last night was the last roots
may it rest in peace
it was the fattest weekly i have ever had the pleasure of attending.

last night was alot of fun Harry Who was the guest and he always brings a
smile to my face with his excellent house grooves

the music was always good at roots (garth,jeno + guest....usually someone
really good)

the vibe was really cool, especially in the beginning and for the last
couple weeks.   sweaty people freaking out at 3am to fat disco grooves,  
in the basement of 1015.

disco glory at its finest!!

personal roots highlights:
*the night that Harvey played right after he released "the bone"   he had
the wicked sound system playing louder than i have ever heard it.

*the night that Garth felt like he was "possesed"   it was epic.   we
reached a special place that night on the dancefloor.

*markie at roots two weeks ago.   i was so stoked.

For Saturday, I have to put in a little plug for an event I'm helping
with, the Off The Streets performance and party, but there's also the
Juggernaut Festival that night with a huge lineup, and several others.
On Sunday, the day/evening Stompy's have been sounding pretty good, so
try this one out.

     Peace All,
     
     Well, I'm torn for weekend plans....
     
     I've read alot about Juggernaut!! And it sounds fantastic, sounds 
     huge! 25 bucks though. Oh well, not an issue. From the recording it 
     tells you that last year 3000 people showed up. DAMN! Very cool, but 
     hectic. The lineup is unbeatable, and some of the attractions sound 
     great. However, this will be a massive party. Lots of people and 
     chaos, which isn't always bad, but could be. 
     
     Then, I just read the note from joe regarding Terra, which also sounds 
     cool. Not on a grand scale like Juggernaut, which I like, and it's for 
     a good cause. 
     
     I'm unsure of what kind of party I want this weekend. That sucks. So, 
     I hoping the list might be able to sway myself one way or the other. 
     PLEASE HELP.... It's actually kind of frustrating. Anyhow, any words 
     of advice would be greatly appreciated!. Keep the Peace always. <JCO>

Last year's Juggernaut was anything but fantastic. Juggernaut lost their
original space, and had to scramble to find a new one, so the party started
very late. The Mantra room was going off right away, but at that time you
could go to Mantra on any Sunday night, and only pay $5 for the privilege.
The sound in the main room didn't get started until after 2:00am. Many of
the live acts never played.

It is possible that 3000 people showed up: however, I doubt that even 2000
were optimistic enough to stick around for any length of time.

Oh yeah $2.00 water.

Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.org

The cooperative team of Harmony, Mad and Cloud Factory proudly (and
excitedly) announce ...

               4X4 MONSTER CAMPOUT
               Fri Aug 15- Sun Aug 17
              
               in the Sierras!!!

In honor of Harmony's 4 years bringing us all the happiest parties around,
we're doing a campout in the redwoods of the Sierras!

Picture a private remote campground with 180+ acres of redwoods with a
stream running through it, under the sun in the daytime and the stars and a
full moon at night!  Add all your friends and favorite people, a pumping
dance sound system, plus a magical ambient area under the trees!  

The spot has level tiered campsites, real bathrooms with sinks and showers,
and a stream running through it.  It's private and permitted.... bring your
tent, drink the free spring water (yep, the same stuff you pay to buy in
bottles), and dance and chill with us all weekend.  It's about 2-1/2 hours
from the East Bay (if you follow the directions ;^) and the roads ain't all
that bad, either!

DJs will include all your favorites from Mad (like Ethan), Harmony (like
Greg) and Cloud Factory (like Drenalin) .... plus some special guests such
as members of the UCSC Gamilon Orchestra.  (Once we have the lineup set,
we'll post it.)

We'll start Friday night, and go right through until Sunday morning.... this
will be the mini-vacation of your dreams, I swear.  

There's lots of space, but tickets will still be limited, and the first ones
will be for sale at Sunset on Sunday (look for Brian Behlendorff, Jondabomb
or me, Leslie) for $20.

If you were at the Harmony 3-year (which was amazing) .... this is even
better!  The location is even more gorgeous, and it's set up to accommodate
lots of happy camper/partiers. We are talking raver heaven here, ok?

So call your friends now and make your plans.  If you can't make it to
Sunset, not to worry.... tickets will be available at the record stores
starting next week (we'll let you know where and when).... because we want
all the most positive and happy people to be there to share this special
occasion with us.

If you've never gone to a campout party, it's the bomb.  Time to chill, hang
out, hike, talk and get to know lots of wonderful people. Mark your
calendars and make your plans now. We love you all, and want to see you there!

Leslie

When the British band the Prodigy played Irving Plaza in New York City 
this month, something extraordinary happened. Yes, the performance had 
punk-rock vigor; Keith Flint, the singer-dancer with the shock-rock 
hairdo, made Halloween faces at the crowd, emcee Maxim did some 
barechested stage strutting, and band mastermind Liam Howlett coolly 
orchestrated the show from behind his banks of keyboards. But from the 
first note, the sweaty, expectant crowd, which had seen the band pushed 
on MTV for months, began to dance. There's no dancing at alternative-rock 
shows--people merely mosh, which is as close to dancing as car crashes 
are to figure skating. But when the Prodigy's deep bass groove hit the 
crowd, they were off. Feet were moving in time, and arms were swaying 
with the rhythm. Dance-rock was cool again.

This was supposed to be the summer of "electronica"--artificially 
flavored pop that relies heavily on synthesizers, samples, loops and 
dance-beats and less on guitars and vocals. But so far, electronic, or 
techno, music seems to have only a few more fans in the U.S. than Dennis 
Rodman has in Utah; the most heralded acts have been weak performers in 
the marketplace. Now the Prodigy has arrived in the U.S., and its potent 
album, The Fat of the Land (Maverick/Mute XL/Warner Bros.), due out July 
1, is not far behind. Can the band give electronica the jolt it needs?

Others have tried and failed. The ambient electronic group the Orb's 
newest CD, Orblivion, has sold only 65,000 copies in the U.S.; recent 
releases by such vaunted acts as the Future Sound of London and 
Underworld have moved fewer than 60,000--the Spice Girls sold more than 
that last week. Even the Chemical Brothers, after a media push that would 
make Madonna blush, has failed to crack Billboard's Top 10. And what's 
worse, these CDs have been creatively wanting--the Chemical Brothers' Dig 
Your Own Hole (Astralwerks) features a few songs that energetically blend 
rock and hip-hop, but Public Enemy and the Beastie Boys did it better in 
the '80s. The Future Sound of London's Dead Cities (Astralwerks) is as 
exciting as a dead Tamagotchi, and Underworld's Pearl's Girl (Wax Trax! 
Records) is only a trifle more fun than having a fax machine call you on 
your voice line.

Some veteran artists sneer at the hype. "I'm not a big fan of 
racist-conspiracy theories, but it's hard not to notice that for the last 
15 years every R.-and-B., hip-hop and dance record has been an electronic 
record," says U.S. techno pioneer Moby, who is white. "Then two white 
British guys [the Chemical Brothers] come along sampling hip-hop without 
the lyrics, and they're hailed as avant-garde."

Other observers believe the music industry, desperate to revive sales, 
expected too much. Says Gary Richards, who heads A&M's techno label 1200: 
"One company tries to sign a band, and another jumps in, and it begins to 
get out of control." Although lyric-driven techno songs by White Town and 
Sneaker Pimps have got air play, Vinny Esparanza, co-editor of the Gavin 
Report, which tracks college-radio-station playlists, says, "A lot of the 
deejays around now were brought up on punk and grunge, and are unsure how 
to approach electronic music."

The Prodigy's long-awaited CD is supposed to convert the electro 
doubters. Says James Lavelle, head of England's influential Mo'Wax 
Records: "[The Prodigy] is one of those bands that do everything right: 
the right records, the right videos, it looks right, it does the show 
right." Says band member Flint: "We're not trying to be faceless and 
thinking that makes us interesting. We're up-front. We're saying, 'Look, 
if you're going to come out and see us, we're going to rock you.' "

The Fat of the Land rocks. The already released single, Firestarter, has 
some of the rebelliousness of the Sex Pistols and the funkiness of good 
hip-hop; the album's most ambitious track, Climbatize, has an orchestral 
span but maintains a rock immediacy. While only a few other tracks on the 
album (Breathe and Mindfields) stand out, the CD is consistently dynamic. 
The only real misstep is the first track, the punchy but unfortunately 
titled Smack My Bitch Up. Howlett says the title isn't literal; let's 
hope this isn't a trend, given the success of singer Meredith Brooks' 
song Bitch.

Howlett, the founder and creative core of the band, and a native of 
Chelmsford, England, says he received his earliest inspiration from 
American hip-hop acts like Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five. He 
subsequently submerged himself in Britain's burgeoning 
hip-hop-influenced, Ecstasy-popping rave culture. In 1989 he formed a 
band with Flint, Keith Palmer (Maxim) and Leeroy Thornhill, who became 
the group's featured dancer. Their early CDs featured soft techno-dance 
tunes. They were hits in England, but they sold poorly in the U.S., and 
the Prodigy's first record label, Elektra, let the band go in 1994. 
"Elektra did not have the balls to do anything with the Prodigy," says 
Howlett. "They didn't understand us."

The Prodigy's sound has since grown edgier, drawing from commercially 
successful rock and hard-core hip-hop. Last year the major music labels 
fought a bidding war to sign the band. Madonna's Maverick won with a 
contract worth a reported $5 million. When, earlier this year, MTV 
announced its intention to program more electronica and started a show, 
Amp, to promote the genre, the Prodigy, thanks to its anthemic song, 
Firestarter, became the techno band of the moment.

Which is exactly what the band members say they don't want to be. "It's 
not us," says Howlett. "Techno is maybe some stuff that comes out of 
Germany. Being called techno basically limits my music. We're definitely 
not techno. We're a hard-dance act that incorporates certain elements of 
music we like. This whole electronica scene to me is just f______ crap. 
We don't need that to come across here."

The electronica scene may yet catch on. It's booming in Florida (at least 
eight clubs have popped up in Orlando in the past three years); the sound 
tracks to the movies The Saint, Batman & Robin and 187 draw on it; major 
rock acts like U2 and Smashing Pumpkins are incorporating it into their 
sound. And there is some great electronic music out there. Morcheeba's 
Who Can You Trust? (Discovery) is a rapturous blend of bluesy vocals and 
electro atmospherics; Carl Craig's More Songs about Food and 
Revolutionary Art (Planet E) is puckishly inventive; and The Rebirth of 
Cool FOUR (4th & Broadway) is an excellent compilation of electro acts. 
Later this year new CDs are due from two of the best electro acts, Goldie 
and Portishead.

But for now, all eyes are on the Prodigy. Later this summer the band will 
headline Lollapalooza along with Tricky, the most innovative electronic 
musician around. "Don't ever judge us by what you read in articles," says 
Maxim. "The only way you can judge us is to come to the show yourself." A 
solid sales pitch. The Prodigy may be pop stars yet.

i thought this was kind of interesting, to supplement our drug discussion...
=====================
dEEp
=====================

about the drug booth thing...i know this sounds retardewd but i wish that
still was for the simple but important reason of safety.
how did they get away with it???? i mean i haven't been in the scene that
long so i don't know what parties were like in the good old days or
whatever, but i just can't see there being a booth and it not getting
busted...

also, i remember a few years back, in grade 8 or something when i first
heard about raves from somebody (and not reading about it in a magazine),
they told me that at raves they had different tables all around the dance
floor and at each one they sold you a different type of drug.  basically i
was inforemed that raves were like drug bars, and the music was just there
to better the high.  boy am i glad that person was wrong.
maude.

yeah, I was at Pro-Soy this past weekend...the music kicked ass but sometimes
 I just wish there wasn't such an emphasis on "looking like a raver" than
just going there to enjoy the music and get lost in it.....

the free fruit was yummy, but oranges aren't necessarily the kind of thing i
wanto eat on an already-semi-queasy stomach if ya know what i mean!!!  lol

have fun , keep it pumpin...

I spose this topic may have gone on a little but i have to put a few 
thing straight & offer a few observations of my own.... (& as with Adam 
you'll have to reply personally for similar reasons)

First off, just to fill anyone ibn who cares...

Im from London & have been over in the US since the 2 July. NYC to 
Chicago to St Louis to Madison, WI to Minneapolis which is where im 
tapping this out...then on to Portland, Oregon, SF, Santa B, LA, San D, 
Burning Man & back to NYC to leave on the 10th Sept.

Im having a vacation, partying, DJing (D&B, Trance & chill-out), & 
getting contacts & smiles from US people for our new record label in 
London (Seraphim Records). Im having a truley wonderful time & i think 
part of it is down to having no expectations or preconceived ideas about 
wot to expect here, whether it is to do with partying or just the many 
faces of US culture & landscape im coming accross.....

Im not trying to find anything, underground or not, in particular - just 
to have a good time with good people.....

So to Adams little missive.........

How can you have been in London less than a week & expected to have 
found the "Underground"?  - dance/electronic music is so pervasive & 
ingrained into London & UK culture now that it is not really undergroung 
per se - you have to dig around to find it. It is not going to land in 
your lap with a tourist map & money off coupons!!

One big problem is that you should have done a little home study b4 you 
left.....

London empties in the summertime.....everyone is off to festivals & 
parties all over the UK & continental Europe be it Big Green Gathering 
(pretty u/gnd) to Ibiza (everyone & their mother).....promoters, DJs 
(inc me!!), party people....they're off out into the wild blue 
yonder.....which brings up yet another point.....


London is a different city, in a different country, in a diff. 
continent, in a diff. time zone, with a diff history, culture, language 
(yes!) and diff (that great british obsession) weather and this all 
makes your comparison with SF a little dumb (or maybe misjudged). 

It has four distinct seasons so when the summer eventually hits, we 
don't really like to hang round in a crowded city too much....its hot, a 
bit polluted & smelly, & full of tourists (even more so now that London 
seems to have been a big hit in the world media (is that where you read 
about the 'underground'?)) (and no i dont mind the tourists its just 
that it can get a bit busy!) - the best time to find london is in 
October thru cos everyone that is london is back & ready to make some 
fun & smiles. (Which is how the acid/baleric explosion took in the 80s - 
everyone back from their hols (vacations) with a new buzz in the 
air)......which brings us back to the history bit.........

Dance/electronic music has been thrown around in London (&the UK) for 
these past ten years or so & has developed so many mutations it still 
makes my head spin to keep up and ive been there since '88! 'Rave' is 
pretty is a meaningless term now (it seems to mean more in the 
mainstream UK media which probably is a good indicator!).

So you want underground? Underground wot?!!

For almost every conceivable scene there is underground or mainstream be 
it house, garage (you got speed garage yet??!), d&b, acid jazz etc.

Stuff like Happy Hardcore or Trance is probably seen as underground but 
even then theres levels.....

I may be able to comment on the relation of uk/london to sf more fully 
after ive been there but im willing to take wotever comes my way......sf 
in the uk is probably best known for Haight/Astbury & the 60s 
revolution...so ive got to hang out on the block & wait for some freak 
to hand me some acid laced kool aid & if that doesnt happen in a few 
days i can complain about it????!  No. I wouldn't be so disrespectful to 
a city, its people or its scene....which brings me onto the next 
bit.........


You wrote  "The "Undergound" of sf is a tight knit community of people 
working together for what we call PLUR. This is something that the uk 
has seemed to have forgotten about."

PLUR - we couln't have forgotten about it cos we never had it!! (The 
motto that is)  PLUR is something you guys came up with & use so why 
have a dig at us for not being with it??

Now im not really wanting to diss ANYONE over this one cos it really is 
only my humble little opinion but here are a few observations on PLUR, & 
also how you seemed to have tripped yourself up with your own little 
motto..............

>From wot i have managed to glean so far, the rave scene in the US is 
much more based around a lifestyle code with definitions than the uk, 
which is not necessarily wrong or right but to this UK head it can be a 
little bizzare.....i prefer to just get on with it & let the 
music/people/'things'(?!)/scenes etc. i get involved with take me 
wherever. Why live life by a list: clothes/music/"correct 
attitude"/etc...

PLUR is all very fine & good but there does seem to be a tendancy to use 
it as a stick to beat people with if they're not doing the right thing 
or having just the right attitude.....

And where the hell is your respect regarding uk/london if you judge it 
so quickly & with so little to judge it by?

(I could mention the non-peace aspect of pitting sf with uk in your 
subject "ukscene vs sf scene" - is this some competition or face-off?? - 
how unity??)

I could go on & on (like i haven't already!!) but ill end the essay with 
the reason why i felt moved to reply.....

Basically i left london on such a wave of love & happiness from all 
sorts of people in & around my scene that it is a bit much to have 
someone diss those & that i love with so little thought & 
knowledge......ill assume that by now you may have woken up :)

You should stay until (or come back in) the autumn (fall) when it kicks 
- or find somewhere quick.......here's a few pointers (just to show that 
i think you do deserve them!!)

Wilde Ones 
- in the basement of Kensington Market (Kensington High Street). Theres 
a record shop here (you'll have to hunt for it but ask & you'll get 
there) run by a totally wonderful humanbeing called Claire & assisted by 
Cos (say hi for me!) They'll have the music you like, and info on wots 
happening when. Look out for a magazine called Dream Creation which 
could give you a few pointers. As for clubs (don't let your view from sf 
on clubs foul your view in london) try:

Escape from Samsara 
(The Fridge, Brixton most Fridays ring 0181 889 5221 for info). If you 
don't have fun here then you might as well give up & go home cos you 
have no soul.......i could give you a few names of loverly people to 
check out but you'll have to find 'em yourself

Pendragon 
- all over. The Fridge, Tyssen St Studios, out in the countryside etc...

There is a big festival in Normandy, France soon altho im not sure when 
- Claire or whoever @ Wilde Ones will know.....

The above is just a teeny tiny part of a big fat healthy fish! Maybe 
you've had some luck by now......let me know.......

And id like to hear some comment from wherever.....we're all one big, 
happy family after all (!?!)

Ill be in Portland by the 7th Aug & SF a little while after that, 
meeting some folks, spinning @ some parties, & generally having a 
trailer load of fun.......hope to see some of you wherever....and 
remember kids:

The only preconception worth having is that preconceptions are not worth 
having!

love

Rob xxx   (invisible cola)

it over with him.  IS there anyway you could get it to her?  Or that I could
get it back?  Or mebbe we should just keep passing it around to different
people so everyone has a chance to go to a rave with my popple?  heeheehee.
 Please get back to me... Thanx!
