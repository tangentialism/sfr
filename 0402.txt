yknow I always thought that would be a great fundraising event. . .

dragg races. . .

open to everyone, the attractive and alluring, but sometimes undetectable
tall asian types. . . the tough n rugged yet suprisingly elegant hairy biker
types. . . even newbies and curious types.

they could come out in their best cocktail dresses, nails done (if they're
into that), make-up n hair. . .a minimum of a 2.5-3" heel would be required.
. .

set em up in their own lanes. . .fire the pistol. . .

maybe some obstacles reminicent of Double Dare (if you remember that show).
. .like having to find a key to their handcuffs (put on @ point #2) in a
kiddie pool of ice cream and jello. . . .then one of those greased pole
crossings like they used to have back when I'd catch my dad watching playboy
games, years ago. . .a bigg slide at the end. . . maybe some wrestling would
ensue. . .

they have to keep their heels on at all times. . .the rest of the clothes
would just have to be on them at the beginning.

there could be sponsors for each. . .all the money would go to charity, and
people who sponsored the winner would get lil dragg queen trophies saying
like "My Queen was Queen of the Hill at the Dragg Racing for "blah blah
charity" Day Competition".
The other people could get a lil plaque saying like. . . well something
funny. . like about support or gay sex or something colorful like that. . .

I think it'd be a hit.
I'd participate myself but I'm kinda outta shape at the moment from not
partying enuf, and working too much (sortof).

it'd be fun to roam the pits at THAT race. . .

hehe, yeah dirty thoughts. . .it's ok. ..

: )

btw,

yeah I kinda figured that message would be just boring as FUCK, unless
you're just into that stuff like that, but after I was done writing it I
noticed there was a lot of work put into that and even tho it was kind of a
pointless "me thinking out loud" sorta thing I just put too much effort into
all of that to just delete it. . .

i think i write my thoughts more than I ever say them. . .

hmm. . .

yepp. . .I do think so. . .

good thing I hold back pretty well. . .hehe. . .

Oh my god, I am so exhausted but happy, I danced for 5 hours straight at =
the Tribal Flux psytrance party in Oakland tonight. It was great fun!

The party was at the Noodle Factory, and it was being put on by the raw =
heaven crew. They are trying to raise money for a sound system to be =
used in the upcoming full moon raves (outdoor parties) when the weather =
improves.=20

So, if you weren't there, you missed a fun underground. Good music, good =
people. Also, they had lots of nice artwork that looked fantastic in the =
black lights.

I kept running back and forth between the two rooms of sound, one =
upstairs and one downstairs (psytrance vs. breakbeats). I have to say =
that I really enjoyed the breakbeats, maybe even more than the trance!=20

I guess my musical tastes are changing a bit, although I like all forms =
of EDM. One good thing about this party is that it wasn't too crowded so =
there was room to dance, and I like that a lot.

Anyway, I am off to get some rest, hope I don't get leg cramps this =
morning, I forgot to stretch! I girl at the party told me to eat some =
bananas! (she said they have something that helps you after dancing =
hard).

Greg VP

Jonny,

	Unfortunately AOL and Time Magazine apparently still want people to 
buy into the "false logic" of having to choose between the 
establishment parties, because the only presidential candidates listed 
are President Bush and the Democrats.

Fight the power!

DUH.

i wish the Libertarians and Greens would play dirty to level the 
playing field.  i'd back a lying politician so long as they were 
working for real change...  just goes to show you - principles will get 
you very little in today's political game.

  ugh!

awesome time. it was great seeing some SFR people there and wearing a

first time again. i even had my prom picture taken again. (btw...url for

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Forever Young THANK YOU; & online sets

Big ups to the TL crew for this party...my girl and I had mad fun!!! That
punch was fucking EVIL tho. *ouch*

Just like the 80's I remember so well!!

It was nice to see the few people I know out and about, and meet some new
people that I've wanted to meet (Apollo and some others...hello!).

Spanx for the memories folks!

Preliminary findings suggest there was a LOT of alcohol involved:

<http://homepage.mac.com/shawn.allen/ForeverYoung/>

I had such a blast taking these photos, and playing such a jumbled mess
of 80's tunes for you crazy people last night. Thanks for getting such a
great group of people together, Shelley!

Mixes are forthcoming... unfortunately somebody closed my laptop at some
point, so some of it was lost. I also had to leave part of the way
through Brandon's set, so the rest of the night remained unrecorded.
Sorry! I'll post an URL once I get around to cleaning it up.

Cheers,

Just to make sure credit goes where credit's due.  TL just rented out
the space.  The bulk of the props go to Shelly and her rag tag crew

ryan, michael, brandon, ray, naru, steve0, shawn and
philip - the cheese oozed, people in lace gloves and
sculpted non-grata aqua net do's wept, the music was
*everything* i had hoped for - THANK YOU.  the sets
were recorded and should be online in mp3 format by
now - a link will be posted soon (unless it already
has and then i'm a dork but whatev ;))

for everyone who came in costume, for everyone who
came with a good vibe, for everyone who came with
their own booze - ROCK THE F*CK ON!  i haven't seen
that much enthusiasm for a costume affair in a long
long long time - here's some of the crowd:

http://homepage.mac.com/shawn.allen/ForeverYoung/

there wasn't enough memory to capture *everyone*, but
that was the original intent, so apologies for those
that didn't get immortalized.

for the record, this wasn't a TL party, it just thrown
at the TL space.  this party was thrown by members of
different crews - all good friends with a common goal
in showing you a good time, and it sounds like our
mission, was like, accomplished!  jessi, delia, osby,
amber, audra, erica, erik, aaron & philip - you all
make me feel fuzzy :)

thanks again everyone, i've got a week of sleep to
catch up on, so later ;)

I read it. I remember your white civic well. If you're going to get into
racing, course racing, I suggest hooking up with the local SCCA autocross
circuit. I went to 2 of their events and everyone there was super cool. Lots
of fun to take a ride in someone else's car that's a lot better driver. You
learn a lot real quick and get a thrill ride. =D

yeah I kinda figured that message would be just boring as FUCK, unless
you're just into that stuff like that, but after I was done writing it I
noticed there was a lot of work put into that and even tho it was kind of a
pointless "me thinking out loud" sorta thing I just put too much effort into
all of that to just delete it. . .

i think i write my thoughts more than I ever say them. . .

hmm. . .

yepp. . .I do think so. . .

good thing I hold back pretty well. . .hehe. . .

Big ups to everyone who was involved in making this happen...You said it
Calamity...I haven't seen a 'costume' party rock that hard in a while. Me
and the Mrs. had such a good time. I don't know if the people were as cool
as the music which was as cool as the decorations which was as cool as the
punch which was as cool as the people (you get the point?)

I am gonna go out on a limb and say that this will go down as one of the
best parties of 2004. You guys rock!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] *Forever Young* Gracias Muchachos!

All I can say is that I rarely go out anymore due to parties just lacking
energy and quality. I had a fucking blast at the 80's party. What really did
it for me were the people that came. To see so many people actually put in
the effort to dress up blew me away. Usually if you go to a themed party you
get a handful of people that dress up while the rest don't bother. I'd say
90% of the ~200 people there were dressed up! Now toss in the excitement and
happiness that was flowing through the place and you got yourself one hell
of a night. It was great to see damn near all of my friends under one roof
again. Seems like that occurance happens about 4 times a year at best and
gets harder and harder to pull off.

It kinda scared me how I knew the lyrics to nearly everything played. Yeah
I'm definitely a child of the 80's. Osby needs to become a hair dresser and
go to beauty school. Doesn't that job just fit him perfectly?? You should
see the pictures and look at my gf's hair. That was complements of Osby.
Apparently Michael and Eric were getting their freak on while I was playing.
I just remember Eric stripping my wife beater off me. Kinda had to pay
attention to what I was doing since I had some technical issues that didn't
allow me to have any cue function. Go spinning with no headphones! haha.

Much love to all in the Retro group that made this happen and especially to
Shelley who masterminded the event. It worked out better than I think we
could have imagined! The place looked great from the 80's toys to the Kudos
and the special *spiked* punch that was made. I'll toss out a thank you to
the TL people for gritting their teeth and putting up with some bad 80's
music in their place. Much appreciated for your hospitality.

I'll post my pictures in a bit. I'm cringing at the thought of hearing my
set....

So...I will warn everyone that I am a total Creamer groupie, so getting =
to see them together was a major thing for me!

Showed up about 10:30 or so with a friend of mine and first thing I =
noticed was, there was nooo line...place was dead. With VIP pass in hand =
was ushered through the security probe without incident. Entered the =
club and grabbed a few cocktails. Some nice breaks going on in the main =
room...went to the restroom and on my way out started laying down flyers =
for the progression event. Some security guy saw me and said, 'hey, what =
party is that for?", I said for a monthly at 26Mix. He collected all the =
flyers I laid down and told me I couldn't pass anything out unless it =
was for 1015....um Hello2Day? I was completely floored; what do you mean =
I can't promote my party? They place was wallpapered with 1015 flyers, =
how was little ol me gonna take away from that? Anyway, my party is on a =
totally different night..Anyway, I was pissed. WAY TO SUPPORT THE SCENE =
1015...So I headed upstairs and still set flyers down...then the guy who =
sweeps up, started throwing my shit away...at that point, I was =
determined to beat these guys. I clocked the patterns of the guy who =
traveled through the rooms and followed behind him laying my stuff =
down...Even if my flyers were exposed to one person I felt value in =
that..so it was kind of a little game for me...Even though the flyers =
only lasted about 10 minutes in anyone location..I did see people =
picking them up, so that was cool.

Then the main room opened. Mr. Ojeda laid a nice little warm-up set =
down, playing a lot of the new tunes that have been coming out as of =
late. Great vibe. I enjoyed it even more because the club was =
empty...only about 80 people in any one room at any given point. So, =
tons of space to dance and chill. So there I am with beer in hand, and =
who do I see? Why my man JC! Great to see a familiar face. So we start =
rappin and this etard totally pukes right in front of us...like c'mon =
sweetie it's only 10:30 slow down. We had a good laugh about that. =
Always funny to see a girl dressed to kill, with her Ibiza shades on, =
all down up totally ralphing..how lady like. ;)

The moment of truth came at 1:30 when Mr. Creamer entered the booth. Him =
and K setup their Apply laptop and ran a mixer right from the comp. =
Hadn't seen that before. Unfortunately, the comp crashed in the middle =
of the 3rd song. I think this was a turning point, 'cause I am guessing =
that they were gonna play some new material, but after that it was =
mostly cd's and vinyl for the remainder of the night. So, I don't think =
what they played was the 'intended set'. Regardless it was throbbing =
progressive onslaught. Stayed on the floor until about 3:30 and them me =
legs just about fell off. So had to call it a night.=20

To make it even better, I totally got to meet them...really nice guys. =
So with Demo in hand, I passed it along to them [finger's crossed]. Be =
nice to get some feedback from them, so we will see. Overall had a =
blast. The only negative thing, is ONCE again, the asshole security and =
them hatin' on other parties. It is inconceivable how a place can say =
they support EDM, and then not allow exposure for local dj's. Definitely =
bad karma for those guys.=20

Hahaha I had a lot of fun too- but everyone's track
selection makes me curious-

Am I the only weirdo who was listening mainly to Rap
in the 80's?
I mean, I dug on some New Order and Depesche Mode back
then but most of my listening was Public Enemy, NWA,
Ice-T, MC Hammer, Beastie Boys, 2-live Crew, Too
Short, Rob Base, Fresh Prince kinda stuff. From
1986-1990 that was it.

Then I got in to the older shit- Grandmaster Flash etc
just to see where it all came from.
And a little Metallica too hahahh :)

My bad...it was still a baddass time, and the hostess was constantly making

would go to 3.05.04 Sparks, NV @ New Oasis the only reason is this... they said on 
Fuse TV. "everone and anyone that has are new CD or Record we will hang out

Subject: Re: [sfraves] *Forever Young* Gracias Muchachos!

Amoungst the people that played that night it would seem like it. But then
again we were going for 80's cheese and the only think I liked about 80's
rap was the crude nature of some of it. Nothing that really did anything for
me musically.

Hahaha I had a lot of fun too- but everyone's track
selection makes me curious-

Am I the only weirdo who was listening mainly to Rap
in the 80's?
I mean, I dug on some New Order and Depesche Mode back
then but most of my listening was Public Enemy, NWA,
Ice-T, MC Hammer, Beastie Boys, 2-live Crew, Too
Short, Rob Base, Fresh Prince kinda stuff. From
1986-1990 that was it.

Then I got in to the older shit- Grandmaster Flash etc
just to see where it all came from.
And a little Metallica too hahahh :)

eh, i definitely tried to push for le tigre and bunny,
*definitely* more 2livecrew - steve0 dropped some LL

Subject: Re: [sfraves] *Forever Young* Gracias Muchachos!

i was going to do oldskool rap and hip hop - actually brought
some with me.  but i decided at the last second not to.  eh -
no reason, i guess it was just that i wanted to spin entirely
on decks, and half of my hip hop is on CD.  :)

no, you were not the only wierdo.  i too was mostly into hip hop from 86 on 
(hence, my psuedo LL-Run DMC-adidas outfit).

was too drunk at 3am to remember that i had Gangsta Gangsta in my record bag 
and too technically inept to attempt to play It Takes Two, Me So Horny and 
the Dream Team off the CDs i brought.

*singings* isn't a word. I think you mean signing as in *signing your cd*
Your prior post had me lost as well, but now I just see it's a matter of
spelling.

Subject: [sfraves] Free Party!!! (bsp) Oneiromancy Feb 6th

hi folks.

I'm going to be playing at a party this Friday from 10pm-11pm. Come early!!! 
I'm giving away copies of my demo. Peace!

-Paul
dj_choco@hotmail.com
http://www.prolificdjs.com
-----------------------------------------------------

Oneiromancy.02.06.04.

Due to a high demand, there is a very limited number of reserved tickets to 
this party. Because the event is first-come, first-serve, a lot of people 
who work late or can't get to the venue early have asked for this. A reserve 
ticket is $5, and will guarantee you a spot.

If you don't want to pay, you still have that option, but we will close off 
the party when it hits capacity, no matter what.

If you want to buy a reserve ticket, you can visit http://www.wavelength.dj 
, and pay by paypal.

Philip,

	This is the problem: If they're willing to lie and manipulate the 
voters in order to get into office, they're probably NOT going to be 
working for real change. Once they've abandoned integrity to that 
extent, even as a means to a higher end, they'll likely find the 
rewards offered by playing along too enticing to buck the system in a 
major way.

	It's like expecting that a promoter who's been putting his efforts 
into building a big following all year by throwing soulless, 
commercial, indiscriminately promoted massives with the usual thuggish 
security, music catering to the lowest common denominator, dubious 
business practices, etc., is suddenly going to come through with a 
terrific low-cost New Year's Eve underground with loving people and a 
great vibe.

Groove on,
						<<< Starchild >>>

Subject: [sfraves] Forever Young!!!

--=====================_20350342==.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

Major props to Shelley for throwing this kick-ass party!!!  This was her 
first go at creating and producing an event, and I think she did a 
magnificent job.  For those of you who may not know Shelley she is a 
Renaissance woman:  an artist; singer (she studied opera); accomplished DJ 
(aka Calamity Jane); and now successful party giver.

I had a wonderful time at "Forever Young."  It was a really relaxing 
evening for me socializing with a multitude of old friends and meeting some 
new people in the flesh, like Marc(O).  I was literally loved right down to 
the floor by one friend I haven't seen for awhile a few minutes after I 
arrived:)

The music was all much fun, and reminded me how many "pop" tunes that 
received radio play in those days actually made it to the dance floor.  I 
would like to have heard some hip hop and much more industrial but 
hey...not complaining.  Especially liked Philip, Redstickman, and Shawn's sets.

It's always refreshing to revisit the past.  There is an associative 
quality to old music that brings a flood of memories to the fore...for 
better or worse.  Although the eighties was not one of my favorite decades, 
EDM was "invented" then and last month marked the twentieth anniversary of 
the release of the first house recording, "On and On" (January, 1984).

Thank you, Shelley, and your most excellent crew, for taking us all on this 
musical trip to the past.

Love,

Apollo

So, most of you got a chance to see me vent last week about buying tunes =
online. Well truth be told I got a lot of response, people pointing me =
in different directions or offering advice. As usual the SFR family is =
there with a solution.

Well one of those solutions was VitalVinyl.com - Now they didn't have =
about 40 of the records I search for, in stock, but they did have about =
7 that I grabbed...So I ordered, figuring I would give it a shot. Well =
today I am sitting at my computer thinking 'Gee, when are my tunes gonna =
come'...I didn't even remember getting the usual email 'o death from =
them saying "well, we only have 1 or your tunes" aka the typical =
satellite records email.=20

So, I logged into my account and THEY SHIPPED ALL MY RECORDS...no "we =
falsely advertised this", or "well it takes 7 days to fill the order." =
They just sent 'em..so we will see. I am not sure if this is the =
solution, but I thought I would share my experience with you =
guys...'cause I know sometimes it seems like I bitch alot, but I also =
like to take the chance to compliment quality =
companies/products/dj's/parties (Yes, forever young ROCKED!)

Also. while their 'samples' are Real Player based...the let you heard =
the entire song, or so at least has been my experience.

Has anyone else 'experienced' this track...f*ck it just makes me smile. =
The rolling bass, the perfection that Jamie created, [o-face], I love =
this track; if you are a tech/electro/tribal/prog, or even a breaks =
influenced dj, I recommend you check it out. This is big room/peak time =
tunes.

Subject: [sfraves] oliver lieb, 1015, this friday 2/6

ok, i know most people on here 1) don't care about oliver lieb and 2) won't 
go to 1015.

in fact, i think me and mr. mike are the only dorks intersted in hearing 
him.  but here's deal for me....i really like Oliver Lieb's production.  
it's good shit.  progressive yet techy, melodic yet deep...a lot of elements 
i like.

so like, i never ever hear of this guy coming to san francisco.  for all i 
know, this is the one and only time he's played in SF in the last 4-5 years 
(i know i've been keeping my ears open for him for atleast the past 3 years 
and have never seen him on a flyer or BSP).  every other DJ i've ever really 
wanted to hear has atleast come through SF in the past couple years (minus 
plump djs and stanton warriors).  so now oliver lieb finally comes.

1015 on friday.  i'm tempted.  *sigh*  anyone want to go with me?

Yes, This is an exclusive chance to catch Oliver in SF. Even if you hate
1015..which most everyone does...do not let that make you miss Oliver.
Because, if you do, then 'they' win.

Hmmm, where have I heard this artist's name before? Perhaps from some TRANCE
mp3 downloads? Is this correct? A trance DJ?

I like trance, why does it get a bad rap? OH never mind, sfr, DON'T respond
to that query!
(we don't need another thread on trance vs. anything else)

But this event sounds like fun to me....anyone else? C'mon, Brandon needs
some peeps on the floor beside him!

What's the cover at 1015 for events like this anyway?

Sorry Warren, 1015 is a 21+.......As for Oliver Lieb.......He is f****** sick!! He has done some Colaboration with Mars and Mystre, he has also worked with Paul Van Dyke on some pretty cool shit if I'm not mistaken as well.  Dude he's been around for days too. Anyone with the capasity to go see him you, definitly should.

I like trance, why does it get a bad rap? OH never mind, sfr, DON'T respond
to that query!
(we don't need another thread on trance vs. anything else)

But this event sounds like fun to me....anyone else? C'mon, Brandon needs
some peeps on the floor beside him!

What's the cover at 1015 for events like this anyway?

ok, i know most people on here 1) don't care about oliver lieb and 2) won't
go to 1015.

in fact, i think me and mr. mike are the only dorks intersted in hearing
him. but here's deal for me....i really like Oliver Lieb's production.
it's good shit. progressive yet techy, melodic yet deep...a lot of elements
i like.

so like, i never ever hear of this guy coming to san francisco. for all i
know, this is the one and only time he's played in SF in the last 4-5 years
(i know i've been keeping my ears open for him for atleast the past 3 years
and have never seen him on a flyer or BSP). every other DJ i've ever really
wanted to hear has atleast come through SF in the past couple years (minus
plump djs and stanton warriors). so now oliver lieb finally comes.

1015 on friday. i'm tempted. *sigh* anyone want to go with me?

Subject: RE: [sfraves] oliver lieb, 1015, this friday 2/6

Oliver is one of the best deejays of all time. IMO the best ever when it 
comes to combination of studio & deejay skills. I've never heard someone 
with such propper studio skills that is actually a phenominal deejay as 
well. Plus he (and his many alias' have the longest list of production 
credits that I have ever seen)
>From what I have heard of him, I would not expect much of his trancey stuff. 
Oliver has always played well-paced techno and housey techno in my 
experience. And played it well.
Although I have not heard him in a few years now...

AUDi,
Gavin

Anyone who is interested there is going to be a Double-IPA (9.0% ABV or =
above) Festival at "The Bistro" in Hayward this Saturday and Sunday from =
noon till whenever, each day. Your truly get's to help man the taps, =
which is kind of like letting the convicts run the prison. There is also =
going to be live music, mostly local blues and rock bands. So, if you =
dig the ales, come through.

Oh, yh, the Bistro is located at 1001 B Street in Hayward. It is on the =
corner of B Street and Main.

2. I would and do. (I'm not a raver elitist)

It should be a great show, Oliver Lieb is top notch.

--0-218318598-1075834425=:99055
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

So I have decided to try and make it out to the West Coast for Spring Break this year (March 15-19). I am actually looking to transfer schools and try and make a living on the West Coast, but I thought Id stop by during spring break and check it all out.  Any party suggestions, where to stay, what to do during the day, etc etc?
 
Thanks to all :)

Not sure what the cover is for that particular night, but I was there 
last month for Talla 2XLC on a sat night and it was ***free b4 10:30pm***.

It appears to me that they're free b4 10:30pm in general (except 
holidays, presumably), so u might wanna look into that.

Man. I wish. This girl made me go to a fucking baby-massive in SF instead.
Whatever - had fun, missed out on the crazy hippies though... ah well. ;)

I DID get to see AK1200, who I've never seen before. That was dope. Had me
dancing through his entire ~2hr set. The rest of the party kinda sucked,
though. Kelly's mission rock is a craphole, and the crowd as uber cheese.
Not to mention they jacked us on admission.

I don't even remember the name of the party, or the name of the krews that
threw it. Totally unmemorable, aside from AK.

The moral of this story, kids? Stick with the underground. :b

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Went to the psytrance party in Oakland (tribal flux)

Kelly's Mission Rock isn't a crap hole at all. I've been to a Thump party
there and it was completely done up. I've also been there for a big
collaborative party between rythm method, cloudfactory, and fnf which was
TOTALLY done up. Now crappy there for the drugs and *to go party* types.

It really comes down to the crowd. You could throw a party in the biggest
shit hole of a venue (think run down) but if you bring in a crowd that's
there for the music and each other and have a solid lineup then all is good.
The venue just becomes background. To say that KMR is a craphole because the
crowd and music sucked isn't fair or accurate.

I go out based on the crowd that will be at the event. If I know a promoter
tends to draw a crowd that I don't like I stay away. Know your promoters and
the type of events they throw and the crowd they cater to.

Oh and I think it was that quasi-wmc event that was getting plastered all
over SFRaves. Wasn't it bayraves (feat. members of coolworld) put the event
on?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Went to the psytrance party in Oakland (tribal flux)

Actually some promoter guys from Arizona I believe.. - Surreal Entertainment 
or something like that. I played for these guys with Michael Liu in AZ when 
they did an Earthdance benefit in 2000. Great show down there and they 
treated us well.

I played at Kelly's late on Saturday night in the downstairs house/trance 
room after Reckless Ryan, who (on a different note) is pretty damn reckless 
if I do say so myself... somehow he turned off all the speakers except for 
the monitor for about 5 minutes, and then very shortly after that, he 
dropped the mixer off the table and onto his feet, unplugging everything in 
the process.. there was dead sound for about 10 minutes until Michael Liu 
saved the day and plugged everything back in.. The crowd had pretty much 
lost interest by that point.. I'm not really sure what happened, but I 
didn't have any technical issues at all during my set. Mike played after me 
and did fine too.

but anyway, I agree that Kelly's isn't a craphole and also agree that a 
party (or at least it's vibe) is all in the crowd. I wasn't there long.. but 
it didn't seem they did too bad for their first SF venture.. (judging purely 
on numbers - I was there to create vibe and I'd like to think I did a good 
job with what I had to work with). Overall, I think the party certainly 
lacked the vibe of an intimate rocker like Forever Young.. but you often do 
with 4 rooms of different music.

{btw, I recorded my set if anyone wants to hear it.. raw, unedited, bumps, 
skips and all.. it's heavier house with a bit-o-breaks... email me for a 
CD.}

Get House,

-Justin Hale

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Went to the psytrance party in Oakland (tribal flux)

My mistake. Hearing crap like this is what disenchants me more and more with
the general masses out in the party world. For the most part it seems it's a
reckless bunch that comes to get fucked up and leave. I now know that a more
underground, limited promotion based event is all I want. I'm not even going
to compare this event with the 80's party. Completely different animals. I
could compare the event you played at to the fund raiser at SomArts this
past summer that FnF put on. Multi-room with lots of space that would
normally thin out a crowd or kill a vibe. Difference being the people that
attend events like the FnF party create such an amazing energy that you
never feel a room is lacking.

It's like window shopping. They only see what's in that big store window.

Sorry you had to be a part of that mess!

Actually some promoter guys from Arizona I believe.. - Surreal Entertainment
or something like that. I played for these guys with Michael Liu in AZ when
they did an Earthdance benefit in 2000. Great show down there and they
treated us well.

I played at Kelly's late on Saturday night in the downstairs house/trance
room after Reckless Ryan, who (on a different note) is pretty damn reckless
if I do say so myself... somehow he turned off all the speakers except for
the monitor for about 5 minutes, and then very shortly after that, he
dropped the mixer off the table and onto his feet, unplugging everything in
the process.. there was dead sound for about 10 minutes until Michael Liu
saved the day and plugged everything back in.. The crowd had pretty much
lost interest by that point.. I'm not really sure what happened, but I
didn't have any technical issues at all during my set. Mike played after me
and did fine too.

but anyway, I agree that Kelly's isn't a craphole and also agree that a
party (or at least it's vibe) is all in the crowd. I wasn't there long.. but
it didn't seem they did too bad for their first SF venture.. (judging purely
on numbers - I was there to create vibe and I'd like to think I did a good
job with what I had to work with). Overall, I think the party certainly
lacked the vibe of an intimate rocker like Forever Young.. but you often do
with 4 rooms of different music.

{btw, I recorded my set if anyone wants to hear it.. raw, unedited, bumps,
skips and all.. it's heavier house with a bit-o-breaks... email me for a
CD.}

Get House,

I have the same issues.  Emails with some fuckin' "Banned CD," as well as 
penis enlargement methods.  If mine were any bigger I couldn't find condoms 
to fit:)  Actually, if I could buy these people off I would, but I think 
there are larger issues here.  Viruses take over email addys and bombard 
all of us with this crap.  The gibberish is designed to defeat spam catchers.

Love,

Apollo

Subject: [sfraves] SFLNC:  Support Later Last Call Hours

--=====================_1813798==.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

WHAT:  1. Write an email in support of extending last call hours for alcohol
              2. Come to the hearing at the Board of Supervisors

WHEN: 1. Write the email now to the addresses listed below.
             2. Come to the hearing on Thursday, Feb 5th at 9:30 am.
                 <http://sfgov.org/site/bdsupvrs_page.asp?id=13954>http://sfgov.org/site/bdsupvrs_page.asp?id=13954

WHERE:  City Services Committee of the Board of Supervisors, City Hall, Rm. 263

The SFLNC needs your support for a proposal that could have huge benefits 
for the entertainment scene in San Francisco.

Supervisor Aaron Peskin has introduced a resolution encouraging State 
Assemblymember Mark Leno to develop legislation that could extend the last 
call for alcohol in bars, restaurants and nightclubs in California's 
largest Cities.  This will give San Franciscans and visitors to our City 
similar rights to those enjoyed in New York, Chicago, Miami, New Orleans 
and other large cities that allow alcohol sales after 2am.  This will also 
provide a much needed boost to our local entertainment scene and economy.

The SFLNC first introduced this resolution at the Entertainment Commission, 
which voted unanimously to support it.  Please read the resolution 
here:(<http://sfgov.org/site/uploadedfiles/bdsupvrs/committees/materials/040057.pdf>http://sfgov.org/site/uploadedfiles/bdsupvrs/committees/materials/040057.pdf).

In your email to our elected officials, it is crucial to include in the 
subject line the words "Support Later Last Call Hours".  Supervisors do not 
always read every email but they do count those for and against an 
issue.  If you wish to contact your District Supervisor by phone or fax, 
contact info is available at: 
<http://www.sfgov.org/site/bdsupvrs_index.asp>http://www.sfgov.org/site/bdsupvrs_index.asp

Here are some important points about this proposal:

* Later last call hours will help to keep San Francisco a world class city

* Later last call hours will create additional revenue for the city and the 
state of California

* San Franciscans should have the same rights as those in other major cities

* National Traffic Safety Association data indicates that later last call 
hours do not increase and may actually decrease the number of alcohol 
related traffic fatalities.

* This proposal applies ONLY to on-site alcohol sales at restaurants, bars, 
or nightclubs

* This proposal DOES NOT allow alcohol sales after 2am in supermarkets or 
liquor stores

* This proposal applies ONLY to restaurants, bars or nightclubs in 
districts zoned for late night businesses.

* This proposal DOES NOT override any local zoning controls.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] SFLNC:  Support Later Last Call Hours

heya

hmmm. . . not that I don't support the SFLNC. . . most people know I do. . .

but one of the last things I'd ever support would be anything regarding
alcohol, or something that lets people drink MORE.

I think (or would guess) that the reason there is a "last call" for alcohol,
and restrictions on selling alcohol after certain hours, would be for the
safety of the public.
Realistically, these limitations are a somewhat sensible time to have people
stop drinking. More than likely tho, even with those times, people still end
up driving home under the influence and are much much much more likely to
hurt or kill any random innocent person on their obviously compromised drive
home.

with the amount of drunken driving these days. . . the last thing anyone
really needs is to increase the likelihood of drunken accidents.
I understand it may help the entertainment scene in SF. I just think it's
just plain stupid to trade the potential lives of people for clubs to make
more money.

shit, everyone knows that one of the worst times to leave a party, is right
when everone else is. With people drunk or on whatever, and the mass of them
trying to go wherever at the same time, it can be a kind of dangerous chaos
at times. No wonder every time I would go to a club or party, someone ALWAYS
hit my car. . .

I would hope that this attempt from the SFLNC isn't fueled by "donations"
from people who would no doubt benefit from the passing of something like
this. Too many people these days "sell out" for money. Not enuf people these
days give a shit about the people they hurt doing it.

I'm not a drinker, I hate alcohol. I've seen and been in cars with
inebriated drivers and thankfully survived those experiences of going off
the road, etc. I see people do horrible and stupid things due to alcohol
moreso than any drug I've ever known of.

Its similar to how the US covers up issues with things like tainted meat,
etc. Because they gain financially from the distribution of it. It's all a
very saddening thought.

No matter what anyone says, the people involved supporting issues that lead
to the destruction of lives and health of others are majorely the ones with
the "bloody hands". Thats not saying that I don't support peoples freedom to
decide for themselves. But bars and clubs are the "pushers" of one of the
most dangerous chemicals used every day. And it's legal, despite the damage
it does. Why ? Cuz it makes them money. . .

I think it's a badd idea, and if I lived in SF I would write to my district
supervisor in support AGAINST it. Other than that tho, I'm all for
supporting clubs in ANY OTHER WAY (of which are many).

I certainly understand your concerns, ak.  But the data suggests that 
extended hours for serving alcohol at clubs do not increase the rate of 
accidents and even may decrease the number of booze-related accidents 
(National Traffic Safety Association).

There are now a number of venues in the city with after hours 
arrangements.  Personally, I rarely attend club events these days.  Prefer 
the underground.  I drink very little and when I do I take a cab.  There is 
little in this for me, but I believe the consumer should be able to decided 
what he/she wants to do with free time and money, rather than be dictated 
to by some paternalistic government authority.  Further, I'd like to see 
more venues where I can dance into the wee hours with my bottle of water:)

Bottom line:  if you drive drunk at any time you're a fool.  I've been hit 
by drunken drivers twice -- both times during the afternoon hours.

Love,

Apollo

My friend Greg Wilson in the UK just published this interesting article on 
David Mancuso.  Greg was and is one of the innovators of electro funk.

DAVID MANCUSO AND THE ART OF DEEJAYING WITHOUT DEEJAYING
<http://www.gsmag.net/David_Mancuso/David_Mancuso.htm>http://www.gsmag.net/David_Mancuso/David_Mancuso.htm

This has just been included on GrandSlams website. I'd like to thank David 
Mancuso and also Tim Lawrence, the author of 'Love Saves The Day', for 
reading through it, in order for me to be double-sure that the factual 
detail was all correct. It was obviously important to me that the piece, 
which looks at the direct link between disco culture and the psychedelic 
60's, received David's full blessing.

Love,

Apollo

AK,

	While your concerns about alcohol are valid, that's not a reason to  
support the morality police! Things like education and peer counseling  
are the best ways to get people to drink responsibly, not heavy-handed  
laws. Those don't stop anyone, they only create a black market and  
waste resources. See more specific comments below...

	But AK, if you'd check out the resolution, it addresses this issue by  
pointing out that there is no indication that letting bars stay open  
later results in more drunk driving fatalities. If they could stay open  
all night, then people wouldn't be forced to leave and could stay until  
they had a chance to sober up, or until more public transit options  
were running in the morning or it was safer to walk home in the  
daylight.

	Actually drunken driving accidents are way down.

	It's not about money to me, it's about the right to make one's own  
choices as an adult and not have government treat us like irresponsible  
children.

	No kidding! If there wasn't such an early closing time, fewer people  
would be trying to leave all at once!

	There is also the matter of the profits that government agencies like  
Alcohol & Beverage Control make by having more regulations to enforce.  
The regulations justify more personnel and funding for them (at our  
expense).

	If they were allowed to sell less dangerous drugs like marijuana and  
magic mushrooms, then they wouldn't have to rely on alcohol so much to  
stay in business.

	Well, one other good way to support our rights is to ask your elected  
representatives to let promoters who have an agreement with the owner  
of a space put on a party or event there without having to beg  
permission from the authorities.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] nrr: email viruses. . .damn them

Actually, given the targets of the DOS attacks being launched by the 
two variants of this new "mydoom" virus, for the first time in quite a 
while I actually found myself wishing that I *DID* still have a peecee 
to get infected.

But, alas, being a Mac user, mydoom (and the chance to do my part to 
blast sco off the 'net) passed me by.  Then again, so did sobig, the 
love bug, melissa, and all the rest.

Funny thing...  out of curiosity one day, I opened up the list of 
viruses that my (Mac version, of course) copy of Norton scans for.  
Almost all of them are pc viruses which, should they somehow have 
gotten on my Mac in the first place, would have done exactly nothing to 
me.  But Norton was scanning for them anyway.  I guess they figure that 
an AV program has to do SOMETHING to earn its keep, even if that 
something is totally superfluous.

What this says to me is that too many whites are getting away with drug
use, too many whites are getting away with drug sales, too many whites
are getting away with trafficking in this stuff. The answer to this
disparity is not to start letting people out of jail because we're not
putting others in jail who are breaking the law. The answer is to go out
and find the ones who are getting away with it, convict them and send
them up the river, too."

Subject: Re: [sfraves] SFLNC:  Support Later Last Call Hours

heya

however much I disagree with laws in general, ones that are more pointed to
moderate a use of something rather than ban it all together actually
sometimes make sense to some extent.
I totally agree and support drug awareness/education. DanceSafe was one
organization with one of the absolute best missions i've ever seen in the
party world.
But if you think about it, whats supposed to happen to limit the negative
effects caused by people who aren't educated, soon to be educated, or maybe
never will be educated on the subject ? Like neither can ever fully replace
the other.

What is the real gain from extending drinking hours ?
More get drunk time ?
More money for the clubs ?
Really, if you think about it. If a club is still successfully open, and has
been for a long period of time. . . why are all of these people in support
of giving some person MORE money ? If it was a lil club that was barely
making it. . .is extending the drinking hours in that establishment going to
massively increase it's customer base, or it's income ?
You would think it's more money for the community. . . but it's more money
for the club, and less for the surrounding income based groups/orgs.
What good does it do for the community as a whole ?

it doesn't make sense to me. . .basically it's a business and not a govmt
related idea. It wasn't designed for your average corner store, but just
restaraunts and clubs (basically), so in reality it's only helping increase
the income of "some" community businesses. Why sell liquor after 2 or
whatever, where someone could walk immediately out from a drink and drive
away. . .when the store across the street can't, even tho the person would
face a more serious violation (open container + this etc) and (unless they
drank it on the way to their car) would not be drunk, alcohol can't be
sitting next to you, etc (not to mention the amount of minors in clubs who
drink, vs the difficulty buying from a store)?
If I was a storekeeper I'd feel it was very unfair.

It's not increasing any individuals freedom or right to do as they like with
their body. It's about regulating businesses to be responsible, and limit
the negative effects of a business on the surrounding community (considering
the mass amount of people frequenting). A small company can do a huge amount
of damage or a huge amount of good for a community. But regardless the
business should act upon a basic set of standards in place to protect the
surrounding area and more.

yes people should be responsible for themselves. . . of course. But even the
most responsible person has been irresponsible before, everybody has. But
this isn't an initiative pushing the education of drinking on the clubs
(which would make hell of a lot more sense than MORE drinking). . . it's an
initiative extending the supporting for drinking itself, not the education,
not the safer use of, but something to let people do as always, but for
longer. Which btw makes club and establishment owners who already make
money, make MORE money.

Supporting the clubs is all well and good. But if anything. . . why isn't
there an initiative on clubs by the SFLNC or someone that people support,
that requires some sort of education materials and services (including
required knowledge or testing for personnel handling/working with such
materials) by businesses dealing with those products ?
How many clubs have first aid kits ? Or trained cpr techs or anything near
that on hand ?
How many clubs or restaraunts do you know of that have any materials
promoting the safe use of alcohol, and not the "drink me" type ads ? (btw I
know these things have been tried, but not backed as much and afterwards
failed)

If I was a teacher. . .I'd give the kids instructions on how to use the
sharp object safely before I extended their playtime with it. . .

Community support organizations need to lay their own path, they need to
quit following ideas which are "mutually beneficial", and they need to risk
themselves and their word for the things that they actually believe in. The
whole things too political, when it shouldn't be.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] SFLNC:  Support Later Last Call Hours

It's really easy...there are some of us thank drink responsibly that might
like to have cocktails AFTER 2am. I don't see what's so wrong about that. If
you think about it, if bars close later, people are less rushed to hammer
drinks before an early close time, at least that's the way *I* look at it.

there BIOS's and learn more about there background and how they found the love 
in mixing music...

they can get more time on playing events then they do now ... well not to 
point fingers in am in the process of making my site ... the url for mine is

The libertarian in me tells me that I don't agree with your position =
because:

1. We need to promote personal responsibility, our culture likes to =
blame everything except the person commiting the crime.
2. We need less governmental control over our lives and decisions.

heya

hmmm. . . not that I don't support the SFLNC. . . most people know I do. =
. .

but one of the last things I'd ever support would be anything regarding
alcohol, or something that lets people drink MORE.

I think (or would guess) that the reason there is a "last call" for =
alcohol,
and restrictions on selling alcohol after certain hours, would be for =
the
safety of the public.
Realistically, these limitations are a somewhat sensible time to have =
people
stop drinking. More than likely tho, even with those times, people still =
end
up driving home under the influence and are much much much more likely =
to
hurt or kill any random innocent person on their obviously compromised =
drive
home.

with the amount of drunken driving these days. . . the last thing anyone
really needs is to increase the likelihood of drunken accidents.
I understand it may help the entertainment scene in SF. I just think =
it's
just plain stupid to trade the potential lives of people for clubs to =
make
more money.

shit, everyone knows that one of the worst times to leave a party, is =
right
when everone else is. With people drunk or on whatever, and the mass of =
them
trying to go wherever at the same time, it can be a kind of dangerous =
chaos
at times. No wonder every time I would go to a club or party, someone =
ALWAYS
hit my car. . .

I would hope that this attempt from the SFLNC isn't fueled by =
"donations"
from people who would no doubt benefit from the passing of something =
like
this. Too many people these days "sell out" for money. Not enuf people =
these
days give a shit about the people they hurt doing it.

I'm not a drinker, I hate alcohol. I've seen and been in cars with
inebriated drivers and thankfully survived those experiences of going =
off
the road, etc. I see people do horrible and stupid things due to alcohol
moreso than any drug I've ever known of.

Its similar to how the US covers up issues with things like tainted =
meat,
etc. Because they gain financially from the distribution of it. It's all =
a
very saddening thought.

No matter what anyone says, the people involved supporting issues that =
lead
to the destruction of lives and health of others are majorely the ones =
with
the "bloody hands". Thats not saying that I don't support peoples =
freedom to
decide for themselves. But bars and clubs are the "pushers" of one of =
the
most dangerous chemicals used every day. And it's legal, despite the =
damage
it does. Why ? Cuz it makes them money. . .

I think it's a badd idea, and if I lived in SF I would write to my =
district
supervisor in support AGAINST it. Other than that tho, I'm all for
supporting clubs in ANY OTHER WAY (of which are many).

Behringer makes a nice business out of ripping off technology from their
rivals and using it to build nearly identical products. I'd suggest
going with neither: the Pioneer sucks to begin with, for reasons too
numerous to list here. If you want a mixer that'll last you for more
than a couple of years, go with Rane, Vestax, or A&H.

And while I'm not too fond of Pioneer's mixers, I would definitely
recommend their EFX-500 effects processor. Match that with a solid mixer
that has an effects loop (the Rane MP44's is sweet) and you're set.

Good luck,

Subject: Re: [sfraves] What is better ? Behringer DJX 700 or PIONEER DJM-600

Exactly. Remember something - that blinky button the Pioneer is EVIL. It's a
handicap that shitty dj's who can't spin use to cover up their inabilities.
I could shoot any dj that thinks the flange effect needs to be on every mix.
More so if this is going to be an investment that's supposed to last buy a
Rane or Allen and Heath. Fact is when you (if you ever) get to play a large
venue you're going to find a Rane or an Allen and Heath. Suddenly your much
loved effects are gone and you have to actually play without masking a
deficit in skill.

What it comes down to is that neither model of mixer you speak of is durable
nor commonly used except for small clubs or special requests from gimp dj's.

Buy a REAL mixer. Walk away from the effects.

Behringer makes a nice business out of ripping off technology from their
rivals and using it to build nearly identical products. I'd suggest
going with neither: the Pioneer sucks to begin with, for reasons too
numerous to list here. If you want a mixer that'll last you for more
than a couple of years, go with Rane, Vestax, or A&H.

And while I'm not too fond of Pioneer's mixers, I would definitely
recommend their EFX-500 effects processor. Match that with a solid mixer
that has an effects loop (the Rane MP44's is sweet) and you're set.

Good luck,

one word; Pioneer DJM 600 - love is love love. Compared to the Behringer,
there is no comparison

Although I have not seen ANYONE touch on the brand new Allen Heath Xone
92...now there's a mixer...far exceeds anything out right now...

Fav all time mixer had to be the Rane 2016 with rotary knobs and and the EQ
attachment...love that thing. Ya know, I just love good mixer's.

wow!  That thing's fucking Rad!  I'd love to play with the crossfader to see
how sharp/responsive it is... and I'd love to see some S/N specs on it's
output.  If those two check out... it might be the next mixer I get.

Subject: [sfraves]Reclaim the Streets Renegade 

What do y'all have to say about this?  I found it on Groundscore.

Saturday, Feb 14th 2004. Noon. Haight+Stanyan.

Reclaim the Streets San Francisco has planned a street-pirate street-party 
for Valentines Day. Price: FREE!

Show up at Haight and Stanyan in SF, at the top of Haight street where it 
runs into Golden Gate Park. We will meet at 12 Noon (BE ON TIME!) and 
gather, then march to the location of the street party (this will remain 
undisclosed until we get there). Then, fun will ensue.

There will be electronic music (breaks, psytrance, house, maybe more), art, 
poetry, dancing, punk rock, pirates, bicycles, and wacky reclaim the streets 
stunt type things! Be creative, plan our own fun. Also, BYOB.

Watch the rts-sf website (under construction) for promotional materials, and 
help promote this event. Tell your friends, invite your lovers, etc. Also, 
feel free to make your own stickers and flyers, put them up, talk up the 
RTS. (especially at your home!)

Some people refuse to accept personal responsibility.  Didn't you notice 
the homeless?

Governmental control isn't about big brother doing bad things to us.  It's 
about the people getting together and deciding to enact rules for their 
community.  If this legislation goes into effect, it won't override local 
ordinances.

I don't like the extended hours proposal - it seems like a bad idea to me, 
mostly for reasons ak already covered.  We'll see what happens tho..

Wow! There's things I can show you. Just playing records to me is Evil. Now 
I prefer using the EFX500 with a mixer of my choice to the EFX on the DJM600 
(although the EFX500 does not have the DJM600's sample bank & looping 
capabilities) but given the choice of an MP44 with NO outboard effects 
processor and the 600 I'll take the Pioneer every time...

And NO, it has nothing to do with any hadicap and I'de like to think I'm not 
a shitty deejay. I handicap myself everytime I play by playing more records 
AND mixing longer than most jocks that I ever hear do (other than world 
class/ globe-trotting techno talent), my ass is ALWAYS out there on the 
line. All I do is take chances.
Despite the fact that I'm putting in much more work than the average deejay 
that I get to hear, it's still not enough. Still it's just playing records 
and that = borring! I can't scratch all that well so effects are naturaly 
the next step. And the EFX on the DJM's may not be the most versitle, but 
they are a lot better than nothing.

Now when you said...
>I could shoot any dj that thinks the flange effect needs to be on every 
>mix.

... I could not agree with you more. And yes, there are sh@tty deejays out 
there that do use them to mask thier trouble spots. However it always irks 
me when someone makes the statement that every time someone is using them is 
"cheating" or trying to mask something. You know, I heard some know-it-all 
wannabe superstar saying this about Stacey Pullen at the Transmat Tour in 
2000. And I heard the same type of kid say this about Misstress Barbara a 
couple years ago too. WTF, show me someone with the skill or talent as these 
two and I'll give you a dollar.

I think the key is, it is EVIL to RELY on effects. But it's also EVIL not to 
UTILIZE them if you can do it and do it well...

AUDi,
Gavin

Subject: Re: [sfraves] What is better ? Behringer DJX 700 or PIONEER DJM-600

The problem is that the majority of people that insist on having a 600 abuse
the effects and can't use them well. I see that mixer as a toy and the
effects just as cheesey as those import cars with their stupid shopping cart
wings and ridiculous ground effects. Under the hood in both cases it's all
show with little go.

If Pioneer built that mixer to be a hell of a lot more solid and offered an
effects disable switch I'd be all for it. Of course I'd have that switch
mounted underneath the mixer and expoxied in an off position. =)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] What is better ? Behringer DJX 700 or PIONEER DJM-600 

Effex mixers seem to me to be kind of cheaply thrown together.

I would think a really high quality non effex mixer like a numark pro sm2 or
3, or something like that, with an additional effex controller would be a
much better investment.

all you really need is a 2-3 channel mixer, with high-mid-bass level
control, a good crossfader with adjustable slope (which is kind of a luxury
actually). I've had issues with the less expensive vestax faders, and
absolutely love the numark infinity faders. All the effex are fun but get
pretty played out and cheap sounding really quick.

I have a numark pro sm3, and it retails for about the same price as a
djm600. . . but without all the lil effex.

to me it's like winning a race with a naturally aspirated civic vs the guys
who kinda go the easy way and put turbos on everything. It costs about the
same but the base quality level is just so much higher.

thats prolly why experienced dj's love the Ranes so much, all your money
goes into actual quality instead of the lil bells n whistles. . .

: )

Subject: Re: [sfraves] What is better ? Behringer DJX 700 or PIONEER DJM-600

I think both Behringer and Pioneer suck ass. My DJM 500 was a P.O.S. from
day one. The hardware on them is poorly built, and while it's very "user
friendly", it's just not worth the price tag. Either invest a huge chunk of
dough in a RANE, or invest little (but at least get something vaguely
durable) and get a Vestax.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] What is better ? Behringer DJX 700 or PIONEER DJM-600 

I know I might get shot on here for saying this, but I just love my =
little 2 channel Vestax PCV-002 mixer. I love to mix long 2-3 minute =
transitions and the headphone pre-input fader allows me to keep the =
beats matched perfectly. When I was mixing on the DJM-600 I had to =
quickly get used to hitting a cue switch for the headphones which kept =
me going out of beat while I fixed the headphone level for the cue. To =
make up for this, I now only practice single track monitoring. It's like =
learning all over again.

As for effects: if you know how to use them properly, more power to you. =
As for me I would rather just make my own mix of a track in my studio =
where I have all the time in the world to apply effects to it, edit it, =
then burn it on CD, and play that live.

Effex mixers seem to me to be kind of cheaply thrown together.

I would think a really high quality non effex mixer like a numark pro =
sm2 or
3, or something like that, with an additional effex controller would be =
a
much better investment.

all you really need is a 2-3 channel mixer, with high-mid-bass level
control, a good crossfader with adjustable slope (which is kind of a =
luxury
actually). I've had issues with the less expensive vestax faders, and
absolutely love the numark infinity faders. All the effex are fun but =
get
pretty played out and cheap sounding really quick.

I have a numark pro sm3, and it retails for about the same price as a
djm600. . . but without all the lil effex.

to me it's like winning a race with a naturally aspirated civic vs the =
guys
who kinda go the easy way and put turbos on everything. It costs about =
the
same but the base quality level is just so much higher.

thats prolly why experienced dj's love the Ranes so much, all your money
goes into actual quality instead of the lil bells n whistles. . .

Your analogy is great. A solid built machine that will last a lot longer. I
love forced induction but all the same I love a solid base engine on which
to install that extra zip. much could be said the same about a solid mixer
with the addition of that extra zip of an outboard effects processor...

I still want the now deleted Vestax PMC-25 (or the 250 as it's sometimes
called). It's a nifty little horizontally built mixer, with big honkin'
rotary EQ knobs, kill FADERS (instead of just kill switches, you can slowly
eliminate an entire channel). I don't know what about the mixer I like so
much, but it's rad, and it was never very pricy (maximum price tag of
$349.00)

Anyone wanna sell me one for cheap??? :)

I know I might get shot on here for saying this, but I just love my little 2
channel Vestax PCV-002 mixer. I love to mix long 2-3 minute transitions and
the headphone pre-input fader allows me to keep the beats matched perfectly.
When I was mixing on the DJM-600 I had to quickly get used to hitting a cue
switch for the headphones which kept me going out of beat while I fixed the
headphone level for the cue. To make up for this, I now only practice single
track monitoring. It's like learning all over again.

As for effects: if you know how to use them properly, more power to you. As
for me I would rather just make my own mix of a track in my studio where I
have all the time in the world to apply effects to it, edit it, then burn it
on CD, and play that live.

Effex mixers seem to me to be kind of cheaply thrown together.

I would think a really high quality non effex mixer like a numark pro sm2 or
3, or something like that, with an additional effex controller would be a
much better investment.

all you really need is a 2-3 channel mixer, with high-mid-bass level
control, a good crossfader with adjustable slope (which is kind of a luxury
actually). I've had issues with the less expensive vestax faders, and
absolutely love the numark infinity faders. All the effex are fun but get
pretty played out and cheap sounding really quick.

I have a numark pro sm3, and it retails for about the same price as a
djm600. . . but without all the lil effex.

to me it's like winning a race with a naturally aspirated civic vs the guys
who kinda go the easy way and put turbos on everything. It costs about the
same but the base quality level is just so much higher.

thats prolly why experienced dj's love the Ranes so much, all your money
goes into actual quality instead of the lil bells n whistles. . .

I know what you're tlaking about, it's a groovy house mixer.

Vestax also offers some of the rotary knob level upgrades for other mixers
they sell also, or used to anyways.

DELHI HAS LOTS TO RAVE ABOUT

Will a moon so bright ever arise again? Drink a cupful of wine and ask of
the sky.

I don't know where the palace gate of heaven is, Or even the year in
which tonight slips by .

NEW DELHI : A starry night with the wind still and the moon shining in all
its splendour.

About 800 people gyrating to music at 150 beats a second at a clandestine
location near the Delhi-Gurgaon border in southwest Delhi .

And before you know it, you are one among the crowd, dancing with your
arms in the air, as if nobody knew you.

Nobody does actually.

Welcome to the new-age, psychedelic nirvana or the rave parties where
almost nothing is taboo.

There is unbridled fun though.

Hundreds of people, from anywhere between 15 to 40 years old, high on
drugs like LSD, cocaine, Alprax, acid and marijuana.

Gone are the days when heroin and opium were considered "with it".

And gone are the days when cocaine was available at Rs 2,500-3,000 per
gram in these parties.

"In the last year or so cocaine has become the lifeblood of such
parties.

There is a feeling that you can't enjoy raves if you don't have cocaine
and people are willing to pay as much as Rs 7,000 for a gram," says a
director of an event management company which organises rave parties.

An acid shot now comes at Rs 3,000 and ecstasy pills anywhere between Rs
800 to Rs 1,500.

Another drug which is much in demand these days is Alprax, a mood
enhancer.

The PLUR ( peace, love, unity and respect ) factor, which was coined to
describe the ideal rave vibe, is now beginning to take Delhi by storm.

The parties, the invitations to which are mostly through SMS, web sites or
just by word of mouth, start only after midnight and continue till late in
the morning.

The frenzy of dancing is matched by the electronic dance music, commonly
called techno, which lulls the conscious mind even as it stimulates the
sub-conscious mind and body.
"Even though raves are mainly restricted in Delhi to farmhouses or big
hotels, people here seem to be taking to trance music in a big way.

Most of the young DJs now know how to play it," says Seema Gill, an
associate with a Goa-based DJ.

Naturally, raves are the playground of the rich and the famous.

The organisers, however, tend to disagree.

"There are close to 100 rave parties held during weekends in south Delhi
and Gurgaon.

It's not just models, fashion designers or members of rich industrialist
families now.

Young corporate executives are taking part in a big way," says the
director.

For young executives, raves are fast taking over as a break from their
otherwise dour, competitive lives.

"This is one place where I don't need to watch my back all the time.

I keep coming back not because I can't enjoy the music elsewhere, but
because of the positive energy of the people around me who are allowed to
have more fun here than they would be outside," says Manish Singh, a
manager with a finance company based in Connaught Place.

Concurs Shamita Sachdev, a college-goer, "There is almost a mystical
experience about the meaning of life and death here; an escape from the
world of imperfections.

It's a celebration of life to me."

Most ravers, however, deny the popular perception of these parties as sex
orgies or a place where predatory sexual behaviour is encouraged.

"I think the use of ecstasy which is linked with sexual abandon has
fuelled this perception.

There is nothing to suggest that there are random sexual acts in these
parties, at least not yet," says Sachdev.
Others like Singh, however, believe that fun in any form at the raves is
that keeps them going.

"There is nothing predictable about ravers except for the fact that they
all want to have fun.

What's wrong with it?

OUCH.  That's exactly what I was going to say.  Even Moby's 1,000 BPM
"Thousand" can't match that, and that just sounds like a generator about
to explode.

Kind of sad that cocaine is the "lifeblood" of that scene now, if we're to
believe that article.  Having never taken the stuff, my impression of the
powder comes from "Less Than Zero" and "Scarface"... where the user seems
more likely to jump out of a car or withstand several gunshot wounds
rather than achieve spiritual nirvana through music and dancing.  =\

Efx are nice, but I think they're entirely unneccessary. I say, get a solid
mixer, and leave the efx by the wayside. (unless you get something like an
Electrix analog filter). You should be able to make sort of your own efx
just by doing creative eq'ing. (IMHO)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] News: India has a lot to rave about

"
Hundreds of people, from anywhere between 15 to 40 years old, high on
drugs like LSD, cocaine, Alprax, acid and marijuana.

Gone are the days when heroin and opium were considered "with it".

And gone are the days when cocaine was available at Rs 2,500-3,000 per
gram in these parties.

"In the last year or so cocaine has become the lifeblood of such
parties.
"

..this does nothing to help promote the acceptance of EMD among the
beauracrats, the powers that be, aka whatever you call them. As long as
people continue to describe EDM events as stomping grounds for "your drug of
choice", or a place for a random sexual act, you will continue to see the
opposition try and shut it down. I am disappointed not that there is an
emerging scene in India, that's rad (sorry "forever young" radiation still
pumping through me veins), but that the author had to spend the first half
of the article talking about the drug use, not the great music, or the vibe
that goes on. Wait, sorry, there was one comment about the atmosphere there.

Not everyone who enjoys EDM likes to end up in a puddle by the end of the
night and using this to describe an international/cultural emerging
sub-scene will surely not give those who have never experienced a rave, a
positive connotation about what goes on.

And Please, believe me, I am not trying to turn this into a "Jack's an
elitist" type of thing. "You" want to partake, fine, that is "Your" choice.
But, don't drag down the scene with "you", because "you're" associating with
it...that come out right?

Jack Triumph,

you are talking about this mixer
http://www.allen-heath.com/FullInfo.asp?view=129 Allen & Heathâ€™s Xone:92
RIGHT?

also you talked about this mixer. Rane 2016

well ok those all look very cool and fun to mix on... as well as very
$$coastly$$ oh well i guess you get what you pay for. also how would i go
about FX's?
would i have to buy a hole new pice of machine? or does the ones that are
built into most fixers suck and only have a few FX? i was thinking maybe FX
addons would have more fx's to add then built in ones is this true if so
give me
the 411 and the low down on how to go about finding the best one right now i
am
stuck with a shity mixer and the heads do not even have a button you push to
hear them it sucks my nut's...

Although I have not seen ANYONE touch on the brand new Allen Heath Xone
92...now there's a mixer...far exceeds anything out right now...

Fav all time mixer had to be the Rane 2016 with rotary knobs and and the EQ
attachment...love that thing. Ya know, I just love good mixer's.

Just when you thought fat girls on the phone making money and saying its 
phone sex was excessive, now visit this website and tell me if you think phone sex 
is getting too personal, and by the way, I mean personal...

Cell phones are fun and they have cute little ring tones you can download 
free or pay for off the Internet. They also have nice digital cameras built into 
them, and who can forget how they can even stream video, or better yet, now 
you can record your own video.

Well, this is something I think everyone will "get off" by, and I mean get 
off :-) 

Also, if you guys own one or know someone that does, let me know the feedback 
because I think this toy is weird...

Jack,

	Your suggesting that talk of drug use is somehow a disservice or 
embarrassment to the rave scene likewise does nothing to help promote 
the acceptance of peaceful substance use among the bureaucrats or 
powers that be. Who are you to say that this goal is less valid and 
should have to take a back seat to yours in this community? Not 
everyone who enjoys getting high likes to damage his hearing listening 
to loud music at parties.

Groove on,

Well we know it's the journalist's job to tell the non-biased truth, and this 
article is full of the pro's and con's that come with the rave scene 
everywhere. Granted it might confuse the reader as to weather the article is supposed 
to be "pro rave" or is it trying to expose rave drug abuse and getting them 
shut down. The way I see it, the journalist is just telling the truth about the 
scene in India....   Say they had wrote this article and failed to mention 
that anybody used any kind of drug or mention drugs at all, THEN their senior 
editor went to India to a rave and to their suprise... noticed that lots of 
people were using LSD and cocaine and the likes. That reporter could lose their 
respect, and their job to another less biased more honest and controversial truth 
exposing reporter. Me personally, I find it inspiring to know that raves are 
coming on strong in India, and the extra fact that there are drugs going 
around the raves there too makes a difference in the way I image the story and 
what's happening over there. 
     I just don't think we can blame the journalists for writing a story, if 
we treat them like outsiders and act secretively towards them, they will look 
for what we're hidding (such and drugs, sex etc.) the way to get positive 
media is to impress them and show them a good time. It wasn't always that way... 
but eventually the media became impressed with rock & roll, the media became 
impressed with hip hop, the media became impressed with break dance. It's about 
time the media became impressed with raves, they will start to omit the drug 
scene when we SHOW them the real rave scene, show them something that 
compleately and utterly overshadows the drug scene, just like a rock & roll stage 
overshadows the drug use at concerts.   And then "underground" can simply just 
evolve into something else. Remember... the media is not the cops, the media is a 
powerful weapon that was created to protect us from the gonverment. It's the 
first amendment. A reporter is like a portable recording device that is limited 
by the average american's point of view, if you're well cultured and can 
translate spectrum to spectrum and the rave scene hasn't broken you from all touch 
with the average (yes and somewhat ignorant america), the media can certainly 
be on your side.

What this says to me is that too many whites are getting away with drug
use, too many whites are getting away with drug sales, too many whites
are getting away with trafficking in this stuff. The answer to this
disparity is not to start letting people out of jail because we're not
putting others in jail who are breaking the law. The answer is to go out
and find the ones who are getting away with it, convict them and send
them up the river, too."

KZSU Radio or Stanford University." (or words to that effect.)

SCO is Santa Cruz Operation, a company who sells a unix operating system
(SCO Unix). They claim that code they own was illegally added the Linux
kernel (Linux is a free open source unix compatible operating system), and
are threatening to sue anyone who doesn't pay them a license fee. They've
sued a number of companies, including IBM (for several $billion). Most
people think the lawsuit is frivolous. Try

Yeah I think your right on the money with that Shawn. I have a Rane MP 44 and an EFX 500 and I think its a great combo...... but I still don't really use the EFX all that much, just a little here and there.

Behringer makes a nice business out of ripping off technology from their
rivals and using it to build nearly identical products. I'd suggest
going with neither: the Pioneer sucks to begin with, for reasons too
numerous to list here. If you want a mixer that'll last you for more
than a couple of years, go with Rane, Vestax, or A&H.

And while I'm not too fond of Pioneer's mixers, I would definitely
recommend their EFX-500 effects processor. Match that with a solid mixer
that has an effects loop (the Rane MP44's is sweet) and you're set.

Good luck,

That's just plain old fashioned spam... this latest worm most commonly
has a subject such as "HELLO" or "HI", and no body, just an attachment.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] nrr: email viruses. . .damn them

dude,
I'm STILL getting now like 6-8 emails a day to addresses for my hard-grooves
domain (that don't exist) like bill@hard-grooves.com,
steve@hard-grooves.com, in addition to actual email addy's I have set up. .
. they all have subjects like, TEST, HI, . . .other things. . .

I thought the mydoom virus only sent emails to emails in people's address
books n such, so like why are all these email addresses that I know don't
exist getting emails to them ?

I guess it should go away more or less after the specified dates for the
propogation of the virus.
none of the emails these were sent from were real emails either. . .

even tho this is all annoying as hell, some viruses are just pretty damn
cool the way people have them work. . .I've never had norton anti-virus, and
personal firewall work so hard before.

and here I was thinking it was somehow all Osby's fault. . .

: )

I was just looking at the pioneer djm-909

it actually looks like a pretty clean n fun mixer. . .

retails for like 11-1200.

it only has two channels, and the effex are something I've never really been
a fan of. . .but it looks pretty cool otherwise. . .

It may also be a case of a spammer operation that's harvested your email 
opening the virus into their own computers. I doubt that General Mbatu 
from the African state of Bwanga has much of an antivirus protocol, nor 
do the people who need me to "veerify" my ATM pin numbers.

My peeve with these people is that I've begun to receive a bounced 
messages from spam sent out with a fake email from my domain-- Bastards! 
(And it's not even porn related-- Double bastards!!)

UK INTROS ANTI-RAVE THOUGHT CRIMES

UK authorities introduced new laws this week making it a criminal offence 
to go, or even prepare to go to a rave, within 24 hours of being stopped 
from visiting another one.

The government also amended their infamous 1994 Criminal Justice Act 
definition of 'rave', keeping the notorious 'repetitive beats' clause while 
reducing the number of partygoers from 100 to 20 and making indoor squat 
parties also illegal.  Indoor parties become raves only if the building is 
trespassed, while any outdoor party with more than 20 guests (including on 
private land) can now be classed as a rave.

Liberty spokesperson Barry Hugill condemned the new laws, including another 
stating that just two people can now constitute a 'public assembly': "This 
is totally unacceptable, it should only be a crime to commit a crime… The 
government is introducing constraints and no-go areas the like of which 
haven't existed since wartime."

"Security is mostly a superstition.  It does not exist in nature, nor do 
the children of humans as a whole experience it.  Avoiding danger is no 
safer in the long run than outright exposure.  Life is either a daring 
adventure or nothing."
-Helen Keller

"Fascism should more properly be called corporatism because it is the 
merger of state and corporate power."
-Benito Mussolini

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."

What this says to me is that too many whites are getting away with drug
use, too many whites are getting away with drug sales, too many whites
are getting away with trafficking in this stuff. The answer to this
disparity is not to start letting people out of jail because we're not
putting others in jail who are breaking the law. The answer is to go out
and find the ones who are getting away with it, convict them and send
them up the river, too."

- Rush Limbaugh. October 5, 1995 show transcript.

KZSU Radio or Stanford University." (or words to that effect.)

the cartoon bodys and puting real peoples heads on them but in a cartoon 
way... 

Well, then the subject went to old school games from back in the days ... and 
out of the blue the Rubiks Cube was on the main subject. People where saying 
"i could never get the colors to match so I swapped the stickers," etc., and 
blah, blah....

well i am here to save your day at the office... :-) just do not let the boss 
see you.. or hell you can even play this online version of the Rubiks Cube at 
your house and i think there is a PDA versions of it for your Palm Os and 
Windows CE download at www.downloads.com 

but you want the damn game right now? and you are sick of reading this e-mail 
because all i am doing is going on and on about stupid crap that is very

What this says to me is that too many whites are getting away with drug
use, too many whites are getting away with drug sales, too many whites
are getting away with trafficking in this stuff. The answer to this
disparity is not to start letting people out of jail because we're not
putting others in jail who are breaking the law. The answer is to go out
and find the ones who are getting away with it, convict them and send
them up the river, too."

What this says to me is that too many whites are getting away with drug
use, too many whites are getting away with drug sales, too many whites
are getting away with trafficking in this stuff. The answer to this
disparity is not to start letting people out of jail because we're not
putting others in jail who are breaking the law. The answer is to go out
and find the ones who are getting away with it, convict them and send
them up the river, too."

KZSU Radio or Stanford University." (or words to that effect.)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] What is better ? Behringer DJX 700 or PIONEER DJM-600

If you don't care about effects. get the Rane TTM-56.  It's cheaper
than the djm-909, will sound MUCH better, and tons more reliable.  Check
out the cola test on the product's web page (http://www.rane.com/ttm56.html)
They imerse the crossfader in a bowl of cola.  Then cut with it while it's
still in the cola and it all works!  This mixer is the god of two chanel
mixers.

The last Dilbert newsletter perfectly summed up the Atkins-ites: "Active 
avoidance of life-giving antioxidants while scarfing massive amounts of 
known carcinogens until someone punches you to death for bragging about 
how much weight you lost."

I think it's time we @ sfraves cash in on a retarded fitness craze...

"Glowingsticking The Way to a Trimmer You" or

"The Red Bull & Vodka Dance Dusk To Dawn Aerobic Workout" perhaps?

Hey, I know some one that threw UP at Shelley's party.  :)  Their name
rhymes with tick man, bic man, and sick man.  Now there's something worthy
of discussion on a public list....

My Vet put my cat on an Atkin's diet.. no, really...  high-protien food.

> Didn't mr atkins recently die ? 
> >From what I heard, he had large amounts of blockages in his arteries from high cholesterol, not to mention the fact that he wasn't really very old when he died.

No, he actually died when he tripped and fell.. totally accidental.  At least,
that is what they want you to believe.

I predict the Atkins diet fad will be history in 2 years.

Trust me, if you lived through the 80's, you have no desire to re-live it...

I dunno...I lived through the 80's, and while I don't really want to re-live
them - there were definately some high points. F'rinstance...BLOOM COUNTY.
No one can fuck with Bloom County. One of the best cartoons/forms of social
satire EVER.

Yes I'm only naming one thing right now...it's the 1st thing that came to
mind. :)

What this says to me is that too many whites are getting away with drug
use, too many whites are getting away with drug sales, too many whites
are getting away with trafficking in this stuff. The answer to this
disparity is not to start letting people out of jail because we're not
putting others in jail who are breaking the law. The answer is to go out
and find the ones who are getting away with it, convict them and send
them up the river, too."

Depends on how much fun you had in the 80's. ;)

Hey, i lived through the 80s fer shurr ...  Whatever all a'you are going 
through in your 20s or so, I went through in the 80s. But you know what sucked? 
There weren't any raves then!  yeah there were clubs but they sucked as bad then 
as they do now. I have good memories of going out dancing but they don't hold 
a candle to the raves/parties I've been to since 1998, when i started raving. 
There was some cool synth-based "modern rock" and "new romantic" music. Stuff 
like Kraftwerk... yeah! ...Alphaville ... Yaz ...   even pop stuff like A-Ha 
was awesome (and gets remade into trance records). 
I was subscribing to a DJ newsletter back then and got some cool records as a 
result. I was playing Derrick May/Mayday in 1986 and telling people "this new 
house music thing is pretty cool!" Also got Frankie Knuckles ... Oh, and 
damn, I've got nine remixes of Janet Jackson's "Control," from about the time 
Justin Timberlake was first born, and the only nipples he had seen were on his 
mom. 
Lots of other stuff about the 80s sucked really bad -- Like Ronald Reagan, 
for example. Overall, though, good memories.

I hope not.  I don't see many retro-80's 15 year-olds around. 
Personally, I experienced the 80's as a lame little kid, wishing I was 
cool.  Damnit if I won't now live out my pre-pubescent dreams...

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Any Lawyers Around?

Help please?

What is an online company's liability when children
steal their parents' credit card and purchase
nontangible items (services) off the company's website?
Are they responsible for refunding monies back to the
parents? Or can they just say, "No we're not giving you
back shit. You need to smack your kid around."

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Subject: [sfraves] Osby, please ask your homegirl, was Re: [sfraves] OK.. so i heard a Rumor....

Osby, 

Please ask your homegirl to make sure to book at least some Real hip-hop dj's like The Mega! (Megatron) and not just house/dwntempo etc. dj's that happen to have hip-hop records.

not saying those (house/dwntempo etc. dj's that happen to have hip-hop records) are not Real, but you should book some hip-hop specialits too.

just a request,
JOnas

What this says to me is that too many whites are getting away with drug
use, too many whites are getting away with drug sales, too many whites
are getting away with trafficking in this stuff. The answer to this
disparity is not to start letting people out of jail because we're not
putting others in jail who are breaking the law. The answer is to go out
and find the ones who are getting away with it, convict them and send
them up the river, too."

like since I was 15-ish, I really got into weight lifting, nutrition n stuff
like that. I had a GF that I kinda trained and now she's gone thru school
for physical therapy, massage therapy, and nutritional courses and such and
has some huge ass BF, and her herself turned out pretty friggin ripped.

Everythings really simple, theres no need to go on diets.
Any diet that has such a narrow view of things like only cutting out
carbohydrates will never really work.
Simple, complex carbohydrates, proteins, calories, fat.
All you really need to know,
protein builds muscle, simple carbohydrates (sugars) are quickly burned off,
complex carbohydrates (wheat pasta, grains) offer longer lasting energy.
Fat is just all badd.
The whole calorie thing doesn't really make sense. . . isn't a "calorie" a
unit of measurement for the amount of a particular fuel that is burned
(used) in order to create heat or fuel something so it can act ?
Basically tho, if you consume more than you use in a day, the excess gets
stored as fat. "Calories" are used first with things like simple
carbohydrates, and fat is typically stored energy.

it's absolutely necessary to excersize, if someone actually eats normally,
in order for them to lose weight.
If you increase your protein, your body will have what it needs to build
healthy muscle. But carbohydrates (simple and complex) are required for your
body to do it's job also.

If someone was to cut out cheese, dairy, fatty meats. . . they would no
doubt lose weight and if they excersized and fed their body properly they
would definately give their body what it needed to work how it was designed
to work.

You can't completely cut out fats either tho, there is a such thing as
someone getting very very sick from a lack of body fat, somewhere around
3-4%.

All these people talking about cutting out the carbs. . .do they have any
idea what they're talking about  ?
>From racing MX, I would eat a strict diet, and carbohydrates were a huge
part of that. If I didn't eat well, come sat or sunday, I wouldn't be able
to last the entire moto without fading back.
There were also issues with lactic acids building up in the forearms which
every rider deals with in their own ways.
Oatmeal, wheat pasta, wheat toast, grains, cereals. . . they're mainly
complex carbohydrates. And these dumbass diets are telling people that those
things are badd, and they should eat bacon, n cheese, n ham, n whatever. . .
anything with high amounts of fat is horrible for you. Fat gets burned off
last, and immediately stored in your body after you eat it until your other
calorie/carbohydrate stores are depleted.

actually, if you know HOW to eat, you can have huge control over your body,
how it looks, how it works. . .

diets simply do not work, and never will. they're not good for you, and even
tho some people might lose weight, it's not in a healthy correct way and the
diet ultimately does a great deal of damage in all sorts of ways.

I'm not in the best shape right now myself, there was a period where I was
pretty sick and I had to concentrate on helping my body heal, so I gained
some weight and lost a lil muscle. But it's all just temperary cuz I did it
all on purpose, and know how to undo it. I would drink the 2000 calorie
shakes and high protein shakes for a while so I could literally just gain
weight. There was a point where I started getting almost out of control
skinny. . .  at one point I was around 165, and my ideal weight is about 25
pounds more than that. My immune system was being compromised and I had to
fix that, so I could heal from the other illness. Now that I'm hell of a lot
better, I gotta just lose the stuff I purposely gained.
Diet effects your whole body. People need to learn how to eat to live.

simple. . .

hello, this is a continuation of a fictional work:
 
jane liked to fire rubberbands and paperclips across the room occasionally. no one knew exactly where they came from either, because there were 15 cubicles to a side. the office manager promised continually that they would be moving to another floor where they would have more space for at least five years now. it was like part of her job...to circulate and promise that, despite the fact that it never happened..actually, what did happen was that henry moved in and so did four others, because there used to be only 10 to a side. :)

__________________________________________________________________________
On Saturday January 24, Chris Hackett, Founder of the Madagascar Institute 
in Brooklyn, New York, sustained massive physical injuries when an 
art-piece he was developing detonated in his face. The explosion left him 
with broken bones in his face, a broken jaw, and burns throughout his body. 
To make matters worse, the accident led to a Joint Terrorism Task Force 
search of the shop and Hackett'sapartment on the top floor of the building. 
The police claimed they had found a weapon's cache and maps of major 
landmarks in New York. The NYPD confiscated all of The Institute's 
computers, maps of various spots in New York City, and other personal and 
professional materials. Like many working artists, Hackett has no medical 
insurance and no money to pay for the reconstructive surgery he will need 
for his face. Hackett's only asset is the home of the Madagascar Institute, 
a shop shared by more than 50 artists, based in Gowanus, Brooklyn.

The Madagascar Institute is a seminal arts organization in New York City. 
The Institute's artists have spearheaded dozens of street performances and 
events both in New York and around the world. Including: Glastonbury 
Festival in England, Robodoc in Rotterdam, and have been a regular presence 
at the Burning Man festival. In addition to staging performances and 
creating art, The Madagascar Institute holds both free and inexpensive 
classes on everything from sewing, to welding and auto-repair. People from 
all over New York's many diverse communities are drawn to The Madagascar 
Institute. The Institute has helped shape these individuals into skilled 
artists, welders, and machinists and many of these artisans have in-turn 
moved-on to create their own projects and art throughout the country.

The Madagascar Institute has been able to harness the energy of artists 
throughout New York, spreading the message that spontaneous art is 
possible. The police raid of the Institute and Hackett's apartment calls 
attention to tenuous rights of artists in this political climate. Anything 
that can be considered subversive could be linked to terrorist activity, 
and there are very few ways we can defend against this. Many of us are 
susceptible to surveillance under the Homeland Security Act, and some have 
already experienced other problems, like restricted access to performance 
spaces. We must support the civil rights of artists.

Nirvana or lasting enlightenment or true spiritual growth can be achieved
only through persistent exercise of real love. - M. Scott Peck

Touched by beauty we enter the forefields of enlightenment. Flying higher
and higher one may discover that there is nothing else but beauty. Isn't
it a pity that we're not yet ready to keep it in permanent view! - Hans
Taeger

A thousand candles can be lighted from a single candle, yet the life of
the candle is not shortened. Happiness is never decreased by being shared.
Buddha

Great spirits have always found violent opposition from mediocre minds.

Raiagambre || Bio

RAIGAMBRE (rye-g=E3m-bre) - roots, stability, tradition

"Raigambre's Latin-funk fiesta is one of the best musical bets around town.=
" -Chris Macias, Sacramento Bee, Friday, October 10, 2003
This group of talented musicians has been in the Sacramento music scene in =
various forms (Los Gallos, Motivo, etc.) for quite some time now. However, =
since May of 2001 they have come together under the name Raigambre. They bl=
end several different musical genres such as salsa, Afro-Cuban rhythms, fun=
k, and Chicano Groove. Another unique quality of Raigambre is the represent=
ation within the group. Members come from various backgrounds such as Mexic=
an-American, Native-American, and Caucasian.

If someone were to ask what Raigambre's message and purpose is, your averag=
e listener and fan would answer "dancing and a whole lot of energy!" While =
that may be true, Raigambre's songs contain very deep and serious messages.=
 "Caradura" (Hard Face) is a song that describes the expression on the Azte=
c people=92s faces as they fought to keep their land. "Se=F1or Ignacio" (Mr=
=2E Ignacio), a Cumbia-driven song, depicts a tale of a migrant farm worker=
 who has cancer yet still works hard to feed his family regardless of his i=
llness and low wages.

According to Chris Macias, Sacramento Bee Pop Music Writer, "Raigambre is s=
haking up Sacramento=92s nightspots with its earthy grooves and musical che=
mistry." In addition to being nominated for a SAMMIE (Sacramento Area Music=
 Award) in 2002 and again in 2003 for best Latin music group, Raigambre has=
 appeared on the Tony Tecate Show on KSFM 102.5 and MTV=92s Sorority Life, =
as well as playing in numerous festivals such as Festival De La Familia (Sa=
c.CA), Heritage Fest (Sac.CA), Picnic Day & Earth Day (Davis, CA.) and KSFM=
=92s Cinco De Mayo Fest (Sac.CA).

"Raigambre=92s biggest strength is that the band possesses a clear sense of=
 its own sound; it knows exactly what it should sound like, and that gives =
the music a sense of self-assurance," says Sacramento News & Review=92s Chr=
istian Kiefer. With influences such as WAR, Poncho Sanchez, and their own b=
lend of "Afro-Cuban, Chicano groove", Raigambre brings back to the music sc=
ene the tradition of deep rooted music.

Thursday, February 12, 2004 ** Gene Farris @ The Lotus Lounge **

Gene Farris | BIO

Gene Farris is the sinister minister of dance music=B9s changing sounds. Fa=
rris=B9s global DJ track record and extensive discography of over forty pro=
ductions are definitely a testament to the true Chicago house sound. Farris=
's unique dexterous DJ style that includes extended sultry, melodic blends =
with tuff beats makes him a party favorite around the world. House music is=
 Farris's undoubted passion that also drives his full flavored, colorful st=
udio creations. Farris's deep roots in house music and strive to be the bes=
t keeps him on the global electronic music industry's cutting edge.


Pushed by local kids in his South Side neighborhood of Chicago Gene Farris =
caught the DJ bug at the tender age of twelve. Inspired by the likes of Ron=
 Hardy, Prince, and Roy Ayers Farris began blending a mixture of funk, disc=
o, and soul combined with eighties' pop icons such as, Duran Duran. One may=
 still hear hints of disco in his style.


Even in his early years Farris was constantly on the move. By making mix ta=
pes for his neighborhood buddies and selling them at many famed Windy City =
record stores like Gramaphone, Farris's spinning skills quickly developed. =
Not only did Farris's style evolve, his reputation rapidly grew. After many=
 late nights 'beatn' down neighborhood block parties, Farris earned his chi=
ldhood dream slot warming up for legendary Ron Hardy and Ron Carrol at the =
epic AKA Club.


As the early nineties approached, Gene Farris became a major player in the =
thriving Chicago dance scene. Wanting to hear more diverse house music Farr=
is inevitably began to produce his own tracks. His first production style w=
as tuff, loopy and tracky House. At the time Cajmere (of Green Velvet) just=
 started a new label named, Relief Records. Close friend, Ron Trent, urged =
Farris take his hard hitting tunes to Relief Records. Trent thought Farris'=
s tracky sound was perfect for the early Relief.


House music history was made when Farris took his demo to Relief Records. H=
anging out in the Relief office was another young Chicago DJ called Sneak, =
who also just made his first demo. Farris and Sneak both had their tracks s=
igned. The "Farris Wheel" EP was Farris=B9s debut release for Relief in 199=
4. Gene Farris, alongside like minded musicians such as DJ Sneak, Paul John=
son, Derrick Carter, DJ Rush, Ron Trent, Boo Williams and Glen Underground =
formed the new wave of notorious, soon to be globe trotting Chicago DJs and=
 producers.


The "Farris Wheel" EP was the beginning of a prolific production career. Ge=
ne Farris=B9s discography highlights works released on dance music=B9s most=
 respected labels such as, Defected/Fluential, Soma Records, Siesta Music, =
Force Inc., Formaldehyde, 83 West/ Camouflage, Communique, Defmix, Static, =
and more.


Being a leader in the industry, Gene Farris started his own label, Farris W=
heel Recordings, Inc. in 1998, with "The Copa Cabana" EP. Among the label=
=B9s many loved EPs is FWR 008 "The Spirit" - Gene Farris featuring Sneak r=
emix. In February of 2001, Gene Farris unveiled Farris Wheel Recordings's s=
pin-off, Farris Wheel Limited. Farris's concept for the new imprint is to s=
teer away from saturated samples and feature more original, organic product=
ions. Farris Wheel Limited artists are incorporating live feeds into their =
melodic soulful beats. Also, 2003 will see the release of the Farris Wheel =
imprint's first CD compilation of the its own catalouge mixed by Gene Farri=
s.


Currently, Farris continues his travels around the globe DJing for his fans=
 throughout the United States, Canada, and many European countries like Cro=
atia, Holland, Israel, and Russia. However, Farris still finds time in his =
busy schedule to devote in the studio. He is is working on a full length al=
bum of original music for release in 2003. Farris's motive for the album is=
 to push beyond the barriers of the current house music sound. Farris alrea=
dy collaborated with many remarkable dance musicians such as renowned house=
 vocalist, Robert Owens and a fresh New York City production favorite, Onio=
nz (just to name a few).
When asked about his future in music Gene Farris passionately replies, "Hou=
se music is my one and only true love. I've been with her for over sixteen =
years and never plan on leaving. She's my peace... me and the music."


As the critics continually applaud his greatening accomplishments, Gene Far=
ris and his Farris Wheel Recordings empire continue to thrive.


The international demand for the elite Chicago House sound has kept Gene Fa=
rris busy gigging around the globe for over the past ten years. Then Februa=
ry 2003 saw the release of Gene's "Textures" mix CD and 6-track vinyl, acco=
mpanied by his "Textures" world tour, and features and reviews in Jockey Sl=
ut, Muzik, Mixmag, Seven Update, Mojo, DJ, IDJ, Blues & Soul, Echo, Muzik.c=
om, Xpander.nl, Burn It Blue, Worlddj.com and many more.


"Textures is a tasty affair, lots of layers, lots of passion, lots of origi=
nality. Deep, sexy, organic house music with that essential Chicago touch. =
A collection to inspire...5/5" DJ Mag
"The first collection from respected Chicago producer Gene Farris' Farris W=
heel Ltd...As good a house mix as you are gonna hear this month...4/5" IDJ =
Mag
"It's deep jazzy, stylish, sexy and soulful, showcasing fast rising talents=
 in the Farris Wheel Family such as Roomsa, Audiowhores, Greenkeepers, Behi=
nd the Groove and Boo Williams. It's damn fine house, nothing too heavy, ju=
st good party tunes from funk to disco and jazz to soul, it's all here as G=
ene graces us with some proper musical music." www.4clubbers.net

------------------------------------------------------------------------
This Reclaim The Streets event is being used in part to help bring together=
 the SF "activist" community, with the underground artist/performer communi=
ty, and the late night dance/music communities. =A0We all experience first =
hand the increasing intrusiveness of state repression. =A0Art, performance,=
 music, dance, these are the things that celebrate life and should be held =
up and revered in our society. Instead however, it is these very things tha=
t are constantly trying to be squashed. =A0If you want to have an art exhib=
ition, a performance, a concert, or a party, you have to jump through all s=
orts of bureaucratic hoops, pay for all sorts of permits, and then IF they =
approve of things, you are allowed to have your event. What happens if you =
don't have the means to meet all of their ridiculous standards? What if you=
 don't have the money to pay for all of their permits? Your options include=
 not having the event at all, or having it anyway illegally. And so we have=
 these unpermitted events. Often. And almost as often we have them shut dow=
n by the police. Or they just come in and harass people. For what? For enjo=
ying life? For celebrating that which makes us human? But we're experiencin=
g it more and more. And now they have the RAVE act at their disposal too. A=
nd it is going to continue to get worse until we rise up and say "Enough!"
=A0
So that is part of what we're doing with this RTS. Showing that if you
won't let us have our events in our own spaces where we aren't bothering an=
yone, than we are going to take it to the streets and have our events there=
!
=A0
For more info about RTS itself, you should go straight to the source. These=
 two links are from the London RTS group which began RTS originally way bac=
k in the day. They're a bit long, but very worth reading.

As many of you may know already, Mirage first appeared as a Wednesday club =
night here in San Jose. Unfortunately, as with many nightclubs in the scene=
, the venue was sold and new owners came in to change the club into a blues=
-rock bar. Mirage with its family and friends enjoyed a fun 2003 run and th=
e night vanished just before winter. Recently, we were told that Mirage wil=
l once again take shape in February. All who were involved with Mirage will=
 return to help recreate the magic and build a safe-haven for its reappeara=
nce. As the prophets give us more information, we will forward the details =
to you. Returning to the source of power are Mirage resident DJs: Michael L=
iu (Illumination Records), Denise (Sound Asylum), Dragn'fly (Shaolin), Maje=
re (Elektrosorcery), and Proteus (Vibe Rite). Crisp clean concert sound pow=
ered by Logik Pro. Much more information to follow on this all ages event..=

Subject: [sfraves] Thank You Oneiromancy

Thank you to everyone who put such a great event and made it possible.  I 
loved the venue, the diverse selection of music, and the friendly staff.  
Thank you for those who made it to my set.  I hope you guys enjoy my CD if 
you got a copy - share the music with your friends too.  The trance room was 
pretty poppin' thoughout the whole night.  Big ups to all the DJs that made 
it.  It was great experiencing such a night again. Peace to all.

--=====================_2703727==.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

This year Moksha Tribe is two years old and we're hoping you will join us 
for a very special party we are creating to celebrate our 
anniversary:  Catch 20-2.  Saturday, March 20th on the spring equinox.

2004 also marks the twentieth anniversary of the release of the first house 
recording, "On and On," so Moksha will be throwin' down the beats and the 
love to commemorate 20 years of EDM and 2 years of our underground 
family.   Catch 20-2 will feature four rooms of music, special guests and 
surprises,  and decorations and memories from all the parties we've thrown 
since Aboriginal.

The music, I guarantee, will be kick ass!!!! We will be sending out more 
info when we firm up the DJ selection.

Hope to see you on the dancefloor March 20th!!!

Much love,

Apollo for Moksha Tribe

"Security is mostly a superstition.  It does not exist in nature, nor do 
the children of humans as a whole experience it.  Avoiding danger is no 
safer in the long run than outright exposure.  Life is either a daring 
adventure or nothing."
-Helen Keller

"Fascism should more properly be called corporatism because it is the 
merger of state and corporate power."
-Benito Mussolini

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

are sluggs poisonous to kitties ?

jeez, like an hour or so ago, brian came in thru my window like he has =
for the past few years, but he was like foaming at the mouth. He had all =
this funky foamy slobber hanging out of his mouth, and there was this =
smell that I couldn't find till a lil bit later. I was all over the =
house trying to figure out what this smell was and where it was coming =
from then I went to brian and noticed that every time he opened his =
mouth I smelled this nasty smell. He was licking himself from several =
feet away and I could smell it. Like every time he opened his mouth it =
was like . . .well it wasn't pretty. He tried to lick me and I was like =
HELL NO. . .=20
He's doing okay right now, he ate some and drank some water.=20
All I could think of is maybe he ate a slugg. Like you know how a slugg =
gets all frothy if you pour salt on it, well that was how his mouth =
looked. He's acting normally so i'm thinking he's ok.
If I find out someone poisoned him I'll seriously be pissed off.=20

does anyone know if sluggs are poisonous to cats ? What about most local =
ordinary frogs ?=20
I guess it had to be something that gave him a fight or something, I =
couldn't imagine him wanting to eat a slugg, but it kinda smelled like a =
burnt slugg or something. I could see him chasing down a frogg and =
eating it tho (like for fun).

it all kinda made me think about what would happen if I lost him. . =
.it'd be pretty devastating. I never had a budd like him before.
We met one day a few years ago (he came to me), I was spinning in front =
of my room window and this strange cat climbed up and started scratching =
at my window. Ever since then he's spent every night watching over me =
and kinda just protecting me n keeping me company when I needed it. =
Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and he's above me just =
watching me, then kinda gives me one of those grins where he squints his =
eyes. . .

I'm sure he'll be ok, but I was pretty worried there for a lil while. =
I'll have to watch him tonight and if he acts weird at all I'll take him =
to the kitty er.

while i'm on the subject, it's sad when I see people take their loved =
family members to the vet, and they have their budd "put down" cuz it's =
too expensive for them. I've seen that a bunch of times, if it was me in =
that situation I'd deal with the bills. . . like moneys insignificant =
when it comes to loved ones yknow.

but yeah,=20
thanks all

Subject: Re: [sfraves] SFLNC:  Support Later Last Call Hours

hmm ... well it looks like the SFLNC is finally doing something.  for  
months they've had the same stuff up there, and then that blurb about  
"we're reducing our staffing to 9 members ... oh, and by the way would  
you like to be one of those members?" tells me they don't even have 9  
people interested enough in keeping that thing going.  does anyone else  
notice that, or am i the only one?  well, whatever ... no one wants to  
talk about it, i know, they just want to blindly support the cause ...   
i'm just trying to be the devil's advocate here, whether or not *aunt  
leslie* approves of it ... or osby thinks i'm doing that *stuff* again  
...

but anyway ...

the big question is, how much like new orleans would parts of the city  
become?  everyone, and i mean everyone's drunk in the french quarter.   
is that good or bad?  the french quarter's nice, but i wouldn't want to  
live there.  know what i mean?  are we going to make every bar open  
till 4am, or just certain clubs that have a bar?

anyone have the statistics of drunk driving incidents per capita  
compared with a 2am city to a 4 or 6am city?  i would imagine it might  
go down because people could stay longer.  that's my only real concern  
about this legislation.  we may be evolved enough as a society to allow  
later hours.  europe is, but europeans are also generally taught  
moderation with alcohol from a very young age.  you have 19 year olds  
in pubs talking about philosophy in france, where in america, you have  
21 year olds drinking too much and the main focus is where to get a  
piece of ass.  so some of our problems can't be fixed by legislation,  
they have to be reinforced culturally.

this could be a good piece of legislation as long as san francisco  
adapts it to fit the needs of the city.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] SFLNC:  Support Later Last Call Hours

DEEP !

whussup mann. . .

haven't heard from you in a long while. . .

yeah, I didn't want to say too much negative stuff about the sflnc in
public, but one of the main reasons why I drifted out was cuz of the
direction they were starting to go which differed greatly from what I felt
would have been much more "for the community".
Things were a lot more positive when they (we) were starting out. When there
was the sc meetings, and the gr meetings. Then a while after that things
started getting way too political in a badd kinda sellout way.
I don't mind talking about it, I just thought that some of my old buds were
still involved, but the guys like pete, deep, osby, angelica. . . you guys
were my favorites. The sflnc kinda just lost their way after about 2 years.
It was sad cuz there was a ton of potential, but I guess the temptation of
getting bigger and stronger, and having more money, etc just got to em.

I loved the things I was involved in, cuz I usually did my things my way in
a way. But after everything was becoming so regulated, people started
developing these attitudes that to me are just more rightfully in place like
20 years ago in the business industry, and not for a nighlife saving
organization with new age views. I raised mobs of money for toys for tots,
got people to bring in literally hundreds of toys n such. I was never
supposed to tell anyone this, but I thought it was a beautiful thing-
yknow Carl from the end-up. . .one year people didn't bring in all too many
toys for the tots programs and he went to toys r us and bought thousands of
dollars worth of toys. . .enuf to fill like 10 of those barrels plus some. I
always thought that was just awesome of him but he didn't want me to tell.
Fun stuff, positive stuff. He definately deserved some credit.

It's pretty wack to see how things are now. I'm glad I got out when I did,
before it started to turn me into someone i wouldn't like.

and leslie. . . well. . .I never liked how she seemed to try to hogg the
spotlight in ways. She seemed to try to take credit for things like those
bumperstickers we had that said "dancing is not a crime".
I still have a bunch of em btw. Originally a cool guy from ratkoonrat came
to me with his design and idea (he told me it was for a local radio show
promo idea thing), I went to postscript press and had them printed. . . Pete
payed for it. But I saw leslie saying she was responsible and heard other
people talk about those stickers saying like "oh you mean leslies stickers?"
.
I became tired of the fairy ravemother pretty quick, and not that she wasn't
a sweet person. . .she just went down the wrong path.

I personally think it would have been much more honorable for the sflnc to
actually fail and disband, then to turn the direction I've seen them going.
For a bunch of hipsters, it was suprising to see how they would have all
these strict guidlines about how they should look in the publics eye, act
with political officials and such. But then again I guess the real hipsters
ended up falling out along the line due to large differences in opinion.

Are there still any of the original sc members involved anymore ? I was
involved for a lil more than 2 years, and started about a month or so after
they originally got their idea. It was all much diffirent then, much better
I feel.

godd I wouldn't be suprised if they had lawyers ready to attack people like
me who were once involved and aren't afraid to speak their mind about their
lack of direction in public.

some of us should get together and start our own organization with like a
blood oath to never sell out, and to always stick with our own view despite
the political popularity opinion.

oh and deep, I had that invite for your list, but I responded too late. .
.send it to me again.

: )

take care all

hello, this is a continuation of a fictional work:
 
jane peered across the room, and saw henry with a dazed looked in his eyes. she could tell, damn it all, he was daydreaming again! 
henry knew that people thought he was totally self absorbed, but if they could only read his mind...... you see, henry was contemplating the physics of toilet bowl and toothbrush, and how was it that the toothbrush always seemed to make it into the toilet bowl, and the stuff that should be in there, didn't always quite make it in there, and consequently, was a source of tension between himself and his last live-in mate...:)

Subject: [sfraves] little love for lieb, last minute breaks and garage of mad wax

friday:
hit up "knees up" happy hour at vertigo bar.  drink some cheap drinks.  
really good music being layed down by the DJs who are also the owners of 
tweekin and BPM records in SF.  drink more cheap drinks.  must remember to 
come back to this place.
head to 1015 with homeys (including mike m.) with free passes in hand to 
check out oliver lieb.  place is pretty dead. hoping it fills up later.  it 
doesn't.  pound a redbull and vodka.  run into shelly.  oliver comes on.  
good shit.  room is pretty dead.  wander around to other rooms, basement is 
closed, front room has some booty music.  drink a beer.  place is pretty 
dead.  go back to oliver.  good shit.  place is pretty dead.  head home.

saturday:
barely wake up in time.  hungover and smell of alcohol.  book on over to 
berkeley to teach a taichi class.  wonder if the students can tell i'm 
hungover.
at night, decide to walk on over to 330 ritch for "last minute" breakbeat 
party.  meet up with aaron jae.  run into tamara.  drink affordable beer.  
see phillip.  dance to breaks.  drink more affordable beer.  talk to some 
folks.  not feeling the DJ (dunno his name) and head home.

sunday:
friend IMs me with info on some crazy record sale out of someone's garage in 
castro.  take muni.  spend several hours flipping through stacks and stacks 
of records (claims there were 20,000 records in there...and it's probably 
true).  $1 per record.  pick up tasty morsels including pebbles, trinere, 
ready for the world, the jets, jj fad, new edition.  walk home happy (had to 
walk because i spent all my money on records and didn't have muni fare).

the end.

Hey guys,
  I am currently taking a Research and development class at SFSU, where we 
must develop a product of some sort from beginning to end.  I am interseted in 
developing a product that would benefit DJ's in some way.  I rather do a DJ 
related project because I think it would make it more fun and interesting for me.
So my questions are this:

Are there any DJ products or accessories that currently out on the market 
that need some improvement or changes?

Are there any DJ products or accessories that you would like to see in order 
to make your life easier as a DJ?

Examples would be like a new slipmatt, a modfication to needles cartridges, a 
webstie to help DJs or even a packaging concept of some sort.  

Just respond back to my e-mail address.  Dont respond back to the sfraves 
list just in case non-DJs do not to want extra the e-mail.
                                                                              
           Thank you

Hi, I have a photo album on Yahoo with pictures from Friday's Oneiromancy 
party. The initial page doesn't seem to display right, but just click on the 
picture and that should take you to the photo album. 
Thanks to Paul and the Oneiromancy crew. That was a fun party! "Howard Dean 
campaign event" -- that was classic.

***The National Electronic Dance Music Conference***

http://www.nedmc.com

  In Washington D.C. on September 3rd through 6th 2004, the National EDM =
Conference will take place at the Omni Shoreham Hotel. We will be =
utilizing the entire space of the hotel to bring you the best possible =
environment to network with others in the EDM industry. We will be =
hosting all genres, from hip hop to hardcore, from house to industrial. =
As well, we will also be showcasing the newest technologies for the =
coming year and beyond, as well as offering seminars and focus groups to =
help dj's, producers, and gear manufacturer's push the envelope of music =
production and presentation.

  We have chosen D.C. to host this event because it is a central =
location on the east coast, offering easy access from many spots around =
the country, as well as being home to one of the nations largest EDM =
focused communities. We will be working closely with all businesses =
involved to ensure top notch production on all sides for after hours =
events, as well as demonstrations of said products. There will be also =
attendee only events, so be sure to sign up early to gain access to =
these events, held exclusively in the hotel.

  We at the NEDMC pride ourselves on being a community oriented event. =
That is why we are asking your input on what types of seminars, panels, =
and other types of educational meetings. We have created an input form =
on our site for your convenience, and ask that you fill it out so that =
we may custom tailor our event to the industries needs. We could have =
simply placed seminars according to how we see things in the industry, =
but we would rather make this a community event, and want to know what =
you want to see. You can use the form at =
http://www.nedmc.com/seminarfdbk.html or simply send us an email at =
info@nedmc.com.

  To stay up to date on all the happenings of the NEDMC, including =
seminar information, hotel and registration discounts, and event =
information, please visit http://www.nedmc.com/contact.html

  For further information on either sponsoring, exhibiting, attending, =
or hosting an official event, please email info@nedmc.com , or visit our =
site at http://www.nedmc.com .

  If you would like to help out with the NEDMC, please e-mail =

Subject: [sfraves]NRR: Q for Producers

Hey all.

I was just wondering what your sources were for rhythms in your projects?  
What do you use for synth sounds, atmospheric sounds, stuff like that?  I 
generally build my drums with Reason, sample a bunch of records, lay down 
the bass with reason(or my buddy lays down some bass guitar riffs).

I dunno..  I just haven't been extremely happy with Reason and sampling 
being my sole source for rhythms.  I play piano by ear, so I am seriously 
thinking of getting some kind of keyboard.  I already have a full sized, 
weighted, digital pianowith midi hook-ups...

Maybe I should head on over to Guitar Center and play around with some of 
their gear.  It's just that, a lot of my friends who produce tell me that 
software is the only way to go as far as getting atmospheric and ryhthmical 
sounds....

Thanks all!

Subject: RE: [sfraves]NRR: Q for Producers

This is my normal work-flow these days:

1. Create main drum pattern in reason using tons of reasons effects
2. Create a percussion track in FruityLoops and add tons of effects
3. Bring both tracks into Sonar2 and sequence them
4. Go back and make a Bassline using either reason or fruity loops =
depending on the sound im looking for
5. Add the bass track to Sonar
6. Get cool samples and chop/cut them up in Acid and then bring that =
into Sonar
7. Add pads, lead, or arp with my XP-30 in Sonar
8. Mix down in sonar
9. Master in SoundForge
10. burn to disk

Depending on the project and my inspiration I can mix these steps up, =
but it gives you a general idea of what I think each program is best =
for.

Oh, and my songs would be very simple and crappy if I didn't have my =
keyboard to work out ideas on and to record pads off of. It's just too =
hard to try making good melodies and chord progressions with a human =
feel on softsynths.

What would you do if you had to replace your XP-30?  Would you get another 
keyboard?  Get a sound module?  I need something mobile, since my digital 
piano is not.  I guess the question I am trying to get at is...  What is 
more worth my money?  A keyboard, or a midi controller?

by the way...  I cant tell you how much I love working with sonar and

Hey guys,
I am currently taking a Research and development class at SFSU, where we

developing a product that would benefit DJ's in some way. I rather do a DJ 
related project because I think it would make it more fun and interesting for me.
So my questions are this:

Are there any DJ products or accessories that currently out on the market 
that need some improvement or changes?

Are there any DJ products or accessories that you would like to see in order 
to make your life easier as a DJ?

Examples would be like a new slipmatt, a modfication to needles cartridges, a 
webstie to help DJs or even a packaging concept of some sort. 

Just respond back to my e-mail address. Dont respond back to the sfraves 
list just in case non-DJs do not to want extra the e-mail.

Thank you

Subject: RE: [sfraves]NRR: Q for Producers

This is hard to answer, what type of sound are you looking to obtain in =
your productions?

For myself, I enjoy nothing better then a breakdown with a warm pad full =
of emotions after a long looped out, progressive trance session with =
minimal melody or chords but lots of trippy effects (ex: Flash - closing =
session).
So I require a synth that has good pads (and Rolands and Korgs are best =
at that).

Do you require a weighted keyboard? 88 keys? Can you just make due with =
a cheap midi controller?

Maybe you need a analog modeling synth if you require something with =
tons of knobs to twist in order to get inspiration.

Go to the music store, bring headphones, and play for a few hours on all =
the different synths.

I personally believe that my hardware synth makes better quality sounds =
then all my softsynths, but that might just be the placebo effect.

I really love Spectrasonic's "Stylus" for building breakbeat percussion.

Spectrasonic's "Atmosphere" is great for pads.

Everybody seems to love Reactor for synth stuff... but I still use
hardware.

The key is to get the hell away from Reason and onto something that
supports VST plugins... Orion can do this for cheap.  Otherwise, there
is Logic, Cubase, Sonar, ect.  There are hundreds of great VST 
noise-making plugins, many of which are free.

gosh you guys have all the cool equipment ...   I do all of my tracks on 
Techno E-Jay on the PC   :) 

ok i admit it really isn't much more than a toy, as the reviews say. But it's 
a fun toy, and you can come up with cool-sounding (if unoriginal) tunes. It 
does have a lot of limitations, like you can't fade volume in and out (although 
you can adjust the volume of the entire track). But there is fun stuff you 
can do, like importing actual songs and adding things to them, and writing your 
own sequences. 
It's pretty good for real novices, and then if people really get into the 
idea of building tracks on the computer, they can graduate to something more 
professional. 
This isn't a sales promo ... I don't even know if they sell Techno E-Jay 
anymore, as I've noticed something newer and spiffier from the publisher 
(Voyetra).  I'm just trying to tell people that if Fruity Loops and so forth are over 
their head, they can take baby steps with something simpler and then move up.   
:)
It's a fun toy for after a party when you can't go to sleep but still have 
music in your head.

Don't forget FL Studio.  FL Studio was ranked the top Soft Studio over
Reason and Orion and Project5 by Computer Music mag.  It's a full VST/DX
host, with a ton of great features including slicing, looping, MIDI in and
out, audio recording, automation, etc.  It's stable and cheap as hell.  If
MIDI synths (external) are your gig, I'd go with something more traditional.
If you want to stay soft, you should at least give it a shot.  The demo is
downloadable, and can do everything but save projects.

The included samples kinda suck, but there are tonnnnnnnns of sample sites
all over the web to rectify that.

PC/Windows only.

Get a palm pilot (I have a piece of turd PalmV).  There's a free BPM
counter app for those things where you just tap the beat in.  Fairly
accurate...

I'd say a Palm is one of the dopest things you can have for digging
records.  You can keep a "want list" of stuff you've heard in other

Is this project you're doing (yodog7) ? Like are you designing a product,
developing it, and creating all the marketing/details etc ?

Do you have to make a prototype with your own hands, or could you like
outsource a diff manufacturer after the initial designs you created youself
?

just curious

Na na na....Tap buttons arn't accurate enough, the mix would probably start sliping after 32 beats or so...besides, if "YODOG7" is designing something new, let's go for the gusto!  Check this out.  I'm talking something with a microphone.  Where all I would have to do is hold it up...press the "damn it I can't bpm match this F-ing track Button".....
and it would simply (Ha...probably not so simply) detect the bass hits from the monitors and tell me how fast the track is being played.  Kinda along the same principle as the BPM counter in the Pioneer DJM600 (ahh...what a great toy...oh I mean tool...who am I kidding....TOY!)  Wow after reviewing what I just wrote, I really feel like a cheater......oh well, it would be tight!

I'd say a Palm is one of the dopest things you can have for digging
records. You can keep a "want list" of stuff you've heard in other
people's mixes or online or whatever, you can take notes, keep your
booking calendar, contacts, to do list, syncs with your computer so if it
gets lost you're not fukt, etc.

Hello all.  I haven't posted in a while...and here I am posting some non "rave" event, but what the fuck does rave mean anymore anyway? 

 

OK, so Bondage-A-Go-Go is this Wednesday night the 11th at their new location, 

The Glas Kat on 4th street.  (the old Trocadero – anyone remember the Trocadero?)  

It’s their typical music: goth, industrial and 80s dance.  

AND this week there is a Bettie Page look-a-like contest.  Somewhere around midnight.  My girlfriend Esperanza won last year and is out to try again.  So I am just here to say if you got nowheres to go, go here and vote for whoever you think best, just make sure it’s her.

 

And before the club, there is a film about Bettie at the Roxy.

 

San Francisco Independent Film Festival

 

Roxie Cinema, 3117 16th Street at Valencia

BETTIE PAGE - DARK ANGEL

Wednesday February 11 at 9:30pm
Nico B.
2004, USA, 80 minutes
www.bettiepagedarkangel.com
World Premiere

The impact of Bettie Page on modern culture is undeniable and pervasive. If you’ve never encountered the saucy Ms. Page, this is a perfect introduction. And, if you’ve already joined the Cult of Bettie, you’ll relish this dramatic biography-narrated by Bettie Page herself. 

In the 1950s, the infamous Irving Klaw was a businessman who sold photos of movie stars. He quickly noticed his best sellers were pictures of tied-up women from Hollywood films. When the demand exceeded supply, Klaw produced bondage photos and films himself: A genre, and a star were born. 

Bettie Page was a sweet young Tennessee girl who had graced the pages of a new magazine called Playboy. Her striking features, knot-tying prowess, great hair and charisma-to-burn earned her the nickname “Dark Angel.” Although her films contain almost nothing that modern audiences would consider sex-just “sexy” dancing, spanking and girls pretending they can’t escape-they were absolutely scandalous 50 years ago. To avoid offending his customers, who simply desired Betty Grable, Marlene Dietrich or Johnny Weismuller in a loincloth, Klaw kept them (literally) under the counter, but that wasn’t enough. 

The ultra-low budget ($40,000) debut from underground filmmaker Nico B. illustrates Betty’s early career and Klaw’s inevitable encounter with the righteous forces of morality, and recreates some of Bettie’s bondage films. After Wednesday’s premiere join us at Bondage A Go-Go and see Bettie’s influence firsthand at their annual Bettie Page look a like contest.

-Bruce Fletcher

In attendance: Director Nico B.

I'd say a Palm is one of the dopest things you can have for digging
records. You can keep a "want list" of stuff you've heard in other
people's mixes or online or whatever, you can take notes, keep your
booking calendar, contacts, to do list, syncs with your computer so if it
gets lost you're not fukt, etc.

close enough for categorizing your music by bpms, i would think.
not so sure it's a good idea to rely on a "bmp" counter on your mixer to make sure your mixes are on.

I'd say a Palm is one of the dopest things you can have for digging
records. You can keep a "want list" of stuff you've heard in other
people's mixes or online or whatever, you can take notes, keep your
booking calendar, contacts, to do list, syncs with your computer so if it
gets lost you're not fukt, etc.

I would have to agree not to rely on bpm counter while mixing.  the same record can return different bpm rates on different devices.

plus there are concepts like "swing" and "syncopation" that make mixing infinitely interesting.

train your brain to match beats.

just my opinion,
JOnas

p.s. Gram are you still looking for techo artists for mach 1?  if so, give me a holler in ALL CAPS if you want.

Three problems:

If this is a BSP, please mark it as such.

Why would you send a BSP to a San Francisco raves mailing list for an event
in Charlotte?

SFR has a no cross posting rule, so if you really want to tell us about an
event in Charlotte, please take the time to send it individually to us.

Not trying to be a bitch, but I know I made a couple oops when I moved out
here due to not being a tech head and I was thankfully corrected by a couple
friends before everyone hated me.

oh for sure.  Honestly I dont even use the feature, I spend to much time trying to decided what I want to play next, I dont want to waste the time using the bpm counter.  But like I said it would be sick if there were something you could just hold up press a button and get a read out.

not so sure it's a good idea to rely on a "bmp" counter on your mixer to make sure your mixes are on.

I'd say a Palm is one of the dopest things you can have for digging
records. You can keep a "want list" of stuff you've heard in other
people's mixes or online or whatever, you can take notes, keep your
booking calendar, contacts, to do list, syncs with your computer so if it
gets lost you're not fukt, etc.

Yes I am always looking for djs to come out and play....when ever you have a free friday, just let me know a little over a week in advance.
>syncopation......I'm not familiar with that term....please enlighten me.

I would have to agree not to rely on bpm counter while mixing. the same record can return different bpm rates on different devices.

plus there are concepts like "swing" and "syncopation" that make mixing infinitely interesting.

train your brain to match beats.

just my opinion,
JOnas

p.s. Gram are you still looking for techo artists for mach 1? if so, give me a holler in ALL CAPS if you want.

hello, this is a continuation of a fictional work:
 
there was one empty cubicle that was usually occupied in the office. there were also five additional empty cubicles, but those were there for the future new people to sit in, because everyone knew, they weren't going to change office space any time soon, so when the extra desks and walls became available, everyone got smooshed up a little bit farther and additional spaces were created...but the one that was usually occupied wasn't, because oscar couldn't be at work this week. lucky dog, huh? not really...:)

Shoot!  if only I had the "Finding Nemo" Lithographs, I could have brought those.  hehe...maybe someone at the Disney STore has extras that I can maybe have. I'll check on that.  They're Bright and orangy-colored too, so that's why they'd be perfect.

Beatmatching the kinds of beats a DJM-600 can keep track of is a parlor
trick you can pick up in a couple hours.  I've got some records that make
those things bug out seriously (50 no.... 190 no.... no... um... 75!
aiiieee).

And as for tap buttons not being accurate enough... there was a time when
the rhythm for music was kept by humans, basically tapping very hard using
sticks.  And to be honest, electronica was pretty boring till they figured
out how to bring some of that error and funk back.  That swing, that late
in the pocket funk is the backbone of good jungle, breaks and hip hop.  In
fact, it's the lack of swing in most trance that prompts many people to
describe it as "teutonic", "unfunky", "white" or even "boring".

While it's fairly easy to develop a product that can track percussive
impacts, determining the tempo from anything but a monotonous "thud thud
thud" in a known frequency range is a pretty serious design challenge.

andyw

p.s. Hint... for a prototype of your handheld device you could try gutting
a Numark Beatkeeper... those things must be cheap used now.  In fact...
THEY ARE!

First off thanks for some of the feedback I have gotten.  I have gotten many 
ideas and suggestions. Many of these I told my teacher today.  The response I 
got from my teacher should try something in print or web, since the my major 
emphasis is Visual Communication.  It may take to much time for to develop a 
BPM counter, since I do not know how one is built.  So anything that could be 
done in print or web is the route I should be going.  So my next question is:

Is there anything graphic wise, whether print or web related, that could 
benefit DJs in some way or another?  Maybe a DJ resource pamplet or website (which 
is something my teacher suggested),instructional, tutorial manual, etc. I am 
pretty much out of ideas.

I rather do something related to DJ culture since I DJ for a hobby and enjoy 
it, but to not limit myself, I am open to other ideas or suggestions that are 
outside the DJ realm.  For example, someone from a previous semester made a 
informational pamphlet about the Palestinian/ Israeli war.  So maybe something 
that brings awareness that a lot of people do not know about.  
                                                                      thanks

Well in that case.......this isn't exactly new but what about a web site that you can shop for records on that allows you to listen to samples of the tracks.

Hmmm, why not combine the 2?
Make your BPM counter, then you hook it up to a
monitor facing the DJ.
The monitor will display random pix of luscious,
nubile young women as long as the records are
BPM-synced-
If you stray off beat, the pic will morph towards a
hairy beastress!

Subject: [sfraves] Right to Dance group? (was: SFLNC: Support Later Last Call Hours)

Aryck,

	I fully hear you. My sense of the situation was very similar to yours,  
and I got out of the SFLNC for similar reasons.

	Reading your post, it occurs to me that perhaps the time is ripe for  
starting another group more focused on building a mass movement for the  
right to dance at the grassroots level.

	Perhaps something more along the lines of the bicycle group Critical  
Mass -- make the focus throwing renegade parties with a strong  
educational/political flavor that get people out in the streets. Do  
extravagent "Love Parade" type floats for Gay Pride, etc. Perhaps  
sponsor a ballot initiative. Don't sit down with establishment  
politicians until we have a whole bunch of people behind us.

	Anybody know if the name "Right To Dance" is being used these days? I  
bought the domain name RightToDance.org, and have been waiting for the  
opportunity to do something with it. What do you guys think?

Groove on,
					<<< Starchild >>>

Personally I think that this idea is just plain silly. A) If there's  
any place that should be legally permitted to sell alcohol after 2AM  
it's stores not bars and this bill wouldn't augment that part of the  
law. After all, the reason stores stop selling alcohol at 2 isn't  
sensible, If I wanna drink at my house and run out of alcohol at 2:15AM  
why can't I go walk to the Safeway and get some more? 2AM is totally  
arbitrary. B) Since when is the regulation of alcohol sales a major  
focal point for the SFLNC? I mean, we basically established that  
alcohol is an acceptable means of recreation in the 30s and while  
working to allow people to stay drunk as late as they want is probably  
a good thing, it's something that the alcohol companies ought to press  
if they really it.  and Finally C) I think it'd be more effective to  
legislate that bars and clubs stop serving alcohol an hour and a half  
before closing rather then let them serve alcohol later -- I mean,  
sure, maybe it'll bring more money to those businesses but let Gavin  
Newsom worry about that -- the fact of the matter is that drunk driving  
is a dangerous problem, and even if this doesn't contribute to more  
drunk driving, I don't really see what it does but create a system  
where certain businesses are allowed to peddle alcohol after 2 whereas  
others are denied. This will hurt the bars that aren't zoned for  
late-night entertainment, and it'll encourage people who've been  
drinking at home and run out of alcohol after 2AM to get in their cars  
and head out to the nearest late-night spot, putting the lives of  
themselves and others at risk.

Why don't you come over to my place and do all the things I am going to tell=

Your mind looks like it's a thousand miles away. Mind if I play with your=20
body until it comes back?

also along with this just to set you guys in the right mind always think=20
about doing this,.. this might come in handy also :-)=20

Also, if the Laundromat doesn't have a vending machine for detergent, ask th=

hello, this is a continuation of a fictional work:
 
it is usually when the clock hits 2pm that the emptiness of it all settles in at the office.  at least when everyone is there, there are a few more options to fill the tedium, potentially anyway. oscar was a nice guy too, but oscar was at home taking care of the twins and their twin flu. :)

there is a group down in LA that throws "RTD" (right to dance) parties 
in highly conspicuous places - in front of the Federal building in 
Westwood, for instance.  their parties are kinda strange - never really 
a big turnout that i've seen, but i've only been to a few.

What this says to me is that too many whites are getting away with drug
use, too many whites are getting away with drug sales, too many whites
are getting away with trafficking in this stuff. The answer to this
disparity is not to start letting people out of jail because we're not
putting others in jail who are breaking the law. The answer is to go out
and find the ones who are getting away with it, convict them and send
them up the river, too."

Subject: RE: [sfraves] SRR: Uplift Roll Call

By the way...is ANYONE from the EAST BAY going to Sublounge (perhaps on the 
early side? I'm sposed to spin at 7:30pm) or could anyone from the EAST BAY 
who has a working automobile, and no prior engagements transport the new kid 
(that's ME!) to Sublounge??? I'll pay bridge toll, and buy ya a drink or two 
if'n you can help me out!!!! My ride bailed on me last minute, and I don't 
trust my wreck of a vehicle to make it to the city and back at this point.

Come on folks, help a fellow party-person out! (you'll also be helping me 
celebrate my NEW FOUND PERMANENT EMPLOYMENT as well - no more temping for 
me!)

Anyone??? I don't stink...I promise!!!

Subject: [sfraves] <bsp> Uplift your booootie @ Sublounge tonight!

the lineup tonight is friggin stellar so if you're not
able to make it out with absolutely NO cover, 3 dollar
well drinks, and drunken video gaming available to
you, then well, that definitely sucks.  and you won't
get any of my soco either, so NYAH.

here's what we got:

downstairs in the lair of doom:

jack triumph (it's fun to watch jack dance when he's
hammered ;)
forest green
ethan
calamity jane (get *me* drunk enough and..ok, i'll
stop there)

upstairs, conveniently at the bar, we have:

floorcraft (jeff's a MADMAN when he spins)
iyad (you won't find a nicer guy *anywhere*)
koroma
J.C. (see the host of KZSU in the flesh!)

i'm spinning so bloody late but if i get just one
passed out partykid in the room, my job is done.  i
sincerely hope to see you all out tonight, and if
you're from the list - introduce yourself!  

628 20th Street @ 3rd Street, SF (not to far from
SnoDrift on 3rd)  7PM - whenever

Ah...  Many cultures preserve the umbilical cord, and in some the parents 
and close family dry and eat it.  The woman next door to me did this after 
her girl was born a few months ago.

"Security is mostly a superstition.  It does not exist in nature, nor do 
the children of humans as a whole experience it.  Avoiding danger is no 
safer in the long run than outright exposure.  Life is either a daring 
adventure or nothing."
-Helen Keller

"Fascism should more properly be called corporatism because it is the 
merger of state and corporate power."
-Benito Mussolini

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

Subject: [sfraves] [NRR] Unlucky No. 13 Friday the 13th combines Christian, pagan beliefs

-------------------------------1076668154
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Friday the 13th is an unlucky day in much of Western Europe, North America, 
and Australia. Many people avoid travel and avoid signing contracts on Friday 
the 13th. Floors in tall buildings often skip from 12 to 14. And while the 
superstition is believed to be fading, it nonetheless has deep roots in both 
Christian and pagan culture.


The Day Jesus Was Crucified?


Many Christians have long believed that Friday was unlucky because it was the 
day of the week when Jesus was crucified. The number 13 was believed to bring 
bad luck because there were 13 people at The Last Supper. Since there were 12 
tribes of Israel, that number was considered lucky.


Roots in Norse Mythology


Thirteen was also a sinister number in Norse mythology. Loki, one of the most 
evil of the Norse gods, went uninvited to a party for 12 at Valhalla, a 
banquet hall of the gods. As a result, he caused the death of Balder, the god of 
light, joy, and reconciliation. Loki tricked Balder's blind brother, Hod, into 
throwing a sprig of mistletoe at Balder's chest. Since mistletoe was the only 
thing on Earth fatal to Balder, the beloved god fell dead.

Literature and Folk Wisdom


During the Middle Ages, the superstition against Friday the 13th grew. On 
Friday, October 13, 1307, King Philip IV of France ordered the arrests of Jaques 
de Molay, Grand Master of the Knights Templars and sixty of his senior knights 
in Paris. Thousands of others were arrested elsewhere in the country. After 
employing torture techniques to compel the Templars to "confess" to wrongdoing, 
most were eventually executed and sympathizers of the Templars condemned 
Friday the 13th as an evil day. Over time a large body of literature and folk 
wisdom have reinforced the belief. In the 18th century, the HMS Friday was 
launched on Friday the 13th. It was never heard from again. Since then, ships are not 
usually launched on that date. (Click here for other mysterious ship 
disappearances.) 


Dinner With 13


It is considered especially unlucky to have 13 people at the table during a 
meal, such as in Agatha Christie's mystery novel, Thirteen at Dinner. During 
the 1880s, a men's group that felt superstition was an unhealthy influence on 
public life held Thirteen Club dinners. Those diners would have doubtless 
deplored Triskaidekaphobia, which is a fear of the number 13. They would also have 
looked askance at Triskaidekamania, which is an excessive enthusiasm for the 
number 13. (Take our Phobias Quiz on Triskaidekaphobia and other scary phobias.)

May sound stupid, but just for clarification, I don't believe you have to be
Asian to attend....should have mentioned that, a couple of you had asked.

Hey not my shindig...but none the less, fLOORCRAfT and Co. have a winner on
their hands tonight @ AsiaSF (and you know how often Jack hype's other
peoples events, lol)...I believe Jonathan Beech is playing there also, and
of course Iyad will be playing...$0  cover. So if you like your beats deep
and overly proggy, you should make an effort to stop by. The last party,
Jan. 9th was to say the least a blast!

Just thought I would let ya'll know. I believe AsiaSF is located at 9th /
Howard in that city by the bay.

On Friday the 13th:  both my grandfather and father had heart attacks (both 
survived);  I was mugged for the first time in NYC by two thugs with knives 
(not hurt, and they didn't get much);  I was on a plane coming into La 
Guardia when the landing gear malfunctioned (plane landed on foam and no 
one was hurt:  on another flight coming into Chicago the landing was 
aborted and we escaped colliding with another plane on the same runway by 
seconds.  Bad luck, good luck -- you decide.  I take it easy, however, on 
these special  Fridays:)

Love,

Apollo

Subject: Re: [sfraves] [NRR] Unlucky No. 13 Friday the 13th combines  Christian, pagan beliefs

like the main reason badd stuff happens on days like friday the 13th, all of
that, is from the energy lent to that belief by superstitious people.

of course tho that doesn't make it not real. Belief makes lots of crazy
things manifest themselves in lots of ways. Realistically, everyone
everywhere would simultaneously have to stop believing and knowing/thinking
about something like that in order for it not not have the energy to
manifest itself.

knowledge is power yknow, there are ways to avoid other peoples
superstitions and beliefs from effecting you. . .basically you just have to
believe. . .

cool shit tho, I like watching it work

	Right. Jesus had twelve disciples, and twelve plus one equals 
thirteen. Look what happened to him, he got crucified! No wonder 
thirteen being unlucky has deep roots in Christian culture. I wonder if 
that happened on a Friday?  8)

	Another unlucky thing about Friday the 13th -- they made really bad 
movies about it.

hello, this is a continuation of a fictional work..we hope you like the title...trip away, trip away:
 
today at work, the boss's favorite had to do all sorts of extra work. that is also why the boss's favorite is the boss's favorite, because when there is work to be done, the boss's favorite is going to do it, because that is the relationship between employee and boss. :)

In a message dated 2/13/2004 10:24:58 AM Pacific Standard Time, DEB62 writes:
In the hospital the relatives gathered in the waiting room, where their 
family member lay gravely ill.

Finally, the doctor came in looking tired and somber.

"I'm afraid I'm the bearer of bad news," he said as he surveyed the worried 
faces.

"The only hope left for your loved one at this time is a brain transplant.

It's an experimental procedure, very risky but it is the only hope.

Insurance will cover the procedure, but you will have to pay for the brain 
yourselves."

The family members sat silent as they absorbed the news. After a great length 
of time, someone asked, "Well, how much does a brain cost?"

The doctor quickly responded, "$5,000 for a male brain, and $200 for a female 
brain."

The moment turned awkward. Men in the room tried not to smile, avoiding eye 
contact with the women, but some actually smirked.

A man unable to control his curiosity, blurted out the question everyone 
wanted to ask,

"Why is the male brain so much more?"

The doctor smiled at the childish innocence and explained to the entire 
group, "It's just standard pricing procedure. We have to mark down the price of the 
female brains, because they've actually been used."

SEND THIS TO A SMART WOMAN WHO NEEDS A LAUGH AND TO THE MEN YOU THINK CAN 
HANDLE IT.

In the hospital the relatives gathered in the waiting room, where their 
family member lay gravely ill.

Finally, the doctor came in looking tired and somber.

"I'm afraid I'm the bearer of bad news," he said as he surveyed the worried 
faces.

"The only hope left for your loved one at this time is a brain transplant.

It's an experimental procedure, very risky but it is the only hope.

Insurance will cover the procedure, but you will have to pay for the brain 
yourselves."

The family members sat silent as they absorbed the news. After a great length 
of time, someone asked, "Well, how much does a brain cost?"

The doctor quickly responded, "$5,000 for a male brain, and $200 for a female 
brain."

The moment turned awkward. Men in the room tried not to smile, avoiding eye 
contact with the women, but some actually smirked.

A man unable to control his curiosity, blurted out the question everyone 
wanted to ask,

"Why is the male brain so much more?"

The doctor smiled at the childish innocence and explained to the entire 
group, "It's just standard pricing procedure. We have to mark down the price of the 
female brains, because they've actually been used."

SEND THIS TO A SMART WOMAN WHO NEEDS A LAUGH AND TO THE MEN YOU THINK CAN

sinister like smoking blunts ?

that 4:20 term came into popularity from a group of teenages years ago
called the waldos (or something like that). It had to do with their kind of
code language for talking about getting smoked after school while they were
in school. . .

funny how that caught on. . .it caught on so huge so quick, most people had
no idea what they were talking about. . .

what other sinister things happened on april 20th, besides of course an ex's
birthday. . .

?

Shouldn't there be a phobia about April 20th? There are many sinister
historical connections to that day too.
Humans are funny, funny creatures.

Has anyone here had a chance to play with one of these? I'd like to know
your opinion... Thanks! Karina


Red Infader Digital Mixer:

http://www.hollywooddj.com/hollywooddj/redinfader.html

Details:

Introducing the World's First Digital Mixer for DJ's Digital mixing offers
incredible audio fidelity, inherent reliability and noise-free fading.
With its modular construction, the RED Sound INFADER allows the user to
choose from a number of crossfading options including the patented
Tri-Fader. This convention-shattering device allows DJ's to crossfade by
selectable bands of frequencies. And with many more modules in the
pipeline, InFader is sure to become a dance classic.

Overview The main mixer section features 2 x input channels with 3 band EQ
(+4/-85dB) and selectable balanced microphone/line level input section
with 2 band EQ. The 'multi-tap' effects send/return loop lets you choose
exactly where to pick-off and return the signal for effects processing and
also doubles-up as an auxiliary stereo line level input for expanded input
capability. With balanced master outputs, crossfader curve control and a
comprehensive monitoring section, INFADER delivers professional mixing
performance at an affordable price. All high usage faders and knobs are
microprocessor controlled assuring extra long life for major hardware
components.

Tri-Fader Module Patent Pending By expanding the traditional single
crossfader section to incorporate 3 crossfaders, each with it's own
high-order digital filter, crossfades can now be broken-down precisely
into low, mid and high frequency bands for stunning crossfade mixing. For
example, the lows from one track can be mixed with the mids and/or highs
from another. Additional features include 3-way/single crossfader select,
reverse function and crossfader 'centre-off' option.

Forthcoming modules for INFADER will include: BPM Module - single
crossfader, V2 BPM engine with 2 x BPM readouts, audio/MIDI sync

BPM Sync Module - single crossfader, 2 channel beat matching, basic
punch-in FX

BPM Auto-Sync Module - single crossfader, 2 channel CD/Vinyl deck speed
control system for automatic BPM lock

BPM FX Module - single crossfader, Multi BPM effects with 2 x BPM readouts

Filter Module - details TBA

Subject: RE: [sfraves] SRR: Red Infader Digital Mixer

The concept is cool but when I played with it I was not really
impressed. I will stand by my guns and tell people to buy a high end
mixer without the bells and whistles and make sure it has an insert for
FX. You can always buy external FX and route them that way and it sounds
better IMO. The sound quality of a good Allen & Heath or Rane is tough
to beat. I know there are companies out there that have made rackmount
eq setups for kills and other assorted mixing tools.

Red Infader Digital Mixer:

http://www.hollywooddj.com/hollywooddj/redinfader.html

Details:

Introducing the World's First Digital Mixer for DJ's Digital mixing
offers
incredible audio fidelity, inherent reliability and noise-free fading.
With its modular construction, the RED Sound INFADER allows the user to
choose from a number of crossfading options including the patented
Tri-Fader. This convention-shattering device allows DJ's to crossfade by
selectable bands of frequencies. And with many more modules in the
pipeline, InFader is sure to become a dance classic.

Overview The main mixer section features 2 x input channels with 3 band
EQ
(+4/-85dB) and selectable balanced microphone/line level input section
with 2 band EQ. The 'multi-tap' effects send/return loop lets you choose
exactly where to pick-off and return the signal for effects processing
and
also doubles-up as an auxiliary stereo line level input for expanded
input
capability. With balanced master outputs, crossfader curve control and a
comprehensive monitoring section, INFADER delivers professional mixing
performance at an affordable price. All high usage faders and knobs are
microprocessor controlled assuring extra long life for major hardware
components.

Tri-Fader Module Patent Pending By expanding the traditional single
crossfader section to incorporate 3 crossfaders, each with it's own
high-order digital filter, crossfades can now be broken-down precisely
into low, mid and high frequency bands for stunning crossfade mixing.
For
example, the lows from one track can be mixed with the mids and/or highs
from another. Additional features include 3-way/single crossfader
select,
reverse function and crossfader 'centre-off' option.

Forthcoming modules for INFADER will include: BPM Module - single
crossfader, V2 BPM engine with 2 x BPM readouts, audio/MIDI sync

BPM Sync Module - single crossfader, 2 channel beat matching, basic
punch-in FX

BPM Auto-Sync Module - single crossfader, 2 channel CD/Vinyl deck speed
control system for automatic BPM lock

BPM FX Module - single crossfader, Multi BPM effects with 2 x BPM
readouts

Filter Module - details TBA

SIN! Tonight! Message Tonight's the night, Sinners. Head on down to the Raw=
hide with Wrath in your hearts and beat that bad relationship karma out of =
our heart shaped pinata!  Here's how it's gonna work: If you've been jilted=
, rejected, slimed, or maligned in the last year, write the name of the dir=
ty, rat bastard on the side of the pinata entitled, well, "Dirty Rat Bastar=
ds!" If, on the other hand, you're one of those, smarmy, self-satisfied hal=
ves of a happy couple, write down both of your names on the side entitled "=
Happy Couples." Then, all you single people out there who rightfully despis=
e the lot get two shots at breaking the heart, unleashing a torrent of safe=
 sex products and winning you a two free passes to the new, super swank, Sa=
n Francisco playspace known as the Citadel!  -Father Dan Welle Nosebest -  =
PS.Tonight, the SIN!ema will be showing cautionary tales of Wrath gone just=
 a little too far: Anger Management, The Hulk, and Serial Mom.

Are you suffering from ROMANCESTIPATION?

Been rejected lately? Can't get on with life because you're still blocked u=
p from your last relationship? Still smarting over that goodbye note scrawl=
ed on a Post-It? Sick and tired of hearing about your ex's perfect new girl=
friend with her perfect job and her Perfect Hair And HER PERFECT, um, well,=
 you get the idea. What you are suffering from is what we here at the First=
 Church of the Second Friday call "romancestipation." In order to have any =
chance of nooky in the Year of the Monkey, you must clear this blockage bef=
ore Valentine's Day, and we have just the Sin to help you do it!
Through years of study and meditation and, well frankly, more than a few re=
ally bad breakups and wasted years spent mooning over what could have been =
if they hadn't left us when we needed them most and, um NEVERMIND! Where we=
re we? Oh yes, through years of intensive study at the school of hard knock=
s, we have determined that the Sin most useful for clearing your karma befo=
re entering the romantic new year is the Sin of WRATH. Yes, there's nothing=
 like the cleansing fire that is ANGER to clean out the pipes of any left o=
ver rejection refuse and bad breakup bilge.
So how do you express this Wrath toward that special someone who really des=
erves it without the requisite stint of hard time in your local penitentiar=
y? By looking fabulous and beating the cr*p out of them ? IN EFFIGY! That's=
 right, effigy! We have procured Hers and His pi?atas that we have stuffed =
with the accoutrement of cheap and meaningless (but safe!) sex! Come on dow=
n to SIN! on Friday the 13th in your sexiest outfit and scrawl the loser's =
name or tape a special memento on the outside of the appropriate pi?ata and=
, at midnight, queue up to take a symbolic whack with the First Church's ow=
n Louisville Slugger. Do it, and as the pi?ata cracks and single-use latex =
goods come raining down, you'll feel the bitterness just drain away ? SIN! =
- where letting go feels a lot like getting even!

------------------------------------------------------------------------
This Reclaim The Streets event is being used in part to help bring together=
 the SF "activist" community, with the underground artist/performer communi=
ty, and the late night dance/music communities. =A0We all experience first =
hand the increasing intrusiveness of state repression. =A0Art, performance,=
 music, dance, these are the things that celebrate life and should be held =
up and revered in our society. Instead however, it is these very things tha=
t are constantly trying to be squashed. =A0If you want to have an art exhib=
ition, a performance, a concert, or a party, you have to jump through all s=
orts of bureaucratic hoops, pay for all sorts of permits, and then IF they =
approve of things, you are allowed to have your event. What happens if you =
don't have the means to meet all of their ridiculous standards? What if you=
 don't have the money to pay for all of their permits? Your options include=
 not having the event at all, or having it anyway illegally. And so we have=
 these unpermitted events. Often. And almost as often we have them shut dow=
n by the police. Or they just come in and harass people. For what? For enjo=
ying life? For celebrating that which makes us human? But we're experiencin=
g it more and more. And now they have the RAVE act at their disposal too. A=
nd it is going to continue to get worse until we rise up and say "Enough!"
=A0
So that is part of what we're doing with this RTS. Showing that if you
won't let us have our events in our own spaces where we aren't bothering an=
yone, than we are going to take it to the streets and have our events there=
!
=A0
For more info about RTS itself, you should go straight to the source. These=
 two links are from the London RTS group which began RTS originally way bac=
k in the day. They're a bit long, but very worth reading.

As many of you may know already, Mirage first appeared as a Wednesday club =
night here in San Jose. Unfortunately, as with many nightclubs in the scene=

to you. Returning to the source of power are Mirage resident DJs: Michael L=

Subject: [sfraves] some remixes added to my CD  (bsp again)

I'm adding some "DJ remixes" to fill up space since
there were only 6 hip-hop tracks on the new CD. 
"She's Crafty" and "Wild Thing" are new.  

I also re-did "For What It's Worth" hella violenter, 
with in-yo-face 9/11 sass-back.  I figure we no longer
need to baby ourselves from the shock, and start
reflecting critically.  Now  with more guns and bombs
and people screaming!  I'm sure David Crosby would be
pleased.

Some of the remixes are rudimentary, recorded when I
was just learning the ropes, so please don't get all
sad & pouty that I haven't added complex 303 
basslines to Peter Gabriel.  The AndyW remix for
example, could barely even be called a remix, but it
took me 12 hours to do.  OK, I was on acid at the
time.

Send me your snail addy if any of these songs pique
your interest more than my hippie-house honky-hop, and
I will mail you a CD.  Track listing below.

And if you want, you can send me some of your own
beats for me to fuck around with.   All this music is
stolen, so it'd be nice to have original breakbeats or
hip-hop instrumentals.  I won't use your beats for
profit without negotiation first.

What this says to me is that too many whites are getting away with drug
use, too many whites are getting away with drug sales, too many whites
are getting away with trafficking in this stuff. The answer to this
disparity is not to start letting people out of jail because we're not
putting others in jail who are breaking the law. The answer is to go out
and find the ones who are getting away with it, convict them and send
them up the river, too."

- Rush Limbaugh. October 5, 1995 show transcript.

"Opinions are my own only, and do not necessarily represent those of
KZSU Radio or Stanford University." (or words to that effect.)

Word. And if you're coming to OW, be sure to get there early so you
catch a set chock full 'o chunky deep house, broken beats and other
dubby stuff, compliments of shazbot. Free CD's await those who arrive by
11pm, but hurry--supplies are limited.

Happy valentine's day, peeps!

Subject: [sfraves] Thursday night review: Uplift

OK... so like Thursday night was fuckin' Awesome man!  I seriously had a Groovy night...Gosh... OK... so like I had class 'til like 9:45-10 & didn't get 2 Sublounge 'til later than i usually got there on Uplift nights... so i caught a good portion of Jack Triumph's Proggy House set... mmmmmm... Yummy!  He even threw in a Proggy Breakbeats track just 4 me like he told me he was gonna do earlier Thursday...

Oh Yeah... upstairs was all about Proggy House & alota Vocal House also I knew all the DJs up there... but like can't remember like who they were w/o the bsp...

Anyway, Forest went on next & well... due 2 technical difficulties, only like 1/2 her set was well, done.. I mean... it was a split set literally...she started out playin like these Heavy Percussion Salsa Techno tracks that were totally fun, shit happened w/ equiuptment, then she jus played a techno set after the drama but played some Awesome tracks in between all her split set... does that make like sense?

OK... then like Ethan went on next & fuck man... his set went fuckin' everywhere, he played some house, he played some techno, but oph my fuckin' goodness man... HE PLAYED SOME ACID!!!  LoL.. as soon as he walked in Sublounge & we both like greeted each other & small talk, how U been, la la la... I asked him if he brought any acid & he told me that from the looks of the crowd, they really wouldn't be ready 4 it, but he had some acid he brought if he saw fit 2 spin them... so yeah... Hello 2Day, anywaze, I'm like dancing 'cause fuck man... Ethan set was well... a much needed dance floor "I had a semi shitty week so i'm gonna dance my ass off" thingie... not 2 say that i wasn't groovin during the other sets & diggin' them... but oooh man.. 

So anywaze, Ethan busted out with Acid Break Beats towards the end of his set & jus about then, I was in Hevean!  I mean... good fuckin' Shit... yeah... totally Awesome man 'cause I was jus totally feelin' it!  LoL... I <3ed it so much.. Thanks Ethan!

Oh Gosh... then Calamity Jane went on next & ofcourse her set was fuckin' Bad Ass as usual... mmmmmmmm... Breakbeats!!!  Wow.. i jus realized i been talkin' alot about breakbeats in the post... lol... Love 'em!

OK.. but @ the same time... JC was upstair spinnin this like Multi Genre enduced House set & yummy, he dropped hella vocal house as well... OH yeah... & it was totally fun 2 like dance 2 while i was playin Tekkan... anywaze.... ok... he fuckin' dropped like this old school Techno track in the middle of his set & man... it was fuckin' well... i was dancing then slowly realized that my dance steps changed & were totally moving hella differently...  Hello 2day.. Loved it!!!

As 4 people there... it was your usual kinda mixed vibe, mixed people, but all groovers!  Not alota family was there, but it was Awesome seein' like SirNod pop up all outta the blue since he like rarely goes out these nights... LoL... yeah... i got this funny story of a picture  of my & Sirnod's big ass pudgy hands giving me a CD while i'm rollin' while workin' a coat chack shift @ a party a loooooong time ago... wait.. i think i jus told the story,,, oh... i gotta shouw y'all the pix.. 

but yeah... it was a nice crowd & saw alota people & more importantly, i got a ride home 2 Hercules!!!  It was Dope... i been emailing w/ this Dude like well... a week & a 1/2 prior... & although he lives like totally opposite from East Bay... he said he'd bring me home if i made it Sub Lounge... this Dude btw, Ewan, bad ass fuckin' Proogy/ Tech house DJ!

OK... well.... i manage 2 write more on here than the paper i'm suppose 2 b working on right now 4 school... lol.. so i think i better get off my study break... it's jus' i been meaning 2 write about uplift & finally had the time 2 do it now... lol

Take Care,
Peace-> O§bY {8O)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Derrick Carter Fri, Otherworld Sat.

I don't think anyone who paid for that party felt ripped off, it was by far
the best night I've had at Mezzanine.  Amazing music all night long, the
sound system was actually tweaked out properly and sounded great, and the
crowd was probably the most chill, gettin' down and dancing group I've run
into in SF.  Best night out I've had in a loooooonnngggg time, almost makes
up for last time DC played at Ruby Skye, ugh.

Subject: [sfraves] SRR:  please help me with my project

Hey all.  I'm writing a thesis on the history and culture of electronic
dance music and I would very much appreciate it if some of you could help me
out.  If you just have a moment in your day when you're not doing anything,
I would absolutely love it if you could just take the time...I have no money
to do formal interviews at this time but i'm looking into funding...

Ok, so...What I need:  write down all the genres of electronic dance music
you can think of and then write down the best descriptions you can come up
with for each genre.  I don't expect anything as extensive as ishkur's
guide, but a few sentences per genre would help me out greatly.  If you
don't have time to describe all the genres you can think of, just jot down
the names and describe the "main" ones (whatever that means to you).

Thanks SOOOOO much.

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Comcast, issue ads and free speech

An especially interesting case involves the Marijuana Policy Project, a
D.C.-based advocacy group engaged in a little-noticed legal struggle
that could have far-ranging implications. The group wants presidential
candidates to firm up their positions on the medically-accepted value of
marijuana in treating certain serious illnesses (cultivation and
possession is currently allowed in eight states with physician's
approval but totally forbidden by federal statute.) MPP planned to place
about $10,000 worth of issue ads in New Hampshire in anticipation of
that state's primary. But when their local rep contacted
ComCast -- America's largest cable company -- for a rate card, they
were told that the corporate legal department would not make one
available to the organization. This was based not on the ad content
-- the company hadn't even seen that yet -- only on the name of the
sponsoring organization.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii


Mattel recently announced the release of
Limited-Edition So-Cal dolls for the Southern
California market: 

Irvine Barbie: 
This princess Barbie is only sold at The Irvine
Spectrum. She comes with an assortment of Kate Spade
handbags, a Lexus SUV, a long-haired foreign dog named
Honey, and a cookie-cutter house. Available with or
without tummy tuck and facelift. Workaholic Ken sold
only in conjunction with "augmented" version.

Tustin Barbie: 
This modern-day homemaker Barbie is available with
Ford Windstar minivan and matching gym outfit. She
gets lost easily and has no full time occupation or
secondary education. Traffic-jamming cell phone sold
separately. 

Van Nuys Barbie: 
This recently paroled former "Porn Actress" Barbie
comes with a 9mm handgun, a Ray Lewis knife, a Chevy
with dark tinted windows, and a meth lab kit. This
model is only available after dark and can only be
paid for in cash. Preferably small, untraceable bills
... unless you are a cop, then we don't know what you
are talking about.

Santa Monica Barbie:
This yuppie Barbie comes with your choice of BMW
convertible or Hummer H2. Included are her own
Starbucks cup, credit card, and country club
membership. Also available for this set are Shallow
Ken and Private School Skipper. You won't be able to
afford any of them.

Fontana Barbie: 
This pale model comes dressed in her own Wrangler
jeans two sizes too small, a NASCAR shirt, and Tweety
Bird tattoo on her shoulder. She has a six-pack of
Coors Light and a Hank Williams, Jr. CD set. She can
spit over 5 feet and kick mullet-haired Ken's ass when
she is drunk. Purchase her pickup truck separately and
get a confederate flag bumper sticker absolutely free.

Newport Beach Barbie:
This collagen injected, rhinoplastic Barbie wears a
leopard print bikini outfit and drinks cosmopolitans
while entertaining friends at the beach house.
Percocet prescription available.

Riverside Barbie: 
This tobacco chewing, brassy-haired Barbie has a pair
of her own high-heeled sandals with one broken heel
from the time she chased Beer-Gut Ken out of Fontana
Barbie's house. Her ensemble includes low-rise
acid-washed jeans, fake fingernails, and a see-through
halter top. Also available with a mobile home.

Laguna Beach Barbie:
This doll is made of actual tofu. She has long
straight brown hair, archless feet, hairy armpits, no
makeup, and Birkenstocks with white socks. She prefers
that you call her "Willow". She does not want or need
a Ken doll, but you if purchase two Laguna Beach
Barbie's and the optional Subaru wagon, you get a
rainbow flag sticker for free.

Long Beach Barbie: 
This Barbie now comes with a stroller and infant doll.
Optional accessories include a GED and bus pass.
Gangsta Ken and his '79 Caddy were available, but are
now very difficult to find since the addition of the
infant.

Rancho Santa Margarita Barbie:
She's perfect in every way. We don't know who Ken is
because he's always away hunting.

City of Industry Barbie:
This Spanish-speaking-only Barbie comes with a 1984
Toyota with expired temporary plates and three baby
Barbies in the back seat, but no car seats. The
optional Ken doll comes with a meat-packer's uniform
and is missing three fingers on his left hand. Green
cards are not available for City of Industry Barbie or
Ken.

West Hollywood Barbie/Ken:
This versatile doll can be easily converted from
Barbie to Ken by simply adding or subtracting the
multiple "snap-on" parts.

Subject: [sfraves] SFLNC:  LEGISLATION TO ALLOW 18+ AFTERHOURS 

--=====================_26283093==.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed


LEGISLATION TO ALLOW 18+ AFTERHOURS

I'd like to inform everyone about another exciting legislative development 
intended to bring the fun back to San Francisco's entertainment 
scene.  Supervisor Bevan Dufty and the San Francisco Youth Commission have 
teamed up to introduce legislation that would allow 18+ Venues to apply to 
the Entertainment Commission for an after hours permit.  This legislation 
will be heard at a special session of the City Services Committee of the 
Board of Supervisors on Thursday, Feb. 19th at 5 pm in Rm. 263 of City Hall.
Some of you may remember that this legislation was up a year ago, sponsored 
by the SFLNC and (then) Supervisor Mark Leno.  Unfortunately, it was vetoed 
by Mayor Brown and the Supervisors could not overturn his veto.  It is a 
sad fact that the City of San Francisco will send our young adults to war 
but will not allow us to stay out dancing after 2am.  In contrast, most 
major US Cities allow 18+ afterhours events and some, such as Los Angeles, 
even allow all age events to go all night.

Supervisor Dufty's Ordinance would simply allow Places of Entertainment that:
(1) are "bona fide public eating places" (which have a Type 47 liquor 
license that allows 18+) or
(2) do not have a liquor license
to apply to the Entertainment Commission for an after hours permit.

We need a strong turnout at the hearing to help carry this bill into 
reality.  We have a new Mayor and a fresh chance to give our youth the 
right to dance all night!  As a 20 year old, it is not a moment to soon.

Check out 
<http://sflnc.com/index/readthis/news/youth_crisis/>http://sflnc.com/index/readthis/news/youth_crisis/ 
for the text of the Ordinance, a resolution from the Youth Commission 
declaring a "public health" crisis for Youth in San Francisco, for media 
articles on the 18+ legislation and more...

Spread the word!

"Security is mostly a superstition.  It does not exist in nature, nor do 
the children of humans as a whole experience it.  Avoiding danger is no 
safer in the long run than outright exposure.  Life is either a daring 
adventure or nothing."
-Helen Keller

"Fascism should more properly be called corporatism because it is the 
merger of state and corporate power."
-Benito Mussolini

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

Psychedelic Pioneer Humphry Osmond Dies
http://www.erowid.org/culture/characters/osmond_humphry/

British psychiatrist and psychedelic researcher Humphry Osmond died on
Feb 6, 2004 at the age of 86.  Osmond worked with mescaline and LSD in
the 50s and 60s, primarily seeking treatment possibilities for
alcoholism and schizophrenia.  He is best known for coining the term
"psychedelic" in a letter to Aldous Huxley in 1956.

"Security is mostly a superstition.  It does not exist in nature, nor do 
the children of humans as a whole experience it.  Avoiding danger is no 
safer in the long run than outright exposure.  Life is either a daring 
adventure or nothing."
-Helen Keller

"Fascism should more properly be called corporatism because it is the 
merger of state and corporate power."
-Benito Mussolini

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Comcast, issue ads and free speech


An especially interesting case involves the Marijuana Policy Project, a
D.C.-based advocacy group engaged in a little-noticed legal struggle
that could have far-ranging implications. The group wants presidential
candidates to firm up their positions on the medically-accepted value of
marijuana in treating certain serious illnesses (cultivation and
possession is currently allowed in eight states with physician's
approval but totally forbidden by federal statute.) MPP planned to place
about $10,000 worth of issue ads in New Hampshire in anticipation of
that state's primary. But when their local rep contacted
ComCast -- America's largest cable company -- for a rate card, they
were told that the corporate legal department would not make one
available to the organization. This was based not on the ad content
-- the company hadn't even seen that yet -- only on the name of the
sponsoring organization.

$25 for a club night period is a rip off. Unless you're talking a Thump like
party at 550 where you have several rooms and assloads of talent playing.
Last time I saw Mark Farina play it was sunny, warm, and FREE. I know you
have the lubs for Derrick Carter, but jeezuz $25? No way in hell. If clubs
want to keep that crap up I'll fully withdraw from things.

I have many old flyers.... some extras, 1990-present... Most are part of a
permanent collection that expands, this private collection is available
for viewing per the availability of the collection's maintainer.

Quick side note:

Is anyone here familiar with copyright law and intellectual property to
know how and when it applies to flyer creation, flyer distribution, event
flyer promotion and flyer archives (original and digital formats,
derivative works thereof)?

There are many extras in my collection from 1990 - present which are
available for trade.

Thanks

Karina

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Looking for past event flyers

Vestax is all over Ebay and no from distributors. It is probably illegal
to use their logos or claim to be a distributor. If you are selling a
Vestax product you have the right to tell people what you are selling.
If you use the name but are not selling the product just trying to get
people to look at your auctions then I could see them getting a bit
pissed. 

On the note of flyers I used to have a huge box of flyers from 92-95
from the bay area but my ex-girlfriend has probably long since burned
them.

Vestax is all over Ebay and no from distributors. It is probably illegal
to use their logos or claim to be a distributor. If you are selling a
Vestax product you have the right to tell people what you are selling.
If you use the name but are not selling the product just trying to get
people to look at your auctions then I could see them getting a bit
pissed. 

On the note of flyers I used to have a huge box of flyers from 92-95
from the bay area but my ex-girlfriend has probably long since burned
them.

I think only all of that is true if someone has their logo trademark =
registered n such.=20
That, and everyone who knows that persons logo, and who it belongs to =
would prolly be pretty pissed at the person who stole it.

like I have my logo sorta thing on my site, http://www.hard-grooves.com
I created it myself pretty much, and haven't ever seen anything like it. =
But it's not registered.
I prolly should tho.

I guess theres lots of things I "prolly should" do. . .=20

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR:  The Next 18 Days.... Be Careful

dude

ok, I wrote a bunch on this but deleted it.

simply, there aren't words in any language to correctly decipher what goes
on in ones minds eye.
It's easily misinterpreted, and miscommunicated.

don't worry about anything.

keep yourself open to see for yourself.

psychics can see things, but they can't truly convey their visions perfectly
to non-seers.
and there are consequences for a persons misuse of energies.

all in all, don't listen to psychics who exploit their "visions" on tv and
radio shows. their visions will typically be tainted in ways. not everyone
is meant to know certain things, or many things.


uuuh, yeah.

well theres hell of a lot more too it, but its one of those things that if I
had to teach it to everyone, they weren't really supposed to know it
anyways. It's like one of those catch 22 things.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] GO GO Gavin, gay marriages

You got off on a tangent there a bit Aryck, but as to the *who did any wrong
to anyone else* part...

Really this comes down to legalities in extending benefits to same sex
partners.

Suddenly businesses will have to extend the healthcare benfits they offer to
the same sex partner of their employee. That's more money out of pocket for
the businesses. That's the main financial problem I see a lot of people
pissed off over.

By having some form of government OK a same sex marriage suddenly
legitimizes same sex relations which scares the crap out of those scared of
change. Suddenly children are exposed to confusing family roles that aren't
inline with what they see in their hetero families. It's a direct challenge
to world religions that have been teaching people that gay is wrong for
thousands of years. It's a wrench in the works of what's become comfortable
and acceptable in our society. Change is coming...

Overall I think the *wrong doing* is merely the fear of change that's being
created. I fully support the marriages and think it's a great act of civil
disobedience. I whole heartedly hope that this paves a way for equal rights
to all citizens of this country to marry whom they choose. Well, maybe not
like your sister or your cousin, but you get what I mean. =)

I just wonder how long it will be before another government entity steps in
and stops the marriages in SF... I'm betting less than a week before we see
the GOP shit a brick and come running to shut it all down.

lives and land from all sorts of people for any reason they wanted
to.Seriously, practically all people who routinely are known for cheating on
their husbands/wives are christian or catholic or whatever. Kids aren't
going to start killing people just cuz these so called rules aren't there.
It's basic belief that killing people is bad, that cheating on loved ones is
badd. . .

I'm so so happy to see that these huge organizations are not getting their
way. It's about friggin time.

there just might be hope for the world yet !

exactly.  the lineup of live acts is so phenomenal...you could get rid of 
ALL the DJs and still have an incredibly bad ass show.

i  mean, would you rather hear radiohead live...or watch some dude standing 
behind turntables playing someone else's music?

if i had any musical talent or the ability to play an instrument...i'd much 
rather be doing that than pretending to be a DJ.  :(

Subject: Re: [sfraves] GO GO Gavin, gay marriages

yknow, I was thinking about that too, as far as the who if effects is
concerned.

But is there somehow more of an impact on insurance companies etc, than
there would be if the same person married the opposite sex ? Maybe males are
typically hurt or damaged than females, but wouldn't the ins companies make
up for their losses with the girl/girl relationships ? If that was the case.

I think it all comes down to that one nation under god thing. How marriage
is typically defined as a man and a woman. So really it's just a moral view
of the people in power thats influencing all of this and not really a
financial or economic matter. The fact that it's just merely a matter of
religious or moral opinion being forced upon a country of varying beliefs
and values, and the freedom it takes from such a growing population of
people is just wrong, and kinda rediculous actually.

I was really really suprised that that law actually ever passed. It's so
restricting of peoples opinion for unrealistic reason. I think the major
reason its in effect now and people have their political standpoints on the
issue is simply just for their own political benefit, cuz if the president
said he supported it he would be likely to lose millions of voters' support.
People "should" have the thoughts and morals leading to the greater good of
the world and not just strengthening the power behind their own beliefs.
That actually in a lot of ways is almost unrealistic due to the vast
majority of people who believe otherwise, but in no way is that the
ultimately positive approach to making the world a better place for the next
generations. Does that make sense ?

it's unfortunate that the world will keep going such a restrictive direction
unless millions of people toss away the beliefs they've been taught for
hundreds of years. It's almost a losing battle, but at least I feel that
it's a battle worth fighting and losing rather than not fighting at all.

still it gives a lil glimmer of hope. . .

Subject: Re: [sfraves] PRETEND DJS - Coachella 2004... have you seen this line up?!

Nothing on Brandon here, just a more general thought, but....

How many people think our scene is being ruined in part by people pretending
to be DJs?  It's so easy to buy decks and a mixer and play make believe vs.
buy a guitar and play make believe, but people out here think it's okay to
charge money for you to watch themselves and their friends play make
believe.

I've been to way too many pay events in the last year or so with DJs that
were so bad it made me cringe.  I go out less because of it, if I see a Bay
Area club or underground consisting of a bunch of names I haven't heard of,
I just assume that most of the lineup is going to suck balls, and I don't
go.  It seems like so many people out here book themselves or their friends
when they should really give some serious thought as to whether others are
going to enjoy hearing them play...

I dunno, maybe it's just me, I played every day for three years before I
played out for my first time, I really wanted to have pride in what I was
doing when people heard me for the first time.  All I know is I've heard
some great talent on this list and around the Bay, I've heard bunch of DJs
that bring it, but they are overrun by such a sea of mediocrity that it
dilutes things at an average party.

Andrew,

I wouldn't say it's "pretending", but I just think that a lot of people =
want to obtain a goal without doing the work to get it.

BTW-
Like you, I've been practicing for three years, I've only played live =
twice (except for a few small parties), both times I felt like I made a =
few mistakes. I wasn't pretending though...

Subject: Re: [sfraves] PRETEND DJS - Coachella 2004... have you seen this line up?!

..and that is how I feel about the graphic design market these days. Too
much pixel pushing *i can fuck with photoshop but illustrator scares me*
designers. Talk about pretending... the flood of *graphic designers* that
occured in the .com boom where anyone who claimed to be capable of design
was hired soon flooded the market in the .com fallout. The industry is still
recovering from all the fake asses out there... oh and now you have little
high school kids out there undercutting real designers by charging next to
nothing and providing horrible work. It kills me when I see people stroking
ego on these fucks that can't design and have no concept of why the work
they do really is remedial.

I share your grrr. I also agree with the statements about dj's here. I don't
go out because a lot of the time the music and the skill of the DJ is so
fucking horrible that I end up feeling like I'm having my time wasted. I
don't like my time wasted unless I'm actively choosing to do so.

Subject: [sfraves] Call for Action to Legalize 18+ Afterhours!

Please Forward Widely!

WHAT:  Call for Action!

WHY:  To allow 18+ entertainment events to go past 2 am in SF!

WHEN:  Thursday, February 19th, 5 pm

WHERE:  City Hall, Room 263

HOW: Come down and testify, just show up and cheer, or send an e-mail to our Supervisors and Mayor!


Hello,

My name is Liam Shy and I am the Media and Public Relations Officer for the San Francisco Youth Commission and the Youth Action Coordinator for the San Francisco Late Night Coalition.  As most of you know, current City law forces 18+ entertainment events in San Francisco to shut down at 2 am.  This outdated law is why parties like Skills must end at 2 a.m.

As a young DJ and lover of electronic dance music, it has been an outrage that San Francisco has not offered it's young adults a legal permit for all night dancing.  Los Angeles, Seattle, Portland, New York, Chicago, and many other cities allow their young adults the right to dance all night.  Yet here in San Francisco we are told to go home at 2!

The sad part is, this archaic law could have been changed last year, when similar legislation was passed by the Board of Supervisors but was successfully vetoed by former Mayor Willie Brown.

But..... Supervisor Bevan Dufty has recently introduced a new draft of the legislation, giving us another shot.  We have a new Mayor and a fresh chance to give our youth the right to dance all night!  As a 20 year old, it is not a moment to soon.

Supervisor Bevan Dufty has introduced a new draft of the legislation, giving us another shot.  We have a new Mayor and a fresh chance to give our youth the right to dance all night!  As a 20 year old, it is not a moment to soon. 

Please take 5 minutes to send an e-mail in support the San Francisco Youth Commission and our project to make our city more youth friendly.

Here are some points to emphasize in your email:

- In the subject line, include "Support 18+ Afterhours" or something similar

- 18 year olds can vote and go to war, yet cannot dance after 2 a.m. in San Francisco.  That's just not fair.

- Los Angeles, Seattle, Portland, and many other jurisdictions allow their 18+ events to go all night

- San Francisco youth have few entertainment options, passing this law will encourage local business to produce 18+ events.

- Permitted late night venues provide safe environments for young adults.

 
Please send the emails to: Aaron.Peskin@sfgov.org; Jake.McGoldrick@sfgov.org; Michela.Alioto-Pier@sfgov.org; Fiona.Ma@sfgov.org; Matt.Gonzalez@sfgov.org; Chris.Daly@sfgov.org; Tony.Hall@sfgov.org; Bevan.Dufty@sfgov.org; Tom.Ammiano@sfgov.org; Sophie.Maxwell@sfgov.org; Gerardo.Sandoval@sfgov.org; Gavin.Newsom@sfgov.org

This legislation was sponsored by the San Francisco Youth Commission and is strongly supported by the SFLNC.  Read more at http://sflnc.com/index/readthis/news/youth_crisis/

Spread the word!

Definitely happens.  Was at an event Fri. night, and the DJ was posing
so fierce behind the decks, obviously really FEELING himself, while
trainwrecking left and right.  And I mean trainwrecking, not just
slightly off.  And it HURT!

Maybe you could print up some fliers for this class at Berklee
college in Boston, and then hand one out when a DJ "needs help".

http://www.cnn.com/2004/EDUCATION/02/18/music.dj.class.ap/index.html

But more common than just plainly bad technical skill is:

- DJs that seem to play whatever they want, whether it makes people
  dance or not. I'm not talking about one bad night. They don't get
  it. I call them musical masturbators. I want to dance. Get it?

- Promoters not giving enough thought to whether a DJ and what they
  tend to play is appropriate for the crowd and time. I call these
  bad promoters. IT IS NOT EASY TO BE A GOOD PROMOTER. It takes a
  lot of connections, a lot of skill, and truly evil desire to make
  people shake their booties off.

I think some cronyism is okay... often it results in more enthused
DJs. And tribes like to be tribes. But I've seen it all too often
ruin an event for me. "It was pretty, but I really wanted to dance."

I dunno, I've seen dj's who had been spinning for only two months come out 
and blow peopel away, and I've also seen dj's who have been at it for 10 + 
years who suck complete ass. I think the problem is, there're just too many 
people that have no clue whether or not they suck because no one ever told 
them as much, or they have hookups that will just book them because they're 
owe them a favor or are friends or what have you. You can't really 
pigeonhole people by time behind the decks or lack thereof. I blame it more 
on the phenomena of too many people trying to ride the "dj as a rockstar" 
wave...people who have put no effort into it whatsoever (time or otherwise), 
and who want to just "be cool".

Maybe they blew someone away? But there's no chance they were really any
good.

I've seen people who have very little technical skill have
unbelievably good track selection skills. And vice-versa.

I think the very best DJs ever have one thing in common: An
absolute lust for wanting to make people dance. They're the ones
that make people scream, and that help make the parties that
become legend.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] PRETEND DJS



1998 - Kdvs 90.3 on Tek-Induced Euphoria... 

Of course this shouldn't stir pictures of the two fake mixing.

Rather, after making specific demands for high end equipment, the host
of the show called and asked if I would bring my own decks & mixer for
the guys (which I kindly loaned the station and drove 20 miles round
trip).  We set up, we test it all out - it's ready to go.  M&M show up -
and all they have on is a DAT player and a tape.  Don't ask me why... 

They played the DAT.

People called in during the interview session to congratulate them on
such a great set.

"Thank you"... Was repeated a lot.

I only wish they had said something akin to: "thanks, but that was a
recording of blah blah blah" or something...

It's a much funnier story after I've had a few beers...

; )

I know this is tongue-in-cheek, but for its literal meaning I must
disagree. Perhaps it may have been true once, for me, but now there
is *no* amount of drugs that will make a shitty DJ sound great. I
wonder how that's true for other peeps.

Ooooooh I'm gonna have to ask her sometime. Ask Terrac about
concerts he's been to with fake DJing. He's got some good ones.
He really loved this one by Moby, because Moby didn't even pretend
to be spinning, was just jumping all over the place :).

I disagree...a good friend of mine that goes by the name of BAKE out on the 
East Coast was a total and complete natural. He was spinning on the level of 
someone who had been spinning (well) for at least a few years around 3 
months after he picked up spinning. He was being booked at big clubs around 
5 months after starting, and there was HUGE response to his skill. That is 
just one example that I can PERSONALLY reference....

I think there is a certain "natural talent" that is involved, but =
natural talent will only take you so far without hard work behind it.

Kinda like the person that wins the lottery or lawsuit, but goes =
bankrupt and isn't happy because he/she hasn't learned the real value of =
money through hard work.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] PRETEND DJS - Coachella 2004... have you seen this line up?!

See - what kills me is - so many people still take dj'ing WAY too seriously. 
I mean, as much as I LOVe to spin, and when I've spun a nice set, it makes 
me feel good, I know that I'm still doing nothing short of playing someone 
else's music sheerly for the love and to try and make people dance. Any DJ 
who ISN'T scratching and cutting and employing hardware, gear, whatever ON 
TOP OF dj'ing has no room to act like they're a pimp. Once you get past 
learning the basics of phrasing and beatmatching - any monkey can dj. It's 
not that damn hard. If you have decent track selection and any CLUE as to 
how to work a crowd - that's just the bonus on top.

I have played in both bands and as a DJ, and dj'ing (just mixing) is easy 
cheesey compared to say - playing a guitar.

I blame the notion that DJ'ing as a technical artform on the whole 
"superstar dj" problem. Too many idiots who feel that playing records is 
actually a job that SHOULD pay thousands of dollars per night. Fucking 
rubbish.

Two more words - DAVE CLARKE

One of the most god-awful dj's I have EVER had the displeasure of hearing
"spin". Or should i say "trainwreck an entire set from start to finish".

I was told afterwards it was "because he was drunk". Then he came back to
the same club a year later, and repeated this mess- without having one drop
of alcohol.

So, unless he can't hold his drugs, then he just sucks asshole on the decks.

That's interesting because some of the best live mixes I've heard have
been Dave Clarke mp3s.  Scratching, doubles, all sorts of tricks all
spot on.  I guess it just goes to show that sometimes you're on, sometimes
you're not.

I dunno - I dl'd some MP3 sets of his to compare as well, and I thought they

not good. I just think he ought to stick to producing....

You can find Promo copies of "Krunk" by Slyde (on Finger Lickin' Records) on
eBay. At least - that's the last place i saw a promo of it.

But that particular track is all over the place right now...the promo is
exactly the same as the mass produced copy.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] PRETEND DJS

Sean,

	Excellent point. I think a lot of times when people are talking about 
how good or bad a particular DJ (or DJs) are, they forget that there 
are at least two totally different skills involved. And as you said, 
someone may be good at one and not the other. Of course a certain 
amount of it will always be subjective, since people enjoy hearing 
different sounds. One person's series of awful trainwrecks may be 
another's cool, experimental, industrial set.

	Of course I would probably tend to argue that poorly blended tracks 
are objectively *not* good music, even if someone may occasionally 
enjoy listening to it, but I'm sure that someone would disagree with 
me. There are, after all, people who believe anything that anyone calls 
art is art, and that no art is any better than any other art.

Groove on,
							<<< Starchild >>>

1. It wants to run some javascript foo to "Add this station to
   my presets."

2. It requires a login before one can do so.

Could you please post a saveable .pls? That's what works for
everyone. Thanks!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] GO GO Gavin, gay marriages

I dunno.... I can't help bt be of two minds on this one....


On the one hand:

I do agree that marriage is a fundamental right that should not be 
denied to any human; and especially not based on their sexual 
orientation.  I'm not particularly ready to GET married, myself.  And 
when I find out how young some people ARE getting married, I'm like... 
"WTF...  you're still so young...  you have your whole lives ahead of 
you and you're settling down and going domestic NOW????"  Hell, I'm 
closer to 30 than 20, and I still think *I* am too young to be married! 
  But WTF.... I still think it should be EVERYONE's right to have that 
choice.

As a bonus, pretty much anything that pisses off the xtians, the 
republicans, and their ilk, gets two hearty thumbs up from me.  And 
this sure has a lot of them riled up.


But on the other hand:

It is perfectly obvious to me that this is nothing more than a public 
relations ploy by "da mayor", as part of an effort to fool the gullible 
into beliving that he is not the right-wing ogre that he is.  He may 
masquerade as a liberal by claiming to be a democrat.  But he's 
certianly *NOT* left-of-center.  To see the REAL progressives in the 
mayors race, look to those who ran againse newson.  Look to Tom Ammiano 
and Matt Gonzalez.

Basiclly, we have willie brown Mk. 2...  another mayor who pretends to 
be liberal in order to get votes, but is really well to the right of 
the opposition.  The only difference seems to be that while brown was 
open in his corruption and pandering to the conservative intrests in 
SF, and indeed, he seemed to revel in it; gavin newsom is aparantly 
employing some PR people, and throwing the city's progressives a bone.

And make no mistake.  This is just a zero-risk publicity stunt on the 
part of newsom.  He KNOWS how close he came to losing the election to a 
REAL liberal.  He KNOWS that the progressives smell the blood in the 
water, and will be going for his throat; and might just cut it, in the 
next election.  This gay-marriage stunt is an easy way for him to 
appear to be the liberal choice, without having to actually take a 
stand.  Because, let's face it, as much as I'm sure we'd all love to 
see these marriages stand, the chances that they won't be overturned 
are very VERY slim.

If someone does the right thing, but for entirely the wrong reason... 
does he deserve our admiration?  I'd say: "no".


cya,
john

Is there any company worth working for that doesn't ALREADY offer 
partner benefits???  Every company *I*'ve worked for, so far as I can 
recall. does (or did, when they existed, anyway).  Hell, even IBM, the 
canonical "stodgy old conservative dinosaur" of companies, offers 
partner benefits.  (Though I must admit, I was suprised as hell when I 
found this out.  Turns out, not only does Big Blue offer partner 
benefits, they had a big booth at Pride a couple of years ago! (That's 
actually how I found out that IBM had gotten with the times.)).  Even 
the low-pay customer service job I'm working at, to make ends meet, NOW 
offers partner benefits!

That's a pretty large thing to say- where do you draw
the line?
When "gay marriage" was being discussed several months
ago (some other state- dont remember)- there was what
I saw as a very hypocritical response from certain
gay-community leaders- that being "disgust" at the
comparison of gay marriage to polygamous marriage.

They are both "non-traditional" unions that from a
common-sense point of view seem to harm nobody
whatsoever.

"Marriage" should be *solely* a religious act, and
have no bearing upon taxes, inheritance, familial
rights, or anything else.  Legitimizing "gay marriage"
just furthers the legitimization of "marriage", and
reflects IMO a rather short-sighted view.

One of my professors had an interesting insight on this.

He thought it was very telling that people had bought into the institution
of marriage so readily, that they were /happy/ that they could do it. He
was mystified. Put it on par with women wanting to be police officers and
serving in the armed service. "Those are probably the two crappiest jobs
you can have. A cop and a soldier. Why would you WANT that job?"

you know something Ak, it is cool for the gays to be come one with each other 
with marriages i got no problems with that in fact overtime i come to the bay 
area to a massive rave or a mini massive i always see this one guy he is 
Asian his name is anarchy he is the most sweeties guy i have ever meet in fact he 
was at Love, Cold Phusion & Planet New Years. i just know that if you love 
some one to fallow your heart that goes for all even pets. It is super duper 
grate that your mayor of SF is going all out to help your city I am from yuba 
county and well I drive 3-4 hours just to come to the bay area because it is filed 
with the most nicest and best people you will ever meet. as well as your 
assholes. 

Well I give your mayor 2 thumbs up for passing or letting gays become married 
:-) amen to that.

aparrently 2600 gay couples have been married in SF in the past couple weeks 
despite CA state law disapproving same sex marriages. Like 170 recieved 
licenses yesterday. There was a line outside city hall 2 hours before they opened 
today.
I think theres another court hearing on the subject scheduled for march 29th.

I love this. It's awesome to finally see a mayor that defies the state law 
for something they believe in. Even mr terminator is opposed to gay marriages 
(or so he says).

SF is issuing marriage licenses to gay couples until courts formally tell 
them the must stop.

A lady (obviously a closet dyke, and opposing) on the news brought up the 
issues about all sorts of lawsuits that may be a result of this. My question is, 
who's going to sue who ? Who did any wrong to anyone else ? Marriage as a 
whole should be supported, to whoever it is, as long as it's between people who 
love eachother. Thats what our kids should learn, and thats whats important.

It pissed me off to see all the local homes around here posting their signs 
to vote against the gay marriage rights of couples. And I think the whole 
voting deal was somewhat biased since some of the only places around here offering 
voting thingies (whatever the hell theyre called) were in churches.  Every 
house that I knew had assholes living in em had these signs showing their 
closed-mindedness, the drunk ones that'd yell at me when I drove by, all the mormons 
that are everywhere around here, the old mean people. . .

Personally I hate how christians (mainly) are trying to twist the govmt 
around to favor their own freedom and not the freedom of EVERYONE. Like the 10 
commandment issue. How many groups are trying to keep the 10 commandments out of 
public schools, and religious shows saying that without the commandments, that 
the kids will learn to cheat, and steal, and kill, and commit adultery. 
Christians are some of the biggest murderers of all time, kings have changed the 
bible to suit their own wants, they literally stole lives and land from all sorts 
of people for any reason they wanted to.Seriously, practically all people who 
routinely are known for cheating on their husbands/wives are christian or 
catholic or whatever. Kids aren't going to start killing people just cuz these so 
called rules aren't there. It's basic belief that killing people is bad, that 
cheating on loved ones is badd. . . 

I'm so so happy to see that these huge organizations are not getting their 
way. It's about friggin time.

there just might be hope for the world yet !

We've got a local house head dropping by and he's already dropping some
REALLY tasty  selections.  The "he" I refer to is JJ Islas.  He's
bringing us a true San Francisco style house set today, leading up until
11a (but really something you might normally have expected to hear
at around 3-4a in an old dirty warehouse back in the day.)  So do listen
in between now and 11a.

The usual bat channel: 90.1 FM, or online at

Peace!

I agree with this, however, I don't think that the gay community is
asking for a federally-sanctioned way into a religious institution.  I
think the main reason it's being thought of as the "gay marriage issue"
is that the term "marriage" has no religious charge for most people
anymore.  To most, it represents solely the legal and personal joining
of a couple.  

If I were gay and somebody told me, "It's wrong for you to get married,
but maybe I can deal with you obtaining a civil union", I think I'd
feel a bit disenfranchised that my love was seen as something only
bindable by a clinical-sounding legal contract.  The larger issue,
though, seems to be, where is the separation of church and state on
this?  This is like the gov't selling prayer licenses.

If a heterosexual atheist couple want to get hitched, what right have
they to "marriage" if it's an intrinsically religious ceremony?  What
about a satanist couple?

Just stirring up trouble,
George

RAD. Now what's funny is I know of people that have bought them not for =
the player, but the Hitachi 4GB Microdrive inside. See if you have a =
dSLR camera you need lots of storage. Retail on that microdrive is $499, =
but buy an iPod Mini or a Creative MuVo for $250 or $299 respectively =
and you get the drive for a serious discount. And yeah... just hack the =
gear open and take out the drive which is no different than a retail =
microdrive! Still the same Type II CF format.

Yeah, it was nice and tasty!  TOTALLY brought back a great vibe of a
sweaty dark warehouse. :)

BTW, if anyone was taping, it'd be great to get a copy.  The MP3 we were
recording ended up being 0 bytes, so we don't have our own copy. :(

Subject: Re: [sfraves] GO GO Gavin, gay marriages

thinking about it, yeah

marriage SHOULD be mainly a religious joining of people who love eachother.
It shouldn't be controlled by laws, or courts, or whatever.
But it's not like that. Judges marry people. It's like signing a contract
nowadays, you have to pay money to get married, pay lots more if you want to
have a divorce granted to you. You should be able to start and stop it when
you want to for whatever reason you choose to. I don't think it should have
bearing on peoples incomes, or bank accounts, or things like loans,
mortgages, etc, but it does. At least so called traditional marriages do.

I don't like either direction of traditional marriages. I'm not christian,
I'm wiccan. And I wouldn't want to go to a judge and get married cuz I don't
think it's the states decision for such a thing. But as far as I know,
wiccan marriages aren't legally accepted in CA. For me marriage would just
be like a blood promise to someone I loved that I would be there for them
forever if not longer. It should just be a ceremony significant to the
couple being joined, but thats not how it is anymore.

With all the legalities involved, it's weird to see the country sticking to
the whole man/woman thing. It's kind of a religious act, but the counrty
treats it all like a business merger or something.

either way, if it was religious based, then it should be between people who
love eachother no matter who they are. If it's legally based, then why is
there such a stress off it being wrong for two men or two women to get
married when it's pretty much just a legally binding "on paper" type of
agreement, thats all contracted out n such.

Someone told me the other day that Dennis Rodman married himself ? is that
true ? Mormons traditionally could have several wives legally, and in some
states that's recognized as legit, not A man and A woman like mr bushie
says.

Anyone watch divorce court on tv ? Thats just a big huge shiny example of
some of the things most fukked up about marriage these days in all sorts of
ways.

the whole issue just contradicts itself back and forth in lots of ways. Shit
you have to get a license to get married even. I'm suprised that people
aren't arrested for having sex without a license.

when and if I get married, it'll be me n my partners ceremony. I'll give
them half of my everything in life and they'll do that for me, but not cuz a
court tells us to, but cuz we want to. Of course that probably won't be
"legal" but thats not the point. I'd hate to have to hire a lawyer to write
up pre-nuptual contracts n such, and another to enforce them if we happened
to split up.

the whole gay marriage thing, I suppose most of these people just really
wanted a nationally recognized joining rather than a between them thing.
They just want the same rights as most everyone else in this country, and by
them being gay, the country is basically saying it's illegal for them to
ever get married.

I wonder if someday you'll be able to get married over the internet. . .

I think people figure they're doing their duty or doing their part to do
good for the world.
Like in the movie Saving Private Ryan, most of those people prolly thought
the same thing.

you'd think it was a way to make the world safer or better for your kids and
such, but really it's just doing another persons bidding without question,
whether its the right thing to do or not.

I wonder how many soldiers died in wars that they didn't believe in and
maybe totally disagreed with, even tho they went into the military because
they wanted to fight and do good for their country. . .probably thousands
and thousands. . .

and coppers who become coppers cuz they were mugged and shot once before,
and wanted to help rid the world of that stuff,  but end up arresting lil ol
ladies,  and putting them in jail for life because they had some pot on them
or were taking their medicine, which coincidentily the copper used to also
partake of in his/her day.

it's all pretty screwed up

I agree, and the state has no business establishing religious dogma via a 
constitutional amendment or other means to force others who are not 
Christians or others who have beliefs in the "sanctity" of marriage to 
accept those beliefs by force of law.  Funny, isn't it, that one of the 
Christian denominations was founded by a King (Henry VIII) who wanted to 
divorce at will to meet his needs? He just changed the rules and started 
his own church, the Church of England.

This is a complex issue, however, with a philosophical, romantic, legal and 
political dimensions.

The mass marriages at City Hall are, to my mind, a powerful symbolic 
gesture.  My home town, Pittsburgh, is a pretty conservative place but this 
morning the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette ran this on the editorial page:  "...As 
symbolism it has struck a deep chord, dramatically illustrating the hunger 
of gay couples for official recognition, something that any compassionate 
society would attempt to accommodate..."  So far I understand 2,400+ 
couples have stood in long lines and paid fees to demonstrate that 
need.   One would like to have one's relationship honored and respected by 
the commonweal.

But there are political dimensions here also.  I agree with John B that 
Gavin was motivated more by political than philosophical beliefs in taking 
this action.  That's life in the political world.  Conservatives will use 
this move to fuel a backlash against gays and move to take legal actions on 
the Federal level.

Even the gay community, however, is not united in support of the 
institution of marriage.  They believe it's an outmoded institution;  puts 
folks into an emotional and sexual box;  and turns love into a business 
transaction, or worse, mutual hatred.  Then there is the issue of 
monogamy.  Traditional "marriage" supports fidelity.  I think, 
however,  couples define the parameters of their relationships, not the 
state, regarding monogamy and other crucial areas of the relationship. 
Emotional fidelity -- love if you will -- is far more important to 
longevity than physical fidelity.  Passion often overrules reason, 
especially in subcultures where folks are ambivalent at best about sexual 
fidelity.  I've found that compassion and complete honesty are crucial to 
the success of long-term relationships and these virtues, again, arise from 
love.

The legal implications of the City Hall marriages are, at best, 
ambiguous.  Those who now have Domestic Partner benefits may lose them on 
both the state and local level.  Looks like the state will not recognize 
these marriage licenses when they arrive in Sacramento.

I have a personal interest in all this, I must add.  This year my partner 
Joey and I will have been together 25 years.  We were in the first group to 
be registered as Domestic Partners in San Francisco a few years ago and 
were "married" by the mayor and a group of supervisors at a ceremony in the 
Opera House.  Couples were called up to the stage, and we all exchanged 
promises in front of this vast group of well-wishers and press.

Marriage, civil unions, or whatever one wants to call them, provide the 
needed legal and other structures necessary for responsible relationships 
and basic rights.  Back when lots of gay men were dying every day with AIDS 
their partners were often treated with contempt by blood relatives and 
others; prevented from visiting the partner in the hospital;  or even 
attending the funeral. Many were tossed out into the streets without the 
monies and property both partners had worked hard for.  Sure, one can write 
wills and powers of attorney.  There are many firms with domestic partner 
benefits.  But entering a long-term relationship, if your seriously 
committed, requires some structure for both partners.  I've also seen cases 
where two people have lived and built a life involving property 
accumulation, and one day a partner decides to throw the other out with 
nothing.

Since this December marks our 25th anniversary, Joey and I will wait until 
then to "marry" if this option is still available in San Francisco.  If 
not, we will have another commitment ceremony.  But until these marriages 
are recognized by the State of California and the Federal government I 
doubt there will be many benefits and the ceremony, again, will be largely 
symbolic.  Long ago Joey and I created legal constructs that assure 
property and other safeguards, like will and Powers of Attorney to cover 
illness and death.

Love,

Apollo

hey whats up peeps

I just sold a set of these to some dude in BC Canada. I had a chance to =
check em out before I sent them and they're easily the sickest Technics =
I've ever seen (even better than the 20th (or25th) anniversary gold =
ones).

check em out:
http://www.hard-grooves.com/Store/Store-Info/Technics/sl1210mk5g.htm
or my EBay store
http://stores.ebay.com/hardgrooves

If any of you cool cats are interested. For a limited time I'll sell a =
set to SFR peeps for
$1,050.00 +tax/S&H

I also have the SL1200mk5, I lowered the price a lil, so if SFR peeps =
want these guys it'll only run em
$871.00 +tax/S&H (for two)

I could also hook you up if you wanted a set of Ortofons, or Sicmats =
with the Technics order.

(like, prices subject to change without notice)
: )

Most everywhere you look on the web is charging $598.99ea. Also, most =
sites have the info wrong on the pitch specs, it's +- 16%, not 18%. Plus =
most sites don't really have much info at all or even the right pics.

These tables have some awesome features. The added pitch control, stop =
brake adjustment. . . One of the main reasons I went to Vestax, was cuz =
the Technics only had an adjustable pitch of 8%. Now I have the pdx =
2300's, but if I didn't I would definately get the 1210mk5G's.

take care all

There are tons of scams like this, purporing to be from Paypal and
Citibank and whatnot. You should never enter any personal information in
response to a link in any email. Emails are incredibly easy to forge, and
legitimate financial institutions will never communicate about private
information over email with you.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] nrr: Fraudulent Earthink Emails asking for CC info

it actually looked legit,

here was the link:  http://www.earthlink.net/?action=billing.htm

Earthlink.net is the actual earthlink site, following the link everything
looks legit also.

how do they spoof web addresses ? Earthlink told me it was fraudulent also,
but I was curious about that. Does it have something to do with the ?action
?

That link just goes to Earthlink's the main page. This address is probably
what the email page is displaying to you, while the real link address
(where you go when you click on the link) points to some server in Russia
or somesuch. There are several ways to do this. One of the most commonly
used methods was removed in the latest Internet Explorer security patch.

Josh The Funky 1 is badass - I caught him in DC a couple years back and he 
tore it the fuck up. Techno, house, breaks all with mad scratching and shit. 
Nice guy to boot.

Just thought I'd share :)

Historic Online Protest

It's time for music fans to stand up and demand change from the music 
industry's copyright cartel.

Tuesday, February 24 will be a day of coordinated civil disobedience: 
websites will post Danger Mouse's Grey Album on their site for 24 hours in 
protest of EMI's attempts to censor this work.

"Security is mostly a superstition.  It does not exist in nature, nor do 
the children of humans as a whole experience it.  Avoiding danger is no 
safer in the long run than outright exposure.  Life is either a daring 
adventure or nothing."
-Helen Keller

"What difference does it make to the dead, the orphans and the homeless, 
whether the mad destruction is wrought under the name of totalitarianism or 
the holy name of liberty or democracy?"
-Mahatma Gandhi

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

 cartel

Danger Mouse is a marketing genius. And he blurs the line even better than

Saturday, February 21, 2004 ** ***Mirage*** presented by Illumination Recor=
ds, Hardscience, and friends **

As many of you may know already, Mirage first appeared as a Wednesday club =
night here in San Jose. Unfortunately, as with many nightclubs in the scene=
, the venue was sold and new owners came in to change the club into a blues=
-rock bar. Mirage with its family and friends enjoyed a fun 2003 run and th=
e night vanished just before winter. Recently, we were told that Mirage wil=
l once again take shape in February. All who were involved with Mirage will=
 return to help recreate the magic and build a safe-haven for its reappeara=
nce. As the prophets give us more information, we will forward the details =
to you. Returning to the source of power are Mirage resident DJs: Michael L=
iu (Illumination Records), Denise (Sound Asylum), Dragn'fly (Shaolin), Maje=
re (Elektrosorcery), and Proteus (Vibe Rite). Crisp clean concert sound pow=
ered by Logik Pro. Much more information to follow on this all ages event..=
=2E If you wish to help direct your positive energies to the rematerializat=
ion of Mirage, please get in touch.

everyone is a friggin dj these days. it's the quality
that makes dj's stand out. i stopped playing for a
while because everytime i went out i was surrounded by
kids who have been playing for a year or two thinking
they were the shit. sorry to sound high and mighty but
the new generation of "dj's" is killin' me.

"Security is mostly a superstition.  It does not exist in nature, nor do 
the children of humans as a whole experience it.  Avoiding danger is no 
safer in the long run than outright exposure.  Life is either a daring 
adventure or nothing."
-Helen Keller

"What difference does it make to the dead, the orphans and the homeless, 
whether the mad destruction is wrought under the name of totalitarianism or 
the holy name of liberty or democracy?"
-Mahatma Gandhi

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

Subject: [sfraves] srr. Mysterious Skin Parasites/Disease Quickly Spreading in CA n others

hey all

I know this is really becoming a large issue. Most people don't think much
about it, tv coomercials promote products left n right about "germs" which
really are insignificant compared to the damage this other mystery disease
is causing. Some of the main hotspots in the country are centered around LA
and SF.

It's really creepy, scary, absolutely horrible. Theres more and more people
every day coming out with this illness. A lot of these people are being
institutionalized because everyone they know and turn to think they're
crazy, but it's definately real. It's a relatively unknown epidemic thats
plaging thousands of people. Doctors are pretty much completely uneducated
on the subject, and some who seem like they might know something end up
hiding it like some sort of conspiracy. Even the CA state health department
is ignoring the matter.

I think this is a serious issue for people like us, who frequent parties
with large numbers of close quartered people, in old wherehouses, buildings,
and areas that are likely to be heavily infested with these creatures. It IS
an issue, regardless of who thinks it won't effect them. It can effect you,
it might be already.

here are some sites that would be good to look thru for info:
http://www.morgellons.org  (read thru the history of morgellons)
http://www.skinparasites.com  (general knowledge and support forums)

There will be an upcoming news bit on a major tv network airing in the next
week or two.
I'll keep people updated on when it's coming out.

Also, it's very important that if someone thinks that they may have this
sickness, that they know they can recieve support from others who do believe
them in the above places. But pleeeeeeese, be respectful if you read thru
the discussion lists, watch what you say, but feel welcome in learning about
this. A lot of people are exteremely uncomfortable being labeled as
druggies, or crazy, or dirty, or anything regarding an unknown disease. None
of them are, they're all wonderful people. Just please take care (and give
care) if you read thru them.

take care of yourselves. . .

aK

hello, this is a continuation of a fictional piece:
 
while oscar took care of the twins, oscar's wife took care of him, and they celebrated a lovely week of holidays and disease as a family... a real family...the kind of family that everyone aspires to, but that only four tribes on the planet actually have...the kind of family that sets an example...the kind of relationship between a husband and a wife that defeats even death itself...:)

Hey everybody, 
       I was wondering if anybody knew about any big raves coming up soon?  I 
myself have only been to two raves and that was about two years ago, so I am 
not quite up with the rave scene or know much about it.  I have a guy friend 
thoug hat has never been to one and wants to go, so I was wondering if you guys 
can tell me about a few coming up that would be a good experience for the 
both of us and have use wanting to go to more.  I was also wondering if you guys 
could give me a few do's and don't's pointers on raves and ecstacy because my 
friend and I would also like to experience that to as well. Thanx

             ~Eve

Subject: Re: [sfraves]Any big raves coming up for first timers???

hey what do you call those, is that an oxymoron ? or is an oxymoron a single
word with contradictory pieces, not two words like "big rave" ? Or is it a
totally diffirent word, if like an object or person or something has a name
that contradicts it's characteristics, like a tiny car called The Beast, or
a huge guy named Tiny ?

just wondering

Subject: [sfraves] srr. AIDS as a Scietifically Manufactured Disease, designed to control population

hey all

I got this info from somewhere ? I forgot where exactly.

It's pretty interesting, read thru the site and theres strong evidence and
explanations. It mentions in the beginnning that AIDS was created in 1971 to
thin out the Black population. You can print out the flowchart but theres a
$7 paypal fee to DL it.

Hey, you need to get your information from more reliable sources than what
you've been posting (cross posting in fact) to the list. This is bunk. HIV
has been around at least since the 50s, and possibly earlier.

have you ever read like Weekly News and World Reports, or those mags you see
on shelves by the checkout lines. Not enquirer, but the ones that have pigs
saving their farmers life from pulling him out from under a tipped over
vehicle, stuff like that.
A lot of the stories are just completely outrageous, obviously untrue, like
"I saw satan in my cereal" or thngs like that, but some other ones like
alien sightings and such actually could have more truth to them then people
think. They just seem like outrageous issues and most people assume they're
completely false from the beginning and never take any time to investigate
really, to see if theres any truth at all to them.

hello, this is a continuation of a fictional piece:
 
whenever oscar's children made it to the candy box, they knew that those were the left overs. kind of like oscar's boss going to a rave. the boss knew that the boss would never be invited, so when the boss found out about the raves, the boss would go to the wrong ones.  :)

Who knows?  We all live in a consensus reality and if we didn't we would 
probably all need hefty supplies of valium or somethin'....

For example, this just comes across my desk.  Enjoy yourself.  It's later 
than you think:)

Now the Pentagon tells Bush: climate change will destroy us

· Secret report warns of rioting and nuclear war
· Britain will be 'Siberian' in less than 20 years
· Threat to the world is greater than terrorism

Mark Townsend and Paul Harris in New York

Sunday February 22, 2004: (The Observer) Climate change over the next 20 
years could result in a global catastrophe costing millions of lives in 
wars and natural disasters..

A secret report, suppressed by US defence chiefs and obtained by The 
Observer, warns that major European cities will be sunk beneath rising seas 
as Britain is plunged into a 'Siberian' climate by 2020. Nuclear conflict, 
mega-droughts, famine and widespread rioting will erupt across the world.

The document predicts that abrupt climate change could bring the planet to 
the edge of anarchy as countries develop a nuclear threat to defend and 
secure dwindling food, water and energy supplies. The threat to global 
stability vastly eclipses that of terrorism, say the few experts privy to 
its contents.

'Disruption and conflict will be endemic features of life,' concludes the 
Pentagon analysis. 'Once again, warfare would define human life.'

The findings will prove humiliating to the Bush administration, which has 
repeatedly denied that climate change even exists. Experts said that they 
will also make unsettling reading for a President who has insisted national 
defence is a priority.

The report was commissioned by influential Pentagon defence adviser Andrew 
Marshall, who has held considerable sway on US military thinking over the 
past three decades. He was the man behind a sweeping recent review aimed at 
transforming the American military under Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld.

Climate change 'should be elevated beyond a scientific debate to a US 
national security concern', say the authors, Peter Schwartz, CIA consultant 
and former head of planning at Royal Dutch/Shell Group, and Doug Randall of 
the California-based Global Business Network.

An imminent scenario of catastrophic climate change is 'plausible and would 
challenge United States national security in ways that should be considered 
immediately', they conclude. As early as next year widespread flooding by a 
rise in sea levels will create major upheaval for millions.

Last week the Bush administration came under heavy fire from a large body 
of respected scientists who claimed that it cherry-picked science to suit 
its policy agenda and suppressed studies that it did not like. Jeremy 
Symons, a former whistleblower at the Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA), said that suppression of the report for four months was a further 
example of the White House trying to bury the threat of climate change.

Senior climatologists, however, believe that their verdicts could prove the 
catalyst in forcing Bush to accept climate change as a real and happening 
phenomenon. They also hope it will convince the United States to sign up to 
global treaties to reduce the rate of climatic change.

A group of eminent UK scientists recently visited the White House to voice 
their fears over global warming, part of an intensifying drive to get the 
US to treat the issue seriously. Sources have told The Observer that 
American officials appeared extremely sensitive about the issue when faced 
with complaints that America's public stance appeared increasingly out of 
touch.

One even alleged that the White House had written to complain about some of 
the comments attributed to Professor Sir David King, Tony Blair's chief 
scientific adviser, after he branded the President's position on the issue 
as indefensible.

Among those scientists present at the White House talks were Professor John 
Schellnhuber, former chief environmental adviser to the German government 
and head of the UK's leading group of climate scientists at the Tyndall 
Centre for Climate Change Research. He said that the Pentagon's internal 
fears should prove the 'tipping point' in persuading Bush to accept 
climatic change.

Sir John Houghton, former chief executive of the Meteorological Office - 
and the first senior figure to liken the threat of climate change to that 
of terrorism - said: 'If the Pentagon is sending out that sort of message, 
then this is an important document indeed.'

Bob Watson, chief scientist for the World Bank and former chair of the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, added that the Pentagon's dire 
warnings could no longer be ignored.

'Can Bush ignore the Pentagon? It's going be hard to blow off this sort of 
document. Its hugely embarrassing. After all, Bush's single highest 
priority is national defence. The Pentagon is no wacko, liberal group, 
generally speaking it is conservative. If climate change is a threat to 
national security and the economy, then he has to act. There are two groups 
the Bush Administration tend to listen to, the oil lobby and the Pentagon,' 
added Watson.

'You've got a President who says global warming is a hoax, and across the 
Potomac river you've got a Pentagon preparing for climate wars. It's pretty 
scary when Bush starts to ignore his own government on this issue,' said 
Rob Gueterbock of Greenpeace.

Already, according to Randall and Schwartz, the planet is carrying a higher 
population than it can sustain. By 2020 'catastrophic' shortages of water 
and energy supply will become increasingly harder to overcome, plunging the 
planet into war. They warn that 8,200 years ago climatic conditions brought 
widespread crop failure, famine, disease and mass migration of populations 
that could soon be repeated.

Randall told The Observer that the potential ramifications of rapid climate 
change would create global chaos. 'This is depressing stuff,' he said. 'It 
is a national security threat that is unique because there is no enemy to 
point your guns at and we have no control over the threat.'

Randall added that it was already possibly too late to prevent a disaster 
happening. 'We don't know exactly where we are in the process. It could 
start tomorrow and we would not know for another five years,' he said.

'The consequences for some nations of the climate change are unbelievable. 
It seems obvious that cutting the use of fossil fuels would be worthwhile.'

So dramatic are the report's scenarios, Watson said, that they may prove 
vital in the US elections. Democratic frontrunner John Kerry is known to 
accept climate change as a real problem. Scientists disillusioned with 
Bush's stance are threatening to make sure Kerry uses the Pentagon report 
in his campaign.

The fact that Marshall is behind its scathing findings will aid Kerry's 
cause. Marshall, 82, is a Pentagon legend who heads a secretive think-tank 
dedicated to weighing risks to national security called the Office of Net 
Assessment. Dubbed 'Yoda' by Pentagon insiders who respect his vast 
experience, he is credited with being behind the Department of Defence's 
push on ballistic-missile defence.

Symons, who left the EPA in protest at political interference, said that 
the suppression of the report was a further instance of the White House 
trying to bury evidence of climate change. 'It is yet another example of 
why this government should stop burying its head in the sand on this issue.'

Symons said the Bush administration's close links to high-powered energy 
and oil companies was vital in understanding why climate change was 
received sceptically in the Oval Office. 'This administration is ignoring 
the evidence in order to placate a handful of large energy and oil 
companies,' he added.

     An oxymoron can be a phase or a statement as well, it doesn't have to be 
a single word, for example the "dodge ram" is a ridiculous oxymoron, you 
either dodge or you ram. or George Bush's "war for peace".... I totally disagree 
though that "big rave" is an oxymoron. I think people who say that are people 
who don't want the scene to expand, don't appreciate newbies and they want to 
feel like they're special because they were a part of something before other 
people knew about it.
 I can see how like original punk rock fans don't like the new phase of blink 
182 boppers and OG gangsters don't like all this bubble gum rap on the radio 
these days... but that's because punk and gangster rap were founded with a lot 
of negativity and elitism, in their lyrics and their attitude and all that. 
Raves were founded in Europe with a sense of love and unity. Raves in Europe 
are now 10 times bigger than what we call "massives" here in the states. Just 
the word "rave" it self sounds like something big doesn't it? Unity means 
everyone doesn't it? Usually when you see the word "unity" you think of the world or 
at least the nation, you don't think about small elite secretive groups.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] srr. AIDS as a Scietifically Manufactured  Disease, designed to control population

hey I know this one. . .

I've been saying that to people for a while now, it seems like every year
theres record weather. Hotter hottest days of the year with colder coldest
days of the year, bigger drought issues with more flooding every year. The
extremes on both sides seem to be constantly rising.

to me this is a sign that theres some sort of degradation of the earths
protective sheild from the outer space elements, or maybe even a slight
degradation of the planets ortbital patterns n such. Either way it's getting
worse and will only be a matter of time til the extremes end up strong
enough to destroy life. . .

sounds crazy huh, I also think that yeah it's too late to do much about it
because the process has already started, how would you undo global damage ?

its not fun to think the worlds gonna end, so most people kinda live happily
in their denial until the day comes when the end is here, then they prolly
still don't believe it's happening.

THE RISE OF RAVE

The documentary Rise has an accompanying compilation CD, with a part of
proceeds benefiting the Electronic Music Defense and Education Fund, or
EM:DEF.

Rise: The Story of Rave Outlaw Disco Donnie only tells part of Estopinal's
legend.  The film, documenting the "Zoolu" parties held at the State
Palace during Mardi Gras weekend, was already in the editing stage by the
summer of 2000, when the DEA raided the State Palace Theatre.  "I really
wanted to interview Donnie and keep going," says director Julie Drazen,
"but I couldn't.  I was under pressure because Donnie had become my
friend."

The film was nearly finished by the end of 2000, but Drazen and producer
Summer Forest Hoeckel sat on the project for fear its contents would
damage Estopinal's case.  Eventually, they made a special section on the
case for the DVD release of the film, due out next month.

A Brooklyn-based filmmaker and DJ, Drazen, 33, had finished making a film
about the Dutch rave scene titled Digital Overdose when she learned about
the Freebass Society parties.  "I heard there were whole parades going
through these parties," recalls Drazen, "it sounded like an amazing
juxtaposition." She set out to make a short film when she began shooting
during Mardi Gras 1999, but the DVD version of Rise runs a feature-length
70 minutes, not including its four bonus sections.

Rise weaves a montage of images of the State Palace raves with more
visible elements of Mardi Gras, juxtaposing laser lights, digital images
and glitter-laden ravers with parade floats, public nudity and
evangelists.  The film follows Estopinal from a West Bank bar to a Jackson
Square tarot card reading, through the crowd on the Canal Street sidewalk
and even into a backstage bathroom, where he takes a call from a bouncer
at the front door.  Throughout the film, characters from ravers to DJs
praise Estopinal and his parties.  In one series of cut-aways, two of
Estopinal's friends recount an incident when they were literally knee-deep
in money while working in a ticket both at one of his parties.

The film also follows two ravers named "Colin" and "Jenny" through the
process of going out to a State Palace party.  They decide what to wear,
how to get there and whether or not to take Ecstasy ( Colin says no, Jenny
says maybe ).  More eccentric character sketches include close-ups on a
cross-dressing "rave performer" named Goddess and a costumed ex-stripper
wearing a neon green wig.

"The documentary is crap," says one local rave scene insider.  "Those
people are not really a part of our scene, and there's no such thing as a
'rave performer.'" Drazen says the film is meant to depict the wider
international rave phenomenon and the realm of possibilities it presents.
"The fact that these parties happened during Mardi Gras is unique, but I
wanted the film to be more global, to show what raves are about using this
as an example."

The Rise project also yielded a CD featuring sound bites from the film and
tracks from many artists who performed at State Palace parties.  ( A
portion of proceeds from CD sales benefit the Electronic Music Defense and
Education Fund, or EM:DEF.  ) Released by Los Angeles-based Utensil
Recordings and spearheaded by music consultant and superstar techno DJ
Josh Wink, the soundtrack includes tracks by Thievery Corporation, the
Crystal Method, Charles Feelgood and DJ QBert.  Liner notes by DJ Tommie
Sunshine proclaim, "No one in America has kept the heady ideals of the
early rave scene intact like Disco Donnie," and praises Estopinal for
"fighting for our constitutional right to dance the night away to the
music of our choice." -- Diettinger

DID BUSH DROP OUT OF THE NATIONAL GUARD TO AVOID DRUG TESTING?

The Young Pilot Walked Away From His Commitment In 1972 -- The Same Year
The U.s.  Military Implemented Random Drug Tests.

One of the persistent riddles surrounding President Bush's disappearance
from the Texas Air National Guard during 1972 and 1973 is the question of
why he walked away.  Bush was a fully trained pilot who had undergone a
rigorous two-year flight training program that cost the Pentagon nearly $1
million.  And he has told reporters how important it was to follow in his
father's footsteps and to become a fighter pilot.  Yet in April 1972,
George W.  Bush climbed out of a military cockpit for the last time.  He
still had two more years to serve, but Bush's own discharge papers suggest
he may have walked away from the Guard for good.

It is, of course, possible that Bush had simply had enough of the Guard
and, with the war in Vietnam beginning to wind down, decided that he would
rather do other things.  In 1972 he asked to be transferred to an Alabama
unit so he could work on a Senate campaign for a friend of his father's.
But some skeptics have speculated that Bush might have dropped out to
avoid being tested for drugs.  Which is where Air Force Regulation 160-23,
also known as the Medical Service Drug Abuse Testing Program, comes in.
The new drug-testing effort was officially launched by the Air Force on
April 21, 1972, following a Jan.  11, 1972, directive issued by the
Department of Defense.  That initiative, in response to increased drug use
among soldiers in Vietnam, instructed the military branches to "establish
the requirement for a systematic drug abuse testing program of all
military personnel on active duty, effective 1 July 1972."

It's true that in 1972 Bush was not on "active" duty: His Texas Guard unit
was never mobilized.  But according to Maj.  Jeff Washburn, the chief of
the National Guard's substance abuse program, a random drug-testing
program was born out of that regulation and administered to guardsmen such
as Bush.  The random tests were unrelated to the scheduled annual physical
exams, such as the one that Bush failed to take in 1972, a failure that
resulted in his grounding.

The 1972 drug-testing program took months, and in some cases years, to
implement at Guard units across the country.  And the percentage of
guardsmen tested then was much lower than today's 40 percent rate.  But as
of April 1972, Air National guardsmen knew random drug testing was going
to be implemented.

During the 2000 campaign, when Bush's spokesman was asked about the
possibility of Bush facing a drug test back in 1972, the spokesman told
the Times of London that Bush "was not aware of any [military] changes
that required a drug test." Still, at the time when Bush, perhaps for the
first time in his life, faced the prospect of a random drug test, his
military records show he virtually disappeared, failing for at least one
year to report for Guard duty.  White House officials insist that if Bush
missed any weekend Guard drills in 1972, he made up for them during the
summer of 1973.  If this is true, he would have been vulnerable to random
drug tests during his makeup days.  But again, Bush's own discharge papers
fail to conclusively back up his claim that he performed Guard service in
1973.

"Nobody ever saw him" serving in 1973, notes author James Moore, whose
upcoming book, Bush's War for Re-election," will detail Bush's military
record.  "Not a single soul has come forward to say, 'I remember the
summer of '73 when I did Guard training with George Bush, the future
president of the United States.'"

Moore notes that Bush's discharge papers make no reference to service in
1973.  The last entry in Bush's papers are for April 1972.  Also, if Bush
had served in 1973, there would have to be an Officer Effectiveness Rating
for that year in his military file.  There is not.  Nonetheless, in late
1973 Bush received an honorable discharge in order to attend Harvard
Business School.

During the early stages of his 2000 campaign for president, Bush was
dogged by questions of whether he ever used cocaine or any other illegal
substance when he was younger.  Bush refused to fully answer the question,
but in 1999 he did issue a blanket denial insisting he had not used any
illegal drugs during the previous 25 years, or since 1974.  Bush refused
to specify what "mistakes" he had made before 1974.

Perhaps realizing that explanation pointed reporters toward possible drug
use during his time as a guardsman, Bush insisted he hadn't taken any
drugs while serving in the Texas Air National Guard, between 1968 and
1974.  "I never would have done anything to jeopardize myself.  I got
airborne and I got on the ground very successfully," he told reporters on
Aug.  19, 1999.  But today we know that for his last 18 months in the
Guard, from April 72 to late '73, Bush didn't have to get airborne,
because he simply quit flying.  Moreover, if Bush in fact took no drugs at
all after 1968, that would mean his drug use, if any, stopped at age 22 --
an unusual age to swear off recreational substances for someone with the
partying reputation Bush had at that time.

Unanswered questions continue to swirl around Bush's Guard service in part
because he refuses to release the full contents of his military records.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] My latest track, please review, need feedback!!!! please!

perhaps it's all the Ketamine in my diet, but I like the track quite a bit.  
It's trancy, and I'm not one for trancy things, but the panning work is 
pretty brilliant and it follows the true lines of what progressive trance 
should be.

Subject: [sfraves] Re: [scr]  srr. Mysterious Skin Parasites/Disease Quickly  Spreading in CA  n others

hehe,

it's cool to be cynical, but by no way is it a chupacabra, or something that
has to be "believed in".
It is real, and it does effect people in these areas. Moreso also than any
other area in the country. I believe it's due to the issues and
complications involved with the population density and visitors to the
areas.

lemmee, think . . .

well, hmm. . .I guess it doesn't matter who I tell now .. .

Well KTVU just left my house a lil bit ago, I was being interviewed cuz I'm
one of these people with this mysterious skin disease. (thats kind of a load
off my back)
I've had this over a year now, I've gone thru the worst this disease has to
offer. No one believed me till I found those websites and spoke to people
like me, and still I felt as if I was so worse off cuz I had all of those
symptoms plus some. . .it is an absolutely horrible disease. . .during it my
body was being destroyed, I was sick constantly, getting weird infections
here and there, dealing with the lesions that randomly appeared all over my
body. . .there were times when things got so badd that I was actually
starting to go nuts, I was stuttering a lot, I had a hard time completing
coherant sentences. . .I got out of that, but it shows how much strain
mentally this puts people thru. Since no one believed me, my friends,
family, the doctors I saw. . .theres no real cure, or chemical that's
worked. . .Theres just no where to turn.
I could go into what I've seen but it would take quite a while, I will if
you want. I've seen things on a weekly basis that I never could have
imagined would ever happen. It's really something like out of an old horror
movie. Scary shit like large bumps moving under your skin, lots of times
entering seriously EVERY opening into my body. . .eyes, mouth, nose, ears,
everything below the belt. . .
It is real. . .

I'm not sure if this is actually wear it started , but I was working under
my car for a long period and there was a night when I went inside and found
all sorts of fat bright red tracks all over my shoulders. . .then the weird
tingle in the center of my back, then a course of things from scabies to
tapeworms, to weird granules, to hairs that weren't mine, to lesions. . .it
all eventually ended up with this one organism taking everything over and
after that all I see is the bumps, the granules, and the hair. . .
I think things were tracked into my driveway from the animals coming thru. I
was seeing racoons and such who would come thru all the time. There was a
housing development that started about 2 years ago that displaced all sorts
of things from their homes, and thats right next to this big water treatment
place on the bay. . .

Its hard to tell if I had minor symptoms before or not. ..but NOTHING
compared to the shit that happened to me in the past year. . .I'm telling
you, you couldn't imagine most of the shit, it all sounds crazy, and still
does to me, but it's true.
My symtoms have gotten better with the taking of ionic copper and silver
supplements. It's pretty much the only thing any of us have tried that
works. I've been taking them for maybe 3 mos, and my skin has definately
improved. The news guys shot some of my marks, but I gave em a cd with pics
I took from other times when it was just fukked up. . .

I'm not sure what to say about infecting other people in contact with you. .
.I have a close friend who used to live with me and moved away over a year
ago, she came to visit and shortly after going back home she's experiencing
lesions n such. . .so she might have gotten an early form of it when she
lived with me, but her symptoms escalated after going thru her old boxes
over here when she had to ship the stuff back. . . so who knows, I have a
relative who lives with me who doesn't have it, my dad doesn't, my sis
doesn't. . .my cat does, and the friends who I've hung out with since then
don't. . .

??
An important thing to consider is that we're not dirty people. . .have, or
had normal lives till this. I know theres another person in this area who's
whole family has it. Shit, at the worst points, I was spending like 4+hours
in the shower and bath. . . a couple a day. . . it was one of the only
places that were somewhat comfortable if I was having a really bad day, like
referring to skin issues. Most of my day would be spent showering, shaving,
washing everything around me, all sorts of stuff. It's a good thing I've
pretty much been shaving my whole body since I was like 16ish.


but so, well now ya know. . .
I'm totally open to questions or comments. . .I'm seeing more and more
people come out lately and it's obvious that this issue is growing. . .I
want to help other people with this who may think they have it or know or
whatever, a lot of people with this become suicidal or commit suicide due to
the difficulty finding help in any sort. Thats the main reason I agreed to
be on a news bit about it. I don't care what people think about me, but I
don't want people to have to go thru what I know I've been thru. . .

I can expain more later, but this is very long already. . .

take care all

Subject: [sfraves]NRR: Pro Audio?  Going Mobile?

Hi all, I am thankful to many of you for turning me on to the likes of 
Technics and Final Scratch, I now have a question about my pro audio setup.

I need to go mobile for college, so I was thinking about replacing my 
desktop with a laptop.  I am pretty hell bent on sticking with PC.  Is it 
possible to get a laptop that is just as useable?  I have been checking out 
the inspirons at Dell Outlet.  I am assuming I would have to buy an external 
soundcard that plugs in via usb?  I want something with rca or quarter inch 
inputs/outputs and of course midi.  I am also assuming I would need an 
external hard drive of some kind.  I want to buy self-powered monitors as 
far as speakers go.  I want to spend somewhere between 1000-2000 for the 
damn thing.

As far as software I want to run Sonar 3, Reason 2.5 and soundforge 7 aside 
from microsoft office and other random programs.  (got suggestions on music 
software?)

I appreciate all responses, if you think I should go desktop, please tell 
me!

Thank you.

fable....

Just remember that latency on PC's can be an issue... really look into
what's been used for what you want to do so you can make sure you get a
setup that's not going to be plagued by latency issues. Of course this is
why you see people using Macs for audio...

depending on who you talk to, the latency is or is not noticeable.
 
PC vs Mac discussions are in the link above.  hope it helps.

hello, this is a continuation of a fictional piece:
 
oscar's wife new that oscar was filled with problems, but, heck, weren't they all, and wasn't this better than being totally alone forever. i mean, there is a lot to be said for what a glass of wine or two can do for a girl, and well, she's not getting any younger, so basically, she just sticks it out through the thick and thin and screw what anyone thinks about oscar. sometimes, they still even go to parties together, and they have friends, and only one time did oscar really make any mistakes, and that was fun for her to anyway, because it was kind of like target practice, and she needed to lash out at someone while still picking up oscar's paycheck. what a steathly lady! :)

What does "probable" mean? 50% chance? Anybody that thinks they can
predict weather three years in advance is going beyond what the science is
capable of today. Also, there is more than one aqueduct supplying southern
California - there's the one from northen Cal and one from the Colorado
river, at the least. Whatever the report itself actually said, the
Observer article this is a rehash of doesn't come across as very credible
to me.

As a wise old buddha said:
"Before enlightenment, freak the funk and drink plenty of water.
After enlightenment, freak the funk and drink plenty of water."

"Opinions are my own only, and do not necessarily represent those of
KZSU Radio or Stanford University." (or words to that effect.)

Hey sfraves,

Just sending a "hello" to everyone out there.  I'm not really new, but it's
been a few years since I subscribed to the list.   Well, I'm back and I may
have met some of you at the house party Saturday night on Yerba Buena.

So yeah...... Hope to get to know everyone a little better!

Question for ya'll:

As much as I enjoy SFR, I'm looking for additional options for bulletin =
boards / mailing lists in the area.  Just wondering what all is out =
there.  I know of:

SFR
Oasis
BayRaves
Friends + Family
ASR

And not much else...SFR and BayRaves are the only "open to whoever the =
hell wants to sign up" discussions I know of.  What else is there and =
where do I find it?

Bonus points for specifically underground house related stuff (I know of =
nothing local but for worldwide discussion, undergroundhouse.net is off =
the hook!), but I'm curious about whatever all the way to the super =
massive cheese clubs and beyond.

Aryck,

	Wow, that is a crazy and frightening story... it does sound 
unbelievable that you could get something like that from lying on the 
ground where wild animals have been. But it's admirable that you've had 
the courage to speak out about this. The more information that can be 
publicized, the better the chances people will have of fighting it or 
avoiding it. I have to ask, have you taken any drugs intravenously? Any 
other unusual drug use? If you don't want to go into this publicly, you 
might at least discuss it with your doctors if it applies. I remember 
reading about flesh-eating bacteria that was (is?) afflicting heroin 
users. You said there are bumps *moving around* under your skin? You 
mean like they appear in different places from one day to the next, or 
you actually *see them moving?* What do you mean "entering every 
opening?" I'm sorry, I just don't quite understand that. And scabies 
*and* tapeworms? You're sure that's what they were, or are you 
guessing? I haven't heard of them ever being related. That's just nuts. 
You mentioned being near a water treatment plant -- do you believe this 
is related to the plant? It's hard to know what to make of any of this, 
but I totally feel for you having to live through it.

Best wishes,

Subject: Re: [sfraves] (nrr) Re: the climate change scare & the AIDS scare -- less reason to worry than they told us



Well, the thing about climate change, is that we won't know for sure 100%
until it is too late and irreversable.

And I know for a fact that if/when SOMA is under 10 feet of water, there
will still be people saying "The ocean's 20 foot rise is simply a nature
cycle of the planet..."

Any cost we incur now to help prevent possible global climate change will
be a mere fraction of what the costs will be if the dire predictions are
correct.

Its a hedge I think we should take.

Or, we can take the "its all going to hell in a handbasket anyway, so lets
just enjoy it while we can" attitude.

I got a dell inspiron 1100 brand new from a dude on ebay for like $675

it's a 2.3Ghz, 20 Gb hard drive,
has all the normal inputs for a mic n such which you could use an adapter
for to connect tables or whatever. 2usb ports, no paralell port, nic, I'm
happy with it. It comes with xp home and a dvd/cd rw. . .
I checked the seller and he doesn't seem to have any more for sale tho but
you can find em if you want to.

hehe,

it's cool to be cynical, but by no way is it a chupacabra, or something that
has to be "believed in".
It is real, and it does effect people in these areas. Moreso also than any
other area in the country. I believe it's due to the issues and
complications involved with the population density and visitors to the
areas.

lemmee, think . . .

well, hmm. . .I guess it doesn't matter who I tell now .. .

Well KTVU just left my house a lil bit ago, I was being interviewed cuz I'm
one of these people with this mysterious skin disease. (thats kind of a load
off my back)
I've had this over a year now, I've gone thru the worst this disease has to
offer. No one believed me till I found those websites and spoke to people
like me, and still I felt as if I was so worse off cuz I had all of those
symptoms plus some. . .it is an absolutely horrible disease. . .during it my
body was being destroyed, I was sick constantly, getting weird infections
here and there, dealing with the lesions that randomly appeared all over my
body. . .there were times when things got so badd that I was actually
starting to go nuts, I was stuttering a lot, I had a hard time completing
coherant sentences. . .I got out of that, but it shows how much strain
mentally this puts people thru. Since no one believed me, my friends,
family, the doctors I saw. . .theres no real cure, or chemical that's
worked. . .Theres just no where to turn.
I could go into what I've seen but it would take quite a while, I will if
you want. I've seen things on a weekly basis that I never could have
imagined would ever happen. It's really something like out of an old horror
movie. Scary shit like large bumps moving under your skin, lots of times
entering seriously EVERY opening into my body. . .eyes, mouth, nose, ears,
everything below the belt. . .
It is real. . .

I'm not sure if this is actually wear it started , but I was working under
my car for a long period and there was a night when I went inside and found
all sorts of fat bright red tracks all over my shoulders. . .then the weird
tingle in the center of my back, then a course of things from scabies to
tapeworms, to weird granules, to hairs that weren't mine, to lesions. . .it
all eventually ended up with this one organism taking everything over and
after that all I see is the bumps, the granules, and the hair. . .
I think things were tracked into my driveway from the animals coming thru. I
was seeing racoons and such who would come thru all the time. There was a
housing development that started about 2 years ago that displaced all sorts
of things from their homes, and thats right next to this big water treatment
place on the bay. . .

Its hard to tell if I had minor symptoms before or not. ..but NOTHING
compared to the shit that happened to me in the past year. . .I'm telling
you, you couldn't imagine most of the shit, it all sounds crazy, and still
does to me, but it's true.
My symtoms have gotten better with the taking of ionic copper and silver
supplements. It's pretty much the only thing any of us have tried that
works. I've been taking them for maybe 3 mos, and my skin has definately
improved. The news guys shot some of my marks, but I gave em a cd with pics
I took from other times when it was just fukked up. . .

I'm not sure what to say about infecting other people in contact with you. .
.I have a close friend who used to live with me and moved away over a year
ago, she came to visit and shortly after going back home she's experiencing
lesions n such. . .so she might have gotten an early form of it when she
lived with me, but her symptoms escalated after going thru her old boxes
over here when she had to ship the stuff back. . . so who knows, I have a
relative who lives with me who doesn't have it, my dad doesn't, my sis
doesn't. . .my cat does, and the friends who I've hung out with since then
don't. . .

??
An important thing to consider is that we're not dirty people. . .have, or
had normal lives till this. I know theres another person in this area who's
whole family has it. Shit, at the worst points, I was spending like 4+hours
in the shower and bath. . . a couple a day. . . it was one of the only
places that were somewhat comfortable if I was having a really bad day, like
referring to skin issues. Most of my day would be spent showering, shaving,
washing everything around me, all sorts of stuff. It's a good thing I've
pretty much been shaving my whole body since I was like 16ish.


but so, well now ya know. . .
I'm totally open to questions or comments. . .I'm seeing more and more
people come out lately and it's obvious that this issue is growing. . .I
want to help other people with this who may think they have it or know or
whatever, a lot of people with this become suicidal or commit suicide due to
the difficulty finding help in any sort. Thats the main reason I agreed to
be on a news bit about it. I don't care what people think about me, but I
don't want people to have to go thru what I know I've been thru. . .

I can expain more later, but this is very long already. . .

take care all
: )

how is it that i can actually picture you squealing like a schoolgirl?

oh yeah, i think i've actually seen you do that before... hahahaha.

but yeah, there have been a few people pushing to get the electroliners to
play here in DC.  unfortunately i don't think most people know who they are.
I didn't before a discussion was brought up on the board, but i'm fairly
clueless when it comes to musical styles outside of dnb and their goings-on.

Subject: [sfraves] nrr: I'm very Hugger Mugger

So yeah... when i went 2 Lit last Saturday.... Hugger Mugger... there were like all these fliers all around the bar... the Hugger Muggger fliers.... & on the bacl there were these definitions...

1 of the definitions said: (n). To be in a state of confussion.

so instead of me saying I'm so confused all the time... i'm jus gonna say I'm very hugger mugger... 

now i dunno if the pronunciation of the word is "Hugger" like "Lugger" or like "Hooger" since it's probably like German or what ever, ya know? Well... unless those were jus made up definitions... then.. hmmm.. i should check dictionary.com...

BUt i used that phrase all saturday night & showed people the flier... so i hope i'm right...



Take Care,
Peace-> O§bY {8O)

Subject: Re: [sfraves]  srr. Mysterious Skin Parasites/Disease Quickly  Spreading in CA  n others

aparrantly they were contacted several times by people and organizations and
were pretty much referred to going to a university medical center, or
specific physicians. Most people are usually evaluated with delisional
parasitosis, or explained with various skin infection names.

I've tried contacting people and places and have talked to others who
contacted other places and organizations. It sucks really. . .most
organizations totally ignore the issue. This ktvu thing was part from people
contacting people. . . it's unreal almost and it really seems like people
are purposely ignoring things. . .this is one of the issues I have firsthand
experience with .. .

besides all of that, most other people think they're nuts and not sick and
therefor don't seek medical help, or even if they do they're prescribed
drugs of some sort (antidepressant usually)that never work, etc etc. . .
everyone I speak to has the same issues with their doctors n such. . .

Subject: Re: [sfraves] GHETTO TEK THURSDAY.... OK... ummm... YUM

what up Osby & SFR?!!

just a bit of clarification here- 

its gonna be booty-spank-tacular 
this thursday but that doesn't mean 
just hours and hours of raw "ghettotech".  

even in my native land of Detroit 
(where they just call it "booty") 
the shit gets mixed with electro, house, 
miami bass, jungle, hip hop and more.

SUBK will be rockin her distinct mix of fine electro. 
check out http://www.subk.net to get the idea.

and the lady DJ spinning ghettotech 
is Sarah The Lush of course! ;)

for myself- 
I'm bringing out a lot of new shit for '04.  
Plenty of fast Detroit style booty but also 
urban flavors from Chicago, NYC, Baltimore, 
"Killadelphia", Miami and the UK.  

I even threw together a little sneak preview mix 
of the some of the rawness I'll be busting out...
just hold onto your pants!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

heya,

I just found out that that report on what I was talking about is about to
air this Sunday at 10:00 (pm I assume). . .  KTVU channel 2 around here. . .

I'm cuious to see how they put things together. . .

they actually put a bit of time into it and I wondered if they'd just do
everything in a day or what. . .
It's supposed to run about 5 minutes.

take care, thanks

aK

	We don't know for sure 100% that Martians aren't planning to invade 
Earth, either. But we do know, about as surely as we know anything 
where the economy is concerned, that implementing the Kyoto regulations 
will be an economic disaster, cost billions of dollars and millions of 
jobs, and have innumerable side effects such as poorer nutrition, less 
access to education and health care, higher mortality rates, and other 
conditions that are more prevalent when people are poorer -- which most 
of us will be if we give in to this fear-mongering.

	What makes you think climate change is irreversible, anyway? Are you 
saying that humans are now making the planet warmer without even 
trying, but there's no way to make it cooler even if we deliberately 
seek that result? As noted in the article I sent, the scare back in the 
60s was in fact "global cooling" -- the alarmists were full of warnings 
that human activity was making the planet colder. When it turned out 
that in fact the planet was getting slightly warmer, they had to 
abandon that scare and switch to crying wolf about "global warming."

	And if such a thing *were* to occur -- which is *extremely* doubtful 
-- those people could be right that it was a natural cycle of the 
planet. Geological evidence shows that the earth's climate *has* 
changed in the past, before humans were ever in the picture. Given that 
this has happened before, many times, why should we assume now that 
it's all humanity's fault when there is no concrete evidence of it?

	For those who actually believe that humans are a "cancer on the 
planet," which is what a lot of this non-science basically boils down 
to -- the Church of Euthanasia wants YOU as a member!

	Fortunately the dire predictions appear to have little scientific 
basis. The global warming scare is the international equivalent of the 
U.S. government urging people to wrap their homes in duct tape after 
the September 11 attacks. Remember that precautionary advice? Did 
anyone on this list go out and buy a bunch of duct tape? If so, are you 
feeling a bit foolish now, thinking about it? Want to be fooled all 
over again, but have it cost you a lot more money this time? Then by 
all means, support the fight against global warming.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] I'm Mad as Hell


i believe it would make someone mad as hell about the fact that he came
out against gay-marriage rights and then doesn't have the balls to defend
the stance anywhere near where it is actually most applicable. one should
really read the headlines of any paper or website. it's only been the
biggest topic of discussion for this week.

i don't see how population ties in to your other statements, it's good
statistics, but otherwise pointless. the 'reason' he's coming to santa
clara is for the defense contracting money tied up in places like United
Defense and others - weren't you paying attention the last time he visited
the same area not so long ago?

i see from your last statement that you really don't understand the whole
premise of a protest.

He didn't come out against gay rights, he came out against gay marriage.
This is an old and tired debate, so see what his full view is, and if it
includes a legal civil union cool, if not then make your case.  Yelling fuck
you accomplishes nothing.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] I'm Mad as Hell


did you actually read the email you responded to? i stated very clearly
that he came out against gay marriage. did the hyphen confuse you?

seriously, it is a tired debate but so is roe v. wade. would you be so
quick to say the same thing were it based on a woman's right to choose?
maybe all those women from NOW had it completely wrong by massing together
in D.C. demanding the right to determine what was right for them. oh yeah,
in effect telling the government "fuck you."

anything short of full government acknowledgement of gay/lesbian unions is
a slap in the face for civil rights and downright discrminitory. do we
need to be re-educated on what discrimintaion is or has the last hundred
years of various social and ethnic seperatism been enough of an
illustration?

sometimes the amount of apatheticism is amazing. even more so when a group
of supposedly world-knowing conciousness expanding ravers can rally and
show support so their clubs and parties don't get shut down early in the
evening can't see the forest for the trees regarding something a HELL of a
lot more important.

wake up.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] I'm Mad as Hell

I understand the frustration of Bush not facing the people upon whose
lives he is affecting and denying the right to be human. But as a
presidential candidate you don't go and try to win voters over when you
have pissed them off. You go to areas where people support you and
ensure the ideas of the pissed off people do not affect them. 

As for protesting and yelling fuck you it is very anti-productive in the
way of protesting. If you have something to say put it in a way that
people will listen to. If I walk up to you and start saying "fuck you"
"you piss me off" then what will you do probably get defensive and ready
to attack but if I attack your character in a personable and educated
way you are practically forced to answer otherwise in front of your
supporters you look like a dumaus. 

Just my .02

did you actually read the email you responded to? i stated very clearly
that he came out against gay marriage. did the hyphen confuse you?

seriously, it is a tired debate but so is roe v. wade. would you be so
quick to say the same thing were it based on a woman's right to choose?
maybe all those women from NOW had it completely wrong by massing
together
in D.C. demanding the right to determine what was right for them. oh
yeah,
in effect telling the government "fuck you."

anything short of full government acknowledgement of gay/lesbian unions
is
a slap in the face for civil rights and downright discrminitory. do we
need to be re-educated on what discrimintaion is or has the last hundred
years of various social and ethnic seperatism been enough of an
illustration?

sometimes the amount of apatheticism is amazing. even more so when a
group
of supposedly world-knowing conciousness expanding ravers can rally and
show support so their clubs and parties don't get shut down early in the
evening can't see the forest for the trees regarding something a HELL of
a
lot more important.

wake up.

HAHAHAHAHAHA - http://www.viberation.com/ryan/stuff/flood.jpg (from the last
big rain we had in January)
That pictures is from MLK@Adeline You can see the abundance of intelligence
that exists in the area...

Anyway I live in emeryville and the part of emeryville you speak of is low
land so no doubt it's flooded. Fun to drive through. On the other side of
san pablo all is good. Now going to walnut creek for work this morning was
highly entertaining with the amount of water running down the freeway at me.
All hail AWD!!

is drawing attention to illuminati propaghanda from whitehouse.org meant to be funny ?  are you
going to begin sourcing the national enquirer or the onion and posing it as news ?

you might want to preface tidbits like these with "not real news" or "satire" rather than passing it
off as newsworthy.

ok ... we all agree it's raining a lot. How about some synthesis ... why is 
it raining so much? Does it have to do with global warming, or is this just a 
natural amount of rain?  When you step in a 6" puddle, does it feel any warmer 
than last year's 6" puddle?    :)   Just stirring things up!

Ok you want a serious response?

I think it's time for CA to secede from the rest of
the union.
Our ideals have advanced at a seemingly quicker pace
than the rest of the country.  We're constantly under
federal attack for our "ludicrous" notions- so fuck
em.
They'd probably be happy to have us gone.

Thank you ...It was much appriciated...i don't need anymore negitivity...Actually I was just tryin to be positive...I do understand that many people out there at times feel like they have to send a negitive response which is there own right...all i ask is that I am not belittled or brought down by it...If I wanted to receive negitivity I could just go outside....Just as everyone else posts there thoughts I believe I should be able to as well WITHOUT receiving negitivity from it....BlkStiletto

This isn't an abnormal amount of rain.  It just happened to rain really 
_quickly_ last night and this morning, and the drainage systems aren't 
up to handling that much flow.
The scary thing about global warming isn't just that it raises sea 
levels. (which isn't due to more rain, but rather melting ice caps) 
Global warming will alter global weather patterns, making some places 
wetter and also some drier.  Regardless of whether or not SF ends up 
under water in 100 years, i think it would suck if, say, much of the 
pacific northwest became a vast sahara style desert.  But then, it might 
be kinda nice if it were wetter in LA.

haha, well go ahead and keep thinkin' that.

so you propose that you should be able to post thoughts here, while also having the right to silence
other's responses, however negative they may be.  an opinion at a debate without challenge... I LIKE
IT !

almost the contrapositive of taxation without representation :P

Well, Dave, anyone who would believe this parody is the real thing is, to 
my mind a fool.  Report me to the Office of Homeland Insecurity.

House Music 101:  http://livingart.com/raving/articles/housemusic101.htm

"Security is mostly a superstition.  It does not exist in nature, nor do 
the children of humans as a whole experience it.  Avoiding danger is no 
safer in the long run than outright exposure.  Life is either a daring 
adventure or nothing."
-Helen Keller

"What difference does it make to the dead, the orphans and the homeless, 
whether the mad destruction is wrought under the name of totalitarianism or 
the holy name of liberty or democracy?"
-Mahatma Gandhi

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Enough is bein SAID...What are we goin to DO?

You have a lot to learn about the social dynamics of sfraves...

You say something that has a cheerleader *ra ra* sound to it - expect to get
jumped on.
You say something dumb or that can be easily turned around into something
cynical or sarcastic - you'll get just that kind of response.
If you ever mention the acronym *plur* on here - you're gong to be laughed
at like you wouldn't believe.

The Bay Area Anarchist Bookfair, now in its ninth

information call (415) 431-8355.

Sherman Austin, a 20 year-old, black, Southern
California anarchist, was the webmaster of the site
www.raisethefist.com. He is the first person to be
charged under 18 U.S.C. 842(p), a 1997
"anti-terrorism" law authored by California Senator
Dianne Feinstein.  What was Austin’s crime?  He had
had offered free hosting and a link on his website to
a site called The Reclaim Guide, offering general
security culture information along with a small
portion dealing with explosives, authored by a young
white person from a wealthy, conservative family. 
This information is publicly available, and Austin
merely linked to it, yet he is being jailed for it.  

On August 4, Sherman Austin was sentened to one year
in federal prison and three years probation.  His
probation includes the following terms: Austin cannot
possess or access a computer of any kind without prior
approval of his probation officer; if he gets that
approval, the equipment is subject to monitoring and
to search and seizure at any time, without notice; he
must surrender his phone, DSL, electric, and satellite
bills to his probation officer; and he cannot
associate with any person or group--environmental,
social justice, political, or economic--that seeks to
change the government in any way.

Although Austin initially planned to fight the charge
and go to trial, he accepted a plea bargain after
being threatened with serving up to 20 years in jail.
Despite both the FBI and the Justice Department
agreeing on a sentence of four months in jail and four
months in community confinement, the judge increased
the sentence to set an example for future
"revolutionaries."

Subject: [sfraves] bsp- John Howard & JZ this saturday 2.28 "mOOv"

mOOv with John Howard this Saturday @ Luna Lounge

Same great monthly with a whole new identity. SF-Vibe invites you back to Luna Lounge February 28th AND every 4th Saturday of the month for mOOv. 

And what better way to establish this new identity than with our old friend and master crowd pleaser, John Howard (OM Records). It's always a treat to have John share his energy and passion with us. Those of you who've experienced him know what we're talkin' about. Joining John in the main room is one of our favorite local heros, JZ (Red Melon), as well as SF-Vibe resident Todd Michael. For you lovers of the quality sounds of yesteryear, the goods will be served up to your liking courtesy Andy T (Space Cowboys), Chad Mitchell (Roam Recordings, SF-Vibe) and Cameron (Good Beats). 

Hit the site before Saturday to sign-up for the VIP list, and as long as you're there you might as well check out previous month's pics to see old friends, see what ya missed or refresh that fading long term memory :-) 

http://www.sf-vibe.com

love,
JOnas

a fool eh ?  sure, if *after* they'd clicked and read the first line.

but up until that point, and even after the page started loading (didn't =
even check the url before clicking) it appeared to be some actual news =
article reporting president Bush stating what you made it appear he said =
in your subject.

after reading the first line, i felt like i was duped by a clever =
marketing spam that ended in a game of viagra-pop-up-window-killer.

oh well, that will teach me to read your "informative" posts...

"i believe it would make someone mad as hell about the fact that he
came out against gay-marriage rights"

---I see the word "rights" above in your quote, do you?  Haven't read the
rest of what
you wrote since it is likely based on the assumption you merely said "gay
marriage"

Yeah, our ideals sure have.  8.xx% state sales tax; and rising
Car taxes (nearly) 300% more than the already outrageous
amount we pay.  Back room deals and swindles.  San Jose,
for example, claiming emminent domain to get some houses
that are "a blight" on the cheap.  The list goes on.
Remove the "P" and replace the "O", keep the "GRESSIVE"
and you've got CA summed up pretty well, imo.

Ah, Dave.  Now that I've cleaned all the sewage out of my garage I can deal 
with you:)  It is revealing, isn't it, that anyone would believe our 
beloved leader would say something stupid like:  "Gays Ruined Valentine's 
Day?"  Funny I just sent out another informative article to a different 
list titled "Bush Lies Uncovered."  That pretty much sums it all up:)

Well, Dave, I spent much of my life in business as a marketing person but, 
lest I be accused of plagiarism, the head came from someone on another 
rave-related list.


>oh well, that will teach me to read your "informative" posts...

But much of this satire was informative, to my mind, especially the piece 
about what a constitutional amendment might look like.

Bush said : "If we are to prevent the meaning of marriage from being 
changed forever, our nation must enact a constitutional amendment to 
protect marriage in America."  If one bases the definition of marriage, as 
the satire suggests, on the Old and New Testaments you might find some 
problems.

What is that "meaning of marriage?"  If one looks at the Old Testament one 
would think the model for marriage is polygamy.  In the New Testament 
marriage itself has mixed reviews.  Paul says:  "Marriage is not a sin, but 
it is better to remain unmarried."  In the Church marriage didn't become a 
sacred sacrament until the 12th century.  Before that in Europe there were 
civil unions.

Marriage in America.  Yes.  California was the first state to allow 
interracial marriages in 1948.  Before that it was illegal, and didn't 
become legal in all of the States until the Supreme Court ruling in 
1967.  In that ruling Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote:  "...the freedom to 
marry or not to marry a person of another race resides in that 
individual."  He refers to "person," not man or woman, throughout that opinion.

Women and marriage in America.  In the 1700s and 1800s married women lost 
many legal rights when they said "I do."  They could not own property, pay 
taxes, or sign contracts.  All monies earned had to be turned over to the 
husband.  The woman, in effect, became a possession of the man.  Only until 
the late 19th century did this begin to change and as recently as 1920 
Arizona, Florida, Louisiana and New Mexico still had those unjust laws on 
the books.

One could go on.  Seems to me this is all about semantics.  When a man and 
woman decide to marry they go to a government office to get a 
license.  Then they make a decision:  be "joined" by the state, or 
"married" by the church of their choice.  The same could apply to gay 
couples.  There are churches that do marry gay couples, or they could be 
joined by a civil union.  Whatever, some constitutional definition of a 
muddy religious term -- "marriage"  -- by the state in inappropriate here 
and clearly against the equal protection intent of federal and many state 
constitutions.

In Germany, France, Canada and Vermont, state-sanctioned unions help gay 
couples clarify the legal status and rights of their partnership in 
everything from bank accounts to hospital visitation to child custody. For 
gays seeking these rights elsewhere, this is primarily a practical 
struggle, and it is wrong for the President to exploit it for political 
purposes.


Love,

Apollo

well my input is that its not right for someone to have that much power as to 
excuse a whole way of life...its the person's life, and there should be no 
law saying that they cant live the way they want. they are not hurting anybody 
by getting married, just simply publically showing their love for one another. 
biblically being gay is not right, but i do not judge them or treat them any 
differently just because they are gay when viewpoints of others are forced upon 
you, that's when there needs to be something done about it

I don't think its right that he has the power to do such a thing, but we put 
him there, and will probably have him removed witch I hope because his ass is 
sorry for doing all this bull shit to people.

In my own words I think of Bush like this. 

"One hell of a person trying to be a super star on TV trying to make a 
perfect world out of everything, willing to go out of his way to stop people from 
being happy he is just pissed off at Dr.Phill for receiving air time on NBC. We 
need to send the FAB5 to Bush... !!!!

i hope one day we do have a gay prez it will just tickle G.Bush's pickle :-)

More power to the gay's for loving one and also I look forward to seeing gays 
become one with each other more often.

maybe all those women from NOW had it completely wrong by massing together

in effect telling the government "fuck you."

anything short of full government acknowledgement of gay/lesbian unions is
a slap in the face for civil rights and downright discrminitory. do we
need to be re-educated on what discrimintaion is or has the last hundred
years of various social and ethnic seperatism been enough of an
illustration?

sometimes the amount of apatheticism is amazing. even more so when a group
of supposedly world-knowing conciousness expanding ravers can rally and
show support so their clubs and parties don't get shut down early in the
evening can't see the forest for the trees regarding something a HELL of a
lot more important.

wake up.

Right on, Warren. Your heart is in the right place. 

We may have had a gay president before. Well, we might have had several, for 
all we know, but James Buchanan is the only President who never married. His 
sister served as First Lady. These uptight days, though, it's hard to imagine 
having a gay president. (Someday there will be a male "Monica" to get a 
president in trouble -- mark my words!)

There are other rights issues I would prefer to tackle before "gay marriage." 
But it's out there now, and it seems like it will lead to at least civil 
unions across the US, if not full-fledged marriage. There seems to be a lot of 
sentiment to leave it up to each state.

Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit


interestingly, he was a Republican - Abraham Lincoln
(the evidence is there - it may be many more decades before it all comes out)

I started a pretty reactive thread, yesterday with my "I'm Mad As Hell" post -

Just to make sure that no one is mistaken about the appropriateness of that 
post
to this list . . . sfraves and the community we have continued to be for 
over a decade
has always been about stalking and experiencing as much freedom as we could 
handle
with hopefully no one getting hurt along the way.   The erosion of our 
civil liberties over
just 3 years and the fear of what even 4 more seasons of Ashcroft should 
engender amongst us . . . .

Many of us remember how easy it was to do an all-night renegade - outside - 
on the beach, even - and have it go off
with no hassles whatsoever - how many of those have any of us attended in 
the past
couple of years ?  especially those attracting several hundred 
people  ?   for super cheap or free ?

I've been around a LONG time (OK - not as long as Apollo, but close ; )

I have had the personal opportunity to protest Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Bush # 
1 and now, Bush # 2
and as for the "thank god he has alzheimer's - too bad it took so long to 
diagnose" Reagan

I have never experienced as abusive an idiot in the White House as The 
Great Divider

To those who question the wisdom of peaceful organized groups gathering 
together to
question the decisions and even the authority of "those in power" to sing 
in unison
anthems like "This Land is Your Land" or, even ironically The National 
Anthem is, in fact,
a way of saying F*** YOU to whatever is being protested at that time.

I have done it many many many times - and it feels really good.
Marching down Market Street early last year - FELT REALLY GOOD -
lots of voices, joined together - have power - and feeling yourself as part 
of that power
is to elevate your sense of self as a human being - we've all felt it after 
many hours on the dancefloor.

And if it makes the news . . . well, yes, mr faceless shouting their fool 
head off protestor/freak - you win !
Because !!!!
Nobody wants to look bad on the evening news - (none even President Gas 
(Psyc Furs reference !) - it affects the polls.

Thanks to those of you with great ideas (you'll be hearing from me)
and thanks to the rest for reading and commenting.

Doubt it.  I have a feeling they'd miss the "GDP" aspect.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Enough is bein SAID...What are we goin to DO?

With regard to the "back room deals" and general corruption, I defy you 
to give an example of a similar-sized economy that has significantly 
less.  Sure, ideally, such corruption would be rooted out and stopped.  
But the cynical part of me believes that, humans being humans, power 
corrupts; and a certian amount of corruption is inevitable.

I do, however, firmly believe that the more distant the government, the 
worse the government; and that local government will always respond 
better to the needs and wants of the people than some far-off overlord.

But as far as the taxation issue goes, you're dead wrong.  You'd do 
well to check out this page:

http://www.bcnys.org/whatsnew/2001/1211balance.htm

Californians pay over 63 BILLION dollars more in federal taxes, per 
year, than the state gets back in federal money!  That's "billion" with 
the big "B"!!!  Sixty-three of them!

Fiscally, California could easily do without the rest of the US.  In 
fact, we'd be far better off without them.  If California were to 
secede from the US... If that money were kept in California, instead of 
being leached off to feed a bunch of the more parasitic of the states, 
California could easily:

1) Make up for the federal money we'd lose (much LESS than we pay to 
DC, remember)
2) Balance our state budget
3) Boost a lot of our social services
4) And STILL have enough left to give Californians a big honkin' 
(overall) tax break!

Sure, some of that money would still be lost to corruption and your 
"back room deals".  But it would be lost in Sacramento instead of 
washington.  And it's much easier to notice corruption when it''s an 
hour's drive up the 80 than when it's three-thousand miles away.  It's 
much easier to find out about it, and with California's more direct 
democracy (via the proposition and recall systems) it's much easier to 
root it out, as Grey Davis found out just a few months ago.  (Imagine 
just how short the bush/ashcroft regime would have been, if the ability 
to recall the chief executive (and various hangers-on) existed, at the 
national level, as it does here.)

When you come right down to it, Scott is 100% correct.  Regardless of 
some of the shady things that go on in California; they pale in 
comparison to the rest of the blighted country.  And we'd be far better 
off without the rest of the US dragging us down, slowing us down, and 
suckling at the teat of our tax dollars; all the while hating us for 
socially progressing farther ahead than them.

The funny thing is that, though they are loathe to admit it, many of 
the "old-school" SFRaves-ers went through their own "plur" and, in some 
cases, "candy" phases.  And if you look hard enough, you can even find 
pictures!

But ryan's right.  And, really, it's true about just about ANY internet 
community with a decent length of history to it.

John,

	I haven't lost *my* appreciation for candy ravers. And people taking 
"PLUR" seriously is something I miss. But that's an interesting point 
about Internet communities becoming jaded over time. What can be done 
about it? We could try to care less about seniority (who's been around 
the longest or who did something first) and simply value people and 
their contributions as they come.

Groove on,

Subject: [sfraves] Re: Secession

	It's not just distance from the people that makes a government worse. 
It's how much power a government has over their lives. Governments with 
more power tend to be more corrupt, because -- as John said -- power 
corrupts.

	I agree that California secession is worth considering. Secession.net 
(http://www.secession.net/) is a good resource on the issue of 
secession in general.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Enough is bein SAID...What are we goin to DO?

Well, I once heard Ryan make a VERY good argument against "plur", in 
that it had become a commercialized slogan and empty, over-used, 
tagline that should be unnecessary if you actually DO try to live by 
it.

And I have to say, I kind of agree.  All the pre-made candy necklaces 
with "plur" spelled out in letter beads you can buy from a vendor at a 
coolworld massive don't mean jack if you don't treat your fellow ravers 
right.

Hell, I still *DO* go out to parties all candied-up, every so often.  
More than a few people have seen me as such.  And I can't recall the 
last time I said or wrote "plur", except in a discussion like this, or 
in a goofy self-deprecating way.  But that dosn't mean that I don't try 
my best to treat fellow ravers that way.

Peace, love, unity, and respect are fine ideals to live by.  "Plur" is 
a fine concept to take seriously; and, IMO, a better philosophy than 
most.  But I don't need to put it on a t-shirt to try* to live up to 
the ideal.

*And yeah, sometimes I've failed to do so.

Subject: [sfraves] RE: Groove on IFC right now

One of the fun things about watching Groove, for me, is an exercise in 
"then and now" contrasts.

When Groove first came out, I had just moved to San Francisco, and I 
barely knew anyone here, in the rave scene or otherwise.  So I watched 
Groove, and, okay, it was a nifty little movie about a party.  I wasn't 
really into raves, at the time, but hey.... it'd be cool if parties 
like that really happened.  I wonder how close to the *real* rave scene 
it is.

Fast-forward four years....

Now, whenever I watch Groove, I catch myself intently watching all the 
party scenes, looking for people I've gotten to know in the meantime; 
and occasionally finding them.  That, and looking for familiar people 
and groups to be mentioned in the credits or special features on the 
disc.  And looking for familiar roads/buildings/etc.


cya,
john

Skate shoes in general for me. My favorite is ES, but there's not much 
difference between them and Etnies or Emerica, as they're the same company. Really 
comfy, with all that padding on the tongue, and they have a removable sole 
insert with good support.  They make the feet look big, which seems to be an 
advantage over small feet for some reason ;)

The teenage character Jeremy in the SF Chron comic strip "Zits" wears 
oversized skate shoes, and the cartoonist says kids always comment that he has cool 
shoes.

If you want your feet to look long, wear K-Swiss along with straight-leg 
jeans. The feet will look long and skinny.

Yes I had to get some of this ....I love black Stilettos ...my favorite so far are some pretty common names nothing to fancy such as Nine West and Ann Marino...Just cause the shoes are hot and these two brands I'm able to stand and dance in all night...Yup yup..Oh and it really doesnt matter it could be Stiletto boots or Stiletto Sandals ...I just love the shoe itself cause it can look sexy even WITHOUT feet....So I guess they wear me..ha ha...BlkStiletto

2 rooms, full sound, lighting, decorations and I recall even visuals were on

Subject: RE: [sfraves] What are your favorite type of shoes?¿?

Adidas Shelltoes (aka Superstars)

I've been rockin' shelltoes since around '86, and even though I have bought 
New Balance (which are also nice), and Skechers (more for pimpin'), I will 
ALWAYS have at LEAST one pair of Shelltoes on hand. They are the absolute 
shiz-nit. Perfect grip for any dancefloor, comfy, relatively reasonably 
priced if you know where to look, and come in a variety of color schemes for 
maximum matching-to-clothing ability.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] RE: Groove on IFC right now

I fucking love GROOVE personally. Coming from the East Coast, where Groove 
is considered to be "complete and toal bullshit" and "not even slightly 
realistic", I was SUPREMELY happy to find upon moving out here, that it's a 
HELLUVA lot closer to reality then I could have ever imagined. The Bay Area 
still has a good sense of community, and a pretty damn good attitude 
overall. There's a MUCH wider range of diversity and a larger sense of 
"giving something back" to the "scene" (as it were).

I consistantly rub it in my DC peeps' faces too - much to their dismay. 
DC/Baltimore USED to be like that - and then everyone started getting wacked 
on meth, and playing "uber-scenster" and now it's pretty lame out there. The 
ONLY thing they have going for them is BUZZ (run by Scott Henry and John 
Tab). Don't get me wrong, it's a bad ass weekly at a HUGE venue, with 
amazing talent and excellent sound. But the VIBE just isn't consistant.

I'm soooooooooooo happy I'm out here, and that I get to rediscover over and 
over again why I got into this shit in the 1st place...

The one that I am talking about is the track that starts right in the morning after the party ends...and when he is going through the toll booth...the best part of the whole movie...I wish I would still have $20 left in my wallet after a night that awesome :)
 
Thanks for the help,

Ecko boots

These are a few favorites from my collection.  i have a serious addiction, 
but at least I admit it.

If you want great deals on shoes check out zappos.com!  They are awesome, 
always have sales and everytime I buy a pair of shoes, they bump up my 
shipping to 2nd day for free!  They automatically send you a UPS sticker for 
return, so you can return em the day they are received if they dont fit.  
Then they will refund your money on the spot, or exchange the shoes(that 
takes a while tho).

dont laugh!

Subject: [sfraves] [BSP] - next tues, 3/2: MATTHEW DEAR @ club six

For anyone who complains that there's no techno in SF, next Tuesday, 3/2 is
a chance to set the record straight. We're bringing Detroit's MATTHEW DEAR
to Club Six for a night of the finest minimal techno and microhouse.

You may know Dear from his recent album "Dog Days" on Ghostly
International/Spectral Sounds, or perhaps for his records for Richie
Hawtin's Minus/Plus8 label (as FALSE) and Berlin's Perlon label (as
JABBERJAW).

Dude's stuff is minimal, slinky, bubbly and ridiculously funky, and it's
been hailed by XLR8R, URB, The Wire, Vice, and many others. If you dig the
Perlon/Playhouse/Kompakt minimal-but-funky sound, you definitely should
swing by.

Support acts are L'usine (Ghostly) and DJs Aktual Jakshun (Proptronix) and
me, Philip Sherburne (Trouble/XLR8R).

Full deets:


http://www.404404.com/konstrukt/

Tuesday, March 2nd
Recombinant and Konstrukt present:
Ghostly International Tour (http://www.ghostly.com)
MATTHEW DEAR (ghostly international, perlon)
L'USINE (ghostly international, isophlux)
PHILIP SHERBURNE (trouble, xlr8r)
AKTUAL JAKSHUN (proptronix, incomplet)
@ Club Six
9pm - 2am
$10


Thanks!
Philip

I used to wear suits a lot and I have these clean Windridge (i think)
bergundy wingtips. I loved these shoes, I went thru a couple sets, they're
pretty sick for that type of shoe, I'l polish em and they just looked clean
and were super comfortable if you had to wear them all day, every day. I
don't remember how much they cost, but it was more than I ever paid for
shoes. . .

now I have the reg addidias (diff colors), like the superstars but without
the rubber toe. . . usually wear skate shoes, like DC's or something like
that.

I always liked the look when someone was wearing a dark suit, with a long
coat, braces/tie, and their shoes were a standout color, like bergundy, or
green or something. . . I dug wearing suits cuz most people just don't know
how to dress, well guys in suits. . .there is such a thing as accessories
for men, and short sleeve dress shirts are just wack. . .It's like, if you
know what i mean, most people tend to look like "salespeople/management" or
"technicians".

buuuuuuuuuut yep. . .

I used to have those patent leather burgundy airwalks a while back. . .

hello this is a continuation of a fictional work...also, sorry that we could not make our column date yesterday...we were trying to figure out why...there were two unexpected things that came up..actually, three now that we think of it...understaffed, illness, and sudden interesting person taking up a slot of time and moving everything backwards and forwards..so, for anyone with any sort of sensitivities, we apologize....
 
the kids want candies, clothes and happiness. they want education too. oscar and his wife need help getting these things. they also want all of the same things for themselves. so far, all they are doing is bothering the wrong people. actually, bothering is  a very light word for describing the reality of the situation, which makes them pretty average on the world hate scale. :)

Yep.  Same here.  Pretty much all I wear these days when I go 
dancing.  They ARE comfortable, and there are many styles, including skate 
shoes, you can customize.

"Security is mostly a superstition.  It does not exist in nature, nor do 
the children of humans as a whole experience it.  Avoiding danger is no 
safer in the long run than outright exposure.  Life is either a daring 
adventure or nothing."
-Helen Keller

"What difference does it make to the dead, the orphans and the homeless, 
whether the mad destruction is wrought under the name of totalitarianism or 
the holy name of liberty or democracy?"
-Mahatma Gandhi

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."

http://www.cnn.com/2004/HEALTH/02/25/ecstasy.study/index.html

a doctor is soon going to start using mdma in medical tests with 
psychiatric patients. has anybody else heard anything else about this? i 
was thinking, and correct me if im wrong, that mdma cannot be tested on 
even medically because it is a schedule one drug. does that mean that it 
has been rescheduled? or am i completely incorrect?

I don't see anything about a change from Schedule I. It appears to be an 
exception, as it's been in the works for a couple of years. Perhaps if this study 
goes well, there will be a chance for it to lose the Schedule I status. That 
status was never appropriate, anyway, because MDMA had been shown to have 
clinical value and was only changed to Schedule I because people were enjoying it 
recreationally. 

The American way of thinking about pharmaceuticals says it's ok to have drugs 
that take away pain, but drugs that induce happiness are strictly verboten -- 
even when they have a unique therapeutic use.

I don't want to post this 6 Zillion times, so I'll get in my last one now...

I really hope some of you peeps come out and join me from 6-7pm tomorrow for
happy hour - I'll be dropping something interesting. I'm kind of torn
between spinning a classic proggy breaks set (think "Northern Exposure East
Coast Edition" style stuff), or something totally off-the-wall.

Either way, I hope to see some of you folks there!!!

did you read the article??

the third paragraph:

"Mithoefer's research required approval from the Drug Enforcement 
Administration because MDMA is a Schedule I drug. It's grouped with drugs 
like heroin, cocaine and LSD, all considered to have no medical use.

Bill Grant, a spokesman for the DEA, said the final approval came Tuesday 
night."

---Yeah, that's federal taxes.  You sound just like the Democrats that got
CA into the state it's in.  You think CA is entitled to ALL the federal
taxes
we pay back?  Think about that for a moment, please.  Anyway, you seem
to think CA is somehow more ahead of the rest of the nation.  I got news
for you; we're not.  Many states who had defecits proportional to ours are
currently OUT OF DEBT and with a balanced state budget.  CA?  Nope,
screwed still.  We're a joke in many respects.

L'usine is responsible for an absolutely mind-blowing four-tracker on
Ghostly International chock full 'o glitchy beats and breakbeat electro
goodness!

You can catch some of his stuff at the tail end of my most recent mix,
along with a lot of other music that blurs the lines between house, IDM
and techno.

<http://alterior.net/audio/shazbot-the_control_structure.mp3>

And keep your ears to the ground for the next Moksha Party... word has
it there may be a bit of the deep techy dubby house thang going on this
time around. And of course, if anyone's looking for DJ's that play all
sorts of crazy shit like that, give me a shout. I play for free.

Cheers,

Subject: Re: [sfraves] [SRR] ecstasy study ok'ed

that just goes to show that not everything you read is correct.... for
instance what Sarrilion quoted is that MDMA is a schedule I drug (which is
true) and that it is grouped with other drugs like Heroin, Cocaine, and LSD;
which is false.... Cocaine is a schedule II drug and NOT a schedule I dug...
just check out the US DOJ's website if you dont believe me...

I dunno..  I tend to think Jonny meant "happiness" in its more ideal,
human sense of the word.  Not a lot of prescription drugs have a
life-changing, barrier-breaking effect to them, I think- they mainly
just keep you stable and not unhappy.

Then again, MDMA ain't exactly kind after a day or two. ;)

hello, this is a continuation of a fictional piece:
 
the office was shutdown briefly for additions and subtractions...when the staff returned, jane was no where to be found...apparently, she had been promoted and was now working on a different floor of the building.  there was going to be a big office party coming up, and they were going to hire some people to play music for them. no one wanted to be on the planning commitee, but everyone wanted to attend, because there would be an opened bar, and no one was over 30 years of age in the office, so developmentally, they decided to go by the books about it all without really considering the literature on the subject. :)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Beatmatch - breaks and house - $5 Mezzanine TONIGHT!

If I'm done with a photo shoot for a local punk band then I'll consider it.
I've never been impressed with the sound installation at Mezzanine. It's
gorgeous gear run by monkeys and sounds like hell. That really irritates me.

However... for $5 I'll forgive that because um, yeah, it's only $5 so I
don't expect much for the price! Now when they charge $20+ for sub par sound
and environment I run to the car to get my gun...

Subject: Re: [sfraves] [SRR] ecstasy study ok'ed

	With the exception of alcohol, the government establishment defines 
using a drug for the purposes of enjoyment or recreation as "abuse." So 
"how happy it makes you" in fact does become the basis for prohibition. 
"Scheduling" is a bureaucratic bullshit word in this context. Trains 
are "scheduled"; drugs are "prohibited" or "banned."

Subject: Re: [sfraves] [SRR] ecstasy study ok'ed

this part of the thread isn't addressing scheduling.  Did you read the 
quoted email?  I was responding to this:

"Not a lot of prescription drugs have a life-changing, barrier-breaking 
effect to them, I think- they mainly just keep you stable and not unhappy."

Most prescription drugs, I'd wager, have little to do with brain chemistry.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] [SRR] ecstasy study ok'ed

	Just to be clear, I wasn't criticizing anyone for using the word  
"scheduling," just objecting to the word itself. I think the government  
uses words like this because it spreads a thick layer of bureaucratese  
over the ugly, naked reality that they are in the business of telling  
other people, ultimately at gunpoint, how to live their lives.

A very large number of chemical substances that have never
surfaced in public (and probably never will) are schedule I.

serve **

I know, it only seems like yesterday that we had our first event; Eridanus.=
 But Preserve is turning ONE YEAR'S OLD in February. Join us as we celebrat=
e one hell of a year!!!

It all started with Eridanus. A celebration of Unity and the coming of a ne=
w. We all peered up into the stars, at one star, at OUR STAR...Unity!!!

Next we celebrate Preserve the Beach. Dancing under the stars under a gorge=
ous setting. Directly on the beach we danced the night away within a green =
lit cove. Preserve the Beach and celebrate that.

Remembrance was soon to follow. We gathered to honor the vibe of days past.=
 To remember what it was like to get to know your fellow ravers. Tons of ga=
mes to play, tons of prizes to win, and tons of fun was had. Celebrate

And none of us can forget RENEGADE!!! Join us as we celebrate the feeling o=
f enjoying life in such a sacred space as Home Base. Quote of the night..."=
The cops are parked outside our door, waiting for us to come out. So the on=
ly option I see that we have is to turn the music back on and party like ro=
ckstars." Celebrate the fact that we are ravers; it's something to be proud=
 of!!!

We've said time after time, "This is not a night to miss." Every event we'v=
e ever designed have been quality. We want everyone to make it out to this =
one. And to help make this possible we are making the opening tickets only =
$5 Then $10 and lastly $15. We will definately be letting our hair down and=

n Frog and Sean Sullivan.  For more information call (415) 431-8355.

Sherman Austin, a 20 year-old, black, Southern California anarchist, was th=
e webmaster of the site www.raisethefist.com. He is the first person to be =
charged under 18 U.S.C. 842(p), a 1997 "anti-terrorism" law authored by Cal=
ifornia Senator Dianne Feinstein.  What was Austin^=D2s crime?  He had had =
offered free hosting and a link on his website to a site he did not author =
called The Reclaim Guide, offering general security culture information alo=
ng with a small portion dealing with explosives.  This information is publi=
cly available, yet Austin has been jailed for merely linking to it.

On August 4, Sherman Austin was sentened to one year in federal prison and =
three years probation.  His probation includes the following terms: Austin =
cannot possess or access a computer of any kind without prior approval of h=
is probation officer; if he gets that approval, the equipment is subject to=
 monitoring and to search and seizure at any time, without notice; he must =
surrender his phone, DSL, electric, and satellite bills to his probation of=
ficer; and he cannot associate with any person or group--environmental, soc=
ial justice, political, or economic--that seeks to change the government in=
 any way.

Although Austin initially planned to fight the charge and go to trial, he a=
ccepted a plea bargain after being threatened with serving up to 20 years i=
n jail. Despite both the FBI and the Justice Department agreeing on a sente=
nce of four months in jail and four months in community confinement, the ju=
dge increased the sentence to set an example for future "revolutionaries."

Subject: Re: [sfraves] [SRR] ecstasy study ok'ed

No.  Scheduling has to do with whether or not the big capitalists who
influence our government can make a profit off the drug.  Look at caffeine,
alcohol and tobacco if you don't believe me -- three of the most widely
"abused" drugs out there and they're still legal.  Not to mention
ritalin/aderall or vicodin/oxycontin...those pharmaceutical companies just
make too much money off those drugs.

Subject: [sfraves] Thursday night adventure.... WOw

OK... so i almost finished all the work in the management class that actually just ended Thursday night... I did take the final 4 that class & got an A+... YAY!  NOw I have 2 focus on finishing my papers 'cause the teacher was mondo kinda enough to give me a week extension to & give me a letter grade...

Sorry... just had 2 vent that... LoL

So being that class ended early... I didn't know what to do... I woulda just went over to Anu & hang out w/ the Happy Hour DJs who are starting 2 like become really good friend now... but then I remembered... :code... so i got dropped off on 11th & as soon as i walked up to the front of the club... YAAAAAAAAAY... there was Shane!!!!  It was So Groovy finally seein' him again & talkin' 2 him!  Well.. the :code wasn't quite like open open yet... 

so I went 2 Butter 4 a bit... WOW... see. 'cause what's funny is that like 2-3 months ago... I heard some well, gossip about Butter & lastnight I found out that alota the rumors I heard were true & well... there's a new owner there now, Matt,  & Carlton, the old owner, moved to a really small island in the South... kinda sad 'cause he never emailed me & told me this was goin' on & gosh... la la la...

Then I went over 2 Studio Z for a bit... I"m friend w/ some of the bouncers there... Wow... I got some scoop about that venue also from Security.. yeah... trippy...

AnywaZe, went back 2 DNA & they were like open so I went inside.  They were like still setting up stuff in the front room & DJ Meliss was geting ready upstairs... LoL.. it was Groovy 'cause like I saw Dusty Brown on stage & walked up to him to say like HI & stuff... then it was weird... he remembered me from the last time we met & Wow... we had like an Awesome conversation & he took a pix of us on his dig cam... oh WOw... LoL... Gosh man... I didn't realize how much I missed 11 street...

Well... I dunno... I was like totally fiending 4 some Hard-Grooves on the speakers, so well... I figured might as well just go 2 Anu... so I talked a lil' bit more 2 Dusty Brown & well.. I wanted to try to time it so I could go back 2 :code 4 his Live PA set when I got my fill of Bad Kitty...

So treked over 2 Anu & LoL... it was fun!!  The music during happy hour is so elclectic that it totally trips U out, ya know?  So yeah... those spun spun everything from gangster rap, to pop, to house, to new wave.  

Then Sarah Lushess went on the decks.. busted out w/ some 80's as usual... Love it... then well... she was spinning like some Eletro Clash (I think), then eventually ended her set playing Ghetto Tek!  Oh Gosh man.. I Loved it!!!

OK... then the Chicago Import DJ who spun next, DJ SubK, ooh my goodness man.. she spun this totally fuckin' Awesome set!!!  I mean... she went in & out of her set w/ Electro, Old School Hip Hop (Hello 2Day, she played fuckin' "Sally" by Gucci Crew), & man... it was jus' fuckin' Sick!  She totally like brought in this Awesome Energy w/ her set.. seriously... Good shit man...

Closing the night out was Ghetto Tek Super Hero Baby Daddy!!!  LoL... Oh man... he opened w/ the ummmmm... ok.. g rated mentin of the song he opened w/... bootie & boobies... LoL... & well.. he kept up this mondo edgey energy like manly throught out the whole set... then like it well.. mellowed out a lil' like almost towards the end... BUt Fuckin' A man...  I was Lovin' this set!!!  Oh My Goodness man... I know a trick now that Baby Daddy does.. he talks old 80's rap songs & plays them during his sets like totally sped up 2 match the GT beats he's thrown down already!!  LoL...I recall 2 songs from that night... Brass Monkey insrt & the other song was like the used in Breakin' 2 I think at the end during the show as the song for the main performance... Doo Dah Dumb doo Dah Dumb.. ya knw what I"m talkin' about... that song?

BUt man... the music @ Bad Kitty was fuckin' Bad Ass!  Oh oh oh... so yeah.. Live 105 was there doin this promotion/ contest thingie there & 1 of the DJs from the station kept doing all that fancy talk in the middle of sets (grrrrrr.. hated that) oh yeah.. Erik Gilling won tickets to Squa Valley I think?  YAY... so yeah// there were hella people there like I guess 'til the hmmmmm... middle of the night I guess...

I met up w/ My Homie Maximil @ Anu & well... during the last 20 minutes of Baby Daddy's fuckin' Groovy set... we decided to go 2 :code & see what was left of the night... yeah... I was kinda dreading walking back there again... but it's all in the name of danincg & good beats!

LoL... we got there & like well.. Forest was utside drunk so we chatted e/ her 4 a while...  LoL... but yeah... :code was over by 2AM & that's what time we got there...  so like 1 of the bouncers let me in & I walkined around 4 a bit.. talk a lil' more 2 Dusty Brown & he said he wasn't happy w/ his performance that night... so he's glad I was Groovin' 2 Ghetto Tech instead... LoL

Yaaaaaay... I saw Audio Angel there... Oh Man.. Love her!  We talked 4 a while & when i realized Maximill was outside still... I went back out... & we went home...

I dunno man... it was suck a totally fun night!!!  So Dope!

Take Care,
Peace-> O§bY {8O)

hello, this is a continuation of a fictional piece:
 
nancy sat quietly opening and closing each drawer on her new desk at her new job.  her boss had told her that she'd be able to meet the staff under some fun circumstances at an upcoming party they were putting together.  just the same, she still felt ill at ease.  there were several old pens on the desk in a coffee mug that read, "my mom went to south dakota and all i got was this stupid mug"... she lifted one and attempted to drag it across a piece of old computer paper.  the ink inside had dried a shade of olive green, and the paper snagged and tore beneath the jagged pull of the tiny ball at the tip of the pen.  she'd never go back again, she thought to herself. no matter what, she'd never return. :)

Subject: [sfraves] Rec and Park meeting Wednesday, March 3, 2pm, City Hall Room 416

	A committee of the Recreation and Parks Commission will be discussing 
some items of interest to the electronic dance community this coming 
week!

WHEN:  Wednesday, March 3, starting at 2pm

WHERE: City Hall Room 416

WHAT:	
1. "Discussion and possible action to approve 'Another Planet 
Entertainment's' request to produce a gated, free, ticketed musical 
event at the Polo Field in Golden Gate Park on Saturday, September 11, 
2004 and a request to modify the amplified sound policy and permit 
amplified sound between the hours of 12 noon to 6:00 p.m. and a request 
to sell beer and wine."

2. "Discussion and possible action to amend the Recreation and Park 
Department's amplified sound permit policy for Sharon Meadow in Golden 
Gate Park."

	Please forward this email to anyone you know who wants more freedom 
for entertainment in San Francisco, and encourage people to come out 
and speak or show their support for (1) granting the Polo Field permit 
as requested for at *least* those hours if not longer, and (2) writing 
as liberal a policy as possible to govern amplified sound permits in 
Sharon Meadow.

Peace, love & liberty,
						<<< Starchild >>>


EXTRA ACTION ITEM:  Call Mayor Gavin Newsom's office at (415) 554-5942 
and ask that he appoint Libertarians or others who believe in 
minimizing restrictions on entertainment and nightlife to the 
Recreation and Park Commission and other city boards and agencies 
affecting music, dance, and after-hours events.

(i mean that ripping and tearing of the flesh is superb) very powerful i mean i 
think i shed a tear or two (no really i did) and can you believe it he dies 
at the end! I mean for christ sake how are you gonna have this big blockbuster 
movie and have the main character die in the end (opps sorry for the 
spoiler... at least you won't be as shocked as i was... jesus fucking christ!)

Wait -- so he doesn't come back to life? That seems strange to me -- 
but maybe Mel's simply coughing up to the fact that dead people don't 
come back to life -- it just doesn't work that way -- then again -- if 
jesus isn't resurrected -- then that kinda kills that whole 
christianity thing right there -- hmm...

oh and by the way say jesus did die in the movie and didn't come back to life 
right. that doesn't "kill" the whole christianity thing... I mean the point 
is that he loved his enimies and saw death as being more powerful than killing 
people to buy freedom. And low & behold (resurection or not) he becomes a 
legend. proving that dieing can be more powerful than killing. that's what 
christianity means to me anyways. but that's not usually how a fundementalist 
describes it tho...

RE:  KTVU Broadcast - "Mystery Disease"

Due to the Academy Awards broadcast on another network on Sunday =
evening, March 1, 2004, KTVU Channel 2 has moved the broadcast of the =
"Mystery Disease" news feature to MONDAY, March 1, 2004 at 10:00PM.

KTVU made the schedule change as they want to reach the widest audience =
possible in the greater San Francisco Bay Area.=20

Additionally, arrangements are being made for a web-site broadcast of =
the news feature.  We will notify you of the specific details once they =
are confirmed.

More information to come to you in the next few days.

Thank you.

hello, we are having intermission from our regularly scheduled fictional piece to remind you to never forget that there is A-L-W-A-Y-S the possibility of a chanson du jour!!!!!! okay, here is the chanson we think you ought to contemplate:
 
of course, it is a Led Zepplin song:
 
"i'm in the mood for a melody, i'm in the mood for a melody, i'm in the mo-oood....(pretty guitar sounds...1-2...(hold)..3), i'm in the mood for a melody, i'm in the mood for melody, i'm in the mo-ooood..." :)
