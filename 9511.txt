No, that would be me!  The confusion goes both ways... I've had to ask to 
make sure people weren't confusing me with you. :)  I was wearing an 
Arabian Nights costume at Friends & Family.  Funny, our signatures are 
kinda similar too... like minds think alike?

Heya all,


	Since we've been on the topic of music a fair amount lately, I 
thought I'd ask this rather broad/tangential question:  
	What kind of music do we SFRavers listen to when we're 
not raving?  I imagine that our tastes must be pretty varied considering 
how eclectic and creative this group is... so humor me, please!  Name a 
favorite artist, album, label, etc. (preferably outside the electronic music 
genre, but not necessarily!)
	Heh, I'll go first: 
	
	-Tom Waits always and forever tops my list of genius musicians/
	songwriters--no one else's music moves me as much as his.
	-The Chieftains are the most damnably fine Irish folk group in 
	the world
	-Fugazi are the most genuine punk band in the universe (any other 
	SFRaver's going to see them play at the Troc this weekend?)		
	-Others include Philip Glass, David Byrne, Lou Reed, Peter 
	Gabriel... blah blah. 


	Just curious,



		His Majesty jon, The Burger King

Hi ravers,

Okay 90210-watchers, we all remember when Brandon Walsh went to a
rave and took "euphoria" (laugh) with some girl, right?  Well,
according to the adverts, on tonight's episode "the whole gang
takes a love potion that [this part is said in one of those dramatic tv 
-announcer voices] will turns friends into lovers" hee hee!  Awright! 
So if anyone wants to watch Hollywood's interpretation of what
happens when kids take mind-altering empathogenic substances,
it's on tonight.   

see you 
Timothy

Haven't posted for a while about what I've been up to, so here's the
October Travelogue . . .
 
I finished up my Seattle project in the early part of the month.  It was
quite an experience being there amid the Mariners hysteria.  Got my old
baseball blood stirring!  However, I didn't see any of the games, as
I detest the Kingdome.  Besides, I didn't have time, in fact, I didn't
even have time to go out at night, or visit the new Platinum Records
outlet on Pike right off of Broadway.  This is the new store started by
my friends at Platinum here in Portland -- Ali, Scott, Jeff, Brad.
Seattle finally has a real DJ store, selling both equipment and recordings
(vinyl and CD).  I can't say much about the Seattle scene because I haven't
been to any events there at all.  But like Portland, it seems to be a
dreary choice between bad, cheezy clubs and bad, icky warehouse parties
with occasionally good DJs.  Which explains why I was fortunate enough
to spend more time elsewhere this month.
 
On the 7th, I was kindly invited to spin at Freaky Friday at the "friendly
confines" of Komotion.  It was a little weird following the fast-trance
DJ and then being followed by the belly dancer and drummer (yes, that's
right!), but overall it was pretty fun and I got to break out my
"San Francisco vs. Detroit Sound Clash" set with the SF toonz on the
left turntable and the Motor City ones on the right side for a unique
kind of one-and-one set.  Worked pretty well too.  I was also lucky enough
to see DJ Stonie (that's Jake to all of us!) play live, he played trippy
house with the Cakewalk sequencer and some keyboards.
 
The next night was the house party at the new home of sfraves stalwarts
Cindy, John and Sho, and it definitely rocked!  I got in a little over
my head but with no adverse effects.  I want to thank Ozy for an especially
excellent set down there in the basement.  The beer was fine and the cookies
were a little tooo fine!  There was a great good feeling at this party and
I hope there'll be more.  Sort of like a scaled-down version of the Blue
Cube gatherings . . .
 
The following weekend, I took the plunge, emptied the piggy bank and went
to Detroit for the Metroplex 10th anniversary party.  This was a big deal
for them not only because of the honors for Juan Atkins and Metroplex, but
because they have full-on parties so rarely in Detroit.  Read this month's
Urb for a brief rundown of how many get busted there.  Except for Jeff
Mills,
who was booked solid in Germany and couldn't take off the weekend, just
about everyone from the Detroit underground was there to play or just be
around.  Things started Friday evening with a small gathering at a gallery
for a special, one-time-only-probably-never-again live performance by Juan,
Mike Banks of Underground Resistance and two of the members of Aux 88,
who've put out excellent tracks recently on Direct Beat.  They did three
early techno tunes ("No UFOs," "Technicolor" and "Clear") which me, being
the relative newbie, didn't really know, but have significant meaning for
the Detroit hometowners.
 
The main event was spread out over two nights at an old disco warehouse
place called the Warehouse just north of downtown.  Two rooms were used,
and the music just kept getting better and better.  It was hella competitive
among all the DJs, but all for a good purpose.  Many people liked Rob Hood
and Orlando's sets, but housey type-a-guy that I am, I fell totally for
the sets by Anthony Shakir and Stacey Pullen, who impressed me thoroughly
by taking a kind of not-into-it Saturday midnight crowd and *making* them
willingly pay attention to what he was playing, just through
excellent track selection and mixing.  The stellar set remained for the
end, as Derrick May provided two hours of absolute sonic mastery.  It was
one of those wonderful moments I just gave up all my critical tendencies
to total enjoyment.
 
This meant I missed my chance to hear Juan play jungle (among other things),
but I did hear his two previous sets, which covered the range from vocal
house to trance techno to minimal beats.  He's not a technician as a DJ,
instead the musicality of his approach stood out and I finally understood
the basis of how Jeno and others play their best stuff.  You couldn't ask
for a more low-key yet self-assured DJ and musician than Juan Atkins, he
simply defines "total class" pure and simple.
 
The crowd for this stellar event was loose and happy.  I saw no "attitude"
at all.  Given the infrequent gatherings in the area, I thought Friday was
a real warm-up night, it seemed like people just didn't get loose until
near the end, but Saturday things steamed right up and the vibe was as
thick as it ever gets.  The people there were sweet and fun and it was
really nice to feel that unspoiled vibe again.  It must be hard to be
in an area where events happen so infrequently, but they sure take
advantage when they can.
 
I'll have more to say about Detroit in an article I'm starting to write.
Needless to say, my experience at the Detroit Regional Music Conference
in 1994 and the Metroplex party this month have sent my musical context
into some kind of techno hyperspace!  I should mention special thanks
to Robert Smith and Mike Banks, who provided hospitality beyond measure
and an outlook that in many ways defines where I think our scene needs
to go.
 
I left my records at home for the Detroit trip, but they certainly went
along for Tribal Future the following weekend.  This was organized by
the Ameba gang, of which I am proud to consider myself at least an
honorary member and "visiting resident."  They hooked up with Pacific
and Wicked and pulled off an amazingly wonderful outdoor event in the
redwoods.  This was one I could not miss, since it was the same location
where we did Penelope's Web in June 1993 (a collaboration between Your
Sisters House and some sfravers, led by Bob Ramstad, who put time,
effort and not a little dough into making that one happen).
 
In addition to the fantastic location in the redwoods on the side of the
hills east of Willits, about three hours north of SF, this is basically the
perfect spot for an outdoor dance party, with a clearing perfectly
sized for music, an amazing garden, a cabin with a full kitchen, solar
power, congenial hosts . . . what a place.  It was bone-chillingly cold
toward morning but totally pleasant during the day (unlike '93, when it
was great at night and blazing during the day).  I can't even remember
everyone who played, but I got my turn on the good old Ameba turntables
and mixer PLUS the Wicked sound system around sunset, and had a fantastic
time.  The real standout set was by Polliwog, who, just as she did
in 1993, demolished us all with an outside-beyond-belief tripped out
junglistic Mr. Rogers/Nile Rodgers Cosmic DJ Whirligig set.  She's my
favorite DJ in the world and #2 isn't even close.  I want to thank
Diane Tabellija for the driving and the excellent company; it was a
treat to meet yet another old-time sfraver I somehow had never met.
If by some miracle or luck we can do another event at Walter's Raver
Camp in Willits :) by all means cancel all your other plans and show!
 
Which brings us at last to this past weekend culminating in a stellar
Friends & Family.  I wasn't much involved in this one, preferring instead
to take it easy and just enjoy it.  In part this was because I had a
little secret.  As you know, Bill Gates is my Evil Twin, we were born
as twin brothers in different families on the same day, October 28,
1955, which meant that Saturday was our 40th birthday.  He didn't invite
me to his party, so I didn't invite him to mine.  Instead, Friends &
Family from all over provided me the best possible birthday party of all
by not having it have anything to do with *that* and instead be totally
about what we've been developing so steadily this past couple of years --
a mean-motor-scooter of a party organization and crew that has actually
planned and carried out some of the most rad events on the planet, small
as they may be.  I mean, where else can you hear "Dear Prudence" and
gabber being played on the same turntables within half an hour of each
other?  The usual stellar playing pertained everywhere, of course, but
a couple of sets really stood out for me -- those by Felix and Minor,
neither of whom I'd heard play before.
 
I have to give special mention to 3A hisownbadself -- Ameba Astralmatrix
AndyJ -- who gave us a thundering world premiere of his live set.  The
fullness and power of the live sound he got out of those little old-
fashioned boxes was just amazing, even to these jaded ears, and the
mesh with the fantastic Burning Man mud-people video only brought it
to that much higher a level.  I don't think I've had the feeling of
that uplifting surge that happened during that set for a long long time,
maybe back to some of my earliest Dead shows.  I know Andrew was pleased
with how it turned out, but the genuinely ecstatic response from many
of us who were in that ole garage when it happened was the kicker.
There are plenty of things to improve on with the F&F parties (uh oh,
that means we might have to do more?!), but it's still the best place
to be and this one proved it again.  The sound, the ambient areas, the
amazing lights and video show, all of it.
 
I was hoping to make the last Sunset of the year but couldn't snag a ride,
so instead I hung out on Haight St. all day and ended up meeting several
friends, grabbing a couple of records, and having a generally fully
pleasant time of it.
 
Home is where the heart is.  I live in Portland, love it, won't leave it,
but San Francisco is my musical home.  There's so much more I could say
but that says it all.
 
Thanks everyone . . .
 
peace
 
phred

	Most of my favorite music would be generally categorized as eighties 
pop; I love Blondie, The Smiths, Book Of Love, Cindy Lauper, New Order, 
etc, etc, ad nauseum.  A lot of this I consider to be dance music, although 
many ravers might not.
	When I go skiing, I like to listen to Enya, The Orb, and other ambient 
stuff, or classical music such as Tchaikovsky.
	I also love movie soundtrack music; some of my favorites are The 
Living Daylights (Pretenders, Aha, etc.), Star Wars (John Williams), 
Jesus Christ Superstar (Andrew Lloyd Webber/Tim Rice), Born On The Fourth Of 
July (John Williams, Edie Brickell, etc.)
	I have a definite soft spot for many artists generally considered to 
be easy listening or "adult contemporary" (I love that term, it makes it 
sound X-rated):  Billy Joel, Elton John, Chicago, etc.
	A few other groups that I like a lot that don't really fit into 
the above -- The Beatles, ABBA, Pink Floyd.
	Finally, I love zany novelty records by artists like Weird Al 
Yankovic and the stuff heard on the Dr. Demento show.  So go figure.

Cheers,

here are some of my favorites:
Bob Marley, whose music makes always makes me smile slowly,
The Clash, who were the smartest punk band, esp. 'London Calling', which is 
  probably the best album I've ever heard,
The Velvet Underground--there's no one cooler than Lou Reed;
B.B. King (anything of his live); Prince; The Beatles;
James Brown (now THAT'S dance music); early Rolling Stones; and
of course the best band of all, U2, for having the most passion.

just my two cents,
Timothy

hm strange, you mean you people listen to other things besides techno? 
whoah. i must be the strange one then.

anyway, while not at a rave, it would have to be:

Kraftwerk, NegativLand, Pet Shop Boys, any house/ambient/trance/acid that 
i have in my room. that would be about it. 

pretty bland eh?


favorite would have to be a toss up between Kraftwerk and NegativLand.

Here is a brief list of my favorites (okay maybe it isn't so brief, I 
kinda got carried away!):

for the non techno catergory:
Negativland -Escape from Noise is a classic
Sonic Youth- Sister and Bad Moon Rising are favorites.
Big Black- Songs about Fucking and Atomizer punk rock with a beat box

        Well as far as non-electronic music, there's not much that i listen
to (yikes!) but i would have to say that i do listen to Spacemen 3, the
Stooges, the velvet underground, the jesus and mary chain (old stuff), my
bloody valentine (*swwoooon*), spiritualized, spectrum, sonic boom, and the
cranes a lot when i don't chill out to ambient or bop around my apt. to
hardcore :)

Call me narrow, but I mostly only listen to my mix tapes! :) Once in a 
while I'll listen to Mickey Hart or Jane's Addiction or Red Hot Chili 
Peppers.  Sometimes Madonna.   Sometimes I'll even break out my cherished 
old stuff and get into an 80's high school mood and listen to 2 of my all 
time most wonderful favorite bands in the whole wide world: Duran Duran 
and A Flock of Seagulls! :) *Always* an avid fan and what can I say, I 
love dance music! :):)

Amy

As far as non electronic music goes, I listen to:

Ani DiFranco (I'm sure I just destroyed the spelling of her name, but oh
well, she rocks)

Indigo Girls rock as well

The Mission soundtrack

Last Temptation of Christ soundtrack

I play drums and didgeridoo quite often.

I play my Tibetan bowl often as well.

There's more, but I gotta get to work.

I guess I should preface this by saying I have fairly wide-ranging musical
tastes.  Whatever my mood is dictates what I feel like listening to I
guess.  Okay, I'd intended this to be short but I kept thinking of more and
more faves I had to list 8P

Pink Floyd - had to head this list.  I have like 14 of their albums, 1 ROIO, and
                a super-funky "The Royal Philharmonic presents Pink Floyd"
                album!!
so-called "Classic Rock" artists I also dig - Jimi Hendrix, Santana, the
                Beatles, Led Zep, the Velvet Underground, Janis Joplin, and the
                Stones.  And I'll even admit to owning (and liking!) the
                "Frampton Comes Alive!" album 8P
Alternative stuff - Beck, Blur, Spaceman 3 (esp Playing With Fire), Nirvana, the
                Charlatans UK, Medicine, Spiritualized (anyone else seeing them
                tonight @ Slim's?), and the Lords of Acid.  Oh, and U2.  I know,
                I know, they're not really "alternative" (whatever _that_ is)
                but "Zooropa" is pretty unique
Artists I can't really categorize - Laurie Anderson, the Art of Noise, MC 900ft
                Jesus, Paul Simon (Graceland)
Soundtracks I like to chill to - 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Big Chill (*great*
                motown tunes!), Little Buddha, and the Blues Bros.
Misc Artists - Ray Charles, REM, John Denver, Miles Davis (Bitches' Brew),
                Public Enemy, Willie Nelson, Johnny Cash, Tchaikovsky (1812
                Overture, Romeo and Juliet), Richard Wagner (The Ring Operas),
                Bob Marley, Mongo Santmaria, Vicente Fernandez, the Beastie
                Boys, and... <gasp!> Milli Vanilli.  I'm sorry!  If I admit that
                do I have to give my SFR laminate back?  Cuz I won't ;)

Greg's all time favorite band--JUDAS PRIEST 
 
something about the"ronan-esque" musings of tracks like "victim of changes"
and "beyond the realms of death", i suppose...basically a metal-head, since
i was totally embarassed to dance in high school. didn't go much for punk,
though i used to have a morbid habit of going to ruthie's(gilman st) and
barrington hall (anyone remember steve richter?[R.I.P]) to watch my friends
shoot gram-slams of speed in the bathroom and then go out and beat the
livin' shit out of eachother to the melancholy rants of bands such as
flipper and black flag... 
 
thank [insert chosen deity here] for the house movement... 
peace&positivity, 
greg

	SAN FRANCISCO (BCN)   	
	Attorneys for seven people arrested by San Francisco police at a 
raid of an AIDS fundraiser on New Year's Eve filed a federal civil 
lawsuit against the city and four police officers.  
	Attorney Nancy Clarence said the suit was filed because of the San 
Francisco Police Commission's failure to take action on an Office of 
Citizen Complaints report that sustained 28 charges of misconduct 
against 21 officers last August.  
	``We will not allow our rights to be stifled by a do-nothing Police 
Commission and our freedoms held hostage by mayoral electoral 
politics,'' she said at a news conference outside the Hall of Justice.  
	The lawsuit claims the four defendants led more than 70 other law 
enforcement officials in a raid of a benefit for gay artists with HIV 
or AIDS at 938 Harrison St. on Jan. 1.  Eleven people were arrested on 
charges of resisting arrest, drug posession and operating an illegal 
nightclub.  All charges were later dropped.  
	Police said the raid was conducted because the building is not 
permitted to house large gatherings, though organizers said police 
told them they did not need a permit for the event.  
	The suit names the City and County of San Francisco, Police Chief 
Anthony Ribera, Sgts. John Haggett, Stephen Bosshard and Edward Santos 
and officer Hoyt Wong as defendants.  
	Plaintiffs Larry Ackerman, 44; David  Bowman, 32; Donald 
Branchflower, 28; Joseph Cain, 39; Eric Shannonhouse, 18;  Graham 
Cruickshank, 27; and Eden Somberg, 22  ``suffered the most serious 
abuse'' of those arrested, Clarence said.  
	According to the suit, officers and agents from the State Alcohol 
Beverage Control Board arrested plaintiffs without a warrant or 
probable cause and subjected arrestees to physical brutality and 
homophobic slurs.  Clarence said the four defendants had the most 
serious complaints of brutality against them as well as ``long and 
disturbing'' records of past abuse.  
	Police Chief Anthony Ribera said in September that six of the 22 
officers named in the OCC report, including a captain and a 
lieutenant, would be assigned hearings before the Police Commission, 
which oversees the most severe misconduct cases.  
	OCC attorney Bruce Kapsack could not verify any connection between 
the officers awaiting commission hearings and those named in the 
lawsuit but admitted the process was taking an unusually long time.  
	``There is generally a pattern and this case is taking longer than 
usual,'' he said.  
	Clarence said the lawsuit will be pushed forward even if the 
commission disciplines the officers soon.

I listen to a lot of jazz, mostly of the big band and swing era, but
also some Frank Sinatra and Harry Connick Jr.  I am not too heavily
into blues, but I sure do love going to little downtown bars with 
live bands in Detroit...I also have my roots deep in New Wave of the
early 80's and the industrial days of the later 80's.

When I'm feeling saucy, I'll put on some organ fugues or bagpipes...

hey all-
since we're talking about music, here's my $.02

since i was conceived, i've been listening to Peter Gabriel.  He was still
with Genesis, and i can remember my brothers blasting "The Lamb Lies Down on
Broadway" while i was still in the womb. anyway---
i'm a liturgical musician, so i listen to alot of progressive christian crap
( there is some good stuff out there, if you get past all the bible thumpers )
james taylor, toad the wet sprocket, and james all top my list.
and very high is john denver!  he's cool!

anyway, have fun!

peace, love, and music-

I couldn't help but share my music tastes.  It's great to hear everyone's 
varied tastes, an expression of their personality.

I think I have fairly wide ranging tastes thay have certainly expanded in 
the last years.  The one constant is that I love music that's driving, 
that gives me emotion.  This started with 80's glam rock and heavy metal; 
my all-time favorite through high school was AC/DC (kill me, I was a 
product of peer pressure in a hicktown!!!! :)  Now I don't have to suffer 
through misogynistic lyrics and am blessed with a plethora of riot grrl 
bands like L7, Babes in Toyland, Seven Year Bitch, Hole, Bikini Kill, 
etc.  I love female artists, I suppose partly as a reaction to the male 
rock world, but also I find something different and unique about this 
kind of music. 

My other big passion right now is FUNK and SOUL.  James Brown rocks my 
world like no other artist (the best concert I've ever seen).  Maceo Parker, 
Fred Wesley, Bootsie Collins, George Clinton, Parliment, Aretha 
Franklin, Lyn Collins etc. etc.
(I reccomend the two CD's called JB's Funky People which have artists that 
recorded on his label and are awesome)  I also saw Maceo and Fred in concert
about a month ago.  Man, they played for 3 hours straight without a break 
and we never stopped moving our feets.


My other love is Latin folk music and rock including Inti Illimani (some 
of the most talented artists ever), Mercedes Sosa (seeing her in concert 
tonight), Los Fabulosos Cadillacs (Argentinian ska!), Sexual Democracia, 
etc. 

To finish up:  I LOOOVE the Talking Heads (surprisingly, one of the first 
punk bands), Liz Phair, the Breeders, R.E.M., Stereo MC's, Black 
Sabbath, English Beat, Dramarama, Cure, etc., etc.  My favorite 
local bands are the Broun Fellini's, Lawsuit, and the Fabulous Hedgehogs.

On the topic of music:

Has anyone ever heard of Ozric Tentacles???  They are partly electronic, 
partly insrtumental upbeat ambient music that hail from England.  My SO 
turned me on to them and they are really great.  I don't know a lot about 
them, but they are good, and have 2-3 albums out.  From what I understand 
they are played at raves in the U.K. (but I wouldn't know fer sher since 
I've never been!! :] )

lets see...
	most recently i have been listening to my new juno reactor at 
various speeds on my turntable...ummmmit is good to study to at slow 
speeds, along with kraftwerk and laibach for writing code, rising high 
ambient stuff is great for me to read to...to get amped for going out I 
listen to plane tdog stuff or old mix tapes lying around...usually from 
the club oz in orlando FL. I used to go to in early high school (does anyone 
remember the helicopter song)...lets see...I also love to study to 
mozarts requiem, bach, 102.1, in the mornings I like public supported 
radio kqed, I also love the beatles, mazzy star, 10000 maniacs, bob 
marley compilation disc one, robert johnson, i dont like the cure or 
depeche mode anymore, but I still occasionally pull out those nitzer ebb 
or front 242 from way back.

Yea, I have a couple of albums that a new friend recorded for me after he
found out I liked electronic music.  They are a little to "rock" for my
taste (at least what I heard), but some of it was cool.

--------------------------

I didn't mean "give" as in give you money, I met give in terms of giving
good, honest and fair representation as mayor.  Noone's looking for a
handout, so don't even go down that silly road, that's not what I'm
talking about.  BTW, Ben Hom WILL give you something; if you're not rich
enough to be in the "capital gains club", he'll give you a foot in the
ass.  He'll disrespect the constitution, the rights of city citizens, and
the city charter in favor of giving handouts to his business friends.  If
you're worried about handouts, find out where the handouts exist; in the
privatization business sector, that's where!

Obviously, that's not what I'm talking about... read my above paragraph.

-------------------------

I think you need to address the corruption concerns Niels raised, as any
gains through privatization will be lost through the rampant corruption.
What's your answer to Niels scenario?  Please don't say it isn't a real
scenario, as it's going on around us right now, Jordan is up to his ass
in that kind of shit.  So if you have an answer for Niels concerns, then
and only then, will I take you seriously.  I would really like to hear
your solution for those problems, and if it's sane, then maybe there could
be a "win/win" solution, but not before those concerns are remedied.

---------------------

Most privatization efforts strongly protect the company providing the
service from any competitive pressure and customers rarely have any other
choice WRT where to get the products or services, rendering your point
completely useless.  Unfortunately, since the public has nowhere to go
other than to the privatization company (in whatever market), the company
isn't REALLY sensitive at all to their customers, since the customers
don't have a choice to buy from someone else anyway... again, please
tell me your solution, I'm incredulous that you don't understand this.

----------------

Because of the situation I outline in my previous paragraph, the company
gets the privatization contact is in exactly the same situation as the
government in your above description, and like the government, couldn't
care less about providing decent value, since the customer is captive.
Again, I'd like to hear your solution.

------------------------

What is the ratio of rich to poor in these countries?  Who is benefiting
from the "capital improvements"?  Many of these countries have no middle
class, and the richest %1-5 are the only ones to benefit.  America is
headed in this direction, is this what you want?

-----------------

I don't buy it.



> Existing companies would be allowed to compete with the newly private 
> agencies, and power is effectively dispersed and decentralized.
--------------------------

I want to see how you will insure that the consumer/public will benefit
from having choices between competitive providers of good and services.
I bet you can't do it, because with this plan, it can't be done.  Look at
P.G.&E. in San Francisco.  San Francisco could provide its own public power,
stabilizing our debt crisis and providing much lower rates to city users
of power.  However, this "privatized" market is structured so that P.G.&E.
contributes serious bank to city politicians, ensuring that they can
continue to charge inflated power rates to city dwellers.  Our rates here
are among the highest in the nation, and this is through a basically
privatized power market here in San Francisco.  In fact, P.G.&E. hasn't
even stuck to the fat contract they won, they haven't even fulfilled the
commitments they made even when they did get the contact to provide power
for their own profit.  Please explain your solution...




> 	 People in the United States are starting to realize the truth of

----------------

Only for the top %1-5... please answer my above concerns, or this point
simply doesn't hold.

-----------------

You are truly out there starchild, this is completely off the wall.  If
you can explain away my concerns I'll be amazed...

Yup, they have a *excellent* techno side project called Eat Static.  
Planet Dog have released most of their stuff in the states for pretty

Hi everybody,

sorry for the massive crosspost but I think this should be interesting
to at least some people everywhere.  Version 2.0 of DJ ONLINE starts
this Thursday at 6:30 Eastern.  If you weren't around earlier this
year when we did the first series, DJ ONLINE is a regular weekly thing
where DJs and musicians from the scene are invited onto VRAVE for you,
the people, to talk to them :)  If you don't know what vrave is, ask
your friends :) or try it yourself (telnet hyperreal.com 7283) any
time.  Anyway, DJ Online 2.0 starts this Thursday and will happen every
Thursday (except for holidays) at 6:30 pm Eastern until at least mid-
January.  Here's the (very tentative) schedule.  I think it will probably
be on channel two of vrave.

Nov  2 - KEOKI and SOULSLINGER
Nov  9 - DB and JOESKI
Nov 16 - JAMES CHRISTIAN, JASON JINX, MIKE DEARBORN and TERRY MULLAN
Nov 30 - DEEP DISH and SCOTT HENRY
Dec  7 - HEATHER HEART and ADAM X
Dec 14 - NIGEL RICHARDS and DJ ORION
Dec 21 - KIMBALL COLLINS
Coming in January - RITCHIE HAWTIN, JOHN ACQUAVIVA, PROTOTYPE 909, JOHN
SELWAY, SCOTT RICHMOND

If you have any questions, please e-mail me at speakman@biost.mskcc.org.
Please also mail me there if you (1) have any suggestions for people
we should invite onto DJ Online, or (2) live in/near Orlando or Detroit
and would like to host a DJ Online from there (you should be able to
figure out which ones :))

But please DON'T do a REPLY to this message unless you are ABSOLUTELY
CERTAIN it will go to just me and not to the huge list of mailing lists
in the Cc: line.  If you're not certain, please just mail me at the above
address.  Thanks!

John

Check out Sky Cries Marry- sort of on the same level but with female vocals 
and a little less tech- They are from Seattle but don't really have that 
Seattle sound- More like the Ozric's meets Jefferson Airplane in a car wreck- 
I have never seen them live, but can imagine that they could blow your mind.

        Well there has to be SOMETHING bad about the bay area! i've never
heard anything bad about it and a place like that just cannot live in my
little taoist/zen/chaos theory/whatever shaped version of reality ;) And
growing up in rural ontario sucks too, most of the rednecks used to whistle

when i turned around they'd be shocked, stop, then start yelling "faggot
faggot" :) ahh, the good old days :) ha ha ha

         b groovy,

                brad

ps->that's right, not one measly bit of rave-related (or even relevant)
information in this post. Well, i'm having a bad day :(

For example, I posted about the excellent "melody maker" (UK) 3 CD
compilation "the serious roadtrip" bosnian children's charity CD  I
picked up a while back. It's probably the best $22.00 I ever spent on
new techno/trance/dub/rave music...

Normally, I wouldn't have bought it but the artist track looked like it
woulda creamed yer average IDM-list trainspotter's panties. SO I bought it.

At Reckless Records, I also saw, but didn't purchase:
	Peel Sessions of Planet Dog (??) -- comments?
	Some Eat Static import (not "Abduction" which I have).

So rather than spouting about how you actually have a secret soft spot
in your heart for Frank Sinatra, how about just posting some quickie
reviews of really outstanding CDs, Compilations, LPs, Tapes you've
recently purchased (give prices and location if ya can!).

Our Wallets and Our Ears Will Thank You For Your Dilligence!

Hi-
	
	After a wonderful mad raver weekend featuring the 
stompy-FnF-sunset triple kaboom, my friend and I were finally feeling 
like ourselves again last night.   We decided to mosy on over to the 
castro to check out the festivities.  Decked out in our complementary 
costumes of circa 1990's urban street wear, we felt a little guilty about 
contributing to the forces that have turned the castro party a little 
sour.  Most people were not in costume...the drag queen contingent was 
very low..and the drunk idiot contingent was extremely high.   Anyway, we 
managed to push our way through the elbow-to-elbow crowd until we were 
reasonably close to the thundering sound system that was set up on market 
st above castro.   They were pumping what i guess would best be called 
happy house, the kind of music you'd hear leaking out of a castro st. bar 
or club.   I probably could have danced a little bit to these sounds, but 
it would have taken an amount of will power that i'm seldom capable 
of.   The soreness of our muscles, and the drunkenness of the dense 
crowd around us told us to leave pretty quickly.
	What we came across next was really more intriguing.  Parked at 
18th and church was a bus with some nice sounds emerging from it.   We 
decided to go check it out, and found the bus to contain a few roland 
synthesizers, and a pair of turntables, with someone spinning more 
progressive sounding music.   There were a few people dancing happily on 
the sidewalk to these pleasant beats.  This bus had a really nice 
sounding system, and the dj had nice taste in music.  I was wondering if 
anyone out there knows about this bus, or knows who is behind it.  It 
would be perfect at those outdoor renegade parties which get broken up,  
where people end up dancing to a mixed tape in someone's car stereo.  
	
	Did anyone else see the bass-bus, or was it just wishful-hallucinating?

	Wishing I could c/u tonight, -dave.

Hmm, Lou Reed, John Coltrane, Billie Holiday, the Pixies, Conlan Nancarrow,
Young Disciples, Mad Professor, Public Enemy, Jesus and Mary Chain.

representation of the sort of music I like. There will always be more music
that I like and want than I can afford. Keep in mind, though, that for the
past few years (save the last two months), I've been buying almost nothing
but techno.

Since we've (perhaps) moved onto recommending/reviewing albums, I'd have to 
plug Sabres of Paradise' _Haunted Dancehall_...
It's chock full of spooky textures and complex beats.  Not quite ambient, 
not really dancy, it's pure Sabres, once again defying classification.
And they never have cheesy computer graphics on their album covers!  
How's that for an innovation in the techno genre?

Okay, I know it's a little late, but I thought I would add my two cents...

This was THE BEST event I have *ever* been to.  F&F has to have been the
in the "spirit of raving" an ideal-world party.

The only things that took away from this being *the* ultimate party (not in
general, just for me personally) was that I was spending quite a bit of
time running around all night making sure that all my first-time friends
were having the best experience possible. I was spending time with another
friend who came alone and was having a bad E trip. That was still pretty
much okay for me though, and not really a huge downer, just a distraction
from total concentration on celebration. The only thing bad was that I had
the misfortune of bumping into a few spooks that gave me some REALLY bad
vibes... :-( but the rest of you weren't affected by them the way they
affected me, and most likely you never even knew you saw them...

With regard to physical setup, etc. I think that the warehouse worked much
better than the last F&F due to the 90 degree rotation of the DJ area, the
added laser, lights, video, etc. And the posh outdoor ambient areas were
loads better than last time (and there were 2!) and the trailer decorated
with the branches made a totally special place.

The "first time" friends' minds were all TOTALLY blown, and they are ready
to do it again and again! One those friends sent me this:

"I want to thank you for being there with me. Now I understand."    !!!!! :-)

I feel that message is not meant for me, but it's for all of us that were
there in
celebration that night!

thanks!

 Hello SFRavers -
 Recently , Jon asked :

> how eclectic and creative this group is... so humor me, please!  Name a

 The way I answer this question is to reword it - "Which artists would I
buy a new recording of , without even knowing what the recording sounds like?"

 These are my instant buys ( not in any kind of priority ): 

 1. Siouxie and the Banshees ( proto-goth dark romantics ! )
 2. Hawkwind ( Space rock grunge/ambient )
 3. Most former members of Hawkwind ( Nick Turner , mostly )
 4. Chris and Cosey / CTI ( industrial pioneers )
 5. Bill Nelson ( former Be Bop Deluxe guitarist ) 
 6. Dead Can Dance
 7. Love and Rockets

 These are almost instant buys :

 1. Industrial ambient ( Zoviet France , Nocturnal Emissions , etc )
 1. Mickey Hart ( Grateful Dead drummer )
 2. Grateful Dead ( country rock/blues/jazz/folk/improv band )
 3. Bad Manners ( SKA!!! )

 Showing my age ...

Jeno's first tape "House Reality" fit's any of my moods. Some of the best 
music ever made, lots of acid-house and variety, even Kraftwork, Meat Beat 
Manifesto, Renegade Soundwave and a couple dubby songs.

His other tapes "Bang the Drum", "Inside the Mind" & "We Are Phuture" are 
also realy realy good. I have yet to hear any tapes or sets come remotely 
close to achieving the kind of emotional expression as these have.

Actualy Future Sound of Londons "Accelerator" album is also brilliant.

Good question--

Even when I am not listening to my assortment of house, trance, jungle, and
ambient I still hear every where I go.
Know what I mean    :)

I got to say like many others on this the man Bob Marley is top on my list
with some Ziggy, Jimmy Cliff, Peter Tosh and other great Reggae artist

I also like NIN, Beastie Boys, Alice in Chains, Cypress Hill, Nirvana, and
various other Hip Hop and alternative artists.

But mostly its those mixed tapes and CD's that are spinin around my stereo

HI everyone,

I really want to rant and rave about FnF last Saturday, but it is still
swirling around inside my head and I can't grasp it long enough to put it
into words.  I guess my secret word for the month is .....EMOTION.....
heavy duty  EMOTION.

Now for the ever popular thread about my music,
Well my music is about as diverse as the rest of my life, but at this
particular moment in time, this is whats on top of the CD player.

F R A N K  Z A P P A !!!!!!  You name it , I love it.

The RESIDENTS !!!!

local faves (some big, some small)  M.I.R.V., Mr. Bungle, Idiot Flesh,
Charlie Hunter Trio, Primus, Faith no More, Fungo Mungo, Limbomaniacs,
Candy Planet, R.K.L., and lots more, I can't even remember right now.

Pixies, Lene Lovich, Skinny Puppy, Ministry, RevCo, TOOL, Tom Waits, Germs,
Pere Ubu,  Devo, The CRAMPS,

Oh, of course you all expect me to say Reagae, Yeah I like reagae.

Brain fade, Oh well, it's a start, did I mention Frank ZAPPA !!!!


Peace, Love, and a big HUG !

Vince

In every issue of DJ Magazine from the UK, a guest DJ gets to review
a bunch of new releases.  It's far and away the best thing in the
magazine.  In the September 28 issue, Mr. C of the Shamen (who also
runs Plink Plonk, just to show he's not all Ebeneezer Cheeze :) hmas
this to say about Masa's "Drum":

    Now "Drum" really canes the dancefloor at high volume.  It's
    a superb bumpy tribal cut that builds slowly, becomes more
    trippy, intricate, and funky as it does so, then gaining an
    offbeat hip hop kinda rhythm later on; really psychedelic.
    They've [sic] pushed rhythmic percussion in a new direction
    for house music, and bumpy house DJs wbho like a techno feel
    could mix it forever.  "Basscharger" is a deeper dubby
    alternative for even darker tribalist moments.

I think that means he likes it :)  I played it at Tribal Future and
it's a top-shelf track (I also played two Plink Plonks in that set,
so that clinches it, right? -- and all this before getting the magazine).

It's quite a charge to read a review in one of these self-important
magazines about a record someone you know put out, especially if they
get it right :)

Definitely one of the best shows I've been to in a *long* time.  Their

Just a reminder that the elections are Tuesday.
I know people don't like us posting about politics on here, but I just got
a permit proposal rejected again today. If we get out and vote, we can hopefully
change things. If not, dancing will certainly be outlawed. So will loud music.

Its too late to register for this year's election but I believe it is still
possible to register in time for the runoff elections which will probably
be held. To register, pick up a form at the library or post office or the
Registrar of Voters Office
633 Folsom St, #109
San Francisco, CA 94101

If you live elsewhere, there are other local Registrar's offices.
Don't forget Alameda County's new decision to forbid all future all-night
events. I've heard rumors that there are board positions on the ballot.
Richmond dwellars: The Civic Center policy is still being debated: Use your
votes.

And for everyone: Please tell people to vote. Not just on the net, but one
on one. Promoters: Please mention it on your VM lines. If you live outside
of SF, call your friends there and remind them. Just get people talking.

Dancing can and will be outlawed.

Peace,
Colin

So is there anything good happening this weekend, I'm in a really good mood
today for some strange reason, maybe it's because I've been thinking of fond
memories of my first New Moon, tring to write about it and put everything
into a page and finding I just want to keep going. Anyway just wondering what
up this weekend, It's going to be hard to beat FnF, but as long as everyone
has a great time, that's what counts.

Sandra Maccarone, Weekly Reader's editor in chief, was traveling and could
not be reached for comment and no one else at the company could comment on
the study, Maccarone's office said.

Yeah, this is the type of public service you will get out of most
privatized industries.  As you can see, not only do they propagandize
children (in this case), but they are so insensitive to their "customers",
that they not only don't provide the best value, they aren't even
available for comment.  With politicians, sooner or later, they're made
to answer inquiries, even though the inquiries often never amount to
any punitive or restorative action (although it did with Richard
Nixon and Bob Packwood).  In private industry, there's no requirement
to even answer an inquiry in the first place.

Starchild, would you please address these issues and explain how you
will handle them?

   Little Louie Vega and Wicked sounds like a good combo to me. On the
   techno tip, Frequency 8 is back that same night. Come/Unity was pretty
   solid last night - Garth was working the crowd with some funky stuff,
   mixing in some oldies and a slow groove in the middle. Friends and
   Family was amazing as usual, and even better than ever.

   Don't forget to VOTE on Tuesday, especially in San Francisco.  The
   mayor's race, the district attorney's race and the curfew proposition
   could all have effects on the scene.

In case you were all wondering what the heck Mr. Jack Hart is quacking
about, he was responding to a private note I sent to him and starchild
stating something like "see, this is what you can expect with
privatization".

The case involves one of those free educational readers distributed to
children because schools don't have enough money to buy their students
proper textbooks... So instead a shining knight of a company, RJR
Nabisco (RJ Reynolds Tobacco) steps in, and after people are blinded by
the twinkling of the thousand points of light, after people are so
thankful that the good will of US businesses will take care of the kids
that the "government" has forgotten about -- they gradually find out
that behind the apparent good will of the company was little more than
a successful attempt at direct-marketing cigarettes to school children!

This is pretty much a microcosm of what you can expect if the
libertarians get their way, and privatization becomes rampant. Nobody
in business does anything out of "pure good". Corporate good deeds, at
best, involve positive PR, and more typically, involve motives of
profit.

Also, Starchild made some comment that the failures that we've noted in
libertarianism and privatization stem from the fact that the examples
weren't cases of "pure privatization". Same argument could be made for
socialism/communism -- it would work great in an ideal world where
corruption, greed, and money aren't a problem. Unfortunately, all you
have to do is wake up, get out of bed, and go to work, then note  how
far things are from ideal.

Sorry if this is non-topical, but I wanted to clear some things up...

Weekly Reader spread tobacco industry views, researchers say

Associated Press

SAN DIEGO -- School children who read the Weekly Reader 
between 1989 and  1994 were treated to an unhealthy dose of 
tobacco industry views on  smoking in articles that were often 
illustrated with Joe Camel,  researchers say.

At the time the articles appeared, the Weekly Reader was owned by 
the  largest shareholder in RJR Nabisco, Joe Camel's creator.

Joe Camel, a promotional cartoon character for Camel cigarettes, 
has been  widely criticized for appealing to children.

Scholastic News, a competing newsletter, was much more likely to 
include  health warnings and to give health advocates the last 
word, said the  authors of a study presented Monday at the annual 
meeting of the American  Public Health Association.

In October 1994, health advocates attacked the Weekly Reader over 
an  article for youngsters that discussed smokers' rights and the 
harm to the  industry from smoking restrictions. The article said 
nothing about  smoking as a cause of lung cancer and heart disease.

Following that uproar, researchers at the University of California, 
San  Francisco analyzed 34 articles from the Weekly Reader dealing 
with  smoking. For comparison, they analyzed 28 from another 
school newsletter,  Scholastic News, which is published by a 
family-owned company.

In the Weekly Reader, distributed to school children nationwide, 
68  percent of the articles included tobacco industry views and only 
38  percent carried a clear message against smoking. In Scholastic 
News, only  32 percent of articles included industry views and 79 
percent carried  anti-smoking warnings.

``Weekly Reader needs to change its editorial policy,'' said the  
principal researcher, Edith Balbach of the University of California, 
San  Francisco. ``They're certainly not helping kids not to smoke.''

The Weekly Reader is owned by K-III Communications, a unit of 
Kohlberg  Kravis Roberts, which was the largest shareholder of RJR 
Nabisco until  March, when it sold its interest in RJR.

Sandra Maccarone, Weekly Reader's editor in chief, was traveling 
and  could not be reached for comment and no one else at the 
company could  comment on the study, Maccarone's office said.

Balbach expressed particular concern over an article for sixth-
graders on  whether Joe Camel is encouraging kids to smoke. 
Research has shown that  Joe Camel is as familiar to children as 
Mickey Mouse, and that Camel  cigarettes have increased in 
popularity among teen-agers since the  campaign began.

The article appeared in an issue in which Joe Camel was on the 
cover  handing out ``Camel cash'' promotional coupons. Inside, 
the article  featured a reproduction of a Joe Camel billboard.

Next to the billboard was a reproduction of an RJR Tobacco poster  
advising children not to smoke. The Weekly Reader's caption said 
the  poster was intended to help children make the ``right 
decision'' about  smoking.

``You will note that doesn't indicate which is the right decision,''  
Balbach said.

Joe Camel appeared eight times in the Weekly Reader articles, she 
said.

``There were no negative markings on the photos, such as the 
international `no' symbol. In effect, they were not that different 
from actual ads,'' she said. 

Joe Camel appeared seven times in Scholastic News, but in three 
cases children were demonstrating against the character and the 
pictures had the international ``no'' symbol over them. In two 
other cases, Joe Camel appeared as part of stories on how the 
industry uses advertising to hide the dangers of smoking, Balbach 
said.

Well,
 I decided to post saying thank you for all thoses that dropped by C/U last
night and extended thier vibe to make comeunity another smashin sucess.
 Although I still consider C/U a tad too clubish for my tastes, I did find
some cherry people who walked up 2 me and started chatting.  The music itself
was a little housey buy, hey, I love house music too....

And its so great to have a day off after dancing all night.  Time to jump in
the car and go xploring...

Spins,

Adam.

Hi Everyone,

My boyfriend and I will be travelling in Spain (Madrid and Barcelona 
mostly) and Paris in December, and of course, we would like to check out 
"the scene" there. So who better to ask for tips than people on this 
list? If you know of any clubs, stores, cafes, underground-type places, 
etc. in any of those or other nearby locales, please let me know! We're also 
interested in jazz clubs (both traditional, for lack of a better word, and 
acid) and any other recommendations regarding places to visit, stay or eat -- 
we are trying to experience the culture more and do the touristy stuff less, 
so any advice on how to avoid the Pier 39s of Europe would be appreciated!
By the way, we won't have a car - we're planning to rely on our feet and 
public transit.

Thanks much.
:)
Kathryn 


P.S. I tried to send this yesterday, but it never showed up on the list 
(as far as I can tell anyway). Anyway, sorry if this is a duplicate message.

The biggest club in Barcelona is the Apolo ( Nou de la Rambla 113- 
Paralelo 61). Dj record stores (aka sources for flyers) are hard to find 
in Barcelona, there used to be one called Revolver Records, but I don't 
know if it is still around. There is one really good clothing/dj shop in the 
Barri Gothic, but I can't remember the name or where it is. The Bari-Gothic is 
home to many trendy shops, so if you walk around you should be able to 
find one, just listen for the bass. I can't really comment on the jazz 
scene in Spain, but you might find more in France, or even in some parts 
of Switzerland (Luzern and Zurich). Generally, I've noticed that the 
farther south in Europe you go, the more disco/happy euro-house the clubs 
are, and the farther north you go the more acid/hard techno you get. I 
guess you should look in the middle?

	I recently picked up Transmissions from Planet Dog - a sampler
	from the various bands that make up the Planet Dog label. Two
	CD's with a smattering of tunes from Eat Static, Banco de Gaia,
	Timeshard & Children of the Bong. The music is of the Trance/
	Techno genre, speed varies (although never that fast), and even
	though the featured artists follow a similar theme, they each
	have a distinct & recognisable sound.

	Some fine tracks throughout, most notably from Eat Static &
	that Banco fellow, although I'm less impressed with Timeshard
	& Children of the Bong (not bad, just not that good).

	If, like me, you own none of the contributors other CD's, this
	will serve as a good introduction - if you already own material 
	from these artists, maybe its not such a good bye.

	The revelation was Banco de Gaia, in particular Mafich Arabi, a 
	delicious, complex & original record. Unfortunately, I've been 
	unable to find any of his other CD's (I believe there's one 
	older one, and a new release out around now).

  Hi everyone I guess I'm coming in toward the end of this discussion but 
I'll add a little. Two CD's I got recently and really enjoy are the 
Rising High/Moonshine compilation "TranceFiction" and "leftism" by 
Leftfield. Trancefiction has some really good stuff here, especially 
Casper Pound and Sound Enforcer. Leftfield is just awesome to listen to.
All their well known songs (Original, Open Up, Song of Life, Release the 
Pressure) are here but in different mixes as well as songs I hadn't heard 
before. Everything on this one is excellent-lots of bass and tribal 
influences (Black Flute and African Left).
 
  Overall, while I listen to a lot of styles of music I haven't bought 
anything but techno/acid/house music for years. Except for some Didjerido 
music ala Stephen Kent.

  Another thing with the recent postings on confusion between Stareyes 
and Starchild I noticed there is a second Austin as well! So I'll include 
Tinsau in my signature while he uses Phunky.

To reply...the transmission from planet dog was my firs tintroduction to 
that label about 2.5 months ago...since then I have bought the new album 
from all but timeshard...I especially love eat-static implant...a kick 
ass tune!!and children of the bong symbol 1...another cool alien type 
thing that is pretty freaky...
	the banco de gaia new album last train to 
llasha is awesome...I loved it the very first time that I put it on...
	The same goes for Children of the bong...the release Sirius 
Sounds is terrific, track 1 and three are especially classic...
	The eat static took a little more getting used to...it is faster 
and more in a club atmosphere than the rest...but after a few listenings 
it has definately grown on me.
	All in all I really like the sounds coming from this label. Nice 
to chill to.
all of these releases are excellent for various moods sitting around the 
house...not too much base to make you feel like you are at a club or party
or something.

Well, weather permitting, we are going to try for one more outdoor event
this season - and since we've had a little rain, we may well try to pull 
it off in the woods !  (Sclepping up and down from the beach is NOT my 
idea of a good time)

We plan to have a couple of guests spinning from 10:30 to 12:30 ( Mike 
Smith and his friend Dave (whose last name escapes me) who have recently 
moved here from the east coast) followed by MARS, MysterE and Cyr.

$5.00 donation and please dress warm.  Smiles mandatory.
Call (415) 541-5019 for directions.

btw - LOTS of very new music!!!

               If I could speak the way I wanted to with each and everyone
of you in the most personal intimate way, I'd want it to be.  If I could not
have all the fire that I have, I'd want it to be.  If I could constantly be
in a perfect state of Zen all the time, I'd also like it to be.  I know for
sure that when I'm at peace, the fire in me is calm.  My mouth, what a long
story.  My whole life saying the wrong thing, time after time.  If I could
count the number of people I've offended, put off, said the wrong thing to
time after time, it may take my soul perminatly out of cosmic working order.
It's  hard to apologize when you can't see what your doing  until after it's
done.  As wide as I try to open my eyes, I'm always over looking things.
I've never meant any bad Energy towards anyone and that seems to be the only
truth I know.  Sometimes I wish I could be more aware, cause once the damage
is done, it's to late.
I feel contradicting when I think of what Frequency 8 means and how I
sometimes act.  My goal is the Eighth Frequency, and trust me, everyday I'm
not on that level, and every person I come across with wrong Energy to, I
feel it.   I feel my biggest challange in life, calm the fire and just Be.
I geuss I'm honored by Life to have such an oppertunity; be in Zen or pay
the price.  It's not easy to actually have a sensitive soul under all this
mess of crazy Energy.  To every person I've made contact with on this
planet, and to those of you that I've met in the dream state, please know
that I'm under construction.   If I could find a way to take back every bit
of Energy that I've misplaced, misdirected, or malfunctioned with I would.
It seems only at that point would I be able to start fresh with everyone of
you and introduce myself again the way the Real me would like to.
So what is Frequency 8?  From my understanding there is a certain
consciouness that we can attain while on this planet.  The highest that we
are able to get to is the Eighth level of understanding.  This "level" is
determined by how in touch we are with ourselves emotionally, physically,
and spiritually.  Most people in our society are around a level of 2 to 3.
Buddah, Jesus, and Mosses attained the 8th level.  They were Enlightened
Beings with a direct connection to the One Energy source that surrounds us.
I feel that this music; trance, Goa, Cyber- whatever it is that we choose to
call it, comes from the 8th Frequency.  It is a sound vibration.  To me this
vibration would sound as if the Mothership were fifty feet over my head and
I was bowing down in awe.
It seems that some of us on this Planet have an instictual understanding for
this sound, we don't know exactly why, but it calls us.  I feel that this
vibration is commimg from the Eighth Frequeney and is bringing those of us
who respond to it together.
My whole vision of the number 8 came to me while studying in Jerusalem last
summer.  It was a sunny day and I was standing on top of a building over
looking the remains of the Holy Temple of Israel.  The number 8 hit me with
the power of lightening.  I had no idea what the significance of the number
meant.  It was months after I had gotten home, and the power of that
experence finally calmed, that an old Rabbi told me that 8 was the numer of
the Messiah.
Leaving Home Soon,

Even though I am most likely not functioning on frequency 8 which you 
say is the highest level of understanding, I can't help but wonder what 
frequency 9 is like.

Niels,

I knew this was going to be brought up by someone... :-)

No, they really are real.  If you check the credits I'm actually the 2nd
author on all this stuff and I can provide the internal Hubble archive ID
numbers for you to go and find the files for yourself.  Its just Murphy
giving us an interesting twist that the pictures happened to be taken on that
date.

They're bloody nice pics though eh?  If you think these are good wait until
you see our next pictures of the center of M8 - the Lagoon Nebula.

Hope this allays your fears.

I'm not normally a sci.astro kinda geek, but CNN was on while I was working
and they had this news piece on the first pictures of the birthing of stars
and the picures looked pretty spectacular. So I typed the following into
the netcom unix prompt (cuz netscape's news interface blows, and rn/GNUS is
too slow):
	cd /usr/spool/news/sci/astro
	find . -type d -print
		##	found directory hubble
	cd hubble
	scan +. last:10
		##	found this article below...

But then again, I was beginning to think that perhaps these are just
pictures of turds that have been fixed up in Photoshop. Anybody know for
sure? If so, this April fools joke made it all the way to CNN...

excerpted from the text below:

Anybody know if these are real or just a belated April fools joke?

  EMBRYONIC STARS EMERGE FROM INTERSTELLAR "EGGS"

Eerie, dramatic new pictures from NASA's Hubble Space Telescope 
show newborn stars emerging from "eggs"  -- not the barnyard variety -- 
but rather dense, compact pockets of interstellar gas called evaporating 
gaseous globules (EGGs).  Hubble found the "EGGs," appropriately 
enough, in the Eagle nebula, a nearby star-forming region 7,000 light-
years away in the constellation Serpens.

"For a long time astronomers have speculated about what processes 
control the sizes of stars -- about why stars are the sizes that they are," 
said Jeff Hester of Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ.  "Now in M16 
we seem to be watching at least one such process at work right in front 
of our eyes."

Striking pictures taken by Hester and co-investigators with Hubble's 
Wide Field and Planetary Camera  2 (WFPC2) resolve the EGGs at 
the tip of finger-like features protruding from monstrous columns of 
cold gas and dust in the Eagle nebula (also called M16 -- 16th object 
in the Messier catalog).  The columns -- dubbed "elephant trunks" -- 
protrude from the wall of a vast cloud of molecular hydrogen, like 
stalagmites rising above the floor of a cavern.  Inside the gaseous 
towers, which are light-years long, the interstellar gas is dense enough 
to collapse under its own weight, forming young stars that continue to
grow as they accumulate more and more mass from their surroundings.

Hubble gives a clear look at what happens as a torrent of ultraviolet 
light from nearby young, hot stars heats the gas along the surface of 
the pillars, "boiling it away" into interstellar space -- a process called 
"photoevaporation."  The Hubble pictures show photoevaporating gas 
as ghostly streamers flowing away from the columns.  But not all of 
the gas boils off at the same rate.  The EGGs, which are denser than 
their surroundings, are left behind after the gas around them is gone. 

"It's a bit like a wind storm in the desert," said Hester.  "As the wind 
blows away the lighter sand, heavier rocks buried in the sand are 
uncovered.  But in M16, instead of rocks, the ultraviolet light is 
uncovering the denser egg-like globules of gas that surround stars 
that were forming inside the gigantic gas columns."

Some EGGs appear as nothing but tiny bumps on the surface of the 
columns.  Others have been uncovered more completely, and now 
resemble "fingers" of gas protruding from the larger cloud. (The fingers 
are gas that has been protected from photoevaporation by the shadows 
of the EGGs).  Some EGGs have pinched off completely from the 
larger column from which they emerged, and now look like teardrops 
in space.

By stringing together these pictures of EGGs caught at different stages 
of being uncovered, Hester and his colleagues from the Wide Field and 
Planetary Camera Investigation Definition Team are getting an 
unprecedented look at what stars and their surroundings look like 
before they are truly stars.

"This is the first time that we have actually seen the process of forming 
stars being uncovered by photoevaporation," Hester emphasized.  "In 
some ways it seems more like archaeology than astronomy.  The 
ultraviolet light from nearby stars does the digging for us, and we study 
what is unearthed."

"In a few cases we can see the stars in the EGGs directly in the 
WFPC2 images," says Hester.  "As soon as the star in an EGG is 
exposed, the object looks something like an ice cream cone, with a 
newly uncovered star playing the role of the cherry on top."

Ultimately, photoevaporation inhibits the further growth of the 
embyronic stars by dispersing the cloud of gas they were "feeding" 
from.  "We believe that the stars in M16 were continuing to grow 
as more and more gas fell onto them, right up until the moment that 
they were cut off from that surrounding material by photoevaporation," 
said Hester.

This process is markedly different from the process that governs the 
sizes of stars forming in isolation.  Some astronomers believe that, 
left to its own devices, a star will continue to grow until it nears the 
point where nuclear fusion begins in its interior.  When this happens, 
the star begins to blow a strong "wind" that clears away the residual 
material.  Hubble has imaged this process in detail in so-called 
Herbig-Haro objects.

Hester also speculated that photoevaporation might actually inhibit 
the formation of planets around such stars.  It is not at all clear from 
the new data that the stars in M16 have reached the point where they 
have formed the disks that go on to become solar systems," said 
Hester, "and if these disks haven't formed yet, they never will." 

Hester plans to use Hubble's high resolution to probe other nearby 
star-forming regions to look for similar structures.  "Discoveries 
about the nature of the M16 EGGs might lead astronomers to rethink 
some of their ideas about the environments of stars forming in other 
regions, such as the Orion Nebula," he predicted.

             PILLARS OF CREATION IN A STAR-FORMING REGION
                 (Gas Pillars in M16 - Eagle Nebula)

Undersea corral?  Enchanted castles?  Space serpents?  These eerie, dark
pillar-like structures are actually columns of cool interstellar hydrogen 
gas and dust that are also incubators for new stars.  The pillars protrude 
from the interior wall of a dark molecular cloud like stalagmites from the 
floor of a cavern.  They are part of the "Eagle Nebula" (also called M16 -- 
the 16th object in Charles Messier's 18th century catalog of "fuzzy" objects 
that aren't comets), a nearby star-forming region 7,000 light-years away in 
the constellation Serpens. 

The pillars are in some ways akin to buttes in the desert, where basalt and 
other dense rock have protected a region from erosion, while the 
surrounding landscape has been worn away over millennia.  In this 
celestial case, it is especially dense clouds of molecular hydrogen gas 
(two atoms of hydrogen in each molecule) and dust that have survived 
longer than their surroundings in the face of a flood of ultraviolet light 
from hot, massive newborn stars (off the top edge of the picture).  This 
process is called "photoevaporation."  This ultraviolet light is also 
responsible for illuminating the convoluted surfaces of the columns and 
the ghostly streamers of gas boiling away from their surfaces, producing 
the dramatic visual effects that highlight the three-dimensional nature of 
the clouds. The tallest pillar (left) is about a light-year long from base to 
tip.

As the pillars themselves are slowly eroded away by the ultraviolet light, 
small globules of even denser gas buried within the pillars are uncovered.  
These globules have been dubbed "EGGs."  EGGs is an acronym for 
"Evaporating Gaseous Globules," but it is also a word that describes 
what these objects are.  Forming inside at least some of the EGGs are 
embryonic stars -- stars that abruptly stop growing when the EGGs are 
uncovered and they are separated from the larger reservoir of gas from
which they were drawing mass.   Eventually, the stars themselves emerge 
from the EGGs as the EGGs themselves succumb to photoevaporation.

The picture was taken on April 1, 1995 with the Hubble Space Telescope 
Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2.  The color image is constructed from 
three separate images taken in the light of emission from different types 
of atoms.  Red shows emission from singly-ionized sulfur atoms.  Green 
shows emission from hydrogen.  Blue shows light emitted by doubly-
ionized oxygen atoms.

        HUBBLE DISCOVERS NEW CLASS OF GRAVITATIONAL LENS 
              FOR PROBING STRUCTURE OF THE COSMOS

These two objects represent a new distant class of quadruple, or
cross-shaped, gravitational lenses which might eventually provide
astronomers with a powerful new "magnifying glass" for probing a
variety of characteristics of the universe.

The two gravitational lenses were discovered in about 100 fields of sky
imaged by Hubble Space Telescope's Wide Field Planetary Camera 2.  The
first cross-shaped lens was discovered serendipitously by Eric
Ostrander while processing HST images for the Medium Deep Survey, a
Hubble key project led by Richard Griffiths.  A second fainter and
smaller lens was identified a few weeks later by Myungshin Im.  Each
configuration is in the form of four faint blue images situated
symmetrically around a much brighter red elliptical galaxy.  The
distinctive cross-like pattern around an elliptical galaxy makes them
unambiguous quadruple lens candidates, even before spectroscopic
observations, which are typically used to confirm lenses.

Hubble's high resolution allows astronomers to extend the search to
much fainter, and hence much farther lenses, than those few examples
ground-based telescopes have uncovered relatively nearby.  Hubble can
explore a larger volume of space which could provide enough examples of
this rare cross type of lensing to allow astronomers to address a
variety of fundamental cosmological questions.

A gravitational lens is produced by the enormous gravitational field of
a massive object which bends light to magnify, brighten and distort the
image of a more distant object.  Depending on the alignment between the
objects and the mass distribution of the foreground lens, the more
distant object can be smeared into arcs or split into pairs, triples,
or even quadruple images.

Join us for an evening of deification, out-of-body experiences, and extra
trans-real music out among the EGGS in the Eagle Nebula.  Your DJs for 
tonight are Zeus, YHWH, and Budda.  No info line, of course, you should 
simple know when to show up.

For those of you who are not accomplished in trans-dimensional astral 
projection, I suggest Frequency 8 coming to a forest not far from your 
house.  It's a good take off pad for neighboring star clusters.

ps A salute to Mars, Peter, and Neils.

this is noel in albuquerque, new mexico
 
i was in SF for F&F and enjoyed it immensly.
getting out of the car and hearing JUNGLE, i sprinted to
        the tables and began dancing (not caring i was the only one)  :)
the trip-hop-like ?  stuff played outside was also a real treat for me.
although it was abit chilly, i danced my fill, until they started
        playing ambient and i was forced inside.
which i liked, but... not as much as the other styles of music and 
        the abundance of space.
 
big thanks to Amy and Mel for picking me up at airport and treating
        me like family.
and to Wayne for crash space and to all of you i met at the F&F   
        launch pad.
 
it was real nice to party with an older crowd -- more like my age.
i turned 24 the night of F&F....  :)
 
i went to Spundae on Sunday night, and Castro street on Halloween night.
i really liked DJ Carlos -- can he get the crowd hyped or what!  :)
supposedly Derrick Carter was to spin, but at 3AM, i had to go.
was anyone there?  did he spin?
Castro street was a trip for me -- that is alot of ppl smiling at one time!  :)
i felt outta place with no costume!
but got several comments about my 808State shirt...

Come Unity on Wednesday was a nice treat.
this stuff happens on a weeknight?  man -- you guys are SPOILED!!!
SPOLIED ROTTEN!!!!  :)
impressive space, but i guess it is considered a club and not a rave, right?
with 21+ in effect as well as yucky alcohol served.
music was energetic and i loved how everyone raises their hands when a build up comes :)
it got way too crowded for my tastes and dancing became difficult, so i left bout
	3:30AM and i guess i missed Garth and Jeno.

i think i got a true taste of SF dance scene.
and it wuz all that i had hoped for.

didn't get a chance to meet many of you, but geez!  there are so many!
in texas, ABQ, and Denver when i saw someone with a rave badge
	(which wasn't very often) i would rush up to them with a hug
	and introduction.
it wasn't quite like that in SF which maybe i can understand -- too many --
	once again you are all spoiled!

in case anyone might have saw me, i was wearing sports goggles and headband
	and a PLUR shirt.

love,

noel --@

*** Resending note of 11/03/95 09:04

SUBJECT: TV report / Help

Last month I was in Dallas and had the opportunity to meet several
great people there, check out the scene, and even go to a genuine, fun
outdoor rave.

Anyway, I received a request from a good friend I met there to post this
to SFRaves.  Apparently a local TV station in Dallas has broadcast a very
negative and misleading report on raves (no, have not seen it so am
taking the below on faith).  Shows how lucky we are here!
 (While in Dallas I did get the chance to witness a "posse" of cops try to
  bust the rave I was at, and they really are as hick-like (cowboy hats and
  chewing tobacco and all) as portayed on the worst TV movie - eek!)

 Please respond to the below email address as you see fit.  Thanks for your
 time.

 P.S., the report aired last night...

OK, it's time to sit down and take a few to tell the good people of ktxa in
Dallas that your not 6 grade drug doing fools.

This is the kind of thing that will in the end  destory this for the
generations after us....

>From the start of the report, when they said that grade schoolers were at
the parties to the end when the comment was made "why aren't the cops
arresting these people". Channel 5 needs to understand that it is not about
the drugs it's  about the music.

I know that most you don't live in Dallas and didn't see the report. But if
you could just take a few and e-mail support to the ktxa address we need to
show them that they are off the mark.

I'm asking for help here! Have any body you know with access to send mail.

I know that we can't change the world but we need to show that we are not
all 12 year old pill poping idots.

We need to show them that raving for some is a way of life. That it brings
togther all kinds of people. And unlike bars we all learn to respect
eachother, take care of eachother!!!!

If only the general public could have thier minds opened like we have!!!!

The address is:

kxas@pic.net

Thank You and Take Care,
jared

Dear KXAS,

I was disturbed, but not suprised, to find out that your television station
aired a misleading and innacurate report on raving in the Dallas area.  I
was disturbed because raving (parties which involve repetitive beat music)
has been misunderstood since it's emergence in the underground culture of
America, I was not suprised, because most underground cultures are.

Like our parents, we are members of a generation that want to show future
generations how to love and respect one another; we will succeed where they
have failed.  When they began their quest to make the world a better place,
your brothers and sisters of the media hearlded them as drug touting
hippies.  And now, so many years later, you uphold the same
yellow-journalistic spin.  Your way of shaping the world is grounded on
making money, ours rests on the foundation that collectively, through love,
respect, music, dance and commitment to our cause, we can make a positive
impact on our society.  What contributions do you make toward a better
tomorrow?  And don't say "offering in-depth, fact filled journalism to the
people," for television media has become the potato chip for the couch
potato: greasy and full of crap.

But that's getting us off to a negative start.  Let me back up and defend
the rave scene in general:

Our scene is not about drugs!  Our scene is about movement.  Movement that
starts at the core of our soul and is drawn forth through music -- dance.
Movement that will afford a safer, more peaceful place to live for our
children (if we decide to have any) -- social consciousness.  And movement
to educate as many people as possible on how to treat eachother with
respect -- love.

Why did you take a camera undercover to an event that would have accepted
you openly?  I am certain you would find many happy people to talk to
upfront, with a camera and lights on.  Since you wouldn't find violence,
sex or other angles to spin your story with, I feel the true fear lies in
your inability to sell the story.  The veil of low-light, undercover camera
work is a nice tactic in guiling the viewer into thinking that the focus of
your story (the people involved) is trying to cover something up.  In this
case, were you to remove the veil your dedicated viewers would have found
people eager to tell you how much "the scene" has positively affected them.

Like all social movements, there are dark sides to raving.  You decided
that it was this dark side you would report on, thus marking the whole
movement seem to the mindless viewer as an untethered, drug crazed scene.
There are people who want to take advantage of a good thing.  There are
drug dealers and those who don't have the control to monitor their intake.
But let me say this, your focus on those people is why your story was
innacurate.  That's not what we're about.

Save your undercover video clips for insurance scams, police brutality
cover-ups, political scandals and other scenes where people actually have
something to hide.  We are proud of the love, unity and respect that we
offer one another and we encourage you to do a little more in-depth
reporting on the subject, instead of trying to further scare the likes of
Mom and Pop Couch Potato who, with gin and tonic in hand, believe every
word your plastic coated anchor people spew.

If I sound mad, I'm not.  I'm just disappointed in you.  That's alright
though, I'm sure with time, as we prove ourselves worthy of some positive
news coverage, you'll change your story fast enough.  That I have no doubt.

Most respectfully,


Tony Rotundo

P.S.  While your crew was filming the story, did they notice that there was
just one long song playing the whole time?  The amazing talent and
dedication it takes to "spin" records, or rather, DJ, is worthy of ten
times the amount of coverage you gave to the only questionable part of our
scene.  But you know, we've come to expect cheap shots from you, for
without them your Ken and Barbi in front of the camera might actually have

Not really rave related but.....
I got my tongue pierced today!! :):)
I'm so happy and it looks really good.  No pain, but I am a little 
uncomfortable and I talk funny. :P
Now I have a 12 gauge barbell in my tongue - what fun!

love,
Amy

As in the early nineties raves were given a bad rap by the europiean
tabloids.  And as the age old adage rings true: "What we don't know, We
condem".  Although I'm in San Francisco And you're in Dallas, you condem me.

I rave (and have been for five years) at the age of 23.  I live a upright
social life as a salaried manager at a nationwide computer/electronics store.
 Unfortunatlly, the media, like yourselves, has forced this sub-culture into
a counter-culture.   Instigating and pitting us against our past generation
(ie parents) and the future generation (our children).  We have been
stigmatized and cast off as odd, drug using freaks.  You condem me.

It's funny how the same "dark side" of raves can be found at any niteclub,
concert, art & wine festival, or large social gathering.  Drug use and
intoxication.  However, If one were to take an accurate survey of raves to
these other events you possibly be suprised at how many events end in any
kind of violence.  I can say as a person (i.e. raver) that has been going to
events once a weekend for about 5 yrs. I've noticed that less than 6 raves I
attended ended with any kind of physical confrontation.  I doubt you can say
that with any of the other socialy accepted functions listed previously. 

Actually if one of your reporters were to go to a "Rave" she/he might be
suprised to notice the communal feeling with fellow ravers.  Many of us are
quite non-violent, yet, protective of our own. We have to be.  You caused
this...

I am not bitter.  I have no hate towards you, media.  However, It is sad to
see that since you dont understand us, we're evil.

But, we will still grow....

What a misguided perception of our scene. I have no idea where Joe Normal
gets the impression that all we do is drugs and party. I mean, I haven't
seen this "documentary," but it's GOTTA be stupid and wrong no matter what.
When are these people going to see that all those people who go to raves and
get fucked up on "E" or whatever and die or get arrested ARE NOT RAVERS. For
the life of me I can't figure out how they came to that conclusion.

don't mean to make your decision even more difficult but "Be There Now"

You can get info on what's happening in Portland and the Northwest by
subscribing to nw-raves right here on hyperreal.

There are two or three big warehouse style events in Portland every
month these days.  Not my cuppa, but there ya go.

Brad Vachal's the organizer of Down & Out on Thursday nights at Up Front.

Saucebox on Broadway is just starting a Sunday night thing.  

Queer Night at La Luna is every Monday, probably the strongest weekly in
the Northwest now.

The rest is cheezy disco and pop-house, although some people like the
Panorama.

the gardening club loves you all

        As you can see below over the last year, "the gardening club" has
brought you a contrast of Dj's and many different genres of music from
Psychedelic Funk to Disco to Techno, ambient and Jungle. All brought to you
in an environment based on communication and inhaling THC. Our music
programming has always been to ask Dj's to bring a set of music that they
have always wanted to play but never get a chance to.(every Dj has a set of
those weird tunes).

        Our Job is done you have been educated by "the gardening club."
        Repetitive music that all sounds the same does not have to be the
basis of  clubland.
        You have to experiment, to allow yourself to evolve!

Thank YOU.  I couldn't make very many Gardening Club nights as I usually
had to be back home in Portland on Mondays, but quite a few of them stood
out over the past year, especially Gamall's amazing live jungle performance.

Next time out, *I* wanna bring my "weird tunes" :-)

Well Tim et all,

My answer to this is probably getting all too obvious, but it's outdoors
for me. I am looking forward to a whole winter of steamy indoor parties,
but an clinging desparately to summer (?) Call me a dreamer, but this looks
like the last outdoor F8 for this year.  AHHH, trees, stars, da moon (only
a few days from full),and the glowing, beautiful energy of the forest.

I'm heading for the coast, see ya there !!

Hmmm, 
This is a tough one, I went to a F8 a few months ago right by tonights
local (but on the beach) it was nice, a good positive crowd and music I
dont usally get to hear.  While Wicked will have some good DJ's , King St.
is not my favorite lacation( those fucking wire chairs are not my idea of
comfort ect.)  Space Children has a nice line up and wow! I just called the
info line it's 20 buck's! and at club Arte, doors close at 2,   yep F8
sounds good to me!!!

Have fun!,

Mark

i read your reply to the news station.
you bring some good points, but in calling "them" names and teh such, we 
only stoop to their level. it creates opposition, before they think about 
what youre saying, they have already taken offence, and will tend to 
naturally cling to their beliefs that "raving pollutes the minds of young 
innoscent children with dangerous chemicals" rather than hearing what you 
have to say.
POSITIVE energy is easy to reitirate when everyone is loving, caring, 
concerned. but it is in the face of those who dont understand that we 
need to show our POSITIVITY the most, teh virtues of our scene.
other than that, i agree wit you, and thank you for taking the time to 
voice your feelings. Its a beautiful scene, and i hope you dont take 
offence to my comments.
smiles:) tom

sorry I came onto the music topic so late, but...

here's a brief summary of my musical history (or "How I got into techno", 
by Seth Horvitz)

-4th grade Duran Duran
-5th grade I became a breakdancer, started listening to Run-DMC, UTFO, 
Grandmaster Flash, Egyptian Lover, etc.  Hey, when are thick shoe laces 
going to came back into style? 
-6th grade Prince and all associated projects (Morris Day & the Time, 
Appalonia, Vanity)
-7th grade Beastie Boys
-8th grade I started getting "alternative", and continued through high 
school (Depeche Mode, U2, the Cure, Smiths)
-12th grade I simultaneously became a 4AD addict (this is a record label, 
not a drug :) and a punk rocker
-College was the turning point for me.  I started branching out into 
weird experimental/industrial/goth rock, but soon discovered the magic of 
T99 and LA Style in combination with a certain hallucinogens.  I became 
fascinated with all forms of electronic music, and have continued to be 
since then.  I still listen to all kinds of music, but all of it somehow 
seems to GO with techno in a strange way.  I generally like all forms of 
music that were either inspired by, or somehow seem to work well in 
combination with psychedelics of any kind.  

Anyone else want to tell their "how I got into techno" story?  (as 
opposed to the "how I got into raves" story)

-Seth

Last night we went to a restaurant "RAW" and Conscious Labs was playing 
ambient toons while the chef served up totally raw (cold, uncooked, vegan) 
food.
It was super hip. Andrew got his soup and then his pizze, then a half an hour 
passed and I got my stuff (soaked , not cooked, rice among other things).
There were ravers there :] Expect to be there a while, but I swear we felt 
high when we left.             ...  on 9th near Lincoln

PS sad that Rabin was killed :[

   Saturday, November 4th - space children - Be Here Now

I have a little odd coincidence story to tell everyone, so bare with me.

A group of us were planning to drive from Reno to SF last night so one my 
friends could Experience San Francisco one last time before moving north.
Things didn't work out though, so we ended up in Barnes and Noble (a Reno 
bookstore) late last night. We were wandering around aimlessly when all 
of a sudden Jennifer pulled a blue book off the shelf in the New Age 
section and ran over to me.

The book was entitled _Remember: Be Here Now_

Both of us were more than a little spooked by this, especially when the 
first page she flipped open to WAS THE BUTTERFLY THEY USED FOR THE FLYER.

I bought the book; it's incredible. All of these thoughts on life from a 
very plur-aly, ravey, consciousness oriented Eastern philosophical slant. 
(If no one objects, I'm going to post things from it from time to time-- 
it is an INCREDIBLE book.)

Anyway, later we ran into a friend, and when we showed him the book and 
the flyer, his eyes got really big, and he said "You are supposed to be 
there. I've never seen anything like this. It's amazing the way the 
universe works. Even when you can't physically be where you're supposed 
to be, the energy of the universe always seems to draw related things 
into your life exactly when they're supposed to be there."

It cleared up a lot in my mind to hear this. Lately I've been frustrated 
by my geographical constraints. I had been wondering if my life situation
was causing some wierd form of chaos to invade my life and cause my growth
process to become stagnate. I realized then & there that no matter where
you go, no matter what you do, you are where you are supposed to be. And
that's all there is to it. :)

(About the book: There are no author credits given.
The front section was written by Dr. Richard Alpert, Ph.D, one of 
Timothy Leary's cohorts at Harvard during the LSD experiments) 

Hope your weekend was wonderful!
oh, and if anyone did go to this... what was it like? 

					lv, Alex

A warm greetings to all this fine morning...

So with all the festivities of the nyght I choose F-8 as my droppad, dancing
to some very intense sets.  I top off my Mao cap to the DJ's (in reverse
order): Cyr, Mystr-e, and MARS... They came up with some innovative tunes,
yet kept that common "trait" which keeps me coming back.  Unfortunatly I
didn't make it to hear the start-off DJ's nor thier sets.  

Dispite the chilly cold around 4 or 5ish the atmosphere was pretty chill.  I
actually got a kick out of the more clubby types that dropped by during cyr's
sets. I invade thier world @times too, so respect is given. Opening horizons,
that's what it's all about.

I do apologize for "bumpin'" into a few of yous or your friends.  One of the
DJ's did state that I have an "aggresive dance style". I dance how I dance,
all I can state is that thier are no enimies in the the floor of dancing.  So
apologies again are given.

As for Yoda, we'll chat later @ Degohba

Smiles-o-meter

Vibe:  9smiles (nice build up sets, with a few wrenches to cross up us happy
dancers)

Friendship Factor:  8.5smiles (Lot's o friends both old and new.)

Dancing space: 8smiles (I guess Im getting used to more spacious areas)

Tunes:  9smiles (Lotsa energy at this one, I believe it's the music in the
end to allow us to move the energy from one soul to another)

Overall 8.75 Smiles. All I can state is that It's going to be interesting to
see how much F-8 will improve after the winter.

In closing,
Everyone searces. Dj's search fo a better beat.  Phlosiphers search for
better words. (I search for a better spell-checker) Dancers search for a
better spin. Life is that adventure in searching.  Look hard. Look at others.
Look in yourself.  What do you search for?  One day, we may, or may not, ever
find it...
So,till then, enjoy your ventures...  

Spins,

Adam

This had to have been one of the most diverse parties I've been to in a
long time, something for almost everyone.  I debated whether or not to go
becuase of the steep cover ($20) but I'm really glad I went.  The crowd
was pretty young (some of the kids looked *really* young), I'm sure most
of the 21+ were at Wicked.  I got there around 11:00, some dj was spinning
some progressive house, I wasn't really into it but things really picked
up when Jonah went on after.  Wow, I've always liked Jonah's taste in
music but last night he was just incredible, his mixing has really
improved (although there were some wierd spots).  Lots of techo that you
just don't hear played that often, some of it was even a little funky.  J.
Saul Kane (Depth Charge)was on next, I was expecting him to be better
technically, a lot of his mixes were sketchy but his records made up for
it.  A mix of chuggy depth charge dub stuff, some IDM (he played a couple
u-ziq tracks and some other stuff I recognized but couldn't place), some
techno stompers and misc. electronic wierdness.  It was great.  DRC played
some decent hard trance, i was bored by her set at first but it really
picked up later, and the crowd was going nuts, I think her set probably
got the best reaction of the night.  DJ Dan was amazing as usual.  After
Dan was an impromptu jungle set by Goldie (in town opening for Bjork). 
Even though I'm not into jungle, it was interesting nonetheless.  Some of
the slower dub-style jungle was really cool, but the super fast snare
cracks get on my nerves quick.  I'm glad I got a chance to see him spin
though.  I'm pretty sure hardly anyone knew who he was, a lot of people
didn't know how to react to the music and subsequently the dance floor
started to clear out midway into his set.  I was hoping to catch a deep
house set by Mark Farina but after about 90 mins. of goldie someone else
came on (Graeme?).  Around 5:30 I decided to head out.  All in all, great
party, definitly worth the money... 

Anyone else go?

Yes, and since it was Dallas, I hope they took note of the popularity
of "pep pills" on the country music scene.

Myself, I wouldn't try to say who is or isn't a raver, and you missed
the point anyways...  They're saying the problem is kids buying drugs
at raves, not that ravers are all drug fiends.

 I'm going to show my age but Dr. Richard Alpert, Ph.D is also know
as Ram Dass the author of the original "Be Here Now" which came out in 
the late sixty's and was a tremendous Pop cultural phenomenon, it turned 
a tremendous number of "hippie" kids onto (eastern) spiritual ideas many for
the first time.  You might want to look up the original in the library 
and compare the two.

Yeah I was there (doin the door as usual),
	If any of you went (who don't know me) I was the giant Black Man with
the guest list.  I must say that this party really kicked (much better 
than the last two :).  For me it's not a real wicked unless you can truly 
say at the end of the night "Shit, now THAT was Wicked".  This party lived
up to my expectations.  The line up was: Garth, Jeno, Lil Louie Vega, Thomas.
We had good numbers this time even though we are still at King street but
that should be changing hopefully after the first of the year, if anyone
knows where you can throw a more or less legal party for 800 with loud
music in SF (and have it be bust proof) let me know :) Anyways, I knew the
night would be good with many "old timer's" comming out like Cindy K,
and Rox. Not to mention a lot of "new faces", Wicked still amazes me as to
the diversity of the crowd, and tonight EVERYONE was in the house, New York
Homeboys to SF Muscleboys, with many Charms and Strange Attractors 
circulating through the crowd (who was that masked girl?, I don't know
but she left this silver nipple ring :) Any way garth started off with 
a typical Garth on the disco tip set, although this time he played pretty 
good stuff, Jeno moved in with a truly brillient Jeno set, I knew he 
would be goos as he always makes a good showing when the New York boys 
are in the house, I guess people are like terrirorial like dogs and have 
to "mark" their territory, still I found myself irresistably sliding into 
that Trance state which is always the indicator for me.  Next came Lil' Louie
Vega who is fully on the New York - Chicago House tip,  I must say that I was
not impressed with his performance as he came out the gate but after about
30 minutes he seemed to get on the wavelength of the crown and proceeded to
fuck it up! Maybe it was the inspiration that was dancing down in front of
him (JSL can I get a witness :) In any event he may have started out a 
little slow, but he eventually did lay a solid foundation from which he 
proceeded to "Build his house" and by the time he was done, he definitely
had a mansion standing.  Thomas straight back from England by way of New York
took the controls in his classic closing role and kept the crowd dancing
(and most importantly still in the house, he seems fresh from his travels
and ready to get down to some serious work.


Full Moon Rave is tonight. Come out because it might be the last one outdoors
until the spring.

I went to Your Mama's on Saturday to hear star Eyes and was sadly 
disappointed when she wasn't there :[   However, I still got to hear (I 
think) Thad.  At least that's who the woman working there said it was.  The 
music was really cool and I love that cafe.  I highly encourage people to 
go to this cafe.  They have a lot of different DJ's every night, 
including trip-hop and house on various nights.  (they have a listing of 
the different DJ's)  I think the place may be hurting for customers 
because I have never been there and seen more than five other people.  

The cafe is set up with turn tables in the corner and couches and big 
chairs with rustic tables spread across the rooms.  There is a pool table 
and they serve both coffee and alcohol.  The walls are painted with 
really cool graffiti art.  I think the atmosphere is really 
chill and could be so much more if the place had a little more notoriety.

I highly reccomend this place to be checked out.  I'm pretty sure I'll be 
there next Saturday to here star Eyes and Thad spin.  :]

XXOO,
kc

What? This is about the time they should start doing them. It's time for

This is correct.  Lil' Louie dropped the serious bomb on SF Sunday 
morning at Wicked.  It was truly the mosty amazing set I've heard to 
date.  The mix was flawless, the mucis was so large, expansive, trippy, 
housey, trancey, and big, it was inbcredible.  There was no use of the 
useless crossfader, since Lil' Louie worked 3 faders and three decks with 
little problem!  He had perfect control over the music and where it was 
going.  He filled that room with such emotional content people literally 
went off (I know I did!).

Basically he has built a house, a really big one onto which proper folx 
would do well to build upon, and add to.  Incredible!  The energy was 
incredible, the people, for a Wicked, were really nice, and everyone got 
on the goodfoot.  Louie played some of the deepest HOUSE music I"ve 
heard, as only he can put it together.  When my man plays a 110bpm 
record, and the polyrhythms carry it up to 120, it shows how well he has 
mastery over his music.  He also brought so many acetates and first 
pressings, stuff you might never hear again, it was well worth the minro 
annoyances that happen at Townsend.

The Dr. was in, gave some lessons, dropped some bombs for good measure, 
and left everyone scrambling for their brain cells.  THE SHIT WAS ON!

SF is all about the groove!

Shouts & propers to:  The Black Man, DJ Loren & SO Tracy, DJ John Howard, 
Andrew (Yo man!  It was good seeing you out!  Look forward to your next 
show!),Yashoda, Rox, Sistah Barbara, & Micro (I hate big ass, sweaty, 
pushy, muscleboys at times too!), and all the people who bathed before 
they raved!

Also shouts to Wicked for bringing in talent from all over!  Nice one!!!

Peace,
John

P.S.  When asked "Hey man, what did you think about Lil' Louie?!" I 
replied, "Uhhh, yeah...." (my brain had been reorganized).  Out!

funny, this sounds remarkably similar to my experiences...

>-4th grade Duran Duran

>Grandmaster Flash, Egyptian Lover, etc.  Hey, when are thick shoe laces

Pretty much the same here, but I was also really into New Wave music.

>-6th grade Prince and all associated projects (Morris Day & the Time, 
>Appalonia, Vanity)
>-7th grade Beastie Boys

I went through this odd easy-listening Cat Stevens/Elton John phase then.  I
know it was a strange time for it, but I was an odd kid.

>-8th grade I started getting "alternative", and continued through high 
>school (Depeche Mode, U2, the Cure, Smiths)

Definitely the same.  I was obsessed with the Smiths through the entirety of
High School.  I have this Smith's cap that one of my friends bought me my
Junior year, and I wore it for almost three years straight.  He said it was
the best money he'd ever spent.

>-12th grade I simultaneously became a 4AD addict (this is a record label, 
>not a drug :) and a punk rocker

My senior year I was still really into the Smiths, and I listened to Kate
Bush almost daily.  I've always listened to punk off and on, but it's never
been a lifestyle thing.  My 4AD affliction didn't start until college, but
it's still with me (as if you didn't know).  However, I have to disagree
with Seth.  It _is_ a drug.  

I'm not sure when I started listening to techno or house.  Actually, I
started listening to ambient first.  Come to think of it, I still listen to
ambient more than any other style in the spectrum of electronic music.  My
roommate last year had a copy of One A.D. (which is _excellent_, for those
of you who haven't heard it).  From there I started listening to Higher
Intelligence Agency, FSOL, picked up a great compilation called Wasted (a
collection of songs from the Volume samplers.  There's another one called
_Sharks Patrol These Waters_ (with many a 4AD band on it), but Wasted is the
one with the dance-oriented tracks on it), and from there I was pretty much
hooked.  I didn't really start listening to more upbeat stuff until I
started going to raves, but even now I don't own that much house or techno.
I'd say about 80% of my cd's are either bands on 4AD or ambient.  

Just so you know.

Peace & kibble,
Jake

I'd have to agree, I've been to a few other ones and it was pretty cold..People 
just have warmer clothes, tents, sleeping bag,(a fire if permitted of course). 
Most of the time I see people with warm clothes coming in to the party and in 
about 1/2 - 1 hour most of those clothes are off because they dancing alot. The 
cold air is somewhat good, and keeps you from over heating, key is drink alot of 
water and if you stop dancing for a while put on those clothes you took off or 
use the tent, sleeping bag thing until you go back out. This might be a good 
thing to do a survey on. If the DJ's and everyone else doesn't mind a little 
chill, I don't see why they can't be all year round, (of course the rain might 
be a bad thing for the equipment, but then again there is always tarps and 
things to use as cover at least for the DJ's and equipment. With everyone 
pitching in and bringing things to use to cover the sound system up with, 
everyone could have just as much of a good time there as any other time..IMHO. I 
think if I knew how to spin and had a sound system I would love to do it, Just 
seeing everyone, dancing, jumping up & down and just letting it go, Big Happy 
Smiling faces looking up reaching for the ran and loving every minute of it. 
Thought would be one hell of a sight to see. Just all the energy for seeing 
something like that happen would be overwhelming. Try to picture it and tell me 
you didn't get a big smile on your face, and say, "Yes, that would be awesome.

Tim (knucklehead) This is how I would feel.

hiya! this is susie's annual don't forget to vote tommorrow....

also susie's raver guide to voting...

NO ON L ...this is the curfew law for kids 18 and under....and you know 
this law is going to be used to harrass kids and shutdown raves...

yes on F this is the youth commission thing for kids 18-23...if this is 
enacted maybe we could have some kid-ravers have some say in what is 
going on in this city..hopefully it will be enacted before i turn 24...(:(:

yes on G this is going to improve the office of citizens 
complaints...right now as we can recall (say the new years bust thingy) 
there is little to no recourse for police fuck ups...hopefull a yes vote 
will help fix that...

i could go on and on about other things and politicians...but i think i 
will narrow it down to two politicians...

no on frank jordan (can you say matrix or hating the soma nightlife scene>?)

yes on halinan (usually i dispise libertarians {starchild, present company 
excepted} but he has usual been pro leagalization of pot and been very 
helpful on the curfew issues...

so have a great voting day...and show em what the voting raver can 
do...susie (:

        Hi all 
Sorry for taking so long to respond back but I was without E-mail till today
(10 days!!).

Well what can I say.  SF is a crazzy place, a very intense city but it's
heart gives off a great vibe.  I quickly wrote up a top ten reasons to visit
San Francisco. (drumroll please)


Top Ten Reasons to Visit San Francisco
10. The  Hotel Californian:    
        No joke, that was the name of the hotel I stayed in.  OJ's prison
cell was larger               than my room!!  I expected Don Henley to be
walking around (get it, Hotel                 California, bad joke  ;-)
9. 70F Weather:
        I didn't realize how warm it was until I returned home to find the
air a brisk 40F.              BRRRR!!!  There would be no way you could have
an outdoor rave in British                 Columbia right now.     
8. Celebrities:
        I saw the brother of Robert Crumb (you know .. he wrote the original
Fritz the Cat         comics) walking down the street. Okay, Okay, I saw the
brother a celebrity!! 
7. The Scenes:
        Haight St, Berkeley, Telegraph Ave, Castro, etc, etc.  Great places
to hang out.  
6. Education:
        I learned about the Schmoo or Schwa as Amy calls it.  (I still can't
pronounce                 or spell it!!).  I learned that Burning Man did
not involve any human sacrafice to my         great relief (all that mud,
the writhing bodies, the fireworks, the fun). 
5. The Castro Halloween Party
        What a party!!!  SF should have a party like that once a month and
donate the               money to a good cause.
4. Wayne's Launch Pad
        One Word: groovey
3. FnF
        What a concept!!!  A gathering that had amble ambient space (2 in
fact!!), free              water and candy (with donation), neat little
cubby spaces, good music, etc.  Why         can't other promoters get their
shit together??
2. Ethan's Set
        Mindblowing...manic...insane...Can't talk...Have to dance....Have to
dance...
1. SF People
        Amy, Melanie, Tristan, Noel, Jon, Jake, for the company.
        Wayne, Vince, for the laminant.  
        Amy for the ride.
        Carolyn for the warm hugs.         
        And any others I forgot to thank for making my trip such an awesome
experience.      
        
John

wait are you serious...i know you're not...i dunno where Joe Normal gets
his perception...yeah he gets it from the million and one people that call
themselves ravers that can't go out without doing drugs...i haven't seen
the documentary either but im willing to bet he isnt wrong...that IS one of
the main facets of the rave scene and while doing drugs do not a raver make
they are certainly the main diet of almost everyone at "given club"....i am
going to take this opportunity to send a message out to all the people that
think they can't go out without an E or think it is going to somehow change
things....if you aren't going to a club for the music or the people than
why the hell are you there...also, I think the point of E is that you can
learn something from it (how to open up, be friendly, etc.) and carry that
over to your real life...just remember that taking an E is not a substitute
for being a truly nice person with a scintillating
personality...thanks...sorry i had to go off but im sick of seeing everyone
so fucking dependent on a dodgy white pill...

     Back in NY I heard this phat CD which I've been keeping an eye out for
ever since, but to no avail.  It might be a double pack, but I'm pretty sure
it's 1 disc of Richie Hawtin  and John Aquiviva (sp?) tag teaming... seeing
that they're going to do something on V-rave just reminded me enought to ask
if anybody knows where I can snag a copy.  Any help appreciated... ;'D

 its me again, emmanuels book is copiled by pat rodegast and judith 
stanton. its excellent in providing insight not just in Energy, but also 
about what is outside the "physical realm"
	quantum physics and wave mechanics are definetly a part of 
spitituality. we should have a chat about that sometime.
someone cool to talk physics with is greg of F&F, house archives, if you 
ever run into him.
smiles :) tom

i thought the celestine prophesy was great. a girl i had met for the 
first time ended up sending me a copy. it was a nice way to recieve it, 
from an almost total stranger i had met by "coinscidence"
i think something is happening with consciousness, on a personal level 
for me, but on a global and community level as well. its in all the 
mystic literature, and its obvious if you open your eyes...


or rave for that matter.

Huummmmm, this sounds awful familier. I think all of you who were at
Burning Man had the same vision I had reading this post. It was truly
awesome to be dancing in the rain, with lighning crashing all around and a
ring of people around the DJ holding up a tarp over him until the rain
stopped.  AHHHHHHHHHHH  such sweet memories.

I have to go dance around the shop now ,

peace, love and a hug,

Hi everyone, hope you have a great time and that it's warmer than the
last Liquid there when we all gave up at 2:30 due to frozen fingers!
I'll be thinking of y'all while I'm doing my own full moon practice

In the paper, I saw that Steven Martin's documentary,  Theremin:An 
Electronic Odyssey is playing at Lumiere in San Francisco. If you a big 
fan of electronic music, I highly recommend this film. It's a documentary 
about Leon Theremin, the pioneer of electronic instrument. He is the 
inventor of the Theremin, which is an instrument that makes a weird 
eerie vibrating tone (the instrument was most notably used in sci-fi films 
such as "The Day the Earth Stood Still").
If you've ever been to the Exploratorium, there's a Theremin that you 
can play with in one of the sound booths. The film is about the inventor's 
life (which is very interesting!) and how he has influenced people such as 
Bob Moog and Brian Wilson (there are interviews of them in the film). 
Moog said in the film that he one of his main influences in buliding 
synths.

So glad to hear the DEEP shit goin' over so well in SF. I'm from NY
originally and always make the reliqious pilgramage to Sound Factory Bar on
Wed. for Louie and Frankie K. on Fri. when I'm back there. If you ever find
yourself in the vicinity go check one of these boys spinning solo for a
full night for 7 hours (count em', 7) straight on a sound system designed
just for them, with a large percentage of the music they spin produced by
themselves. With all due respect to the Wicked DJs and other house DJs on
the SF scene, these boys can seriously take them to school when there on
their home turf.

KEEP it DEEP

i am so incredibly blown away, though it is 4:30 am, i must write:

the communal full moon was at 24th and illinois, all decked out with 
candles, shrines, a huge mandala made of rocks and scraps, plus an 
awesome system...j and k, i believe...

phrank was playing when we got there, and then gavan hardkiss, who was 
playing all kinds of freaky, groovy sh*t, such as some really cool trippy 
trip hop stuff and lots of other goodies.  first time i've heard him play 
dance music and it was worth the drive and the momentary tensions of a 
night out. 

this party was defintely very Yin.  there was an ankh in the mandala, for 
instance.  

a proverb, said to be from china:  the moon is in the water and the lotus 
blossom is in the sky.

two cops showed up around 3:30 and said to shut it down, but now it's 
moved out to the berkeley marina.  monty and consciousness sound labs i 
believe are going to play still.

the music and the vibe harmonized perfectly as this party.  i feel 
fulfilled, thanks to the moon.

and also a little shiatsu, from g., recently moved back from japan.  i'm 
feeing mighty good right now...

see you later!

"Yes" You certainly understood how I felt when I wrote it, I closed my eyes and 
was thinking of how people would be like if it was raining or something. And 
that's how I saw it. And it gave me Chills and goosebumps too. After that 
experience, the rest of the day at work seemed alot better. I kinda wanted to 
leave work and go dance in the rain.

The homey from NY was correct.  SF DJ's , as a whole have quite a bit to 
learn from the more senior members of NY's DJ community.  It's apparent 
every time a NY DJ comes to town.

Pierre, when he played @ Wicked, both times, created such mayhem it has 
yet to be equalled by ANY SF resident DJ.  Lil' Louie stomped so much 
butt this place is still shaking from his presence.  And Mark Farina is 
probably getting to the top of his game here in SF, still heads and 
shoulders above others.  I guess it all comes down to class and style, 
along with serious record buying habits.

The other thing brotha from NY pointed out is the serious shortness of 
sets that SF dj's tend to play.  I really don't like going out to hear a 
DJ for 2 hours, f*ck that crap.  1.5 hours is even less useful.  I want 
to hear a MINIMUM of a 3 hour set, or better yet 2 5 hour sets from 2 
DJ's.  This 4 DJ's in 10 hours (or worse at most parties), really stink 
IMHO.  First, the DJ usually starts getting into the set after a good 
30-45 minutes, others it takes longer.  But before you know it, it's the 
next DJ's turn.  Yuck!  Lil' Louie played for 3 hours, and IMHO that WAS 
NOT ENOUGH.  They shoulda let him close the place IMO!

I really dunno wassup with SF.  I've talked with P-Dog and some of the 
other veteran promoters about why the 3 to 4 DJ lineup.  The dog will 
usually only have 3 DJ's max at his parties, so at least he is trying.  
When I see a flyer for 5 or more, I know better than to waste my time 
geting into someones set, only to be replaced by completely different 
grooves right when I'm starting to get into it.  Screw it.  Sf should get 
a clue on this point.  People want to hear alot of music, but not 
necesaarily from alot of people.  I think it's coming though, rest 
assured.  There will be someone who does a real music experience, with 
good DJ's, spinning a minimum of 3-4 hour sets.  The days of 100 DJ's 
on one flyer have already started to wane, andnot a moment too soon.

Hell, I would love to hear any of the DJ's I really enjoy play for a few 
hours on 3 decks.  Most of the accomplished better known DJ's can do this 
with little effort.  I think however that laziness on the part of both 
promoters and DJ's has set in, and it'll be difficult to break.  Also 
people now have patterns of behavior that they're not willing to give 
up.  I do wonder if there was a party that had Just Lil' Louie alone, 
would people come and pay $15-$20 for JUST one DJ.  I think SF would be 
more than willing to accept 2 for that price, I doubt we're really ready 
for just 1 DJ doing a 7 hour set though.  There will still always be 
people who think more is better (DJ-wise).  I am NOT one of those people.

I think things are slowly changing though.  Velvet Shop often features 
just two DJ's.  Simply Done as well.  Not familiar with the lineup at 
other weeklies, but I hope they followe this trend.  I remeber Wicked's 
where only two of the boys would spin.  I do miss those days.

I hope SF DJ's and promoters get it, and stop flooding us with tons of 
DJ's with tons of music.  It's NOt the quantity, it's the quality that is 
the real barometer of excellence.  NY has once again shown SF how true 
this paradigm is.

Props to NY, I gotta, and I mean, GOTTA get there in 96!  Record 
shopping, some clubbing, and of course some good eating.

SF's got a ways to go yet, but it'll happen.

One other note I think contributes to SF's lack of, how shall we say, 
music quality: record production.

Let's face it, the majority of the people who come here from NY and other 
places are making the music they spin.  Yes, there are plenty of record 
companies here who are either established or starting up.  But what 
percentage of them actually have working gigging DJ's producing, and 
re-mixing material?  Not enough, rest assured.  And that is what gets 
me.  We have some really talented folx here in the city.  They spend 
plenty of time and money perfecting their craft, no doubt.  But you'd 
think with the mass of talent here that more of them would start at some 
point to get into the real ART of the music by CREATING thier own music.  
Don't get me wrong, I am well aware of the people who are DJ's making 
serious tunes (Tony & Doran, HardKiss, Dubtribe, Buck, Digit, EFX to name 
a few), but there are so many DJ's and so few of them have devoted the 
time to make anything other than that which can be made on the dance 
floor.  I think that's the main difference between Chicago, Detroit, & NY 
from SF.  The talent in these other places not only spin records, they 
make them too.  The amount of cross pollination between the artists in 
these locales is evident each time they visit.  Here in SF it's 
realtively few who take the time and effort.

I've heard it all from "Man, I want to perfect my form first...", or 
"..when it's time, it's time.  I've only been spinning for 4 years now 
and...", whatever.  Shit, I bought some Pierre Trax from 86-89.  Yeah, it 
was immature, but at least he was starting at a time when he was 
beginning to push up.  I think that music will go only so far as long as 
the DJ's involved are isolated from the music creation process.  It's 
much more than beats, it's much more than melody, it's much more than the 
parts that make people go yeah, versus people going YEAH!.  It seems 
people who create the music have a much better handle on how to control 
it (witness Vega & Pierre).  And until you learn how to control it, move 
it, manipulate it, all you're doing is putting 2 and 2 together to make 
4, with some minor variations.  That's the difference between SF & NY 
DJ's IMHO.  The more DJ's are involved with the creation of music, the 
better DJ's they will be, plain and simple.  You will only go so far just 
spinning records.

I've said quite enough...thanks for listening.

Peace to you all,
John

P.S.  Did I mention Lil' Louie dropped a bomb and built a house?  Well, 
he did!

Out.

Yeah man, I hae to agree.  Not taking away from any of the talent here, 
but SF can learn quite a bit from the process by seeing how other DJ's do 
the do.

I am fairly sick and tired of going out to hear 5 or more DJ's play for 
1.5 to 2 hours each.  It defeats the purpose of listening to music in the 
first place.  I wish that people would begin to throw parties with just 1 
or 2 DJ's spinning a minimum of 4-5 hour sets.  When I see 5 DJ's on a 
flyer, or announcement, I know that's not where I want to be.  I want a 
DJ to take me on his/her trip, but how can they do that if they only have 
2 hours.  Basically it doesn't happen.  And it certainly happens less as 
you become more mature with the music.  For instance, it was fine for me 
3 years ago to hear a DJ for 2 hours.  Now I want a minimum of a 3 hours 
set, otherwise, it's really not worth the effort to go out.  It takes a 
DJ 30-40 minutes to find their pocket.  Once thier in it, you're gonna 
let them go after 1 or 1.5 hhours?  Not.

I think the problem is laziness on both the parts of the promoter and the 
DJ's.  DJ; are now used to playing 2 hour sets max.  Some want more, but 
the promoter want to please people so he/she will book more talent.  They 
have set up a pattern here people are used to, that is the more DJ's the 
better.  People often feel as though they are not getting thier monies 
worhtwhen they are asked to spend $15-$20 for 1 or 2 DJ's.  The paradigm 
has been set and people are just follwing the simplest instinct.  to be 
fair, I do know that people are trying to change things by allowing no 
more than 3 DJ's (Stompy being one of the parties), or allowing DJ's to 
spin for more than the standard 2 hours (Wicked being the other).  But 
there are still people who want 100 DJ's in 10 hours.  Sick IMHO.

the other problem is  the people from out of town have a disticnt 
advantage over SF, they create thier own music.  Yeah, there are plenty 
of DJ's in SF who have/are producing (i.e creating) music.  But it falls 
far short when compared to the number of spinning DJ's overall.  Could be 
that SF is immature in this sense.  The real difference between someone 
who is considered good , like a Jeno or Markie, and a Lil' Louie Vega is 
a combo of years spinning and the fact that Louie or Pierre or Derrick 
create thier own music.  This is a great help to any working DJ.  You 
hear things completely differently when you spend time creating music as 
you would JUST spinning it.  That's the difference.

I wonder what Jeno, Markie, or even a talneted guy like Mark Farina 
starts to create music on thier own.  Could be devastating to hear, and 
maybe we'll hear these guys as well as others do 4 -7 hour sets as std 
operations, instead of the tiny 2-2.5 hour sets they normally do.  Their 
music will change radically as well.  Face it, the best DJ's are the ones 
who can not only spin & mix well, but who can also make the music they 
themselves would want to spin.  That's the difference between 
NY/Chicago/Detroit and SF.  In time though, I hope this will change.  
Until then, I'll stay home, make some music, spin a little, and wait for 
the next visitor from out of town to drop a house.

I LOVE house music!

Break the paradigm, support parties with 1 or 2 DJ's.  For this old 
house's sake.

Much peace,
John

P.S.  Did I metion Lil' Louie Vega dropped a bomb, and built a house?  
Well, he did!

Out.

most of this theory originated in the EARLY 1900's with the fundamental
destruction of then-current newtonian understandings of physics by
einstein's general and special theories of relativity, which really served
mostly to validate the discoveries by many other physicists that matter IS
energy and the fundamental building blocks of matter (quanta) are simply
"tendencies to exist" governed by no other will than their own.

On your way into The City bound FMR last night you had to pass a bunch of
illegally parked mobile homes and their occupants, replete with mangy,
skitish dogs, on 24th Street.

When the cops came at 4am or so, the first thing they said, and their basis
for shutting us down was:  "Don't you have any respect?  There are people
living 200 yards from here!"

I couldn't hold back.  "Excuse me, sir?  Is it legal to live in a trailer
200 yards from here."

Because of his enormous training in always telling the truth, Johnny Law
blurted, "No!"  But then, realizing the impact of what he was saying, he
copped (pun!) an attitude and came down on me with a classic
slamming-iron-bar-look and said, "Sir!"  As if to say, "Now we all know
that our reasons for shutting down this party are BS, but you're not going
to question them are you?"

Another classic example is that while the sound guys were packing up their
gear, thus showing that we understood the party was over, the cops started
talking to a random woman and while she was going on about this and that,
he was saying, "Are you in charge here?  If we could talk to the person in
charge then we could get somewhere."  Mind you packing is taking place,
because they had spoken to the people in charge.  He was blatently saying
that he didn't need to talk to this person, and that it was wasting his
time to talk to anyone not in charge (can you say "ATTITUDE!"?).  But when
he said, "Did you organize this party?" and she replied "Well, I've
organized parties just like this."  His partner nudged him and said,
"You're not gonna get anywhere with this group."  Classic.  At least one of
them had a sense of humor.

Later!

Tony

P.S.  The party was great.  Very cool.  And not too cold!

Geez, John, you should hear what people who know the NY scene say when
they visit or move to SF.  There's much more going on here than there
as far as places to go and variety of dance music.  The Sound Factor
Bar has been CLOSED for months, got tha 411?  There are rumors it will
reopen.  Meanwhile, the Tunnel fell all over itself paying Junior 
Vasquez a princely if not kingly sum, plus who knows how many tens
of thousands of dollars to build him a special DJ *apartment* at the
club including a shower, small recording studio and room for all of
his assistants to do his chores while he's mixing.  yes he and Louie
and Frankie Knuckles and Pierre and all of them are the great ones,
they have what it takes to do 4, 8 or even 12 hours of spinning.  Not
everyone does or should even try.  

I'll agree about short sets, it may just be me but I'm a slow starter
and don't get going until 30 or 45 minutes in most times.  The hour-and-a-
quarter sets I've been getting this year are the cruelest slots for a DJ,
just long enough to start rolling and then you have to stop.  An hour and
a half is good, two is better and three is best.  Beyond that unless you
train like a marathoner it's awfully hard to keep up the momentum (plus
you have to start planning those 14-minute Wild Pitch tracks for the
bathroom breaks, heh!).  Even an hour is better than 75 minutes because
you know it has to be in, bang, boom, out.  

The biggest continuing problem for me in the scene has to do with the style
of music.  I know, I'm old fashioned and all that, but the tracks I've been
hearing and even buying the second half of this year just don't move me as
much.  Last night I put on one I bought this week I thought was pretty good,
a test pressing remix of G Spot's "Make That Move," versus a now-famous
but then-obscure 1993 track, "Moment of Truth" by Brian Transeau, Dubfire
and Sharam (long before they made it as Remixers of the Day like they are
now).  It wasn't funny, it wasn't even sad, it was kind of depressing.
The sound now is on the doleful, minor-key side in all genres (except some
jungle, oddly enough).  Production is flat, everything's starting to sound
samey even to me.  House always had the dark side, just listen to some of
Felix's early stuff.  I'm not going to say I'm going to stamp my little
feet and throw a fit until things get better, and maybe it's right to say
that progressive house had its day (as acieeed did) and there's no more
left to say . . . but I doubt it.  

The music is reflecting cultural shifts as much as creating them, and 
I see what we're going through now as a kind of retrenchment after tghe
optimism of the early 1990s, the fall of the Berlin Wall and the rise of
democracy in eastern Europe and Russia, and now we're dealing with the
aftermath worldwide.  We elected Clinton here and he is presiding over
the final decay of people-oriented politics in an age of cynicism, spite
and the alfuckingmighty dollar -- attitudes which are well entrenched in
what used to be an underground and devil-may-care music scene.  

You can't stand still ever, and I feel like my own musical horizons have
broadened considerably in the last couple of years, but yknow, even
though nobody played longer than 2 hours hardly ever in 1991-93 in SF,
I'll stand some of those sets up against anything the masters could throw
down not because they were technically as superb as what Junior or Pierre
or Mark Farina or Derrick nowadays can do, but because they were an
amazing fit to the times, the crowd, the feeling that change was in the
air.  But the scene was always built on a restless imagination and the
moving finger of fate has moved swiftly since then.  We're all getting
a little bit in a rut, if you ask me, including myself, and I think it
is important to keep probing the edges, make it uncomfortable from time
to time, risk something, try something you think won't work to see if
you can prove yourself wrong.  

I think John raised some really good issues in that rant and it's always
a good thing to shake the SF scene by its self-satisfied, jaded foundations,
but don't forget, THIS is where the greener grass is by the estimation of
almost any other place on the globe :)

peace

     Ya' know, NY ain't all that a few of you are making it seem.  I admit,
NY is pretty phat, a lot of the old skool DJs still play out all the time at
the local parties (I.E. Frankie Bones, Adam X etc.) but still... the scene
there is definitely 2nd rate compared to SF.  The music quality is usually
excellent at the parties, but there are _NO_ promoters that are into it for
the fun, and for the good vibes, they are all just trying to make a buck.
 Half the time they even do things like put DJs names on flyers before
they've even tried to book them... I went to a party where the whole damn
flyer was based on Plastikman and he didn't even show up!  Trust me... the
scene here in SF is first class; great vibe, fantastic music, and a real
community...

     Louie Vega & Frankie K. are both great, but the Sound Factory is truly
one of the worst experiences I've ever had!  They wouldn't let me in because
they thought my ID was fake (well... it was ;'D), which I can deal with, but
they wouldn't let my friends in because they didn't look cool enough!  I
don't know about the Sound Factory in San Fran, but I stay away from the one
in NY as much as I can...

Speaking of Theremins (that's something you don't hear much), I saw one at
the Pere Ubu concert on the 1st.  Most of you have probably heard on before
in a recording and just not known it.  It looks like two triangular pieces
of metal attached to two separate posts that you move your hands around to
make different feedback-type sounds.  If you've ever heard something in a
song that sounds like guitar feedback but sounds a little to weird, that's
probably what it is.

Thereminally yours,
Jake

Idea in the really cool department, dance floor sized theremins.

I was not talking about the scene Fred, I was adressing the music, the
style of mixing, and the sounds.  Sorry, out of town DJ's often fuck this
place to shreds.  That is not to say we do not have a cornucopia of talent
and music, but we have a dearth of the type of talent that is a Pierre,
Humpries, Vega, etc.  It will happen, but it hasn't yet.  I do think we are
on our way.  Time will tell.

Yes, I know about the Sound Factory in NY.  But that has nothing to do with
what I was talking about.  I was talking about the music, not the dance
culture there.

Right on, thus the continual learnoing cycle we all could benefit from.
GeoffW pointed an article out to me that he read in jockey slut. Said
something to the effect that people should stop trying to build new
foundations, and stop groundbreaking.  Maybe it's time to build on what has
already been built.  So far things have been so disposable and there have
been so many new houses built, people feel the need to buid more.  When in
fact we should concentrate on how to take things to the next level, build
onto what has already been done, and additive process that consumes less,
but makes more.  Right now all that's being done is tract housing, nobody
has taken the time to even add additions to the houses they built.  Too
busy spending time building something totally different, and I think thats
where the rut lies IMHO.

I'll agree 100% AGAIN!!! :):):).  SF is rather special, I am priviledged to
live here with all these house music hoodlums, house mavens, and straight
up crackerjacks!  I do love it here, this is my home!  But I will never be
so arrogant as to say SF cannot learn lessons from other places and
peoples.  Stagnation is NOT an option.  Learning and diversity MUST
continue to flourish.

With that my man, much peace!,
John

To say that we have nothing to learn is to close your eyes to many
possibilites.  We ALL have something to learn.  Every one of us, despite
where we are from.  Learning never stops and we can all learn something
from those who visit our city, as well as learn from those who are here.

In agreement here as well.

You did not read both of my posts then.  Whatever.  I cited ALL of the

Yes, I understand this as well.  But that is no excuse IMHO.  There are
plenty of people who have been able to scrape up ennough money to dupe
tapes, it just requires a bit more funds to go the next mile.

Fact is the "working" DJ's , when they manage their time and money
properly, can pout out a record.  It's been done before.

Geez.  What I said was the truth, what you said was the truth.  Fact is I
have talked to DJ's and gotten a variety of answers.  The bulk of them have
admitted dragging thier butts, while others have gone out and done
something.  Most WANT to do something, but get sidetracked.  I am well
aware of both poles of the argument.  Thus, Buck, Hardkiss, Tony, Etc.  I
am well aware of who is doing what in this city, and I don't need to go out
every weekend to know wassup.  Been there, done it, excelled at it, now I'm
waiting to hear thier stuff.  Time is on my side, they'll make music if
they want to.  And when they do, if it's good, I'll buy it.


>
>Where are all of the parties _you're_ throwing / spinning at and where's the
>music _you've_ made, John?

Where have you been since '92?
Check the SFRaves Archives.  See Vortex.  I don't like to toot my own horn,
so I won't.  Suffice it to say I've financed and thrown parties many times
in the city (6 to be precise).  All were anywhere between 400-500 person
digs.  It was all good, I had a good time, made plenty of lifelong friends,
got to know some folx.  It was all good.  Did my bit of promotion and work
for Preston and Martin as well.

As for the music I've made, cut my first records when I was 19 with a group
in Fla. called Noveau Riche, and very 80's thang, kinda Pat Benatarish
meets the b52's.   Did my share of demo shopping in England back in 83-86
for Aural X, another Fla. 80's thang group (Prince meets Duran Duran).
Invited by some A&R folx at RCA, Capitol, Beggars Banquet, to show my
wares.  Started 20Hz in 94, faltered, got back on my feet, and restarted
things.  Looking forward to working with a couple of people, one of which
is on the list, the others are works in progress.  I do what I say, and I
say what I do.

I would ask you the same question but it's moot, it doesn't matter.  I, as
many know hate critique without solutions.  I would be the LAST person to
get on this list, cite problems, and do nothing about it. Obnoxious at
times, yes, do nothing, NEVER. History should be your guide, read the
archives for any other elucidation you might require.

But since you asked:
Spun at :), CyberLab 7, Velvet Shop, as well as smaller house parties for
friends.  Come out with tapes about once a week, mostly for myself, but
hand them out to selected friends who want to know how my skills have been
getting.  So yeah, I've spun out, made music, and own a record company.

Oh yeah, I'm slated to spin at Butterfly with Charlotte (she asked me btw),
so you all are invited down (sorry it's 21+), but the music is good.  It's
always good to hear Charlotte, she's the bomb!

>Where are the labels you're helping start up
>and/or fund?

Check out http://www.twenty-hz.com
20Hz Records is mine.  Releases set for early '96.

>It's easy to armchair quarterback the scene when you're just a
>passive participant.

Your characterization is insulting and incorrect.
(People who know me know that usually I would have leveled someone for
trying my patience, but the moon is full and people are reacting to it.
Whatever.  Soemtimes people get me, other times they don't.  I'm the same
with others.  Such is life, but please go on.)

>It's a lot more difficult to be critical of people when
>you're actively engaged in the scene. I may not groove too hard on the tunes
>or mixing style of the Wicked crew, but I respect them mightily for doing
>things their way for as long as they have.

I also have respect for all those who do the do in SF, from Wicked to F&F,
I think people who know me know that about me.  As for being critical, I
try never to lose my objectivity.  If you're too wrapped up in it to see
that there is room for learning, then I would suggest that maybe you're too
close.  But that is my humble opinion.  You may well think otherwise.  I
respect that.

>over the edge here in San Francisco.

As for control of music, ain't heard it like I did the other night.  Jeno
is a master, but rearely pushes the envelope these days, same can be said
of most of the other mosre seasoned DJ's.  Not to say they aren't good,
they just don't push up as hard as they used to IMHO.

And I doubt you would find too many DJ's here in SF think as highly of
themselves as you do.  Ask them do THEY think they are just as good as Lil'
Louie or Pierre, or Carter.  Many of the most well known DJ's aspire to be
at the level these guys are.  All you have to do is ask.  I would be
curious as to what you find out about how THEY feel about themselves.  Once
again, it's not to say they are not all good and talented, but face it, the
bigger boys from out of town are in a differnt league, you can hear it.
And any DJ who is working can hear it as well.  Any honest Dj would admit
it.  The good thing is, in time they will be in the same class as the
people they admire, but only through effort, recording and traveling will
they get to that point. It's a long road, no doubt.

As for putting me over the edge, that has not happened to me in quite a
while.  Jeno , Garth, Markie, Thomas, Josh, Tony, Buck, Noel, Ernie, James,
etc. have all put me over the edge.  Had religious experiences to most of
their music.  Been listening to them for YEARS.  Just waiting for them to
make the next step and move to the next level.  It does not mean that they
are not talented, they all are, I'm just waiting for them to make the next
step in each of their respective evolutions.  I look forward to their
changes and their future musical pursuits!

>
>I guess what chaps my butt is seeing you pull that old tired "grass is
>greener" argument out of the closet again.

You misunderstood what I said.  I said SF Dj's have something to learn from
NY DJ's.  I was talking about style.  You were not there for Vega's set so
you have no reference point from which to draw as it relates to WHY I said
what I said.  It's not that anyone is lacking, it's that there is plenty to
be learned.  Since you did not see the Dj's watching Louie do his do, you
assume that they have nothing to learn.  From what I heard from the bulk of
them, they were listening really hard , and observing a master at work.
Period.

Didn't say we didn't have alot of talent here.  Did not degrade the talent
of the many DJ's here.  But let's face it, I do not think we have produced
a Pierre, Vega, Humpries, Rosario, etc.  Yes, we WILL produce our own
versions, but that will happen, no doubt in the future.  I look forward to
it!  The talent, as well as the drive is here.  Time will be the ultimate
judge IMHO.  And from those I talked to the future is quite bright.

Thanks for some truly great times and music. I'm very bummed to see that

Just wanted to say that I had a great time at the Gateway Systems Full 
Moon party last night hanging out with my new housemate Minor Minor, who 
played a totally stormin' set, by the way.  It's too bad there weren't 
more people there to enjoy it! More people started to file in once the 
monday weeklies shut down (Mad + Gardening Club), and Gavin Hardkiss 
warmed them up with some slow trip-hoppy grooves.  He managed to 
gradually speed it up, turning the set into a tweaky ethereal acid stomp, 
which I really got into, despite the sketchy mixing.  Then, he whipped 
out Melissa Ethridge, and it was all downhill from there.  Oh well, his 
first 45 minutes or so were great, and we left before he finished.  Also, 
Brad from Consciousness Labs did a really good warmup set of dreamy 
ambient to begin the evening.  A great party overall, I just wish there 
had been more people to share it with!

YES! the beauty of it all is seeing so many people turned on to the same 
thing. i know the *high* you refer to. some people just exist with a 
higher vibration. our own energy tends to seek out those of a higher 
vibration, and when we meet, it brings teh vibration just a little higher 
thru exchanges in Energy. and insight. something just cliks, and i find 
myself talking about deep things with strangers, trusting them, and teh 
beauty of it is it doesnt only happen at raves, but *everywhere*.
we just need to open our hearts. and allow our minds to become servers of 
our hearts. it is just backwards teh other way around.

Good evening -

I had such a fun time at the Full Moon collective party last night (until
those silly guys in uniforms came to restore the lack of music in the
neighborhood) that I forgot to retrieve my dark blue zippered jacket from
where it was sitting on the rocks.  Did anyone happen to pick it up?  I
went back today but didn't see it anywhere.


-Andrea

Yeah, well don't go a lookin' in the SOMA area for any of those... some
wacky SFR guys ( who will go unnamed! :-) ) took down a bunch of them
tonite!

Said to random Tenderloin street-denizens tonite in response to their
questions:

"Uhh, why are we taking them down? Well, uhh, we're part of the 'Yes On E'
poster removal crew!" and "Oh, what's prop. E? Well, it's the 'Make SF a

Since when does being able to mix a record constitute a being good 
musician.  I 
think they do relate to each other somewhat but you DEFINETLY do not need 
to know how to dj to produce good music including House and Techno.  
Personally I am glad a lot of dj's are not making tracks, especially the 
ones that do know how to work a crowd and are the Rave/House scene 
stars.  These are the guys that seem to produce the formula tracks you 
know the ones that rock the house (the mainstream houses), but do nothing to 
innovate or push the music to advance.  Admitedly their are some dj's 
that can dj and produce some great tracks (DJ Pierre was an excellent 
example) but not all of them.  The art of mixing is building and creating 
energy, or dropping it, fucking with it, suprising people etc between 2 or 
more tracks.  I find these tracks that try to do it themselves with the 
big drum rolls and then the booming kick drum then the break etc, are 
pretty fucking cheesey, which did rock the crowd when it was an original 
concept, but it is a total formula that many dj's tend to repeat when 
they release their own tracks  (DJ Icee, Josh Wink etc....).  Personally 
I would much rather hear more tracks by guys that are not normally 
associated with the house and techno scenes, stuff like what the Jack 
Officers (Butthole Surfers), and Elliot Sharp have done.  Sometimes when 
you are so immersed in a scence (like being a big time dj)  you tend to 
loose a lot of creativity and insight, and it takes someone to come in 
from a totally different angle to really come up with the fresh shit.

wow, check this out!  This is truly excellent, all of you
should turn out and at the very least check Hallinan out,
he's the closest thing to non-corrupt DA material we've
seen in AGES.  I'm truly impressed.

Discovered Hallinan won the first round this AM!  I truly believe his
achieving the office would be a big plus to the dance/party/club circuit,
as well as against curfews etc.  My unprofessional guess is that most of
Arlo Smith's votes will go to Hallinan's opponent, so rallying the
non-voting rave troops is pretty important, as well as raising funds.

Subject: SF vs. NY hoohah!
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

I'm the person who responded to John Lee's glowing review of Little Louie
with the comment about how Louie and some other DJs in NY can take the
Wicked DJs and others from SF to school when on their own turf - which I
guess is what touched off the round of knocks that my man took for agreeing
with me. (we don't know each other, BTW).

Unfortunately, my mailbox at my ISP got fucked up so I've lost the threads
and can't respond directly to comments made, but I have a couple of things
that I'd like to say in general.

First of all, it is no accident that, although I grew up in NY, I now live
in SF. I agree with you all that the SF vibe is unmatched in many ways (and
this extends well beyond the dance scene for me - i find the vibe superior
to NY personally in many, many respects).

What I don't understand is why it seems that when a sister or brother
expresses an opinion on this list that doesn't go with the "Rah! Rah! SF"
flow in all respects, that people seem to get so defensive about this
place.

If you read the original posts, you may have noticed that John and I both
began our comments by giving props to the SF DJs and saying that we had
respect for them. I think John also made it clear that he was just talking
about music and not about promoters, party-vibes, or anything else.

Again, this does not take away from the brilliant, beautiful people
contributing to the scene here (many of the people mentioned in defense of
SF- Jonah Sharp - Ethan Miller - Buck - and others - are deeply valued
personal friends). I think what they are all doing is great (and I have a
feeling John would agree). BTW, I saw Buck's dad Randy on Monday and he
told me Buck will be returning to SF in December to set up a studio here!!!

If those of you that slammed John are so thrilled with the SF scene, than
you should feel confident enough in it to accept positive comments about
people/music from elsewhere without being so freakin' defensive.

And, as far as vibe goes, remember that we in SF certainly don't hold any
kind of monopoly. Even at a "commercial" venue like the Sound Factory Bar
(I was last there in July) I have had incredible times participating on a
sweaty, throbbing dancefloor full of people with smiles, hugs, and friendly
words for a stranger).

Keep it goin' on y'all!!!

Peace out,
ek

This was written by my brother. Please read.

Sisters and Brothers,

	DO YOU WANT TO GET HIGH? Try eating organic short grain brown rice
for seven days and convert those wonderful complex carbohydrates into
simple sugars by chewing each bite at least 50 to 100 times. We are living
in an age where the food we eat is produced as fast as we can grow it with
little or no consideration for the health and well being of the people
that consume it. Have you noticed massive quantities of chemicals
displayed on prepackaged food? These chemicals are responsible for keeping
us static. They manipulate our minds, making us feel confused and
frightened. Most Americans live in so much fear, you can feel it by
walking past them on the street. By eating food sold in major supermarkets
we are setting up the necessary criteria in our bodies for degenerative
disease to surface. The mass produced food doesn't have the organic wild
nutrients our bodies and minds crave to be happy and stress free, with
positive goals and the tools necessary to obtain them. 

	DO YOU WANT TO DANCE FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE? A major reason why
we live in fear is because we eat animals that DIE IN FEAR. Whence their
turn to be slaughtered on the conveyor, they know what's going to happen
to them because they can smell the stench of their comrade's blood. They
excrete mass amounts of adrenaline that shoot through their entire bodies
attempting to escape. This fear, along with all the chemicals that are
used to grow the feed for the animals, not to mention the chemicals fed to
them and applied to their bodies, get transferred directly to YOU. The
American mass consumer (you) is unaware that they are contributing to the
destruction of forests, and land that could be used to grow food for us.
90% of all grain grown in the U.S. is fed to livestock instead of humans.1
People are starving and we indulge ourselves eating chemical laden meat
and then buying products from the pharmaceutical companies to counteract
all the symptoms. Our bodies are trying to tell us that we are doing some
thing wrong.

	DO YOU WANT TO LIVE AS OUR ANCESTORS DID? Humans have been
surviving and evolving with staple grains for thousands of years; Asians
eat rice; Germans eat buckwheat and rye; Indians eat chapatis and lentils;
American Indians eat corn; Africans eat millet and amaranth; and Aztecs
eat quinoa. AMERICANS EAT CONVENIENCE. Try not eating ANY animal products
for a week or a month and see how it feels. We now have the knowledge and
power to eat only what our bodies need. Visit your local library and check
out books on Macrobiotics, Ayurveda, herbs, and sprouts. Get motivated for
a physical and spiritual transformation! Shop the health food store bulk
bins for quality organic grains and beans. We are lucky to be living in
the bay area where the ancient foods are easily accessible and
inexpensive. Give your body what it really needs and feel deeply
nourished. More and more people are eating this way so you will not be
alone. It is part of the solution to the world's problems and it begins
with you...
							love*love*love

Why give them props in the age of cheap commuter jet planes! Just fly
'em out here -- pronto! I'm willing to pay $15.00 - $20.00 to see a
live show performed by a east coast band, why not import a single super
star nonlocal DJ (and I ain't talking Keoki) and have a rave?

In other words Wicky-Heads -- please get Pierre out here again....

I was trying to keep the purely political stuff on the list to a minimum, 
but since you guys apparantly feel the need to keep telling sfraves how 
nutty libertarianism & privatization are, I feel a brief word is in 
order, to wit:

If the government sponsored a rave, and people were coerced to 
participate, how much fun do you think it would be?

Anyone who would like to see my fuller response to Niels posting below can 
email me and I'll be happy to share it.

I love San Francisco!!!!!!! And I love the SF rave scene!!!

But you should see those NY and Baltimore kids dance! They are FUNKY. I used
to just watch people and think, "How the hell do they do that?"

Also on the E. Coast we had some rave promoters who were very dedicated to
bringing us DJ's from around the world. I got to hear people spin from
Germany, Belgium, England (of course), L.A., SF, Montreal, Philly, Boston,
Toronto, NY, DC and Baltimore! etc. etc. Here that is definately the
exception rather than the rule. We have our own little British Invasion, but
how often am I going to hear the same 4 or 5 people spin at every party I go
to? (Just start flaming me now!)

There also seem to be a lot of folks who don't want to pay more than $10 for
a party. I would definately spend $20 or more to hear some really talented
DJ's who never get to spin out here. I mean, if these people have to be FLOWN
around the world, that costs money and I will pay the money for a really
kickin' party. I guess I just have to figure out how to put on a rave myself
or stop saying all of this.

The bottom line for me is that SF has the best scene by far, but I miss some
of the very talented DJ's I used to hear.

i started eating less meat and a lot more fruits, vegetables, amd teh 
such. it really helps clear the mind, and center teh spirit. also, being 
a socially aware raver, it helps to know that *everyone on this planet* 
could be fed if 
meat consumption went down, and land was used to grow those good green 
veggies and fruits.
90% of energy is lost from the transfer between plants to amimals, it 
seems more logical to consume the Energy direct from the earth, rather 
than getting a fraction of it later. not to mention all the other good 
points the below post mentiones.
anyways, thats my spiew for teh day.

Why are you always siding with big money and big interests? Have you
noticed that:

(1) there are industries around more moneyed than schoolchild journalism
(2) these industries spy a marketing channel and fund deployment into
    the marketing channel via profits from higher margin sale (typically
    the channel, but often, it is worth $$$/power owning your own
    "independent' channels just in case...
(3) they are better funded than an independent competitor that is genuinely
    interestied in K-12 publishing as an "art" and an avocation, not
    because it'll fatten their wallets.
(4) they use their funding to dominate the competitors, simply because they
    want to sell you something "between the lines"....
(5) eventually, they are the sole voice and they have their marketing channel

This is typically the way things work when it comes to privatizing
essential human needs like education. We believe the future role of
government in a true democracy is to ensure both financial and personal
democracy, given the added pressures and profit motives brought on by
communications and the media and a world where information is a
commodity/necessity.

"Freedom from being the victim of someone's profit motive" is nearly
synonymous with (or at least as important as) freedom of religion. If
we can chose, to ignore it, that's fine, if it gets shoved down our
throats when it comes to the basic needs of human existance (education,
healthcare) that's no good. And that's where you're proposing to wedge
"privatization".

We are getting rather tired of watching the repeated paroxysms of this
deathkultur. Until we can figure out a way to come up with a society
where money is not equal to power, your thousand points of light are
nothing but black holes!

If the libertarian is just as interested in cottage industries as they
are in corporate megaliths then s/he too would also take on the belief
that more profit is not better, more competition is not better,
bigger/more is not better. THe exaltation of dominator pleasure in your
system of "competition for the sake of profit" comes all over the back
of economic slavery, suffering, and poverty. All the while they think
they're casting pearl necklace to swine!

This is not an optimal systems solution, and  eventually, if we're
gonna all survive, we've gotta talk "systems!". Don't be duped by
"their" wild wild west political fairytale, because unless you're rich
enough that your money can work for you so that you don't have to,
you'll just be a servant to their system! Nice Nice, Very Nice....

Not that I don't agree with many of the things in this post, but it's
still propaganda. Whether propaganda comes from the left or the right,
fanaticism of any type still breeds intolerance, IMO.  Just remember that
we are lucky enough to live in a country wealthy enough to be vegans.

Hmm me thinks you got it a little backwards, most of the world is
near vegan simply because the cannot afford meat, Meat is the thing that
is expensive.

Hey, Good post


Whenever I try to expain to people the true evil of the
profit-motive-driven system of America, and I get tired or frustrated I
just say one thing- Morality is unprofitible, thus since this country is
directed only in favor of profit all power structures (corporate and
governmental) and the power decisions they make, are inherently devoid of
moality.

 Hence we live in a "profit democracy" and only the dollar votes and not
the people (majority).  Privatization is one facet of this problem, people
have been manipulated by the media to belive that competition is good
(profitible) and thus it's o.k. to privatize services that are a right
i.e.health care and legal representation, so that only those with the most
money get the best care and stay out of jail! is that democracy? NO, it's
more like feudalism.  Soon we will have private police, Yosemite will be
managed by Disney(no joke heard it on NPR yesterday) GG Park will cost 10
bucks and muni will only service the most profitible areas... on and on,
untill taking a deep breath will be 25 cents.

Ok, consider it anti-propaganda designed to battle the ruthless fucking 
lies fed to our children by the meat & dairy industries and still 
ingraned in our heads after all these years. I thing we need to educate 
people that unknowingly ingest foods containing cancer causing chemicals 
& at the same time supporting the most wastefull & enviornmentaly 
destructive industry on this planet. If this education is considered 
propaganda & breeds intolerance than so be it. Our body's and our planet 
would be in a much better state if we lived in a society intolerant of
meat eaters.

> Just remember that

It probably costs about 25% of what it costs to feed a meat eater to feed 
me, not even counting the enormous cost of water & energy saved.

	I've never really been one to get involved in the socio-
political discussions (most of which are pretty interesting) that
sometimes pop up on this list, but I just got one of those
overwhelming urges to chirp up on this privatization thread...
Yeah, it's easy to embrace conspiracy theories, and I know there's
a romantic appeal in bashing "big-moneyed" businesses, but 
privatization, done responsibly, has historically proven to
be OVERWHELMINGLY successful... and I think Niels is confusing
the traditional definition of privatization (i.e. when a government
relinquishes control of a utility or service to private companies,
a la telephone service, mail service, airline service) with
the idea of complete libertarianism, where elementary schools
would be named after Philip Morris.  Privatization leads to
competition, and competition leads to lower prices, and since
Niels says that he wants "freedom from being the victim of  
someone's profit motive", I'm sure he'd agree that lower
prices for consumers are a good thing.
I could ramble on endlessly on this subject and put you all
to sleep so I'll stop for now, I guess :)

I will be joining the ranks of those of you that are residents of SF.
Beginning in December, I have accepted a position in that foggy city.
I look forward to being able to meet those of you I have not yet met,
and getting to know the rest of you better.

I'm not yet sure what I'll be doing about housing, so keep your ears
open.  Personally, I like rough industrial spaces, so a basement
around SOMA would be perfect for me ;-)

More details as I get em...

Frankly, I don't agree that lower prices are always a good thing. I don't
want a 99c hamburger from McDonalds, if it means forests are being clear cut
to graze cattle. 

I don't want a pair of cheaper Reebok sneakers if the Indonesian women who
work in their factories are making $2.00 a day, and are being repressed by a
genocidal dictator who won't let them organize. 

I don't want cheaper produce if I will get sick from eating it, and the farm
workers who use these chemicals will get cancer and die. 

I don't want lower prices if it means that I have to shop at Wal-Mart. 

Some of us believe that the free market economy should not dictate what our
MORALS are. Everything does not stop with the almighty dollar. Perhaps I am
lucky to be middle-class enough to make decisions like these. And make them I
will! 

Call me a raving liberal, but I intend to use the brain God gave me to
question our $$$ driven society.

No the truth is many millions of people are living at some level
of starvation. while it is true that there are several "primative"
tribes that exist of diets primarily consisting of meat (most notably
the eskimos and upper mongolians) almost of of the peoples of warmer climates
exist on diets that are mostly made up of vegitation augmented by what
ever livestock they have domesticated or whatever they can hunt down.
There are no Safeways in the grasslands of Africa.

	Indeed it does ignore several problems, but ask yourselves how many
	of you would continue to eat meat if you had to murder the
	animal yourselves instead of buying a carcass at the Lucky's?

People have eaten meat and dairy product long before there was a
media spreading "ruthless fucking lies".  Not all of us buy into your
same beliefs as to the state of the planet or humanity, and you will
not be able to convince me to come to your side, so stop.

I'm glad you have such an open mind. Yes, we are all free to exercise our
morals. But when the truth is being hidden from us, it's really hard to
figure out what the truth is. Also, I am not trying to convince anyone of
anything, merely expressing my opinion, which is just as valid as yours. 

>People have eaten meat and dairy product long before there >was a media

Yes, and people have also been killing each other since the beginning of
time, that doesn't make it right. 

I am going to stop posting these messages, since I also don't believe sfraves
is the proper place to discuss this. Please e-mail me in private if you wish
to respond.

What the world needs is a break on it's resources. I guess I should have 
phrased it as intolerance for the industry. I didn't mean lynching 
carnivores.

Sure. I guess alt.drugs/sfraves isn't the place to discuss this, unless I 
talk about the drugs they feed em'. Sorry for posting something out of 
love NOT out of intolerance. Why don't we switch to one of the usual xtc 
threads now & pretend everything is just great. And please no more of 
those interesting threads like "privitization".

Only a couple of additional points.  The recording scene is starting
to break wide open on the West Coast.  The Third Floor crew went to the
UK, made tons of mediocre remixes and some good ones, and then threw
back Freshly Squeezed distributed through Strictly, which is an SF
label in all but physical location (Freshly, that is).  Doran went to
LA to hook up with Paul Grogan and start Rampant, which defines the
new sound of the west (along with the new Twitch releases) as much as
the various Third Floor labels and the peak era of Twitch remixes did
a couple of years ago.  DJ Lace is leading the charge with excellent
trancey acidey house trax from Vangroovey.  I've heard other good things
from LA (Vox Lumania and City of Angels, for example) and SF (Pound
America, Trip'n'Spin, Astral Matrix of course, La Casa and a special
tip to Reflective which in addition to being a major worldwide ambient
label, as noted, has started to put out *serious* junglistic stuff),
as well as a smattering from elsewhere (Mike Commander Mindfuck Kandel
up there in Heaven in the San Juan Islands, Jon Bishop from San Diego
and others like the Rezonate crew in Atherton (?!?!) are putting out
well worthwhile tracks).  As I mentioned recently, my Seattle friend
Masa's new one is causing major waves, even though he released it 
himself somehow it ended up in DJ Magazine's hands and got a very
positive review from Mr. C, who aside from his jokey Shamen rapmeister
facade is a very serious and innovative musicians (both for the Shamen
and as boss of the Plink Plonk label).  And there are quite a few more
I haven't mentioned.  So it's a bit unfair of me to paint everything
musical right now as bleak, our own region is a very hot spot at the
moment and it shows no signs of cooling.  

As for DJs and skills, it's part determination, part luck, part pure
musical genius and part determination (again).  I'm impressed over and
over again by how long it takes to really learn the ropes of DJing.
I've been rattling the train tracks for over two years now and it's
just starting to make serious sense to me.  Charlotte tells me she's
been spinning for six years, Spun for eight, Ernie Munson for 15.
Pierre, Frankie Knuckles, Junior Vasquez, Carl Cox, Laurent Guarnier,
Francois Kevorkian, Josh Wink, all the "name" DJs you can think of
(other than Tracy Lords of course :) :) have at least five and as much
as 20 years of serious every-day-do-it-hard experience learning, doing,
and doing it again and again.  

I knew the moment I got into the SF scene in late 1991 that some of our
DJs were going to get national reputations and perhaps beyond.  It takes
a very long time.  It's not always a desirable thing -- ask Dubtribe, who
toured the country hard three times and came back worn down.  I really
cheer when a friend like Carlos *finally* starts playing out of town and,
you know what, they LOVE him on the east coast because he really is damn
good.  Won't knock yer eyes out like Pierre, maybe, but he WILL knock
yer eyes out.  It's hard to see the effect when you've seen Carlos scratch
techno tracks like nobody else in the world, probably, and you have seen
him do it for years without giving it much of a thought.  I think people
get the same thrill watching that for the first time as I did with an
east coast DJ who's basically unknown out here but has my total respect
as a DJ and remixer, Frankie Feliciano, one of the unsung heros of NY
house.  When he played at Mark Ameba
s Friday night Brothers and Sisters a few months ago at 1015 Folsom, 
I was utterly amazed by his style, so opposite that of Carlos.  I mean,
Frankie just put the record down, spun it a few seconds to sync it up,
waited for his mix point, dropped it in and let it go.  That totally
low-key no-tricks approach totally suited his style, which was based on
a thoroughly well-selected set.  A sheer pleasure.  Carlos and many
others in the SF scene have or soon will have the ability to please
a crowd with their style as well as their selection, and then maybe
a few years from now we'll talk about them the same as with Pierre
and the other "names" who truly deserve their reputation.

Well, I can see I'm ranting again myself.  I think all DJs are fundamentally
DJ sluts (thus the name of the magazine Jockey Slut :), just like musicians
do we check out the style, the presentation, the selection that the other
DJs are doing and we always, always, always learn something from it.

So when John Lee sez, "Check out Louie Vega!" I know exactly what he means.
He dropped the bomb the way Stacey Pullen and Anthony Shakir and Derrick
May dropped it in Detroit last month, and they weren't headliners, just
playing their sets amid many other well known DJs.

 What! Butthole Surfers doing "rave" music!?! Great! 

 Can anyone do a short review of recent "Jack Officers" releases? When/what
was their most recent release?

Well this responce just makes me sad.  I don't think it's inherently (sp)
wrong to eat meat or dairy.  It's the way this kind of food is harvested
now-a-days.  If you raise betsy with love and milk her yourself then there
is probably not much harm done in drinking the milk, and if you kill her for
her meat (although I couldn't do it) that's probably not that bad either.
There is no love or respect for the life of the animals that are killed in
todays "factories".  I am not trying to change your beliefs, but I'm sure
you would agree that it is important to be aware of the actions you take.

	Yeah, of course I'll agree that the ethical practices of many
businesses (both large and small) are wrong, but in this society, as
consumers we have the choice to support or boycott businesses that we 
like or dislike (because of privatization, there's more than one choice).
If we dislike Reebok, then we can buy another brand instead.  But, because
I also believe, like you, that the free market economy should not dictate
morals, then we shouldn't judge the purchasing decisions of other citizens.
It seems like I'm in the minority here, though, so don't take my word for
it! :)  I'm probably snappy because it's midterms week... yuck

See you,
Timothy

Thanks, phred,

I can't tell you how much I appreciate intelligent, informed discussion of
music and DJs like this post. These types of posts (as well as descriptions
of peep's personal experiences at parties) are the reason I was attracted
to this list in the first place and continue to hang out and wade through
alot of off-topic mailbox-stuffing to get to the goodies. Much props to
everyone on the list that takes the time and effort to share their musical
knowledge and insight with us.

Thanks for the education!!!

peace,
ek

Just last night on the "Real World IV." Yes I am a habitual 
watcher...They went to Africa and basically had the same feelings we did 
about all this...except they actually got a look at the indigenous people 
and having to kill animals right there in front of you and then shoving 
on the fire for dinner...etc  Interesting stuff...
just to link this with something I experience:
	when I have shroomed in the past I always get these primitive 
thoughts in my head about how I should move to the wilderness and live 
off the land, and I ponder how the world and my life would be way back 
when everybody had to live off the land...anybody else get these thoughts?

You are absolutely correct about your post as well as the privitization 
thread. They do not belong here. Please, please don't take this the wrong 
way. I am not saying that your points or valid or invalid(although I 
disagree with a few, which I will be happy to go into in PRIVATE e-mail.) 
Certain threads start out as being peripherally related to raving, and digress 
further away from being related to SF-Raves in any way, shape or form. 
When this happens we all end up with political manifestos and flame-wars 
filling our mail boxes. Trust me, I know, I have been involved in more 
than one. When you see a thread that you have started digressing, would 
you consider asking the participants to move it to private e-mail? There 
are a lot of very intelligent people on here, with a lot of good ideas 
that need discussing. The art is finding when these subjects are better 
discussed privately. For a refresher, I have included a portion of the 
welcome messages everyone receives when subscribing:


	Appropriate topics include: announcements of upcoming events;
reviews of previous shows/DJ's/new records, etc; discussion about
SF-related and rave- culture-related topics, like smart drinks;
discussion about rave-related stories on TV/in the newspaper, etc.
Ideally we should try and stay away from, "Hey, did you catch that
Orbital song on "Beverly Hills 90210" last week?"  stuff, or from
over-generalizing ourselves: "Can Depeche Mode be considered "techno"?
", etc. But, other than that, I want it to be pretty free form. The
list should _not_ be about rave scenes in other parts of the world; an
occasional post about a huge megaevent in LA or a monthly report on
the scene in other cities might be okay, but remember there was a
reason this is called SFRaves; if you want to start a mailing list for
your area, ask your sysadmin, as that was all I had to do. If that
fails, there's alt.raves, the USENET newsgroup, where you can post
just about anything you want.

Here's a belated post on the Texas TV program:

Though I didn't see the program, I do know how anyone could get such a 
misguided perception about our scene.  

At almost every rave I have been to including FnF, Basics, and others I have 
witnessed drug use.  However I think people focus on this too 
much...drugs are used everywhere.  I can also say I have witnessed drug 
use at SF Giants and 49ers games, almost every concert I have ever been 
to including Pearl Jam on Saturday (which by the way was killer!) and 
elsewhere.  Anybody just walking into our scene for the first time is 
going to see this first before they really see our community and immediately 
start to form opinions about our drug use and our scene as a whole. they 
can't get past this part of our scene to see the wonderful and friendly 
people.

Double Ditto, soory SF, but after being here a year, East Coast Club Kids

and if you ever saw her dance ya know what I mean. I can tell just by
looking at people dancing, if I see that East Coast sytle, I'll walk up
and I'll ask are you or have you spent some time on the East coast scene
and 90% of the time they will say yes. But please don't look for that 
sytle in the way I dance, you wouldn't find it, cause I can't seem to do 
steps or don't have the patience or effort for it. But you do look great 
out there when you do it, it's just so cool looking that it makes you get 
up and try.

Tripple Ditto, in one year in Gainesville, FL. @ a club called Simions;
yes Gainesville, I saw Peirre, Keoki, The Hardkisses, Detroit, New York,
German, French, English, Japanese...etc spin. Are we either that cheap,
ignorant, fearful, or just SF sho-ven-ists. 

	Please don't take offense I'm just tring to bring to your
awareness, that we are not da shit. Most people know me, and know just how
much I love this town, and that my love is based on much more than just a
great scene. A city the size of, with the pull & draw that SF has, a
wonderful city that I know it is, should be a leader rather than just a
passive participent. It seems like we are just content to not be in a
world mix(with the exception & ocassional visit from God(Goa Gill)), but
rather Techno isolationsit, with our input entering from the street level
rather than from the top down, or what i would consider optimal, an equal
mix of both.

Of course and all things being consider, that this is just my subjective
opinion, which is based on my experience over the years, and is not by any
means the way it is, or the word of God.

Not when I'm shrooming >%^)

But- I have relatives that farm for a living, and I've spent a little bit
of time at Zendik Farm in TX (a small tribe that supports themselves 
through farming and propaganda sales).

The Zendik's aren't particularly high-tech about their farming; they don't
greenhouse or solar-cone their own veggies and still get power off the grid.
Even considering this, though, I wouldn't describe them as overworked: 
having more than Dad and his two sons working means it's a lot easier to deal
with the billion little things that have to be done on a farm.  Of course,
they don't have a lot of spare cash, so there aren't a lot of consumer goods,
but the quality of life seems pretty good if free time and sociability is
more important than having tons of stuff.

I figure that if you have a bit more money to start and some hardcore people
you can be more self-sufficient and do less work -- wind/water power, solar-
cone year-round gardening, and super-efficient dwellings come to mind.  All
you have to find is some people willing to commit with you, which is the 
really hard part.  I mean, it's bad enough finding housemates that you don't
want to kill.

Of course, when I think of living off the land, I think of hunting and 
gathering.  Unfortunately, there are way too many humans covering the earth
for this to be practical anywhere that isn't totally unpleasant (the 
Amazonian rain forest, for instance).  The modern equivalent is technomadism,
where you can either do your job from anyplace or find a job anywhere.
Somehow, tho, typing on a laptop isn't as cool, and leaves unsolved the
problem of connection to the land.

list.--Colin

		Tribal Funk
				November 8, 1995

Dear Family Members:
	Thank you to all of you who came out to Nothin' But Love. It was
an amazing night of music and dance. The house exploded with DJ Dan and Donald
Glaude on four turntables. But the people made it really special. So many
smiles! Thank you again.
	With summer behind us, we are getting things together to celebrate
Tribal Funk's Second Birthday on November 25th, 1995. DJ's for the evening
will be Utopia, DJ Dan, Tony, DJ Trance, Jeno, and Garth. Visuals will be
provided by Hyperdellic and Synergy. Hollywood Dog will be there with the
laser show. Mark Wayne (E.A.R. Sound System) will provide the sound system.
This party will be $15 before midnight, so please arrive early to make this
a special night.
	For location information please call (415) 905-4476 or (408) 291-3243.
	As we approach our birthday, we've looked back a little on where
we've gone. In the summer of 1993 the scene was a little bleak in San Francisco.
Because too many parties didn't deliver what they promised and the friendly
vibe seemed to be harder to find we wanted to try throwing a party ourselves
and see if we couldn't do better. Ever since then we've tried hard to throw
the best parties we possibly could.
	Now the scen in San Francisco is booming. Nearly all the parties
deliver what they advertise on their flyers. The friendly faces are out in
force every weekend now, too. Now we want to continue the process we tried
to start at Nothin' But Love: It is our goal to create a magical evening
where people arrive as strangers and leave as friends.
	We are putting all our energy into creating the best production 
possible, but we need you to bring an open heart and an open mind. Only you
can make love happen.

			Keep Smiling!

There was only one release, called "Digital Dump," which came out in 89 or
so. Not really dance music per se, but quirky, BH'er-esque experiments in a
synth studio. Fucked up Drum loops, samples, and keyboard bits. Not for
amateurs or simple-groove fans. It is only Gibby and Jeff at the controls, I
believe.

eh


p.s. More electro, please.

Anyone read the article in Mix Mag about Holland, raves, and drug use?  I
picked it up the other day.  They are against having a "War on Drugs" over
there.  They prefer other methods, one of which allows drug testing centers.
Users, and dealers can have there E tested to make shure how much is in it,
and it isn't something else.  
One group set up a booth at a rave out there, and several of the pills
tested were other things like speed.....Some officers showed up at the rave,
and visited the booth.  They were very much in support of the testing.
It is unfortunate such testing would be illegal here, but I wont get into
those politics.  I do recommend that those interested read the article.

My computer tells me that on Sat, 4 Nov 1995, eric shared:

> eh

	I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the spirit of Eric's sarcasm 
here, it seems to imply that negative media portrayals of our scene are 
OK, but I think he does touch on an important issue.  If we try to 
dissociate ourselves from drug use at parties, we will look like the 
worst kind of pretenders to anyone with the least bit of familiarity with 
our scene.
	When we try to play down the importance of drugs to the rave scene, 
we buy into the media's premise, and that of mainstream society, that all 
use of illegal drugs is bad.  This is bullshit.  Legal drugs like alcohol 
and tobacco are more harmful than illegal drugs like pot and exstasy, and 
if we won't stand up and tell the truth about this, who will?
	While the music and even more importantly the vibe at raves may be 
most important to those of us who go to the parties, its fair to say that 
in general this will not be the case of the media.  When the media comes, 
they will tend to pay a disproportionate amount of attention to drugs and 
sex.  Instead of trying to fight them, which is futile in the long run, 
let's use the media spotlight to educate the public on the positive 
aspects of sexuality and mind-altering substances.
	We need to make the distinction here between drug use and drug 
abuse.  To the media right now, they are the same -- any use whatsoever 
constitutes abuse, if the substance is illegal.
	Unfortunately, what's legal and illegal in this country has 
little to do with what is right and what is wrong.  Frankly, I don't care 
if what I do is legal or not, although obviously I care about getting 
busted by those who do.  I only care if what I do is right, i.e. if I am 
being a good person and respecting others -- call it a PLURal lifestyle.
	I will say this, and that is that in my nearly four years of 
going to raves, I don't recall ever seeing any elementary school age kids 
on drugs, and this is coming from someone who doesn't necessarily have a 
problem with kids that age smoking a little dope -- so run that on your 
evening newscast, KXAS.

PLURally yours,

Does anyone know where the next SRL show will be?  I know it
is scheduled for Nov 26 in San Francisco, but tickets will only be
available at the site (hinted to be next to a post office somewhere
around Potrero Hill).  If anyone hears anything &/or is interested
in attending, email me back...

I agree with this somewhat, but I think the problem I have with taking this
attitude is that raves are about more than drugs and sex, and the public is
going to get a really negative image of raves with the way things are
portrayed now.  I mean, you only see the good in a situation if you want to
see.  And if you try to show the media the good side of drugs, they're just
going to twist it around and make it look bad.  It's really not that tough.
I'm sure the rave in Texas they went to was one I would enjoy going to, but
if I saw the tv broadcast later on I might be surprised at the way it looked.

     it weren't for a little bit o' greed and moneymaking desire

Yes, 
I agree, a private sector is essential.  The only problem is when the
private sector's power gets so great that it interfere's with the publics
intrests.  Hence the massive corporate control of "our" government
(i.e.PAC'S).  In other words try to support your local small buisness when
you can.

Maybe the small business is an aspiring tyrant...

So how are you going to deal with that power? One way is to try to forcibly
deprive the big monster of some of it's functions that it has developed
without problem all this time that no one has said anything. Another way is
to decrease your need for their product, thereby eliminating the power they
have over your life, and preserving everyone else's freedom of choice.

dude.... my 1987 AT&T network terminal cost me $20 bucks from some bum in
the Mission (luckily it came w/ a 2400 baud Smartmodem). but don't confuse

The fact that your machine costs you $20 illustrates Daves' point perfectly.
If it wasn't mass produced, the boxes would never have gotten that cheap.

deregulate.  We need to promote free enterprise and capatalism.  We 
must get the goverement out of business.  Let the market run itself.  
We are a capatalist nation aren't we???  

Fuck that.  History shows that industry and business will do whatever 
they can to maximize profits.  Think of England during its Industrial 
revolution.  The number of people who died from one health problem or 
another due to lack of regulation is uncountable.  Without regulation 
business will dump waste into our water, our air, our land, and our 
bellies.  The profits are privitized to the industry and the cost of 
pollution would be commonized by the people paying with sickness and 
death.  When clean up is finally absolutely necessary we will pay once 
more for it.  

This is a form of communism disguised as capatalism.  Fortunately we 
have regulations such as the clean water act and we have the EPA (for 
what its worth).  Unfortuately we have a republican congress and may 
soon have a republican president.  This can be very bad for the concept 
of regulation.  We may not see the end of regulation but a weakening of 
it seems imminent.  

love chris

p.s. the solution to all political problems is the removal of the 
concepts of ownership and leadership.  The best goverment is no 
goverment at all.  But this means the removal of the concepts.  We as a 
species must evolve to a higher state of understanding.  Untill we stop 
competing with each other these ideals are impossible.  But a small 
group has been emerging at a rapid rate since the 1960's.  It is 
possible that the number is growing in the form of a J curve.  The

YES!  YES!    YES!
i see this growing number of people at a higher level of consciousness in 
everyday life. like an exponential curve, at a critical point the forces 
of revolution and evolution will usher us into an era w/o the need for 
government. that day is upon us soon.an exponential curve shifts fast in 
teh other direction after that critical point.
but ive mentioned this in countless posts before, if anyone wants to 
continue, email me personally, unless you feel it needs to be reitirated 
here. either way, im open for discussion.

   Stompy and Vision are the big players this weekend. I made the rounds
   last night and found a groovy scene at Cafe Mars (cosmic lounge),
   nice jazzy stuff in a loungy atmosphere. Roots was going strong with
   the Black Diamond upstairs; upstairs featured some weird funky toons
   and Emma spun a great set as the evening's guest star.
   
   Thanks to everyone who's been sending updates and positive feedback.
   See you next week!

     All this talk reminds me of a Mr. Terrence McKenna's theory about the
coming profound change in the universe.  I won't go into it deeply, but the
increase of novel things has been growing at an exponential rate, and what I
beleive is at the heart of it is the new ideas that are being expressed by
the growing number of people being talked about.  If you want to check out
Terrence McKenna's theory of the Eschaton (the point where the amount of
novelty is the highest, where a great intergalactic change happens) can be
found at his web site... the URL is http://www.levity.com/eschaton/.  It's
very informative... you should all check it out.

Just wanted to say hi all.




Hi All.


Wow, this list is getting to some deep political issues (ie veggiesm, Big
Brother, Sister, Cousin shoving ciggarettes down our kids throats et al.).

And I hope this isn't just random drivel, but, inspires someone to do
something for the good (or bad, depending on perception)
for us all...



My .02 cents....

I'm a dj from Utrecht, Holland and I heard that some recordshops in the U.S. still have old Metroplexes, 
Transmats, KMS's, Trax's etcetera. IS THIS TRUE? If so, would anyone be interested in checking the shops 
for me and sending them over here (I'll pay of course)?
I'm especially looking for:
- 'the groove that won't stop' by Kevin Saunderson
- 'acid trax' by Phuture
- 'the sound' by Reese & Santonio
- 'when we used to play' by Blake Baxter
- 'no UFO's' by Model 500

Thanx.

Bart.


By the way, I met Blake Baxter at Orlando Voorns studio (Baruka, Format, Ghetto Brothers, Complex....) and I 
must admit he's a pretty cool guy.

In a free market there are multiple service providers, and you have these 
choices.  When government, through taxation and regulation, eliminates 
competition, it eliminates choices, and you could find yourself eating at 
McDonalds because the mom & pop restaurant owners had to shut down when 
they couldn't afford to keep paying their property taxes.  In countries 
that have followed the route of economic freedom, the standard of living 
has gone up, and you're unlikely to find anyone making as little as $2.00 
a day.  

Please, question our dollar-driven society all you want, just don't 
continue to play the money-grabbing game by voting for higher taxes and 
more government.  This won't make anyone less greedy, quite the contrary, 
because there will be less wealth to go around, and it will be harder to 
get by.

It may very well be, but I think the point was that it will continue to be a
mess unless people try to change it.  A lot of things in the universe don't
happen spontaneously; they require some sort of conscious effort first.

Indeed it's true, at least for Transmat, Metroplex, and Underground
Resistance. KMS isn't around anymore and those may be harder to track down.
For the Detroit stuff, call Submerge @ +1 313 963-1025 and talk to Bridget
or Lenny or try Recod Time at +1 810 775-1550 and talk to Mike Huckaby or
Brian Gillespie, or try Seventh City distribution at +1 313 963-4737.

For the Trax stuff, which seems to always be floating around (at least the
Phuture stuff) I'd try Gramophone in Chicago, which I don't have a number
for. Try Chicago information at +1 312 555-1212

Hey kids!

Can anyone offer me information on the Prebirth party tonight.  I know it's
$15, and somewhere in the central Bay area (?!) in a "40,000 sq. ft. brand
new space" but what I'm more interested in knowing is if anyone has had
positive or negative experiences in participating in Full Circle
Productions' events.

I would greatly appreciate any feedback given that I don't lean toward
large events (or pay $15) but a friend wants to go.

I'll take my answers off line (that is, privately).

Thanks, and have a great weekend!

Tone

P.S.  Please be careful with GHB people.  It's sooooo easy to fuck-up with
that shit I hear (and have seen).

Boy, talk about laissez faire capitalism!  Fact is there are very few
choices in a so-called "free market".  In a capitalist system, especizally
our, the so-called choices are at the expense of someone somewhere, who had
to make something for us to consume because the alternative would've been
starvation.

Please get real, and don't try to oversimplify what is really going on
here:  a money/power grab by the very rich, which controls those who are
not part of that clique and the world as a whole suffers.  Note that you
said the standard of living increases.  I would suggest doing some
research.  Wherever our form of money creation (usually done thru the IMF),
we have created wider gaps between the poor and rich in said countries.  We
have also allowed dictatorships to flourish in said countries.  People
really have few choices in the countries that manufacture our goods, and
due to the fact labor is cheap many jobs are exported to said countries
putting OUR citizens out of work.

Just the facts sir, just the facts.

What does this have to do with parties/dance culture/raves?  I dunno, I
just thought I'd throw my considerable opinion in ;) (chuckles!).

Let's face it, if Sri Lanka were to throw $3 or even $1 raves, would you
go?  I think that's the real question here!

Much laughter and peace,
John

	Non sequiter. Just because the gap increases (which I beleive
is true) does not mean that the standard of living does not
increase. (I believe that the stnadard of living has increased.. for

	I'd rather have people outside the US be exploited than people
in the US. Granted, it's selfish, but I live in the US, and I want the
people living near me to not be exploitied. If most of the
exploitation happens outside the US, then that's better than it
happening in the US.

O.K., I imagine that anyone in the know is saying that someone else will
get back to him, but no one has and time is running out.  Again, does
anyone know of this production group Full Circle Productions?  I can't
believe that not even a supporter of them hasn't said, "Yeah, these guys
rock, go to it."  Not one response!?  Crap!  I hate going to unknown
parties and paying $15 without knowing a little bit about the party.  Can
you appreciate my solicitation for help here?

Thanks!

Tony


Original Message follows:

Hey kids!

Can anyone offer me information on the Prebirth party tonight.  I know it's
$15, and somewhere in the central Bay area (?!) in a "40,000 sq. ft. brand
new space" but what I'm more interested in knowing is if anyone has had
positive or negative experiences in participating in Full Circle
Productions' events.

I would greatly appreciate any feedback given that I don't lean toward
large events (or pay $15) but a friend wants to go.

I'll take my answers off line (that is, privately).

Thanks, and have a great weekend!

Tone

P.S.  Please be careful with GHB people.  It's sooooo easy to fuck-up with
that shit I hear (and have seen).

Pretty sad state humanity is at these days if these are the only two
choices.  Wouldn't you say? Fact is, when you create such a disparity there
will always be someone skimming off the top, usually doing the least.
Thats why at first you see great economic proseptiy followed by massive
shrinkages.  There is only one class that fluctuates in the positive during
this time, the very rich.  Everyone else is expanding (as in a rising
poverty level, like we have here), or a shrinking of the middle class (the
phenom of the 80's, lotsa folx made $$$, but plenty went belly up).

This is all econmoics mumbo jumbo.  I vote to take this non-rave related
stuff off the list.

please....

If at any time between now and WWII you bought something, or caused taxes
to be generated by commerce, you gave the funding (taxes) to a
country/regime whatever that has funded dictatorships, funded death squads,
and other nicities.  Of course, if you've never done any business in the US
at all this wouldn't apply.

In other words "It's ok to have 20% of our children starving as long as we
can get cheap goods."  Exploiting anyone comes back to bite you in the ass
where it hurts, and its bite is directed at the people least capable of
defending themselves.  The alternative you failed to mention is creating
another paradigm, so that nobody suffers.  Fairness, equity, & respect.  We
shouldn't allow people to exploit others, especially for profit.

Hi everyone-
I am making an attempt to rid our list of that pesky  "privatization hard at
work" thread. It's not that I don't have anything else to say on the subject,
or that someone has shut me up with an irrefutable argument! I always have
plenty to say! :-)

This is after all, sfraves not sfspewingpoliticaldiscussions. If the people
who are interested in this discussion would care to e-mail me, (at
Msphink@aol.com, for now) I could compile a list of all us krazy
revolutionary types who would like to over throw the government (oops, just
kidding if the FBI is reading) and we could just argue amongst ourselves. I
hope I will meet all of you at a rave some day, I would like to give everyone
a *big* hug for encouraging me to think and to grow as a person. I am not
some "don't worry, be happy" kinda gal. And hey, you can still be a happy
little raver while kicking some knowledge around! 

For the record, I don't think that I or anyone else has been claiming
corporations are "evil" or the private sector is "bad." Just examining what
their role is in our lives and how we would change that, if indeed it is

Well, I've never had much too much fun at any party put on in an
armory.  But who knows?  Go with low expectations, and tell us all
about it when you get back. :)

Hello everyone-
Another un-rave related message. Ooops.
I heard somewhere(?) that the FOX network is putting Michael Moore's TV
Nation back on the air. Does anyone know if it has happened yet, and if so,
when is it on?

Actually, I think these political threads are a good way to rid our fine
list of the FBI, since their eyes are probably glazing over with boredom
(as are mine) as their mailboxes spill over with spew after political spew.
Not that we all don't have worthwile political opinions, but, please folks,
there ARE forums specifically for that stuff (that won't end up in my
mailbo)x.

Hello everyone,
	I would like to talk a little bit about how I think that things 
can be more fun! Of course you have noticed that almost every flyer you 
see for a rave has some combination of the same 8 DJ's on it. And every once 
in a while 
you can go and catch acts like Banco de gaia(Yeah!!) at some venue or 
other...howcome there are never DJ's or "bands "that play at raves or 
parties? It seems to me that a party that costs 20 bucks should be able 
to afford to fly in a DJ...to make the scene more global..more dynamic 
and interesting musical styles...

-Hierophant

Ps. in response to the DIY comments...I have some experience with small 
(max1500 people) parties and would be happy to talk logistics privately.

Hey everyone,

More deep shit, but I couldn't find the above newsgroup, so you'll have to
hear me out.  ;)

After reading the 13 moon stuff Ameba was handing out a while back, I
stumbled across a book by Jose Arguelles (the 13 moon guy) called "The Mayan
Factor - Path Beyond Technology". 

Lots of cool stuff on the Maya, but I've been particularly moved by the
following passage:

Pg. 54  

        "But resonance - what is it? Everybody talks about it -
electricians, physicists, musicians and healers. But what is resonance,
*really*? Resonance means the quality of sounding again. To resonate is to
reverberate. Reverberation implies give and take, the definition of
communication which is always simultaneous and between at last two agents.
Any communication implies an exchange of information. People talk about the
"information age", but what is information? From the perspective of resonant
harmonics, information is the form-vehicle of qualities of energy passing
between two agents or parties. As a sounding again, resonance *is* information."

        "The essence of information, then, is not its content, but its
resonance. This is why feeling or sensing things is so important. To sense
the resonance of incoming information co-creates a resonant field. If we try
to conceptualize experience before we have actually resonated with the
experience, the field is off or even broken. If the field is broken, it
means the Kuxan Suum (the galactic life threads or fibers which connect both
the individual and the planet, through the sun, to the galactic core) is
obscured at the solar plexus - in a word, we've stopped feeling things and
our own resonance has been damped!"

        "When people speak of resonance, they also speak of frequencies and
tones. Frequency refers to rate of vibration. As everybody knows, there are
higher and lower rates of vibration, while all vibration is pulsation of
waves. A frequency held for but a single wave cylce, otherwise known as a
beat, becomes a tone. A tone then, is any sustained frequency, whose level
determines which of our sense organs may be affected. In other words, touch
has its tones, perfume is a tome of the sense field 'smell'; even 'mind'
experiences its high frequency sensory tones."

        "Inclusive of all the sense-fields, harmony is the sychroinization
of two or more tones. The skill in sychronizing tones and synthesizing sense
fields is an art as much as it is a science. The practice of science yields
opportunites unthought of from a materialistic perspective, which, for
instance, leads one to think that flying is the air-borne passage of a
physical body between two points. But what is flying to the sense-fields of
the passenger in the airplane? The coarse, vibratory shudder of jet engines,
the odor of jet fuel, and a microwave meal. What if flying is, instead, a
capacity to identify conciousness with resonance and ride the frequencies of
different levels of reality?" 


Eh?

I had to read it a couple of times myself. Basially, the Maya were so keyed
in that they could astrally (sp?) project themselves to various realities,
even connecting with the resonance of the glactic core! 

If your on the same frequency with the galactic core, then...perpetual
balance and understanding? 

I've found that certain vibrations with our music (whatever genre you
prefer) can create resonances (or is it the other way around? I get
confused) that allow gateways to different realities. These realities help
gain perspective as to "our true nature".  

Combine the Mayan mind with Josh's vegan diet and you have.....

Blast off! Galactic Core or Bust!

Then again, I could just be crazy, but I'm finding more and more that crazy
is a nice place to be.

Don't know if Ameba still has 13 moon stuff, but I'm sure they can tell you
more if your interested.

later...

Jonas

It's too bad that we can't get access to a Lisp Machine or an
Amiga/Toaster or a NeXT, or a Beta VCR (or in a few years, an SGI
workstation) because they've been competed out of the industry by other
companies. In other words, yeah, you may have this wonderful piece of
technology that you and everybody else can now use for cheap, but is
your Pentium box running Windows 95 that you were "forced" to buy going
to help you do your job better, when what you really wanted was a
macintosh? Freedom implies choice -- where are our choices?

Over and over again, we see a situation where the "winners" weren't
really technically better or anything, just better funded, more
popular, better advertised, or more politically expedient, or just
plain lucky ... We talk about competition being good because it winnows
out the weak and sickly ... There's too many instances where
competition has killed viable (or even potentially superior)
alternatives, giving the public little or no choice in the goods they
are to purchase. Some competition is good, but the kind of
monopoly-oriented competition we have nowadays ensures that the
consumer loses, the cottage industry loses, and that the powerful
survive regardless of whether they are the source of any "greater
good". You can talk social darwinism and survival of the fittest all
you want, but realize that what is happening isn't survival of the
fittest, just like when pollution causes algae to bloom abundantly in
the ocean (red tide) killing all the fish -- it doesn't mean that
"algae" is better than "fish" just that something primitive, stupid and
ubiquitous consumed all the resources that would allow the fish to
survive.

Typically "competition" is not a system of giving choice to the
consumer because the winning corporate game plan is to stifle any
competition before the consumer is allowed to make a choice in the
first place. To me this is just more dead fish, but some think this is
a way of life...

Every time I enter the hallowed halls of biz-ness, the prevailing
attitude is "it's not good enough that we succeed, but we must also
ensure everybody else's failure as well". When you hear the mantra-like
repetition of terms like "market domination", "thrust", "vertical
insertion" etc, it becomes pretty clear that the human need to commit
murder, rape, mayhem, and warfare has been sanitized behind gentler
non-warlike terms like profit, domination, mortgages, loans, mergers,
acquisitions, bankrupcy and foreclosures (usually in that order)...

So I wonder how people can talk about PLUR and all that crap and still
believe that the so called "free market", dominator system we have now
has anything to do with a PLUR-like outlook. Just because war, hate,
discord, and disrespect (the forces of anti-PLUR) have been civilized
behind a respectable facade of business and "competition" doesn't mean
that it's right...

--------------------

PS: Actually, the reason why we can afford computers today is through
nationally funded programs (aka socialism in a way) that allowed a few
folks to take the long view towards where we needed to go
technologically, taking on projects that "pure business" would have
declined due to lack of immediate return on investment. Although often
these programs are typically  combination of private and public sector
operations, they can be seen as "incubators" of new ideas that would
have been stillborn had they been forced to compete in a purely free
market.

You see, US business is too fixated on reaping guaranteed short-term
profits in the 6-12 month range and would never have invested money in
something as outlandish as research on integrated circuits fabrication
in the mid 60's... fact is you can indirectly thank the US GOVERNMENT 
(particularly ARPA and NASA) for helping put that Pentium box on your
desk, and that easy to use internet connection, and your web browser,
etc. Private industry joined in for the profits once they realized that
it was a safe and sure bet, because US industry is fundamentally
conservative and anti-innovation.

If you don't believe me. Take a look at what happens to the stock of  a
private corporation when it annouces that it is cutting back it's R&D
operations -- the stock goes up! ANd when a company annouces it is
starting up an R&D organization or beginning research in some new and
unproven field -- the stock goes down! The public wants it's investment
back in 6 months, not 5 years, and business plans and innovation is
shaped accordingly.

I'm clueless, but why not ask?  It's a gorgeous weekend and seems

Apologies if this has been overly discussed recently- I don't have a whole

What's the scoop on this GHB stuff that's been making the rounds? Does
anyone have any good information on this substance?

Does anyone have any pointers to online info on this?

Hey! You can also thank the U.S. Government for conducting all of that
wonderful LSD research they did in the 1950's. Now we know it's safe for
everyone else...
Evidently they were hoping they could invade another country by dosing the
water supply with LSD. Then the enemy would be so confused, or perhaps they
wouldn't care they were being invaded.
They did some tests on U.S. soldiers and discovered you couldn't march in
formation while tripping, at least not without laughing. 
I read the book "LSD and the American Dream" which was really good, but I
forget who the author was.

>  What! Butthole Surfers doing "rave" music!?! Great! 
---------------

Also, Paul Leary (butthole's guitar player) produced the two most recent
Meat Puppets albums, "too high to die" and "no joke", and plays some guitar
on the most recent (no joke).

Even more bizarre, (not that Paul producing them is bizarre), the current
Meat Puppets single "scum" was remixed by none other than Vapor Space.  I
heard some of it over the phone, so couldn't get a good listen.  Because the
pups are friends of mine, and because I've been egging them on for years
to do any kind of dance oriented music (they've been happy to comply off
the record, but nothing was ever released) and because before this nothing
has ever made it to vinyl (they're not exactly known as a dance floor act),
I would dearly love to get my hands on 2 12" singles of "scum" by
Meat Puppets/Vapor Space, so if any of you ever see it, would you be so
kind as to snatch up 2 copies?   I hereby swear that I'll buy them
from you immediately (well, I'm not easily extorted, but I'm assuming
none of you would be so unkind!).  I've looked around at a couple places,
without any luck, but I would really love to get a copy of that track
even if it sucks, although from what I heard on the phone, it was pretty
SF sounding house/etc., and sounded pretty decent.  Anyway, the comment
about the butthole surfers reminded me of yet another bizarre house
intersection...

Sure. I guess alt.drugs/sfraves isn't the place to discuss this, unless I
talk about the drugs they feed em'. Sorry for posting something out of
love NOT out of intolerance. Why don't we switch to one of the usual xtc
threads now & pretend everything is just great. And please no more of
those interesting threads like "privitization". 
--------------

Josh, I would like to take this moment to thank you, deeply, honestly and
from the bottom of my heart for discussing these issues.  I urge you to
resist those who attempt to silence you; no, it wouldn't be right to have
all discussion on the list center around politics, but to avoid it as was
suggested is cultural suicide.  Unfortunately, remaining uninvolved and
uninterested in these issues is exactly what has brought us to this sad
state we were discussing.  Only thinking and speaking about it will lead
us to a solution that will last for generations; I honestly believe without
fundamental change we have only a few generations left.  So if people aren't
interested, let them delete, but don't let them shut your mouth, you are
engaged in necessary, responsible and in the long run, rave-related
behavior; I don't want to attempt to blindly dance upon a burnt out cinder,
and although that's obviously a dramatic exaggeration (we hope), you
get my point!

"I want to get down, I want to party hearty,
 I want to get down, with the defunkt!"

I couldn't disagree more.  Politics is inherently related to raving and
ravers will suffer the consequences of being politically uninvolved.

Furthermore, I resent being asked to hide this discussion which would
prevent people who might want to get involved from having the chance.

What I would prefer would be to change the subject line so that those who
don't want to hear/read/etc. about these subjects can easily delete or
filter out these messages.  When you start trying to dictate what is
or isn't appropriate (yes, I've read the "sfraves manifesto" many times),
I believe you have overstepped your bounds as obviously enough people
were interested that the volume of messages on these subjects was fairly
high.

I have heard the same tired argument from the Zippies. 

The one thing that is always been great about the scene is that it 
welcomed people from all different backgrounds, political spectrums, 
and lifestyles. There was no "agenda." This is all, sadly, changing. 
There is an accepted mindset forming. As this mutates, it drives away the 
people that were originally drawn to it because of the lack of 
requirements to be accepted.

So now "ravers" have a political agenda. So, what, we now vote a 
party line? Someone tells us what to vote for because it is the "ravey" 
thing to do? If I don't, am I out of the club?

Look, there is no conspiracy to silence you. Hell, I wasn't even talking 
to you, so I don't know where you have anything to resent.

Sometimes I wonder why I put so much time into certain posts, like the 
one you are replying about. It's obvious that you payed little attention to 
it. If you had , you would have seen that I had asked that when people see 
that their posts are digressing from being related to the purpose of this 
mailing list, that they take it to private e-mail. I did not ask that no 
one ever post anything not directly rave-related. 

People want to get involved politically, that's cool. Try ba.politics. 
That is what it is there for. Throw your ideas up against a proportionate 
amount of people that are of differing opinions. Otherwise all you have 
is a big circle jerk, and your arguments crumble under serious oppostion.

I am not trying to dictate anything. I am just asking that others follow 
the stated intent of this mailing list, as I try to. 

Failing all else, putting "not rave related" or something would at least 
be a gesture.

Yeah, imagine that, posting the stated intent of the mailing list. How 
tired of me. 

I'm tired. Tired of people that have probably been on the Internet for a 
week, and don't have clue one about ettiqute. They don't understand the 
concept of USENET, and the intended scope of mailing lists. See, there is 
thing called USENET, which is composed of thousands upon thousands of 
newsgroups. Oddly enough, the newsgroups are named after the subject to 
be discussed. Even more odd, people actually expect you to talk about 
things relevant to the subject of the newsgroup, as stated in the FAQ or 
the description of the newsgroup. People talking about unrelated subjects are 
considered RUDE. Extrapolate for mailing lists. 

In the final analysis, there are only two things that matter to me:

1) The people

2) The music

Fuck politics.... I just wanna dance...

Obviously you don't know how to use your newsreader. I did not post the

Oh, you got me! I posted an off-sub message! I guess you didn't get the 
point of my post to you, which was that when you saw a THREAD going 
off-sub, you take it to private e-mail. Wanna flame me public-style? Go 
ahead. I'll live.

Given the current climate here, I am at a crossroads. I am trying to decide 
if I even wish to consider myself a "raver," whatever that means, or if I 
am better off alone with my thoughts. 

So I pose these questions to ALL OF YOU:

What is the definiton of a "raver?"

What does "raving" mean to you, in your life?

Hello everybody,
	Boy arent these flame wars fun...I wish you guys could do it 
privately!
	phew, i just finished writing this, it turned out longer than I 
expected, and I still feel like I need to write a book to fully explore 
this idea...but at least these unfinished ideas can be seeds to explore 
further thought...enjoy!

	Anyway...you may remember my post about a month ago when I first 
introduced myself to everyone here. At the end I started rambling about 
my ideas on emergent culture and such, and one of the main problems I was 
experiencing were actually finding signs of this in our society. Because 
it is so easy to merge your perception of reality with your expectations 
of reality. The objective world to me is in serious question. At least in 
respect to ever being able to truly understand what is going on around 
you. But that is almost off to another topic altogether. 
	After my last post on this idea I took a few weeks toi think it 
over and my working conclusion has been that there is not enough evidence 
to really notice if something new is happening or if it is just the same 
ol sh*t in a different package. It is hard evidence that I am looking for 
here, not idealistic wishes and wants and dreams...this all is very 
related to the recent string on capitalism on this mailing list. it is 
true that many people are jilted and bitter about the society that we 
live in. And it is true that many people see the problems as well as the 
benefits and the progress that mankind has made in our history. But I 
feel that it is possible (once again I am looking for evidence) that we 
are reaching a critical junction in the evolution of humankind.
	As far as I can see from my bubble of reality I have these 
evidence of the positive global trends. The internet, global communication, 
expanding awareness.
	Expanding understanding worldwide of cultures.
	 In speaking with a friend he talked to me 
about platos maybe aristotles(I think) progression of the soul. The first 
step is the love of flesh, raw animal attraction, then comes love for the 
soul, and finally comes love for beauty itself in its pure form. I 
skipped a few steps as a result of my poor memory but...you get the idea. 

What my insight has been is to look at the evolution of how culture 
expresses itself as a result of the type of music we listen to as a 
popular culture. It is these songs I take to be signs of where we are 
at as a culture and as a way to communicate our feelings and relate to 
eachother on a large scale. Take a look at the progression of 
music in the last 50 years or so in the western culture at least.
	At first we had songs like "rock around the clock". These types 
of songs are very base and talk about very little that is of the human 
experience.  In terms of Platos progression, this level of the 
progression of the collective soul is very young. Unable to talk about or 
express anything deep or about what is going on inside of the soul.
	Over a little bit of time however, more and more songs evolved and the 
next stage I see evolving is the love song stage. This level I see as the 
first step to get into the collective soul. Those ideas that we can all 
relate to, that the song can be played at the supermarket or whatever and 
almost every person can relate. At the same time, this level is not very 
risky in the sense that to express love or these types of feelings is the 
least scary in terms of opening yourself to another human beeing.
	The sixties comes a time of rebellion and rebirth of ideas about 
how things are to be done. Bringing to mind another relevant analogy of 
growht to maturity of a human being.
	And now in popular culture we can see songs like green day 
talking about paranoia, I m a loser baby etc. What strikes me is that it 
is the first time that it is okay now to talk and sing and express to the 
world that you have faults, you are human. And to talk to the popular 
culture about the darker sides of being human.
	I see the rave culture as the last or pre last stage, at least an 
idea of what the last stage of growth and maturity may be like, if we 
make it there as a culture intact. My criticism of the rave culture as it 
stands is that so many people are using drugs to experience the love 
of beauty for itself ideology.
		What worries me is that my writing still seems to have 
this ideological coloring to it, fitting what I see to what I want to 
see. But, alas...as John Searle says "this doesnt mean you give up...get 
to work!" (ha ha hi dave!)

The real problem is with curfews, 18+ parties, permits for peacful
gatherings, police harassment, I could go on.  Due to teh LACK of political
involvment (something I said we needed years ago BTW), ravers are stuck
with the same venues, no/few 18+ venues, and consistent police harassment.
Sorry Blckadder, lack of political involvment , especially here is SF,
means certain detah.  SF means politics.  I see no reason why serious
political debate cannot be held on SFR's.  And if it drives theapolitical
away, one can only wonder WHY people moved to the most political city in
the world in the first place.

I do agree that after a while it tends to lose it's focus (witness the
privatization thread), but I think they still have relevancy to the group
IMO.

The mailing lsit is about communication.  What I find disturbing is the
"Rave religion" nonesnese that makes this list such a bore.  If you're not
hyping SF, if you're not hyping PLUR, if you're not hyping parties, both
directly and specifically, then it is only a matter of time before someone
comes out of the woodwork to announce "Hey, isn't this off-topic, where are
the parties?, Where are the good vibes?".

Whatever, I think there's room for all interests.  Ifinite Diversity in
Infinite Combinations.  Yeah, all for 19.95 too!

Why not the list?  I guess if it ain't about rave religion, or rave
philosphy it out of place.  And yet we stil hear the calls of pople talking
about police harassment, parties getting shut down, people being
mistreated, etc.  In SF, you cannot sepearte politics from anything.
Sorry, just the way it is (Hell, when you have the most apolitical people
IMO , Bike MEssengers, send a message to the city each last friday of the

I think the goals are vague enough as to allow many types of threads.

Hmmm. many would suggest finding a different place to dance!  SF is
politics, for us, the politics of dance.

I don't consider my self a raver.  I do consider myself part of the "dance
culture".  That which lives for the rhythm and the beat.  Music is my drug
of happiness.


Peace,
John

P.S.  I still despise the term raver, it's like calling someone a Negro
(for black), or Indian (for Native American).  To me it's a term that has
outlived its usefulness. New paradigms must be created, and have been
created that make that term nostalgic if anything IMO.

all in all this was an excellent thingie. There were lots of people, but 
lots of space for everyone.  A laser or two, some film loops and yes, the 
whistles!

musically it was all there for me.  fast slow funky spacey housey all 
over the place.  Anyone ever notice this phenomena:  DJ has the energy at 
a high level, people are goin' off, and then brings the level down a few 
notches to let people recoop.  But lots of times I'm not ready to come 
down.  Ever been there?  

Well last night it was exactly the opposite.  Level is high... people are 
digging in, and then it just continues... and continues... and WHEW this 
walrus has JUST GOT TO STOP lest I lose a lung!

	Just because algae isn't 'better' doesn't mean it isn't more
'fit'.  Survival of the fittest does seem to hold true, but fittest
does not mean 'best.' ms-windows does well not because it is good, but
all the factors which make it do well lead to the fact that is ends up
being the fittest, and thus does well.

	All your points make good sense, and I think my quarrel with
this point is mostly semantics.

	My question: why do you need to assign a label to yourself?
The only label I 'really' assign myself, is "sameer".  (I may at times
say 'i am an sfraver', or 'i am a cypherpunk', but that is merely an
abbreviation of the longer form 'i go to raves in sf and i'm subbed to
the e-list' or 'i do stuff to promote the use of cryptography to
protect privacy')

raving is a movement, a way of life, something within that comes to 
life, it has more to do with you and your outlook than any particular
scene.

the intent of this mailing list is subjective, and i shudder to think i
could not reach out to anyone about anything, as this is more of a 
community of concerned and caring people, than anything else.

I realized that I made a very important omission in my comments about 
politics not belonging here. There points you raise above are most valid. 
They affect our ability to do what we do(dance) and do have a place being 
discussed IMO. What I was referring to was the privatization thread, which 
started out being related, and digressed further and further away from 
anything relevant. I apologize for not giving the context in which I was 
referring to political discussions.

Well, people want to get indignant about something that wasn't even

Agreed, conditionally. I don't think that you have to be hyping all of 
the above to be considered "on-topic." Some people (me too sometimes) 
have an inflammatory way of saying some things, which doesn't translate 
too well over the ether. There is definitely room for discussions where 
you aren't required to have a shit-eating grin on your face to participate.
All I have been asking that it is somehow relevant to S.F. raving.

Then what is the point of a regionalized mailing group? Does this mean I 
can start up a conversation on why I think UNIX is a better OS than DOS, 
or how to replace the clutch cable on my car? Where do we draw the line John?

Whatever you do, please speak in the singular. You, as me, are only one 
person and do not constitute an "us" by yourself. 

If nothing else, I hope I cleared up my views on the place of politics 
here. And the only thing I have been asking all this time is when people 
see their threads losing focus, they invite the participants into private 
discussions. 

Thanks John.

You're on the dance floor at a party called Infinite Diversity.  The 
person in front of you is very drunk and keeps banging into you.  You step 
back and someone grabs your shoulder and shakes it, his jaw twitching
uncontrollably as he shouts "Hey man, d'ya know where I can score some
crystal?"  You are about to answer him but the person behind you starts to
blare a whistle into your ear. You try to move away but the shirtless drunk 
turns with his arms raised and thrusts a sopping hairy armpit into your face.
face.  "WOO!  WOO!" he screams while jumping up and down.  You look over to 
one of the projection screens to see the image of a flower fade into that 
of a human vivisection.  "Cool, man." say a bunch of sullen cyberpunks all
dressed in black.  They go back to talking among themselves and you decide
that maybe you should just focus on dancing.  But then the music abruptly 
changes from techno to slow reggae and someone blows smoke in your face.
A few feet away a little kid is pounding out a loud percussion solo on a
drum kit, completely out of time with the music.  You move closer to have
a look but there are a lot of people standing around a group of circle
dancers so you can't get through.  The music changes again, this time to
some kind of thrash metal song  and a mosh pit starts to form.  A 
firecracker goes off by your head, and a boot comes crushing down on your
sneakered foot.  Before you can say "ouch" a skinhead screams "Out of the
way, faggot!"  None of this bothers you.  As an openminded raver, you are 
very happy to be in the middle of such diversity.

Subject: Re: emergent culture...?
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com

I'm afraid this is hopelessly long too, but here are some thoughts...

As I see it, the search for objective truth is what the dominant paradigm
is all about and has been for 400 years.  It's this way of being in the
world which has lead to the problems with exploitation talked about in that
downer 'privatization' thread.  I'd like to suggest that the emerging
culture, as I find it in raves and the internet (two aspects of the
emerging culture with which I am familiar), embodies a recognition that
such a search is mere folly, that what we really have is an indefinite
number of perspectives on the world and that the primary grounding for any
of them is to be found in the experiences of those who hold them and the
communities they form.

I believe the closest we can come to 'objective truth' is some sort of
intersubjective agreement, perhaps bolstered by apparent convergence from
various ways of knowing, such as religion, the sciences and other forms of
culture.  There are those (i.e. Franscisco Varela, Fritzof Capra, and the
Dalai Lama) who see convergence between paradigms in Western science and
Eastern contemplative traditions.  I don't know if they're right, but if
they are this indicates that through either meditation or scientific
exploration we arrive at the same 'truths' which is interesting at the very
least.  (I use truth here in a subjective, or at best intersubjective sense
of the word.)

Perhaps there are a number of emerging cultures, it seems to me to be this
way.  I find the rave culture growing and finding its voice, but even
within this culture there are differences and not everyone is in it for
peace, love & joy.  There are plenty of parties thrown by people who simply
want to make money like any other promoter.  Perhaps then (to use
simplifying but I think appropriate imagery) our culture is fragmenting,
and what the emerging 'culture' is resembles a fractal, with ever-changing,
ever more complex structure which moves us farther and farther away from a
single, unified objective truth yet closer and closer to our own diverse,
personal truths.  Which is not to say that there is nothing which connects
us, for as each of us finds our own path and truly lives life fully and
openly we all share the experience of human being, from childhood to old
age, and these experiences bind us together.

Maybe, if these speculations are close to correct, the variety of choices
will empower each of us to select a way of being in the world which is
fullfilling to us.  And as more and more people choose to be part of
sub-cultures which are nurturing and fullfillling (or at least I hope this
is how it turns out), these sub-cultures will grow and flourish.

I think we each have the power to change the dominant culture by the way we
engage others.  If we refuse to be part of the exploitation and continue to
send each other 'virtual flowers' and share sunsets and smiles with
like-minded souls, then as we make our way through the rest of our days we
can share our smiles and sunshine with others we encounter, brightening
their days and maybe even causing chain reactions.  Its like the butterfly
flapping its wings in Tokyo and causing it to rain in New York, and the
power we have to effect changes like this puts an immense responsibility on
each of us to be in the right frame of mind and to always treat others with
respect, compassion and joy.  It isn't always easy (at least for me),
especially when the person you're dealing with shows a complete lack of
respect etc., but it helps me just knowing that there are others struggling
along with me, and that our numbers are growing...

Namaste

if you want positive truth about the emerging culture without making it 
something more due to our want to perscieve it a certain way..
i cant then speak for anyone but myself,
i have changed, become more aware, and feel teh love between people, and 
do my best to spread the positive energy.
perhaps thats proof enough.
as for teh others, i see massive change, but as you say our want to see 
something may color our view, i wont go into it.

First, thanks for the reply!  I understand where you're coming from now,
and I also see why you said what you said (redundant? maybe).

No, I'll continue to speak as I please.  I KNOW there are others like
myself who are aware of the political implications of dance, that's why I
used 'we' in the first place.  There are others who have been actively
involved in petitioning, and demonstrating to show that dance culture is as
valid as any other.  So the 'we' was quite appropriate. Let's not get
bogged down in smeatics, it's a zero-sum game (besides, I always win
anyway, right? ;) ) (sarcasm alert!).

I think I speak for myself and others when I say there is a political
purpose to dance, if not overt, then certainly sublime.

You comments however are refreshing and welcome my friend!

I also think the past series of threads have been most enlightening.  Yes,
it's true, dance culture is greater than the sum of its parts!

Peace, much peace,
John

actually, i think a different analogy is in order.  imo, the label "raver" 
is more analagous to "mod", "goth", "punk", or all the other musically 
defined identities which i associate with a certain time in life, namely 
jr. high and high school.  this is when folks seek a unified "identity", 
and are compelled to latch on to either a musical scene or a particular group.  
this isn't inherently bad, but it denies a lot of our partial identities,
as well as makes us less tolerant of others with whom we may share these 
partial and unfixed identities.  this sort of identification is useful, 
perhaps for some even necessary at the time, but this should be thought of as 
a stage in our process of maturing and learning to get along.  racial/ethnic 
labels (eg. "negro", "oriental", etc) are of a different nature because they 
involve a process of naming w/in a context of differential and "unjust" power 
relations, wherein the party in power is privaleged with the power to 
name (maim, claim, etc.).  look, we as contemporary human beings are a lot of 
things.  those of us, for example, who have trouble learning should not be 
labeled "a retard" because human beings are much more than their intelligence.
this "retard" (btw, fuck damon wayans for for doing "handi-man") may be a 
kind person, a lover of...etc.  let us not limit people by minimizing 
and objectifying them.  truth is relational, so the answer to the question 
"am i a raver?" will be contingent upon who's doing the asking, and how they 
are doing it, and whether you even call these events "raves".  personally, i 
feel that i have to describe these parties as "rave-like" to get the point 
across to certain individuals who might think i like dancing drunk and 
chanting "whoomp there it is!" if i simply tell them i like to go out and 
dance.  on the other hand, simply saying "rave-like" will bring a lot of 
unnecessary knee-jerk associations.  don't rely on soundbytes.  take the 
time.

This was soo friggin' funny!  I don't know whther to take it seriously or,
as one of the more rare jewels of Lee's sarcasm!  Excellent!

My solution to the above, would of course be: Punch the skinner/aggroass in
the face, get my homeys around to intimidate his ass out of the venue, then
encourage the DJ to go balls out bollocks wit' the mix!  The other minor
annoyances are just part of dance culture, and should be treated as such.
The "Out of the way faggot!"  will NEVER be tolerated in my presence.  No
time, or room for hateful people at a party.  Sorry, even *I* have limits
:) !

Much peace tho !,

	Black Adder posed the question, 'what's your definition of 
	a raver?' earlier, and I think I might have found a clue as
	to what the answer is.  The word raver is a noun derived
	from a verb, which means the definition will come from that
	verb--so a raver is "one who raves."  Painfully simple--
	maybe too simple--but I think there's a lesson tucked
	underneath the grammar.  If you go to raves, then you *are*
        a raver. You can't escape this, you can't really deny it,
	so rather than trying to shed the label, embrace it!
	So wear it on your lapel with as many other labels as you
	can fit--be a raver, a student, a writer, a friend, a teacher,
	a mystic, a hacker, an artist, a runner, and as many other
	things as you can--be everything! 
	   
	[at this point Timothy has a semi-psychic moment as he runs to
	 his cd collection, rifles through the albums excitedly,
         and hopes he can find the perfect quote which has just jumped
	 to the front of his memory...yessss! and here it is: ]

	"Come on you raver, you seer of visions, come on you painter,
	 you piper, you prisoner, and shine!"    
						-Pink Floyd's R. Waters

	See all you guys at Gateway next week,
	Timothy

This is what I've come up with, though.  The world is a very subjective
place, and sometimes (in fact, I'd say most times), what you want to see
affects your actions, which does bring about positive change.  I mean, what
is the truth of any situation?  What you see probably won't be exactly what
I see.  To be more concrete, think about a situation in your life where the
result of your positive thought on it affected the situation positively.
Isn't this a "colored view" of the situation?  Sure, but it helps good
things to happen.  

Rambling in the face of a 10-page research paper :(,
Jake

This is in response to BlackAdders' question,:

"What is a raver?"

>From my standpoint:

The word "Raver" is indeed a label.  And as much as everyone dislikes labels
they will alwys continue.  If the term Raver were to disappear and say a new
term (example: Ranter, PLURbody or something) were to surface then yes, the
term raver falls in the category of "black" for afro american, "indian" for
native american et al... It becomes slang, and slang is always outdated and
updated.

However, Raver (to me) is also a stamp of a subcultural (and possibly
counter-cultural) facet of our society. And to accept the Label of raver is
to accept positive and negative connotations to it.  Ravers can be called
ones who "are members and particapents of dancing @ underground parties". But
it is also known that raver may (or may not) partake of illegal substances as
well as get into general mischief (ie. trespassing, loitering, noise
pollution ect.).  Ravers are also known to be very sincere & outgoing to
other ravers. This is the concept of PLUR. To the outsider of this subculture
this concept could be percieved like the "free love" antics not unlike the
hippie communes of the sixties. 
Another good point someone stated to me is that ravers "feel" the music not
just listen to it. Catching the vibe and communing with the music to gain
higher states of being...

As I stated in my letter to KLAX that our society, in it's competitiveness
(sp?) cannot understand these concepts.  And what society dosen't understand,
it condems.  So "Raver" is a negative term.  Not many people like to be
associated with negativity so we call raves: events, gatherings, massives
ect...

Yet, our generation witnessed the gay pride revoution and the term gay has
come into acceptance by a portion of the society at large. There are still
negative terms and lables homosexuals which I believe we all know (so I need
not list them here) and gay was one of them.  The homosexual community has
changed the term gay so it is accepted in public.

I hope the same rings true to the term Raver.  I am a raver.  I accept the
poitive and negative connotations to it as well.  I tell people that I rave,
and introduce people to the scene by my ways.  Granted I get ome really weird
reactions from my assertions of my lifestyle, from suprise to disgust:

"you rave?  Wow I thought that went out like in 92 or something"

I am proud of who I am and what I stand for...


(And I like dancing like a frenzied mongoose too)

Spins,
Adam

I guess I have several things to say;

Firstly, I appreciate Lee's story... It is a beautiful example
of what I consider to be a "raver."  Although the term raver is very
much like one of those classifications we latch onto to feel a part of
something, like mods, punks, whatever...  for me personally the term
meant something entirely unbounded, unlike what these other group
names meant to me when I was learning the names of things.  I saw
being a raver meaning an eternal search for freedom, finding the will
to be free of all the diversity which so often threatens our ego,
realizing that it is through this same threatening diversity that
we find our life and all the beauty that surrounds us.  I think that
this is an idea that I cannot outgrow, lest I give up on the concept itself.
People will always enter your life and not understand your words, but
when you find the strength to keep using your words and say them back
to these people with a smile, you begin to really fully understand their
and your meaning.  

Two years ago or so I remember a big switch from calling the dance underground
raves to calling them parties.  Raves have all the stigmatism and 
misunderstood meanings, I was told.  I remember being given a flyer
that said in big bold letters, "I am a raver and proud."  That's when
I decided that people will call these things whatever the hell they want,
I will call them raves.  I will call myself a raver and realize that
the meaning behind these words is chaos and change itself.
In the end, I'm the only one who really has to understand.
In a like manner, when I started to really listen to funky music
and realized it's power it was called house music.  One day, I started
hearing people talk about techno music, and I thought, that's funny,
it's just house music.  I realize there are certain differences, but
again, for me personally, all those differences lie in a spectrum
of house music... that's what I first heard, and that word is the word
I choose for this music's meaning.

and of course, this all relates to the Vision, and the need to have
undeterring faith in your vision.  These words are part of my vision,
and I will not change them or my vision will crumble.  Truth requires
a solid meaning and a neverending patience...  and it cannot help but
to come.  
Vision was a great party.  Just as it was 3 years ago when I was
in a airplane hangar with 5000 people, dancing like hell, realizing
what the word raver meant at another Vision, way back when.  
neverending patience... and I will continue to dance at Visions until
my bones break and I realize that my dancing had little to do with those
weary bones in the first place.

Which brings me to the last subject, the year 2012.
History will end when we realize that through the strength of our will
and vision we create reality.  Nonlinear time is just a state of mind
where meaning can see through fear itself, and true freedom is obtained.
"He's stark raving mad, I tell you."  Well, in your eyes.  In his eyes,
he is free.  and that freedom is the road to nonlinearity.  And for those
unconstrained modes of consciousness, the worlds and times of infinite
diversity are the playground of will, the heaven for the unified soul.
This is the form I seek with my definition of being a raver.
I am a raver and proud.
I am alive and free.

hola!  while we're on the subject of politics and parties...

SFPD Chief Ribera is scheduled to be announcing the names of the officers 
who will be disciplined for actions in the New Years Eve Raid this 
Wednesday at the Police Commission meeting.  so far, he's been quite 
evasive...he quoted to the press in sept. that he'd be sending 6 officers 
to the commission based on the OCC (office of citizens complaints) 
report; now he "doesn't know how many yet"/won't tell.  in addition, it 
has been, oh, ab out 11 MONTHS since the raid and the SFPDand Police 
Commision have yet to take action....

so... ACtion for Police Accountability is encouraging anyone who can to 
be at this weds' Police Comm. meeting at 850 Bryant, 4th Floor (or is it 
5th?), 5:30 on.  it ain't gonna be exciting, but it'll be a chance to (a) 
make public comments, (b) watch pseudo democracy in action! and (c) put 
pressure on the Commission by our very presence and interest.

ALSO, we (APA, people from the New Years Eve Raid, anyone else whose 
interested) are going to be organizing a demonstration/hopefully a boom 
box party(!) for Wednesday, Nov. 29, around 4:30 or 5:00 (more info 
later) outside the Southern Police Station (850 Bryant).  i'd like this 
to be a "party on the steps of the police station cuz they're crackin' 
down everywhere else" kind of thang, demanding that the officers in the 
raid be punished, etc.  the meeting to organize the demo will be monday, 
nov. 20 at 50 Fell Street, Room 110,f rom 7-9pm.  

i am looking into borrowing a radio transmitter so we can have some 
musick there, but if anyone has one please let me know.  (i thought about 
a sound system (!) but the steps of the cop shop seems a little too risky 
(sigh - maybe another time.)

please let me know if you're interested but can't make the meeting.  
will post more info when i have it.  

take care,
monicat

p.s. if you want any more info about the new years raid or anything, 
please email me.

When Martin was taking a straw poll as to the wisdom of doing Vision at the
Sound Factory I told him it wouldn't work - too many Sound Factory regulars
would gum up the vibe.

Fortunately I was wrong.

More people there than I've ever seen at the Sound Factory and the asshole
quotient, while not as low as at most undegrounds, wasn't bad at all.

I got there while Ethan was rocking large in the back room - more than one
person commented on the F&F type vibe in there as opposed to the clubbier
vibe in the main room. Dutch followed Ethan and was a bit aggressive for
me, so I checked out Tony in the main room. He blew away many of my friends
- I thought he was good, but not as spectacular as I've heard him before.
Josh followed in the main room with some serious SF style house and Garth
followed him, switching from the other room to fill in for an absent Paul
Johnson, who missed his flight.

Returning to the back room (via an interlude in the coat check area; _the_
place to chill and hang out at the SF), I found Galen about to go on, and
spent the next three hours (time I'd planned to spend napping) grooving to
the best set I've heard from him since some of the '94 Sunsets. Seriously
chunky acid house.

I heard Jeno ripped it up in the main room - he's rumored to have even
dropped a breakbeat. He did not, however, smile. Jon Howard finished up the
party (which still had a least 400 people at 7am) and was playing some nice
house when I left.

Overall a great party - a true rave.

Joe

12 days later, but typing fast...  Sorry to further prolong this thread,
but I'd like to hear other SFR's musical tastes.  To me, it gives a deeper
depth to everyone and I find it fascinating to see the changes in tastes
that have brought them to our particular community.  Of course as I type

I'm glad you enjoyed it, sounds like it would have been worth checking out. It's 
just to Bad they wanted to charge $20 to get in when it was 2:30-3:00am, And 
they wouldn't negotiate the price. At that time in the morning, you would think 
they would cut you a break if there was 4 or 5 in a group.

Maybe it's more important to consider yourself as who you are. You hold the 
key to being just what ever it is you wish to call yourself- That's the best 
thing about this- it truly is YOU! If this scene (whatever it's called now) 
can't allow you to be you, then why even bother- 

Among the artistic hierarchy, birds are probably the greatest musicians to 
inhabit our planet.

I don't consider my self a raver.  I do consider myself part of the "dance
culture".  That which lives for the rhythm and the beat.  Music is my drug
of happiness.


Peace,
John

P.S.  I still despise the term raver, it's like calling someone a Negro
(for black), or Indian (for Native American).  To me it's a term that has
outlived its usefulness. New paradigms must be created, and have been
created that make that term nostalgic if anything IMO.

I planned to go to Vision, but I had a few problems with it:

First, the *rediculous* price ($20) was not on any flyer and even the night
of the party was not on the info line. You had to go to the map point on
Townsend or to the Sound Factory to find out how much the night's fleecing
would be. Of course, if you're afraid to put the party cost on your info
line, you're probably already aware that you're screwing your party goers.

Also, the simple notion that it was at the Sound Factory had me doubting. I
don't really go there if possible to avoid the crowd that calls that place
home.

Once there, the security guard gautlet at the side entrance to the Sound
Factory was an instant vibe-killer.

And at the box office, the fact that a group of 5 of us showed up at 2:45am
and they insisted that we all pay $20 each was, in my opinion, not in the
'spirit' of and party I could have fun at.

   The message was clear: The number one interest of this promoter
                          was getting our cash. Thanks, Rodger.

So, we went with the rule that any party that costs $20, even at 3am is
most likely not worth it. Not even the rock stars at Wicked charge more
than $15 for their parties, and that's about the high end of what many will
pay for a bunch of home town SF DJ's who tend to play the same old sets
over and over.

No offense to Ethan or Galen (who area some of my favorites and was the
reason I wanted to go), but most of the other DJ's billed are, at this
point, in my opinion, way too overexposed here in SF. For instance, I have
to actually go out of my way to find a party that *doesn't* have Garth,
Jeno, or Tony playing.

Please fly in some talent from somewhere else if you expect to earn the $20
you want for a party or price your party more in line with what you are
selling.

>Firstly, I appreciate Lee's story... It is a beautiful example
>of what I consider to be a "raver."

Perhaps so, but part of what I was trying to show was how absurd it can
be to actually *be* the manifestation of such an ideal.  As long as we
exist in this reality (the shared one defined by our current physical
state) ideals such as total acceptance, PLUR, absolute freedom, etc.
will be concepts that we can strive towards, but never fully realize.

>and of course, this all relates to the Vision, and the need to have
>undeterring faith in your vision.

Why not have multiple visions?  Visions of the perfect party, an
ideal government, spiritual bliss, amazing sex, most powerful weapon,
stupidest joke... 

>These words are part of my vision,
>and I will not change them or my vision will crumble.

Why can't a vision change or grow?  Isn't it rather idealistic to
believe that we can come up with a set of perfect ideals to believe in?

>Truth requires
>a solid meaning and a neverending patience...

There are many who would say that truth is relative and non-absolute.
But even *that* cannot be absolutely true!  

I have found that embracing "Truth" requires the acceptance of
neverending doubt and uncertainty...I think :)

>Which brings me to the last subject, the year 2012.

I have to say that it kinda bums me out that history is predicted
to end after this year, since 2012 is the year I become eligible for
retirement with full pension from this fucking job!

I think there are times when we can transcend the limits of our
current reality and come very close to experiencing our ideals.  
It sometimes happens when I trance out on the dance floor. 

> This is the form I seek with my definition of being a raver.

Me, too.  At times.  But I don't expect it to be an integral part of
everyone else's world.  But perhaps our visions exist as extensions
of the reality we all share, even if unseen or unaccepted by those
who claim to "disagree".

I think the point (and we know that every point can expand into a
universe unto itself in some other dimension) is that I'd rather have
the 
	PLURAlity and VITAlity 
of a multitude of 
	FLORA and FAUNA
and a balanced eco-{logical,nomic} system rather than 
	FLOATIN' and BLOATIN'  
carcases of dead animals and memes
	DECOMPOSIN' in a sea of SLIME!

That's the point -- it's green and it floats in space quite spectacularly!

Ok, fine.. I recently purchased Dr. John's "Afterglow" because I just
like the new orleans acoustic piano stylee, jazz, and Dr. John. The
combination of modern recording techniques, production by Tommy LiPuma
(Miles Davis, Natalie Cole, Streisand ...) big-band arrangements, and
modern remakes of "late golden age jazz", meant a fine treat for these
ears that still likes the sound and expressiveness of real analogue
instruments -- drums, horns, acounstic piano, etc played through a good
natural-sounding soundsystem. 

Overall, a nice selection of "tradititional" and original numbers with
a modern twist of taste; an "homage" to tunes performed by BB King,
Charles Brown, Nat King Cole, Louis Jordan, Duke Ellington...

NP: (again!) The new Planet Dog "Quadruped V.1" compilation with
selections by "Optic Eye", "Zuvuya", "Active Loop Zone", "Children of
the Bong".

	I don't think this is the first time this has happened.  Look at 
the Velvet Underground, the Doors, Iggy Pop, David Bowie and that whole 
movement of the late 60's early 70's.  A bit different, but still on a 
similar wavelength.

Hi everyone!
This is a message of positive energy & love!
I am posting this message not in response to any one person, but in response
to the general welfare of sfraves.

Some of us have been asking ourselves "What is a raver?" I guess I would call
myself a raver; even though it is a label it serves a purpose, which is to
unite us all under the flag of RAVE. 

I would like to think that there is something out there which we have all
felt at a rave. It's not just the dancing or the music in themselves
(although these are very important elements!) What I am talking about is the
feeling of being interconnected with everyone in the room, the feeling of a
really good vibe, the feeling of love that you have at a really good party. I
would like to suggest that we try to carry over these feelings into the rest
of our lives, and especially onto this list! 

I have noticed what seems to be true of many "ravers" is that we tend to be
more tolerant of other people, since many of us have had experiences of true
love with the whole universe. This brings me to my thoughts of the political
discussions of sfraves. 

Obviously, there are some of us who would like to discuss politics, and some
who do not. Some people would like to discuss other things than just parties
and drugs. I have a suggestion for those of you who do not. You may have
noticed when you get an e-mail, there is a SUBJECT attatched to it, which
hopefully explains a little of what the e-mail is about. If it seems to be a
political message, you could always delete the damn thing instead of reading
it. You may be thinking to yourself, "Why should I put up with these type of
discussions on sfraves?" The answer to that is: Because you are a raver, you
WILL be tolerant of your fellow ravers. And if you can't do that, I suggest
you find another place where you truly belong. 

Really people, there is no need for name-calling. Telling other people that
they are *rude* or their messages are *boring* or that they don't belong on
sfraves, really serves no purpose than to divide us. I would like to think
that we could all get together at a party and actually have fun, instead of
someone thinking, "Oh, there's that asshole who posted the message I didn't
like....."

You may be thinking the answer to this dilemma is that we will never post
another message of a political nature on sfraves. Quite honestly, I don't
think that is going to happen. You can disagree with something that someone
has written, but try not to resort to hurting their feelings or making them
feel stupid. What purpose does that really serve? Can we try being NICE to
each other? Or at least civil?

This message has been brought to you by: 
Someone who cares.

That was the point of having Paul Johnson (Relief, Chicago) spin. Martin
always has an out of towner play. It's no fault of his that Paul missed his
flight.

well, yes of course... I guess the point is just that we, "the raver"
or whatever we want to call this ideal must confront all these things
in order to continue beleiving in the ideal.  There are the absurd
examples, but then other times when everything pays for itself and
we can feel some sort of growth of this ideal in ourselves.

yeah but again... The Vision is the ideal, the realization of infinite diversity. 
Within that are the truths we want to create and seek out...
visions of what we decide to be real and where to proceed from there...
This is not static, it must always evolve to keep its life,
but at the same time, no particular state of truth will come to be
with absolute faith in that particular truth, that vision.

well... your right. but the set of all ideals, that idea that every
ideal must change and grow sort'f brings the idea of growth full circle.
We can be idealistic when we respect every ideal, and of course this is just 
a philosophical truth rather than anything anyone will actually ever reach.
that doesn't mean we can't beleive in or understand it.

If you can see your own truth, your particular vision, that's enough
to make it real.  It is relative and subjective, but in the end,
you're the one who has the final say in the matter.

yep... It's the same as the Vision versus a vision, the Ideal versus
an ideal... I think we're just saying the same thing, each with our
own words.  Everyone understands truth, they just have a different 
word for it.

Well, I think that 2012 is a relative thing.  Terrance Mckenna might
realize nonlinear consciousness in it's entirety on this date... I might
not realize it until 2050.  I might die before I realize it.  I might dream
tonight of a million possible realities, and wake up tommorow
with my aching back and a full day of work ahead of me.
That's the funny thing about nonlinear reality... the beholder of the 
meaning is the only one who can see through it all.

and sometimes it happens when we first notice that flower growing
through the sidewalk in front of our house, or when we see someone
or ourself doing exactly what it is that we think should be done.

I think it happens every moment we realize that we are alive.

all in all, I think the important thing to realize is that
there is a singular componant within each one of us, life.
And it comes in a billion flavors, but every one of those
flavors must be respected to understand the infinite within us.
That is how we will continue to be alive.

anyway... 
Have a good week...

[ to SFRaves mailist ]

 If I can arrange my life properly, I'll be going to my first MAD
tonight! -

 MAD - Ethan, Alex, Jon Santos & Joe Rice & guests w/techno, trance &
 electro. at Bahia, 1600 Market @ Franklin. 10pm,18+, $1 before 11, 
 $3 after.
 
 ... as the calendar listing has it. I was wondering:

1. How late does it run ? ( until 2PM ? ).
2. Does the nearby parking have any inconvienent "street cleaning" 
   time restrictions that take effect after midnight?

 If I make it , I'll be wearing my SFR laminate , also my new 
"rave goggles" , which is a persciption pair of athletic goggles
with a red rubber housing that I bought specifically to do rave/trance
dancing and moshing with! If you see me , come up and say hello!

        Along this topic, i was thinking about relativity theory and the
spacetime continuum (not the one that makes music though ;) and came to a
realization that spacetime is a unified thing that exists everywhen and
everywhere. Our day to day 'slice' of spacetime that we percieve is often
just the same thing as a mouse eatin' its way through some Swiss Cheese and
so because we percieve different things in a linear order we think that
'time is passing' when in fact it's us that is doing the 'moving.'  I was
thinking about this last weekend at a party in Baltimore as Mixmaster
morris was playing and thought "Right 'now' there is a rave where Mixmaster
Morris is playing and always will be and always has been and i'm LOVING it
but my ontological self is being drawn to different parts of the block of
that spacetime cheese block"
        So, next time you're out at a party (or anywhere in life) and are
not having such a good time, think 'back' to a time when you were in utter
bliss because, relatively, that place/time isn't that far away.
        peace,
                brad

Hey! Don't you guys know!?

There is this book that someone had at Burning Man that explains everything.
Especially why history ends at 2012, that's when the Greys (and the 
guberment) finally get their time machine to work, once that happens, there
really isn't any future or past because that can all be modified,
(sorta like twisting the dials on a 303 :)

for more information get a hold of the book called

"Nothing in this Book is True but it is Exactly how Things Are"

throwing & in his words "a great fuckin party." Me & my German friend Ulrike 
loved it a lot, for she danced the entire night away, this old man was worn 
out much before that. 

	Special thanks, & recognition to Martin for making the price of
admission $11.00 before 11 o'clock, if you see him thank him in person
yourself, if it moves you to. I feel that when a promoter, who was been
able to deliever, & packem in, for much more a costly event, who doesn't
have to, then throws a party with special pricing should be given special
thanks. (Flame Retartent ON). This should not lessen or in anyway take
away from the love, admiration, & dedication we have for people like Ethan
Miller & Co(Friend's & Family), Claire & Co(Lite), Greg Sandler &
Co(Harmony), Ann L. & Co(New Moon), Geoff W. & Co(Full Moon), The Marin
Posse Who Do Frequency 8(Where House is Just Something You Live In), All
Da Beautiful People @ Cyberlab 7, our Cloud Factory Friends in the South
Bay, and all the others I'm being either to ignorant or to high to
remember, for these people, my friends, & yours go above & behond "THE
CAUSE", to make sure that their parties are either free, run close to
cost, or unforturately end up losing money. 

	I didn't have any doubt that the Sound Factory is and was a great
place to have a party/rave, that's what it's designed for, though thank
god Ethan brought his sound system for the back room. Ethan's set was
great, and so was John Howard's, but who was the person who came on after
Ethan? It was also great to see so many of SF's finest DJ's, like Joe Rice
& John Carel there, not spinning however; but just having a great time
dancing, and listening to their friends spin. 

	I just hope, & I know that the ravers of SF sent a message to the
Sound Factory Management, that we will support a nice club venue that
supports us, but not a rich man's disco, with milatent security. 

	Having worked some of Martin's events it's good to see that he
uses his own security people each & everytime he has an event. I met each
one of them and they all seem very nice. Keep in mind I've worked security
twice at an event, and hated having to be the heavy, it's a sucky job,
having to enforce the rules, and to be there and have to make public
decisions that are often not popular. 

	Thanks again Martin, for everything, Peace, Love, & Happy Holiday's
to you & yours = >.

Yeah, your right on.  In fact at the really good parties, (with the right
DJ and possibly enhancements :) you can experence a glimpse of Eternity.
Eternity is a point out of time, it just exist; in fact, the good parties
all lead us there.

It's the gateway to the place that Rip Van Winkle and some of his 
english predecessors found themselves in when they went to party
with old Gwen Ap Nudth (the king of the faieries) under neath Glastonbury
Tor.  Now THAT was some hardcore ravin! Go into a party, do some serious
partyin with the faiery folk (and believe me that DO know how to party!)
doze off, and wake up 20 years later!

These parties are only for the "True Ravers" however because everyone else
around you will be too old or dead, but hey, your are still 20 years younger
than everybody else so if you were'nt so dosed that you didn't forget
to pick up the flyer for the NEXT party, you could literally Rave through
out history. (or at least to the end of it at 2012 :)

Well, after reading about a few of you upset ravers out there, I have a few
comments to make.  First of all, my friends and I went to Vision, and we
thought it was truly a remarkable party.  It really shouldn't matter who the
DJ's are, as long as the music is alive, the beat is going, the vibe is
strong, and that everyone is having a good time.  Personally, we go to the
parties where the Wicked crew is at because they seem to always bring out the
togetherness, happiness, and plain old having a good time feeling in us all.
Yea, $20 is a little on the expensive side, but at least it's for a good
cause.  I can't even express how much everyone was like a family in the main
room, especially between 6:00-9:00 am.  When we all gathered hands, formed a
circle, then rushed to the middle, it was such a rush of energy.   Everyone
was all smiles (well, almost everyone), and though many were exhausted, the
music kept many dancing.  Tony, Garth, Jeno, and John Howard definitely kept
the evening alive and strong.
One of the only ways to make a party good is to go with a positive attitude.
 Don't worry about the price, don't worry about the security guards (at least
try to do any business AWAY from them), smile, hug people, DANCE, and have a
great time!

Dear All;

	The season tis almost upon us, sorry but someone had to be the 
first, Anyway, I've been communicating with many a raver, and many of us 
are going to be here in the Bay Area rather than returning home, to our 
families for all sorts of various reasons, I'm one such person.

	I have a lot of time on my hands, as many of you know :), so as 
my Christmas gift to the sfraves community I would like to offer my time 
and by internet account as the point of contact for a raver Thanksgiving & 
X-Mas away from home, Please send in your ideas, of how you would like to 
spend the holidays with your friends. The simpler the idea, the better 
chance of it happening, so that no one of us has to spend the holidays 
alone. 

	Happy Holidays & Wishes of Much Joy to you, yours & our planet
over this Holiday Season.

Good call, Brian!  I probably won't get to go anywhere for holidays
(time constraints, not money -- travel takes a while) and think
that spending time with other members of our rave family would be
really qool.  I've always thought it would be neat to do an event
that started with potluck/meat-n-tofu-barbecue, wound up as the night
happened into beats and dancing, and finished by rolling out the
cushions and beanbag chairs and switching to ambient, letting those
of us with sleep needs (so shoot me) grab some before the sun comes up.

I'd like to volunteer my house but since F&Fs have become so big I'm
not sure I want to try that!  How many others aren't going home for
the holidays?

                                  New Show

                               November 1995

A site has been secured and SRL will be staging a large scale self-produced
performance in the Bay Area sometime during Thanksgiving Weekend. This will
be SRL's "Crime Wave" show, and will revolve around the many humorous
aspects of violent human interaction. This will be the first large scale SRL
performance since the May 1994 show, A Calculated Forecast Of Ultimate Doom.
We have waited to announce this date until we were fairly certain that the
arrangements for the site location were finalized. However, exact
notification of the time of day and location will not be released until
necessary. To avoid regulatory difficulties, arrangements will be sneakier
than usual. This will also apply to how we will be notifying the public.
Expect something unusual.

Announcement of an Internet based MBONE and CU-SeeMe broadcast will be
forthcoming. Stay tuned to this site for the latest information.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

                             Current Information

                              31 October 1995

There will be no pre-sale tickets. Instead, ticketing will be handled the
day of the show at the entrance to the show site. Tickets will be $10.

The location will be more specific as the show date approaches. However,
actual show location will not be released until the day of the show. When
that occurs it will be available via this WWW site and a telephone number
that will be made public later.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                   Notice

By nature SRL shows must happen without much warning to avoid alerting
various official personal. For that reason we ask that you check back to
this site which will be the first on-line resource to announce any SRL show.
This site will provide as many specifics as allowable for each upcoming
show.

Please check back as we are closing in on several show possibilities one of
which may be in your area. For those of you non-local, live video and audio
will be broadcast onto the MBONE and to various CU-SeeMe reflector sites.

hello all-
after reading the message i am responding to, i was surprised to not yet see
numerous responses.  well, here goes-

I AGREE!  please take some responsibility for what you read and choose to
not read.  if it doesn't interest you, delete it.  that's what i choose to
do for most of the political messages.  if you like it, read it.  if you
don't like a strain that has been developing, ignore it, as i have a few
times.  i veer away from totalitarian open-mindedness, but SFRAVES is a
place that open-mindedness can truly occur.  so, to quote "someone who
cares"  "Because you are a raver, you WILL be tolerant of your fellow ravers."
that's my piece, and if you do not care to read this, feel free to delete
it, as i would rather have you delete my message and take responsibility
rather than passively reading everything that flashes across your screen-

peace, love, and a little bitterness- (but still A LOT OF LOVE!)

I was quite surprised that Vision was going to be at the Sound Factory,
but after I get there,   I find out that the venue was remodeled and
a new air conditioner was installed and it was quite cool and I was
able to find a lot of smoke free places to dance.

I stayed in the small room and danced to Ethan's entire set.   WOW!!
he WENT OFF big time.    Dutch followed with similar BPM's and continued
with the high level goa trace...   I also danced his set,   other than for
short stretch breaks.   Galen finally went on,  and quickly brought the
BPM's down a few levels (he did it in just two songs) to finish up in
the small room.

After that,  went to the big room,  and even that was tolerable temperature
wise.    I had a harder time finding a smoke free place to dance,   but
I found a few spots and continued until I had to get back to a meeting
in Mill Valley.

The big surprise was the 18+ age limit.   NO ALCOHOL and had thus contributed
to a vibe that only Martin O' Brian could pull off.

Jolly good show,  Martin...  How many others went?   Saw a lot of SFRavers
there,  so it couldn't have been THAT bad...   Way to go Ethan,  your
music really did a great job in enhancing my state of mind...  It's
about time we get the higher BPM's.

Hmm, so is the real question, "Should Black Adder call himself a raver, and
should he continue to associate himself with the sf-raves community?"

If that is the real question, then I must state emphatically "YES" as I
would be sad if he left.  Call me selfish.

RAVER - Rabid Alien Virus Eating Reality

It's common knowledge that techno comes from space aliens using the great
pyramids as psychic energy transmiters.  So far it has only taken over those
of us with weak, pliable minds, but the aliens powers are growing and soon
even the great Oral Roberts will be overcome.

> What does "raving" mean to you, in your life? 

Well, in no particular order, Black Adder, Ray Gun, Foustus, Cyr, Amy, Geoff
White, Lee Fogel, Peter Fogel, Milton, Ricki, Brian Darkness, Carol, Karen,
Kathrine, Rebecca, Mars, Myster E, REN, Theta Blip, Xris, Helena, Pilot
Girl, Peter Wolf, Kristal, Vivian, Ethan, Judge, Mike, Bryce, Greg, Cindy,
Chris, Ian, Diane, Newt King, Rok, Brian, Phred, Anthrax, Greg, Minuk,
Vince, Wayne, Jonas, and a whole bunch of others I'm not remembering because
its too late at night and my mind doesn't keep good lists.  I'd also like to
add to that list anyone I've ever shared water with, fire with, air with,
earth with, pictures with, smiles with, and hugs with.

If it weren't for raving, I would never have met most of these people, and
those I could have met, probably wouldn't be such good friends.  The first
SF Raver I ever met was Lee Fogel, and he gave me such a big hug I can still
feel it.

It's gotten progressively better since then.

I'll be sojourning in Toronto this coming weekend (11/16-19) to attend the
International Network of Lesbian and Gay Elected and Appointed Officials.
Any information about parties, raves, or whatever you want to call them
would be greatly appreciated.

Oh yeah, local weather reports would also be helpful.

Thanx and peace to all.

Not to pick nits Joe, but this is not true.  For years he has had a staple

I think email leads to action.  The history iof this list, and the 
actions of its membership is proof of this fact.  F&F is proof enough.  
People got tired of the same ol-same-ol and created thier own space, and 
own 'thing'.  All of this happened, at least in part, due to serious, 
often rabid debate.  Now F&F is all about doing, and it shows (at least 
in commentary of others, I have yet to go, but may one day).

So I never devaluate the positive effects of conversation.  I just don't 
like people who maon and groan and do nothing to alter their own reality.

Peace,
John

Check the hyperreal page on GHB, it's pretty long, there is a lot of info
here, some positive, some scary !!  Work your way down the whole thing, it
is real interesting. I think for me I'll probably stay away from GHB.

enjoy,

Vince

(happy to be alive and well) !!

I appreciate your support. I was really unhappy that the price went from
$11 to $20, even at 3am! I would have gladly paid $10-$15 for that party,
in fact, three of us went to the last Basics (which Martin is also the
promoter), we got there at 2:30am or 3:00am and all paid $15 with no
gripes. But $20 each at 3:00am for a large group, is just a bit insulting.
And knowing full well that the "star" DJ missed his flight and still
charging the full price is totally uncool.

Ok, I ment in the recent past and forseeable future, based on conversations
with Martin. He's commited to bringing at least one out of town DJ for
every party from now on. He claims to be tired of the same old shit as
well, although his lineup choices don't always seem to reflect that. I know
he's had out of town DJ's for his last 3 or 4 parties.

Hey there, all my fellow listies,

I've been pondering over the idea of going to London for the summer to live
and work.  It's something I've wanted to do for a while and I think I'll
finally have the opportunity.  What I'd like help with is my living
situation.  I guess I could search for a house over there and find someone
to sublet here, but I was hoping I could make it easier.  If anyone here
knows someone in London who might be interested in house swapping for the
summer, please let me know.  Also, is there any kind of rave list for that
area?  I thought I could pose the same question there if such a thing exists.

Thanks in advance,
Jake

Just wondering where this came from.  The world ending, not Lee's pension.

People had to find some way for the world to end without World War III, so
somebody went and figured out a way for 2012 to be it.

eh


p.s. More electro, please.

No problem there Joe,  *I* stand corrected.  Haven't talked to Martin,
mano-a-mano in quite a while.  Say hi to him at parties and all, know he's
well, but am not in on his plans, especially the most recent.  So thanks
for schooling me on the more recent history.

Just a side:
I don't like being the know-it-all-historian, and I really try to curb my
corrections, that's why I tried to let you know I wasn't being all
piss-ant-wise about the happs @ Martin's parties.  It's often a delicate
balancing act I think I've improved over time.  The one thing I hate about
the net is people who go out of their way to correct others on even the
most minor infraction.  I really despise people who dabble in the
unimportant minutae of being absolutley correct at all times.  Life's too
short to be right all the time ;)!

Much peace,
John

        Well, from what i've read, the 2012 figure is arrived at from the
Mayan Calendar, as well as Terence Mckenna's theoretical "Time Wave Zero"
fractal wave map of history (still haven't TOTALLY figured this one out
yet) plus numerous other things. I had a chance to talk to Sadie Plant, who
is a cultural theorist at Warwick U in the UK (and who's written stuff
about Parisian anarcho-artsies the "situationists" before) and she says
that SHE'S working on a book about the 2012 thing.  It seems to me that,
regardless as to whether you are mayan or smoke dmt, something BIG is going
to go down in 2012.
        Guess we'll have to wait and see! :)

        brad

ps-->i kinda wish history would end tonight so i could sleep in tomorrow
rather than go to work. :(

Like I said, get the book

	Nothing in this Book is True but it's Exactly as Things are.


It'll explain EVERYTHING, really ;}

The end of history has to do with some time travel experiments,
the Greys have done a couple on their own, and a couple with our
"government" the most notable one being the philidelphia experiment,
since these experiments create strange relativistic singularities
they are really dificult to control and to understand, at 2012
they finally get it right and can move forward and backward at will.
when you have this capability then you literraly rewrite history, but
there really isn't any "history" any more since one can go to a 
prvious time in "the present", in fact if you go back and fuck with some
thing you just spawn off another worm hole (sorta like copy-on-write,
page fault algorithms for you Operating Systems buffs #:@)


You might find this interesting

2012

1987

1962

Each of these time periods are about 25 years apart.

1962 saw the first rumbling of the "flower children" here in SF
1987 saw the Harmonic Convergence and the second "summer of love" in the 
UK (Acied!)

2012 ??? Well Liam, (Jeno's son will be 19 years old ) 

Many of you youngins will be around fourty, I will be 55 (around
will penna's age currently)


Just think, when we get this time machine thing happening, we can all go back
and relive the best parties through out history, not only that, but we can
bring our grandkids and show them that grand-pa REALLY knew how to party in
his day :)

what if there was to be a rave, like F&F, and everybody could invite 
everybody else,and those people brought friends too, and there could only 
be one place to hold such a large event,(since the tidewater location 
would get crowded) and that one great location is the planet earth....
maybe Ethan has something in the works for 2012.

     Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't Terrence McKenna get his equations

McKenna :')

Gone MAD and Got Trancy 
 
 After missing out on Vision last weekend, I felt the need for some serious 
trance-portation music. So , despite the necessity of getting in to work at
8PM Tuesday morning , I drove from Sunnyvale up to S.F. to catch Ethan and
Joe Rice and Monty at the Bahia Restaurant. I arrived there a little after 10 
PM , at the same time SFRaver and F&F video projection master Mike Clay 
was parking his truck nearby . 
 
 I've never been to this restaurant before ,but my wife has eaten there and 
gave it a positive rating. The decor is South American tropical - I think the
ethnicity of the cuisine is Brazilian. The last of the eating patrons were 
watching the arriving ravers with some curiosity - of course , the acid trance 
that Ethan was spinning probably gave them a surprise as well ; not exactly 
dinner music !
 
 A nice wooden dance floor , about 25' X 40' . It finally started filling up 
at about 11:15PM. I was glad for the increasing crowd - at the beginning,
there seemed to be a small group of guys who seemed to be showing off/
teaching their dance moves to each other ( floor spins , etc ) , and they were 
taking up a lot of floor space. The back wall is mirrored , giving a wider 
feeling to the dancing area ; it was kind of amusing to catch glimpses of these 
guys as they monitored themselves in the mirrors . 
 
 Not that I've worth watching as I'm dancing - I'm of the "stagger rythmically
and symetrically and wiggle your arms about" school of dancing when it comes
to techno/house ( or most other schools of music, come to think of it ).  
Anyway , I got to do a lot of whatever it is I do on dancefloors - it was 
great! I was only able to stay for Ethan's set and some of Monty's set , so I 
got in as much dancing as possible until my legs started to feel like logs. 
 
 I've never heard Monty spin before , but I liked what I heard . I don't 
recall seeing his name before, but that may just be me. He's a black guy about 
6'1" , maybe late twenties. I'd go to hear him again.
 
 ------------
 
MAD!
 The next time I have trance/dance withdrawal symptoms , I'll know where to
go!

PS - It was nice to meet another SFRaver in person - Rick Riffle . I'm 
     glad that I asked for his name twice - I was able to remember it!

 By the way , I finally got to try out my new "rave goggles" again - athletic 
goggles with prescription  lenses. There's a flaw with using it that can be
considered a feature under the right circumstances. The damn things fog
up a bit too easily. I've even tried to put some of that anti-fog gel on it,
but that didn't seem to help. I think it sits a bit too closely to my face.

 If I really want to see something at the other end of the room/warehouse/
field/beach , it's inconvienent. On the other hand , it does aid in 
establishing an introspective mood , and sometimes what's there to see isn't
all that interesting!

 It is a different experience dancing with them - I must have been semi-
concioussly worried about my glasses falling off all this time - I was able
to relax just that little bit more. Also , like any different pair of glasses
than what one usually wears , the field of view and perspective is somewhat
out of whack - kind of like what the world looks like when A is starting
to kick in.

 I'll have to tinker with the frame a bit , try to get more air circulating 
behind the frame.

 I glanced at the SFR calendar listing for the Wednesday night club event
called "The Velvet SHop" that happens in San Jose. Did this event move
from the club at 1984 Oakland Road to 325 S 1st St , or is the calendar
mistaken?

They've been my #1 chill group for the past year, barely
usurping Richard Kirk in the ambient/techno dept.

I order most of my CD music through Ear/Rational.  Check out
the catalog at http://www.xmission.com/~ear/  It's a one-man
operation.  Good selection, great prices, fair service.  He
carries the latest Autechre.  (And the new Kirk/Electronic Eye!).

ObSFR: So when is that Banco D'Gaia show at the Troc happening?

Stay seated folks...No he isn't.
He is only not producing the toons for print release, every day.
The books are still on the way.
Apparently he hated the day in day out rush to produce.

I picked it up on vinyl at Soundworks friday ($14.99), they had the cd as
well.  I'm sure Mod Lang and Rasputins has it now too.  If you're willing
to wait a couple of weeks you can pick it up domestic on WaxTraX/TVT. 

My first impression after a couple listens is that it's good, but not as
amazing as some others have made it out to be IMO.  It might take a while
to grow on me though... 

While we're talking about music I'd also like to add the new Mille Plateux
comp. "Electric Ladyland" and the Journey's by DJ Coldcut cd to the list
of recomendations.  Both are excellent.

I have read that the Greys removed emotion from thier species through
genetic manipulation.  Then eventually they realized they needed emotion to
evolve, or thier species will become extinct.  That's where we come in.
They need our help to understand emotion, and to integrate it back into
thier species.  So maybe emotion is a key to understanding time, and without
it, time cannot be manipulated.  True...untrue...I don't know, I just work here.

Obsfraves,

I went to "Root of Consciousness" last Saturday, or was it Friday, I don't
remember.  It was beautiful.  The space was incredible.  It was some sort of
auditorium at a youth facility I believe.  The dance floor was way cool,
kinda springy.  The visiuals were great, including lasers.  Everyone was
ultra nice.  The guys at the map point were too.  Instead of frisking you as
you walk in the door, there was a guy with a bundle of sage incense who
would wave it up and down and around your body and blow the smoke toward you
to clear your aura...to clear negative energy.  I stayed in the ambient room
most of the time, but I danced a little to Carlos, and he went off.  He
really knows how to move a crowd.  He kept changing styles of music, but it
totally flowed.  He really worked everyone.  His energy is incredible, and
he scratchs like a mad-man.  The ambient room was really nice as well.
There was a live band that played all night.  Instuments were
everywhere...they had alot of shit.  Tons-o-analogue gear.
nnnneeeeeerrrrrrroooooouuuuuwwwwwwwwrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrreeeeeeiiiiiiiiiiiiizzzzz
z.  With a cool little red laser doing neat things on the wall.  I spend 75%
of my time in there.  They had a nice padded floor using those excersize
matt, like the gymnastics dept. had in school.  Everyone was totally
sprawled out, way cool.  Then, get this, they had a healing room, with lots
of people doing various kinds of energy/body work, Reki, charkra balancing,
massage, tarot, past life regretion.  There were about 15 to 20 different
things to choose form.  I tried the charkra balancing and was completely
blown away, infact when I was finished with that, I realized that that was
the real reason why I went to the rave in the first place.  The crowd was
kinda young, but the whole rave seemed young and fresh and new.  I had a
really good time.  I would recommend going if they do something again.

     I just got out of mediation and I have a court date this Friday.  
     Things aren't 100% terrible but I feel pretty beaten up.  If you have 
     any positive energy to share, please send some my way.  I could really 
     use it instead of sniveling and having my eyes water everytime someone 
     at work asks me how I'm doing.
     
     Thanks much and I hope to send some your way when you need it too!

You know, this is quite definitely the single strangest conversation I have
ever seen pop up on SFRaves.

Just thought I'd throw that out there.

I would like to meet one, so if anyone knows one tell them that I am a 
nice guy and that it would be cool to talk to one of them.

Yeah, it really looks like bleed over from the Schwa news group.
Maybe all us SFRavers should be preparing for an abduction.
I bet they got some killer techno trance.

Dear Diane;

	What's going on hon?, sorry I'm clueless, but I care about the
people on this list cause they care about me. I don't know what's going
on, but also don't have to know the details to offer my support to YOU.
All that's important is that you hurt, that's all I need to sense. I'm
sorry that life is having it's way with you, I know all to well just how
it feels, and how spent & alone it can leave you. 

	Try and remember Diane, that we all shine, no matter what a court
might say about us, or anyone else for that matter. I often refer to human
beings as orginal works of art, masterpieces; cause like orginal art,
their wonderfully unique, with no two pieces being the same, and in a
sense, priceless; because they can't be exactly replaced. 

	Like those masterpieces their will never be another person like
you, or me, try & remember that love for yourself & humanity & keep it
close to you, always.  Everything will work out in the end, and I have no 
doubt you will always & continue to get what you need, and sometimes get 
what you want. So please accept some virtual flowers, a virtual hug, a 
virtual kiss, and an offer of my time & my telephone ear if ya care to 
talk, and also the virtual stuff until I can see you in person & give it 
to ya for real. See ya sunshine!!!!! = )

Please also except these Cowboy Junkie Lyrics as some comfort:

Taken From To Live Is To Fly; off of Black Eyed Man

Days up & down they come
lke rain on a conga drum
forget most, remember some
but don't turn none away.
Everything is not enough
nothing is too much to bear
where you been is good & gone
all you keep's the getting there.
To live is to fly low & high
so shake the dust off your wings
& the sleep out of your eyes

Were with ya Diane, and you are A STRONG CAPABLE WOMYN

Does anyone know where I can pick up an affordable PA system?  I'm throwing a 
punk show in Trac (about 1.5 hours west of SF) and am looking for an 8 channel 
PA.  I would imagine you ravers would know something about this?  I need 8 
channels for mics and to mic some the drums, etc.  Any ideas or suggestions?

I need to get out and do something, I'm all ready to go. Just won my softball
game and need to listen to some music that will take me out of here. Any
thing happening tonight some what close. Let me know. I'm up for just about
anything. Catch is I might just stay in if it get to late.

Hey, if you haven't left yet, go to 1015 Folsom.  Doc Martin is 
definitely worth going out on a Wed. nite for (though I am being a wimp 
and way too tired to go, but if I wasn't I would go to Roots.)  Garth and 
Jeno aren't too bad, either:).

Cheers,
Cami

Based on the kind of house music that I have heard in various parties
around SF, I decided that I just didn't like house music.

After hearing Doc Martin's set tonite I have hope. The music made me dance
like never before.

Maybe record selection, technique and variety *do* count.


tired & happy,

        But isn't that the whole problem? Finding "emotion" and "mind" as
two separate things in conflict? When ya look at yourself (and not
specifically you kev! :) and see that "mind" "heart" and "body" are three
manifestations of the same thing and all can act in unison, synergistically
there is no conflict and everyone's happy! :)
        brad

ps-->are aries people emotional too? just wondering.

Hello-

	Checked out Roots last night...Doc Martin tore it up for at least 
2 and a half hours...great to see such a variety of house music woven 
together with such skill.  
	Upstairs was a chill dancefloor with the warm sounds of trip-hop 
vibrating people's bones.   I struck up a conversation with a guy from 
London who had been in L.A. for two weeks, and San Francisco for only 
four days.   He said "This is a great party.  You couldn't find anything 
like this in London...and it blows the shit out of anything in L.A."   I 
tried to find the words to tell him how much fun our scene is, but words 
can only say so much.  No doubt there are great parties in London and 
L.A. as well, but it's nice to be reminded of just how lucky we are.
	Does anyone know which DJ's played when upstairs?  Thanks, -dave.

Could someone tell me what DJ was spinning around 6-6:30 a.m. at Vision? 
I didn't go, but a friend loved this DJ and wanted to know who it was.

After reading the subject heading and being on a body arts newsgroup for 
about a month, I *TOTALLY*  thought this person was talking about Prince 
Albert's.....that's how it is abbreviated.  I had to laugh when I found 
out I was wrong! hee hee! :)

Oh my god! If you like trance, trust me that this should now the #1 CD on
your 'to buy' list. And hurry -- there are only about thirty copies in the
bay area.

When I got mine from the master himself last night he told me that he put 3
to 5 copies at Freq-8, Ameba, Housewares, BPM, and Soundworks. If you want
it, I suggest you get it today before they're gone.

"Several assays can be used to detect delta(9)-THC metabolites
in urine.  Radioimmunoassay, enzyme immunoassay, thin-layer
chromatography (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) and gas chromatography/mass spectometry (GC/MS) are some
of methods used (Mayer et al, 1987).  A new test, the
TDX(R)(Abbott) Cannabinol assay utilizing florescence
polarization has been introduced in Sweeden (Karlsson and Strom,
1988).  Radioimmunoassay and enzyme immunoassay, introduced in
1981, are the most widely used screening procedures.
Enzyme-mediated immunotechnique, EMIT(R)(Syva), is the one used
by most laboratories (Mayer et al, 1987). The EMIT procedure measures the
activity of the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.  In the absence of
delta(9)-THC metabolites, the enzyme is deactivated by an
antibody and the test is negative.  If delta(9)-THC metabolites
are present, the antibody binds to them, leaving the enzyme free
to react and produce a positive test (Mayer et al, 1987).

 Because the antibody used can cross-react with other urinary
substances (Karlson and Strom, 1988).  Addition of chemicals
such as salt, vinegar, bleach, or detergent to positive-testing
urine will result in a negative result.  Supervision of urine
collection, and follow-up testing of positive samples are
necessary with EMIT.  The advantage of EMIT is it is easy to use
and inexpensive (Mayer et al, 1987). Two EMIT(R) systems are commercially
available.  The EMIT-st(R (single test) system can detect cannabinoid
metabolites at
concentrations of 200 ng/mL with greater than 95% confidence;
the minimum detection level is 100 ng/mL but at less than 95%
probability.  The EMIT-st(R) is a portable, compact system
suitable for use in physicians' offices and small laboratories.
The EMIT-dau(R) (drugs of abuse in urine) is a more extensive
system used in high volume laboratories that is capable of
detecting concentrations of 50 ng/mL at a 95% probability and
20 ng/mL about 50% of the time.  The dau system reagents are
also available with a 100 ng/mL cutoff instead of 20 ng/mL to
decrease the probability of a positive urine result due to
passive inhalation of  marijuana  (Schwartz & Hawks, 1985).  There
are no false negatives.  Three percent of all test results or 5%
of all positive results with EMIT-dau(R) were found to be false
positive (Mayer et al, 1987).  EMIT-st(R) is designed to
identify only recent and heavy  marijuana  use and is much less
sensitive than EMIT-dau(R). Pharm Chem Laboratories reported that frequent
smoking of a single high-quality  marijuana  cigarette by a casual user results
in metabolites that can be detected in the urine for 3 to 10
days using the EMIT(R) 100 ng cutoff, and more frequent use can
lead to a positive  urinalysis  for 3-4 weeks.  Very heavy chronic
smokers may have detectable concentrations for greater than 4
weeks.  The longest reported detection time is 11 weeks in a
patient (using the 20 ng/mL EMIT(R) test) after abstaining from
marijuana  smoking.  The patient had a history of smoking 7 to 10
cigarettes/day for 7 years (Sedgwick, 1985). The TDX(R) system is precise and
reliable but much slower when a  large number of samples must be run.
The reagent cost is higher for the TDX(R) (Karlsson and Strom, 1988).
Because both the TDX(R) and the EMIT  give preliminary results
only, positive results need to be confirmed by TLC (detection
limit 50 ng/mL) or HPLC (detection 25 ng/mL) or GC/MS (detects 5
to 10 ng/mL).  In the study by Mayer et al (1987), HPLC, when
used for confirmation yielded a false fortune rate of 2% due to
interference, GC/MS was 100% accurate.  These three tests are
tedious and expensive, and therefore, are not appropriate for
screening.

Preliminary testing for the presence of delta(9)-THC and its
metabolites in urine can be done with EMIT(R) cannabinoid assay,
TDX(R) cannabinoid assay, or radioimmune assay.  EMIT is fast,
easy and less expensive than TDX(R), while TDX is more precise
the results can be confirmed when necessary with TLC, HPLC or
GC/MS.  A combination of EMIT-dau(R) and GC/MS gives complete
accuracy in detection of  marijuana  abuse.  Urine testing does
not determine intoxication because urine levels are not
correlated to psychopharmacological response.  Passive
absorption of THC appears unlikely to produce positive test
results.

D.  ADULTERANT-LABORATORY INTERFERENCE
   1.  Urinary levels fluctuate from day to day.  Adulterants may cause
false-negatives (acidic or alkaline adulteration or extreme dilution of the
urine), therefore urine pH and specific gravity should also be assessed
(Schwartz & Hawks, 1985).
   2.  Ingestion of 3000 mg of ascorbic acid, 1560 mg of golden seal root, and
750 mL of cranberry juice did not interfere with EMIT testing of urine for
cannabinoids. Levels were reduced but still detectable (Schwartz & Bogema,
1988).
   3.  The addition of Visine (R) eye drops in concentrations of 20 to 100 mL
per liter of urine resulted in false negative urine assays for cannabinoids
using the EMIT and TDx assays.  This effect was more evident when glass
specimen containers were used.
    a.  Studies with various components of Visine (R) showed the benzalkonium
chloride to be primarily responsible, although the borate buffer had some
effect (Pearson et al, 1989).
   4.  False negative results were seen in cannabinoid EMIT assays with the
adulterants sodium hypochlorite, Joy (R) liquid dish detergent, and sodium
 chloride.  The amount of sodium chloride needed to produce this effect
(greater  than 50 g/L) would preclude its practical use.
    a.  When the same adulterants were tested with an RIA assay or the Abbott
TDx assay, no false negatives were seen, but false positives occurred with the
Joy (R) detergent (Warner, 1989)."

In the big room it would have been Jeno from 5-6:30 and in the back room,
it was Galen from about 4-6:30. The back room closed after Galen, and John
Howard played after Jeno in the big room.

it's in the city. It's on Friday. Then there's Kundalini on 
Saturday night.

I recommend L.G. Jason always puts on really good parties!

	Waxx and I may have our disagreements, but I think he and Josh 
are right.  I don't blame anyone for not being interested in politics or 
philosophy, but on the other hand I believe if more ravers understood how 
much these things affect our scene by determining the social climate it 
takes place in, they might take more of an interest.  Remember, in many 
countries of the world, you would not be able to throw a rave at all.  
And to the people living there, it no doubt seems normal and 
unobjectionable, because they haven't experienced what they could have 
with a little more freedom.  I think the same is true for us.  Clearly 
there is a balance to be reached, I don't want the sfraves list to be 
inundated with political stuff any more than any of you, but I do feel 
its important to look at the bigger picture.  

Yours in liberty,

possibility of perscieving through infinite numbers of chemicals, but 
then perhaps reality is just consciousness anyway, and like quantum 
physics states, nothing exists untill it is perscieved. get that. there 
were no atoms until someone found one.
but the energy of the universe is maleable into infinite set of forms, as 
many as your consciousness can have teh fancy to create or imagine. the 
bottom line, my friend, is *UNTAPPED POTENTIAL* and that is, imperically, 
our destination from the beginning.

consider the random probability of the dendancy to exist, when speaking 
of matter. and how our *expectations*, and those of teh experimenters had 
a direct influence over where these tendencies to exist would manifest. 
*our* expectations. do you understand teh implificatiopns of these results.

perhaps teh government is well aware of this, having scientists work like 
mad for truth, so they can twist it into power.
*fuck politics*
but they have given us something. like acid into the hands of ken kesey. 
OOPS! and teh 60's happen.
my friend, we have the power as well, to think, to create. although some 
forms of this are illegal. why.?
"because they're afraid that there is more to reality than they have 
confronted, that there are doors ... and they dont want us to go in  
there either, because if we do, we might learn something they dont know, 
and that makes us a little out of their control."
more smiles:) tom

You must beware of false newts.  
True newts are slow toxic amphibians with no known enemies.
There is at least one false newt about and can be identified
by the sharp tongued venomous rhetoric and by the numerous 
known enemies (feminist, liberals, environmentalist, ect...)

Slow toxic amphibians rule
(They also love hugs)

"...the power system continues only as long as *individuals* try to get

or acts as if it wants nothing from government, declares that it will 
look after its own welfare and interests, then on that day the power

	This isn't a rave or a rave-type party particularly, but my 
girlfriend is having a party at her parents' place in Danville this 
Saturday evening.  
	It is sort of for the San Francisco State University Outdoor 
Adventure Kids club.  This is a student group she started to take inner 
city kids on hikes and stuff; the party was planned as a chance for 
people to get to know each other.  Everyone is welcome though, you don't 
have to go to State or be involved with the club.
	Jaime didn't want to have a full-blown rave because of concerns 
about noise and neighbors, but I don't think she'd be opposed to someone 
spinning, especially ambient, if the volume is low.  If you're 
interested, let me know.  You won't be paid, but then you don't have to be a 
superstar DJ or anything, just have a desire to play for a crowd.
	During the day on Saturday we're having a hike on nearby Mount 
Diablo, followed by the party in the evening.
	Her folks' place is really beautiful, it looks like a castle on a 
hill.  There's a big courtyard outside, which we'll be using for the 
party, and anyone who wants to sleep over outdoors is welcome to bring a 
sleeping bag, tent, etc.
	For more info, leave a message on my voicemail at (415) 270-7887.

Cheers,

     You know, I had a real difficult time getting myself to ask for a hug 
     yesterday and I'm really glad I did.  I kinda felt like I was washing 
     my laundry in public and that showing my neediness was a weakness.  
     But I endured yesterday and the sun rises and thanks to all of your 
     warm wishes and support, I'm feeling alot better.  I'm especially 
     warmed by people who don't know me on the list but posted anyway.  It 
     showed me that to be associated with sfraves or even being a raver, 
     people KNOW the difference between showing, sharing, and feeling love. 
      
     Posting to the group and other friends helped me realize once again, 
     that we're in this world...this reality...together (and I didn't have 
     to use music and dance or even trance to get me to this point!).  
     Though my perspective is still jaded w/the court system, I have to 
     take a more Eastern approach to thinking that karma will take care of 
     things, and that my son knew what he would encounter for the first 24 
     years of his life even before coming into this world, _and_ that 
     there's a reason for everything.
     
     For those who don't know what I'm going through, it's a custody case 
     for my 9 year-old son and a restraining order for an abusive 
     ex-husband.  Problems started this Summer when my ex fell off the 
     wagon, lost his job, his apartment, became homeless, and had my son 
     sleeping in a local public park on his custody days.  I filed for 
     temporary full custody and that was upheld until we sent our son off 
     to England in August.  The mediator yesterday addressed my ex's desire 
     for full custody and berated me for not being emotionally supportive 
     enough!  So much for keeping a chin up juggling too many hats of work, 
     and all.  I guess I'm just too restrained (except for when it comes to 
     dancing :)
     
     Thanks again for all of your kind words, thoughts, and love.  I've got 
     court at 9am tomorrow and I'm gonna make the best of it.  And if I'm 
     into escapism, maybe you'll even see me out this weekend since I won't 
     have my son.
     
     Love,
     Diane

	I just posted a message on this issue, and thought of something 
else I should have included.  
	I don't know how much time the rest of you spend in front of the 
computer, but if you're like me, you try to at least skim every posting 
to sfraves.  I think that having at least a core group of people who look 
at every post is essential to having some kind of community, some kind of 
common dialogue here, and I want to be a part of this dialogue, because I 
love raves and I'm still excited by what we have going on.
	The downside of this is that unless I want my eyes to glaze over 
as I develop carpal tunnel and I start sleeping with my mouse 
(cyber-bestiality?), it doesn't leave a lot of time to read and post to 
other lists, such as ba.politics.
	So while Black Adder's advice to take the political postings to 
an appropriate group has merit, the fact is that for many of us, sfraves 
is the only list we have time to follow, and personally I consider it bad 
nettiquite to post to lists that you don't follow or don't plan to 
follow, unless it's a specific item of interest.
	If sfraves is the only list that I and others have time to truly 
follow, either we (A) post things that are only peripherally rave-related 
from time to time, or (B) there is a whole dimension of life that we 
never get to discuss with others on the net.
	I think that as a community, we benefit from having as broad a 
range of discussion and interaction as possible.  I suspect that the 
interests of members of the community will be discussed in rough 
proportion to the amount of interest in the topic, without the neccessity 
of anyone being discouraged from posting on a topic.  But use your own 
judgement.  
	If I post the minutes from Libertarian Party functions daily in 
excrutiating length and detail, clearly I deserve to be slapped silly 
with a wet noodle and placed directly in front of a speaker at an event 
DJ'd by Traci Lords.

After writing a longer than I expected reply I decided that I must warn 
you that this is not purely rave related...but have hope! there is 
information at the end that is more directly rave related!;>


Hmm,
	This reminds me of a class I am taking called mind and brain, 
nuerophysiology and computers. These are the types of issues we talk 
about. My take on this is that I want to believe the physicalist camp and 
figure out how the mind can be found from looking at the brain...what is 
the connection? 
There is some fascinating research being done with results 
that show how as brains we can only know of our world what we create. The 
quick explanation is that for the example when you breathe a smell and 
the first  place the signal goes is a "bulb" the bulb recieves 80% of its 
information from prior knowledge (the cortex) and only 20% as input from 
the world. So the intuition is to say that what you percieve as the world 
is 80% influenced by your own mind, preconceptions, etc. Which is very 
related to the idea of ever being able to understand the world purely 
objectively. For now the only things which I see as being even close to 
purely objective is mathematical constructs.
	Boy this is really a ramble! Sorry about this, rave related 
information will come at the end!

the really interesting question here is...do you have the same experience

I would have to take issue with this point here, If there were 
no consciousness to appreciate the universe, then it would probably just 
be a prettylonely place, but it would still exist... although this can 
not be proven...a fun mind experiment to play is to try to find any 
unobjectable truth which can show that anything in the world actually 
exists besides yourself. How do you KNOW that everythiung you see  and 
understand is not merely inside your imagination?
	How I feel on this issue is that there is an objective world out 
there,one that is independant of my or your existance, it is just the 
problem of being a mind that I can not see what it 
<really> is but just my interpretation of it. My model of reality is that 
from the objective world we lay down our models as words and ideas over 
the world. in some places the fit is good (like how we can predict 
planetary motion) and in other places it is a bad fit. But in all cases 
we are just lifting and creating meaning from the world.

just my personal opinion...but not every politician is evil and greedy... 
they are human beings too, and to objectify them too much is to let 
yourself become unatached from your fellow and the problems that we all 
face as a  society

Wow, now that I have rambled on... you all have a better idea of my 
personal ideology...boy this is fun! 

Now that I have said all this here is the rave related stuff!! I just 
bought the new goa gil cd an dit is awesome!! I highly recomend it!!

thats all for today folks... bye!

hello all-
i, being a psych/bio/chemistry/physics student, have some opinions on this
wonderful subject.  i shall vox them now:

i do not use the word mind.  i do not use the word soul.  i do not use the
word life.  i do not use the word death.  all of these words are no longer
in my vocabulary, after i realized the wonderfulness of physicality.

my physical being, your physical being, all physical beings, are capable of
the most wonderful actions and non-actions.  our heart heats.  our liver
converts glucogen into glucose.  our lungs breathe.  our brain interprets
and stores sensory information.  all of these are physical processes,
processes that are observable, physically, chemically, and biologically.
these processes are equal in their interdependance, our brain having it's
own function distinct from the heart and lungs, but neither more nor less
important, regardless of what our rational upbringing tells us about the
pre-eminence of cousciousness.

because these processes are observable and documentable does not make them
bad, nor does it make them less important that the "higher" processes that
we so talk about on SFRAVES.  For me, documentable physicality explains all
that i observe and experience.  it explains why i breathe and metabolize,
why i love my girlfriend, why my heart continues to beat after the drugs i
have put into my body, why i experience wonderful feelings of oneness at
raves and other gatherings, why my liver does the funny things that it does,
why i believe in one and no God, why i can feel such an intense connection
when at a rave or when reading a post SFRAVES, etc.

In Matt language, everything is explainable in terms of physical organisms,
the set of which we are all members.  I do not subscribe to a particular
spirituality that attempts to explain consciousness in terms a higher good,
higher connecting principle, collective unconsciousness, or any thing non
physical, because, for me, my body, your body, and all bodies are the
highest good just as they are.  That does not say that you shouldn't be
spiritual, for that is your language.  i just wish to put a physical
translation to the raver ethic/PLUR out there for the physically minded,
like me.

i love you all for getting to the end of this rambling post!!!!

peace, love, and rambles

matt

I used to try to read every post when this list was about Raving and 
related issues, it supposedly being "SF-Raves" and all. I don't bother 
anymore....

It is obvious that many feel that we should all feel free to continue 
long threads about  whatever the hell we want regardless of relevance. 
I sit(being that I am in my chair and all typing this) outvoted and 
sincerely hope that lack of focus doesn't turn this into what the 
greater USENET is devolving into.

	A poetry teacher of mine once told us to nurture "fruitful 
juxtaposition" in our poems.  I discovered a bit of fruitful 
juxtaposition at the Blondie's Pizza on Powell Street near Market.
	Near the counter is some lettering that says $1.89/lb.  Directly 
to the left, someone affixed a sticker with the words BEATS AND CONCIOUS 
KNOWLEDGE.  So sometimes when I go in to order a slice, I also ask for a 
couple pounds of beats and concious knowledge.  I know a good deal when I 
see one!

My computer tells me that on Sun, 12 Nov 1995, David Ginsberg shared (in

Or maybe the single, objective truth is complex, and difficult to see, so 
that in striving for a consensus on the nature of things, it becomes 
easier to accept the idea of multiple truths, even if this does not 
really make too much sense -- unless we redefine truth as meaning "personal 
perception", in which case it makes perfect sense, but leaves us with no 
common vision to aspire to.

While my personal perception of a party as being fun may actually help 
make it fun for others there if this perception is reflected in my 
behavior, unfortunately our perceptions are not always able to change 
reality in this manner, and so fall short of real, objective truth.  You 
can perceive yourself as Wile E. Coyote all you want, it's not going to 
change the fact that if your friend drops an ACME piano on you from a 5th 
floor window, you're not going to get up and walk away from it.

I think we have become so concious about valuing everyone's opinion that 
we are sometimes reluctant to say any idea is wrong, for fear that we 
will be making a value judgement on the person expressing the idea.  
Saying an idea is wrong isn't necessarily passing judgement on anyone.  
Most of us, including myself, need to work on divorcing our egos from our 
belief systems, and removing the chips from our shoulders.

My head is aching from all these deep thoughts, I better quit now.

Hey, thought everyone should at least read this. For all you AOL people out 
here. There is one part I think is kind of funny, They say this program hads 
bugs, that, if it was ran from any drive other then C:...it would delete 
itself. That doesn't sound like a bug to me, sounds like a feature. One that 
wants the hard drive and forgets the floppies disks. It also sounds like a real 
poorly made Virus, but still a virus. Anyway, just want everyone to beware, and 
always use a virus scan when D/L files online.

Tim (knucklehead)  Hope this hasn't been sent before.

       AOLGOLD Trojan Program
     
November 16, 1995 1300 PST                                          Number G-03 
_______________________________________________________________________________
     
     
PROBLEM:        A trojan program is being distributed around America
  Online and other networks called AOLGOLD.ZIP.
PLATFORM: DOS-based PCs
DAMAGE:         When the INSTALL.EXE program is executed, most files on the
  users C: drive are deleted.
SOLUTION:       See the description below 
_______________________________________________________________________________
     
VULNERABILITY   
ASSESSMENT:     Users who download the AOLGOLD.ZIP or INSTALL.EXE trojaned
  programs, unpack, and execute them may destroy files on their 
  DOS C: drive.
_______________________________________________________________________________
     
    Information on the AOLGOLD Trojan Program
     
AOLGOLD Trojan
==============
     
The AOLGOLD Trojan program was recently discovered on America Online (AOL). 
Notice about the Trojan has been circulated to all America Online 
subscribers.  Notice about the Trojan and a copy of the Trojan program were 
supplied to CIAC by Doug Bigelow, who is on the staff of America Online.
     
Apparently, an e-mail message is being circulated that contains an attached 
archive file named AOLGOLD.ZIP.  A README file that is in the archive 
describes it as a new and improved interface for the AOL online service. 
Note that there is no such program as AOLGOLD.  Also, simply reading an 
e-mail message or even downloading an included file will not do damage to 
your machine.  You must execute (or run) the downloaded file to release 
the Trojan and have it cause damage.
     
If you unzip the archive, you get two files: INSTALL.EXE and README.TXT. 
The README.TXT file again describes AOLGOLD as a new and improved interface
to the AOL online service.  The INSTALL.EXE program is a self-extracting ZIP 
archive.  When you run the install program, it extracts 18 files onto your 
hard drive:
     
MACROS.DRV
VIDEO.DRV
INSTALL.BAT
ADRIVE.RPT
SUSPEND.DRV
ANNOY.COM
MACRO.COM
SP-NET.COM
SP-WIN.COM
MEMBRINF.COM
DEVICE.COM
TEXTMAP.COM
HOST.COM
REP.COM
EMS2EXT.SYS
EMS.COM
EMS.SYS
README.TXT
     
The file list includes another README.TXT file. If you examine the new 
README.TXT file, it starts out with "Ever wanted the Powers of a Guide" and 
continues with some crude language.  The README.TXT file indicates that the 
included program is a guide program that can be used to kick other people 
off of AOL.
     
If you stop at this point and do nothing but examine the unzipped files 
with the TYPE command, your machine will not be damaged.  The following 
three files contain the Trojan program:
     
MACROS.DRV
VIDEO.DRV
INSTALL.BAT
     
The rest of the files included in the archive appear to have been grabbed 
at random to simply fill up the archive and make it look official.
     
The Trojan program is started by running the INSTALL.BAT file.  The 
INSTALL.BAT file is a simple batch file that renames the VIDEO.DRV file to 
VIRUS.BAT and then runs it.  VIDEO.DRV is an amateurish DOS batch file that 
starts deleting the contents of several critical directories on your C: 
drive, including:
     
c:\
c:\dos
c:\windows
c:\windows\system
c:\qemm
c:\stacker
c:\norton
     
It also deletes the contents of several other directories, including those 
for several online services and games, such as:
     
c:\aol20
c:\prodigy
c:\aol25
c:\mmp169
c:\cserve
c:\doom
c:\wolf3d
     
When the batch file completes, it prints a crude message on the screen and 
attempts to run a program named DoomDay.EXE.  Bugs in the batch file prevent 
the DOOMDAY.EXE program from running.  Other bugs in the file cause it to 
delete itself if it is run from any drive but the C: drive.  The programming 
style and bugs in the batch file indicates that the Trojan writer appears
to have little programming experience.
     
RECOVERY:
- ---------
     
**WARNING** Do not copy any files onto your hard disk before trying to 
recover your hard drive.
     
The files are deleted with the DOS del command, and can be recovered with 
the DOS undelete command.  The files are still on your disk, only the 
directory entries have been removed.  If you copy any new files onto your 
hard disk, they will likely be written over the deleted files, making it 
impossible to recover the deleted files.
     
If you have delete protection installed on your system, recovery will be 
relatively easy.  If not, the DOS undelete command can be used, but you will 
have to supply the first letter of each file name as it is recovered.  In 
many cases, you will probably want to restore the directories by 
reinstalling them from the original installation disks, but do that last. 
You must recover any unreplaceable files first using undelete and then 
replace any others by copying or reinstalling them from the distribution 
disks.
     
To recover the system:
     
1. Boot the system with a clean, locked floppy containing the recovery 
program for the recovery files you have installed, or the DOS UNDELETE.EXE 
program if you do not have recovery files installed.
     
2. Type the VIRUS.BAT file to get a list of the directories the Trojan 
tried to delete. Ignore any directories that don't exist on your machine.
     
3. Run the recovery program and recover your files. You may have to help it 
find the recovery files, such as MIRROR, which will be in the root 
directory. You may have to recover the MIRROR file first and then use it to 
recover the other files.
     
If you are using only the DOS undelete command, type:
     
   undelete directory
     
where directory is the name of the directory to examine. To undelete the 
files in the dos directory, use:
     
   undelete c:\dos
     
The undelete program will present you with a list of deleted files with the 
first letter replaced with a question mark. Without delete protection, you 
will have to supply this letter in order to undelete the file.
     
4. After you have restored as many files as you want or can using the 
UNDELETE command, replace any others by reinstalling them using the 
original installation disks.
     
The Operations staff at America Online has released the following 
bulletin to their users:
     
- --BEGIN MESSAGE--
     
Dear Member:
     
As you know, we strive to keep you informed on various issues regarding 
online safety.
     
We want to take this opportunity to remind you about potential computer 
viruses and Trojan horses and how to protect your computer.  First, a virus 
is a program that is designed to spread and usually attaches itself to a 
program with the goal of spreading to other computers.  A Trojan horse is a 
program that is intended to corrupt your computer but has to be activated 
before it can be executed.  For example, a Trojan horse can be distributed as 
an attached file to an email but the file has to be downloaded and executed 
before harm is done.
     
If you receive email from unknown senders with an attached file, it is a good 
rule of thumb not to download the files.  In addition, if you ever receive a 
file in email you believe could cause problems, please forward it immediately 
to TOSEMAIL1, and explain your concerns to our Terms of Service staff.
     
We have received recent inquiries regarding a Trojan horse that is sent as an 
attached file in an email message entitled "AOLGOLD" and "Install.exe". It is 
important to understand that no virus or Trojan horse can be passed along by 
simply reading email.  However, we strongly urge that if you receive email 
with an attached file with this name not to download it.
     
Due to the private nature of electronic mail, we cannot scan files in email 
for viruses as we do with files in public areas of the service.
     
We have never had an occurrence of a virus or Trojan horse being spread 
through simply reading email.  In order for one to spread to your computer, 
you would have to proactively select the attached file and download it to 
your hard drive.  It is therefore advisable never to download attached files 
from an unknown sender.
     
AOL incorporates virus protection throughout the service and scans all posted 
software, text, and sound files in public areas. We also offer our members 
the Virus Information Center on AOL where you'll find information about the 
latest virus or Trojan horse, along with updates to all the popular 
commercial, shareware, and freeware anti-virus tools.  Keyword: VIRUS.
     
Thank you for taking an active role in maintaining a safe online environment.
     
Sincerely, 
AOL Operations Staff

I just thought, even running virus scan on files might not do the trick. When 
there batch files involved..That says rename (ie..file.sys to file.bat..) then 
tells it to run that batch file which is to delete this directory or that 
directory. Those usually can not be detected because they are just text most of 
the time. So point is, if you unzip a file and see a batch file, view the batch 
files before running them. That way you can hopefully prevent some of the virus 
programs that are made of just batch files.

Well, try going through and reading some of the newsgroups sometime. For a 
start try something like alt.security. Look at all the absolute crap, and 
compare the signal to noise ratio to say, 5 years ago. Oh yeah, and don't 
forget all the worthless spammers. It might give you an indication of 
where the USENET is headed.

WOW, LEE-
watch the personal mud-slinging, for it has no place here ( of that might

>Exactly what is a thought?

thought is a physical process, in that it is documentable and observable in
terms of neural function.  yes, it's observed in terms of probabilities, but
still observable.  i am just arguing against this language that seems to be
developing that ignores physicality, or at least seems to downgrade in for
the sake of using spiritual words, such as transcendence, consciousness,
etc.  i believe that we, as a whole, are getting further and further away
from the scientific explainations and biological processes that are the root
cause of our existence.  all that we experience at a rave is a product of
our brains, their wonderful power to project what they have learned upon
actual experience, and the fact that, through phermones, etc, they can
interact in largely covert ways.  those are all observable, biological
processes, and our understnaidng of them needs to be cemented in that fact,
that we are biological creatures who go through chemical processes.  i
think, on the whole, we have forgotten that, and because of that, our
theories on the existence of the world, world consciousness, music,
psychology, sexuality, and other subjects are veering further and further
away from scientific observations that we purport, as ravers, to be
approaching.  just like freud is criticized for spouting at the mouth
without much scientific evidence, i see many such postings on SFRAVES.  i do
not disparage the use of such a language, being a catholic myself and being
very spiritual.  but my spirituality is rooted in physicality, my
physicality, my body, which, through linking up with other bodies, can
achieve things only dreamed about.  but we are still bodies, and just that!!!!!

so, that is my soap-box for the day.

ya'll have fun

peace, love, and bodies

Yep:  it's headed for the world.  Or rather, the world is headed for 
USENET.  Time was, only a few technogeeks knew how to use this stuff, 
and they all knew about netiquette.  Now the rest of the world is 
coming on board, and it's time to adapt or die.

I use much much much better newsreading and email software now than I 
did back then.  I can read many more newsgroups much more quickly, 
even with all the fluff and spam.  And I'm really glad that all these 
new folks are on the net, even if lots of them are relatively 
clueless.

Five years ago, sfraves itself wasn't nearly as hopping as it is now. 
Growth has its good side and its bad side.  I prefer to go with the 
flow and learn to surf more efficiently, since all the newbies are as 
entitled to this net--and to the ability to say what's on their 
mind--as you or I were back in the day.

Yeah, unfortunately they are destroying the wonderful thing that those 
technogeeks created, one of the things all these people were attracted 
to in the first place. 

If I had a crystal ball, it says to me that things will continue to 
degenerate, and eventually people will call for moderation of all 
newsgroups because a) 90% of the posts no longer have anything to do with 
the subject of the newsgroup, and b) No one has the self-control to 
moderate themselves. So someone will have to do it for them. What a sad 
day that will be, when censorship is required because a bunch of 
clueless gits can't figure out that the name of the newsgroup is 
supposed to have a lot to do with the subject(s) discussed.

As an alternate time-line, everyone will join 

A) Microsoft Network
B) AOL
C) E-world

Well I guess that makes one of us. I don't have a problem with people 
that are new to the Internet. That is how I make my living. What I have a 
problem with is people that get indignant when you explain to them that 
they are doing something that is considered rude.

Yup. It would just be nice if these people would post to a forum:

A) Appropriate for what ever is on there mind
B) Where anyone gave a damn about what they are saying.

	I remember, shortly before the light bulb was invented, when people were 
bitching that they couldn't read a full global usenet feed anymore due to all 
the "newbies".  Since then (1982 or so) the collapse has been pretty much 
constantly predicted, as a feed went thru the 1 and 10 MB levels.

	Usenet and mailing lists remain one of the most bandwidth-efficient and 
easily filtered mediums around (if not the most).  This is why the sky, although 
always falling, never hits.  The comparison to CB radio really doesn't work.

	Eudora is free.  Unix equivalents exist (usually bundled). The 
point-and-click technology has been around since the "laurel" agent for the 
Alto (1979)...  I'm sure everyone can find what they need to easily ignore what 
they don't want to see, even if its mailx, pine, elm or mh...  and if you want 
to get really fancy you can set author, subject and/or text filters on many 
systems, which put different kinds of mail in different mailboxes (although I 
will admit that the UI's on most filterers suck)...

	Technology over tyranny -- thats what I say.

Good arguments both sides but it doesn't need to be a big deal...

Two quick options...

1. Eveyone follow the guideline of adding "Non-Rave" to the subject line of
posts not directly related. Then  SIMPLY sort your incoming mail and trash
those pesky non-rave related ones if you don't like them or just don't have
time. (are sort options that rare, difficult, or time consuming?)

2. Start up a second list called SFRavesCommunity or some such name and have
it for all the stuff that's not directly rave related but is related to our
community and the way we live (I'd definetly subscribe).

I know there are possible problems with both these suggestions but I also
know there must be some simple solution that will work for most of us...

peace,
martin

Is consciousness the epiphenomenon of physicality,
or is physicality the epiphenomenon of consciousness...

I think that given all we know and have learned these last 400 years
exploring the material world of newtonian mechanics says pretty clearly
that we cannot understand thought as a physical process at all.  We are
no closer to understanding ourselves than we were then... wait, understanding
our non physical selves.  oh yeah, that doesn't really exist.
Sure, we can develop mind expanding drugs, and suck out tumors from our
body, and cure sickness, and drive really fast, and zip the zapiddy techno
zoodad... but in the end, has anything really changed?  Do people love
more or dance harder?  I just think that an entirely physical universe
discredits so many aspects of life (does that even really exist?) that
I find it hard to use as my answer of the truth.  I think that it's
dangerous not to use words that don't have physicality as the root 
cause of existance.  It discredits life, love, hate, any transcendant
idea.  and maybe from the perspective of a perfect material universe
it doesn't matter that these ideas are discredited... but how then
will meaning ever truly be known?  as an epiphenomenon of a machine?
The problem with an infinate machine is that it has no meaning, unless
there is a transcendant order.  I think that order is the root of
free will, the beholder of meaning, the spark of our life itself.
Some people like to call such an idea god, or just our consciousness,
some settle on just the word infinite itself... a mathematical relation
in a mechanical universe...  but I think the point is that somehow or other
we will always be confronted with our thoughts, meanings, feelings,
transcendant ideas... and unless we give them direct credit, rather
than definitions of epiphenomena, we will never truly understand them.  

anyway... I find it funny that I decided long ago that the universe
was a perfect system, deterministic to the end, with free will as an
illusion, and a funny accident that I should find myself here to consider
it at all... and then I went on to learn all the rules and relations,
the beauty of physics, and more physics, and more... and now, one month
before I graduate I've completely changed my mind on the whole thing.
The world is a very funny, beautiful thing... and I'm sorry if 
funny and beauty just don't really exist... just delusion found in the
midst of chaos.  I prefer to think that they are fundamental qualities
of our existance.

I hope the weekend treats you well,
-john.

Subject: Have A Raving Good Thanksgiving & X-Mas

Dear All;

	There has only been so far a minor response to my suggestion of a 
party. Cause we will be doing food, we must know & have commited no later 
than Tuesday of next week; that's 2 days before Thanks Giving just how 
many people will be coming. So please decide quickly, though there are 
always left overs, and extra food, that will usually only support 2 -3 
people, so people showing up at the door fpor a big meal, is not only 
rude, but it just won't work, from a food logistics stand point.

	I planning on doing a meal, location maybe my apartment if its 
small enough, cause Emeryville is an easy locao to get to, plus my 
sterreo & cabinets are more than adquete to support turntables. Please 
let me know!!!


Dear All;

	The season tis almost upon us, sorry but someone had to be the 
first, Anyway, I've been communicating with many a raver, and many of us 
are going to be here in the Bay Area rather than returning home, to our 
families for all sorts of various reasons, I'm one such person.

	I have a lot of time on my hands, as many of you know :), so as 
my Christmas gift to the sfraves community I would like to offer my time 
and by internet account as the point of contact for a raver Thanksgiving & 
X-Mas away from home, Please send in your ideas, of how you would like to 
spend the holidays with your friends. The simpler the idea, the better 
chance of it happening, so that no one of us has to spend the holidays 
alone. 

	Happy Holidays & Wishes of Much Joy to you, yours & our planet
over this Holiday Season.

I have made suggestion 2 twice(S.F.-Raves Politics), but the idea was 
regected by the list owner, because he felt that there were already 
places to discuss politics. 

                                         Black Adder

I still vote for option 3:

3. Post about issues relevant to the newsgroup/mailing list you are on.
   If you see a thread getting further and further away from the subject 
   of the newsgroup/mailing list, consider moving it to private e-mail.

In addition to prefacing subject lines with stuff like BSP, "Non Rave"
or whatever perhaps we can preface all meta discussions with meta:,
since these are the one's i'm least interested in hearing. I wonder if
anybody else feels like meta-discussions often take up more bandwidth
with more boring bullshit than non-germane (and I ain't talkin' Jackson!)
posts.

Furthermore, we should allow free combinations of prefaces so that we
can determine the stage of conversational development, just how ripe
and stanky the verbiage has become (e.g. like a fine cheddar,runny 
brie, gruyere, or parmesan). For example, a message with a title like
this
 META: ANAL-RETENTIVE: NO!-FUCK-YOU: FUCK-YOU!: NON-RAVE: have a nice day.
would be a definite 'd' for most people.

I never predicted a collapse. I don't see a collapse forthcoming. What I 
see is moderation due to the lack of self-moderation that is becoming 
rampant.

Great, so now we can all filter out shit that should have never been 
posted. Which of course is almost impossible to do. How do you know what 
to filter? How do you know that a line that is filtered isn't contained 
in a larger text that may be relevant? Filters, other than someone 
putting "Not XXXXXX related" or filtering mail from particular persons, 
are not very viable. Why should anyone have to jump through hoops to filter 
things that are irrelevant? Instead of being upset about people posting 
inapproriately, people get upset because they think someone is one is 
trying to rob them of their right to free speech. 


> 	Technology over tyranny -- thats what I say.

Why is it so difficult for people to figure out this is not about some 
tyrannical power-trip? "Because people get upset because I post whatever 
I want wherever I want, they are trying to censor me!" What a bunch of 
absolute, unmitigated CRAP. 

Ever hear the definition of free speech that stated that you have the 
unabridged right to say what you want where you want, except for example, 
you couldn't yell "FIRE!" in a crowded theater?

Altering this a bit for use as an analogy, say that you are in that same 
theater trying to watch that great movie. Except that the person in the 
next row and their friend next to you are talking loudly, preventing you 
from hearing most of the movie. There is no law against them talking in 
the theater. But does this mean that you should have to move down so you 
can fully hear the movie, because the shmucks are too inconsiderate of 
others to realize that there are people trying to watch the movie? If you 
ask them to shut up, are you now stifling them, trying to interfere with 
their right to free speech, when all you are trying to do is watch the 
movie?

If people are going to whine and complain that they cant simply hit 
delete if the subject line says non-rave then we should switch to idea 2. 
my main argument for this is that we are a community here and we are 
friends her, I dont run  around campus to the political science 
departments anytime I want to find someone to taslk about politics with, 
I usually turn to my friends. And this is why I would like to have 
suggestion 2 as an alternative to simply putting non-rave in the header 
(much simpler) and just encourage people to folloe the rule...also maybe 
certain peopl;e dont think that politics or consciousness ides are rave 
related but to me they are very much related to the scene, and to the 
sense of cummunity i get from being on thisd list, if all we talked about 
are how party x is and wht dj played what then i feel like we would be 
skipping a huge part of what the scenen really means to alot of us, like
the ideas we have while dancing, how politics may affect us etc...

	I will concede, the rule should be "courtesy first".  However raising a 
big bru-haha about people making comments in a theater can be more annoying to 
the other customers than the original problem...  eh?   :-)

There are some problems with the belief in a single objective truth.  For
example, some species of birds, and bees and other animals, have four or
more dimensions in their color space (they have 4 types of receptors where
we have 3).  This doesn't just mean that they see more or brighter colors
than we do.  We can't even imagine what they do see, but we can use
Einstein's imaginative way of conceiving 4 dimensions and give colors a
4th, temporal dimension (i.e. they flash on and off or somthing) as a way
to understand what this may mean.  Now, from an objective point of view,
which way of perceiving  the world is right?  Ours?  Theirs?  Yours?  Mine?
Hmmm.  It's not as easy as a saturday morning cartoon.  There are an
infinite number of degrees here, and while some things may occur in a
determinate fashion, there are just as many which are indeterminate.  Any
view comes from a particular perspective, and is therefore partial and
incomplete.  To speak of some sort of absolute objectivity, a 'God's-eye
view' or whatever is to speak of a view from nowhere, and I can't
comprehend what that could possibly mean.

Embrace the chaos - it is the embodiment of freedom!

We also long so dearly for an absolute ground for our beliefs  (why?
insecurity maybe) that we actually fool ourselves into believing such a
thing exist.  I think this is the far more common problem in our culture
(Western culture, not rave culture).  I understand your desire to find an
absolute Truth...I think we'd all like that.  But I think the more you
search (I've done alot...30 years now) the more you come to see that there
simply isn't anything absolute, and truth starts with you and your own
experiences, and is probably statistical and analog rather than binary and
determinate.

Whenever I have time I like the information and debates and they seem to mean
more when I have a clue about the personality of the speaker.

When I don't have time I just blow em away. And with the header I would know
if I'm missing any rave stuff without having to read halfway through the posting.

	I agree with this to a certain extent...  like when I see someone 
telling a tripper that they really can fly off the building, if they just 
*believe*.  Its hasn't worked yet, and I think the objective reality of gravity 
is sufficiently well proven that it should be taken as fact by *everyone*.  I 
don't want to invade your beliefs, but if I see you considering a jump, I'll 
seriously consider trying to talk you out of it rather than consider it an 
experiment in indeterminate reality.  (That is, if I'm not tripping too hard 
too, in which case I hope I'll let you do the experiment instead of me :-).

	There are other somewhat rave-related situations too...  like believing 
your soul will power you when you've dehydrated dancing...  belief in objective 
reality has done our medical sciences well, much to all our benefit.

Yes it can. But again, I am just following the general concensus that is 
cool to talk about anything. So there is no problem, right? (Please note 
implicit sarcasm)

Well, you wouldn't go into a math class and expect the subject to be 
politics either, I imagine. If you do you go to a very unusual school.

There are certain elements of politics and a lot of other subjects that 
affect our ability and freedom to dance, and are VERY relevant to this list. 

Again for about, oh I dunno, the fifth or sixth time, I have been 
bitching about continuous THREADS that go off subject, like say, this one.

********************NEED A NEW SPACE FOR A.D. TONIGHT OR ELSE*************
	
okay, here's the scoop...2519 mission got busted by the cops last night.  
apparently they were having a private-ish swing party and 7 cops PLUS the 
commissioner showed up and took pictures and evidence and wrote them up a 
citation for "being an illegal club."  while this is not true, it does 
still affect the party we were to do tonight.    

SO, IF YOU KNOW OF A SPACE OR PLACE OR ANYTHING THAT CAN HELP, PLEASE 
CALL MY VOICE MAIL A.S.A.P. AT (415)267-7614.  IF NOT - OH WELL.  SEE YOU 
ON WEDNESDAY...

We're giving out evaluation/teaser copies of our multimedia authoring
environment for creating HTML 2.0 pages. There's much work to be done
on the WYSIWYG editing part of this application, and we're working on
an all new version now. However, current public release of WWWeasel is
quite useful if you want to grab media, links, text annotations, etc.
and incorporate them into new or existing documents, then publish them
to our experimental Web server. You can also use WWWeasel to edit your
existing HTML pages in structure mode (sort of like an outliner), and
use our DTD-based parser to evaluate how closely your HTML corresponds
to the HTML 2.0 specification. WWWeasel includes built in facilities
for capturing media via drag-and-drop from the SGI IndigoMagic desktop,
live video camera snapshots and mpeg movies (SGI), screen snapshot,
file/URL browser and audio recording/playback (all unix platforms).

	See http://www.eit.com/software/wwweasel for more information
	and a link to a registration forms allowing you to download
	the software (for free).

Sometime early next year (??), I hope to release WWWeasel II which is a
complete reimplementation of the editing part supporting true
netscape-like WYSIWYG presentation/editing, and a much faster
implementation. We'll also be supporting some of the more commonly used
HTML 3.0 tags, as well as some netscape extensions (centering,
background color/tile, text color, floating images), and it'll be
extensible to support creating your favorite HTML constructs as
"macros", "dynamic macros" (e.g. fetch information from a database or
programmatic query) etc. The extension language is WINTERP extended
with a C and Winterp-Lisp object oriented programming support for
manipulating HTML at a very high level (see 
http://www.eit.com/software/winterp).

Chrysalis Review:

 After getting the directions at the hard-to-get-to/hard-to-leave map point , 
I drove to the site , which was in an industrial part of Oakland. A group of us
wandered about on the sidewalk, fustrated at being able to hear the music
but not get in - no open door!

 I finally located some of the event organizers - including Ethan Miller - at 
a door around the corner . I had walked past it just before they opened up
for admissions.

 Chrysalis was in a nice clean warehouse . Curtains were hung along the 
length of the building , and the area on the right was the dancefloor and main
chill area. The other side was basically unused except for a port-a-sans and 
bathroom area - a nice large space for zooming around in if the dancefloor
density was too high. Actually , the tickets sold by the map point technique 
kept the attendance down to a comfortable density on the dancefloor all night.

 As I walked in , Galen was spinning , doing his usual great job. I like his 
taste in music. The sound was coming out of four speaker stacks set at the 
corners of the dancefloor. With the exception of the occasional problems 
with turntables and distortion , the sound was good all night.

 Visuals were provided by two video projections of computer graphics and 
fantasy film clips ; there were also some well-placed strobe lights , lasers 
and intellibeams. 

 There were three other rooms , about the size of bedrooms. Two were set up
with speakers for  ambient/jungle music provided by DJs and some live
musicians ( can someone else who was there identify who all the musicians 
and DJs were ? I know Seth for sure ). Also , two of the rooms had massage
tables set one ( one belonging and being operated by Brian Darkness ). These
rooms got filled up fast , so I missed a lot of the live music performances.

 I had a great time! My personal best moment happened when I was dancing
to the sound of the conga drummers who were set up next to one of speaker 
stacks. The combination of the aural mix of the techno music and the conga
drummers , with the visual stimulation of a wicked overhead strobe light,
just put me into another intense immediate state of conciousness for a few
sweet brief irreplaceble seconds. 

 The rest of Chrysalis was nice too! I had a lot of SFRavers greet me - I think
my "rave goggles" help to identify me. ( Note to the folks I met last night -
as the accuracy of my hearing , and the lighting , wasn't too good last night,
please say hello to me again in future events if it seems like I don't recognize
you! ). Non-SFRavers came up and complimented me on my red eyewear during
the night ,so I guess I'll be wearing them quite often - I even found a solution
to the fogging problem. I always suspected that the frames were designed for
someone with a larger nose. I tested this by rolling up a rave flyer and putting
it behind the nose bridge - no more fog! I think I'll build that area up with
something more comfortable than folded cardboard.
 
 Many compliments to the Gateway Sound System folks and all their fellow
travelers that helped to put Chrysalis together. Great RAVE!  

 ( I hope the sound system problems get fixed )

Went to a party called "A Single Red Light" last night (It didn't make the

gotta sy, this party was excellent! Straight up house music, interesting
and new space, and friendly people. I think they're doing it again on Dec.
15th(?). I recommend this one...

ARCTIC NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE THREATENED BY BUDGET BILL

        The House and Senate have passed the bill
   and President Clinton will veto it IF WE TELL HIM TO!
Please contact the President as soon as possible; a decision is
      expected to be made by approx Nov. 30, 1995.

White House Comments Line hrs: 6:00 am - 2:00 pm PST

There are many reasons to veto the Budget Resolution,
including that it allows the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge to be opened to oil drillers. These private
companies will build roads, rigs and pipelines in our
nation's public Refuge, driving the carabou off their
birthing grounds. A 20,000 year cycle of life will
be lost forever. And the Gwich'in people have their
survival at stake, for their way of life and very
existence depend on the caribou. Please urge President
Clinton to veto the Budget Resolution  - a veto will
save the Refuge and the Gwich'in people's future.

Hey everybody!

I know none of you know me, but it's good to be back anyway!  I read 
sfraves for a while, and then went on a week long vacation.  Of course, 
there were 600 messages waiting for me when I got back!  Very 
overwhelming!  At that point, I decided to unsubscribe, being unable to 
handle that volume.  But I decided to subscribe once again, so it's 
good to be back!  
I do want some info, if anybody has anything good to reveal.  This 
upcoming Thanksgiving weekend I have a friend coming down, and we are 
both interested in hitting up a good rave.  I'd like to know if there's 
anything particularly good going on Friday or Saturday night that we 
could go to.  And if possible, I'd like to be able to meet some of you 
who've been posting to the list that I've been reading for a while.  
You all sound like a great bunch of people, and I'd like to meet ya 
face to face.  So what's going on, where is it, and who'll be going?  
Any info to be provided would be real helpful!

Wow--I thought last night's Chrysalis was fantastic, and I must say that
Gateway seem to have established themselves--alongside Friends & Family--
as the best promoters in the Bay Area (not to imply that this is all a
contest or anything).  Both those groups have done a lot of impressive stuff
recently; just wanted to say thanks.

Just a note about Kundalini.
after spending from 11:00 pm till 1:45am in line. The night ended by me
being in a crowd watching a straight out gang fight right there in line. It
seemed to me that they knew they were going to be closed down by the
obvious police presence but instead of closing the doors they took in as
many paying people as possible and then just told everyone to go home.
Remind you this was two blocks from the CONCORD bart station. <-- not cool
if you decided to come from the city. I made it home by sheer luck hut
hella ravers are stuck up there till bart started.

Very dissapointing.

Hello and good morning all-

I just composed a letter about this and then accedently deleted it so here
goes another....

Well I guess you all know about Kundalini - the whole WC police squad showing
up for this "little" gattering.  I have always had phun at Kundalini untill
last night. I got there around 2 so I didn't end up losing my 20 buck but I
feel for all those confused, ripped off, spun, dissapointed ravers leaving
the place.  You gotta know that the party is going to be busted when you book
a 350 ppl max space next to a bart station and expect 800 or more people to
be happy till dawn.  Well my night went from down-to-earth to outerspace
because DJ Sausee invited a post-Kundalin-break-up party  at his house.
  I had a great time, Sausee is great and he can really rock th house.  He
had over hundred people show up and put on a phat house party in his
bassment.  It was hot - sticky - groovy and beautyful.  The people were
great, vibe was excelent, and man did I dance my ass off today (er yesterday,
both).  Sausee was first in the first room and then came Carlos.  He cut his
records up and left them on the floor to melt.  Great sounds I heard from
him.  I don't remember who was in the other room -Dreamer? but aroung 6.30?
we brought the set up stairs to dance outside to the sunrise :) Dreamer and
Pat allan switched back-and-fortha and Sausee and Dreamer closed out.  Great
party   -just don't drink too much water-  I hope I might have met any of you
there - I met alot o strangers today and now have alot more friends.  Around
9 we left and went to a friends house to keep spinnin' and groovin'.  I
needed to rest so i am writing this before I crash.  Kundalini didn' bring me
down today and I hope you all found something exciting to do this weekend.
Happy Thanks Givin' all and to all a good night

Dear All;

	Very initially briefly; @ the Crysalis rave map point one of 
Gateway's dearest contributors, while a shotgun pointed at him was robbed 
of Crysalis ticket money. Also while cleaing up, another one of our 
dearest was put in a choak hold & robbed at gun point outside the warehouse, 
less than 10 yards away from everyone else inside. 

	Watch your people at your map points, never have more than $50.00 
on anyone person @ anyone time, do not break or make change for large 
bills either, other suggestions should follow. Does anyone have an old 
drop style safe lieing around?

	I don't mean to say I told you so, but I warned about a more 
organized effort to do just this type of robbery, MONTHS AGO. We could 
have had 2 of our friends dead right know, thank god we don't. WE ARE 
VULDERABLE, PLEASE BE CAREFUL.

	   Peace, Love & Happy Holidays From Across Cyberspace

dancing is my spiritual release, always. you know some of the trance here 
is designed specificaly with the idea of how music affects teh body. it 
is the new evolution in *our culture*. SF is a focal point of some 
interesting?intense energy. were spoiled out here, spoiled rotten, its 
said by many who visit the scene. but its all teh people working together 
on this one, not just leaving it up to *big* promoters who always 
consider their pockets first.(well, its a big consideration, not *all* 
are dirty rotten theives, dont mean to stereotype)
anyways, everyone gets involved, from bringing some fruit to share in the 
morning, to spinning mad trance and teh like, to smiling and spreading a 
positive vibe, to lugging heavy equipment to the beach under a full moon, 
building a fire, giving a hug, crazy laser shows and visuals (and taking 
little or no $ home after teh event - thats teh big one)
*dancing* is communication with the higher energies that arent that much 
higher if one is conscious?aware. (of everyone, of themselves) teh love 
and energy flow naturally from that moment of mystical transcendence. 
(which isnt some big spiritual idea, but a down to earth feeling 
many have experienced, im sure, its that point during the night when 
something clicks, and everybody throws their hands in the air, teh music 
is extra clear, and so is everything. its that moment that is talked 
about after, but its hard to find vocabulary enough to describe it...   
you just *feel* it.) 
"were dancing the design of our new culture." - someone i cant remember.

uh, never mind, it's over, but perhaps check out 3-4PM next
sunday -- it  was a show put on by "Namaste" in the US.

PS: there's franciscan friars on right now (and not the kind that eat
the paper wafer either....) and in an act of total synchronicity, my
video tape ran out within 30 seconds of the end of that show. that's
been happening a lot lately, e.g. mix tapes that miraculously run out
right at the end of of a 90 minute cassette... Hmm.

I aggree with Brian's comments, and wanted to share my own:


	There appears to be a developing problem at parties...   Root of 
conscious, and Chrysalis  both had their map points robbed forcefully, by 
men wielding guns.  These men, or friends of theirs, showed up at 
Chrysalis, came inside, and talked with some of the kids (including

Wow.  I'm glad someone mentioned this.  I think I met one of the people 
you mentioned was at Chrysalis.  I immediately noticed his 
confrontational (and scary) attitude when he responded extremely 
defensively to a friendly comment I made about his shirt.  I got away 
from him as quickly as possible. 
	I couldn't get him out of my mind as I tried to dance the 
encounter away, so I decided to go back to him and talk things out.  
The experience really freaked me out and very nearly ruined what had 
otherwise been an awesome night.  I figured confronting my fear of him 
would be the best thing to do.  
	He invited me to sit down with him in the chill room--a somewhat 
friendly gesture.  He then proceeded to talk at me (not to me) in an extremely 
agitated tone, gesticulating wildly, saying that he was on parole, that 
drug laws are fucked up, that raves were a lot like the cocaine circles 
he used to be a part of (??), that most ravers are full of shit, that 
most people are full of shit, that the school I go to is rascist, that drug 
laws are fucked up, that the government can't stop people from committing 
murder because its a part of the natural cycle of selection (??--I'm 
paraphrasing here).  Mind you, at this point, I was just nodding agreement 
and mumbling "uhuh", waiting for an appropriate time to get up and leave.  
He was talking so loudly that he was noticeably perturbing the people around 
him.  
	At some point in his monologue, this guy offered me a hit off of what I 
believe was a (???) crack pipe (???).  At that point I knew pretty 
decisively that I should not be dealing with this fellow.  Whether what 
he offered me was indeed crack, I don't know (I didn't want to ask), but 
I agree with LMNT's comment--this guy was definitely on something that 
you don't see or want at a rave.  
	In addition, I'm really sorry that some much bad shit happened at 
Chrysalis and to the great people who threw the party.  

	Any comments?  Questions?  I'm purposely omitting this guy's 
description because I don't intend to be accusing or impugning anyone 
here--I just wanted to tell my story.



	thanks,



			BK-jon

That was Consciousness Lab Ambient Sound Research doing the live stuff and
dj'ing.  I think there was atleast one other dj there, but I'm not sure who.
C-Lab is a collective of dj's and musicians that includes many people.
Ambient is the main style you will hear from C-Lab, but occasionally you
will hear others like trip hop, jungle, etc.

I remember after many, many hours of crackin' on (over 24 to say the
least), I would come home and cool my brain to that channel!  The videos
are a complete trip, the rhythms, and of course that near atonal singing is
enough to enahnce any come-down!  Since I don't crackerjack all that often
anymore, I harldy watch it.

But it's on for 1/2 a day on sundays, then it's replaced by Jaam-E-Jamm
(Persian news, & music).

SF has it's bright moments!

Peace,
John

Hello,

While at Chrysalis I noticed a Dat recorder hooked up and a bunch of 
tapes on it.  Apparently some recording might have taken place.  That 
doesn't mean it will be available to the public but if it is please, 
please, please let me know.  I am particulary interested in John 
Carel's set.  

Every dj that night kicked ass.  The party was perfect (I wouldn't 
expect less from gateway).  The people were awesome.  The vibe was 
awesome.  The location (minus robberies)  was great.  It was even what 
I would consider a near-by party coming from Sac.  Loved it!!

There has been talk in the past about worshipping dj's like rock-stars 
or something.  I don't know anything about that but for the second time 
(the first being Gateway's moonlight party)  John Carel has blown me 
away completely!  The dance floor was breaking down.  I myself had to 
sit for lack of energy.  Than the record Eternal Prayer was put on.  I 
have a compilation cd with this song and I hate it!  So when I heard 
the voice I just had to dance to it because I couldn't stand the song 
(don't ask me why).  But It was completely different.  It was much 
trancier and way less cheesy than the version I have.  Infact it might 
have just been the voice.  And things just took off!!!  Record after 
Record of insane music!  After a while I turned around in disbelief at 
what I was hearing and saw that the dance floor filled up again.  That 
guy is the Bomb dj!!

Thanks gateway for being true to the revolution.  I know why they do it 
and I know why others do it.  I know why I would do it and I know why 
others will do it.  The revolution of cultural evolution will grow.

love chris

I can understand Michael's disappointment, for I was there that night, not
on the dancefloor, but waiting in line. I was really looking forward to this
one, with such a strong DJ line up, but it's unfortunate that there 
wasn't enough space for everyone.... in fact it was way too small. This was
obvious from the ridiculously long line; my friends and I waited in line 
for an hour, and barely moved 5 feet! So we gathered our things together 
and left before the commotion started.  Needless to say, we were very 
disappointed with the whole situation.  

For those of you who did get in, how was it?  It would be great to hear your
personal comments.  Hopefully some of you had a good time :)

Hopefully, a more suitable location would be  next time.....

Peace,
James :)

My story is the same as the others already posted.  I got there at
11, stood in line for two hours, got right to the door where I was
about to pay to get in, when somebody started shouting that Carlos
had to get through, so we all stepped aside to let him past... and
this group of close to thirty people pushed their way past everyone
to the very front, Carlos was nowhere.  One of my companions said in
a loud irritated voice, "What do you think you're doing?"  and a girl
looked back and said, "why not..."  and my companion said under
her breath, "wait like everyone else, stupid bitch..." and then a guy
who was with the group pushing their way turned around and was just about
ready to sock my friend... (an basically decent girl with an uncensored
mouth) tensions were just on the cracking point when we suddenly relaxed
and it became crystal clear to us that this was not what we wanted to be
a part of tonight.  So we wished them all a fabulous night and turned away.  
And that wasn't the first group of people who had just pushed through
the line to the front...  Well, all those people got in, they paid their
$20 and got asked to leave an hour later.  It's funny how when you build
up your expectation to a certain point, the reality you find is completely
different than your expectation.  I thought the year anniversary of 
Kundalini would be special, because I had such a good time at the first
one a year ago, but something was lurking in the background, something
I wasn't giving enough credit.  It's been festering and finally came
out this weekend, its long silence broken.  To the people behind Kundalini,
don't get too cocky.  As soon as you start ignoring the people that made
your parties great in the beginning, you will fail.  And that's what I felt
on Saturday night... someone's ego trip taken too far. All that 
expectation without the foundation to hold itself up.  Time to go
back to the basics and work on that foundation with a bit more care.
So I went to a friend's house, and had a great night visiting and just
talking to a bunch of new people.  No lasers and big sound systems,
just the beginnings of a nice new foundation.
For an even greater tommorow.
It was a special weekend after all.

life can be pretty damn cool.

this "space" (conveniently located across the street from my place) is 
actually the rehearsal studios for Beyond Race, the band that destroyed time 
and sound and body at burning man. they have parties there often, Beyond Race 
play at them occasionally. the crowd is usually interesting and the music too. 
i don't know if they intend to be listed as an "event". its more of a word of 
mouth thing usually. just drive by the entrance on Howard between 10th/11th 
and see if anything is going on. personally, i've stopped going to these 
parties as the door people are running this like a club ("7$, no you can't 
poke your head in and see if your friend is here") which i think is kind of 
lame and overpriced for a rent party.

Went to a party called "A Single Red Light" last night (It didn't make the
calendar, I dunno why). It was a rehersal studio space on Natoma @ 10th. I
gotta sy, this party was excellent! Straight up house music, interesting
and new space, and friendly people. I think they're doing it again on Dec.
15th(?). I recommend this one...

Dear All;

	Due to the lack of interest for this event, I will not be putting 
on a Thanksgiving Rave. Because I have to reserve food, which requires a 
deposit, & I refuse to waist good food or have it spoil, in addition to 
throwing money away I will not be sponsering this one. No biggie folks, I 
will be very happiblly spending a quiet evening  = >!!!!! @ home with my 
German friend, wink wink.

	So make sure you get some good loving, & a good meal over 
thanksgiving this year, especially if your not going home. 

	However, If there is an overwheming commitment from the SFRAves
Community & Extended Family, I will scamble to reactivate the food & DJ's
who have commited to attend. This must happen by no later than Tuesday 
Night, that's tomorroe folks. 

	Thanks to all of you who showed an interest, & promised to work, 
you all shine, but you already know that :), see ya's all in

	Yes!  I believe this is so... several months ago I wrote a long 
post on a similar topic, entitled "Rhyme and Reason United," or 
something like that.  Science long ago determined that emotions don't 
literally come from the heart -- the heart pumps blood.  Now it is 
thought that conciousness, traditionally believed to originate in a place 
behind the forehead, in fact may be more widely dispersed.
	It is common to think of mind and emotion as being at odds with 
each other, but in a perfectly evolved person these traits would act in 
harmony.  Both are necessary, as emotional persons who do not think and 
thinking persons who do not feel are, to put it wryly, potholes on the 
road of human tranquility.

AFAIK that's the date, although I don't know that the lineup is set yet.

Wow! after reading the latest posts it looks like last weekend was a doozy!
 A.D. gets busted, overpromotion,greed and bad attitude shut down kundalini
and worst of all armed robery a Chrysilis! (which otherwise had a good
vibe/people).  Well, instead of only complaining we all should try and
prevent this in the future, or else the scene will be damaged (or worse
could happen).  Any ideas? comments? even the obvious like, "don't put out
15,000 fliers for a space that holds 300!" is worth something.

P.S. Props to the Gateway people for a non-hyped good time.

Oh HOOORRAAYYY!! I Luuuurrrrrvvvvveeee it when you dj, Ethan!:)
I am so freakin' excited *already* about this *RAVE*.  I forwent F&F last 
year in order to go to the 3 Year.  I've been to the 2 & 3 year 
anniversary parties and they both kicked serious butt.  It may be an 
unpopular place to many others, but I sure hope the location is where it 
was 2 years ago: the Concorse Exhibition Centre.  God, that was so much 
fun!    I'll quit gushing now....

love,
Amy

Subject: We miss you!

Hi all.  I hope you guys don't mind me just jumping on and off your list like
this, but I really miss the SF community, and I need to here first-hand how
things are going in the best scene in the country.    

I know it's hard to belive anyone would move away from the most beautiful
city to ever to be assembled, but because of reasons beyond my control I  had
to.   Last Jan. my beautiful wife, my daughter --who, by the way, was
concived the morning after the first "Dust bowl" 4th of July Gathering-- and
myself, reluctantly packed up our lives and moved to Texas.   Dallas/Ft.
Worth is ok, but after experiencing the joy's of "The City" for so long, this
place will never compare.

Someone please write us so we can be reminded of what this whole culture is
truly about.  We plan to make a trip "home" soon for some soul regeneration,
so some useful tips on anything that may have changed over the past year
would also be nice.  We have probably also met one or two of you, or at least
someone you know.  It sure would be nice to talk to an old friend from The
Bay Area from time-to-time without charging up the phone bill.
   
 Anyway, thanks for your time.  I'll leave you with a little advice.  Never
take the SF scene for granted.  Dispite it's ups and downs over the years,
it's still alive and well.  Many cities are curently struggling with things
long past for you.  Because of a few caring; dedicated and professional
promoters, as well as many talented; creative and hard working DJ's and
record producers, SF has become a legend within the scene and model for all
other's to follow.   Proof that no obstacle will stop all this as long as
there are people who truely care.  Keep it up, and enjoy...    






                                                                       Dylan,
Kelly and Akayna

Hi everybody,

I just got back from Mad at Bahia.  I liked it because of the beautiful 
way it's set up...dj table up on a raised bit with tables as well.  The 
dance floor was big enough and not too chaotic with people coming and 
going.  And the 
bartender was a beautiful woman with a magnificent smile.

  There were all 
kinds of tropical-themed doodads everywhere.  Such as lots of tall, 
frondy plants.  I really liked it a lot.  I get the impression that in 
other incarnations Bahia is probably as much fun as it was at MaD.  
I also liked the films they were playing above the dance floor opposite 
the dj.  Lots of flowers-in-motion on some sunny days, which elevated me 
out of my previous blahness state that comes from winter approaching.

I was in kind of a bad mood all day due to a disappointing cloning 
disaster (i cloned the wrong thing *shit!*) and so I really needed 
to be with mellow friendly people.

Jon Carrol was playing when I got there, and then somebody named Jason 
Santos, I think.  Where does he come from?  The music was good.  Lots of 
people were dancing and getting down.  The people there I guess were 
people like me who needed something fun but not too intense to pick us up 
out of the ordinairy boringness of beginning another week cycle of 
unnatural labors.

I think that if there are people on this list who haven't yet been to one 
of the parties that this would be a good place to start.  

Bye!

I tried something like that a couple of months ago.  It was supposed to be
liquid E.  It really sucked.  I was a bit afraid for my life to be honest.
It came on really fast and totally slammed me.  I could barely move.  I got
tunnel vision.  I felt as though I would pass out every time I stood up.
There was a period of time when I honestly felt that my life could go either
way....either end or continue....and if I wanted it to continue I had to
really focus and make it happen.  It did not feel good *at all*, and I would
not do it again, or recommend that anyone else do it.  A few of my friends
did it as well and had very similar bad experiences.  I would have been
really pissed had I paid for it....but it seems that I paid enough that night.

GHB is often marketed as "Liquid E" by its dealers.

Props to Shobhan for keeping it up in spite of all that. You could also
un-props her for not knowing when to give up on a losing battle, though. I
think the net effect was conducive to variety though, since people who came
for the fouronthefloor probably explored and discovered the jungle.

I highly rate the breaks basement they had at Audio Tech. Great sound, great
DJs. If anyone knows who the DJ before Jonah was, I would much appreciate
that info. It was really great to see how enthusiastic and supportive the
crowd was toward jungle.

All in all, I stayed from about 11-4 and was mucho fine with paying the US$5
for what seemed to be a rent party (renty?).

Dear ravers:

My brothers are coming here for thanksgiving, and I was wondering what 
would be the best rave to bring 'em to.  They've been raving before, but 
we're all pretty used to the Toronto scene.  I want them to have an 
awesome time at their first SF rave...any recommendations?

Chris.

Okay, all.  Here's the deal.  I'm a little miffed because my friend who was
supposed to drive down to LA with me for thanksgiving flaked and
consequently, I'm driving there myself at 1:00 am on Thursday.  I was
wondering if anyone had any suggestions for something safe & legal that
would help me stay awake on the way home other than vivarin or something
like that (that much caffeine makes me pretty sick).

Thanks,
Jake

for everyone who was trying to get in touch with the president (and anyone
else in the whitehouse), here's a message i received today from some schmo.
peace jb

Forwarded message:
From:	autoresponder@WhiteHouse
To:	Msjoel@aol.com
Date: 95-11-20 17:28:09 EST

    Thank you for writing to President Clinton via electronic
mail.  Since June 1993, whitehouse.gov has received over 685,000
messages from people all across the country and the world.  

    Because so many of you write, the President cannot
personally review each message.  The mail is first read by White
House Correspondence staff.  Your concerns, ideas, and
suggestions are carefully recorded and communicated to the
President weekly with a representative sampling of the mail.

     All of us at the White House are excited about the progress
of this historic project (be sure to check out the Web page as
described below!), and we look forward to future developments
(such as using email to respond to the content of your messages). 
Your continued interest and participation are very important to
us.

                       Sincerely,

                       Stephen K. Horn
                       Director, Presidential Email
                       The Office of Correspondence

P.S. Please read on - you may find the following information
useful.

--  This is the only electronic message you will receive from
whitehouse.gov.  No other message purporting to be from the
President or his staff with an address at whitehouse.gov is
authentic.  If you have received such a message, you have been
spoofed.

--  You will receive only one autoresponder message per day.

--  The only personal addresses at whitehouse.gov are the
following:

    President@whitehouse.gov
    Vice.President@whitehouse.gov
    First.Lady@whitehouse.gov

Please write to Mrs. Gore and other White House staff by regular
mail.  The address is:  

     The White House, Washington, D.C. 20500.

--   On October 20, 1994, President Clinton and Vice President
Gore opened a World Wide Web home page called "Welcome to the
White House:  An Interactive Citizens' Handbook" and it fast
became one of the more popular spots on the Web.  The White House
home page provides, among other things,  a single point of access
to all electronic government information on the Internet. 
"Welcome to the White House" can be accessed at:

               http://www.whitehouse.gov

--   White House documents and publications are available on the
World Wide Web (see above) and by email.  To receive instructions
on retrieving documents by email, please send a message to the
following address:

               publications@whitehouse.gov

In the body of your message, type "Send Info" (without quotes);
do not include other text (such as message headers or
signature lines (.sig files)).  The instructions will be sent to
you automatically.

        Wow, that was amazingly cool and very true (imho) :) WHat i've been
thinking/realizing lately is that 'emotion' is something that (like
'intuition' which it's tied in to) is a non-linguistic perception of your
environment. THat is, you 'feel' a certain way because of information that
you are perceiving from your environment that is beyond the 5 senses and
also beyond rational, linguistic interpretation.  I think buddhists believe
that the mind is a 6th organ of sense and, along this line, maybe the
'heartmind' is something along these lines. THis would explain a lot of
inexplicable reactions to things "good vibes" "bad vibes" or whatever. I do
think though, that like our 'normal' 5 senses, there isn't any necessary
causal relationship between what we perceive and how we react, it's more
synergistic: we see something but at the same time we 'map' concepts on to
what we perceive.
        akk, time to stop thinking, my brain hurts.

        peace,

        brad the emotional aries }:)

        also, i have to give props to mark/cellardemon (from vrave) for a
lot of these ideas that he pushed into my head :)

and it was a shame that we were given the *terrible* sound system.  He was
using 4 home stereos to drive 4 pa's, and another JVC family room delight
for the monitor.  During my 1hour set the following happened:

        1.  Monitor went out 3 times.
        2.  System was feeding back and making a aloud hissing high-pitch tone.
        3.  The jungle room was soooooo Loud that I could not hear my monitor
            (when it was working)
        4.  One of the turntables crapped out so we had to replace it while
            the other record was spinning.
        5.  A flashlight fell on one turntable. (Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzztttt^%$%$)
        6.  The guy doing sound did not know what he was doing.
        7.  The sound went out completely for about a minute a some point
in the                                                        night.

The question is, why wasn't there a good sound system upstairs?

Yes, the basement went off.  The dj's name was U.F.O, I believe.

Thanks (and sorry) to everyone who came.  It just would have been dandy if
there was a decent sound system upstairs.  Props to Shobhan, Alex, Sho, the
Reflective posse and all those who came out.

No shit! and no wonder! 

Anyone who uses a home stereo amp, no matter what wattage, has never done
sound for any party before. At least not for one over 5 people outside of
their bedroom. Your nice receiver at home may be a multi hundred watt
monster, but it was not built to push all of that for hours and hours, it's
simply too much for a delicate component. Industrial strength amps are
required for a hassle free boogie.

There is a really good book that is totally along these lines called "The
Logic of Sense." It's by a guy named Gilles Deleuze who was a figure in the
student movements of the late '60s. It's purple and I forget who the
publisher is, but it's available at City Lights, Kepler's and sometimes at
Barnes & Noble (go figure, but I got "be here now" there too). Check it.

That's why my home stereo amp (and speakers) *is* an industrial model.

Well, Josh Wink has no "s" on the end of his name! He is a cute man from
Philly, and he has very long dreadlocks. He used to be quite the  friendly
guy, don't know about now, but I assume he still is. He also seems to be very
busy, with flying all over the world to d.j., making his own records on the
Sorted label, and writing articles for that pseudo raver mag, Project X. He
has been at Area 51 twice in the past year. He was *really* good. Oh, the
amazed looks of those little sf ravers.... he was good. And he remembered me,
so I was happy. Of course, how could he not? I used to chase him all over the
place mercilessly, I even gave him a bottle of Wink soda once. He was the
victim of my dj schmoozing for a while, but I gave up that vile practice. 

I know I've heard Pierre, but I can't remember where. (what a phat rhymer I
am, huh?) I've never heard of the rest of those people. But I haven't been
back East for a while. 

Have a super-fresh day!

It's Josh Wink, and he's out of Philadelphia.  Also records on a label
called Ovum, I think.  One of his more memorable tracks is the acid track
with that haunting laughing, called "Don't Laugh".

->Colonel Abrams

I pass...

->Barbara Tucker

House Diva.  Great performer (not a dj that I know of).  Memorable track
was "Beautiful People".

->DJ Pierre

One of the originators of Acid House.  Legend.  Recorded as "Phuture".

->Terence Parker

A House dj and producer from Detroit.  Like many of the Detroit artists,
records on several labels.

Well the reason why you probably heard Josh Winks, was he sometimes goes

longest dreads Ive ever seen on a white guy 8).

OK, I'll give it a try :)

Josh Wink -- both a record producer and a DJ, he's from Philly, been
  around the block so to speak since the late 1980s.  I've heard he's
  a very good DJ.  Right now he's the king of the underground tracks
  with "Don't Laugh," "I Am Ready" and "Higher State of Consciousness"
  all creating beaucoup excitement in 1995.  I'm not big on any of 
  them, actually, but many of his other tracks are excellent and he
  mentioned one I particularly like, "Meditation Will Manifest," in
  an interview I saw recently.  Also check his excellent remix of
  Towa Tei's "Technova."  

Colonel Abrams -- As far as I know, he's basically a pop house singer.
  Very popular tracks in Europe and the east coast.  Not my style,
  I don't know very much more.

Barbara Tucker -- Also a pop house singer, but with real depth.  "Deep
  Inside" and "Beautiful People" are both in the classic SF house set
  tradition.  A great voice and serious talent.

DJ Pierre -- My admiration for this guy only grows year after year.
  He's been there since near the beginning for house, best known now
  for his distinctive "wild pitch" remix sound -- the one with the
  honking horns or train sounds that go on for three times the length
  of a regular track :)  But he's also an important figure from the
  early Chicago house and acid house days.  His "Sunshine" remix of
  Midi Rain with the "let your mind be your sun" vocal sample is another
  in a long string of classics he's done.  I'm playing the hell out of
  his Jeff Mills "Late Night" remix these days.  A lot of his stuff is
  samey, but that's the way in dance music, and his level of samey is
  well above the peaks most everyone else ever reaches.  Some of my
  friends think his Wicked set last year was the best house set ever
  played in SF, bar none.  DJ Pierre rules.  Nuff said.

Terence Parker -- Well, there was this kind of quiet guy standing over
  on the side at Record Time in Detroit when me and Robert Smith and
  John Courte were there a month ago.  Pretty soon Robert introduces me
  to . . . Terence Parker!  I don't know whether TP is a DJ or not
  (pretty much everyone who makes house music except Mike Banks seems
  to have tried at one time or another, whether or not they still do),
  but it doesn't matter to me.  Terence has put out some amazing tracks,
  only one of which, "The Question," is widely known (both for the original
  and a nearly identical K-Klass remix).  I'm particularly partial to
  "Stand Up for the Soul," myself.  Anyway, TP has put out tons of Detroit
  house over the last five years or more.  He has a raw, percussive style
  with gospel-influenced vocals, lots of piano chords and syncopated 
  meter, all of which are well in evidence on "The Question."  Some of his
  tracks are hard to listen to, since he experiments so much with sound
  and harmony.  A truly underappeciated producer, if you ask me.

That help?

  :)

   Here it is, before I head out for T-giving. There might be more stuff
   this weekend - one party a night seems a little skimpy. But at least
   there's something promising every night. Organic probably has the
   longest, best track record of the lot.
   
   Last weekend sounded a bit tough - a couple busts and a robbery. So be
   careful out there and remember, there's no money back guarantees.

You'd be better of just figuring out the simple mathematical formula he 
uses for all the "wild pitch" stuff & plugging in some much needed new 
sounds :) or getting Phuture "acid trax", which is by far the best thing 
he's ever made, problem is he made it exactly 10 years ago & IMHO he's 
only made about 10 good tracks in this time out of many hundreds.

Saturday night?  Weird TV is, er, well, a weird TV program on channel 2
Saturday latenights (around 2:00ish?)  They had interviews with some of the
organizers, Larry somebody and another guy(?) about how Burning Man
started, then they showed the incredible rain/hail/wind storms and the mud
frolicking that followed, the lighting ceremony, and some dude in a shark
car tearassin' around.  I had just gotten in so I was just tooo tired to
watch any more.  It was kewl to see some of it since I missed it, though 8(

Strictly Rhythm put out a compilation album a while back of some of his
output for them. His remixes of the Joint Venture singles for them are
excellent. In addition to Wild Pitch stuff he's done some classic acid trax
as well, being involved in Phortune and Phuture to name a couple.

Excuse my ignorance please, but what does Wild Pitch mean?  Is it a name, a
sound, a style....I'm just not getting it.  If it is a style, is it possible
to describe in words?

This broadcast originates at the stanford college radio station so the

and to parts of Oakland, there will be 13 DJs from the Bay Area playing

I wasn't around this weekend, but my friend happened to be standing right
next to the cop/organizer interaction at the busted Kundalini party.  This
is how it went down:

When the *cop* said that it was fucked-up that they were taking people's
money knowing that they couldn't possibly have an unpermitted party of that
size in downtown Concord without it getting shut down, the guy running the
show said, "We all have to make money, you know."

I guess it's all about motives isn't it?

Saving my 20s for a worthier cause...

For really good sequencing software on the PC, I'd recommend you check out
Cakewalk Pro by Twelve Tone Systems.  It has a really good, intuitive,
interface and very nice features like groove quantizing which will allow
you to quantize a track according to a particular groove.  It comes with a
bunch of pre-set grooves and you can define your own as well.  Other
quantizing features allow you to synch up time and groove to other tracks
too.

I believe a related home page with demos can be found at:
http://www.isvr.soton.ac.uk/People/ccb/Cakewalk/Demos/

I wish you luck and much fun in your music making!

Peace

Josh Wink has had a big hit over here in Europe with 'don't laugh' (it even made the top ten in
Holland)
Colonel Abrams was trapped a few years ago
Barbara Tucker is a singer, not a dj (unless I'm mistaken, but I don't think so)
The dj Pierre I know is from Chicago and has made some of the first acid-house 12"es
Terence Parker is pretty cool.

emotions also have a very powerful chemical element. perhaps chemical 
reactions in us(emotions) are influenced by forces outside ourselves?

chemical imbalances in the brain (we all cannot have identical mental 
chemistries...) affect emotions?

Sorry to hear about the party and the bust, but I must say it doesn't 
strike me as suprising.  Kundalini started with a wonderful party one 
year ago and they have progressively gone downhill since.  They have 
given less and taken more with each party they have thrown.  The last one 
I went to was last spring way out there somewhere in a building on the 
fairgounds.  The line moved incredibly slow until 12:00 rolled around, 
then the price went up to $20 and amazingly enough the line began to move 
again.  I'm sad to see the end of a good party... but Kundalini is over.

On a totally non-rave related subject.... I have four good seats to the 
49er - Rams game this sunday at 1:00.   If anyone is interested, they are 
$40 each and you can call me at 415-641-8653.  I have to get rid of them 
because I'm going out of town.  Again I apologize for the cheesy 
non-rave sales bit.

Much love to everyone, and have a great thanksgiving.

Andrew

emotions are totally chemically based.  if not, i could control
the sign wave, as it is, i observe where it takes me (with the
air of a scientist, clip board in hand, wathcing stuff bubbling out 
of a beaker for no good reason).

trance is the equalizer.

        Hey, don't worry, sucking isn't all BAD! I mean, where would we be
without vaccuum cleaners? And elephant snouts? And other forms of sucking
that are beneficial to us? :)
        Seriously though, you have ups and downs, when you're down the only
place to go is up, and while you're up remember what it's like so you can
have something to hold on to and recreate when you're bummed. And hold on
to that 'inner balance' that resists the effects of outside influences on
your mood, rather than being a cork bouncing around in emotional water, tie
yourself down by remaining peaceful and centred within yourself :)
        works for me (sometimes, but not all the time).
                brad

i'd like to remind everyone that this coming December i'll be doing a
motivational seminar with Tony Robbins, Terence McKenna, Hakim Bey, Casey
Kasem and Hardfloor, tickets are only $350 for the weekend and include a
hot and cold buffet. :)

	I have seen parties with old solid state amps which powered a 100 
or so person party in a nice cement basement. Granted, it burned up 
because we set another amp on top of it (yes, silly us), but it took 6 
hours to do so (and some gabber/hard fast acid for those of you who 
require gabber to be filled with people yelling shit and fuck - to finally 
push it over the end). Though, I would agree they really do not have make 
of a place outside one's home or a space where you want to leave the 
sound system for the next week...

*************************************************

Attn manufacturers, distributors, shippers
retailers, customers, fans of underground music.

We are currently facing a situation here in Detroit. 
Submerge is about to be right field in a new baseball stadium! 
We are located in one of the more rundown areas of Detroit - 
The Cass Corridor. Due to our cheap rent and unique location 
we and our customers have come to love our special spot 
(not to mention it was one of the few places we could afford). 
2030 as it is called is also the home of UR, Metroplex, Red Planet, 
Eddie Fowlkes, Juan Atkins and members of Parliament-Funkadelic. 
Developers from outside of the city have negotiated with city 
officials a deal in which our neighborhood chillingly 
called AREA 1 is slated for eminate destruction to clear 
the way for the new stadium which is scheduled to break 
ground in May 1996. Buildings are being razed as we speak! 
Its winter and many of these abandoned buildings are the only 
shelter available for our neighborhoods many homeless people. 
Being very pro-Detroit we always hoped and knew that blighted 
areas such as ours would eventually come back which is one of 
the reasons we stayed, but progress must come in 
a way that is fair to everyone.

Hopefully with your support we can get the city and the 
developers to see that there is more here than the decayed
buildings, drugs and crime. Hopefully they also see a 
neighborhood full of proud Vietnam vets too proud to accept 
handouts, perhaps they will see people who no matter how down 
on their luck still are able to share their food with someone 
less fortunate, perhaps they will see small business owners 
who refused the exodus to the safety and comfort of the 
suburbs and remained loyal to the city.

Hopefully the city and the developers will see that 
shelters need to be built and business kept in or close 
to their original locations. We at Submerge face and 
ironic problem - due to most of our hometown radio stations 
inability to play our records (even though the rest of the 
world does!!) this music and its affiliated artists producers 
and record labels although some of which are world famous 
mean absolutely nothing to our pre-programmed audiences 
here in Detroit and I am sure this will include Detroits 
city council. The only major press coverage our music ever 
got here was highly negative and associated with teen drug 
use at warehouse partys. This was very unfair press 
especially to the people built and survive from this music. 
I am hoping that anyone who appreciates what Detroit underground 
music has done for this world and what submerge is doing 
to keep the Spirit of truly independent Detroit record 
labels alive could write a brief 1pg. or less letter and 
fax it to the  #1+313+963+0213 please include your return 
address and also please mention the need for shelters as 
the homeless have no voice! 

We need these faxes or letters by 11-27-95 for our meeting with City Counsel.

Peace - The Unknown Writer - on behalf of Submerge

Yesterday I was down in SF and I picked up a cd at Virgin Records. Mainly
I was attracted to the "happily raving cats" on the cover (they continue
throughout the insert :) ), but it also listed tracks by the
LowSpirit/Mayday family (Marusha, Westbam, etc.), N-Trance, and thirteen
other groups. So I bought it and took it home. As soon as I put in the cd
player I knew why it was titled "Happy Rave 95"!  AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME
this is extremely happy hardcore which had me blissed ever since last
night. There is not one bad track on this one IMO and the happiness just
envelopes you completely. I got a few other new Cds but haven't had a
chance to listen to them yet (I'll post a review as soon as I have)
because of the utter powerfulness of HappyRave95.

The main difference between home stereo amps and "professional"
PA amps rated at the same wattage, e.g. "100 watts per channel",
is mainly this:

PA amps are designed to be played at their maximum power output,
including going beyond into the land of Clipping and Distortion
(that "crunchy" sound), for extended periods of time without
failure, since everyone always demands more volume no matter
how loud the music already is.  They also incorporate special
"soft clipping" circuitry so that when they do go "into the
red", the distortion isn't as obnoxious.

Home amps, on the other hand, are designed for exact-fidelity
reproduction, usually at much quieter levels.  Therefore, the
electronics are not build to stand hours of overload, because
any home stereo user who hears their amp fuzzing out will just
turn it down.  There is also usually no overload light, as
most amps today are MUCH louder than the average home or
apartment will desire (or withstand).

This is why home amps often die when pressed into party usage:
people crank it up as loud as they can, into the overload
range, and the amp can't sustain the wattage and fries
itself, whereas a PA in that condition will cope just fine.

I have run several home parties off of home stereos and never
harmed the speakers or the amps: the key is to know what
an amp or speaker being pushed too hard sounds like, and to
back off reasonably if you hear it.

The trouble with house music is that the "overloaded PA" sound
is _so_ widespread and _so_ common that many people think that
the record actually sounds like that!  SJ Oasis, anyone?

Hope this lay explanation won't offend any of the techies.

First of all, there's a better chance that you'll fry your speakers
before you fry your home amp. In fact, a good way to fry your speakers
(especially your tweeters) is to run them with an underpowered amp that
is clipping and distoring. Of course, if you're running "club" (aka
horn loaded) speakers then there's a good chance they'll survive cuz
they're meant for that kind of abuse.

Second, if you get a power MOSFET (field effect transistor -- closest
you can get to a "solid state tube") amp, it will intrinsically prevent
itself from frying because MOSFETs don't have the problem of "beta
breakdown" that occurs in standard bipolar transistors, which is
essentially a heat-induced "positive feedback loop" in which the hotter
the transistor gets, the more current it lets pass through it, and it
eventually burns itself up. MOSFETs have a "negative feedback effect"
in which the hotter they get, the less current they allow to pass, and
therefore they tend to self-regulate their overheating behavior. Beta
breakdown induced overheating is typically how yer average (aka bipolar
transistor using) home amp will fry itself when put to "club" use....
Better (aka pro) bipolar txistor based amps have a heat sensor to
prevent this kind of problem. MOSFET amps don't really need 'em as long
as you've got reasonable heat sinks and air circulation. MOSFETs don't
really need soft clipping either since their distortion characteristics
are inherently "soft" (the MOSFET transfer function produces
even-harmonic distortion components, just like a vacuum tube), whereas
bipolar txistors have dissonant/harsh odd harmonic components when they
distort due a fractional exponential in the transfer function when you
overdrive them.

What do you all think about melatonin? it's a relatively new health-food
store supplement that is claimed to be the bodies natural "sleeping pill".
Claims are also made that it prevents effects of aging, and that it
increases sex drive in older people.

I tried one last night before going to sleep and indeed, I did sleep
very well (didn't wake up at all during the night), had more
interesting dreams than usual, and felt pretty fresh in the morning.

The claim is that it is a hormone produced by the pineal gland at
night and causes drowsiness.

Comments? Warnings?

PS: and is there an anti-melatonin for when you want to stay awake??

        From my limited readings, this seems to be true. I have read that
melatonin is tied in with hormonal secretions in the pituitary gland and,
because the pituitary gland is light-sensitive (optically, i would guess,
unless you have a thin skull ;) you get less melatonin in the winter,
leading to Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD :( what a cheesy name :). Or is
it that you get more melatonin in the winter...i forget, i guess winter is
creeeping up on me.

>PS: and is there an anti-melatonin for when you want to stay awake??

        yeah, gabber! :) hearing loss is a side effect though ;)

ps-->any chem-types on the list please correct me if this is a load of

Is this what is in SugarBabies.  I've seen these a few times especially at
the last FTT.  From what I am told the makers of these SugarBabies pour
"liquid ecstacy" - before it is crystalized - on sugar and cap it in phat
pills. My friends who took it said it was realy strong and effective but had
no serious bad effects ( as described earlier).  Is this still E? or GHB?  I
wanna know - 

Also on another note I watched Mega-dose on eMTV today and there was a
segment on Herbal E. First they began with  showing a clip of an artical
where a US man died caused by E and then went on to explane Herbal E is here
to replace illeagal drugs.  But at the end of the segment the people who took
the erbal decribed their "side-effects" of quesyness, dehydration and just
plan sick - something I might feel in mild effects with the really thing but
not as intense as the herbal canadits.
Well just another attempt of the media to slander the E rep.

It's the overrated hype drug of the moment.  I tried it some time ago,
to see if promoting more restful sleep would give me more energy
during the day.  I actually felt pretty crappy the next day(on 3 and
then 1 mg).  I'm the same age as I would have been anyways :^), and as
for sex, well, I'm older, but not that older(though I'm getting older
every day)... :^(.  

My guess is you'd have to be past the melatonin drop off age to get
any use from it... e.g., when you don't sleep as deeply as you did in
your youth.  Assuming your laying off the caffeine, alcohol,  etc.
before bedtime.  And I wonder if you might start lowering your natural
output of melatonin as your tolerance grows?

Anyhoo, it's probably better to take one once in a while than benzos.
Sometimes it made me sleepy, sometimes not.  And it tends to wear off
in 4 hours(some people take a booster at this point).

YMMV, 

David

smelll the coffee on thease events they've beeen havin lately(anyone

there weree a # of fools trying to selll vitamen c for $20 (chee whatever
for?)This too is again on the rise...People this was part of ruined the
scene in LA(IN my opinion)Please don't let this happpen to San
Francisco.I'm not only referring to thease incidents but I have noticed an
increase in the overall "bad vibe" factor.We need to keep this scene and
not let a few bad apples spoil it for all of us.

Most interesting is the presence of a track by Scooter. I was in France 
back in April and all I saw in the record stores there was Scooter 
(specifically a recent track called "Hyper Hyper"). Finally the Virgin 
store brings them to me here (both this "Happy Rave 95" CD and a single 
of "Hyper Hyper"). Does anybody know anything specific about this band?

I've been doing some research on GHB (haven't tried it though).
Apparently the usual dose is about 1 g.  Too much for a pill, so it is
distributed as a solution.  It usually starts out as a powder.
Apparently its still easy to obtain overseas, someone is even selling
it mail order on Usenet (check the alt.drugs groups).

The cop definitely had a point, but still, seems to me that he was the 
pot calling the kettle black.  It's fucked up to shut down a party if 
it's not causing problems -- permit, shmermit.

	I heard a rumor that Al Gore will be the keynote speaker at this

three remaining Beatles to celebrate the release of their new techno album, 
accompanied by Mikhail Gorbachev dancing in a mu-mu while holding a big heart

So Detroit's Submerge Records is about to lose their home to be replaced 
by a new ball park.

This phenomenon is not unique to Detroit.  City governments and other 
official entities routinely violate people's rights through what is 
called "eminant domain" -- it means they claim that in the name of 
the "public good" they have more right to your property than you do.

The ongoing People's Park controversy in Berkeley began with just such a 
use of eminant domain by the University of California, which tore down 
existing housing and forced people out of house and home in order to 
clear the land for student housing, which was subsequently never built 
because of local opposition to the University's heavy-handed tactics.

I foresee this same type action happening in the San Francisco's South of 
Market area in the future, possibly displacing venues and other members of 
the rave community, since this is an area often discussed as being ripe 
for redevelopment.

It is interesting to notice that eminant domain is almost always used in 
the poorer areas of town, where residents and merchants lack the power and 
resources to fight City Hall's destruction of their homes and businesses.

Needless to say, in a libertarian society, property rights violations 
like this would not be occuring.

Food for thought,

I have no experience, to my knowledge, with GHB, but I know liquid E 
exists -- I've taken it, once.  I disbelieved it myself at first, having 
read a bunch about MDMA and not heard it mentioned once.  I'm not sure if 
it was the dose or what, but with the exception of the first time I took 
Exstasy, the time on liquid E was the most wonderful trip I've had in my 
life.  It was at a Full Moon party at Bonny Doon a couple years ago, and 
some very generous strangers shared it with me.  I'm reasonably sure the 
stuff was pure Exstasy -- even mixed with copious amounts of water, it 
had that incredibly bitter taste, and I got the jaw clenching, the 
overpowering feeling of love and oneness with the world and everyone in 
it, it could scarcely have been anything else.

Mmm, just thinking about it now is making me smile!

Big Hugzzz to you all,

Yeah, I've known about it and taken it before all the hype.  Some of the 
research seems to indicate that your pineal gland (the physical organ
that is associated with the "third eye") excretes melatonin while you
are asleep usually between the hours of 2 a.m. and 4 a.m. but guess
what!? That's prime ravin' time for many of us so our bodies don't
get to get their melatonin dose, compound this with the fact that as you get
older, you produce/excrete less and less, so this really is a good thing 
for you gray haired ravers out there.  I take it to help me sleep and to
help regulate my sleep cycle when I've done a weekend of hardcore raving.
(I got a day job now, and have to come to work before 4 pm these days :)

I've noticed if I take over 2.5 mcg I get drowsy in the morning though.

 
> PS: and is there an anti-melatonin for when you want to stay awake??


Yes, it's called meth but don't even go there :)

I have been hearing a lot of reports in the media about melatonin. It seems
that the things it does best are: preventing jat lag and helping you to
sleep. Unless you have chronic insomnia, I really don't think you should be
taking it. I have been studying various systems of natural medicine on my own
for several years now. One thing I have learned is that the human body is a
very complex mechanism and it usually does a good job of regulating itself. 

Every few years there comes along some miracle supplement that has been
claimed to do everything except the dishes. For example, the claims on
melatonin about sex drive & reversal of aging are based on mice. Older and
younger mice had their pineal glands switched around. There haven't been any
studies done on humans that have substantiated these claims. Since melatonin
is a hormone, I wouldn't take it myself. Well.... maybe if I was in my 50's
or 60's I'd think about it. 

I think the best thing you can do for yourself is to eat good food, get some
exercise and plenty of rest. This keeps you younger than taking pills! ;-)
Not that I follow my own advice, but what the heck?

You can believe if the FDA thinks millions of people are taking melatonin,
they'll try to pull it off the market. Just like ma huang. The FDA is one
gov't organization I wouldn't mind seeing fall by the wayside!

If you were there, you would have seen there *were* problems. Suburban
'gangsters' wearing Raiders parkas fighting in the street, the club was
*hopelessly* overcrowded and the fire marshall has a right to do something
about that.

Don't get me wrong, I am all for having parties in all kinds of places, but
when you operate inside the law by having your party in a restaurant like
this was, you have to abide by the laws that restaurants have to, including
max occupancies, fire exits, use permits, etc.

I really feel that in this case, it was a clear case of a sucky promoter
with a clear problem regarding morality. When you throw a party, you have a
trust or bond with your paying guests that you will deliver a good party to
them. This promoter clearly broke the trust of his guests by clearly not
delivering to them a party that was in the right sized space, etc.

I think that someone should post his name on SFR so that we can all stay
clear of his parties in the future. We deserve it, and so does he.

Whoa, chill out...

Give them a chance to make good.  Their voice mail indicates that
they'll be throwing a make-up party in the future.  

I know the promoters (Rich, Tony, Vadim).  You may remember that I
strongly recommended their early parties.   I don't think they were
just out to make a quick buck.  They made some mistakes (I even warned
Rich to expect a huge crowd).  Some of what they did seems crass to
me.  I'll see if I can get a satisfactory explanation next time I talk
to Rich.

It's not like promoters who have thrown a bad party or party that got
busted  couldn't be forgiven (e.g. Progress, CDC's Chemsitry).

Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com

Hi!  I talked to Colin of Tribal Funk who wanted to know about DAT recording the party.  Although I'm borrowing a friend's DAT recorder at the moment, I
can't go to the party and I feel weird about just loaning it out.

Is there anyone -Lee Fogel, Phred, are you listening?- who would be willing to
tape the party for them?  Colin said to get to the party about 9 so that
everything can get hooked up and they can do the sound check and make sure
everything's working.  I'm assuming that anyone who tapes the party will get
in free, as well a companion or two or three or whatever.

I hope someone will respond!  Please either email me or leave a message on
the New Moon voicemail:  415-267-3076 with your relevant get-in-touch 
information, which I will pass along to Colin.

Oh yes, I forgot to say:  the party is TOMORROW night!  I sort of recall the
people who throw this one as being pretty together, but I don't really 
remember much else.  

I wish I could go!

-Ann

BY YOUR COMMAND;

	Organic is going to be HOT; how hot? FA_KING HOT, CROWDED, how 
crowded; FA_KING CROWDED; and filled with ANAL SECURITY; how anal? ON A 
PUNK ROCK S&M MISSION FROM HELL. However it is the only thang going, and 
the Troc, in my opinion, has the best light & smoke show goin in SF, plus 
everyone that works there drives; like really rad motorcycles. Not to 
take away from the excellent light/laser shows that have been coming outta 
our 
smalled parties, like Friend's & Family & Lite. 

	I don't like big Raves, call it old age & wisdom, but nonetheless you 
will see me at Tribal Funk on Saturday, cause it' slimm dis weekend.

	So what's the deal with Tribal Funk, I heard they used to do
really KIND small parties, then they discovered Capitolism and started
doing bigger parties?(No judgements implied)

Organic:

  the party.  rather good.  when we got in the vibe wasn't quite in
place but carlos and tony worked it and then when jeno came on he tore
down the house with house.  it was nice throwing in "deep inside" 
which really got me going.  Simon played a very very nice coming down 
set and then the party ended at 5 am.

good party.  i just want to mention the afterwards also:

when out side i was waiting with deegroovy (veronica) and her friend
connie for some other friends when 2 of the palace security guards
parted the crowd holding a rather large guy bleeding from the head. 
appearently the person was drunk, but had also been beaten by the 
security guards causing the blood.  The cops arrived and the 
security guards blamed ignorance on how the bleeding occured.  The
cops then tried to scare everyone away and at one point while i was
crossing the street a cop told me to stop.  i was rather interested on
seeing what would happen next so i kept walking and the officer grabbed me
by the throat and pulled me to the curb, and after a few minutes holding
my id chastized me for not being my age (21) and told me to go home.  
  Im not saying that i didnt provoke a bit.  but allowing people to
hit someone in the head and throw him to the ground bleeding didn;t
see right.  also being a photojournalist i wasnt particularly happy
about not being able to see the events occuring.  Its the press's right
to me close to a scene as long as you are not interfering with the
process.

i donno.  the whole situation just doesn't see right to me.
especially after a fun party.
oh well.

Hi Everyone,

A while back I posted a request for travel tips regarding Spain and 
Paris. I just want to thank all of you who responded with your ideas, 
recommendations and enthusiasm. I've printed out your lists of clubs, 
stores, restaurants and tourist traps and plan to take them with me in 
just a few (!) weeks. Sorry not to have sent along my thanks before now, 
and sorry not to respond to each of you personally -- it's been a 
hectic and difficult time (a recent death in the family), but 
please know that I really appreciate your help!

A note on Kundalini -- 

I have a special place in my heart for this party because my boyfriend 
and I kissed for the first time at their first party last year at the 
Troc. We've been happily together ever since. I'm sorry to hear the party 
in Concord didn't go off, and sorry for those of you who got caught up in 
the maelstrom. Too bad the magic didn't happen this time.

Love,
Kathryn

Dear All;

	Recently saw a film directed by  Lars Von Trier, called the 
Kingdom. It would be great if you spoke Danish or Swedish, but us 
monoliquial American will have to deal with the sub-titles; which are 
unfortuately difficult to read at some points in the movie.

	However and I'm just gonna reprint this an excerpt or an excerpt 
from The New York Post review by Larry Worth:

	If Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, Paddy Chayefsky, & Robert Altman 
were rolled into one, the reseult might be Lars von Trier.

	Denmark's answer to Twin Peaks! A comedy of the supernatural. Von 
Trier, with Wellesian graddiosity, flaunts a liberated cinematic 
imagination with nose thumbing glee.

		-Stephen Holden, The New York Times

	An unholy mix of hospital soap opera, saturday morning 
supernaturalism, genteel detective story & erotic intrique.

		-J. Hoberman, Village Voice

	You can find this film playing at the UC Berkeley. SO why do a 
movie review on a rave mailing list, ravers are international world 
citzens, so a review of a popular cool foreign film that appears to be doing 
well over in Europe, seems appropreiate.

	Flames Welcome, but make sure you check out the movie, it's 4.5 
hours long so make sure you stock up on cheaper candy before you go 
in, anyway....., see ya in space>>>>>>>______.........

Sorry to continue this dead thread, but here's a quote I just remembered. 
On the first day of class, my philosophy prof wrote this on the board. 

"You are whoever you think you are. 
So you'd better be damn sure you know 
who the hell you think you are."


No one is anything except what they choose to be. 
No one can tell you what to become unless you let them. 
You are whatever you are. Or, as Popeye says, "I am what I am."
.grin.

It's nice that the roles has changed for once, usually its us Danes that has
to read subtitles!!

I'm glad you liked the movie, it got rave reviews when it first played in
Denmark as a TV series a year ago.

 I heard there would also be demos/lectures by Brian Darkness and PEE WEE 
 Herman, on the art of massage, and the art of self massage.  :) 
 Tony Little and Suzzane Summers lecturing on the health benifets of
 raving, as well as the introduction of Suzzane Summer's Smilemaster 2000 tm.
 which attaches easily to the Thighmaster t.m.  Jim Neighbors is  
giving a dj appearance, Captain Stewbing and his lovely daughter 
Vicky will be selling E, Rick Schroeder and Issac the bartender are selling
smart drinks, and Nell Carter and Richard Simmons will be doing an intepretive
dance called"The Sparrow, the Sasquatch,  and the Sphinctor."   This event 
will go off!

Dear Wayne,

	My first thought when I read this was to post a response saying 
"OK, you're right.  What you've said shows that they deserved to be shut 
down."  
	I was then going to go on to say (as I am saying now) that I wasn't 
aware of the overcrowding inside or fighting outside the Kundalini space, 
since these conditions weren't mentioned in others' posts about the bust, and 
as you correctly assume, I wasn't there, so I have no firsthand knowledge.
	After thinking about it a little bit more however, I decided that 
the situation still didn't justify the cops and the fire marshall 
shutting down the party.  It may seem strange to some of you reading 
this that I would favor allowing a party to continue when people are fighting 
and possibly getting hurt, and the space is so full of people that it poses a 
serious danger should a fire or other incident break out.  Bear with me, I'll 
try to explain.
	Imagine for a moment that we are near Daytona, Ohio, at the site 
of the recent talks on ending the conflict in Bosnia.  Imagine that due 
to the high-profile nature of the event, and the organizers perhaps 
having granted too many passes to the press and so forth, the space where 
the peace talks are being held is hopelessly overcrowded.  Furthermore, a 
scuffle has broken out in the street outside the hall between pro-Bosian and 
pro-Serb protestors.  Additionally complicating matters, it is discovered 
that the event being scheduled at the last minute made it impossible to comply 
with city regulations requiring a permit for an event of this size to be 
obtained one month in advance.
	Here we have a situation approximating what happened at 
Kundalini:  Overcrowding, through fault of the promoters; fighting among 
people at the site of the event, but not actually inside; and lack of a 
permit for reasons outside the promoters' control.
	Now can you see for one minute the Daytona cops and fire marshall 
shutting down the peace talks and just telling everybody to pack up and 
go home?  Hell no!!!  It would never happen.  So why do raves get shut 
down for the same offenses that other events get away with?  Two basic 
reasons:
	(1) Raves are not an "official" function.  Rave promoters can't 
afford to pay for the cops to provide adequate security from the get-go; 
in the case of Daytona, the local taxpayers probably footed the bill.  
The result is that for "official" events, the cops are part of the 
process; thus they have a stake in seeing that the event goes forward 
successfully.  At a rave, they arrive late in the game, with an 
antagonistic outlook.  Official events also never have to worry about 
having the proper permits, because the people throwing them are in effect 
the same people in charge of overseeing the distribution of permits (this 
is generalizing somewhat, but true in a broad sense.)
	(2) Raves are not seen as important or valuable community events 
the way peace talks, parades, festivals and the like are.  We know that 
they are just as important and valuable, but the cops and the authorities 
don't -- in fact the opposite:  They view them primarily as nuisances and 
potential causes of trouble.

	While we can't hope to change these realities overnight, we don't 
have to legitimatize among ourselves the inferior treatment we 
receive because we're not a part of the official elite, and we don't have
to accept implied condemnations of our values that we know are wrong.
	In the case of the fictional problems at the Daytona peace talks, 
police and fire officials would most likely have: (1) Broken up the 
fighting and dealt with the antagonists on an individual basis, instead 
of seeing them as representative of the event as a whole and resorting to 
"group punishment" by shutting it down; (2) Calmly and politely gone 
about getting some of the people inside to exit the building in order to 
alleviate the overcrowding, perhaps by making an announcement asking 
people who didn't have a pressing need to be inside to leave for the sake 
of preserving the safety of everyone else; and (3) Ignored the issue of the 
lack of a permit altogether.
	I am suggesting that all of the above could have (and should 
have) been done at Kundalini, and at numerous other parties busted on 
similar grounds.  None of this should be taken as a defense of the 
Kundalini promoters.  Like I said, I wasn't there, and I don't know 
the people involved.  What I am saying is that whatever mistakes the 
promoters may have made, including the question of their motives, is an 
entirely separate issue.

Part of your complete nutritious breakfast,

You know it never ceases to amaze me that no matter how fucked up or 
irresponsible a person/promotion group is, that there are always 
excuses.

1) The space was way too small for the number of people that were in the 
building. Since tickets were being sold at the door, I imagine it was 
very simple matter for Joe Doorguy to say "Yup, it's full in there," and 
pass the information along to the promoter(s). Shoving people in like 
cattle, combined with the comments to the police by the promoters(per 
Tony Rotundo) show the utter lack of respect for the participants,the 
space, and gives a good indication of what the promoter(s) motivation was/is.

2) It is not job of the police to be babysitters. A situation arose where 
there was fighting occuring outside of an overcrowed, unpermitted party.

To play devils' advocate for a moment, if I was a police officer 
dispatched to this area where there is a big fight going on, with 
hundreds of people hanging outside of a building pushing and shoving 
their way to get in, I would be inclined to remove the source of the 
crowds desire, that is, to get into that building. If the party had 
continued, the crowd would not have dispersed and the situation would 
remain a problem. Asking some of the people to leave is at the discretion 
of the police. When there is severe overcrowding, this is seldom an 
option. Remember there are several hundred of "them" and only a handful 
of police, in a dangerous situation. All the police have to go by in this 
situation was a brawl going on outside. Doesn't speak too well.... 

Having to have permits to throw a party sucks. For the most part it is just 
legalized extortion. Perhaps if the promoters were responsible the police 
could have overlooked the lack of permit(unlikely, but I have seen it 
happen SEVERAL times.) They weren't.  

If the promoters of Kundalini really wanted to make things right, they 
could have given refunds when people were leaving. Right now, the only 
people paying for their greed and disrespect are the people that paid 
their $20. Is that right?

I went with Vince, Wayne, their friend Holly, Tim (knucklehead)  and my

I did see Scott with his laminate and I got to meet JC.  I didn't know 
*anyone* there! I was also surprised to see it close at 5.  I've never 
been to a rave that closed that early!

I tried GHB for the first time last night.  It was GREAT!  No side 
effects.  One dose lasts about an hour, you feel a little strange for 
about an hour after that, and then...back to normal.  E on the other 
hand, although also a great rush, makes me feel like shit the next day.  

I don't even feel tired today..raring to go!!  Try it!

	I went to Tribal Fucked lastnight at the Richmond Armory, right 
next to the Richmond police station. If the music wasn't so good I would 
have had an awful time, but it wasn't good enough to allow Tribal Bunk to 
rip me off again, never again.

	The Richmond police REGULARS, about 10 of them, mingled with the
crowd the entire night, like metal on metal.

	I love it when I see a milatary base being used to throw a rave, 
I wait inpatiently for the time when tanks around the world are used for 
stages to dance upon, and the bon fires are fueled by AK47 & M16A2 rifle 
butts.

	I'm very curious just how much it really cost Tribal Trash to throw 
a party at this venue, my Army friends tell me the place should have gone 
for no more than $1000 - $2000 for a night max. Yet I paid $20 for my 
ticket, and got no where near what I got from Vision for $9.00 less.

	The party was so vibeless that I saw Tribal Gunk staff walking 
around blowing whistles in a vain attempt trying to get the crowd hyped 
up, unfortuately that's all there was, hype, no substance.

	The only phang good about this party I can say is they handed out 
blow pops to people in line, thanks, but I can buy my own.

	If you went, you were ripped off, sorry Tribal Bunt, but this 
raver is not gonna let you do it, or should I say give it to me, again.

I have a couple of things on my mind.  First off a question, when parties
like Tribal Funk have professional cops patroling them, do they pay the cops?
I imagine that it might be part of the rental aggreement with the space, 
but it just seems so stupid to pay people who are there to bust up the 
spirit and the vibe.  Maybe, promoters that know that there are going to 
be cops at their parties should declare the parties are drug free in advance.
Basically, to warn people of the emminent danger of police.  I know 
several people who have been harrassed and shakin down by cops at parties
in such venues.  It can be scarry as shit and unless you know the letter 
of the law about possesion you can easily be intimidated into letting a 
cop search and seize your ass.
My moral delema is  that I want to see Banco de Gaia, but I do not want 
to support the troc.  Their "security" force has a well earned reputation 
for using Physical force to deal with  problems.  Besides Doug's Organic 
account, one of my female friends was slapped in the face by them and 
when the police came they said that person did not work at the club.
To boycott or not to boycot the troc?

Dear Black Adder,

	You misread my message if you construed it as a defense of the 
Kundalini promoters.  You're right -- they should refund the money, ASAP.
	I stand by my other comments regarding the procedure the police 
should follow in situations like this and the double standard applied to 
raves vs. events sponsored by the authorities.

well, i'm bummed that tribal funk wasn't much fun.  oh well.


one thing to think about:  the venues for throwing large raves are 
basically nonexistant these days.  since the tagging and damage at the 
richmond civic center, the last big venue aside from that place in 
oakland where they had cyberfest, there really have not been any places 
to throw big, above-ground raves anymore.

which is why i love littler parties so much...we just have to keep the 
community strong and vital and we can party and dance together well into 
the next century, if we stay true to ourselves.

personally i would NOT go to a $20 party unless i could get in for free.  
and i would gladly work the door, tape the party, or whatever- because it 
would give me something to do for a while and make me feel more connected 
to the event.  that part is hella fun.

love,

Ann

Hello everyone,

I got a message on my machine saying that a planning meeting for the 
community full moon party -the New Full Moon has been one suggested name 
for it, please excuse the blatant vanity of this name- is going to be 
at MAD Monday night, starting at 10:30.  The voice on my machine was a 
little slurry- the tape's fault, not the caller's- and so can someone 
confirm this for me?  

Looking forward to it,

Ann

screw this darkness shit...

This party kicked ass. Awesome vibe ALL thru the nite. Great music. Great venue.
One of the best parties I've seen in San Francisco. Well worth $20. There were
cops there..
so what? ignore them and dance!

on wednesday, nov. 29 at 4:30pm there will be a rally and boom box party 
outside the Hall of Justice, 850 Bryant, protesting the police dept's 
delay in disciplining officers after the New Years Raid fiasco (and for 
only sending 6 officers to commission-level discipline) and FOR OUR RIGHT 
TO GATHER AND DANCE!

a little background: at 4:00am, Jan. 1, the SFPD and the State Alcohol 
BVeverage Control Bureau raided a private, peaceful AIDS benefit 
party/rave, beating and arresting guests, verbally abusing them with 
homophobic slurs, and confiscating thousands of dollars in donations and 
equipment, much of which has not been returned to this day.  And while 
the Office of Citizen Complaints (OCC), the city's civilian police 
oversight agency, sustained over 50 counts of misconduct against 21 
officers,m only 6 are being sent to the Police Commission for 
discipline.  (Chief Ribera can choose how he will discipline - or - the 
rest.) At least one of the officers involved,Sgt. Haggett, has a history 
of brutality, and has sicne killed an unarmed man in the Tenderloin.

Since the raid, the SFPD have kept up their tradition: police murder of 
African- Americans, harassment of youth, sex workers and homeless people, 
illegal cooperation with the INS, arrests of peacefu demonstrators, and 
continuing crackdowns on house and hip hop parties.

the rally wed will be a way for concerned people to voice our protest, 
connect with each other, and reassert our right to gather and dance.   we 
are encouraging people to bring boom boxes and radios, and will be 
transmitting house (Acieeeed!!!) via a transmitter.

the rally is from 4:30 to 5:30 and we are encouraging people to stay for 
the Police Commission meeting afterwards.

call Action for Police Accountability at 487-5437 for more information.

take care!

I don't think so.  I observed <10% of people dancing befor midnight, 
when things imporved slightly.  Compaire to 23:00 at Land Befor Time 
about 6 weeks ago, when Dutch was controlling the turntable.  People 
were going nuts, >98% were moving.  Nobody could stop.  Last night 
everybody was just standing around talking, waiting for a different DJ 
to try and get the party in gear.

The problem was the music.  It seemed to go nowhere.  

The light shown was not deployed til 23:30, even then, the techs were 
still adjusting mirrors for the laser.  The event had been going for 3 
hours, I don't see why we have to wait 3 hours befor they turn on the 
light show (We danced (or stood) under simple black lights until 
then).

By 01:00, the dewpoint was 85F, that did not help the larthagic crowd 
either.  The place had windows...all closed tight.  

Police walking around the place.  I want to be able to smoke pot 
openly. Not hide it like some criminal.

Truth is; you can't be sure about a even til it happens.  Thats what 
makes the more memorable times memorable.

     Autoerotic deaths: four cases.
   Pathology, 1994 Jul, 26(3):276-80.
       (UI:  95083282)

Abstract: We describe the circumstances and post mortem medical findings of 4
    unusual fatalities where death occurred during autoerotic practice. Three
    cases occurred in young to middle-aged men--hanging, electrocution and
    inhalation of a zucchini. The manner of death in each was accidental. The
    fourth case was an elderly man who died of ischemic heart disease,
    apparently whilst masturbating with a vacuum cleaner and a hair dryer.

Uhhh...

I don't want to sound spoilt or anything, but I went to Organic, and I 
was waiting in line, and the vibe I was getting was terrible.  Nobody was 
talking to anyone, and the whole attitude seemed really negative...I just 
left before the thing started.  Sorry.

Bah! It never ceases to amaze me what different people can get out of a
party. I don't know what party *you* were at, but the one I was at was really
fun! My friends and I had a great time at Tribal Funk. The stupid security
didn't bother me at all. I have seen much worse security at raves and clubs.
If you want to be doing illegal drugs out in the open, of course they're
going to say something! Get real. 

Last week, people were complaining that the Gateway party didn't have any
security & people got mugged, cars broken into, etc. Now we are complaining
about too much security.

I say stop complaining and deal with it. Check your attitude at the door. The
promoters can't seem to get good larger venues due to the idiots who tag. Is
that the fault of the promoters? I thought Tribal Funk did a good job, I
really liked the light show and I was dancing until 8 a.m. My biggest problem
was that it was too damn hot in there. But I used to go dancing in the 100
degree D.C. heat in buildings with no air conditioning. I'm used to sweating.

        Reply to:   RE>>Who are these DJ's 

Barbara Tucker is one of the promoters of Underground Network, who do the well known Wednesday night parties at the Sound Factory Bar in New York - that's the night that Little Louie Vega dj's there.  Out of this collaboration have come several house tracks produced by Little Louie with Tucker as the vocalist- the most well known is last year's "Beautiful People".  The newest single is "Stay Together", and if you like soulful NY house, it's a must have.  Little Louie played it at the last Wicked here in SF and kept it going for about 20 minutes - the crowd went off in a big way ...

Josh Wink has had a big hit over here in Europe with 'don't laugh' (it even made the top ten in
Holland)
Colonel Abrams was trapped a few years ago
Barbara Tucker is a singer, not a dj (unless I'm mistaken, but I don't think so)
The dj Pierre I know is from Chicago and has made some of the first acid-house 12"es
Terence Parker is pretty cool.

Am I reading this right?  You don't want to have to hide pot - an illegal
drug - you want to be able to smoke it in the open?  A rave (especially a
big one like TF) is a very public place...perhaps you might consider being a
little more discreet?  Whatever your complaints about a party, I don't think
not being able to smoke pot in the open should be among them.  And just to
defer argument, I'm not against pot - I smoke it myself occasionally - I'm
just against blatant drug use at parties...

What more can I say. If you have a high level of male high school testosterone
then you proberbly enjoyed this shitty, shitty party. I should have known, all
that fucking frisking bullshit does not a good party make. If you intend to
let that happen don't throw the party, it does not start the evening off good,
then to be told I couldn't take my water in ( but you could the empty bottle )
only to be given free water in there, derrrrrrrr. And getting greif from
fucking kids, I HATE THAT, next time I see 13 & 14 year olds in the line I'm
leaving, it proves to me that you don't care about the party, YOU WANT THE
MONEY. Again your party sucked and you lost at least 7 of us.

Didn't do any raving: I usually find big holiday weekends to be
hitormiss for finding parties with a decent vibe - mostly misses.

I got the Spiritual Trance CD, and it's good.  My interest in trance has
waned over the past year (though I keep a few Ethan tapes handy for
my fix.)  But I still get off on the Goa style, where rubbery synths are
allowed to carry the rhythm and the kick drums are less pounding: high
energy without the braindamage.

I bought it at BPM and so probably paid more for it than almost anyone
else ($25!). It says Mixed by Goa Gil, but unless his beat-matching
skills have recently increased from 0 to 100, I'd bet it
was mixed digitally.

Tuned into FLUX TV friday nite to see if DJ Keoki is as big an asshole
as everyone says he is.  Bigger, much bigger :(.  The show as a whole 
was very well put together with an intersting assortment of  videos and
interview segments.  I wish FLUX luck in getting a wider distribution.

So did anyone go to the Survival Research Labs (SRL) show?  Technological
entities built to destroy each other, as art, is OK by me.  Maybe
if warfare and murder was presented to us as an art form we wouldn't 
get so upset about it all the time.  Like those Blue Angels; they look
so silly just flying around making noise when they're supposed to be
blowing stuff up.  Give 'em to the SRL.

Speaking of technological entities; I know it's so *mainstream*, but
Toy Story was really great.  Just like the music we rave to - there's
so much more you can do when you reduce the role of humans in the
equation.   Two digital appendages up.  "To infinity and beyond!"

I just sent this review to Andrew T., but since you asked I'll send it to
the rest of the list:

it was ok. we got there a bit late so it was hard to find a spot where we
could see. we finally went up on the overpass where we could look down at
the event from above. it reminded me a bit of the final night at burning
man w/out the participatory feeling. much more of a sense of "show and
audience" - so it was alot less visceral.

dark, industrial music, lots of flamethrowers, a cool armored truck-thing
that seemed to be made from a streetsweeper, a big mardi gras like head
that eventually went up in flames like everything else. The most amusing
part for me was seeing this couple arriving home at the apt. building
accross the street from the event. Upon seeing what was going on, the woman
says to the man (in an angry tone), "That's it, I'm going BACK TO THE
OFFICE!!!!"

I came a way feeling that a good, old-fashioned, demolition derby would
have been more exciting, if not as "artistic".

cheers,
ek

I've taken that approach at last few parties I've been to, including the
last F&F, and found that the quality of the experience was not in any way
diminished. In fact, I found it to be quite exhilarating. Just the music,
the visuals, the great vibe being projected by the participants, and a
healthy dose of intense dancing provided the goods. In some ways I felt
more plugged into others at the party than when under the influence. I plan
to continue experimenting with this modus operandi...

Peace,
ek

Subject: The Importance of Tribal Funk Sucking
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

Would you have a cyber-quilt if two or more threads became interwoven?

Funny thing about things sucking.  I personally thought Tribal Funk SUCKED,
but that's only because it wiped me out and left me soaking in a hot bath
once I got home from it.  So I was bitter, but sweetly so. ;^)

My thoughts on TF:  By Tony

I very reluctantly went to Tribal Funk, and felt hypocritcal, because just
days before I said to you all that I was "Saving my 20s for a worthier
cause [than Kundalini]..."  Nonetheless I decided that I would give it the
benefit of my doubt, if not just benefit it with my $20.  I reminded myself
of the event held at the Richmond Civic Center about 8 months ago (Futur?)
that had great music, so I was focused more on that than any negative
vibrations I felt.  I had my negative-vibe shields honed and on full.  I
also made sure some friends would be there to share my angst should the
party suck, or rather, suck-bad.  ;^)

They frisked people at the door.  I guess if you're not carrying anything
(which I wasn't...well, really), it's nothing to worry about.  If you were
there to turn many people "on" then you would have cause for concern.  If I
went to do that (deal), I probably would've turned away before going in.  I
too have a problem with the whole frisking process (shows lack of trust),
but we didn't let that spoil our attitude.  We all got in unscathed.  As
for the line "that fucking frisking bullshit does not a good party make."
I guess it's better than someone getting shot, or a whole bunch of people
getting drunk.  So, I have to disagree.

Here's a logical gripe of the event:  "If you intend to
let that [frisking] happen don't throw the party, it does not start the
evening off good..."  How about this instead, if YOU see frisking at the
door...go home.

So someone wrote that they made you pour water out at the gate, but then
they let you keep the container and offered free water inside?  What are
you complaining about exactly?  Unless you had a bottle full of vodka (I'm
sure their motive for making people pour out their liquids was due to
smuggled alcohol) or mushroom tea or something, why be bitter?  Lack of
alcohol helped save the event most likely.

Yes there was a strong youth presence, but because there was no alcohol,
the majority of "attitudes" seemed in check.  Fred Thorton wrote that only
"10% of people dancing before midnight...[sic]" he very well may have been
at a different event, for we started dancing immediately, and we weren't
alone.  Weird how one person sees it differently than so many others.
Granted, maybe at another event, six weeks ago, when Dutch was spinning,
more people were dancing before midnight, but shit man, that's a pretty
tough comparison.  Comparisons are odious, anyway.  People danced and
danced hard, the whole night.

The sound was great, the music was great most of the time.  The lasers
didn't start until late, but I gotta laugh that Fred was upset about just
standing under black lights for three hours.  You know Fred, there was a
line of people standing under star light waiting to get in and enjoy the
event, rather than nit-pick it.  The lights can certainly add to a party,
but come on, are they so vital that you can't have fun without them?  I can
just imagine you standing there waiting for the laser to come on so you can
finally have a good time.  Hmmm?  And once they did get going, weren't they
fucking amazing!?

I heard people were in line for a while, but it was well controlled, and
the promoters did say very clearly on their VM that it would be
one-in/one-out when it got full.  In fact their voice mail was very forward
and clear as to price and what to expect.

It got hot, but there was a very welcomed outdoor chill area (npi), you
don't find that at all huge events, there were windows open in the
stairwells ( I saw them/stood by them Fred), and there was an upstairs
"viewing deck" that wasn't too hot.  What can you do about the heat?  They
had fans going as well.

The police were there, and I too have a sour taste for police being at a
party, but they hung out upstairs a lot telling people to put out smokes
which shouldn't have been smoked inside anyway.  I didn't see anyone get
busted.  I think there were ample areas where one could smoke-out without
getting hassled.  I saw quite a bit actually.

"I love it when I see a milatary base being used to throw a rave..."  B.
Darkness.  Seemed more like a high school gym than an armory.

I heard that the cops almost didn't let them have the party, sometime
around Wed., which is pretty late in the game, and in order to have it,
they had to hire cops.  To the tune of $4,500, but that's just what I
heard.  That's not a small amount to add to the budget two days prior to
the event.  There's no way in hell the venue went for $1,000 - $2,000
Brian!  No fucking way.

I won't harangue much longer.  The point is, I went with a bunch of friends
and we all had a great time.  We didn't let petty things get us down.  We
maintained high spirits and gave off lots of great energy.  The fact that
there were younger people there, well, had they been drunk maybe that would
have really sucked, but for the most part they weren't too bad.  But who
are you -- This person:  >And getting greif from
fucking kids, I HATE THAT, next time I see 13 & 14 year olds in the line I'm
leaving, it proves to me that you don't care about the party, YOU WANT THE
MONEY.< -- to be so fucking selfish!?  It's an open party pal, you gotta
deal with kids, adults, cops, promoters, and everyone else there.  You
would see it much different if you were 18.  Can you say "Generation gap?!"

It sounds to me like a handful of people went soly to pick the party apart.
Feel free, but I will say that it was well organized, had good sound, good
music, good lights and free fruit at the end.  For a party that size, you
have to expect security, heat, frisking, and lots of different people to
party with, if you can't deal with that, then I suggest you stay home.  I
was not at all disappointed and that made me very happy.

Thanks for not ripping me off...

Tony

P.S.  Brian D. I saw you there, and I must say, you looked very, very happy
dancing in the arms of a woman.  You certainly didn't look as upset as your
post would make one think. They were giving massages, thought of you then
too.  Thought that would make you happy that they were promoting
body-healing.  No?

i'd like to hear from people who used to take drugs at raves,
then went totally straight up and quit taking all drugs, and were
then subsequently experience raves in the new mode.

that's what i'm going to give a shot to, i'll let you know how
it goes, if it goes, if it's even a possibility.

	     I arrived at the SRL show site (Beal St & Folsom) at 7:30.
	There were about 50 people in line, within 15 minutes there were
	about 500.  I knew someone working the gate - she said there were
	3000 tickets for the event.  It looked like it pretty much sold 
	out as I overheard some of the ticket sellers say they had run out
	of tickets....
	     The site was really cool - at the base of a huge 
	embankment and between the base of the Bay Bridge and and an 
	old concrete street bridge.  The embankment had various  figures
	and a little house with a "Party" sign constructed on it.  The 
	flat area before the embankment was covered with the usual SRL
	suspects: about 20 large crawling machines, flamethrowing machines, 
	catapults and a huge paper machier torso and head that could be bent 
	and pivoted.  There were also several other animated paper mache 
	figures.  The site was illuminated with large banks of floodlamps.
	There were bleacher seats set up that could hold a thousand or more
	people and a steel pipe barricade to separate the audience from
	the machinery.
	    Promptly at 8 tickets went on sale and people were admitted.
	The show began right at 9 with all the animal-like crawling machines
	converging while various flame throwing machines provided the proper
	ambiance.  There were huge banks of speakers set up that emitted
	deafeningly LOUD ominous droning and roaring sounds with occasional 
	voice samples that sounded like clips from news broadcasts ("6 
	people were killed in an explosion today").  Huge plumes of smoke 
	would rise from some of the machines - especially this tremendous 
	flame thrower that looked like it was built from an industrial
	ventilation blower.  One person had this machine that would send
	showers of sparks about 100 feet into the air across the site -
	it looked like a high voltage cabinet that would charge up and 
	vaporize a piece of metal that was placed into a small drum that

After reading all the post on tf I decided to put my 2 liras in.

I went there pretty much expecting an over-hyped event, my wonderfully warm
greeting was by a secruity guard " put your hands in the air" was the first
thing I heard before I was frisked, not a great first impretion!  But fuck
there was nothing else I could find on sat. and I was sapposed to meet up
with a verry nice girl there(she never showed).  We hooked up with some
nice fellas from Long Beach, got stoned, had to stash the pipe as 2 cops
rolled by commenting on how nice our crack smoke smelled( no, nobody was
smoking any crack, I guess they were more stupid then they looked and
did'nt seem to care anyway)  By ~5 I really got into it, most of the thugs
had left and there was a nice vibe till it ended at 8  DJ Dan kicked ass
with some breakbeat ~11-12. Does any on know who the live performance was
by? she brought the fuckin house down.  I could'nt belive it but by the
morning I was pretty intoit!  Would i prefer a smaller more underground
rave? hell yes, but unfortunately they seem to be getting scarce lately. 
By the way a few months ago i went to an out-of-sight,  it was at the small
brick place on howard, no lazers, no visuals, no special lighting just
MUSIC!!! and a mass frenzy of groovin-sweatin party people and it was
PERFECT!! thats really all you need-good music and good vibe.  Promoters
need to get back to basics! thats how it started in the first place.  Even
though for me TF was pretty good I could never go to one like that every
weekend the scene would really be played out fast.  In sum I was plesantly
suprised but I'll always prefere the underground.

P.S If the capcity of that lacal was 1500 which they said on the info line,
and it filled (which it did) thats-1500x20.00=$30,000  thats ALOT of moolah
where the fuck did it all go?

I do have to agree, the vibes in line were pretty bad, and it took a 
bit to get things going, but once things got going, so did the vibes! I 
myself had a great time, although I called it an early evening at 3:30 
am thus missing the come-down set.  The cops that were wandering around 
didn't strike me as being too offensive (as cops go) compared to what 
it sounded like at Kundalini.  They just wandered around flashing their 
lights about every now and then, and I myself didn't see anybody get 
busted, and at least the party was allowed to continue!  Could have 
been way worse than it was.  And I did manage to find one sfraver 
there, purely by coincidence actually, no badges or anything else 
involved.  Very cool guy.  
By the way, after I went outside the party, while I was waiting for my 
ride, a fire engine drove up and parked for a while right out front.  
Does anybody know what this was about?  I missed the bleeding person, 
so the fire engine had left before that happened.  It roared up with 
lights flashing, and then just appeared to sit there for a while, and 
then disappeared.  Just wondering what that was all about.

I told you at Organic I'd try and hunt you down via SFRaves, and here I 
am!  Remember me?  Me and my friend Sam met you there, and I found out 
that you read SFRaves.  You had a pipe through your hair!  So just 
thought I'd try to track you down, and see if you respond.  Hope to

I have been on the 'rave a week' plan for all summer. I took E nearly every
time I went out. Yes, I was having an awesome time(!), but I figured that I
would start to tone it down a bit and get back to work during the
fall/winter, so I have been going out sober since F&F and having a good
time not on drugs.

I went to Tribal Funk with the intention of taking E. When we got there at
around 11:30, I immediately started dancing my self into a frenzy, and I
was having a *great* time. But at around 2am I realized how exhausted my
body was from going to Organic Friday night, I decided that I would crash
pretty hard if I took E simply to stay dancing all the way though until
8am. (This would have most likely affected my being at SRL Sunday night I
figured).

So I decided it would be best not to take E just for the speedy effects.
(Unfortunately, this fatal decision to stay sober would later leave me
hopelessly out-of-phase from the drugged masses...)

Then, the last person (not yet on drugs) in the group I was with (who, by
the way, were all on drugs) told me (making me feel really stupid) "Don't
you realize that these parties are *designed* for taking drugs?!?!"

That one stopped me cold in my tracks.( Another in a long list of Saturday
night vibe-killers for me...)

Now ever since Saturday night around 2:00am I have been wholly consumed in
analyzing what I have been doing while raving all this time? If it really
is so drug-focused, I feel like my bubble's been burst!

Raving was a special, magical, spiritual event when I went out, and the
drugs always seemed secondary, although still important as a catalyst to
pass into the 'next dimension'.

I mean, when I was taking E, it was to turn a great party into an awesome,
magical, unforgettable experience. If I am *supposed* to take E to turn
something like Tribal Funk from what it was (all specific critique
withheld) into a great rave, and parties like Tribal Funk were indeed
*designed* for drug useage, maybe I should not be raving, as I never want
to go "to a place just to take drugs" called a rave much in the same way I
would not plan a vacation to Amsterdam just to "find a place to smoke
opium", etc. It's just TOO drug focused for my comfort.

Mind you, at TF, all my friends that thought it was an great party were all
on drugs. I had 'only' a good time, and I was in the 'not on drugs'
category. I never want drugs to be the #1 focus of a party or my life.

Don't worry, if what I've written sounds confusing, you should have been
inside my brain the last 36 hours while I have thought about all of this.

I hope I figure it out.

The upside:

The first thing that made me think that there was hope for Organic is that
it was NOT AT THE TROCADERO. I have had parties there before, and as long
as it's not rave-related (mine was industrial/bondage related so they loved
me! Hee-Hee) :-) they are OK to deal with. But the punk management and the
punk security definitely seem to deplore and loathe the rave community and
the rave scene. When I was there the last three years every Wednesday for
Bondage-A-Go-Go, there was always adequate ventilation and free water. At
the last Organic, they *turneed off the air conditioning, took away the
free water, and charged $2+ for bottled water. The whole place was WAY
oversold and it was like a sauna there!!! As far as I can tell, the Troc
was saying "fuck you, ravers!" since the next night the A/C seemed to be
working OK again and the free water & cups had magically returned for a
punk show I was at.

Anyway, I went to Organic, and the first time we drove past it, I noticed
the high ganster-kidz to raver ratio, and I got a bad feeling. We parked
our cars and got in line anyway, and the people in line and BIG security
guards frisking at the door freaked me out. But we had our own group there
(Vince, Amy Starkey, et. al.) and decided that we'd have fun anyway!

Well, we did, and I'll tell ya' inside we spent all of our time dancing,
dancing, dancing. It was great! Carlos, Jeno, and Simon all played great
music and we even spent time dancing w/ Carlos behind the front speakers.
He is a maniac!

The downside:

THE PRICE (15.00) WAS NOT ON THE INFO LINE.

Water was $2.50. Gee thanks. And that was on top of $15.00 to get in to
what should have been a $10 party.

The security guards were searching everybody going in, and once we were in
the security was always underfoot, even walking THROUGH the dance floor
with their flashlights on. But to tell you the truth, none of the ravers
took them seriously, and we kinda got used to them. I started waving to
them as they walked by after a while.

That was the first party I have been to where I was FRISKED at the door,
and I am kinda feeling after that I don't WANT to go to a party where the
promoters actively attract the KIND of people that you HAVE to frisk going
into a party.

TRIBAL FUNK (partial):

Anyway, the same crap happened at Tribal Funk. Being frisked AGAIN at the
door there makes me want to tell the promoters of both parties to not sow
their promotional seed (flyers) so far and wide that they attract the kind
of customers that have to be frisked and begged 'not to tag'.

Tag? What the hell? Who do *we* even know that tags? Why are they coming to
raves? Should't they just stay home and defend their block from the rival
gangs? Do I have a bad attitude about this?

Now just think about it if we HAD to frisk you on your way into a Friends
and Family? What if we had to BEG you on the info lines not to tag the
walls with your gang crap when you were there? What's wrong wigh this
picture? Get it?

enough said,
-w

I had a good time - mind you it was certainly no Friends & Family, but I 
was in a group of 4 other people, and even though we didn't know anyone 
else at the party, we had our own little party going on.  We simply chose 
to have a blast and we did! :)

To: nw-raves@hyperreal.com
Subject: EBN, Banco de Gaia info

EBN stands for "Emergency Broadcast Network"
(http://www.tvtrecords.com/bands/ebn.html). You might have seen their work in
the Electric Carnival tent of the Lollapalooza '94 tour where they had
several Macs running with their own midi-based video controller.
   EBN comes out of the heads of Joshua Pearson and Gardner Post who met at
the great artschool Rhode Island School of Design.
   EBN started in 1991 during the Persian Gulf War, exploring seemingly
random received information from cable-tv, music and other sounds, turning
them into high-energy music videos.
   Important part of their performance is throwing a visual and musical
information-overload at their audience. I haven't seen their show yet but
this is how the bands' press release describes EBN's multi-media sensory
assault: "Multiple video screens overflow with thousands of broadcast images
crushed into a high-speed image overload. "Host anchorperson" Josh Pearson
talks, raps, mumbles and screams (sometimes through a megaphone) as he
interacts with the video while standing on a huge robotic podium bristling
with TV monitors, lights, and lasers; EBN DJs and VJs cut and scratch sounds
and images live using turntable, video switchers, and Macintosh computers
running special new VideoSampler software."
   Their current CD, Telecommunication Breakdown (TVT Records), has audio and
video on it which can be played in both your CD player and (PC and Mac)
CD-rom drive. It also contains an interactive Macintosh only floppy disk with
images, liner notes, group history, lyrics, merchandising.

   Banco de Gaia is Toby Marks (UK), an ambient megalomaniac
(http://www.obsolete.com/~banco/ ). He has a training in jazz, bhangra and
electronic music. He loves to use exotic sounds, like on his album Maya
(Middle East) and his current Last Train to Lhasa (Tibet, China, Albania,
North Africa), mixed with hip-hop and house-beats. Sure, ethnocentric
dance-music is pretty en vogue nowadays, and cultural piracy can be
embarressingly painful. But fortunately,  Toby sincerely tries to raise
awareness and political support for the endangered Tibetan culture, by
showing way more respect for the original material than many of his less
gifted peers.

Dear All;

	Where did all the money go, hmmm, know that's the ? of the hour,
and one that's also none of my bussiness, but I to am certainly curious.
Tony I most respectfully say, that I believe your wrong with regard to the
price of the venue, I had Army Reserve Personnel with me, they hated the
rave, and thought it was to much for an Army Building, Tony an Armory
Hall, in down town Richmond, THINK about it, where they have like 
Weddings, & Corporate Bankquets, cheap, cheap, cheap. But I encourage you 
to call them tomorroe as I am, just to give TF the benefit of the doubt, 
and just to see how much it costs really, please post your result as I will.

>P.S If the capcity of that lacal was 1500 which they said on the info line
> and it filled (which it did) thats-1500x20.00=$30,000  thats ALOT of moolah
> where the fuck did it all go?

	If they had to pay $4,500 for the cops to be there just because
it's next to the police station, then TF, are fools!!! $4,500 could have
gone toward booking a really hot outta towner. They could have hired
Brinks or the Hells Angles for less. I'm not gonna support parties throw
by people who can't manage them properly, and having it end up costing the
scene more. Martin got the Fuckin Sound Factory for Vision, along with
some of SF's finest, and had 11 DJ's, and it was $11, before 11 o'clock.
How ccan you say this party was well managed. There where also arrests, at
least one I witnessed for drugs. 

	TF are; Communion, Friend's & Family, & Gateway wanna be's. JUst
because they bring in a massage therapist doesn't make the party. Cruel
World does it all da time, and would you go to one of theirs? My happiness
at TF has everything to do with the fact, yes, that I was with the most
beautiful womyn in the world, no doubt there. However, that happiness has
nothing to do with TF or the rave, but everything to do with her = >. I don't
no why I'm not doublely pissed cause, I bought her ticket as well. SHe's
from Germany, and was very upset with the "negativity of the people who
attended, why is no one dancing, & no one seems to care", were just some
of her quotes for the night. 

	We had a good time no matter what in true raver form, but left 
only to find our car had been blocked in on 4 sides by those kind, loving 
respectful people you were talking about, with the Police & TF refusing 
to do anything about it, so me and 4 others sat their for 2 hours waiting 
for those people to leave, and guess what; we could get back in without 
paying, you guessed it, another $20/each @ 5AM.

	Yeah these folks are real kind & lovings(sarcasum flowing). IWth 
friends like that who needs Cruel World. Well, I'm glad to see that 50% 
of the respondents seemed to have a good time, I really mean that. I'm 
sure TF did everything they could to throw a great party, less hireing a 
consultant for resource/greed management.

	Well anyway I look forward to seeing the multiple respondes with 
regard to the price of the venue for a night, which should be public info.

re: what wayne said

I think the terminology "these parties were designed to take drugs at" is 
the problem...from a strange perspective look at it in terms of a tribal 
setting.  Certain tribal evetns were designed to bring you closer to a 
trance/meditation state or a deity or yourself and often this was 
achieved by taking drugs.  A question you may ask yourself in this day 
and age since circumstance is nowhere near alike to tribal cultutres, is 
whether or not you think raves are designed for something?  I help 
organize raves because I realize the potential that danicng holds for 
self renewal and spiritual cleansing that society doesn't offer very 
often these days.  I have achieved thru drugs and not thru drugs so for 
me it is not a wquestion of whether the rave is designedto take drugs at 
but how I want to achieve what I think what raves are designed for.

love drenalin

ps sorry if this confused i'm trying to beat being timed out =)

All I can say is that it's just terrible to let one person's dumb 
opinion (in my dumb opinion!) about the existence of these parties to 
ruin your whole perspective on it.  I think it's quite sad that he sees 
them as just an excuse to do drugs.  I agree that it's pretty effective 
in creating a door to another dancier dimension, but he's obviously not 
seeing beyond that door, when there's so much more cool shit on the 
other side!  Don't let his near-sighted point of view change the way 
you feel about it all, I'm pretty new at all this (Organic was my first 
"Offical Rave"), but I've seen a lot of people in my time who seemed to 
think of life in general as an excuse to do drugs, with no sight to 
beyond it, and it's pretty pathetic.  Don't get me wrong, I thoroughly 
enjoy my drugs myself!  Had a killer time at Organic on E.  But it 
seems to me it's just common sense to know there's usually more than 
just the door there, and I think you know that, unlike that other guy.

Hi all.  I KNOW this is OLD news, but I have been lurking and feel I 
should contribute once in a while.  I too was at Chrysalis and it was 
overall a very POSITIVE experience for me.  It was my first "smaller" 
rave, as the last one I went to was a LARGE party at the San Diego Sports 
Arena (during the 4.0+ earthquake!) with SVEN VATH spinning as the 
headliner.  This Chrysalis was a COMPLETE 180 from the last one, in fact 
I am probably going to goto this one too.

The vibe was GREAT!  We got there at 1am and stayed til 7am, not that 
long but still I had a good time.  The Music was EXCELLENT- although I am 
too new to know WHO was spinning WHAT.  The smart lights were cool, but 
the lazers were something to be seen (ok, it wasn't LAZERIUM...).  With 
TWO large projection screens I found myself in a total trance with the 
music, and the chill room was a WARM friendly place.  However, I am a bit 
new so I didn't really see anyone I knew.  So, I hope to goto more 
parties like that in the future and get to meet some of you out there in 
net land...

THe fruit and candy were good ideas to have out there.  Good planning, as 
this was the first time I've been to one of these where RE-CHARGING will 
not cost you the price of a movie!

I am just wondering how some of you experienced ones out there managed to 
not get tired quickly.  Also, how do you get over the natural inhibitions 
of meeting a bunch of new people?  Perhaps as I get more familiar with 
the scene it will all fall into place...

Oh, but the way, I DID bring EARplugs...and do they ever help!!!

A bit about me:(intro)

22.  Graduated from San Francisco State (B.A. in Radio & Television, 
minor in Bus. Admin.).  This summer I worked as a camera operator for 
this Nickelodeon-type game show we taped at Great America.  This month, 
the job ended and I am now temping at Adaptec (and making MORE than I was 
previously!) while I find another TV/video production job...  Like 
concerts/live shows (Stone Roses, Catherine Wheel, 
Trashcan Sinatras, Chapterhouse, Course of Empire, Pixies, Northside, 
Wild Swans, Ocean Blue...Swervedriver and Bailter Space are some fave 
bands I like).  Also ski and am getting into surfing.  Like active 
lifestyle...

Computer: 100mhz Pentium w/ 16megs and 800meg HD, CD-ROM (ANY 
recommendations for GOOD games out there???  I KNOW of "Full Throttle" 
and "Descent"... 14.4K modem.  ANYONE know of where I can get a 28,8K for 
around $150???

The WEB page here is GREAT!  AWESOME job on the graphics!!!!
I will go there often!  

Well, sorry to have bored you to death!  So much for my .02

i am fine with everyone having their own definitions of music ...i just
want to clear up what is commonly called happy hardcore..

happy hardcore (also called 4-beat) is a form of dance music from england
which came out of the old techno scene and the '92 breakbet scene...it has
a fast, usually breakbeat, and uses a lot of super sped up piano tunes and

Sorry to jump into this so late...

What's "appropriate" for this list is a pretty broad subject - certainly, 
in my opinion, talking about san francisco city politics is fine, talking 
about timewave zero and 2012 is borderline but not wrong, etc.  it used 
to be a bigger issue for me, but then I started using better mail reading 
tools, which allowed me to do lots of nice sorting and threading and 
such.  I now read SFRaves mail about once every week or so - I just went 
through 350 messages in less than an hour.  I'd encourage other people to 
do the same. 

However, better mail filtering is no excuse for making sfraves noisier... 
please, before you decide to send a message, consider for a second that 
your message is duplicated and sent to (currently) 422 people's 
mailboxes.  

Finally, anyone who relies *solely* upon SFRaves for their social 
interactions and news reports and such are in my opinion asking too much 
from the list, and should consider, er, broadening their interest 
horizon.  Does a "virtual community" mean that membership is exclusive?  
I certainly hope not, and that's not why I created the list.

Well, that's sorta like saying all 15-year-olds are entitled to drive 
their cars any way they like on the public roads.  No... not if we care 
about preserving our "fine anarchy", to paraphrase Mark Pesce.

Am *I* reading you right, Jim?  You don't think the potential for getting 
busted and thrown in jail for the simple act of smoking an herb you 
purchased honestly to increase your enjoyment of the evening should be a 
concern at parties?  

And are you really against blatant drug use at parties, or only illegal 
drug use?  What would you do if you saw someone guzzling coffee?  And if 
this isn't a problem, please explain exactly how pot is so much different?

Your bud,

 Drugs: My normal rave mode is without the enhancement of illegal substances.
        Trances are shorter but more "special". I can chill out when I want
        to - some drugs keep a person hyper when rest is what's called for.

 Alcohol: If the event is in an establishment that normally is a bar or
          nightclub, then I usually buy one alcoholic drink to encourage the
          management - and I like a drink occasionally. While booze has
          some pain-reducing qualities , it also dulls my "vibe" for an
          hour or so.  

 That's my opinion - Larry Ching / larryc@netcom.com

There are tribal cultures in which by way of initiation a person is given
some sort of drug substance and has a vision or see's the light or increases
his/her level of consciousness for a short time.  After the experience they
are expected to find out how to get back there on thier own, without the
drug.  If they can make it, then they get to go on to the next step and
repeat the process to the next level.  I believe in this methode myself.  I
believe that drugs can nock you out of your mundane existance and show you
something more....but then it's up to you.  The drug will only work to a
certain extent.  I've battled with this issue for a few years now, having
found the existance of higher states of consciousness through drugs, relying
on them to get me there, then being fucked by them for not figuring out that
it was up to me not them to get me there.  Sober experience have always been
more fulfilling, and seem to impact me more.  It's easy to deny somthing
magical if it was drug induced.  Al of this ofcourse is IMHO.

Been thinking about going to see  EBN/Banco D'Gaia at the Troc this
Saturday.  Saturday is also the Troc's "Ritual" night where
people in "fetish" attire get in for $5 and the "kinky club"
upstairs is only open to those appropriately dressed. On these nites
they spin hard industrial ala ministry, NIN, etc. stuff I'm no longer
into.  According to the Troc's web site, Ritual and Banco are
both happening that nite.  

Does anyone have any clue if there are different DJs planned for
that night, or am I going to have to listen to Al Jourgenson
scream at me while I wait around for Banco D' Gaia?  I guess for
only $7 I could put up with some nostalgia.

I have had good times w/o use of anything.  I have had bad times w/o the 
use of anything.  Some folx I know use enhancers so that they need not 
see the ugliness that surrounds them.  I've heard as many reasons as 
excuses.  to me it's all good.  If you want to or if you want to avoid 
it, I see no difference.  What irks me however, are people , especially 
young first-timers, who are neither emotionally or mentally ready to use 
any form of drug.  It matters little, could be cofee, booze, or another 
psycho-stimulant/depressant.  Nothing is funnier/tragic than seeing some 
fool kid loose all marbles and jump at the turntables, or seeing people 
walk around talking to themselves in a deep hallucinatory state, or 
seeing people brush off bugs and shit that ain't really there, or seeing 
someone go apeshit and start swinging at fences.

At events I've been to (mostly these days 21+), shit is usually under 
control, although 21+ have thier stupid problems too like taking too much 
GHB (what is a little for some folx is plenty for others; tricky stuff) 
anfd having to go to the hospital for respitory arrest, or cardiac 
flutter/arrythmia.  Seeing older folx not know when enough is too much as 
they mix all kinds of drugs w/ booze and end up quite dead (like the guy 
a few years back at the End Up).

I say as long as you are educated, and make rational decisions about what 
you do/don't do, everything can end up just fine.

Things have changed from the old days:
It seems now people HAVE to crack-on to have a good time.  I know many 
don't, but many more do.  It's almost as if it's a pre-requisite to have 
a good time.  Before it was more of a communal thing, trying to catch a 
vibe spread it, and share it.  These days it seems like the drugs create 
a vibe instead of the music, and as such, you'll find lower energy levels 
at events where drugs are scarce.  Kinda sad, shit used to be used to 
augment, now either the music is so bad, or people are so jaded, that 
anything other than reality is a blessing.  Yes, I long for the old 
days.  I'm glad I was there for 'em.

Until they are brought back, I'm down with tha green.

Out,
John

BSP - Charlotte and I will be playing at Butterfly the second week of 
Dec.  It's on a Tues., stop by, have a beer (yes, it's 21+), and say 
hello.  Also get a chance to hear the Baroness stomp some hedz! (fyi- 
CHarlotte == Baroness).

I often try to do it sober, getting my energy from the DJs and the people.
 But sometimes I carry a little something along just in case it's not there,
and I don't feel like leaving yet.

Okay, I'm new and I didn't wait two weeks before posting, but...
Since I saw others posting about their radio shows, I figured it would be 
okay :)
I spin techno of all sorts (trance, trip-hop, jungle, rave...) on 
Saturday mornings (at least until the end of the quarter) on KDVS 90.3fm 
which can be heard in most of the Western Sacramento Valley.  
Peace
Keep Vibin'

Question one:  Has anybody ever heard of an S.F. place called the End 
Up?  Had heard of it, wondered if it was any good, and what it was all 
about.

Question two:  I remember sometime in the past there was mention of SF 
Ravers having some means to identify themselves at parties, buttons or 
something.  I can't remember what it was.  I do know that I'd like to 
find more of you, I only found one of you at Organic, although 
obviously there were more hiding in the woodworks!  I'd also like to 
obtain one of these mythical identifiers myself, should they exist.  
Let me know!

There have been a couple different sfraves buttons and badges.  I think a
couple might still be floating around for those who are interested.

As for the End Up . . . *well* . . . A legendary place, of which I barely
know even the beginning of the legend.  My understanding is that it's
been one of the premier gathering spots for the gay community south of
Market for 20 years and maybe longer.  It supposedly "closed" earlier
this year but except for maybe a weekend or two they haven't missed a
beat.  I've only been there a couple of times but it's definitely a
unique place, right by the elevated freeway at 6th & Harrison.  

I'm sure there are plenty of people here on sfraves who really have the
stories about the End Up!

	Once upon a time, people went to parties to be with people, in an
environment where no one was going to tell them their way of doing
whatever they were doing was evil and wrong (as long as one took care of
themselves and was open and kind). At that time and place, people went for
different reasons I would think, but I think the main pull of raves
thorughout the world (or at least the parties I am talking about), was the
music and a vibe which centered around the people who went and each
one of those people contributing what they could while pulling their own
weight in their community.
	Then somehow that all got fashionable and people started going to 
be seen and look cool and do the drugs they could find and the energy of 
the firt group got diluted a bit. Then more people started citing drug 
use as evil (illegal drug use I suppose) instead of the 
irresponsible/false behavior that accompanied use by many of this newer 
group of people. I do not think the focus of all raves was 
everlet's-go-eat-some-drugs (although I think some of the sound 
systems/promoters out there both in the past and in this day do have that 
attitude, but I think they are spin-offs of what I consider the 
underground party scene or festies, or whatever it is that I consider 
raves which happens to not be parties like Cool World and Funky Techno 
Tribe massives or Ghost tribe productions parties which charge $20 or 
gather the "cool" people).
	People go for all different reasons, they have and will. Why worry
about the evidence of problems and not complain about the problem
themselves if we are going to complain. If people dislike aspects of raves
such as people changing during the course of the night into huggable,
friendly humans (but then return to grumpy asshole in the morning) then
dislike the fact that some people abuse things (whether it be drugs or the
environment they are in) and not the things they abuse...

hey folks,
On the subject of haus/techno radio shows, I thought that I should mention
that my friend does a show on Thursday nights from10-whenever.
He does it on Radio Libre 103.3, Radio Libre is a pirate station in the 
Mission.  It is easiest to tune in to it in the mission but it does reach 
out into other hoods.  He is always looking for guests to come and play
or tapes that he can play.  He does not limit the show to dance music, so 
he is also interested in ambient/dub.  If anyone is interested in hooking 
up with him, send me something any I will get you his phone number.

Of course it's a concern!  But the fact that u know it's illegal and the
fact that there are police in sight should maybe guide your use of it.  I
don't see pot as a *necessity* when raving and I don't think anyone should
consider smoking pot at a party an inherent *right*.

Good distinction...I'm against blatant, illegal drug use.  I think people
openly consuming drugs at raves only provides ammunition for those who would
put a stop to parties altogether.  No, I don't see guzzling coffee as a
problem, because coffee isn't illegal.  From the tone of your msg, you seem
to imply that I am against pot, which isn't true.  I think ppl should merely
be more discreet in their consumption of it (or indeed of any illegal
substance) in public, at a rave.  I know many, myself included, see raves as
an "oasis" of sorts from everyday problems, and like to augment their
experience with drugs, but the fact is everyone is still subject to the law
when they are in a rave.  One shouldn't *expect* and *demand* the _right_ to
smoke pot at a party - they should instead always be discreet about their
consumption or consume their drugs somewhere else...at least until laws get
changed and drugs become better tolerated by society in general, as in
Holland (or even as here in Vancouver, BC, where possession of small
quantities of pot won't be prosecuted)

I am very sorry to drag this out any longer than necessary, but after sooo
much stuff about Kundalini being bad, I had to post this.  I will never go
to Kundalini again, but I learned this back in June or July when I went
then.  It sucked then: too expensive, too crowded, etc.  I was wondering
if anyone else went way back then, and why, after that experience would
anyone go AGAIN?  Please post to me off the main mailing list, as I don't
want to prolong this thread any longer than necessary.  Thanks. 
Having learned my lesson before,

  Hello out there all in computerland,
    
    I went to MAD lastnight for the first time, and I just wanted to
say....MAD RULES!!  O.K, it's like this, have you ever had a dream where
your hanging out at a place.  Your not sure where you are, but your there
observing.  As you look out into a crowd people you sense warmth and energy.
Your eyes continue to look around and a freindly person comes over to share
their energy with you.  You don't know that person, or you do, it doesn't
seem to make a difference because your only in the moment, and in the momemt
one  can onlyfeel, not judge or remember.  You're a child, you're smiling,
you don't understand anything,... exept you have no desire to.  There is a
glow around everything.  Children.  You find yourself emerged with children.
They're playing, laughfing, dancing.  You start to run around and laugh.
There are no parents... no teachers...only children. 
        Thank you.

        Well, personally speaking, i think that rave culture and the use of
psychedelics (including E) have a symbiotic relationship. It wouldn't be
what it is without drugs (please don't flame me yet!). The rapid evolution
of this scene, and the way it focuses itself, the music, the clothing, the
ideas that are generated from within these 'places' are all influenced
greatly by those who do drugs. Now, that is not to say that one HAS to do
drugs. I know of many straight-edge people who are a lot more vibey and
'with it' than those who partake and this, i think is partially due to the
'contact high' effect and learning and communicating with those who are
on/have done drugs or maybe they're JUST BORN WAY COOL! :)
        Basically, it's a culture that is heavily influenced by the use of
some drugs, but it's not necessary to do drugs all the time to get the full
experience of it. Personally, the experience of doing E at a party for my
first time put the whole culture in a completely different light. Like,
"aha!" and this is a good thing, but not a path you have to take every
weekend. :)
        Remember: 'vibe' is something that is within you already that drugs
bring out, it's the 'easy' way, but there are other ways of tapping in to
that kind of energy :) Like Rick said, all of this is IMHO, hee hee.
        peace,
        brad

ps-->In general, when i look at my involvement with anything (raves, drugs,
people, technology, whatever) i ask whether it complexifies the connection
that i have both to others and to my 'higher self' or whether it or
*separates* my self from others or my 'good side' :) It's a tough call but
a good general rule that i do my best to follow.

>Question one:  Has anybody ever heard of an S.F. place called the End 
>Up?  Had heard of it, wondered if it was any good, and what it was all 
>about.

well.. the End Up is sort of a mix of 2 places really... a place where one
"ends up" on a Sat/Sun morning...as well as a place where one can place
one's "end" up .. if u get my gist :)  As far as most ravers are concerned, I
suppose, it's a place to go to hang out with every other bugger that stayed
out the whole nite before, and drink Rolling Rocks (that's the best they have:)
and listen to deep house at 7AM.  However, at that time, besides fuckers like
me who look basically wrecked after a nite out.. u also have people who actually
get up at that time... looking fresh and wonderful.. . and venture down there to
spend the day dancing. (This is especially true on Sunday) Took me a long time 
to figure out why those people looked so damned good after a nite out, and we
all
looked so shitty... they had just gotten up!!

On a warm summer Sunday morning it's a heavenly place... albeit inhabited
by mostly devilish individuals. It has an outdoor patio, great door people,
ok music (good house), no vibe (a lot of speed merchants up since Thursday
morning :)
but whaddya want when the sun is shining in ur face and the music is 
pumping hard, and ur only half awake? Still a friendly place tho...

It also is one of the oldest gay bars in the city of SF and I believe the 
place where the wet jockey contest was invented :)  An interesting thing
to watch is its transformation from mostly straight crowd to gay crowd 
over the course of a Sunday morning/afternoon/evening (yeah... i've done a 
12 hour stint there after a rave :)

True story of an attempted pick-up at 6PM at the End Up of a straight
friend of mine:

"Wow... ur beautiful... are u gay or bi?"
"um.. do I have another choice ?"
"Ur straight? What u doing at a gay bar then?"
"sorry man, it was straight when I came here 12 hours ago :)"

Go there. There's history and more...

hugz :)

I don't think the point is that drug use is right or wrong.  The point is
that it is illegal, regardless of if that is right or wrong.  The police
officers' jobs are to prevent people from breaking the law.  Even if they
think it's a shitty law (which I'm sure many of them do) it's still their
job to enforce it.  I think the fact that they knew that weed was there and
didn't confiscate it shows that they are at least trying to be relaxed about
it.  I know plenty of friends at home who had run-ins with the borderline
psychotic HBPD where they intimidated them a lot for posession, which
doesn't seem to be the case here.  In any case, Jim wasn't discussing the
moral issue, just the legal one.

BY YOUR COMMAND;

	The End Up is a place where the creatures of the night come to
gather as the ACURSED morning sun arises, along with those stupid little
noisey birds(god I hate them). In this dark place, you will find the most
narly bunch of freaks ever assembled(so freaky the sight of which would
make Rush Limbaub go immediately into full cardiac arrest), which include
the enternally SPUN raver(dats me), vampire, & vampiress, club kid(I want
to get one for X-Mas so I can walk it around on a leash at parties; you
can be the first adult on your block to own their very own SF Club Kid,
East Coast Model More Expensive; it dances better:), goth, punk, gangsta,
prep, leather boy, fag hag, drag queens calore, bull dikes, punk dikes,
bull punk dikes, political bull punk dikes(you get The general idea), an
occasional lipstick lesbian(wheres the honey), and even sometimes, the
dreaded clueless earthling. 

	These creatures can easially be identified by the following 
general appearance characteristics:

	1. Prefers useing a flashlight, & Wears dark sunglasses even in
the club. 

	2. If not wearing sunglasses, one can notice the extremely enlarged 
pupil of these creatures, being no less than the size of a quarter. NOTE; 
observation of the pupil size can easially be accomplished because these 
creatures eyelids are generally wide open.

	3. Occasionally these creatures can be identified by a mysterious 
white powder on there noses, accompanied by strange & frequent snorting 
sounds. NOTE: It is thought that this white powder is an indication that 
these creatures mite be rabid. Caution should be used approaching these 
creatures if one notices this white powder on their noses.

	4. However some of these creatures can be very friendly, touchy &
feelly, so much so that they want to come home with you, ack.

	But in general, the End Up is very much like this, so do go, and 
experience it; as most seasoned SFRavers have, just don't bring anyone home, 
from there, with you; hehe!!!, and above all, never tell your mother.

Well, I made a tape a few months back of CLUB mixes by some of my fave 
artists- and they were GOOD mixes for the most part.  Some of the tracks 
on my tape were: 

Mesmerize (CHAPTERHOUSE)- remix (lots of deep bass)
Sexuality (BILLY BRAGG)- London remix (very ravey/vigorous beats)
The Promise (WHEN IN ROME)- Colisium Club mix (KILLER off CD3-single!)
Planet Love (THE DYLANS)- Club mix (6:34 mix- ALL synth from Britt pop)
Infested! (COURSE OF EMPIRE)- Club mix (industrial hard beats)
That Way Again (SEVEN RED SEVEN)- Minus-4 Mercury mix (ravey/thumpy)
Still Thinking (SEVEN RED SEVEN)- "Thinking of You" cassingle club mix
So Many People (HUBERT KaH)- Extended Dance Mix- keeps the beat going...
Fools Gold (THE STONE ROSES)- 12" version of a Guy Called Gerald mix!! 
Answer Me (ANYTHING BOX)- Pumped V2.2 mix (vinyl thing...)
Where is Love and Happiness (ANYTHING BOX) Ultraviolet remix by TWITCH
Let There Be Light (MIKE OLDFIELD)- B.T.'s Pure Luminescence mix (13:49)

Ok.  So, I found myself really liking B.T.'s remix of the rather mellow 
MIKE OLDFIELD track from _Songs from Distant Earth_ (?) CD.  But this was 
a just INCREADIBLE mix!  Very DEEP!  Constantly progressing and 
re-shaping itself- and then letting you FLY!  Then, it slows down for a 
bit and then there's a MID-release type thing, SIMILAR to when everyone 
decides to CLAP THEIR HANDS to the beat during a DJ's set...  After that 
it just LAUNCHES into more techno-beats and just is overall 
INVIGORATING.  so, WHO is this guy?  Or Woman?   I REALLY like "B.T."'s 
stuff and want to know if MORE stuff is out there!????????

If ANYONE can help me out on WHO "B.T." is or TWITCH, let me know if they 
appear on any other albums//comps..etc.  

By the way, people should also check ou

...I'm pretty new at all this (Organic was my first 
"Offical Rave"), ... Had a killer time at Organic on E.  But it 
seems to me it's just common sense to know there's usually more than 
just the door there, and I think you know that, unlike that other guy.

Shawna,

The point that I was trying to make is that r*ves were built and fueled by
many factors, drugs (and alcohol for that matter) being a MAJOR contributor.
I myself have being going to r**es since 1990, and every party that I have
been to (in 3 different countries, five differnt states) has been fuel
largly by chems.  Be it MDMA, MDA, LSD, DMT, psilibum, THC, or alcohol ect.
ect., there are many different doors to explore!  I just get tierd of
hearing people say that drugs are not an important part of the scene, and in
the same breath telling me what a killer time they had on E last week.
I been to a lot of parties high, and a lot of parties sober, but I have
never given anyone shit because they were high or not!
Whatever you do, take care of yourself first.

BY YOUR COMMAND;

	Everyone has been asking this, it seems like latey?, What is a
raver or raving for that matter. This is how I define a raver. 

	A International/InterGallactic Citzen.

	Mission: To spread, awareness, peace, love, positivity, tolerance,
and all the beliefs we share; refered to as PLUR; through out the
universe. In order to combat the whole sale slaughter of human dignity & turn
around the negativity, which seems to permeate this grid we call Earth. 
	
			TAKE BACK THE GRID


IN MY OPINION, WHICH COMES AS A RESULT OF MY SOMETIME CONTINUED & MAINTAINED 
AWARENESS WHILE EXPERINCEING LIFE.........

	Experience & awareness bring about change in humanity, for humans
need to become aware of a problem or an issue before they can change it.
This process of becoming aware, whether in be an internal process like a
macrophage marking a substance found in the body body as foreign, and 
making other cells, like Killer T cells aware of it's exsistance. 

	This awareness process can be external like when you sit in a
classroom, or watch a movie, and something in the presentation touchs your
spirit. 

	Or it can be a combination of the two, for example a rave. Where
you've take a substance that affects your bodies internal homeostasis,
while you're being bombared by external taste, smell, sight, sound, & tactile
sensations. 

	Awareness is the key here, so as far as D&A go's, if these
substances or these experiences enhanced or created by them, make your
more aware of that light that shines from within you, that shines from
within me, that shines from within us all, then I am for these experiences, 
then I am for anything than enhances ones awareness.

	But on the other hand, if these substances & experiences blinds you
from seeing that light within yourself, leave them. Because if you can't
see it first within yourself, then you will never be able to see it in
others, and ignorance, hatred, & intolerance will prevail. 

	Why do so many of us refuse to acknowledge what we are, by
quickly give away all your power to a drug, sad. It's not the drug, it's
YOU, you make it happen, YOU are powerful, YOU are magic. Gods have come,
gods have gone; we exsist, we survive, by being aware, adaptable, & the
most survivable creatures on the planet. We have gone & continue to go
where no other creature could survive, not even a roach. For a time our
bodies defy chaos, this force that's constantly tearing everything down
around us & including us. You are walking magic, don't you see it?

	I see my parents bitter, and old, because they worked their lives
away, and worshipped a false god(limiting lifes experiences, almost hiding
from them). I will not allow myself to be 70, never having experienced
what it was like to climb a mountain, and then smoke a bowl, do E & dance
all night, <<<<<<blank, you fill in>>>>>...etc. When I'm old, and a 
younger person asked me about an event in my history, I want to be able 
to tell them that I was there, this is what happen, this is how it made 
me feel. Not, oh i was working, or oh I sorta remember reading about that 
stuff in the paper or seeing those folks on TV.

	Drugs, education, life itself, bring about experience & awareness. 
Your dead for an enternity(my beliefs), you have but a small window to
experience life in all it's states, forms, and environments, and if there
is something behond, you'll be armed with a lifetime of experiences, some 
even to extremes.

	This came off kinda preachy, I'm aware of this, let me just say,
that this was & continues to be my path of maintained awareness &
discovery. I beg your forgiveness if I've offended anyone, it was not my
intention. 

	Also, I may appear hippocritical to some, all I have in my defense
is nothing in life is black & white. There are days that my level of
awareness is very high, and the love just pores outta of me, and other
days where I'm blinded by my own pride, greed, excess, lust, & desire, and
my lack of awareness can lead me to sometimes hurting my brother & sister. 
You never really arrive at 100% love, or 100% evil, but rather always
oscillating around a point. It's sorta like in math when you try and
calculate the limit of f(x) = x as x approaches infinite, you never get
there, you can only approach it. 

	My intention was/is to add my defination of a raver to the many, share 
my thoughts, feelings, & experience in a hope that you will see the power 
the lies within YOU, not a drug.

Many, many thanks to everyone who came out to Tribal Funk's Second Birthday
last saturday. From all the smiles we saw all night, we're sure that most
people had a great time and we had a great time putting it on.

>From the posts I have read, however, there seem to be a few questions and
rumors running amuck. Please feel free to contact me with any questions you
might have about the night, Tribal Funk, or our goal. We have always tried
to be completely open and honest about our parties. You may remember that
I posted our last newsletter to this list. In it I had written that  the
price of the party was going to be $15 before midnight. Because the police
called us on Wed. and charged us $4200 to have 8 police officers in the party
all night, we had to raise the admission price to cover our costs. We were
not happy about this. The armory is state property and therefore not subject
ot local jurisdiction. We had talked to the police 2 weeks before the party
and they said everyting was fine. But three days before the party, we were
in no position to argue the finer points of the legality of the police's
actions. However, the police behaved themselves very well. And by the end
of the night, the Srgt was telling us about a few locations in Richmond which
might be good places to hold future events. I want to thank everyone for
behaving themselves and putting forth a positive image that made the police
supportive of our event.

For those who had problems with regards to drugs at the party, we announced
on the voicemail that the police would be there and to be careful. We are
not able to provide a space which is exempt from the law. You choose to use
them at your own risk always.

We tried to alert everyone to everything they should have expected for the
night on the voicemail. We did not try to trick anyone.

The police decided at 12:30 that we had filled the hall to capacity and forbid
us to admit more people. People stood in line until nearly 3 am to get in.
We reduced the admission price to $10 for those who had to wait.

There were no tags whatsoever on Saturday night. We are really happy that
the scene has been policing itself. Thanks to all that didn't tag.

We frisked everyone who came to the party. If you didn't notice, the party
took place in the ghetto. It is not a safe neighborhood. We had a bunch of
locals come join us at the party. They were all great and we are glad they
came. Never the less, we would not risk allowing someone to bring a gun or
knife into the party. It is our responsibilty to provide a safe party and
we feel that frisking and searching bags is a necessary evil to provide that
safety.

Not allowing bottled water into the party was a policy enforced by the police.
If we had been allowed to control that, we would have allowed the water inside.
Nonetheless, there was free water inside. We appologize for the inconvienance.

The reason the laser and lights were still programming during the party was
because the light show, New Dimension Productions, arrived late and without
a power distro. We had to get Mark Wayne to go back to Concord and get another
so the lights would work. That meant that the laser and lights didn't get
power until 10:30. Also, we never turn on all our goodies at the beginning
of the night. We build everything up and are constantly changing what visual
effects are going. We feel that makes for a more interesting and dynamic
show. (The 20-watt laser was fucking amazing!!)

The final cost for the hall was just under $1500 but that does not include
many costs.

The party was very hot, but we rented fans to help ease the heat. We could
not open the windows because of the near-by neighbors. It would have allowed
to much noise to escape.

I think that answers most of the questions raised. If you have any more please
contact me. Its been a great two years. We've had a lot of fun. We hope everyone
else has too. We'll see you all at the next one. Keep Smiling.

Peace,
Colin

Well,  I was luckey somewhat,  and escaped the later Kundalini nasties.
I went to their first one,  it was pretty good,   held at the Troc just
after a Megatripolus event the previous week.   The 2nd one I missed because
something better was going on,   then I started getting bad reports on
SFRaves and stopped going after that.   Like last Saturday,   I had only
the previous weeks rave guide,   only thing going was Kundalini (According
to the 2 weeks old rave guide),  so first weekend in a long time,  I stayed
home.    Almost immediately,  the bad reports started coming in.    First
one was Darkness who got suckered TWICE (Tsk Tsk!!).    Rest is history,
lets move on folks....

Remember that Radio boom box idea I proposed a while ago?...   Well,  I get
word that KZSU is having a 24 hour marathon,   so perhaps we can try and pick
a good spot (Within KZSU's range whatever that is...).   We need people with
cars that have good beefy sound systems,  walkmans,  and of course large
and loud boom boxes.    Should produce some interesting echo effects..
But would be in interesting experiment,  anyone interested in trying
it out?

Everyone says that E is supposed to open you up to the Universe, etc. 
>From my own experience, that is true. Drugs give people the key to a 
door of perception that must unlocked before it can be ventured through.
I've often wondered if I would be able to have these types of experiences 
if that door had never been opened.

Many times I've had enlightening experiences while dancing. No drug could
ever come *close* to what I've experienced sober. It's much more intense
to be *high* on the energy at 3 am than to be high on something that's
going to make you depressed for the next two days. (IMHO)

I've done my share of partaking (and probably someone else's, too) and
probably will continue to do so in the future from time to time. On the
occasions when I don't, however, I often get tired and fall asleep for an
hour or two. But that's no sacrifice in comparison to what I'm gaining. 

There's nothing like having your everyday self ripped wide open for the
world to see and simultaneously being so full of energy you could burst. 

Being connected to the universal energy source without "static" is
indescribable. This specific type of connection, as far as I know, just
simply isn't possible in a drug-induced state. Buoyancy doesn't even cover
it. You feel like you're floating- like your feet are barely touching the
ground with the beats. That is more like like the definition of what
ecstasy is than Ecstasy could ever hope to be. :)

Sorry to go off like that, but I just had a vivid recollection of dancing
on saturday night at Burning Man... ahhh.

My first impression years ago at the first SRL show I saw was the same. It
was really cool and interesting but I kept getting this underlying feeling
that it was really just some big boys with some very interesting "toys". More
that just toys though, art as well as a statement about society and
technology...but mostly toys. Still my type of thing though and I've really
enjoyed the shows since the first one.

There is an overabundance of "boys" though, even though there were many women
involved in planning, producing, building, and operating the show. 

This show was the first SRL show I've been involved in. I worked with a woman
named Laurel. Laurel designed and built the "fighting guy" robots that were
hanging from an I-beam. I wrote the code that controlled them. My first trip
over to the SRL machine shop about two weeks before the show I expected to
find 5-10 "boys" working in some ultra-geeky machine shop. What I found was
about 20-40 people working on all sorts of projects for the show. There was
actually a good mix of people of all types... men, women, young, old,
techno-geeks (like me:), artists, etc. It seemed many of the machines were
individual or small group projects that would be incorporated into the show.
Not very structured at all, lots of freedom, and a good environment for
creative ideas. A very positive experience. I did not detect any elitism or
sexism or any other -ism...

But, the show itself does give a different impression. Too many guys in
machine shop suits w/remote controlls running in and around the machines.
Laurel and I sat near the audience attempting to control our robots (one of
which had been knocked off by the missle loader :(  ). I very much enjoyed
the show but if I must pick some nits they would be:

- I would prefer that they keep the show floor clear of as many "people" as
possible. The main offenders were the jump-suited robot controllers with
there remote-control boxes. This, I think, contributes to the "boys with
toys" experience many people go away with. I think this would also give the
robots/machines more of an autonomous look/feel. Keep it to machines and
props only.

-I would prefer that they keep the camera crews off the floor completely. I
know it probably added to the quality of the live internet feed but it was
very distracting. I just reviewed several videos people made from the
audience and its amazing how in every shot there were several camera people
in the way...

I hope I get a chance to help out again, and I encourage anyone (especially
more females) with some good ideas or skills to contact Mark Pauline and
volunteer. He seems to be very open to all sorts of ideas/peoples.

peace,
martin

I don't do alchohol or other drugs, I go to raves, I dance, I trance, I hug
and cuddle, I feal the love around me, I have a great time, I ride my
motorcycle home without risk of DUI or extreme liklyhood of death and I
wake up the next day feeling good. Very little of this would be the case if
I were to use drugs, you see,  I don't get this, getting a little high
bullshit. When I get loaded, it's all or nothing, full on, double vision
drunk, passing out, loud and obnoxious, numb to the world, to high to feel
the vibe or any thing else, damn near puking my guts out but somehow saving
that for the hangover that lats all day the next day.  I'm having way more
fun clean and sober, not that I didn't have some fun loaded, just less fun
and the problems really sucked.

If asked, I would explain, that I was fine, everything under control, I'm
not not an adict, why just look the brand of beer I'm drinking, $6.50 a
sixer,  class stuff, not like the $2.89 a 12 pack shit that adicts drink.
Yup I'm just fine, I'm shit faced drunk, on 4 hits of acid, and stoned into
stupidity, but I'm fine, it's those nasty crank users who have a problem.

Besides, not doing drugs leaves me money for important stuff, like records
and motorcycle maintenance.

Dear Colin;

	TONE STATEMENT: I admire your honesty, I never expected you to 
disclose = >. I'm angry, but honest, and very sincere.

	Thank you for your uncompromising honesty, however, I still feel
ripped off, and will ****never***** be attending another one of your
parties. I feel you should never have given that money to the police, you
opened up our scene to nothing more than petty extortion, from those sworn
to protect & to serve, thanks. Word will now travel in law enforcement
(brother cop) as well as the lawless that raves, & ravers are EASY
targets!!!!! Thanks for selling us out, what will our price be next time 
$8000.00, $10,000.00 where will it end.

	Some advice, tell Hollywood Dog to stay in LA(there's penty of
hungry, excellent light/laser tallent right here), tell the expensive LA
DJ's to stay there as well, and try and throw great parties like Gateway
or Friend's & Family, for cheap, Sometimes in the process of creating
something wonderful you must go back to your roots to see where you left
your true path. Just a sincere thought, but then who am I trying to tell
you how you should manage your parties, then again I got socked for
$40.00.

1) Wayne is not allowed to leave us.  He's far too cool, and Vince would
look weird without him.

2) After reading all the posts on this, here's my personal synthesis.  For
me, the drugs are totally optional.  One of the greatest times I had at a
rave was an Organic in the Park, and I was totally sober.  In fact, all of
the most amazing, spiritual events of my life, with one noteable exception
(but I believe that actually happened _in spite_ of the drugs), all happened
when I was sober.  When I was driving to LA this summer with my
friend/soulmate/ other half Tiesha, she told me this story about going to
Crater Lake in the middle of the night and seeing this huge body of
undisturbed water perfectly reflecting the sky above, and how it was the
most amazing thing she'd ever seen.  I can think of a lot of personal
experiences that were similar.  And when I think of the times I've felt most
connected with people, they also happened when I was sober.  I can
specifically think of a party I went to in high school where I ended up
spending the night there with about 25 other people, only about two or three
of whom I knew, and we all ended up as best friends.  

Go on a hike in the middle of nowhere with a few of your best friends
sometime and you'll see what I mean.  Personally, I think that any feelings
you have on drugs you can have when you're sober, too (at least I can).  And
ultimately, that's better because it all comes from you.  It's amazing what
the human mind can do, and people usually underestimate that power.  I mean,
think about how most people act on E.  What's preventing them from acting
that way normally?  Nothing, except themselves.  Sure, you may get some cool
visual and aural effects when you're high, but that's not the reason most
people I've talked to do them.  It's for the mental affects, the way you
percieve things.  Well, it's totally possible to percieve things that way
all the time if you just make the effort and stop thinking that the drugs
are responsible for your behaviour.  Ultimately, it's all you.

Brian-
I have some advice for you. Some of us had fun at Tribal Funk. Some of us did
not. Let it die!

I had a great time at that party, only to find posts by you and others have
totally screwed up my lovely memories of it. I am trying to turn every rave I
go to into a positive experience, even if it looks somewhat sketchy from the
start. 

And no, I don't agree with you that every rave I go to should be low budget
like FnF. That would be boring. FnF was a great rave, but it was not ALL
THAT. That light show at Tribal Funk was PHAT. I have never seen anything
like it in SF. The music was excellent also. Maybe Tribal Funk was not the
rave for you, but we all knew what to expect from the phone message! We also
knew that it would be a big budget rave. If you don't like those kind of
raves, you don't have to go to them. But don't go and then come back & tell
us all how it sucked. 

This is not just directed at you now, but I am sick of all these cry-baby
ravers who post negative comments after every event they go to. I am SORRY if
the events don't live up to your expectations, but I don't care! (Kundalini
was an exception of course, but it didn't even happen). I can just picture
some folks who can't wait to go home and start composing messages about how
this or that sucked. What a buzzkill, people. I am sick of all the negative
comments about these awful rave promoters who are out to rip us all off and
steal our money. W/o the promoters, there would be no scene! How about some
positive comments sometimes? There is a ton of negative energy on this list.
Ironically, the same people who do the most complaining post messages about
being positive. What's up with that? All of the messages I read every day
trashing the scene & the people do nothing for my enchancement of any event I
go to. 

As my friends used to say to me: "Just shut up and dance."

Brian, This is not the first time the scene has been the victim of extortion
nor will it be the last.  Would you rather that Tribal Funk politely
cancelled their party, so that we could sit here and complain about how inept
Tribal Funk is for losing their space? The fact of the matter is that the
police do not trust the rave scene.  Isn't Richmond part of Alameda County,
whose leaders are still in shock from the Cool World incident, who were
threatening to outlaw all forms of all night dance parties... It's true
that Cool World isn't representative of the rest of the scene but who
knows that except for us?  How will anyone learn?  We have to take
responsibility for things like Cool World and show the police that we
have much more to offer than that... this means that we probably will
have to party with them for a while.  We will have to keep paying them
off for a while.  It'll be hard, but we and the scene will survive and
the end result will be more trust on both sides.  Tribal Funk isn't the
enemy... that distrust on BOTH sides is.  Tribal Funk has thrown a lot
of good parties, and it may seem like they're detiorating or turning on
us but they're not.  Our scene is growing by leaps and bounds and 
confronting new parts of society that it hasn't had to face yet... 
thousands of young kids who grew up with gangsta images and their concerned
parents who are afraid of the violent world that threatens these kids...
That's a lot of fear and mistrust to deal with... but Tribal Funk and
the rest of us are dealing with it, working with it and growing more
and more together with every encounter.  Some encounters work better than
others.  But the net result is that of steady growth. Throwing a
massive on Thanksgiving weekend is harder than it looks, you get a lot
of strays and a lot of attention.  I think Tribal Funk is doing fine.

I don't get it.  One week everyone's complaining that all the DJs here
sound the same and blessed be the promotors that bring in the out of town
DJs for the special nights... and then on a big weekend like Thanksgiving
you're complaining that there were out of town DJs.  Gateway and Friend's
and Family parties are great, but serve an entirely different purpose, and
I don't think should be compared.  If Friend's and Family had thrown a
openly public massive on Thanksgiving I'm sure they would have to charge
more than $5.  Big parties play a very important role in our scene.  
and just because it can be harder for us to have fun at them doesn't mean
they are our enemy.  It just means we need to open our hearts just a
little more to start accomodating everyone.

and you didn't get socked for $40.  You should know that big parties
run the risk of costing you $20 and the risk that you will be exposed
to forces unexpected that will keep you from having the most fabulous
night of your life.  I've found that taking that risk pays for itself
in one way or another, just not always in the way I expected.  You
gave up your money of your own free will... if you don't feel it was
justified then never go to another Tribal Funk again, take that lesson
in exchange for your $40.  Only I hope that at some level you see that
you weren't really unknowingly cheated or abused.  We all have to take 
responsibility for our actions in order to free ourselves...

As for myself, I'm looking forward to the next Tribal Funk.

and remember, if life never sucked, we'd never notice how
fucking beautiful it is.

regards,
-john.

Friends & Family is commited to not charging more than $5 for any event
regardless of size, and we'll rarely if ever turn anyone away for lack of
funds.

Precedence: bulk

When I have been previously been critical of parties (with the exception of
Kundalini), I was not dropping a bunch of negative comments onto SFRaves
for the purpose of killing the promoter, or the party. I usually just want
to go to a better party next time, and quite often, SFRaves is the closest
thing to a feedback loop many promoters have to find out how to improve
their parties the next time they throw one. I also think that a lot of
promoters can learn from the lessons of their peers by paying attention to
what people say about other promoter's parties on SFRaves for the prupose
of improving things or incorporating good feedback for even their own
parties.

I've seen comments about Tribal Funk go both ways. Some people may have
misconstrued my words when I very briefly spoke earlier (in other threads)
about Tribal Funk. I never, ever said that it sucked, but here are some of
my suggestions on how to improve things to make it even better, and also
what I liked about the party even the way it was.

--
Tribal Funk was not perfect.
--
It cost $20 due to law enforcement. I don't like paying $20 for a party.
Maybe it's in my mind. I used to have a problem with $15 parties, but I
have learned to live with it when the parties are great or it's obvious
that the money was spent really well. I would be happy to pay $0-$10 for
'okay' parties and $15 for 'great' parties indefinitely, but unless there's
something really extraordinary to cause it, I would appreciate it greatly
if parties could cost $15 or less. There are some things that cause the
party to cost more. For instance, if you are flying in some really big guns
from somewhere that cost a *lot* to hire and transport or, like in this
specific case, the law enforcement 'problem' caused the party to cost more
at the last minute, and that's just the way that it is.

As a promoter, there's not much you can do about 'the law enforcement
problem' when your use permits' validity is at the hands of the local
police chief and he has a bunch of officers that would be glad to take your
profits in the form of overtime, 'working' at your party, against your
will, as a condition of your permit.

Yes, I was bummed at the aforementioned high law enforcement presence, but
I am beginning to live with the fact that this will probably continue to be
the trend at the larger parties. I am not bummed *because they were there*.
I don't mind seeing a lot of cops. They are my friends. My father was a cop
for 25 years. But as a responsible, non-dangerous, non-tagging, non-violent
raver, I just don't want to have to pay extra for them if possible.

The downside to the 'law enforcement problem' here is that the extra
charges pushed the promoter's venue costs up from $1500 to nearly $6000.
That's quite a cost hike, and of course, the promoters have no choice but
to pass it on to the consumers. It's not Tribal Funk's problem if they got
screwed into hiring a bunch of cops as a condition of their use permit.
It's just unfortunate for all that it happened.

In fact, regular clubs in San Jose all get screwed this way, every night
they are open past midnight. They are *forced* to hire off-duty San Jose
police officers to stand around outside their clubs (and even totally
mellow coffee houses!) to 'protect the peace' or their use permit will
either not be issued or just plain revoked! The way a club owner finds out
about this is when they go to apply for their use permit in San Jose they
get a call from someone in the police department 'downtown' telling them
about all these officers that are looking for overtime pay and that their
permits will be issued sooner/at all if the club owner will employ these
off-duty cops! San Jose has also passed laws that completely outlaw all
dancing past 2:00am, even for 21+ clubs and venues! Now *that's* an
unfriendly town!

At Tribal Funk (and any other parties that area *required* to hire police)
the real bummer is that most all the cops did was stand around in uniform
all night and talk to each other, while you and I (and the promoters) paid,
and paid, and paid. I would have rather the extra $5 bought us a Doc Martin
[or fill in the name of your favorite big-gun out of town DJ] for the
night, etc., etc. or the party could have just cost the planned $15. But
that's the way it was, and once explained, it makes perfect sense why it
was $20.

It was pretty hot and humid. This was my first party in a big concrete gym
(or a big concrete gym called an 'armory', in this case). I am used to
dedicated dance venues like King Street, etc. that are better prepared to
hold hundreds of sweaty dancers, etc. Because this place is not really
designed to hold 1500 sweaty dancers, it was pretty warm and humid inside.
Sometimes getting all sweaty while dancing feels great -- you know, like
you're dancing harder or something, but eventually you just want to be
dryer and cooler in the long run. The fans placed around the building were
welcome additions, but it was still pretty hot and wet in there. I don't
think that the heat was a problem, but the humidity was. This happens, and
I am used to being in a room full of sweaty dancers, but I would never say
no to some good old A/C or fresh air.

There was no ambient area. More important to me personally was there was no
ambient room, or even at least a big enough area full of w/ soft seating to
hold all the people that wanted chill out. I've gotten used to the idea of
having a soft, and if lucky, ambient music filled area to hang out in when
I get too tired to dance. So when I was really, really tired, there was
really no where to go. Since it was in one big concrete room, not much
could be done to fix that. The main area was kinda hard (concrete and
all...) The outside area was there, but totally dark, and too cold and wet
(dewpoint, ya' know) later in the night to really hang around for too long.
I would go from soaking myself inside from dancing to drying myself outside
and then go back inside again to be warm. Maybe that area could have had a
couple of lights and heaters to keep the chill off the air?  Maybe a
chill-out tent in that other parking lot area where the generators were? It
looked pretty big out there when I peeked my head out the door by the
women's bathroom that led to the inside parking lot. Having a comfortable
place to 'get away from it all' is a *really* nice thing to have when you
have a bunch of tired ravers that need somewhere to crash for a while. Just
a suggestion.

--
Tribal Funk was great:
--
It was consistently probably the best music I have heard at a rave all
year. From the time we got there around 11:30pm, and all the way until 8am,
the music was really, really, really good. I am *still* kicking myself for
not having the energy (either via a good night's sleep the night before or
via stimulants) to stay awake *all night* to take advantage of that music!

I would like to know who played in what order so I can get it all straight
in my mind. I think it went Utopia (xx:xx-11:30) [before we got there],
Tony (11:30-1:30), Dan (1:30-3:30), Trance (3:30-5:30), Garth/Jeno combo
(5:30-8:00).

Tony's, Dan's and Trance's sets were great! The relentless slamming beats
during Dan and Trance's sets were to die for! I want to hear those guys
again soon! Somewhere in between two of the sets was that house singer,
too, but I was outside when that happened. The Garth/Jeno combo was the
first time I have ever seen two DJ's tag-team a set at a rave.

I would definitely buy mix tapes of the entire night's music if available.

The visuals and the lasers were also totally cool. It seems that people are
finally starting to more consistently spend money on 'extras' like lasers
which definitely make a party feel more deluxe and complete. I would
consider them required party ingredients, much like the sound system and
the DJ's are. It definitely gives a party a much bigger presence.

I also got to spend time with some SF Raves people I never met before like
Robert Smith, who I talked to for over an hour, and RAFONE (including
RAFONE belt buckle, so we can remember who he is!) and I saw a other people
I knew, too.

--
Aside from any other critique, everybody agreed that the music and lasers
were both top notch.

With all said, Tribal Funk's definitely on course for putting on good
parties. They obviously learned quite a bit that night and I am sure those
insights will be incorporated into future events.

Yes, I would go to another Tribal Funk.

> tell the expensive LA
>> DJ's to stay there as well,
first of all...i agree with john that no one should be complaining about
the presence of out of town dj's...it would be nice to see some new faces
around here and i must say i was quite refreshed to go back to la and hear
some dj's other than garth and jeno...not knocking their style but when
they are virtually one of a small coterie that gets hired for every
party...things stagnate....there are plenty of non-money grubbing and
excellent dj's from la of all styles, but it does cost money to get up
here...i hardly think that's a problem for promoters who would charge
fifteen bucks for their parties anyway...
>>
and try and throw great parties like Gateway
>> or Friend's & Family, for cheap,
that's pretty hard to do, especially if there are any flaky people involved
and finding a nice or even decent location for little money has got to be a
bitch,..consider yourselves lucky that san francisco police are relatively
lenient as the lapd would hardly stand for all the full moons, etcetera
that go on here...my friend saw someone shot at a party last weekend for
christ's sake....
anyways, enough bitching, its true.. i dont have the energy to throw a
party right now, but if i have one thing to say its dont condemn promoters
for taking a risk,..only for charging fifteen or twenty for EVERY party
(the reason i cant really go out very often and probably the reason that
almost every sf raver is older than the ravers everywhere else)

>and remember, if life never sucked, we'd never notice how
>fucking beautiful it is.
well said... :) nice thought

Yes, just like most of the south-of-market clubs, it's a gay club gone
straight, sometimes. At least it's not as bad as the likes of the
Oasis, the Stud, Club Nine (still there?.) that used to be all gay
(except a few straights looking for a decent DJ, like me.)

BUT, I drove by last weekend and it made me sad to see the old wooden
sign END UP (that has warmed my heart after coming down off the 6th
street off ramp of 280 for the last 10 years ( excluding earthquake
repair) , kindof ment I had arrived in SF!) REPLACED with a covering
that was tie-die colors and said something like TWISTER, or something
that started with a T.

 ANybody know what's up with THAT! Maybe it's personal, but I'd miss
that sign! It was bad enough when thay painted the outside of the
building PEACH color. Or is it SALMON!!! YUUK. Reminds me of my mom's
kitchen!

I don't mean to drag this thread on for ever butjust a quick point-

I went, got there at 12.30 right when the cop stopped letting people in.  TF
crew were not doing one-in/one-out because the cops wouldn't let them. I
would have left but my ride was messed up. I sat in a circle of people to
keep warm while Tf crew passed out flowers and candy to cher up the crowd.
 Teased by the music every time the door swung open.

I hitched a ride home at 3.30am, when they started letting people in again ,
but my freinds who stayed said they got in for $10.   Maybe those you talked
to who asked for another 20 werenot really TF promoters-  there were a few
people hanging around tring to get 20 out of some ravers at 4 (so I heard
from friends).  Sorry about your car situation - We parked two blocks away :(
to avoid this problem.  
TF did suck and it was a waste of a Sat night. for me.

I hope this weekend will be much more X-citin'.  By the way Sat (2nd) is my
20th b-day (no longer a teenager) and I want to do something super phun.  
Not Focus, I wish Wicked (1 more yr.), possiblly the Troc.(Banco de Geia)?
Can I get any mo suggestions from anyone?

Okay!

Onto future things.  I had a great time at Organic, and was checking 
out the possbilities of the Gathering in Dec.  Have heard from a couple 
of places that this might be a good party, (keep hearing about The 
Mythical Ethan Miller!) and I wanted some feedback to see what people 
have thought about past ones.  Is this generally a smaller party?  Is 
it traditionally a great one?  From Amy Starkey's previous posts, it 
sounds like a good one.  Any info for me, O Experienced Ones?

Richmond is in Contra Costa County.  Despite it's perceived
conservatism, CCC seems to be the only place allowing large raves
these days.  Richmond is doing it because they need the money-they're
one of the poorest bay area cities.  It's a minor inconvenience to
them for the $$$.  I'm glad to see their starting to have a more
sympathetic, or should I say, less antagonistic attitude toward
parties.  

There's an enlightening article in today's Tribune about the Cool
World "incident" in which police were caught off-guard by the size of
the party and the noise from an outdoor soundsystem.  Apparently the
city of Oakland, who permitted the party, didn't know or care about
the size of the party or the noise until people complained.  If
promoters are are going to stay above ground, they'll have to
communicate and coordinate with the authorities better.

The upshot of the article was that city officials were asleep at the
wheel, and that the promoters took advantage of their lack of
attention to detail.  If they can get the "juice" in city hall, I
wouldn't be surprised to see them back in Oakland.

Best quote(Kenni Ski, Cool World):"Cyberfest is not a free love,
youth-oriented, drug and alcohol fest reminscent of the '60's.
Sorry."

Apology accepted.

One of my favorite memories of Sunset was when I suddenly heard this

It  might make you moore sympathetic to what producers and promoters go
through to throw a party. They are usually required to hire security cops as
part of an rental agreement, and not because they prefer to. The vibe that
is created at smaller parties I find much more enjoyable due to the fact
that the people throwing them arent in it for the money, but just to throw a
good party. Also I find the people who seek out the smaller more intamate
functions are more into the old spirit and vibe that seems to be getting
more and more absent at the mainstream parties.Remember a 20 dollar charge
dosent mean a better party, just more greed and less of the true spirit of
the rave.

BOY those were the days. It was made possible by the the boys from Renegade
Jon "the Mac", and the  Sean Murray. It was a vintage party, lots of smiling
faces and always a good time. Jon is in Atlanta , Georgia and Sean is
working with Progress these days, Scrambled held its last party months ago,
but I hope I get to see them work together  again. They were dedicated to
the old shool way.Mabey they will get together to throw 420 again this year,
If you hear of it come April I suggest you attend. These boys threw a good
one last year, Beautiful location , beautiful people  and a beautiful
feeling.

	For thanksgiving I spent a few days with family in LA. By pure
	chance, I stumbled across a great record store - StreetSounds, 
	somewhere in West Hollywood.

	The staff were friendly, attitude free, the listening stations
	looked top notch, and although I didn't have much time to flip
	around, the record selection looked really good. 

	Anyway, as I had little time or money, I decided to pick up a
	couple of tapes - lots of DJ's I'd never heard, or even heard 
	of. 

	Marques Wyatt, the Vocal experience - you could guess by the 
	name, nice house, well mixed, nice mellow music.

	Christopher Lawrence. This one's labelled Contact, and you can 
	feel the aliens taking notice when you play it. Acid/Trance
	Techno material, nifty mixing, *great* records, one of the 
	best tapes I've heard since arriving here.

	Don't know if you can pick these up in SF, but they're both 
	worth the money if you like that type of music (which is 
	saying a lot, given the price of tapes...)

	Keep it tidy,
	Gary

Thank you for posting this!!  I am new to this group, don't even live in 
the city, attend about a party a month.....and all this negativity is 
driving me crazy.  A FEW comments are cool to let everyone know what's up, 
but then...get over it.

hello all-
i haven't had a chance to go to a decent party since semtember.  i'd like
all of you who gripe to remember how lucky you are to be in san francisco.
we have one of the best vibes around.  vibes ebb and flow.  maybe we're in a
down time.  that happens with cycles.  
if the party you're at isn't up to your standards, you have two choices.
1)accept it as part of the cycle that every scene, religious group,
community etc goes through and try to make the best of it.  make sure that
you are not one of the people dragging the vibe down, and maybe you'll just
find yourself enjoying it after a while.  or 2) go home and cry that all the
world is against you.  i find option #1 much more preferable.

so, to the people who are distressed about our scene, remember who is the
scene: it is not external, we are the scene.  if you do not like, that you
work to change it.  don't ask other people to.  this external locus of
control crap annoys me.

peace, love, and annoyance-

matt

p.s. i love you all, and hope to see you at whatever great rave i find
myself at this friday.  we are the scene: it does not exist outside of us.

Hello everybody,

MAD, like last week, had magic.  Yippee! it looks like we've got a place to
hang-out and be with friends that you wouldn't normally see.  Such as 
Victor, moving here from Detroit & who is on this list, maybe?
 
As well as due to who's doing MAD, the magic might also be due to its
being in a Brazilian place. Brazilians are accustomed to having fun,
you know.  Unlike so many people in the US who suffer from having been 
raised Puritans, without even knowing it.  

It was so much fun to scoot around on that nice little dancefloor, the
music at just the right volume for enjoyment.  I appreciated that MAD
was 18 and above.  One suggestion to the door personnel:  marking those 
of us who can drink with nothing more than a black magic marker "X" is 
really NOT enforcing the liquor laws.  Is this a private joke or have you 
simply not had the time to snag a MAD stamp?  Don't tempt me to bring 
along a Sharpie from the lab. <|--- a mo bio in joke that maybe one other 
person on this list will get but probably won't think is very funny...)

Regarding the vibe:  there was just enough attitude 
there to be interesting. In low doses attitude is essential.  It's the 
tension that keeps you walking upright when you want to curl up into a 
little ball, sometimes.  Long live attitude.

Here's a little tidbit for you:  one night a week Bahia Cabana hosts a 
70's disco funk night.  the flyer encourages you to dress as either a 
"pimp" or a "ho."  Ahem.  My own Puritan attitude rises up and slaps my 
face.  Yikes!

Love,

Ann 


PS Miss Mona Love may just be getting a new job at a soon-to-be-announced 
coffee shop.  Please let's think good thoughts for Miss Mona so that she 
will no longer have to rely on the kindness of friends and strangers 
quite so much and will start getting the kind of renumeration for her 
good deeds that pays the bills.  render unto ceasar, the landlord, and 
all that.  and, of course, Pac Bell.

Oh yes... I'm listening to his Technosis mix tape as I type this.  It 
*BLOWS* my mind!! It's almost like a portable F&F rave! ;)

 No they are quite large.  Ususally 
over 1500 people.  This will be a 20 dollar party, but well worth it with 
*incredible* music and most likely a teriffic laser show.

Well said, Dave!  Inanimate objects are neither good nor bad, it's what

        Hey everyone,
        I just did up this little flyer thing to hand out at raves, office
parties, chrismas get togethers and whatnot ;) and i also put up on my web
pages. If you want to see it, point your browsers at

        http://www.magnet.ca/~ecto/invitation.html

        The thing is, i need suggestions as to what to put on the other
side of the flyer!  Think Black and White, think text or suggest a graphic
(i have a whole load of clip-art...hmm how about "may is beef month" or
something? ha ha).
        You'll be accredited if you can help me out!
                thanks,
                        brad

ps->oh and on the topic of web pages, i'm redoing my site and am looking
for links (in all the wrong places...as the song goes ;) so if you all have
any suggestions i'd appreciate it!

I found this website that allows you to search through newsgroups.  I typed
'analog synthesizers' and got 27000 hits.  
     http://dejanews2.dejanews.com/cgi-bin/nph-dnquery

  You also might want to check out Keyboard magazine I've seen some emulated
analog synths that can use MIDI.
  
                  good luck.

Hi-
	On a totally non-rave related note: 

	We have two rooms for rent in a six bedroom house in the 
Elmwood/Rockridge area of Berkeley/ North Oakland. (Near 
Alcatraz/College intersection)   We have a shared kitchen, living room, 
deck,  laundry machines, and off street parking.   BART is about a ten 
minute walk, the freeway is a couple of minutes by car, and UC campus is 
about 15 minutes by bike.  The place is also wheelchair accessible.

	The first bedroom is carpeted, it has its own entrance, and a 
half-bath.   $335/month + $490 deposit.

	The second bedroom is smaller, but very liveable, and has a 
hardwood floor.   $280/month + $350 deposit.

	Your housemates will be 4 males (potentially 4 males & 1 female).  Two 
of us are ravers, and everyone is friendly. 

	We would like to fill the rooms immediately, i.e. December 1 or 
sooner.  If this interests you, or someone you know, please either contact 
me or pass the word on.  Come check it out.

     Mac pegs the End-Up perfectly :)  One of the first places I discovered 
     in the 80's, it still has alot of charm, raunch, and +/-vibe along 
     w/the regulars who make it a comfortable haunt for me.  Sundays are 
     usually the best time to come down, lounge, see who's done whatever 
     the night before, and/or go off (again?).  It's still tweeky at times 
     but it always pumps wailing divas and alot more ;)  I will say, 
     though, that it's not everyone's cup of tea.
     
     Recently (the past few of months), it's gone through some changes 
     w/r/t management, drumming, keeping the sliding doors closed, "noise 
     complaints", and 86'ing people for the day...it's not like it used to 
     be, but then again, I love it 'cause it's always changing.  I think 
     the worse time for some of us ravers there is when the "Melrose Place" 
     crowd kicks in on the afternoons.
     
     Darrel asks about the End-Up sign which is still hanging.  When 
     there's other gigs going on, the promoters often put other signs up 
     over it (e.g., Sugar on Fridays) so don't fret, you can see your 
     regular sign still there sans mom's kitchen.
     
     So Shawna, I encourage you to check it out as well as other venues.  
     It takes a while to find what you want from the scene and where you 
     want to add your loving vibe.  
     
     Hope to meet you sometime!
     
     Diane  :)

BY YOUR COMMAND;


	Mondorology
	The Ancient Wisdom Of Revolution

	1. NATURE

	The caterpillar found love & became a butterfly in paradise. In 
the strip mall the robot butterfly is forced to imitate media 
fantasies/lies where paradise is a shopping mall filled with plastic idol 
wordshipers. In the mall, fear & paranoia are the enemies of communication.

		Humor is love, laughter is meditaion, respect & humility 
the mothers of revolution.

	2. "Reality"

		(Image aA Picture of an Alien)

	3. Language

	Media is the tool
	People are the subjects
	Subtlety is the technique
	Mind control is the objective
	
		Open your eyes
		Don't get hypnotized

	4.  Technology

	Who are the cops on the information super highway? who is the 
pimp for the techno-lust?

		repeat the mantra

		Plastic Surgery
		Computer Chip Brain Implants
		Biotechnology
		Digital Disinformation
		Home Shopping, Genetic Engineering,
		Breast Implants,
		Cybernetics

		repeat infinitely

	5. Religion
		Consciousness Avoided
			Religion = Consumption
			Capitolism = Text
			Consumers = Followers
			Money = God

		the conscious will not buy
		in time the false technology prophets
		will go broke
		imagination is freedom
		Consciousness Found

The calendar has phattened up after Thanksgiving.  XNTRK has a good lineup
for friday night, and Wicked and the EBN/Banco de Gaia show should be a
good bet for Saturday night.  For the budget-conscious, try the Top on
Friday, Vanilla Fudge on Saturday, MAD on Monday and Come/Unity on Wednesday.
See you next week...

P.S.- Subscription and unsubscription info is at the bottom, as usual.

It said $8 in the Trocadero's ad in the "GHB" issue of the SF Weekly... I
just saw the ad today. Maybe the Troc gave BASS the wrong price, which they
unknowingly charged? Call the Trocadero at 995-4700 if you have quetstions.

ps: read the creatively written review of EBN's "Telecommunications
Breakdown" album in the same issue of the SF Weekly.

"Get Down! Get Down! -- Get Down! Get Down!" - EBN

See you there!!!

   the Sound Factory, 525 Harrison. $10. 415.974.9389



Whoa...many of you may not know Dimitri (he's not the guy from DeeLite),
but let me tell you, he's amazing!  He spent some time in Detroit
a few years ago, and his set is on my all time top ten list...

Subject: GHB redux
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

This week's SF Weekly has a feature on GHB that attempts to be balanced and
provide an overview of the drug's users. It tends to focus on it's use as a
disinhibitor and sex enhancing agent, but mentions its club scene use as
well.

A couple things stood out:

3/4 of those admitted to emergency rooms under the influence of GHB had
also consumed other drugs, such as alcohol or CNS depressants, which will
act synergistically to increase the drug's effects.

This drug is unlike any other that I know of in that small doses have a
simulant effect, while larger doses act as a depressant or even an
anesthetic. The margin between a stimulant and depressant dose is slim.

At any rate, it's a decent article and basically supports the adage that
one should be know what they're doing before they do it.

	He wasn't up at Burning Man was he? I was talking with someone 
guy from Amsterdam who had played an amazing acid trance set (first 
time I heard Hyperspace by TIP), just wondering if it was the same guy, 
so I could hear such sounds once more

I know Jack ('n 2) Acid very well :) Actualy there was some guy who put 
out tracks under that name around 88, but I'm sure many people have gone

For all you LA transplants like myself...also check out PRIME CUTS(right up
the street from street sounds)This is probrably the fattest record store in
LA(they have it all)I remember when Doc used to work there and....also DMC
and Beat-Non-Stop(steve Loria's shop)kick ass too DMC is pretty cheap and
stock House/TEchno oldies but goodies(a lot of nice re-issues too)Beat-Non
Stop has alot o stuff but it's pricey.in two weeks I will post my review of
Dr. Freecloud's Mixing Lab(I'm going on a pilgrimage)ME and a couple o
friends are headed for the city of Angles for an OPeration..(long Live Ron

It is still a great party, although the Wicked's of yesteryear were truly
LEGENDARY! Maybe one day they will return to that level of glory but
I don't think it can be achieved within the confines of any club.

It is $15 but since it's your birthday, I will comp you +1

Well I can only speak for myself, traditionally Wicked is about House Music
(in all of its forms and manifestations)  We strive to attain and 
maintain a  certain level of consciousness or vibe at the party, it's 
hard to explain but the metaphor I like to think of is that of "building
a House", it may take the most part of the evening to lay the foundation,
which is important, it's hard to put into works but the party has to reach
a certain critical mass before it can go to the next level, this is not
just a function of the DJ, or, the music they are playing, it is an 
alchemical mix of the DJ, music, venue, and most of all THE PARTY GOERS
and what they bring with them.  If you bring a lot of spectator energy
(which has been happening lately) they that's what you get, if you bring
a lot of participatory energy then that's what you get.

Wicked's tend to be on the "freaky" side, and I mean this in everything
good about the word, the party has always had and encouraged a sort of
pan-sexual atmosphere and the most amazingly exotic looking men and women
often turn up at Wicked's.

It's also about out of your head dancing, hard beats that pull you deep 
into the vibe of house and try to maintain you there for a long time after
the party.

I _think_ so, I remember someone mentioning a DJ from amsterdam named 
Dimitri, and I figure it's probably the same guy.

Hey

Well, now I'd REALLY like to meet some of you sfravers at the 
Gathering, since my friend went and ditched on me!  I'll have to go it 
alone (*SOB*)  Are there any of you out here in the East Bay area, like 
Pleasant Hill/Concord who're going to the Gathering?  I'd like to 
carpool or something, don't wanna go all by my poor lonesome!  

And Amy, I think you should present your great idea to the virtual 
gang!  I think it's a cool idea, and I would definitely be up for doing 
that, esp. that I'm coming alone now!

You can go down to the Troc (or the rekk stores) and buy them there with no
svc charge.
